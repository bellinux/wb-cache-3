25|$|Under {{the federal}} Holidays Act, Canada Day is {{observed}} on July 1, unless that date falls on a Sunday, {{in which case}} July 2 is the statutory holiday. Celebratory events will generally still take place on July 1, {{even though it is}} not the legal holiday. If it falls on a Saturday, any businesses <b>normally</b> <b>closed</b> that day will usually dedicate the following Monday (July 3) as a day off.|$|E
25|$|Compared {{with other}} medieval churches, {{relatively}} few {{changes have been}} made to the cathedral since its consecration. In 1323 a substantial two story construction was added at the eastern end of the choir, with a chapel dedicated to Saint Piat in the upper floor accessed by a staircase opening onto the ambulatory (the chapel of St Piat is <b>normally</b> <b>closed</b> to visitors, although it occasionally houses temporary exhibitions). The chamber below the chapel served the canons as their chapter house.|$|E
50|$|The vitelline duct <b>normally</b> <b>closes.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Hostels <b>normally</b> <b>close</b> {{during the}} day to keep down cost (for the {{customer}} and the hostel).|$|R
50|$|The ductus arteriosus <b>normally</b> <b>closes</b> {{within one}} or two days of birth, leaving the ligamentum arteriosum, while the {{umbilical}} vein and ductus venosus usually closes within two to five days after birth, leaving, respectively, the liver's ligamentum teres and ligamentum venosus.|$|R
25|$|Furthermore, {{there is}} a small amount of tourism, mainly {{associated}} with anglers interested in lagoon fishing (for bonefish in particular) or offshore fishing. Week-long ecotourism packages during which some of the <b>normally</b> <b>closed</b> areas can be visited are also available. In recent years, surfers have discovered that there are good waves during the Northern Hemisphere's winter season and there are interests developing to service these recreational tourists. There is some tourism-related infrastructure, such as a small hotel, rental facilities, and takeaways.|$|E
25|$|It {{was used}} for the {{carriage}} {{of a wide variety of}} cargo, and passenger services were also introduced. These proved popular, and two boats a day made the journey during the summer months, with one in the winter. They gradually faced competition from the adjacent turnpike road, which was quicker but more expensive. A connecting lock was built in 1834, to enable boats to enter Aberdeen harbour, which eased the problem of transhipping goods to larger vessels. The canal <b>normally</b> <b>closed</b> between December and March each year, due to icing.|$|E
25|$|The {{brutality}} was {{aggravated by}} alcohol, particularly at night. Frequent and extreme drunkenness, {{which was a}} common problem within the SA, aggravated the situation at Kemna, as numerous former inmates later testified. Typically, off-duty guards would go out drinking at nearby taverns and hours later, return inebriated, ready {{to take part in}} interrogations. Sometimes, they would begin their own so-called interrogations, unsupervised. Local taverns, <b>normally</b> <b>closed</b> at the hours the guards were ready to drink, were faced with violence and threats if they did not re-open. Veller's drinking was so out of control that he was incapable of showing up for work on a regular basis—and it was no secret.|$|E
5000|$|Such {{retainers}} {{were not}} necessarily in the domestic service or otherwise <b>normally</b> <b>close</b> {{to the presence of}} their lord, but also include others who wore his livery (a kind of uniform, in distinctive colours) and claimed his protection, such as musicians and private teachers.|$|R
50|$|The {{examination}} of the corneal reflex {{is a part of}} some neurological exams, particularly when evaluating coma. Damage to the ophthalmic branch (V1) of the 5th cranial nerve results in absent corneal reflex when the affected eye is stimulated. Stimulation of one cornea normally has a consensual response, with both eyelids <b>normally</b> <b>closing.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{carnival}} {{takes place}} on the weekend in early to middle June, <b>normally</b> <b>close</b> to the Helsinki Day on 12 June. Unlike the Rio Carnival, {{it is not possible}} to hold the carnival in January through March, because like many other places in northern Europe, the outdoor temperature in Helsinki is far too low at that time.|$|R
25|$|There are depletion-mode MOSFET devices, {{which are}} less {{commonly}} used {{than the standard}} enhancement-mode devices already described. These are MOSFET devices that are doped so that a channel exists even with zero voltage from gate to source. To control the channel, a negative voltage {{is applied to the}} gate (for an n-channel device), depleting the channel, which reduces the current flow through the device. In essence, the depletion-mode device is equivalent to a <b>normally</b> <b>closed</b> (on) switch, while the enhancement-mode device is equivalent to a normally open (off) switch. Due to their low noise figure in the RF region, and better gain, these devices are often preferred to bipolars in RF front-ends such as in TV sets. Depletion-mode MOSFET families include BF960 by Siemens and Telefunken, and the BF980 in the 1980s by Philips (later to become NXP Semiconductors), whose derivatives are still used in AGC and RF mixer front-ends.|$|E
25|$|At the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal National Historical Park, {{commercial}} photography {{requires a}} permit under certain circumstances. For photography {{that involves the}} advertising of a commercial product or service, or photography that involves sets or props or models, a permit is required. In addition, if the photography has aspects that may be disruptive to others, such as additional equipment or {{a significant number of}} personnel or the use of public areas for more than four hours, it is necessary to obtain a permit. If a photographer or related personnel need to access an area during a time when the area is <b>normally</b> <b>closed,</b> or if access to a restricted area is involved, the photography requires a permit. For commercial portrait photographers, there is a streamlined process for photography permits. In the case of National Park system units, commercial filming and/or audio recording requires a permit and liability insurance. Still photography that uses models or props for the purpose of commercial advertising requires a permit and proof of insurance.|$|E
25|$|The bailout {{block is}} a small {{manifold}} fitted either to the harness where {{it is in a}} convenient but protected position, commonly on the right side on the waist strap, or on the helmet, also usually {{on the right side of}} the temple, with the valve knob to the side to distinguish it from the free-flow or defogging valve which is commonly to the front. The bailout block has a connection for the main gas supply from the umbilical through a non-return valve. This route can not be closed and supplies the helmet demand valve and free flow valve under normal circumstances. The bailout gas from the back mounted cylinder passes through a conventional scuba first stage at the cylinder valve, to the bailout block, where it is normally isolated by the bailout valve. When the diver needs to switch over to bailout gas he simply opens the bailout valve and the gas is supplied to the helmet or mask. As the valve is <b>normally</b> <b>closed,</b> a leak in the first stage regulator seat will cause the interstage pressure to rise, and unless an overpressure relief valve is fitted to the first stage the hose may burst. Aftermarket overpressure valves are available which can be fitted into a standard low-pressure port of most first stages.|$|E
5000|$|An {{argument}} {{between the}} <b>normally</b> <b>close</b> brothers happens {{the day before}} a swim meet, where Mike tells Jack {{he wants to take}} a long drive alone to get his head together for the meet. When Jack suggests Mike talk it over with him, Mike explodes and tells him to stop [...] "hanging around my neck like an anchor".|$|R
50|$|The {{traditional}} devices of the catalogue aria include a solidly neutral opening, {{a section of}} rising comic excitement full of rapid patter and an emphatic final cadence, <b>normally</b> <b>closing</b> with an epigram. Common features include asyndeton, anaphora, rhyme schemes, and complete phrases stacked two to a line, typically expressed with joy, anger, excitement or fear, routinely fast declamation of patter in a generally mechanical and often impersonal way.|$|R
50|$|The station {{cannot be}} relied upon {{as a way of}} {{reaching}} Blackheath during November's traditional free firework show, as it <b>normally</b> <b>closes</b> early on that day for safety reasons. Conversely, in April, on the Sunday of the London Marathon, it is crucial in enabling athletes and their supporters to reach the starting line, as on that day bus services across the heath are usually suspended as roads are closed.|$|R
500|$|... patent foramen ovale– a hole {{between the}} atrial {{chambers}} {{of the heart}} in the fetus is <b>normally</b> <b>closed</b> by a flap with the first breaths at birth. In about 20% of adults the flap does not completely seal, however, allowing blood through the hole when coughing or during activities that raise chest pressure. In diving, this can allow venous blood with microbubbles of inert gas to bypass the lungs, where the bubbles would otherwise be filtered out by the lung capillary system, and return directly to the arterial system (including arteries to the brain, spinal cord and heart). In the arterial system, bubbles (arterial gas embolism) are far more dangerous because they block circulation and cause infarction (tissue death, due to local loss of blood flow). In the brain, infarction results in stroke, and in the spinal cord it may result in paralysis.|$|E
500|$|In the mid-1930s Knight befriended {{and painted}} groups of Gypsies at the Epsom and Ascot racecourses. Knight {{frequently}} {{returned to the}} racecourses and painted {{from the back of}} an antique Rolls-Royce car, which was large enough to accommodate her easel. Often pairs of Gypsy women would pose at {{the open door of the}} Rolls-Royce, with the race-day crowds in the background. From Epsom Knight was invited to the Gypsy settlement at Iver in Buckinghamshire. Knight visited the Iver settlement, <b>normally</b> <b>closed</b> to outsiders, every day for several [...] months in the late 1930s. These visits resulted in a series of portraits of great intensity. Two women, in particular, sat a number of times for Knight, Lilo Smith, the subject of Old Gypsy Women (1938) and Gypsy Splendour (1939), and her daughter-in-law, Beulah. Gypsy Splendour was shown at the Royal Academy in 1939, the year Lilo Smith died.|$|E
2500|$|... {{further south}} is the {{electrically}} operated Shirley Draw Bridge which carries Drawbridge Road over the canal. It is <b>normally</b> <b>closed</b> {{and can be}} opened using a British Waterways key. The northern section also has a swing bridge (no.2, normally left open), a lift bridge (no.28), and another drawbridge (no. 26), all operated manually.|$|E
5000|$|The term girdle, meaning [...] "belt", {{commonly}} {{refers to}} the liturgical attire that <b>normally</b> <b>closes</b> a cassock in many Christian denominations, including the Anglican Communion, Methodist Church and Lutheran Church. The girdle, in the 8th or 9th century, was said to resemble an ancient Levitical Jewish vestment, and in that era, was not visible. In 800 AD, the girdle began to be worn by Christian deacons in the Eastern Church.|$|R
50|$|The avicularium (pl. avicularia) in cheilostome bryozoans is a {{modified}}, non-feeding zooid. The operculum, which <b>normally</b> <b>closes</b> the orifice {{when the}} zooids tentacles are retracted, has been modified {{to become a}} mandible. Strong muscles operate it. The polypide is greatly reduced, and the individual receives nourishment from neighboring zooids. The shape of the avicularian zooid can be identical to the feeding autozooid, but is usually elongated {{in the direction of}} the mandible.|$|R
25|$|The Roman {{consular}} army {{brought together}} both Roman and socii units. For the 250 years between 338 and the Social War, legions were always accompanied by allied alae on campaign. Usually, a consular army would contain {{an equal number}} of legions and alae, although, because of variations {{in the size of the}} respective units, the ratio of socii to Romans in a consular army could vary from 2:1 to 1:1, though it was <b>normally</b> <b>closer</b> to the latter.|$|R
2500|$|In Hong Kong, {{the term}} [...] "bank holiday" [...] is used colloquially {{to refer to}} public holidays, since banks are <b>normally</b> <b>closed</b> on these days, along with {{government}} offices, the legislature, courts, and educational institutions. Hong Kong has maintained a distinction between public holidays and statutory holidays, only the latter of which are mandatory for all employees; {{the number of days}} for the latter is fewer by five days.|$|E
2500|$|The KYZ relay creates pulses. The term KYZ {{refers to}} the contact designations: K for common, Y for Normally Open, and Z for <b>Normally</b> <b>Closed.</b> When {{incorporated}} into an electrical meter, the relay changes state with each rotation (or half rotation) of the meter disc. Each state change is called a [...] "pulse." [...] When connected to external equipment, rate of use (kW) as well as total usage (kWh) can be determined from the rate and quantity of pulses.|$|E
2500|$|During the 2010 Summer Season, work {{continued}} on the Isle of Dogs, recording {{the remains of}} the slipways used during the launch of the SS Great Eastern, the last project of engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel. In July 2010, the TDP team and the FROG worked on the foreshore at the Tower of London, undertaking survey and recording of an area <b>normally</b> <b>closed</b> to the public. Sections of the riverside wall were recorded and data collected to create a contour survey of the foreshore surface.|$|E
5|$|More of a {{traditional}} rivalry due to {{the large amount of}} Kiwi internationals Melbourne has fielded in their history. Matches between the two clubs are <b>normally</b> <b>close</b> and low scoring, with the overall head to head (as of 2016) slightly in Melbourne's favour (37 clashes, Storm 19-Warriors 16 & 2 draws). These two sides played an annual ANZAC Day clash each year between 2009–2014. For 2015 it was played earlier in April before moving back to ANZAC Day for 2016.|$|R
30|$|Feeder {{reconfiguration}} is {{the process}} of changing the distribution network topology by changing the status of its switches. There are two kinds of switches based on their open or <b>close</b> conditions: <b>normally</b> open (N.O.) and <b>normally</b> <b>close</b> (N.C.). N.O. switches are considered as tie switches in the network. During a reconfiguration process, the status of these switches will be changed optimally based on the proposed objective function. Opening and closing of these switches can change the amount of power losses.|$|R

2500|$|A patent foramen ovale (PFO) {{is a small}} {{channel that}} has some hemodynamic consequence; it is a remnant of the fetal foramen ovale, which {{normally}} closes at birth. In medical use, the term [...] "patent" [...] means open or unobstructed. In about 25% of people, the foramen ovale fails to close properly, leaving them with a PFO or at least with what some physicians classify as a [...] "pro-PFO", which is a PFO that is <b>normally</b> <b>closed,</b> but can open under increased blood pressure. On echocardiography, shunting of blood [...] may not be noted except when the patient coughs.|$|E
2500|$|In {{paradoxical}} embolism, {{also known}} as crossed embolism, an embolus from the veins crosses to the arterial blood system. This is generally found only with heart problems such as septal defects [...] (holes in the cardiac septum) between the atria or ventricles. The most common such abnormality is patent foramen ovale, occurring in about 25% of the adult population, but here the defect functions as a valve which is <b>normally</b> <b>closed,</b> because pressure is slightly higher in {{the left side of}} the heart. Sometimes, for example if a patient coughs just when an embolus is passing, it might cross to the arterial system.|$|E
2500|$|The Black Friday September 24 gold crash {{caused the}} United States {{financial}} devastation for months. [...] On Saturday, September 25, Gould, Fisk and Corbin met at Gould's {{office at the}} Opera House with each claiming to be the victim while blaming the other for the disaster. Obligated {{to make good on}} all debts, the Gold Exchange Bank no longer had enough reserves to cover the mounting debts, while the situation there deteriorated by the hour. [...] The Tenth National Bank, which <b>normally</b> <b>closed</b> at 3:00 pm at that hour had depositors and speculators crowding the sidewalk at its front door. The Police set up patrols inside and outside the bank.|$|E
50|$|Public {{offices and}} most private {{businesses}} in Nepal operate {{six days a}} week and only close on Saturdays. International organizations have their own rules, and <b>normally</b> <b>close</b> on Saturdays and Sundays. Government holidays for the upcoming year are published in Nepal Gazette. Nepal celebrates a number of religious and non-religious holidays. On most of these holidays, most government offices and private institutions are closed, although is not mandatory for privately owned businesses to close and international organizations may operate their own calendar.|$|R
5000|$|In the {{development}} of vertebrate animals, during the 6th Carnegie Stage, the proximal part of the notochordal canal persists temporarily as the neurenteric canal (also known as the [...] "axial canal"), which forms a transitory communication between the amniotic sac and the yolk sac cavities. The neurenteric canal is thought {{to play a role}} in the maintenance and adjustment of pressure between the amniotic sac and the yolk sac. When {{the development}} of the notochord is complete, the neurenteric canal <b>normally</b> <b>closes.</b>|$|R
