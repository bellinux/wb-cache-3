5|$|The Irish Republican Army (IRA) {{began to}} re-arm and recruit after August 1969. In December 1969 it split into the Official IRA and the Provisional IRA. Both were {{supported}} {{by the people of}} the Free Derry area. Meanwhile, relations between the British Army and the nationalist community, which were initially good, deteriorated. In July 1971 there was a surge of recruitment into the IRA after two young men were shot and killed by British troops. The government introduced internment on 9 August 1971, and in response, barricades went up once more in the Bogside and Creggan. This time, Free Derry was a <b>no-go</b> <b>area,</b> defended by armed members of both the Official and Provisional IRA. From within the area they launched attacks on the British Army, and the Provisionals began a bombing campaign in the city centre. As before, unarmed 'auxiliaries' manned the barricades, and crime was dealt with by a voluntary body known as the Free Derry Police.|$|E
25|$|The March 2011 {{disaster}} disabled {{the reactor}} cooling systems, leading to releases of radioactivity and triggering a 30km evacuation zone surrounding the plant; the releases continue to this day. On April 20, 2011, the Japanese authorities declared the 20km evacuation zone a <b>no-go</b> <b>area</b> which {{may only be}} entered under government supervision.|$|E
25|$|On 28 March 2012 mayor Toshitsuna Watanabe of {{the town}} Okuma said during {{a meeting of the}} {{municipal}} assembly held at its temporary town office in Aizuwakamatsu that he will ask the whole town to be designated as <b>no-go</b> <b>area,</b> where it is unlikely that residents will be able to return in any foreseeable future, because he did not want the community {{of the town}} divided. Likewise the town Futaba considered refusing any re-designation of the evacuation zones in the town.|$|E

25|$|Glodwick, an area south-central to Oldham {{town had}} become {{increasingly}} ethnically polarised. The area which is predominantly home {{to people of}} Pakistani origin had been for many years a <b>no-go</b> <b>area</b> for local white people for fear of possible attacks, a problem highlighted by a Today report on BBC radio. Although this label was challenged by community leaders as a purely minority view, this negative reputation still held {{at least five years}} after the original disturbances. Similarly, areas of predominantly and polarised white inhabited areas had the same perception of no-go to members of the Asian community. This was increasing tensions, and had been reported by the BBC North West Tonight programme, by social-affairs reporter Dave Guest.|$|E
500|$|The {{increasing}} {{violence in}} Derry and elsewhere led to increasing speculation that internment without trial would be introduced in Northern Ireland, and on 9 August 1971 hundreds of republicans and nationalists {{were arrested in}} dawn raids. [...] In Derry, residents came out onto the streets to resist the arrests, and fewer people were taken there than elsewhere; nevertheless leading figures including Seán Keenan and Johnnie White were interned. [...] In response, barricades were erected once again and the third Free Derry came into existence. [...] Unlike its predecessors, this Free Derry was marked by a strong IRA presence, both Official and Provisional. [...] It was defended by armed paramilitaries—a <b>no-go</b> <b>area,</b> one in which British security forces were unable to operate.|$|E

2500|$|In the 1920s and 1930s {{the first}} council houses {{were built in}} the city, many of them in the Raffles suburb {{to the west of the}} city. Initially Raffles {{contained}} the most sought after housing in the city by council tenants. In the 1990s it became infamous with high crime rates and impoverished living standards. A report from April 1994 in The Independent on Sunday branded the estate a <b>no-go</b> <b>area.</b> One resident was reported to have said [...] "If you've got a problem in Raffles, get a shotgun". The estate was redeveloped in 2004 by replacing some housing.|$|E

5000|$|A 10-minute December 2016 film by FoxNews.coms Ami Horowitz, Stockholm Syndrome, {{focused on}} {{violence}} by Muslim immigrants within Sweden, and included {{an interview with}} two policemen who seemed to confirm that there are <b>no-go</b> <b>areas</b> for police in Sweden. During the interview, one officer states, [...] "If the police is chasing another car {{for some kind of}} crime, if they reach what we call <b>no-go</b> <b>areas,</b> the police wont go after it." [...] The police officers later objected to the interview and said that their quotes had been taken out of context, and a videographer who worked on the film supported the officers account, saying the video was cut together unethically. The documentary gained significant attention several months later when U.S. President Donald Trump indirectly alluded to it in a speech. The film as a whole, and its description of <b>no-go</b> <b>areas,</b> have both been disputed by sources within Sweden; the Swedish The Local quoted a police spokesperson as saying that, though there are areas [...] "characterized by, among other things, the difficulty for the police to fulfill its duty", [...] "There are no guidelines that the police should not visit these areas". The description of no-go zones was also disputed by Felipe Estrada Dörner, a criminology professor at Stockholm University.|$|R
50|$|In November 1945, {{following}} {{a series of}} country wide operations launched by the Haganah a Palestine Police party with police dogs were prevented from entering the kibbutz.

50|$|The Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) were in {{actuality}} <b>no-go</b> <b>areas</b> for the Pakistani authorities, where the Pakistani police could not enter. The situation was changed temporarily with the United States invasion of Afghanistan in 2001, when the Pakistani government {{was supported by}} U.S. military forces. However, the areas reverted again into no-go zones with the 2005 Taliban resurgence. Even today, the FATA region is outside the jurisdiction of Pakistani law.|$|R
50|$|The police {{claimed that}} the Minhaj-ul-Quran {{administration}} had deployed a private militia that was manning the barriers and had effectively converted the residential area into a <b>no-go</b> <b>area.</b> Qadri later said {{that the number of}} arrests was understated by the police as more than 200 of his party workers were missing and unaccounted for.|$|E
5000|$|Five days of rioting {{followed}} his death. Turf Lodge, where McCann lived, was a <b>no-go</b> <b>area</b> and was openly patrolled by an OIRA land rover {{with the words}} [...] "Official IRA - Mobile Patrol" [...] emblazoned on the side. The OIRA shot five British soldiers, killing three, in revenge for McCann's killing, in different incidents the following day in Belfast, Derry and Newry.|$|E
50|$|During the Troubles, {{the term}} was applied to urban areas in Northern Ireland where the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) and British Army could not operate openly. Between 1969 and 1972, Irish nationalist/republican neighborhoods in Belfast and Derry were sealed-off with {{barricades}} by residents. The areas were policed by vigilantes and the Irish Republican Army (IRA) operated openly. The most notable <b>no-go</b> <b>area</b> was Free Derry.|$|E
50|$|By {{the end of}} 1971, 29 {{barricades}} were {{in place}} to block access to what was known as Free Derry; 16 of them impassable even to the British Army's one-ton armoured vehicles. Many of the nationalist <b>no-go</b> <b>areas</b> were controlled {{by one of the}} two factions of the Irish Republican Army, the Provisional IRA and Official IRA. On 29 May 1972, the Official IRA called a ceasefire and vowed that it would not launch attacks except in self-defence.|$|R
50|$|In mid 1972 {{much of the}} Bogside {{was still}} off limits to the {{security}} forces, with barricades preventing their entry and the IRA controlling the <b>area.</b> The <b>no-go</b> <b>areas</b> had been in place since the introduction of internment in August 1971. The British and Northern Irish governments were unwilling to tolerate this, and at 4am on 31 July 1972 a massive British Army mobilisation began. This involved almost 22,000 soldiers, 27 infantry and two armoured battalions aided by 5,300 UDR men. The number of troops was approximately four {{percent of the entire}} strength of the British Army. There were also several Centurion AVREs used, the only time that heavy armoured vehicles were deployed during the Troubles. During the operation two 15-year-old boys were shot and killed. One {{was a member of the}} IRA and bled to death while in the custody of British soldiers; the other was an uninvolved civilian. Neither branch of the IRA attempted to resist the operation as they were outnumbered and outgunned. After this there were no more <b>no-go</b> <b>areas</b> in Northern Irish cities although British patrols remained cautious when in the Bogside.|$|R

Mitchell also wrote the Amnesty International story [...] "Prisoner of Justice" [...] with artist Glenn Fabry. Mitchell partnered Mills {{in the first}} ABC Warriors novel The Medusa War for Black Library based on elements changed or removed from the scripts. According to Mills: ...|$|R
5000|$|Creggan has {{experienced}} a seismic change; long gone are the <b>no-go</b> <b>area</b> and levels of inequality suffered from the 1960s-1980s. It has seen some redevelopment most noticeably with the redevelopment of the Bishop's Field [...] as a sports and recreation area, {{the introduction of a}} play park {{and the development of a}} country park and fishery at the old reservoir sites at the edge of the estate.|$|E

5000|$|Fallujah, {{according}} to reporters who have visited in mid-summer, had since become {{a sort of}} Islamist mini-state, with Sharia law enforced by mujahedin. Owners of shops that sold US-style magazine and barbers who offered [...] "Western-style" [...] haircuts were beaten and publicly humiliated. Inter-faction fighting was also rampant. The Fallujah Brigade was soon marginalized and ceased to be more than another faction in what had effectively become a <b>no-go</b> <b>area</b> for coalition troops.|$|E
2500|$|The Rhodesian army {{continued}} its [...] "mobile counter-offensive" [...] strategy of holding key positions ("vital asset ground") while carrying out raids into the <b>no-go</b> <b>areas</b> and into neighbouring countries. While often extraordinarily successful in inflicting heavy guerrilla casualties, such raids also on occasion {{failed to achieve}} their objectives. In April 1979 special forces carried out a raid on Joshua Nkomo's residence in Lusaka (Zambia) with the stated intention of assassinating him. Nkomo and his family left hastily {{a few hours before}} the raid – having clearly been warned that the raid was coming.|$|R
5000|$|In July 1972, {{he called}} for tough action in Northern Ireland {{to clean up the}} <b>No-Go</b> <b>areas,</b> {{and was one of the}} main {{speakers}} at the Clubs [...] "Halt Immigration Now!" [...] meeting in Westminster Central Hall in September 1972, at the end of which a resolution was passed calling on the government to halt all immigration, repeal the 1968 Race Relations Act, and start a full repatriation scheme. This was delivered to the Prime Minister, Edward Heath, who stated that the government had no intention of repealing the Act.|$|R
5|$|British {{journalist}} David Rose {{writes that}} by 1976 the Farm was already {{seen as a}} sink estate, and by 1980 a Department of the Environment report had suggested demolition, although a regeneration project after the 1985 riots led to improvements. Sir Kenneth Newman, Metropolitan Police commissioner from 1982 to 1987, regarded the estate as one of London's symbolic locations, or potential <b>no-go</b> <b>areas,</b> along with Railton Road in Brixton, All Saints Road in Notting Hill, the Notting Hill Carnival, and the Stonebridge Estate in Harlesden. The 1986 Gifford Inquiry into the rioting criticised the police for having adopted this attitude.|$|R
