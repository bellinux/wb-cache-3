They met in Foz de Iguaçu in November 1990, when they signed the Declaration of Common Nuclear Policy (Declaração de Política Nuclear Comum). The document created the Common System for Accountability and Control (Sistema Comum de Contabilidade e Controle – SCCC), which would coordinate reciprocal inspections of nuclear facilities.

25|$|Iraq was a {{signatory}} to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, placing its reactors under International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards. In October 1981, the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists published {{excerpts from}} the testimony of Roger Richter, a former IAEA inspector who described the weaknesses of the agency's <b>nuclear</b> <b>safeguards</b> to the United States Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Richter testified that only part of Iraq's nuclear installation was under safeguard and that the most sensitive facilities were not even subject to safeguards. IAEA's Director-General Sigvard Eklund issued a rebuttal saying that Richter had never inspected Osirak and had never been assigned to inspect facilities in the Middle East. Eklund claimed that the safeguards procedures were effective {{and that they were}} supplemented by precautionary measures taken by the nuclear suppliers. Anthony Fainberg, a physicist at the Brookhaven National Laboratory, disputed Richter's claim that a fuel processing program for the manufacturing of nuclear weapons could have been conducted secretly. Fainberg wrote that there was barely enough fuel on the site to make one bomb, and that the presence of hundreds of foreign technicians would have made it impossible for the Iraqis to take the necessary steps without being discovered.|$|E

Californian's for <b>Nuclear</b> <b>Safeguards</b> would succeed at placing Proposition 15 on the June 1976 ballot which would ban new facilities and put additional safety requirements on operating reactors. [...] The initiative failed to pass with millions of dollars spent by the nuclear industry to influence the outcome.

Prof [...] He Zuoxiu, who was involved with China's atomic bomb program, has said that plans to expand production of nuclear energy twentyfold by 2030 could be disastrous, as China was seriously underprepared on the safety front. China's fast-expanding nuclear sector is opting for cheap technology that [...] "will be 100 years old by the time dozens of its reactors reach the end of their lifespans", according to diplomatic cables from the US embassy in Beijing. The rush to build new nuclear power plants may [...] "create problems for effective management, operation and regulatory oversight" [...] with the biggest potential bottleneck being human resources – [...] "coming up with enough trained personnel to build and operate all of these new plants, as well as regulate the industry". The challenge for the government and nuclear companies is to [...] "keep an eye on a growing army of contractors and subcontractors who may be tempted to cut corners". [...] China is advised to maintain <b>nuclear</b> <b>safeguards</b> in a business culture where quality and safety are sometimes sacrificed in favor of cost-cutting, profits, and corruption. China has asked for international assistance in training more nuclear power plant inspectors.|$|E

Safeguards are implemented by international and national authorities through an international treaty, while security {{is an important}} national responsibility. At a technical level the synergies between safeguards and security lead to their integration allowing better optimization of the resources and important benefit from exchange of experience and expertise between the two systems. In this paper, we will illustrate this integration process between <b>nuclear</b> security and <b>safeguards.</b> Many examples will be presented such as: non destructive assay (NDA) in <b>nuclear</b> <b>safeguard</b> /detection and identification of illicit nuclear and radioactive materials, destructive analysis (DA) and environmental sampling in nuclear safeguards/ nuclear forensic, use of seals in nuclear security for containers, combined camera and gamma/neutron source for source localisation in luggage, Open source information, export controls are also areas were the integration is possible.

40|$|Understanding the β-decay {{properties}} of fission products {{is very important}} for nuclear reactor monitoring & safety. Indeed, the β-decay of fission products is a source of power during nuclear reactor operation and after, this activity is the main contributor to the decay-heat representing ∼ 7 - 8 % of a reactor nominal power. β-decay is also at the origin of the antineutrinos coming from nuclear reactor. The study of antineutrinos is mandatory for <b>nuclear</b> <b>safeguard</b> policies based on antineutrino detection. But there are still some discrepancies in the calculation of the decay-heat and antineutrino spectra. One reason of the distortions observed seems to be linked to the Pandemonium effect. In order to improve the accuracy in the prediction of these quantities, new measurements of fission products β-decay properties, not sensitive to this effect, have been performed with a Total Absorption spectrometer (TAS). An overview of the TAS technique and first results from the latest experiment will be presented. © 2013 IEEE...|$|R

40|$|The {{maritime}} transport of nuclear materials {{has created a}} conflict between two international law regimes: the United Nations International Law of the Sea, and the developing customary law of the 2 ̆ 7 precautionary principle 2 ̆ 7 in international environmental law.

This review finds the current <b>nuclear</b> <b>safeguard</b> regime does not require shipping states to provide notice to or authorization from transit states.

40|$|Conceiving the {{possibility}} of using plastic scintillator bars as robust detectors for antineutrino detection for the remote reactor monitoring and <b>nuclear</b> <b>safeguard</b> application we study expected basic performance by Monte Carlo simulation. We present preliminary results for a 1 m 3 highly segmented detector made of 100 rectangular scintillation bars forming an array which is sandwiched at both sides by the continuous light guides enabling light sharing between all photo detectors. Light detection efficiency is calculated for several light collection configurations, considering different scintillation block geometries and number of photo-detectors. The photo-detectors signals are forming the specific hit pattern, which is characterizing the impinging particle. The statistical analysis of hit patterns allows effectively select antineutrino events and rejects backgrounds. To evaluate detector sensitivity to fuel isotopic composition evolution during fuel burning cycle we have calculated antineutrino spectra. The statistical analyses of the antineutrino spectra for several dates of fuel burning cycle, folded with 15 % FWHM at 1 MeV energy resolution of the detector, prove {{the possibility}} of proposed detector to measure fuel composition evolution during fuel cycle.

40|$|This paper aims at the {{handling}} {{and treatment of}} <b>nuclear</b> <b>safeguard</b> relevant information by using a linguistic assessment approach.

Accordingly, the aggregation process with the consideration of the different kinds of qualitative criteria is in focus. Especially, the symbolic approach is considered by the direct computation on linguistic values instead of the approximation approach using the associated membership function. In this framework, several kinds of ordinal linguistic aggregation operators are presented and analyzed. The application of these linguistic aggregation operators to the combination of the Physical Model indicator information is provided. An example is given to support and clarify the mathematical formalism...|$|R
