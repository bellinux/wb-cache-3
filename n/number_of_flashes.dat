The radiation is seen by a scintillator device. The radiation is converted into flashes of light. The <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>flashes</b> of light is counted. Radiation that is absorbed by the mass is not seen by the scintillator device. Therefore, the density of the media is inversely proportional to the radiation captured and seen by the scintillator.|$|E

5000|$|A {{ground-based}} lightning network {{must be able}} {{to detect}} a flash with at least three antennas to locate it with an acceptable margin of error. This often leads to the rejection of cloud-to-cloud lightning, as one antenna might detect the position of the flash on the starting cloud and the other antenna the receiving one. As a result, ground-based networks have a tendency to underestimate the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>flashes,</b> especially at the beginning of storms where cloud-to-cloud lightning is prevalent.|$|E
50|$|Many compact cameras, however, {{only have}} a {{built-in}} flash and no hotshoe and no connector for an external flash {{and there is no}} way to suppress the pre-flash. In those instances, slave units are used that are able to skip a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>flashes,</b> thus skipping one or more pre-flashes and only firing simultaneously with the main flash firing. Some modern flash units have this capacity built in. An example at the low end is the Godox 18, a simple flash unit that can be set to skip a max of 3 flashes. A more advanced flash that can set to skip one pre-flash is the popular 'strobist' flash, the Lumopro160. Also, some studio flashes can be set to ignore pre-flash.|$|E

40|$|Flooding {{contributes}} {{to more than}} 100 deaths each year across the United States with most deaths due to flash flooding. Though most flash floods are caused by intense rainfall, the magnitude <b>of</b> a <b>flash</b> flood is dramatically affected by pre-existing physical factors such as ground cover, topography and soil moisture. This study looks at two of these pre-existing physical factors by examining {{the relationship between the}} <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>flash</b> flood events within a county to both the county population density and mean county slope. Results showed that with increasing county population density there is an increase in the average annual <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>flash</b> flood events. With increasing mean county slope there is also an increase in the average annual <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>flash</b> flood events. A composite factor was developed to account for both population density and mean slope together. This factor when compared to the average annual <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>flash</b> flood events indicates that densely populated areas within hilly to high terrain are the most susceptible to flash flooding. It is the hope that these results will highlight hydrologically vulnerable areas that are prone to flash flooding in the southeastern United States. With this improved understanding, National Weather Service (NWS) forecaster situational awareness will increase, leading to more accurate and timely flash flood warnings...|$|R

40|$|AbstractBinding of radioactively-labelled DCMU to spinach {{chloroplast}} membranes {{is determined}} following pre-illumination by single turnover saturating light flashes. When binding is assayed rapidly following inhibitor addition (< 40 s) distinct binary oscillations of [14 C]DCMU binding can be observed. By dark-adapted samples or those, following an even <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>flashes,</b> more inhibitor is bound than after one or an odd <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>flashes.</b> During longer incubation times (2 min), [14 C]DCMU binding becomes independent of flash preillumination. Comparison of the [14 C]DCMU binding kinetics following one flash and the kinetics of the DCMU-induced increase of chlorophyll fluorescence rise reveals {{a substantial amount}} of binding which is not accompanied by a corresponding fluorescence rise.

40|$|Abstract – Severe storms are {{characterized}} by the occurrence of large hail (> 2 cm in diameter), winds of 100 km/h or higher or tornadoes. Although the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>flashes</b> is not used to define a severe storm, most severe storms produce high <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>flashes.</b> Severe storms are of great concern due to their power to cause damage. Unfortunately, however, there is no sufficient knowledge to predict them in most cases. In this paper, it will described a comparative study between two storms {{that occurred in the}} city of São Paulo in 25 February of 2005 between: a local storm in the period from 15 : 10 and 16 : 05 UT and a severe storm in the period from 17 : 30 and 19 : 30 UT. In this preliminary study, some ideas will be presented of how to distinguish local and severe storms in the Southeast Brazil based on lightning data.

40|$|In Experiment 1, pigeons {{were trained}} at a 1 -s dark and a 1 -s houselight {{illuminated}} delay interval {{to discriminate between}} sequences of two and four flashes of light (feeder illumination). These sequences could be discriminated {{on the basis of}} the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>flashes,</b> the number of gaps, or the duration of the gap between flashes. A choose-few bias was obtained at extended dark delays, but no biased forgetting was observed at extended illuminated delays. The pigeons may have confused long dark delays with the longer gaps between flashes on few sample trials. In Experiment 2, additional sample sequences were included which controlled for the gap duration difference between few and many samples. A significant choose-many bias was obtained at extended dark delay intervals, with no biased forgetting found at extended illuminated delays. It appears that pigeons utilize multiple cues to discriminate sequences of light flashes. Experiment 3 had naive pigeons trained to discriminate center key light sequences to determine whether pecking behaviour produced greater control by <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>flashes.</b> No biased forgetting was observed during dark or illuminated delay intervals. It does not appear that pigeons rely on an event switch to count flashes, but utilize multiple features of a sequence to discriminate few from many light flashes...|$|E

Multiple-effect evaporators (MEEs) are common to industries that concentrate different products, regenerate solvents,or separate solid-liquid mixtures. Process integration can help to choose the best configuration of MEE {{in order to achieve}} a more efficient process in the sense of energy use. In present work a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> configurations and difficulties of MEE system such as condensate flashing, vapour bleeding, steam splitting, preheating of liquor using condensate, variable physical properties and boiling point rise are taken into consideration to develop different models of evaporation system. In the present work seven effect evaporator system of typical Indian pulp and paper industry is considered for analysis based on above configurations. These systems is described by a set of nonlinear algebraic equations that include total and solute mass balances, energy balances, heat transfer rate equations and the composition and temperature dependence of relevant thermodynamic properties such as vapour pressures and enthalpies. The models are solved using ‘system of nonlinear equations’. Pinch analysis of the MEE network is also done.

40|$|The blood {{oxygenation}} level-dependent (BOLD) {{response to}} entrained neuronal firing {{in the human}} visual cortex and lateral geniculate nuclei was investigated. Periodic checkerboard flashes at a range of frequencies (4 - 20 Hz) were used to drive the visual cortex neurons into entrained oscillatory firing. This is compared to a checkerboard flashing aperiodically, with the same average <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>flashes</b> per unit time. A magnetoencephalography (MEG) measurement was made {{to confirm that the}} periodic paradigm elicited entrainment. We found that for frequencies of 10 and 15 Hz, the periodic stimulus gave a smaller BOLD response than for the aperiodic stimulus. Detailed investigation at 15 Hz showed that the aperiodic stimulus gave a similar BOLD increase regardless of the magnitude of jitter (+/- 17 ms compared to +/- 33 ms), indicating that flashes need to be precise to at least 17 ms to maintain entrainment. This is also evidence that for aperiodic stimuli, the amplitude of the BOLD response ordinarily reflects the total <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>flashes</b> per unit time, irrespective of the precise spacing between them, suggesting that entrainment is the main cause of the BOLD reduction in the periodic condition. The results indicate that, during entrainment, there is a reduction in the neuronal metabolic demand. We suggest that because of the selective frequency band of this effect, it could be connected to synchronised reverberations around an internal feedback loop...|$|E

40|$|The mode-control {{model of}} {{counting}} and timing (Meek 2 ̆ 6 Church, 1983) suggests that discriminations based on number and {{time may be}} controlled by the same internal clock mechanism. In Experiment 1, two groups of pigeons were initially trained to perform delayed symbolic matching-to-sample (DSMTS) at a 5 s ﬁxed baseline delay, with sample stimuli that consisted of sequences of ﬂashing light. Testing was conducted {{with a range of}} delays (0, 2. 5, 5, 7. 5, and 10 s). In the Number Group, control by number was established by varying the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>ﬂashes</b> while holding time constant.

In Experiment 2, the pigeons received injections of methamphetamine (1. 5 mg/kg) or saline under delay testing conditions identical to Experiment l in an attempt to determine if methamphetamine speeds up the internal clock and if the same theoretical pacemaker mechanism is responsible for memory for time and number. Data from both groups failed to support the notion that an increase in dopamine levels results in an increase in the rate of an internal pacemaker mechanism.
