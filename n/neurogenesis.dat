5|$|Although it was {{originally}} believed that neurons could not regenerate in the adult brain, <b>neurogenesis</b> {{has been shown to}} occur in mammalian brains, including those of primates. However, <b>neurogenesis</b> is limited to the hippocampus and SVZ, and the RMS is one mechanism neurons use to relocate from these areas.|$|E
5|$|Ependymal cells {{actively}} regulate neuronal fate {{specification of}} adult neural precursors through release of Noggin. Beating of the cilia of ependymal cells appears {{to set up}} concentration gradients of guidance molecules, such as cytokines TNF-α (tumor necrosis factor) and IGF-1 (insulin-like growth factor), to direct migration of neuroblasts, {{such as in the}} RMS. Microglia also actively regulate adult <b>neurogenesis.</b> Under basal conditions, apoptotic corpses of newly generated neurons are rapidly phagocytosed from the niche by unactivated microglia in the adult SGZ. Under inflammatory conditions, reactivated microglia can have both beneficial and detrimental effects on different aspects of adult <b>neurogenesis,</b> depending on the balance between secreted molecules with pro- and anti-inflammatory action. In one study, the activation of microglia and recruitment of T cells were suggested to be required for enriched environment-induced SGZ <b>neurogenesis,</b> suggesting a possible role in the RMS.|$|E
5|$|The {{hippocampus}} {{is one of}} the few {{brain regions}} where new neurons are generated. This process of <b>neurogenesis</b> is confined to the dentate gyrus. The production of new neurons can be positively affected by exercise or negatively affected by epileptic seizures.|$|E
5|$|These direct pain inputs, {{as well as}} {{indirect}} inputs, {{are thought}} to induce long-term pain avoidance behavior that results in chronic posture changes and consequently, in functional and anatomical remodeling of vestibular and proprioceptive nuclei. As a result, chronic neuropathic pain can induce macroscopic anatomical remodeling of the hindbrain, including the cerebellum. The magnitude of this remodeling and the induction of neuron progenitor markers suggest the contribution of adult <b>neurogenesis</b> to these changes.|$|E
5|$|In {{humans and}} many other mammals, new neurons are created mainly before birth, and the infant brain {{contains}} substantially more neurons than the adult brain. There are, however, a few areas where new neurons continue to be generated throughout life. The two areas for which adult <b>neurogenesis</b> is well established are the olfactory bulb, which {{is involved in the}} sense of smell, and the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, where there is evidence that the new neurons play a role in storing newly acquired memories. With these exceptions, however, the set of neurons that is present in early childhood is the set that is present for life. Glial cells are different: as with most types of cells in the body, they are generated throughout the lifespan.|$|E
5|$|The {{extent of}} age-related RMS decline in humans {{has been the}} subject of {{significant}} debate. The decline of <b>neurogenesis</b> in and migration from the hippocampus in humans has already been well documented. Furthermore, age-related declines in the activities of SVZ stem cells, which migrate to the OB via the RMS, are in place by middle age in rodents. In elderly mice, studies showed that the population of actively dividing SVZ cells and the rate of interneuron replacement in the OB are both drastically reduced, indicating an age-related decline in neuronal proliferation and migration through the RMS. This decline was shown to be due to neuronal stem cell quiescence in the SVZ even by middle age, and not destruction, much like in the hippocampus.|$|E
5|$|The lipid {{component}} of MFGM {{is rich in}} phospholipids, glycosphingolipids, and cholesterol. Phospholipids make up approximately 30% of the total lipid weight of MFGM, the three most prominent being sphingomyelin (SM), phosphatidylcholine (PC), and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), which together represent up to 85% of total phospholipids. Phospholipids and sphingolipids play central roles in cerebral <b>neurogenesis</b> and migration during fetal development, as well as promoting neuronal growth, differentiation, and synaptogenesis {{during the first year}} of life. Other important polar lipids present in the membrane include the glycerophospholipids phosphatidylserine (PS) and phosphatidylinositol (PI), as well as gangliosides (GG), which are sphingolipids containing sialic acid and an oligosaccharide side chain. Each of these lipid classes is known to play functional roles within the body, including the support of gut, immune, and central nervous system development.|$|E
5|$|HTT is {{expressed}} in all mammalian cells. The highest concentrations {{are found in the}} brain and testes, with moderate amounts in the liver, heart, and lungs. The function of HTT in humans is unclear. It interacts with proteins which are involved in transcription, cell signaling, and intracellular transporting. In animals genetically modified to exhibit HD, several functions of HTT have been found. In these animals, HTT is important for embryonic development, as its absence is related to embryonic death. Caspase, an enzyme which plays a role in catalyzing apoptosis, is thought to be activated by the mutated gene through damaging the ubiquitin-protease system. It also acts as an anti-apoptotic agent preventing programmed cell death and controls the production of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, a protein which protects neurons and regulates their creation during <b>neurogenesis.</b> HTT also facilitates vesicular transport and synaptic transmission and controls neuronal gene transcription. If the expression of HTT is increased and more HTT produced, brain cell survival is improved and the effects of mHTT are reduced, whereas when the expression of HTT is reduced, the resulting characteristics are more typical of the presence of mHTT. In humans the disruption of the normal gene does not cause the disease. It is thought that the disease is not caused by inadequate production of HTT, but by a gain of toxic function of mHTT.|$|E
5|$|The {{research}} Fischbach {{conducted at}} Columbia University stemmed from his previous work at Harvard University, Washington University {{and with the}} National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, National Institute of Health. The specialized focus of his research was on the influence trophic factors could have on the survival of nerve cells and the efficiency of synapses. After his arrival to Columbia, Fischbach {{was focused on the}} expression of neuregulin in regards to neuromuscular synapses, signaling pathways in the brain, transcription factors, as well as work on autism. His research on Neuregulin-1 revealed a possible function in CNS <b>neurogenesis</b> since the neuregulins were labeled throughout proliferation with an anti-MAP2 antibody and an anti-nestin antibody were suggested to have become neuron-restricted progenitors. Some of his other research examined the relationship between neuregulin and expression of myosin heavy chain and transcription factors in human muscle. The research found that treatment including neuregulin increased the number of acetylcholine receptors {{on the surface of the}} myotube as well as an increase in the early growth response family for transcription factors. These findings impact the available knowledge regarding muscle spindle fiber formation, myosin heavy chains development, and the feasibility of mimicking muscle development processes in vitro.|$|E
25|$|The lack of <b>neurogenesis</b> {{has been}} linked to depression. Animals with stress (isolated, {{cortisol}} levels) show a decrease in <b>neurogenesis</b> and antidepressants have been discovered to promote <b>neurogenesis.</b> Rene Hen and his colleagues at Columbia University ran a study on rats in which they blocked <b>neurogenesis</b> by applying radiation to the hippocampal area to test the efficacy of antidepressants. Results suggested that antidepressants failed to work when <b>neurogenesis</b> was inhibited.|$|E
25|$|Interestingly, {{increased}} adult hippocampal place cell <b>neurogenesis</b> {{does not}} necessarily lead to better performance on spatial memory tasks. Just as too little <b>neurogenesis</b> leads to spatial memory deficits, so too does too much <b>neurogenesis.</b> Drugs dealing with improving place cell functioning and increasing the rate of hippocampal <b>neurogenesis</b> should take this balance into account.|$|E
25|$|BDNF: BDNF is {{implicated in}} <b>neurogenesis</b> in the hippocampus, and {{studies suggest that}} {{depressed}} patients have decreased levels of BDNF and reduced hippocampal <b>neurogenesis.</b> It {{is not clear how}} <b>neurogenesis</b> restores mood, as ablation of hippocampal <b>neurogenesis</b> in murine models do not show anxiety related or depression related behaviours. Chronic imipramine administration results in increased histone acetylation (which is associated with transcriptional activation and decondensed chromatin) at the hippocampal BDNF promotor, and also reduced expression of hippocampal HDAC5.|$|E
25|$|Decreased hippocampal <b>neurogenesis</b> is a {{characteristic}} of aging. Environmental enrichment increases <b>neurogenesis</b> in aged rodents by potentiating neuronal differentiation and new cell survival. As a result, subjects exposed to environmental enrichment aged better due to superior ability in retaining their levels of spatial and learning memory.|$|E
25|$|Hippocampal <b>neurogenesis</b> {{has also}} been {{demonstrated}} in rats subjected to intermittent hypoxia. This <b>neurogenesis</b> has shown related cognitive improvements such as enhanced learning and memory as well as overall increases in spatial cognitive ability. Additionally, antidepressant-like effects are exhibited in rats undergoing such treatment.|$|E
25|$|Neural {{injections}} of Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) {{were applied to}} males of both groups to test for <b>neurogenesis.</b> Analysis showed that testosterone and dihydrotestosterone regulated adult hippocampal <b>neurogenesis</b> (AHN). Adult hippocampal <b>neurogenesis</b> was regulated through the androgen receptor in the wild-type male rats, {{but not in the}} TMF male rats. To further test the role of activated androgen receptors on AHN, flutamide, an antiandrogen drug that competes with testosterone and dihydrotestosterone for androgen receptors, and dihydrotestosterone were administered to normal male rats. Dihydrotestosterone increased the number of BrdU cells, while flutamide inhibited these cells.|$|E
25|$|Proneural genes promote <b>neurogenesis</b> and inhibit gliogenesis {{but some}} neurogenic factors can {{regulate}} {{both of these}} processes, depending on the proneural genes concentration. For example, BMPs (Bone Morphogenetic Proteins) promote <b>neurogenesis</b> in progenitors that express high levels of Neurogenin-1 and gliogenesis in progenitors that express low levels of Neurogenin-1.|$|E
25|$|Aldosterone, {{probably}} acting through mineralocorticoid receptors, may positively influence <b>neurogenesis</b> in the dentate gyrus.|$|E
25|$|Bone {{morphogenetic}} proteins {{cause the}} transcription of mRNAs involved in osteogenesis, <b>neurogenesis,</b> and ventral mesoderm specification.|$|E
25|$|Evidence from <b>neurogenesis</b> (formation of new neurons) {{studies on}} male rats {{has shown that}} the {{hippocampus}} is a useful brain region to examine when determining the effects of androgens on behavior. To examine <b>neurogenesis,</b> wild-type male rats were compared with male rats that had testicular feminization mutation (TMF), a genetic disorder resulting in complete or partial insensitivity to androgens and a lack of external male genitalia.|$|E
25|$|The {{existence}} {{of stem cells}} in the adult brain has been postulated following the discovery {{that the process of}} <b>neurogenesis,</b> the birth of new neurons, continues into adulthood in rats. The presence of stem cells in the mature primate brain was first reported in 1967. It has since been shown that new neurons are generated in adult mice, songbirds and primates, including humans. Normally, adult <b>neurogenesis</b> is restricted to two areas of the brain – the subventricular zone, which lines the lateral ventricles, and the dentate gyrus of the hippocampal formation. Although the generation of new neurons in the hippocampus is well established, the presence of true self-renewing stem cells there has been debated. Under certain circumstances, such as following tissue damage in ischemia, <b>neurogenesis</b> can be induced in other brain regions, including the neocortex.|$|E
25|$|Temporal lobe {{epilepsy}} {{is characterized}} by a high number of Cajal–Retzius cells in adult life, which supposedly causes continuous <b>neurogenesis</b> and migration, thus causing the seizures that characterize this disorder.|$|E
25|$|Notch {{signaling}} promotes proliferative signaling during <b>neurogenesis,</b> and its {{activity is}} inhibited by Numb to promote neural differentiation. It {{plays a major}} role in the regulation of embryonic development.|$|E
25|$|Research {{developed}} by the Beckley Foundation suggests ayahuasca intake can lead to significant increases in mindfulness abilities and that ayahuasca can promote <b>neurogenesis</b> (the growth of new brain cells) in vitro.|$|E
25|$|Again BrdU was {{injected}} into {{both groups of}} rats {{in order to see}} if cells were multiplying in the living tissue. These results demonstrate how the organization of androgens has a positive effect on preadolescent hippocampal <b>neurogenesis</b> that may be linked with lower depression-like symptoms.|$|E
25|$|Fully {{differentiated}} neurons are permanently postmitotic; however, research starting around 2002 {{shows that}} additional neurons throughout the brain can originate from neural stem cells {{through the process}} of <b>neurogenesis.</b> These are found throughout the brain, but are particularly concentrated in the subventricular zone and subgranular zone.|$|E
25|$|Other actions include {{contributing}} to pulmonary surfactant {{synthesis of the}} fetal lungs {{at the end of}} the pregnancy and immune tolerance of the fetus by the maternal organism during pregnancy. Prolactin delays hair regrowth in mice. Prolactin promotes <b>neurogenesis</b> in maternal and fetal brains.|$|E
25|$|Proneural {{proteins}} bind DNA as heterodimeric complexes {{that are}} formed by bHLH proteins or E proteins. Because heterodimerization {{is a prerequisite}} for DNA binding, factors that interfere with dimerization effectively act as passive repressors of proneural gene activity. Proneural proteins specifically bind DNA sequences that contain a core hexanucleotide motif, CANNTG, known as an E-box. The basic region and helix 1 of the bHLH domain form a long alpha-helix that is connected with the loop region to helix 2. Direct contacts between bHLH residues and DNA are responsible for the common ability of neural bHLH proteins to bind to the core E-boxsequence. The cells within a cluster that express a proneural gene (called a proneural cluster) {{can be thought of as}} cells of an equivalence group. Within a proneural cluster, the cells compete with each other, such that only a subset of cells is singled out to develop into neuronal precursors. This singling out process is mediated by cell-cell interactions interpreted through the action of neurogenic genes. In neuroectoderm, neurogenic genes are required to single out cells from within proneural clusters to form neuronal precursors, leaving the remaining cells of proneural clusters to develop into epidermal cells. Proneural genes may function in analogous fashions in vertebrates and invertebrates, specifically they were implicated in early <b>neurogenesis.</b> Although proneural proteins are responsible for trigger <b>neurogenesis,</b> different proteins are required for different neural and/or glial cell types. This implies that each of these proteins is capable of regulating both common target genes for <b>neurogenesis</b> and unique target genes for neuronal subtype characteristics. Proneural bHLH transcription factors, not only drive <b>neurogenesis</b> by activating the expression of a cascade of neuronal genes, but they inhibit the expression of glial genes. Neural bHLH genes have different functions depending on: the sensitivity to lateral inhibition, which determines if a cell becomes epidermal or neuronal, and whether the gene is expressed in the CNS before or after the terminal mitosis.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} that <b>neurogenesis</b> can sometimes occur in the adult vertebrate brain, a finding that led to controversy in 1999. Later studies {{of the age of}} human neurons suggest that this process occurs only for a minority of cells, and a vast majority of neurons comprising the neocortex were formed before birth and persist without replacement.|$|E
25|$|Exposure to an enriched environment, {{defined as}} a {{combination}} of more opportunities for physical activity, learning and social interaction, may produce structural and functional changes {{in the brain and}} influence the rate of <b>neurogenesis</b> in adult and senescent animal model hippocampi. Interestingly, many of these changes can be effected merely by introducing a physical exercise regimen rather than requiring cognitive activity per se.|$|E
25|$|Although <b>neurogenesis</b> and sex {{determination}} {{appear to be}} different biological processes, {{there is evidence that}} ‘’daughterless (da’’) - an essential gene for the formation of the entire Drosophila peripheral nervous system - is also required for proper {{sex determination}}. In flies, scute works to direct neuronal development, but this gene also acquired a role in the primary event of sex determination – X chromosome counting – by becoming an X chromosome signal element (XSE).|$|E
25|$|Social {{isolation}} has a hindering {{effect in}} AHN whereas normal regulation of androgens increases AHN. A study using male rats showed that testosterone may block social isolation, {{which results in}} hippocampal <b>neurogenesis</b> reaching homeostasis—regulation that keeps internal conditions stable. A Brdu analysis showed that excess testosterone did not increase this blocking effect against social isolation; that is, the natural circulating levels of androgens cancel out {{the negative effects of}} social isolation on AHN.|$|E
25|$|Pur-alpha (purα) is a sequence-specific {{single-stranded}} DNA and RNA-binding protein. Studies {{have shown}} that the protein is primarily active during early development and is believed to have a role in brain enlargement. Although the exact function is still controversial, it is believed that pur-alpha is responsible for neuronal proliferation during <b>neurogenesis</b> as well as the maturation of dendrites. Thus, pur-alpha is also considered a potential root cause of megalencephaly and brain overgrowth.|$|E
25|$|Researchers do {{not agree}} about how long episodic {{memories}} are stored in the hippocampus. Some researchers believe that episodic memories always rely on the hippocampus. Others believe the hippocampus only stores episodic memories for a short time, after which the memories are consolidated to the neocortex. The latter view is strengthened by recent evidence that <b>neurogenesis</b> in the adult hippocampus may ease the removal of old memories and increase the efficiency of forming new memories.|$|E
25|$|In {{central nervous}} system not all bHLH genes are {{involved}} in <b>neurogenesis</b> because NeuroD and ‘’Math3/NeuroM’’ families are also involved in the neuronal-versus-glial cell fate decision. Another pro-neural family (which includes ‘’math1’’ and ‘’math5’’) {{is essential to the}} development of a small number of neural lineages whereas ‘’math1’’ have also a role in the specification interneuron identity. Cell types that depend on ‘’math1’’ expression belong to the proprioceptive sensory pathway. Bertrand et al. (2002) have confirmed the proneural activity of ‘’mash1’’, ngn1 and ngn2, and possibly math1 and ‘’math5’’ in the mouse. <b>Neurogenesis</b> in the {{central nervous system}} depends on proneural gene inhibition by Notch signaling pathway and the absence of this key regulator results in the premature differentiation of neurons. To maintain neural progenitor cells a regulatory loop takes place between neighboring cells, that involves the lateral inhibition process (see lateral inhibition). In the absence of Lateral inhibition some proneural genes such as ASCL1 or ‘’neuroG’’ are capable of inducing the expression of neuron-specific genes leading to the premature formation of early born-neurons. Ratié and colleagues (2013) comprised that Notch proneural gene network have an important role in cell fate renewal and transition in the mouse.|$|E
25|$|In most cases, neurons are {{generated}} by special types of stem cells. Neurons {{in the adult}} brain generally do not undergo cell division. Astrocytes are star-shaped glial cells that have also been observed to turn into neurons {{by virtue of the}} stem cell characteristic pluripotency. <b>Neurogenesis</b> largely ceases during adulthood in most areas of the brain. However, there is strong evidence for generation of substantial numbers of new neurons in two brain areas, the hippocampus and olfactory bulb.|$|E
25|$|The Princeton University Department of Psychology, {{located in}} Peretsman-Scully Hall, is an {{academic}} department of Princeton University in Princeton, New Jersey. For over a century, {{the department has}} been one of the most notable psychology departments in the country. It has been home to psychologists who have made well-known scientific discoveries in the fields of psychology and neuroscience (e.g., adult <b>neurogenesis</b> in primate brains, cognitive miser, bystander non-intervention, face-selective neurons in primate brains, feature integration theory, mental models theory, prospect theory).|$|E
