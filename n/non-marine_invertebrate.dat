40|$|Aim  To {{identify}} Antarctic palaeoendemic taxa {{and their}} probable glacial refugia from regional groups of endemic species records. Location  Antarctica. Methods  We {{compiled a list}} of Antarctic <b>non-marine</b> <b>invertebrates</b> from published literature, and then deleted all records relating to non-endemic, zoochoric (phoretic and parasitic), marine and partially identified species to leave only the elements endemic to Antarctica. We then used cluster analysis and principal components analysis to identify regional groupings within this endemic fauna. Results  Some 170 + of the reported 520 + Antarctic invertebrates are free-living and endemic, but only nine of these are pan-Antarctic, with the majority having either ‘continental’/eastern or ‘maritime’/western distributions. Main conclusions  All invertebrates endemic to continental Antarctica are confined to, or found adjacent to, ice-free palaeorefugial mountains, nunataks and coastal exposures. By contrast, only one maritime Antarctic palaeorefugium has been identified, and most endemic taxa are currently associated with coastal lowland neorefugia. We suggest which regions of Antarctica (1) are likely to be refugial, and (2) simply require more data in order that the nature and origin of their fauna can be elucidated...|$|R
40|$|Australian plesiosaur remains {{are common}} {{although}} currently poorly documented. At present, {{most of the}} described material is derived from extensive Early Cretaceous epicontinental marine rocks in central and northeastern Australia (Kear, 2003). In recent years, however, a number of fragmentary specimens have been recovered from Lower Cretaceous non-marine sequences in the southeastern part of the continent (Fig. 1). The fossil-producing strata are included within the middle Valanginian– early Albian Wonthaggi (Gippsland Basin) and Eumeralla (Otway Basin) formations, southern Victoria, and early–middle Albian Griman Creek Formation (Surat Basin), Lightning Ridge, New South Wales/ Surat region, Queensland. Interestingly, these units were deposited in an Early Cretaceous high-latitude zone (60 – 80 º S), subject to highly seasonal, cool to cold conditions and months of winter darkness near the southern pole. Fossils recorded include a diverse range of freshwater/ terrestrial vertebrates, <b>non-marine</b> <b>invertebrates,</b> and plants (see Dettmann et al., 1992 for summary). Although several previous reports have mentioned plesiosaur material from southeastern Australia (e. g. Rich et al., 1988; Rich and Rich, 1989; Vickers-Rich, 1996; Smith, 1999; Rich and Vickers-Rich, 2000; Kear, 2003), none of the remains have yet been described. It is therefore, {{the purpose of this}} paper to present an up-to-date summary of the existing specimens (Table 1) and assess their taxonomic and paleoecological implications...|$|R
