However, the heritages of the problems under the MPS, together with the emerging new types of institutional units, new sources of income and market-driven new services, have made the transition difficult.

Third, indirect macroeconomic measurements are drawn from discrepancies on the market for goods and services on the money market and on the labour market, whereas the DYMIMIC (dynamic multiple indicators-multiple causes) method carves the trends of the shadow economy (hereafter SE).

40|$|We {{contribute}} to the debate on how to assess {{the size of the}} underground (or shadow) economy by proposing a reinterpretation of the traditional Currency Demand Approach (CDA) à la Tanzi. In particular, we introduce three main innovations. First, we take a direct measure of the value of cash transactions-the flow of cash withdrawn from bank accounts relative to total non-cash payments-as the dependent variable in the money demand equation. This allows us to avoid unrealistic assumptions on the velocity of money and the absence of any irregular transaction in a given year, overcoming two severe critiques to the traditional CDA. Second, in place of the tax burden level, usually intended as the main motivation for non-compliance, we include among the covariates two direct indicators of detected tax evasion. Finally, we control also for the role of illegal production considering crimes like drug dealing and prostitution, which-jointly with the shadow economy-contributes to the larger aggregate of the <b>non-observed</b> <b>economy</b> and represents a significant component of total cash payments. We propose then an application of this "modified CDA" to a panel of 91 Italian provinces for the years 2005 - 08...|$|E
40|$|The <b>Non-Observed</b> <b>Economy</b> (noe) is a {{convenient}} typology covering the whole spectrum of unrecorded household and market output (moonlighting, fraud on taxes {{and social security}} contributions, criminal activities). Macroeconomic estimates of such activities in terms of gdp proceed from various methods, which {{are more or less}} biased and do not match. Direct approaches are based on tax audits and informal employment surveys. Indirect measurements are issued from discrepancies on the commodity market (Income and Expenditure from National Accounts), on the money market (currency demand, transactions) and on the labour market (implicit labour supply), as well as from dynamic multi-variables modelling. According to estimates, the size of noe varies across European Union countries ?

The review shows that institutional habits (corruption, going right) in regulation created transaction costs and force small businesses to take refuge in the informal sector. A regression model shows {{that the quality of}} justice (as measured by this indicator of Rule of Law of the World Bank) is a determining variable in explaining the weight of the <b>non-observed</b> <b>economy</b> and hence the informal sector in GDP official. The dynamics of micro-enterprises is approached from 2 surveys (2001 and 2005) on the same sample. The analysis of mobility through transition matrices reveals the existence of three thresholds (1 employee, 2 - 5 employees, 6 - 9 employees and 10 employees and more) and not only one single threshold, albeit it confirms the thesis of «missing-middle». The discriminating factor analysis indicates that the law is a crucial variable that explains the apparent blocking of micro-enterprises beyond 6 to 9 employees. Finally, the 2007 survey on the money transfer activities (hawalas) shows that these institutions {{have a significant impact on}} the macroeconomic level and suggests that their usefulness and specificity should be taken into account in order to integrate this banking device within the formal financial system. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{task of the}} Sub-committee was {{to review}} the {{existing}} methodologies for estimating the contribution of unorganised/informal sector to GDP and suggest measures to facilitate direct estimation.

Given the existing data systems in the country, it is not found feasible to use the 'Labour Input Method' unless substantial improvements {{are made in the}} statistical system of the country. Though, it would be necessary to introduce such improvements in the statistical system, realistic estimates need to be generated in the interim-period. The Sub-committee, thus, developed an alternative method of apportioning by using estimates of labour inputs and productivity differentials of both the organised and unorganised sectors. According to the estimates worked out by the Sub-committee by using the modified apportioning method, about 50 percent of the GDP was contributed by the unorganised/informal sector in 2004 - 05.

40|$|Executive summary: This paper {{reports the}} {{economic}} activity of sex workers for its inclusion into {{gross domestic product}} (GDP) for the UK National Accounts. Markets in consenting but nonetheless illicit activities, including commercial sexual activity and drugs, were incorporated into figures for the UK National Accounts {{for the first time}} in 2014. This was to ensure comparability of the Gross National Income (GNI) measurements across EU countries. We evaluate the methods and data used to calculate prostitution in the first ONS (2014) analysis and explore the constraints and limitations in the calculation of prostitution data. We provide an updated figure for the number of sex workers using monitoring data from NHS specialist services and a using a standard methodology that has been employed by HIV prevention organisations across Europe to supply estimates of the number of sex workers in the UK as well as income and expenditure in various sex work markets in which both parties are voluntary participants. The London and regional markets are sectored separately to take account of the denser market in the capital, and to reflect the composition and differential pricing and working practices of sex workers in different sectors based on location and gender. Trying to estimate informal covert markets and activities presents an immense methodological challenge. Not surprisingly there have been few attempts to estimate this hidden part of the UK economy in the peer-reviewed literature or from quality sources. To date only Kinnell (1999), and Cusick, Kinnell, Brooks-Gordon and Campbell (2009) have attempted it in the UK. There remain significant limitations and levels of uncertainty, but we provide a model that is based on primary and secondary data from national and regional governmental and NGO services, to develop a model of the <b>non-observed</b> <b>economy</b> (NOE) which is scalable, simple, and with more explanatory power than previous attempts, to create a framework for the future calculation of this activity in the UK National Accounts...|$|E
40|$|This book {{constitutes}} a follow-up and extension of Employment in Poland 2005. In this issue we analyse {{the influence of}} demand-side factors on Polish labour market and especially so from the macroeconomic and regional perspectives. We begin with macroeconomic look at the labour markets in eight – out of ten – states which joined the EU in 2004. We focus on identifying aggregate disturbances which had a crucial influence on the economic fluctuations within the CEE region in the period 1994 - 2005, and we assess to what extent these disturbances are responsible for different dynamics of unemployment and employment trends in the examined countries {{and to what extent}} different fiscal and monetary approaches adopted at that time contributed to remedy these disturbances. The key finding resulting is that the relatively most significant decrease in employment and increase in unemployment levels in Europe, which came about in Poland after the year 2000, are due to the idiosyncratic decrease in return on capital and total factor productivity [TFP] dynamics. We also find that, although the policy-mix adopted in the above period was not the direct cause for the slowdown, its role in accommodating the shock was probably moderately negative. Then we study regional differences in the labour market in Poland in the period 2000 - 2005. We analyse aggregate data and identify microeconomic factors affecting trends in job creation and destruction. We group the NUTS 4 regions in Poland in six homogenous clusters and find that in the period 2000 - 2005 no significant changes in the labour market indicators occurred either between clusters or between voivodeships (NUTS 2 regions). This is so because the direction and depth of fluctuations on the regional scale were generally shaped by aggregate shocks which affected the economy as a whole. Moreover, the above period saw a greater differentiation in terms of productivity and thus, in most parts of Poland, increasing employment and unemployment rates are due to the development of labour-intensive manufacturing. We argue that only the largest urban conglomerations in Poland have adopted the development model which supports high economic growth in medium and long term. In third part of the study we focus on spatial mobility of Polish workers. In case of both internal and international migrations we demonstrate that economic factors determine significantly decisions about changing place of residence and that the key incentive to migrate is higher wages in the destination location and a relatively worse situation in the labour market in the region of origin. We also estimate the scale of international migration from Poland, which indicate that {{the number of people who}} stayed abroad for more than two months in the year 2005 was higher by approximately 165, 000 - 379, 000 people than before EU accession, due to one-time increase in migration flows. Moreover, we point out that international migration is mostly seasonal and that emigrants retain strong ties with their homeland. As for internal migration, we argue that its aggregate intensity is relatively modest and we emphasise that although in general the population moves from smaller to larger conglomerates, the limited scale of these movements makes the progress in urbanisation being slow and agglomerations less numerous than in other EU member states. In the long run, this may constitute an obstacle for real convergence to the most developed EU countries. Finally we scrutinize work in the <b>non-observed</b> <b>economy</b> (NOE) in Poland. According to various methodologies we asses the NOE output at 15 - 30 per cent of the GDP, and we find that the main reasons behind the existence of the grey economy in Poland are overly burdensome fiscal policy and excessively restrictive economic regulations. We close the report with demonstrating links between areas we studied and implications for labour market and economic policy in Poland. ...|$|E
40|$|SummaryThe <b>Non–observed</b> <b>economy</b> (NOE) {{refers to}} {{economic}} transactions that are {{missing from the}} national accounts because the transactions are "underground, illegal, informal, contribute to production for own use or are missed". This information paper reviews the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) methodologies used to estimate the transaction activity in the NOE. These estimates {{can be used to}} adjust Gross Domestic Product (GDP) to allow for the NOE. By its very nature, the NOE cannot be directly measured, or it can be very expensive to attempt this measurement. Therefore, estimates of NOE activity must rely on limited indicative information and a variety of indirect methods – all of which can be regarded as contentious. It is likely that an unknown proportion of underground production is already captured in the observable data, owing to the data sources used and the estimation methods employed in collecting the observable data. Given this, the review:confirms that current adjustments to GDP for underground production and informal production are appropriate. confirms that GDP {{does not need to be}} adjusted for the statistical underground. demonstrates that not adjusting for illegal production due to the absence of regular and reliable data does not significantly understate GDP. identifies that additional up–to–date data are required to better estimate household production for own use, but there are no plans to update the data given the cost and the relative priority of this in an environment of limited resources. The paper addresses five components of the NOE:underground production or "the cash economy" involving deliberate concealment of legal activities to avoid tax payments; illegal production covering activities forbidden by law where there is mutual consent (e. g. illegal drug production); informal production broadly characterised as consisting of units engaged in the production of goods or services with the primary objective of generating employment and incomes to the persons concerned; household production for own final use including production of goods such as crops, livestock and construction of owner–built houses, and excludes all domestic services except for owner occupied housing; and the statistical underground including production missed due to deficiencies in data collection e. g. under coverage of enterprises, non–response, under reporting. Using the approaches outlined in this paper, the analysis indicates that the combined adjustments to the official GDP estimates for the five components of the NOE are unlikely to be greater than 3 % in total, and are unlikely to contribute significantly to changes in growth rates. Individually, the GDP adjustments attributed to these components are as follows:Underground production includes upwards adjustments of 1. 5 % to GDP. Illegal production is not currently accounted for in GDP due to the difficulty in identifying and valuing illegal transactions. No adjustment is made. However, an experimental series has been developed for this information paper that estimates illegal drug production at 0. 4 % of GDP. Informal production is not believed to be material in Australia, and no adjustments are made, or will be made, to GDP. Household production for own final use is included in GDP through a minor adjustment of 0. 2 % of GDP to cover home grown crops, owner self–construction of dwellings and in–home services. The Statistical underground is not subject to explicit adjustments. ABS data sources are subject to a quality assurance process that: closely monitors and adjusts the data sampling and collection frames, employs a rigorous follow–up of survey and data collection non–responses, and subjects all data responses to validation checks to ensure the correctness and consistency of data. The ABS estimates of NOE contained in this paper are much lower than some third party estimates. For example, a 2010 World Bank model estimates the Australian underground production at 14 % of GDP. The ABS does not support the methodology, assumptions and analysis of the model used in the World Bank estimate. Estimates of the order of 15 % of GDP for the underground production are considered to be implausible. In particular, an increase of this order of magnitude is difficult to reconcile with independently observed measures of GDP for production and expenditure. Also, Australian Taxation Office audits of the goods and services tax (GST) returns indicate a high level of reporting and payment compliance...|$|E
