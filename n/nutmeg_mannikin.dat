40|$|When {{foraging}} group sizes increase, animals generally {{decrease the}} {{time devoted to}} antipredator detection and increase their foraging rate, the commonly reported group size effect. The increased foraging rate is thought to follow from increased safety from predators because as group size increases, more eyes are available to detect predators {{and the risk of}} being a predator's victim is diluted. This increased safety then allows higher feeding rates because individuals can reallocate time spent in vigilance to foraging. However, increased foraging rates can also be due to increased competition for resources as the number of companions increases. We tested whether increased feeding rates are the product of competition or antipredation when group size increases in <b>nutmeg</b> <b>mannikins</b> (Lonchura punctulata). We used edited video playbacks to change group size and type of competitor: vigilant only, feeding only, and controls. We found that the increased feeding rate associated with an increased group size only resulted when the companions were feeding. Video playbacks of nonforaging companions neither decreased an individual's use of vigilance while handling food nor did it release the full increase of feeding rate. Focal birds lowered their scanning time while feeding as the frequency of pecking by simulated nonvigilant companions increased. We conclude that the group size effect reported in <b>nutmeg</b> <b>mannikins</b> is not a product of safety benefits of group living but may also arise from the costs imposed by competition for resources.

40|$|When {{engaged in}} {{behavioural}} games, animals can adjust {{their use of}} alternative tactics until groups reach stable equilibria. Recent theory on behavioural plasticity in games predicts that individuals should differ in their plasticity or responsiveness and hence in their degree of behavioural adjustment. Moreover, individuals are predicted to be consistent in their plasticity within and across biological contexts. These predictions {{have yet to be}} tested empirically and so we examine the behavioural adjustment of individual <b>nutmeg</b> <b>mannikins</b> (Lonchura punctulata), gregarious ground-feeding passerines, when playing two different social foraging games: producer–scrounger (PS) and patch-choice (PC) games. We found: (i) significant individual differences in plasticity and sampling behaviour in each of the two games, (ii) individual differences in sampling behaviour were consistent over different test conditions within a game (PC) and over a six month period (PS), (iii) but neither individual plasticity nor sampling behaviour was correlated from one social foraging game to another. The rate at which birds sampled alternative tactics was positively associated with seed intake in PS trials but negatively associated in PC trials. These results suggest that games with frequency dependence of pay-offs can maintain differences in behavioural plasticity but that an important component of this plasticity is group- and/or context-specific...|$|R
40|$|When {{group size}} increases, animals {{from a wide}} range of taxa reduce {{vigilance}} and increase feeding rate, the so-called group size effect. This effect requires that group members display plastic behavioral responses both in terms of vigilance and foraging to obtain the security benefit from grouping and/or to cope with feeding competition. Most studies on group size effects have reported mean group changes in behavior. However, individuals' adjustment of behavior and thus their individual contribution to the overall group-level plasticity remain unexplored. Using wild-caught <b>nutmeg</b> <b>mannikins</b> (Lonchura punctulata), small estrildid finches known to exhibit the group size effect, we investigated individual differences in baseline levels and in plasticity of vigilance and feeding behavior. We experimentally manipulated the number of companions foraging with focal birds and noted how they individually adjusted their vigilance and foraging behavior when group size varied. We found that individuals differed consistently in their vigilance level and foraging rate but not in their ability to adjust to experimental variation in group size. Effect sizes for individual consistency in behavior were as large as those for group-level plasticity. Our results reveal high, albeit not maximal, levels of plasticity in both vigilance and feeding behavior for all individuals in this social foraging context.

40|$|Research {{on social}} {{learning}} has focused traditionally on whether animals possess the cognitive {{ability to learn}} novel motor patterns from tutors. More recently, social learning has included the use of others as sources of inadvertent social information. This type of social learning seems more taxonomically widespread and its use can more readily be approached as an economic decision. Social sampling information, however, can be tricky to use and calls for a more lucid appraisal of its costs. In this four-part review, we address these costs. Firstly, we address the possibility that {{only a fraction of}} group members are actually providing social information at any one time. Secondly, we review experimental research which shows that animals are circumspect about social information use. Thirdly, we consider the cases where social information can lead to incorrect decisions and finally, we review studies investigating the effect of social information quality. We address the possibility that using social information or not is not a binary decision and present results of a study showing that <b>nutmeg</b> <b>mannikins</b> combine both sources of information, a condition that can lead to the establishment of informational cascades. We discuss the importance of empirically investigating the economics of social information use...|$|R
40|$|Animals sample their {{surrounding}} environment to collect information, {{which can be}} obtained personally or by tracking the behavior of others (i. e., social information). Although social information appears to be generally advantageous, {{it can also be}} detrimental and may even conflict with personal information. We tested the effect that the strength of social information, and ultimately its persuasiveness, can have on an animal's decision to use it or not by conducting an experiment using single <b>nutmeg</b> <b>mannikins</b> (Lonchura punctulata), which were offered a foraging choice after observation of videos of feeding or nonfeeding conspecifics. The persuasiveness of social information was amplified by increasing the number and changing the behavior of conspecifics that had previously been seen feeding at 1 of 2 feeders. In addition, we modulated the certainty of an individual's personal information. Some birds had prior experience of a marked feeder always containing easily accessible food, whereas other birds experienced that this was only the case in half of the trials. Our results show that animals provided with sufficiently persuasive social information will tend to reduce the weight of even highly reliable personal information. This provides the first experimental evidence consistent with the propagation of informational cascades in nonhuman animals, which have been invoked to explain market crashes in economics or panic rushes in human crowds.

40|$|Animals {{that feed}} {{socially}} {{may benefit from}} the presence of others without necessarily improving their feeding rates. Feeding rates may actually decrease {{in the presence of}} others due to different forms of competition and interference (kleptoparasitism, aggression). Recent work with starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) shows that social foragers may also experience self-imposed costs to their feeding rates in order to remain in the presence of group members, despite a lack of physical interaction or overt aggression. I studied whether <b>nutmeg</b> <b>mannikins</b> (Lonchura punctulata) feeding from depletable patches alone or with a heterospecific or conspecific flock in a separate cage adjacent to the food patch experience such self-imposed feeding costs. The birds experienced self-imposed changes to their foraging behaviour which led to decreased feeding rates. Subjects fed more slowly in treatments with conspecifics despite travelling more quickly between patches. The decrease occurred because they spent more time idle near the flock instead of feeding from the patch or immediately travelling to the next one. This seems to be a cost related to the maintenance of group cohesion. The birds also reduced their scanning time and rate near conspecifics without experiencing a concomitant increase in feeding rate consistent with the group-size effect. This result may point to a form of interference usually attributed to reduced quality of or access to the food resource caused by group members...|$|R
50|$|Normally, gaining {{information}} from watching other organisms allows the observer {{to make good}} decisions without spending effort. More specifically, birds often observe the behavior of other organisms to gain valuable information, such {{as the presence of}} predators, good breeding sites, and optimal feeding spots. Although this allows the observer to spend less effort gathering information, it can also lead to bad decisions if the information gained from observing is unreliable. In the case of the nutmeg mannikins, the observer can minimize the time spent looking for an optimal feeder and maximize its feeding time by watching where other nutmeg mannikins feed. However, this relies {{on the assumption that the}} observed mannikins also had reliable information that indicated the feeding spot was an ideal one. This behavior can become maladaptive when prioritizing information gained from watching others leads to information cascades, where birds follow the rest of the crowd even though prior experience may have suggested that the decision of the crowd is a poor one. For instance, if a <b>nutmeg</b> <b>mannikin</b> sees enough mannikins feeding at a feeder, nutmeg mannikins have been shown to choose that feeder even if their personal experience indicates that the feeder is a poor one.|$|E
40|$|At least 10 {{species of}} parrots (Family Psittacidae), {{along with the}} Eurasian Collared-Dove (Columbidae: Streptopelia decaocto), Orange [Northern Red] Bishop (Ploceidae: Euplectes frandscanus), and <b>Nutmeg</b> <b>Mannikin</b> [2 ̆ 2 Spice Finch 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 2 Spotted Munia 2 ̆ 2] (Estrildidae: Lonchura punctulata), have {{recently}} established significant viable and generally increasing populations in California.

Because of the potential for deleterious ecological interactions with native bird species and for damage to certain commercial crops, monitoring of these species and other potentially established exotic bird species must be ongoing.

40|$|Reports were scanned {{in black}} and white at a {{resolution}} of 600 dots per inch and were converted to text using Adobe Paper Capture Plug-in. A survey for forest birds was conducted in Kalaupapa National Historical Park in 2005 to determine presence-absence and abundance. Forest bird surveys were conducted using the variable circular plot method. Survey stations were established 140 m apart along six transects of variable length. Stations were surveyed for birds from March – May 2005. Also included in the analysis are data from a Hawaii Forest Bird Survey in 2004 for two transects located in the park. Of the nine native species that once inhabited the island, only three remain: We detected the Apapane (Himatione sanguinea), Iiwi (Vestiaria coccinea) and Maui Amakihi (Hemignathus virens wilsoni). As on other islands, Molokai now supports a number of non-native birds including: the Barn Owl (Tyto alba), Black Francolin (Francolinus francolinus), Common Myna (Acridotheres tristis), House Finch (Carpodacus mexicanus), Japanese Bush-warbler (Cettia diphone), Japanese White-eye (Zosterops japonicus), Northern Cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis), <b>Nutmeg</b> <b>Mannikin</b> (Lonchura punctulata), Red-billed Leiothrix (Leiothrix lutea), Skylark (Alauda arvensis), Spotted Dove (Streptopelia chinensis), and White-rumped Shama (Copsychus malabaricus).

40|$|Group {{foraging}} {{allows for}} individuals to exploit the food discoveries of other group members. If searching for food and searching for exploitation opportunities within a group are mutually exclusive alternatives, {{the decision to use}} one or the other is modeled as a producer-scrounger game because the value of each alternative is frequency dependent. Stochastic producer-scrounger models generally assume that producer provides a more variable and uncertain reward than does the scrounger and hence is a riskier foraging alternative. Socially foraging animals that are attempting to reduce their risk of starvation should therefore alter their use of producer and scrounger alternatives in response to changes in energy budget. We observed flocks of <b>nutmeg</b> <b>mannikins</b> (L. punctulata) foraging in an indoor aviary to determine whether their use of producer and scrounger alternatives were risk sensitive. Analyses of the foraging rewards of three flocks of seven birds confirm that producer is a riskier foraging strategy than is scrounger, although the difference in risk is rather small. We then submitted two other flocks to two different energy budgets and observed the foraging decision of four focal birds in each flock. All but one bird increased their relative use of the riskier producer strategy in the low food reserve treatment, but the overall use of producer did not differ significantly between treatments, providing evidence for a small but consistent effect.

40|$|Airport environments {{frequently}} provide ideal {{feeding and}} loafing habitats for many bird species. Bird strikes at most airports involve predominantly insectivorous species. However, the Lihue Airport {{on the island}} of Kauai, Hawaii has had a severe problem with bird strikes involving 4 granivorous species: the zebra dove (Geopelia striata), spotted dove (Streptopelia chinensis), chestnut mannikin (Lonchura malacca), and <b>nutmeg</b> <b>mannikin</b> (L. punctulato). Two owl species, the common barn owl (Tyto alba) and Hawaiian short-eared owl (Asio flammeus sandwhichensis), have also been involved in aircraft collisions at Lihue. Shooting and hazing techniques to disperse birds have proven ineffective or unacceptable; therefore, an alternative ground cover, wedelia (Wedelia trilobata), was tested to determine if the airfield environment could be rendered unattractive to birds. Volunteer stands of wedelia throughout the airfield were delineated and additional plantings established. We used bird activity, exclusion of seed-producing plants, rodent abundance, and invertebrate populations as indicators of effectiveness. Utilization of test plots by rodents and the four major seed-eating birds was significantly lower than in the corresponding control plots. The nearly monotypic stands of wedelia resulted in decreased seed availability to birds and rodents. Because of the ease of establishing and maintaining wedelia on airfields, its dominance over palatable seed producing plants, exclusion of rodent populations, low fire hazard, and decreased utilization by critical bird species, wedelia shows great promise as an alternative ground cover in tropical airfield environments...|$|E
