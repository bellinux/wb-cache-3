It was at this time that he presided over Britain's only excess of government revenue over expenditure in the period 1936-7 to 1987-8. Thanks in part to these successes there was a high expectation that the 1970 budget would be a more generous one. Jenkins, however, was cautious about the stability of Britain's recovery and decided to present a more muted and fiscally <b>neutral</b> <b>budget.</b> It is often argued that this, combined with a series of bad trade figures, contributed to the Conservative victory at the 1970 general election. Historians and economists have often praised Jenkins for presiding over the transformation in Britain's fiscal and current account positions towards the end of the 1960s. Andrew Marr, for example, described him as one of the 20th century's 'most successful chancellors'.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis work aims to {{quantify}} the neutrals fluxes produced by ion dissociative recombination processes (DR) in Titan's ionosphere. The calculation {{is based on the}} ion densities measured by the INMS instrument on Cassini orbiter during flyby T 19 at 1200 km of altitude. The dissociative recombination exhaustive chemical model is taken from Plessis et al. [1]. Neutral fluxes are compared with those predicted by the photochemical model of Hébrard et al. [2]. The comparison shows that the neutral production rates are at least of the same order of magnitude, with neutral fluxes from DR reactions which are often even larger. This first study confirms the necessity to build coupled models for the ionosphere taking into account the respective impacts of ions on the neutrals and of neutrals on the ions budget. Moreover we show that the highly dissociative contribution of the ion-electron recombinations leads to cascade effects on the <b>neutral</b> <b>budget,</b> with significant contribution to neutral species smaller than their parent ion.

40|$|The great {{recession}} of 2008 / 2009 {{has had a}} huge impact on unemployment and public finances in most advanced countries, and these impacts were magnified in the southern Euro area countries by the sovereign debt crisis of 2010 / 2011. The fiscal consolidation imposed by the European Union on highly indebted countries was based on the assumptions of the so-called expansionary austerity. However, the reality so far shows proof to the contrary, and the results of this paper support the opposing view of a self- defeating austerity. Based on the input-output relations of the productive system, an unemployment rate/budget balance trade-off equation is derived, as well as the impact of a strong fiscal consolidation based on social transfers and the notion of <b>neutral</b> <b>budget</b> balance. An application to the Portuguese case confirms the huge costs of a strong fiscal consolidation, both in terms of unemployment and social policy regress, and it allows one to conclude that too much consolidation in one year makes consolidation more difficult in the following year...|$|E

40|$|The gradualist {{approach}} {{towards an}} {{unconditional basic income}} for all involves the introduction or extension of universal benefits in place of current income-tested ones.

This entails investing in and making available mechanisms, guidelines and indicators that enable gender equality advocates to track progress, benefit incidence and show how supposedly gender <b>neutral</b> <b>budgets</b> impact on men and women. The aim of this discussion is to highlight the importance of gender budgeting in addressing gender disparities while taking note of the fact that gender is a key variable in development. The term gender budgeting will be defined in an effort to show how the practice can lead to gender equitable resource allocation and improve revenue generation for nations. This enables government’s commitment to gender equality and women’s empowerment move from paper to practical policies. In gender budgeting there is the creation of awareness regarding gender specific issues in the policies of all government agencies. It also brings to light the effort of women in running the economy and attaining economic efficiency by including equity in budget performance indicators. Considering that most nations signed and ratified international commitments on gender equality and equity, it is expected of them to put in place realistic budgetary measures towards the achievement of gender equality. Despite the fact that gender budgeting is a relatively new concept, it is undoubtedly an important ingredient in quickening the attainment of the Millennium Development Goals and the fulfilment of international commitments on gender equality. The discussion concludes by highlighting success stories of gender budgeting initiatives in various countries in an effort to show how gender budgeting {{can be used as a}} tool for engendering macroeconomic policies...|$|R

Due to increased government debt and debt service costs, however, national wealth and total output would decrease in the long run.

40|$|This {{testimony}} {{describes the}} results of a study of the Employment Service (ES) conducted by Dr. Jacobson and Prof. Arnold Katz of the University of Pittsburgh using data on over 100, 000 individuals who registered with the Pennsylvania ES between 1978 and 1987, and an even larger sample of non-registrants. One major finding is that much of the decline in the ES's performance over the past thirty years can be explained by changes in: funding, characteristics of registrants, and characteristics of job vacancies. Thus, we concluded that criticism of the ES often ignores changes in crucial factors outside of the ES's control that reduced its effectiveness. A second major finding is that most criticism of the ES is based on the inappropriate assumption that the primary goal of the ES should be to maximize placements. The proper measure of ES benefits is how well it reduces joblessness, increases earnings, and reduces UI and welfare payments. We found that the ES reduced the average duration of unemployment of long-term UI claimants by nine weeks. This was for UI claimants who were unemployed for at least 30 weeks. But the ES reduced joblessness of claimants unemployed for 12 weeks by less than two weeks. This is evidence that the ES is most effective in aiding claimants who had substantial trouble finding work on their own. But we suspect that the jobs found {{with the help of the}} ES do not compare favorably with jobs held prior to becoming unemployed. Thus, we believe the ES primarily acts as a backstop preventing large earnings losses. Finally, although savings in UI benefits and increases in earnings created by the ES may be modest, the cost of ES service is so low, $ 75 on average, that modest benefits would more than offset those costs. We believe our results, coupled with similar findings from related studies, is sufficiently strong to warrant increasing the funding of the ES. That measure is favored because it would be at least <b>budget</b> <b>neutral.</b> In contrast, other measures to assist the long-term unemployed, such as providing extended UI benefits or training, would not come close to being <b>budget</b> <b>neutral.</b> In addition, $ 1 spent on job search assistance is likely to be more effective in helping claimants than $ 1 spent on training. unemployment, insurance, employment, service, displaced, dislocated, Jacobson...|$|R

A conceptual framework of process response has been adopted which considers energy inputs, sediment transport and coastal morphology, under conditions of limited sediment supply and a "closed cell" situation. Onshore field investigations using conventional methods of surface sediment sampling, together with beach profiling, platform and cliff measurements provided quantitative data with respect to contemporary sediment inputs, sediment characteristics and transport. Extensive and intensive measurements of beach sections described spatial and temporal morphological and volumetric change and revealed a <b>neutral</b> sediment <b>budget</b> at the scale of 12 - 14 months. The beaches are in equilibrium with prevailing and dominant south westerly wave regimes; prolonged periods of south easterly wave climates influence the foci of wave energy and cause significant littoral drift and exposure of the chalk platform.

Investigations in the nearshore zone by side-scan sonar and echosounder revealed the morphological and sedimentological nature of the seafloor along the northern shore of Weymouth Bay.

Concrete policy proposals for reducing CO 2 emissions have been developed by the IPCC. One of the major instruments proposed is a carbon tax.

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Variations in complication rates or resource use among patients treated for a particular primary condition should be adjusted for coexistent disease. Age and ASA-PS scores are readily available and can be useful to stratify surgical patients for risk. METHODS: One thousand ninety patients at five academic medical centers in California and Massachusetts who underwent THR, TURP, or cholecystectomy between 1985 and 1987 were studied. Data were obtained from medical records and a self-administered questionnaire to measure length of stay (LOS), postoperative complication rates, and follow-up physician visits. Data were analyzed with one- and two-way analysis of variance with the Bonferroni correction. RESULTS: Increasing age and ASA-PS scores were associated significantly with increased LOS, complication rates, and frequency of post-discharge physician office visits. No interaction effect between age and ASA-PS scores was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Age and ASA-PS scores can predict postoperative morbidity, specific for each operation studied. Assessment of co-morbidity in surgical patients can be accomplished easily and with minimal expense. While remaining <b>budget</b> <b>neutral,</b> the distribution of reimbursements {{should be based on}} those preoperative risk factors that predict longer LOS and higher complication rates...|$|R

Outcome data supporting the value-added benefits of remote monitoring are rapidly accumulating, including (i) patient convenience, with reduced use of office services, (ii) equal safety compared with in-person evaluation, (iii) shorter detection time to actionable events (arrhythmias, cardiovascular disease progres-sion, and device malfunction), (iv) reduced length of stay for hospitalizations, (v) reduced inappropriate shocks, (vi) increased battery longevity, and (vii) a relative reduction in the risk of death. Fully automatic wireless technology, only recently widely implemented, will add considerable clinical efficiencies and further increase the value of remote monitoring. The U. S. challenge will be to appropriately define the relative value o...|$|R
40|$|In a {{previous}} paper (Part 1), the ideal soil fertility and the saturated soil fertility were expressed on a relative scale, called soil fertility grade (SFG). In the current paper (Part 11), {{the relation between}} SFG and soil test values is discussed. The required uptake of nutrients from the soil is translated into soil organic carbon, P-Olsen, exchangeable K, and pH (H 2 O) using relationships developed for a model on Quantitative Evaluation of the Fertility of Tropical Soils (QUEFTS). Target soil test values were calculated for target yields between 2 and 10 Mg ha(- 1) season(- 1). The required uptake of soil nitrogen {{is a function of}} target yield, and it is linearly related to soil organic carbon. Results of the calculations indicate that when target yields are less than 7 - 8 Mg ha(- 1), stover must be incorporated to maintain soil organic carbon above the critical level of 6 g kg(- 1). When yields are below 2 Mg ha(- 1), also organic sources from outside the field have to be brought in. The interpretation of chemical soil test values according to the ISF-SSF framework may be rather difficult in practice, as is demonstrated with eight African soils. The major reason is that the soil supplies of N, P and K seldom are in the same proportions as in ISF-SSF. For none of the used African soils replacement input or a <b>neutral</b> nutrient <b>budget</b> would be the best management option. Replacement input will often lead to inefficient use and even waste of nutrients. Optimum soil test values depend on target yield, but the ratios of soil test values do not depend on target yield. Therefore key values were established for the ratio of soil organic carbon to P-Olsen and for the ratio of soil organic carbon to the square root of exchangeable K. Based on these key values, a new classification scheme with recommended input ratios is presented. The scheme has six classes for N and P ratios, and seven classes for N and K ratios.

40|$|Using {{a dynamic}} {{multi-product}} partial equilibrium model, this paper firstly examines {{the potential impact}} of recent policy changes accruing from the mid term review of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) in 2003 on the cattle and sheep sectors in Ireland. Secondly, this paper evaluates {{the potential impact of}} the implementation of a CAP <b>budget</b> <b>neutral,</b> common EU flat area payment across all Member States. The European Commission has signalled that it will be evaluating current differences in the level of support between Member States as, for example, in the explanatory memorandum accompanying the Commission’s Health Check proposals the Commission argues that it is “increasingly harder to justify the legitimacy of significant individual differences in the support level which are only based on past support” (CEC, 2008; p. 18). This paper demonstrates how there are significant differences in the level of CAP payments per hectare across Member States, as generally farmers in more prosperous Western and Nordic countries receive a much higher level of payment per hectare than farmers in relatively poorer Central and Eastern European countries. In relation to Ireland, similar to most other EU- 15 countries, farmers benefit from the current inequitable distribution of payments and the results indicate that any move towards equalising the level of payments per hectare will have a significant negative impact on agricultural production and net trade.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{evidence on}} the effects of taxes and benefits on household incomes in Hungary referring to the 2006 system and a hypothetical flat tax reform. For this, a microsimulation model is used, which is based on a matched sample of an income and a consumption survey and administrative tax records. The Hungarian budget receives more revenues from VAT than from PIT. This has major implications on equity, as while PIT is progressive, VAT is regressive, imposing a higher tax burden on low-income households. We highlight the importance of tax allowances. The absolute amount of total tax allowances tends to increase with income, and the share of allowances within total incomes is around 5 - 7 % in all income groups, except the top fifth, where it declines. Targeting is thus inadequate, and it is especially so in case of child support. Family tax allowance reaches the bottom decile only to a limited extent. This is in sharp contrast with the universal child benefit, which is well targeted to the poorest. The second part explores the likely impact of the introduction of a flat tax, where VAT and PIT rates are set at 20 %, and a tax free bracket for low incomes is kept. We show that a <b>budget</b> <b>neutral</b> solution would have a largely regressive effect, where 70 % of the population would lose, with a minority {{on the top of the}} distribution gaining. ...|$|R
