40|$|The {{hydration}} {{process of}} cement pastes {{is of great}} importance to the physicomechanical properties of the hardened material. Thus, substances that regulate the setting of cement, such as <b>natural</b> <b>anhydrite,</b> have attracted significant scientific interest during the past years. This paper briefly describes the results of utilization of <b>natural</b> <b>anhydrite</b> in cement pastes of CEM-I and CEM-II types. The aim of the study has been to inquire the extent of natural gypsum replacement by <b>natural</b> <b>anhydrite.</b> The result of the hydration process has been expressed by the setting time and the compressive strength development, {{with respect to the}} SO 3 - 2 content of each mixture. The experimental data conclude that <b>natural</b> <b>anhydrite</b> can be a very efficient retarder of the setting of cement, with no significant change in the physicomechanical properties of the hardened pastes.

40|$|AbstractThe {{influence}} of technogenic ultrafine additives on structure and properties of binders based on calcium sulfate has been studied. The study {{of physical and}} mechanical properties of gypsum compositions modified with metallurgical dust has showed an increase in ultimate compressive strength up to 30 %, ultimate bending strength – 15 %, the value of water resistance of the binder did not change. 1 % of metallurgical dust being added to <b>natural</b> <b>anhydrite,</b> {{there is a significant}} increase of the strength of the composition by 40 %, and the water resistance of the material decreases slightly. The conducted X-ray analysis does not show the presence of any new products of hydration and intensification of hydration of calcium sulfate dehydrate. At the same time, the conducted studies {{of the structure of the}} compositions confirm significant changes in the morphology of new formations. Thus, adding ultrafine additives to <b>natural</b> <b>anhydrite</b> and gypsum leads to the formation of a dense matrix of the increased strength...|$|E

Here we explore {{the potential of}} this method on <b>natural,</b> polycrystalline <b>anhydrite.</b> The tests are run at atmospheric pressure, temperatures between 700 and 920 °C, and reference stresses between 7 and 30 MPa. An activation energy Q of 338 kJ mol − 1 and a stress exponent n of 3. 9 are derived. Deformation is localized into shear zones bounding a less deformed approximately conical plug underneath the indenter. Shear zone microstructures reveal inhomogeneous crystal–plastic deformation, subgrains, and extensive strain-induced grain boundary migration, while mechanical twinning appears not to be activated. Microstructure and mechanical data are consistent with deformation by dislocation creep...|$|R
40|$|The {{majority}} of cement plants in Greece mainly use natural gypsum to prevent rapid cement setting. The partial or total replacement of gypsum by materials, which contain calcium sulfate. has been instigated by two facts. Firstly, the increasing availability of low-cost by-products containing calcium sulfate and secondly, the prospect that, {{in the near}} future, the quarries will mine rock that {{is a mixture of}} gypsum and anhydrite. The aim {{of this paper is to}} discuss results from laboratory and industrial scale trials where calcium sulfate bearing materials (CSBM) such as <b>natural</b> gypsum, <b>anhydrite</b> and FGD gypsum have been used in various proportions in the cement production. The operational parameters and conditions of the cement mill during the industrial trials and the profile of the calcium sulfate hydrated forms in the produced cement are examined. The addition of FGD gypsum increases setting time without affecting compressive strength profile. The degree of dehydration of the dihydrated calcium sulfate regulates setting and strength performance of the cement partially replaced with either anhydrite or FGD gypsum. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

5000|$|Portland clinker is {{the main}} {{constituent}} of most cements. In Portland cement, a little calcium sulfate (typically 3-10%) is added in order to retard the hydration of tricalcium aluminate. The calcium sulfate may consist of <b>natural</b> gypsum, <b>anhydrite,</b> or synthetic wastes such as flue-gas desulfurization gypsum. In addition, up to 5% calcium carbonate and up to 1% of other minerals may be added. It is normal to add {{a certain amount of}} water, and small quantities of organic grinding aids and performance enhancers.

Blastfurnace slag cement may include up to 70% ground granulated blast furnace slag. See cement. Gypsum and calcium carbonate are relatively soft minerals, and rapidly grind to ultra-fine particles. Grinding aids are typically chemicals added at a rate of 0.01-0.03% that coat the newly formed surfaces of broken mineral particles and prevent re-agglomeration.

40|$|Calcium sulfoaluminate (CSA) cements are {{receiving}} increasing attention since their manufacture produces much less CO 2 than ordinary Portland cement (OPC) [1]. In addition, they show interesting properties {{such as high}} early-age strengths, short setting times and impermeability. The main uses of these CSA cements are for quick repairs and pre-cast products or floor concrete applications. They are prepared by mixing the clinker with different amounts of a calcium sulfate set regulator such as gypsum, bassanite or <b>natural</b> <b>anhydrite,</b> or mixtures of them. This work studies {{the effect of the}} amount and type of calcium sulfate (gypsum, anhydrite and bassanite) added to a commercial CSA clinker on the rheological behaviour of fresh cement pastes, setting time, phase assemblage, and hence, compressive strength of the corresponding mortars. This study demonstrated that the rheological behaviour is not affected by the addition of different gypsum contents, but the addition of bassanite increases the viscosity of fresh pastes, and considerably reduces the setting time. All the chemistry evolved in these pastes affect the compressive strengths of the corresponding mortars. Finally, mortars prepared from CSA cements with 25 wt% of anhydrite showed a compressive strength of 64. 1 ± 0. 6 MPa just after 3 hydration days.

40|$|Anhydrite {{solubility}} in H 2 O–NaCl solutions {{was measured}} at 6 – 14 kbar, 600 – 800 C and NaCl mole fractions (XNaCl) of 0 – 03 in piston–cylinder apparatus. Solubilities {{were determined by}} weight changes of <b>natural</b> <b>anhydrite</b> in perforated Pt envel-opes confined with fluid in larger Pt capsules. In initially pure H 2 O at 10 kbar and 800 C, CaSO 4 concentration is low (003 molal), though much larger than at the same temperature and 1 kbar. Hematite-buffered experiments showed slightly lower solubilities than unbuffered runs. CaSO 4 solubility increases enormously with NaCl activity: at 800 C and 10 kbar and XNaCl of 03, CaSO 4 molality is 200 times higher than with pure H 2 O. Whereas CaSO 4 solubility in pure H 2 O decreases with rising T at low T and P, the high-P results show that anhydrite solubility increases with T at constant P at all XNaCl investigated. The effects of salinity and temperature are so great at 10 kbar that critical mixing between sulfate-rich hydrosaline melts and aqueous salt solutions is probable at 900 C at XNaCl 03. Recent experimental evidence that volatile-laden magmas crystallizing in the deep crust may evolve concentrated salt solutions could, {{in light of the}} present work, have important implications regarding such diverse processes as Mount Pina-tubo-type S-rich volcanism, high-fO 2 regional metamorphism, and emplacement of porphyry Cu–Mo ore bodies, where anhy-drite–hematite alteration and fluid inclusions reveal the action of very oxidized saline solutions rich in sulfur.

40|$|The {{majority}} of cement plants mainly uses natural gypsum (CaSO 4 · 2 H 2 O) to regulate cement setting. The partial or total replacement of gypsum by materials, which contain calcium sulfate, has been instigated {{either by the}} increasing availability of low-cost by-products containing calcium sulfate or by the possibility that quarries would mine rock that {{is a mixture of}} gypsum and anhydrite. This paper is part of an extent research program aiming to investigate alternative calcium sulfate bearing materials, such as anhydrite and FGD gypsum. These materials have been examined in order to study the influence of their addition in cement physicomechanical properties (compressive strength, setting time). Hydration of cement pastes containing these CSBM was interrupted at specific time intervals within 5 min to 12 hours, and cement-setting reactions were characterized with the use of DTA, isothermal calorimetry and ESEM. In the same time SO 32 -, Ca 2 + and pH of the pore solution were also evaluated. It is concluded that, compared with natural gypsum, FGD gypsum prolongs the dormant period of hydration, while anhydrite accelerates it. Moreover, at a specific hydration time, cements with FGD gypsum seem to form more ettringite than <b>natural</b> gypsum and <b>anhydrite</b> does...|$|R
40|$|Faults that {{crosscut}} subsurface CO 2 storage systems offer potential leakage pathways, {{especially if}} fault reactivation and dilation occur. After reactivation, however, newly formed fault gouge {{is expected to}} gradually compact and seal {{as a function of}} time. To estimate the time scale on which this occurs, the processes that control compaction must be understood. We performed uniaxial compaction experiments on simulated anhydrite fault gouge to investigate the deformation mechanisms that operate under postslip conditions in faulted anhydrite caprocks. This involved constant stress (5 – 12 [*]MPa) and stress stepping experiments (5 / 7. 5 / 10 [*]MPa) performed at 80 °C, under dry and wet conditions, on fault gouge samples prepared from crushed <b>natural</b> <b>anhydrite</b> sieved into different grain size fractions in the range 20 – 500 [*]µm. Dry samples showed little to no compaction creep, whereas wet samples (i. e., flooded with presaturated CaSO 4 solution) showed rapid compaction. Our mechanical data and microstructural observations on wet samples suggest that for fine grain sizes (< 50 [*]µm) and low stresses, gouge compaction is controlled by diffusion-controlled pressure solution. With increasing grain size and stress, fluid-assisted subcritical microcracking becomes dominant. Pressurizing solution-flooded samples with CO 2 (15 [*]MPa) led to no significant effect on compaction rates in fine-grained material, but it decreased compaction rates in coarse samples. Since fine grain sizes are expected in reactivated faults, we infer that pressure solution will dominate in anhydrite (cap) rocks, with extrapolation of our lab data to reservoir conditions suggesting sealing time scales of a few decades...|$|E
40|$|The {{composition}} of magmas in arc volcanism depends on sediment subduction. The mobilisation of the subducted sediments determines {{the extent of}} the transfer of materials from the slab to the mantle wedge and whether the transfer occurs as a fluid or a melt. Extensive research has already been done on the contribution of pelitic sediments to arc volcanism. However, the high amounts of sulphur emitted by some subduction volcanoes, cannot be explained by pelitic sediments only. For these reasons, this thesis describes experiments determining melting relations in the anhydrite-dolomite system, as very {{little is known about the}} influence of these evaporitic sediments in a subduction setting. Melting relations in the anhydrite-dolomite system were determined through high pressure and temperature experiments, using a piston cylinder apparatus at 10 and 35 kbar and over a temperature range from 900 to 1370 ºC. The main experiments were performed using a starting {{composition of}} 2 : 1 dolomite/anhydrite ratio, some were performed with the ratios: 4 : 1, 1 : 1 and 1 : 3 dolomite/anhydrite and two experiments were performed with pure anhydrite. The resulting samples were analyzed with an electron microprobe. The onset of melting of the anhydrite-dolomite system occurs between 900 and 925 C at 10 kbar and between 975 en 1000 C at 35 kbar. The first melts formed in the 10 kbar experiment have a composition similar to a dolomite/anhydrite ratio of 2 : 1. Anhydrite and dolomite co-existed as residual solid phases during progressive melting, and disappeared 1000 and 1050 C in the 10 kbar experiments, leading with anhydrite. Above 1100 C, dolomite decomposes and periclase appears in the samples. In these experiments, the compositions of the melt and solids suggest that SO 3 was present in a fluid phase. Hence, next to dolomite decomposition and melting, some reaction occurred to transfer sulphur to a fluid phase. The melting point for pure anhydrite is probably higher than 1450 C at 10 kbar, due to impurities in the <b>natural</b> <b>anhydrite</b> used, experiments at 1400 and 1450 C yielded melt as well as primary crystals. Analysis of the experiments proved difficult due to the presence of CO 2, a fluid phase and quench crystals in the melt, therefore little can be said about trends in the compositions over the different experiments. Though the melting temperature of the mixture of dolomite and anhydrite proved about 100 C lower than that of the individual minerals, it is still too high to accommodate melting in an average subduction setting according to current models, unless a process like slab detachment plays a role and the inflow of hot asthenospheric mantle increases the temperature enough to accommodate melting. One example of a volcano in a subduction setting erupting sulphur- and CO 2 -rich magmas is Monte Vulture. During the Messinian salinity crisis evaporites, containing anhydrite and dolomite, were deposited on the Adriatic plate. This plate has since then been subducted underneath Italy. Slab detachment has occurred in the area, and the inflow of asthenospheric mantle has increased the temperatures to accommodate melting of the subducted evaporites. The involvement of the Messinian evaporites in the metasomatising agent of the mantle source beneath Monte Vulture could explain the high sulphur content, high  34 S value and high CO 2 content of the Vulture magmas. The findings in this thesis support that hypothesis...|$|E
