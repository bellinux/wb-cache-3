50|$|<b>Nafimidone</b> is an {{anticonvulsant}} drug of the imidazole class. It contains a naphthyl group. It {{seems to have}} been discovered by accident during a search for antifungal agents.|$|E
40|$|<b>Nafimidone</b> {{and other}} 1 -imidazoles {{were shown to}} be potent inhibi-tors of {{phenytoin}} p-hydroxylation in rat hepatic microsomes, being very effective even at submicromolar concentrations. The inhibitory potency of these 1 -imidazoles {{was similar to that}} of SKF 525 -A and considerably greater than that observed for other imidazoles (4, 5 -diphenylimidazole, cimetidine, metronidazole), metyrapone, or other anticonvulsants. The effects of structural modification on the inhibi-tory activity were examined. Except at the 2 -position on the imida-zole, alkyl substitution increased the inhibitory potency, probably because of increased lipophilicity. Substitution at the 2 -position caused marked diminution in inhibitory activity, possibly due to steric hindrance. The hydroxy analogs of <b>nafimidone</b> exhibited greater inhibitory activity than the corresponding keto compounds. Further-more, pretreatment of the rats with <b>nafimidone</b> resulted in greater Vmsx values for both low affinity and high affinity metabolic sites...|$|E
