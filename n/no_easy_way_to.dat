Loring was advancing from the south with a force rumored to be between 8,000 and 10,000 men. (The actual number was 5,000 plus new recruits.)

However, according to the rules of biological nomenclature, where there are two or more alternative names for a single species, the name first used takes priority.

While CamelCase makes linking easy, it also leads to links {{in a form that}} deviates from the standard spelling.

CamelCase-based wikis are instantly recognizable because they have many links with names such as [...] "TableOfContents" [...] and [...] "BeginnerQuestions." [...] It is possible for a wiki to render the visible anchor of such links [...] "pretty" [...] by reinserting spaces, and possibly also reverting to lower case.

2500|$|The year 1848 saw {{the close}} of Mexican control over Alta California, this period also marked the {{beginning}} of the rancheros' greatest prosperity. The Californio rancho society before 1848 had few resources except large herds of Longhorn cattle which grew almost wild in California. The Ranchos produced the largest cowhide (called California Greenbacks) and tallow business in North America by killing and skinning their cattle and cutting off their fat. The cowhides were staked out to dry and the tallow was put in large cowhide bags. The rest of the animal was left to rot or feed the California grizzly bears then common in California. The traders who traded for the hides, tallow and sometimes horns hauled them back to the east coast where the hides were used to make a large variety of leather products, most of the tallow was used for making candles and the horns were mostly used for making buttons. A trading trip typically took over two years. The classic book Two Years Before the Mast (originally published 1840) by Richard Henry Dana, Jr. gives a good [...] first-hand account of a two-year sailing ship sea trading voyage to California which he took in 1834-5. Dana mentions that they also took back a large shipment of California longhorn horns. Horns were used to make a large number of items in this time period. (The eBook of Two Years Before the Mast is available at Gutenberg project.) A large part of the Californio diet was beef, but since there was <b>no</b> <b>easy</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> preserve it most of the time another animal was killed when fresh meat was needed as when visitors showed up—the hides and tallow could be salvaged and very little was lost. The market for beef dramatically changed with the onset of the Gold Rush, as thousands of miners, businessmen and other fortune seekers flooded into northern California. These newcomers needed meat, and cattle prices soared from the $1.00 to $2.00 per hide to $30.00-$50.00 per cow. From about 1848 to about 1860 the rancheros enjoyed the [...] "golden" [...] days of Hispanic California.

In the early years of the Gold Rush the demand for beef was so great that there are records of about 60,000 longhorns being herded from Texas to California.|$|E
