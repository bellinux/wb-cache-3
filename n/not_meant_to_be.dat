5|$|The funerary cult of Djedkare Isesi {{enjoyed a}} revival during the New Kingdom (c. 1550–1077 BC). For {{the early part}} of this period, this is best attested by the Karnak king list, a list of kings {{commissioned}} by pharaoh Thutmose III. The list was <b>not</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> exhaustive, rather it gave the names of Thutmose's forefathers whom he wanted to honor by dedicating offerings.|$|E
5|$|As {{the series}} became popular, {{students}} in two schools {{were barred from}} wearing South Park-related T-shirts, while several parent councils in the United Kingdom expressed concern when eight- and nine-year-old children voted the South Park character Cartman as their favorite personality in a 1999 poll. Parker and Stone assert that the show is <b>not</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> viewed by young children, and the show is certified with TV ratings that indicate its intention for mature audiences.|$|E
5|$|Goffman {{uses the}} metaphor of {{conversation}} being a stage play. A plays tone will shift throughout the performance due to the actions taken by the actors; {{this is similar to}} how a discussion is keyed – based on what either person says or does over the course of an interaction, the key will change accordingly. The parallels go further, though. Goffman also claims that a speaker details a drama more often than they provide information. They invite the listener to empathize and, as was explained above, they’re often <b>not</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> stirred to take action, but rather to show appreciation; during a play this generally takes the form of applause.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} to other Alsatian wines, Rieslings d'Alsace are usually <b>not</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> drunk young, {{but many are}} still best in the first years. Rieslings d'Alsace tend to be mostly very dry with a cleansing acidity. They are thick-bodied wines that coat the palate. These wines age exceptionally well with a quality vintage aging up to 20 years. This is beneficial since the flavours in an Alsace wine will often open up after three years, developing softer and fruitier flavours. Riesling is very suitable for the late harvest Vendange Tardive and the botrytized Sélection de Grains Nobles, with good acidity keeping up {{the sweetness of the}} wine.|$|E
5|$|That's how I {{wanted to}} open the video, because I think it really sets {{up the rest of}} the story. It allows you to imagine you {{yourself}} are not just one person; you're so many. That person has so many stories and memories to draw from, and they all affect your journey profusely. I'm battered quite brutally at the beginning of the video, but at the end, I'm not battered; I'm a bit strange. It's <b>not</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> an answer video; it's meant to be a profuse number of the question.|$|E
5|$|Kyo's appears {{repeatedly}} in the series {{at the insistence of}} the marketers and the main planners. Iori, and other SNK regulars also appear in every game, making it a challenge to decide the storyline for each title. Along with his rival Iori, it has been noted by several of the series' designers that Kyo {{is one of the most}} difficult characters to illustrate because of his popularity among fans. Originally, Kyo's girlfriend, Yuki, was <b>not</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> conceptualized, since her first mention ever in the story was in Kyo's profile as one of his most cherished possessions. Her addition to his profile was done by one of the programmers mostly as a joke since Kyo was more popular with female gamers.|$|E

5|$|When {{asked by}} {{the staff of the}} {{magazine}} Animerica if the anime was influenced by Western superheros like Spider-Man or Batman, Taniguchi denied that influence. Instead, he said his inspirations for s-CRY-ed were other works he had produced for Sunrise. The society shown in the series was <b>not</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> another take on classic superheroes but instead investigate how everyone can adapt to their own situation. While the series is known for the extensive action in its episodes, the director believes everything he wanted viewers to see was presented. To distinguish the HOLY members, the Sunrise staff researched the costumes they could design. Taniguchi said their outfits are meant to resemble prison uniforms.|$|E
5|$|During {{the run-up}} to the 2006 Swedish general election, Reinfeldt was {{subjected}} to a smear campaign. Mats Lindström, a staff member in the Social Democratic Party headquarters, admitted to sending e-mails accusing Reinfeldt of tax fraud, false financial declarations and only attaining his position because of his father's influence. The IP address used in the e-mails was traced to the Social Democratic Party headquarters. Social Democratic Party Secretary Marita Ulvskog apologized and said that such behavior was completely unacceptable. A short time after the e-mail campaign, images that depicted Reinfeldt and the Moderate Party in an unflattering light were spread internally within the Social Democratic Party and subsequently leaked to the media. Social Democratic Party spokeswoman Carina Persson confirmed that the material came from the Social Democratic Youth League, but denied the existence of an official smear campaign and stated that the material was <b>not</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> released or spread to a wider audience.|$|E
5|$|Some bootlegs {{consist of}} private or {{professional}} studio recordings distributed without the artist's involvement, including demos, works-in-progress or discarded material. These {{might be made}} from private recordings <b>not</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> widely shared, or from master recordings stolen or copied from an artist's home, a recording studio or the offices of a record label, {{or they may be}} copied from promotional material issued to music publishers or radio stations, but not for commercial release. A theme of early rock bootlegs was to copy deleted records, such as old singles and B-sides, onto a single LP, as a cheaper alternative to obtaining all the original recordings. Strictly speaking, these were unlicensed recordings, but because the work required to clear all the copyrights and publishing of every track for an official release was considered to be prohibitively expensive, the bootlegs became popular. Some bootlegs, however, did lead to official releases. The Who's Zoo bootleg, collecting early singles of The Who, inspired the official album Odds And Sods, which beat the bootleggers by issuing unreleased material, while various compilations of mid-1960s bands inspired the Nuggets series of albums.|$|E

He <b>is</b> <b>not,</b> however, <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{the same person}} as the {{historic}} Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany, who would have held the title at that time, as the fictitious character is {{not a member of}} the royal family.|$|R

In this case, the poem was printed (original image here shown) on two facing pages of a book, sideways, so that the lines suggest two birds flying upward, with wings spread out.|$|R
5|$|Traditionally, Pre-Columbian Aztec {{writing has}} not been {{considered}} a true writing system, since it did not represent the full vocabulary of a spoken language {{in the way that}} the writing systems of the Old World or the Maya Script did. Therefore, generally Aztec writing was <b>not</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> read, but to be told. The elaborate codices were essentially pictographic aids for memorizing texts, which include genealogies, astronomical information, and tribute lists. Three kinds of signs were used in the system: pictures used as mnemonics (which do not represent particular words), logograms which represent whole words (instead of phonemes or syllables), and logograms used only for their sound values (i.e. used according to the rebus principle). However, epigrapher Alfonso Lacadena has argued that by the eve of the Spanish invasion, one school of Nahua scribes, those of Tetzcoco, had developed a fully syllabic script which could represent spoken language phonetically in the same way that the Maya script did. Some other epigraphers have questioned the claim, arguing that although the syllabicity was clearly extant in some early colonial manuscripts (hardly any pre-Columbian manuscripts have survived), this could be interpreted as a local innovation inspired by Spanish literacy rather than a continuation of a pre-Columbian practice.|$|E

5000|$|According to Ferrara, {{his plans}} {{to make a film}} about Pasolini have gone far back as the 1990s. Originally, the project <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> have <b>been</b> an actual biopic of Pasolini's life. Instead, it <b>was</b> <b>to</b> have starred Zoë Tamerlis Lund as [...] "a female {{director}} living the life that Pasolini lived." [...] However, Lund's death prevented this idea.|$|R
5000|$|The visual {{style of}} the three feature films is unorthodox, even {{compared}} to other Greenaway films. This is most likely because they <b>were</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> provide [...] "source material" [...] and [...] "background story" [...] for the Flash-based [...] "suitcases" [...] and hence <b>are</b> <b>not</b> truly <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> watched as a film with typical fashion, but more of an audio/video pastiche.|$|R
50|$|It is, indeed, {{a solemn}} and stately verse, rich and sonorous, <b>not</b> <b>meant,</b> however, <b>to</b> <b>be</b> read at one sitting, {{at the risk}} of surfeiting the appetite.
