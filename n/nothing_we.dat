500|$|Hannah {{entered a}} period of {{remission}} but, in May 1903, became ill again. Chaplin, then 14, had the task of taking his mother to the infirmary, from where she {{was sent back to}} Cane Hill. He lived alone for several days, searching for food and occasionally sleeping rough, until Sydney – who had enrolled in the Navy two years earlier – returned. Hannah was released from the asylum eight months later, but in March 1905, her illness returned, this time permanently. [...] "There was <b>nothing</b> <b>we</b> could do but accept poor mother's fate", Chaplin later wrote, and she remained in care until her death in 1928.|$|E
500|$|In 2005, LDS scholar Richard Bushman {{published}} {{a highly regarded}} biography of Smith entitled [...] which has frequently been compared to Brodie's work. In his book, Bushman noted that Brodie's [...] "biography was acknowledged by non-Mormon scholars as the premier study of Joseph Smith" [...] and called Brodie [...] "the most eminent of Joseph Smith's unbelieving biographers." [...] Bushman wrote in 2007 that Brodie had [...] "shaped {{the view of the}} Prophet for half a century. <b>Nothing</b> <b>we</b> have written has challenged her domination. [...] I had hoped my book would displace hers, but at best it will only be a contender in the ring, whereas before she reigned unchallenged." ...|$|E
500|$|Game Director and creator David Jaffe {{confirmed}} the game {{would be a}} cinematic presentation. He said that at E3, they got to see where players were having issues with the camera system and said, [...] "we are doing extensive focus tests, and using data compiled from E3, to find and fix the problem areas" [...] of the cameras. He said he had the confidence that the team would fix the problems before the game's release. However, he said if players [...] "hate cinematic camera systems, <b>nothing</b> <b>we</b> can do will help you like the God of War cameras". The game uses Santa Monica's Kinetica engine, which they developed for their previous game, Kinetica (2001).|$|E

500|$|On the {{potential}} for [...] "superhero fatigue", Feige stated, [...] "This year , we've got Civil War and we've got Doctor Strange in November, two completely different movies. To me, and to all of Marvel Studios, that's what keeps it going. As long as we're surprising people, as long as we're not falling into things becoming too similar ... next year, , , [...] Those are three totally different movies ... {{as long as the}} only shared thing is they come from the same source material and they've got our Marvel logo in front of the movies. Other than that they can be very distinct. What other studios do, what other properties, <b>nothing</b> <b>we</b> can do about it." ...|$|E
500|$|According to a December 2011 {{interview}} with Craig, [...] "We had the bare bones of a script {{and then there}} was a writers' strike and there was <b>nothing</b> <b>we</b> could do. We couldn't employ a writer to finish it. I say to myself, 'Never again', but who knows? There was me trying to rewrite scenes—and a writer I am not." [...] He said that he and Forster [...] "were the ones allowed to do it. The rules were that you couldn't employ anyone as a writer, but the actor and director could work on scenes together. We were stuffed. We got away with it, but only just. It was never meant to be as much of a sequel as it was, but it ended up being a sequel, starting where the last one finished." ...|$|E
500|$|In June 2008, EMI {{released}} a greatest hits album, [...] It was made without Radiohead's input and only contains songs released under their recording contract with EMI. Yorke {{was critical of}} the release, saying: [...] "There's <b>nothing</b> <b>we</b> can do about it. The work is really public property now anyway, in my head at least. It's a wasted opportunity in that if we'd been behind it, {{and we wanted to}} do it, then it might have been good." [...] In August 2008, EMI reissued [...] "special editions" [...] of Radiohead's back catalogue as part of its [...] "From the Capitol Vaults" [...] series. From mid-2008 to early 2009, Radiohead toured North America, Europe, Japan and South America to promote In Rainbows, and headlined the Reading and Leeds Festivals in August 2009.|$|E

500|$|Hoppus {{considered}} {{the music on}} the album wide-ranging, commenting, [...] "We tried to capture the energy and not worry so much about all the knobs." [...] This includes songs he felt sounded like the group circa 1999, [...] "super-fast late-Nineties-punk-rock-sounding songs," [...] {{as well as more}} progressive songs [...] "that are like <b>nothing</b> <b>we</b> have ever done before." [...] Overall, he {{considered the}} record [...] "really rich with sing-along melodies and sing-along choruses," [...] which was what he preferred most when listening to bands. Feldmann considered the music not a [...] "huge departure" [...] from the band's usual sound, as hoped to make a [...] "classic Blink record." [...] To familiarize himself, he listened to all of the band's catalogue prior to recording. Lisa Worden, music director at Los Angeles radio station KROQ, compared its sound to the second Blink-182 album, Dude Ranch, and commented, [...] "It sounds like Blink but it's not anything that we've heard before. For fans of the band, they're going to be super happy with it." ...|$|E
500|$|Neal Purvis and Robert Wade {{returned}} as screenwriters and completed {{a draft of}} the script by April 2007; Paul Haggis also worked on the script, completing it two hours before the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike officially began. Further work on the script had to be undertaken by Forster and Daniel Craig, who said later, [...] "We had the bare bones of a script {{and then there was a}} writers' strike and there was <b>nothing</b> <b>we</b> could do. We couldn't employ a writer to finish it. I say to myself, 'Never again', but who knows? There was me trying to rewrite scenes – and a writer I am not". Craig also admitted that the film was not initially meant to be a sequel, but it became one because of the re-writes undertaken by him and Forster. Haggis located his draft's climax in the Swiss Alps, but Forster wanted the action sequences to allude to the four classical elements of earth, water, air and fire. Michael G. Wilson decided on the film's title Quantum of Solace only [...] "a few days" [...] before its announcement on 24 January 2008. Forster hired Dennis Gassner as production designer, replacing Peter Lamont.|$|E
500|$|The actress led {{an active}} private life, {{reportedly}} swimming and playing tennis every morning. In her eighties {{she was still}} playing tennis regularly, as indicated in her 1993 documentary All About Me. She also enjoyed painting, which became a passion later in life. When questioned about politics, Hepburn told an interviewer, [...] "I always just say be on the affirmative and liberal side. Don't be a 'no' person." [...] The anti-Communist attitude in 1940s Hollywood prompted her to political activity, as she joined the Committee for the First Amendment. Her name was mentioned at the hearings of the House Un-American Activities Committee but Hepburn denied being a Communist sympathizer. Later in life, she openly promoted birth control and supported abortion. She practiced Albert Schweitzer's theory of [...] "Reverence for Life", but {{did not believe in}} religion or the afterlife. In 1991, Hepburn told a journalist, [...] "I'm an atheist, and that's it. I believe there's <b>nothing</b> <b>we</b> can know except that we should be kind to each other and do what we can for other people." [...] Her public declarations of these beliefs led the American Humanist Association to award her the Humanist Arts Award in 1985.|$|E
