An operation on {0,1} of arity n, or <b>n-ary</b> <b>operation,</b> {{can be applied to}} any of 2n possible values for its n arguments.

25|$|A {{family is}} indexed by an index set. In {{the case of}} a family of {{operations}} forming an algebra, the indices are called operation symbols, constituting the language of that algebra. The operation indexed by each symbol is called the denotation or interpretation of that symbol. Each operation symbol specifies the arity of its interpretation, whence all possible interpretations of a symbol have the same arity. In general it is possible for an algebra to interpret distinct symbols with the same operation, {{but this is not the}} case for the prototype, whose symbols are in one-one correspondence with its operations. The prototype therefore has 22n <b>n-ary</b> <b>operation</b> symbols, called the Boolean operation symbols and forming the language of Boolean algebra. Only a few operations have conventional symbols, such as ¬ for negation, ∧ for conjunction, and ∨ for disjunction. It is convenient to consider the i-th n-ary symbol to be n'f'i as done below in the section on truth tables.|$|E

2500|$|These tables {{continue}} at higher arities, with 2n rows at arity n, each row giving a valuation or binding of the n variables x0,...x'n−1 and each column headed n'f'i giving the value n'f'i(x0,...,x'n−1) of the i-th <b>n-ary</b> <b>operation</b> at that valuation. The operations include the variables, for example 1f2 is x0 while 2f10 is x0 (as {{two copies of}} its unary counterpart) and 2f12 is x1 (with no unary counterpart).

De Groote and Lamarche in [2] established the polynomial time decidability for Classical Non-associative Lambek Calculus.

5000|$|An {{extension}} of the above concept of Koszul duality was formulated by Ginzburg and Kapranov who introduced {{the notion of a}} quadratic operad and defined the quadratic dual of such an operad. [...] Very roughly, an operad is an algebraic structure consisting of an object of <b>n-ary</b> <b>operations</b> for all n. An algebra over an operad is an object on which these <b>n-ary</b> <b>operations</b> act. For example, there is an operad called the associative operad whose algebras are associative algebras, i.e., depending on the precise context, non-commutative rings (or, depending on the context, non-commutative graded rings, differential graded rings). Algebras over the so-called commutative operad are commutative algebras, i.e., commutative (possibly graded, differential graded) rings. Yet another example is the Lie operad whose algebras are Lie algebras. The quadratic duality mentioned above is such that the associative operad is self-dual, while the commutative and the Lie operad correspond to each other under this duality.|$|R
