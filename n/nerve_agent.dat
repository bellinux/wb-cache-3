5|$|From 12 to 14 September 2013, {{details of}} the Framework were {{negotiated}} at the InterContinental Hotel in Geneva, Switzerland. High-level negotiations were held between Kerry and Lavrov, with large teams of experts simultaneously working on technical details. A key breakthrough was reported to occur when the U.S. and Russia agreed on their approximations of the Syrian chemical weapon stockpile (estimated at 1,000 tons of sarin, mustard agent and VX <b>nerve</b> <b>agent).</b> On 14 September 2013 the Framework was agreed and signed.|$|E
5|$|Chlorine, {{a common}} {{industrial}} chemical, {{is outside the}} scope of the disarmament agreement; however, its use as a poison gas would violate the Chemical Weapons Convention, which Syria joined in 2013. Various parties, including Western governments, have accused Assad of conducting illegal chlorine attacks in 2014 and 2015. A late disclosure in 2014 regarding Syria's ricin program raised doubts about completeness of the government's declaration of its chemical weapons stockpile, and in early May 2015, OPCW announced that inspectors had found traces of sarin and VX <b>nerve</b> <b>agent</b> at a military research site in Syria that had not been declared previously by the Assad regime.|$|E
5|$|At {{the scene}} of Marks' game, Detective Allison Kerry finds a message for her former partner, Eric Matthews, and calls him in. Despite {{not wanting to be}} {{involved}} with the case, already dealing with a divorce and estrangement from his son Daniel, Eric reluctantly joins Kerry and Sergeant Daniel Rigg in leading a SWAT team to the factory which produced the lock from Marks' trap. There they find and apprehend John Kramer, the Jigsaw Killer, who is weak from cancer. He indicates several computer monitors showing eight people trapped in a house; arsonist Obi Tate, his only known survivor Amanda Young, business man Gus Colyard, gangster Jonas Singer, Laura Hunter, drug dealer Xavier Chavez, prostitute Addison Corday, and Daniel. A <b>nerve</b> <b>agent</b> filling the house will kill them within two hours, but Kramer assures Eric that following his own game, simply sitting and chatting with John, will see his son Daniel returned to him unharmed. At Kerry's urging, Eric agrees in order to buy time for the tech team to arrive and trace the video signal.|$|E

After realizing the answer to the clue, he kills Jonas with a spiked bat for his number after a brief fight and begins hunting the others. Laura succumbs to the <b>nerve</b> <b>agent</b> after finding the clue {{revealing}} Daniel's identity. Addison and Amanda abandon him, but Amanda returns after finding Jonas' body. Addison finds a glass box housing an antidote, but her arms become trapped in the arm holes which are lined with hidden blades, and Xavier leaves her to die after reading her number. Amanda and Daniel find a tunnel in the safe room which leads to a dilapidated bathroom with two rotting corpses. Daniel collapses inside just before Xavier finds them. Amanda notes that he can't read his own number, and he cuts the skin from his neck. As he approaches, Daniel, who feigned his collapse, jumps up and slashes his neck with a hacksaw, killing him.|$|E
25|$|The M125 bomblet was a U.S. {{chemical}} sub-munition {{designed to}} deliver the <b>nerve</b> <b>agent</b> sarin. It was brought into service in 1954 with the M34 cluster bomb {{as part of the}} first U.S. air-delivered <b>nerve</b> <b>agent</b> weapon.|$|E
25|$|As the United States Army Chemical Corps focused {{its efforts}} on the weaponization of sarin <b>nerve</b> <b>agent</b> (GB) during the 1950s the M34 cluster bomb was the first such weapon mass-produced by the Army.

40|$|Single-drop micro{{extraction}} (SDME) is an extraction methodology {{where the}} drop plays {{an essential role}} as extracts. It was evaluated for the GC-MS determination of <b>nerve</b> <b>agents,</b> one class of the chemical warfare agents (CWAs). Since these <b>nerve</b> <b>agents</b> are highly toxic, {{it is important to}} detect the <b>nerve</b> <b>agents</b> in the environmental samples. Several affecting factors including extraction solvents, stirring rate, extraction time, and amounts of salt were optimized. The limit of detections (LODs) were 0. 1 - 10 ng/mL and the relative standard deviations (RSDs%, n= 5) were in the range of 6. 3 % to 9. 0 % for four <b>nerve</b> <b>agents.</b> Without pretreatment of the environmental samples, 5 - 103 fold enrichments and 48 - 100 % recovery were accomplished.

25|$|In 1969, over 20 {{servicemen}} (23 U.S. {{soldiers and}} one U.S. civilian, according to other reports) {{were exposed to}} low levels of the <b>nerve</b> <b>agent</b> sarin while sandblasting and repainting storage containers. The resultant publicity appears to {{have contributed to the}} decision to move the weapons off Okinawa.|$|E
25|$|Almost 71,000 bombs {{containing}} the <b>nerve</b> <b>agent</b> Tabun had been seized in Germany {{at the end}} of the war, and these were stored in the open at RAF Llandwrog, until 1954 when, in Operation Sandcastle, they were transported to Cairnryan for disposal aboard scuttled ships at sea, 120 miles (190km) north-west of Ireland.|$|E
25|$|Each of the CAIS held {{between one}} and five {{different}} chemical agents. The agents used in CAIS were phosgene, adamsite, lewisite, cyanogen chloride, chloroacetophenone, sarin, nitrogen mustard, sulfur mustard and chloropicrin.

25|$|Tabun or GA is an {{extremely}} toxic chemical substance. It is a clear, colorless, and tasteless liquid with a faint fruity odor. It is classified as a <b>nerve</b> <b>agent</b> because it fatally interferes with normal functioning of the mammalian nervous system. Its production is strictly controlled and stockpiling outlawed by the Chemical Weapons Convention of 1993. Tabun {{is the first of}} the G-series nerve agents along with GB (sarin), GD (soman) and GF (cyclosarin).|$|E
25|$|Other {{issues to}} surface during {{disposal}} operations were {{high levels of}} mercury contamination and the tendency of the aluminum casing to explode inside the decontamination furnace. Molten aluminum and water presents a potential explosion hazard and because the Weteye contained a liquid <b>nerve</b> <b>agent</b> the potential for an interaction of molten aluminum and the liquid agent existed. These issues combined to make the Weteye sufficiently difficult to dispose of that it required special handling.|$|E
25|$|During the Nuremberg Trials, Albert Speer, Minister of Armaments and War Production for the Third Reich, {{testified that}} {{he had planned to}} kill Adolf Hitler in early 1945 by {{introducing}} tabun into the Führerbunker ventilation shaft. He said his efforts were frustrated by the impracticality of tabun and his lack of ready access to a replacement <b>nerve</b> <b>agent,</b> and also by the unexpected construction of a tall chimney that put the air intake out of reach.|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to test the hypothesis that the acute toxicity of the <b>nerve</b> <b>agents</b> S-[2 -(diisopropylamino) ethyl]-O-ethyl methylphosphonothioate (VX), O-pinacolyl methylphosphonofluoridate (soman), and O-isopropyl methylphosphonofluoridate (sarin) in guinea pigs is age- and sex-dependent and cannot be fully accounted for by the irreversible inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE). The subcutaneous doses of <b>nerve</b> <b>agents</b> needed to decrease 24 -h survival of guinea pigs by 50 % (LD 50 values) were estimated by probit analysis. In all animal groups, the rank order of LD 50 values was sarin > soman > VX. The LD 50 value of soman was not influenced by sex or age of the animals. In contrast, the LD 50 values of VX and sarin were lower in adult male than in age-matched female or younger guinea pigs. A colorimetric assay was used to determine the concentrations of <b>nerve</b> <b>agents</b> that inhibit in vitro 50 % of AChE activity (IC 50 values) in guinea pig brain extracts, plasma, red blood cells, and whole blood. A positive correlation between LD 50 values and IC 50 values for AChE inhibition would support the hypothesis that AChE inhibition is a major determinant of the acute toxicity of the <b>nerve</b> <b>agents.</b> However, such a positive correlation was found only between LD 50 values and IC 50 values for AChE inhibition in brain extracts from neonatal and prepubertal guinea pigs. These results demonstrate {{for the first time that}} the lethal potencies of some <b>nerve</b> <b>agents</b> in guinea pigs are age- and sex-dependent. They also support the contention that mechanisms other than AChE inhibition contribute to the lethality of <b>nerve</b> <b>agents...</b>|$|R
