40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Electrical EngineeringElectric {{vehicles}} (EVs) {{have been}} introduced as the demand for green transportation has increased. EVs require charging. Studies have shown that uncontrolled EV charging in {{certain areas of the}} community reduces the life of the distribution components, such as the secondary distribution transformer. One approach to remedying this is to increase the rating of the secondary distribution transformer, but by doing so, the <b>no-load</b> <b>losses</b> also increase. Minimizing <b>no-load</b> <b>losses</b> while deciding an optimal rating for the transformer during controlled and uncontrolled EV charging for an average day is studied in this work. The study is extended to include an hourly EV charging load. Along with <b>no-load</b> <b>losses,</b> the cost of the <b>no-load</b> <b>losses</b> and the cost of the transformer are minimized while deciding the optimal transformer rating. Controlling EV charging is another approach to controlling distribution losses and the transformer loss of life. Customer participation in delaying charging until getting the desired price is the approach taken in the next part of this study. Customer anxiety is defined and used as a measure to control EV charging behavior. The impact of customer anxiety on EV charging behavior is analyzed. An algorithm to control EV charging using customer anxiety as a measure is suggested in this work. The use of renewable resources along with controlled and uncontrolled EV charging and its impacts on the distribution transformer is studied here. Controlled EV charging deteriorates transformer life much less than uncontrolled EV charging does. The optimal transformer rating increases for uncontrolled EV charging versus controlled EV charging. When residential controlled EV charging along with energy from rooftop solar panels is used, the transformer loss of life is considerably reduced. With customer participation, EV charging can be controlled; hence, customer anxiety level can be a good measure for the utility to use in order to provide a plan-ahead system for EV charging...|$|R

40|$|Estimation {{of power}} {{transformer}} <b>no-load</b> <b>loss</b> {{is a critical}} issue {{in the design of}} distribution transformers. Any deviation in estimation of the core losses during the design stage can lead to a financial penalty for the transformer manufacturer. In this paper an effective and novel method is proposed to determine all components of the iron core losses applying a combination of the empirical and numerical techniques. In this method at the first stage all computable components of the core losses are calculated, using Finite Element Method (FEM) modeling and analysis of the transformer iron core. This method takes into account magnetic sheets anisotropy, joint losses and stacking holes. Next, a Quadratic Programming (QP) optimization technique is employed to estimate the incomputable components of the core losses. This method provides a chance for improvement of the core loss estimation over the time when more measured data become available. The optimization process handles the singular deviations caused by different manufacturing machineries and labor during the transformer manufacturing and overhaul process. Therefore, application of this method enables different companies to obtain different results for the same designs and materials employed, using their historical data.

40|$|This thesis {{demonstrates}} {{a method for}} transformer core diagnostics. The method uses the no-load current of the transformer as an indicator, and gives different characteristic signatures for different types of faults or defects. Using the no-load current for the diagnostic gives high sensitivity. The method is therefore able to detect defects that {{are too small to}} have an impact on the losses. In addition to different types of fault, the method can in some cases also distinguish between faults in different locations within the core. Both single-phase and three-phase transformers can be diagnosed using this method, and the measurements can be easily performed at any facility capable of measuring the <b>no-load</b> <b>loss.</b> There are, however, some phenomena that occur in large transformers, and in transformers with high rated voltages. Examples include capacitive resonance and magnetic remanence. This thesis proposes and demonstrates techniques for compensating for these phenomena. With these compensating techniques, the repeatability of the measurements is high. It is shown that units with the same core steel tend to have very similar no-load behavior. The diagnostics can then be performed either by comparing the transformer to another unit, or to simulations. The thesis presents one possible simulation method, and demonstrates the agreement with measurements. This topological simulation method includes both the electric circuit and an accurate model of the magnetic hysteresis. It is therefore also suitable for other, related, studies in addition to core diagnostics. Possible subjects include ferroresonance, inrush, DC magnetization of transformers, and transformer core optimization. The thesis also demonstrates that, for three-phase transformers, it is possible to compare the phases to each other. This technique makes it possible to diagnose a transformer even without a previous measurement to compare to, and without the data required to make a simulation. QC 20170607 </p...|$|E
40|$|Rotor {{electromagnetic}} losses can {{be problematic}} in high speed permanent magnet synchronous machines, {{especially when the}} speed or the electrical loading are high and the slotting and winding configuration results in high magnitude asynchronous harmonics. Accurate estimation of these travelling flux harmonics in the initial design stage is essential, as small errors can result in significant errors in the estimated rotor losses, {{which could lead to}} misinformed design decisions. This Thesis makes a number of contributions to the subject of rotor losses in PM machines. It firstly investigates the accuracy of the commonly used current sheet method for estimating losses for each harmonic. In this method, the losses are calculated using a multi-layer model of the machine in which each asynchronous harmonic in the rotor frame is represented by current sheet {{on the surface of the}} bore of a slotless stator. The harmonics are calculated using double Fourier transform of flux density data on the surface of the magnet obtained from a number of magnetostatic finite element (FE) solutions at different rotor position. The losses are also calculated using 2 D transient FEA with rotor motion, with appropriate mesh refinement and time step determined based on a mesh and time step dependence study. The results show that the current sheet method accurately calculates the losses in ring magnets if the amplitudes of the harmonics are estimated accurately. Secondly, the Thesis extends 3 analytical methods that have been reported in the literature by Zhu and Howe (1993), Gieras (2004) and et al (2006) to estimate the amplitude of the no-load asynchronous travelling flux density harmonics, the magnet flux tooth ripple harmonics, in the rotor frame. The accuracy of these methods is evaluated by comparison to those calculated using non-linear finite element analysis for variants of a particular machine. The results show that (et al, 2006) complex permeance method provides the closest estimate, when the level of saturation in the machine is negligible. However, if the saturation, of the tooth tip in particular is significant, then all methods underestimate the amplitudes of the harmonics. And accordingly, the estimated rotor losses are grossly underestimated by a factor of 1 : 3 in a machine with heavy tooth tip saturation. Thirdly, the Thesis tackles the problem of losses in a loaded generator with sinusoidal currents. It is shown that the total losses in the machine are dependent on the power factor and the phase angle between the emf and current. The total loss cannot be simply calculated by adding the <b>no-load</b> <b>loss</b> due to magnet flux tooth ripple harmonics and the loss due to stator mmf asynchronous harmonics. This is due to the interaction between the stator mmf harmonics and the magnet flux tooth ripple harmonics, which need to be added vectorially. This is verified by comparing the results calculated analytically (using the most accurate ’s meth d f calculating no-load harmonics), with those obtained from transient FEA in a machine with no significant saturation. Fourthly, the Thesis investigates rotor losses in a generator with two slots per pole per phase connected to an uncontrolled diode rectifier, considering the two cases of constant current and constant voltage dc link. Two winding and rectifier configurations are considered: a 3 -phase winding with a 3 -phase, 6 pulse bridge rectifier and a double 3 -phase winding with a 3 -phase rectifier each, connected in series i. e., a 12 pulse rectifier. Both magnet flux tooth ripple and armature reaction stator mmf harmonics are considered in the calculation of rotor loss; the harmonics were added vectorially. It is shown that the machine with double 3 -phase windings and 12 pulse rectifier has considerably lower rotor losses that the machine with one single 3 -phase winding due to cancellation of high order harmonics. Finally, limited studies are performed in the Thesis for the calculation of rotor losses in PMSGs with different slot opening, number of slots per pole and airgap (with magnet thickness adjusted to keep the airgap flux density and emf constant). It is shown that increasing the airgap and reducing slot opening reduced the losses The results plotted in a normalised form of loss per unit rotor surface area are versus the ratios of gap/slot pitch and slot opening divided by pole pitch. These curves are shown to give reasonable quick estimates of rotor losses in machines with different sizes. Also, rotor losses are calculated in three PMSGs with different numbers of slots per pole and winding / rectifier configurations. The results show that the popular 1. 5 slots per pole concentrated winding configuration have considerably higher rotor losses due to the strong second harmonic than the other machines with lap windings. The work in the Thesis was based on two-dimensional calculations, assuming ring magnets. Further work is needed to evaluate the 3 D effect and magnet segmentation...|$|E
