Although his term as Governor General ended in September 1893, {{he was forced to}} return to England on July 15. In April of that year, his elder brother Edward Stanley, 15th Earl of Derby died, and Stanley succeeded him as the 16th Earl of Derby.|$|E
5|$|Director Rob Bowman {{initially}} {{thought that}} the episode could be filmed in five days, two fewer than usual. However, it was actually filmed in three days after pressure from Paramount with two spent only on the sickbay set. He later said that he simply shot the framework for the clips to be added in later, and <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> final cut of the episode. Production assistant Eric A. Stillwell was responsible for selecting the clips {{that went into the}} episode, with 21 different clips included. The prop used on Riker to fight the infection was created from drawings by designer Rick Sternbach.|$|E

25|$|No signs, tracks or {{anything}} tangible or visible {{of the alleged}} animals was seen or shown whatsoever. Tracks, droppings, and other signs of forest elephants and gorillas were commonly seen, as well as crocodiles in the lake. Despite {{the fact that the}} African guides were extremely capable and experienced hunters, guides and experts of the African rainforest, they were not able to show any track or sign of the Mokèlé-mbèmbé and none of the several interviewed guides even claimed ever to have seen one personally, nor its tracks. Remarkable {{is the fact that the}} guides that were interviewed by the Dutch expedition and that also accompanied Regusters, stated that they <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> Mokèlé-mbèmbé during that expedition, although Regusters himself claims to have seen one.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the last}} representatives of {{absolute}} monarchy in Europe, he lived during a turbulent period; his reign <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> lasting peace. Throughout his period of rule, major powers, such as Spain, France and Great Britain, continually intervened in Portuguese affairs. Forced to flee to South America across the Atlantic Ocean into Brazil when troops of the Emperor Napoleon I invaded Portugal, he found himself faced there with liberal revolts; he was compelled to return to Europe amid new conflicts. His marriage was no less conflictual, as his wife, Carlota Joaquina of Spain, repeatedly conspired against her husband in favor of personal interests or those of her native Spain. He lost Brazil when his son Pedro declared independence, and his other son Miguel (later Miguel I of Portugal) led a rebellion that sought to depose him. According to recent scholarly research, his death {{may well have been}} caused by arsenic poisoning.|$|E

[...] Wolters noted the politicized atmosphere of his student days, stating, [...] "My academic freedom began, one might say, {{to the sound of}} drums: the Hitler Putsch and its consequences to us students, most of whom were in agreement with it." [...] Wolters, by his own admission, was in broad sympathy with Nazi aims, though he <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> need to join the Party.|$|E
500|$|In 1910, Vanderbilt's only blemish was {{fighting}} defending national champion Yale to a scoreless tie. Team captain Bill Neely, recalling the tie with Yale said: [...] "The score {{tells the story}} a good deal better than I can. All I {{want to say is}} that I <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> football team fight any harder at every point than Vanderbilt fought today – line, ends, and backfield.

500|$|Miranda Seymour in The New York Times {{remarks on}} the [...] "breathless passion" [...] of the narrator's voice as being {{absolutely}} convincing, citing as an example Nancy's statement to her sister {{at the start of}} the book about why she continues to visit Kitty Butler:... It's like I never saw anything at all before. It's like I am filling up, like a wine-glass when it's filled with wine. I watch the acts before her and they are like nothing—they're like dust. Then she walks on the stage and—she is so pretty; and her suit is so nice; and her voice is so sweet... She makes me want to smile and weep, at once...

[...] Her publicist Liz Rosenberg released a statement that [...] "None of this [...] is true. I <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> groom walk down an aisle with a bigger smile than Guy Ritchie," [...] adding that Morton's claims were a retread of [...] "tired old gossip.

500|$|Following Boys Don't Cry, Sevigny had a {{supporting}} role in American Psycho, based on the controversial 1991 novel by Bret Easton Ellis. Sevigny plays the office assistant of Patrick Bateman, played by Christian Bale, a 1980s Manhattan yuppie-turned-serial killer. The film, as was its source novel, was controversial because of its depiction of graphic violence and sexuality in an upper-class Manhattan society. In addition, she reunited with Kids writer and Gummo director Harmony Korine for the experimental Julien Donkey-Boy (1999), playing the pregnant sister of a schizophrenic man. Though it <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> major theatrical release, it garnered some critical praise; Roger Ebert gave the film his signature thumbs up, referring to it as [...] "Freaks shot by the Blair Witch crew", and continuing to say, [...] "The odds are good that most people will dislike this film and be offended by it. For others, it will provoke sympathy rather than scorn". Sevigny followed Julien with a small part in the drama film A Map of the World (1999), opposite Sigourney Weaver.|$|E
500|$|Fingleton wrote, [...] "He {{crouched}} {{a little}} at the crease...he tapped the ground impatiently with his bat while awaiting the ball, and his feet were so eager {{to be on the}} move that they began an impulsive move forward just before the ball was bowled. This was the shuffle that sometimes took him across the pitch against a fast bowler; but, that aside, his footwork was perfection. I <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> better forcer of the ball to the on-side, and for this stroke his body moved beautifully into position." [...] However, Ponsford was not a stylish batsman. Bradman said [...] "There were more beautiful players, but for absolute efficiency and results where can one turn to equal ?" [...] Robinson described Ponsford as the [...] "founder of total batting, the first to make a habit of regarding 100 as merely the opening battle in a campaign for a larger triumph." [...] The New South Wales and Australian bowler Arthur Mailey later said that [...] "I don't think it was the rungetting Ponny enjoyed so much as the bowlers' discomfort, especially when those bowlers came from New South Wales." ...|$|E
500|$|Some of {{the games}} that made the Saturn popular in Japan, such as Grandia and the Sakura Wars series, <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> <b>a</b> Western release due to Sega of America's policy of not localizing RPGs and other Japanese titles that might have damaged the system's {{reputation}} in North America. Despite appearing first on the Saturn, games such as Dead or Alive, Grandia, and [...] only saw a Western release on the PlayStation. Working Designs localized several Japanese Saturn games before a public feud between Sega of America's Bernie Stolar and Working Designs president Victor Ireland resulted in the company switching their support to the PlayStation. Panzer Dragoon Saga was praised as perhaps the finest RPG for the system due to its cinematic presentation, evocative plot, and unique battle system—with a tactical emphasis on circling around opponents to identify weak points {{and the ability to}} [...] "morph" [...] the physical attributes of the protagonist's dragon companion during combat—but Sega released fewer than 20,000 retail copies of the game in North America in what IGN's Levi Buchanan characterized as one example of the Saturn's [...] "ignominious send-off" [...] in the region. Similarly, only the first of three installments of Shining Force III was released outside Japan. The Saturn's library also garnered criticism for its lack of sequels to high-profile Genesis-era Sega franchises, with Sega of Japan's cancellation of a planned third installment in Sega of America's popular Eternal Champions series cited as a significant source of controversy.|$|E
