In this framework, the EU co-finances (through the European Regional Development Fund, the pre-accession instrument and the instrument of European neighbourhood policy) a series of cross-border, interregional and transnational co-operation programmes in the Mediterranean Basin. These are programs with economic, political, social and environmental objectives. Specifically, in this area bilateral cross-border co-operation programmes among all EU Mediterranean countries, multinational interregional co-operation programmes (IPA Adriatic, MED ENPI CBC) and transnational co-operation on territorial cohesion of Macro-regions (Programme Med) are implemented. All EU Mediterranean countries {{and most of the}} countries of North Africa and Eastern Mediterranean Sea are eligible to the mentioned programmes. The aim {{of this study is to}} conduct an interim evaluation of these programs and make suggestions for the new programming period for Cohesion Policy 2014 - 2020. After the presentation of the theoretical foundation of territorial cooperation we describe the framework and objectives of EU policy of territorial cooperation in the Mediterranean Macro-region as well as the multilateral and transnational cross border cooperation programmes. In a further step we summarize the main achievements and failures of the territorial cooperation programmes in the Mediterranean. We conclude that there are important differences in the path of implementation of the programmes due to many factors like the experience of the partner countries in planning methods and cooperation schemes, the existence (or not) of cooperation structures and clusters, the source of funds (e. g. ERDF, IPA, ENPI, <b>national</b> <b>co-financing),</b> bureaucracy, the culture of cooperation and in some cases political disputes. The evaluation of other aspects like the organization and management of the programmes, the eligibility of expenditure and the approval process of the projects, the monitoring and implementation procedures, the thematic and geographical allocation of the approved projects, highlight many problems that should be solved in the next programming period 2014 - 2020, in order to improve the effectiveness of the European Territorial cooperation in the Mediterranean Basin and promote economic, social, spatial and environmental cohesion of this macro-region...|$|R

This work was made available {{with the help of the}} Publications Office of the European Union, Copyright and Legal Issues Section. Malta introduced the first renewable energy scheme in 2006, which promoted the use of Photovoltaic technology on a small scale. Most of the funding available was directed at improving the energy efficiency of appliances and housing. In 2010, the focus has moved on towards larger support for the preferred choice in renewable energy technology, namely photovoltaics, as Malta struggles to work towards achieving its 2020 renewable energy targets. There has been a relatively strong reliance on solar energy, with a very small attempt to introduce wind turbines, the use of biofuels in industry and no use of geothermal energy. While the expectation was that wind energy would play a major part in the national landscape of renewables, technological and regulatory hurdles faced resulted in this technology not featuring on any substantial scale in the residential sector the industrial sector in Malta. The policy in Malta is reflective of EU policy, and justification for intervention in the provision of renewable energy is strong. The implementation of such policy, however, is still in its infancy. Malta obtains ERDF and Cohesion funds under the Convergence Objective, under which it can obtain a maximum EU co-financing rate of 85 % of the total eligible cost of projects. This is complemented by <b>national</b> <b>co-financing.</b> Regional differences in such support exist between the two larger islands, Malta (Main Island) and Gozo. However, this is not specific to renewable energy projects but pertains to interventions in general, as the country had at one point committed 10 % of EU funding to the island of Gozo. Moreover, Gozo is designated to become an Eco-Island over the next years, with a specific budget line out of national resources devoted specifically to this purpose, which may impact upon rates of support applicable to renewable energy projects in the Island Region.

40|$|Counterpoint - Ackrill and Kay: Professor David Harvey's {{proposed}} {{agenda for}} CAP reform in EuroChoices 5 (1) is, we believe, unrealistic. It pays insufficient {{attention to the}} politics of EU policy-making and ignores the importance countries place on protecting their shares of EU spending. We recognise the incremental nature of CAP reform, but believe this can lead to significant cumulative effects. Our proposal builds on modulation to transfer more CAP spending from Pillar I to Pillar II. Farmers receiving the largest payments should have their payments cut through higher compulsory modulation rates. We also seek a reduction of EU spending on the CAP, with greater national contributions achieved through the established channel of co-financing. Reply to Ackrill and Kay - David Harvey: Ackrill and Kay (A&K) say my suggestions for <b>national</b> subscription, <b>co-financing</b> and discretion for CAP Pillar 1 spending and associated elimination of the troublesome UK rebate risk a stalemate, and that the further reform will necessarily be incremental, rather than radical.

I also argue that my own suggestions are not so far from A&K's analysis as they seem to suppose.

Participants were 566 college students (72. 8 % female) between 18 and 35 years old. Eighty participants (14. 1 %) reported having injured themselves. Emotion regulation fully mediated the associations between NSSI and four important subdomains of romantic relationships, namely, avoidance of intimacy, anxiety over abandonment, violence victimization, and violence perpetration. We specified a model that evidences the mediating role of the emotion regulation between romantic relationships (romantic attachment and intimate partner violence) and NSSI.

40|$|Although the {{mechanism}} of action of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) is not clear, they can interact electrostatically with the cell membranes of microorganisms. New ocellatin-PT peptides were recently isolated from the skin secretion of Leptodactylus pustulatus. The secondary structure of these AMPs and their effect on Leishmania infantum cells, and on different lipid surface models was characterized in this work. The results showed that all ocellatin-PT peptides have an -helix structure and five of them (PT 3, PT 4, PT 6 to PT 8) have leishmanicidal activity; PT 1 and PT 2 affected the cellular morphology of the parasites and showed greater affinity for leishmania and bacteria-mimicking lipid membranes than for those of mammals. The results show selectivity of ocellatin-PTs to the membranes of microorganisms and the applicability of biophysical methods to clarify the interaction of AMPs with cell membranes.

If not properly addressed and resolved during therapy, ambivalence can prevent change and lead to psychotherapeutic failure. Two processes of ambivalence resolution have been suggested: (1) the dominance of the innovative position and consequent inhibition of the problematic position and (2) the negotiation between both positions. Objectives: To empirically study both processes of ambivalence resolution in a successful case of emotion-focused therapy. Method: Sessions were independently coded with three coding systems—the IMs, the return to the problem and the ambivalence resolution. Results: Ambivalence tended to be resolved from the initial to the final sessions. Although resolutions through dominance tended to decrease and resolutions through negotiation seemingly increased along treatment, dominance was, nonetheless, the most prominent process of resolution along the whole treatment. Conclusions: Although {{it has been suggested that}} integrating opposing parts of the self is a necessary process for psychotherapeutic success, a less integrative process of ambivalence resolution may also be an important resource along the process.

40|$|In {{this note}} two main points are discussed: {{the first is}} about the reasons why Italy’s “Mezzogiorno” (the 5 Regions in the South of Italy) could be {{considered}} one of the main failures of the EU cohesion policy in the programming period 2007 - 2013. The second, based on the information currently available, is the risk that the lessons that could be learned from the past could be forgotten, not producing a significant positive impact on the strategy devised for the current programming period 2014 - 2020. For the first point the analysis will be mainly based on the information provided by recent academic research, the Open-Cohesion Data Base published by the Italian Ministry of Economic development (2014), and by European Sources, in particular the Reports on Economic, Social and Territorial Cohesion by the European Commission. For the second point, the information available on the Italian Partnership Agreement and on the Operational programmes that are being prepared for the 2014 - 2020 programming period will be considered. Also, some recent governmental decisions that produce a direct impact on the implementation of the EU structural funds programmes will be discussed. Southern Regions have suffered the strongest impact of the global crisis, and showed the slowest rate of recovery among the European Regions, apart a few extreme cases, like Greece. The poor performance of Mezzogiorno Regions can be measured both in absolute terms and in relative terms, compared to the Northern regions of Italy and to other EU regions. In these comparisons, the performance of Italy’s Mezzogiorno has been the weakest, {{and at the end of}} the 2007 - 2013 period the distance in the level of economic development from the most developed regions in Italy and in Europe increased more than in any other less developed country of the EU. Demographic indicators of Mezzogiorno are among the worst in Europe, with a new growth of emigration rates, comparable only to those from the first decades after the Second World War, and a fertility rate largely below the minimum needed for demographic stability. Looking at efficiency and the effectiveness of structural funds implementation, very low rate of absorption of the European Structural Funds is still observable in all Southern Regions, for all Funds. Still now, less than a year to the end of the implementation period, in some regions more than 1 / 3 of committed funds are still to be spent. Since the beginning of the period, programming activities showed many delays, and frequent revisions of the programme financial allocation were approved to adjust the strategy initially designed. At the same time, a wide dispersion of interventions in all sectors and areas was planned and/or resulted in practice, missing in most cases the possibility to reach the critical mass needed to make a lasting impact. Looking at the financed operations, a very strong fragmentation can be observed, with thousands of micro projects, limited if not null lasting impact on economic and social development. The new regulatory framework approved for the 2014 - 2020 programming period has already faced in Italy some of the same difficulties that hampered the success of the cohesion policy in the previous programming period in Italy’s Mezzogiorno. A first misstep was the much delayed approval of the Italian Partnership agreement. In the new framework, the Partnership Agreement is supposed to establish the framework for the single programmes’ strategy at national level. By approving it much later than most of the European Countries, Italy has already lost the first year of implementation. A second example of a recurring issue from the previous period is that of excessive fragmentation. The concentration principle, one of the pillars of the new programming strategy, is again challeged: the new programmes have established hundreds of different action lines. The SMART specialization strategies, one of the main innovations of the new period, that are supposed to help European regions to concentrate resources on innovations capitalizing on the main natural, industrial and social assets, have been translated at Mezzogiorno level in broad and unbinding strategies, often simply replicating a structural description of the regional economies. The reduction of the <b>National</b> <b>co-financing,</b> proposed by the Italian government mainly to reduce the risk of low and delayed absorption, if implemented without addressing the structural factors that have multiplied the time needed for the execution of public investments in Italy, could just lead to a further decline in the investment rate in Mezzogiorno. The risk of further divergence of Mezzogiorno from Italy’s North and Centre looks again imminent, without substantial improvement of effectiveness of Structural Funds Programmes and, what’s more, without a new attention to Mezzogiorno of the national economic policy agenda...|$|R

Devices were developed, which promise an overall airframe noise reduction potential of up to 5 dB, relative to air-frame noise levels of current aircraft. While such technologies already reach a high “technology readiness level” for landing gears, the development of noise reduction means for high-lift devices still remains in a research stage. For the development of low-noise high-lift devices for future aircraft by means of computational aeroacoustics, low-cost simulation codes were developed, validated and applied to a variety of 2 D airframe noise problems...|$|R
40|$|Aim: We {{understand}} ambivalence as a {{cycle of}} opposing expressions by two internal voices. The emergence of a suppressed voice produces an innovative moment (IM), challenging the dominant voice, which represents the client’s problematic selfnarrative. The emergence of the IM is opposed by the dominant voice, leading to {{a return to the}} problematic self-narrative. This study analyzed therapist and client responses to each other in episodes of ambivalence. Method: The therapeutic collaboration coding system (TCCS) assesses whether and how the therapeutic dyad is working within the therapeutic zone of proximal development (TZPD) by examining client responses to therapist interventions. We applied the TCCS to episodes in which a good- and a poor-outcome client in narrative therapy expressed ambivalence. Results: In both the good- and poor-outcome cases, the therapist responded to the emergence of ambivalence similarly, balancing challenging and supporting. The good-outcome case responded at the developmental level proposed by the therapist when challenged, while the poor-outcome case lagged behind the level proposed. Discussion: This supports the theoretical explanation that the therapist did not match client’s developmental level in the poor-outcome case, working beyond the client’s current TZPD and contributing to the maintenance of ambivalence.

40|$|An {{algorithmic}} implementation {{is presented}} to deal with several responses in mixtures problems, without theoretical limits {{on the number of}} responses or on the factors to be blended. Also, constrained and unconstrained domains are handled, as well as domains with both mixtures and discrete variables. Besides, an alternative way of interpreting the results coming from the experimental design for mixtures is presented. It is based on the parallel coordinates plots for visualization in more than the usual three-dimensional Cartesian diagrams or the simplex mixture spaces for at most four experimental factors. Specifically, this is done in cases in which more than one experimental response should be handled, tackling the conflict by estimating trading-off solutions via the computation of the pareto-optimal front, which is fully explored with the parallel coordinates plots. The procedure is shown by two case-studies, taken from the literature. The first one deals with several factors in a constrained experimental domain when trying to optimize a detergent by taking into account two severely conflicting characteristics. The second one is about five chemical components blended with different dosage levels for getting a concrete strong enough, experimental results that are re-evaluated by posing a unique blocked design for analysing the data. The joint use of the pareto-optimal front for mixtures designs and the parallel coordinates plots for its visualization provide the researcher {{a deeper understanding of the}} problem under study to make accurate decisions.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to examine the {{development}} of using financial resources from EU funds between 2007 and 2013 within the Polish NUTS II regions in the aspect of the two sector model of national economy; to decide which fields of interest are influenced by EU funds (based on causality testing in the conventional Granger sense or the Toda-Yamamoto augmentation); and to evaluate the development of ratio between EU funds and national resources putted into co-financed projects. The analysis - applied on quarterly data - was divided into two main parts.

40|$|Parental {{behavioural}} traits can {{be transmitted}} by non-genetic mechanisms to the offspring. Although trait transmission via sperm has been extensively researched, epidemiological studies indicate the exclusive/prominent maternal transmission of many non-genetic traits. Since maternal conditions impact the offspring during gametogenesis and through fetal/early-postnatal life, the resultant phenotype is likely the aggregate of consecutive germline and somatic effects; a concept {{that has not been}} previously studied. Here, we dissected a complex maternally transmitted phenotype, reminiscent of comorbid generalized anxiety/depression, to elementary behaviours/domains and their transmission mechanisms in mice. We show that four anxiety/stress-reactive traits are transmitted via independent iterative-somatic and gametic epigenetic mechanisms across multiple generations. Somatic/gametic transmission alters DNA methylation at enhancers within synaptic genes whose functions can be linked to the behavioural traits. Traits have generation-dependent penetrance and sex specificity resulting in pleiotropy. A transmission-pathway-based concept can refine current inheritance models of psychiatric diseases and facilitate the development of better animal models and new therapeutic approaches.

The molecular weight {{was determined by}} gel permeation chromatography and the sugar composition and sulfation position by NMR and SAX-HPLC after enzymatic digestion. The CSs showed a prevalent 6 S GalNAc sulfation for the 3 species (4 S/ 6 S ratio lower than 1). A higher 6 S sulfation was observed for P. glauca head and R. clavata skeleton (4 S/ 6 S ratio below 0. 20) than for S. canicula (4 S/ 6 S ratio ca. 0. 6). The existence of CS samples with such low 4 S/ 6 S ratio has only been observed before in a rare species of shark (Mitsukutina owatoni, globin shark). The good extraction yields achieved make S. canicula, P. glauca and R. clavata fish industry by-products a useful source of 6 -sulfated chondroitin sulfate.

40|$|Colluvial soils {{can store}} signals of the {{environmental}} conditions occurred during their formation, including the anthropogenic activities they supported. Their study may provide important information for reconstructing and interpreting the evolution of cultural landscapes. We studied the chemical properties of a terraced soil system located {{in the town of}} Santiago de Compostela (NW Spain). Aluminum, Fe and Si fractionation was studied by selective dissolution techniques with high vertical resolution, combined with elemental composition and other soil properties such as phosphate retention (Pret) and NaF pH, aiming to identify modifications produced by land use changes and agricultural management practices since Antiquity. The buried epipedon of the paleosol, which is considered to exemplify the pre-terracing soil, showed strong andic character. We argue that its attenuation in the anthropogenic soil layers is, firstly, a consequence of the decreasing amounts of reactive components (organic matter, organo-Al complexes and low ordered aluminosilicates) due to a dilution by mixing superficial and sub-superficial horizons. Secondly, the introduction of agricultural techniques led to modifications in the chemical stability of organo-metal complexes influencing the accumulation of organic matter. Other signals, such as variations in soil acidity, and P and Ca contents, point to management practices as fertilization or liming. The increasing amounts of Fe inorganic compounds in the more recent layers indicate a strong weathering and degradation, probably {{as a consequence of the}} intensification of the agricultural use. Our results indicated continued and progressively more intensive agricultural use during the last 15 centuries, linked to the development of the town. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. C.

40|$|This study {{analyzed}} the mediating role of fetal {{heart rate variability}} (FHR) on prenatal depression and neonatal neurobehavioral maturity. A sample of 104 pregnant women was recruited and {{divided into two groups}} according to their Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) scores (depressed/non-depressed). FHR variability in response to speech stimuli was assessed at term (between 37 and 39 weeks gestation). The neonates were then assessed on the Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale (NBAS) during the first 5 days after birth. The fetuses of non-depressed pregnant women showed higher HR variability than the fetuses of depressed pregnant women in response to speech stimuli, and later as neonates they performed more optimally on the NBAS (on autonomic stability and total scores). FHR variability mediated the relationship between the mother's prenatal depression and the neonatés NBAS performance. Prenatal depression effects on neonatal behavior may be partially explained by its adverse effects on fetal neurobehavioral maturity.

40|$|One of {{the recent}} tasks and {{responsibilities}} of the Slovak Centre of Scientific and Technical Information (CVTI SR) is to provide technology transfer support to public research organisations on national level. For this purpose, SCSTI has been mandated by the Ministry of Education, Science, Research and Sport of the Slovak Republic to implement <b>national</b> project, <b>co-financed</b> from the EU structural funds within the Operational Programme Research and Development, named National infrastructure for technology transfer support in Slovakia – NITT SK. The project is focused on building and securing operation of the national system supporting technology transfer processes in Slovakia and is implemented in the period June 2010 – December 2014 with the total budget of 8. 2 million. The transfer of knowledge from science to industry, {{for the benefit of}} society, will be supported through the complex mechanism, which is currently being developed. The key subject in the whole system will be the National Technology Transfer Centre, which will co-operate closely with local technology transfer centres established at universities and public research institutions. Important part of the system will be the National patent fund, from which financial support in the processes of protecting and commercialising intellectual property will be provided to public research institutions. The financial support shall include payments for patent filing and maintenance (PCT, USPTO, European and national applications), patent attorneys services, patent translations, partner search, marketing, negotiating and licensing. Even nowadays, patent filing fees are covered form the state budget money administrated by the CVTI SR, while external support services are provided within the NITT SK project. This is a great benefit for Slovak public and state universities and the Slovak Academy of Sciences, which had to permanently face the lack of financial means for these purposes. Concerning the technology transfer activities that are being provided through the NITT SK project, these cover the whole process of transferring scientific knowledge into the praxis, starting from intellectual property protection and ending with its commercial utilisation. Services are provided by external high-level experts on relevant technology transfer issue from respective scientific field. All costs are covered from the NITT SK budget and are free for scientific community. Concrete services include assessment of intellectual property commercialisation potential, state of the art analyses, patent application preparation and filing, technology marketing, partner searches, negotiation support, preparation of licensing agreements, spin-offs creation, follow-up of royalties’ payment and so on. Since 2012, when this support started, several patent applications have already been supported within the NITT SK project. Last year, the National portal for technology transfer has also been launched within the NITT SK project. It provides a comprehensive overview of technology transfer issues serving researchers, students, companies and local TT offices. Useful are sample contracts, internal regulations and other methodological materials related to technology transfer.

The IFITM 3 allele (rs 12252 -C) was suggested as a strong population-based genetic risk factor for severe influenza virus infection by A(H 1 N 1) pdm 09. We analyzed the population genetics of IFITM 3 variants in Portuguese general population (n= 200) and Central Africans (largely Angolan) (n= 148) {{as well as its}} association to influenza severity in Portuguese patients (n= 41). Seven SNPs, within the 352 bp IFITM 3 amplicon around rs 12252, were identified. SNP distributions in the Portuguese appeared at an intermediate level between the Africans and other Europeans. According to HapMap rs 34481144 belongs to the same linkage disequilibrium (LD) block as rs 12252, and is in strong LD with rs 6421983. A negative association with severe relative to mild disease was observed for allele rs 34481144 -A, indicating a protective effect under the dominant model. Moreover, haplotype Hap 4 with rs 34481144 -A, not including rs 12252 -C, was significantly associated to mild influenza. Conversely, although with borderline significance, haplotype Hap 1 with rs 34481144 -G, not including rs 12252 -C, was associated to severe disease. Moreover, in comparison to the general Portuguese population, statistical significant differences in the frequencies of the protective allele rs 34481144 -A in the severe disease group, the deleterious Hap 1 in the mild disease group and the protective Hap 4 in the severe disease group, were observed. The population attributable risk (PAR) for the targeted rs 34481144 allele or genotype was of 55. 91 % and 64. 44 % in the general population and the mildly infected individuals, respectively. Implication of these variants in disease phenotype needs further validation, namely through functional analysis as is discussed.

Ninety-four primiparous mothers completed measures on infant sleep-wake behaviors at two weeks, three and six months. Significant developmental changes were found on infant sleep-wake behaviors from two weeks to six months. Twoweek- old infants sleep 13. 3 h, spend 8. 7 h awake, awake 6. 1 times, have 0. 4 h of latency to sleep, and 3. 2 h of longest sleep period. Three-month-old infants sleep 13. 0 h, spend 9. 2 h awake, awake 5. 5 times, have 0. 4 h of latency to sleep, and 5. 2 h of longest sleep period. Sixmonth- old infants sleep 12. 2 h, spend 10. 0 h awake, awake 5. 2 times, have 0. 4 h of latency to sleep, and 5. 6 h of longest sleep period. Significant individual change and stability were also found on infant sleep-wake behaviors from two weeks to six months.

40|$|Trigger motion {{sickness}} {{and can also}} {{have a role in}} some anxiety disorders. We explore a method to detect individual sensitivity to visual-vestibular unusual patterns, which can signal a vulnerability to develop {{motion sickness}} and possibly anxiety disorders such as a fear of heights and panic. 65 undergraduate students were recruited {{for the purposes of this}} study as voluntary participants (44 females); average age 21. 65 years (SD= 2. 84) with normal or corrected to normal vision, without vestibular or postural deficiencies. Panic was assessed with the Albany Panic and Phobia Questionnaire, Motion Sickness with the Motion Sickness Susceptibility Questionnaire and Acrophobia was assessed by means of the Acrophobia Questionnaire. The Sharpened Romberg Test was used to test participant’s postural balance. The Rod and Frame Test (RFT) measures the participant’s ability to align a rod to the vertical within a titled frame providing a measure of error in the perception of verticality by degrees. This test was changed to measure the error offered when a participant’s head was tilted, and to trace the error caused by manipulating the vestibular system input. The main findings show only motion sickness to be correlated with significant errors while performing a visual-vestibular challenging situation, and fear of heights is the only anxiety disorder connected with postural stability, although all disorders (fear of heights, panic and motion sickness) are correlated between each other in the self- report questionnaires. All disorders are correlated to each other in the surveys, and might have some common visual-vestibular origin, in theory. The rod and frame test was exclusively correlated with motion sickness whereas the postural stability test only displayed sensibility to acrophobia. Panic disorder was correlated to neither the RFT nor the Romberg. Although this method was initially employed to increase sensibility in order to detect anxiety disorders, it ended up showing its value in the detection of motion sickness. <b>National</b> funds and <b>co-financed</b> by FEDER through COMPETE 2020 under the PT 2020 Partnership Agreement (POCI- 01 - 0145 -FEDER- 007653).
