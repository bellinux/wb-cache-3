This paper shows that ex post monitoring is the optimal audit regime when the competition authority's probability of error is low.

This paper provides a theoretical justification for this shift based on the competition authority’s accuracy of judgement. We show that ex post monitoring dominates when the competition authority’s probability of error if low enough. We also investigate the two other existing legal systems, i. e. block exemptions and black list, and show {{that they should be}} preferred when the competition authority’s beliefs about the welfare impact of the agreements are very optimistic or very pessimistic...|$|R

The standard agreement successfully meets the demand of international trade which urgently need the high speed and the accuracy. The objective of this research is to find out how does the development of agreement affect to the commerce practices and what are the requirements of standard agreement in accordance with the right and obligation. A qualitative method is applied in searching data of business practices. This study uses a normative research which guides the rule of law or determines some business standards and norms. The finding of this study show that the development of agreement strongly affects to the commerce practices, and standar agreement is urgently needed by business practices as a guideline to perform business traffic as smooth as buyer and seller expect, then both seller and buyer should know the three alternative way used as the procedures of standard agreement, namely; contract signing, <b>notification</b> document <b>agreement,</b> and <b>notification</b> by bulletin board. At last, a standard agreement could be accepted as legal agreement corresponding to willingness and trustworthy...|$|R
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of my thesis was to {{describe}} and analyse {{the system of the}} block exemptions. Briefly, the block exemption is a kind of exemption from the prohibition under article 101 (1) TFEU because it is supposed to fulfil the criteria of article 101 (3) TFEU. It exempts certain category of agreements, which are covered by the special regulation issued by the Council or more often by the Commission. The paper is divided into seven chapters and the first opening chapters are dealing with more general aspects of block exemption: the function, process of issuing, non- application and the advent of block exemption where the regulation 1 / 2003 (Modernisation Regulation) should be of special attention. It abolished the regime of previous <b>notification</b> of <b>agreements</b> to the Commission. An introduction to the system of other exemptions from the prohibition under article 101 (1) TFEU is also described there. The following part (chapter 4) focuses more detailed on the kinds of block exemptions, which are divided into the vertical, horizontal and sector exemptions. The former exemptions issued by the Czech Office for the Protection of Competition are no longer applicable and therefore only the block exemptions of the EU are of the concern of this paper. Furthermore, the special competition regime of some [...] ...|$|R

Implementing fault tolerant distributed software (FTDS) is a difficult task [2]. Group communication services [8] such as group membership and reliable multicast has been proposed to solve some of the problems in implementing FTDS. In this paper we propose an agreement service build on top of a group communication layer which allows distributed applications to reach agreement. The service, using the underlying group communication layer, ensures that all correct application processes receive the same agreement result or failure <b>notification.</b> The proposed <b>agreement</b> service facilitates the development of FTDS by implementing agreement protocols transparently to the application programmer. 1 Introduction The rapid growth of interconnected networks has led to the increasing use of distributed computing. Distributed systems consists of a nu [...] ...|$|R

40|$|In 1952, General Electric Co. (GE) absorbed their {{completely}} owned subsidiary,　International General Electric Co., Inc. (IGEC) {{and made}} IGEC {{a division of}} the company. This article explores the reason for this absorption from the viewpoint of GE's export trading. If we limit ourselves to only some indicators of international cartel and foreign direct investment, we cannot fully examine GE's international　business history. During the interwar period, GE had led international cartels, the　Phoebus Agreement in the electric lamp field, and the International <b>Notification</b> and Compensation <b>Agreement</b> in the electrical apparatus field to protect the American market and to compete in the export market. Because of the segregation of the domestic market from the foreign market and the　different way in which business was　conducted, the structure of IGEC was　appropriate for its international strategy. But World War II changed the export market. First, the war cut off the relationship between IGEC and the London-based cartels. Second, the German and Japanese industries dropped out of the international market. And, after the war, the general demand for electrical apparatus and appliance rose　significantly. In this favorable environment, GE decided to strengthen its export effort. It, however, met with stiff competition from Westinghouse Corporation (WH). In order to compete with WH, GE needed to adapt its own manufacturing facilities to the exporting business. GE then absorbed IGEC and changed its managing structure into a multidivisional one...|$|R
2500|$|Once {{an offer}} is made, {{the general rule}} is the offeree must {{communicate}} her acceptance {{in order to have}} a binding <b>agreement.</b> <b>Notification</b> of acceptance must actually reach a point where the offeror could reasonably be expected to know, although if the recipient is at fault, for instance, by not putting enough ink in their fax machine for a message arriving in office hours to be printed, the recipient will still be bound. This goes for all methods of communication, whether oral, by phone, through telex, fax or email, except for the post. Acceptance by letter takes place when the letter is put in the postbox. The postal exception is a product of history, and does not exist in most countries. It only exists in English law so long as it is reasonable to use the post for a reply (e.g. not in response to an email), and its operation would not create manifest inconvenience and absurdity (e.g. the letter goes missing). In all cases it is possible for the negotiating parties to stipulate a prescribed mode of acceptance. It is not possible for an offeror to impose an obligation on the offeree to reject the offer without her consent. However, it is clear that people can accept through silence, firstly, by demonstrating through their conduct that they accept. In Brogden v Metropolitan Railway Company, although the Metropolitan Railway Company had never returned a letter from Mr Brogden formalising a long term supply arrangement for Mr Brogden's coal, they had conducted themselves for two years as if it were in effect, and Mr Brogden was bound. Secondly, the offeror may waive the need for communication of acceptance, either expressly, or implicitly, as in Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Company. Here a quack medicine company advertised its [...] "smoke ball", stating that if a customer found it did not cure them of the flu after using it thrice daily for two weeks, they would get £100. After noting the advertisement was serious enough to be an offer, not mere puff or an invitation to treat, the Court of Appeal held the accepting party only needed to use the smokeball as prescribed to get the £100. Although the general rule was to require communication of acceptance, the advertisement had tacitly waived the need for Mrs Carlill, or anyone else, to report her acceptance first. In other cases, such as where a reward is advertised for information, the only requirement of the English courts appears to be knowledge of the offer. Where someone makes such a unilateral offer, they fall under a duty to not revoke it once someone has begun to act on the offer. Otherwise an offer may always be revoked before it is accepted. The general rule is that revocation must be communicated, even if by post, although if the offerree hears about the withdrawal from a third party, this is as good as a withdrawal from the offeror himself. Finally, an offer can be [...] "killed off" [...] if, rather than a mere inquiry for information, someone makes a counter offer. So in Hyde v Wrench, when Wrench offered to sell his farm for £1000, and Hyde replied that he would buy it for £950 and Wrench refused, Hyde could not then change his mind and accept the original £1000 offer.|$|R
