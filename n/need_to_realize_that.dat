5000|$|The {{bottom up}} {{approach}} is another effective policy learning method. This approach will help policy makers to evaluate if the policy goals {{are open to}} more than one interpretation rather than being stated clearly (Birkland, 2011).  Does the policy have statue or law that was passed by a legislative body or is the policy considered as a set of laws, rules, practices, norms such as energy policy or criminal procedure, will the policy goals conflict within the same policy and how will the policy affect the implementation of the street level bureaucrats (Birkland, 2011). Policy makers will have to ask the street level bureaucrats about their goals, strategies, activities and then develop a technique of identify the local, regional, national actors who will be involved in the planning, financing and execution of the government policy (Birkland, 2011 & Sabatier, 1986). This bottom up approach starts from the street level bureaucrats and moves up to the top policy makers in {{the public and private sectors}} and if the policy faces push back policy makers will have to be open to negotiations or a compromise to achieve the policy goals (Birkland, 2011 & Sabatier, 1986).

30|$|Also, the {{parameter}} distension medium {{should be}} interpreted with caution due to a number of missing data, as the simulator tended not to register fluid use during all placements. Further refinement of the software and scoring systems is therefore necessary. Incorrectly placed devices were mainly caused by placing them too deeply into the tubes, whereby the coils were not visible in the uterine cavity after deployment. The fact that novices scored high percentages for correctly placed devices might be explained by the observation that those participants without any hysteroscopy experience tended to adhere more closely to any practical advice given during device placement, in contrast to the more experienced groups. In addition, one <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> the assessment of the participants’ experience was self-reported and therefore is subject to recall bias. Also, the division into three levels of experience could be seen as a potential source of bias since the norm of both sufficient hysteroscopy and sterilization experience must be met to be classified as an expert.|$|R
