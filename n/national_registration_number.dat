40|$|Asmall {{number of}} studies have {{examined}} directly the relationship between use of hormonal replacement therapy and risk of hip fracture (table B- 1). These studies, all of which are of observational design, found a lower incidence of hip fracture in estrogen users versus nonusers, although the differences in incidence did not always reach statistical significance. The largest and most complete study of hormonal replacement therapy and hip fracture incidence was of a cohort of approximately 23, 000 users of hormonal replacement therapy from the Uppsala Health Care Region of Sweden (14). The Uppsala Health Care Region comprises six counties and one-sixth of the total population of Sweden. The authors included in the cohort all women living in the region who were age 35 years and older (mean age 53. 7 years at study entry) and who filled at least one prescription for a noncontraceptive estrogen-containing preparation between April 1977 and March 1980. HRT users were identified through the region’s prescription record database, which includes records of prescriptions filled at all pharmacies within the region.

40|$|The {{natural history}} of {{localized}} prostate cancer is not fully understood. In most patients the tumor will never progress to a lethal disease, while a subset of patients will ultimately die of the disease. Efficient tools to separate indolent from lethal disease is currently lacking which means that many patients will be offered treatment without any benefit, but still be at risk of experiencing treatment related side effects. The aims of these studies were to get more insight into the {{natural history of}} untreated localized prostate cancer, to assess the prognostic value of established clinical parameters such as Gleason score, nuclear grade and tumor volume and, moreover, some new prognostic markers Ki- 67, AMACR and MUC- 1. We also aimed to study time trends in the detection of incidental tumors in Sweden. Patients with localized disease (n= 223) and no initial treatment were followed for 21 years. Most patients had a favorable outcome. However, a subset of patients developed lethal disease even beyond 15 years of follow-up and these patients define the group that may benefit most from treatment with curative intent. Patients with poorly differentiated tumors experienced a 9 time higher risk of dying in prostate cancer. The studies on prognostic markers are based on a cohort of patients (n= 253) with incidental prostate cancer detected by transurethral resection for presumed benign hyperplasia. All patients were left without initial treatment. Gleason grade, nuclear grade and tumor volume turned all out to be independent prognostic factors. MUC- 1, AMACR and Ki- 67 also carried prognostic information. However, after adjustment for Gleason grade, nuclear grade and tumor volume only MUC- 1 and AMACR remained as statistically significant prognostic factors. When tested for sensitivity and specificity they all failed and, consequently, they seem to be of less value in daily practice for cancelling an individual patient regarding the choice of treatment. Time trends in incidental prostate tumors in Sweden were analyzed in a cohort of patients with prostate tumors detected by transurethral resection (TUR-P). Through linkage of the <b>national</b> <b>registration</b> <b>number</b> (NRN) with several registers, e. g. the Swedish Cancer Registry, the National Inpatient registry and the Cause of Death Registry we identified, during the period 1970 through 2003, in total 23288 patients with incidental prostate cancer, who constituted the study group. As comparison group we choose all patients diagnosed with prostate cancer between 1970 - 2003 excluding those with incidental cancer, in total 112204 patients. Our result confirms earlier findings {{that there has been a}} dramatic change over time in incidence of incidental prostate cancers in Sweden, which parallels the introduction of prostate specific antigen. We also found that the cumulative incidence of prostate cancer death is high in the incidental group, opposing earlier findings that incidental tumours are a non-lethal disease...|$|E
40|$|The overall {{objectives}} of this thesis were {{to study the}} natural history for Oral Lichen (OLL), Oral Leukoplakia (OL) and Snus Induced Lesions (SIL) and to correlate cancer and mortality among users and non-users of Swedish moist snuff (snus) The population sub-sample comprised a historic cohort of 20, 333 individuals, established in 1973 - 74. At the time for follow-up, data on 20, 212 wore still available. The cohort was followed for 27 - 29 years. Using the <b>National</b> <b>Registration</b> <b>Number,</b> a unique identifier for each individual in Sweden, the dataset {{was linked to the}} nationwide registers of the Total Population, Migration, Cancer and Deaths- all of which had been in operation for at least 15 years prior to cohort accrual. For the nearly 30 year follow-up, in the first three papers, a sub-section of the cohort was selected, based on district of residence in 1973 - 74. This restriction was introduced in order to facilitate the subsequent field-work. when the cohort members were to be re-examined. Those who were still alive and residing in the area were offered a reexamination and 289 (68 %) of the 422 invited individuals accepted. The register-based follow-up with data from The Cancer Register revealed oral cancer in one individual in the OLL cohort and three individuals each in the OL and SIL cohorts. There was no statistically significant increase for oral cancer in the three sub-cohorts. The clinical re-examination disclosed that around 40 % of the lesions recorded in 1973 - 74 were no longer clinically detectable. For the OLL cohort this could be explained by the putative relapsing nature of the lesion and that there were no differentiations made between Oral Lichen Planus and Oral Lichenoid Reactions where a trigger factor might be present. For the OL cohort there was a strong association with smoking cessation and the disappearance of the lesion. Snus use was strongly associated with the appearance of SIL. In all cases where the individual reported cessation of using smis the lesion was no longer clinically discernible. In the fourth study the subjects comprised all males from the original cohort (9, 976). Tobacco habits (snus use and/or smoking) were used as exposure and cancer and mortality as outcome. The data set was linked to the health and population-based registers. Cancer had been notified to the cancer register for 1, 575 of the subjects (only initial notification of cancer detected after day of entry into the study was included); 3, 630 had died during the follow-up time. There was a statistically significant higher cancer incidence for those who were or had been daily smokers than for those who had never smoked (IRR 1. 26, 95 % CI 1. 13 - 1. 40). However, no such difference emerged with respect to snus habits (IRR 1. 00). With respect to oropharyngeal cancer, there was a statistically significantly higher incidence among those who were or had been snus users compared to those who had never used snus, based on 11 exposed cases (IRR 3. 1, 95 % CI 1. 5 - 6. 6). For mortality ever daily smoking was strongly associated with death within the categories all cause mortality, cancer death, circulatory death and respiratory death. Among ever daily snus users there was a 10 % increase for all cause mortality compared to never snus users. The following conclusions may be drawn from these results: There is no support for an increased incidence of oral cancer at the lesion sites. Both appearance and location of OLL change over time. There is a strong association between OL and smoking. The presence of SIL may be considered a marker for the use of snus. Use of smis seems to {{have a negative effect on}} health. It is associated with some increased risk for oropharyngeal cancer and overall mortality...|$|E

40|$|The present work {{consist of}} two major parts. The first part, {{extending}} over chapters 1, 2, 3 and 4, addresses the design and construction of a device capable of determining the shell thickness and the core size for monolayer spherical particles in a flow. The second part containing chapters 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10, concentrate {{on the use of}} Raman spectroscopy as a space application, namely for use as a tool for in situ planetary investigations. This part directly addresses the MIRAS project, a study run under the auspices of Federal Ministry of Education and Research, BMBF and German Aerospace Center, DLR under <b>national</b> <b>registration</b> <b>number</b> 50 OW 0103. MIRAS stands for "Mineral Investigation by in situ Raman Spectroscopy". Microcapsule Sizing by Elastic Light Scattering The industrial development of processes based on microcapsules depends on the possibility to provide clear and complete information about the properties of these microcapsules. However, the tools for an easy and efficient determination of the microcapsule properties are lacking, several methods being often required to describe adequately the microcapsule behavior. Methods for evaluating the individual size and size distribution of both the core and the shell are required together with methods for measuring the mechanical strength, stability in appli-cation media, permeability of the shell, etc. Elastic light scattering measurements provide a possible way of determining properties such as core size, shell size and refractive index. The design and con-struction of a device capable of measuring the above mentioned parameters for a core-shell particle is the subject of {{the first part of this}} thesis. The basic principle of measurement for the device proposed here consists of an-alyzing one particle at a time by recording the elastic light scattering pattern at angles between approx. 60 and 120 grad. By comparing the experimentally recorded phase functions with the previously calculated phase functions stored in a database, the geometry of the scattering object can be identified. In our case the geometry is characterized by two parameters: the shell thickness and the core radius. In chapter 2 a short overview on the methods used for sizing microparticles is given. Different sizing methods are compared, and the advantages and disadvan-tages for the general problem of sizing are shortly discussed. It is observed that all sizing methods that are based on elastic light scattering theories are ensemble methods. Chapter 3 focusses on the theories used for calculating the theoretical scattering patterns with emphasize on the Mie theory. The generalization of Mie theory for layered particles is shortly presented and the far field intensity approximations are discussed. The last chapter (4) of this first part describes the experimental approach for building an automatic microcapsule sizer. The approach started by O. Sbanski [76] with the development of a software packet for calculating and storing theoret-ical phase functions for core-shell particles was continued with the designing and construction of a measuring device. The hardware construction and the software with all implemented corrections imposed by the individual setup components are described in detail. For the laser, the monochromaticity, the intensity profile of the beam as well as the planarity of the equi-phase fronts are taken into consid-eration. The flow cell with three different designs is described, and the influences of the employed design on the light scattering patterns are discussed together with the optical system used for recording the experimental phase functions. The detection system formed by two identical linear CCD arrays is presented together with the software approach used for data acquisition. Ways of improving the quality and the speed of the analyzing process are discussed. The final section presents measurements run on samples made of homogeneous spheres and also on samples containing industrial microcapsules. Mineral Investigation by in situ Raman Spectroscopy The envisaged future planetary missions require space-born instruments, which are highly miniaturized with respect to volume and mass and which have low needs of power. A micro Raman spectrometer as a stand alone device on a planetary surface (e. g. Mars) offers a wide spectrum of possibilities. It can assess the chemical analysis via determination of the mineral composition, detect organic molecules in the soil, identify the principal mineral phases, etc. The technical developments in the last years have introduced a new generation of small Raman systems suitable for robotic mineral characterization on planetary surfaces [20, 95]. Two different types of spectrometer were considered for the MIRAS study. As supporting laboratory experiments for the MIRAS study, the measure-ments on standard minerals and on SNC Mars meteorites are discussed in chapter 6. The following SNC meteorites have been investigated: Sayh al Uhaymir 060, Dar al Gani 735, Dar al Gani 476, Northwest Africa 856, Los Angeles, Northwest Africa 1068 and Zagami. Pyrite as a hitherto undescribed phase in the picritic (olivin-phyric) shergottite NWA 1068 as well as reduced carbon (e. g. graphite) and anatase in the shergottite Say al Uhaymir 060 are new findings for this class of meteorites. A detailed description of the proposed designs for MIRAS, with the compo-nents used for building the test version on a breadboard is covered in chapter 7. The scientific as well as the mission requirements imposed on the instrument are discussed. The basic design is presented and the main components that are brought together to build the device being the laser unit, the Raman head, the Rayleigh filtering box, and the spectral sensor (spectrometer with a matching de-tector) are described. The two proposed designs, one based on an acousto-optic tunable filter (AOTF) and the other based on a dispersive hadamard transform spectrometer are compared to each other. The actual breadboard setup with the detailed description of the components follows in Section 7. 3. Further de-velopment of a Raman spectrometer for planetary investigations is proposed in combination with a microscope as part of the Extended-MIRAS project. The software developed for controlling the breadboard version of MIRAS is described in chapter 8 together with a short description of the structure of a relational database used for in house spectra management. The measuring pro-cedures and the data processing steps are presented. Spectra acquired with the MIRAS breadboard version based on the AOTF are shown in chapter 9. The final chapter addresses a rather different possibility of using Raman spectroscopy for planetary investigations. The chapter summarizes the content of four tech-nical notes that were established within the study contracted by the European Space Agency with firma Kayser-Threde in Munich concerning the possibility of applying Raman spectroscopy in the field of remote imaging. Die vorliegende Arbeit besteht aus zwei Hauptteilen. Der erste Teil, der die Kapitel 1, 2, 3 und 4 umfasst, beschäftigt sich mit dem Design und Aufbau eines Gerätes, welches in der Lage sein sollte, die Schalendichte und die Kerngröße von geschichteten Kugeln in einer Strömung festzustellen. Der zweite Teil, der aus den Kapiteln 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 und 10 besteht, befasst sich mit der Raman-Spektroskopie als Anwendung in der Raumfahrt, und zwar mit deren Einsatz bei in-situ-planetarischen Erforschungen. Dieser Teil bezieht sich direkt auf das MIRAS-Projekt, eine vom Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung (BMBF) und dem Deutschen Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt (DLR) unter der nationalen Eintragsnummer 500 W 0103 geförderte Studie. MIRAS steht für "Mineral Investigations by in situ Raman Spectroscopy". Größenbestimmung der Mikrokapseln mittels elastischer Lichtstreuung Der industrielle Fortschritt der auf Mikrokapseln basierenden Prozesse hängt mit der Möglichkeit zusammen, eindeutige und komplette Informationen über die Eigenschaften dieser Mikrokapseln zu liefern. Es gibt allerdings kaum Instrumente zur schnellen und effizienten Feststellung der Eigenschaften von Mikrokapseln. Zahlreiche Methoden sind häufig notwendig, um das Verhalten von Mikrokapseln ausreichend zu beschreiben. Man braucht Methoden zur Auswertung der indi-viduellen Größe und der Größenverteilung von Kern und Schale sowie zur Messung der mechanischen Eigenschaften, Stabilität in Anwendungsmedien, Schalenper-meabilität usw. Die Messungen des elastischen Streulichts stellen eine mögliche Methode dar, Eigenschaften wie Kerngröße, Schalengröße und Brechungsindex festzulegen. Das Design und der Aufbau eines Gerätes, das die obengennanten Parame-ter für eine Mikrokapsel messen kann, bilden das Thema des ersten Teils dieser Arbeit. Das grundlegende Messprinzip für das hier vorgeschlagene Gerät besteht in der Analyse einzelner Kapseln, indem das Streuungsmuster des elastischen Lichts bei Winkeln zwischen ca. 60 und 120 grad aufgezeichnet wird. Werden die expe-rimentell aufgezeichneten Phasenfunktionen mit den vorher berechneten Streu-ungsmustern in der Datenbank verglichen, so kann die Geometrie des Streuung-sobjektes identifiziert werden. In unserem Fall wird die Geometrie durch zwei Parameter gekennzeichnet: die Schalendichte und den Kernradius. In Kapitel 2 wird ein kurzer Überblick über die Methoden zur Festlegung der Größe von Mikrokapseln gegeben. Es werden verschiedene Methoden miteinander verglichen und Vorteile bzw. Nachteile für das Allgemeinproblem der Größenbes-timmung werden kurz angesprochen. Es wird festgestellt, dass alle Methoden, denen die Theorien der elastischen Lichtstreuung zugrundeliegen, "Ensemble-Methoden" sind. Kapitel 3 beschreibt die Theorien, die oft auf die Berechnung der theoretischen Streuungsmuster angewandt werden, wobei hier die Mie-Theorie im Mittelpunkt steht. Die Erweiterung der Mie-Theorie auf geschichtete Kugeln wird hier kurz geschildert und die Vereinfachungen der Fernfeldstärke werden diskutiert. Das letzte Kapitel (4) dieses ersten Teils befasst sich mit dem experimentellen Projekt zum Aufbau eines automatischen Mikrokapselanalysators. Das von O. Sbanski [76] begonnene Projekt mit der Entwicklung eines Softwarepakets zur Berechnung und Speicherung von theoretischen Phasenfunktionen für Mikrokapseln wurde mit dem Entwurf bzw. dem Aufbau eines Messgerätes fortgesetzt. Die Hardware und die Software mit allen für die individuellen Elemente des Aufbaus benötigten Korrekturen werden ausführlich beschrieben. Für den Laser werden Monochromatizität, Strahlstärkeprofil sowie die Planarität von gleichphasigen Wellenfronten berücksichtigt. Die Strömungszelle mit drei verschiedenen Designs wird geschildert. Einflüsse des eingesetzten Entwurfs auf die Eigenschaften der Lichtstreung sowie das optische, zur Aufzeichnung experimenteller Phasenfunktionen verwendete System werden diskutiert. Das aus zwei identischen linearen CCD-Arrays bestehende Detektionssystem wird zusammen mit der zur Datenaufnahme verwendeten Software präsentiert. Es werden gleichfalls einige Methoden zur Verbesserung der Qualität bzw. Geschwindigkeit des Analyseprozesses angesprochen. Der letzte Teil beschreibt Messungen, welche an homogenen Kugeln sowie industriellen Mikrokapseln durchgeführt wurden. MIRAS - "Mineral Investigation by in situ Raman Spectroscopy" Die für die Zukunft vorausgesehenen planetarischen Missionen benötigen Instru-mente, die in Bezug auf Volumen und Gewicht extrem stark miniaturisiert sind und wenig Energie brauchen. Ein Mikro-Ramanspektrometer als allein operieren-des Gerät auf der planetarischen Oberfläche (z. B. Mars) bietet ein breites Spek-trum von Möglichkeiten an. Es kann die chemische Analyse durch Festlegung der mineralischen Zusammensetzung auswerten, organische Moleküle im Boden ausweisen, die mineralischen Hauptphasen identifizieren usw. Die technischen Entwicklungen der letzten Jahre haben eine neue Generation kleiner Raman-systeme mit sich gebracht, welche für die mineralische Charakterisierung von planetarischen Oberflächen geeignet sind. Für die MIRAS-Studie wurden zwei verchiedene Typen von Spektrometern berücksichtigt. In Kapitel 6 werden die Messungen von Standardmineralien und SNC-Marsmeteoriten als unterstützende Laborexperimente behandelt. Folgende SNC-Meteorite sind untersucht worden: Sayh al Uhaymir 060, Dar al Gani 735, Dar al Gani 476, Northwest Africa 856, Los Angeles, Northwest Africa 1068 und Zagami. Pyrit als eine bis jetzt unbeschriebene Phase in dem Picritic (Olivin-Phyric) Shergottit NWA 1068 sowie reduzierter Kohlenstoff (z. B. Graphit) und Anatase in dem Shergottit Say al Uhaymir 060 sind neue Erkenntnisse für diese Meteoritenklasse. Eine detaillierte Beschreibung der vorgeschlagenen Entwürfe für MIRAS mit den Bauteilen, die zum Aufbau der Testversion eines Breadboard verwendet wurden, wird in Kapitel 7 geliefert. Es werden sowohl die wissenschaftlichen als auch die Missionsanforderungen an das Gerät diskutiert. Der Grundentwurf wird vorgeführt, wobei die einzelnen Hauptbauteile des Gerätes die Laserein-heit, den Ramankopf, das Rayleigh-Filtersystem und das Spektrometer (mit einem passenden Detektor) darstellen. Die zwei vorgeschlagenen Entwürfe, der eine basierend auf einem akusto-optisch einstellbaren Filter (AOTF), der andere hingegen auf einem dispersiven Hadamard-Transformationsspektrometer werden miteinander verglichen. Der tatsächliche Breadboard-Aufbau sowie eine detaillierte Beschreibung der Bauteile folgen in Unterkapitel 7. 3. Es wird ein weiteres Entwicklungskonzept für ein Raman-Spektrometer in Bezug auf planetarische Untersuchungen, im Zusammenhang mit einem Mikroskop als Teil des erweiterten MIRAS-Projektes, vorgeschlagen. Das für die Kontrolle der MIRAS Breadboard-Version entwickelte Programm samt der Struktur einer zum internen Spektrummanagement verwendeten rela-tionelen Datenbank werden in Kapitel 8 vorgestellt. Die Messprozeduren und die Datenbearbeitungsvorgänge werden zusammen beschrieben. Die mit der auf AOTF basierenden MIRAS Breadboard-Version aufgenommenen Spektren sind in Kapitel 9 abgebildet.

Despite widespread support of paramedics joining other registered health practitioners under the <b>National</b> <b>Registration</b> and Accreditation Scheme, New South Wales continues to oppose. Methods: This paper considers the New South Wales submission to the Senate Committee’s inquiry into {{the establishment of a}} <b>national</b> <b>registration</b> system for Australian paramedics. It evaluates the reasons for New South Wales Health’s opposition to <b>national</b> <b>registration.</b> Results: New South Wales Health’s reasons for opposing <b>national</b> paramedic <b>registration</b> includes the cost to implement a registration scheme, the desire to maintain vocational entry to employment and the purported efficiency of their current regulatory system. Conclusion: NSW Health’s position fails to address the challenges of employer-based regulation and the significant public protection benefit of national statutory regulation...|$|R

Therefore, foreign born citizens of South Korea do not automatically receive a resident <b>registration</b> <b>number</b> {{even after they}} obtain their Korean passports through Korean diplomatic offices. Foreign born citizens can have resident <b>registration</b> <b>numbers</b> with seventh digit of 9, 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 by visiting South Korea and registering their births, but the South Korean Immigration Bureau considered foreign born citizens with overseas permanent resident status as foreigners and did not issue a resident <b>registration</b> <b>number</b> with seventh digit of 9, 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 to foreign born citizens with overseas permanent resident status. Since a resident <b>registration</b> <b>number</b> with seventh digit of 9, 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 is required to exercise rights of citizenship, citizens without a resident <b>registration</b> <b>number</b> were not guaranteed rights of citizenship except diplomatic protection.|$|R

40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis verifies {{random allocation}} of <b>registration</b> <b>number</b> of {{vehicles in the}} capital city of Prague. The aim is to determine whether vehicles with attractive <b>registration</b> <b>number</b> have a statistically significantly higher purchase price, which disproves random allocation. The second aim is to verify whether vehicles with attractive <b>registration</b> <b>number</b> statistically significantly use the left lane in the driving direction, which is the lane designated for overtaking. The data needed to verify these hypotheses was gained by two day measuring during which were captured more than 4, 000 vehicles. From footbridge over the Nuselský Bridge in Prague were recorded passing vehicles using the camera. From the entire sample were randomly generated 184 vehicles. For cars was estimated the purchase price in the time of allocation of <b>registration</b> <b>number.</b> The numerical combinations of <b>registration</b> <b>numbers</b> were divided into three categories according to attractiveness. These categories were compared with each other in the three models based on their average prices. According to measurement results we can at one percent significance level reject the null hypothesis and say that at this level of significance are not the <b>registration</b> <b>numbers</b> allocated randomly. The result of the fourth model is not statistically significant. It did not confirm that the vehicles with an attractive <b>registration</b> <b>number</b> use more left lane in the direction of travel...|$|R
