A parametric path of the end-eector of a non-redundant manipulator determines the corresponding path in the mani-pulator joint-space. The optimization problem therefore reduces to n-ding the optimum distribution of the parameter of the path in time. The proposed optimization scheme is based on discretization of the di-stribution of the parameter into a xed number of points, and <b>nding</b> <b>their</b> optimum locations by methods of constrained nonlinear program-ming.

40|$|Models are {{presented}} for the optimal location of hubs in airline networks, which {{take into consideration}} the congestion e,ects. Hubs, which are typically the most congested airports, are modeled as M=D=c queuing systems. A formula is derived for the probability of a number of customers in the system, which is later used to propose a capacity constraint. This constraint limits the probability of more than b airplanes in queue, to be smaller than or equal to a given value. Due to the computational complexity of the formulation, the model is solved using a heuristic based on tabu search. Computational experience is presented together with an example using a data set available in the literature. Scope and purpose In order to take advantage of economies of scale, most major airlines have selected some airports as transshipment points (hubs). As hubs become congested, the usual hub siting techniques fail in 4 <b>nding</b> <b>their</b> best locations.

40|$|Objective: The illness {{perceptions}} of the relatives of patients with functional neurological symptom disorders (FNSDs) and their relation to the illness {{perceptions of}} the patients have been little studied. We aimed to compare illness perceptions of relatives of patients with FNSDs with those held by patients themselves. We used control pairs with neurological diseases (NDs) to examine the specificity of the findings to FNSDs. Material and methods: Patients with FNSDs (functional limb weakness and psychogenic nonepileptic seizures) and patients with NDs causing limb weakness and epilepsy, {{as well as their}} relatives, completed adapted versions of the Illness Perception Questionnaire - Revised (IPQ-R). Results: We included 112 pairs of patients with FNSDs and their relatives and 60 pairs of patients with <b>NDs</b> and <b>their</b> relatives. Relatives of patients with FNSDs were more likely to endorse psychological explanations and, in particular, stress as causal factors than patients with FNSDs (p. <. 001). Relatives of patients with FNSDs were also more pessimistic about the expected duration of the disorder and perceived a greater emotional impact compared with patients themselves (p. <. 001). However, the latter two differences between patients and relatives were also found in pairs of patients with <b>NDs</b> and <b>their</b> relatives. Conclusion: The main difference in illness perceptions between relatives and patients that appeared specific to FNSDs was a tendency for relatives to see psychological factors as more relevant compared with patients. Some other differences were observed between pairs of patients with FNSDs and their relatives, but the same differences were also seen in pairs of patients with <b>NDs</b> and <b>their</b> relatives. These other differences were, therefore, not specific to FNSDs. Discussion about possibly relevant psychological factors with patients suffering from FNSDs may be helped by including relatives...|$|R

The treatments were 3 levels of nitrogen (N) fertiliser (0, 46, and 92 kg/ha) and 3 heights at cutting (cutting was done when the grass reached 0. 5, I, and 1. 5 m above the ground).

40|$|The musicological {{tradition}} places Liszt’s Sonata in B minor {{within the}} sphere of compositions inspired by the Faustian myth. Its musical material, its structure and its narrative exhibit certain similarities to the ‘Faust’ Symphony. Yet there has appeared a diff erent and, one may say, a rival interpretation of Sonata in B minor. What is more, it is well-documented from both a musical and a historical point of view. It has been presented by Hungarian pianist and musicologist Tibor Szász. He proposes the thesis that the Sonata in B minor has been in fact inspired by Milton’s Paradise Lost, with its three protagonists: Adam, Satan and Christ. He fi <b>nds</b> <b>their</b> illustrations and even some key elements of the plot in the Sonata’s narrative. But yet Milton’s Paradise Lost and Goethe’s Faust are both stories of the Fall and Salvation, of the cosmic struggle between good and evil. The triads of their protagonists – Adam and Eve, Satan, and Christ; Faust, Mephisto and Gretchen – are homological. Thus both interpretations of the Sonata, the Goethean and the Miltonian, or, in other words, the Faustian and the Luciferian, are parallel and complementary rather than rival. It is also highly probable that both have had {{their impact on the}} genesis of the Sonata in B minor...|$|R
