5|$|Although the bat's {{status in}} Myanmar is <b>not</b> <b>well</b> <b>known,</b> the Thai {{population}} {{is restricted to}} a single province and {{may be at risk}} for extinction. Its potential threats are primarily anthropogenic, and include habitat degradation and the disturbance of roosting sites.|$|E
5|$|Currently, {{the most}} {{significant}} and long-term threat to the Thai population could be the annual burning of forest areas, which is most prevalent during the bat's breeding season. In addition, the proposed construction of a pipeline from Myanmar to Thailand may have a negative impact. Threats to the Myanmar population are <b>not</b> <b>well</b> <b>known.</b>|$|E
5|$|Hugh was <b>not</b> <b>well</b> <b>known</b> as a scholar. He did, however, {{serve as}} a patron to Roger of Hoveden, the medieval chronicler who started writing about 1169. He also {{commissioned}} two large Bibles, one of which still remains at Durham and is considered a masterpiece of book creation. This is Durham Cathedral Library Manuscript A. II. 1.|$|E
60|$|Alaric was so {{astonished}} at this monstrous request, coming {{as it did}} after such a conversation, that he did <b>not</b> <b>well</b> <b>know</b> how to take it.|$|R
60|$|I {{appealed to}} my friends if they knew any thing about the tradition; I thought they seemed rather {{reluctant}} to speak of it. O, there was some foolish story, they believed; they did <b>not</b> <b>well</b> <b>know</b> what it was.|$|R
60|$|This dance over, Phyllis's partner did <b>not</b> <b>well</b> <b>know</b> how {{to dispose}} of her, and she grew rather frightened on finding that none of her sisters were in sight. At last she {{perceived}} Reginald standing on the bank, and made her escape to him.|$|R
5|$|The {{great auk}} was never {{observed}} and described by modern scientists during its existence, {{and is only}} known from the accounts of laymen, such as sailors, so its behaviour is <b>not</b> <b>well</b> <b>known</b> and difficult to reconstruct. Much may be inferred from its close, living relative, the razorbill, {{as well as from}} remaining soft tissue.|$|E
5|$|The {{turquoise}} parrot {{is considered}} sedentary {{and does not}} migrate, though its movements are <b>not</b> <b>well</b> <b>known.</b> Birds are present in some areas all year, though in northern Victoria they are thought to move into more open areas outside the breeding season. Some populations may be locally nomadic, following availability of water.|$|E
5|$|A {{nest box}} {{can also be}} {{regarded}} as an animal surveillance device. Surveilling animals {{can lead to the}} discovery of new scientific and industrial fields. For example, biologists and engineers can work on barn owl surveillance techniques and devices, while social scientists document the practices that cause humans to observe an animal. While the diet of the barn owl has been studied, other areas like breeding success are <b>not</b> <b>well</b> <b>known.</b> Nest boxes provide direct physical access to the breeding location.|$|E

5|$|Atlantic Monthly Press, in {{cooperation}} with Little, Brown and Company beginning in the 1970s, republished the albums based on the British translations. Alterations were made to vocabulary <b>not</b> <b>well</b> <b>known</b> to an American audience (such as gaol, tyre, saloon, and spanner). , Little, Brown and Company (owned by the Hachette Book Group USA) continues to publish Tintin books in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{construction}} of I-70 the San Rafael Swell was relatively inaccessible and <b>not</b> <b>well</b> <b>known</b> or explored. There were, however, a few efforts to protect the swell as early as 1935. Since {{the construction}} of the freeway the number of visitors to the swell has increased significantly, as the swell can now be accessed by automobile. As such, several groups are increasing efforts for protected status of the area, via National Park, National Monument or wilderness designation.|$|E
5|$|Causes {{of death}} of adult ibis are <b>not</b> <b>well</b> <b>known.</b> Alligators could feasibly prey on nesting ibises {{but there has}} been little {{research}} in the area. A flock of fifty adult American white ibis were killed in a fire in the Everglades. The corpses were found in a dense swathe of cattail (Typha angustifolia), which suggested they had taken shelter there. It is unclear why they {{had not been able to}} fly away from the fire, but one hypothesis was that they had been foraging for insects disturbed by the fire.|$|E

5|$|MOA-2009-BLG-387Lb is an {{exoplanet}} in {{the orbit}} of the red dwarf MOA-2009-BLG-387L. Its discovery was announced on February 21, 2011, making it the eleventh planet discovered using gravitational microlensing. The planet {{is thought to be}} over twice the mass of Jupiter and to have an orbit 80 percent larger than that of Earth's, lasting approximately 1,970 days. However, its exact characteristics are difficult to constrain because the characteristics of the host star are <b>not</b> <b>well</b> <b>known.</b>|$|E
5|$|Migratory {{patterns}} of these subspecies are <b>not</b> <b>well</b> <b>known.</b> For example, pygmy blue whales {{have been recorded}} in the northern Indian Ocean (Oman, Maldives and Sri Lanka), where they may form a distinct resident population. Furthermore, sightings have been recorded from elsewhere in and adjacent to Arabian Sea, including from Gulf of Aden, Persian Gulf, coasts of Bay of Bengal including Bangladesh to Myanmar, and within the Strait of Malacca. The first official confirmation within Thailand's EEZ occurred at Trang in 2013.|$|E
5|$|Mindaugas, {{the duke}} who governed {{southern}} Lithuania between the Neman and Neris Rivers, eventually became {{the founder of}} the state. Mindaugas {{is referred to as the}} ruler of all Lithuania in the Livonian Rhymed Chronicle in 1236. The means by which he managed to acquire this title are <b>not</b> <b>well</b> <b>known.</b> Russian chronicles mention that he murdered or expelled various other dukes, including his relatives.|$|E

5|$|Olivier {{had been}} {{attempting}} to broaden his film career. He was <b>not</b> <b>well</b> <b>known</b> in the United States despite {{his success in}} Britain, and earlier attempts to introduce him to American audiences had failed. Offered the role of Heathcliff in Samuel Goldwyn's production of Wuthering Heights (1939), he travelled to Hollywood, leaving Leigh in London. Goldwyn and the film's director, William Wyler, offered Leigh the secondary role of Isabella, but she refused, preferring the role of Cathy, which went to Merle Oberon.|$|E
5|$|Prior to 1906, shoe polish was <b>not</b> <b>well</b> <b>known</b> as a purchasable product, {{nor was it}} {{particularly}} sophisticated. While {{sales were}} not especially high, a few brands, like Nugget, were available in the U.K. during the 19th century. The practice of shining people’s shoes gradually caught on and soon many shoeshine boys in city streets were offering shoe shines using a basic form of shoe polish along with a polishing cloth.|$|E
5|$|Quadras, who was {{interested}} in sports, started writing the screenplay for the film in 2011, which took two years to complete. Quadras arranged a meeting with Kom via her manager in the year he started writing the script. Kumar went to Manipur to meet Kom and seek her permission to make the film. Initially, Kom {{was surprised by the}} development as the sport, especially women's boxing, was <b>not</b> <b>well</b> <b>known</b> in India. However, she was enthusiastic about the idea.|$|E
50|$|Caracciolo was {{respected}} and <b>well</b> <b>known</b> by his colleagues {{rather than by}} the public in general because he chose to hold a low profile. He was heard extensively on radio and appeared occasionally on television, but his music was <b>not</b> <b>known</b> <b>well</b> <b>known</b> outside Argentina and Uruguay.|$|R
6000|$|The lines {{addressed}} to Stella speak for themselves. [...] "Cadenus and Vanessa" [...] was meant as polite and courteous admonition to Miss Hester Van Homrigh, {{a young lady}} in whom green-sickness seems to have produced devotion to Swift in forms that embarrassed him, and with which he did <b>not</b> <b>well</b> <b>know</b> how to deal.|$|R

5|$|The {{blue whale}} rose from {{relative}} obscurity in the 1970s, {{after the release}} of the Songs of the Humpback Whale. The difference between the humpback and the blue whale was <b>not</b> <b>well</b> <b>known</b> to most people, who conflated the species in their minds. To many listeners, the haunting songs seemed like a cry for help. Environmentalists developed the image of a lonely blue whale singing out in an empty ocean, since whalers had nearly hunted the species to extinction.|$|E
5|$|The {{brighter}} {{star of the}} Pleione binary pair, component A, is a hot type B star 190 {{times more}} luminous than the Sun. It is classified as Be star with certain distinguishing traits: periodic phase changes and a complex circumstellar environment composed of two gaseous disks at different angles to each other. The primary star rotates rapidly, close to its breakup velocity, even faster than Achernar. Although some research on the companion star has been performed, stellar characteristics of the orbiting B component are <b>not</b> <b>well</b> <b>known.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{purple-throated cotinga}} is <b>not</b> <b>well</b> <b>known</b> {{and appears to}} be {{naturally}} uncommon or rare across a widespread area; however, it is almost certainly under-reported due to its canopy lifestyle. The IUCN considers this species to be a species of Least Concern due in part to its large range. While the IUCN has not estimated the population size, it believes it is declining due to habitat loss.|$|E
