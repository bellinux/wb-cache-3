Moderate to good yields have been achieved in the cross-coupling of potassium cyclopropyltrifluoroborate with benzyl chlorides possessing electron-donating or electron-withdrawing substituents. Benzyl chloride was also successfully cross-coupled to potassium alkoxymethyltrifluoroborates derived from primary, secondary, and tertiary alcohols. Cyclopropyl groups are of great interest because of their occurrence in many natural products and synthesized drug molecules. 1, 2 Phenylethoxy moieties are also important in bioactive compounds because they can enhance molecular properties, in particular the solubility, of drug molecules. 3, 4, 5 Both cyclopropyl and phenylethoxy subunits also present the advantage of preventing the metabolic breakdown of active pharmaceutical ingredients. <b>Cross-coupling</b> <b>approaches</b> to introduce these subunits into aliphatic core structures can present difficulties because alkyl-alkyl Suzuki-Miyaura coupling reactions remain a challenge. 6, 7 Indeed, alkyl halides are less reactive toward oxidative addition than their unsaturated analogues. 8 In the past fifteen years, diverse boronic acids and alkylboronate...|$|R
40|$|The {{synthesis}} of new analogues of 1 alpha, 25 -dihydroxyvitamin D 3 containing a carbamate function at the A-ring fragment {{has been described}} using the <b>cross-coupling</b> <b>approach.</b> The carbamate group was selectively introduced at the C- 3 position by regioselective enzymatic alkoxycarbonylation of A-ring enyne 3 and subsequent treatment with ammonia, amines, amino alcohols, and amino acids. Biological studies to evaluate the potency of all five of these carbamate analogues were performed and demonstrated very low binding affinity for the vitamin D receptor compared with 1 alpha, 25 -dihydroxyvitamin D 3. Moreover, all the carbamate analogues were less active than 1 alpha, 25 -dihydroxyvitamin D 3 in inhibiting cell proliferation or stimulating cell differentiation. Of all the five analogues, the 3 -O-carbamoyl- 1 alpha, 25 -(OH) 2 -D 3 analogue 10 a was the most potent one in vitro.

During her independent career at Princeton, her group identified catalytic cross-coupling reactions with styrenyl epoxides and aziridines as electrophiles and pioneered several other important transformations using Ni-based catalysts.

Moreover, she identified a novel ligand class that showed unique electronic properties to a transition metal catalyst for cross-coupling catalysis.
