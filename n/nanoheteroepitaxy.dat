40|$|The {{ability to}} grow {{dissimilar}} materials with large lattice mismatches {{on a single}} substrate removes the integration related constraints of incorporating photonics with electronics. We review our recent <b>nanoheteroepitaxy</b> efforts on the epitaxial growth of bridged InP NWs between two vertical, (111) -oriented Si surfaces by forming connections during the NW growth facilitating their direct electrical probing via Si electrodes and a new method of synthesizing III-V NWs on a non-single crystalline surface that directly relaxes any lattice matching conditions. The current-voltage behavior with temperature and the resulting photo-enhanced thermal failure is also discussed...|$|E
40|$|In this letter, {{we explore}} {{in detail the}} {{potential}} of <b>nanoheteroepitaxy</b> to controllably fabricate high quality GeSn nano-structures and to further improve the crystallinity of GeSn alloys directly grown on Si(001). The GeSn was grown by molecular beam epitaxy at relatively high temperatures up to 750 degrees C on pre-patterned Si nano-pillars embedded in a SiO 2 matrix. The best compromise between selective GeSn growth and homogenous Sn incorporation of 1. 4 % was achieved {{at a growth temperature}} of 600 degrees C. X-ray diffraction measurements confirmed that our growth approach results in both fully relaxed GeSn nano-islands and negligible Si interdiffusion into the core of the nanostructures. Detailed transmission electron microscopy characterizations show that only the small GeSn/Si interface area reveals defects, such as stacking faults. Importantly, {{the main part of the}} GeSn islands is defect-free and of high crystalline quality. The latter was further demonstrated by photoluminescence measurements where a clear redshift of the direct CC-CV transition was observed with increasing Sn content...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Metalorganic {{vapor phase}} {{epitaxial}} (MOVPE) growth of GaN on nanopatterned AGOG sapphire substrates was per-formed, {{and characteristics of}} the light-emitting diode (LED) de-vices grown on patterned sapphire and planar substrates were compared. The nanopatterned sapphire substrates were fabricated by a novel process (AGOG) whereby aluminum nanomesas were epitaxially converted into crystalline Al 2 O 3 via a two-stage anneal-ing process. The GaN template grown on the nanopatterned sap-phire substrate was done via an abbreviated growth mode, where a 15 -nm thick, low-temperature GaN buffer layer was used, {{without the use of}} an etch-back and recovery process during the epitaxy. In-GaN quantum wells (QWs) LEDs were grown on the GaN template on the nanopatterned sapphire, employing the abbreviated growth mode. The optimized InGaN QW LEDs grown on the patterned AGOG sapphire substrate exhibited a 24 % improvement in output power as compared to LEDs on GaN templates grown using the conventional method. The increase in output power of the LEDs is attributed to improved internal quantum efficiency of the LEDs.

40|$|Our recent {{experimental}} results of Ge <b>nanoheteroepitaxy</b> (NHE) on Si nanopillars (NPs) are reviewed {{to confirm the}} possibility of relaxed Ge growth on Si without misfit dislocations (MDs) formation by elastic deformation. Selective Ge growth is performed by using reduced pressure chemical vapor deposition (CVD) on two types of Si NPs with thermal SiO 2 or CVD SiO 2 sidewalls and on Si nanoislands (NIs) on SiO 2. By using thermal SiO 2 sidewall, compressive strain is generated in the Si pillar and fixed by the thermal SiO 2. This results in an incoherent Ge growth on Si NPs due to MD formation. By using CVD SiO 2 sidewall, tensile strain formation due to thermal expansion during prebake for Ge epi process is observed. However, strain in Si due to Ge growth is not dominant. By introducing a Si 0. 5 Ge 0. 5 buffer layer, no MD and stacking faults are observed by cross section TEM. The shape of Ge on Si NPs becomes more uniform due to improved crystal quality. On Si NIs on SiO 2, a clear compliance effect is observed after Ge growth. Coherent growth of Ge on Si is also realized on Si NIs by using Si 0. 5 Ge 0. 5 buffer...|$|E
40|$|Over 20 % of the {{electricity}} in the United States is consumed for lighting, {{and the majority of}} this energy is wasted as heat during the lighting process. A solid-state (or light emitting diode (LED) -based) light source has the potential of saving the United States billions of dollars in electricity and reducing megatons of global CO 2 emissions annually. While white light LEDs are currently on the market with efficiencies that are superior to incandescent and fluorescent light sources, their high up-front cost is inhibiting mass adoption. One reason for the high cost is the inefficiency of green and amber LEDs that can used to make white light. The inefficiency of green and amber LEDs results in more of these chips being required, and thus a higher cost. Improvements in the performance of green and amber LEDs is also required in order to realize the full potential of solid-state lighting. <b>Nanoheteroepitaxy</b> is an interesting route towards achieving efficient green and amber LEDs as it resolves major challenges that are currently plaguing III-nitride LEDs such as high dislocation densities and limited active region critical thicknesses. A method for fabricating III-nitride nanopyramid LEDs is presented that employs conventional processing used in industry. The present document begins with an overview of the current challenges in III-nitride LEDs and the benefits of <b>nanoheteroepitaxy.</b> A process for controlled selective-area growth of nanopyramid LEDs by organometallic vapor phase epitaxy has been developed throughout the course of this work. Dielectric templates used for the selective-area growth are patterned by two methods, namely porous anodic alumina and electron-beam lithography. The dielectric templates serve as efficient dislocation filters; however, planar defects are initiated during lower temperature growth on the nanopyramids. The quantum wells outline six semipolar planes that form each hexagonal pyramid. Quantum wells grown on these semipolar planes generate built-in electric fields with magnitudes that are one-tenth those on the polar c-plane with the same (In,Ga) N composition. The lateral strain relaxation innate in the nanoheterostructures allows greater coherent InN incorporation in the nanopyramids as compared to thin-film heterostructures, as confirmed by electroluminescence and transmission electron microscopy. In addition to applications for light emitting diodes, selective area growth of GaN nanostructures is also important for biological and sensing applications. A process for fabricating porous GaN nanorods is presented that also relies on selective-area organometallic vapor phase epitaxy. The nanopore walls are primarily outlined by nonpolar planes, and the diameter of the nanopore can be controlled by the diameter of the opening in the dielectric template and the growth time. The lining of the nanopore walls is comprised of crystalline GaN, which makes these structures interesting for sensing, electrical and optical applications. ...|$|E
40|$|Cadmium {{telluride}} (CdTe) doped with zinc (Zn) {{has been}} used for the fabrication of X-ray imaging devices. CdTe allows the device to have the same image quality at a lower X-ray dose. When silicon is used as a substrate for CdTe growth, this reduces the cost and allows the readout circuitry to be fabricated on the same substrate. However, material quality and device performance needs to be addressed since the lattice parameters of CdTe (6. 482 Å) and Si (5. 431 Å) result in a 19 % lattice mismatch. ^ In this work, CdTe doped with Zn is deposited on Si (211) and Si (111) substrates by the closed-space sublimation (CSS) technique. The CSS method has an advantage over other techniques in terms of cost and growth rate, but represents a challenge when growing high quality films. The <b>nanoheteroepitaxy</b> (NHE) technique makes it possible to grow CdTe on Si substrates with fewer defects at the CdTe/Si interface and in the resulting epilayer. Electron beam lithography is used to pattern three different pillar diameters (200 nm, 100 nm, and 50 nm) on Si substrates (Si(211) and Si(111)), and two different pitch to diameter ratios (p/d= 3 and p/d= 2) to examine the growth of CdTe doped with 5 and 10 percent Zn. ^ Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) is used to examine the morphology of the CdTe growth and X-ray diffraction (XRD) is used to identify the orientation of the film {{and the quality of the}} structure of the CdTe film doped with 5 % Zn. TEM characterization is used to examine the planar structure at the interface, the misorientation at interface and the type of defects in the CdTe film growth. SEM results indicate when the pitch/diameter pattern ratio is decreased from 3 to 2, the morphology of the CdTe growth is improved. As expected and confirmed with XRD data, the quality improves as the pattern diameter is reduced, especially when Zn doping is increased from 5 % to 10 %. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is used to study the CdTe/Si interface and the resulting misorientation of the CdTe/Si interface, ranges from 0. 2 ° to 1. 2 °. ...|$|E
40|$|Thin film heterostructures {{are limited}} by a maximum {{critical}} thickness before introduction of extended defects. One-dimensional form factors like nanowires/nanorods, due {{to the possibility of}} lateral elastic relaxation, can tolerate much larger lattice mismatch than their thin film counterparts. The present document begins with the description of some modeling work employing solution thermodynamics and finite element analysis as a motivation to the <b>nanoheteroepitaxy</b> approach to achieve a monolithic phosphor-free white light emitting diode (LED). A nanorod with a pointed tip morphology {{has been shown to be}} required for pushing the emission wavelengths from the InN-GaN system to longer values (red). The process developed to synthesize diameter controlled GaN pyramidal tipped nanorods without the use of any catalysts has also been developed in the course of the present research work. The same template-based process along with optical lithography techniques has been demonstrated to yield controlled nanorod diameter variation on the same substrate. Due to the large surface-area-to-volume ratio of the synthesized nanorods, it is required to ascertain that the nanorods are not devoid of charge carriers due to the surface depletion effect. Electrical characterization of the nanorods in the form of single and multiple GaN nanorod Schottky and p-n junctions diodes employing conductive atomic force microscopy has also been performed and described in the document. Finally, cathodoluminescence spectra from (In,Ga) N nanorods have been used to show the potential of the nanorod form to incorporate higher InN mole fractions as compared to thin film counterparts. Along with applications in solid-state lighting, the pointed tip morphology of the nanorods, resulting in a very high field enhancement factor, are contenders as field emitters. Coupled with such a high field enhancement factor, the incorporation of (Al,Ga) N on the nanorod tip helps to reduce the effective surface work function resulting in a significant reduction in the turn-on field from (Al,Ga) N/GaN nanorod heterostructures as compared to GaN nanorods. Such an approach circumvents the doping problem of (Al,Ga) N, still utilizing its low electron affinity. Results from vacuum field emission experiments from (Al,Ga) N/GaN nanorod heterostructures and their analysis have also been presented in the document. ...|$|E
