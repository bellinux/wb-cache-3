25|$|The Vitali theorem on the {{existence}} of <b>non-measurable</b> sets which states that there is a subset of the real numbers that is not Lebesgue measurable.|$|E
25|$|If the axiom {{of choice}} {{is assumed to be}} true, it can be proved that not all subsets of Euclidean space are Lebesgue measurable; {{examples}} of such sets include the Vitali set, and the <b>non-measurable</b> sets postulated by the Hausdorff paradox and the Banach–Tarski paradox.|$|E
25|$|<b>Non-measurable</b> lesions – {{all other}} lesions, {{including}} small lesions (longest diameter <20nbsp&mm with conventional techniques or <10nbsp&mm with spiral CT scan), i.e., bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusion, inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonis, cystic lesions, and also abdominal masses {{that are not}} confirmed and followed by imaging techniques.|$|E
25|$|Unlike most theorems in geometry, {{the proof}} of this result depends in a {{critical}} way on the choice of axioms for set theory. It can be proven using the axiom of choice, which allows {{for the construction of}} <b>non-measurable</b> sets, i.e., collections of points that do not have a volume in the ordinary sense, and whose construction requires an uncountable number of choices.|$|E
25|$|In Fig. 5-2, person A is in a spaceship, {{far from}} any massive objects, that {{undergoes}} a uniform acceleration of g. Person B is {{in a box}} resting on Earth. Provided that the spaceship is sufficiently small so that tidal effects are <b>non-measurable</b> (given the sensitivity of current gravity measurement instrumentation, A and B presumably should be Lilliputians), there are no experiments that A and B can perform which {{will enable them to}} tell which setting they are in.|$|E
25|$|Another {{argument}} against the axiom of choice is that it implies the existence of objects that may seem counterintuitive. One example is the Banach–Tarski paradox which {{says that it is}} possible to decompose the 3-dimensional solid unit ball into finitely many pieces and, using only rotations and translations, reassemble the pieces into two solid balls each with the same volume as the original. The pieces in this decomposition, constructed using the axiom of choice, are <b>non-measurable</b> sets.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, {{consider}} {{for instance}} the unit circle S, {{and the action}} on S by a group G consisting of all rational rotations. Namely, these are rotations by angles which are rational multiples ofπ. Here G is countable while S is uncountable. Hence S breaks up into uncountably many orbits underG. Using the axiom of choice, we could pick a single point from each orbit, obtaining an uncountable subset X of S with the property that all of its translates by G are disjoint fromX. The set of those translates partitions the circle into a countable collection of disjoint sets, which are all pairwise congruent. Since X is not measurable for any rotation-invariant countably additive finite measure on S, finding an algorithm to select a point in each orbit requires the axiom of choice. See <b>non-measurable</b> set for more details.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, in the Banach–Tarski paradox {{the number of}} pieces is finite and the allowed equivalences are Euclidean congruences, which {{preserve}} the volumes. Yet, somehow, they end up doubling {{the volume of the}} ball! While this is certainly surprising, some of the pieces used in the paradoxical decomposition are <b>non-measurable</b> sets, so the notion of volume (more precisely, Lebesgue measure) is not defined for them, and the partitioning cannot be accomplished in a practical way. In fact, the Banach–Tarski paradox demonstrates {{that it is impossible to}} find a finitely-additive measure (or a Banach measure) defined on all subsets of a Euclidean space of three (and greater) dimensions that is invariant with respect to Euclidean motions and takes the value one on a unit cube. In his later work, Tarski showed that, conversely, non-existence of paradoxical decompositions of this type implies the existence of a finitely-additive invariant measure.|$|E

(As a counterexample, if {{one does}} not assume {{continuity}} or measurability, {{it is possible to}} prove the existence of an everywhere-discontinuous, <b>non-measurable</b> function with this property by using a Hamel basis for the real numbers over the rationals, as described in Hewitt and Stromberg.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Remark 2. The {{convergence}} {{of the sequence}} and domination by g can be relaxed to hold only almost everywhere provided the measure space [...] is complete or f is chosen as a measurable function which agrees [...] everywhere with the [...] everywhere existing pointwise limit.

2500|$|The naive {{probabilistic}} intuition used by Freiling tacitly {{assumes that}} there is a well-behaved way to associate a probability to any subset of the reals. [...] But the mathematical formalization of the notion of [...] "probability" [...] uses the notion of measure, yet the axiom of choice implies the existence of <b>non-measurable</b> subsets, even of the unit interval. [...] Some examples of this are the [...] Banach–Tarski paradox and the existence of Vitali sets.|$|E
2500|$|The {{existence}} of sets {{that are not}} Lebesgue measurable {{is a consequence of}} a certain set-theoretical axiom, the axiom of choice, which is independent from many of the conventional systems of axioms for set theory. [...] The Vitali theorem, which follows from the axiom, states that there exist subsets of R that are not Lebesgue measurable. [...] Assuming the axiom of choice, <b>non-measurable</b> sets with many surprising properties have been demonstrated, such as those of the Banach–Tarski paradox.|$|E
2500|$|Measure {{theory was}} {{initially}} created {{to provide a}} useful abstraction {{of the notion of}} length of subsets of the real line—and, more generally, area and volume of subsets of Euclidean spaces. In particular, it provided a systematic {{answer to the question of}} which subsets of [...] have a length. As later set theory developments showed (see <b>non-measurable</b> set), it is actually impossible to assign a length to all subsets of [...] in a way that preserves some natural additivity and translation invariance properties. [...] This suggests that picking out a suitable class of measurable subsets is an essential prerequisite.|$|E
2500|$|If p(ω) = 0 for all ω∈Ω (in this case, Ω must be uncountable, because {{otherwise}} P(Ω)=1 {{could not be}} satisfied), then equation (∗) fails: {{the probability of a}} set is not the sum over its elements, as summation is only defined for countable amount of elements. This makes the probability space theory much more technical. A formulation stronger than summation, measure theory is applicable. Initially the probabilities are ascribed to some “generator” sets (see the examples). Then a limiting procedure allows assigning probabilities to sets that are limits of sequences of generator sets, or limits of limits, and so on. All these sets are the σ-algebra [...] For technical details see Carathéodory's extension theorem. Sets belonging to [...] are called measurable. In general they are much more [...] complicated than generator sets, but much better than <b>non-measurable</b> sets.|$|E
2500|$|Technically, {{a measure}} is a {{function}} that assigns a non-negative real number or +∞ to (certain) subsets of a set [...] It must assign 0 to the empty set and be (countably) additive: the measure of a 'large' subset that can be decomposed into a finite (or countable) number of 'smaller' disjoint subsets, {{is the sum of}} the measures of the [...] "smaller" [...] subsets. In general, if one wants to associate a consistent size to each subset of a given set while satisfying the other axioms of a measure, one only finds trivial examples like the counting measure. This problem was resolved by defining measure only on a sub-collection of all subsets; the so-called measurable subsets, which are required to form a -algebra. This means that countable unions, countable intersections and complements of measurable subsets are measurable. <b>Non-measurable</b> sets in a Euclidean space, on which the Lebesgue measure cannot be defined consistently, are necessarily complicated in the sense of being badly mixed up with their complement. Indeed, their existence is a non-trivial consequence of the axiom of choice.|$|E
