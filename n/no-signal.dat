It draws on Yakir Aharonov's retrocasual weak measurements to explain many-particle entanglement in a special relativistic way {{without the need for}} configuration space. The basic idea was already published by Costa de Beauregard in the 1950s and is also used by John Cramer in his transactional interpretation except the beables that exist between the von Neumann strong projection operator measurements. Sutherland's Lagrangian includes two-way action-reaction between pilot wave and beables. Therefore, it is a post-quantum non-statistical theory with final boundary conditions that violate the <b>no-signal</b> theorems of quantum theory. Just as special relativity is a limiting case of general relativity when the spacetime curvature vanishes, so, too is statistical no-entanglement signaling quantum theory with the Born rule a limiting case of the post-quantum action-reaction Lagrangian when the reaction is set to zero and the final boundary condition is integrated out.|$|E

Finally, using the set of newly derived <b>no-signaling</b> inequalities a result with potential cryptographic consequences is proven: if different parties use identical devices, then, once they have perfect correlations at spacelike separation between dichotomic observables, they know that because of <b>no-signaling</b> the local marginals cannot but be completely rando...|$|R
40|$|We {{formulate}} {{a series of}} non-trivial equalities which are satisfied by all <b>no-signaling</b> correlations, meaning that no faster-than-light communication is allowed with the resource of these correlations. All quantum and classical correlations satisfy these equalities since they are <b>no-signaling.</b> By applying these equalities, we provide a general framework for solving the multipartite "guess your neighbor's input" (GYNI) game, which is naturally <b>no-signaling</b> but shows conversely that general <b>no-signaling</b> correlations are actually more non-local than those allowed by quantum mechanics. We confirm the validity of our method for number of players from 3 up to 19, thus providing convincing evidence that it works for the general case. In addition, we solve analytically the tripartite GYNI and obtain a computable measure of supra-quantum correlations. This result simplifies the defined optimization procedure to an analytic formula, thus characterizing explicitly the boundary between quantum and supra-quantum correlations. In addition, we show that the gap between quantum and <b>no-signaling</b> boundaries containing supra-quantum correlations can be closed by local orthogonality conditions in the tripartite case.

5000|$|When {{developed}} in the mid-1800s, Morse code telegraphy was first used for signaling over wires and underwater cables. With the introduction of wireless (radio) by Guglielmo Marconi in the early 1900s Morse code was quickly adapted to the new radio technology giving rise to radiotelegraphy. Morse code's channel code, known as on-off keying or OOK modulation, is also known in modern channel code parlance as unipolar encoding. Unipolar encoding is the simplest form of amplitude modulation (AM) composed of only two amplitudes; the two amplitudes known generically as [...] "on" [...] and [...] "off". The [...] "off" [...] state is simply a <b>no-signal</b> silent period the [...] "on" [...] state is simply a full power signal. Signaling using OOK by keying a single frequency radio carrier, as opposed to using damped transient oscillations triggered by spark gaps as originally developed by Marconi, historically then became known as continuous wave or simply CW signaling instead of spark; the nomenclature CW being inappropriate as it happens, since the keyed radio carrier is certainly not continuous because of the ubiquitous silent periods present in the OOK modulation generated by the Morse code! Historically CW has also been known as wireless telegraphy (W/T), or simply as radiotelegraphy. Modern era radio amateurs (hams) usually refer {{to the use of}} keyed carrier Morse code simply as [...] "CW". It is the presence of the ubiquitous silent (off) periods in CW that is {{the most important aspect of}} the Morse code OOK modulation code that provides the [...] "listen while sending" [...] support for so-called QSK operation.|$|E

40|$|Recently {{the first}} {{physically}} realistic protocol amplifying the randomness of Santha-Vazirani sources using {{a finite number}} of <b>no-signaling</b> devices and with a constant rate of noise has been proposed, however there still remained the open question whether this can be accomplished under the minimal conditions necessary for the task.

Here, we solve this problem and present the first device-independent protocol for the task of randomness amplification of Santha-Vazirani sources using a device consisting of only two non-signaling components. We show that the protocol can amplify any such source that is not fully deterministic into a totally random source while tolerating a constant noise rate and prove the security of the protocol against general <b>no-signaling</b> adversaries. The minimum requirement for a device-independent Bell inequality based protocol for obtaining randomness against <b>no-signaling</b> attacks is that every <b>no-signaling</b> box that obtains the observed Bell violation has the conditional probability P(x|u) of at least a single input-output pair (u,x) bounded from above.

40|$|This paper studies a {{generalization}} of multi-prover interactive proofs {{in which a}} verifier interacts with two competing teams of provers: one team attempts to convince the verifier to accept while the other attempts to convince the verifier to reject. Each team consists of two provers who jointly implement a <b>no-signaling</b> strategy. <b>No-signaling</b> strategies are a curious class of joint strategy that cannot in general be implemented without communication between the provers, yet cannot {{be used as a}} black box to establish communication between them. Attention is restricted in this paper to two-turn interactions in which the verifier asks questions of each of the four provers and decides whether to accept or reject based on their responses. We prove that the complexity class of decision problems that admit two-turn interactive proofs with competing teams of <b>no-signaling</b> provers is a subset of PSPACE. This upper bound matches existing PSPACE lower bounds on the following two disparate and weaker classes of interactive proof: 1. Two-turn multi-prover interactive proofs with only one team of <b>no-signaling</b> provers. 2. Two-turn competing-prover interactive proofs with only one prover per team. Our result implies that the complexity of these two models is unchanged by the addition of a second competing team of <b>no-signaling</b> provers in the first case and by the addition of a second <b>no-signaling</b> prover to each team in the second case.

Half the participants were told that the stimulus color conveyed a rule that could be exploited to improve performance, the other half were not.

Here, we study supra-quantum nonlocality for bipartite systems with two measurement settings and infinitely many outcomes per subsystem. We develop a formalism for generic <b>no-signaling</b> black-box measurement devices with continuous outputs in terms of probability measures, instead of probability distributions, which involves a few technical subtleties. We show the existence of a class of supra-quantum Gaussian correlations, which violate the Tsirelson bound of an adequate continuous-variable Bell inequality. We then introduce the continuous-variable version of the celebrated Popescu-Rohrlich (PR) boxes, as a limiting case of the above-mentioned Gaussian ones. Finally, we perform a characterisation of the geometry of the set of continuous-variable <b>no-signaling</b> correlations.

40|$|The <b>no-signaling</b> {{constraints}} {{state that}} the probability distribution of the outputs of any subset of parties is independent of the inputs of the complementary set; here we re-examine these {{to see how they}} arise from relativistic causality. We show that while the usual <b>no-signaling</b> constraints are sufficient, in general they are not necessary to ensure that a theory does not violate causality. Depending on the exact space-time coordinates of the measurement events in a multi-party Bell experiment, causality only imposes a subset of the usual <b>no-signaling</b> conditions. After revisiting the derivation of the two-party <b>no-signaling</b> constraints, we consider the three-party Bell scenario and characterise a space-time region in which a subset of the <b>no-signaling</b> conditions is sufficient to preserve causality. Secondly, we examine the implications for device-independent cryptography against an eavesdropper constrained only by the laws of relativity. We show an explicit attack in certain measurement configurations on a family of protocols based on the n-party Mermin inequalities that were previously proven secure under the old <b>no-signaling</b> conditions. We then show that security of two-party protocols can also be compromised when the eavesdropper's measurement configuration is not constrained. The monogamy of non-local correlations that underpin their use in secrecy can also be broken in certain space-time configurations. Thirdly, we inspect the notion of free-choice and propose a definition of free-choice in the multi-party Bell experiment. We then re-examine the question whether quantum correlations may admit explanations by finite speed superluminal influences. Finally, we study genuine multiparty non-locality and present a new class of causal bilocal models.

40|$|<b>No-Signalling</b> is a {{fundamental}} constraint on the probabilistic predictions made by physical theories. It is usually justified {{in terms of the}} constraints imposed by special relativity. However, this justification is not as clear-cut as is usually supposed. We shall give a different perspective on this condition by showing an equivalence between <b>No-Signalling</b> and Lambda Independence, or "free choice of measurements", a condition on hidden-variable theories which is needed to make no-go theorems such as Bell's theorem non-trivial. More precisely, we shall show that a probability table describing measurement outcomes is <b>No-Signalling</b> if and only if it can be realized by a Lambda-Independent hidden-variable theory of a particular canonical form, in which the hidden variables correspond to non-contextual deterministic predictions of measurement outcomes. The key proviso which avoids contradiction with Bell's theorem is that we consider hidden-variable theories with signed probability measures over the hidden variables - i. e. negative probabilities. Negative probabilities have often been discussed in the literature on quantum mechanics. We use a result proved previously in "The Sheaf-theoretic Structure of Locality and Contextuality" by Abramsky and Brandenburger, which shows that they give rise to, and indeed characterize, the entire class of <b>No-Signalling</b> behaviours. In the present paper, we put this result in a broader context, which reveals the surprising consequence that the <b>No-Signalling</b> condition is equivalent to the apparently completely different notion of free choice of measurements.
