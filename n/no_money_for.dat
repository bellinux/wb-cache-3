5|$|After {{she turned}} 15, Falle {{had her first}} {{experience}} in the sex industry {{at a party in}} a bar in Chinatown, Calgary. A 25-year-old man at the party who had forged identity documents convinced her to sell sex for money and give him half of her earnings. Falle found this man well-dressed and attractive and did not think that he fit the stereotypical image of a pimp. She had nowhere to sleep that night and had <b>no</b> <b>money</b> <b>for</b> food, so she accepted his offer. The man to whom she sold sex that night had teeth that were rotten. They had sex on a soiled mattress in a poorly-ventilated restaurant attic, and she received $100.|$|E
5|$|Natasha Falle {{grew up in}} {{a middle-class}} home in Nova Scotia; a suburb of Toronto, Ontario; and a suburb of Calgary, Alberta. Her mother managed stores in the wedding {{industry}} and her father was a police officer with a vice squad, arresting drug dealers and pimps. While she was growing up, Falle had multiple family members with addictions. When she was a young teenager, Falle's parents divorced, and she subsequently lived in a single-parent home with her mother. They moved into an apartment in downtown Toronto. Falle's father did not pay her mother alimony and there was often <b>no</b> <b>money</b> <b>for</b> food, so Falle began stealing food to survive.|$|E
5|$|Father John Buerlein (Jeremy Sisto) is the mild-mannered Catholic {{priest of}} a small parish in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Overworked and underpaid, he has grown jaded with the {{profession}} and has trouble connecting with his parishioners. During confession, a mysterious and unnamed prostitute (Kristin Chenoweth) confesses to a sin she has not yet committed: she plans to commit suicide on her birthday. Father John is taken aback. The confession ends abruptly, and {{he is unable to}} stop the woman before she disappears. He only knows she wears a crucifix and is an Aries, which means her birthday is soon. Father John grows obsessed with finding and helping this woman, and begins visiting the city's red-light district with the hopes of finding her. On his way home, Father John meets a homeless man named Gus (Gene Larche), but with <b>no</b> <b>money</b> <b>for</b> him, he gives him a rosary instead. Later, he seeks counsel from his friend Father Ralph O'Brien (Brian Baumgartner), who advises him not to become too personally involved.|$|E

5|$|By then, MacLaren was in {{financial}} difficulties. As an amateur, his expenses {{were covered by}} the tour organisers but he received <b>no</b> <b>money</b> <b>for</b> playing. To support him financially, the Lancashire committee had given him £100 before the tour. By the latter stages of the tour, his money was running out; {{most of it was}} probably spent betting on horse races, and he sent Lancashire a request for further money. Just before the final Test, he received a £60 advance on his expenses for the upcoming English season. For the fifth Test, he dropped down from opening the batting, which he had done throughout the series, to batting at number five, and responded with his first Test century. Batting with greater caution than usual, he scored 120 before accidentally standing on his own wicket. England won the match to take the series 3–2, amid great public interest in England and Australia. MacLaren scored 240 runs at 26.67 in the Test series, finishing fourth in the English averages. He performed more effectively in the lesser matches, and following some final tour fixtures, he totalled 803 runs at 47.23 in all first-class games. On the six-week outward journey MacLaren met (Kathleen) Maud Power, an Australian socialite and the daughter of a horse racing official. They were married in 1898.|$|E
5|$|In the General Government, the {{remaining}} schools were subjugated to the German educational system, {{and the number}} and competence of their Polish staff was steadily scaled down. All universities and most secondary schools were closed, if not immediately after the invasion, then by mid-1940. By late 1940, no official Polish educational institutions more advanced than a vocational school remained in operation, and they offered nothing beyond the elementary trade and technical training required for the Nazi economy. Primary schooling was to last for seven years, but the classes {{in the final two}} years of the program were to be limited to meeting one day per week. There was <b>no</b> <b>money</b> <b>for</b> heating of the schools in winter. Classes and schools were to be merged, Polish teachers dismissed, and the resulting savings used to sponsor the creation of schools for children of the German minority or to create barracks for German troops. No new Polish teachers were to be trained. The educational curriculum was censored; subjects such as literature, history and geography were removed. Old textbooks were confiscated and school libraries were closed. The new educational aims for Poles included convincing them that their national fate was hopeless, and teaching them to be submissive and respectful to Germans. This was accomplished through deliberate tactics such as police raids on schools, police inspections of student belongings, mass arrests of students and teachers, and the use of students as forced laborers, often by transporting them to Germany as seasonal workers.|$|E

25|$|No {{action was}} taken to {{implement}} the Senate Park Commission's proposal for 12 years. Congress finally enacted the Public Buildings Act on March 4, 1913, which, among other things, created and funded an Arlington Memorial Bridge Commission (AMBC) whose purpose was to design the bridge and report back to Congress. But due to the onset of World War I, Congress appropriated <b>no</b> <b>money</b> <b>for</b> the commission's operation and it remained inactive.|$|E

25|$|Although the new president, ex-captain Neville Crowe, had stabilised {{the club}} and scored a coup by persuading club legend Kevin Bartlett to coach, The club managed to stay solvent by cutting {{expenses}} to the bone and paying only two-thirds of the allowable salary cap. But there was <b>no</b> <b>money</b> <b>for</b> recruiting to improve an impoverished playing list. The club struggled {{to come to terms}} with the draft after its inception in 1986, and made a number of poor choices—notably, the number one pick in 1987 was used on a player who had only two games with Richmond.|$|E
25|$|A new {{building}} opened in 1883 at 10th and Minnesota streets. The building {{was the first}} high school built in Saint Paul. In 1888, a 14-room annex was added for laboratories, but there was <b>no</b> <b>money</b> <b>for</b> an astronomical observatory. The Debate society decided to put on plays {{to make up the}} money to pay for it. Soon, Central was known as the only high school in the United States to have a fixed telescope with a lens ground and polished by the great telescope maker Alvan Clark (18041887), whose company built some of the largest and best telescopes in the world, including the telescope for the Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona. Mechanics Arts High School, then known as Manual Training High School, was first housed in the basement of Central. The school was renamed Central High School in 1888.|$|E
25|$|Although Goddard {{had brought}} {{his work in}} {{rocketry}} {{to the attention of}} the United States Army, between World Wars, he was rebuffed, since the Army largely failed to grasp the military application of large rockets and said there was <b>no</b> <b>money</b> <b>for</b> new experimental weapons. German military intelligence, by contrast, had paid attention to Goddard's work. The Goddards noticed that some mail had been opened, and some mailed reports had gone missing. An accredited military attaché to the US, Friedrich von Boetticher, sent a four-page report to the Abwehr in 1936, and the spy Gustav Guellich sent a mixture of facts and made-up information, claiming to have visited Roswell and witnessed a launch. The Abwehr was very interested and responded with more questions about Goddard's work. Guellich's reports did include information about fuel mixtures and the important concept of fuel-curtain cooling, but thereafter the Germans received very little information about Goddard.|$|E

25|$|Although Congress did not {{formally}} adopt the McMillan Plan, {{it began to}} implement it piecemeal {{over the next several}} years. In 1910, Congress enacted legislation establishing the United States Commission of Fine Arts, a body of federally-appointed architects, landscape architects, and others who began to formally push for construction of the bridge envisioned by the McMillan Plan. On March 4, 1913, Congress enacted the Public Buildings Act which, among other things, created and funded an Arlington Memorial Bridge Commission whose purpose was to settle on a design for the bridge and report back to Congress. Its members included the President of the United States, President of the Senate, Speaker of the House of Representatives, and the chairs of the committees on public grounds and buildings of the House and Senate (or their designees). But Congress appropriated <b>no</b> <b>money</b> <b>for</b> the commission's operation due to the onset of World War I, and it remained inactive.|$|E
25|$|The City Commissioners, however, were undeterred {{in their}} desire to extend North Capitol Street. Although they knew federal law {{prohibited}} the use of cemetery land, on November 5, 1886, the commissioners claimed to have contacted the lotholders, {{a large majority of}} whom were said to favor the donation of cemetery land for the road. The commissioners had city legal counsel study whether they could condemn the land and accept it as a donation (as Congress had appropriated <b>no</b> <b>money</b> <b>for</b> the city to pay for the property). The city's chief attorney, Albert G. Riddle, reported that federal law barred the city from condemning the property. The only alternatives were for every single lotholder to give their approval for a donation of land or for the city to ask Congress to revise the corporation's charter. With neither option likely to happen, Commissioners William B. Webb and Samuel E. Wheatley agreed to cancel the extension of North Capitol Street.|$|E
25|$|Sandiford {{subsequently}} {{launched an}} appeal against the court's decision. She had funded her own defence costs {{during the initial}} trial but had <b>no</b> <b>money</b> <b>for</b> representation at appeal. Funds were subsequently raised {{to pay for an}} appeal lawyer, and the appeals procedure began. In the United Kingdom lawyers applied to seek a judicial review of the government's stance of not providing financial aid for Britons facing criminal proceedings overseas, but their legal challenge was dismissed by judges at the High Court of England and Wales on the grounds that Sandiford had little chance in successfully appealing the sentence. An appeal arguing the government's position was unlawful was also rejected. The British government submitted a statement to the Court in Bali alleging unlawful behaviour towards Sandiford by officials {{at the time of her}} arrest. The High Court in Bali rejected the first stage of Sandiford's appeal in April 2013, upholding the death sentence. An appeal was subsequently lodged with the country's Supreme Court, but in August this was also rejected.|$|E

25|$|The Land Element is the PNGDFs army land force, being {{primarily}} a light infantry force capable of conducting low-tempo operations only; {{it is the}} senior of the three services. The army has its origins in the Pacific Islands Regiment, which was formed in 1951 {{as a component of}} the Australian Army. Since independence, the army has become an indigenous organisation with its own traditions and culture. Nonetheless, the force has adopted foreign ideas on the roles and needs of an armed force, leading to proposals for armour, artillery and attack helicopters. However, the army faces severe budgetary problems and has therefore had virtually <b>no</b> <b>money</b> <b>for</b> operations, training, and maintenance or capital equipment upgrades. In this context, proposals to develop the army into a well equipped, mobile conventional land force, are unlikely in the near to medium term. The army's role is to protect against external aggression, provide for internal security in support of the police, and to carry out civic action and relief operations when required. The engineer battalion is used for civic action with construction and reticulation capabilities, while the two infantry battalions also constructs roads, bridges and other infrastructure in regions where commercial companies are unwilling to work for security reasons.|$|E
500|$|Benedict Arnold's {{father was}} a {{successful}} businessman, and the family moved in the upper levels of Norwich society. When he was ten, Arnold {{was enrolled in a}} private school in nearby Canterbury, with the expectation that he would eventually attend Yale. However, the deaths of his siblings two years later may have contributed to a decline in the family fortunes, since his father took up drinking. By the time that he was fourteen, there was <b>no</b> <b>money</b> <b>for</b> private education. His father's alcoholism and ill health kept him from training Arnold in the family mercantile business, but his mother's family connections secured an apprenticeship for him with her cousins Daniel and Joshua Lathrop, who operated a successful apothecary and general merchandise trade in Norwich. [...] His apprenticeship with the Lathrops lasted seven years.|$|E

Frustrated over Bart's latest prank and pressured by his supervisor Superintendent Chalmers, Principal Skinner challenges Chalmers to take over Bart's education. Chalmers accepts and immediately gives Bart his own lesson plan, which primarily consists of former U.S. president Theodore Roosevelt.
