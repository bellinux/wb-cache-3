5|$|Looms {{were not}} {{controlled}} by the guilds. Dependent on a migrant workforce, their commercial activity was driven by entrepreneurs, who were usually painters. The entrepreneur would locate and commission patrons, hold a stock of cartoons and provide raw materials such as wool, silk, and sometimes gold and silver – which often had to be imported. The entrepreneur was {{in direct contact with}} the patron, and they would often go through the <b>nuances</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> design at both the cartoon and final stages. This examination was often a difficult business and necessitated delicate management; in 1400 Isabeau of Bavaria rejected a completed set by Colart de Laon having earlier approved the designs, to de Laon's – and presumably his commissioner's – considerable embarrassment.|$|E

50|$|Another {{criticism}} of mnemonic {{techniques such as}} this is {{that they tend to}} assume a one-to-one relationship between the learner's first language and the target language. In reality, words often have a different range of meanings, and so the student must learn <b>the</b> complexity or <b>nuance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new words. For this reason, such techniques may be seen as a useful and powerful way to progress in the language, especially in the early stages, rather than giving a complete understanding.|$|R

25|$|It {{has been}} said that the <b>nuances</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> term {{reasonable}} may have allowed the UK courts to deal with the merits of grievances rather than questions of legality, and hence to engage in judicial policy-making. However, it seems that Singapore courts have so far avoided substituting their opinion for that of decision-makers in applying the Wednesbury test. In Lines International, the High Court clearly noted that in considering Wednesbury unreasonableness courts are not entitled to substitute their views of how the discretion should be exercised, nor is unreasonableness established if the court is of the view that the policy or guideline may not work as effectively as another. This principle has been adopted and emphasized in subsequent cases. In City Developments the court declined to interfere with the Chief Assessor's assessment of the annual value of the applicant's real property for property tax purposes, finding his explanations logical and commonsensical. The courts came to similar conclusions in Chee Siok Chin and Kang Ngah Wei.|$|E

500|$|In 2002, Hammond-Suzuki {{launched}} the New B-3, a recreation {{of the original}} electromechanical instrument using contemporary electronics and a digital tonewheel simulator. The New B-3 is constructed to appear like the original B-3, and the designers attempted to retain the subtle <b>nuances</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> familiar B-3 sound. Hammond-Suzuki promotional material states {{that it would be}} difficult for even an experienced B-3 player to distinguish between the old and new B-3 organs. A review of the New B-3 by Hugh Robjohns called it [...] "a true replica of an original B-3... in terms of the look and layout, and the actual sound." [...] The instrument project nearly stalled after a breakdown in negotiations between Japanese and United States staff, the latter of whom insisted on manufacturing the case in the United States and designing the organ to identical specifications to the original.|$|E

500|$|Although many popular commentators, {{including}} psychologist Margaret Singer, {{speculate that}} Applewhite brainwashed his followers, many academics have rejected the [...] "brainwashing" [...] label as an oversimplification {{that does not}} express the <b>nuances</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{process by which the}} followers were influenced. Lalich speculates that they were willing to follow Applewhite in suicide because they had become totally dependent upon him, and hence were poorly suited for life in his absence. Davis attributes Applewhite's success in convincing his followers to commit suicide to two factors: he isolated them socially and cultivated an attitude of complete religious obedience in them. Applewhite's students had made a long-term commitment to him, and Balch and Taylor infer that this is why his interpretations of events appeared coherent to them. Most of the dead had been members for about 20years, although there were a few recent converts.|$|E

McIlrath commented that Stevenson was the perfect person to produce the album, as he not only understood the <b>nuances</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> band, but was also their [...] "musical soul mate". Revolutions per Minute was the first album that McIlrath played guitar on.

500|$|In 2007, Parker {{played the}} role of Henry Lowe in the Denzel Washington-directed film, The Great Debaters. The {{character}} was based on the real-life debater, Henry Heights from Wiley College. Parker attended a debate boot camp to make his performance more authentic. He portrayed a multifaceted character. Stephen Holden of The New York Times described Parker's portrayal as having depicted a [...] "handsome, clean-cut youth with a lurking bad-boy streak". while John Clark of the New York Daily News described the role as that of a [...] "silver-tongued orator and ladies' man". Other reviewers also noted the <b>nuances</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> character. Parker also performed on the soundtrack. Parker and co-stars Forest Whitaker and Denzel Washington were all nominated for the 2008 NAACP Image Awards in the best supporting actor category, which Denzel Washington won.

500|$|Membership of a guild {{was highly}} {{restricted}} and access {{was difficult for}} newcomers. A master was expected to serve an apprenticeship in his region, and show proof of citizenship, which could be obtained through birth in the city or by purchase. Apprenticeship lasted four to five years, ending with {{the production of a}} [...] "masterpiece" [...] that proved his ability as a craftsman, and the payment of a substantial entrance fee. The system was protectionist at a local level through the <b>nuances</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fee system. Although it sought to ensure a high quality of membership, it was a self-governing body that tended to favour wealthy applicants. Guild connections sometimes appear in paintings, most famously in van der Weyden's Descent from the Cross, in which Christ's body is given the t-shape of a crossbow to reflect its commission for a chapel for the Leuven guild of archers.|$|E
500|$|Dawson {{described}} the prosthetics for the Klingon version of Torres as [...] "a forehead, nose, and teeth". She {{felt that the}} look was not as sophisticated as the character's normal appearance as a half-human/half-Klingon {{because of the lack}} of skin tones and <b>nuances</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> facial features. While Dawson's make-up typically took two hours to apply, the full Klingon prosthetics took around three hours. To save time reapplying the make-up and prosthetics repeatedly, each day's shooting would concentrate on one of the two characters, and switch the following day. Dawson compared the experience to repertory theatre. Despite the casting of the photo double, and attention to scheduling, Kolbe expressed disappointment in not being able to shoot more scenes with the two versions of Torres in the cave, but understood the frequent use of the split screen could negatively impact the production cost. After the episode had aired, Dawson called her parents to ask their opinions. They replied: [...] "ou were good, but the girl that played that Klingon was really great!" [...] Dawson took their remarks as a compliment.|$|E
500|$|Running {{eight minutes}} {{longer than any}} in the series, the episode was also the most {{technical}} and complex. Whedon, who has stated {{this is one of}} his favorite Buffy episodes, used a widescreen letterbox format for filming (the only episode in the series to get this treatment), different lighting to bring out the sets more vibrantly, and long takes for shooting—including a complicated shot with a full conversation, a song, and two choreographed dances that took 21 attempts to get right. These were designed to give viewers all the clues they needed to establish all the <b>nuances</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> relationships between characters. Davies commented that the intricacies of filming this episode were [...] "infinitely more complicated than a regular Buffy" [...] episode, and Whedon stated in the DVD commentary that he was ambitious to prove what television is capable of, saying [...] "it just depends how much you care". UPN, the television network that aired Buffys last two seasons, promoted the episode by displaying Gellar's face on billboards with music notes over her eyes, and held a special premiere event. Network president Dean Valentine remarked he thought it was [...] "one of the best episodes of television I ever saw in my life".|$|E
