5|$|The <b>normal</b> <b>force</b> {{is due to}} {{repulsive forces}} of {{interaction}} between atoms at close contact. When their electron clouds overlap, Pauli repulsion (due to fermionic nature of electrons) follows resulting in the force that acts in a direction normal to the surface interface between two objects. The <b>normal</b> <b>force,</b> for example, {{is responsible for the}} structural integrity of tables and floors as well as being the force that responds whenever an external force pushes on a solid object. An example of the <b>normal</b> <b>force</b> in action is the impact force on an object crashing into an immobile surface.|$|E
5|$|Friction is {{a surface}} force that opposes {{relative}} motion. The frictional force {{is directly related}} to the <b>normal</b> <b>force</b> that acts to keep two solid objects separated at the point of contact. There are two broad classifications of frictional forces: static friction and kinetic friction.|$|E
5|$|For {{an object}} in free-fall, this force is unopposed and the net force on the object is its weight. For objects not in free-fall, {{the force of gravity}} is opposed by the {{reaction}} forces applied by their supports. For example, a person standing on the ground experiences zero net force, since a <b>normal</b> <b>force</b> (a reaction force) is exerted by the ground upward on the person that counterbalances his weight that is directed downward.|$|E
30|$|Figure  19 {{shows that}} the maximum <b>normal</b> <b>forces</b> for the feet of leg 2 and leg 5 {{gradually}} decrease with {{the change in the}} initial angle, and their variable tendencies are equal. When the initial angle is 20 °, the maximum <b>normal</b> <b>forces</b> of the feet for leg 2 and leg 5 are larger than the other maximum <b>normal</b> <b>forces</b> of the feet. When the initial angle is 60 °, the minimum difference exists among the maximum <b>normal</b> <b>forces</b> of the feet. Based on Figures  9 and 19, it is concluded that the variable tendencies of the feet’s maximum <b>normal</b> <b>forces</b> are respectively corresponding to the same for legs 2, 4, and 6, when the step pitch is 0.3  m and the initial angle varies from 20 ° to 60 °.|$|R
30|$|Based on Figure  22, {{with the}} step pitch varying from 0.05  m to 0.2  m, {{it can be}} {{concluded}} that the curves of the maximum <b>normal</b> <b>forces</b> of the feet are mostly uniform for leg 2 and leg 5, for leg 3 and leg 4, and for leg 2 and leg 5, respectively. Meanwhile, the maximum <b>normal</b> <b>forces</b> of leg 2 and leg 5 are greater than other legs’ maximum <b>normal</b> <b>forces.</b> Figure  22 shows that the maximum <b>normal</b> <b>forces</b> of the feet gradually increase with the step pitch varying for legs 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6. Based on Figures  16 and 22, {{it can be concluded}} that the variable tendencies of maximum <b>normal</b> <b>forces</b> of the feet are respectively corresponding to the same for legs 2, 4, and 6, when the initial angle is 0 ° and the step pitch varies from 0.05  m to 0.2  m.|$|R
30|$|Based on Figure  21, {{it shows}} that the curves of the maximum <b>normal</b> <b>forces</b> of the feet present a {{gradually}} downward trend for leg 2 and leg 5, and gradually rising trends for the other legs, with the initial angle varying from 0 ° to 60 °. When the initial angle is in between 0 ° and 50 °, the maximum <b>normal</b> <b>forces</b> of the feet of leg 2 and leg 5 are greater than the maximum <b>normal</b> <b>forces</b> of the feet of other legs. The maximum <b>normal</b> <b>forces</b> of the feet are approximately equal to each other, when the initial angle is 60 °. Based on Figures  15 and 21, it can be found that the variable tendencies of the maximum <b>normal</b> <b>forces</b> of the feet are respectively corresponding to the same for legs 2, 4, and 6, when the step pitch is 0.2  m and the initial angle varies from 0 ° to 60 °.|$|R
5|$|The {{simplest}} case {{of static}} equilibrium occurs when two forces are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. For example, an object {{on a level}} surface is pulled (attracted) downward {{toward the center of}} the Earth by the force of gravity. At the same time, a force is applied by the surface that resists the downward force with equal upward force (called a <b>normal</b> <b>force).</b> The situation produces zero net force and hence no acceleration.|$|E
25|$|When the {{surfaces}} are conjoined, Coulomb friction becomes {{a very poor}} approximation (for example, adhesive tape resists sliding even {{when there is no}} <b>normal</b> <b>force,</b> or a negative <b>normal</b> <b>force).</b> In this case, the frictional force may depend strongly on the area of contact. Some drag racing tires are adhesive for this reason. However, despite the complexity of the fundamental physics behind friction, the relationships are accurate enough to be useful in many applications.|$|E
25|$|The {{contributions}} of Archard (1957) {{must also be}} mentioned in discussion of pioneering works in this field. Archard concluded that, even for rough elastic surfaces, the contact area is approximately proportional to the <b>normal</b> <b>force.</b> Further important insights along these lines were provided by Greenwood and Williamson (1966), Bush (1975), and Persson (2002). The main findings of these works were that the true contact surface in rough materials is generally proportional to the <b>normal</b> <b>force,</b> while the parameters of individual micro-contacts (i.e., pressure, size of the micro-contact) are only weakly dependent upon the load.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the analyses of thrust and <b>normal</b> <b>forces</b> of {{linear induction motor}} (LIM) segments which are implemented in a rotating ring system. To obtain magnetic levitation in a cost effective and sustainable way, decoupled control of thrust and <b>normal</b> <b>forces</b> is required. This study includes {{the design of a}} static test setup from which the measurement results are compared and verified with the derived analytical methods and finite element simulations. The comparison shows significant correlation of the thrust and <b>normal</b> <b>forces</b> as function of the slip frequency...|$|R
50|$|The {{pressure}} distribution {{acting on}} a body's surface exerts <b>normal</b> <b>forces</b> on the body. Those forces can be summed and the component of that force that acts downstream represents the drag force, , due to pressure distribution acting on the body. The nature of these <b>normal</b> <b>forces</b> combines shock wave effects, vortex system generation effects, and wake viscous mechanisms.|$|R
30|$|Three walking periods are {{respectively}} {{set for the}} heavy-duty six-legged robot in walking experiments of {{the tripod}} gait. The six-dimension force/torque sensors are employed to collect the <b>normal</b> <b>forces</b> of the feet for all six legs in real time, and the maximum <b>normal</b> <b>forces</b> of the feet are collected for every leg. The curves of the maximum <b>normal</b> <b>forces</b> of the feet for the six legs are respectively obtained with {{the change in the}} step pitch and initial angle of the abductor joint. While the experimental and theoretical results of the variable tendencies of the maximum <b>normal</b> <b>forces</b> are the same, it can be concluded that the experimental data is correct, and the theoretical analysis is reasonable. When the four kinds of typical tripod gaits are used for the walking experiments, the initial offset L′pi is set by 0.68  m, and the mass mR of cargo is set by 0  kg.|$|R
25|$|The Coulomb {{approximation}} mathematically {{follows from}} the assumptions that surfaces are in atomically close contact only over {{a small fraction of}} their overall area, that this contact area is proportional to the <b>normal</b> <b>force</b> (until saturation, which takes place when all area is in atomic contact), and that the frictional force is proportional to the applied <b>normal</b> <b>force,</b> independently of the contact area (you can see the experiments on friction from Leonardo da Vinci). Such reasoning aside, however, the approximation is fundamentally an empirical construct. It is a rule of thumb describing the approximate outcome of an extremely complicated physical interaction. The strength of the approximation is its simplicity and versatility. Though in general the relationship between <b>normal</b> <b>force</b> and frictional force is not exactly linear (and so the frictional force is not entirely independent of the contact area of the surfaces), the Coulomb approximation is an adequate representation of friction for the analysis of many physical systems.|$|E
25|$|Apart {{from any}} {{acceleration}} that might {{occur in the}} direction of the path, the lower panel of the image above indicates the forces on the ball. There are two forces; one is the force of gravity vertically downward through the center of mass of the ball mg, where m is the mass of the ball and g is the gravitational acceleration; the second is the upward <b>normal</b> <b>force</b> exerted by the road at a right angle to the road surface man. The centripetal force demanded by the curved motion is also shown above. This centripetal force is not a third force applied to the ball, but rather must be provided by the net force on the ball resulting from vector addition of the <b>normal</b> <b>force</b> and the force of gravity. The resultant or net force on the ball found by vector addition of the <b>normal</b> <b>force</b> exerted by the road and vertical force due to gravity must equal the centripetal force dictated by the need to travel a circular path. The curved motion is maintained so long as this net force provides the centripetal force requisite to the motion.|$|E
25|$|Note that μ {{can be the}} {{coefficient}} for static or dynamic friction. In the latter case, where the vehicle is skidding around a bend, the friction is at its limit and the inequalities becomes equations. This also ignores effects such as downforce which can increase the <b>normal</b> <b>force</b> and cornering speed.|$|E
30|$|Based on Figure  14, {{it shows}} that the <b>normal</b> <b>forces</b> of legs 4 and 6 increase, when the step pitch s is a fixed value and the range of initial angle Δθ is from 0 ° to 60 °, or when the initial angle Δθ is a fixed value and the range of step pitch s is from 0  m to 0.4  m. The minimum <b>normal</b> <b>forces</b> of feet are 739.2  N for leg 4 and leg 6, when the step pitch s and initial angle Δθ are 0  m and 0 °, respectively. The maximum <b>normal</b> <b>forces</b> of feet are 1301  N, when the step pitch s is 0.4  m and the initial angle Δθ is 60 °. The <b>normal</b> <b>forces</b> of feet are 1098  N for leg 4 and leg 6, when the step pitch s is 0  m and the initial angle Δθ is 60 °.|$|R
40|$|Simplified {{soft tissue}} models used in {{surgical}} simulations cannot perfectly reproduce all material behaviors. In particular, many tissues exhibit the Poynting effect, {{which results in}} <b>normal</b> <b>forces</b> during shearing of tissue and is only observed in nonlinear elastic material models. In order to investigate and quantify {{the role of the}} Poynting effect on material discrimination, we performed a multidimensional scaling (MDS) study. Participants were presented with several pairs of shear and <b>normal</b> <b>forces</b> generated by a haptic device during interaction with virtual soft objects. Participants were asked to rate the similarity between the forces felt. The selection of the material parameters – and thus the magnitude of the shear and <b>normal</b> <b>forces</b> – was based on a pre-study prior to the MDS experiment. It was observed that for nonlinear elastic tissue models exhibiting the Poynting effect, MDS analysis indicated that both shear and <b>normal</b> <b>forces</b> affect user perception...|$|R
30|$|According to Figure  16, {{when the}} initial angle Δθ is 0 ° and the step pitch s varies from 0.05  m to 0.2  m, {{it shows that}} the maximum <b>normal</b> <b>forces</b> of feet {{gradually}} increase for legs 2, 4, and 6. And the curves of the maximum <b>normal</b> <b>forces</b> of the feet are the same for leg 4 and leg 6.|$|R
25|$|The bounce of an oval-shaped ball (such {{as those}} used in {{gridiron}} football or rugby football) is in general much less predictable than the bounce of a spherical ball. Depending on the ball's alignment at impact, the <b>normal</b> <b>force</b> can act ahead or behind the centre of mass of the ball, and friction from the ground {{will depend on the}} alignment of the ball, as well as its rotation, spin, and impact velocity. Where the forces act with respect to the centre of mass of the ball changes as the ball rolls on the ground, and all forces can exert a torque on the ball, including the <b>normal</b> <b>force</b> and the force of gravity. This can cause the ball to bounce forward, bounce back, or sideways. Because it is possible to transfer some rotational kinetic energy into translational kinetic energy, it is even possible for the COR to be greater than 1, or for the forward velocity of the ball to increase upon impact.|$|E
25|$|Humans {{experience}} {{their own}} body weight {{as a result}} of this supporting force, which results in a <b>normal</b> <b>force</b> applied to a person by the surface of a supporting object, on which the person is standing or sitting. In the absence of this force, a person would be in free-fall, and would experience weightlessness. It is the transmission of this reaction force through the human body, and the resultant compression and tension of the body's tissues, that results in the sensation of weight.|$|E
25|$|A seminal {{paper by}} Dyson came in 1966, when, {{together}} with Andrew Lenard and independently of Elliott H. Lieb and Walter Thirring, he proved rigorously that the exclusion principle plays the main {{role in the}} stability of bulk matter. Hence, {{it is not the}} electromagnetic repulsion between outer-shell orbital electrons which prevents two wood blocks that are left {{on top of each other}} from coalescing into a single piece, but rather it is the exclusion principle applied to electrons and protons that generates the classical macroscopic <b>normal</b> <b>force.</b> In condensed matter physics, Dyson also analysed the phase transition of the Ising model in 1 dimension and spin waves.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} the normal contact stiffness in a contact of a rough sphere with an elastic half-space using 3 D boundary element calculations. For small <b>normal</b> <b>forces,</b> {{it is found}} that the stiffness behaves according to the law of Pohrt/Popov for nominally flat self-affine surfaces, while for higher <b>normal</b> <b>forces,</b> there is a transition to Hertzian behavior. A new analytical model is derived describing the contact behavior at any force...|$|R
40|$|The {{knowledge}} of unsteady forces is necessary when designing vertical axis wind turbines (VAWTs). Measurement data for turbines operating at an open site {{are still very}} limited. The data obtained from wind tunnels or towing tanks can be used, but have limited applicability when designing large-scale VAWTs. This study presents experimental data on the <b>normal</b> <b>forces</b> of a 12 -kW straight-bladed VAWT operated at an open site north of Uppsala, Sweden. The <b>normal</b> <b>forces</b> are measured with four single-axis load cells. The data are obtained {{for a wide range}} of tip speed ratios: from 1. 7 to 4. 6. The behavior of the <b>normal</b> <b>forces</b> is analyzed. The presented data can be used in validations of aerodynamic models and the mechanical design for VAWTs...|$|R
30|$|Based on Figure  23, {{it can be}} {{concluded}} that the deviations of maximum <b>normal</b> <b>forces</b> of the feet become larger with the step pitch increasing from 0.1  m to 0.4  m. According to Figures  17 and 23, it can be found that the variable tendencies of maximum <b>normal</b> <b>forces</b> of the feet correspond uniformly for legs 2, 4, and 6, respectively, when the initial angle is 60 ° and the step pitch ranges between 0.1  m to 0.4  m.|$|R
25|$|Most dry {{materials}} in combination have friction coefficient values between 0.3 and 0.6. Values outside this range are rarer, but teflon, for example, {{can have a}} coefficient as low as 0.04. A value of zero would mean no friction at all, an elusive property. Rubber in contact with other surfaces can yield friction coefficients from 1 to 2. Occasionally it is maintained that µ is always < 1, {{but this is not}} true. While in most relevant applications µ < 1, a value above 1 merely implies that the force required to slide an object along the surface is greater than the <b>normal</b> <b>force</b> of the surface on the object. For example, silicone rubber or acrylic rubber-coated surfaces have a coefficient of friction that can be substantially larger than 1.|$|E
25|$|Static {{friction}} is {{friction between}} {{two or more}} solid objects that are not moving relative to each other. For example, static friction can prevent an object from sliding down a sloped surface. The coefficient of static friction, typically denoted as μs, is usually higher than the coefficient of kinetic friction. Static friction is considered to arise {{as the result of}} surface roughness features across multiple length-scales at solid surfaces. These features, known as asperities are present down to nano-scale dimensions and result in true solid to solid contact existing only at a limited number of points accounting for {{only a fraction of the}} apparent or nominal contact area. The linearity between applied load and true contact area, arising from asperity deformation, gives rise to the linearity between static frictional force and <b>normal</b> <b>force,</b> found for typical Amonton-Coulomb type friction.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{impacting}} the ground, some translational {{kinetic energy}} {{can be converted}} to rotational kinetic energy and vice-versa depending on the ball's impact angle and angular velocity. If the ball moves horizontally at impact, friction will have a 'translational' component in the direction opposite to the ball's motion. In the figure, the ball is moving to the right, and thus it will have a translational component of friction pushing the ball to the left. Additionally, if the ball is spinning at impact, friction will have a 'rotational' component in the direction opposite to the ball's rotation. On the figure, the ball is spinning clockwise, and the point impacting the ground is moving to the left with respect to the ball's center of mass. The rotational component of friction is therefore pushing the ball to the right. Unlike the <b>normal</b> <b>force</b> and the force of gravity, these frictional forces will exert a torque on the ball, and change its angular velocity (omega&).|$|E
