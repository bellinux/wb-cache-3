40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the relationship between}} subjective, multidimensional measures of international strategic alliance (ISA) performance and predictors of success both before the alliance is formed (pre-alliance formation factors) and during {{the operation of the}} alliance (post-alliance formation factors). The empirical study, based on a web-survey, investigates a sample of Danish partner firms engaged in 48 equity <b>joint</b> <b>ventures</b> and 70 <b>non-equity</b> <b>joint</b> <b>ventures</b> with partners from around the world. A multi-dimensional operationalization of alliance performance measurement is utilized in order to capture both process and outcome aspects of alliance performance. The results show a significant relationship between alliance performance and host country risk as well as partner reputation preceding alliance formation. During the operation of the alliance, relationships between collaborative know-how, trust, protectiveness, complementarity, cultural distance and alliance performance were found.

40|$|MBA - WBSThe {{increasing}} tend towards, {{and importance}} of, inter-organisational collaborative agreements, such as <b>joint</b> <b>ventures,</b> is widely recognised. While {{the benefits of}} <b>joint</b> <b>ventures</b> have been extensively promoted, many such ventures continue to fail. Research into <b>joint</b> <b>ventures</b> {{has been described as}} either focusing on an in-depth analysis of a selected narrow issue or sweeping generalisations of a more general magnitude, with emphasis on <b>joint</b> <b>venture</b> formation motives, <b>joint</b> <b>venture</b> structuring and partner selection and characteristics. More recently, a growing volume of literature strongly supports the notion that <b>joint</b> <b>venture</b> performance might be more fully understood by the examination of the behavioural characteristics of the <b>joint</b> <b>venture</b> team. This study aims to establish how the behaviours of an engineering <b>joint</b> <b>venture</b> team influence the venture’s performance. The methodology applied in this study is qualitative, interpretive research using the case study method. The qualitative case study investigated the implementation of an international engineering <b>joint</b> <b>venture</b> between Hatch Africa, Mott Macdonald and Goba engineering companies for the delivery of the Transnet mega projects programme in South Africa. The researcher utilised semi-structured interviews and documentary investigation to construct a rich database in order to provide a holistic view of how behavioural characteristics of the <b>joint</b> <b>venture</b> team influences <b>joint</b> <b>venture</b> performance. Seven key behavioural groupings, consisting of commitment, trust, cooperation/coordination/interdependence/reciprocity, communication, conflict resolution, role of management/management style and learning were analysed. Four key themes emerged namely: organisational hierarchy; the effect of time; organisational set up and design; and the current market conditions. Organisational and individual learning, communication and the role of management/management style emerged as the behavioural groupings which had the greatest affect, either positively or negatively, on <b>joint</b> <b>venture</b> performance. Commitment, cooperation and coordination also emerged as having a significant impact on <b>joint</b> <b>venture</b> performance while trust was found to have an indirect influence on <b>joint</b> <b>venture</b> performance. Interdependence, conflict resolution and reciprocity were found to have less of an impact on <b>joint</b> <b>venture</b> performance. ii By considering the results of this research, managers of <b>joint</b> <b>venture</b> partner firms and <b>joint</b> <b>venture</b> management teams themselves can focus their attention, both at the commencement and set up stage of the <b>joint</b> <b>venture</b> as well as during the <b>joint</b> <b>venture</b> development, on the behaviours which have the biggest impact on the <b>joint</b> <b>venture</b> performance, thereby improving the probability of success in the <b>joint</b> <b>venture...</b>|$|R

However, studies have shown that most <b>joint</b> <b>ventures</b> fail to live up to their expectations.

Compared to <b>joint</b> <b>ventures</b> with developed and other developing countries, <b>joint</b> <b>ventures</b> with NICs are characterized with low total investment, low investment per worker, low machinery investment per worker, high average number of Indonesian workers and expatriates, and high percentage of output intended for export. ^ In all industries, <b>joint</b> <b>ventures</b> with developed countries are more capital intensive than <b>joint</b> <b>ventures</b> with LDCs. In terms of market orientation, <b>joint</b> <b>ventures</b> with LDCs are more export oriented than <b>joint</b> <b>ventures</b> with developed countries. ^ Labor productivity and labor income growth are the most important contributions of <b>joint</b> <b>ventures</b> to manufacturing industries. Significant structural change in the manufacturing sector occurred during the study period. The output and value added shares of labor-intensive industries decreased in favor of capital-intensive industries. Labor productivity, employment, and firm size also increased notably. The study shows that <b>joint</b> <b>ventures</b> made significant contributions to the changes. ^ In examining Indonesia 2 ̆ 7 s ability to attract foreign direct investment in manufacturing <b>joint</b> <b>ventures,</b> the study finds that GNP growth and the ratios of gross domestic investment to GNP, the value of manufactured imports to GNP, the value of exports to value of imports, and the value of commerce, transportation and communication output to GDP are important determinants. On the ownership issue, the study showed that the foreign partners 2 ̆ 7 share of ownership is negatively related to debt/equity ratio but positively correlated to the percentage of <b>joint</b> <b>ventures</b> 2 ̆ 7 output intended for export. ...|$|R
