5|$|Within {{the first}} year of opening it became {{apparent}} to the management and investors that the estimated passenger <b>numbers</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> BS and the other UERL lines were over-optimistic. Despite improved integration and cooperation with the other tube railways and the later extensions, the BS struggled financially. In 1933, the BS was taken into public ownership along with the UERL. Today, the BS's tunnels and stations operate as the London Underground's Bakerloo line.|$|E
5|$|Born near Te Awamutu, Cunningham {{originally}} played club rugby in Waihi, in the Coromandel region. Lying {{within the}} Auckland Rugby Football Union's boundaries, {{he was selected}} to play for Auckland province in 1899 and continued to represent the side {{until his retirement in}} 1913. He was first picked for New Zealand in 1901, and played against New South Wales that year, but was not selected again until the 1905 Originals' tour. After the tour he continued to represent New Zealand in both 1907 and 1908. Affiliating to Rongowhakaata, {{he was a member of}} the first ever New Zealand Māori team in 1910, and played for them again in 1912. On retirement in 1913 he had appeared for Auckland 45 times, and for New Zealand 39—both large <b>numbers</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> time.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{discovery}} of gold in California, {{a large amount of}} gold coins began appearing in American commercial channels. The influx caused the price of gold relative to silver to decrease, making silver coins worth more as bullion than as currency. They were exported abroad, or else melted locally for their bullion value. As it was profitable to export silver, little was presented at the Mint, which resulted in low mintage <b>numbers</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> silver dollar; 1,300 and 1,100 were struck in 1851 and 1852 respectively. The rarity of these dates was recognized by the late 1850s; Mint employees made surreptitious restrikes to sell to collectors.|$|E
40|$|In this article, mixed {{convection}} squeezing flow of a nanofluid between parallel disks is considered. The partial {{differential equations}} governing the flow problem are converted into coupled system of ordinary differential equation {{with the help}} of suitable similarity transforms. Homotopy analysis method is employed to solve the coupled system of ordinary differential equations. The influence of involved parameters, on velocity, temperature, and concentration profile, is presented graphically coupled with detailed discussion. <b>The</b> results <b>for</b> skin friction coefficient and Nusselt and Sherwood numbers are also a part of this study. Numerical solution is also obtained {{with the help of}} Runge–Kutta method of order 4. An excellent agreement is found between analytical and numerical solutions. From the results obtained, we observe that the skin friction coefficient decreases with increasing squeeze <b>number</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> case of injection and increases with increase in squeeze <b>number</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> case of injection at the walls. Furthermore, Nusselt number gets a rise with increment in squeeze <b>number</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> case of injection at the wall and a drop in Nusselt <b>number</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> case of suction at the wall is observed when there is suction at the wall. Sherwood number is seen to drop quite steeply with higher values of squeeze <b>number</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> injection case and a rise in Sherwood <b>number</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> suction is observed when there is suction at the wall...|$|R

5|$|In the mid-1920s, three {{sections}} of modern NY63 received posted route <b>numbers</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> first time. From Wayland to Dansville, {{the road was}} the westernmost part of NY52. What is now NY63 was unnumbered from Dansville northwest to Hampton Corners, where NY36 entered from the west on current NY408 and followed the path of NY63 to Geneseo. The road was unnumbered again until Pavilion, at which point NY62 joined {{from the south and}} utilized all of current NY63 and CR63-1 to reach the Lake Ontario shoreline in Yates. By 1926, all numbered portions of current NY63 were state-maintained, as were the unnumbered parts from Geneseo to Piffard and from Groveland to Hampton Corners.|$|E
5|$|NY78 was {{replaced}} by NY44 (now NY414) {{in the vicinity of}} Watkins Glen as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. At the same time, two parts of the pre-1921 routing of Route46 east of Seneca Lake were assigned posted route <b>numbers</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> first time. From just northeast of Watkins Glen to Reynoldsville, the old road became part of NY227, which initially extended from NY44 (now NY414) near Watkins Glen to NY79 in Perry City. While Route46 veered southeast from Reynoldsville to serve Mecklenburg, NY227 proceeded northeast from the former to connect to Perry City. The portion of old Route46 north of Perry City became part of NY79.|$|E
5|$|Population <b>numbers</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Castillonnais {{are quite}} low. The {{majority}} of breeders {{are located in}} Castillon-en-Couserans, in Ariège, but a few {{can be found in}} Brittany and Provence. In November 2005, there were only around 260 existing Castillonnais, and a goal was created by the breed association to double the number of purebred mares between 2005 and 2014. Inbreeding is a concern due to low population numbers, and the national stud farm at Tarbes and Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique (National Institute of Agronomic Research) have been brought in to help safeguard the genetic resources of the breed.|$|E

5|$|Production of the Rolls-Royce Merlin {{was driven}} by the forethought and {{determination}} of Ernest Hives, who at times was enraged by the apparent complacency and lack of urgency encountered in his frequent correspondence with Air Ministry and local authority officials. Hives was an advocate of shadow factories, and, sensing the imminent outbreak of war, pressed ahead with plans to produce the Merlin in sufficient <b>numbers</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> rapidly expanding Royal Air Force. Despite the importance of uninterrupted production, several factories were affected by industrial action. By {{the end of its}} production run in 1950, 168,176 Merlin engines had been built; over 112,000 in Britain and more than 55,000 under licence in the U.S.|$|E

In the spring of 548, Troglita, having regrouped his forces, met with his Moorish allies at the plain of Arsuris on the northern limits of Byzacena. Corippus gives extraordinary <b>numbers</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> native contingents provided by each chief: 30,000 for Cutzinas, 100,000 for Isfidaias, and 12,000 under Iaudas's brother.
