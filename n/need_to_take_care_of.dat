25|$|Biographers {{differ on}} what {{was the basis for}} this arrangement. Little Leopold was ill in his infancy, and perhaps needed to be kept in Salzburg for this reason, but this does not explain why he was still kept there after his recovery. Another {{possibility}} attributes the arrangement to Marianne's delicate health or her <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> her stepchildren. Biographer Maynard Solomon attributes the arrangement to Leopold's wish to revive his skills in training a musical genius, as he had done with Wolfgang. He also suggests that giving up her son was indicative of Marianne's total subordination to her father's wishes.|$|E
25|$|Ceres, as the Goddess who has {{control over}} nature's {{resources}} and cycles, may astrologically {{be considered the}} planet of the Environment. Returning to mythology, an early environmental villain is the figure of Erysichthon, the tearer up of the earth, who cut down trees in a grove sacred to Ceres-Demeter, {{for which he was}} punished by the goddess with fearful hunger. In this sense Ceres became an emerging archetype in the awareness of recent climate change, and is entering our collective consciousness as a <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> our natural and irreplaceable resources in the 21st century. Ceres represents a leap towards a future of ecological responsibility and knowledge. As an indicator for environmental or community activism, Ceres would represent for some astrologers the wave of the future.|$|E

2500|$|When {{she made}} her debut into the industry, she was often {{labelled}} as a penyanyi kampung (old-fashioned or conservative singer) for her modest attire and her refusal to take pictures with a man for a magazine cover, unless at a ceremony or at an award-accepting event. During her early years as a singer, she was criticised for refusing to wear daring clothes and her principle of not taking pictures with male artistes. She was quoted as saying: [...] "As an artist, I do {{realize that there are}} many social responsibilities that I <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of.</b> So, I opt to be moderate in everything, including in my sartorial matter." [...] and [...] "I want to show what my talent is, and my God-gifted vocal ability without relying [...] of being sexy.". Her debut in Indonesia in 1997 with modest, beautiful and talented personality has said to revolutionise Indonesian music industry which famous with Dangdut which before this promoted sensual and erotic elements through the performances, especially those by female artistes. Her modest image was the subject of appraisals and positive feedback even from the Islamic scholars from Malaysia and Indonesia. Since then, her popularity throughout the South East Asia music industry has remained strong, proven as she was voted as Most Popular Female Artiste ten times in a row and Regional Most Popular Artiste in 2011 in Anugerah Planet Muzik 2011, beating contenders from Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia.|$|E
6000|$|Several {{years before}} Mr. Lammerton had arrived among {{us with a}} Beaux Arts {{moustache}} and letters of introduction to Mrs. Durrett and others. We found him the most adaptable, the most accommodating of young men, always ready to donate his talents and his services to private theatricals, tableaux, and fancy-dress balls, to take a place at a table at the last moment. One of his most appealing attributes was his [...] "belief" [...] in our city,--a form of patriotism that culminated, in later years, in [...] "million population" [...] clubs. I have often heard him declare, when the ladies had left the dining-room, that there was positively no limit to our future growth; and, incidentally, to our future wealth. Such sentiments as these could not fail to add to any man's popularity, and his success was a foregone conclusion. Almost before we knew it he was building the new Union Station {{of which he had}} foreseen the <b>need,</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> the millions to which our population was to be swelled; building the new Post Office that the unceasing efforts of Theodore Watling finally procured for us: building, indeed, Nancy's new house, the largest of our private mansions save Mr. Scherer's, a commission that had immediately brought about others from the Dickinsons and the Berringers.... That very day I called on him in his offices at the top of one of our new buildings, where many young draftsmen were bending over their boards. I was ushered into his private studio.|$|E
