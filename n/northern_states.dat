5|$|Senator Powell favored Kentucky's {{neutrality}} policy {{during the}} Civil War, but nationally, the conflict {{put him in}} a tenuous political situation. On one hand, he favored a strong national government and a strict interpretation of the U.S. Constitution. On the other hand, he was an opponent of coercion, and due to Kentucky's proximity to the Southern states, maintained a more sympathetic view of the southern cause than legislators from more <b>northern</b> <b>states.</b> During his term as governor, Powell had been critical of <b>Northern</b> <b>states</b> that refused to abide by the Fugitive Slave Act.|$|E

5|$|The {{second section}} of the Fourteenth Amendment punished, by reduced {{representation}} in the House of Representatives, any states that disenfranchised any male citizens over 21 years of age. By failing to adopt a harsher penalty, this signaled to the states that they still possessed the right to deny ballot access to blacks. <b>Northern</b> <b>states</b> were generally as averse to granting voting rights to blacks as Southern states. In the year of its ratification, only eight <b>Northern</b> <b>states</b> allowed blacks to vote. In the South, blacks were able to vote in many areas, but only through {{the intervention of the}} occupying Union Army. Congress had granted suffrage to the blacks in the territories in 1867 by passing the Territorial Suffrage Act.|$|E

5|$|In {{reaction}} to the seizure of the American vessels, Congress debated and approved the Naval Act of 1794, which authorized the building of six frigates, four of 44 guns and two of 36 guns.

5|$|Magoffin {{was elected}} {{governor}} of Kentucky {{by a vote}} of 76,187 to 67,283 over Joshua Fry Bell, taking office on August 30, 1859.

Although he believed in the right of states to secede from the union, he hoped to avoid this outcome by reaching an agreement between the southern and <b>northern</b> <b>states.</b> To that end, he wrote a circular letter to the governors of the slave states on December 9, 1860 detailing a plan to save the Union.|$|E
5|$|New York was {{key to the}} election; a Lincoln loss {{there would}} {{deadlock}} the Electoral College.

As Lincoln's ideas of abolishing slavery grew, so did his supporters.

50|$|The {{school had}} survived through the Great Depression {{and was now}} under a new title with new responsibilities; {{carrying}} out these responsibilities however would be no easy task: the Great Depression had left the school in debt, enrollment numbers were dropping and the world was entering into yet another war. Luckily, for <b>Northern</b> <b>State</b> Teachers College, Dr. Noah E. Steele was the school president and he presided over the school from his induction in 1939 until 1951; he increased enrollment numbers, constructed new additions to the campus, and helped the school get through World War II.The school had experienced many changes in WWII: it now offered a flight and ground pilot program to train future military pilots, established a defense school, and also began to offer basic engineering programs. In response to NSTC's changing size and programs South Dakota State Legislature changed the name in 1964 to <b>Northern</b> <b>State</b> College.

Mallory was one of the Confederate leaders who were charged with treason, among other things; on May 20, 1865, while he was still at La Grange, he was roused from his sleep at about midnight and taken into custody. From there he was taken to Fort Lafayette in New York Harbor, where he was confined as a political prisoner.|$|E
