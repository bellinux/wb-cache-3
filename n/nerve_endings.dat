5|$|Upon {{anatomical}} study, {{the penis}} {{can be described}} as a clitoris that has been mostly pulled out of the body and grafted on top of a significantly smaller piece of spongiosum containing the urethra. With regard to <b>nerve</b> <b>endings,</b> the human clitoris's estimated 8,000 or more (for its glans or clitoral body as a whole) is commonly cited as being twice as many as the <b>nerve</b> <b>endings</b> found in the human penis (for its glans or body as a whole), and as more than any other part of the human body. These reports sometimes conflict with other sources on clitoral anatomy or those concerning the <b>nerve</b> <b>endings</b> in the human penis. For example, while some sources estimate that the human penis has 4,000 <b>nerve</b> <b>endings,</b> other sources state that the glans or the entire penile structure have the same amount of <b>nerve</b> <b>endings</b> as the clitoral glans, or discuss whether the uncircumcised penis has thousands more than the circumcised penis or is generally more sensitive.|$|E
5|$|G-spot proponents are {{criticized for}} giving too much {{credence}} to anecdotal evidence, and for questionable investigative methods; for instance, the studies which have yielded positive {{evidence for a}} precisely located G-spot involve small participant samples. While {{the existence of a}} greater concentration of <b>nerve</b> <b>endings</b> at the lower third (near the entrance) of the vagina is commonly cited, some scientific examinations of vaginal wall innervation have shown no single area with a greater density of <b>nerve</b> <b>endings.</b>|$|E
5|$|Neurotoxic {{effect of}} {{mephedrone}} on serotonin (5-HT) and dopamine (DA) systems remains controversial. Although some studies in animal models reported no damage to DA <b>nerve</b> <b>endings</b> in the striatum and no {{significant changes in}} brain monoamine levels, some others suggested a rapid reduction in 5-HT and DA transporter function. Persistent serotonergic deficits were observed after binge like treatment in a warm environment and in both serotonergic and dopaminergic <b>nerve</b> <b>endings</b> at high ambient temperature. Oxidative stress cytotoxicity {{and an increase in}} frontal cortex lipid peroxidation were also reported.|$|E

40|$|Chronic {{inflammation}} of the upper airway mucosa is most likely caused by multiple factors, but is frequently associated with local neurogenic inflammation. This phenomenon can be induced by the inhalation of exogenous particles and chemicals present in our environment, as well as irritants produced endogenously. These irritants, i. e. histamine, H+ or bradykinin, can stimulate the abundant afferent sensory <b>nerves</b> <b>endings,</b> epithelial and neuroendocrine cells present in the upper airways mucosa. These structures can interact with our immune and neural cells by producing pro-inflammatory neuropeptides, cytokines, chemokines and neurotrophins. This short review summarizes some of our current knowledge {{with regard to the}} role of airborne chemical stimuli and their possible implications in the development of chronic {{inflammation of}} the upper airways mucosa...|$|R
50|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that DDT and other similar {{chemicals}} directly elicited a response and effect from excitable membranes. DDT causes membranes such as sense organs and <b>nerves</b> <b>endings</b> to activate repetitively by slowing down the ability for the sodium channel to close and stop releasing sodium ions. The sodium ions are what polarize the opposing synapse after it has depolarized from firing. This inhibition of closing the sodium ion channel can lead to a variety of problems including a dysfunctional nervous system, decreased motor abilities/function/control, reproductive impairment (egg-shell thinning in birds), and development deficiencies. Presently, DDT has been labeled as a possible human carcinogen based on animal liver tumor studies. DDT toxicity on humans have been associated with dizziness, tremors, irritability, and convulsions. Chronic toxicity has led to long term neurological and cognitive issues.|$|R
5|$|Several {{researchers}} {{also consider the}} connection between the Skene's gland and the G-spot to be weak. The urethral sponge, however, which is also hypothesized as the G-spot, contains sensitive <b>nerve</b> <b>endings</b> and erectile tissue. Sensitivity is not determined by neuron density alone: other factors include the branching patterns of neuron terminals and cross or collateral innervation of neurons. While G-spot opponents argue that because there are very few tactile <b>nerve</b> <b>endings</b> in the vagina and that therefore the G-spot cannot exist, G-spot proponents argue that vaginal orgasms rely on pressure-sensitive nerves.|$|E
5|$|Pain {{in cancer}} can be {{produced}} by mechanical (e.g. pinching) or chemical (e.g. inflammation) stimulation of specialized pain-signalling <b>nerve</b> <b>endings</b> found {{in most parts of}} the body (called nociceptive pain), or it may be caused by diseased, damaged or compressed nerves, in which case it is called neuropathic pain. Neuropathic pain is often accompanied by other feelings such as pins and needles.|$|E
5|$|Physical sexual {{stimulation}} of the clitoris {{is the most common}} way for women to achieve orgasm; general statistics indicate that 70–80 percent of women require direct clitoral stimulation (consistent manual, oral or other concentrated friction against the external parts of the clitoris) to reach orgasm, though indirect clitoral stimulation (for example, via vaginal penetration) may also be sufficient for female orgasm. The area near the entrance of the vagina (the lower third) contains nearly 90percent of the vaginal <b>nerve</b> <b>endings,</b> and there are areas in the anterior vaginal wall and between the top junction of the labia minora and the urethra that are especially sensitive, but intense sexual pleasure, including orgasm, solely from vaginal stimulation is occasional or otherwise absent because the vagina has significantly fewer <b>nerve</b> <b>endings</b> than the clitoris.|$|E
50|$|A hair plexus or {{root hair}} plexus {{is a special}} group of <b>nerve</b> fiber <b>endings</b> {{and serves as a}} very {{sensitive}} mechanoreceptor for touch sensation. Each hair plexus forms a network around a hair follicle and is a receptor, which means it sends and receives nerve impulses to and from the brain when the hair moves.|$|R
40|$|The {{distribution}} of zinc and postnatal {{development of the}} rat amygdala were investigated by light and electron microscopy with Timm's sulphide silver method. By Timm's reaction and toluidine blue staining, the rat amygdala could be divided into cortical(CO), lateral(L), basolateral(ABL), basomedial(ABM), central(C), medial(M) and intercated(I) nuclear regions. CO was the most strongly positive to Timm's reaction, L, ABM and C were strongly positive, ABL was also positive, and I and M were weakly positive. In newborns, no positive Timm's reaction could be observed, but a very weakly positive reaction was observed from the 5 th postnatal day. The reaction became stronger with development, and reached the strength of that of the adult on the 30 th postnatal day. Electron microscopically, the deposits of silver grains were only located in the <b>nerve</b> fiber <b>endings</b> containing many small clear vesicles. This finding is quite similar to that described in the mossy fiber endings in the hippocampal formation. Deposits of silver grains {{could not be found}} in newborns, and only very few could be observed after the 5 th postnatal day. The number of deposits increased with age, and reached that of the adult from the 20 th to the 30 th postnatal days. It was elucidated that {{a significant increase in the}} number of silver grains per square 10 (- 8) centimeter of Timm's positive <b>nerve</b> fiber <b>endings</b> occurred between the 10 th and 20 th postnatal days. These findings suggest that zinc exists in the <b>nerve</b> fiber <b>endings</b> in the rat amygdala and the amount of zinc increases with age. Zinc may play an important role in synaptic transmission...|$|R

A idade presumida variou de 18 a 65 anos com a mÃdia de 41, 6 anos. Cada ligamento foi dividido em 3 partes ou regiÃes: proximal, central e distal para coloraÃÃo com o cloreto de ouro a 1 %. Em seguida obtiveram-se cortes seriados de 20 micrÃmetros de espessura para estudos na microscopia de luz. Foram identificados 3 tipos de mecanorreceptores, Rufini, Pacini e Golgi alÃm das terminaÃÃes nervosas livres. Utilizou-se tambÃm a classificaÃÃo de Freeman e Wike, 1967.

When joint components such as capsules, ligaments and muscles are submitted to mechanic stress and pain, free <b>nerves</b> <b>endings</b> and mechanoreceptors located within these anatomical structures detect and relay this physiological information to the central nervous system. Ankle lateral ligaments (anterior talofibular, talocalcaneal and posterior talofibular) obtained from 24 ankles of 13 masculine non-formolized unclaimed cadavers were used in the study. Age ranged from 18 to 65 years (mean age: 41, 6 years). Ligaments samples were divided into 3 equal parts (proximal, central and distal segments). Following tissue impregnation with gold chloride 1 % solution, serial cuts (20 Â thickness) were studied under light microscopy. Mechanoreceptors (Rufini, Pacini and Golgi) and free nervous endings were identified, according to Freeman and Wikeâs classification. Counting of individual mechanoreceptors and free <b>nerves</b> <b>endings</b> (histomorphometry) and evaluation of mechanoreceptor density in squared millimeter areas was carried out in all samples.

5|$|Highly innervated, the glans {{exists at}} the tip of the {{clitoral}} body as a fibro-vascular cap, and is usually the size and shape of a pea, although it is sometimes much larger or smaller. While whether or not the glans is composed of erectile or non-erectile tissue is subject to debate (see above), it, or the entire clitoris, is estimated to have 8,000 or more sensory <b>nerve</b> <b>endings.</b>|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the hormones}} in the {{anterior}} pituitary are {{each part of}} an axis that is regulated by the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus secretes a number of releasing hormones, often according to a circadian rhythm, into blood vessels that supply the anterior pituitary; {{most of these are}} stimulatory (thyrotropin-releasing hormone, corticotropin-releasing hormone, gonadotropin-releasing hormone and growth hormone-releasing hormone), apart from dopamine, which suppresses prolactin production. In response to the releasing hormone rate, the anterior pituitary produces its hormones (TSH, ACTH, LH, FSH, GH) which in turn stimulate effector hormone glands in the body, while prolactin (PRL) acts directly on the breast gland. Once the effector glands produce sufficient hormones (thyroxine, cortisol, estradiol or testosterone and IGF-1), both the hypothalamus and the pituitary cells sense their abundance and reduce their secretion of stimulating hormones. The hormones of the posterior pituitary are produced in the hypothalamus and are carried by <b>nerve</b> <b>endings</b> to the posterior lobe; their feedback system is therefore located in the hypothalamus, but damage to the <b>nerve</b> <b>endings</b> would still lead to a deficiency in hormone release.|$|E
5|$|In {{the later}} phase of decompression, the {{critical}} event {{is assumed to}} be the presence of a large bubble that has taken up a large quantity of dissolved gas from the adjacent tissue in a joint. If the bubble reaches a critical volume, it will have a mechanical effect on the <b>nerve</b> <b>endings</b> causing pain in a tendon. The bubble volume is the critical parameter. This criterion is used to prevent type I pain-only symptoms. The strategy for a safe ascent at this stage is to prevent any gas phase from growing beyond a critical volume.|$|E
40|$|Light {{microscopic}} observations employing intravital {{methylene blue}} staining and impregnation by the zinc iodide-osmium tetroxide technique are presented for intraepidermal <b>nerve</b> fibre <b>endings</b> of the intervibrissal fur in the mystacial pad {{of the rat}} snout. Both procedures revealed anatomical details of the intraepidermal nerve fibre plexus in epidermal hillocks often located {{very close to the}} mouths of hairs. These nerve fibres appeared to resemble those described in previous immunohistochemical studies as cluster or bush endings. The methylene blue preparations demonstrated the existence of an intensely stained enlargement {{at the site of the}} branching point of the nerve fibres which seemed to be functionally related to the development of such nerve fibre plexuses. Due to their close association with hairs, these nerve fibre plexuses are most likely to be mechanoreceptive. Additionally, solitary varicose nerve fibres were found loosely distributed within the epidermis. The visualisation of 2 different morphological types of <b>nerve</b> fibre <b>endings</b> extends the validity of the concept of punctate sensibility into the epidermis. Methylene blue staining appeared to be somewhat superior to the zinc iodide-osmium tetroxide technique. Due to their selectivity for intraepidermal nerve fibres, the methods applied here supplement immunohistochemical procedures in a helpful manner...|$|R

40|$|Hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) is {{described}} as a mediator of diverse biological effects, and is known to produce irritation and injury in the lung following inhalation. Recently, H 2 S has been found to cause contraction in the rat urinary bladder via a neurogenic mechanism. Here, we studied whether sodium hydrogen sulfide (NaHS), used as donor of H 2 S, produces responses mediated by sensory nerve activation in the guinea-pig airways. NaHS evoked an increase in neuropeptide release in the airways that was significantly attenuated by capsaicin desensitization and by the transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV 1) antagonist capsazepine. In addition, NaHS caused an atropine-resistant contraction of isolated airways, which was completely prevented by capsaicin desensitization. Furthermore, NaHS-induced contraction was reduced by TRPV 1 antagonism (ruthenium red, capsazepine and SB 366791), and was abolished by pretreatment with the combination of tachykinin NK 1 (SR 140333) and NK 2 (SR 48968) receptor antagonists. In anesthetized guinea-pigs, intratracheal instillation of NaHS increased the total lung resistance and airway plasma protein extravasation. These two effects were reduced by TRPV 1 antagonism (capsazepine) and tachykinin receptors (SR 140333 and SR 48968) blockade. Our results provide the first pharmacological evidence that H 2 S provokes tachykinin-mediated neurogenic inflammatory responses in guinea-pig airways, and that this effect is mediated by stimulation of TRPV 1 receptors on sensory <b>nerves</b> <b>endings.</b> This novel mechanism may contribute to the irritative action of H 2 S in the respiratory system...|$|R
5|$|The {{abundance}} of <b>nerve</b> <b>endings</b> in the clitoris, {{the majority of}} which exist specifically for sexual enjoyment, make it the human female's most sensitive erogenous zone and generally the primary anatomical source of human female sexual pleasure. Sexual stimulation of the clitoris can produce female sexual arousal and orgasm, and may be achieved by masturbation or with a sexual partner. The most effective sexual stimulation of the organ is usually through manual or oral stimulation (cunnilingus), {{often referred to as}} direct clitoral stimulation; in cases involving sexual penetration, these activities may also be referred to as additional or assisted clitoral stimulation.|$|E
5|$|The {{clitoris}} is {{the human}} female's most sensitive erogenous zone and generally the primary anatomical source of human female sexual pleasure. In humans and other mammals, it develops from an outgrowth in the embryo called the genital tubercle. Initially undifferentiated, the tubercle develops into either a penis or a clitoris, depending on {{the presence or absence}} of the protein tdf, which is codified by a single gene on the Y chromosome. The clitoris is a complex structure, and its size and sensitivity can vary. The glans (head) of the human clitoris is roughly the size and shape of a pea, and is estimated to have more than 8,000 sensory <b>nerve</b> <b>endings.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{concentration}} of the <b>nerve</b> <b>endings</b> near {{the entrance of the}} vagina (the lower third) usually provide pleasurable vaginal sensations when stimulated during sexual activity, and many women additionally derive pleasure from a feeling of closeness and fullness during penetration of the vagina. The vagina as a whole, however, lacks <b>nerve</b> <b>endings,</b> which commonly hinders a woman's ability to receive sufficient sexual stimulation, including orgasm, solely from penetration of the vagina. Although some scientific examinations of vaginal wall innervation indicate no single area with a greater density of <b>nerve</b> <b>endings,</b> or that only some women have a greater density of <b>nerve</b> <b>endings</b> in the anterior vaginal wall, heightened sensitivity in the anterior vaginal wall is common among women. These cases indicate that the outer one-third of the vagina, especially near the opening, contains the majority of the vaginal <b>nerve</b> <b>endings,</b> making it more sensitive to touch than the inner (or upper) two-thirds of the vaginal barrel. By having an arrangement of <b>nerve</b> <b>endings</b> concentrating in the outer part rather than along the whole length, childbirth pain is significantly more tolerable.|$|E
40|$|The Harderian glands of rodents {{are large}} intraorbital exocrine glands with histologic {{organization}} that varies among mammalian species. Here we describe some ultrastructural and biochemical {{features of the}} Harderian gland in the Mexican volcano mouse Neotomodon alstoni alstoni, a species of restricted habitat. The Harderian glands from male and female adult mice were dissected, processed and embedded in Epon 812 for light and electron microscopy studies. Porphyrin and total lipids were biochemically determined. The macroscopic appearance of the Harderian gland is similar in the male and female. The gland is a bilobulate structure, situated in the orbit towards the posterior side of the eyeball, of whitish color and {{is surrounded by a}} connective tissue capsule. The male gland is slightly heavier (127 mg) than that of the female (113 mg). The Harderian gland shows a tubulo-alveolar organization and is composed exclusively of one type of secretory cells. No branched duct system within the gland was found. Adrenergic <b>nerves</b> <b>endings</b> and mast cell were observed in the interstices of the alveoli. Male and female glands produce similar levels of porphyrins. Triglyceride levels were significantly higher (P < 0. 05) in the female compared to the male. Abundance of lipids could induce corneal lubrication of the Harderian gland which may confer a protective and adaptative function to the volcano mouse in its natural habitat during the dry and cold seasons.

40|$|Metadata onlyPreliminary {{results of}} this study have been {{presented}} at the ICIS Conferences held in Atlanta, 1998; a Summary of results has been quoted in Adamson-Macedo (1997; 1998). OBJECTIVES: Despite knowledge that preterm infants in intensive care are in distress and need to be provided with appropriate intervention, studies with ventilated babies are still rare particularly during their first weeks of life. This study tested the hypothesis that cutaneous stimulation in the form of TAC-TIC therapy, involving only light stroking and NOT massage or kinesthetic massage, has a mediating role in eliciting beneficial psychoneuroimmunological coactions in the ventilated preterm {{during the first week of}} post-natal life. METHODS: A repeated measure, counterbalanced design, was used to collect data twice daily for three consecutive days. This intervention was compared with a control condition consisting of a period of spontaneous activity during which the same infants lay alone with no intervention taking place. For the first time, monitoring facilities were made available for immunological, physiological and behavioral responses to be assessed simultaneously before and after intervention and before and after spontaneous activities. RESULTS. A one tailed t-test indicated that the cutaneous intervention resulted in significantly more episodes of beneficial coactions than matched sessions of spontaneous activity. CONCLUSION: It is suggested that the sensory <b>nerves</b> <b>endings</b> in the skin receive the stimulation from the stroking actions; consequently impulses are being sent via afferent nerve fibers to the limbic system where the sensation is interpreted, by 68 % of the neonates, as being comforting or not distressing...|$|R

40|$|An elucidation of the {{mechanisms}} of chromatophore control in tclcost fishes involves consideration of {{the participation of the}} nervous system (pigment concentrating and dis-persing fibers) and an evaluation of influences mediated by pituitary hormones. The sand flounder, Scopthalamus aquas-us Norman (Lophosetta muculatu Gill) was investigated by neurological and pharmacological methods. Nerve cutting, blocking and stimulation experiments revealed unequivocally functional pigment aggregating but not dispersing fibers. Acetyl choline and eserine when injected into the spinal cord bring about excitation of pigment concentrating nerve fibers but have no local effect on melanocytes. Drugs causing local pigment aggregation are aromatic ethyl amines or hydrazines. Epinephrine, norepine-phrine ‘and dopamine are extremely active. The most potent pigment dispersing drugs were certain phenothiazine tranquilizers. Pretreatment with pyrogallol markedly potentiated epinephrine and norepinephrine but raised the effective dose of five of the drugs having pigment dispersing properties.

40|$|Pain {{associated}} a bony pathology puts {{a significant}} burden on individuals, society, and the health-care systems worldwide. Pathology {{that involves the}} bone marrow activates sensory <b>nerve</b> terminal <b>endings</b> of peripheral bone marrow nociceptors, and is the likely trigger for pain. This review presents our current understanding of how bone marrow nociceptors are influenced by noxious stimuli presented in pathology associated with bone marrow. A number of ion channels and receptors are emerging as important modulators of the activity of peripheral bone marrow nociceptors. Nerve growth factor (NGF) sequestration has been trialed {{for the management of}} inflammatory bone pain (osteoarthritis), and there is significant evidence for interaction of NGF with bone marrow nociceptors. Activation of transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 sensitizes bone marrow nociceptors and could contribute to increased sensitivity of patients to noxious stimuli in various bony pathologies. Acid-sensing ion channels sense changes to tissue pH in the bone marrow microenvironment and could be targeted to treat pathology that involves acidosis of the bone marrow. Piezo 2 is a mechanically gated ion channel that has recently been reported to be expressed by most myelinated bone marrow nociceptors and might be a target for treatments directed against mechanically induced bone pain. These ion channels and receptors could be useful targets for the development of peripherally acting drugs to treat pain of bony origin...|$|R

Herein, we have investigated the significance of adenosine, through the blockade of its receptors with caffeine, on the CB hypoxic sensitization induced by chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH) in the rat. CIH animals were obtained by submitting rats during 15 days from 8 : 00 to 16 : 00 to 10 %O 2 for 40 s and 20 % O 2 for 80 s (i. e., 30 episodes/h). Caffeine (1 mM) was tested in spontaneous and 5 %O 2 evoked-CSN chemosensory activity in normoxic and CIH animals. CIH decreased basal spontaneous activity but increased significantly CSN activity evoked by acute hypoxia. Caffeine did not modify basal spontaneous activity in normoxic rats, but decreased significantly by 47. 83 % basal activity in CIH animals. In addition, acute application of caffeine decreased 49. 31 % and 56. 01 % the acute hypoxic response in normoxic and CIH animals, respectively. We demonstrate that adenosine contributes to fix CSN basal activity during CIH, being also involved in hypoxic CB chemotransduction. It is concluded that adenosine participates in CB sensitization during CIH.
