5|$|The {{absence of}} {{distinct}} currencies also theoretically removes exchange rate risks, although {{the imposition of}} transfer restrictions in 2012–13 Cypriot financial crisis means {{that the situation is}} <b>not</b> <b>quite</b> <b>so</b> simple. The risk of unanticipated exchange rate movement has always added an additional risk or uncertainty for companies or individuals that invest or trade outside their own currency zones. Companies that hedge against this risk will no longer need to shoulder this additional cost. This is particularly important for countries whose currencies had traditionally fluctuated a great deal, particularly the Mediterranean nations.|$|E
5|$|The Regional Finals {{were not}} all that far away from Knoxville– the Lady Vols only had to travel a couple of hours, to Nashville, where they faced 5th-seeded Rutgers, 22–9. Rutgers had survived two close games to reach this point, {{defeating}} 12th-seeded Oregon, 79–76, in the first round, and then upsetting 4th-seeded Iowa State, 62–61 in the second. Their third-round game was <b>not</b> <b>quite</b> <b>so</b> close. Although Rutgers only trailed by two {{towards the end of}} the first period, UT was able to outscore Rutgers by six to close it out, and opened the second half up by building the lead to sixteen. The Scarlet Knights never recovered, losing 92–60. Holdsclaw and Catchings were again the leading scorers, with 25 and 23. The Lady Vols shot 52.2% from the field and forced Rutgers to 27 turnovers. This game gave Tennessee their 36th win, breaking Connecticut's record of 35, as the Lady Vols advanced to the Regional Finals.|$|E

25|$|Last Poems (1922) was {{the last}} of the two volumes of poems which A. E. Housman {{published}} during his lifetime. Of the 42 poems there, seventeen were given titles, a greater proportion than in his previous collection, A Shropshire Lad (1896).

25|$|The {{next four}} seasons were {{productive}} ones. In 1881, 14 matches brought him 82 wickets at 19.57. The following year was slightly better, with 15 matches producing 94 wickets at 16.93. 1883 was his most productive season: 21 matches, 148 wickets {{at an average}} of 15.90, with 18 five-wicket innings and six 10-wicket matches. He was <b>not</b> <b>quite</b> <b>so</b> effective in 1884: the same number of matches as the previous year yielded him 121 wickets at 18.17.|$|E
25|$|Crucibles {{began using}} very large flake graphite, and carbon-magnesite brick {{requiring}} <b>not</b> <b>quite</b> <b>so</b> large flake graphite; for these and others {{there is now}} much more flexibility in size of flake required, and amorphous graphite is no longer restricted to low-end refractories. Alumina-graphite shapes are used as continuous casting ware, such as nozzles and troughs, to convey the molten steel from ladle to mold, and carbon magnesite bricks line steel converters and electric-arc furnaces to withstand extreme temperatures. Graphite blocks are also used in parts of blast furnace linings where the high thermal conductivity of the graphite is critical. High-purity monolithics are often used as a continuous furnace lining instead of carbon-magnesite bricks.|$|E

25|$|As {{early as}} 1871, George Freeman {{had started a}} {{business}} as an auctioneer and this restricted his appearances that year. Although he was <b>not</b> <b>quite</b> <b>so</b> lethal {{as he had been}} in the previous four seasons, it was still a surprise when Freeman did not play in the early matches of the 1872 season, reappearing only against Gloucestershire for his own benefit match. W. G. Grace scored 150 against him, and for the next five years Freeman, with a growing business claiming all his time, played only very occasionally in minor matches for the Malton club. In 1878, however, playing as an amateur, Freeman appeared in first-class cricket for the first time in six years against Middlesex at Lord’s, but lack of practice and the improvement in pitches from the heavy roller and motor mower meant he could not take more than three wickets at a cost of ninety-one runs. He played once against each of the first two Australian touring teams, but took only two wickets in total. However, George Freeman still bowled with success for “Gentlemen of Yorkshire” teams as late as 1883.|$|E
25|$|The Habiru seem to {{have been}} more a social class than an ethnic group. One {{analysis}} shows that the majority were, however, Hurrian (a non-Semitic-speaking group from Asia Minor who spoke a language isolate), though {{there were a number of}} Semites and even some Kassite and Luwian adventurers amongst their number. The reign of Amenhotep III, as a result was <b>not</b> <b>quite</b> <b>so</b> tranquil for the Asiatic province, as Habiru/'Apiru contributed to greater political instability. It is believed that turbulent chiefs began to seek their opportunities, though as a rule could not find them without the help of a neighbouring king. The boldest of the disaffected nobles was Aziru, son of Abdi-Ashirta, a prince of Amurru, who even before the death of Amenhotep III, endeavoured to extend his power into the plain of Damascus. Akizzi, governor of Katna (Qatna?) (near Hamath), reported this to the Pharaoh, who seems to have sought to frustrate his attempts. In the next reign, however, both father and son caused infinite trouble to loyal servants of Egypt like Rib-Hadda, governor of Gubla (Gebal), not the least through transferring loyalty from the Egyptian crown to that of the expanding neighbouring Asia Minor based Hittite Empire under Suppiluliuma I.|$|E
25|$|The Diocese of Saint Thomas of Mylapur was ministered to at {{this period}} by the Portuguese Franciscans, Portuguese Dominicans, Portuguese Augustinians and Portuguese Jesuits; besides these, there were French Jesuits and Italian Barnabites {{working in the}} diocese {{in harmony with the}} ordinary, and French Capuchins defying their authority, at least occasionally. One {{drawback}} of this total manning of the diocese with the religious orders was the absolute neglect to form an indigenous clergy to meet the emergency that presently arose. For about this time the Marquess of Pombal suppressed the houses of the Society of Jesus in Portugal and thus cut off the supply of Portuguese Jesuits to the diocese. The emergency became still more acute in 1773, when Clement XIV suppressed the Society of Jesus. Withal, the situation was <b>not</b> <b>quite</b> <b>so</b> hopeless as to call for drastic measures in regard to the diocese from without: it was not until 1834 that the houses of the other religious orders in the Portuguese dominions were suppressed, and as the Diocese of Saint Thomas of Mylapur was situated wholly outside of Portuguese territory, nothing prevented the Portuguese religious orders from thriving there. Nevertheless, as at home vocations became fewer, the houses in India gradually died out, the last to be represented in the diocese being the Portuguese Augustinians in Bengal, the last member of the order dying in 1869.|$|E

While the novel is based on comic book characters, it consists solely of prose. Anderson commented on the difficulty in writing comics as prose stating, [...] "in the comics, several pages of superpowered action can propel the story, but when you read it in a book, it's <b>not</b> <b>quite</b> <b>so</b> interesting.
