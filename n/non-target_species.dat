5|$|Biological control {{can have}} {{side-effects}} on biodiversity through attacks on <b>non-target</b> <b>species</b> {{by any of}} the same mechanisms, especially when a species is introduced without thorough understanding of the possible consequences.|$|E
5|$|Biological control {{can affect}} {{biodiversity}} through predation, parasitism, pathogenicity, competition, or other attacks on <b>non-target</b> <b>species.</b> An introduced control {{does not always}} target only the intended pest species; it can also target native species. In Hawaii during the 1940s parasitic wasps were introduced to control a lepidopteran pest and the wasps are still found there today. This may {{have a negative impact}} on the native ecosystem, however, host range and impacts need to be studied before declaring their impact on the environment.|$|E
5|$|By-catch is the {{incidental}} {{capture of}} <b>non-target</b> <b>species</b> in fisheries. Fixed and drift gill nets cause the highest mortality levels for both cetaceans and pinnipeds, however, entanglements in long lines, mid-water trawls, and both trap and pot lines are also common. Tuna seines are particularly problematic for entanglement by dolphins. By-catch affects all cetaceans, both small and big, in all habitat types. However, smaller cetaceans and pinnipeds {{are most vulnerable}} as their size means that escape once they are entangled is highly unlikely and they frequently drown. While larger cetaceans are capable of dragging nets with them, the nets sometimes remain tightly attached to the individual and can impede the animal from feeding sometimes leading to starvation. Abandoned or lost nets and lines cause mortality through ingestion or entanglement. Marine mammals also get entangled in aquaculture nets, however, these are rare events and not prevalent enough to impact populations.|$|E
50|$|The company uses {{tamper-resistant}} {{stations in}} their process to avoid access by birds and <b>non-targeted</b> <b>species.</b>|$|R
50|$|Commercial fishing uses many {{different}} methods to effectively catch a large variety of species {{including the use}} of pole and line, trolling with multiple lines, trawling with large nets, and traps or pots. Sustainability of fisheries is improved by using specific equipment that eliminates or minimizes catching <b>non-targeted</b> <b>species.</b>|$|R
40|$|Commercial {{fisheries}} in the North Pacific Ocean and Bering Sea often interact with <b>non-targeted</b> <b>species,</b> especially long lived, slow growing, low fecund {{species such as}} sharks. This project investigates the demography and trophic ecology of salmon sharks and Pacific sleeper sharks caught as bycatch in Bering Sea pollock fisheries. Salmon sharks and Pacific sleepe...|$|R
25|$|Gillnets are so {{effective}} that their use is closely monitored and regulated by fisheries management and enforcement agencies. Mesh size, twine strength, {{as well as}} net length and depth are all closely regulated to reduce bycatch of <b>non-target</b> <b>species.</b> Gillnets have {{a high degree of}} size selectivity. Most salmon fisheries in particular have an extremely low incidence of catching <b>non-target</b> <b>species.</b>|$|E
25|$|Pesticide use {{raises a}} number of {{environmental}} concerns. Over 98% of sprayed insecticides and 95% of herbicides reach a destination other than their target species, including <b>non-target</b> <b>species,</b> air, water and soil. Pesticide drift occurs when pesticides suspended {{in the air as}} particles are carried by wind to other areas, potentially contaminating them. Pesticides are one of the causes of water pollution, and some pesticides are persistent organic pollutants and contribute to soil contamination.|$|E
25|$|Shrimp {{trawling}} {{can result}} in very high incidental catch rates of <b>non-target</b> <b>species.</b> In 1997, the FAO found discard rates up to 20 pounds for every pound of shrimp. The world average was 5.7 pounds for every pound of shrimp. Trawl nets in general, and shrimp trawls in particular, {{have been identified as}} sources of mortality for species of finfish and cetaceans. Bycatch is often discarded dead or dying by the time it is returned to the sea, and may alter the ecological balance in discarded regions. Worldwide, shrimp trawl fisheries generate about 2% of the world's catch of fish in weight, but result in more than one third of the global bycatch total.|$|E
50|$|Commonly used avicides include strychnine, DRC-1339 (3-chloro-4-methylaniline hydrochloride, Starlicide) and CPTH (3-chloro-p-toluidine, {{the free}} base of Starlicide), and Avitrol (4-aminopyridine). Chloralose {{is also used}} as an avicide. In the past, highly {{concentrated}} formulations of parathion in diesel oil were also used, applied by aircraft spraying over the nesting colonies of the birds.It is impossible to minimize risk from avicides for <b>non-targets</b> <b>species.</b>|$|R
5000|$|During fishing trips, {{fishermen}} {{collect their}} intended species along with unintended or <b>non-targeted</b> <b>species.</b> The Council {{is working with}} the BSAI and the GOA Groundfish FMPs to create guidelines for the management of groundfish groups and species that are considered to be vulnerable to the adverse effects of overfishing. [...] The animals are ranked for management priority based on complexes, groups, and then species.|$|R
5000|$|While {{they have}} proven {{effective}} over the short-term, animals {{tend to become}} conditioned over time and can even be drawn to the sounds once they habituate {{to the lack of}} real danger and the presence of sustenance. [...] Only acoustic harassment devices that cause actual pain {{have been found to be}} effective over the longer term. The devices can cause hearing damage in <b>non-targeted</b> <b>species</b> and design changes in the fishing gear, fishing methods, and fish farm design to provide a permanent solution are preferable.|$|R
25|$|Discarding {{affects the}} {{environment}} in two ways; firstly, through increased mortality to target and <b>non-target</b> <b>species,</b> particularly at juvenile life-history stages, and secondly, through alteration of food webs by supplying increased levels of food to scavenging organisms on the sea floor, and to sea birds. The survival of discarded fish and invertebrates is variable and depends on species and fishing gear used. For example, species such as the Pacific halibut caught in long-line fisheries in the Bering Sea, or lesser spotted dogfish in beam trawls in the English Channel have survival rates of between 88-98%. Survival rates of roundfish discards are significantly lower, and this mortality is included in most International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) stock assessments. Crustaceans {{are thought to be}} more hardy, though survival of crustaceans is variable; for instance, a survival rate of 25% is assumed for Nephrops norvegicus, the Norway Lobster, whilst survival rates of almost 100% have been demonstrated for the hermit crab, Pagurus bernhardus.|$|E
25|$|Islands are {{particularly}} suitable for restoration as once cleared of an introduced species {{they can be}} kept cleared of these species {{by virtue of being}} an island. Species removal is intensive and expensive, and methods used must be carefully chosen as to not create too much impact on <b>non-target</b> <b>species.</b> Feral cats, goats and three species of rats are among the most damaging species introduced to islands (Moors & Atkinson 1984). The differences in size, lifestyle and behaviour preclude the use of the same techniques for all of them, but with many species a range of techniques needs to be used in order to ensure success. Larger animals, such as goats and pigs, can effectively be hunted; in the case of Round Island, in Mauritius, all the goats were eliminated by a single marksman. On larger islands ecologists use a Judas goat, where a radio collared goat is released into the wild. This goat is then followed and groups it joins are removed. To remove cats a combination of techniques is needed, both hunting, trapping and poisoning. Cats are more difficult to hunt than goats and pigs, requiring the use of experienced hunters and night hunting.|$|E
2500|$|The {{inefficiency}} of terrier work means that, unlike poisons and traps, {{there is}} no danger that a species can be wiped out over a large area, and little chance that an adult will be terminated with unseen young still in the den. [...] In addition, collateral damage, {{in the form of}} killing <b>non-target</b> <b>species,</b> is zero.|$|E
50|$|Studies of {{long-term}} {{effects on the}} marine environment have not been carried out, including damage to <b>non-targeted</b> <b>species.</b> Results of the devices are mixed, and they have proved ineffective in some circumstances, especially over the long term, while design improvements such as electric fences to keep seals from climbing into enclosures, gear modification to exclude certain species, and keeping aquaculture plants clean of dead fish have often been effective at solving the problem of keeping predatory species away. Reports indicate that {{in contrast to the}} harassment devices, the deterrent devices have been very effective in dealing with cetacean bycatch.|$|R
25|$|Cetacean bycatch is the {{incidental}} {{capture of}} <b>non-target</b> cetacean <b>species</b> such as dolphins, porpoises, and whales by fisheries. Bycatch {{can be caused}} by entanglement in fishing nets and lines, or direct capture by hooks or in trawl nets.|$|R
40|$|World {{has shown}} a {{spectacular}} increase in operation in recent years. A recent article (Anon., 1992) makes the following observations on the world gill net fishing: "The drifl: gill net fleet of the world act as curtains of death, land huge quantities of <b>non-targeted</b> <b>species,</b> prevent the salmon from reaching their native spawning sites, and also entangle, mutilate and drown thousands of marine mammals. The situation is alarming that more than 1, 000 fishing vessels operate large sized nets hanging as much as 11 metres deep and spanning about 50 km, the combined length of the fleet's nets operating in the Pacific, Atlantic and Indian Oceans amounting to about 50, 000 km, more than the distance around the earth"...|$|R
2500|$|Ratting and rat-baiting are not {{the same}} activities. [...] Ratting is the legal use of dogs for the pest control of non-captured rats in an {{unconfined}} space, such as a barn or field. [...] Due to rat infestations, terriers are now being used for ratting to hunt and kill rats in the major cities around the world, including New York City, as well as nations like the United Kingdom, Vietnam, and others. Although ratting with working terriers is far less efficient than using rodenticide or rat traps, the killing of <b>non-target</b> <b>species</b> is zero.|$|E
2500|$|Gene drives {{may provide}} a {{powerful}} tool to restore balance of ecosystems by eliminating invasive species. Concerns regarding efficacy, unintended consequences in the target species as well as <b>non-target</b> <b>species</b> have been raised particularly in the potential for accidental release from laboratories into the wild. Scientists have proposed several safeguards for ensuring the containment of experimental gene drives including molecular, reproductive, and ecological. Many recommend that immunization and reversal drives be developed in tandem with gene drives in order to overwrite their effects if necessary. [...] There remains consensus that long-term effects must be studied more thoroughly particularly in the potential for ecological disruption that cannot be corrected with reversal drives.|$|E
2500|$|Seamounts enhance {{water flow}} through {{localised}} tides, eddies, and upwelling, and these physical processes may enhance primary production. [...] Seamounts may therefore {{be considered as}} hotspots of marine life; fauna benefit from the enhanced hydrodynamics and phytoplankton supply, and thrive on the slopes and summits. [...] Suspension feeders, such as gorgonian sea fans and the cold-water corals like Lophelia pertusa, often dominate the rich benthic (seafloor-dwelling) communities. The enhanced abundance and diversity of fauna {{is not limited to}} benthic species, as fish are known to aggregate over seamounts. [...] Unfortunately, this knowledge has led to increasing commercial exploitation of seamount fish by the fishing industry, and a number of seamount fish populations have already been depleted. [...] Part of HERMIONE research will assess the threats and impacts of human activities on seamounts, including comparing data from seamounts in different stages of fisheries exploitation to understand more about the impacts of fishing activities., both on target species and <b>non-target</b> <b>species,</b> and their habitats.|$|E
40|$|We {{assessed}} {{the state of}} knowledge regarding the effects of large-scale pollution with neonicotinoid insecticides and fipronil on <b>non-target</b> invertebrate <b>species</b> of terrestrial, freshwater and marine environments. A large section of the assessment {{is dedicated to the}} state of knowledge on sublethal effects on honeybees (Apis mellifera) because this important pollinator is the most studied <b>non-target</b> invertebrate <b>species.</b> Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths), Lumbricidae (earthworms), Apoidae sensu lato (bumblebees, solitary bees) and the section “other invertebrates” review available studies on the other terrestrial species. The sections on freshwater and marine species are rather short as little is known so far about the impact of neonicotinoid insecticides and fipronil on the diverse invertebrate fauna of these widely exposed habitats...|$|R
50|$|Since 2011, ISSF {{has been}} {{sponsoring}} {{a series of}} cruises in which scientific researchers work with fishers on actual fishing excursions to find methods to mitigate bycatch and better understand how fish behave around FADs. These globally coordinated cruises {{have been in the}} Indian and Pacific Oceans and have lasted anywhere from 11 days to two and a half months. The purpose of these cruises is to gain scientific inputs to initiate improvements within the tuna purse seine fishery to reduce the environmental impact of fishing for tuna with FADs. Each cruise accomplished a series of tasks to test improved gear designs and study the behavior of tuna and <b>non-targeted</b> <b>species</b> gathering at FADs. Researchers of shark bycatch and behavior have also a primary subject of research during these cruises.|$|R
5000|$|Biological {{control is}} {{the method of}} control that is the least-damaging to {{ecosystems}} not typified by monoculture, like forested areas, while also being the most efficient in terms of costs.Biological control {{is the foundation of}} the differentiation between native species living in complex ecological balance and non-native invasive species. It is nature's method of maintaining ecological balance. [...] Herbicide application and human-managed labor such as mowing, tilling, and pulling may be preferred for managing unwanted vegetation on land that is highly-disturbed by human activity, such as agricultural land. For more complex ecosystems such as forests, trampling and other physical disturbance such as soil compaction, the spreading of seeds from clothing, chemical toxicity, unwanted <b>non-targeted</b> <b>species</b> damage, demanding human labor, petrochemical consumption, and other factors are eliminated or greatly reduced with effective biological control..|$|R
2500|$|As {{chemical}} {{treatments are}} often ineffective for long term control and mechanical removal is likewise difficult and costly for long-term control, kudzu {{makes a good}} candidate for biological control. There are several biological means that are already in place and more that may be implemented to control the growth of kudzu. Bacterial blights, insect herbivory, and insect seed predation occur in high levels in field populations of kudzu. [...] Seed predation is quite prevalent, with up to 81% of seeds incurring damage in populations studied in North Carolina. A different survey found twenty-five different species of insect feeding on the kudzu. From this survey, several leaf-feeding beetles and sawflies that have no other known hosts were identified. [...] A separate study also found two weevils that attacked the stems of kudzu and eight beetles that complete larval development in the kudzu roots. When evaluations of potential control agents are made, the range of the control agents must be taken into account. Organisms that feed on kudzu will often feed on similar <b>non-target</b> <b>species</b> that are important in agriculture such as soybeans and hog-peanuts. Potential control agents have to be rejected if they are shown in lab and field tests to feed on these non-target plants.|$|E

50|$|Due {{to their}} {{intrinsic}} properties {{and patterns of}} use, biocides, such as rodenticides or insecticides, can cause adverse effects in humans, animals and the environment and should therefore be used with the utmost care. For example, the anticoagulants used for rodent control have caused toxicity in <b>non-target</b> <b>species,</b> such as predatory birds, due to their long half-life after ingestion by target species (i.e. rats and mice) and high toxicity to <b>non-target</b> <b>species.</b> Pyrethroids used as insecticides {{have been shown to}} cause unwanted effects in the environment, due to their unspecific toxic action, also causing toxic effects in non-target aquatic organisms.|$|E
