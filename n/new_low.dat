5|$|As Barbara {{moved toward}} the Canadian Maritimes, it began to undergo an extratropical transition, {{completing}} the transition by late on August15 just south of Nova Scotia. However, the Canadian Hurricane Centre assessed Barbara as remaining tropical until after it turned northward and struck eastern Nova Scotia on August16. At this time, a trough developed to the southeast of the storm, and Barbara later tracked just west of Newfoundland. A <b>new</b> <b>low</b> formed {{in association with the}} trough, and as Barbara rapidly headed northward, the developing center moved more slowly. However, the <b>new</b> <b>low</b> quickly gained strength and became the more intense of the two storm systems. Barbara then stalled near Goose Bay and lost its tropical identity, dissipating late on August16.|$|E
5|$|By {{the morning}} of November 10, all of Ida's {{convection}} appeared displaced to the northeast and the forward motion of the storm slowed substantially. Additionally, the storm had begun to undergo an extratropical transition near the United States Gulf Coast. Shortly before making landfall near Dauphin Island, Alabama, the storm completed its extratropical transition. Ida crossed Mobile Bay shortly thereafter and maximum winds decreased below gale-force. After slowly tracking eastward for several hours, the surface circulation of Ida dissipated over the Florida Panhandle, late on November 10. However, energy from the storm {{led to the formation}} of a <b>new</b> <b>low</b> off the coast of North Carolina. This <b>new</b> <b>low</b> quickly intensified and became a powerful nor'easter that caused substantial damage throughout the Mid-Atlantic States. By November12, the system attained a minimum pressure of 992mbar (hPa; 29.29inHg) along with winds of 65mph (100km/h). The extratropical low weakened the following day and moved out to sea after stalling along the North Carolina Coastline. The remnants of the cyclone persisted through November17, by which time it had moved over Atlantic Canada.|$|E

5|$|A strong upper-level trough {{moving through}} the southeastern United States forced Danny northeastward, which also {{triggered}} the formation of another low pressure system near the coast of North Carolina early on August 29. Although this low formed within Danny's cyclonic envelope, satellite imagery indicated {{that it did not}} have the characteristics of a tropical cyclone. Therefore, it is not considered to be a continuation of Danny. The <b>new</b> <b>low</b> caused the tropical storm to degenerate into a trough about 275mi (445km) southeast of Wilmington, North Carolina, and Danny's remnants were absorbed into a developing frontal zone shortly thereafter.|$|E
5|$|An area of low {{pressure}} moved generally eastward from Oklahoma and produced heavy rains from Missouri to Ohio on February 8. By February 9, it had reached Kentucky. A new, secondary {{low pressure}} system formed over Georgia along the warm front {{associated with the}} primary low. As the secondary low matured along the U.S. East Coast, the initial center weakened rapidly, and heavy rainfall developed over the Carolinas in association with the <b>new</b> <b>low.</b> Mixed precipitation soon spread across the Mid-Atlantic States, and heavy snow began to fall from New Jersey northward by 1200 UTC on February 9.|$|E
5|$|On July 22, a <b>new</b> <b>low</b> {{pressure}} area developed {{while the}} tropical wave was located over the Gulf of Honduras. However, {{this area of}} disturbed weather was unable to develop further, because the storm quickly moved over the Yucatán Peninsula. After its one-day passage through the peninsula, the system entered the Bay of Campeche, but lacked any deep convection. This time, though, the wave quickly developed the deep convection it needed to become a tropical cyclone. In part, {{this was due to}} the Sierra Madre Oriental enhancing large-scale rotation of the disturbance by forcing air to flow parallel to the mountain range, instead of through it. As a result, the National Hurricane Center in Miami, Florida designated it as Tropical Depression Seven, just 255miles east-southeast of Tuxpan, Mexico. Early on the July 24, the cyclone was upgraded to a tropical storm with winds of 40mph (65km/h) and received the name Gert.|$|E

5|$|The {{storm was}} located 150mi (240km) south of Lafayette, Louisiana as it drifted northward and winds were {{estimated}} to have peaked at 50mph (85km/h). However, in the post-season, {{it was determined that}} Arlene peaked near landfall with winds of 60mph (95km/h). As Arlene neared the coast, the storm began to weaken due to the interaction with land. Arlene made landfall about 40mi (65km) southeast of Lafayette, Louisiana at 2100UTC (4 p.m.CST). The operational landfall intensity was 50mph (85km/h) but it was lowered to 45mph (75km/h) in the post season. Upon making landfall, Arlene became the earliest landfalling tropical cyclone in Louisiana history. Arlene weakened quickly to a tropical depression shortly after landfall. The storm further degenerated to a remnant area of low-pressure on the afternoon of May 31. The remnant of the storm lingered in the Southern United States until June 2, when it dissipated over South Carolina. Although the original low pressure system dissipated, a new, non tropical center formed further north over Virginia. This <b>new</b> <b>low</b> quickly tracked northeast, brushing the southern coast of New England before moving over Nova Scotia and losing its identity on June3.|$|E

Lisa catches Lady Gaga just before she leaves town to apologize, and after being forgiven she and Lady Gaga perform a duet together. With Lady Gaga's assistance, Lisa and the entire town of Springfield realize that being oneself is better than being like anyone else.

40|$|This project utilises {{creative}} {{practice as}} research, and involves writing and discussing four sample episodes {{of a proposed}} six-part dramatic, black-comedy 1 television mini-series titled The <b>New</b> <b>Lows.</b> Combined, the creative project and accompanying exegesis seeks to illuminate and interrogate some of the inherent concerns, pitfalls and politics encountered in writing original Asian-Australian characters for television. Moreover, this thesis seeks to develop and deliberate on characters that would expand, shift and extend concepts of stereotyping and authenticity as they are used in creative writing for television. The protagonists of The <b>New</b> <b>Lows</b> are the contemporary and dysfunctional Asian-Australian Lo family: the Hong Kong immigrants John and Dorothy, and their Australian-born children Wendy, Simon and Tommy. Collectively, they struggle to manage the family business: a decaying suburban Chinese restaurant called Sunny Days, which is stumbling towards imminent commercial death. At the same time, each of the characters must negotiate their own personal catastrophes, which they hide from fellow family members out of shame and fear. Although there is a narrative arc to the series, I have also endeavoured to write each episode as a selfcontained story. Written alongside the creative works is an exegetical component. Through the paradigm of Asian-Australian studies, the exegesis examines the writing process and narrative content of The <b>New</b> <b>Lows,</b> alongside previous representations of Asians on Australian and international television and screen. Concepts discussed include stereotype, ethnicity, otherness, hybridity and authenticity. However, the exegesis also seeks to question the dominant cultural paradigms through which these issues are predominantly discussed. These investigations are particularly relevant, since The <b>New</b> <b>Lows</b> draws upon a suite of characters commonly considered to be stereotypical in Asian-Australian representations...|$|R
