5|$|Although {{authorised}} in 1864, work on {{the bridge}} was delayed by negotiations over the proposed Chelsea Embankment, since the bridge's design could not be completed until the exact layout of the <b>new</b> <b>roads</b> being built on the north {{bank of the river}} had been agreed. While plans for the Chelsea Embankment were debated, Ordish built the Franz Joseph Bridge over the Vltava in Prague to the same design as that intended for the Albert Bridge.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in {{the early}} 1970s, the Arboretum was {{upgraded}} with <b>new</b> <b>roads</b> and plantings funded by major gifts from oil industry figure Floyd R. Newman, and in 1982 the Arboretum was formally named in his honor (as were several other buildings and facilities at Cornell over the years).|$|E
5|$|Proposals for a route {{avoiding}} Central London {{had been}} in place since the early 20th century due to increasing levels of traffic. In 1910, the London Traffic Division of the Board of Trade had built up schemes for <b>new</b> <b>roads,</b> including what became the North Circular Road, {{which was designed to}} skirt the extent of urban development along suburbs.|$|E

5|$|Three {{completely}} different routings of US-50 have existed between Green River and Ely, Nevada. The route between these cities has become progressively shorter as <b>new</b> <b>roads</b> have been paved through this largely uninhabited region of both states. The earlier routings were {{a result of}} a dispute between Utah and Nevada over which auto trails would be paved and converted to U.S. Highways.|$|E
5|$|At Syracuse, he {{repaired}} {{the city}} walls and the temples of the gods. He had <b>new</b> <b>roads</b> built and pushed to keep roads in good condition. He had planned to rebuild the palace of Polycrates at Samos, to finish the temple of Didymaean Apollo at Ephesus and to found a city {{high up in the}} Alps. He planned to dig a canal through the Isthmus of Corinth in Greece and sent a chief centurion to survey the work.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{both the}} {{technological}} gap between civilisations and the centuries-long colonial era, Portugal was a driving force {{in the development and}} shaping of all Portuguese Africa since the 15th century. In the 1960s and early 1970s, to counter the increasing insurgency of FRELIMO forces and show to the Portuguese people and the world that the territory was totally under control, the Portuguese government accelerated its major development program to expand and upgrade the infrastructure of Portuguese Mozambique by creating <b>new</b> <b>roads,</b> railways, bridges, dams, irrigation systems, schools and hospitals to stimulate an even higher level of economic growth and support from the populace.|$|E

50|$|The {{original}} {{road was}} surveyed through hilly and challenging terrain. Complaints {{that the road}} needed to be modified led to a <b>new</b> <b>road</b> being surveyed in 1825. The <b>New</b> Princetown <b>Road</b> diverted west from Hazel Grove to Fredericton, then turned north-west through Springfield and Summerfield to Kensington. At Kensington the road turned north to Malpeque. The <b>new</b> <b>road</b> later became Routes 2 and 20. After the <b>new</b> <b>road</b> opened in 1827, the original road fell into disuse.|$|R
5|$|In 1976, Caltrans {{said that}} SR54 {{had not been}} {{included}} in plans {{for the next six}} years, {{due to a lack of}} funding and a shift in priorities from <b>new</b> <b>roads</b> to maintenance. The water subcommittee of the U.S. House of Representatives later recommended that the wildlife refuge be put on hold, since the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) had not finished their proposal. Over the next few years, support for the project was expressed by a local citizens' group, the Chula Vista city council, and the San Diego Chamber of Commerce.|$|E
5|$|In this period, Gaddafi {{expanded}} his control over northern Chad, building <b>new</b> <b>roads</b> and erecting {{a major new}} airbase, Ouadi Doum, meant to better support air and ground operations beyond the Aouzou Strip. He also brought in considerable reinforcements in 1985, raising Libyan forces {{in the country to}} 7,000 troops, 300 tanks and 60 combat aircraft. While this build-up took place, significant elements of the GUNT passed over to the Habré government, as part of the latter's policy of accommodation.|$|E
5|$|Many {{progressive}} {{reforms and}} developments {{were made in}} Chamba under the British. In 1863, the first Post office was established in Chamba and a daily mail service and a primary school. In December, 1866, a hospital was opened by Doctor Elmslie of the Kashmir Medical Mission. In the late 1860s two <b>new</b> <b>roads</b> to Dalhousie via Kolri and Khajiar were built. Gopal Singh, who ruled from 1870 to 1873, after abdicating, was responsible for building the grand Jandarighat Palace as his summer residence.|$|E

5|$|The A1 route was {{designated}} in 1921 by the Ministry of Transport under the Great Britain road numbering scheme. Through the inner boroughs of the City, Islington, and Haringey it uses existing roads and streets; {{when it reaches}} {{what is now the}} outer London borough of Barnet, some stretches of purpose-built <b>new</b> <b>roads</b> were built, and others have been widened and made into dual carriageways. In 1828, John Benjamin Macneill, chief engineer to Thomas Telford, used Roman cement and gravel to solve problems with wear and tear on the Archway Road section of what is now the A1, an innovative technique that was used there for the first time, and is the basis for modern road building.|$|E
5|$|The manor of Ruislip {{became part}} of the Ruislip-Northwood Urban District, though it {{remained}} under the ownership of King's College, Cambridge. A town-planning competition led to a design being chosen that envisaged the clearance of much of the woods and historic sites in Ruislip to make way for 7,642 homes, enough for 35,000 residents, across the manor. A planning scheme adapted from the original was presented to the public in February 1913 and was approved by the Local Government Board in September 1914. The outbreak of the First World War halted all construction work, by which time only three <b>new</b> <b>roads</b> had been completed. It did not resume again until 1919.|$|E
5|$|Clearances around Albion Hill {{began in}} the 1950s. From 1959, the narrow, densely {{populated}} terraces between Albion Hill and Morley Street were cleared and replaced with landscaped open space and seven tower blocks—Brighton's first such buildings. The first, Highleigh, opened on 11 May 1961. Like its later neighbours, it has 11 storeys. The steep Richmond Street was severed {{as part of this}} redevelopment; its lower section was replaced by a zig-zag path down the hillside and a short road called Richmond Parade, and <b>new</b> <b>roads</b> (Grove Hill and Ashton Rise) were built between the tower blocks and across the slope of the hill. Similarly, the lowest section of Carlton Hill was renamed Kingswood Street when it was redeveloped in the 1960s: Brighton Art College (now part of the University of Brighton) was extended in 1967 by Brighton borough architect Percy Billington, taking up a large corner plot.|$|E

50|$|Camberwell <b>New</b> <b>Road</b> {{is part of}} the A202. It {{goes from}} Camberwell to Kennington Oval. It was a turnpike road {{authorised}} by Act of Parliament in 1818, just after the construction in 1816 of the first Vauxhall Bridge, which it leads to, thus providing a second route from Camberwell to central London. Camberwell <b>New</b> <b>Road</b> is the longest Georgian Road in England. London Bus routes 36, 185 and 436 run the whole length of Camberwell <b>New</b> <b>Road.</b>|$|R
5|$|In 1971, the Environment Secretary, Peter Walker {{announced}} {{the entire length}} of the A303 would be upgraded as part of a <b>new</b> <b>roads</b> programme that would deliver 1,000 new miles of motorway by 1980. A bypass of Marsh was opened in 1976; it was (and remains) the only dual carriageway upgrade of the A303 through the Blackdown Hills. By the mid-1980s, the A303 had been extended from its original fork by Micheldever Station, next to the A30, eastwards to meet the M3 motorway, and was a completely uninterrupted dual carriageway westwards as far as Amesbury. Ilminster was bypassed around this time; however the new road was built as single carriageway with 3 lanes, which caused a serious safety hazard leading to several fatal accidents.|$|E
5|$|In {{the past}} few decades, {{the legacy of the}} League of Nations started to be {{reviewed}} by historians as the League Archives at Geneva were better explored, and the United Nations faced similar troubles to those of the interwar period. The current consensus state that, even though the League failed to achieve its ultimate goal of world peace, it did manage to build <b>new</b> <b>roads</b> towards expanding the rule of law across the globe; strengthened the concept of collective security, giving a voice to smaller nations; helped to raise awareness to problems like epidemics, slavery, child labor, colonial tyranny, refugee crisis and general working conditions through its numerous commissions and committees; and paved the way for new forms of statehood, as the mandate system put the colonial powers under international observation.|$|E
5|$|The A1 is {{the most}} recent {{in a series of}} routes north out of London to York and beyond. It was {{designated}} in 1921 by the Ministry of Transport under the Great Britain road numbering scheme, comprising existing roads and streets, mostly historic, and later using stretches of purpose-built <b>new</b> <b>roads</b> in what is now the outer London borough of Barnet. The Archway Road section was built by Thomas Telford using Roman cement and gravel, an innovative technique that was used there for the first time, and is the basis for modern road building. The route closely follows the historic route of the Great North Road, though from 1954 it has diverted round the congested suburbs of Finchley and High Barnet along modern roads constructed in the 1920s and 1930s.|$|E

5|$|The first road in {{the region}} was the Buffalo Trace, an old bison trail that ran from the Falls of the Ohio to Vincennes. After the capitol was {{relocated}} to Corydon, several local roads were created to connect the new capitol to the Ohio River at Mauckport and to New Albany. The first major {{road in the}} state was the National Road, a project funded by the federal government. The road entered Indiana in 1829, connecting Richmond, Indianapolis, and Terre Haute with the eastern states and eventually Illinois and Missouri in the west. The state adopted the advanced methods used to build the national road on a statewide basis and began {{to build a new}} road network that was usable year-round. The North-South Michigan Road was built in the 1830s, connecting Michigan and Kentucky and passing through Indianapolis in the middle. These two <b>new</b> <b>roads</b> were roughly perpendicular within the state and served as the foundation for a road system to encompass all of Indiana.|$|E
5|$|The largest {{change has}} been the {{downgrading}} of the former through route of New England Street in favour of a new north–south road, Fleet Street, which diverges to the west. This has allowed {{a large part of}} New England Street to be narrowed, pedestrianised and provided with cycle lanes. In contrast, Cheapside is expected to take a much higher volume of traffic, as it becomes the main east-west route in the New England Quarter, taking traffic between London Road and Fleet Street, the main north–south road. Two <b>new</b> <b>roads,</b> Stroudley Road and Billinton Road, have been built {{to the west of the}} new Fleet Street, between there and the railway line. These give access to the car park, Bellerbys College and a new pick-up and drop-off point immediately outside the side entrance to the station. Two new pedestrianised squares—Ann Square and New England Square—have also been created within the core site.|$|E
5|$|The state's {{roads were}} in poor {{condition}} when Combs became governor. The Automotive Safety Foundation found {{that two-thirds of}} Kentucky's federal roads were below standards for existing traffic demands. It further found that {{twenty percent of the}} state's major city streets were inadequate, that another fifty-five percent would soon be inadequate due to increasing traffic, and that half of the state's secondary roads were unfit for modern industrial traffic. To address these problems, Combs issued $100million in bonds to increase funding for highways, appointing Earle Clements as state highway commissioner to oversee the correction of the road issues. One of the <b>new</b> <b>roads,</b> the Mountain Parkway, which connected Combs' native Eastern Kentucky to Central Kentucky, was later renamed the Bert T. Combs Mountain Parkway in Combs' honor. Because of generous funding in Combs' budget, Kentucky finished its portions of the Interstate Highway System much sooner than surrounding states such as Virginia and Tennessee.|$|E

40|$|In many {{practical}} problems, it {{is desirable}} to find an equilibrium. For example, equilibria are important in transportation engineering. Many urban areas suffer from traffic congestion.

However, in reality, a <b>new</b> <b>road</b> can actually worsen traffic congestion. It is therefore extremely important that before we start a road expansion project, we first predict the effect of this project on traffic congestion. When a <b>new</b> <b>road</b> is built, some traffic moves to this road to avoid congestion on the other roads; this causes congestion on the <b>new</b> <b>road,</b> which, in its turn, leads drivers {{to go back to their}} previous routes, etc. Wha...|$|R
