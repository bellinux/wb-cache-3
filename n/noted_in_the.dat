5|$|Stravinsky's score {{contains}} many novel features for its time, including experiments in tonality, metre, rhythm, stress and dissonance.

5|$|A {{distinct}} feature <b>noted</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> entire temple {{complex is}} the stucco style embellishments built with brick masonry {{and finished with}} plaster. The motifs crafted are of floral (lotuses) and geometric designs, on the walls, in the niches and on arches. Apart from paintings on the walls, the niches in the interior parts of the shrines have 300 well crafted images of deities. The profusion of paintings and images on {{the internal and external}} faces of the temple was considered an auspicious feature, instead of leaving the wall surfaces blank. However, the images and murals on the outer walls of the temple have since been demolished.|$|E
5|$|As of 2017, {{just under}} 20,000 protein-coding genes {{are seen to}} be {{expressed}} in the human, and some 400 of these genes are brain-specific. The data that has been provided on gene expression in the brain has fuelled further research {{into a number of}} disorders. The long term use of alcohol for example, has shown altered gene expression in the brain, and cell-type specific changes that may relate to alcohol use disorder. These changes have been <b>noted</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> synaptic transcriptome in the prefrontal cortex, and are seen as a factor causing the drive to alcohol dependence, and also to other substance abuses.|$|E

5|$|As suicide {{requires}} a willful attempt to die, some feel it therefore cannot {{be said to}} occur in non-human animals. Suicidal behavior has been observed in salmonella seeking to overcome competing bacteria by triggering an immune system response against them.

On the other hand, Lev Gumilev, drawing on {{the name of the}} Rus' leader (as recorded in Arabian sources), hypothesizes that this leader was Sveneld, a Varangian chieftain whose wealth was <b>noted</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Primary Chronicle under 945.|$|E
