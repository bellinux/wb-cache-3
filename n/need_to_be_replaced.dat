5|$|A {{regional}} {{transit authority}} {{was formed in}} the early 1990s to build and operate a light rail system that would use the bus tunnel within Downtown Seattle. The authority, later named Sound Transit, gained voter approval in November 1996 to build a $3.9billion system between Seattle–Tacoma International Airport, Downtown Seattle, and the University District. In 1998, Sound Transit found that the rails in the tunnel would <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>replaced</b> {{at a cost of}} up to $110 million and require a full closure for two years. The plan would also require the purchase of new hybrid electric buses to replace the Breda fleet, as the electrical systems were incompatible. Convention Place station would have to be abandoned as it was too shallow to support a northern extension under Interstate 5.|$|E
5|$|When Bart, Lisa and the {{students}} of Springfield Elementary go {{on a field trip}} to the post office, Bart gets a coupon book as a souvenir, which he gives to Homer as a birthday present. Homer uses one of his coupons at a tire business on a free wheel balancing, but is informed that all four tires in his car are faulty and <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>replaced.</b> While waiting for the new tires, Homer meets Wally Kogen, a travel agent. They go to Moe's and watch a special on the Super Bowl on TV. Wally says his agency has a charter bus going to the game and suggests to Homer that he can fill the bus and ride for free. Moe agrees to come as do other prominent men of Springfield.|$|E

5|$|In 2009, Superior Court Judge Jack Panella won a $770 bid on {{the auction}} website eBay to {{flip the switch}} {{and turn on the}} Peace Candle during the candle-lighting {{ceremony}} on November 27, 2009. In November 2010, Easton Holiday Committee Chairwoman Sandy O'Brien-Werner voiced doubts that the current candle structure would last until 2014 as previously projected and might <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>replaced</b> sooner. She expressed concern at the cost of such a venture, claiming the Peace Candle cost $14,640 in 2010 alone for maintenance and operation and that an altogether new structure would cost at least $35,000. In response, six-year-old MaryElizabeth Soffera and eight-year-old Katie Dietrich, two cousins from Williams Township who loved the Peace Candle, opened a snow cone stand during a garage sale {{to raise money for the}} candle. They raised $23, which they presented to Mayor Sal Panto Jr. during a November city council meeting.|$|E

The ships themselves are projected on the screen as a pattern of dots, rather than connected lines, and the monitor they are projected on is a General Electric 15-inch black and white television screen, specially modified for the game. The rudimentary artificial intelligence constructed by Bushnell has the enemy ships firing towards the quadrant of the screen that the player's rocket is in, rather than a more complicated tracking algorithm.|$|E

25|$|The {{degree of}} flexing and the {{material}} constituting the diaphragm affects the maintenance life of the equipment. Generally stiff metal diaphragms may only displace a few cubic centimeters of volume because the metal can not endure large degrees of flexing without cracking, but the stiffness of a metal diaphragm allows it to pump at high pressures. Rubber or silicone diaphragms are capable of enduring deep pumping strokes of very high flexion, but their low strength limits their use to low-pressure applications, and they <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>replaced</b> as plastic embrittlement occurs.|$|E
