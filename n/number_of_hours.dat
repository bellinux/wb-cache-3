5|$|Since 1990 {{the total}} <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>hours</b> flown {{annually}} by the GA sector has {{remained in the}} range 1.25–1.35million, the dominant sector being traditional GA flying, which accounts for 0.6million per year. An overall increase in aircraft numbers combined with nil growth in hours flown has brought the annual average utilisation per aircraft down from 157 hours in 1984 to 103 hours in 2002. The decline in asset utilisation has led to speculation that the economic health of the GA industry is weakening, though the lack of data on profitability makes this difficult to confirm.|$|E

The driver of a CMV is required to keep a record of working hours using a log book, outlining the total <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>hours</b> spent driving and resting, as well as the time at which the change of duty status occurred. In lieu of a log book, a motor carrier may keep track of a driver's hours using Electronic Logging Devices (ELDs), which automatically record {{the amount of time spent}} driving the vehicle.|$|E

40|$|Two common {{assumptions}} in neoclassical labor supply {{models are}} relaxed by introducing hours restrictions and endogenous wages into a labor supply model. First, we incorporate {{the possibility that}} an individual is faced with a limited availability of jobs with different, distinct, <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>hours.</b> Moreover, the wage rate is allowed {{to depend on the}} <b>number</b> <b>of</b> working <b>hours.</b> The latter implies a nonlinear budget constraint. The model is estimated for data from a Dutch labor mobility survey. The results for females suggest not only the existence <b>of</b> <b>hours</b> restrictions, but also of a nonlinear budget constraint. Including both features generates a simulated hours distribution much more in line with the actual data than does a standard Tobit model. ...|$|R
5|$|A person's {{history of}} taking {{paracetamol}} is somewhat accurate for the diagnosis. The {{most effective way}} to diagnose poisoning is by obtaining a blood paracetamol level. A drug nomogram developed in 1975, called the Rumack-Matthew nomogram, estimates the risk of toxicity based on the serum concentration of paracetamol at a given <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>hours</b> after ingestion. To determine the risk of potential hepatotoxicity, the paracetamol level is traced along the nomogram. Use of a timed serum paracetamol level plotted on the nomogram appears to be the best marker indicating the potential for liver injury. A paracetamol level drawn in the first four hours after ingestion may underestimate the amount in the system because paracetamol may still be {{in the process of being}} absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Therefore, a serum level taken before 4hours is not recommended.|$|E
5|$|A {{study of}} central bank {{interventions}} on the US dollar and Deutsche mark found only limited {{evidence of any}} substantial effect on deviations from UIRP. UIRP {{has been found to}} hold over very small spans of time (covering only a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>hours)</b> with a high frequency of bilateral exchange rate data. Tests of UIRP for economies experiencing institutional regime changes, using monthly exchange rate data for the US dollar versus the Deutsche mark and the Spanish peseta versus the British pound, have found some evidence that UIRP held when US and German regime changes were volatile, and held between Spain and the United Kingdom particularly after Spain joined the European Union in 1986 and began liberalizing capital mobility.|$|E
5|$|Around one {{in three}} {{subjects}} develops systemic symptoms; after a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>hours,</b> or rarely, delayed for more than 24 hours. Symptoms typically include nausea, vomiting, abdominal or chest pain, agitation, headache, generalised sweating and hypertension. Other non-specific systemic effects such as malaise and lethargy are also common. Rarely, other effects are reported such as neurological manifestations, fever and priapism (uncontrolled erection of the penis). Severe pain usually persists for over 24 hours after being bitten. Symptoms of envenomation may linger for weeks or even months. Rare complications include localised skin infection, seizure, coma, pulmonary edema, or respiratory failure. Children, the elderly, or those with serious medical conditions are at much higher risk of severe effects resulting from a bite. Infants have died within hours of a bite, but adult fatalities have taken up to 30 days.|$|E

Finally, by 13:45 the order for the Commandos to withdraw was given.

5|$|The Minister for Defence, Senator George Pearce, {{appointed}} McCay to {{the newly}} created post of Inspector General of the AIF on 29 November 1915, with the local rank of major general. McCay was involved in recruiting campaigns, and inspected AIF units and reported on their training and equipment. He proposed a new training regime, with a national syllabus that increased the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>hours</b> per week of training and the duration of training to twelve weeks. This led to strikes at the camps at Casula and Liverpool. Rioting soldiers clashed with police at Circular Quay and at Central Station striking soldiers were shot and one killed by soldiers sent to return them to Liverpool. As a result, new liquor laws were introduced, including six o'clock closing.|$|E
5|$|The {{first two}} Air Medals {{presented}} {{by the president of}} the United States to the Civil Air Patrol went to Hugh Sharp and Eddie Edwards, who conducted the rescue in the S-39. This successful program, which spotted 173 German U-Boats, dropped 57 depth charges, hit 10 of the U-Boats, and sank two of them, was inevitably discontinued after the end of the second World War. Many of the planes used specifically for this program are now parts of exhibits, replaced by new aircraft that are more suited to teaching young students to fly and performing search and rescue, the current missions of the Civil Air Patrol. Currently, CTWG has two Cessna 172s, two Cessna 182s and one Cessna 182T with Garmin G1000 Glass cockpit. Connecticut Wing has the highest <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>hours</b> flown per aircraft of any state in the North East Region, and ranks high on a national scale.|$|E

5|$|On {{the night}} of 17 January 1943, 24 Japanese {{aircraft}} attacked Turnbull Field, destroying one of No.6 Squadron's Hudsons and damaging the remainder. While the squadron was unable to conduct any operations for several weeks after this attack, the damaged aircraft were subsequently repaired. In March No.6 Squadron participated in the Battle of the Bismarck Sea by searching for barges and attacking lifeboats carrying survivors from the Japanese ships which had been sunk. Due to the unit's high rate of flying activities, No.6 Squadron's Hudsons increasingly suffered from mechanical problems, and this {{may have contributed to}} a drop in the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>hours</b> flown by the squadron from March 1943. On 20 July No.9 Operational Group, which commanded No.6 Squadron and other RAAF units in New Guinea, banned the squadron's Hudsons from taking part in any further combat operations due to their poor condition. It was decided at about this time to re-equip the squadron with Australian-built Bristol Beauforts. To effect this change No.6 Squadron's Hudson crews flew their aircraft back to Australia and were replaced by new aircrews equipped with Beauforts from September. During this period the squadron's ground crew were frequently used as labourers as they did not have any aircraft to maintain.|$|E
