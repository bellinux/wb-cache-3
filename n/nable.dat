2500|$|In July 2004, Mayor Lito Atienza {{spearheaded the}} {{development}} and implementation of the English Proficiency Program in all schools being funded by the city government. A committee on the use of English was formed a week after the directive was passed, and it was headed by the then PLM President Benjamin Tayabas. Aside from Tayabas, the other members of the committee were City Administrators Dino <b>Nable,</b> Secretary to the Mayor Emmanuel Sison, Chief of Staff Pia Sacro, Division of City Schools-Manila Superintendent Ma. Luisa S. Quiñones, City College of Manila President Rodrigo Malunhao and Eulogio [...] "Amang" [...] Rodriguez Institute of Science and Technology President Maura Bautista. A few weeks later, the English as a Second Language (ESL) Center was established at the PLM before the program's full implementation on September 1. [...] Initially, the city's campaign was derided by some critics and groups, but later lauded and even followed by other institutions. Two years after, the American Chamber of Commerce in the Philippines and the European Chamber of Commerce in the Philippines began taking part in a massive English retooling effort among private and government schools in partnership with the Department of Education.|$|E

40|$|The {{influence}} of some impurities on the aging and {{the lifetime of}} sodium-sulfur and sodium-sodium experimental cells is studied. The aging mechanism involves an ion exchange between impurities of the reactants and the sodium ions of the E-alumina lattice. In particular, introduction of potassium changes lattice parameters of;~-alumina nd Na * mobility. An important conclusion of this work is that pure E-alumina does allow the transfer of large amounts of total charge (i. e., of sodium ions) before failure. The present figures are in excess of 1700 A-hr /cm 2. These results have <b>nabled</b> the authors to con-struct Na-S cells which have given in excess of 4, 000 cycles or 16, 000 hr of continuous operation.

40|$|Molecular beam epitaxy of Cu on Cu (111) was studied using {{thermal energy}} He scattering, inthe {{temperature}} range between 100 and 450 K. Three-dimensional growth {{was observed in}} the whole temperature range. To determine the onset of various diffusion processes, submonolayer films formed by deposition at low temperature were annealed. Annealing proceeds in two steps.

The study observed 45 high school students with disabilities during instruction in core content areas. Findings indicated that there were significant differences in student and teacher variables depending on the presence of curriculum modifications. When curriculum modifications were pro-vided, students were engaged in more academic-related responses and fewer competing behaviors and teachers were engaged in fewer classroom management activities.

40|$|The {{protease}} inhibitor leupeptin prevented multiple s ep replication of an influenza virus (A/swine/ 1976 / 31, HINl) mediated by staphylococcal proteases. It also suppressed virus eplication {{and development of}} fatal pneumonia in mice co-infected with the virus and Staphylococcus aureus. With avian influenza viruses it could be demonstrated convincingly that post-translational proteolytic leavage of the viral haemagglutinin glycoprotein by cellular proteases i essential for infectivity, spread of the virus in the host organism and pathogenicity (Rott & Klenk, 1986). In a host cell where an appropriate protease for cleavage is not present, {{and as a consequence}} infectious virus cannot be produced, infectivity can be recovered by treatment ofnon-infectious virus by trypsin in vitro (Klenk et al., 1975; Lazarowitz & Choppin, 1975). Recently it could be shown that Staphylococcus aureus, which is most frequently isolated from patients with influenza pneumonia (Stuart-Harris etal., 1985), secretes serine proteases that activate the infectivity of several influenza A viruses by proteolytic cleavage of the haemagglutinin (Tashiro et al., 1987 a, b).
