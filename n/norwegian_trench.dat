50|$|Norway's history {{begins on}} the west coast, {{particularly}} in Rogaland.

There are many artifacts from the Stone Age in Rogaland. The preliminary oldest traces of humans are found in a settlement on Galta, Rennesøy, near the ferry terminal Mortavika and Vista on Randaberg. In the beginning there has been sure short visits by people from the south who hunted along the coast. It is thought that people came from Doggerland, the North Sea land area between Denmark and England, which disappeared when the ice retreated and sea levels rose.

[...] The trench is not a subduction-related oceanic trench, where one tectonic plate is being forced under another. The <b>Norwegian</b> <b>Trench</b> was created by fluvial erosion processes during the later Tertiary age. Pleistocene glaciers and ice-sheets further deepened the trench. During the main glaciations, the Skagerrak Trough was the meeting point for ice from southeastern Norway, southern Sweden {{and parts of the}} Baltic causing a relatively fast-moving ice stream that passed south of the Norwegian coast and then turned north, eventually reaching deepwaterat about 62°N. The material carried by the ice stream was then deposited in the North Sea fan.

40|$|Investigations {{were made}} {{to find out if}} there are areas with {{suitable}} environments for ballast water exchange (BWE) in the Skagerrak and the <b>Norwegian</b> <b>Trench.</b> Suitable conditions may be areas of certain depths (preferably > 200 meters) or distance from the coast (preferably > 200 nm or > 50 nm). Certain oceanographical, biological and envitonmental issues should also be considered. In the Skagerrak there is no area > 50 nm from the coast, but there is a small area within the Swedish territorial waters with depth > 200 m. There is an area > 50 nm from the coast with depth > 200 m in the northern <b>Norwegian</b> <b>Trench.</b> Discharged ballst water in the BWE areas will be transported towards a coast or protected area. The main distance between the potential Skagerrak BWE area and the Natura 2000 areas are 10 to 15 nm. There are strong currents in both BWE areas and discharges could be transported over large areas during the following month. The entire Skagerrak area would be reached. Most parts of the costal zone would be reached within a week. The probability that a BW discharge will reach the nearby Natura 2000 areas is high. The shortest drift time to the protected areas along the Swedish coast and to the Norwegian coast is only a few days. A ship would have to stop or greatly reduce its speed to complete a BWE within the proposed Skagerrak area. In the northern <b>Norwegian</b> <b>Trench,</b> there is no major shipping lane nearby. The wave climate in the Skagerrak may not cause major concern for the safety for large ships. In the northern <b>Norwegian</b> <b>Trench</b> BWE area of interest, wave heights are a significant hazard on board most ships. Nutrient levels are not low enough to efficiently reduce the survival rate of the organisms introduced by BW. Discharged pollutants could normally affect the protected areas if transported to the area. There is no way to say what specific salinity level kill BW organisms since there are many different organisms in the BW. As a rule of thumb, there is always a risk that they may survive. If the organisms are harmful, they can or will affect vulnerable native organisms. The environment at the BWE area or in nearby protected areas, possibly with important assets, can be affected by the BW, although it is dependant on the BW contents. There is a wide variety of what it can contain. If the organisms or pollutants are harmful to a single species or to entire ecosystems, there is a clear risk of affecting protected areas. Important assets like fish and mussel farms can be affected. Competing or predatory species may cause harm, especially in spawning areas of fish or on benthic native species. Circulation of the central Skagerrak surface waters and eddies in the northern Norwegian Coastal Current, increase the risk of ships taking up previously discharged BW. The waters in the BWE areas have strong stratification, which prevents mixing with deep water. The risk of uptake is high, albeit with a reduced concentration. In many of the referenced texts however, the concentrations of the organisms are not of major importance. New organisms may survive and reproduce even at low starting numbers. Most results indicate that the proposed BWE areas are not suitable for BWE with reference to the requirements in the Ballast Water Convention and G 14...|$|E

Highest CP and coccolithophore cell abundance occurred in a diatom bloom in fully mixed waters off Helgoland, rather than in two distinct coccolithophore blooms in the central North Sea and Western English Channel. Estimates of coccolithophore contributions to total PP and nanoplankton PP were generally < 5 %, apart from in a coccolithophore bloom at the Western English Channel Observatory (E 1) where coccolithophores contributed up to 11 % and at Helgoland where they contributed ~ 23 % to nanoplankton PP. Variability in CP was influenced by cell numbers, species composition and cell-normalised calcification rates under both in situ conditions and in the experimental bioassays.

40|$|Abstract. Coccolithophores {{are a key}} {{functional}} group {{in terms of the}} pelagic production of calcium carbonate (calcite), although their contribution to shelf sea biogeochemistry, and how this relates to environmental conditions, is poorly constrained. Measurements of calcite production (CP) and coccolithophore abundance were made on the northwest European shelf to examine trends in coccolithophore calcification along natural gradients of carbonate chemistry, macronutrient availability and plankton composition. Similar measurements were also made in three bioassay experiments where nutrient (nitrate, phosphate) and pCO 2 levels were manipulated. Nanoflagellates (< 10 μm) dominated chlorophyll biomass and primary production (PP) at all but one sampling site, with CP ranging from 0. 6 to 9. 6 mmolCm− 2 d− 1. High CP and coccolithophore abundance occurred in a diatom bloom in fully mixed waters off Heligoland, but not in two distinct coccolithophore blooms in the central North Sea and Western English Channel. Coccolithophore abundance and CP showed no correlation with nutrient concentrations or ratios, while significant (p < 0. 01) correlations between CP, cell-specific calcification (cell-CF) and irradiance in the water column highlighted how light availability exerts a strong control on pelagic CP. In the experimental bioassays, Emiliania-huxleyi-dominated coccolithophore communities in shelf waters (northern North Sea, <b>Norwegian</b> <b>Trench)</b> showed a strong response in terms of CP to combined nitrate and phosphate addition, mediated by changes in cell-CF and growth rates. In contrast, an offshore diverse coccolithophore community (Bay of Biscay) showed no response to nutrient addition, while light availability or mortality may have been more important in controlling this community. Sharp decreases in pH and a rough halving of calcite saturation states in the bioassay experiments led to decreased CP in the Bay of Biscay and northern North Sea, but not the <b>Norwegian</b> <b>Trench.</b> These decreases in CP were related to slowed growth rates in the bioassays at elevated pCO 2 (750 μatm) relative to those in the ambient treatments.

40|$|Based on {{the results}} from the annual stock {{assessment}} of the European hake (Merluccius merluccius) by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea, a fourfold increase of the spawning stock biomass can be observed over the last decade. As a leading country in fisheries research, Norway has as of yet contributed surprisingly little to the research to hake. In this study I present first attempts to describe the distribution, abundance as well as spawning and nursery areas, and prey spectrum of the European hake in the North Sea and along the Norwegian coast. Survey data from the Institute of Marine Research from 2006 - 2014 and landing records obtained from the Norwegian Directorate of Fisheries from 2000 - 2014 as well as stomachs collected in 2014 were examined and analyzed. In the period analyzed catch data showed increasing landings from bottom trawl fisheries in the North Sea {{and to a lesser extent}} in the gillnet fisheries along the Norwegian mid-west coast. Concurrently abundance index of hake (CPUE) increased in the North Sea, the Skagerrak and along the coast, showing highest densities east of Shetland Islands in July. It appears that the increase in commercial hake landings can be related to the observed increase in spawning stock biomass. Fish in spawning condition were found along the slope west of the <b>Norwegian</b> <b>trench.</b> As a result of the current regimes in the North Sea hake egg and larvae may be transported from the spawning grounds on the south-west <b>Norwegian</b> <b>trench</b> into the Skagerrak.

In terms of %F Norway pout was shown to be the most important prey species, followed by Atlantic herring and Atlantic mackerel. An overlap of the hake distribution with areas of highest abundance of Norway pout as well as feeding grounds for herring and mackerel may explain their dietary importance.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{cyclonic}} and anticyclonic eddies are numerous in the Skagerrak. Nevertheless a systematic analysis of their statistics appears to be missing. This is the topic of the present thesis in which we investigate the frequency of their appearance, whether they have preferred areas of occurrence, the number of cyclones versus anticyclones, and their sizes. In addition we perform a kinetic energy analysis in which we discriminate between the kinetic energy associated with the mean motion (the mean kinetic energy, MKE) and the energy associated with the variance (the eddy kinetic energy, EKE). The rationale is to investigate whether there is a correlation between the EKE and the preferred areas of occurrence, if any. The ``data'' we use are the 24 hour average daily snapshots produced by MET Norway's operational coastal ocean forecasting model NorKyst 800. The period we study is the two years 2013 and 2014 which results in about 700 snapshots. The eddy detection method we use is the so called Okubo-Weiss method. We find that overall there are more cyclones than anticyclones, that there is a strong correlation between kinetic energy and generation of eddies, that in general that most of the eddies prefer to be within the <b>Norwegian</b> <b>Trench</b> area, and that the eddies are more frequent in three specific areas along the Trench, namely the inner and deepest part of the Trench, outside of Torungen/Arendal and south Lista at the the southern tip of Norway...|$|E
40|$|Based on the North Sea International Bottom Trawl Survey, {{the number}} of species {{recorded}} after 20 hauls is used as an index of biodiversity at a spatial scale of 10 * 10 nm. The results show a clear pattern: species richness is lowest in the central North Sea and highest in Scottish waters, in the Kattegat and in the Channel area. When the community is split into its northerly and southerly components, the former reaches its highest diversity in waters typically deeper than 100 m and the latter in waters less than 50 m. The area of high richness of northerly species extends from Scottish waters along the <b>Norwegian</b> <b>trench</b> into the Kattegat. High richness of southerly species is not restricted to the southern North Sea but is observed also along the Scottish coast and in the Kattegat. These patterns are discussed in relation to hydrographical features that may control these differences. Temporal trends indicate that both components are characterized by a gradual increase in species richness over the past 25 years, a process that has affected the whole area while rates of change did hardly differ between the components or areas. A standardized index of abundance also indicates long-term gradual increases for both northerly and southerly species, although in this case the increase in southern species is larger. I argue that overexploitation is a more plausible explanation for the observed phenomena, although climate change may have had add-on effects...|$|E
40|$|In situ {{sediment}} denitrification {{rates were}} determined {{in the major}} areas of deposition of the North Sea, using the acetylene block technique. In addition, nitrous oxide profiles of the water column were determined. Nitrous oxide production generally occurred in the photic zone possibly due to nitrification; and throughout the water column in the German Bight region. Consumption at depth was possibly due to reduction in the anoxic microzones of faecal pellets, concentrated at the thermocline. Saturation of surface waters was 102. 2 % compared to 130. 3 % in the German Bight region. Calculated flux of nitrous oxide to the atmosphere was 9. 5 x 10 6 kg yr - 1, over half of which was produced in the German Bight. Sediment denitrification rates varied through three orders of magnitude; the highest value of 150 µmol m - 2 d - 1 was recorded in the <b>Norwegian</b> <b>Trench.</b> Nitrous oxide production by the sediments was low (1. 1 µmol m - 2 d - 1 max.), and was undetectable at half of the sites. Sediment nutrient profiles exhibited porewater nitrate concentrations exceeding that of the overlying water suggesting that denitrification was fuelled by nitrification, which, in turn was related to other environmental variables. A significant positive relationship existed between in situ denitrification rate and the nitrate content of the upper sediment. Extrapolation of the rate to the total area of deposition in the North Sea suggests that denitrification is responsible for a minimum loss of 7. 5 - 12 % of the total annual nitrogen contaminant input...|$|E
40|$|Traditionally, marine {{ecosystem}} structure {{was thought to}} be bottom-up controlled. In recent years, {{a number of studies have}} highlighted the importance of top-down regulation. Evidence is accumulating that the type of trophic forcing varies temporally and spatially, and an integrated view – considering the interplay of both types of control – is emerging. Correlations between time series spanning several decades of the abundances of adjacent trophic levels are conventionally used to assess the type of control: bottom-up if positive or top-down if this is negative. This approach implies averaging periods which might show time-varying dynamics and therefore can hide part of this temporal variability. Using spatially referenced plankton information extracted from the Continuous Plankton Recorder, this study addresses the potential dynamic character of the trophic structure at the planktonic level in the North Sea by assessing its variation over both temporal and spatial scales. Our results show that until the early- 1970 s a bottom-up control characterized the base of the food web across the whole North Sea, with diatoms having a positive and homogeneous effect on zooplankton filter-feeders. Afterwards, different regional trophic dynamics were observed, in particular a negative relationship between total phytoplankton and zooplankton was detected off the west coast of Norway and the Skagerrak as opposed to a positive one in the southern reaches. Our results suggest that after the early 1970 s diatoms remained the main food source for zooplankton filter-feeders east of Orkney–Shetland and off Scotland, while in the east, from the <b>Norwegian</b> <b>Trench</b> to the German Bight, filter-feeders were mainly sustained by dinoflagellates...|$|E

The general features of the hydrography was determined, and the distribution of air and sea temperatures, temperature anomalies, and salinities are presented. Significant differences in echo integrator readings were observed: between day and night, between the two ships and in relation to obtained catch. Bottom trawl catches varied between 45 and 1545 kg per hour. Best catches were taken in the southeastern part of the North Sea. In total, herring, whiting and haddock amounted to 26, 25 and 21 per sent respectively while Norway pout, flatfish and other species each were less than 10 per cent in weight. Distribution, size, age etc. are reported in detail for the dominating species, and the relationship between the distribution and the abiotic environment is discussed, Young herring were found in greatest concentrations in the Bløden area. Sprat were found in the coastal waters, characterized by relatively low salinity, while Norway pout were most numerous in Atlantic water in the northern part on the North Sea plateau. Blue whiting and coalfish were mainly observed along the western slope of the <b>Norwegian</b> <b>trench</b> below the core of the Atlantic water which penetrates into the North Sea...|$|E
40|$|The copepod Calanus finmarchicus is an {{important}} part of the Norwegian Sea ecosystem because of its dominating abundance and importance as prey for fish larvae and adult planktivorous fish. The abundance of C. finmarchicus on the Norwegian shelf is generally low in winter, whereas in spring the shelf is replenished by individuals that overwinter at depth, either in fjords or in the deep basins of the Norwegian Sea. In the present study shelf recruitment is investigated using an individual-based model for C. finmarchicus coupled to the HYbrid Coordinate Ocean Model and a biophysical model. The model was set up on a nested grid along the west coast of Norway and used to study the shelf recruitment originating from the Norwegian Sea. We investigate the effect of wind, currents and the timing of Calanus ascent on the shelf abundance of C. finmarchicus. The most important findings are the following: (1) periods of large on-shelf transport are connected with strong westerly winds associated with passing low-pressure systems; (2) the transport of overwintering adults onto the shelf determines the total shelf abundance prior to mid-summer; (3) the early spring bloom on the shelf causes increased shelf population of C. finmarchicus in the spring and throughout the summer compared to the areas further off-shore; and (4) the entry routes taken by C. finmarchicus are related to bathymetry; in particular, the deep trenches around Halten Bank and the <b>Norwegian</b> <b>trench</b> are favoured places to enter the Norwegian shelf. 2014 - 07 - 0...|$|E
40|$|The world ocean can broadly {{be split}} into two regimes, the shallow shelf seas up to a few hundred metres deep and the deep open ocean which is {{typically}} 4 - 5 km deep. These two regimes are separated by a narrow region of steep topography. This steep topography acts to limit the exchange to those processes that break the assumptions of geostrophy. This exchange, however, is important on both a local and global scale. The shelf seas are {{an important source of}} dense water masses, ventilating the deep ocean, control of the flux of mid-depth open ocean heat to glacial fronts, supply of nutrients from the open ocean to sustain enhanced productivity on the shelf, and export of the carbon drawn-down by this productivity into the deep ocean. This problem will be explored through two themes, one exploring the role of the bolus transport and one exploring an integral framework. The bolus transport is de ned as the transport as a result of co-variances in layer thickness and layer velocity. This has previously been extensively applied for the atmosphere and the action of eddies in the Southern Ocean. Here the bolus transport driven by the action of the internal tide near the shelf edge is considered. First we consider a sinusoidal internal wave on the interface of a two well mixed layer ocean. This leads to a theoretical scaling for the bolus transport of (ca 2) =(2 hi) {{in the same direction as}} the propagation of the wave. The bolus transport was then calculated for eight moorings across four locations. For the surface layer these transports were in the range 1. 09 to 0. 1 m 2 s 1 and for the bottom layer were in the range 1. 06 to 0. 04 m 2 s 1. These observational estimates compare favourably with the estimates from the theory, with the theory within 40 % of the observed values. This bolus transport is balanced locally by a time-mean velocity of equal magnitude but directed off shelf in both layers. The Walin Framework is an integral framework describing the rate at which water crosses density surfaces. This is used to diagnose the formation, or destruction, rate of water within density classes across the European Shelf, bounded by the 200 m isobath, the southern limit of the Celtic Sea and the Norwegian Coast. This formation rate makes the largest contribution to the exchange across the shelf edge. This reveals three distinct regimes: an off-shelf transport in the lightest classes of 0. 5 Sv, an on-shelf transport in the middle density classes of 1. 5 Sv, and an off shelf transport in the densest classes of 1 Sv. Mapping these along the shelf edge indicates that much of the shelf does not reach the lightest classes so only the intermediate and dense regime is applicable. The lightest regime primarily exists along the southern section of the <b>Norwegian</b> <b>Trench.</b> This implies two circulations: a down-welling circulation of 1 Sv across much of the European Shelf and an across shelf transport of 0. 5 Sv, on-shelf across much of the shelf edge balanced by an off shelf transport in the <b>Norwegian</b> <b>Trench.</b> This down-welling circulation is similar to previous estimates of the total transport across the European Shelf Break...|$|E
