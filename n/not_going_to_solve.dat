40|$|The society, {{which has}} {{produced}} form {{and shape of}} the traditional European city does not exist any more. ” (Siebel 2004) Raising our conscience on this circumstance as it as been pointed to by Walter Siebel does make planning issues re-appear in the light of knowledge that problems tackled on the basis of realities no longer there, are <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be <b>solved.</b> In spite of this knowledge however the discourse around the European city seems to narrow a perspective to fully grasp reasons for the stagnation of its spatial form in the backdrop of socio-cultural change. For this reason I want to include another city into the discussion, which by Siebel’s definition is a typical European city and therefore fit for a comparison with postfeudal European Cities around which Siebel´s theory is oriented. At the same time however Istanbul lifts itself from an euro-centred context by never having fully internalized culturally the mechanisms of spatial production based on western capitalism. In this contribution I will look at the role of this cultural heritage for the prevalence of spatial specificities. Without the cultural backbone of civic management and social redistribution Istanbul is now, in the late stage of capitalism, a city that has integrated the global tendencies of neo-liberalism directly into the production of urban space. It demonstrates therefore clearly the realities of society through the characteristics of the built environment. Possibly the image that prevails with its new more explicit forms of urban segregation and the rise of gated communities is a glimpse upon social realities which have gained validity also for the European City.

40|$|Traumatic {{brain injury}} (TBI) {{is a major}} cause of deaths {{following}} accidents and {{a major cause of}} disablement and morbidity among the survivors. The clinical problem of treating this vast number of patients is <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be <b>solved</b> by a dramatic medical breakthrough. Rather, it must be tackled by seeking a better appreciation of the condition that these people present. The paper by Levine et al (this issue, pp 173 – 81) 1 adds to the growing body of studies in which neuroimaging techniques have been used to study long term changes in survivors of moderate or severe TBI. Levine et al carried out PET in six patients who had sustained TBI roughly four years previously and in 11 healthy controls. Separate scans were obtained during the encoding and retrieval phases of a simple cued recall task and attention was focused on the differences in activation between the two phases. The individual findings varied with focal lesions. However, as a group they had more widespread activation during the retrieval phase than the controls, with reduced activation in areas involved in normal memory retrieval. This was regarded as evidence for neural reorganisation due to diffuse axonal injury. This study combined the application of neuroimaging technology with an understanding of the cognitive mechanisms involved in the relevant experimental task. Levine et al also paid due attention to both between group variation and within group variation. They considered but rejected the idea that these changes might just have been an artefact of impaired performance. Indeed, the same pattern was apparent in three patients whose retrieval was at a normal level, although some aspects were seen only in the three patients with poor performance. Two issues need to be addressed in further research. Firstly, would similar changes be seen in patients with mild rather than severe TBI? The prevalence of mild TBI is many times greater than that of severe TBI, and many suspect that mild TBI may give rise to persistent yet subtle deficits even in patients who otherwise make a good functional recovery. 2 Of course, such deficits may have predated the TBI and were not caused by it. 3 This problem is inherent in any study that compares groups defined {{on the basis of their}} clinical history. So a second issue raised by this study is this: are the apparent differences between patients with TBI causally related to their injuries? Ideally, one would like to have premorbid evidence from the people in question. Of course, the number of people who have undergone any specific PET procedure before sustaining a TBI is vanishingly small, but other evidence may be available. Bigler and Snyder 4 compared computed tomography with magnetic resonance imaging carried out in four people before and after they sustained mild TBI. The authors failed to find any gross differences but more detailed analyses might have revealed clinically significant changes. With the increasingly widespread use of neuroimaging techniques, comparisons of this sort should be entirely feasible in the future. ...|$|R

[...] On April 8, 2017, the US Navy said the USS Carl Vinson strike group was sailing to the Western Pacific from Singapore, and two days later, President Trump told [...] Fox Business: [...] "We are sending an armada, very powerful" [...] towards the Korean peninsula. His comment, and its apparent confirmation by Defense Department officials, [...] "fueled a war frenzy at major newspapers and networks" [...] and led to the North Korean government warning of a possible thermonuclear war. However, on April 18 the Pentagon clarified that the strike group had instead headed south for scheduled training exercises with the Australian navy but would be arriving at the Korean peninsula the following week. Meanwhile, on April 16 Vice President Mike Pence visited South Korea, viewed the Demilitarized Zone which separates North from South Korea, and warned that the U.S. [...] "era of strategic patience" [...] toward North Korea's nuclear and missile programs is over. He added that [...] "all options are on the table." [...] The same day the North Korean government launched a missile test, which failed but which Pence described as a provocation. Trump continued to express the hope that China would help to rein in North Korea's nuclear ambitions.|$|E

Some of Bhyrappa's prominent novels (such as Vamshavruksha, Tabbaliyu Neenaade Magane, Parva, and Saartha) have strong roots in ancient Indian philosophical tradition, thus inviting severe criticism from the Navya writers and from others. Bhyrappa supported N. R. Narayana Murthy when the latter was criticized by the media and the public regarding the controversy over playing an instrumental version of the national anthem at an important occasion. He also backed N. R. Narayana Murthy regarding Kaveri issue saying riots and protests are <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>solve</b> the issue. Bhyrappa had a debate with Girish Karnad in the publication Vijaya Karnataka regarding the religious tolerance of 18th century Mysore ruler Tippu Sultan. In Bhyrappa's novel Aavarana, he accuses Tippu Sultan of being a religious fanatic who could not stand Hindus in his court. Bhyrappa had substantiated the argument based on several historic sources written in India during Tippu Sultan's rule. One of the issues Bhyrappa raised was the usage of Persian word bin (which is used to refer to a person as a [...] "son of") in Government of Karnataka records even during modern times. This practice started during Tippu Sultan's rule, which according to Bhyrappa was one of the several methods used to enforce Islamic rule on Hindus. The book discusses other methods used by Tippu Sultan to convert Hindus to Islam. Bhyrappa backs his claims with historical references. This was criticized by Girish Karnad, who portrays Tippu Sultan as a secular ruler in his plays. Bhyrappa accused Karnad of giving an inaccurate account of Tippu Sultan in his plays.|$|E

He remained CGS for three years, after which he {{was promoted to}} Chief of the Defence Staff (CDS)—the professional head of all the British Armed Forces—on 2 May 2003, succeeding Admiral Sir Michael Boyce (later Lord Boyce). As CDS, Walker criticised some of the media coverage of British deployments in Iraq. In particular, he claimed that attacks on the Black Watch were [...] "enhanced" [...] due to news reports on their location. He {{went on to say that}} [...] "a result of the media coverage, there could well have been a response by those who wished us ill to go and meet us with something like a bomb". His comments were rejected by a spokesman for the National Union of Journalists, who retaliated [...] "When generals turn around and start blaming reporters for their own mistakes, it is a sign they aren't doing their own jobs properly". Also in 2004, Walker, along with General Sir Mike Jackson, then Chief of the General Staff, attracted controversy over reforms of the armed forces, which included the amalgamation of several army regiments to form larger regiments, leading to the loss of historic names.In an interview with the BBC in October 2005, Walker suggested that the army's recruitment had been adversely affected by the Iraq War.

Rural Telephone sued for copyright infringement, but the Supreme Court ruled that the information in their compilation was factual, and that facts are not protected by copyright. The reality that Rural Telephone had done the work of creating the database did not entitle it to copyright protection.
