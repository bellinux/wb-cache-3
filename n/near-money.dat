50|$|The Money Market {{enables the}} {{commercial}} banks {{to use their}} excess reserves in profitable investment. The main objective of the commercial banks is to earn income from its reserves as well as maintain liquidity to meet the uncertain cash demand of the depositors. In the money market, the excess reserves of the commercial banks are invested in <b>near-money</b> assets (e.g., short-term bills of exchange), which are easily converted into cash. Thus, commercial banks earn profits without sacrificing liquidity.|$|E
50|$|Uruguay did not issue any {{paper money}} during this period, but paper <b>near-money</b> did appear. The Law of 26 January 1831 {{provided}} for a copper exchange company (Sociedad encambio del cobre) to issue notes for 1 and 5 pesos {{in exchange for}} copper coin. These notes were payable to bearer at sight after 90 days in gold onzas, silver pesos fuertes or patacones, or in subsidiary Brazilian silver, and they were received by government offices at par with silver and gold coin.|$|E
40|$|Treasury {{bills and}} other <b>near-money</b> assets provide owners with {{liquidity}} service benefits that {{are reflected in}} prices {{in the form of}} a liquidity premium. I relate time variation in this liquidity premium to changes in the opportunity cost of money: The liquidity service benefits of <b>near-money</b> assets are more valuable when short-term interest rates are high and hence the opportunity cost of holding money is high. Consistent with this prediction, the liquidity premium of T-bills and other <b>near-money</b> assets is strongly positively correlated with the level of short-term interest rates. Once short-term interest rates are controlled for, Treasury security supply variables lose their explanatory power for the liquidity premium. I argue that an analysis of scarcity and price of <b>near-money</b> assets is incomplete without taking into account the substitution relationship with money and its supply by the central bank. Payment of interest on reserves (IOR) could potentially reduce liquidity premia because IOR reduces the opportunity cost of at least one type of money (reserves). In the UK and Canada, however, the introduction of IOR did not shrink liquidity premia. Apparently, the reduction in banks' opportunity cost of money did not result in a broader fall in the opportunity costs of money for non-bank market participants...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the main}} features and policy implications of full reserve banking (FRB) proposals. It argues that whilst FRB advocates recognize the essential endogeneity of the money creation process, they have failed to understand the Post Keynesian and monetary circuitist analyses of endogenous money, which leads them to analytical errors, including: lending activity creates seigniorage privilege for commercial banks; inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon; the inability of distinguishing the actual from the planned supply of bank loans, and money to be spent from money hoarded; and the debt-free money proposition. The paper also argues that an FRB system is likely to exacerbate financial instability for several reasons, including: the obsessive focus on commercial banks, while ignoring non-bank financial intermediaries and shadow banking; a blind fascination for the safety and security of the payment system, with little consideration for the financing needs of capitalist economies; and an inherent deflationary bias. Furthermore, FRB arrangements would soon be undermined {{by the development of}} alternative <b>near-moneys.</b> Finally, FRB will nullify the automatic stabilisers of fiscal policy and lead to a de facto dominance of monetary policy and unelected central bankers over fiscal policy and democratic decision making...|$|R
40|$|In January, 1979, the Federal Reserve System {{published}} {{a set of}} new proposals for redefining existing monetary aggregates. The actual redefined aggregates were announced in February, 1980. These revisions were prompted by the heightened pace of regulatory changes and financial developments {{in recent years and}} by the numerous suggestions that the correlation between the conventional measures of money and total expenditure has weakened since the early 1970 s. ^ The purpose of the dissertation was to evaluate the merit of these suggestions and to determine the desirability of broader definitions of money. This required the derivation of broader monetary aggregates, which reflect the impact of these financial innovations, and a comparison of their stability and predictive performance with those of the conventional measures of the money stock. ^ The dissertation emphasized M(, 1) and M(, 2) (because they are much closer to aggregate expenditure than other measures of the money stock). Four <b>near-money</b> assets were considered. These include bank time deposits, deposits at savings and loan associations and mutual savings banks and credit union share drafts. ^ Because adequate data on the composition of the new forms of substitute financial assets are not available for the sample period (1964 : 1 - 1977 : 4), it was decided to derive, empirically, two broader monetary aggregates for M(, 1) and M(, 2) (i. e., M(, 1) * and M(, 2) *). The constant elasticity of substitution utility model was utilized for this purpose. ^ First, the elasticity of substitution and the liquidity coefficient were estimated for each <b>near-money</b> asset. These statistics were, then, employed in aggregating all the <b>near-money</b> assets and M(, 1) to form M(, 1) * and M(, 2) *. M(, 1) * was considered an approximation of either M(, 1) + (in the proposal) or M(, 1) B in the newly redefined monetary aggregates. M(, 2) * also approximates M(, 2) in the 2 ̆ 2 proposal 2 ̆ 2 but deviates slightly from the new M(, 2) because M(, 2) * excludes non-deposit financial assets such as RPs, money market mutual funds and the Eurodollar account. Finally the stability and predictive performance of M(, 1) * and M(, 2) * were compared with those of M(, 1) and M(, 2). Stability was evaluated by a dummy variable technique while the traditional money-income model and money supply equation (M = mB) were utilized in forecasting each of the four monetary aggregates. Specifically, for the money supply process, it was first assumed, that the monetary authorities can fully control the variations in B. Thus, the predictability of M would depend on the stability of the money multiplier. This was, later, relaxed and the money supply equation was simulated for each monetary aggregate. ^ The statistical results obtained from the study reveal the following: (a) All the four <b>near-money</b> assets, considered in the study, are good substitutes for money. (b) Estimates of the liquidity coeffiicient indicate that credit union shares are the most liquid of the <b>near-money</b> assets included in the study. The low coefficient for bank time deposit does not support the suggestion that all bank time deposits should be included in a transactions definition of money. (c) All the four monetary aggregates were stable during the sample period. However, M(, 1) was the most stable, followed by M(, 2), M(, 1) * and M(, 2) *. This contradicts the proposition that recent financial innovations have produced a shift in the conventional monetary aggregates, particularly M(, 1). (d) Overall, M(, 1) was the most predictable of the four monetary aggregates. Also, M(, 1) * has lower prediction error than either M(, 2) or M(, 2) *. This suggests that lower order definitions, whether narrowly or broadly defined, would be more useful than higher order definitions, in controlling aggregate expenditures. It also supports the recent decision by the Federal Reserve System to retain M(, 1) without significant modification. (M(, 1) A is not significantly different from the old M(, 1)). ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{substitutability}} between money and <b>near-money</b> assets {{during the period}} 1976 to 1996 in Switzerland. Financial developments have made a variety of instruments available to store wealth and conduct economic transactions. These developments have generated a "near money " component in households ' and businesses ' portfolio balances. It is important to evaluate the effect of "near-money " on money demand {{and the effectiveness of}} monetary policy. Towards this goal, five monetary assets: currency and demand deposits at commercial banks, demand deposits with the postal system, depOSits on transaction accounts with banks, savings depOSits and time deposits are considered. We evaluate the degree of substitutability among these assets using the Morishima elasiticity. Results show that various monetary assets substitute for one another. Consistent {{with a high degree of}} diversification, the Morishima elasticity is significantly larger when adjustment takes place in the price of a relatively broader monetary asset as compared with a narrower one. Targeting a broad monetary aggregate captures a variety of assets that contribute to liquidity and aggregat...|$|E
40|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{characteristics}} of individual commercial paper issuers, or about the reasons for the countercyclical issuance of commercial paper in the aggregate. To address these issues we construct a new panel dataset linking Moody's data on commercial paper issues with Standard and Poor's Compustat. High credit quality is a requirement for entry into the commercial paper market, but long-term credit quality (bond rating) is not a sufficient statistic for short-term quality. These characteristics allow firms to issuenear-riskless short-term debt and supply a <b>near-money</b> asset to themarket, thereby reducing their interest costs by the amount of the" commercial paper liquidity premium. We find that low-credit-quality firms have higher stocks of inventories and financial assets. In contrast to the countercyclicality of aggregate commercial paper, we find that firm-level commercial paper is procyclical. Our data support three explanations for this apparent contradiction, all of which recognize that commercial paper issuers are atypical. First, firms of high credit quality can use commercial paper to finance inventory accumulation during downturns. Second, they also can use commercial paper to finance countercyclical increases in accounts receivable. This suggests that commercial paper issuers serve as intermediaries for other firms during downturns. Third, it may be that portfolio demand for commercial paper [...] a highly liquid, safe asset [...] increases during downturns. ...|$|E
40|$|The famous {{new money}} Bitcoin is {{classified}} as a technical informational money (TIM). Besides introducing {{the idea of a}} TIM, a more extreme notion of informational money will be developed: exclusively informational money (EXIM). The informational coins (INCOs) of an EXIM can be in control of an agent but are not owned by any agent. INCOs of an EXIM cannot be stolen, but they can be lost, or thrown away. The difference between an EXIM and a TIM shows up when considering a user perspective on security matters. Security for an EXIM user is discussed in substantial detail, with the remarkable conclusion that computer security (security models, access control, user names, passwords, firewalls etc.) is not always essential for an EXIM, while the application of cryptography based information security is unavoidable for the use of an EXIM. Bitcoin seems to meet the criteria of an EXIM, but the assertion that "Bitcoin is an EXIM", might also be considered problematic. As a thought experiment we will contemplate Bitguilder, a hypothetical copy of Bitcoin that qualifies as an EXIM. A business ethics assessment of Bitcoin is made which reveals a number of worries. By combining Bitguilder with a so-called technical informational <b>near-money</b> (TINM) a dual money system, having two units with a fluctuating rate, may be obtained. It seems that a dual money can remedy some, but not all, of the ethical worries that arise when contemplating Bitcoin after hypothetically having become a dominant form of money. The contributions that Bitcoin's designers can potentially make to the evolution of EXIMs and TIMs is analyzed in terms of the update of the portfolio of money related natural kinds that comes with Bitcoin.
