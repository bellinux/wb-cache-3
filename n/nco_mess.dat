50|$|The {{apron and}} the old <b>NCO</b> <b>Mess</b> areas were used by the Royal Hong Kong Police Force as the Police Driving School {{premises}} {{for a number of}} years until re-sited.|$|E
50|$|The Indian Army {{follows a}} system {{similar to the}} British. A typical regiment/unit would have one mess and two clubs, one for the {{commissioned}} officers, club for the Junior Commissioned Officers (JCO) {{and one for the}} NCOs. Havildars/Daffadars (equivalent to Sergeants) are considered to be NCOs. The Air Force, however has an SNCO (Sr. <b>NCO)</b> <b>mess</b> for Warrant Officers and sergeants, while lower-ranking NCOs would be members of the NCO's mess.|$|E
25|$|A Junior ranks <b>mess,</b> Senior <b>NCOs</b> <b>mess,</b> Officers {{mess and}} the Academy Cadets Mess (which {{is the largest}} {{military}} mess in the southern hemisphere).|$|R

Senior <b>NCO's</b> <b>mess</b> jackets are the same except that the mess jacket has a shawl collar and there are three buttons {{on each side of}} the jacket rather than four, and rank stripes are worn on the right upper arm, and the buttons on the cuffs are smaller (female Senior <b>NCO's</b> <b>mess</b> jackets do not have cuff buttons). A royal blue waistcoat is worn with both variations.|$|R
50|$|On 18 January 2008, terrorists fired four rockets at short intervals. One {{landed on}} the roof of senior <b>NCO's</b> <b>mess,</b> and two inside the Mirage Rebuild Factory in the Pakistan Aeronautical Complex, {{although}} no casualties were reported.|$|R
5000|$|However, {{despite these}} initial difficulties, Murphy {{eventually}} did find part-time work in carpentry. His woodworking skills were ably demonstrated by a detailed carving {{he did for}} a Sergeant Stankey of the Canadian Army <b>NCOs</b> <b>mess</b> which he was introduced to by Johnston. Thanks to this and other jobs he did {{for members of the}} same establishment, Murphy was eventually voted in as an associate member. Johnston recalled later [...] "Being an associate member of the <b>NCOs</b> <b>mess</b> was a much sought-after honour in that region. It was quite funny to me at the time, although not to some others who voted against us, that Jack (who was after all a convicted republican) was invited to be an associate member of an army mess. For his part, Jack made some notable contributions - some beautiful carvings - including one particular one I remember which had a maple leaf and shamrock intertwined which was proudly put by Stankey behind the bar on display".|$|R
50|$|There is a {{memorial}} of the 95th Bomb Group and an active museum (the Red Feather Club) {{on the site}} of the former <b>NCO's</b> <b>Mess.</b> The former airfield hospital is similarly maintained as a museum and has periodic open days. The Guard Room now serves as Denham Village Hall. Elsewhere there are scattered remains of the outlying airfield buildings and bunkers in various degrees of condition.|$|R

During the period 1977 to 1979, members of the HQ Unit were accommodated in mainly the Air Force Officers and <b>NCO</b> <b>Messes</b> till the Union Hotel was purchased in 1979...|$|R
50|$|The {{regiment}} wears crimson trousers when in ceremonial, No. 1 or No, 2 dress, and (for {{officers and}} <b>NCOs)</b> <b>mess</b> dress. They may also appear in shirt sleeve order as worn by officers, including those on secondment to the regiment from other units. This distinctive feature, which {{is unique in}} the British Army, derives from the honour accorded to the 11th Hussars by Prince Albert, the future consort of Queen Victoria. The regiment, then based at Canterbury, formed the escort for the Prince from his arrival at Dover en route to his wedding in London. The Prince {{was so impressed with}} the bearing and turnout of the troops that he ordered that they should henceforth wear his livery as a mark of distinction.|$|R

Some bases have a joint <b>NCO</b> and Officers' <b>Mess.</b>|$|R
