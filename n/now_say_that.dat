500|$|When {{asked why}} he had not asked Meckiff to bowl {{at the other end}} to gauge the {{judgment}} of the other umpire, Lou Rowan, Benaud replied [...] "over the years I have always accepted the umpire's decision". The Australian captain was criticised for being acquiescent, and one of his predecessors Lindsay Hassett believed Meckiff should have been used at reduced speed. Rowan later indicated his concurrence with Egar, writing in his book The Umpire's Story, [...] "There is nothing I can <b>now</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> will alter the opinions already expressed that his [...] delivery was unfair". For his part, Meckiff said: [...] "the game is bigger than the individual" [...] and he backed Benaud's decision because doing otherwise [...] "could only have added fuel to the controversy".|$|E
500|$|As they read, the relatives' {{worst fears}} are soon realised; Buoso has indeed bequeathed his fortune to the monastery. They {{break out in}} woe and indignation and turn to Simone, the oldest present and a former mayor of Fucecchio, but he can offer no help. Rinuccio {{suggests}} that only Gianni Schicchi can advise them what to do, but this is scorned by Zita and the rest, who sneer at Schicchi's humble origins and <b>now</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> marriage to the daughter of such a peasant {{is out of the}} question. Rinuccio defends Schicchi in an aria [...] "Avete torto" [...] (You're mistaken), after which Schicchi and Lauretta arrive. Schicchi quickly grasps the situation, and Rinuccio begs him for help, but Schicchi is rudely told by Zita to [...] "be off" [...] and take his daughter with him. Rinuccio and Lauretta listen in despair as Schicchi announces that he will {{have nothing to do with}} such people. Lauretta makes a final plea to him with [...] "O mio babbino caro" [...] (Oh, my dear papa), and he agrees to look at the will. After twice scrutinizing it and concluding that nothing can be done, an idea occurs to him. He sends his daughter outside so that she will be innocent of what is to follow.|$|E

2500|$|The loss of Adado {{meant that}} it became the third to fall to the {{advancing}} Ethiopian forces, after Bandiradley and Beledweyne. This has left the ICU vulnerable, with Jowhar their furthermost stronghold ( [...] north-east of Mogadishu) after losing vast amounts of territory {{as quickly as they}} had gained several months ago. [...] Unconfirmed reports <b>now</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> this is due to a change in strategy by the ICU so as to employ guerilla warfare against the more technologically advanced Ethiopian military. [...] The leader of the Council of Islamic Courts executive body appeared to confirm this: [...] "The war is entering a new phase… we will fight Ethiopia for a long, long time and we expect the war to go everyplace." [...] Other Islamic leaders did explicitly threaten guerilla war within Ethiopia, by placing Addis Ababa as a target for suicide bombings. In response to this, the Ethiopian-backed TFG announced an amnesty to any ICU fighter who renounced violence by giving up arms. [...] "The government will not take revenge," [...] a government spokesman was reported to have said.|$|E
2500|$|Besides {{increasing}} the worldwide food supply, {{early in his}} career Borlaug stated that taking steps to decrease the rate of population growth will also be necessary to prevent food shortages. In his Nobel Lecture of 1970, Borlaug stated, [...] "Most people still fail to comprehend the magnitude and menace of the 'Population Monster'... If it continues to increase at the estimated present rate of two percent a year, the world population will reach 6.5 billion by the year 2000. Currently, with each second, or tick of the clock, about 2.2 additional people are added to the world population. The rhythm of increase will accelerate to 2.7, 3.3, and 4.0 for each tick of the clock by 1980, 1990, and 2000, respectively, unless man becomes more realistic and preoccupied about this impending doom. The tick-tock of the clock will continually grow louder and more menacing each decade. Where will it all end?" [...] However, some observers have suggested that by the 1990s Borlaug had changed his position on population control. They point to a quote from the year 2000 in which he stated: [...] "I <b>now</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> the world has the technology—either available or well advanced in the research pipeline—to feed on a sustainable basis a population of 10 billion people. The more pertinent question today is whether farmers and ranchers will be permitted to use this new technology? While the affluent nations can certainly afford to adopt ultra low-risk positions, and pay more for food produced by the so-called 'organic' methods, the one billion chronically undernourished people of the low income, food-deficit nations cannot." [...] However, Borlaug remained on the advisory board of Population Media Center, an organization working to stabilize world population, until his death.|$|E
