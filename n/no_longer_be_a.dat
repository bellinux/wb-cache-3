5|$|Bloomsbury {{invested}} £10million in {{an attempt}} to keep the book's contents secure until 21 July, the release date. Arthur Levine, U.S. editor of the Harry Potter series, denied distributing any copies of Deathly Hallows in advance for press review, but two U.S. papers published early reviews anyway. There was speculation that some shops would break the embargo and distribute copies of the book early, as the penalty imposed for previous instalments—that the distributor would not be supplied with any further copies of the series—would <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> deterrent.|$|E
5|$|During the menstrual {{period of}} the older queen, Ambika, Satyavati invited Vyasa to Ambika's bedchamber. However, during sex with Vyasa, Ambika noticed his dark {{appearance}} and closed her eyes. Vyasa declared to Satyavti that due to Ambika's cruelty, her son would be blind (but strong) and have a hundred sons – later known as Kauravas (descendants of Kuru). Satyavati considered such an heir to be an unworthy king, so she asked Vyasa to have niyoga with her other daughter-in-law. During their niyoga, Ambalika fell pale due to Vyasa's grim appearance. As the result the child would be wan, Vyasa told his mother, who begged for another child. In due course, the blind Dhritarashtra and the pale Pandu were born. Satyavati again invited Vyasa to Ambika's bedchamber; she remembered Vyasa's grim appearance (and repulsive odour), and substituted a Shudra (lowest caste) maid in her place. The maid respected the sage and was not afraid of him, and Vyasa thus blessed her; her son {{would be the most}} intelligent man, and she would <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> slave. Vyasa told Satyavti of the deception, and then disappeared; Vidura, an incarnation of the god Dharma, was born to the maid.|$|E

5|$|Oliphant envisaged Canberra one day {{becoming}} a university town like Oxford or Cambridge. A {{threat to the}} future of the University arose in the wake of the 1949 election, when the Liberal Party of Australia led by Robert Menzies won. Many Liberals were opposed to the University, which they saw as an extravagance. Menzies defended it, but in 1954 he announced that it had entered a period of consolidation, with a funding ceiling, ending the possibility of successful competition with universities in Europe and North America. A further blow came in 1959, when the Menzies government amalgamated it with the Canberra University College. Henceforth, it would <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> research university, but a regular one, with responsibility for teaching undergraduates. Nonetheless, parts of the university stayed committed to the old mission, and the ANU remained a university where research is central to its activities. Despite the setbacks, by 2014 the vision of Canberra as a university town would be well on its way to {{becoming a}} reality.|$|E

25|$|This conquest {{marked the}} maximum extent of Mataram's power. Having {{consolidated}} his power {{in central and}} eastern Java, Agung then turned westward to deal with the Dutch.

After this failure, Mataram expansion stopped, and it would <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> threat to either Banten or the Dutch.|$|E
25|$|In response, West Virginia filed {{a lawsuit}} to declare invalid the withdrawal-notice {{requirement}} stipulated in the Big East's bylaws.

Because of this, West Virginia alleged, its continued performance under the contract had become unreasonably burdensome and its original purpose in entering into the contract had been eliminated.|$|E

25|$|In some states, {{the high}} number of {{aggravating}} factors has been criticized on account of giving prosecutors too much discretion in choosing cases where they believe capital punishment is warranted. In California especially, an official commission proposed, in 2008, to reduce these factors to five (multiple murders, torture murder, murder of a police officer, murder committed in jail, and murder related to another felony). Columnist Charles Lane went further, and proposed that murder related to a felony other than rape should <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> capital crime when there is only one victim killed.|$|E

His behavior is consistent with a pattern of unprofessional, disrespectful behavior directed by Mr. Pelini toward the passionate fans of Nebraska, employees of the university and, most concerning, our student-athletes. This behavior is not tolerated at the University of Nebraska and, among many other concerns, played a role in his dismissal.|$|E
25|$|With Norway's {{entry into}} the North Atlantic Treaty Organization {{a large amount of}} funding was {{allocated}} to building new land airports. This and the technological development meant that seaplanes would <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> central part of the Air Force. Skattøra was during the 1950s the only NATO water air station. However, it would take over a decade before the other infrastructure and aircraft had reached such a standard that the air station could be closed. Withe replacement of the Catalinas with Grumman HU-16 Albatross, the northern detachment of the 333 Squadron relocated to Andøya Air Station. The military activity at Skattøra was therefore terminated in March 1959. However, Albatrosses would continue to use the civilian airport throughout the 1960s.|$|E
25|$|The great {{event of}} Elizabeth's later years was the Seven Years' War.

Elizabeth sided against Prussia over a personal dislike of Frederick the Great. She wanted him reduced within proper limits {{so that he might}} <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> danger to the empire. Elizabeth acceded to the treaty of Versailles thus entering into an alliance with France and Austria against Prussia. On 17 May 1757 the Russian army, 85,000 strong, advanced against Königsberg.|$|E
