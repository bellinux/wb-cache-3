5|$|Enamel's {{primary mineral}} is hydroxyapatite, {{which is a}} {{crystalline}} calcium phosphate. The large amount of minerals in enamel accounts <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>for</b> its strength but also for its brittleness. Dentin, which is less mineralized and less brittle, compensates for enamel and is necessary as a support. Unlike dentin and bone, enamel does not contain collagen. Proteins of note {{in the development of}} enamel are ameloblastins, amelogenins, enamelins and tuftelins. It is believed that they aid in the development of enamel by serving as framework support, among other functions.|$|E
