50|$|<b>Nuclear</b> <b>criticality</b> <b>safety</b> is a {{field of}} nuclear {{engineering}} dedicated to the prevention of nuclear and radiation accidents resulting from an inadvertent, self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction. Additionally, <b>nuclear</b> <b>criticality</b> <b>safety</b> is concerned with mitigating {{the consequences of a}} nuclear criticality accident. A nuclear criticality accident occurs from operations that involve fissile material and results in a sudden and potentially lethal release of radiation. <b>Nuclear</b> <b>criticality</b> <b>safety</b> practitioners attempt to prevent nuclear criticality accidents by analyzing normal and credible abnormal conditions in fissile material operations and designing safe arrangements for the processing of fissile materials. A common practice is to apply a double contingency analysis to the operation in which two or more independent, concurrent and unlikely changes in process conditions must occur before a nuclear criticality accident can occur. For example, the first change in conditions may be complete or partial flooding and the second change a re-arrangement of the fissile material. Controls (requirements) on process parameters (e.g., fissile material mass, equipment) result from this analysis. These controls, either passive (physical), active (mechanical), or administrative (human), are implemented by inherently safe or fault-tolerant plant designs, or, if such designs are not practicable, by administrative controls such as operating procedures, job instructions and other means to minimize the potential for significant process changes {{that could lead to a}} nuclear criticality accident.|$|E

40|$|A {{series of}} neutron {{transport}} experiments {{was performed in}} 1989 and 1990 at NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) using a spherical stainless steel container and fission chambers. These experiments were performed to help understand errors observed in criticality calculations for arrays of individually subcritical components, particularly solution arrays [1 - 3]. They were supported by the U. S. Department of Energy, Environment and Health, <b>Nuclear</b> <b>Criticality</b> Technology and <b>Safety</b> Project. The intent was to evaluate {{the possibility that the}} criticality prediction errors stem from errors in the calculation of neutron leakage from individual components of the array. Thus, the explicit product of the experiments was the measurement of the leakage flux, as characterized by various Cd-shielded and unshielded fission rates. Because the various fission rates have different neutron-energy sensitivities, collectively they give an indication of the energy dependence of the leakage flux. Leakage and moderation were varied systematically through the use of different diameter spheres, with and without water.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the approach used {{to resolve the}} <b>Nuclear</b> <b>Criticality</b> <b>Safety</b> Issue for the Hanford Site high-level waste tanks. Although operational controls {{have been in place}} at the Hanford Site throughout its operating life to minimize the amount of fissile material discarded as waste, estimates of the total amount of plutonium that entered the waste tanks range from 500 to 1, 000 kg. <b>Nuclear</b> <b>criticality</b> <b>safety</b> concerns were heightened in 1991 based on a review of waste analysis results and a subsequent U. S. Department of Energy 1399 review of the nuclear criticality program. Although the DOE review team concluded that there was no imminent risk of a criticality at the Hanford Site tank farms, the team also stated its concern regarding the lack of definitive knowledge of the fissile material inventory and distribution within the waste tanks and the lack of sufficient management support for the overall criticality safety program. An in-depth technical review of the <b>nuclear</b> <b>criticality</b> <b>safety</b> of the waste tanks was conducted to develop a defensible technical basis to ensure that waste tanks are subcritical. The review covered all relevant aspects of <b>nuclear</b> <b>criticality</b> <b>safety</b> including neutronics and chemical and physical phenomena of the waste form under aging waste conditions as well as during routine waste management operations.
