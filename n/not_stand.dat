5|$|Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) reluctantly {{responds}} to Fox Mulder's (David Duchovny) call on Christmas Eve {{to investigate a}} haunted house in Maryland. He explains that during Christmas of 1917, a young couple {{living in the house}} agreed to a lovers' pact, one killing the other and the remaining one committing suicide. He explains that they could <b>not</b> <b>stand</b> the thought of being alone after the other died and during the afterlife; they wanted to spend all eternity together. Now, Mulder claims, they haunt the house every Christmas Eve.|$|E
5|$|Dixon {{represented}} Henderson County at the Kentucky constitutional {{convention of}} 1849. In this capacity, he ensured that strong protections of slave property {{were included in}} the Kentucky Constitution of 1850. Later, the General Assembly chose Dixon to fill the unexpired Senate term of Henry Clay. He served from September 1, 1852, to March 3, 1855, and did <b>not</b> <b>stand</b> for re-election. During his short tenure, Dixon's major accomplishment was convincing Stephen Douglas to include language in the Kansas-Nebraska Act that explicitly repealed the Missouri Compromise's prohibition on slavery north of latitude 36°30'.|$|E

5|$|If the {{selectors}} are right, Egar is wrong, {{and if he}} {{is incapable}} of interpreting the laws correctly, he should <b>not</b> <b>stand</b> in first-class cricket. On the other hand if the selectors as a body threw Meckiff into this arena merely to be tested by the opinion of a single umpire, they are very much guilty of passing the buck, and of exposing both the bowler and the umpire to extreme embarrassment.|$|E
5|$|In 1863, Knott {{returned}} to Kentucky and re-opened his legal practice in Lebanon. He was elected as a Democrat to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1867. As a legislator, he opposed the Reconstruction {{agenda of the}} Radical Republicans and ratification of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth amendments. He was re-elected to a second term, but did <b>not</b> <b>stand</b> for re-election in 1870.|$|E
5|$|On 7January 1830 Etty's mentor Thomas Lawrence died, {{followed}} on 30July by Etty's mother. Etty {{was devastated}} by the loss, {{and was one of}} those considered to replace Lawrence as President of the Royal Academy, although in the event he did <b>not</b> <b>stand</b> for election. Possibly distracted by the death of Lawrence, Etty only submitted three paintings to the Summer Exhibition that year. One of these, Judith Going Forth, was an addition to Judith, which had been commissioned the previous year by that painting's new owners, the Royal Scottish Academy.|$|E

5|$|The {{lesser kudu}} browses {{primarily}} at dusk or at dawn, and {{is associated with}} the gerenuk and the impala. The lesser kudu and the gerenuk might compete for evergreen species in the dry season. However, unlike the gerenuk, the lesser kudu rarely prefers Acacia species and does <b>not</b> <b>stand</b> on its hindlegs while feeding. The lesser kudu does not have a great requirement for water, and can browse in arid environments. It eats succulent plants, such as the wild sisal, Sansevieria, and Euphorbia species in the dry season, and drinks water when sources are available.|$|E
5|$|The strict {{requirements}} {{have been}} justified {{on the basis}} that the President should be a person of integrity and moral standing, with the ability to monitor the financial affairs {{of the state and the}} management of the public service sector. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has argued that this stringent screening process is necessary as the President does <b>not</b> <b>stand</b> as a political party nominee. He is thus not subjected to the internal screening mechanism of the ruling People's Action Party (PAP).|$|E

You on your part must drive away from you the evil-disposed people who have done so much harm, and discountenance in the plainest way everything tending to violence.|$|E
5|$|By {{the spring}} of 1971, Thorpe's {{political}} career had stalled. He had led the party to a disastrous performance in the United Kingdom general election of June 1970; in an unexpected victory for the Conservatives under Edward Heath, the Liberals lost seven of their thirteen parliamentary seats, and Thorpe's majority in North Devon fell to below 400. Bessell, with mounting business worries, did <b>not</b> <b>stand</b> for re-election in Bodmin. Thorpe faced censure for his conduct of a campaign during which he had spent extravagantly and left the party {{on the verge of}} bankruptcy; but the matter was put aside in a wave of sympathy when his wife Caroline was killed in a road accident 10 days after the election. Thorpe was devastated; he continued as leader, but for the next year performed little beyond routine party duties.|$|E
5|$|In 1934, {{when the}} Crown {{prosecutor}} for Prince Albert resigned {{to become the}} Conservative Party's legislative candidate, Diefenbaker took his place as prosecutor. Diefenbaker did <b>not</b> <b>stand</b> in the 1934 provincial election, in which the governing Conservatives lost every seat. Six days after the election, Diefenbaker resigned as Crown prosecutor. The federal government of Bennett was defeated the following year and Mackenzie King returned as Prime Minister. Judging his prospects hopeless, Diefenbaker had declined a nomination to stand again against Mackenzie King in Prince Albert. In {{the waning days of}} the Bennett government, the Saskatchewan Conservative Party President was appointed a judge, leaving Diefenbaker, who had been elected the party's vice president, as acting president of the provincial party.|$|E

5|$|In Massachusetts, the {{lieutenant}} governor does not preside over the state Senate, {{as is the case}} in many other states; nevertheless, as lieutenant governor, Coolidge was a deputy governor functioning as administrative inspector and was a member of the governor's council. He was also chairman of the finance committee and the pardons committee. As a full-time elected official, Coolidge discontinued his law practice in 1916, though his family continued to live in Northampton. McCall and Coolidge were both reelected in 1916 and again in 1917. When McCall decided that he would <b>not</b> <b>stand</b> for a fourth term, Coolidge announced his intention to run for governor.|$|E
5|$|Knott was disbarred {{and briefly}} imprisoned for {{his refusal to}} take the oath of allegiance. He {{returned}} to Kentucky in 1863 and {{was elected to the}} U.S. House of Representatives. In 1871, he made a notable speech ridiculing a bill to subsidize westward expansion of railroads. In the speech, he lampooned the remote town of Duluth, Minnesota. The Duluth speech was eventually reprinted in several publications and brought Knott national acclaim. He did <b>not</b> <b>stand</b> for re-election in 1870, instead making a failed run for the office of governor. In 1875, he returned to the House and served as chair of the judiciary committee.|$|E
5|$|On 29 May 2000, Suharto {{was placed}} {{under house arrest}} when Indonesian {{authorities}} began to investigate the corruption during his presidency. In July 2000, {{it was announced that}} he was to be accused of embezzling US$571 million of government donations to {{one of a number of}} foundations under his control and then using the money to finance family investments. But in September court-appointed doctors announced that he could <b>not</b> <b>stand</b> trial because of his declining health. State prosecutors tried again in 2002 but then doctors cited an unspecified brain disease. On 26 March 2008, a civil court judge acquitted Suharto of corruption but ordered his charitable foundation, Supersemar, to pay US$110m (£55m).|$|E
