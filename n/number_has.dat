5|$|Any nonrational {{power of}} a complex <b>number</b> <b>has</b> an {{infinite}} number of possible values because of the multi-valued nature of the complex logarithm. The principal value is a single value chosen from these by a rule which, amongst its other properties, ensures powers of complex numbers with a positive real part and zero imaginary part give the same value as does the rule defined above for the corresponding real base.|$|E

5|$|Both sexes {{build the}} nest; the {{building}} periods {{can be as}} brief as three days to as long as four weeks. Egg count differs by location; the <b>number</b> <b>has</b> been as low as two and as high as five. Egg color varies; they can appear bluish green to pale yellowish blue, spotted abundantly in reddish brown. Both sexes incubate but the female is mainly responsible {{as well as being}} the sole provider of brooding. Curve-billed parents defend their nests fervently against other species; snakes are the most frequent predators of eggs and nestlings. Curved-billed Thrashers are rarely victims of nest parasitism by cowbirds. In situations where food is scarce, parents feed older fledglings first. The fledging period ranges from 11 to 18 days.|$|E

5|$|Countless {{results in}} number theory invoke the {{fundamental}} theorem of arithmetic and the algebraic properties of even numbers, so the above choices have far-reaching consequences. For example, {{the fact that}} positive numbers have unique factorizations means that one can determine whether a <b>number</b> <b>has</b> an even or odd number of distinct prime factors. Since 1 is not prime, nor does it have prime factors, it {{is a product of}} 0 distinct primes; since 0 is an even number, 1 has an even number of distinct prime factors. This implies that the Möbius function takes the value , which is necessary for it to be a multiplicative function and for the Möbius inversion formula to work.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{stabilization}} of its outer 8s electron, ununennium's first ionization energy—the energy required to remove an electron from a neutral atom—is predicted to be 4.53eV, {{higher than those}} of the known alkali metals from potassium onward. This effect is so large that unbiunium (element 121) is predicted to have a lower ionization energy of 4.45eV, so that the alkali metal in period 8 would not have the lowest ionization energy in the period, as is true for all previous periods. Ununennium's electron affinity is expected to be far greater than that of caesium and francium; indeed, ununennium is expected to have an electron affinity higher than all the alkali metals lighter than it. Relativistic effects also cause a very large drop in the polarizability of ununennium, to 169.7a.u. Indeed, the static dipole polarisability (αD) of ununennium, a quantity for which the impacts of relativity are proportional to the square of the element's atomic <b>number,</b> <b>has</b> been calculated to be small and similar to that of sodium.|$|E
5|$|During Barry's career, he was {{credited}} with saving the lives of more than forty people, although this <b>number</b> <b>has</b> sometimes varied over the years. Barry's most famous rescue {{was that of a}} young boy. He found the child asleep in a cavern of ice. After warming up the boy's body sufficiently by licking him, he moved the boy about and onto his back and carried the child back to the hospice. The child survived and was returned to his parents, although other sources say that the boy's mother died in the avalanche that trapped the boy. The Museum of Natural History in Bern disputes the legend, attributing it to Peter Scheitlin, an animal psychologist.|$|E

5|$|Growers {{register}} new daffodil cultivars by {{name and}} color with the Royal Horticultural Society, which is the international registration authority for the genus. Their International Daffodil Register is regularly updated with supplements available online and is searchable. The most recent supplement (2014) is the sixth (the fifth was published in 2012). More than 27,000 names were registered as of 2008, and the <b>number</b> <b>has</b> continued to grow. Registered daffodils are given a division number and colour code such as 5 W-W ("Thalia"). In horticultural usage {{it is common to}} also find an unofficial Division 14: Miniatures, which although drawn from the other 13 divisions, have their miniature size in common. Over 140 varieties have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit (See List of Award of Garden Merit narcissus).|$|E
5|$|Some {{approaches}} explicitly define real {{numbers to}} be certain structures built upon the rational numbers, using axiomatic set theory. The natural numbers – 0, 1, 2, 3, and so on – begin with 0 and continue upwards, so that every <b>number</b> <b>has</b> a successor. One can extend the natural numbers with their negatives to give all the integers, and to further extend to ratios, giving the rational numbers. These number systems are accompanied by the arithmetic of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. More subtly, they include ordering, so that one number {{can be compared to}} another and found to be less than, greater than, or equal to another number.|$|E

40|$|A {{trapezoidal}} number, a sum of {{at least}} two consecutive positive integers, is a figurate number that can be represented by points rearranged in the plane as a trapezoid. Such <b>numbers</b> <b>have</b> been of interest and extensively studied. In this paper, a generalization of trapezoidal <b>numbers</b> <b>has</b> been introduced. For each positive integer m, a positive integer N is called an m-trapezoidal number if N can be written as an arithmetic series {{of at least}} 2 terms with common difference m. Properties of m-trapezoidal <b>numbers</b> <b>have</b> been studied together with their trapezoidal representations. In the special case where m= 2, the characterization and enumeration of such <b>numbers</b> <b>have</b> been given as well as illustrative examples. Precisely, for a fixed 2 -trapezoidal number N, the ways and the number of ways to write N as an arithmetic series with common difference 2 have been determined.

5|$|Most lions {{now live}} in eastern and {{southern}} Africa, and their numbers there are rapidly decreasing, with an estimated 30–50% decline per 20 years in the late {{half of the twentieth}} century. Estimates of the African lion population range between 16,500 and 47,000 living in the wild in 2002–2004, down from early 1990s estimates that ranged as high as 100,000 and perhaps 400,000 in 1950. Primary causes of the decline include disease and human interference. Habitat loss and conflicts with humans are considered the most significant threats to the species. The remaining populations are often geographically isolated from one another, which can lead to inbreeding, and consequently, reduced genetic diversity. The lion population in the region of West Africa is isolated from those of Central Africa, with little or no exchange of breeding individuals. The number of mature individuals in West Africa is estimated by two separate recent surveys at 850–1,160 (2002/2004). There is disagreement over the size of the largest individual population in West Africa: the estimates range from 100 to 400 lions in Burkina Faso's Arly-Singou ecosystem. Another population in northwestern Africa is found in Waza National Park, where approximately 14–21 animals persist. Therefore, the lion is considered a vulnerable species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, while the Asiatic subspecies is endangered. However, in contrast to the African lion, the Asiatic lion's <b>number</b> <b>has</b> risen over the years.|$|E
