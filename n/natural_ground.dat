25|$|The pool {{has come}} under {{criticism}} from environmentalists due to the massive amounts of fresh water it uses daily, raising concerns {{that the process of}} completely draining the pool every night and refilling it the following day was depleting the Floridian aquifers. In 1998 a solution was devised to drain the water back into the aquifer, using <b>natural</b> <b>ground</b> filtration, thus recycling the precious natural resource, while allowing the pool to maintain its fresh, clear water.|$|E

Spinners find an old pitch, one that hasn't been frequently used, more suitable to their deliveries rather than a fresh pitch, one that hasn't come under use as much such as a pitch at the start of the match.|$|E

500|$|The {{open spaces}} of the precinct are {{significant}} as they provide impressive settings for the structures. They are also important spaces {{in their own right}} retaining the stark open character of a penal institution required for surveillance. The extensive forecourt of the main cell block, with its scale and secure location within the perimeter walls, is particularly impressive. Paths are bitumen with grassed garden beds delineated by raised brick edging. South Knoll comprises the remains of the high, <b>natural</b> <b>ground</b> level which at least by 1896 had been terraced to form flat, grassed areas. The former playing fields and tennis courts are still in evidence. There is a brick- vaulted reservoir located under the Knoll. The significant landscape presents an austere and formal quality within the perimeter walls. [...] Generally the landscape is sparse and simple, comprising unobtrusive elements such as lawn, low plantings and pavement. [...] Landscape elements outside the walls include the exotic almond and pine trees on the Terrace.|$|E
500|$|The Leopold Report was {{the first}} {{concrete}} plan for managing park visitors and ecosystems under unified principles. With an infusion of scientists and resource programs, it set into motion a series of ecologically positive legislative actions in the 1960s and into the 1970s. While direct management of the elk population in Yellowstone National Park continues to spark debate amongst scientists, the report nonetheless successfully influenced multiple areas of park management. Prior to the report's publication, California's Sequoia National Park was beset by a thick underbrush, which the report directly {{referred to as a}} [...] "dog-hair thicket... a direct function of overprotection from <b>natural</b> <b>ground</b> fires". This underbrush would have been naturally eradicated by lightning storms, but because of policies that supported wildfire suppression, the growth threatened the park's Giant Sequoia trees. As {{a direct result of the}} report's advice regarding the usefulness of controlled burning, in 1964 the park began performing trial controlled burns, which led to a 1968 policy championing the continuation of burns for the betterment of the park's forest ecosystems. Fire ecologist Bruce Kilgore credited the Leopold Report as being a true catalyst for change, stating that it was the [...] "document of greatest significance to National Park Service [...] policy".|$|E

2500|$|In {{addition}} to the residential areas, Teopantecuanitlan is notable for its monumental architecture, art, and agricultural terraces, in particular {{one of the first}} civil-ceremonial structures in all of Mesoamerica, El Recinto ("the enclosure"), also known as the Sunken Patio, constructed during Phase II (between 1000 and 800 BCE). [...] The Sunken Patio is so-named because it is 2 meters (7ft) below the <b>natural</b> <b>ground</b> level, built on a base of yellow clay, dressed with travertine blocks.|$|E
2500|$|Construction {{began on}} April 16, 1930 and {{immediately}} faced serious engineering and geotechnical obstacles related to <b>natural</b> <b>ground</b> water and drainage. [...] The stadium {{was built in}} a shallow ravine, with the lower thirty-two rows of the east, west, and north stands {{below the level of}} the surrounding land. When excavation reached the water table, water began to pour into the construction site from the north end, miring men, mules, and mule-drawn equipment in the resulting mud. [...] The drainage challenge was ultimately resolved by the installation of massive underground culverts leading to Graham Pond, two blocks south of the stadium site. [...] Problems solved, the construction team of eighty laborers and mules completed Florida Field in time for the November 8, 1930 homecoming game against Alabama, the dominant Southern Conference team of the day. Florida Field was rededicated in 1934 to the memory of Florida servicemen who died in World War I, and a plaque was placed on the outside wall behind the old north end zone as a memorial.|$|E

60|$|Now the {{principle}} of gradation throughout organic Nature may, of course, be interpreted upon other assumptions than those of Darwins hypothesis--certainly upon quite other than those of a materialistic philosophy, with which we ourselves have no sympathy. Still we conceive it not only possible, but probable, that this gradation, as it has its <b>natural</b> <b>ground,</b> may yet have its scientific explanation.

60|$|The same benign {{necessity}} {{and the same}} practical abuse appear in the parties, into which each State divides itself, of opponents and defenders of {{the administration of the}} government. Parties are also founded on instincts, and have better guides to their own humble aims than the sagacity of their leaders. They have nothing perverse in their origin, but rudely mark some real and lasting relation. We might as wisely reprove the east wind or the frost, as a political party, whose members, for the most part, could give no account of their position, but stand for the defence of those interests in which they find themselves. Our quarrel with them begins when they quit this deep <b>natural</b> <b>ground</b> at the bidding of some leader, and obeying personal considerations, throw themselves into the maintenance and defence of points nowise belonging to their system. A party is perpetually corrupted by personality. Whilst we absolve the association from dishonesty, we cannot extend the same charity to their leaders. They reap the rewards of the docility and zeal of the masses which they direct. Ordinarily our parties are parties of circumstance, and not of principle; as the planting interest in conflict with the commercial; the party of capitalists and that of operatives; parties which are identical in their moral character, and which can easily change ground with each other in the support of many of their measures. Parties of principle, as, religious sects, or the party of free-trade, of universal suffrage, of abolition of slavery, of abolition of capital punishment,--degenerate into personalities, or would inspire enthusiasm. The vice of our leading parties in this country (which may be cited as a fair specimen of these societies of opinion) is that they do not plant themselves on the deep and necessary grounds to which they are respectively entitled, but lash themselves to fury in the carrying of some local and momentary measure, nowise useful to the commonwealth. Of the two great parties which at this hour almost share the nation between them, I should say that one has the best cause, and the other contains the best men. The philosopher, the poet, or the religious man will of course wish to cast his vote with the democrat, for free-trade, for wide suffrage, for the abolition of legal cruelties in the penal code, and for facilitating in every manner the access of the young and the poor to the sources of wealth and power. But he can rarely accept the persons whom the so-called popular party propose to him as representatives of these liberalities. They have not at heart the ends which give to the name of democracy what hope and virtue are in it. The spirit of our American radicalism is destructive and aimless: it is not loving; it has no ulterior and divine ends, but is destructive only out of hatred and selfishness. On the other side, the conservative party, composed of the most moderate, able, and cultivated part of the population, is timid, and merely defensive of property. It vindicates no right, it aspires to no real good, it brands no crime, it proposes no generous policy; it does not build, nor write, nor cherish the arts, nor foster religion, nor establish schools, nor encourage science, nor emancipate the slave, nor befriend the poor, or the Indian, or the immigrant. From neither party, when in power, has the world any benefit to expect in science, art, or humanity, at all commensurate with the resources of the nation.|$|E
