40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{studies were}} {{conducted}} during 2008 – 2010 to evaluate length-weight relationship and condition factor of Aorichthys aor in lower reaches of River Brahmaputra. 750 <b>nos</b> <b>of</b> <b>fishes</b> having weight <b>of</b> 20 g to 1250 g and total length of 10 cm to 55 cm were recorded. The Cube law or Length–weight relationship was calculated as W = 0. 00352 L 3. 246. The {{coefficient of correlation}} (r) between observed length & weight and calculated length & weight was 0. 96 and 0. 93 respectively, which indicated highly significant relationship between length and weight.

50|$|What {{has been}} lacking {{has been the}} paleontological {{evidence}} that early humans consumed fish in significant amounts earlier than tens {{to hundreds of thousands}} of years ago. Part of the problem has been the avoidance of taphonomic bias by researchers: most hominin fossils occur in marginal lacustrine environments and the presence <b>of</b> <b>fish</b> remains is therefore <b>no</b> proof <b>of</b> <b>fish</b> consumption. Fish bones often decompose so that special tests are required to detect them. The archaeological record <b>of</b> human <b>fishing</b> and coastal settlement is fundamentally flawed due to postglacial sea level rise.|$|R

40|$|Tag—recapture {{data for}} {{kingfish}} {{obtained from a}} cooperative tagging programme {{were used to assess}} the usefulness of such information for estimating movement and life-history parameters. Numbers tagged and recaptured varied among fishing zones, seasons and years. Recapture rates varied among areas, fishers and sizes <b>of</b> <b>fish.</b> Small fish showed less movement than large fish, but few fish > 1000 mm TL were tagged. The majority <b>of</b> <b>fish</b> were recaptured within 50 km of where they were tagged, although there was an indication that fish that were at large longer moved further. The maximum distance moved was 3000 km and the maximum time at liberty was 1742 days.
