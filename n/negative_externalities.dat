Wind projects provide local taxes, or payments in lieu of taxes and strengthen the economy of rural communities by providing income to farmers with wind turbines on their land. Wind energy in many jurisdictions receives financial or other support to encourage its development. Wind energy benefits from subsidies in many jurisdictions, either to increase its attractiveness, or to compensate for subsidies received by other forms of production which have significant <b>negative</b> <b>externalities.</b>|$|E
5|$|Congestion pricing is {{a concept}} from market {{economics}} {{regarding the use of}} pricing mechanisms to charge the users of public goods for the <b>negative</b> <b>externalities</b> generated by the peak demand in excess of available supply. Its economic rationale is that, at a price of zero, demand exceeds supply, causing a shortage, and that the shortage should be corrected by charging the equilibrium price rather than shifting it down by increasing the supply. Usually this means increasing prices during certain periods of time or at the places where congestion occurs; or introducing a new usage tax or charge when peak demand exceeds available supply {{in the case of a}} tax-funded public good provided free at the point of usage.|$|E
5|$|Congestion pricing or {{congestion}} charges is {{a system}} of surcharging users of public goods that are subject to congestion through excess demand such as higher peak charges for use of bus services, electricity, metros, railways, telephones, and road pricing to reduce traffic congestion; airlines and shipping companies may be charged higher fees for slots at airports and through canals at busy times. This pricing strategy regulates demand, {{making it possible to}} manage congestion without increasing supply. Market economics theory, which encompasses the congestion pricing concept, postulates that users will be forced to pay for the <b>negative</b> <b>externalities</b> they create, making them conscious of the costs they impose upon each other when consuming during the peak demand, and more aware of their impact on the environment.|$|E
40|$|Although human {{resource}} management (HRM) literature has provided abundant insight into strategies used to improve employee effectiveness for company performance, relatively limited research exists on the harm or <b>negative</b> <b>externality</b> that those HRM practices can have on employees and the community. This article explores the <b>negative</b> <b>externality</b> of HRM practices that is imposed by organizations on employees, their families and communities. A conceptual model of <b>negative</b> <b>externality</b> for Sustainable HRM is proposed to {{provide a framework for}} HRM practitioners and researchers to understand the resulting harm of some HRM practices on employees, their families and communities. To highlight the practical implications of the model, downsizing, a widely used business turnaround strategy to improve business efficiency, is analyzed for its <b>negative</b> <b>externality.</b> Subsequently, the role of Sustainable HRM practices which can minimize such harm is examined. Practical and empirical implications of the <b>negative</b> <b>externality</b> of HRM practices are explored...|$|R

50|$|The sugary drinks tax {{is a way}} {{to correct}} the <b>negative</b> <b>externality</b> by {{regulating}} the consumption of sugary drinks. Without a sugar tax, taxpayer money is used to pay for higher health care costs incurred from high consumption of sugar. Although this solution corrects the <b>negative</b> consumption <b>externality,</b> taxpayers that consume sugary drinks moderately and hence do not contribute to higher health care costs, still need to pay for this <b>negative</b> <b>externality.</b> This could be seen as not fair and hence creates an argument for different solutions. Hence a sugary drinks tax may be a more appropriate solution as tax revenue that is collected from the sugar tax can be used to create childhood nutrition programs or obesity-prevention programs. This is a solution that could also correct the <b>negative</b> <b>externality</b> of sugar consumption as well as {{is a way to}} make the parties that cause the <b>negative</b> <b>externality</b> pay their fair share.|$|R

25|$|A tax {{effectively}} changes relative {{prices of}} products. Therefore, most economists, especially neoclassical economists, argue that taxation creates market distortion {{and results in}} economic inefficiency unless there are (positive or <b>negative)</b> <b>externalities</b> associated with the activities that are taxed {{that need to be}} internalized to reach an efficient market outcome. They have therefore sought to identify the kind of tax system that would minimize this distortion.|$|E
25|$|Much of the time, {{private and}} social costs do not diverge from one another, {{but at times}} social costs may be either greater or less than private costs. When {{marginal}} social costs of production are {{greater than that of}} the private cost function, we see the occurrence of a negative externality of production. Productive processes that result in pollution are a textbook example of production that creates <b>negative</b> <b>externalities.</b>|$|E
5000|$|There is an {{important}} conceptual distinction between a demerit good and a <b>negative</b> <b>externality.</b> A <b>negative</b> <b>externality</b> occurs when the consumption of a good has measurable negative consequences on others who do not consume the good themselves. [...] Pollution (due, for example, to automobile use) is the canonical example of a <b>negative</b> <b>externality.</b> Another example is cigarettes. It not only affects a deliberate or addicted smoker through damage to health, but also indirect smokers exposed to the smoke (second hand smoking). By contrast, a demerit good is viewed as undesirable because its consumption has negative effects upon the consumer.|$|R
50|$|This is {{a measure}} of fairness: no agent should suffer too much from the <b>negative</b> <b>externality.</b> In the above example, the agent with demand 3 can claim that, if all other agents were as modest as he is, {{there would have been no}} <b>negative</b> <b>externality</b> and each agent would have paid only $1 per unit, so he should not have to pay more than this.|$|R
50|$|A {{carbon tax}} {{is also an}} {{indirect}} tax—a tax on a transaction—as opposed to a direct tax, which taxes income. A carbon tax is called a price instrument, since it sets a price for carbon dioxide emissions. In economic theory, pollution is considered a <b>negative</b> <b>externality,</b> a <b>negative</b> effect on a party not directly involved in a transaction, which results in a market failure. To confront parties with the issue, the economist Arthur Pigou proposed taxing the goods (in this case hydrocarbon fuels), which were {{the source of the}} <b>negative</b> <b>externality</b> (carbon dioxide) so as to accurately reflect the cost of the goods' production to society, thereby internalizing the costs associated with the goods' production. A tax on a <b>negative</b> <b>externality</b> is called a Pigovian tax, and should equal the marginal damage costs.|$|R
25|$|Markets where price {{negotiations}} meet equilibrium, but {{the equilibrium}} is not efficient {{are said to}} experience market failure. Market failures are often associated with time-inconsistent preferences, information asymmetries, non-perfectly competitive markets, principal–agent problems, externalities, or public goods. Among the major <b>negative</b> <b>externalities</b> which can occur as {{a side effect of}} production and market exchange, are air pollution (side-effect of manufacturing and logistics) and environmental degradation (side-effect of farming and urbanization).|$|E
25|$|Externalities occur {{where there}} are {{significant}} social costs or benefits from production or consumption that are not reflected in market prices. For example, air pollution may generate a negative externality, and education may generate a positive externality (less crime, etc.). Governments often tax and otherwise restrict the sale of goods that have <b>negative</b> <b>externalities</b> and subsidize or otherwise promote the purchase of goods that have positive externalities {{in an effort to}} correct the price distortions caused by these externalities. Elementary demand-and-supply theory predicts equilibrium but not the speed of adjustment for changes of equilibrium due to a shift in demand or supply.|$|E
25|$|In {{regards to}} San Francisco, some {{interesting}} <b>negative</b> <b>externalities</b> are being experienced {{due to the}} dredging of land by the Bay. The Millennium Tower's, which were completed in 2008, are currently sinking. This has an extremely {{negative impact on the}} residents of this building, who have spent millions of dollars to live in this building. In response to this engineering travesty, San Francisco's city attorney has decided to file a lawsuit against the developer because the developer failed to inform the residents of the accelerated speed that the building was sinking at. If this lawsuit results in success for San Francisco this could lead to policy changes being made in the future surrounding transparency between developers and potential buyers of the developed land.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} the privatization policy {{of an industry}} where the production process generates emissions. We show that {{the high degree of}} <b>negative</b> <b>externality</b> leads to production substitution from the public firm to private firms. Moreover, we show that, if the degree of <b>negative</b> <b>externality</b> is sufficiently high, then a mixed oligopoly is preferable to a pure oligopoly for social welfare, even if the number of firms in the market is large.

Also, increase in population density decreases price differential between the cost leader and the cost disadvantaged firm. <b>Negative</b> Consumption <b>Externalities,</b> Cost Leadership, Conspicuous Goods, Pricing, Hotelling Models...|$|R
40|$|Externality {{refers to}} the {{economic}} cost or benefit that is not reflected in price. Actions with positive externality are usually in shortage, while those with <b>negative</b> <b>externality</b> are often excessive. With {{the aid of the}} externality theory, we can deepen our understanding of the problem of excessive paperwork and meetings and can find out some possible solutions. The author of this paper thinks that hidden <b>negative</b> <b>externality</b> exists in excessive paperwork and meetings, and that bargaining and restriction by social criteria and moral rules might be feasible solutions for this problem...|$|R
25|$|In {{the absence}} of <b>negative</b> <b>externalities,</b> the {{introduction}} of taxes into a market reduces economic efficiency by causing deadweight loss. In a competitive market {{the price of a}} particular economic good adjusts to ensure that all trades which benefit both the buyer and the seller of a good occur. The introduction of a tax causes the price received by the seller to be less than the cost to the buyer by the amount of the tax. This causes fewer transactions to occur, which reduces economic welfare; the individuals or businesses involved are less well off than before the tax. The tax burden and the amount of deadweight cost is dependent on the elasticity of supply and demand for the good taxed.|$|E
25|$|Privatization {{works when}} the person who owns the {{property}} (or rights of access to that property) pays the full price of its exploitation. As discussed above <b>negative</b> <b>externalities</b> (negative results, such as air or water pollution, that do not proportionately affect the user of the resource) is often a feature driving {{the tragedy of the}} commons. Internalizing the externalities, in other words ensuring that the users of resource pay for all of the consequences of its use, can provide an alternate solution between privatization and regulation. One example is gasoline taxes which are intended to include both the cost of road maintenance and of air pollution. This solution can provide the flexibility of privatization while minimizing the amount of government oversight and overhead that is needed.|$|E
25|$|Critics {{argue that}} even the US is still {{struggling}} to attain the income level necessary to prioritize certain environmental pollutants such as carbon emissions, which have yet to follow the EKC. With other pollutants however, like sulfur dioxide, production seems to coincide with a country's economic development and at a certain threshold level of income a mitigation of environmental damage occurs. This could be related rather than causal, because economic growth without institutional reform does not accomplish this environmental improvement. It appears that with GDP growth, government policies are strengthened and populations experience a rise in their demand for improved environmental quality. It may be the case, however, that regulation in relatively wealthy countries simply shifts the production and pollution to less-regulated, poorer countries; if this were true, the total size of the <b>negative</b> <b>externalities</b> of production remains the same or is larger, though in the wealthier country an EKC {{appears to have been}} obtained.|$|E

In particular, we consider the hypotheses that those two inputs are or are not technologically perfect substitutes of each other.

40|$|I study a noncooperative {{multilateral}} bargaining game {{of coalition}} formation, based on underlying TU games in partition form, in which coalitions {{are allowed to}} renegotiate agreements. Special attention {{is devoted to the}} strategic considerations induced by the possibility of renegotiation and its consequences for the efficiency of bargaining. I deÞne a class of games, relative positive and relative <b>negative</b> <b>externality</b> games, closely related to the standard notions of positive and <b>negative</b> <b>externality</b> games. In relative <b>negative</b> <b>externality</b> games, I Þnd that renegotiation promotes the strategic formation of subcoalitions. On the contrary, in relative positive externality games, renegotiation promotes efficiency by motivating players to form the grand coalition immediately. Thus, the possibility of renegotiation has very different strategic effects in the bargaining game depending on characteristics of the underlying game. Finally, the consequences of renegotiation is determined in several models of coalition formation previously analyzed in the literature.

25|$|Coordination {{games are}} {{closely linked to}} the {{economic}} concept of externalities, and in particular positive network externalities, the benefit reaped from being in the same network as other agents. Conversely, game theorists have modeled behavior under <b>negative</b> <b>externalities</b> where choosing the same action creates a cost rather than a benefit. The generic term for this class of game is anti-coordination game. The best-known example of a 2-player anti-coordination game is the game of Chicken (also known as Hawk-Dove game). Using the payoff matrix in Figure 1, a game is an anti-coordination game if Bnbsp&>nbsp&A and Cnbsp&>nbsp&D for row-player 1 (with lowercase analogues b > d and c > a for column-player 2). {Down, Left} and {Up, Right} are the two pure Nash equilibria. Chicken also requires that Anbsp&>nbsp&C, so a change from {Up, Left} to {Up, Right} improves player 2's payoff but reduces player 1's payoff, introducing conflict. This counters the standard coordination game setup, where all unilateral changes in a strategy lead to either mutual gain or mutual loss.|$|E

40|$|This article {{investigates the}} design of {{property}} taxation {{both before and after}} development in a real options framework where a fixed number of landowners irreversibly develop property in an uncertain environment. We assume that densely developed properties reduce open space, and thereby harm urban residents. However, landowners will ignore this <b>negative</b> <b>externality,</b> and will thus develop properties more densely than is socially optimal. The regulator can correct this tendency by imposing taxation on property both before and after development.
