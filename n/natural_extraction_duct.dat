40|$|The {{indoor air}} quality in the {{passenger}} compartment of an intercity bus is studied. A system used for the remotion of the contaminants from the compartment, based on an <b>extraction</b> <b>duct,</b> was projected using a simple, unidimensional flow model with capability to predict the air exchange rate {{as a function of}} the vehicle velocity. Some tests using tracer gas methods were performed in a real vehicle with the contaminant remotion system mounted, in order to validate the calculation model and evaluate the performances of the system. A good agreement between the predicted and the experimental results was verified and the obtained air exchange rate was quite reasonable when compared with the former situation, without <b>extraction</b> <b>duct...</b>|$|R

There is great interest in identifying the macro policies that would reduce regional income disparity and better control the rate of <b>natural</b> <b>extraction,</b> while maintaining reasonable national economic growth.

40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} explore the {{feasibility}} of the <b>natural</b> smoke <b>extraction</b> of the undivided large space warehouse buildings, the paper analyzes the characteristics, factors and feasibility of <b>natural</b> smoke <b>extraction</b> of the undivided large space warehouse buildings which have been fire damaged, {{based on the idea}} of performance-based fire protection design. FDS software is used for fire hazard analysis of the building by simulating the fire scene temperature, smoke layer height and visibility during the <b>natural</b> smoke <b>extraction.</b> It draws the conclusion that: during <b>natural</b> smoke <b>extraction,</b> increased area of the smoke vent and heightened warehouse both, under certain conditions, can lower the fire scene temperature, slow the sinking of smoke and weaken the ground radiation so that the fire scene safety can be guaranteed even in the most unfavorable condition. However, to ensure stable smoke extraction and eliminate the influence from the external environments, some proven fire safety measures can be provided in certain positions...|$|R

This study discusses the feasibility of using the Venturi principle to improve a <b>natural</b> smoke <b>extraction</b> system for buildings under the effect of wind. The findings show that side smoke extraction is likely to be influenced by external air flow.
