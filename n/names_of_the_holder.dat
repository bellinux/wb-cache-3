50|$|The Turkish {{national}} ID card (Nüfus Cüzdanı) is compulsory for all Turkish {{citizens from}} birth. Cards {{for males and}} females have a different colour.

On February 2, 2010 <b>the</b> European Court <b>of</b> Human Rights ruled in a 6 to 1 vote that the religious affiliation section <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Turkish identity card violated articles 6, 9, and 12 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> European Convention <b>of</b> Human Rights, to which Turkey is a signatory. The ruling should coerce the Turkish government to completely omit religious affiliation on future identity cards. The Turkish police are allowed to ask any person to show ID, and refusing to comply may lead to arrest. It can be used for international travel to Northern Cyprus instead of a passport.|$|R
30|$|Further, product {{registration}} to {{a trusted}} authority is a well-established way of protecting {{intellectual property rights}} as well as offering indisputable proof of original ownership and legal rights [15]. In order to prevent any intentional distortion, digital timestamping is incorporated in a proposed scheme. Referring to timestamping’s mechanism [16], we simplify the protocol by using CA as a trusted party {{which is responsible for}} the issuing and verification of timestamps as well as issuing a digital certificate that contains a <b>name</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>holder,</b> a serial number, expiration date, and a holder’s public key. Therefore, <b>the</b> steps <b>of</b> generating a timestamp are as follows. At first, the owner signs his protected data using his private key and generates a fingerprint by using a digital signature function. Then, the fingerprint is sent to CA. The CA generates a timestamp based on the owner’s fingerprint and the date and time obtained from an accurate time source. The timestamp is sent back to the owner. The CA keeps a record <b>of</b> <b>the</b> timestamp for future verification.|$|R

40|$|One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> serious {{problems}} {{is how to}} authenticate the passport document for its <b>holder.</b> &# 13; <b>The</b> major factor <b>of</b> this authenticity is <b>the</b> corresponding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Passport's photo with its <b>holder.</b> Most&# 13; <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Passport document contains a holder's signature in addition, <b>of</b> course, to <b>the</b> full name. We&# 13; propose a firm authentication method by extracting some features for <b>the</b> original <b>name</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> holder&# 13; with the passport number and digest them in a form, by applying some techniques, that can be hidden&# 13; in the passport's photo. <b>The</b> modern method <b>of</b> issuing a passport now is by using a computer in fixing&# 13; the passport's photo (imaging). In using this method we could hide the invisible watermark which&# 13; contains the digest name and passport number inside the passport's photo. During the hidden process&# 13; there are many techniques {{could be applied to}} disguise any color difference appears during the hidden&# 13; process. After using this technique, it is very simple to use the computer in scanning and verifying,&# 13; at check point, that the passport's photo has been not replaced and that by comparing the invisible&# 13; watermark with <b>the</b> digest <b>name</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>holder</b> and passport number. </font...|$|R
