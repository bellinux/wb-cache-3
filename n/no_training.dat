5|$|Bolt made a cameo {{appearance}} in the opening sketch of 13 October 2012 broadcast of Saturday Night Live, hosted by Christina Applegate. The segment was a parody of the Vice Presidential debate between Joe Biden and Paul Ryan. In the sketch, Taran Killam mimicking Ryan had just lied about running a 2:50 marathon, a sub-4-minute mile on <b>no</b> <b>training</b> and winning the 100 metres in London when Bolt was introduced as his partner to confirm.|$|E
5|$|Cabral {{became the}} {{military}} chief, while far more experienced navigators were seconded to the expedition to aid him in naval matters. The {{most important of}} these were Bartolomeu Dias, Diogo Dias and Nicolau Coelho. They would, along with the other captains, command 13 ships and 1,500 men. Of this contingent, 700 were soldiers, although most were simple commoners who had <b>no</b> <b>training</b> or previous experience in combat.|$|E
5|$|Football was {{an amateur}} game until July 1885, when the Football Association decided to legalise {{payments}} to players. West Bromwich Albion held a committee meeting the following month, {{at which it}} was decided that the club should become professional. Albion's first professionals earned 10 shillings (50 pence) per week, with <b>no</b> <b>training</b> allowance provided.|$|E

5|$|Captain Merrill T. Kinnecommander of the Port Chicago {{facility}} {{at the time}} of the explosionhad served in the Navy from 1915 to 1922 and had returned to the Navy from civilian life in 1941 to be posted aboard a general cargo ship. Prior to his being sent to command Port Chicago, Kinne had <b>no</b> <b>training</b> in the loading of munitions and very little experience in handling them. White loading officers serving underneath Kinne had not been trained in supervising enlisted personnel or in handling munitions until they had been posted to Mare Island Navy Yard, after which they were considered adequate to the task by the Navy.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 1950s, Charles H. Zimmerman of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) {{developed}} {{a system for}} control of a rotorcraft in which, with the rotors mounted {{on the underside of}} the aircraft, the machine could be steered by the pilot through the simple shifting of his weight, and kept stable through the actions of his natural reflexes. Known as kinesthetic control, and similar in principle to the mechanics of riding a bicycle or a surfboard, it was hoped that the concept would allow for pilots to operate an aircraft with little to <b>no</b> <b>training</b> time. NACA testing proved that the idea had merit, and several companies, including Bensen Aircraft, Hiller Aircraft, and de Lackner Helicopters, began development of rotorcraft using the concept.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} years of the decade, Nea Salamina was strong in home games but weak away. Noteworthy is the conquest of the amateur {{championship}} from farm team the period 1960–61, The games of the farm team gathered the same interest with the main team among fans, who enthusiastically celebrated winning the title. During this period the nucleus for a successful team was created, including Kyriakos Koureas (who later played for Olympiakos Piraeus). In December 1963, the league disbanded; at that time, Nea Salamina was in a tight three-way race with Omonia and APOEL. With the creation of Cypriot National Guard, many Nea Salamina's players joined the army; players would often come straight from camps throughout Cyprus to play league games with <b>no</b> <b>training.</b>|$|E

5|$|Gladiators {{were trained}} combatants {{who might be}} slaves, convicts, or free volunteers. Death was not a {{necessary}} or even desirable outcome in matches between these highly skilled fighters, whose training represented a costly and time-consuming investment. By contrast, noxii were convicts sentenced to the arena with little or <b>no</b> <b>training,</b> often unarmed, and with no expectation of survival. Physical suffering and humiliation were considered appropriate retributive justice for the crimes they had committed. These executions were sometimes staged or ritualized as re-enactments of myths, and amphitheatres were equipped with elaborate stage machinery to create special effects. Tertullian considered deaths in the arena {{to be nothing more}} than a dressed-up form of human sacrifice.|$|E
5|$|Louise had artistic {{training}} from childhood, {{first with}} Susan Durant from 1864, then Mary Thornycroft from 1867, and further lessons with Edgar Boehm. She also then attended National Art Training School, or NATS, which {{marks the first}} time a member of the British royal family attended a public education institution. Like many women artists in the nineteenth century, Louise had to make do with training intended for industrial designers and art teachers rather than fine artists. There was <b>no</b> <b>training</b> from the nude model, as there was for male art students.|$|E
5|$|The Hong Kong-route {{was officially}} opened on 5 August 1949. Braathens SAFE had then moved its {{operative}} base from Gardermoen to Oslo Airport, Fornebu. The company stationed technical employees in Rome, Karachi, Bangkok and Hong Kong, {{as well as}} having an agreement with KLM. The planes would stop each night and crew and passengers would stay at a hotel. Cabin crew had <b>no</b> <b>training,</b> and learned the job as they worked. Chicken {{was the most common}} lunch meal, and the cabin crew had to purchase this fresh each day, usually observing the slaughter to ensure its freshness. In 1949, sixty-seven flights were made to Hong Kong, as well as two to Tokyo, to Venezuela and one to Johannesburg.|$|E

5|$|Droits de l'Homme was irreparably damaged, {{and many}} of the men on board were {{soldiers}} with <b>no</b> <b>training</b> for what to do {{in the event of a}} shipwreck. Each successive wave swept more men into the water and desperate attempts to launch boats failed when the small craft were swept away by the waves and broken in the surf. Rafts were constructed, but several were swamped in attempts to carry a rope to the shore. The men on the one raft that remained upright were forced to cut the rope to prevent them from foundering in the heavy seas. Some of the men on this raft reached the beach, the first survivors of the wreck. Subsequent attempts were made by individuals to swim to shore with ropes, but they were either drowned or driven back to the ship by the force of the sea.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the Citizen Forces {{deteriorated}} {{during the}} war as the AIF was given precedence for manpower and other resources. While {{the size of the}} force increased during 1915, a high proportion volunteered for overseas service with the AIF. Many officers were used to train AIF recruits, and camp facilities and equipment were also assigned to the expeditionary force. This greatly disrupted the Citizen Forces training activities, with few units conducting camps during late 1915 or 1916. While there were intakes of conscripts to the Citizen Forces during 1916 and 1917, few were ever required to undertake periods of training or active service. In October 1916 approximately 37,000 reservists were called up {{for a short period of}} compulsory training ahead of the first plebiscite on conscription. By 1918 the Citizen Forces were close to collapse as many of its best members had transferred to the AIF and the remaining personnel were largely untrained. Attempts were made to revive the Citizen Forces during the last months of the war. The initially successful German Spring Offensive, which began in March, led to concerns Japan could attack Australia. In response, regular training camps for militia units were reinstated. A scheme to set up a reserve force manned by returned AIF veterans attracted 17,000 volunteers, yet they received <b>no</b> <b>training.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{first use}} in {{action of the}} Il-2 was with the 4th ShAP (Ground Attack Regiment) over the Berezina River days after the {{invasion}} began. The aircraft was so new that the pilots had <b>no</b> <b>training</b> in flight characteristics or tactics, and the ground crew <b>no</b> <b>training</b> in servicing or re-arming. The training received only enabled the pilots to take-off and land; none of the pilots had fired the armament, let alone learned tactics. There were 249 Il-2s available on 22 June 1941. In the first three days, 4th ShAP had lost 10 Il-2s to enemy action, a further 19 were lost to other causes, and 20 pilots were killed.|$|E
