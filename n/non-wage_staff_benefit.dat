40|$|Learning {{about and}} {{experiencing}} enterprise whilst at university {{can lead to}} enhanced employability and entrepreneurship skills, and can suggest an alternative career option in business start-up or self-employment. However, educators are often resistant to helping their students learn about enterprise and entrepreneurship, or may struggle to fit additional learning opportunities in an already full subject-specific curriculum. This paper offers two case studies showing how students can learn about their subject through enterprise-related assessment tasks such as a tendering exercise or an ideas pitch. In both case studies, {{the emphasis is on}} the subject-specific learning, but enterprise and entrepreneurial skills are also acquired. Formal and informal evaluation shows that students are enthused by the tasks, and that <b>staff</b> <b>benefit</b> from increased knowledge of enterprise issues and links with the business community...|$|R

40|$|This paper reports {{research}} that examined how the embedding of library services through the learning management system {{contributed to the}} experience of students from low socio-economic status (SES) backgrounds. To evaluate the embedded practice, the researchers used a mixed-method approach involving surveys with students and interviews with library and academic staff. Survey results showed gains in students 2 ̆ 7 awareness of library resources and in their confidence and satisfaction using them. <b>Staff</b> participants reported <b>benefits</b> to students from the improved visibility of the library and involvement of students in conversations about information literacy. The teacher derived personal benefits in learning more about digital information resources while library <b>staff</b> <b>benefitted</b> from the research-driven nature of the practice which strengthened their collaborative partnership with academic staff. Based on the evaluation, an embedded approach has been adopted at the university in additional courses which have similar student profiles. The outcomes are relevant more widely in demonstrating both the potential benefits of embedded practice for supporting diverse student populations and how libraries can target their activities more effectively to national and university agendas for improving student outcomes...|$|R

HEPI measures the average relative level in the prices of a fixed market basket of goods and services typically purchased by colleges and universities through current-fund educational and general expenditures, excluding expenditures for research. Educational and general expenditures include the functions of instruction and departmental research, extension and public services, educational programs such as workshops and instructional institutes supported by sponsors outside the institution, student services, general administration and expenses, <b>staff</b> <b>benefits,</b> libraries, and operation and maintenance of the physical plant. Sponsored research, sales and services of education departments, and auxiliary enterprises are not priced by HEPI.
