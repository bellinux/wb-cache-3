6000|$|One {{great man}} remains of this elder group, who did their last work only under Victoria; he knew {{most of the}} members of it, yet he did not belong to it in any {{corporate}} sense. He was a poor man and an invalid, with Scotch blood and a strong, though perhaps only inherited, quarrel with the old Calvinism; by name Thomas Hood. Poverty and illness forced him to the toils of an incessant jester; and the revolt against gloomy religion made him turn his wit, whenever he could, {{in the direction of a}} defence of happier and humaner views. In the long great roll that includes Homer and Shakespeare, he was the last great man who really employed the pun. His puns were not all good (nor were Shakespeare's), but the best of them were a strong and fresh form of art. The pun is said to be a thing of two meanings; but with Hood there were three meanings, for there was also the abstract truth that would have been there with <b>no</b> <b>pun</b> at all. The pun of Hood is underrated, like the [...] "wit" [...] of Voltaire, by those who forget that the words of Voltaire were not pins, but swords. In Hood at his best the verbal neatness only gives to the satire or the scorn a ring of finality such as is given by rhyme. For rhyme does go with reason, since the aim of both is to bring things to an end. The tragic necessity of puns tautened and hardened Hood's genius; so that there is always a sort of shadow of that sharpness across all his serious poems, falling like the shadow of a sword. [...] "Sewing at once with a double thread a shroud as well as a shirt"--"We thought her dying when she slept, and sleeping when she died"--"Oh God, that bread should be so dear and flesh and blood so cheap"--none can fail to note in these a certain fighting discipline of phrase, a compactness and point which was well trained in lines like [...] "A cannon-ball took off his legs, so he laid down his arms."

While some scholars have understood the system to {{not be considered a}} complete writing system, this is a changing topic. The existence of logograms and syllabic signs are being documented and a phonetic aspect of the writing system has emerged, even though many of the syllabic characters have been documented since at least 1888 by Nuttall. There are conventional signs for syllables and logograms which act as word signs or for their rebus content. Logosyllabic writing appears on both painted and carved artifacts, such as the Tizoc Stone.

40|$|Extract] Executive Summary "… {{the human}} {{component}} of CCTV {{is what makes}} observation possible [...] . increased resources toward 'human aspects' of surveillance {{may be necessary to}} ensure maximum efficiency of CCTV. " (Piza et al, 2012), p 23. The core concept of scientific Realism is simple; researchers should seek to discover and explicitly explain how the program theories in an intervention are supposed to work, then measure if they do. This research project utilises a Realist approach. This report identifies and begins refining some implicit theories underlying open-space, urban CCTV effectiveness in addressing alcohol-related assault in night-time economies. Firstly a Realist Synthesis explores the literature to discover the theories upon which published research into this issue is based. A case study approach then compares a Realist Evaluation of the Cairns Regional Council's CCTV system with those theoretical findings. The findings are used to recommend operational improvements for existing CCTV systems, as well as policy directions and future research into important crime reduction mechanisms. This report comprises three parts. The first part is the description of a project funded by the Criminological Research Council which aimed to identify and refine the theoretical bases of how open-space urban CCTV systems which are owned and managed by local governments reduce alcohol-related assaults within the night-time economy (NTE). Realism aims to understand what works for whom, why, how and when (Tilley, 2004). This section provides practical, operational and strategic suggestions to system managers and operators which will improve system effectiveness. For example, it is suggested that ongoing formalised workshops between council and police management to enhance real-time communication and response between the camera room and police on the ground improves speed of deployment and can promote a perception within NTE patrons of a zero-tolerance approach to public disorder. This section also contains recommendations on a strategic program for policy makers and funders. For example, the Realist approach facilitates a multi-site, quasi-experimental design to refine CCTV effectiveness regarding this type of assault. Such a study is recommended. The second part of this report is a methodological commentary on the scientific Realist research processes used to conduct the project. It aims to encourage other criminological researchers to consider this approach as part of the methodological suite. It provides a pragmatic guide for researchers to problems the author experienced in conducting this realist research project and offer examples of how these problems were overcome, as well as listing relevant research resources which were used to do so. The third part is an examination of scientific Realism as applied to this criminological research project, and the illumination of some under-discussed mechanisms related to the use of CCTV to prevent crime in public spaces. While many operational and strategic processes within the use of CCTV systems are merely complicated, some of the mechanisms on which it relies, such as deterrence, are complex. Scientific Realism states that reality has a number of levels which can be measured and explored. Some mechanisms which cause change exist at the deep level of reality. These deep mechanisms {{have an impact on the}} effectiveness of open-space CCTV as a crime reduction tool. This section attempts to reintroduce a more critical criminological analysis of CCTV, through a Realist lens. This section contains <b>no</b> <b>puns,</b> but does begin to explore a feminist critique of CCTV monitoring in public spaces, and the public/private policing divide when viewed within the current Federal policy framework of contestability (Shepherd, Boxall, Cole, Fisher, & Vanstone, 2014). While CCTV is a place-based crime control strategy, it requires human monitoring to be maximally effective and should include real-time communication links to police and private security on the ground. The role of camera operators is critical in incident detection, real-time deployment and provision of intelligence on-scene, as well as in supporting police investigative and prosecutorial functions, and in gathering quantitative and contextual data on assault hot-spots. More than 21 million of capital funding for CCTV infrastructure has been provided through the Commonwealth Proceeds of Crime and associated programs between 2007 and the beginning of the 2014 calendar year. This report offers evidence to more efficiently plan and allocate future resources, as well as potentially improve the efficiency and effectiveness of existing CCTV systems through focusing on the human processes underlying them...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this field}} study was to {{investigate}} the relationship of plasma urea nitrogen (PUN) with the pregnancy rate in lactating AwassixMerino ewes. One hundred and eighty-five AwassixMerino ewes were used in the present study. Ewes were fed a diet containing 17. 4 % crude protein and were milked twice a day by the milking machine. The ewes were synchronized for estrus by insertion of intravaginal sponges containing 30 mg flurogestone acetate for 14 days. At the time of sponge removal each ewe was administered eCG (600 IU). All ewes were inseminated twice with fresh semen into the external os of the cervix at 48 and 56 h after sponge removal. The day of insemination was considered as Day 0 for calculating the gestational period. Blood samples were collected from each ewe at Days 0, 18 for measurement of PUN concentrations and at Day 22 after AI for measurement of pregnancy-associated glycoprotein (PAG) by radioimmunoassay (RIA). Thirty-eight ewes (20. 5 %) were confirmed pregnant by PAG-RIA test at Day 22 and by ultrasonography at Day 80. The mean (+/-S. D.) concentration of PUN in all ewes at Day 0 was 12. 7 +/- 4. 6 mmol/L. There were non-significant differences in the level of PUN between pregnant and non-pregnant ewes at Days 0 (12. 2 +/- 4. 2 mmol/L vs. 12. 8 +/- 4. 7 mmol/L, respectively) and 18 (9. 6 +/- 2. 9 mmol/L vs. 10. 4 +/- 4. 0 mmol/L, respectively) after AI. Mean PUN concentrations decreased significantly from Day 0 to Day 18 after AI in both pregnant and non-pregnant ewes. By using logistic regression analysis, there was <b>no</b> effect of <b>PUN</b> concentrations on the probability of pregnancy occurrence in the studied ewes (odds ratio: 0. 97; 95 % confidence interval: 0. 9 - 1. 05; P= 0. 45).

40|$|This {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} {{examine the effect of}} feeding small, isoenergetic amounts of supplements containing high protein and functional lipid components, rather than the greater amounts of cereal and/or legume grains usually fed during the dry season in Australia, on dry matter intake (DMI), growth performance, plasma metabolites, and fat deposition in lambs consuming low quality roughage. Thirty two crossbred wether lambs ([Merino × Border Leicester] × Poll Dorset) were divided into four groups by stratified randomization according to liveweight (26 – 33 kg). After a 7 -day adaptation to a hay diet (lucerne hay:oaten hay; 30 : 70), lambs were allocated to four treatments consisting of (1) basal diet of lucerne hay:oat hay (20 : 80; metabolizable energy (ME) = 7. 0 MJ/kg DM), Basal; (2) basal + canola meal (84 g per day), CM; (3) basal + soymeal (75 g per day), SM; or (4) basal + fishmeal (80 g per day), FM. Daily hay and supplement DMI, and weekly liveweight were recorded during a 53 -day experimental study. Blood samples were taken on day 1 and pre- and post-feeding on days 30 and 53 to measure changes in plasma glucose and plasma urea nitrogen (PUN) concentration. At the end of the experiment, lambs were slaughtered and hot carcass weight (HCW) recorded; cold carcass fatness (total muscle and adipose tissue depth at 12 th rib, 110 mm from midline; GR) was determined at 24 h postmortem. Total DMI was increased (P < 0. 001) in CM, SM and FM treatments, but basal hay DMI intake was only increased (P < 0. 01) in CM and FM treatments compared with Basal treatment. This resulted in significant (P < 0. 01) increases in metabolizable energy (ME) and crude protein (CP) intakes in all supplemented treatments, with the highest intakes recorded in the FM treatment. Liveweight gain (LWG) was significantly increased in CM and SM (P < 0. 05) and FM (P < 0. 01) treatments but HCW was significantly (P < 0. 01) heavier slaughter only in the FM treatment. Feed conversion efficiency (P < 0. 001) and GR fat at depth (P < 0. 05) was reduced in all supplement treatments compared with Basal. Plasma glucose concentration was significantly (P < 0. 05) increased after feeding in all treatments but there was <b>no</b> treatment effect. <b>PUN</b> was significantly increased over time in the supplemented treatments compared with the Basal treatment; {{there was no significant difference}} between supplement treatments by day 53.
