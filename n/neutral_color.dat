5|$|For {{the scenery}} design, layout {{supervisor}} Rasoul Azadani took many {{pictures of his}} hometown of Isfahan, Iran for guidance. Other inspirations for design were Disney's animated films from the 1940s and 50s and the 1940 film The Thief of Bagdad. The coloring {{was done with the}} computerized CAPS process, and the color motifs were chosen according to the personality – the protagonists use light colors such as blue, the antagonists darker ones such as red and black, and Agrabah and its palace use the <b>neutral</b> <b>color</b> yellow. Computer animation was used for some elements of the film, such as the tiger entrance of the Cave of Wonders and the scene where Aladdin tries to escape the collapsing cave.|$|E
25|$|In color science, {{chromatic}} adaptation is {{the estimation of}} the representation of an object under a different light source from {{the one in which}} it was recorded. A common application is to find a {{chromatic adaptation}} transform (CAT) that will make the recording of a neutral object appear <b>neutral</b> (<b>color</b> balance), while keeping other colors also looking realistic. For example, chromatic adaptation transforms are used when converting images between ICC profiles with different white points. Adobe Photoshop, for example, uses the Bradford CAT.|$|E
2500|$|Basket of Apples (F99) {{was made}} in 1885 when Van Gogh experimented with Delacroix's color theory. [...] To his brother Theo, Van Gogh wrote: [...] "There is a certain pure bright red for the apples, then some greenish things. [...] Now there are one or two apples in another color, {{in a kind of}} pink — to improve the whole. [...] The pink is the broken color, created by mixing the first red and green mentioned. [...] This is why there is a {{connection}} between the colors. [...] Then I painted a second contrast, in the back- and foreground. [...] One was given a <b>neutral</b> <b>color</b> by [...] "breaking" [...] blue with orange; the other the same <b>neutral</b> <b>color,</b> only this time changed by adding a little yellow." ...|$|E

5000|$|... "Neutral colors don't usually {{show up on}} the <b>color</b> wheel. <b>Neutral</b> <b>colors</b> include black, white, gray, and {{sometimes}} brown and beige. They can be created by mixing two complementary colors or combining a pure color with white, black, or gray. Pure <b>neutral</b> <b>colors</b> include black, white, and all grays while near neutrals include browns, tans, and darker colors.'" ...|$|R

2500|$|To {{understand}} why chroma {{can be written}} as , notice that any <b>neutral</b> <b>color,</b> with , projects onto the origin and so has 0 chroma. Thus if we add or subtract the same amount from all three of R, G, and B, we move vertically within our tilted cube, and do not change the projection. Therefore, any two colors [...] and [...] project on the same point, and have the same chroma. The chroma of a color with one of its components equal to zero [...] is simply the maximum {{of the other two}} components. This chroma is M in the particular case of a color with a zero component, and [...] in general.|$|E
2500|$|Photographic film is {{made for}} {{specific}} light sources (most commonly daylight film and tungsten film), and, used properly, will create a <b>neutral</b> <b>color</b> print. Matching {{the sensitivity of the}} film to the color temperature of the light source is one way to balance color. If tungsten film is used indoors with incandescent lamps, the yellowish-orange light of the tungsten incandescent lamps will appear as white (3200K) in the photograph. [...] Color negative film is almost always daylight-balanced, since it is assumed that color can be adjusted in printing (with limitations, see above). [...] Color transparency film, being the final artefact in the process, has to be matched to the light source or filters must be used to correct color.|$|E
2500|$|Photographic {{emulsion}} film sometimes {{appears to}} exaggerate {{the color of the}} light, as it does not respond to lighting color in the way human visual perception does. An object that appears to the eye to be white {{may turn out to be}} very blue or orange in a photograph. The color balance may need to be corrected during printing to achieve a <b>neutral</b> <b>color</b> print. [...] The extent of this correction is limited since color film normally has three layers sensitive to different colors and when used under the [...] "wrong" [...] light source, every layer may not respond proportionally, giving odd color casts in the shadows, although the mid-tones may have been correctly white-balanced under the enlarger. [...] Light sources with discontinuous spectra, such as fluorescent tubes, cannot be fully corrected in printing either, since one of the layers may barely have recorded an image at all.|$|E

2500|$|There {{have been}} many {{attempts}} {{to reduce the size}} of speaker systems, or alternatively to make them less obvious. One such attempt was the development of [...] "exciter" [...] transducer coils mounted to flat panels to act as sound sources, most accurately called exciter/panel drivers. These can then be made in a <b>neutral</b> <b>color</b> and hung on walls where they are less noticeable than many speakers, or can be deliberately painted with patterns, in which case they can function decoratively. There are two related problems with flat panel techniques: first, a flat panel is necessarily more flexible than a cone shape in the same material, and therefore moves as a single unit even less, and second, resonances in the panel are difficult to control, leading to considerable distortions. Some progress has been made using such lightweight, rigid, materials such as Styrofoam, and there have been several flat panel systems commercially produced in recent years.|$|E
60|$|They {{stopped when}} they reached the highest strip of moor. The sun was low, the vast sweep of country beneath them was fading to <b>neutral</b> <b>color,</b> woods, low ridges, and river valleys losing their {{sharpness}} of contour as the light left them.

60|$|She {{glanced at}} her dress. It was a <b>neutral</b> <b>color</b> and like a uniform. After all, she had {{physical}} charm and it was sometimes irksome to wear unbecoming clothes. Then the lofty room, with its varnished desks and benches, looked bleak; her life was passed in bare class-rooms and echoing stone corridors. This would not have mattered had she been able to follow her bent and take the line she had once marked out; but she could not. She must give up the thought of independent research and teach for a living, cramping her talents to meet her pupils' intelligence, until, in time, she sank to their level.|$|E
60|$|He saw no more smoke {{for a long}} time--the {{increasing}} brightness {{seemed to}} diminish {{the clarity of the}} air. Before noon the pain in his side had become almost insupportable, and his head was swimming; he felt worn out, scarcely able to keep on his feet, but again a gray streak on the horizon put heart into him. It did not appear to move for a while, and he thought it must have been made by a freight-engine working about a station. Then, as he came down the gradual slope of a wide depression, a long bluff on its opposite verge cut the skyline, a hazy smear of <b>neutral</b> <b>color.</b> He determined to reach the wood and lie down for a time in its shadow.|$|E
