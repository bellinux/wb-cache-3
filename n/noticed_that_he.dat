5|$|Rosenthal is {{referred}} to as the pioneer of research into seasonal affective disorder. In 1984, he coined the term and began studying the use of light therapy as a treatment. Rosenthal's interest in studying the effects of the seasons on mood changes emerged when he emigrated from the mild climate of Johannesburg, South Africa, to the northeastern US. As a resident in the psychiatry program at the New York State Psychiatric Institute, he <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was more energetic and productive during the long days of summer versus the shorter darker days of the winter.|$|E
5|$|Tatsuguchi reached Rabaul on October 4, 1942. His {{stay there}} was {{probably}} short, for his wife recorded that he joined her in Tokyo that same month prior to being redeployed. Tatsuguchi was unable to tell his wife, now pregnant with their second child, {{where he would be}} assigned, but she <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> studied maps of the North Pacific area. At one point, he remarked to Taeko {{that he was going to}} an area where he might meet some of his former classmates from California.|$|E
5|$|About 10 a.m., one of Desha's neighbors {{encountered}} the riderless gray mare, still rigged with saddle and bridle. Catching the horse, he rode {{it up the}} road, shortly finding Desha's riderless bay (which he recognized), with a saddle but no bridle. He noticed blood on the neck and withers of Desha's horse. Further along, the neighbor encountered Desha on foot, carrying two saddlebags. Desha {{said that he had}} just accepted the gray mare as payment from a man who owed him money. He did not volunteer how the two horses had escaped his control, but mounted the gray mare and returned home. Later that day, friends at Desha's tannery <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was unusually quiet and repeatedly asked what was wrong. He said that he had been kicked by a horse and severely cut his finger in separate incidents the previous day.|$|E

5|$|According to Geisel's biographers Judith and Neil Morgan, Horton Hatches the Egg {{was born}} in 1940, the day after New Year's, {{when he took a}} break from drawing in his Park Avenue {{apartment}} and went for a walk. When he returned, he <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had left a window open in his studio and that the wind had blown one sketch on transparent paper on top of another, making it look like an elephant was sitting in a tree. This account was based on interviews with Geisel, who had told similar stories about the book's creation to reporters asking about his creative process since as early as 1957. The story had changed with each telling but always involved the fortuitous juxtaposition of drawings of an elephant and a tree.|$|E
5|$|Lützow {{was posted}} {{missing in action}} {{following}} combat on 24 April 1945 while attempting to intercept an attack by United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) Martin B-26 Marauder medium bombers near Donauwörth. According to Stockert, an examination of U.S. records by Mr. Hirst indicates that Lützow's Me262 crashed near Schrobenhausen. The USAAF flew three attacks against the oil terminals at Schrobenhausen, south of Neuburg an der Donau, that day. On their second mission, 22 B-26 bombers escorted by 16 Republic P-47 Thunderbolt fighter aircraft, were just beginning their bomb run at 3:25pm, when they came under attack by four Me262s. Two P-47s came diving down from their top cover position {{to fend off the}} attacking jets. In this account, one Me262 pilot <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was about to come under attack and attempted to dive away. Unable to recover from this dive, the American pilots observed the Me262 crashing into a small hill. This Me262 may have been piloted by Lützow.|$|E
25|$|Banihammad {{used the}} {{controversial}} program Visa Express to gain {{entry into the}} country together with Saeed al-Ghamdi. Upon later review of his application, it was <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had not listed an occupation or reason for visit, and when asked {{where he would be}} living in the country, simply wrote No. However, he still received the visa.|$|E

25|$|After {{selling his}} former startup, Indiagames to Disney in 2011 for {{approximately}} $100M, Vishal Gondal founded GOQii, a {{one on one}} mobile coaching and fitness tracking service. The idea for GOQii developed when he <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> wasn’t simply using the devices exclusively, but also sharing the collected data with a personal trainer who would then provide him with customized advice.|$|E
25|$|Orbison's severe {{stage fright}} was {{particularly}} noticeable in the 1970s and early 1980s. During {{the first few}} songs in a concert, the vibrato in his voice was almost uncontrollable, but afterward, it became stronger and more dependable. This also happened with age. Orbison <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was unable to control the tremor {{in the late afternoon}} and evenings, and chose to record in the mornings when it was possible.|$|E
25|$|During the offseason, Nicklaus {{addressed}} {{two problems}} which had hurt his performance. His lifelong teacher Jack Grout <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had become much too upright with his full swing, causing a steep, oblique approach into the ball, {{compared with a}} more direct hit; this was corrected by slightly flattening his backswing. Then Nicklaus' short game, never a career strength, was further developed {{with the help of}} Phil Rodgers, a friend for more than 20 years, and earlier PGA Tour rival, who had become a fine coach. Rodgers lived for a time at the Nicklaus home while this work was going on.|$|E

50|$|In addition, Edward Douglas-Scott-Montagu, 3rd Baron Montagu of Beaulieu {{had given}} a written <b>notice</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would retire on 17 September 2015, but <b>he</b> died before <b>that.</b>|$|R

25|$|In February 2002, Gilani {{went to a}} LeT {{training}} camp and did a three-week introductory course on LeT ideology and jihad. That summer, Serrill Headley, who by then {{had moved to the}} town of Oxford, Pennsylvania with her brother, confided to friends that her son had become a religious fanatic and had been to terrorist {{training camp}}s. While Gilani was on a catering visit to his mother's house, one of her friends, Phyllis Keith, <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> parked his car behind her residence as if he was trying to hide it. Keith reported Gilani to the FBI office in Philadelphia, which apparently did not follow through with an investigation.|$|E
25|$|Over the {{following}} years, several {{women and children}} who had hired Romasanta as a guide disappeared. The disappearances were not immediately noticed as Romasanta delivered letters to their families advising that they had arrived at their destinations and were settling in. However, suspicion was aroused when it was <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was selling their clothing locally and rumours spread that he was selling soap made from human fat. In 1852, a complaint was finally lodged in the city of Escalona alleging that Romasanta deceived women and children into travelling with him, that he then killed them and that he removed their fat which he then sold. He was arrested in September 1852, in Nombela, in the province of Toledo, and brought to trial in Allariz, in the province of Ourense. In his defence, Romasanta claimed that he was afflicted with Lycanthropy.|$|E
25|$|In September 1909, Erhardt {{was staying}} at the Union League Club while his wife, Nora Belle Jewett, was visiting their {{daughter}} at York Harbor, Maine {{for part of the}} summer. He had told his private secretary that he had not been feeling well, believing he may have developed rheumatism, and his friends at the club <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had been in ill health during the last month but appeared well while staying at the club. On the morning of September 7, at about 1:00a.m., the club watchman was passing Erhardt's room and saw him sitting at the side of his bed. Erhardt told them to get a doctor at once. His family physician, Dr. John Solley, was called from his home on West Fifty-Eighth Street but Erhardt died at 1.20a.m. At the time of his death, he was the president of the Lawyers' Surety Company and a director in a number of corporations.|$|E

25|$|Von Janowski {{showed up}} at the New Carlisle Hotel at 06:30 asking for a room with a bath. The son of the hotel manager, Earle Annett Jr., noticed that the {{stranger}} seemed preoccupied and quickly noticed some inconsistencies in his story. The man said he took the bus that morning before walking to the hotel, but the bus was not going through New Carlisle that day, and even if it had, it would have dropped him off at the hotel. Annett also <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> spoke English with a Parisian accent, his clothing had European styling, and that he paid for his cigarettes with an obsolete Canadian dollar bill that had not been in circulation for quite some time. The stranger also had a strange smell on him; he was using Belgian matches that did not carry the Canadian government seal that was applied to matchbooks at the time. Less than three hours after his arrival and before Annett could confirm his suspicions, the stranger paid his bill and {{made his way to the}} train station where he had a coffee while waiting for the next train.|$|E
25|$|Metzinger {{once did}} {{gorgeous}} mosaics of pure pigment, each little square of color not quite touching the next, so that {{an effect of}} vibrant light should result. He painted exquisite compositions of cloud and cliff and sea; he painted women and made them fair, even as the women upon the boulevards fair. But now, translated into the idiom of subjective beauty, into this strange Neo-Classic language, those same women, redrawn, appear in stiff, crude, nervous lines in patches of fierce color. Surely, Metzinger should know what such things mean. Picasso never painted a pretty woman, though we have <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> likes to associate with them. Czobel sees them through the bars of his cage, and roars out tones of mauve and cinnabar. Derain sees them as cones and prisms, and Braque {{as if they had}} been sawn out of blocks of wood by carpenters’ apprentices. But Metzinger is more tender towards the sex. He arranges them as flowers are arranged on tapestry and wall paper; he simplifies them to mere patterns, and he carries them gently past the frontier of Poster Land to the world of the Ugly so tenderly that they are not much damaged—only more faint, more vegetable, more anaemic.|$|E
25|$|He {{started the}} 2016 in February racing in the World Series of Asphalt Stock Car Racing at New Smyrna, a week-long series of racing in the Speedweeks. Majeski {{finished}} second in the first night and won the second night. He won the final night for his third win and the Speedweeks division title. He followed the series by racing in another southern race; he quickly went from a seventh place start to the lead as he dominated to win the Rattler 250 race at South Alabama Speedway. Speed51.com rated Majeski as its #1 Short Track Draft pick in May 2016. That month he won the first race of the ARCA Midwest Tour, the Joe Shear Memorial at Madison International Speedway, over Johnny Sauter. In May, he joined Roush Fenway Racing's driver development program. He was one of eleven drivers named to the NASCAR Next 2016–2017 class on the following day. In June 2016, Majeski made his first ARCA start in the No. 17 Roulo Brothers Racing car. He had the fastest time in practice, started seventh, raced up to second, and finished fourth. For the season, Majeski won 9 of 10 races at LaCrosse plus had several high finishes at Madison. Majeski <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was high in the NASCAR Whelen All-American Series national points in August despite not intentionally racing for any track's points championship. The driver's top 18 finishes determine their standings. He had 17 starts, so he made a late season decision to try for the national title. He started double features at Elko Speedway and climbed to tenth in the standings. On the following weekend he won the another feature at Madison for his 13th NASCAR weekly win of the season to climb to third in the standings. He raced more at Elko and Rockford Speedway but finished third in the final points. Majeski capped off the season by winning the Oktoberfest main event at La Crosse to earn his third consecutive ARCA Midwest Tour championship. He returned to New Smyrna Speedway and qualified on the pole position for the Governor's Cup. He fell nearly two laps down during the race and came back to win the race for the second consecutive year.|$|E

500|$|Around 1977, Belgian {{experimental}} psychologist Jozef Nuttin {{was driving}} {{on a highway}} looking at license plates when he <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> preferred plates containing letters from his own name. He wondered if people in general would prefer stimuli that are somehow connected to them; a [...] "mere belongingness" [...] as opposed to Zajonc's mere exposure.|$|E
500|$|The {{idea for}} Grindhouse came to Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino when Tarantino set up {{screenings}} of double features in his house, complete with trailers before {{and in between}} the films. During one screening in 2003, Rodriguez <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> owned the same double feature movie poster as Tarantino for the 1957 films Dragstrip Girl and Rock All Night. Rodriguez asked Tarantino, [...] "I {{always wanted to do}} a double feature. Hey, why don't you direct one and I'll do the other?" [...] Tarantino quickly replied, [...] "And we've got to call it Grindhouse!" ...|$|E
500|$|Andrew Kehoe was the 55-year-old {{school board}} {{treasurer}} and was angered by increased taxes and his {{defeat in the}} Spring 1926 election for township clerk. He was thought to have planned his [...] "murderous revenge" [...] after that public defeat. He {{had a reputation for}} difficulty on the school board and in personal dealings. In addition, he was notified that his mortgage was going to be foreclosed upon in June 1926. For much of the next year, a neighbor <b>noticed</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had stopped working on his farm and thought that he might be planning suicide. During that period, Kehoe purchased explosives and discreetly planted them on his property and under the school.|$|E
50|$|Thus, in his {{communal}} <b>notice</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{issued for}} Aigrefeuille, M. A. Gautier informed his contemporaries that the commune had ten villages and eight hamlets, besides the town, {{a situation that}} stood in 1839.|$|R
