25|$|Starting in May 2017, Rei Kawakubo will be {{the subject}} of one of the Metropolitan Museum of Art's fashion {{exhibitions}} in New York. Vogue magazine and the Metropolitan Museum in <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>have</b> announced that the exhibition dedicated to Kawakubo is scheduled for its 2017 season between 4 May 2017 and 4 September 2017. In an interview with Vogue in April 2017, Andrew Bolton, the curator for the Kawakubo exhibit at the Met stated: “I really think her influence is so huge, but sometimes it’s subtle. It’s not about copying her; it’s the purity of her vision... Rei was really involved {{in the design of the}} exhibit”. Bolton also stated that the exhibit in May 2017 will be an austere, all-white maze hosting approximately 150 Comme ensembles. Both the exhibit and accompanying book by Bolton are based upon the recurrent fashion dichotomies concentrating on eight thematic oppositions listed as: (1) fashion/antifashion; (2) design/not design; (3) model/multiple; (4) then/now; (5) high/low; (6) self/other; (7) object/subject; and (8) clothes/not clothes.|$|E

500|$|Many of Barbirolli's pre-war {{recordings}} for HMV were of concertos. His {{reputation as}} an accompanist tended to obscure his talents as a symphonic conductor, and later, his detractors in New York [...] "damned him with faint praise by exalting his powers as an accompanist and then implying that that was where it all stopped." [...] Barbirolli became very sensitive on this point, and for many {{years after the war}} he was reluctant to accompany anyone in the recording studio. Among his early HMV records are works, mainly concertos, by Brahms, Bruch, Chopin, Dvořák, Glazunov, Mendelssohn, Mozart, Schumann, Sibelius, Tchaikovsky and Vieuxtemps. From the 1990s onwards, archive recordings of Barbirolli's early concerts in <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>have</b> been issued on CD. Kennedy wrote in 2004 that they [...] "prove that the orchestra played superbly for him and that the criticism of him was largely unjustified." [...] Recordings from this period include symphonies by Beethoven, Mendelssohn, Mozart, Schubert, Schumann, Sibelius and Tchaikovsky, and other orchestral music by Berlioz, Debussy, Menotti, Purcell, Ravel, Respighi, and Rimsky-Korsakov.|$|E
