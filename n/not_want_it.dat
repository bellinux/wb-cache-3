5|$|Filming {{began at}} P. C. Sreeram's house in Alwarpet. Although {{the film was}} {{primarily}} set indoors in Delhi, Ratnam and Sreeram wanted the indoor scenes to look as lively as those shot outdoors. Since the cast was relatively small, Ratnam did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>it</b> to resemble a play and used backlighting for the interior scenes. Thotta Tharani found {{a house in the}} residential area of Kilpauk in Madras (now Chennai) which admitted a great deal of sunlight, making it similar to houses in Delhi. Mouna Ragam was Ratnam's first film to make extensive use of staccato dialogue; this became his trademark style in later films. To reduce production costs, food for the film's crew was cooked at Venkateswaran's home.|$|E
5|$|Game {{designer}} Mohammad Alavi {{was heavily}} involved in the level's development. Alavi sought to explain why Russia would invade the United States, and have the player make an emotional connection with Makarov. Much of the level's development was spent designing the massacre portion, as Alavi did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>it</b> to feel too contrived or traumatic. Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 developer Infinity Ward and publisher Activision were both supportive of the level's inclusion, though several game testers expressed disapproval, with one game tester refusing to play the level at all.|$|E
5|$|Mike B. Anderson {{stated that}} at least three {{different}} acts of material were written and animated for Krusty's comeback stand-up appearance at Moe's Tavern. It {{was not until the}} editing process that the material used was decided upon. The episode was still being animated three weeks before it was due to air and the production process moved frantically shortly before completion. The Canyonero sequence was originally planned to be displayed during the closing credits. The production team liked the scene so much that they did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>it</b> to be obscured by the credits and gave it its own segment {{at the end of the}} episode.|$|E
50|$|Usually {{employees}} and early investors want shorter lockups (so they can cash out sooner) while the underwriting banks want longer ones (to keep insiders from flooding {{the market and}} sinking the share price). The company is often somewhere in the middle—wanting to keep {{employees and}} investors happy but <b>not</b> <b>wanting</b> <b>it</b> to look like insiders don’t have faith in it.|$|R
5000|$|There were {{offers to}} play the role of a {{musician}} but I did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> to do <b>it.</b> I did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> to do <b>it</b> (musician role) because I had done it (with Rock On) beyond my expectations. I had surpassed the expectations. There was always talk about Rock On 2, so I <b>wanted</b> to preserve <b>it.</b>|$|R
50|$|As {{examples}} of the interplay between its relatively fearless approach and official consequences, it reported on the Sun Zhigang beating case (which led to {{the repeal of the}} forced repatriation law) and on the emergence of SARS {{at a time when the}} government was <b>not</b> <b>wanting</b> <b>it</b> covered. Shortly afterwards, several editors were prosecuted for corruption on what were widely seen as trumped-up charges.|$|R
5|$|Burns and {{his wife}} had been friends with Schuyler before {{production}} of the film. According to Glut, Schuyler had recently purchased a new sports jacket and did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>it</b> to get soiled or damaged during production. During the fight scene, in order to avoid stepping on and damaging it, Schuyler would remove the jacket and carry it over his shoulder. When the time came for the film's climax, where the Sun Demon fell to his death off a cliff, neither Burns nor Glut wanted to do the stunt, and neither wanted to damage the mask by putting it on a dummy. So Burns modified a G.I. Joe action figure so that it resembled the Sun Demon, and Glut then shot the figure in slow motion tumbling down a hole that resembled a valley. The original film's soundtrack was later added to the remake during post-production, with Glut's friend Bart Andrews supplying the Sun Demon's voice.|$|E
5|$|In March 1933, {{less than}} three months after the Nazis seized power, Himmler set up the first {{official}} concentration camp at Dachau. Hitler had stated that he did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>it</b> to be just another prison or detention camp. Himmler appointed Theodor Eicke, a convicted felon and ardent Nazi, to run the camp in June 1933. Eicke devised a system that was used as a model for future camps throughout Germany. Its features included isolation of victims from the outside world, elaborate roll calls and work details, the use of force and executions to exact obedience, and a strict disciplinary code for the guards. Uniforms were issued for prisoners and guards alike; the guards' uniforms had a special Totenkopf (death's head) insignia on their collars. By the end of 1934, Himmler took control of the camps {{under the aegis of the}} SS, creating a separate division, the SS-Totenkopfverbände.|$|E
5|$|After {{hearing about}} the game's success, Bushnell decided {{there would be more}} profit for Atari to {{manufacture}} the game rather than license it, but the interest of Bally and Midway had already been piqued. Bushnell decided to inform each of the two groups that the other was uninterested—Bushnell told the Bally executives that the Midway executives did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>it</b> and vice versa—to preserve the relationships for future dealings. Upon hearing Bushnell's comment, the two groups declined his offer. Bushnell had difficulty finding financial backing for Pong; banks viewed it as a variant of pinball, which at the time the general public associated with the Mafia. Atari eventually obtained a line of credit from Wells Fargo that it used to expand its facilities to house an assembly line. The company announced Pong on 29 November 1972. Management sought assembly workers at the local unemployment office, but was unable to keep up with demand. The first arcade cabinets produced were assembled very slowly, about ten machines a day, many of which failed quality testing. Atari eventually streamlined the process and began producing the game in greater quantities. By 1973, they began shipping Pong to other countries with the aid of foreign partners.|$|E
5000|$|Billboard {{published}} a largely positive {{review of the}} album, writing in its August 24, 2002, edition: [...] "When you find yourself humming along with an entire album and <b>not</b> <b>wanting</b> <b>it</b> to end, while also feeling that the artist is being completely honest and heartfelt, the project is definitely a special one. Stuart, the former Dog's Eye View frontman, accomplishes this difficult task with his solo debut." ...|$|R
5000|$|Street had {{announced}} that if 5,000 {{people did not}} attend a noontime rally at City Hall plaza on March 1, 2007, he would give up his candidacy for mayor. Media reports placed attendance at about 200, many of those curious passersby. Street was undeterred, saying he [...] "underestimated" [...] his passion and vowed {{to continue in the}} race, <b>not</b> <b>wanting</b> <b>it</b> to be considered a [...] "publicity stunt." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{film was}} {{originally}} intended for Theda Bara. However Bara {{chose not to}} renew her contract and, after making the ill-fated Kathleen Mavourneen, all but retired from film. While making Mavourneen, construction began on sets for The Queen of Sheba. <b>Not</b> <b>wanting</b> <b>it</b> to go to waste, William Fox chose to put Betty Blythe in the role. The film became a hit but Blythe never matched its success with her later films.|$|R
5|$|Tomb Raider: Underworld {{continued}} the plot line established in Legend. Crystal Dynamics used {{new technology to}} improve the character for seventh generation consoles, focusing on improving realism. The dirt accumulation and water cleansing mechanic from Legend was altered to be a real-time mechanic that can involve the entire game environment. To achieve a more natural appearance, the developers added spherical harmonics to provide indirect lighting to in-game objects like Lara Croft. Crystal Dynamics made the character model more complex and detailed than previous instalments, featuring more texture layers that determine the appearance of shadows and reflective light on it, and using skeletal animation to portray believable movement. The number of polygons in the model increased to 32,000. The developers enhanced Croft's facial model by {{increasing the number of}} polygons, bones used in the animation skeleton, and graphical shaders in the face to add more detail and expressive capabilities. The hair was created as a real-time cloth simulation to further add realism to its shape and movement. The developers kept Croft's hair tied back because they felt a real person would <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>it</b> flying around while performing dangerous manoeuvres. The character's body size was increased and breast size reduced to portray more realistic proportions.|$|E

25|$|The {{band had}} to cancel their 2016 world tour shortly before Synthia was released, because Shannon needed {{immediate}} treatment at the Royal Hospital for Women in Sydney for an ovarian cancer that had been diagnosed three years before. It had been kept private by her and the other band members, because she did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>it</b> to affect her life too much.|$|E

His eyes were {{flickering}} with mixed lights, wanting something of her, yet <b>not</b> <b>wanting</b> <b>it.</b> She shrank a little, {{as if she}} were exposed to his eyes, and {{as if it were a}} pain to her. She darkened, her soul clouded over, she turned aside. She had been driven out of her own radiant, single world. And she dreaded contact, it was almost unnatural to her at these times.|$|R

25|$|One ambitious noble named Paul, {{who thought}} it would be an easy thing to take the throne from an old man who had shown so plainly that he did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>it,</b> rose in rebellion. He soon learned his mistake. Wamba met him in battle, routed his army, and took him prisoner. Paul {{expected}} nothing less than to have his head stricken off, but Wamba simply ordered that it should be shaved.|$|E
25|$|Before the 16th century, the Igbo had a {{pictogram}} form {{of writing}} called “Nsibidi”. That form died out, most likely {{because many of}} its users were members of secret societies and did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>it</b> to be public. In 1854, A German philologist named Karl Richard Lepsius made a “Standard Alphabet”, meant for all the languages of the world. In 1882, Britain enacted an educational ordinance to direct the teaching of reading and writing only in English which temporarily inhibited the development of Igbo along with other languages of West Africa.|$|E
25|$|Linda goes to see Earl's lawyer, begging him {{to change}} Earl's will. She admits she married Earl for his money, but now loves him and does <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>it.</b> The lawyer {{suggests}} she renounce the will and refuse the money, which would go to Frank. Linda rejects his advice and leaves in a rage. Linda berates Phil for seeking out Frank, but later apologizes. She drives to a vacant parking lot and washes down handfuls of prescription medicine with alcohol. Dixon finds Linda in her car, near death, and calls an ambulance after taking money from her purse.|$|E
60|$|It {{was quite}} possible, supposing {{copies of the}} Autobiography to exist, that this might {{occasion}} {{a call from the}} generation of to-day, in answer to which the suppressed work might appear. This was a rather delicate operation to commence; but the instrument was <b>not</b> <b>wanting.</b> <b>It</b> was necessary that the subject should be first opened by some irresponsible party, whom more powerful parties might, as by accident, recognise and patronise, and on whose weakness they might build something stronger.|$|R

She finds herself in competition with Akira (female) to get Kikuchi's attention despite Akira <b>not</b> <b>wanting</b> <b>it</b> in the first place. She also owns a deserted island where she brings everyone on a private beach party, where she plans to attack Kikuchi head on and earn his love.|$|R
25|$|Although bearing some {{resemblance}} to the jet powered Avro Tudor 8 and 9 (the former flying on jet power in 1948 and the latter becoming the experimental Avro Ashton first flying in 1950), Floyd's design was conceived from the outset as a commercial jet airliner. The updated design was presented in October 1948, and in February 1948 TCA responded with changes of their own. Now they wanted the aircraft to cruise at , and they increased the fuel requirements to allow for wider diversions. In April, Gordon McGregor took over the presidency of TCA, and told Smye that he did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>it</b> {{to be the first}} airline with a jet. Nevertheless, the project pressed on, and was the topic of a major article in Aviation Week that November.|$|E
25|$|Bourassa {{left the}} federal {{parliament}} on May 11, 1907, but remained active in Quebec politics being {{elected to the}} Legislative Assembly of Quebec in the 1908 provincial election in Montréal division no. 2, leading the Ligue Nationaliste until retiring from the assembly on September 5, 1912. He continued to criticize Laurier because his compromises were mostly helping the British Empire, opposing Laurier's attempts to build a Canadian navy in 1911, which he believed would draw Canada into future imperial wars between Britain and Germany. He supported the eventual creation of an independent navy, but did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>it</b> to be under British command, as Laurier had planned. Bourassa's attacks depleted Laurier's strength in Quebec, contributing to the Liberal Party's loss in the 1911 election. Ironically, Bourassa's moves aided in {{the election of the}} Conservatives, who held more staunchly Imperialist policies than the Liberals.|$|E
25|$|The Griffin family {{must begin}} {{living on a}} stricter budget. A local news story on the lottery {{influences}} Peter to buy a ticket in hopes that he will win and set the family on a better financial platform. Peter reveals to his family that he has bought several thousand lottery tickets, admitting that he has taken out a second mortgage on the house in order to buy them. After watching {{the results of the}} lottery that night, they spend three days searching for the lottery tickets, only to discover that the lottery tickets were, in fact, printed by Peter. When the real batch arrives, they discover that they have indeed won it. The family are unable to decide how they should spend all the money, though Lois states that she does <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>it</b> to change their lifestyle. Defiant, Peter decides to begin living lavishly, and quits his job.|$|E

25|$|D. sylvestris is {{generally}} not considered a pest {{despite the fact that}} it is widespread in many regions and lives in urban areas nesting in areas such as the ground, in hedges, or hanging from eaves of houses. This is mostly due to the fact that this species of wasp does not like to enter buildings and is not interested in the types of food that are consumed by humans. It normally is not a problem around humans unless it builds a nest where people do <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>it</b> or where there is risk of children encountering the nest. The tree wasp is not very aggressive compared to other species of wasps, but can sting if it feels its nest is threatened. On the other hand, many of the reported pest problems for wasps in Scotland have been found to be D. sylvestris suggesting that many people do consider it a pest. Whether this was just from the presence of the nest or aggression of the wasps is unknown.|$|E
25|$|The Democrats split {{over the}} choice of a {{successor}} to President James Buchanan along Northern and Southern lines; factions of the party provided two separate candidacies for president in the election of 1860, in which the Republican Party gained ascendancy. The radical pro-slavery Fire-Eaters led a walkout at both the April Democratic convention in Charleston's Institute Hall and the June convention in Baltimore when the national party would not adopt a resolution supporting the extension of slavery into territories even if the voters of those territories did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>it.</b> These Southern Democrats nominated the pro-slavery incumbent vice president, John C. Breckinridge of Kentucky, for president and General Joseph Lane, former Governor of Oregon, for vice president. The Northern Democrats nominated Senator Stephen A. Douglas of Illinois for president and former Governor of Georgia Herschel V. Johnson for vice president, while some southern Democrats joined the Constitutional Union Party, backing its nominees (who had both been prominent Whig leaders), former Senator, Speaker of the House, and Secretary of War John Bell of Tennessee for president and the politician, statesman, and educator Edward Everett of Massachusetts for vice president. This fracturing of the Democrats led to a Republican victory, and Abraham Lincoln was elected the 16th President of the United States.|$|E
