2500|$|The {{preamble}} of Section 91 of the Constitution Act, 1867 states: [...] "It {{shall be}} lawful for the Queen ... to make laws for the Peace, Order, and good Government of Canada, {{in relation to}} all Matters not coming within the Classes of Subjects by this Act assigned exclusively to the Legislatures of the Provinces". In addition to assigning powers <b>not</b> <b>stated</b> <b>elsewhere</b> (which has been narrowly interpreted), {{this has led to}} the creation of the national-emergency and national-concern doctrines.|$|R

The brief looks at the distribution across the Northern Territory, by sex, and within age groups. A number of other variables are cross classified to look for links between Indigenous not <b>stated</b> and <b>not</b> <b>stated</b> <b>elsewhere</b> on the Census form...|$|R
50|$|Bard, {{which both}} taps the Saw Kill for {{drinking}} water and, further downstream, discharges its treated wastewater into it, began monitoring the stream's {{health in the}} early 2000s. In 2006 it built an eel ladder below one of the surviving dams {{in cooperation with the}} state Department of Environmental Conservation's Hudson Estuary Program to allow American eels to reach their mating grounds upstream. Later in the decade, after winning a state grant, the college began exploring the possibility of generating power at the dams, if <b>not</b> <b>elsewhere</b> in the <b>state,</b> to offset greenhouse gas production.In 2009 Historic Hudson Valley considered selling Montgomery Place, which it said it had bought without realizing how much it would cost to maintain, much less renovate. After criticism from the Delafields, who had similarly found the property too expensive to keep, the organization abandoned the idea. In 2016 it sold the property to Bard for $17 million, putting both sides of the lower Saw Kill under the same ownership for the first time.|$|R
