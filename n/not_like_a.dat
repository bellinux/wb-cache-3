5|$|Part of {{the battle}} was shot at Ústí nad Labem in the Czech Republic. Only the {{entrance}} to Aslan's How was built on location. Adamson wanted Peter and Miraz's duel to feel unique and <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> controlled, overly choreographed fencing match: Moseley and Castellitto began training for the scene in November 2006. The stunt coordinator Allan Poppleton doubled for Castellitto in some shots because they are similar in size. For claustrophobic shots, cameras were built into their shields. The main camera was placed on a 360 degree track surrounding the ruin it takes place on. The filmmakers dug a large {{hole in the ground}} for the scene where the Narnians cause the pillars supporting the growth near Aslan's How to collapse on the Telmarines. The earth was then restored following completion of the scene. They also had to restore the grass after filming numerous cavalry charges. 18,000 fern plants were imported to the Czech Republic to create a forest. A scene shot in Poland, which involved building a cliff face, also had to leave no trace behind. Filming finished by September 8, 2007.|$|E

25|$|Einstein was {{the first}} {{physicist}} to say that Planck's discovery of the quantum (h) would require a rewriting {{of the laws of}} physics. To support his point, in 1905 he proposed that light sometimes acts as a particle which he called a light quantum (see photon and wave–particle duality). Bohr {{was one of the most}} vocal opponents of the photon idea and did not openly embrace it until 1925. The photon appealed to Einstein because he saw it as a physical reality (although a confusing one) behind the numbers. Bohr disliked it because it made the choice of mathematical solution arbitrary. He did <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> scientist's having to choose between equations.|$|E
25|$|So I {{wrote this}} song that I loved and I {{sent it to}} them and he and Joel, I remember, left me a great message saying, I hate you, you bastard, I love this song. We're gonna have to do it. We're gonna have to re-build the Wiltern Theater, which they had taken down, it was {{a million dollars to}} re-do the ending... and I felt all his hostility for Universal. A guy named Sean Daniels, who was head of production, one day said to me, well there is hostility because we {{understand}} you waited about eight months to come up with that final song and you never did it. I said, where'd you hear that? I did it in two days. He said, Jimmy Iovine. So I went to Jimmy Iovine and I said all that to his, yeah it's true, I know. I blamed you but you can't be upset with me.

25|$|Was it a mistake? No, said Lise Meitner; Hahn was {{too good}} a chemist for that. But how could barium be formed from uranium? No larger {{fragments}} than protons or helium nuclei (alpha particles) had ever been chipped away from nuclei, and to chip off a large number not nearly enough energy was available. Nor {{was it possible that}} the uranium nucleus could have been cleaved right across. A nucleus was <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> brittle solid that can be cleaved or broken; George Gamow had suggested early on, and Bohr had given good arguments that a nucleus was much more like a liquid drop. Perhaps a drop could divide itself into two smaller drops in a more gradual manner, by first becoming elongated, then constricted, and finally being torn rather than broken in two? We knew that there were strong forces that would resist such a process, just as the surface tension of an ordinary liquid drop tends to resist its division into two smaller ones. But nuclei differed from ordinary drops in one important way: they were electrically charged, and that was known to counteract the surface tension.|$|E

How do I know that in hating death I am <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> man who, having left home in his youth, has forgotten the way back?"

500|$|Campbell {{is widely}} {{considered}} to be the single most important and influential editor in the early history of science fiction. The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction wrote: [...] "More than any other individual, he helped to shape modern sf." [...] After 1950, new magazines such as Galaxy Science Fiction and The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction moved in different directions and developed talented new writers who were not directly influenced by him. Campbell often suggested story ideas to writers (including [...] "Write me a creature that thinks as well as a man, or better than a man, but <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> man"), and sometimes asked for stories to match cover paintings he had already bought.|$|E

500|$|The film's setting {{proved to}} be a {{potential}} problem for Carpenter, who needed to create a decaying, semi-destroyed version of New York City on a shoe-string budget. He and the film's production designer Joe Alves rejected shooting on location in New York City because it would be too hard {{to make it look like}} a destroyed city. Carpenter suggested shooting on a movie back lot but Alves nixed that idea [...] "because the texture of a real street is <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> back lot." [...] They sent Barry Bernardi, their location manager (and associate producer), [...] "on a sort of all-expense-paid trip across the country looking for the worst city in America," [...] producer Debra Hill remembers.|$|E

It is <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> normal Coronation Street story, it's more like a Taggart or a Cracker." [...] Jones thought the [...] "scrapes" [...] that Toyah found herself in were frightening and hoped that if the storyline could stop one teenager from running away from home, then it would be worthwhile. The storyline attracted the attention of the Independent Television Commission, who believed that the episode featuring Toyah's abduction should have carried a warning before it was broadcast.|$|E
500|$|Before {{discovering}} Larkin, Disney {{had been}} insisting on auditioning exclusively performers who {{were capable of}} singing {{as well as they}} could act. However, after Williams' recruitment, the studio relented in favor of casting [...] "strong actors" [...] instead. When Larkin first auditioned for the role, [...] "A Whole New World", Jasmine's only surviving song, had not yet been written; she admitted, [...] "there's no way I would have even auditioned... {{if there had been a}} song from the beginning." [...] After writing Jasmine's first song, the filmmakers asked Larkin if she would be interested in recording it and providing the character's singing voice. Larkin immediately declined, joking, [...] "I do ... but <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> princess!" [...] Thus, Disney decided to recruit a singer who could mimic Larkin's speaking voice instead, despite the actress' fear that the studio would completely replace her with a professional singer altogether.|$|E
