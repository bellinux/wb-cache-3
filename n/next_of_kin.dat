In June, parliamentarian Magnus Stangeland criticized the commission for working too slow, stating that the victims and <b>next</b> <b>of</b> <b>kin</b> needed answers to why the accident happened. The lack of cooperation between the police and the commission was the main source of the delays.

40|$|The use of {{coercion}} in psychiatry involves clinical, legal, scientific, ethical and emotional considerations. This thesis represents {{an attempt to}} further increase our understanding of some empirical aspects of this phenomenon. Interviews with 202 involuntarily admitted psychiatric patients and 201 voluntarily admitted patients and 295 <b>of</b> their <b>next</b> <b>of</b> <b>kins</b> were performed and analysed together with data from records and assessments made by professionals. Data was collected during two different periods of time with a compulsory psychiatric care law reform in between. Experience {{of at least one}} coercive measure was more common amongst patients who had been committed during the most recent legislation. Otherwise there were no differences in patient experiences during the different laws. Subjective short-term outcome was associated with having a contact person at the ward and being subjectively treated well. There were no relationships between subjective and assessed outcome or between legal status, perceived coercion at admission and subjective or assessed improvement. The changed legislation had no clear effect on the attitudes <b>of</b> patients and <b>next</b> <b>of</b> <b>kins</b> towards coercion. A majority of patients were able to accurately answer the question whether they had been restrained by belt or not during a specific treatment episode. Nineteen of 115 patients reported they had been restrained by belt. Eleven of these cases were true positive and 8 cases were false positive. In conclusion, the main results were first {{that when it comes to}} issues related to psychiatric coercion there are typically considerable differences between how these are perceived and interpreted by the professional and by the patient, and second that efforts made to change the face of psychiatric coercion in the minds of patients as well as the public on part of public policymakers have had limited effects...|$|R

5|$|The {{original}} Royal Warrant, {{was silent}} {{on whether the}} VC could be awarded posthumously. From 1857 until 1897, 18 recipients were gazetted after their deaths but only 12 of the <b>next</b> <b>of</b> <b>kin</b> received the actual medal. In the other six cases there was a memorandum stating {{that they would have}} been recommended for the VC had they survived. By 1899, the precedent had been established that the VC could be awarded posthumously if the recommendation for the award was submitted prior to the recipient’s death from wounds. Two such awards were granted during the Second Boer War, the well known award to Frederick Roberts, the son of Lord Roberts VC and to Francis Parsons. In 1900 and 1901, three memoranda were issued for Herman Albrecht, Robert Digby-Jones and David Younger stating they would have been recommended for the VC had they survived. In a partial reversal of policy restricted to the Second Boer War, it was announced in the London Gazette on 8 August 1902, that the <b>next</b> <b>of</b> <b>kin</b> of the three soldiers mentioned in memoranda would be sent medals.

5|$|IWGC war cemeteries {{featured}} {{grass and}} flowers within a walled area, intended to resemble an English garden; almost all were constructed around a War Stone and a Cross of Sacrifice, described {{in more detail}} below. The style varied slightly by architect and location, but typically the cemeteries followed classical influences in buildings and monuments, sometimes adapted slightly to appeal to the style of a particular Dominion. The buildings at the cemeteries were important symbolically and formed a key part of these designs. The graves proved controversial: initially they were marked by wooden crosses but, after some argument, it was agreed to replace these with Portland stone markers; the original wooden memorials were in some cases returned to the soldier's <b>next</b> <b>of</b> <b>kin.</b> Each marker was identical in shape and individualised only through the inscription of the name, regiment, date of death, a religious symbol and a short text agreed by the <b>next</b> <b>of</b> <b>kin.</b> Public debate ensued about these graves throughout the 1920s. British officials were concerned about families erecting their own memorials on the sites and detracting from the appearance of the cemeteries; critics complained about the secular nature of the memorials, the limited options for families to individualise the graves and the excessive role of the IWGC in determining how the soldiers were buried.|$|E

40|$|The term burnout, meaning ”professional exhaustion”, was {{introduced}} by Herbert Freudenberger in 1974. On May 21, 2014, the World Health Assembly, the decisional organ of the World Health Organization, voted the resolution for the integration {{and development of the}} capacity of palliative care services as a constituent part of the health systems. The resolution represents a major pace in the development of palliative care at world level, once the ministers responsible for the field took upon themselves - by means of information and training programs - the task of services’ development, mainly at community level, the support from the part <b>of</b> the <b>next</b> <b>of</b> <b>kins,</b> the elaboration <b>of</b> educational programs, of guides and clinical protocols for specialists, of instruments for the monitorization of the quality of services provided, an easier access of patients to medication, as well as partnerships with the civil society. Burnout is a state of emotional, mental and physical overfatigue caused by excessive and prolongued stress. It is installed mainly when the person affected with it feels care-worn and uncapable of fulfilling his/her usual duties. As the stress continues, he/she will come to lose the interest or motivation which made him/her assume a certain position in the organizational hierarchy. The burnout phenomenon includes three components: emotional exhaustion, depersonalization and lack of professional accomplishment. The main observations on the phenomenon indicate that, apparently, the burnout level in palliative care is not higher than in other services, such as intensive therapy or surgery. Nevertheless, mention should be made of a characteristic of the palliative care services which influences the burnout level, namely the emotional relation created between the patient and the medical team, {{as a result of the}} prolongued duration of the care service...|$|R

It is usually for the treating doctor to suggest clinical autopsy to the <b>next</b> <b>of</b> the <b>kin</b> in cases where they feel that the cause of death or the progression of disease was unclear.

Further the county of Hanau-Münzenberg was of Reformed Confession, Friedrich Casimir and the county of Hanau-Lichtenberg were Lutheran. And even to reach the capital of Hanau-Münzenberg, the town of Hanau, was a problem: Friedrich Casimir could do so only in disguise. The inheritance could finally be secured by a treaty of 1643 between Friedrich Casimir and Landgravine Amalie Elisabeth, née countess of Hanau-Münzenberg, daughter to Philipp II. She granted military and diplomatic support against the still resistend overlords.

40|$|A global {{shortage}} of organs from {{children and adults}} available for transplantation {{is compounded by the}} failure <b>of</b> <b>next</b> <b>of</b> the <b>kin</b> to consent for organs to be donated after death. There are both non-modifiable and modifiable factors which influence decision-making. Modifiable factors can though be influenced and are therefore of interest when examining families’ decision making surrounding the donation of organs from their deceased child. A scoping review was undertaken to determine how modifiable factors influence parental decision-making in cadaver organ donation. Following thematic analysis two themes were identified, these were ‘interaction with healthcare professionals’ and ‘pre-disposition to organ donation’. Satisfaction with experiences of hospital care, the information provided and the way it was communicated as well as interactions pertaining to emotional support were all found to be modifiable factors that influenced decision-making. Likewise, a predisposition to organ donation and knowing the wishes of the deceased, are highly associated with the consent decision.

(The families of those buried could pay afterwards to upgrade a third class grave to a higher class if they later wanted to erect a memorial, but this practice was rare.) Despite this, Brookwood's pauper graves granted more dignity to the deceased than did other graveyards and cemeteries of the period, all of which other than Brookwood continued the practice of mass graves for the poor.|$|E

40|$|Sir, An {{abnormal}} peak {{of mortality}} attributed to an unusually persisting heat wave (HW) {{has been recorded}} throughout Italy by the National Institute of Statistics (ISTAT) {{during the summer of}} 2015. During this time frame a group of patients with an initial diagnosis of severe sepsis or septic shock-related multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) were admitted to our ICU and treated accordingly; however, the subsequent clinical course indicated the MODS could have been ascribed more appropriately to a classic heat stroke (cHS). Regardless of the cause(s), any sustained increase of the body tempera-ture (BT) not matched by a concomitant heat loss can {{set the stage for the}} occurrence of cHS; the responsible mechanisms of both sepsis and cHS are similar and include the production and release of a number of pro-inflammatory cytokines in association with the activation of leuko-cytes and of the coagulative cascade. Despite these similitudes, the distinction between sepsis and cHS is of paramount importance as the therapeutic approaches of these conditionsdiffer substantially: whereas the prompt administration of broad-spectrum and not the abatement of fever is the cornerstone of the treatment of sepsis, in patients with cHS the rapid cooling of patients represents the main therapeutic goal. Overall, eight patients (4 M and 4 F, age 76 years, IQR 49 – 81 years) were diagnosed suffering from cHS in the considered period (Table 1). According to the information obtained from the <b>next</b> <b>of</b> <b>kins,</b> no patient had access to air conditioning in their homes. The diagnosis of cHS was established according to the criteria proposed by Bouchama et al., which include the alteration of mental status, the BT ≥ 40 °C and the presence of hot and dry skin. The neurologic impairment was evaluated with the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) both at hospital and at ICU admission and the severity of clinical conditions at ICU admission was measured with the SAPS II score; the individual burden of the concomitant chronic condition(s) and of the underlying frailties were evaluated with the Charlson's index and the CSHA Clinical Frailty Scale, respectively; this latter can be considered as an expression of theoverall functional reserve, and ranges from 1 (very fit) to 9 (approaching to the end of life which is expected within 6 months), with the intermediate scores indicating a progressive limitation of the everyday activities...|$|R
