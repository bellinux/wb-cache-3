25|$|The {{logic of}} this {{concession}} points irresistibly to {{the contention that}} the Thirteenth Amendment operates only to protect the African race. This {{is evident from the}} fact that <b>nowhere</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> record does it appear that the parties charged to have been wronged by the defendants had ever been themselves slaves, or were the descendants of slaves. They took no more from the Amendment than any other citizens of the United States. But if, as we have seen, that denounces a condition possible for all races and all individuals, then a like wrong perpetrated by white men upon a Chinese, or by black men upon a white man, or by any men upon any man on account of his race, would come within the jurisdiction of Congress, and that protection of individual rights which, prior to the Thirteenth Amendment, was unquestionably within the jurisdiction solely of the states, would, by virtue of that Amendment, be transferred to the nation, and subject to the legislation of Congress.|$|E
25|$|Tibullus's chief {{friend and}} patron was Marcus Valerius Messalla Corvinus, himself an orator and poet {{as well as}} a statesman and a commander. Messalla, like Gaius Maecenas, was at the centre of a {{literary}} circle in Rome. This circle had no relationship with the court, and the name of Augustus is found <b>nowhere</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> writings of Tibullus. About 30 BC Messalla was dispatched by Augustus to Gaul to quell a rising in Aquitania and restore order in the country, and Tibullus may have been in his retinue. On a later occasion, probably in 28, he would have accompanied his friend who had been sent on a mission to the East, but he fell sick and had to stay behind in Corcyra. Tibullus had no liking for war, and though his life seems to have been divided between Rome and his country estate, his own preferences were wholly for the country life.|$|E
25|$|There {{have been}} very few, short visual {{observations}} of right whale behavior in the North Pacific. The mid-19th century whaling onslaught occurred before there was much scientific interest in whale behavior, and included no scientific observation. By the time scientific interest in this species developed, very few whales remained and <b>nowhere</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> eastern North Pacific or Bering Sea could observers reliably find them. Based on limited observations in the 19th century, {{it was noted that}} the more extensively whaling was conducted, the more aggressive and harder to approach the whales became. These traits correspond with some of recent observations in which whales seemed to be very sensitive to vessels and easily swim away with by submerging longer to avoid ships enough for onlookers and observers to lose sights. Pre-World War I whaling logs from Japan also describe right whales as being among the most sensitive of targeted baleen or toothed species to the impacts of whaling, as they immediately fled from locations where whaling took place, possibly abandoning their habitat for good.|$|E

25|$|In December 1166, Alexander {{wrote to}} the English bishops that he was sending papal legates a latere to England to hear the various cases. Although later writers {{on both sides of}} the {{controversy}} claimed that there was to be no appeal from the legates' decisions, <b>nowhere</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> documents announcing their appointment was any such limitation mentioned. Alexander wrote two letters, one to each of the main combatants. The letter to the king stressed that the pope had forbidden the archbishop from escalating the dispute until the legates had decided the issues, and that the legates were to absolve the excommunicated once they arrived in England. The letter to the archbishop, however, stressed that the pope had begged the king to restore Becket to Canterbury, and instead of commanding Becket to refrain from further escalation, merely advised the archbishop to restrain himself from hostile moves. Meanwhile, John of Oxford had returned to England from a mission to Rome, and was proclaiming that the legates were to depose Becket, and supposedly showed papal letters confirming this to Foliot. The pope {{wrote to the}} papal legates complaining that John of Oxford's actions had harmed the pope's reputation, but never claimed that John of Oxford was lying.|$|E
500|$|Foreign {{travelers}} to China often made {{remarks on the}} economic strength of the country. The later Muslim Moroccan Berber traveler Ibn Batutta (13041377) wrote about many of his travel experiences in places across the Eurasian world, including China at the farthest eastern extremity. After describing lavish Chinese ships holding palatial cabins and saloons, along with the life of Chinese ship crews and captains, Batutta wrote: [...] "Among the inhabitants of China {{there are those who}} own numerous ships, on which they send their agents to foreign places. For <b>nowhere</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world are there to be found people richer than the Chinese".|$|E
500|$|Citing {{continuing}} {{divisions within}} the Democratic Party, the ongoing Cold War, and the boom and bust cycle, journalist Samuel Lubell in 1952 stated: [...] "After seven years of Truman's hectic, even furious, activity the nation seemed to be about on the same general spot as {{when he first came}} to office... <b>Nowhere</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> whole Truman record can one point to a single, decisive break-through... All his skills and energies—and he was among our hardest-working Presidents—were directed to standing still." [...] When he left office in 1953, Truman {{was one of the most}} unpopular chief executives in history. His job approval rating of 22% in the Gallup Poll of February 1952 was lower than Richard Nixon's 24% in August 1974, the month Nixon resigned, but matched by Nixon's all-time low in January 1974.|$|E

500|$|In 1990, Roderick Spencer and Selwyn Tillett {{discovered}} the ballet from Act II of Thespis. Two {{of the five}} movements, in the same hand that had copied the score of [...] "Climbing over rocky mountain", were found together with the surviving performance materials for Sullivan's 1864 ballet, L'Île Enchantée. Another section {{was found in the}} material for his 1897 ballet, Victoria and Merrie England. The page numbering of the surviving three sections gave approximate lengths for the missing pieces, and a contemporary engraving, seen at left, along with other circumstantial evidence, allowed plausible identifications of the two remaining movements: a dragon costume, used <b>nowhere</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> libretto, is presumably from the ballet, and the harp visible in the orchestra pit was an unusual instrument for the Gaiety's orchestra. Movements of appropriate length that made sense of these oddities were found in Sullivan's other ballets, and the reconstructed ballet has been recorded twice on CD.|$|E
500|$|Balthier was {{designed}} by Akihiko Yoshida, who has stated that the character is his favorite from Final Fantasy XII since the character is based on [...] "someone I admire." [...] Balthier {{has been called a}} [...] "completely original character" [...] by Yoshida, having not used any previous Final Fantasy character as a reference. [...] In an interview, Yoshida stated that all the characters of Final Fantasy XII were designed with a focus on creating an aesthetic found <b>nowhere</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> real world. The armor of the Judges, which Balthier had been, were designed as a combination of historical armor, mountain bike gear, and futuristic ideas. During the making of the game, there were some issues with the character's faces; In one scene Balthier asked Vaan how he was feeling which brought laughter to the staff because in that scene Vaan's face was poorly modelled. In retrospective, Square Enix members found Balthier as an appealing character and jokingly stated Vaan would need an entire decade to surpass him.|$|E
500|$|A false {{translation}} of the text – affirming, among other things, {{the abolition of slavery}} and the right to self-determination, a minimum wage and asylum – has been promoted on the Internet and elsewhere. As well as making claims that are not found on the real cylinder, it refers to the Zoroastrian divinity Ahura Mazda rather than the Mesopotamian god Marduk. The false translation has been widely circulated; alluding to its claim that Cyrus supposedly has stated that [...] "Every country shall decide for itself whether or not it wants my leadership." [...] Iranian Nobel Peace Prize winner Shirin Ebadi in her acceptance speech described Cyrus as [...] "the very emperor who proclaimed at the pinnacle of power 2,500 years ago that … he would not reign over the people if they did not wish it". Similarly, in a 2006 speech, United States President George W. Bush referred to Cyrus, declaring that his people had [...] "the right to worship God in freedom" [...] – a statement made <b>nowhere</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> text of the Cylinder.|$|E

500|$|Their {{relationship}} was further embittered by Speer's failure to mention Wolters by name in Speer's first book {{based on the}} Spandau material, Inside the Third Reich. [...] Speer's initial draft of the book, written while in Spandau, does mention his [...] "old university friend, Dr. Rudolf Wolters, to whom was assigned the most essential task, the Prachtstrasse" [...] {{in connection with the}} Berlin project. [...] However, Wolters' name appears <b>nowhere</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> published version, and no mention is made of Wolters' help, essential to the writing and preservation of the draft memoir. [...] Speer later told his future biographer, Gitta Sereny, that he did so to protect Wolters, since it might have been risky for Wolters to have been known to have assisted an imprisoned war criminal. [...] Sereny notes in her biography of Speer that {{it would not have been}} in Speer's interest to have publicized Wolter's assistance, given the growing disagreement between them over Speer's statements. [...] Wolter's son, Fritz, suggested that had Speer mentioned Wolters even once, [...] "it would have made all the difference", since it would have shown that Speer acknowledged the debt he owed Wolters for his efforts during his incarceration.|$|E
500|$|Folklorists Iona and Peter Opie {{observe that}} [...] "the tale {{is unusual in}} that the hero little deserves his good fortune, that is if his poverty, his being a third child, and his unquestioning {{acceptance}} of the cat's sinful instructions, are not nowadays looked upon as virtues." [...] The cat should be acclaimed the prince of 'con' artists, they declare, as few swindlers have been so successful before or since. The success of Histoires is attributed to seemingly contradictory and incompatible reasons. While the literary skill employed in the telling of the tales has been recognized universally, it appears the tales were set down in great part as the author heard them told. The evidence for that assessment lies first in {{the simplicity of the}} tales, then in the use of words that were, in Perrault's era, considered populaire and du bas peuple, and finally, in the appearance of vestigial passages that now are superfluous to the plot, do not illuminate the narrative, and thus, are passages the Opies believe a literary artist would have rejected in the process of creating a work of art. One such vestigial passage is Puss's boots; his insistence upon the footwear is explained <b>nowhere</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tale, it is not developed, nor is it referred to after its first mention except in an aside.|$|E
