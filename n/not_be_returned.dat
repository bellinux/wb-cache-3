5|$|Charles II was crowned at Scone Palace on 1 January 1651, {{at which}} the Honours of Scotland (the regalia of crown, sword and sceptre) were used. However, with Cromwell's troops in Lothian, the honours could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>returned</b> to Edinburgh. The Earl Marischal, as Marischal of Scotland, had formal {{responsibility}} for the honours, and in June the Privy Council duly decided to place them at Dunnottar. They {{were brought to the}} castle by Katherine Drummond, hidden in sacks of wool. Sir George Ogilvie (or Ogilvy) of Barras was appointed lieutenant-governor of the castle, and given responsibility for its defence.|$|E
5|$|In Sweden, as of 2007 {{there are}} ten {{operating}} nuclear reactors that produce about 45% of its electricity. Two other reactors in Barsebäck {{were shut down}} in 1999 and 2005. When these reactors were built, it was expected their nuclear fuel would be reprocessed in a foreign country, and the reprocessing waste would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>returned</b> to Sweden. Later, construction of a domestic reprocessing plant was contemplated, but has not been built.|$|E

5|$|Rear Admiral Sir Alexander Cochrane {{raised the}} first Corps of Colonial Marines in 1808 while {{commander-in-chief}} of British naval {{forces on the}} Leeward Islands station during the Napoleonic Wars. The British had captured the island of Marie Galante earlier that year, but the French governor of Guadeloupe attacked the island on hearing that illness had weakened its British garrison. Marie Galante slaves assisted the British when promised that they would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>returned</b> to their proprietors; by this means, the island was preserved under British control until the arrival of three companies of the 1st West India Regiment.|$|E
5|$|Another {{tradition}} {{says that}} the Black Stone was originally an angel that had been placed by God in the Garden of Eden to guard Adam. The angel was absent when Adam ate the forbidden fruit and was punished by being turned into a jewel — the Black Stone. God granted it the power of speech and placed it {{at the top of}} Abu Qubays, a mountain in the historic region of Khurasan, before moving the mountain to Mecca. When Ibrahim took the Black Stone from Abu Qubays to build the Kaaba, the mountain asked Ibrahim to intercede with God so that it would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>returned</b> to Khurasan and would stay in Mecca.|$|E
5|$|During {{the course}} of the battle, two of Von der Tanns main turrets were knocked out by British gunfire, while her other two turrets {{suffered}} mechanical failures. The ship was firing so fast that several of the main guns in the amidships turrets became overheated and jammed in their recoil slides, and could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>returned</b> to working order. Von der Tann was without her main battery for 11hours, although three turrets were restored to working order {{before the end of the}} battle; Dturret only after much cutting away of bent metal with oxyacetylene torches—afterwards the guns could be worked only by hand. Her casualties amounted to 11 dead and 35 wounded. During the battle Von der Tann fired 170 heavy shells and 98 secondary caliber shells.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the end of}} the war, the 12th Light Horse Regiment {{remained}} in the Middle East for a number of months, during which time, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Phillip Chambers, they were used to suppress the 1919 Egyptian Uprising. During the uprising, the 12th carried out security operations to protect infrastructure in the Ismailia area. As the situation was resolved, the regiment handed back its stores and equipment in preparation for repatriation back to Australia and most of their horses were transferred to the Australian Remount Depot at Moascar. Due to concerns about costs, availability of shipping and quarantine restrictions, the decision was made that the horses would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>returned</b> to Australia, but that they would be sold to the British Indian Army for further service, or to local Egyptians. According to Hollis, though, many were also put down by the troopers due to concerns they might be mistreated.|$|E
5|$|Still {{eligible}} for junior, Brulé made the Blue Jackets' roster for the 2006–07 season. A month into the campaign, he was assured by General Manager Doug MacLean {{that he would}} <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>returned</b> to the Giants {{as he had been}} the previous season. He was scratched several times under head coach Gerard Gallant, but after Gallant was replaced by Ken Hitchcock in late-November, he began receiving more playing time. Playing mostly on the fourth line in his rookie season, he averaged 10minutes of ice time per game. He went on to tally 19points (9goals and 10assists) over 78games in his first full NHL season.|$|E
5|$|The {{hospital}} retired the radiotherapy unit in 1994 {{and acquired}} {{a new one}} from Nordion via its Thai agent Kamol Sukosol Electric Company (KSE). The old unit and its 60Co source could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>returned</b> either to its original German manufacturer Siemens, which had stopped producing or servicing them, or to the Canadian supplier Nordion, which was not the original manufacturer. Consequently, the hospital sold the old unit to KSE, which already had another licensed unit in storage. However, neither the hospital nor KSE informed the OAEP of the transfer. In 1996 an OAEP inspection found that KSE had three unlicensed units in its warehouse, which had been licensed for the storage of a single unit in 1988.|$|E

5|$|Joining the Blue Jackets' {{training}} camp {{for a second}} year, Johansen made the opening line-up for the 2011–12 season. He made his NHL debut on October 7, 2011, registering 8 minutes and 46 seconds of ice time in a 3–2 loss to the Nashville Predators. He registered his first NHL point, an assist on a Kris Russell goal, in a 4–3 loss to the Ottawa Senators on October 22. Three days later, he scored his first NHL goal against Ty Conklin of the Detroit Red Wings. Banking the puck off of Conklin's skate from behind the goal line, the milestone came on the power play and was the game-winner. He also added an assist to help Columbus to their first win of the season, a 4–1 victory. After playing in his ninth game of the season, having recorded two goals and two assists in that span, Johansen was notified by Blue Jackets head coach Scott Arniel that he would remain with the team and <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>returned</b> to junior.|$|E

Also, Armando Gutierrez, a local Cuban American businessman, became a spokesman. At the same time, Juan Miguel, with the support of Cuban authorities, demanded that his son be returned to Cuba.|$|E
25|$|Attorney General Janet Reno {{ordered the}} return of Elián González to his father and set a {{deadline}} of April 13, 2000, but the Miami relatives defied the order.

Negotiations carried on throughout the night, but Reno claimed that the relatives rejected all workable solutions.|$|E
25|$|In March 2013, Cuccinelli's {{role in a}} tax dispute case {{came into}} {{question}} when media reported on a lawsuit between the state of Virginia and Star Scientific, a nutritional supplements company. The Washington Post reported that Cuccinelli had failed to disclose investments in Star Scientific for a year; after realizing the oversight, he corrected it and disclosed the holdings. Cuccinelli has disclosed $18,000 in gifts from Star Scientific's chief executive, Jonnie R. Williams.

25|$|On February 12, 2006 Deutsche Welle {{reported}} that German authorities were negotiating Kurnaz's repatriation. The German magazine Focus reported in 2006 that the Bush administration {{was trying to}} tie the release of Kurnaz to Germany's agreeing to accept four other Guantanamo detainees. The USA had cleared approximately 120 detainees for release or transfer. But many could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>returned</b> to their countries of origin. The German and American governments denied that Kurnaz's release had been tied to Germany accepting other detainees. Focus {{reported that}} the German government has agreed to accept one other detainee, not four. It said that the US had not informed the German government of {{the identities of the}} other detainees it wanted them to accept.|$|E
25|$|In FY 2009, Mexican courts {{continued}} to demonstrate patterns of delay in processing applications under the Convention, {{as illustrated by}} several of the cases listed under Mexico in the “Unresolved Return Applications” section of this report. In at least two instances, six months elapsed between the time the case was assigned to a court and {{the date of the}} first hearing; in another, seven months elapsed. In five other cases, it took between 16 and 55 months before the court held the first hearing on the application for return. These delays disadvantaged LBPs and led to rulings that the children should <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>returned</b> because they had become “settled” in their new environment, an exception to return listed in Article 12 of the Convention.|$|E
25|$|All the while, Ben-Ami {{was desperately}} trying to pacify the British {{authorities}} and promise them that Yishuv {{would do anything to}} find the hostages. However, after his conversation with Netanya council members of the Revisionist party, he published an announcement in a newspaper saying that he had been told by Irgun that the hostages would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>returned</b> until the condemned Irgun members' fate was made clear. Subsequently, the British Army placed a cordon around Netanya and the surrounding area of Emek Hefer, which had 20 outlying settlements, a total area of 15,000 people, and on July 13, began an extensive search effort, codenamed Operation Tiger, to find the sergeants. The area was placed under martial law as 5,000 British troops conducted searches and questioned residents. A total of 1,427 people were interrogated during the operation. Local residents were kept under curfew, and Netanya became a virtual ghost town; its streets were empty save for patrolling British soldiers and armored vehicles.|$|E
