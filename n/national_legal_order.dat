While founded on the basis of an international treaty, the European Community still had to determine – not unlike <b>national</b> <b>legal</b> <b>orders</b> – the effects of public international law in its ‘domestic’ sphere.

40|$|In this essay, I seek to {{make the}} best {{argument}} for the claim that the European Court of Human Rights is a constitutional court. 1 The scope of the Court’s authority is comparable to that of national constitutional and supreme courts; and it is, today well positioned to exercise decisive influence on the development of a rights-based, pan-European constitutionalism (I. A). Further, judges in Strasbourg confront the same kinds of problems that their counterparts on national constitutional courts do; and they use similar techniques and methodologies to address these problems (I. B). Finally, I will argue that the European Convention of Human Rights [ECHR] has been constitutionalised by the combined effects of the entry into force of Protocol No. 11, and the incorporation of the Convention into <b>national</b> <b>legal</b> <b>orders</b> (II. A). Today, the Court’s basic constitutional task – its existential problem – is to manage the complex system of constitutional pluralism that has emerged. At the same time, the constitutionalisation of the Convention exacerbates the pluralism that already exists in many <b>national</b> <b>legal</b> <b>orders</b> (II. B). Far from being an oxymoron, “constitutional pluralism” describes a normal state of affairs in Europe...|$|R

50|$|Ideas {{of natural}} law are also {{excluded}} by Kelsen's rejection of 'metaphysics' in a strong sense, supposing something supra-human. He similarly rejects duplication in ideas of 'the state' as a supra-human entity - rather than a mere, fictional personification of the <b>national</b> <b>legal</b> <b>order.</b> His main target, in the 1930s, was fascist theories of state and law, {{such as that of}} Carl Schmitt. But, for Kelsen, it is also an illusion to think that, in a Rechtsstaat (roughly, 'rule of law state'), 'the state' is wholly subject to law: from a 'legal point of view', the state and the positive-legal order are the same. It is likewise an illusion to think of a 'legal person', whether relating in fact to a number of real people or to a single real individual, as anything other than a fictional personification of a bundle of norms that are rights and duties pertaining to such people. This is simply so, however, only in the 'pure part' of legal science. Kelsen is perfectly well aware that, in the empirical part, 'the state' {{will turn out to be}} a heavily armed real apparatus. One can make a similar extrapolation for the reality of legal persons, where corporate legal persons would turn out to be organisations and individual legal persons to have gender, class, ethnicity and so on.|$|E
5000|$|In Cases E-15/15 and 16/15, Vienna Life and Swiss Life, the Court {{ruled on}} the {{interpretation}} of Directive 2002/83/EC concerning life assurance. It held that Article 36(1) of the Directive does not address legal transactions according to which an existing unit-linked life assurance policy is transferred via a purchase agreement {{from one person to}} another where the insured risk, namely the insured person, under the assurance policy remains the same. Furthermore, a transfer of a unit-linked life assurance policy does not constitute a change in the policy conditions under Article 36(2) unless the terms of an assurance policy are also amended, thereby altering the balance of rights and obligations of the parties to an assurance contract. With regard to the referring court’s further questions on specific information duties under the Directive, the Court found, first, that if a “change in the policy conditions” within the meaning of the Directive has taken place, the referring court needs to consider whether the information listed in Annex III(B)(b)(2) was provided to the second-hand policy holder in a clear, accurate and complete manner and in an official language of the EEA State of commitment. Second, it is of no significance for the information obligation of the assurance undertaking whether the former policy holder was an undertaking and the new policy holder is a consumer, unless this difference has led to an amendment to the terms of the assurance contract. Neither is it of significance whether or not the original policy holder disclosed information about himself so that his own risk or investor profile could be assessed. As to the referring court’s question whether Annex III to the Directive has been correctly transposed into Liechtenstein law, the Court held that directives must be implemented into the <b>national</b> <b>legal</b> <b>order</b> of the EEA States with unquestionable binding force and the specificity, precision and clarity necessary to satisfy the requirements of legal certainty. Furthermore, national courts are bound to interpret national law in conformity with EEA law. Under Article 34 SCA, the Court has jurisdiction to give advisory opinions on {{the interpretation of}} the EEA Agreement upon the request of national courts. After the Court has rendered its judgment, it falls to the referring court to interpret national law in light of the Court’s findings. In cases where a harmonious interpretation of national law is not sufficient to achieve the result sought by the relevant EEA rule, that matter can be brought before the Court under the procedure prescribed by Article 31 SCA.|$|E

40|$|The rapid {{expansion}} of European contract law {{in the field of}} consumer financial services gives rise to the question to what extent it is self-sufficient.

40|$|This article assesses how, 50 {{years after}} the ECJ {{delivered}} its judgment in Van Gend en Loos (VGL), the doctrine of direct effect of international law has fared outside the European Union.

Against the background of an exceedingly heterogeneous practice, this article argues that the concept of direct effect is characterized by a fundamental duality. Direct effect may function as a powerful sword that courts can use to pierce the boundary of the <b>national</b> <b>legal</b> <b>order</b> and protect individual rights where national law falls short. But more often than not, the conditions of direct effect legitimize the non-application of international law and shield the <b>national</b> <b>legal</b> <b>order</b> from international law.

40|$|The {{article focuses}} on the {{constitutional}} linkages between <b>national</b> <b>legal</b> <b>orders,</b> the EU <b>legal</b> <b>order,</b> and the ECHR Convention system. The first, and the main, question the article addresses is how these intertwined constitutional structures can be described. This article shows that the interrelationship of these <b>legal</b> <b>orders</b> could be best described as heterarchical as opposed to hierarchical. The article also tries to tentatively examine the meaning and influence of these heterarchical constitutional structures. The concept of heterarchy is used to illustrate the tension between constitutionalism and pluralism. Where constitutionalism builds a pre-set foundation and framework for governance, pluralism challenges hierarchical constitutional structures and highlights tension at the interfaces between different <b>legal</b> <b>orders.</b> The concept of heterarchical constitutional structures is used to describe those structures pertaining between <b>legal</b> <b>orders</b> which enable those <b>legal</b> <b>orders</b> to flexibly function together without predetermining any hierarchical relation between the orders.

His lecture focuses on the preliminary ruling procedure of Article 267 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. This procedure gives every national court the power – and even imposes an obligation on some courts – to refer preliminary questions concerning the interpretation of European law and the validity of the acts of EU institutions to the Court of Justice of the European Union. This procedure is a vital and successful dialogue between national courts and the Court of Justice – one beset by old problems and facing new challenges. The author looks more closely at the preliminary ruling procedure and its functioning. What factors affect the success of this dialogue? And how can we ensure that it continues to be successful? More specifically, Professor Jurian Langer examines the opportunities for national courts and the Court of Justice – within the current parameters of the European treaties – to influence the dialogue and to continue successful cooperation. The author argues that if the main actors involved continue to shoulder their shared responsibility underlying the procedure, it {{will continue to be a}} success. In this context, his lecture suggests, among other things, an increased 'European' role for the highest national courts by relaxing the CILFIT-criteria, an increased use of Article 101 of the Rules of Procedure as well as a stricter admissibility rule regarding references in relation to internal situations.

40|$|This {{contribution}} {{seeks to}} shed new light onto {{the classification of}} legal orders {{with respect to the}} domestic effect of international law. Traditional theory distinguishes between monist and dualist systems, those that accept the primacy of international law over domestic law, and those that do not attribute direct effect to international law in the domestic legal order. We will examine three different lines of constitutional jurisprudence on the effect of decisions of international authorities in the domestic order. It is maintained that all courts dealing with the domestic effect of international secondary law ultimately face questions of legitimacy of the external decisionmaking procedure. We will identify three strategies to cope with this challenge and argue that it is more appropriate to consider the relationship of a <b>national</b> <b>legal</b> <b>order</b> to international law through the prism of how its constitutional court approaches the governance issue than to refer to the traditional monism-dualism-dichotomy. ...|$|E

40|$|International {{criminal}} courts do {{not operate}} {{to the exclusion of}} <b>national</b> <b>legal</b> <b>orders,</b> but co-exist with them. The present thesis provides an in-depth analysis of the above relationship. By examining the concepts of primacy and complementarity on the basis of which the ad hoc international criminal Tribunals and the permanent International Criminal Court seize jurisdiction, the foundations of the interface are explored. As effectiveness is a key concept to international criminal justice, the relationship between international criminal courts and <b>national</b> <b>legal</b> systems is tested, by examining the co-operation regimes envisaged in the Statutes of both the Tribunals and the ICC, as well as the problems that arise in practice. Moreover, the way the UN Security Council affects State interplay with international criminal justice institutions is crucial for a holistic understanding of the limitations of the interaction. The final part of the thesis focuses on national incorporation efforts and provides a detailed analysis of implementing legislation of a number of key States with a view to discerning some common approaches and highlighting problem areas. The present thesis argues that despite the different constitutional bases of the Tribunals and the ICC, similar questions of interface with national courts arise and the challenges presented could be better tackled by aiming for a "functional or workable interaction". Overall, the originality of this thesis lies in its analytical approach. By scrutinising a number of crucial aspects of the relationship between international criminal courts and <b>national</b> <b>legal</b> <b>orders</b> an overview of the research question posed is achieved. Moreover, the examination of the legal principles and their practical application is complemented by a comprehensive discussion of national implementing legislation which has not previously been attempted in a similar manner.
