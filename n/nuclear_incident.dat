2500|$|Canada – On 16 March 2011, {{five days}} after the Fukushima I <b>nuclear</b> <b>incident</b> began, {{it was found that the}} Pickering Nuclear Generating Station in Pickering, Ontario, {{situated}} east of Toronto, was leaking demineralized water into Lake Ontario. While the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission declared that the leak, caused by a pump seal failure, did not pose any threat to human health, many Canadians questioned the safety of nuclear power plants in Canada. Gordon Edwards, Canadian physicist and founder of the Canadian Coalition for Nuclear Responsibility, claimed that the leak [...] "shows the potential for more significant nuclear contamination of Lake Ontario [...] ". He added that the source of the Pickering plant's leak was the same as that of the incident at Fukushima I and that the leak must not be taken lightly. The Gentilly Nuclear Generating Station near Bécancour, Quebec, is the only Canadian nuclear power plant near a fault line. Quebec Premier Jean Charest issued statements that the Gentilly-2 reactor was safe, and the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission declared it could withstand earthquakes.|$|E
2500|$|According to the Israeli {{newspaper}} Haaretz, in September 2010 {{experts on}} Iran and computer security specialists were increasingly convinced that Stuxnet was meant [...] "to sabotage the uranium enrichment facility at Natanz – where the centrifuge operational capacity had dropped {{over the past}} year by 30 percent." [...] On 23 November 2010 it was announced that uranium enrichment at Natanz had ceased several times because of a series of major technical problems. A [...] "serious nuclear accident" [...] (supposedly the shutdown of some of its centrifuges) occurred at the site {{in the first half of}} 2009, which is speculated to have forced the head of Iran's Atomic Energy Organization Gholam Reza Aghazadeh to resign. Statistics published by the Federation of American Scientists (FAS) show that the number of enrichment centrifuges operational in Iran mysteriously declined from about 4,700 to about 3,900 beginning around the time the <b>nuclear</b> <b>incident</b> WikiLeaks mentioned would have occurred. The Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) suggests, in a report published in December 2010, that Stuxnet is a reasonable explanation for the apparent damage at Natanz, and may have destroyed up to 1,000 centrifuges (10 percent) sometime between November 2009 and late January 2010.

2500|$|The Fukushima {{disaster}} was {{the most}} significant <b>nuclear</b> <b>incident</b> since the April 26, 1986 Chernobyl disaster and the second disaster {{to be given the}} Level 7 event classification of the International Nuclear Event Scale. Though there have been no fatalities linked to radiation due to the accident, the eventual number of cancer deaths, according to the linear no-threshold theory of radiation safety, that will be caused by the accident is expected to be around 130–640 people in the years and decades ahead. The United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation and World Health Organization report {{that there will be no}} increase in miscarriages, stillbirths or physical and mental disorders in babies born after the accident. However, an estimated 1,600 deaths are believed to have occurred due to the resultant evacuation conditions. There are no clear plans for decommissioning the plant, but the plant management estimate is 30 or 40 years. A frozen soil barrier has been constructed in an attempt to prevent further contamination of seeping groundwater, but in July 2016 TEPCO revealed that the ice wall had failed to stop groundwater from flowing in and mixing with highly radioactive water inside the wrecked reactor buildings, adding that they are [...] "technically incapable of blocking off groundwater with the frozen wall".|$|E

Since {{some of these}} incidents and accidents caused by human errors might be preventable, numerous researchers argue that fatigue management for on-site workers is the key, especially for mental fatigue. Thus, this study proposes an approach consisting of two mechanisms. A fatigue monitor could identify the mentally fatigued workers by detecting their brain wave rhythms through a brain-computer interface. For such workers, a fatigue alert would awaken them. If {{the status of the}} mentally fatigued workers becomes worse, based on a positioning technique (i. e., wireless networks), this mechanism would alert the nearby workers and managers to deal with this condition. The test results indicate that the proposed approach enhanced the capacity to examine the mentally fatigued workers, ensured the accuracy in locating these workers, and avoided possible <b>nuclear</b> <b>incidents.</b> This study is a useful reference for similar applications in the nuclear industry...|$|R
