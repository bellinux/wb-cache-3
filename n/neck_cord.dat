5000|$|Ultrasound {{diagnosis}} of a <b>cord</b> around the <b>neck</b> was first described in 1982. [...] “Coils occur in about 25% of cases and ordinarily do no harm, but occasionally they may be so tight that constriction of the umbilical vessels and consequent hypoxia result.” Williams Obstetrics 16th Edition, has only one single sentence in the entire textbook regarding cords around the neck:(P.421) By contrast, the First Edition of the Encyclopædia Britannica from 1770 had 20 pages of information about Umbilical Cord Pathology with drawings of Umbilical Cord Entanglement. The Royal College of OBGYN has these images on its brochure. There are currently three recent texts on Ultrasonography which demonstrate the ability of ultrasound to identify umbilical cord issues with reliability as of 2009.A study published in 2004 was done to establish the sensitivity of ultrasound in the {{diagnosis of}} a nuchal cord. Each of 289 women, induced the same day, underwent a transabdominal ultrasound scan with an Aloka 1700 ultrasound machine with a 3.5 MHz abdominal probe, using gray-scale and color Doppler imaging immediately prior to induction of labor. Presence of the cord was sought in the transverse and sagittal plane of the <b>neck.</b> A nuchal <b>cord</b> was diagnosed if the cord was visualized lying around at least 3 of the 4 sides of the <b>neck.</b> A <b>cord</b> was actually present at delivery in 52 of the 289 women. Only 18 of the 52 cords or 35% of the nuchal cords were detected on ultrasound done immediately before delivery, and 65% of nuchal cords were not detected. Of the 237 cases {{where there was no}} cord at delivery, ultrasound had false positive results, i.e. diagnosed a cord in 44 of the 237 cases (19%) in which there was no cord present at all. In this study, ultrasound was only 35% accurate at finding a single loop, and only 60% accurate at detecting a nuchal cord wrapped multiple times around the neck.|$|R

And though he sat there, blushing and humble, again she felt drawn to him. She was surprised by a wanton thought that rushed into her mind. It seemed to her that if she could lay her two hands upon that neck that all its strength and vigor would flow out to her. She was shocked by this thought. It seemed to reveal to her an undreamed depravity in her nature. Besides, strength to her was a gross and brutish thing. Her ideal of masculine beauty had always been slender gracefulness. Yet the thought still persisted. It bewildered her that she should desire to place her hands on that sunburned neck. In truth, she was far from robust, and the need of her body and mind was for strength. But she did not know it. She knew only that no man had ever affected her before as this one had, who shocked her from moment to moment with his awful grammar.|$|R
50|$|When cougars do attack, {{they usually}} employ their {{characteristic}} neck bite, attempting to position their teeth between the vertebrae {{and into the}} spinal <b>cord.</b> <b>Neck,</b> head, and spinal injuries are common and sometimes fatal. Children are at greatest risk of attack, and least likely to survive an encounter. Detailed research into attacks prior to 1991 showed that 64% of all victims - and almost all fatalities - were children. The same study showed the highest proportion of attacks to have occurred in British Columbia, particularly on Vancouver Island where cougar populations are especially dense. Preceding attacks on humans, cougars display aberrant behavior, such as activity during daylight hours, a lack of fear of humans, and stalking humans. There have sometimes been incidents of pet cougars mauling people.|$|R
40|$|Spontaneous {{subluxation}} of the cervical spine {{is a well}} recognised and {{not uncommon}} complication of rheumatoid arthritis. It can occur at the atlanto-axial level and the clinical features were described by Sharp and Purser (1961) and by Robinson (1966). Conlon, Isdale and Rose (I 966) found a 25 per cent incidence of atlanto-axial subluxation in 337 consecutive hospital admissions for rheumatoid arthritis, and the same incidence was found by Mathews (1969) in a tomographic study. Subluxations, which are often serial, also occur at lower levels in the cervical spine (Sharp, Purser and Lawrence 1958; Bland, Davis, London, van Buskirk and Duarte 1963). Many of these patients are free from symptoms, or complain only of increasing pain in the <b>neck,</b> but <b>cord</b> pressure with tetraplegia can ensue (Hopkins 1967).

50|$|Patients {{receiving}} prolotherapy injections {{have reported}} generally mild side effects, including mild pain and irritation at the injection site (often within 72 {{hours of the}} injection), numbness at the injection site, or mild bleeding. Pain from prolotherapy injections is temporary and is often treated with acetaminophen or, in rare cases, opioid medications. NSAIDs are not usually recommended due to their counter action to prolotherapy-induced inflammation, but are occasionally used in patients with pain refractory to other methods of pain control. Theoretical adverse events of prolotherapy injection include lightheadedness, allergic reactions to the agent used, bruising, infection, or nerve damage. Allergic reactions to sodium morrhuate are rare. Rare cases of back pain, <b>neck</b> pain, spinal <b>cord</b> irritation, pneumothorax, and disc injury have been reported at a rate {{comparable to that of}} other spinal injection procedures.|$|R

50|$|A {{small number}} of bullae made of base metal (usually lead, but also tin), or rarely clay, covered with a folded over piece of gold foil, {{have been found in}} Ireland dating to the Late Bronze Age. They were presumably worn {{suspended}} round the <b>neck</b> with a <b>cord</b> running through the hole below the flat top. The body of the bulla has roughly vertical sides before making a semi-circle or inverted pointed arch at the bottom. The gold is incised with geometrical decoration. The type of object was named for its resemblance to the Roman form. Irish bullae are dated between about 1150 BC - 750 BC. Whether they were purely for adornment or had an amuletic or other function is unclear. Despite the small weight of gold used they would have been only available for elite groups.|$|R
5000|$|A {{pectoral}} cross or pectorale (from the Latin pectoralis, [...] "of the chest") is a {{cross that}} is worn on the chest, usually {{suspended from the}} <b>neck</b> by a <b>cord</b> or chain.

[...] The modern pectoral cross is relatively large, and is different from the small crosses worn on necklaces by many Christians. Most pectoral crosses are made of precious metals (platinum, gold or silver) and some contain precious or semi-precious gems. Some contain a corpus like a crucifix while others use stylized designs and religious symbols.|$|R

40|$|Background: Given that tremor {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{prevalent}} and disabling features of multiple sclerosis (MS), we will review the most significant milestones in tremor in this disease in recent years, focusing on prevalence, clinical features, anatomical basis, and treatment. Methods: Data for this review were identified by searching MEDLINE with the search terms "multiple sclerosis" and "tremor". References were also identified from relevant articles published between January 1966 and May 2012. Results: The predominant type of MS tremor is a large-amplitude, postural, and kinetic tremor, which most commonly affects the arms, although tremor can also involve head, <b>neck,</b> vocal <b>cords,</b> and trunk. Involvement of the tongue, jaw, or palate has not been reported. Although the anatomical basis underlying tremor in MS is poorly understood, the link between the cerebellum and the MS-related tremor is supported by clinical and experimental studies. Currently available medication is often unsuccessful in most cases. Surgical treatment can be a satisfactory alternative to treat severe and disabling tremor. Discussion: Tremor in MS patients could be considered as an advanced consequence of the disease and its presence suggests a more aggressive course. MS tremor can be severe and very disabling for a small group of patients. Treatment of MS tremor remains a great challenge. Recent studies suggest that dissociating tremor from cerebellar dysfunction using selected clinical tests would be the key issue to successful surgical treatment. Understanding the pathophysiology and biochemistry of tremor production in MS may lead to new therapeutic approaches...|$|R
50|$|Management of a {{presenting}} nuchal cord {{should be}} tailored to prevent umbilical cord compression whenever possible. Techniques to preserve an intact nuchal cord depend on how tightly the cord is wrapped around the infant’s <b>neck.</b> If the <b>cord</b> is loose, it can easily be slipped over the infant’s head. The infant can be delivered normally and placed on maternal abdomen as desired. If the cord is too tight {{to go over the}} infant’s head, the provider may be able to slip it over the infant’s shoulders and deliver the body through the cord. The cord can then be unwrapped from around the baby after birth. Finally, if the cord is too tight to slip back over the shoulders, one may use the somersault maneuver to allow the body to be delivered. The birth attendant may also choose to clamp and cut the umbilical cord to allow for vaginal delivery if other methods of nuchal cord management are not feasible.|$|R
50|$|The tumdak is a hand-struck double-headed membranophone of the Santal {{people of}} India. The Santal {{typically}} use the Tumdak {{in combination with}} the Tamah for religious ceremonies and Santal festivals. Both drums are almost universally played by men rather than women. The body of the drum is cylindrical and made from clay. The two heads of the drum are usually cowhide, the right one being slightly smaller than the left. Like many similar Indian drums, each head has a round patch of tuning paste in the center which enhances the sound. When played for dancing, the Tumdah player suspends the drum around his <b>neck</b> with a <b>cord</b> or leather strap. The Tumdah falls within the larger category of double-headed hand-struck Indian drums, which have various names: Dholak, Nal, Mridangam. The player strikes the Tumdak with full hand and fingers as required by the musical pattern. The rhythm of the Tamak and Tumdak set the basic metric/rhythmic pattern for Santal dances and are essential for traditional Santal music.|$|R
