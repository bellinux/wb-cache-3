The NSCA <b>Noise</b> <b>Committee</b> was formed in 1986, in particular in response to increasing concerns about the poor quality of sound insulation in flat conversions - and the committee undertook a survey and reported on the problem. This influenced the development of sound legislation regulation.

40|$|How do {{noise and}} bribery affect the {{accuracy}} of collective decision rules? This paper presents simulation results that measure {{the accuracy of}} ten well known collective decision rules under noise and bribery. When noise is low these rules {{can be divided into}} accurate ("good") and inaccurate ("bad") groups. The bad rules ' accuracy improves, sometimes significantly, when noise increases while the good rules ' performance steadily worsens with noise. Also, when noise increases the accuracy of the good rules deteriorates at different rates. Bribery delays the effects of noise: accuracy improvement and deterioration due to noise emerge only at higher noise levels with bribery than without it. In some cases at high noise levels there is only a negligible difference between the accuracy of good and bad collective decision rules. The Problem Let us assume that a committee has to rank candidates. Suppose that there exists an objective ranking of the candidates but because of human error (later: system noise or <b>noise)</b> <b>committee</b> members ’ perceptions about th...|$|E

5000|$|During he 1960s, {{the regular}} {{scheduled}} services were restored, initially national flights operated by NLM. The airfield {{was seen to}} {{have the potential to}} operate usefully as a regional airport and it could {{play a role in the}} infrastructure of northern part of the Netherlands. The [...] "Study Committee for the Development of Eelde Airport" [...] is established. The committee suggests that there should be taken a closer look to regional airports in other countries and see how they have developed. Eelde airport seemed to be a key part of a larger system of infrastructure in the region. Another finding was that aircraft noise is a bigger problem at Eelde than at similar airports.

40|$|This {{research}} aims at {{examining the}} impact of audit committees on earnings quality. The study is motivated by the controversy of previous studies about performance of audit committee. Earnings quality is measured by Earnings Responsse Coefficient (ERC). Sample of the study consists of 97 manufacturing companies listed on the Jakarta Stock Exchange. Data is collected using purposive sampling method. The ERC is estimated using pooled cross-sectional coefficient method (CRSM) and firm specific coefficient method (FSCM) in the observation period of 2001 - 2002. The result using CRSM and FSCM shows that audit committee firms ERC’s were bigger than non audit committee firm ERC’s. These result showed that unexpected earnings of audit committee firms were responssed stronger than non audit committee firm because investor believe that <b>noise</b> of audit <b>committee</b> firms earnings were less than non audit committee firms.

40|$|One of {{the most}} widely used {{techniques}} for data clustering is agglomerative clustering. Such algorithms have been long used across any different fields ranging from computational biology to social sciences to computer vision in part because they are simple and their output is easy to interpret. However, many of these algorithms lack any performance guarantees when the data is noisy, incomplete or has outliers, which is the case for most real world data. It is well known that standard linkage algorithms perform extremely poorly in presence of noise. In this work we propose two new robust algorithms for bottom-up agglomerative clustering and give formal theoretical guarantees for their robustness. We show that our algorithms can be used to cluster accurately in cases where the data satisfies a number of natural properties and where the traditional agglomerative algorithms fail. We also extend our algorithms to an inductive setting with similar guarantees, in which we randomly choose a small subset of points from a much larger instance space and generate a hierarchy over this sample and then insert the rest of the points to it to generate a hierarchy over the entire instance space. We then do a systematic experimental analysis of various linkage algorithms and compare their performance on a variety of real world data sets and show that our algorithms do much better at handling various forms of noise as compared to other hierarchical algorithms in the presence of <b>noise.</b> M.

40|$|A new {{approach}} {{to the process of}} Directed Evolution is proposed, which utilizes different machine learning algorithms. Directed Evolution is a process of improving a protein for catalytic purposes by introducing random mutations in its sequence to create variants. Through these mutations, Directed Evolution explores the sequence space, which is defined as all the possible sequences for a given number of amino acids. Each variant sequence is divided into one of two classes, positive or negative, according to their activity or stability. By employing machine learning algorithms for feature selection on the sequence of these variants of the protein, attributes or amino acids in its sequence important for the classification into positive or negative, can be identified. Support Vector Machines (SVMs) were utilized to identify the important individual amino acids for any protein, which have to be preserved to maintain its activity. The results for the case of beta-lactamase show that such residues can be identified with high accuracy while using a small number of variant sequences. Another class of machine learning problems, Boolean Learning, was used to extend this approach to identifying interactions between the different amino acids in a proteins sequence using the variant sequences. It was shown through simulations that such interactions can be identified for any protein with a reasonable number of variant sequences. For experimental verification of this approach, two fluorescent proteins, mRFP and DsRed, were used to generate variants, which were screened for fluorescence. Using Boolean Learning, an interacting pair was identified, which was shown to be important for the fluorescence. It was also shown through experiments and simulations that knowing such pairs can increase the fraction active variants in the library. A Boolean Learning algorithm was also developed for this application, which can learn Boolean functions from data in the presence of classification <b>noise.</b> Ph.
