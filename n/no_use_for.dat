5|$|After World War I, {{the bulk}} of the High Seas Fleet was interned in Scapa Flow. As they were the oldest German dreadnoughts, the Nassau-class ships were for the time {{permitted}} to remain in German ports. After the German fleet was scuttled, Nassau and her three sisters were surrendered to the victorious Allied powers as replacements for the sunken ships. Nassau was ceded to Japan in April 1920. With <b>no</b> <b>use</b> <b>for</b> the ship, Japan sold her to a British wrecking firm which then scrapped her in Dordrecht, Netherlands.|$|E
5|$|There is {{currently}} <b>no</b> <b>use</b> <b>for</b> any isotope of berkelium outside basic scientific research. Berkelium-249 {{is a common}} target nuclide to prepare still heavier transuranic elements and transactinides, such as lawrencium, rutherfordium and bohrium. It is also useful {{as a source of}} the isotope californium-249, which is used for studies on the chemistry of californium in preference to the more radioactive californium-252 that is produced in neutron bombardment facilities such as the HFIR.|$|E
5|$|Although {{protactinium}} {{is located}} in the periodic table between uranium and thorium, which both have numerous applications, owing to its scarcity, high radioactivity and high toxicity, there are currently <b>no</b> <b>uses</b> <b>for</b> protactinium outside of scientific research.|$|R

5|$|Both ships {{survived the}} war. As {{part of the}} Treaty of Versailles, which ended the war, the ships were awarded to the victorious powers as war prizes. Kolberg was {{allocated}} to France, where she was commissioned into the French Navy as Colmar. Augsburg was transferred to Japanese control; having <b>no</b> <b>use</b> <b>for</b> her, they sold the ship for scrapping. Colmar saw one tour on colonial duty in Asia in 1924, where she participated in a multinational operation to protect foreign nationals from Chinese unrest in Shanghai. She was subsequently stricken in 1927 and broken up for scrap in Brest, France.|$|E
5|$|According to the {{hypothesis}} that snake venom had a single evolutionary origin, venom {{in a number of}} lineages of snakes subsequently atrophied. Evidence of such atrophication has been found in several snakes. A 2005 study in the marbled sea snake, Aipysurus eydouxii found that the gene for a three-fingered protein found in the venom had undergone a deletion of two nucleotide bases which made the venom 50-100 times less toxic than it had been previously. This change was correlated with a change in diet from fish to a diet consisting almost entirely of fish eggs, suggesting that the adaptation to an egg diet had removed the selection pressure needed to maintain a highly toxic venom, allowing the venom genes to accumulate deleterious mutations. A similar venom degradation following a shift to an egg-based diet has been found in the Common egg-eater Dasypeltis scabra, whose diet consists entirely of birds' eggs, meaning that the snake had <b>no</b> <b>use</b> <b>for</b> its venom. This has led biologists to suggest that if venom is not used by a species, it is rapidly lost.|$|E
5|$|The ships saw {{no action}} during the war, owing {{in large part}} to the nature of the Adriatic campaign. The Austro-Hungarian Navy and its primary opponent, the Italian Navy, both adopted {{cautious}} strategies, since neither wanted to risk its fleet in the narrow waters of the Adriatic Sea, where naval mines and fast, torpedo-armed craft could operate effectively. Zara was stationed in Cattaro Bay and Sebenico protected the harbor of her namesake city, while Spalato provided local defense outside Pola. Zara was transferred from Cattaro Bay to Pola in June 1917, but while en route, suffered a serious explosion that caused significant damage to her bow. A contemporary investigation determined that it was the result of badly deteriorated chemicals in her torpedo warheads, though the naval historian René Greger reports that a mine was actually to blame. After repairs were effected, she joined the harbor defense at Pola. Sebenico was withdrawn from guard duties in 1918 and assigned to the torpedo school. All three ships were seized as war prizes by the victorious Allied powers after the war in 1918, and all three were awarded to Italy in 1920. Having <b>no</b> <b>use</b> <b>for</b> the vessels, the Italians immediately sold all three to ship breakers.|$|E
