40|$|Introduction:  <b>Stroke</b> <b>care</b> {{is complex}} and often {{provided}} by various healthcare organisations. Integrated care solutions are needed to optimise <b>stroke</b> <b>care.</b> In this paper, we describe the development of integrated <b>stroke</b> <b>care</b> {{in the region of}} Maastricht during the last 15 years. Description of integrated care case: Located in the south of the Netherlands, the region of Maastricht developed integrated <b>stroke</b> <b>care</b> to serve a population of about 180, 000 people. Integration was needed to improve the continuity, coordination and quality of <b>stroke</b> <b>care.</b> The development of integrated care in Maastricht was a phased process. The last phase emphasized early discharge from hospital and assessing the best individual rehabilitation track in a specialized nursing home setting. Discussion and lessons learned: {{the development and implementation of}} integrated <b>stroke</b> <b>care</b> in the region of Maastricht led to fewer days in hospital, more patients being directly admitted to the stroke unit and an earlier start of rehabilitation. The implementation of early discharge from the hospital and rehabilitation assessment in a nursing home led to some unforeseen problems and lessons learned...|$|R
40|$|Background: The most {{effective}} and efficient model for providing organized <b>stroke</b> <b>care</b> remains uncertain. This study aimed to compare the effect of two models in a randomized controlled trial. Methods: Patients with acute stroke were randomized on day one of admission to combined, co-located acute/rehabilitation <b>stroke</b> <b>care</b> or traditionally separated acute/rehabilitation <b>stroke</b> <b>care.</b> Outcomes measured at baseline and 90 days postdischarge included functional independence measure, length of hospital stay, and functional independence measure efficiency (change in functional independence measure score ÷ total length of hospital stay). Results: Among 41 patients randomized, 20 were allocated co-located acute/rehabilitation <b>stroke</b> <b>care</b> and 21 traditionally separated acute/rehabilitation <b>stroke</b> <b>care.</b> Baseline measurements showed no significant difference. There {{was no significant difference}} in functional independence measure scores between the two groups at discharge and again at 90 days postdischarge (co-located acute/rehabilitation stroke care: 103 · 6 ± 22 · 2 vs. traditionally separated acute/rehabilitation stroke care: 99 · 5 ± 27 · 7; P = 0 · 77 at discharge; co-located acute/rehabilitation stroke care: 109 · 5 ± 21 · 7 vs. traditionally separated acute/rehabilitation stroke care: 104 · 4 ± 27 · 9; P = 0 · 8875 at 90 days post-discharge). Total length of hospital stay was 5 · 28 days less in co-located acute/rehabilitation <b>stroke</b> <b>care</b> compared with traditionally separated acute/rehabilitation <b>stroke</b> <b>care</b> (24 · 15 ± 3 · 18 vs. 29 · 42 ± 4 · 5, P = 0 · 35). There was significant improvement in functional independence measure efficiency score among participants assigned to co-located acute/rehabilitation <b>stroke</b> <b>care</b> compared with traditionally separated acute/rehabilitation <b>stroke</b> <b>care</b> (co-located acute/rehabilitation <b>stroke</b> care: median 1 · 60, interquartile range: 0 · 87 – 2 · 81; traditionally separated acute/rehabilitation stroke care: median 0 · 82, interquartile range: 0 · 27 – 1 · 57, P = 0 · 0393). Linear regression analysis revealed a high inverse correlation (R ² = 0 · 89) between functional independence measure efficiency and time spent in the acute stroke unit. Conclusion: This proof-of-concept study has shown that co-located acute/rehabilitation <b>stroke</b> <b>care</b> was just as effective as traditionally separated acute/rehabilitation <b>stroke</b> <b>care</b> as reflected in functional independence measure scores, but significantly more efficient as shown in greater functional independence measure efficiency. Co-located acute/rehabilitation <b>stroke</b> <b>care</b> has potential for significantly improved hospital bed utilization with no patient disadvantage...|$|R

40|$|Background: Women {{have more}} {{frequent}} and severe ischemic strokes than men, and {{are less likely to}} receive treatment for acute stroke. Primary stroke centers (PSCs) have been shown to utilize treatment more frequently. Further, as telemedicine (TM) has expanded access to acute <b>stroke</b> <b>care</b> we sought to investigate the association between PSC, TM and access to acute <b>stroke</b> <b>care</b> in the state of Texas. Methods: Texas hospitals and resources were identified from the 2009 American Hospital Association Annual Survey. Hospitals were categorized as: (1) stand-alone PSCs not using telemedicine for acute <b>stroke</b> <b>care,</b> (2) PSCs using telemedicine for acute <b>stroke</b> <b>care</b> (PSC-TM), (3) non-PSC hospitals using telemedicine for acute <b>stroke</b> <b>care,</b> or (4) non-PSC hospitals not using telemedicine for acute <b>stroke</b> <b>care.</b> The proportion of the population who could reach a PSC within 60 minutes was determined for stand-alone PSCs, PSC-TM, and non-PSCs using TM for <b>stroke</b> <b>care.</b> Results: Overall, women were as likely to have 60 -minute access to a PSC or PSC-TM as their male counterparts (POR 1. 02, 95 % CI 1. 02 - 1. 03). Women were also just as likely to have access to acute <b>stroke</b> <b>care</b> via PSC or PSC-TM or TM as men (POR 1. 03, 95 % CI 1. 02 - 1. 04). Discussion: Our study found no sex disparities in access to stand alone PSCs or to hospitals using TM in the state of Texas.

40|$|AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To {{conduct a}} survey of the {{clinical}} nursing practice in European countries in accordance with the European Stroke Strategies (ESS) 2006, and to examine to what extent the ESS have been implemented in <b>stroke</b> <b>care</b> nursing in Europe. BACKGROUND: Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability globally. Optimal organisation of interdisciplinary <b>stroke</b> <b>care</b> is expected to ameliorate outcome after stroke. Consequently, universal access to <b>stroke</b> <b>care</b> based on evidence-based guidelines is a priority. DESIGN: This study is a descriptive cross-sectional survey. METHODS: A questionnaire comprising 61 questions based on the ESS and scientific evidence in nursing practice was distributed to representatives of the European Association of Neuroscience Nurses, who sent the questionnaire to nurses active in <b>stroke</b> <b>care.</b> The questionnaire covered the following areas of stroke care: Organization of stroke services, Management of acute stroke and prevention including basic care and nursing, and Secondary prevention. RESULTS: Ninety-two nurses in <b>stroke</b> <b>care</b> in 11 European countries participated in the survey. Within the first 48 hours after stroke onset, 95 % monitor patients regularly, 94 % start mobilization after 24 hours when patients are stable and 89 % assess patients' ability to swallow. Change of position for immobile patients is followed by 73 %, and post-void residual urine volume is measured by 85 %. Some aspects needed improvement, for example staff education (70 %), education for patients/families/carers (55 %), and individual care plans in secondary prevention (62 %). CONCLUSIONS: The participating European countries comply well with the ESS guidelines, particularly in the acute <b>stroke</b> <b>care,</b> but not all stroke units have reached optimal development in all aspects of <b>stroke</b> <b>care</b> nursing. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Our study may provide clinical administrators and nurses in <b>stroke</b> <b>care</b> with information that may contribute to improved compliance with the European Stroke Strategies and evidence-based guidelines. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Background: Adoption of {{contemporary}} evidence-based guidelines for acute stroke management is often delayed {{due to a}} range of key enablers and barriers. Recent reviews on such barriers focus mainly on specific acute stroke therapies or generalised <b>stroke</b> <b>care</b> guidelines. This review examined the overall barriers and enablers, as perceived by health professionals which affect how evidence-based practice guidelines (<b>stroke</b> unit <b>care,</b> thrombolysis administration, aspirin usage and decompressive surgery) for acute <b>stroke</b> <b>care</b> are adopted in hospital settings...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: A {{number of}} {{evidence-based}} interventions {{are now available}} for stroke patients. Good-quality <b>stroke</b> <b>care</b> involves a range of health professionals located across ambulance, hospital, community and primary care services. This study examined the perspectives of health-care workers involved in <b>stroke</b> <b>care</b> in Sweden and England on the integration challenges <b>stroke</b> <b>care</b> presents. Methods: Four qualitative case {{studies were carried out}} in Sweden and England, including 95 semistructured interviews with clinicians and managers associated with four different hospitals providing specialized stroke services. Findings: High levels of organizational, functional, service and clinical integration among clinicians that deliver emergency and acute <b>stroke</b> <b>care</b> were identified. This is frequently lacking among professionals delivering postacute care. These findings are linked to the prevalence or lack of normative and systemic integration in each respective stage of care. Conclusions: Emphasis on the need to treat stroke as an emergency condition in both countries has created a context in which normative and systemic integration often occurs among clinicians that deliver emergency and acute <b>stroke</b> <b>care,</b> aiding the development of organizational, functional, service and clinical integration across the case study sites. In contrast, integration between hospital and community (rehabilitation and general practice) care is frequently less successful...|$|R
40|$|Background. Ischemic stroke {{is a time}} {{sensitive}} disease with the effectiveness of treatment decreasing over time. Treatment {{is more likely to}} occur at Primary Stroke Centers (PSC); thus rapid access to acute <b>stroke</b> <b>care</b> through stand-alone PSCs or telemedicine (TM) is vital for all Americans. The objective {{of this study is to}} determine if disparities exist in access to PSCs or the extended access to acute <b>stroke</b> <b>care</b> provided by TM. Methods. Data from the US Census Bureau and the 2010 Neilson Claritas Demographic Estimation Program, American Hospital Association annual survey, and The Joint Commission list of PSCs and survey response data for all hospitals in the state of Texas were used.
