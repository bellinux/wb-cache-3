In {{an interview with}} MTV, {{he said he wanted}} to distinguish himself from the other rappers who had the word in their moniker: [...] "All these Lil’ rappers, I’m just kind of getting real irritated by it. I said, 'You know what? Drop the Lil'. Forget it. I’m Bow Wow.' Besides, I’m growing up, I’m not little anymore. [...] two weeks ago. I really got irritable. It’s all these Lil’ cats, forget it. I’m Bow Wow <b>now.</b> <b>Everything</b> is just 'Bow Wow,' no 'Lil' Bow Wow.'" ...|$|E
500|$|In June 2011, DC {{announced}} that Barbara Gordon would {{be returning to}} the role of Batgirl in September 2011, in her own eponymous monthly comic, as part of a company-wide relaunch of all of their titles. In addition, former Birds of Prey writer Gail Simone would be writing the series. This announcement {{became one of the most}} controversial aspects of the DC Comics relaunch. Supporters of Barbara Gordon in her persona as Oracle expressed dismay over losing an iconic character for the disabled community. Journalist and blogger Jill Pantozzi, who is diagnosed with muscular dystrophy, stated that [...] "people being disabled is part of the real world, it is essential it be part of the fictional world as well... Writer Kevin Van Hook did a great job showing what disabled individuals have to go through in the mini-series Oracle: The Cure. It’s that type of honesty I expect more of... While some diverse characters were mishandled over the years, Oracle was always treated with the utmost respect but this move is the most disrespectful I’ve seen in a long time." [...] Gail Simone responded directly by stating that at times when others had attempted to restore Gordon's mobility, she fought to keep her as a disabled character, even in light of requests from readers who also had disabilities that wished to see the character healed. However, part of her reasoning for reversing her decision and writing Batgirl with Gordon as the title character was that [...] "rms and legs get ripped off, and they grow back, somehow. Graves don't stay filled. But the one constant is that Barbara stays in that chair. Role model or not, that is problematic and uncomfortable, and the excuses to not cure her, in a world of purple rays and magic and super-science, are often unconvincing or wholly meta-textual. And the longer it goes on, the more it has stretched credibility. But <b>now,</b> <b>everything</b> has changed. If nearly everyone in the DCU, not just Batgirl but almost everyone, is now at a much earlier stage in their career, then my main objection no longer applies, because we are seeing Barbara at an earlier starting point." ...|$|E

2500|$|The French {{art scene}} {{was in a}} process of change, as radical artists such as Courbet and Manet tried to break away from {{accepted}} Academic tradition and the Impressionists were in their formative years. Cassatt's friend Eliza Haldeman wrote home that artists [...] "are leaving the Academy style and each seeking a new way, consequently just <b>now</b> <b>everything</b> is Chaos." [...] Cassatt, on the other hand, continued to work in the traditional manner, submitting works to the Salon for over ten years, with increasing frustration.|$|E
2500|$|Progressing {{far beyond}} the {{comparatively}} frivolous musicals and sentimental operettas of the decade, Broadway's Show Boat (1927), represented an even more complete integration of book and score than the Princess Theatre musicals, with dramatic themes told through the music, dialogue, setting and movement. This was accomplished by combining the lyricism of Kern's music with the skillful libretto of Oscar Hammerstein II. One historian wrote, [...] "Here {{we come to a}} completely new genre – the musical play as distinguished from musical comedy. <b>Now</b> ... <b>everything</b> else was subservient to that play. Now ... came complete integration of song, humor and production numbers into a single and inextricable artistic entity." ...|$|E
