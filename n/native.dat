This study addressed {{the question of what}} happens when HA <b>natives</b> resident at SL return to HA: do they acclimatize like SL <b>natives</b> or revert to the characteristics of HA <b>natives?</b> Fifteen HA <b>natives</b> resident at SL were studied, together with 15 SL <b>natives</b> as controls. Air-breathing end-tidal PCO 2 and AHVR were determined at SL. Subjects were then transported to 4, 300 m, where these measurements were repeated on each of the following 5 days. There {{were no significant differences in}} the magnitude or time course of the changes in end-tidal PCO 2 and AHVR between the two groups. We conclude that HA <b>natives</b> normally resident at SL undergo ventilatory acclimatization to HA in the same manner as SL <b>natives...</b>|$|R

5|$|Agrilus planipennis, {{commonly}} known as the emerald ash borer, is a green buprestid or jewel beetle <b>native</b> to northeastern Asia that feeds on ash species. Females lay eggs in bark crevices on ash trees, and larvae feed underneath the bark of ash trees to emerge as adults in one to two years. In its <b>native</b> range, it is typically found at low densities and does not cause significant damage to trees <b>native</b> to the area. Outside its <b>native</b> range, it is an invasive species and is highly destructive to ash trees <b>native</b> to northwest Europe and North America. Prior to being found in North America, very little was known about emerald ash borer in its <b>native</b> range; this has resulted in much of the research on its biology being focused in North America. Local governments in North America are attempting to control it by monitoring its spread, diversifying tree species, insecticides, and biological control.|$|E

In a council which began on October 17, Bouquet demanded that the Ohio <b>Native</b> Americans return all captives, including those not yet returned from the French and Indian War. Guyasuta and other leaders reluctantly handed over more than 200 captives, many of whom had been adopted into <b>Native</b> families.
