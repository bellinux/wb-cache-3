5|$|Although skull {{proportions}} varied, abelisaurid skulls {{were generally}} very tall and very short in length. In Carnotaurus, for example, the skull was <b>nearly</b> <b>as</b> tall {{as it was}} long. The premaxilla in abelisaurids was very tall, so {{the front of the}} snout was blunt, not tapered as seen in many other theropods.|$|E
5|$|American cryptographers {{had broken}} most of Japan's codes, {{including}} the Purple code {{used by the}} Japanese Foreign Office to encode high-level diplomatic correspondence. As a result, messages between Tokyo and Japan's embassies were provided to Allied policy-makers <b>nearly</b> <b>as</b> quickly as to the intended recipients.|$|E
5|$|Baseball {{has certain}} {{attributes}} that set it {{apart from the}} other popular team sports in the countries where it has a following. All of these sports use a clock; in all of them, play is less individual and more collective; and in none {{of them is the}} variation between playing fields <b>nearly</b> <b>as</b> substantial or important. The comparison between cricket and baseball demonstrates that many of baseball's distinctive elements are shared in various ways with its cousin sports.|$|E

5|$|Flat Creek, a small southeast-flowing stream, {{rises in}} two forks and empties into the Sacramento River {{upstream}} of Spring Creek. The stream receives contaminated runoff from the Minnesota Flats Tailing Pile, {{but is not}} <b>nearly</b> <b>as</b> polluted or acidic as Spring Creek. Another stream, Rock Creek, rises in three forks and flows east to meet the Sacramento River downstream of Spring Creek and the Keswick Reservoir.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the launch}} of STS-124, severe damage was seen at the pad where bricks were blasted from the walls, but NASA {{officials}} stated the damage from the STS-125 launch was not <b>nearly</b> <b>as</b> severe and should not impact {{the launch of}} STS-127 in June.|$|E
5|$|Horses were {{probably}} ridden in prehistory {{before they were}} driven. However, evidence is scant, mostly simple images of human figures on horse-like animals drawn on rock or clay. The earliest tools used to control horses were bridles of various sorts, which were invented <b>nearly</b> <b>as</b> soon as the horse was domesticated. Evidence of bit wear appears on the teeth of horses excavated at the archaeology sites of the Botai culture in northern Kazakhstan, dated 35003000 BC.|$|E

5|$|In {{comparison}} {{to those of}} Tachyoryctes audax, the nasal bones are larger and have angles at the sides. T.annectens, which is <b>nearly</b> <b>as</b> large, has smaller teeth and nasals; in T.rex, the basioccipital is broader, and the back part of the mandible (lower jaw) is better developed and has the capsule of the incisor placed further to the front.|$|E
5|$|Neptunium chalcogen and pnictogen {{compounds}} {{have been}} well studied primarily as part of research into their electronic and magnetic properties and their interactions in the natural environment. Pnictide and carbide compounds have also attracted interest because of {{their presence in the}} fuel of several advanced nuclear reactor designs, although the latter group has not had <b>nearly</b> <b>as</b> much research as the former.|$|E
5|$|Pallas's {{surface is}} most likely {{composed}} of a silicate material; its spectrum and estimated density resemble carbonaceous chondrite meteorites. With an orbital inclination of 34.8Â°, Pallas's orbit is unusually highly inclined to {{the plane of the}} asteroid belt, and its orbital eccentricity is <b>nearly</b> <b>as</b> large as that of Pluto, making Pallas relatively inaccessible to spacecraft.|$|E

5|$|Peart is {{the main}} lyricist for Rush. Literature has always heavily {{influenced}} his writings and, as such, he has tackled {{a wide range of}} subjects. In his early days with Rush, much of his lyrical output was influenced by fantasy, science fiction, mythology and philosophy. However, <b>nearly</b> <b>as</b> much would deal with real world or personal issues such as life on the road and parts of his adolescence.|$|E
5|$|Q*bert {{became one}} of the most merchandised arcade games behind Pac-Man, {{although}} according to John Sellers it was not <b>nearly</b> <b>as</b> successful as that franchise or Donkey Kong. The character's likeness appears on various items including coloring books, sleeping bags, frisbees, board games, wind-up toys, and stuffed animals.|$|E
5|$|Tech quarterback Reggie Ball was not <b>nearly</b> <b>as</b> acclaimed. Despite {{leading the}} ACC with 20 {{touchdown}} passes and being named an All-ACC honorable mention, there were doubts about Ball's effectiveness. Since starting at quarterback in his freshman year, Ball went 0-4 against Tech rival Georgia, and was excoriated for his inconsistency. After suffering a game-losing fumble against the Bulldogs, commentators questioned how well Ball would recover from the setback before the ACC Championship Game.|$|E
50|$|Differential probes are {{optimized}} for acquiring differential signals.

5|$|The Pend Oreille River system (including {{its main}} tributaries, the Clark Fork and Flathead rivers) is also similar {{in size to}} the Columbia at their confluence. Compared to the Columbia River above the two rivers' confluence, the Pend Oreille-Clark-Flathead is <b>nearly</b> <b>as</b> long (about 86%), its basin about three-fourths as large (76%), and its {{discharge}} over a third (37%).|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} year, a few units arranged ceasefires but the truces {{were not}} <b>nearly</b> <b>as</b> widespread as in 1914; this was, in part, due to strongly worded {{orders from the}} high commands of both sides prohibiting fraternisation. Soldiers were no longer amenable to truce by 1916. The war had become increasingly bitter after devastating human losses suffered during the battles of the Somme and Verdun, and the incorporation of poison gas.|$|E
5|$|The {{isolation}} of the island and its diversity of habitats and microclimates have favoured the diversification of a highly endemic flora: Of the 850 known native plant species, 230 are endemic, and half of those are endangered.
