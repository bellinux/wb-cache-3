Shape of particles {{has been shown to}} have an impact on various processes including circulation, vascular adhesion and phagocytosis. Here, we assess the role of particle geometry and surface chemistry in their interactions with cell membranes. Using representative particles of different shape (spheres, elongated and flat particles), size (500 nm– 1 µm) and surface chemistry (positively and negatively charged), we evaluated the response of endothelial cells to particles. While spherical and elliptical disc-shaped particles did not have an impact on cell spreading and motility, <b>needle-shaped</b> <b>particles</b> induced significant changes in the same. Further studies revealed that <b>needle-shaped</b> <b>particles</b> induced disruption of cell membranes as indicated by the release of lactate dehydrogenase and uptake of extracellular calcein.

The crystallization under study is that of CDP 323 - 2, a small-molecule prodrug antagonist. As the particles do not show a spherical shape habit, particular care {{has to be taken}} when interpreting FBRM chord length distributions. Case-specific chord length distribution (CLD) properties are defined for <b>needle-shaped</b> <b>particles</b> to study primary and secondary nucleation, as well as crystal growth and breakage during the crystallization. Results show the crystallization of CDP 323 - 2 to be characterized by a very rapid longitudinal growth after nucleation. During the initial stages of cooling, crystal growth kinetics dominate secondary nucleation, but this tendency is reversed for the lower temperatures of the cooling profile.

The study demonstrated that the light scattering particle size methods (LD and FBRM) can be used qualitatively to study the attrition that occurs during drying of <b>needle-shaped</b> <b>particles,</b> however, for full quantitative analysis, image analysis is required. The algorithm used in analysis of LD data assumes the scattering particles are spherical regardless of the actual shape of the particles under evaluation. FBRM measures a chord length distribution (CLD) rather than the particle size distribution (PSD), which {{in the case of}} needles is weighted towards the needle width rather than their length.

40|$|The {{extent of}} {{regeneration}} following biomaterial implantation {{is dependent on}} the microenvironment surrounding the implant. Since implant composition can {{have a profound effect on}} inflammation, it is essential to understand this process as a non-resolving inflammatory response can lead to fibrous encapsulation and insufficient integration. Incorporation of particulates into implants confers structural and functional benefits, thus optimizing particulate characteristics to enhance immune mediated efficacy is important. We investigated the relationship between the nature of hydroxyapatite (HA) particles and the innate immune response, focusing on how particle size (0. 1 [*]µm, 5 [*]µm, 20 [*]µm, 100 [*]µm) and morphology (needle-shaped/spherical; smooth/rough surface) modulates inflammatory responses. We observed a shape and size-dependent activation of the NLRP 3 inflammasome and IL- 1 β secretion; while needle-shaped and smaller HA particles significantly enhanced cytokine secretion, larger particles did not. Moreover, HA particle characteristics profoundly influenced patterns of innate immune cell recruitment and cytokine production following injection. While small, <b>needle-shaped</b> <b>particles</b> induced a strong inflammatory response, this was not observed with smooth, spherical particles of comparable size or with larger particles. These findings indicate that hydroxyapatite particle characteristics dictate immune cell recruitment and the ensuing inflammatory response, providing an opportunity to tailor HA particle characteristics to regulate immune responses induced after biomaterial implantation...|$|R

Although a correlation between particle size and off-line Raman measurements of COA was demonstrated, it was not possible to derive equivalent information from the in situ Raman spectra owing to the greater effects of particle motion or bulk density variations of the particles in the drier...|$|R
40|$|One of the bottle-necks in {{efficient}} {{energy recovery}} {{is attributed to}} the low thermal conductivity of common coolants. When the thermal conductivity of coolant is improved, the flow rate of coolant required and hence, energy required for pumping can be reduced. Nanofluids are novel class of fluids, prepared by dispersing nanoparticles in liquids like water, ethylene glycol-water mixture, oil etc. aimed at increasing the thermal conductivity of such coolants. In order to maximize the advantages of nanofluids, the particles chosen for dispersion must possess high thermal conductivity and maintain excellent colloidal stability. Cupric oxide has very high thermal conductivity (78 W mK - 1) {{compared to that of}} water (0. 6 W mK - 1) and hence dispersion of cupric oxide in water will serve to conserve energy. We have developed cupric oxide-water nanofluids using a two-step method. Cupric oxide nanoparticles were synthesized by reduction of cupric acetate. Scanning electron micrographs revealed the presence of <b>needle-shaped</b> <b>particles</b> of 60 nm wide and 252 nm long.

Electrostatic repulsion and steric repulsion are expected to be responsible for colloidal stability of CuO-water nanofluids.

Furthermore, our results indicate that interactions between amelogenin hydrophilic C-terminal telopeptides are essential for oligomer formation and for subsequent steps of hierarchical self-assembly.

Drowning-out crystallizationexperiments has been performed by the controlled addition ofwater or ethanol water mixtures to a saturated solution ofbenzoic acid in ethanol-water mixtures. Crystal habitcontrolling factors have been identified. Seededcrystallization experiments have been carried out to evaluatethe effect of solvent composition on crystal habit at constantsupersaturation. The solubility of benzoic acid inethanol-water mixtures at the working temperatures has beendetermined. Electro-zone sensing determinations and microscopicmeasurements are used to characterize the final crystallineproduct. It has been found that the shape of the benzoic acidcrystals grown from ethanol-water solutions ranges from needlesto platelets. Platy particles possess a predominant basal plane(001), bound by (010) and (100) faces, while needles aredeveloped along the b-axis. Long <b>needle-shaped</b> <b>particles</b> havebeen produced at low initial bulk concentration and highethanol concentration in the feed. Small platelets are obtainedat high initial bulk concentrations and high waterconcentration in the feed. The effect of solvent composition on the growth rate hasbeen evaluated at constant supersaturation. Seed crystals arecharacterized by image analysis measurement both before andafter each experiment. Length and width dimensions have beenmeasured on the particle silhouette. The growth rate, thesolid-liquid interfacial energy and the surface entropy factorfor the (010) faces (length dimension) and (100) faces (widthdimension) have been estimated. The interfacial energy andsurface entropy factor decreases in the direction of increasingethanol concentration due to increasing solubility. The results suggest that at low ethanol concentration(xEtOH< 60 %) growth proceeds by screw dislocation mechanism,and adsorption of ethanol molecules may reduce the growth rate. As the ethanol concentration increases above a critical value(xEtOH ≥ 60 %), the growth mechanism shifts to surfacenucleation and the growth rate increases with increasingethanol concentration. It has been suggested that the observedeffect of the solvent composition on crystal habit is theresult of two conflicting effects here referred as the kineticand interfacial energy effects. High interactions of the pairethanol-benzoic acid seem to be responsible of the growthretardation (kinetic effect) exerted by the solvent. On theother hand, increased ethanol concentration leads to reduceinterfacial energy and increasing surface nucleation whichmight contribute to enhance growth kinetics.

The {{physical}} properties of solid pharmaceutical particles used in pulmonary delivery must, at the minimum, meet the following stringent conditions; the particles {{must be in}} the appropriate size range (1 ~ 5 micron in aerodynamic diameter); there should be minimal agglomeration and their deposition profile in the pulmonary region must be consistent. In this study we used a CO 2 -based aerosol solvent extraction system (ASES), one of the supercritical fluid techniques, to prepare particles composed of small- or large-molecule drugs that are appropriate for pulmonary delivery.; In the case of small-molecule drug particles, we studied the micronization of ipratropium bromide (IB) and terbutaline sulphate (TS), and examined the effect of varying operating conditions on particle morphology. The results indicate that the size and morphology of the microparticles were most sensitive to solvent choice. We also studied the improvement in aerosolization properties when an appropriate additive (albumin) was added. The results indicate that the IB and TS particles with albumin were more spherical, less cohesive and less agglomerated in air flow, thus expected to lead to more effective and consistent lung deposition.; In the case of large-molecule drug particles, insulin was micronized with appropriate stabilizers and absorption enhancers. Of particular interest in this study was the insulin particle shape and whether processing affects the stability and activity of the insulin. With respect to inhaled insulin particles with stabilizers, insulin/mannitol/trehalose particles were relatively uniform, more spherical, less cohesive, and less agglomerated in air flow, when compared to insulin/mannitol particles which formed irregular and <b>needle-shaped</b> <b>particles.</b> Furthermore, the insulin particle mophology was highly influenced by the addition of the absorption enhancer. In the present study, the use of cyclodextrin and maltoside was suitable to produce inhaled insulin particles which showed relatively spherical-shaped and uniformed particles.

40|$|Transition {{metal oxides}} {{comprise}} a fascinating class of materials displaying {{a variety of}} magnetic and electronic properties, ranging from half-metallic ferromagnets like CrO 2, ferrimagnetic semiconductors like Fey's, and antiferromagnetic insulators like rocksalt-structured FeO. The accessibility of multiple electronic configurations and coordination of cations in these oxides enables the control of magnetism by external stimuli. One such stimulus is the insertion of Li+, as occurs during the discharge cycle of a lithium battery. This {{can lead to the}} change in valence and locations of the metal cations within the structure therefore a change in magnetic moment. Fey's and CrO 2 are of considerable interest, primarily because they demonstrate room-temperature magnetism and high spin polarization. Previous studies focussed on use of these materials as cathodes and characterization of lithiated compounds made through solid state chemical synthesis or via chemical lithiation. In this work, changes in magnetization and structure of pulsed laser deposition (PLD) -grown Fey's (magnetite) thin films, Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles, and CrO 2 nanoparticles have been investigated upon electrochemical lithiation. The reasonable electrical conductivity of magnetite opens the possibility of modifying the saturation magnetization by inserting Li+ ions into thin films grown on conducting substrates. A substantial decrease in M 8 (up to 30 %) was observed in PLD-grown thin films. Significantly larger reduction in moment (up to 75 %) was observed in commercially available nanoparticles upon addition of 2 moles of Li per formula unit, along with changes in remanence and coercivity. The smaller drop in M 8 observed in thin films is attributed to a kinetic effect due to high density and greater diffusion lengths in PLD-grown films. (cont.) The electrochemical lithiation process has also been applied to <b>needle-shaped</b> <b>particles</b> of chromium dioxide and a model has been proposed to explain the observations. The effects of cycling and discharge-charge rate on these CrO 2 particles have been studied. It has been shown that the process may be partially reversible for low Li contents. The effects of increasing the temperature of cycling and decreasing the length of the CrO 2 particles have been explored. These changes in magnetic moment may be rendered useful in magnetomechanical or magnetoelectronic applications. by Vikram Sivakumar. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|Precipitation {{in three}} Al-Mg-Ge(-Si-Cu) alloys has been {{investigated}} using transmission electron microscopy. The alloy compositions were chosen {{to be similar to}} previously studied Al-Mg-Si(-Cu) alloys to facilitate direct comparison. These alloys are strengthened by the precipitation of nanometresized, <b>needle-shaped</b> <b>particles</b> during heat treatment. A deeper understanding of precipitation at the atomic level is required in order to achieve greater control over alloy properties. The precipitation in the investigated Al-Mg- Ge(-Si-Cu) alloys was found to share similarities with that in Al-Mg-Si(-Cu) alloys, but there were also significant differences. The high atomic number of Ge relative to Al, Mg, and Si made Al-Mg-Ge alloys highly suited for study by the atomic-number sensitive technique high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF STEM). This was the most important technique employed in this thesis. The use of a state-of-the-art aberration-corrected microscope also made it possible to resolve details previously inaccessible. A near-hexagonal network of Ge columns when viewed along the needle direction was a unifying feature of all the precipitates in these alloys, {{as is the case in}} the metastable precipitates of the Al-Mg-Si(-Cu) alloy system. However, the β __ phase, the most important hardening phase in Al-Mg-Si alloys, was not observed. Instead, hardnesses similar to that of comparable Al-Mg-Si(-Cu) alloys were achieved through other precipitate phases. Two Al-Mg-Ge alloys were the main objects of study in this thesis: one Mg-rich and one Ge-rich, with an addition of Mg and Ge in the relation Mg 2 Ge and Mg 5 Ge 6, respectively. Precipitate phases that form in overaged Al-Mg-Si alloys were observed around peak hardness in these Al-Mg-Ge alloys, as well as disordered precipitates. The precipitate phases known from Al-Mg-Si, U 1 and β _, were finer and more coherent with the Al matrix in the Al-Mg-Ge alloys than their counterparts in Al-Mg-Si. These precipitates also displayed highly interesting interface structures, consisting of Ge atoms in columns not part of the bulk precipitate structure. The β _ -like precipitate phase that was observed in the Mg-rich alloy was investigated by quantitative HAADF STEM. This method makes it possible to obtain quantitative compositional information from the specimen. It was found that the Ge-rich columns contained significantly less Ge than the Si columns of β _ in Al-Mg-Si alloys. A partial replacement of Ge by Al or vacancies might explain the smaller lattice parameter of the β _ -like phase in Al-Mg-Ge compared with β _ in Al-Mg-Si alloys. Precipitation in an Al-Mg-Si-Ge-Cu alloy was also investigated with HAADF STEM. No repeating unit cell was observed in these precipitates near peak hardness. However, these precipitates contained a hexagonal network consisting of mixed Si and Ge columns with Mg, Al, and Cu columns occurring in between the network columns at specific sites. Structural units consisting of Al, Mg, Si, and Ge were often arranged in an ordered manner. PhD i fysikkPhD in Physic...|$|R

Material compositions that were considered include KNN with and without addition of 0. 5 mol% MnO, and KNN modified with Li and Ta (KNNLT), and Mn substituted into the A or B site of the perovskite structure. The two compositions KNN-Mn and KNNLT-Mn(A) compositions were further investigated as candidate materials for texturing. Textured samples of the two materials were made by tape casting and templated grain growth, using <b>needle-shaped</b> KNN <b>particles</b> as templates, while non-textured reference samples were made by conventional sintering of powders. Both textured and non-textured dense materials were characterized with respect to density, degree of texture and piezoelectric and dielectric properties. The non-textured materials sintered to high relative densities of 93. 9 % for KNN-Mn and 96. 7 % for KNNLT-Mn(A). A converse piezoelectric coefficient of over 250 pm/V was measured for non-textured KNNLT-Mn(A), and around 200 pm/V for KNN-Mn. Texturing led to a lower relative density of both compositions, 89. 1 % for KNN-Mn and 92. 1 % for KNNLT-Mn(A). The piezoelectric performance of KNN-Mn was not significantly affected by the texturing procedure, while the piezoelectric performance of KNNLT-Mn(A) became significantly poorer.

Subsequently, the stable organogels were characterized by gel-sol transition studies, microscopic analysis, opacity measurement, FTIR spectroscopy, XRD analysis, thermal analysis (using simultaneous TGA-DTA and DSC) and pH measurement. Salicylic acid (SA), model drug, was incorporated within gels and their in vitro release behavior and antimicrobial efficiency against E. coli and B. subtilis were studied. To ascertain the biocompatibility of the gels, hemocompatibility tests were conducted. The stability tests indicated that the gels were inherently stable when stored below 25 °C. The gel-sol transition study indicated that as the concentration of the gelator was increased, there was a subsequent increase in the transition temperature.

Microscopic analysis indicated that the solid fibers, formed by the clusters of <b>needle-shaped</b> gelator <b>particles,</b> form {{the backbone of the}} organogels structure.

FTIR spectroscopy indicated the presence of hydrogen bonding in both blank and SA-loaded organogels. XRD studies showed that there was a change in the crystallinity of the samples and the change was dependent on the composition of the organogels. The pH of the organogels was found to be within the normal human skin pH range. The release studies indicated that the release of SA from the organogels occurred by Higuchian kinetics and were able to restrict the growth of E. coli and B. subtilis efficiently. The organogels were found to be hemocompatible in nature. Based on the results, the developed organogels may be tried as a drug carrier for transdermal and/or topical formulations...|$|R
40|$|Using a morphology-based approach, {{we explore}} the {{relationships}} between three poorly understood species of organic-walled Foraminifera. Thalmann and Bermudez (1954) described Chitinosiphon rufescens as the type species of a new monotypic genus which they compared to the tubular agglutinated foraminiferan Bathysiphon. Loeblich and Tappan (1964), however, considered C. rufescens to be identical to Reophax membranacea Brady 1879, type species of another organic-walled genus, Nodellum. Based on a re-examination of the type specimens of both species, new material of C. rufescens from the Lost City hydrothermal field, and new material of N. membranacea from the NE Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, we show that these two deep-sea species are distinguished by the following features. (1) Chitinosiphon rufescens lacks the distinct, regular constrictions that divide the tubular test of N. membranacea {{into a series of}} segments. (2) The proloculus is spindle-shaped in C. rufescens but sub-cylindrical in N. membranacea. (3) A distinctive, pocket-like invagination is developed at the base (proximal end) of the proloculus in N. membranacea but not in C. rufescens. However, a series of undescribed species which occur in deep-sea sediments blur the distinction between the two genera. We therefore adopt a conservative position and regard Chitinosiphon as a junior synonym of Nodellum. We also examined the holotype and new material of Nodellum moniliforme Resig, 1982, the type species of Resigella Loeblich and Tappan, 1984, in which the organic-walled test comprises a series of bulbous chambers. This species exhibits a basal invagination, identical to the feature present in Nodellum membranacea. These three remarkable species are united by the basically tubular test {{and the nature of the}} test wall which is largely organic, brownish in colour, and exhibits no internal structure when broken sections are examined by SEM. The surface of the organic test of Nodellum rufescens from Lost City is strewn with tiny (? 1 ?m), <b>needle-shaped</b> mineral <b>particles,</b> visible only by SEM. More equidimensional, micron-sized particles are present in the other two species. We agree with Thalmann and Bermudez (1954) that N. rufescens is related to tubular agglutinated taxa such as Bathysiphon. Resigella may have similar affinities, although this needs to be tested using molecular approaches. <br/...|$|R

Moreover, colonization of abiotic surfaces by microorganisms {{and the formation of}} biofilms is a major cause of infections associated with medical implants, resulting in prolonged hospitalization periods and patient mortality. In this study we describe a water-based synthesis of yttrium fluoride (YF 3) nanoparticles (NPs) using sonochemistry. The sonochemical irradiation of an aqueous solution of yttrium (III) acetate tetrahydrate [Y(Ac) 3 &bull; (H 2 O) 4], containing acidic HF as the fluorine ion source, yielded nanocrystalline <b>needle-shaped</b> YF 3 <b>particles.</b> The obtained NPs were characterized by scanning electron microscopy and X-ray elemental analysis. NP crystallinity was confirmed by electron and powder X-ray diffractions. YF 3 NPs showed antibacterial properties against two common bacterial pathogens (Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus) at a &micro;g/mL range. We were also able to demonstrate that antimicrobial activity was dependent on NP size. In addition, catheters were surface modified with YF 3 NPs using a one-step synthesis and coating process. The coating procedure yielded a homogeneous YF 3 NP layer on the catheter, as analyzed by scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectroscopy. These YF 3 NP-modified catheters were investigated for their ability to restrict bacterial biofilm formation. The YF 3 NP-coated catheters were able to significantly reduce bacterial colonization compared to the uncoated surface. Taken together, our results highlight the potential to further develop the concept of utilizing these metal fluoride NPs as novel antimicrobial and antibiofilm agents, taking advantage of their low solubility and providing extended protection.

40|$|The Al–Mg–Si {{system is}} a {{heat-treatable}} class of aluminium alloys that gain their mechanical strength via precipitation hardening. The main hardening phases are precipitated as <b>needle-shaped</b> nano-sized <b>particles</b> from a solid solution of Mg, Si and other added elements. Transmission electron microscopy and muon spin relaxation was used to study precipitation and clustering in Al–Mg–Si alloys, varying the heat treatment and chemical composition {{in order to understand}} the kinetics of precipitation and the morphology, distribution, and atomic structure of hardening precipitates. Muons were found to form bonds with vacancies, atoms in solid solution, and clusters of solute atoms, which are the defects we can gain information from by applying muon spin relaxation to Al alloys. In binary Al–Mg and Al–Si alloys, we discovered very different vacancy behaviours after cooling from high temperatures: Si–vacancy clusters are quickly formed at room temperature in Al–Si, while Al–Mg keeps a much higher vacancy content than pure Al and Al–Si despite a lack of solute clustering. A high muon trapping in a specific temperature range was found in a 1. 6 % Mg 2 Si alloy annealed for 16 hours at 70 – 150 °C. These conditions contain clusters and Guinier–Preston-zones preceding the main hardening phase beta'' in the precipitation sequence. Density functional theory calculations support that the relevant muon trapping site is vacancies inside these structures, suggesting that the structures are stabilised by absorbing vacancies during annealing. The roles of the elements Cu and Ca on precipitation during artificial ageing were investigated. Room temperature storage gives a negative effect on the strength of aged high-solute Al–Mg–Si alloys, in particular when the Mg/Si ratio is high. The negative effect was found to be diminished and delayed by adding 0. 14 at. % Cu to alloys with Mg+Si = 1. 3 at. %, in addition to giving an overall strength increase. Transmission electron microscopy investigations revealed that the fraction of Cu-containing precipitates increased with room temperature storage before ageing. The Cu addition is believed to help the formation of clusters that can act as nucleation sites for hardening precipitates and/or prevent the formation of clusters that can not. Various amounts of Ca was added to an alloy with 0. 53 % Mg and 0. 40 % Si. The Ca accumulated in large particles with composition CaAl 2 Si 2, as determined by X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy. The presence of Si in the particles causes a reduction of the available Si for precipitation and an increase in the effective Mg/Si ratio. The result is a coarser microstructure with a higher fraction of over-aged precipitates and a lower mechanical strength. Aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy coupled with electron energy loss spectroscopy was conducted on an over-aged Al–Mg–Si–Cu–Ag alloy. The microstructure consisted of mostly disordered L and Q' precipitates. After applying principal component analysis to the acquired spectrum images, atomic columns containing Cu and Ag could be clearly distinguished. Cu and Ag were seen to prefer different atomic configurations, and were not observed occupying the same columns. While Cu columns mostly resided in ordered parts of precipitates and along precipitate–matrix interfaces, Ag was diluted in several nearby columns in disordered parts, and at precipitate–matrix interfaces of high misfit.

40|$|Vertical axis mixers, such as {{high shear}} granulators and {{agitated}} filter dryers (AFDs), are commonly used in the processing of particulate materials. For example, AFDs are regularly used in the pharmaceutical industry to dry the wet active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) particles. During the drying process, an impeller blade agitates the bed to increase the drying rate and enhance drying uniformity. Unfortunately, the <b>needle-shaped</b> API <b>particles</b> tend to flow poorly, are frequently damaged, and can sometimes form undesirable agglomerates, causing manufacturing inefficiencies, flow stoppages, and unpredictable product quality. Therefore, {{it is important to}} gain an improved understanding of the system 2 ̆ 7 s particle behavior to aid in the design and optimization of unit operations. Previous work in vertical axis mixers, especially prior computational work, has assumed spherical particles. This thesis focuses on modeling and analysis of dynamics and stresses of elongated particles processed in vertical axis mixers. Elongated particles are of particular interest in the operation of pharmaceutical AFDs since the particles processed in such devices are often needle-shaped. ^ A discrete element method (DEM) model is used to examine the velocity, solid fraction, and particle orientation fields of non-cohesive, sphero-cylindrical particles agitated in a vertical axis mixer for a range of particle aspect ratios and bed depths. The model is validated against experimental measurements of the rotating shaft torque and bed surface velocity field. The particle trajectories within the bed are similar to those that have been reported previously for spheres, with a vortex circulating in the direction opposite of the blade rotation on horizontal planes of the bed. Increasing the particle aspect ratio generally decreases the particle velocities relative to the blade, implying reduced mixing. The solid fraction is largest just upstream of the blades and toward the base of the container. The former finding is different than what has been observed for spheres, but the latter is consistent with prior observations. The smallest solid fractions are located in the wake region and at the bed 2 ̆ 7 s free surface, which is similar to the patterns for spheres. In general, larger particle aspect ratios decrease the overall bed solid fraction as well as the solid fraction uniformity. Particles with an aspect ratio larger than one have major axes that are offset between 10 – 20 degrees from the flow streamlines. The degree of alignment between particles increases near boundary regions. In addition to the strong correlation between the particle principal orientation and velocity vectors, regions of larger velocity gradient magnitude result in smaller solid fractions and smaller degrees of three-dimensional alignment between particles. ^ In addition, the DEM model is used to predict the internal load and moment distribution within sphero-cylindrical particles in a low-speed, vertical axis mixer. The internal loads and moments are combined with small deformation beam bending theory to determine the internal stress distributions. Parametric studies using the model examined the influence of particle aspect ratio, blade rotational speed, and material properties. The spatial distributions of loads and moments, averaged over all particles and time steps, are symmetric about the particle center-plane with a maximum at the particle center-plane. In addition, the largest average maximum principal stress or Mises stress is observed to occur along the particle circumference at the center-plane of the particle. These results indicate that particle failure is not only most likely to occur at the center-plane of the particle, but the failure will occur at the particle 2 ̆ 7 s circumference. The largest average values of loads and moments increase with particle aspect ratio. The largest average maximum principal stress and Mises stress both increase with increasing particle aspect ratio. The trend of largest average maximum principal stress or Mises stress appears to have a positive curvature, which follows the trend of largest average bending moment most closely. The frequency distributions of maximum principal stress at high stress range can be fit to a Weibull distribution. Increasing blade speed, bed height and particle-particle friction coefficient generally leads to an increase in internal loads, moments and stresses, i. e. more particle breakage. ...|$|R
