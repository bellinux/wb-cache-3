The main elements were the antenna, the Foster scanner, the main electronic unit and a Wankel rotary generator (using two-stroke fuel) weighing 390 kg. This was strapped to a simple 590 kg trailer {{that it could be}} operated from. Off the trailer the radar was 2.29 metres high with the antenna up, 1.07 metres with antenna folded, 1.7 metres wide and 1.5 metres long.The radar itself had a nominal 100 kW peak average output and a <b>nominal</b> <b>pulse</b> repetition frequency of 4000 pulses/second.The radar was connected by cable to the operator’s console (‘Indicator Azimuth Unit’) and connected to this was the ‘Mortar Coordinate Indicator’ that displayed the located mortar’s position to the detachment commander. The Foster scanner converted a narrow radar beam, about 40 mils diameter, into one 720 mils wide and 30 mils high. This beam had five pre-set operating positions determined by five different radar horns that directed the beam onto the antenna at slightly different angles. Two beam positions were used with a mortar bomb being recorded by the operator as it went through each beam. This gave two ranges and elevations, and the time interval. The operator marked his screen at each bomb position and changed the beam angle which also recorded time. He then placed electronic markers against his marks (which represented the bomb’s position in the horizontal plane) which the analogue computer used to calculate the mortar coordinates using the expected mortar altitude that has been previously set.|$|E

It was found that random binaurally-synchronized jitter of the pulse timing significantly increases ITD sensitivity. A second experiment studied the effects of rate and place.

Furthermore, it could be concluded from this experiment that listeners were not solely benefiting from the longest interpulse intervals (IPIs) and the instances of reduced rate by adding jitter, because the two types of pulse trains had the same longest IPI. The effect of jitter was studied using a physiologically-based model of auditory nerve and brainstem (medial superior olive neurons). It was found that the random timing of the jittered pulses increased firing synchrony in the auditory periphery, which caused an improved rate-ITD tuning for the 600 -pps pulse trains.

Any source of beam motion {{which results in}} relative vertical offsets of the two beams at the interaction point may significantly reduce the luminosity from the nominal value. Beam-based intra-train feedback systems located in the interaction region are foreseen to correct the relative beam-beam offset and thus to steer the two beams into collision. These feedback systems must be capable of acting within the bunch train. In addition, these feedback systems might considerably help to relax the tight stability tolerances required for the final doublet magnets.

40|$|At INPE we have {{developed}} a HV 100 kV/ 200 A (<b>nominal)</b> Blumlein <b>pulser</b> with pulse duration of 1 µs {{in order to achieve}} higher ion energies in plasma implantation process. High voltage nitrogen glow discharges were obtained with simultaneous ion implantation using the Blumlein pulser as a single source. By using this pulser the obtained results for implanted silicon samples have indicated that N 2 + ion penetration depths increase with higher applied voltages and treatment times. Unfortunately, depth values are much less than the predicted by the SRIM (Stopping & Range of Ions in Matter) simulation mainly due to the short pulse duration. The basic reason is that the pulse peak duration obtained (800 ns) is of the order of the acceleration & implantation times for the ions coming from plasma sheath formed around the treated sample. Increasing pulse duration of the Blumlein system to encourage its use in aluminum and polymer treatments is a possibility that we are exploring. For this, we are redesigning our pulser to obtain longer pulse duration of the order of 5 µs. The drawbacks of this new design are the reduced nominal voltage characteristic of 60 kV and the necessity of charging the cables up to 30 kV, although in practice (as the generator structure is in air) corona discharges have limited the output voltage up to 50 / 60 kV for repetition rates of ~ 100 Hz used in our treatments.

Therefore, using satellite observation to monitor rivers and streams becomes a promising and necessary technique as the data processing algorithm has been developed and the data is more accessible. In the past two decades, altimetry satellites that were used to observe open ocean had been studied for investigating inland water bodies. The altimetry waveform needs to be carefully retracked in order to identify the water signal in a series of radar echoes.

We consider methods for the de novo design of universal rotation pulses, applied specifically {{but not limited to}} refocusing pulses. Broadband inversion pulses that rotate all magnetization components 180 degrees about a given fixed axis are necessary for refocusing and mixing in high-resolution NMR spectroscopy. The relative merits of various methodologies for generating pulses suitable for broadband refocusing are considered. The de novo design of 180 degrees universal rotation pulses (180 degrees(UR)) using optimal control can provide improved performance compared to schemes which construct refocusing pulses as composites of existing pulses. The advantages of broadband universal rotation by optimized pulses (BURBOP) are most evident for pulse design that includes tolerance to RF inhomogeneity or miscalibration. Nearly ideal refocusing is possible over a resonance offset range of +/- 170 % relative to the <b>nominal</b> <b>pulse</b> B- 1 field, concurrent with tolerance to B- 1 inhomogeneity/miscalibration of +/- 33 %. We present new modifications of the optimal control algorithm that incorporate symmetry principles (S-BURBOP) and relax conservative limits on peak RF pulse amplitude for short time periods that pose no threat to the probe. We apply them to generate a set of low-power 180 degrees(BURBOP) pulses suitable for widespread use in C- 13 spectroscopy on the majority of available probes. A quantitative measure for the B reduced spectral phase error provided by these symmetry principles is also derived. For pulses designed according to this symmetry, refocusing phase errors are virtually eliminated upon application of EXOR-CYCLE or an equivalent G- 180 degrees(S-BURBOP) -G gradient sandwich, independent of resonance offset and RF inhomogeneity.

40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{identification}} of the two-phase fuel flow model in the intake manifold for a spark ignition engine is approached. The dynamic model is part of an integrated system of models with hierarchical structure, ranging from phenomenological to neural network approaches, for the analysis and the optimal design of engine control strategies in automotive engines, which is actually in use by a major automotive supplier. Two different techniques for the estimation of model parameters are compared: i) classical l ast square method and ii) a Kalman filtering approach. The former approach requires a set of off-line identifications performed through the generation of air-fuel ratio transients for each engine operating condition. Model parameters are then identified via inverse modeling approach using non linear least square techniques and stored in a look-up table in the ECU. The second technique consists in the design of a non-linear observer based on an extended Kalman filter. This latter approach can be applicable in on-line operations in order to estimate both states and parameters of the dynamic model. The study has been performed on a set of 35 air-fuel ratio dynamic transients generated on a dynamic test bench for a spark ignition Alfa Romeo 1. 4 litres with 4 cylinders, equipped with a IAW multi-point ECS. A train of square waves has been imposed on the <b>nominal</b> injection time <b>pulse</b> width in order to generate the air-fuel ratio strength excursions. Both techniques allow to predict the observed values with good accuracy, consistently with the physical processes occurring in the region interested by the fuel injection. The results obtained from the two techniques are discussed and compared, and the emerging advantages of the Kalman filtering approach are shown. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{design of}} the {{interior}} portions of the Dual Axis Radiographic Hydrodynamic Test (DARHT) Facility incorporated shielding and controls {{from the beginning of}} the installation of the Accelerators. The purpose of the design and analysis was to demonstrate the adequacy of shielding or to determine the need for additional shielding or controls. Two classes of events were considered: (1) routine operation defined as the annual production of 10, 000 2000 -ns pulses of electrons at a nominal energy of 20 MeV, some of which are converted to the x-ray imaging beam consisting of four <b>nominal</b> 60 -ns <b>pulses</b> over the 2000 -ns time frame, and (2) accident case defined as up to 100 2000 -ns pulses of electrons accidentally impinging on some metallic surface, thereby producing x rays. Several locations for both classes of events were considered inside and outside of the accelerator hall buildings. The analysis method consisted of the definition of a source term for each case studied and the definition of a model of the shielding and equipment present between the source and the dose areas. A minimal model of the fixed existing or proposed shielding and equipment structures was used for a first approximation. If the resulting dose from the first approximation was below the design goal (1 rem/yr for routine operations, 5 rem for accident cases), then no further investigations were performed. If the result of the first approximation was above our design goals, the model was refined to include existing or proposed shielding and equipment. In some cases existing shielding and equipment were adequate to meet our goals and in some cases additional shielding was added or administrative controls were imposed to protect the workers. It is expected that the radiation shielding design, exclusion area designations, and access control features, will result in low doses to personnel at the DARHT Facility...|$|R
40|$|Steel {{plates are}} widely used {{in a variety of}} civil {{engineering}} applications for load bearing structural components, due to their favourable strength to weight ratio. Many of these plates have openings that are commonly used for reducing weight, access for utilities or for inspection in shipping and offshore installations. However the influence of these openings to the structural component’s robustness and resilience against blast loading is relatively unknown, with limited research conducted in this subject to date. Due to the high costs associated with offshore facilities they are typically very congested. This coupled with the producing, processing, storing and transporting of hydrocarbon materials means that explosions and subsequent fires are major hazards with severe consequences. In the event of an explosion, the blast load will initially impact the secondary structure (large spanning plated sections) and then transfer through to the primary structure, highlighting their critical consideration in safety assessments. Plated structures are also known to cause confinement, which in turn will results in higher overpressures, making the consequences of an event more severe. The aim of this research was to investigate the combined influence that openings have on the overpressure and the structural response of thin ductile plates subjected to extreme dynamic transverse loads. This was achieved by conducting a set of well-defined experiments investigating the response of 1 / 8 scale (0. 5 m square) mild steel plates with openings subjected to pulse pressure loading. Six central (scaled) openings were considered; circular (50, 75 and 100 mm) and extended circular (50 by 75, 75 by 100 and 100 by 125 mm) representative of typical offshore and shipping applications. Each plate design was assessed with two boundary conditions (restrained and non-restrained) and two nominal loading conditions. The boundary conditions adopted in this study allowed the response to be bounded, and enabled them to be practicably modelled in FEA-analyses and in the simplified analytical approaches. A pulse pressure test facility was used to generate <b>nominal</b> <b>pulse</b> pressure loads (25 and 50 psi) applied over a time (100 to 200 + ms load duration) representative of extreme explosion loading conditions offshore. All plates exhibited a mode I type failure (large inelastic deformation) highlighting the large reserve strength in such members. The work has shown that the inclusion of an opening...|$|E
40|$|A Q-switched Nd:YAG laser is used {{to remove}} ballpoint pen ink from 'Roma', a 100 % cotton rag art paper. The laser was {{operated}} at 1064 run, pulse duration 87 ns, and using a nominal fluence of 41 ± 12 Jcm- 2. By shortening the pulse length (63 and 26 ns), using a Glan-Thompson prism the ink removal threshold was reduced to 24 ± 7 and 20 ± 6 Jcm- 2 respectively. The physical damage to the paper is observed under SEM and found to be less disruptive to the surface fibres than contemporary mechanical methods of ink removal; scalpel and eraser. The tensile strength of laser treated paper is measured and found to remain unaffected below ink removal threshold fluences, although there is an increased tendency to tear at laser treatment sites. Repeat testing with artificially aged laser treated samples shows a marked decrease in tensile strength in comparison with an aged reference. Laser treated paper (nominal fluence of 41 ± 12 Jcm 2, pulse length 87 ns) is tested for evidence of thermal degradation, via oxidation and depolymerisation. The tests include the Russell effect test {{for the presence of}} peroxides (oxidation), the methylene blue test for the presence of carboxyl groups (oxidation), FTIR spectroscopy to determine the presence of carboxyl, carbonyl, and conjugated groups (oxidation), and GC/MS to test for the presence of sugars (depolymerisation). The tests suggest that there is thermal degradation predominantly via depolymerisation. This is supported by repetition of the tests on laser treated samples prepared in an argon atmosphere. The laser treated paper is subjected to accelerated ageing in a humid oven to simulate natural {{is considered to be a}} reaction between the sizing agent (gelatin) and sugars formed during depolymerisation The tests are repeated on 'Roma' paper laser treated with shorter laser <b>pulses</b> (<b>nominal</b> fluence 24 ± 7 and 20 ± 6 Jcm- 2, pulse durations of 63 and 26 ns), and this is found to have significantly less physical and chemical effect on the paper. Accelerated ageing of short pulse laser treated samples did not result in colour changes with respect to reference samples, indicating a more limited chemical interaction with the paper.
