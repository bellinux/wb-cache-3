40|$|CSIRO 2008 Canola is an {{important}} crop in southern Australia, where it is used {{as part of the}} crop rotation to manage cereal diseases, improve wheat yields, and assist in integrated weed management programs. The potential release of herbicide-tolerant transgenic cultivars into Australia has raised concerns that volunteer canola may itself become an uncontrollable weed. This study examined the persistence of the canola seedbank in farmer-managed fields in 3 geographical areas of the South Australian cropping region for up to 3. 5 years after the last canola crop was grown. In total, 66 fields from minimum- and <b>no-tillage</b> <b>farms</b> were sampled for number of canola seed/m 2 and the percentage of those that germinated. ANOVA analysis indicated that time since the last harvest and cultivation method were both significant factors affecting the number of seed/m 2 present. Neither time since harvest nor cultivation method was significant for number of germinated canola seeds, although time since harvest approached significance at the 5 % level. This demonstrates that the canola seedbank and the number of volunteers decline rapidly in managed cropping systems in southern Australia. Therefore, it is unlikely that herbicide-tolerant canola will become a major weed if volunteers are managed carefully. Jeanine Baker and Christopher Presto...|$|R

Hence, this paper presents in the first step a sensitivity analysis for conservation management parameters (specifically tillage depth, mechanical soil mixing efficiency, biological soil mixing efficiency, curve number, Manning's roughness coefficient for overland flow, USLE support practice factor, and filter strip width) in the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). With this analysis we aimed to improve model parameterisation and calibration efficiency. In contrast to less sensitive parameters such as tillage depth and mixing efficiency we parameterised sensitive parameters such as curve number values in detail. In the second step the analysis consisted of varying management practices (conventional tillage, conservation tillage, and no-tillage) for different crops (spring barley, winter barley, and sugar beet) and varying operation dates. Results showed that the model is very sensitive to applied crop rotations and in some cases even to small variations of management practices.

There are conflicting reports regarding impacts of ST {{and a lack}} of knowledge around when, where and how ST is implemented to maximise its benefits without impacting negatively on soil and environment. We established 14 experiments during 2012 – 2015 on farms with long-term history of continuous NT to (i) quantify the associated risks and benefits to crop productivity, soil and environmental health and (ii) explore key factors that need to be considered in decisions to implement ST in an otherwise NT system. Results showed that introduction of ST reduced weed populations and improved crop productivity and profitability in the first year after tillage, with no impact in subsequent 4  years. Soil properties were not impacted in Vertosols; however, Sodosols and Dermosols suffered short-term negative soil health impacts (e. g. increased bulk density). A Sodosol and a Dermosol also posed higher risks of runoff and associated loss of nutrients and sediment during intense rainfall after ST. The ST reduced plant available water in the short term, which could result in unreliable sowing opportunities for the following crop especially in semi-arid climate that prevails in north-eastern Australia. The results show that generally, {{there were no significant differences}} in crop productivity and soil health between tillage implements and tillage frequencies between ST and NT.

40|$|Development of <b>no-tillage</b> (NT) <b>farming</b> has {{revolutionized}} agricultural {{systems by}} allowing growers to manage greater areas of land with reduced energy, labour and machinery inputs to control erosion, improve soil health and reduce greenhouse gas emission. However, NT farming systems {{have resulted in}} a build-up of herbicide-resistant weeds, an increased incidence of soil- and stubble-borne diseases and enrichment of nutrients and carbon near the soil surface. Consequently, there is an increased interest in the use of an occasional tillage (termed strategic tillage, ST) to address such emerging constraints in otherwise-NT farming systems. Decisions around ST uses will depend upon the specific issues present on the individual field or farm, and profitability and effectiveness of available options for management. This paper explores some of the issues with the implementation of ST in NT farming systems. The impact of contrasting soil properties, the timing of the tillage and the prevailing climate exert a strong influence on the success of ST. Decisions around timing of tillage are very complex and depend on the interactions between soil water content and the purpose for which the ST is intended. The soil needs to be at the right water content before executing any tillage, while the objective of the ST will influence the frequency and type of tillage implement used. The use of ST in long-term NT systems will depend on factors associated with system costs and profitability, soil health and environmental impacts. For many farmers maintaining farm profitability is a priority, so economic considerations are likely to be a primary factor dictating adoption. However, impacts on soil health and environment, especially the risk of erosion and the loss of soil carbon, will also influence a grower’s choice to adopt ST, as will the impact on soil moisture reserves in rainfed cropping systems...|$|R
40|$|No-tillage {{and reduced}} tillage are {{considered}} sustainable options of conservation tillage. While US organic farming researchers {{have focused on}} <b>no-tillage,</b> European organic <b>farming</b> researchers have concentrated on reduced tillage through the reduction of tillage depth or the application of noninversion tillage practices. Combinations of these two approaches have been implemented {{by the use of}} the two-layer plow or the layer cultivator. These innovations often came from farmers, aiming at reducing off-farm inputs such as fuel, and saving costs and labor, {{while at the same time}} building up soil fertility. Systematic, documented research on reduced tillage systems in Europe started only 1 - 2 decades ago, with experiments in Germany, Switzerland and France. While most experiments mimic stockless farms, other experiments include fodder crops such as grass-clover ley and applications of manure and slurry as is typical for mixed farms with animals and crops. Soil organic carbon, microbial activity and soil structure are often improved in the upper soil layer under reduced tillage compared with plowed soils. However, these positive findings were confounded by lower yields in some cases and enhanced weed pressure, except for the two-layer plow. Often it was not possible to determine whether and to what extent yield reduction was due to weed competition or to nitrogen shortage, because of retarded nitrogen mineralization in spring in reduced tillage systems. In systems with manure use, also higher soil fertility measures concomitant with increased yields were reported under reduced tillage. Indeed, it is difficult to gain an overview on research activities dealing with reduced tillage in organic farming in Europe due to dispersed experimental infrastructures and the scarcity of peer-reviewed published literature.

The experiment was conducted in a randomized block design with six repetitions and five treatments, consisting of three soil covers in an organic no-tillage system, and an organic and a conventional system, both without soil cover. The treatments with soil cover used a grass species represented by the black oat, a leguminous species represented by the white lupine, and intercropping between both species.

The objective {{of this study was to}} ascertain if soil properties, and crop (Brassica campestis x Brassica napus cv "Pasja" followed by wheat Triticum aestivum cv "Kohika") establishment and yield on land converted from a conventionally tilled system to a no-tillage system could be improved by various subsoiling and mole plough operations. Plots on a Milson silt loam (Argillic Perch-Gley Pallic Soil) (Typic Ochraqualf) were paraplowed (PP), straight-legged subsoiled (SL), mole ploughed (M) or were left as non-subsoiled controls (C) in the autumn of 1997. Forage brassica was then sown with a Cross-Slot™ no-tillage drill. Wheat was established on the same plots with the same no-tillage drill in the spring of 1997. Subsoiling initially reduced soil strength by a significant amount. Shortly after subsoiling cone indices showed disruption to 300 mm with PP, 350 mm with SL and 100 mm with M. At the same time, approximately 20 % of profile cone indices from subsoiled treatments were greater than 2 MPa, compared to approximately 52 % for C and M. At 267 days after subsoiling, PP continued to have lower cone index values than C and M. Subsoiling initially reduced bulk density. When measured in May, the bulk density of PP plots was significantly lower than SL, M and C although reconsolidation in all plots was observed in February 1998 after the wheat was harvested. Air permeability in PP, SL and M was significantly greater than in C. Despite the differences in soil strength and bulk density (but not air permeability), subsoiling and mole ploughing did not produce differences in plant populations or yield for either the winter brassica or spring-sown wheat crops. The lack of any differences for brassica crop performance criteria were in spite of the vertical rooting depth being greater in the PP treatment. The lack of differences in plant establishment and yield was thought to be due to the relatively dry autumn and winter soil conditions and the use of the Cross-Slot™ no-tillage opener which is reported to be tolerant of variable soil conditions...|$|R

In this study, a series of topographic and soil surveys was carried out on a microcatchment of 6. 7 ha in a mountainous area under <b>no-tillage</b> <b>farming</b> with bare soil in order to examine spatial and temporal results produced by RUSLE. GPS measurements of the microrelief height differences were used in a control area in the microcatchment to compare observed erosion and deposition with RUSLE predictions.

Secondly, a time series of daily rainfall data was used to calculate annual erosivity values, which were fitted to an appropriate distribution function. It was determined that the rainfall distribution best fitted the Pearson type III distribution function. Next, efforts were made to quantify the long term erosion and to check the suitability of the land-use and management under different thresholds of tolerance.

40|$|Of all {{the plant}} nutrients, {{nitrogen}} {{has been subjected}} to the most extensive study. The amount of inorganic nitrogen in the soil is small while the quantity needed annually by crops is comparatively large. Of the macronutrients usually applied in commercial fertilizers, nitrogen seems to have the quickest and most pronounced effect on plant growth. In applying the nitrogen fertilizer for crop use, one must be concerned with placement, form, and availability, and with keeping the fertilizer where it is placed throughout the critical part of the growing season. The nitrogen supply molded by non-leguminous plants is of extreme importance and its availability is {{complicated by the fact that}} nitrogen in soils is easily converted into forms which are more or less mobile and available. The time of application of nitrogen fertilizer can significantly affect its availability. It commonly is applied in either the spring or fall in row crop culture. Under our climatic conditions, nitrogen applied in the fall tends to be lost by denitrification and leaching over the winter period, and the practice is not economical. There are also disadvantages associated with spring application of nitrogen. Application is needed at a time when the farmer is extremely busy and where the soil may be too wet to support the application equipment. <b>No-tillage</b> <b>farming,</b> which is relatively new, apparently increases the rate of nitrogen movement through the soil profile. No-tillage results in a mulch of dead plant material on the surface. The mulch tends to keep more moisture in the soil.

The pyrolysis allowed the identification of five groups of compounds in the residues: guaiacyl moieties in lignin (Lg), syringyl moities in lignin (Ls), polysaccharide (Ps), chlorophyll (Chl) and fatty acid (Fa) derivatives. The decomposition rates of the plant residues ranged from 4. 7 to 5. 9 g kg- 1 day- 1, with a mean value of 5. 2 g kg- 1 day- 1, corresponding to a mean loss of 41 % (37 - 47 %) of the initial biomass after 80 days of incubation. The Ps and lignin contents were strongly affected by incubation; relative lignin content increased at the expense of polysaccharide derivatives. In the original samples, Ps was the principal group of organic compounds in green manure plant materials, with maximum values in blue and white lupine (67 %); after incubation, Ps fractions decreased by 26 - 51 % (average 40 %), with the greatest value observed with mucuna and the lowest in white lupine. In soybean plant material the Ps fraction decreased only by 9 %. Greater increases in relative lignin content were observed with Ls (156 %) than with Lg (59 %) derivatives, demonstrating that guaiacyl moieties are easier to biochemically degrade than syringyl moieties. A significant correlation between residue-weight loss and organic groups after 80 days incubation was only found with Ls. Plant materials showing a higher content of syringyl moieties after decomposition might aid in increasing soil organic matter.

We used the EPIC model to simulate the interactive effect of climate change, CO 2 enrichment, soil management (conventional tillage—CT vs. no tillage—NT) and two crop rotations, durum wheat–sunflower and durum wheat–maize, on crops yields and SOC in central Italy. The model was calibrated using soil and crop yield data collected from a long-term field experiment run in central Italy with CT and NT treatments. Maize and sunflower grain yields were significantly reduced by NT, primarily because of poor establishment, while durum wheat was almost not affected by tillage treatments. Projected durum wheat (Dw) and maize (Ma) grain yields were negatively affected by climate change (up to − 25 % and − 10 % respectively) while sunflower (Sf) yield increased. Tillage effects appear {{to be the most important}} factor in sequestering/releasing C. No-tillage practices sequestered in all profile (0 – 100 cm depth) from 0. 03 to 0. 2 t ha - 1 y − 1 in 30 years, depending on climate scenario and plant C input, while conventional tillage (CT) led to massive C loss rates (up to − 0. 9 t ha − 1 y − 1). Beyond all uncertainties in the use of models, the results demonstrated that soil tillage and, to a certain extent, crop rotation, can play a relevant role in reducing (NT) or reinforcing (CT) the impact of climate change on SOC. <b>No-tillage</b> <b>farming,</b> if sufficient C input is ensured by the cropping system, could effectively contribute to increase soil C sequestration in Mediterranean rainfed environments...|$|E
40|$|International audienceEarthworm bioturbation, a {{biological}} process that strongly influences soil structure dynamics, is attracting more interest {{with the development}} of <b>no-tillage</b> <b>farming.</b> However, while methods for Visual Soil Structure Assessment (VSSA) are of great use to agronomists working to improve crop management and preserve soil structure, few methods have indicators that consider earthworm biostructures. One reason is that VSSA methods were initially created for conventional tillage systems, where tillage and compaction are the main drivers of soil structure over time, while bioturbation is a secondary driver. However, bioturbation is now recognised as an important process for soil functioning under no-tillage and reduced tillage systems. Among biostructures, the presence of burrows is one frequently-used indicator, but casts are rarely studied in the field, except in the "Soil-Structure Patterns" method (SSP), which provides a typology of soil structure that includes earthworm features. However the SSP typology appears complex (11 patterns), and implementing the method is time consuming. To improve VSSA methods, we identified patterns to define new indicators of earthworm bioturbation. We first assessed whether the patterns identified were useful for highlighting the real impact of bioturbation on the distribution of soil structures and the impact of tillage on earthworm activity. We then applied the pattern descriptions to the "profil cultural" method, which provides a detailed assessment of soil structure in the soil profile. This study was performed at two experimental sites in France experiencing different types of soil impacts (i. e. tillage, compaction). Identifying patterns in soil morphological units helped us to define four types of bioturbation: (1) type 0 : no visible bioturbation; (2) type 1 : presence of burrows; (3) type 2 : presence of a few fresh cast aggregates; and (4) type 3 : high presence of casts in different welded states. This new typology seemed relevant and complementary to typical indicators. When applied to the "profil cultural" method, these bioturbation indicators can improve the assessment of the soil structure usually provided by VSSA methods and provide more accurate information to agronomists and farmers about soil functioning, including biological activities.

40|$|Reduced tillage (RT) {{management}} may {{increases the}} top soil organic carbon (SOC) mainly by increasing labile organic matter (OM) in particular {{due to a}} reduction of the mixing of freshly added OM in the soil and due to enhanced physical protection of particulate organic matter (POM) inside the micro-aggregates. However, most previous studies through-out the literature have focused on true or nearly complete <b>no-tillage</b> <b>farming</b> systems with cereal based monocultures and experimental data is absent for cereal-root crop rotations. We here investigated the effect of reduced tillage (RT) on the storage and distribution of SOC and soil organic nitrogen (SON) over different soil fractions in loess arable silt soils under temperate climate. We collected top soil samples (0 - 10 cm) from three pairs of adjacent reduced and conventional tilled (CT) fields located at Heestert, Court-St-Etienne and Villers-le-Bouillet (Belgium). These soil samples were physically fractionated according to two different methodologies, i. e. a microaggregate isolation method and a ultrasonication-sedimentation method in order to separate SOM into fractions. RT management {{was found to be}} effective in increasing the OC and ON content of the top soil (0 - 10 cm) at these three sites. Physical fractionation showed that while the free particulate OC and ON can be increased by up to 70 % by adopting RT management, findings from these experiments suggest a modest increase in the relative contribution of free POM under the typical arable crop rotations in Western Europe. Furthermore the intra-microaggregate OM accounted up to 50 % of the difference in one out of the three experiments investigated here. However, in the other two field experiments we measured no accumulation of iPOM and this may be attributed to the repeated disturbance of soil by harvest of the root crop (sugar beat or potato). It is concluded that under Western European arable cereal-root crop rotations RT systems do not result in the storage of more SOC and SON in the entire soil profile within a 5 – 20 year period, but rather, redistribution towards more labile OM in the top layer (0 - 10 cm) takes place...|$|E

40|$|<b>No-tillage</b> <b>farming</b> {{systems or}} no-till, as {{an aspect of}} {{conservation}} farming, are actively promoted by international research and development organizations to conserve soils and by this, ensure food security, biodiversity and water conservation. Instead of tilling before seeding, seeds are deposited directly into untilled soil by opening a narrow slot trench or band. Today, it is also seen as mitigation and adaptation option and thus being promoted as a measure to be supported under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). There are even many voices advocating no-till to benefit from any future and existing carbon market. But: Is no-till the solution to reduce the hunger {{in the world and}} to mitigate climate change? It has been proven that no-till can signifi cantly reduce soil erosion and conserve water in the soils. This is regarded as a basis for higher and more stable crop yields – but science shows that this is not necessarily true. Discouragingly, there are numbers of examples of no yield benefits or even yield reductions under no-till in developing countries, especially in the first up to ten years. However, particularly the crop yields are crucial for the food security of small-scale farmers and not whether a method is more efficient or not. Although humus can be enriched under no-tillage, the sequestration of soil carbon, is result of the accumulated organic matter in the topsoil, is restricted to the upper 10 cm of the soil. Compared with ploughing, no carbon benefi t – or even a carbon defi cit – has been found at soil depths below 20 cm. This is why no-till makes little or no contribution to carbon sequestration and does not prove to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in croplands. The quantifi cation of carbon sequestration rates under no-till are highly doubtful. Anyhow, it is very likely that emission reductions generated from no-till projects in developing countries would serve to offset emissions from he industry and transport sector in developed countries. Those well quantifi ed emissions from developed countries would thus be offset by uncertain reductions from agriculture projects. The overall aim of the UNFCCC – to avoid dangerous climate change – would be jeopardized. Even if no-till became a promising mitigation option, other environmental problems would remain. No-till farming systems often come along with the industrialization of agriculture with high inputs of agrochemicals. On the one hand, small-scale farmers are not skilled in handling such chemicals. On the other hand there remains a risk that they apply cheap chemicals, which persist long-term in the environment. Efforts should therefore be strengthened on how to combine sustainable production systems such as organic agriculture with no-till practices. To summarize, there are too many open questions and uncertainties concerning the impact of no-till on crop yields and carbon sequestration, so that no-till could not be sold as the solution for hunger reduction and adequate option to mitigate climate change but as an important part of integrated strategies. Therefore, we recommend keeping no-till and reduced till out of the carbon market unless reliable carbon offset quantifi cation and monitoring can be undertaken at reasonable cost...|$|E
40|$|No-tillage is {{considered}} as a promising alternative for tillage-based conventional farming, by saving energy-input and time, reducing groundwater pollution and counteracting soil erosion and losses of the soil-organic matter. However, in the recent past, no-tillage farmers in Southwest Germany repeatedly reported problems particularly in winter wheat production, characterized by stunted plant growth in early spring, chlorosis, impaired fine root development and increased disease susceptibility. These symptoms were particularly apparent on field sites with long-term (&# 8805; 10 years) no-tillage history (LT) but not on adjacent short-term (&# 8804; 2 years) no-tillage plots (ST). The effects could be reproduced in pot experiments under controlled conditions, with soils collected from the respective field sites in five different locations, providing a basis for causal analysis. The expression of damage symptoms in pot experiments with sieved soils, excluded differences in soil compaction, induced by long-term <b>no-tillage</b> <b>farming</b> as a potential cause. Soil analysis revealed higher levels of soil organic matter in the topsoil, as expected for LT field sites and no apparent mineral nutrient deficiencies, both, on LT and ST soils. However, phosphate (P) deficiency was characteristic for plants grown on LT soils. Obviously, this {{was caused by the}} limited acquisition of sparingly soluble soil P, due to impaired root development but not by low P availability on LT soils. In four out of five cases, gamma-ray soil sterilization did not affect the expression of plant damage symptoms on LT soils, excluding pathogen effects as a major cause. Soil application of biochar, at a rate of 5 % (v/v), rapidly restored plant growth on LT soils, detectable already during the first week after sowing. This finding points to the presence of a phytotoxic compound since binding of soil xenobiotics by biochar is well documented. Accumulation of allelopathic compounds, originating from crop residues and root exudates remaining in the topsoil, is a problem related to <b>no-tillage</b> <b>farming,</b> particularly in cases of limited crop rotations or in monocultures, which also applied to the investigated field sites. However, a specific wheat auto-allelopathic effect is unlikely, since similar crop damage was also observed in soybean, sunflower, oilseed rape and various cover crops. Typical for allelopathic effects, in the pot experiments, plant damage symptoms in winter wheat appeared rapidly during emergence and early seedling development. However, under field conditions, germination and early growth were usually not affected, and symptoms were first detectable during re-growth in early spring. Moreover, damage symptoms disappeared when soil sampling was performed in summer instead of early spring, suggesting degradation of the toxic compound, which is also not compatible with the hypothesis of long-term accumulation of allelopathic compounds. The observed temporal pattern of plant damage rather resembled residual effects, occasionally observed after application of certain herbicides with soil activity (e. g., sulfonylureas, propyzamide). Therefore, a systematic survey of herbicide residues was conducted for topsoils on six pairs of LT and ST-field sites. Characteristic for <b>no-tillage</b> <b>farming,</b> glyphosate was the only herbicide, commonly and regularly used on all investigated field sites. The soil analysis revealed higher levels of glyphosate residues on all investigated LT, soils as compared with directly neighboured ST plots. Particularly on LT plots with strong expression of plant damage symptoms, high concentrations of glyphosate (2 - 4 mg kg- 1 soil), and of its metabolite AMPA were detected in the 10 cm topsoil layer. This concentration range is characteristic for residual levels, usually observed several days after glyphosate applications but was still detectable in early spring, six months after the last glyphosate treatment, while only trace concentrations below the detection limit (0. 05 mg kg- 1 soil) were found in ST soils. Coinciding with the declining plant damage potential, residual glyphosate and AMPA concentrations on LT plots declined during the vegetation period until early summer. No comparable pattern was detectable for residues of other herbicides, such as pendimethalin and propyzamide. Degradation of glyphosate residues in soils correlates with microbial activity. Accordingly, reduced soil respiration as an indicator for microbial activity was detected in four out of five cases in soil samples collected from LT field sites, suggesting delayed glyphosate degradation as compared with ST plots. Due to rapid adsorption, glyphosate usually exhibits extremely limited soil activity. However, at least trace concentrations of glyphosate and AMPA (1. 5 - 3. 5 µg L- 1) were detectable also in the potentially plant-available, water-soluble phase in spring samples, collected from LT field plots with high potential for plant damage. Nutrient solution experiments, with 3 - 6 weeks exposure of winter wheat to the residual herbicide concentrations detected in the LT soil solution, revealed the development of chlorosis and similar to soil experiments, a 30 %- 50 % reduction in fine root production, which surprisingly was mainly induced by AMPA {{and to a lesser extent}} by glyphosate itself. Accordingly, both, in hydroponics and LT soil experiments, the plant damage symptoms were not associated with shikimate accumulation in the root tissue as a physiological indicator for glyphosate but not for AMPA toxicity. The dominant role of AMPA toxicity also became apparent by the fact that, both, glyphosate resistant (GR) and non-resistant (NR) soybean plants were affected on LT no-tillage soils since transgenic GR plants are not resistant to AMPA. A preliminary RNAseq gene expression analysis of the root tissue just prior to the appearance of visible plant damage symptoms, revealed down-regulation of genes involved in general stress responses, down-regulation of aquaporin genes (PIPs and TIPs) with functions in water uptake and root elongation, down-regulation of ethylene-related genes but up-regulation of cytokinin-related gene expression indicating interferences with hormonal balances. These changes in gene expression patterns relative to the untreated control were detected in plants treated with AMPA and glyphosate+AMPA but not with glyphosate alone. The findings suggest that long-term exposure to subtoxic levels of AMPA, as major glyphosate metabolite temporally accumulated in LT no-tillage soils, can finally interfere with metabolic processes essential for normal root development. A series of pot and field experiments were initiated to test the potential of selected commercial formulations of plant growth-promoting microorganisms, based on strains of Pseudomonas sp., Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, and Trichoderma harzianum, for mitigation of plant stress symptoms, expressed on LT no-tillage field sites in spring. For members of the selected microbial genera, root growth-promoting effects, pathogen suppression, and glyphosate degradation potential have been reported. Unfortunately, plant growth promotion was detectable only on ST soils but was not successful on LT plots, both, in pot and field experiments, probably related to limited root development for microbial colonization and early summer drought under field conditions. As an alternative approach, incorporation of pyrolysis biochar from woody substrates at a rate of 5 % (v/v) to the top 10 cm soil layer of LT soils, equivalent to approx. 35 t ha- 1, were able to restore plant growth completely in pot experiments and protected wheat plants from glyphosate overdose applications (up to 8 L Roundup Ultramax® ha- 1), even on artificial substrates with low potential for glyphosate adsorption. As a short-term mitigation strategy, field-testing with different biochar concentrations is recommended. During the last two years, farmers also modified their no-tillage management strategies on the investigated field sites by introducing more variable crop rotations including, winter wheat, winter rape, maize and soybean and using mustard, pea, and Crotalaria as cover crops. Despite further annual applications of glyphosate (3 L ha- 1 of a 360 g ai L- 1 formulation), plant performance on the respective field sites was significantly improved. These observations suggest that limited crop rotation favored the development of a soil microflora with low degradation potential for glyphosate, leading to a decline in degradation rates of glyphosate soil residues and underline the importance of crop diversity management. Pfluglose Anbaumethoden werden oft als vielversprechende Alternative für Ackerbau mit wendender Bodenbearbeitung betrachtet, die zur Einsparung von Arbeitszeit und Energieverbrauch beitragen, der Grundwasserbelastung und Bodenerosion entgegenwirken und die Humusbilanz verbessern. In Direktsaatanbausystemen in Süddeutschland wurden jedoch in den letzten Jahren verstärkt Nachbauprobleme insbesondere beim Anbau von Winterweizen beobachtet, die sich in Wachstumsdepressionen, Chlorosen und Nekrosen, verminderter (Fein) -Wurzelbildung und lückiger Bestandesentwicklung der betroffenen Pflanzen äußern. Die Symptome wurden besonders deutlich auf langjährigen Direktsaatflächen (LT &# 8805; 10 Jahre) im Vergleich zu unmittelbar benachbarten Tauschflächen mit nur kurzzeitiger Direktsaatbewirtschaftung (ST &# 8804; 2 Jahre). Die Effekte konnten in Topfversuchen unter kontrollierten Bedingungen reproduziert werden und bieten so die Grundlage für eine Ursachenanalyse. Die Ausprägung von Schadsymptomen in Topfexperimenten mit gesiebten Böden schließt den Einfluss einer verstärkten Bodenverdichtung durch langzeitig pfluglose Bewirtschaftung als mögliche Ursache aus. Bodenanalysen ergaben erwartungsgemäß die, für LT Direktsaat typischen, erhöhten Gehalte an organischer Substanz aber keinen offensichtlichen Mangel an Pflanzennährstoffen. Jedoch wiesen Pflanzen auf LT Böden regelmäßig Phosphat (P) Mangel auf, was offensichtlich durch verschlechterte Aneignung des schwerlöslichen Phosphats in Folge des gehemmten Wurzelwachstums bedingt war. Bei vier von fünf LT Böden hatte eine Gamma-Sterilisierung des Bodens keinen Einfluss auf die Ausbildung von Schadsymptomen, was Krankheitserreger als Haupt-schadensursache ausschließt. Bodenapplikation von Biokohle (5 % v/v) verbesserte dagegen schnell das Pflanzenwachstum auf LT Böden, was bereits in der ersten Woche nach der Aussaat nachweisbar war. Diese Beobachtung deutet auf Bodenkontamination mit einer phytotoxischen Substanz hin, da für Biokohle die Bindung organischer Schadstoffe in Böden nachgewiesen ist. Die Akkumulation allelopathischer Substanzen im Oberboden, die aus Pflanzenrückständen und Wurzelexsudaten stammen, ist ein gut dokumentiertes Problem in Direktsaatsystemen, besonders bei engen Fruchtfolgen oder Monokulturen, was auch für die untersuchten Flächen zutraf. Allerdings ist ein Weizen-spezifischer Autoallelopathie-Effekt unwahrscheinlich, da Pflanzenschäden auch bei anderen Pflanzenarten wie Soja, Sonnenblume, Raps und Zwischenfruchtmischungen auftraten. Charakteristisch für allelopathische Effekte traten in Topfversuchen mit Winterweizen Schadsymptome schnell, schon während der frühen Keimlingsentwicklung auf. Unter Feldbedingungen war die Auflaufphase dagegen in der Regel nicht betroffen und Pflanzenschäden entwickelten sich erst zu Beginn der neuen Vegetationsperiode im zeitigen Frühjahr. Darüber hinaus verschwanden die Pflanzenschäden, wenn die Bodenproben für Topfversuche im Sommer und nicht im zeitigen Frühjahr genommen wurden, was auf einen Abbau der Schadsubstanz hinweist und nicht mit der Hypothese einer langfristigen Bodenakkumulation allelopathischer Substanzen erklärbar ist. Der beobachtete Zeitverlauf der Entwicklung von Schadsymptomen ähnelt eher den Nachbauproblemen, die unter bestimmten Bedingungen durch bodenaktive Herbizidrückstände, wie Sulfonylharnstoffe oder Propyzamid, ausgelöst werden können. Daher wurden in einer Übersichtsanalyse Herbizidrückstände im Oberboden auf sechs LT-, und ST-Standortpaaren untersucht. Charakteristisch für pfluglose Anbausysteme war Glyphosat das einzige Herbizid, das regelmäßig auf allen Standorten eingesetzt wurde. Die Bodenanalyse ergab durchgängig höhere Glyphosatrückstandswerte auf den LT Standorten im Vergleich zu den benachbarten ST-Plots. Auf LT-Flächen mit besonders starker Ausprägung von Schadsymptomen, wurden besonders hohe Rückstandskonzentrationen (2 - 4 mg kg- 1 Boden) gemessen, wie sie üblicherweise wenige Tage nach der Applikation auftreten, aber in diesen Fällen noch sechs Monate nach der letzten Glyphosatgabe nachweisbar waren, während die benachbarten ST Flächen nur Spurenkonzentrationen unterhalb der Nachweisgrenze aufwiesen. In Übereinstimmung mit dem abnehmenden Schadpotential der LT Böden, sank auch die Glyphosatrückstandsbelastung im Laufe der Vegetationsperiode zum Sommer hin ab. Für andere untersuchte Herrbizidwirkstoffe, wie Pendimethalin und Propyzamid, wurden keine vergleichbaren Verteilungsmuster gefunden. Glyphosatabbau in Böden korreliert mit der mikrobiellen Aktivität. Entsprechend war die Bodenatmung als Indikator für mikrobielle Aktivität bei vier von fünf untersuchten Standortpaaren auf den LT-Flächen im Vergleich zu den benachbarten ST-Plots herabgesetzt, was auf einen verlangsamten Glyphosatabbau auf LT Standorten schließen lässt. Aufgrund schneller Adsorption zeigt Glyphosat in der Regel keine oder nur sehr eingeschränkte Bodenaktivität. Allerdings waren auf LT Böden mit hohem Schadpotenzial, Glyphosat und AMPA zumindest in Spurenkonzentrationen (1. 5  3. 5 µg L- 1) auch in der wasserlöslichen und damit potenziell pflanzenverfügbaren Phase nachweisbar. Nährlösungsversuche mit Winterweizen, der über 3 - 6 Wochen den Herbizidspurenkonzentrationen, die in der LT Bodenlösung nachgewiesen wurden, ausgesetzt war, entwickelten Chlorosen und zeigten ähnlich wie bei den Bodenversuchen 30  50 % vermindertes Feinwurzelwachstum, was überraschenderweise in erster Linie durch AMPA und nicht durch die Glyphosatexposition verursacht wurde. Übereinstimmend wurde weder in Hydroponik-, noch in Bodenversuchen Shikimatakkumulation im Wurzelgewebe als spezifischer Indikator für Glyphosat-Toxizität nachgewiesen. Die bestimmende Rolle der Toxizität von AMPA wurde auch bei Topfversuchen mit Glyphosat-resistenten und nicht-resistenten Sojalinien deutlich, die in beiden Fällen Schadsymptome auf LT Böden ausbildeten, da transgene, Glyphosat-resistente Sojasorten nicht gleichzeitig resistent gegenüber AMPA-Toxizität sind. Eine erste RNAseq Genexpressionsanalyse im Wurzelgewebe, unmittelbar vor Ausbildung visueller Schadsymptome, ergab verminderte Expression von Genen der generellen Stressantwort, von Aquaporinen (PIPs und TIPs) mit Funktionen bei der Wasseraufnahme und beim Wurzelstreckungswachstum, von Genen des Ethylenstoffwechsels aber eine erhöhte Expression von Cytokinin-Genen, was auf Wechselwirkungen mit hormonellen Gleichgewichten hinweist. Diese Veränderungen der Genexpression relativ zur unbehandelten Kontrolle, wurden in Pflanzen mit AMPA-, und AMPA+Glyphosat-Exposition aber nicht bei ausschließlicher Glyphosatexposition nachgewiesen. Die Ergebnisse deuten darauf hin, dass Langzeitexposition gegenüber subtoxischen AMPA Konzentrationen, die besonders im Frühjahr in den Böden der LT Flächen als Folge des verzögerten Abbaus akkumulieren, zu Störungen von Stoffwechselfunktionen führt, die für die normale Wurzelentwicklung essentiell sind. In einer Reihe von Topfversuchen wurde das Potenzial ausgewählter, kommerzieller Formulierungen mikrobieller Pflanzenstärkungsmittel, basierend auf Stämmen von Pseudomonas sp., Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, und Trichoderma harzianum getestet, um die Stress-Symptome vom Pflanzen, die im Frühjahr auf LT Böden auftraten, zu vermindern. Für Vertreter der ausgewählten Mikroorganismengattungen sind Wurzelwachstumsstimulierung, Pathogen-Antagonismen und die Fähigkeit zum Glyphosatabbau dokumentiert. Unglücklicherweise trat eine Stimulierung des Pflanzenwachstums nur auf den ST Böden auf, während auf LT Böden, weder in Topfversuchen, noch im Feld, fördernde Effekte beobachtet wurden, was möglicherweise auf mangelnde Wurzelbesiedlung in Folge der Hemmung des Wurzelwachstuns und auf Frühsommertrockenheit im Feld zurückzuführen war. Als alternativer Ansatz, wurde die Einarbeitung einer Pyrolyse-Biokohle aus Holzabfällen getestet, die in Topfversuchen bei einer Applikationsdosis von 5 % (v/v) im Oberboden, entsprechend ca 35 t ha- 1, die Ausbildung von Schadsymptomen bei Winterweizen auf LT Böden komplett verhinderte und eine Schútzwirkung gegen Glyphosatüberdosierung (bis 8 L Roundup Ultramax ha- 1) sogar auf Substraten mit minimalem Adsorptionpotenzial vermittelte. Als mögliche kurzfristige Schutzmaßnahme ist daher die Untersuchung unter Feldbedingungen mit unterschiedlichen Biokohle-Applikationsdosen angeraten. Während der vergangenen beiden Jahre wurden Änderungen des Fruchtfolgemanagements auf den betreffenden Flächen eingeführt, mit vielfältigeren Fruchtfolgen, die Winterweizen, Winterraps, Mais und Crotolaria einschließen und auch Zwischenfruchtgemenge aus Erbsen und Gelbsenf getestet. Trotz weiterem, jährlichem Glyphsoateinsatz mit Aufwandmengen von 3 L ha- 1 einer 360 g ai L- 1 Formulierung, hat sich die Pflanzenentwicklung auf den betroffenen Flächen unzwischen signifikant verbessert. Diese Beobachtungen weisen darauf hin, dass die bislang praktizierten, engen Weizen/Raps Fruchtfolgen die Entwicklung einer Bodenmikroflora mit vermindertem Glyphosatabbaupotenzial begünstigt haben, was die Bedeutung eines Biodiversitäts-managements auch für Kulturpflanzen unterstreicht...|$|E
