50|$|Cattle races may be portable, {{or may be}} a {{permanent}} fixture with a concrete walkway. Portable races may be made of steel, iron or aluminium; but modern permanent ones are usually of steel or iron (sometimes timber or even concrete) which is usually set in concrete, with solid or railed sides and a <b>non-slip</b> <b>floor.</b> Anti-bruise races do not have sharp edges, and instead use pipe with rounded edges such as oval rails; alternatively sides with sheet iron or steel can be found or built onto the races, which improves livestock movement and also prevents injuries from animals getting their legs or heads caught between the rails. Races that have concrete floors have the flooring made wider than the race itself to prevent hooves catching between the bottom rail and {{the edge of the}} concrete. The concrete is also not smooth like that on city sidewalks but roughed out to give the animals more traction to prevent slipping and injury. Lower parts of the race have side panels that may be removable {{in the event of an}} animal becoming cast (fallen) or caught up in which the animal is needed to be freed to prevent further injury.|$|E

40|$|Both well-designed {{equipment}} and trained employees {{are required to}} maintain a high standard of animal welfare during slaughter. When McDonald's Corporation started auditing U. S. beef and pork slaughter plants in 1999, there were great improvements in handling and stunning. They used a numerical objective scoring system. It contained five basic measurements: (1) the percentage of animals stunned on the first attempt, (2) percentage rendered insensible prior to hoisting, (3) percentage vocalizing during handling and stunning. (4) percentage that fall down and (5) percentage moved with an electric goad. Each variable was scored on a simple yes/no basis. Baseline data was collected prior to the McDonald's audits in 1996. The most striking improvements were in beef. The average effective first shot stunning score was 89. 5 % in 1996, 96. 2 % in 1999 and 98. 6 % 5 years later in 2003. The average percentage of cattle vocalizing during stunning and handling was 8 % in 1996, 2. 4 % in 1999 and 2. 0 % in 2003. A total of 50 plants were audited. Most plants were able to greatly improve welfare by improving stunner maintenance; installing <b>non-slip</b> <b>floor</b> gratings in stun boxes and better training. They also had to make simple, low cost changes to eliminate distractions that cause animals to balk and refuse to move. The most common ways to improve animal movement were: (1) install a lamp on a dark race entrance, (2) move ceiling lamps to eliminate sparkling reflections, (3) muffle air hissing, (4) install shields and solid sides on races to prevent animals from seeing moving people up ahead and (5) eliminate air drafts that blow {{in the faces of}} approaching animals. A major remaining problem area is in plants that are not in a program of yearly audits by restaurants. Serious animal abuse has occurred in some of these non-audited plants. 1...|$|E

40|$|Facilities {{designed}} for intensively raised animals trained to lead are {{not appropriate for}} handling extensively raised animals unaccustomed to close contact with people. The author provides information on facility design for both intensively and extensively raised livestock. <b>Non-slip</b> <b>flooring</b> in handling facilities is essential for all livestock. Cleats must be spaced on loading ramps for trucks or ships so that the hooves of the animals fit easily between them. Cleats spaced too far apart cause slipping and falling. In developing countries, building stationary ramps for vehicles of differing heights using concrete, wood or steel is recommended. Highly mechanised systems, such as hydraulic tailgate lifts, are not recommended in developing countries due to maintenance difficulties. The holding capacity for livestock shipping and receiving terminals should be designed to hold {{the largest number of}} animals handled on the busiest days. To maintain high standards of animal welfare, it is important to train employees to handle animals using methods to reduce stress and to conduct weekly audits of handling using an objective, numerical scoring system to maintain high welfare standards...|$|R
40|$|There {{are five}} basic causes of animal welfare {{problems}} in slaughter plants: 1. Poorly designed or improper stunning and handling equipment. 2. Distractions which impede animal movement, such as sparkling reflections on a wet floor, air hissing, high-pitched noise or air drafts blowing down the race towards approaching animals. These distractions can ruin {{the performance of}} a well designed system and cause animals to become excited. When this happens, prodding will be required to make them move. 3. Lack of employee training and poor supervision of employees by management. 4. Poor maintenance of equipment and facilities, such as malfunctioning stunners or worn, slick, floors which cause animals to slip and fall. 5. Poor condition of animals arriving at the plant, such as cripples and sick animals. Another problem is pigs and cattle from excitable genetic lines which are more likely to become agitated during handling To maintain a high standard of welfare, all five problem areas must be addressed. A survey of 29 Canadian slaughter plants indicated that 27 % had excellent <b>non-slip</b> <b>floors</b> and 21 % had slick floors which would cause animals to slip. Twenty-four percent had high pitched motor noise or hissing air exhausts that caused animals to balk. Air drafts blowing down the race toward approaching animals were a problem in 9 % of the plants.

40|$|Dissertation supervisor: Dr. Ruth Tofle. Includes vita. It is {{generally}} understood that many elders wish {{to remain at}} home during their final years. A long-occupied residence holds precious memories and feels secure. To that end, both researchers, designers, and care providers have concentrated efforts on identifying best practices for extending elders' independence and reducing risk of injury while remaining at home. Within aging-in-place literature, it has been increasingly acknowledged that home modifications [...] such as the addition of ramps, first-level toilet rooms, <b>non-slip</b> <b>flooring,</b> grab bars, and curb-less showers [...] can be effective means to reducing risks, and increasing independence. Within literature, study findings often report on corresponding improvements to functioning or reductions in trauma. Such research endeavors regard the home as a physical space in which to perform tasks. To begin to complete the picture within the knowledge base [...] particularly concerning the oldest-old living alone [...] this study shifts the emphasis from the oft-used intervention approach in aging-in-place research to one focusing on tangible environment-behavior transactions. Shifting away from regarding aging-in-place as a problem to be solved, a grounded theory approach aims to illuminate the experience through empathetic open-ended interviewing with the person's experience itself {{as the focus of}} inquiry. Ten participants between age 88 and 100 who lived alone were interviewed and observed in their homes over several sessions to explore what creative personal adaptations and modifications [...] related to use of space and interaction with elements of the home [...] elders themselves utilized to accommodate for diminished capabilities while living in the same, long-occupied residential setting. Building theory grounded in data, the research findings elucidated the remarkably adaptive nature of older people over time and revealed enduring attachments to home.

40|$|Problem statement: The splay leg {{syndrome}} {{is the major}} congenital cause of lameness in suckling piglets. It {{is characterized by a}} temporarily impaired functionality of the hind leg muscles immediately after birth, resulting in an ability to stand and walk. Etiology and pathogenesis is complex and remain still poorly understood. Approach: The aim of the present study is to perform the update information about the etiology, clinical signs and control strategies of the syndrome. Results: A sexaffected inheritance of the splay leg {{syndrome is}} assumed since higher frequencies have been observed in male piglets. Several biochemical and histomorphological investigations indicate an immaturity of the skeletal muscle in the affected piglets at birth. Splay leg is caused by a reduction of the axonal diameter and myelin sheath thickness of the fiber that innervate the hindlimb adductors. The existence of one or more major genes for congenital splay leg seems possible. Among the fragments strongly displayed in the splay leg muscle, are identified the porcine CDKN 3 gene. Various management and genetic factors have been connected with the etiology, such as the farrowing induction, low birth weight, short gestation lengths, slippery floors and breeds (e. g., Large White and Landrace). Moreover, nutrition can play a role to pathogenesis, as choline or methionine deficiency in sow diets and the fusarium toxicity. Furthermore, Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus (PRRSV) are also involved in etiological factors. Piglets suffering from splay leg should be kept in a warm place and be helped to take colostrums or artificial milk for 2 - 3 days. Conclusion: Management practices should be applied in order to be avoided the occurrence of splay leg syndrome, such as <b>non-slip</b> <b>floors,</b> use of anti-mycotoxins products in feed, avoiding the farrowing induction before day 113. Finally, a herd health management programme should be applied in order to prevent and control PRRSV infection. © 2012 Science Publications...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{multistage}} 20 m shuttle {{run test}} with 1 min stages (Léger et al. 1988) {{is a popular}} field test to predict maximal oxygen uptake (Tomkinson et al. 2000).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to assess programs, {{activities}} and facilities for physically handicapped students at Ball State University. Study participants included eighty-five individuals identified by University officials. Participants included fifty-six physically handicapped students, nine non-handicapped undergraduate students, ten administrators and ten faculty. Physically handicapped students were divided into seven disability groups including: (1) blind; (2) visually impaired; (3) deaf; (4) hearing impaired; (5) wheelchair confined; (6) limited ambulatory and (7) "other" disabilities. An interview assessment instrument was developed consisting of fifty items divided into five sections. Participants were interviewed for assessment of specific accommodations, general information, legislation, communication and attitudes concerning programs, activities and facilities for physically handicapped students at Ball State University. Fourteen trained interviewers conducted interviews with assigned participants. Physically handicapped students completed assessments from all five sections of the assessment instrument. Non-handicapped undergraduate students, administrators and faculty completed assessments from general information, legislation, communication and attitudes sections. Analyses of assessment data included-profile comparisons by number and percentage of participant responses. Response choices to assessment instrument items were: (1) a great degree; (2) moderate degree;(3) small degree; (4) none and (5) I don't know also collected from all study participants. The following summary of findings is based on analyses of assessment responses received from the study population. 1. University transportation services were not as useful for handicapped students as non-handicapped students. 2. Physical education facilities were not as useful for handicapped as for non-handicapped. 3. Intramural sports provisions were not adequate for handicapped participation. 4. Nobility impaired students reported difficulty with University door accommodations. 5. Blind and visually impaired reported a greater need for brail and auditory information in public places at the University. 6. Deaf and hearing impaired students reported a greater need for visual fire alarms and amplified telephones at the University. 7. Wheelchair confined, limited ambulatory and "other" disability students reported little convenience in use of University parking facilities. 8. Twenty of fifty-six handicapped students reported inconvenience in use of library card catalogs. 9. Six wheelchair confined, one limited ambualtory, one blind, one visually impaired and three "other" disability students reported a need for more appropriate University Health Services. 10. Handicapped students reported limited participation in social organizations and special interest groups. 11. Twenty-two percent of the handicapped reported a greater need in consideration of handicapped for employment at the University. 12. Limited ambulatory students reported a greater need for <b>non-slip</b> <b>floors</b> and surfaces at the University. 13. All but five handicapped participants were not familiar with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. 14. Participants reported that all institutions of higher education should be accessible to the handicapped. 15. Non-handicapped persons reported that handicapped students had more personal adjustment problems than non-handicapped students. 16. A greater number of handicapped than non-handicapped students reported that handicapped college graduates secure jobs as easily as non-handicapped college graduates. 17. Thirty-six percent of the handicapped students had no information on which to base an opinion concerning career and vocational counseling services at Ball State University. 18. Forty-seven percent of the handicapped students had no information on which to base an opinion concerning placement services at Ball State University. Study findings were dispersed to University officials for use in University accessibility development for the handicapped. Thesis (D. Ed. ...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Very {{often people}} with visual {{impairment}} have lost vision gradually, but the home has not changed to accommodate the new situation. There may be a mismatch between the home features and the person&# 146;s needs. There {{is a need to}} understand the person&# 146;s needs in their environmental context in order to ascertain what rehabilitation interventions such as assistive devices and home modification will be most useful. It is anticipated that people with Age- related macular degeneration (AMD) may have a number of perspectives, experiences and suggestions which if explored will assist in greater understanding and in communicating helpful coping strategies to others. Aim: To explore the perspective and experiences of people with AMD and their service providers to understand better, what home modifications and assistive devices may be most useful with respect to visual function and functional vision. Methods: This study employed mixed research methods (both qualitative and quantitative) of data collection and analysis. In the quantitative phase, visual function was measured and the functional vision of 31 participants with AMD was assessed using the Melbourne Low Vision Index (MLVI) to characterise the sample population. In the qualitative phase, data about their experiences with home modification were obtained from in-depth semi-structured individual interview with participants with AMD and a focus group interview was conducted with service providers to find out their experiences of delivery information related to home modification for people with MD. In addition, a pilot simulation study of AMD in a normally vision person using opaque pupil soft contact lens (OPSCL) was conducted in order to understand better the impact of central vision loss on visual function and functional vision and to explain its potential usefulness as an educational tool for home modification providers. Results: This research highlights a number of key themes. First, the most useful environmental modifications, as perceived by the participants with AMD, are handrails, <b>non-slip</b> <b>flooring,</b> colour contrast, high contrast stair nosing, single lever tap, lifts, magnification devices and sensor lighting. Second, lack of knowledge about available services may reduce functional performance in some activities. There was a lack of awareness among the participants with AMD that home modification services were available and useful indicating communication of this service must be improved. Service providers reported a lack of referral and follow-up systems with regards to low vision and home modification services for people {{with visual impairment}}. Third, this research confirmed results of previous studies on older people&# 146;s home environments that found that kitchens, steps and bathrooms were the areas perceived as particularly hazardous. Fourth, this research confirm that although functional vision is largely correlated with visual function, a reduction in visual acuity alone does not necessary lead to reduction in functional vision. Last, a guideline for useful home modifications for people with AMD was developed with the perspectives of participants with AMD that may be useful for other people with visual impairment. Conclusions: First, {{there is a need to}} differentiate usefulness of vision-related environmental modifications as a strategy to help people with AMD, as there is considerable variability in environmental interventions which were regarded as useful, which may be attributable to differences in AMD severity, attitude, knowledge about AMD and home modifications, level of visual impairment and co-morbidities. Second, vision-related environmental modification information that is better targeted to these variables may also benefit a wider range and level of people with visual impairment. Last, the significance of non-visual coping strategies on older people&# 146;s ability to manage activities of daily living independently need to be addressed by the instruments that measure functional vision, as individualised adaptive strategies are not well measured by current measurement instruments...|$|R
