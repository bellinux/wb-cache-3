40|$|Error {{diagnosis}} {{is becoming more}} difficult in VLSI circuit designs due to the increasing complexity. In this paper, we present an algorithm based on verification for improving the accuracy of design error diagnosis. This algorithm integrates three-valued logic simulation and Boolean satisfiability(SAT). It uses test patterns generated by gate level stuck-at fault ATPG tool for parallel pattern simulation, and uses SAT-based Boolean comparison to enhance the three-valued simulation, in which universally quantified conjunction normal formulas (CNF) represent the unknown constraints in the implementation with black boxes, and need <b>not</b> <b>circuit</b> structural transformation. Our approach can fast and efficiently eliminate many false candidates, experimental results on ISCAS' 85 circuits show the accuracy and the speed of this approach...|$|E

50|$|The Judiciary Act of 1789 {{established}} three circuits, {{which were}} groups of judicial districts in which United States circuit courts were established. Each circuit court {{consisted of two}} Supreme Court justices and the local district judge; the three circuits existed solely {{for the purpose of}} assigning the justices to a group of circuit courts. Some districts (generally the ones most difficult for an itinerant justice to reach) did <b>not</b> have a <b>circuit</b> court; in these districts the district court exercised the original jurisdiction of a circuit court. As new states were admitted to the Union, Congress often did <b>not</b> create <b>circuit</b> courts for them for a number of years.|$|R

40|$|Zero-suppressed Binary Decision Diagrams (ZBDDs) are data {{structures}} that represent sets e#ciently {{and they have}} recently been suggested for use in nonenumerative path delay fault (PDF) coverage calculations. Many heuristics have been proposed to order variables (representing primary inputs) in ZBDDs to avoid size explosion; however, in ZBDD-based PDF coverage calculations, the variables represent the nets in a <b>circuit,</b> <b>not</b> the <b>circuit</b> primary inputs. This fact motivates us to investigate new ordering strategies since the number of nets in a circuit is relatively large {{as compared to the}} number of primary inputs. Several new static ordering heuristics are proposed based on structural properties of the circuit undergoing PDF coverage calculations and are evaluated. The experimental results show that the new heuristics we propose greatly reduce the size of the ZBDDs...|$|R
