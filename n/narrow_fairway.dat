50|$|The {{turn for}} home at Aronimink begins with #10, a 454 yd par four that is {{considered}} by many the most demanding on the course. The <b>narrow</b> <b>fairway</b> is guarded by a bunker on the right and deep rough on the left. A successful approach shot must avoid the water hazard protecting the front left of the sharply terraced green.|$|E
50|$|Hole #8 is a 396-yard par 4 that {{is ranked}} the #1 most {{difficult}} {{hole on the}} scorecard. Woods and a creek line the entire left side from the tee to the green.

Just short of the green, yet another creek cuts through the <b>narrow</b> <b>fairway.</b> Birdies on this hole are not common. One should be happy to end up with a par.|$|E

50|$|The Kainantu course is/was a nine-hole {{course with}} {{two sets of}} tees to make for 18-hole game. The course was {{constructed}} along a number of ridge crests and so {{over the years the}} course has been a challenge to play. <b>Narrow</b> <b>fairways,</b> sloping roughs, small greens and nearby roads and gardens have made low course scoring rare. Par for the course for Club Members is 69 and for Associate Members 67. The lowest course score recorded was 61, shot by Randall Karcher from the Summer Institute of Linguistics.|$|R
50|$|While not {{considered}} lengthy at just over 6,500 yards, the architects' {{use of the}} natural terrain, barrancas, creeks, and hills, combined with small greens, extensive bunkering, <b>narrow</b> <b>fairways</b> with strategically designed landing areas, and prevailing westerly ocean breezes, the course presents a challenge for players of all levels. Members have taken great care in preserving the original design and routing of this masterpiece.

50|$|Great Chebeague Island is {{an island}} community, set on the eponymous island in Casco Bay, {{not far from the}} town of Yarmouth.

50|$|The {{club was}} formed in 1916 {{by a group of}} {{businessmen}} who had acquired the land a year earlier from a smaller, financially strained club. Renowned golf course designer A. W. Tillinghast was brought in to redesign the seven existing holes and construct 11 new ones. The course was completed in 1918 and the Tudor-styled clubhouse was built in 1923. In 1925, the purchase of additional property prompted the club to recommission Tillinghast to incorporate the new land into the existing course. The course has remained relatively unchanged since its construction. A few outdated bunkers were replaced in 1965. Between 1991 and 1993 all the bunkers were restored and several tees were added. Among its many noted features, the course has distinctly <b>narrow</b> <b>fairways.</b>|$|R
50|$|Norway {{announced}} in February 2012 that, {{in order to}} protect the islands from the danger of a ship running aground and possibly causing an oil spill within a pristine fjord, it would implement a requirement for cruise ships to carry a licensed pilot in order for the ship to enter any of the islands' fjords. Many of the fjords on Svalbard are quite dangerous, with strong torrents and <b>narrow</b> <b>fairways.</b> The pilot requirement will be phased-in gradually. Starting in 2012, all vessels going to the Svea coal mine had to carry a pilot. Starting in 2013, all passenger vessels over 150 meters had to have a pilot when going into one of the fjords on Svalbard. And starting in 2014, all boats over 70 meters and all passenger vessels longer than 24 meters needed to have a pilot when entering one of the fjords.|$|R
50|$|The Signature Hole is the 12th, a 389-yard par 4 {{that plays}} from an {{elevated}} tee to a <b>narrow,</b> sloping <b>fairway</b> with a pond on the right.

2500|$|Irwin added {{a second}} U.S. Open title in 1979 at Inverness Club. With its <b>narrow</b> <b>fairways</b> and heavy rough, the Inverness course was a stern {{test for the}} players. Irwin's final round of 75 tied the post-World War II tournament record for the highest final round score by a U.S. Open champion. The next month in The Open Championship at Royal Lytham & St Annes, Irwin came to the final round with a {{two-shot}} lead. He was bidding to become only the third golfer since 1945 to win the U.S. Open and The Open Championship {{in the same year}} after Ben Hogan (1953) and Lee Trevino (1971) - a feat later matched by Tom Watson (1982) and Tiger Woods (2000). Irwin said in 1979: [...] "I would dearly love to win the British Open. It is special." [...] However, he was thwarted in his attempt at an historic double by the incredible recovery play of Seve Ballesteros.|$|R
5|$|Fellows Riverside Gardens' popular {{lookout point}} offers {{visitors}} contrasting {{views of the}} area.

50|$|The eighth hole (Avant Garde) is a 568 yard par 5. After the {{tee shot}} over the Onion River, players have two choices. They can either play down the <b>narrow</b> right <b>fairway</b> {{and get to}} the green in two, or play down the wider left fairway and layup, and then hit a wedge into the green. Either way, the player will again have to cross the river before {{reaching}} the green.|$|R
5000|$|At the {{new site}} the club leaders, {{including}} John Schalberg, Max Smith, Rick Vlam, Joe D'Annunzio and Jim, set {{about creating a}} course with the same enthusiasm they had shown at the first site. Ed Headrick visited the site several times and provided the initial design. The layout, at 4,016 feet, utilized the existing landscape features to the best advantage. Holes were designed with <b>narrow</b> <b>fairways</b> through the tightly treed areas, and up, down and across the modest hills. No major trees had {{to come down to}} create the layout. Sedgley fit Ed's vision of how a disc golf course should be designed: a predominance of short holes each requiring a great variety of shots. Each hole was designed to be unique, both in length and the type and variety of hazards. Several holes were designed with both left and right curve fairways while some holes mandated roller tee shots because of the low hanging trees very close to the tee. The woods at Sedgley and the areas of underbrush that line many holes are still challenging to disc golfers. Even though every hole can be birdied, scores of 4, 5 or more can be carded on every hole as well. The course is still a challenge and delight to play today. This reinforces the assertion that this early course is a masterpiece of disc golf course design.|$|R
5000|$|The {{golf course}} began {{construction}} beginning in 1923, and {{was completed in}} 1924. The club, an amenity for property-owners in the newly developed Palos Verdes Project was designed by the prominent golf course architect George C. Thomas, Jr. (with help from William [...] "Billy" [...] Bell), {{who went on to}} design Riviera Country Club, Bel Air Country Club, and Los Angeles Country Club (North). The course was opened for play on November 15, 1924. Many varieties of trees were planted during original construction, which are now very mature and line and <b>narrow</b> the <b>fairways.</b> The land on which the course is situated is owned by the City of Palos Verdes Estates, and the club is operated under a concession agreement with the City.|$|R
5000|$|The {{tournament is}} {{played at the}} En-Joie Golf Club in Endicott in Upstate New York. En-Joie Golf Club opened [...] in 1927 under the {{original}} design of Ernie Smith. The golf course was originally built by George F. Johnson, {{the owner of the}} Endicott-Johnson Shoe Company. Johnson created the golf course as a place of recreation for his employees who worked at the local shoe factory in Endicott. In 1998 and 1999, the golf course layout was renovated by Michael Hurdzan. He changed the original relatively flat, round greens into very large, undulating greens that challenge all level of golfers. With <b>narrow,</b> tree-lined <b>fairways</b> coupled with large, elevated greens En-Joie golf course is a true test for golfers of all skill levels.|$|R
50|$|This {{episode was}} very different. The five {{remaining}} players {{were given a}} rest day, during which they did the calendar shoot. The six eliminateds would have one chance to play their {{way back into the}} competition, the first time in Big Break history any eliminated players had such a chance. Delasin was out after finishing last in a <b>narrow</b> zone <b>fairway</b> challenge. Duncan was out after a greenside bunker challenge. Ruhe mastered the challenge that knocked her out in week three, with her third attempt landing straight into the cup without even landing on the green. DiSanto was eliminated after that challenge, with Tucker out after a putting challenge. Lucidi and Ruhe played one hole of matchplay, in which Lucidi made birdie to earn her way back onto the show.|$|R
