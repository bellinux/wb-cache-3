In support of this goal, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) is revising the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) program regulations and the effluent limitation guidelines (ELGs) for concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs). Proposed changes to the NPDES regulations affect which animal feeding operations (AFOs) are considered CAFOs and are therefore subject to the NPDES permit program. Changes to the ELG determine what technology-based requirements apply to these CAFOs.

The aim {{of this paper is to}} critically examine the impacts of the McKinsey Report (2010), a tourism expansionist policy based on the notion of 'high value, low impact', which was targeted to increase international tourist numbers to 100, 000 by 2012. This target has significantly impacted on Bhutan's limited resources and contravenes the GNH Tourism Model founded on the four GNH pillars: the preservation and conservation of the environment; cultivation and promotion of culture; good governance, and equitable and sustainable socio-economic development. Foucault's (1978) theoretical framework of 'governmentality', is used to explain the socio-cultural realities of the GNH tourism model. A qualitative methodology of document analysis, participant observation, and semi-structured in-depth interviews of tourism stakeholders has been used. The interview data was analysed using the NVivo 10 software program. The findings revealed discord amongst tourism stakeholders over the implementation of the McKinsey Report recommendations. Whilst there was an increase in <b>national</b> <b>economic</b> <b>benefits,</b> the environmental and socio-cultural integrity of Bhutan was adversely impacted, thereby compromising the GNH principles.

40|$|The rise of {{renewable}} energy has generated tensions over its means and ends. Civil society groups have been promoting decentralisation of energy production, greater community control over resources and equitable access. Renewable energy {{has been seen as}} a special opportunity due its spatially distributed sources, for example, wind, sun, biomass, etc. In response to such proposals, energy decentralisation has been linked with renewable energy sources by some governments and local authorities, especially in Scandinavia. A similar vision also has appeared in many UK policy documents on decarbonisation over the past decade. Together these policies aim to enhance community involvement and GHG savings through renewable energy, including bioenergy. Focusing on the UK government’s innovation priorities, this paper addresses the following questions: How do UK policy incentives shape future bioenergy? How do priorities link innovation, infrastructures and knowledge? Here we argue that UK support measures generally promote bioenergy innovation as input-substitutes to supply centralised infrastructures for current consumption patterns. These priorities arise partly from the UK state’s relatively weak capacity to implement energy innovation, which remains dependent on large private-sector companies. Dominant pathways involve several epistemic assumptions, for example, that cost-effective GHG reductions correspond to inherent efficiencies of large-scale systems; that <b>national</b> <b>economic</b> <b>benefits</b> correspond to large companies selling novel technology or licensing patents abroad; and that mere input-substitution or fossil fuels is politically more reliable...|$|E
40|$|A {{systems study}} to {{identify}} the economic potential for a high-speed commercial transport (HSCT) has considered technology, market characteristics, airport infrastructure, and environmental issues. Market forecasts indicate a need for HSCT service in the 2000 / 2010 time frame conditioned on economic viability and environmental acceptability. Design requirements focused on a 300 passenger, 3 class service, and 6500 nautical mile range based on the accelerated growth of the Pacific region. Compatibility with existing airports was an assumed requirement. Mach numbers between 2 and 25 were examined {{in conjunction with the}} appropriate propulsion systems, fuels, structural materials, and thermal management systems. Aircraft productivity was a key parameter with aircraft worth, in comparison to aircraft price, being the airline-oriented figure of merit. Aircraft screening led to determination that Mach 3. 2 (TSJF) would have superior characteristics to Mach 5. 0 (LNG) and the recommendation that the next generation high-speed commercial transport aircraft use a kerosene fuel. The sensitivity of aircraft performance and economics to environmental constraints (e. g., sonic boom, engine emissions, and airport/community noise) was identified together with key technologies. In all, current technology is not adequate to produce viable HSCTs for the world marketplace. Technology advancements must be accomplished to meet environmental requirements (these requirements are as yet undetermined for sonic boom and engine emissions). High priority is assigned to aircraft gross weight reduction which benefits both economics and environmental aspects.

40|$|Climate change {{impacts on}} water {{resources}} in the United States {{are likely to be}} far-reaching and substantial because the water is integral to climate, and the water sector spans many parts of the economy. This paper estimates impacts and damages from five water resource-related models addressing runoff, drought risk, economics of water supply/demand, water stress, and flooding damages. The models differ in the water system assessed, spatial scale, and unit of assessment, but together provide a quantitative and descriptive richness in characterizing water sector effects that no single model can capture. The results, driven by a consistent set of greenhouse gas (GHG) emission and climate scenarios, examine uncertainty from emissions, climate sensitivity, and climate model selection. While calculating the net impact of climate change on the water sector as a whole may be impractical, broad conclusions can be drawn regarding patterns of change and benefits of GHG mitigation. Four key findings emerge: 1) GHG mitigation substantially reduces hydro-climatic impacts on the water sector; 2) GHG mitigation provides substantial <b>national</b> <b>economic</b> <b>benefits</b> in water resources related sectors; 3) the models show a strong signal of wetting for the Eastern US and a strong signal of drying in the Southwest; and 4) unmanaged hydrologic systems impacts show strong correlation with the change in magnitude and direction of precipitation and temperature from climate models, but managed water resource systems and regional economic systems show lower correlation with changes in climate variables due to non-linearities created by water infrastructure and the socio-economic changes in non-climate driven water demand...|$|E

40|$|The SACTRA (1999) {{report on}} Transport and the Economy found strong {{theoretical}} grounds for believing that transport investment could boost national economies {{but that the}} empirical evidence was “weak and disputed”. This study asks whether a different conclusion should be drawn today. The different approaches to evaluating the relationship between transport investment and economic output are reviewed: cross-sectional and time series, regional, cross-regional and national. The range of elasticities calculated is large: mostly positive but sometimes negative. There is fairly strong (but highly variable) evidence that transport investment (measured {{in a variety of}} ways) can influence local economic output and/or employment. At national levels there is strong evidence of cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between these factors but the issue of causality (what causes what?) remains unresolved. Various methods used {{to address the issue of}} causality are reviewed. Studies using Granger causality produce mixed findings; in some cases economic growth precedes transport investment; in others transport investment precedes economic growth. Some local or regional studies have found negative ‘spillover effects’ of transport investment on surrounding areas. None of the studies reviewed has empirically demonstrated that transport investment boosts national GDP or employment growth. Claims to that effect are (still) based on theoretical analysis, which should be treated with caution for several reasons, particularly: the aggregation problem and deadweight loss. The aggregation problem means for example, that increased productivity in the area around a new road will not necessarily increase national production. Deadweight loss is the negative economic impact of taxation, or deferred taxation when infrastructure is financed by borrowing. Given the uncertainty surrounding these findings, the study concludes that claims made about the <b>national</b> <b>economic</b> <b>benefits</b> of transport investment are not robustly supported by the underlying evidence. It is more appropriate to view transport investment as a facilitative factor rather than a causal factor...|$|E

The wetland is a large swamp area in the upper North Island of New Zealand and provides an important wildlife habitat for many varied plants and animals. The wetland also has significant potential for agricultural and horticultural development {{as well as providing}} benefits in the form of fishing revenues and flood control. This study describes the major uses of the wetland in detail and goes on to apply economic evaluation techniques to each of them. Particular emphasis is placed on applying the Contingent Valuation Method (CVM) to evaluate the non-market benefits from preserving and improving the wetland as an environmental amenity. The CVM is discussed in detail with its theory, strengths, and weaknesses highlighted. A commentary on the methodology used in applying the CVM proceeds to outline the derivation of the national sampling frame, the design and implementation of the postal survey questionnaire and the results obtained. Information collected in the postal survey is examined to derive an understanding of how much and why, people value the wetland. A socio-economic profile of the respondents to the survey is generated in order that a judgement can be made on whether the postal survey technique has validly captured a national opinion. The study proceeds to aggregate the <b>national</b> <b>economic</b> <b>benefits</b> of the wetland in the form of Net Present Values (in January 1987 dollar terms, using a 10 % discount rate). These values are then compared to illustrate how preservation of the wetland is likely to provide significantly greater social benefits than agricultural development benefits.

International trade liberalisation is typically seen as a public good since it yields both global and <b>national</b> <b>economic</b> <b>benefits</b> for all trading countries according to David Ricardo 's classic trade theory. International agreements (i. e. international regimes) such as the General Agreements on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and international organisations such as the World trade Organisation (WTO) have therefore been at the centre of regime theory. However, regime theories concerning international co-operation on securing global interests in free trade {{seem to be more}} or less divorced from discussions on the nature of free trade as a public good. That is to say, the logic of game theory and political economy approaches, which are often employed in these analyses seem to be somewhat inconsistent with pure "Ricardian" trade theory or even the neo-classic version of Heckscher-Ohlin-Samuelson. If one furthermore considers the propositions of new trade theories stressing imperfect competition, increasing returns to scale, and strategic trade policies it is necessary to take a critical look at the nature of free trade as a public good. The propositions of classic trade theory, main stream regime theories are insufficient for analysing the politics of the international trade regime. In particular, the rationalistic propositions of main stream neo-liberal and neo-realist perspectives on international co-operation are problematic. The gap between new insights of modern trade theory and IR-theory on international trade liberalisation may give way for alternative or supplementary explanations on how the WTO regime works. Here cognitive or "reflectivist" IRperspectives on international regimes will be considered. These perspectives stress the significance of factors such as ideology and moral values. The discussion unfolded here constitutes an important theoretical component of a forthcoming Ph. D. dissertation by the author of this paper (Working title, "Free Trade, Public Goods, and Regime Theory: Lessons from WTO trade-enwonment disputes"). The main body of the present paper will appear again in my dissertation where it will serve as a theoretical point of departure for analysing concrete dispute settlements in the WTO. This provisional publication is intended to stimulate the debate on the relationship between regime theory and trade theory and facilitate feed back on my current work concerning the WTO regime...|$|E

These uniform-shaped earth or concrete lined channels were designed to "control" flooding and to make possible expanded floodplain developments. As many of these channels have been in service for over 50 years, it may be instructive to reassess them to examine how they were planned, designed, and maintained, and to identify the current conditions and issues. The assessment provides the basis to develop management strategies for this aging infrastructure. In this dissertation, I examined the flood control channels in the Federal scale and the local scale. At the Federal scale, I reviewed the history and evolution of USACE policy, planning process, design criteria, and the 100 -year flood standard. I also conducted a systematic evaluation of nine urban flood control channels built by USACE between the 1950 s and 1970 s in the San Francisco Bay Region. I found the commonality of problems in these flood control channels, driven by the USACE planning policies when these channels were built. The finding forms the justification to develop a channel safety program to manage all USACE flood control channels at the federal scale. The policy review found that the planning process for these projects singly focused on <b>national</b> <b>economic</b> <b>benefits,</b> while environmental consequences were largely excluded. The land enhancement benefit in the cost benefit analysis encouraged floodplain and tidal marsh developments. However, habitat elimination resulting from the developments was not considered as a cost. The land enhancement benefit had significant impact on project justification. The San Francisco Bay Area case study found that six of the nine projects included the land enhancement benefit in the cost benefit analysis. If the land enhancement benefit were subtracted from the total project benefit, three of the six projects {{would not have been}} authorized due to low cost benefit ratio. This implies that if habitat protection had equal footing as flood risk reduction, as a planning criterion for these projects, many of the projects would not have been authorized in the form they were constructed. The primary design criteria for these flood control channels were to maximize flow capacity within a minimal footprint. The hydraulic design assumed a clear water condition, ignoring sediment effects. However, oversized thalwegs invite in-channel sediment deposition, and sediment transport increases channel roughness. Both effects reduce channel capacity. The clear water assumption led to questionable channel designs. The San Francisco Bay Area case study shows that six of the nine flood control channels have channel thalweg elevation at the outfall lower than the adjacent bay bed, created sediment sumps. The study also found that eight of the nine flood control channels had concrete channel reaches designed under supercritical flow. Such design demands the channel to function as designed under the clear water condition. The San Francisco Bay Area case study found that the maintenance guidelines were ambiguous, but sediment deposition created significant operation and maintenance burden to local sponsors. On average the current sediment maintenance cost is 5 times higher than the original design estimate. Due to sediment deposition and channel deterioration, the average channel capacity reduced by 31 %, as compared to the original design capacity. None of the channels in the study have the capacity to convey the existing 100 year flow. Even under the original design condition, five of the nine channels cannot provide existing 100 year flow capacity, considering two of the five channels were designed for the Standard Project Flood. This result is a matter of concern, since even if the channels were maintained to the original design specification and under the clear water condition, these channels still cannot provide 100 -year flood protection. The Federal scale analysis identified common issues among these flood control channels. These channels provide a false sense of flood protection security to the communities they serve, and the resultant floodplain developments further increase flood risk. At the Federal scale, the findings form the justification basis to develop a channel safety program to manage all USACE flood control channels. The proposed program would be similar to the existing dam and levee safety programs. The proposed program provides a management framework for the entire USACE flood control channel portfolio, for periodic inspection and risk assessment, condition review and classification, and critical improvement prioritization for flood risk reduction. At the local scale, I conducted a detail review on the planning process of the Corte Madera Creek flood control project, to validate the findings from the USACE planning policies review. I also developed a hydraulic analysis to evaluate how sediment management schemes affect channel capacity. The case study at Corte Madera Creek further illustrated the sediment management issue found in the Federal scale analysis. The local sponsor devised a more efficient sediment removal plan for 100 year flood protection, however it still costs 14 times more than the original maintenance budget estimate. Furthermore, the proposed flood protection projects in the upper watershed were designed based on the flood control channel providing 5, 600 cfs capacity, about 2, 000 cfs lower than the original design capacity. The analysis shows that even if the channel were maintained in accordance with the USACE operation and maintenance manual, the channel still would not provide the capacity needed. This finding validated the fundamental project design issues found at the Federal scale analysis. At the local scale, my analysis identified a need to update the USACE operation and maintenance manual, to specify sediment removal frequency and volume based on the required channel capacity. Local sponsors should develop a sediment deposition and channel capacity relationship, so the local sponsor can assess the need for sediment removal based on channel flow and stage monitoring data. The channel safety program provides the management tool to systematically prioritize and implement these updates to USACE projects. USACE should update the engineering manual for flood control channel project planning and design. The revision should include methods to estimate channel roughness coefficient under various sedimentation and sediment transport conditions. To provide the technical basis to update the engineering manuals and project assessment methods, additional research is needed to (1) investigate how bedload sediment transport on smooth surface with no deposition affects channel roughness, and (2) improve existing risk analysis tools to quantify the stage discharge uncertainty. In addition to managing the aging infrastructure to maintain its level of service, {{there is a need to}} develop intervention strategies to reinvent flood control channels to meet contemporary objectives in ecological restoration, floodplain management, recreation, and flood risk reduction. The intervention also needs to overcome the space limitation due to urban encroachments in the floodplain and often up to the channel banks...|$|E
