5|$|McCulloch met former Smiths guitarist Johnny Marr in 1993 {{and they}} wrote and {{recorded}} an album, tentatively titled Touch Down. The album {{was to be}} released in early 1994; however, despite McCulloch and Marr being happy with the album, Rob Dickins at WEA felt it was missing some element. Dickins suggested to McCulloch that Sergeant be brought in to do some work. McCulloch was initially sceptical because he had not spoken with Sergeant since de Freitas's funeral; however, he did give the idea some thought. Before McCulloch had chance to contact Sergeant, a mutual friend persuaded the pair to meet socially. While McCulloch and Sergeant were being reacquainted, the tapes from the McCulloch and Marr sessions disappeared. McCulloch was <b>not</b> <b>upset</b> about this as he and Sergeant had started working together as Electrafixion.|$|E
5|$|The {{road to the}} Teutonic capital Marienburg now lay open, {{the city}} undefended; but for reasons the sources do not explain, Władysław hesitated to pursue his advantage. On 17 July, his army began a laboured advance, {{arriving}} at Marienburg only on 25 July, by which time the new Grand Master, Heinrich von Plauen, had organised a defence of the fortress. The apparent half-heartedness of the ensuing siege, called off by Władysław on 19 September, has been ascribed variously to the impregnability of the fortifications, to high casualty figures among the Lithuanians, to Władysław's unwillingness to risk further casualties, or to his desire to keep the Order weakened but undefeated as to <b>not</b> <b>upset</b> {{the balance of power}} between Poland (which would most likely acquire most of the Order possessions if it was totally defeated) and Lithuania; but a lack of sources precludes a definitive explanation.|$|E

25|$|In Series Two, some cast changes occurred. David Jackson (Gan) was <b>not</b> <b>upset</b> {{that his}} {{character}} would die because Jackson was given {{little to do}} in many episodes. According to Chris Boucher, Jackson once passed him a note with the word 'four' written on it. When Boucher queried the note, Jackson explained that 'four' {{was the number of}} lines he had in that week's script. It was originally intended that Gan would be killed by a double agent who would then join the Liberator crew as a Federation spy.|$|E
40|$|For {{state governments}} across the country, these are austere times. States are facing {{some of the}} worst budget {{shortfalls}} in decades, leaving legislators scrambling to bring revenues and expenditures into balance, while <b>not</b> <b>upsetting</b> their constituencies. In addition to changing economic conditions, a recent federal change granting accelerated depreciation to business threatened to eat up additional state revenue. A popular response from many states has been to decouple from the federal definition of income: i. e., not allow bonus depreciation for state taxes by moving away from the federal definition of income...|$|R
40|$|The {{choice of}} an {{appropriate}} exchange rate regime during economic transition is investigated through {{the case of}} China's 1994 reform programme. Within a game-theoretic framework, the paper compares welfare under alternative policy regimes. While <b>not</b> <b>upsetting</b> government welfare, China's exchange rate unification through a floating rate has compelling benefits {{as a means of}} aborting the multiple practice. Given the choice of a flexible rate regime for convertibility, numerical simulations show a managed floater is favourable and may additionally mitigate the credibility problem associated with convertibility. Simulation outcomes also reveal China's policy preference is to place a higher weight on competitiveness than on inflation...|$|R

25|$|In short while, pilgrimages to Căldărușani {{became the}} object of derision: in one instance, a group of {{eccentric}} high school students passing themselves off as the press made a noisy descent on the monastery, dined at the monks' expense, and even arranged an interview with Ghenadie. The prank was organized by friends Urmuz, the future writer, and by George Ciprian, later a comedian and playwright.

25|$|Stein {{points out}} that all the various terms used to {{delineate}} the messengers – 'templates, genes, enzymes, hormones, catalysts, pheromones, social hormones' – are concepts similar to archetypes. He mentions archetypal figures which represent messengers such as Hermes, Prometheus or Christ. Continuing to base his arguments on a consideration of biological defence systems he says that it must operate in {{a whole range of}} specific circumstances, its agents must be able to go everywhere, the distribution of the agents must <b>not</b> <b>upset</b> the somatic status quo, and, in predisposed persons, the agents will attack the self.|$|E
25|$|Sainsbury's {{was very}} {{innovative}} in that its stores, instead of featuring five own-brand lines as arch-rival Home and Colonial did, offered {{a wide range}} of own label lines in comparison. Also, instead of sawdust floors and wooden counters, Sainsbury's boasted marble counters, mosaic floors, and white-tiled walls. Staff even had a uniform of white aprons. Stores started to look similar, so people could recognise them throughout London, a high cast-iron 'J. SAINSBURY' sign featured on every store so their stores could be seen on coaches and omnibuses, and round-the-back deliveries started to add extra convenience and <b>not</b> <b>upset</b> rivals due to Sainsbury's popularity.|$|E

25|$|Simmias confesses that he {{does not}} wish to disturb Socrates during his final hours by unsettling his belief in the {{immortality}} of the soul, and those present are reluctant to voice their skepticism. Socrates grows aware of their doubt and assures his interlocutors {{that he does}} indeed believe in the soul's immortality, {{regardless of whether or not}} he has succeeded in showing it as yet. For this reason, he is <b>not</b> <b>upset</b> facing death and assures them that they ought to express their concerns regarding the arguments. Simmias then presents his case that the soul resembles the harmony of the lyre. It may be, then, that as the soul resembles the harmony in its being invisible and divine, once the lyre has been destroyed, the harmony too vanishes, therefore when the body dies, the soul too vanishes. Once the harmony is dissipated, we may infer that so too will the soul dissipate once the body has been broken, through death.|$|E

500|$|During Tyndall's {{period of}} {{leadership}} the BNP promoted eugenics, {{calling for the}} forced sterilisation of those with genetically transmittable disabilities. In party literature, it talked of improving the British [...] "racial stock" [...] by removing [...] "inferior strains within the indigenous races of the British Isles". In his magazine Spearhead, Tyndall had stated that [...] "sub-human elements", [...] "perverts", and [...] "asocials" [...] should be eliminated from Britain through [...] "the gas chamber system". When questioned as to whether Tyndall would seek to exterminate other races {{if he was in}} power, he denied it; although not objecting to said exterminations on moral grounds, he stated that such a program would incur international unpopularity. It is unclear if these statements reflected his genuine views or were tactical justifications designed to <b>not</b> <b>upset</b> potential NF voters.|$|E

Additionally, critics noted that while Chenoweth's Academy Award performance was staged and choreographed as a large, extravagant number featuring [...] "dozens of colorfully costumed dancers", Adams performed by herself on a mostly barren stage highlighted by a [...] "single spotlight".

This argument will consider the constitutional constraints of the EU Treaties, before examining the case for a cross-border-only measure. It will be argued that the cross-border approach is preferable, because it would provide clearer benefits for consumers seeking to buy goods/services across borders, while <b>not</b> <b>upsetting</b> domestic law unnecessarily, in particular in the context of e-commerce...|$|R

500|$|The {{track was}} used by Barack Obama as the {{entrance}} theme for his presidential candidacy announcement in Springfield, Illinois, on 10February 2007, and it was played before his acceptance speech at the 2008 Democratic National Convention. Obama frequently used it as the lead-in {{as he took the}} stage for campaign events during the 2008 U.S. presidential election, a spectacle that even convinced one student to vote for him, and played it on primary night rallies with supporters. In August 2008, Obama listed [...] "City of Blinding Lights" [...] as one of his ten favourite songs. In his dissertation, music student Jacob Charron speculated that the music used by Obama on the campaign trail was selected because it would <b>not</b> <b>upset</b> the older voters and would be recognizable to the younger voters. The song was also valuable for its global image, ringing guitar line, and suggestions of awakening.|$|E
500|$|Far Harbors {{announcement}} was made {{three months after the}} release of Fallout 4. The expansion was influenced by player feedback on the base game's dialogue system, which was not considered to be as successful as the other game mechanics. The development team also noticed the players' interest in releases that added large amounts of explorable territory. The price of Fallout 4s season pass was increased because of the expansion's size. The expansion received generally favorable reviews from critics. The addition of new quests was praised, but there were mixed opinions on the expansion's atmosphere and its use of fog. The main criticisms were directed at the puzzles, which reviewers thought were a waste of time, unnecessary, or overly frustrating. In July 2016, Guillaume Veer accused Bethesda of copying his [...] mod, named Autumn Leaves, though Veer said that he was <b>not</b> <b>upset</b> even if Bethesda had deliberately incorporated material from Autumn Leaves in Far Harbor.|$|E
500|$|Other {{similarities}} {{were discussed}} {{in an article}} by Mat Paget (GameSpot), such {{as the fact that}} both Far Harbor and Autumn Leaves feature the ability to use the character's voice to determine whether they are a robot. Veer noted that he was <b>not</b> <b>upset</b> with the similarities, saying that he takes inspiration from other games too: [...] "I seriously think this is perfectly okay. After all, Autumn Leaves' inspirations are countless ... and being influenced is a natural part of the writing process." [...] Veer said that having the names of modders in the game's credits for acknowledgement would be beneficial. He also said that he was comfortable even if Bethesda did deliberately use content from Autumn Leaves, and wrote that [...] "I honestly thought Bethesda’s staff played Autumn Leaves, had a blast with it, took some things out of it and made their own thing for Far Harbor. ... And I seriously think this is perfectly okay." ...|$|E
