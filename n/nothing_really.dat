Alan Arkin says when he first read the script, he was [...] "a bit baffled. <b>Nothing</b> <b>really</b> {{made sense to me}} until I saw the sets. Burton's visual imagination is extraordinary". The role of The Inventor was written specifically for Vincent Price, and would ultimately be his final feature film role. Burton commonly watched Price's films as a child, and, after completing Vincent, the two became good friends. Robert Oliveri was cast as Kevin, Kim's younger brother. Nick Carter from The Backstreet Boys plays an uncredited role as the blond boy playing on the Slip 'n Slide as Edward rides in Peg's car through suburbia.|$|E

[...] There is, however, no particular significance to the hare itself. The hare is visible in [...] "The Riddle of the Sphinx" [...] on a table in Squires's fireplace.

Subsequently, they are both presented in a mirrored room. Until the track's breakdown is played, the two further dance to the song, following which the singer is portrayed captured in a cage and later laying on the floor covered by silver. The visual ends with the screen becoming dark and Stan looking into the camera. Website Direct Lyrics named the music video [...] "cute", further explaining that [...] "although <b>nothing</b> <b>really</b> happens, Alexandra just hangs around wearing different clothes in different scenes, she takes this opportunity to further strut her sexy figure."

500|$|There is no supplication in Christian Science prayer. The process {{involves}} the Scientist {{engaging in a}} silent argument to affirm to herself the unreality of matter, something Christian Science practitioners will do for a fee, including in absentia, to address ill health or other problems. Wilson writes that Christian Science healing is [...] "not curative... on its own premises, but rather preventative of ill health, accident and misfortune, since it claims {{to lead to a}} state of consciousness where these things do not exist. What heals is the realization that there is <b>nothing</b> <b>really</b> to heal." [...] It is a closed system of thought, viewed as infallible if performed correctly; healing confirms the power of Truth, but its absence derives from the failure, specifically the bad thoughts, of individuals.|$|E

[...] At that time, he was attending Princeton Theological Seminary once a week and planned to attend full-time after the football season. [...] Asked if the violent nature of football was inconsistent with his Christian beliefs, Timberlake noted that [...] "you don't need to hurt anyone to get by" [...] in football and that the game involved skill, timing and execution more than violence.

Michael Fremer wrote in December 1996 that [...] "while the 2 did <b>nothing</b> <b>really</b> wrong, the 3 offered somewhat deeper and tighter bass, better dynamics {{at both ends of}} the scale, a better sensation of 'quiet', and smoother overall performance". Considered on its own terms, the Rega 3 was [...] "quiet, dynamic, free of obvious tracking distortion or other supposed analog problems, extremely well-balanced top to bottom, offers very deep and reasonably tight bass". In comparison with the $9000 TNT Mk.3/Immedia RPM, recordings sounded [...] "more like a recording and less like real life on the Rega 3".|$|E

[...] "Otherwise a country life is fittest for disgraced persons", she commented. She travelled to London, staying at Essex House from January till March 1598, and seeking a reconciliation with Elizabeth.

500|$|A {{scene where}} Sharon and Nick's mother Nikki (Melody Thomas Scott) were searching the sewers {{for what they}} {{believed}} was Cameron's dead body became popular with fans of the show. Scott described the sewer shoot as a [...] "horrific day at work" [...] with [...] "20 live f--king rats on the set", while comparing the unlikely duo of Sharon and Nikki to Lucy and Ethel from I Love Lucy. Cameron eventually reveals himself. He had murdered Sharon's ex-boyfriend (and Cassie's biological father) Frank Barritt (Phil Dozois), who was visiting town, and hid the body in Sharon's car trunk. Cameron's crimes are revealed; he is jailed, absolving Sharon of wrongdoing. Although Sharon did not actually murder Cameron, Case praised the storyline and called Sharon a heroine. She explained: [...] "Your romantic lead shouldn't just be a simple romantic lead. Sharon was {{that for a long}} time.

Green described the overall plot as [...] "feeble", but praised the alien bazaar set. Jamahl Epsicokhan, on his website [...] "Jammer's Reviews", said that [...] "Rajiin" [...] demonstrated that there was an intention for the Xindi story-arc to be a fully fledged space opera.

500|$|Jonathan Gray {{analyzed}} the self-referentiality in The Simpsons in his 2006 book Watching with The Simpsons: Television, Parody, and Intertextuality, writing that [...] "Sitcoms constantly 'reset' themselves, living in [...] an 'existential circle' in which <b>nothing</b> <b>really</b> changes, and every episode starts {{more or less}} where the last one started; and The Simpsons frequently plays with this sitcom clock, and with the amnesia of sitcom memory. The family members often forget important events in their 'history' [...] ". Gray noted that in [...] "Saddlesore Galactica", [...] "the action continues as normal, as sitcom memory (or lack thereof) is pointed out but comically not acted upon. Thus, where David Grote [...] (1983: 67) notes that sitcom episodes 'live {{in a kind of}} time-warp without any reference to the other episodes,' producing a situation whereby everything 'remains inviolate and undisturbed, no matter what transitory events may occur' (1983: 59), The Simpsons comically reflects upon this." ...|$|E

[...] Megan Vick of Billboard was positive on the video, saying that, [...] "We can't be entirely sure what Robyn {{was trying to}} say with this treatment, {{but we do know that}} this video is hot – and intriguing." [...] Robbie Daw of music website Idolator compared it to a scene from The X-Files. He concluded by saying that [...] "This is hardcore, indeed."

Susan Shapiro of The New York Times wrote that [...] "Although the paradoxes of being 'a celebrity nobody knows' are interesting, the photographs, diary entries and overly cute commentaries make this book feel like a personal scrapbook." [...] Rosellen Brewer of the Library Journal commented that [...] "Cartwright's own life notwithstanding, there is <b>nothing</b> <b>really</b> new or exciting here.

[...] Lee Bacchus of The Province wrote that [...] "This little book by the voice of Bart Simpson reads as if it were written by a 10-year-old boy. Not that that's all bad. Cartwright, who voices Bart along with Ralph Wiggum and a few others on The Simpsons, gives a very unchallenging tour behind the scenes of the phenomenally successful series.

Slezak gave it an [...] "A" [...] and wrote, [...] "this spirited rendition captured [...] jaunty essence", and Strecker noted with her [...] "B+" [...] that [...] "this was the moment when it really kicked in that the show {{will never be the}} same".

500|$|Newsarama's Richard Gray {{gave the}} second part of [...] "Trinity War", Justice League of America #6, a 7 out of 10. Gray felt this issue was [...] "the {{difficult}} middle chapter {{of the first half of}} this crossover" [...] and that [...] "the issue works successfully in building up the pieces of the broader puzzle, but it may leave readers attached to the core members of the team out in the cold." [...] He noted that the issue was more reflective in tone, opposed to pitched battles on every page. Gray criticized that the issue felt more like a Justice League issue, with the Justice League of America members all taking a back seat to the issue's events. He added that Doug Mahnke's pencils grounded the story in Geoff John's universe, but felt the battle sequences were not as good as Ivan Reis' in Justice League 22. Jesse Schedeen of IGN, who gave the issue an 8.1 out of 10, was wary that the [...] "heavy emphasis on The Outsider and his schemes made [...] "Trinity War" [...] feel less like the big event DC has been building towards since the start of the New 52 and more like another stepping stone on the road to Forever Evil," [...] but was surprised at Johns' ability to not dwell on The Outsider that much in this issue, and give each member a moral ambiguity, questioning their role in the conflict. Schedeen, however, was disappointed at how little the Trinity of Sin appeared in the issue. He also felt that the Justice League of America series got its strongest contender for art in Mahnke, but noted that it was not his best effort. Comic Book Resources gave the issue 3.5 stars out of 5, with Doug Zawisza saying he was not impressed with the issue, with a lot going on, and <b>nothing</b> <b>really</b> moving forward. He felt that Mahnke's art excelled in certain characters, especially Hawkman, Martian Manhunter and Frankenstein.|$|E
