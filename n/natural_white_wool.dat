40|$|The textile {{excavations}} founded at {{the time}} of dig process are called archaeological textiles. Due to injurious conditions when they are buried under the ground the polymeric structure of fibres and former colours are damaged, but the structure of fabric mostly remains. The modern technology of Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) allows textile fibre constitution and sometimes the former colours identification. The comparison of various wool fibres in FTIR spectra showed the possibility of distinguishing some animal breed wool fibres and even fibres colours (the difference in <b>natural</b> <b>white</b> and black <b>wool</b> fibre’s spectra was obvious). Investigations of archaeological textile of 13 – 14 century, which with the naked eye looked brown-black colour, showed that one of the textile was woven from white colour of the sheep wool fibre. The investigations of archaeological cellulose fibre textiles showed a lot of discrepancies. In {{spite of the fact that}} it is very difficult to identify the raw material with 100 % probability, but preliminary consideration is possible...|$|R

50|$|The Bow Tie Buzzer was {{the last}} of Sawyer's nymphs. It has a unique design than allows the hook to rotate freely on the tippet. The Bow Tie Buzzer is {{designed}} to imitate the large midge larvae found in still waters. The pattern is tied with pheasant feathers and tin foil with a <b>white</b> <b>wool</b> 'bow tie' used to imitate the cilia. The Bow Tie Buzzer must be attached to the tippet in a specific manner to allow the pattern to function properly. First the hook is threaded onto the tippet and allowed to run up and down the line freely. Secondly, a piece of <b>white</b> <b>wool</b> is tied on to {{the very end of the}} tippet. This stops the free-running hook from coming off the end of the tippet. Once cast onto still water, the hook can rotate freely in the same manner as natural midge larvae.|$|R
40|$|Tetrapods of Zn and TiO 2 mixture {{have been}} {{synthesized}} through the thermal oxidation technique. The mixed powder was placed into Al 2 O 3 crucible, and then heated in furnace at 1000 °C {{for a few}} minutes. The Al 2 O 3 crucible was taken out from the furnace, and the <b>white</b> <b>wool</b> products were observed. The <b>white</b> <b>wool</b> products were examined by FE-SEM, EDS, and XRD for morphology, chemical composition, crystal structure, and phase formation. FE-SEM result revealed that the <b>white</b> <b>wool</b> products composed of tetrapods with single crystalline and had two different shapes, round tip and sharp tip. The round tip tetrapods had the length of 1 – 2 µm and the diameter of 160 – 280 nm, while the sharp tip tetrapods had the length of 3 – 13 µm and the diameter ranging from 330 – 470 nm. The EDS attached to the FE-SEM was performed on one leg of tetrapod and indicated Ti, O, and Zn elements. The atomic concentration of Ti was less than 1 at. %. XRD result indicated that the tetrapods exhibited hexagonal wurtzite ZnO phase (a = 3. 247 Å and c = 5. 175 Å) and small phase fraction of face-centered cubic Zn 2 TiO 4 phase (a = 4. 479 Å).
