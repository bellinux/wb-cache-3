5|$|Gouverneur Morris is credited, {{both now}} and then, {{as the chief}} {{draftsman}} of the final document, including the stirring preamble. Not all the delegates were pleased with the results; thirteen left before the ceremony, and three of those remaining refused to sign: Edmund Randolph of Virginia, George Mason of Virginia, and Elbridge Gerry of Massachusetts. George Mason demanded a Bill of Rights if he was to support the Constitution. The Bill of Rights {{was not included in}} the Constitution submitted to the states for ratification, but many states ratified the Constitution with the understanding that a bill of rights would soon follow. Shortly before the document was to be signed, Gorham proposed to lower the size of congressional districts from 40,000 to 30,000 citizens. A similar measure had been proposed earlier, and failed by one vote. George Washington spoke up here, making his only substantive contribution to the text of the Constitution in supporting this move. The Convention adopted it without further debate. Gorham would sign the document, although he had openly doubted whether the United States would remain a single, unified nation for more than 150 years. Ultimately, 39 of the original 55 delegates ended up signing, but it is likely that none were completely satisfied. Their views were summed up by Benjamin Franklin, who said, I confess that There are several parts of this Constitution which I do not at present approve, but I am <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> shall never approve them.... I doubt too whether any other Convention we can obtain, may be able to make a better Constitution.... It therefore astonishes me, Sir, to find this system approaching so near to perfection as it does; and I think it will astonish our enemies...|$|E
500|$|Gillard's {{mother told}} ABC TV's Australian Story program that Gillard had spoken {{from a young}} age of never wanting children. Gillard herself told the program that while she admired women who could balance child rearing with a career, [...] "I'm <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> could have. There's {{something}} in me that's focused and single-minded and if I {{was going to do}} that, I'm <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> could have done this." ...|$|E
500|$|When asked {{from where}} she draws {{consolation}} {{in the face of}} aging and death, Streep responded: [...] "Consolation? I'm <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> have it. I have a belief, I guess, {{in the power of the}} aggregate human attempt – the best of ourselves. In love and hope and optimism – you know, the magic things that seem inexplicable. Why we are the way we are. I do have a sense of trying to make things better. Where does that come from?" ...|$|E

500|$|English actor Chris Coxon {{played the}} role of SpongeBob. Coxon was a fan of the series and said [...] "If I'd been told a year ago that I would be playing SpongeBob today I would have loved it, {{although}} I'm <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> would have believed it." [...] Coxon admitted it was difficult to adapt the show into a musical. He remarked [...] "It is difficult because you are trying to recreate this character that is so fluid on screen. For example I'm just getting used to my square costume, although it does have an incredible design, so that, although I am restricted, I {{can do a lot of}} the things he does in the cartoon." ...|$|E
500|$|Asked in an {{interview}} if he ever worried about going broke, Keating responded, [...] "All the time, every day. I come into the office with this hollow feeling in my stomach lots of time.... You get trapped almost. You get too many responsibilities. It's a bellyfull to carry. It's risky. Dangerous. There's the possibility of failure with it every day and every night. But in a way, it's a challenge. It's invigorating. There isn't any point in not being a player – you're here.... It's not only the money. It's the disgrace, yourself, your manhood. I'm not sure I'd have a big problem with that. On the other hand I'm <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> wouldn't." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1970, Ramsey named Charlton in his squad of 22 for the 1970 World Cup in Mexico. However, he favoured Labone over Charlton and only picked Charlton for his 35th and final England game in the 1–0 group win over Czechoslovakia at the Estadio Jalisco. England lost in the quarter finals to West Germany, and on the flight home, Charlton asked Ramsey not to be {{considered}} for international duty again. Charlton agonised over how to break the news to Ramsey, and eventually said: [...] "Great times... absolute privilege... getting older... slowing down... <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> am up to it any more... time to step down." [...] Ramsey listened, then agreed with him. [...] "Yes, I had reached that conclusion myself." ...|$|E

500|$|A Wall Street billionaire {{placed under}} house arrest for {{stealing}} $2billion. On his character, Alda said [...] "Shaw is sometimes described as a Bernie Madoff-like character. I'm <b>not</b> <b>sure.</b> <b>I</b> don't think anyone has ever operated on the scale that Madoff did. And I don't know if what Shaw did technically qualifies as a Ponzi scheme. But in that Shaw was willing to steal money from people who really needed it who really couldn't afford to lose it and willing to take everything they had…yes, he's in Bernie territory, with both feet." [...] Ratner initially approached Robert Redford to play the role, being a fan of {{his work in the}} heist film The Hot Rock, but Redford turned him down.|$|E
500|$|When Yentob was succeeded as {{controller}} of BBC Two by Michael Jackson, Pattinson {{was able to}} persuade Jackson to commission full production on the series. This was {{in spite of the}} fact that Jackson and Wearing were not close and did not get on; Pattinson took to dealing with Jackson directly. Jackson had agreed to nine one-hour episodes, but Flannery protested that each episode should be as long as it needed to be, to which Jackson agreed. The long delay in production did have the advantageous side effect of allowing Flannery to extend the story, and instead of ending in 1979, it now carried on into the 1990s, bringing the four central characters into middle age. Flannery later commented that: [...] "The project has undoubtedly benefited from the delay. I'm <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> have." ...|$|E
500|$|Bono {{said he did}} {{not feel}} {{responsible}} that a U2 song was used in a murder defence, but stated [...] "I still feel that you have to go down those streets in your music. If that's where the subject is taking you, you have to follow. At least in the imagination. I'm <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> want to get down there to live. I'll take a walk occasionally, and have a drink with the devil, but I'm not moving in with him." [...] The Edge said that the song's defence in the trial was [...] "very heavy", stating [...] "Should any artist hold back from putting out something because he's afraid of what somebody else might do {{as a result of his}} work? I would hate to see censorship come in, whether from the government or, from my point of view, personal." ...|$|E

500|$|Speaking {{of their}} {{strained}} relationship {{during an interview}} with Hot 97.5, Minaj said: [...] "It gets {{a little hard to}} have a real connection when people are on different sides of the world, working on different things. You just never know who people got in their ear or what they're feeling or maybe they felt wronged in some way. I don't know. I just know that Drake is my baby, and Wayne is my everything." [...] However, Drake said their relationship has improved, and credited the song as opening up a new dialogue, saying: [...] "I think the dialogue actually between us was already opened up, I had already solved that issue. I wrote that a while ago, and I kinda felt guilty changing it. It was a sentiment that I had when I started this album and felt like that's how it should be. The album should start one place and end in another...I haven't talked to her since it's been out. I'm <b>not</b> <b>sure.</b> <b>I</b> haven't spoke to her." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Sectionals" [...] {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} critics. TV Guide Natalie Abrams felt it ended {{the beginning of}} the season on a [...] "high note", while Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal commented: [...] "You couldn’t have asked for a better cliffhanger of a fall finale". IGN's Eric Goldman rated the episode 9/10, calling it [...] "very satisfying", and Gerrick Kennedy of the Los Angeles Times commended it as [...] "fine television." [...] James Poniewozik of Time wrote: [...] "I'm <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> expected or wanted a feel-good ending out of the first half of Glee. But what we got from [...] "Sectionals" [...] left me feeling very good about where the show is going this spring." [...] In contrast, Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger, felt that the episode brought too many storylines to a head at once, [...] "not allowing all to have as much impact as they might have had the big developments been spaced out". Sepinwall commented, however, that the acting and especially singing performances were [...] "uniformly strong." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} overwhelmingly laudatory {{reviews from}} television critics, particularly for its unusual {{departure from the}} standard Mad Men episode structure and {{is considered to be}} one of the best in the series. Alan Sepinwall of HitFix exalted the episode and the [...] "more formally experimental" [...] season, admitting, [...] "I'm still <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> understood 100% of it. But I know I liked it. A lot." [...] Sepinwall characterized [...] "Far Away Places" [...] as [...] "an episode that gave the feel of dropping acid even when everyone on camera was stone sober. Matt Weiner, co-writer Semi Chellas, director Scott Hornbacher, and the actors combined to give us some of the most memorable moments the show has ever done." [...] Todd VanderWerff of The A.V. Club gave it an A grade, compared it to previous [...] "structurally daring" [...] episodes like [...] "Seven Twenty Three" [...] and [...] "The Jet Set", and praised the director for the [...] "beautifully shot" [...] episode and the [...] "gorgeous image of [...] and Jane lying, heads touching, on the floor, admitting their marriage just isn’t working", while noting that the enemy of the season is [...] "the passage of time itself".|$|E

500|$|The American film {{reviewer}} Leonard Maltin {{has suggested}} that {{if it had been}} Connery in the leading role instead of Lazenby, On Her Majesty's Secret Service would have epitomised the series. On the other hand, Danny Peary wrote, [...] "I'm <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> agree with those who insist that if Connery had played Bond it would definitely be the best of the entire Bond series... Connery's Bond, with his boundless humor and sense of fun and self-confidence, would be out of place in this picture. It actually works better with Lazenby because he is incapable of playing Bond as a bigger-than-life hero; for one thing he hasn't the looks... Lazenby's Bond also hasn't the assurance of Connery's Bond and that is appropriate in the crumbling, depressing world he finds himself. He seems vulnerable and jittery at times. At the skating rink, he is actually scared. We worry about him... On Her Majesty's Secret Service doesn't have Connery and it's impossible to ever fully adjust to Lazenby, but I think that it still might be the best Bond film, as many Bond cultists claim." [...] Peary also described On Her Majesty's Secret Service as [...] "the most serious", [...] "the most cynical" [...] and [...] "the most tragic" [...] of the Bond films.|$|E
500|$|Rob Salem of Toronto Star {{said that}} [...] "fans {{who have been}} {{complaining}} about this season’s relative complacency [...] finally got their gore and more when the farm was overrun by suddenly, strangely single-minded walkers." [...] Pamela Mitchell of Houston Chronicle commented that [...] "Beside the Dying Fire" [...] was the most eventful episode of the season, while Digital Spy's Morgan Jeffery thought that [...] "every single major character gets their moment to shine"; [...] "Epic, action-packed, emotional—'Beside the Dying Fire' is great television," [...] she concluded. TV Guide television critic Michael Logan affirmed that the season finale [...] "was so scary and shock-a-minute outrageous that it nearly made our heads explode." [...] In his A– review, Zach Handlen of The A.V. Club said that [...] "Beside the Dying Fire" [...] adequately accomplished what he was hoping for. He wrote, [...] "We're finally off Hershel's farm, in about the most definitive way imaginable: The barn has been burned, and the house itself is overrun by a herd of 'walkers'." [...] New York Starlee Kine adulated the installment, and asserted that it was comparable to episodes of The Walking Dead first season. [...] "It’s just amazing how much smoother the plot holes go down when something is actually happening on this show. For {{the first time since}} last season, I felt engrossed enough to not be consumed with all the small things this show gets wrong. Up until this episode, the majority of this season has consisted exclusively of small things: petty dramas, misdirected stakes, so much stalling. I’m <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> can {{go so far as to}} say that it got everything right with this one, but at least it was entertaining and the nonstop action felt like content instead of just bookends." [...] Mark A. Perigard of the Boston Herald wrote that it was the closest the program [...] "ever resembled the climax of a George Romero film." [...] Time journalist Nate Rawlings felt that [...] "Beside the Dying Fire" [...] sufficiently encompassed a climax for its storylines, adding that it left the audience anticipating for future installments of the series.|$|E
2500|$|Some of the {{controversy}} over this may be media driven. Rich Lowry, editor of National Review, reported in the magazine's blog that the BBC [...] "have been harassing me for days over March of the Penguins ... about what, I'm <b>not</b> <b>sure.</b> <b>I</b> think to see if I would say on air that penguins are God's instruments to pull America back from the hell-fire, or something like that. As politely as I could I told her, 'Lady, they're just birds.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|The final document, engrossed by Jacob Shallus, {{was taken}} up on Monday, September 17, at the Convention's final session. Several of the delegates were {{disappointed}} in the result, a makeshift series of unfortunate compromises. Some delegates left before the ceremony, and three others refused to sign. Of the thirty-nine signers, Benjamin Franklin summed up, addressing the Convention: [...] "There are several parts of this Constitution which I do not at present approve, but I am <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> shall never approve them." [...] He would accept the Constitution, [...] "because I expect no better and because I {{am not sure that}} it is not the best".|$|E

2500|$|Merrily We Roll Along (1981), {{with a book}} by George Furth, is one of Sondheim's more {{traditional}} scores; Frank Sinatra and Carly Simon have recorded songs from the musical. According to Sondheim's music director, Paul Gemignani, [...] "Part of Steve's ability is this extraordinary versatility." [...] Although Merrily closed after 16 performances, its score has been subsequently recorded. Martin Gottfried wrote, [...] "Sondheim had set out to write traditional songs... But [...] {{that there is nothing}} ordinary about the music." [...] Sondheim and Furth have revised the show since its original production, and Sondheim later said: [...] "Did I feel betrayed? I'm <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> would put it like that. What did surprise me was the feeling around the Broadway community – if you can call it that, though I guess I will {{for lack of a better}} word – that they wanted Hal and me to fail." ...|$|E
