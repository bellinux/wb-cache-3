The two transistors, an n-channel MOSFET and a p-channel MOSFET are connected in parallel with this, however, only the drain and source terminals of the two transistors are connected together. Their gate terminals are connected to each other via a <b>NOT</b> <b>gate</b> (<b>inverter),</b> to form the control terminal.|$|E
5000|$|Logic gates can be {{built that}} use water instead of {{electricity}} to power the gating function. These are reliant on being positioned in one orientation to perform correctly. An OR gate is simply two pipes being merged, and a <b>NOT</b> <b>gate</b> (<b>inverter)</b> consists of [...] "A" [...] deflecting a supply stream to produce Ā. The AND and XOR gates are sketched in the diagram. An inverter could also be implemented with the XOR gate, as A XOR 1 = Ā.|$|E

The 7400 series devices have been produced on a number of different manufacturing processes, but have retained the same pinouts throughout.

40|$|In {{this work}} we {{demonstrate}} the fabrication of germanium nanoparticle (NP) based electronics. The whole process chain from the nanoparticle production {{up to the}} point of inverter integration is covered. Ge NPs with a mean diameter of 33 nm and a geometric standard deviation of 1. 19 are synthesized in the gas phase by thermal decomposition of GeH 4 precursor in a seeded growth process. Dispersions of these particles in ethanol are employed to fabricate thin particulate films (60 to 120 nm in thickness) on substrates with a pre-patterned interdigitated aluminum electrode structure. The effect of temperature treatment, polymethyl methacrylate encapsulation and alumina coating by plasma-assisted atomic layer deposition (employing various temperatures) on the performance of these layers as thin film transistors (TFTs) is investigated. This coating combined with thermal annealing delivers ambipolar TFTs which show an I-on/I-off ratio in the range of 10 (2). We report fabrication of n-type, p-type or ambipolar Ge NP TFTs at maximum temperatures of 450 degrees C. For the first time, a circuit using two ambipolar TFTs is demonstrated to function as a <b>NOT</b> <b>gate</b> with an <b>inverter</b> gain of up to 4 which can be operated at room temperature in ambient air...|$|R
5000|$|A bipolar {{transistor}} switch is the simplest RTL <b>gate</b> (<b>inverter</b> or <b>NOT</b> <b>gate)</b> implementing logical negation. It {{consists of a}} common-emitter stage with a base resistor connected between the base and the input voltage source. The role of the base resistor is to expand the negligible transistor input voltage range (about 0.7 V) to the logical [...] "1" [...] level (about 3.5 V) by converting the input voltage into current. Its resistance is settled by a compromise: it is chosen low enough to saturate the transistor and high enough to obtain high input resistance. The role of the collector resistor is to convert the collector current into voltage; its resistance is chosen high enough to saturate the transistor and low enough to obtain low output resistance (high fan-out).|$|R

2500|$|Majority <b>gate</b> and <b>inverter</b> (<b>NOT)</b> <b>gate</b> are {{considered}} {{as the two}} most fundamental building blocks of QCA. Figure 5 shows a majority gate with three inputs and one output. In this structure, the electrical field effect of each input on the output is identical and additive, {{with the result that}} whichever input state ("binary 0" [...] or [...] "binary 1") is in the majority becomes the state of the output cell — hence the gate's name. For example, if inputs A and B exist in a “binary 0” state and input C exists in a “binary 1” state, the output will exist in a “binary 0” state since the combined electrical field effect of inputs A and B together is greater than that of input C alone.|$|R

40|$|A MOBILE (monostable-bistable {{transition}} logic element), employing two n-type negative {{differential resistance}} devices connected in series, is a functional logic gate with {{the advantages of}} multiple inputs and multiple functions. In this paper, a novel approach to achieve MOBILE operation is demonstrated using monolithic integration of resonant tunneling diodes (RTD) and FET's. In our new integration structure, an RTD and FET are connected in parallel.

40|$|Complex digital {{circuits}} reliably work when the noise {{margin of the}} logic gates is sufficiently high. For p-type only inverters, the noise margin is typically about 1 V. To increase the noise margin, we fabricated <b>inverters</b> with dual <b>gate</b> transistors. The top gate is advantageously used to independently tune the threshold voltage. The shift can be quantitatively described by Delta V(th) =(C(t) /C(b)) V(top gate), where C(t) and C(b) are {{the top and bottom}} gate capacitances.

40|$|The {{behavior}} of a transverse domain wall (DW) interacting with a ferromagnetic <b>NOT</b> <b>gate</b> is studied with specific emphasis {{on the role of}} the DW chirality (sense of rotation of magnetization crossing the DW).

The effect of the <b>NOT</b> <b>gate</b> on the DW chirality depends on the chirality of the incoming DW: when the DW is incident on the <b>NOT</b> <b>gate</b> with the wide side of the DW on the inside of the V-shape formed by the gate, the chirality is conserved, but when the DW is incident on the gate with its wide side on the outside of the V-shape, the chirality may reverse...|$|R

The amplifiers may include such configurations as <b>gate</b> <b>inverters,</b> operational amplifiers and conventional bipolar transistor amplifiers, {{all of which}} operate at a frequency {{which is on the}} roll-off portion of their gain versus frequency curve. Several amplifier feedback circuit variations are employed to set desired bias levels and to allow the oscillator to operate at the crystal's fundamental frequency or at an overtone of the fundamental frequency. The oscillator is made less expensive than comparable oscillators by employing relatively low frequency amplifiers and operating them at roll-off, at frequencies beyond which they are customarily used. Simplicity is provided because operation at roll-off eliminates components ordinarily required in similar circuits to provide sufficient phase-shift in the feedback circuitry for oscillation to occur...|$|R
