40|$|Abstract: In the {{research}} of Diamond-like carbon (DLC) Film deposited by pulsed laser, method of double pulsed laser deposition was presented. Ti:Sapphire (800 nm, 120 fs) laser and KrF (248 nm, 20 ns) laser were used orderly to ablate graphite target. Through controlling parameters of two laser beams, double-layer DLC film was deposited on silicon substrate. The hardness and inner-stress of the DLC film changed gradually from substrate to atmosphere-interface. Nanoindentation measurement system and fourier transfer infrared spectrograph were used to hardness and transmittance of the film. Meanwhile, adhesive tape, 9. 8 <b>N</b> <b>rubber,</b> NaOH liquor and boiling water were {{used to compare the}} adhesion and environment adaptability of double layer or monolayer DLC film samples qualitatively. Results showed that DLC film deposited by double beam pulsed laser not only had high transmittance and hardness, but also kept well and had no phenomenon of peeling off after the tests including dipped in boiled water, etc. Compared to DLC films deposited by single pulsed laser, the chemical and thermal inertness of the double-layer DLC film deposited by double pulsed lasers was much better...|$|E
40|$|After the rollout of Space Shuttle Discovery in April 2005 in {{preparation}} for return-to-flight, there was {{a failure of the}} Orbiter (OV- 103) helium signature leak test in the gaseous hydrogen (GH 2) system. Leakage was attributed to the Flow Control Valve (FCV) in Main Engine 3. The FCV determined to be the source of the leak for OV- 103 is designated as LV- 58. The nitrile/Buna <b>N</b> <b>rubber</b> O-ring seal was removed from LV- 58, and failure analysis indicated radial cracks providing leak paths in one quadrant. Cracks were eventually found in 6 of 9 FCV O-rings among the three Shuttle Orbiters, though none were as severe as those for LV- 58, OV- 103. Testing by EM 10 at MSFC on all 9 FCV O- rings included: laser dimensional, Shore A hardness and properties from a dynamic mechanical analyzer (DMA) and an Instron tensile machine. The following test data was obtained on the cracked quadrant of the LV- 58, OV- 103 O-ring: (1) the estimated compression set was only 9. 5 %, compared to none {{for the rest of the}} O-ring; (2) Shore A hardness for the O. D. was higher by almost 4 durometer points than for the rest of the O-ring; and (3) DMA data showed that the storage/elastic modulus E was almost 25 % lower than for the rest of the O-ring. Of the 8 FCV O-rings tested on an Instron, 4 yielded tensile strengths that were below the MIL spec requirement of 1350 psi-a likely influence of rubber cracking. Comparisons were made between values of modulus determined by DNA (elastic) and Instron (Young s). Each nitrile/Buna N O-ring used in the FCV conforms to the MIL-P- 25732 C specification. A number of such O-rings taken from shelf storage at MSFC and Kennedy Space Center (KSC) were used to generate a reference curve of DMA glass transition temperature (Tg) vs. shelf storage time ranging from 8 to 26 years. A similar reference curve of TGA onset temperature (of rubber weight loss) vs. shelf storage time was also generated. The DMA and TGA data for the used FCV O-rings were compared to the reference curves. Correlations were also made between the DMA modulus (at 22 C) and Shore A hardness for all 9 of the FCV O-rings used among the three Shuttle Orbiters. The radial cracking in the FCV O-rings was determined to be due to ozone attack, as nitrile/Buna <b>N</b> <b>rubber</b> is susceptible to such attack. Nitrile/Buna N material under MIL-P 25732 C should be used in a hydraulic fluid environment to help protect it from cracking. However, the FCV O-rings were used in an air only environment. The FCV design has as much as a 9 -mil gap that allows the O. D. of the O-ring to be directly exposed to ozone, pressurized air and some elevated temperatures, accelerating the weathering process that leads to O-ring cracking. Space Shuttle flights will likely not continue past 2010. Therefore, Shuttle management decided to continue using the nitrile/Buna N material for the FCVs, but have each O-ring replaced after 3 years to minimize any chances for crack initiation...|$|E

40|$|One likely {{cause of}} polymer {{ignition}} in a high-pressure oxygen {{system is the}} adiabatic-compression heating of polymers caused by pneumatic impact. Oxidative pyrolysis or combustion of polymers in a high-pressure oxygen system could generate toxic gases. This paper investigates the feasibility of using the NASA pneumatic-impact system to conduct adiabatic-compression combustion tests and determines the toxic combustion products produced from the burning of five selected polymers. Five polymers commonly used in high-pressure oxygen systems, Zytel(Registered TradeMark) 42 (Nylon 6 / 6), Buna <b>N</b> (nitrile <b>rubber),</b> Witon(Registered TradeMark) A (copolymer of vinylidene fluoride and hexafluoropropylene), Neoflon(Registered TradeMark) (polychlorotrifluoroethylene), and Teflon(Registered TradeMark) (polytetrafluoroethylene), were tested in the NASA pneumatic-impact test system at 17. 2 -MPa oxygen pressure. The polymers were ignited and burned; combustion products were collected in a stainless-steel sample bottle and analyzed using various methods. The {{results show that the}} NASA pneumatic-impact system is an appropriate test system to conduct adiabatic-compression combustion tests and to collect combustion products for further chemical analysis. The composition of the combustion product gas generated from burning the five selected polymers are presented and discussed...|$|R

Job performance data {{were based on}} output measures derived from production records over a 12 -month period. Since the type of terrain varied considerably across plantations, terrain was classified as either ‘hilly’ or ‘undulating’ {{and the effects of}} terrain type on performance were also examined. The relationship between age and total output took the form of an inverted U. Partial correlation analyses indicated that tenure, rather than age, was the main determinant of {{job performance}}. More experienced rubber tappers were found to perform better than less experienced rubber tappers. Women had significantly higher output levels than did men. Tappers working on estates with predominantly hilly terrains produced significantly higher levels of output than did tappers working on estates with predominantly undulating terrains. Neither sex nor tenure interacted significantly with terrain. These results are discussed in relation to previous research concerned with group differences in job performance...|$|R
40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the attitudes of}} final year dental students in Wales and Ireland {{to the use of}} rubber dam. A pre-piloted questionnaire was distributed to final year dental students in Cardiff and Cork Dental Schools in January 2008. Information sought included attitudes to, and the current and anticipated use of, rubber dam for a variety of operative and endodontic treatments. Of 93 questionnaires distributed, 87 were completed and returned (response rate = 94 %; Cardiff: 89 %, n = 51; Cork: 100 %, <b>n</b> = 36). <b>Rubber</b> dam was routinely used by 98 % of respondents (n = 85) on adult patients, but only 32 % of respondents (n = 28) had used rubber dam on child patients (P < 0. 05). Rubber dam was never used by 75 % of respondents (n = 65) when placing posterior amalgam restorations, and by 21 % of respondents (n = 18) when placing anterior composite restorations. Rubber dam was used by 98 % of the respondents (n = 85) when performing root canal treatments. Sixty-two per cent of respondents (n = 54) believed their use of rubber dam would decrease once leaving the dental school. Whilst dental students believe that rubber dam is relevant to clinical dentistry, there are negative perceptions associated with its use amongst dental students. More than half of those questioned predicted their use of rubber dam would decrease once in independent practice. Greater emphasis should be placed on the advantages of using rubber dam in clinical dentistry whilst at dental school...|$|R
40|$|International audienceNearly 300 Millions {{of waste}} tires {{have to be}} managed in Europe. The main {{industrial}} ways to treat this kind of waste are incineration for energetic valorization and tires milling in chips or granulates for material valorization in construction industry. Steam water thermolysis (SWT) of tires, a hybrid of pyrolysis and solvolysis, is a good alternative to valorize waste tires. Recovered carbon black (rCB), which can be reintroduced in rubber industry as reinforcing filler (circular economy concept), is a more economical added value material than shredded tires. Physical and chemical characterizations on SWT-rCB were performed following ASTM analytical standards. A comparison between furnace carbon black (N 330) and rCB from pyrolysis (commercial products) was carried out. Oil Absorption Number (ASTM D 2414) and nitrogen adsorption (ASTM D 6556) measurements demonstrate that rCBs structure and specific surface area are comparable to a furnace carbon black N 330. According to data issued from ASTM standards, the behavior of rCBs reinforcement in rubbers is then expected to be equivalent to a N 330 carbon black. Rubber compounds were produced with a homemade formula and mechanical characterizations were carried out {{in order to assess}} reinforcement properties of SWT-rCB. Comparisons in terms of mechanical properties have been established between rubbers reinforced with 100 % of SWT-rCB, rubbers reinforced with furnace carbon blacks (N 330, N 550 and N 772), and mixtures of SWT-rCB and furnace carbon blacks. The results clearly show that rCBs reinforcement properties are lower than those of N 330 carbon black. However, for a same rubber formula, SWT-rCB filled rubbers properties are close or slightly better than N 550 and <b>N</b> 772 filled <b>rubbers...</b>|$|R
40|$|Melt {{rheology}} and morphology of nylon- 6 / ethylene propylene rubber (EPR) blends {{were studied}} {{as a function}} of composition, temperature, and compatibilizer loading. Uncompatibilized blends with higher nylon- 6 content (N 90 and <b>N</b> 95) and <b>rubber</b> content (<b>N</b> 5 and N 10) had viscosities approximately intermediate between those of the component polymers. A very clear negative deviation was observed in the viscosity-composition curve over the entire shear rate range studied for blends having composition N 30, N 50, and N 70. This was associated with the interlayer slip resulting from the high-level incompatibility between the component polymers. The lack of compatibility was confirmed by fracture surface morphology, given that the dispersed domains showed no sign of adhesion to the matrix. The phase morphology studies indicated that EPR was dispersed as spherical inclusions in the nylon matrix up to 30 wt % of its concentration. A cocontinuous morphology was observed between 30 and 50 wt % nylon and a phase inversion beyond 70 wt % nylon. Various models based on viscosity ratios were used to predict the region of phase inversion. Experiments were also carried out on in situ compatibilization using maleic anhydride-modified EPR (EPR-g-MA). In this reactive compatibilization strategy, the maleic anhydride groups of modified EPR reacted with the amino end groups of nylon. This reaction produced a graft copolymer at the blend interface, which in fact acted as the compatibilizer. The viscosity of the blend was found to increase when a few percent of modified EPR was added; at higher concentrations the viscosity leveled off, indicating a high level of interaction at the interface. Morphological investigations indicated that the size of the dispersed phase initially decreased when a few percent of the graft copolymer was added followed by a clear leveling off at higher concentration.
