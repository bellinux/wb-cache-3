25|$|The salmon {{fisheries}} of the Columbia River are now but {{a fraction}} of what they were twenty-five years ago, and what they would be now if the United States Government had taken complete charge of them by intervening between Oregon and Washington. During these twenty-five years the fishermen of each State have naturally tried to take all they could get, and the two legislatures {{have never been able to}} agree on joint action of any kind adequate in degree for the protection of the fisheries. At the moment the fishing on the Oregon side is practically closed, while there is no limit on the Washington side of any kind, and <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> what the courts will decide as to the very statutes under which this action and non-action result. Meanwhile very few salmon reach the spawning grounds, and probably four years hence the fisheries will amount to nothing; and this comes from a struggle between the associated, or gill-net, fishermen on the one hand, and the owners of the fishing wheels up the river.|$|E

[...] In the dark days of ’73 Canadians were in a state of panic, distrusting the stability of their newly-built Dominion; <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> what would have happened had not the stalwart form of Alexander Mackenzie lifted itself above the screaming, vociferating and denying mass of politicians, and all Canada felt at once, there was a man who could be trusted.

2500|$|On 20 July 2012, Environment {{minister}} Delphine Batho {{confirmed that}} the government would maintain a moratorium on shale gas exploration, saying: [...] "nowhere in the world it has been proven that this exploitation can be done without major environmental impact and major health risks". On 14 Sept. 2012, French president François Hollande canceled seven permits for shale gas drilling. He declared [...] "In our current state of knowledge, <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> that shale gas and oil extraction by hydraulic fracturing, the only technique known today, is free from serious risks to health and environment." ...|$|E

2500|$|Mélisande {{sleeps in}} a sick bed {{after giving birth}} to her child. The doctor assures Golaud that despite her wound, her {{condition}} is not serious. Overcome with guilt, Golaud claims he has killed for no reason. Pelléas and Mélisande merely kissed [...] "like a brother and sister." [...] Mélisande wakes and asks for a window to be opened so she can see the sunset. Golaud asks the doctor and Arkel {{to leave the room}} so he can speak with Mélisande alone. He blames himself for everything and begs Melisande's forgiveness. Golaud presses Mélisande to confess her forbidden love for Pelléas. She maintains her innocence in spite of Golaud's increasingly desperate pleas to her to tell the truth. Arkel and the doctor return. Arkel tells Golaud to stop before he kills Mélisande, but he replies [...] "I have already killed her." [...] Arkel hands Mélisande her newborn baby girl but she is too weak to lift the child in her arms and remarks that the baby does not cry and that she will live a sad existence. The room fills with serving women, although <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> who has summoned them. Mélisande quietly dies. At the moment of death, the serving women fall to their knees. Arkel comforts the sobbing Golaud.|$|E
60|$|<b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> what harm an {{earthquake}} will, or will not, do. There are three kinds. One {{which raises the}} ground up perpendicularly, and sets it down again--which is the least hurtful; one which sets it rolling in waves, like the waves of the sea--which is more hurtful; and one, the most terrible of all, which gives the ground a spinning motion, so that things thrown down by it fall twisted from right to left, or left to right. But what kind of earthquake will take place, <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell.</b>|$|E

6000|$|At {{last the}} savage chief {{opened his mouth}} {{as well as his}} eyes, and spoke to the savage who had brought the {{children}} into the royal presence.

5000|$|The film's name {{references}} the W.E.B. Dubois book The Souls of Black Folk. Of the film, Valerius has said, [...] "I {{think this}} piece resonates across {{race and gender}} {{because it is a}} piece that is the voice of the victim and not the voice of the victimizer or spokesman, it’s our hurts, our pains, our insecurities, our story that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> else <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> but us." ...|$|R

One day after a really bad nose bleed and a trip to the {{emergency}} room for his younger brother Jeffrey, the Alpers are shocked to discover that Jeffrey has leukemia. Everyone in Steven's family is dumbfounded and his father is very anti-social with Steven when Jeffrey goes for his chemotherapy treatments. Steven becomes very shelled in, but <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>can</b> really <b>tell,</b> except for a piano-prodigy, Annette Watson. Annette clearly has a crush on Steven, but he doesn't know.

25|$|John Gough senior died by 'taking an {{overdose}} of strichnine'. The coroner's report which might explain the reason has not survived. The day after his death, the local Burrangong Courier had no explanation for the event: `A man {{of the name of}} John George Gough, an old colonist, who occupied a butcher's shop adjoining Myers' cordial manufactory in Main Street, committed suicide yesterday morning by swallowing strychnine.

5000|$|The Brooklyn-raised emcee {{stated that}} he had been {{planning}} this album since he was 9 years old. The Salvation provides an intricate view into Skyzoo's life and experiences. The diverse range of production and the autobiographical nature is in contrast to his previous releases, with Skyzoo describing it at the time as his most personal work. A tactic taken by Skyzoo to emphasize the personal aspect of The Salvation was to not load the album up with features from other rappers, explaining that [...] "the moment you pick up a pen or start rhyming as a kid, all you think about is getting an album out. This album isn't exactly the way I planned it out at 9-years-old, but it tells my story. With that being said, <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>can</b> help <b>tell</b> my story better than me. The Salvation is about me." ...|$|R

He is a [...] widower, and brought out his little {{daughter}} with him, an only child, [...] whose sweet face was once like sunshine in our tent. Not long ago [...] this pretty flower of the desert sickened, drooped, and died, with her [...] fair head on her father's bosom. For a long time afterwards Harry was [...] inconsolable; but he took to reading the Bible, {{and the effect of}} that [...] has been wonderful. We read it regularly every night together, and <b>no</b> [...] <b>one</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> what comfort we have in it, for I too have had sorrow of [...] a kind which you could not well understand, unless I were to go into [...] an elaborate explanation.

She presently returned to her seat. 'No, I don't believe I really wish I was like poor Alice,' said she; 'I hope not; I am sure I don't for her sake. But, Mary, I never knew till I was well again how much I had reckoned on dying when she was born.
