40|$|Axon {{diameter}} is {{an important}} <b>neuroanatomical</b> <b>characteristic</b> {{of the nervous system}} that alters in the course of neurological disorders such as multiple sclerosis. Axon diameters vary, even within a fiber bundle, and are not normally distributed. An accurate distribution function is therefore beneficial, either to describe axon diameters that are obtained from a direct measurement technique (e. g., microscopy), or to infer them indirectly (e. g., using diffusion-weighted MRI). The gamma distribution is a common choice for this purpose (particularly for the inferential approach) because it resembles the distribution profile of measured axon diameters which has been consistently shown to be non-negative and right-skewed. In this study we compared a wide range of parametric probability distribution functions against empirical data obtained from electron microscopy images. We observed that the gamma distribution fails to accurately describe the main characteristics of the axon diameter distribution, such as location and scale of the mode and the profile of distribution tails. We also found that the generalized extreme value distribution consistently fitted the measured distribution better than other distribution functions. This suggests that there may be distinct subpopulations of axons in the corpus callosum, each with their own distribution profiles. In addition, we observed that several other distributions outperformed the gamma distribution, yet had the same number of unknown parameters; these were the inverse Gaussian, log normal, log logistic and Birnbaum-Saunders distributions...|$|E
40|$|Hemispheric {{function}} specialization {{and associated}} <b>neuroanatomical</b> <b>characteristics</b> {{have been a}} topic of interest for many years. In this regard, mechanisms of cortical processing and memory storage have proven elusive. The current paper proposes that a model of cortical processing based on the column {{has the potential for}} explaining laterality of function and memory. Memory formation is defined as the strengthening of synaptic con-nections in any given circuit of cortical columns, while forgetting is defined as weakened synaptic connections with failure to activate downstream columns in any given circuit. Following a discussion of the cortical column, it is suggested that speed and quantity of columnar activation can explain laterality findings. However, several additional aspects of columnar interaction patterns must be considered to explain the regional differences within each of the hemispheres. The paper concludes with a discussion of current approaches that offer a means to test the model’s validity...|$|R
40|$|Sex is a {{fundamental}} pleasure, and crucial {{to the survival of}} our species. Though not many people would disagree with the proposition that sexual behaviour depends on the brain, the neuroscientific study of human sex is still relatively taboo and much remains to be discovered. On the contrary, excellent experimental animal models (mostly rat) are available that have uncovered major behavioural, neurochemical, and <b>neuroanatomical</b> <b>characteristics</b> of sexual behaviour. Restructuring sexual behaviour into broader terms reflecting behavioural states (wanting, liking, and inhibition) facilitates species comparison, revealing many similarities between animal and human sexual pleasure cycles, some of which can serve as potential avenues of new human sex research. In particular, behavioural and brain evidence clearly shows that motivational and consummatory phases are fundamentally distinct, and that genitally-induced sexual reward is a major factor in sexual learning mechanisms. © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

40|$|Nothobranchius furzeri {{has emerged}} as a new fish model for neurobiological and age {{research}} over recent years, due to the exceptionally short lifespan, age-dependent cognitive/behavioral decline, expression of age-related biomarkers. The growing interest in this teleost has raised the need to construct an atlas of the whole brain of N. furzeri. The study has been carried out on adult specimens belonging to the long lived strain, originating from Mozambique and named MZM 04 / 10. In the atlas, the external features of brain, images of sections stained with luxol fast bleu/violet and schematic drawings of the most representative sections are showed. The identification and description of brain structures has been carried out on methodological and hodological studies. Comparative analyses have revealed remarkable and peculiar <b>neuroanatomical</b> <b>characteristics</b> of N. furzeri brain architecture. Thus, a comprehensive whole brain atlas of N. furzeri has been constructed aiming to provide a baseline for structural and functional future experiments on this emerging model organism...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{the present}} study was to use a voxel-based MRI method to {{investigate}} the <b>neuroanatomical</b> <b>characteristics</b> in subjects at high risk of developing psychosis compared with those of healthy controls and first-episode schizophrenia patients. Methods: This study included 14 subjects with at-risk mental state (ARMS), 34 patients with first-episode schizophrenia, and 51 healthy controls. We used voxel-based morphometry (VBM) with the Diffeomorphic Anatomical Registration Through Exponentiated Lie Algebra (DARTEL) tools to investigate the whole-brain difference in gray matter volume among the three groups. Results: Compared with the healthy controls, the schizophrenia patients showed significant gray matter reduction in the left anterior cingulate gyrus. There was no significant difference in the gray matter volume between the ARMS and other groups. Conclusion: The present study suggests that alteration of the anterior cingulate gyrus may be associated with development of frank psychosis. Further studies with a larger ARMS subjects would be required to examine the potential role of neuroimaging methods in the prediction of future transition into psychosis...|$|R
40|$|Strategics for {{the control}} of human {{movement}} are constrained by the <b>neuroanatomical</b> <b>characteristics</b> of the motor system. In particular, {{there is evidence that}} the capacity of muscles for producing force has a strong influence on the stability of coordination in certain movement tasks. In the present experiment, our aim was to determine whether physiological adaptations that cause relatively long-lasting changes in the ability of muscles to produce force can influence the stability of coordination in a systematic manner. We assessed the effects of resistance training on the performance of a difficult coordination task that required participants to synchronize or syncopate movements of their index finger with an auditory metronome. Our results revealed that training that increased isometric finger strength also enhanced the stability of movement coordination. These changes were accompanied by alterations in muscle recruitment patterns. In Particular, the trained muscles were recruited in a more consistent fashion following the programme of resistance training. These results indicate that resistance training produces functional adaptations of the neuroanatomical constraints that underlie the control of voluntary movement...|$|R
40|$|Background The neuropsychological {{literature}} on preterm-born children with spastic diplegia due to periventricular leukomalacia is convergent in reporting deficits in non-verbal intelligence and in visuo-spatial abilities. Nevertheless, other cognitive functions have {{found to be}} impaired, but data are scant and not correlated with neuroimaging findings. Aims This study analyzes the neuropsychological strengths and weaknesses in preterm-born children with spastic diplegia (pSD) and their relationships with neuroanatomical findings, investigated by a novel scale for MRI classification. Methods and procedures Nineteen children with pSD, mild to moderate upper limb impairment and Verbal IQ >  80, and 38 normal controls were evaluated with a comprehensive neuropsychological battery (NEPSY-II), assessing Attention/Executive Functioning, Language, Memory, Sensorimotor, Social Perception and Visuospatial Processing domains. The MRIs were quantitatively scored for lesion severity. Outcomes and results The results showed that, beyond core visuo-spatial and sensory-motor deficits, impairments in attention and executive functions were present {{in more than half}} of the sample, particularly in children with damage to the anterior corpus callosum. Conclusions and implications The findings are discussed in terms of clinical and rehabilitative implications tailored for pSD subgroups diversified for neuropsychological and <b>neuroanatomical</b> <b>characteristics...</b>|$|R
40|$|Certain {{invertebrate}} neurons can {{be identified}} by their behavioral functions. However, evolutionary divergence can cause some species to not display particular behaviors, thereby {{making it impossible to}} use physiological characteristics related to those behaviors for identifying homologous neurons across species. Therefore, to understand the neural basis of speciesspecific behavior, it is necessary to identify homologues using characteristics that are independent of physiology. In the Nudipleura mollusc Tritonia diomedea, Cerebral Neuron 2 (C 2) was first described as {{being a member of the}} swim central pattern generator (CPG). Here we demonstrate that neurochemical markers, in conjunction with previously known <b>neuroanatomical</b> <b>characteristics,</b> allow C 2 to be uniquely identified without the aid of electrophysiological measures. Specifically, C 2 had three characteristics that, taken together, identified the neuron: 1) a white cell on the dorsal surface of the cerebral ganglion, 2) an axon that projected to the contralateral pedal ganglion and through the pedal commissure, and 3) immunoreactivity for the peptides FMRFamide and Small Cardioactive Peptide B. These same anatomical and neurochemical characteristics also uniquely identified the C 2 homologue in Pleurobranchaea californica (called A 1), which was previously identified by its analogous role in the Pleurobranchaea swim CPG. Furthermore, these characteristics were used to identify C 2 homologues in Melibe leonina, Hermissenda crassicornis, and Flabellina iodinea, species that are phylogenetically closer to Tritonia than Pleurobranchaea, but do not display the same swimming behavior as Tritonia o...|$|R
40|$|Comparative {{studies of}} the {{structural}} organization of the brain are fundamental {{to our understanding of}} human brain function. However, whereas brains of experimental animals are fixed by perfusion of a fixative through the vasculature, human or ape brains are fixed by immersion after varying postmortem intervals. Although differential treatments might affect the fundamental characteristics of the tissue, this question has not been evaluated empirically in primate brains. Monkey brains were either perfused or acquired after varying postmortem intervals before immersion-fixation in 4 % paraformaldehyde. We found that the fixation method affected the <b>neuroanatomical</b> <b>characteristics</b> of the monkey hippocampal formation. Soma size was smaller in Nissl-stained, immersion-fixed tissue, although overall brain volume was larger as compared to perfusion-fixed tissue. Nonphosphorylated high-molecular-weight neurofilament immunoreactivity was lower in CA 3 pyramidal neurons, dentate mossy cells, and the entorhinal cortex, whereas it was higher in the mossy fiber pathway in immersion-fixed tissue. Serotonin-immunoreactive fibers were well stained in perfused tissue but were undetectable in immersion-fixed tissue. Although regional immunoreactivity patterns for calcium-binding proteins were not affected, intracellular staining degraded with increasing postmortem intervals. Somatostatin-immunoreactive clusters of large axonal varicosities, previously reported only in humans, were observed in immersion-fixed monkey tissue. In addition, calretinin-immunoreactive multipolar neurons, previously observed only in rodents, were found in the rostral dentate gyrus in both perfused and immersion-fixed brains. In conclusion, comparative {{studies of the}} brain must evaluate the effects of fixation on the staining pattern of each marker in every structure of interest before drawing conclusions about species differences...|$|R
40|$|The primary {{motor cortex}} (M 1) is {{involved}} in fine voluntary movements control. Previous studies have shown {{the existence of a}} dopamine (DA) innervation in M 1 of rats and monkeys that could directly modulate M 1 neuronal activity. However, none of these studies have described the precise distribution of DA terminals within M 1 functional region nor have quantified the density of this innervation. Moreover, the precise role of DA on pyramidal neuron activity still remains unclear due to conflicting results from previous studies regarding D 2 effects on M 1 pyramidal neurons. In this study we assessed in mice the <b>neuroanatomical</b> <b>characteristics</b> of DA innervation in M 1 using unbiased stereological quantification of dopamine transporter-immunostained fibers. We demonstrated {{for the first time in}} mice that DA innervates the deep layers of M 1 targeting preferentially the forelimb representation area of M 1. To address the functional role of the DA innervation on M 1 neuronal activity, we performed electrophysiological recordings of single neurons activity in vivo and pharmacologically modulated D 2 receptors activity. Local D 2 receptors activation by quinpirole enhanced pyramidal neurons spike firing rate without changes in spike firing pattern. Altogether, these results indicate that DA innervation in M 1 can increase neuronal activity through D 2 receptors activation and suggest a potential contribution to the modulation of fine forelimb movement. Given the demonstrated role for DA in fine motor skill learning in M 1, our results suggest that altered D 2 modulation of M 1 activity may be involved in the pathophysiology of movement disorders associated with disturbed DA homeostasis. <br/...|$|R
40|$|The {{goals of}} this {{dissertation}} are to identify if <b>neuroanatomical</b> <b>characteristics</b> of the amygdaloid complex (AC) - nuclei volumes, cell numbers, and cell densities - vary across non-human primate (NHP) species {{and to consider}} which AC regions might influence the development of social and emotional behavior. NHP comparisons {{at the level of}} individual amygdaloid nuclei have not been carried out in non-ape species. Chapter I summarizes what we currently know about the structure of the AC in NHP and reviews the functions of individual nuclei. Thirteen Old and New World primates, representing five species, were analyzed using standard stereological methods for nuclei volume and neuron number in 26 AC subdivisions. Chapter II explains the methods used to evaluated volumes and measure cell numbers. This paper focuses specifically on four AC nuclei (accessory basal, basal, central, and lateral). Chapter III presents my findings, which are three-fold: 1) the central nucleus volume is negatively allometric with the total amygdala volume while the accessory basal, basal, and lateral nuclei are isometric or changing {{at the same rate as}} the whole AC; 2) the central nucleus neuron numbers are increasing at a slower rate than the neurons in the three nuclei of the basolateral complex; 3) neuron density remains consistent across all nuclei evaluated. My data indicate that the central nucleus may have evolved differently from the three other amygdala nuclei I have evaluated. The isometric relationship between the neuron numbers and volume of the nuclei of the basolateral complex and the AC suggest that these nuclei evolved together. Chapter IV discusses some evolutionary interpretations of the data and speculates upon what these changes in AC structure could have on social behavio...|$|R
40|$|Background: 22 q 11. 2 {{deletion}} syndrome (22 q 11 DS) {{is associated}} with intellectual disability, poor social interaction and a high prevalence of psychosis. However, to date {{there have been no}} studies comparing cognition and <b>neuroanatomical</b> <b>characteristics</b> of 22 q 11 DS with other syndromes to investigate if the cognitive strengths and difficulties and neuroanatomical differences associated with 22 q 11 DS are specific to the syndrome. Hence, {{it is difficult to know}} if the observed features of 22 q 11 DS are simply due to a non-specific effect of having a genetic disorder or are specific to 22 q 11 DS. Methods: In this study, cognition and brain anatomy of 12 children with 22 q 11 DS were compared to 12 age, gender and full scale IQ (FSIQ) matched children with William syndrome (WS) in order to investigate which cognitive and neuroanatomical features are specific to 22 q 11 DS. We chose WS since the literature suggests that both groups have areas of physical/cognitive/behavioural overlap but as yet there has been no direct comparison of the two groups. Results: Despite being matched on FSIQ the WS group had significantly greater impairment than those with 22 q 11 DS on tests of Performance IQ, while performing significantly better on tasks measuring verbal, social and facial processing skills. Moreover there were significant differences in brain anatomy. Despite similar overall brain volumes, midline anomalies were more common among the 22 q 11 DS group, and regional differences such as increased striatal volumes and reduced cerebellar volumes in the 22 q 11 DS group were detected. Conclusions: These findings suggest that although the behavioural phenotype is similar in some aspects there are key differences in cognition and neuroanatomy between the two groups. Different neuropsychological profiles need to be considered when designing educational frameworks for working with these children...|$|R

Here, structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data collected from a large sample of BD and SCZ patients and healthy controls (HC) were analyzed in terms of gray matter volume (GMV) using both voxel based morphometry (VBM) and a region of interest (ROI) approach. The analysis was conducted on two datasets, Dataset 1 (802 subjects: 243 SCZ, 176 BD, 383 HC) and Dataset 2, a homogeneous subset of Dataset 1 (301 subjects: 107 HC, 85 BD and 109 SCZ). General Linear Model analyses were performed 1) at the voxel-level in the whole brain (VBM study), 2) at the regional level in the anatomical regions emerged from the VBM study (ROI study). The GMV comparison across groups was integrated with the analysis of GMV correlates of different clinical dimensions. The VBM results of Dataset 1 showed 1) in BD compared to HC, GMV deficits in right cingulate, superior temporal and calcarine cortices, 2) in SCZ compared to HC, GMV deficits in widespread cortical and subcortical areas, 3) in SCZ compared to BD, GMV deficits in insula and thalamus (p< 0. 05, cluster family wise error corrected). The regions showing GMV deficits in the BD group were mostly included in the SCZ ones. The ROI analyses confirmed the VBM results at the regional level {{in most of the}} clusters from the SCZ vs. HC comparison (p< 0. 05, Bonferroni corrected). The VBM and ROI analyses of Dataset 2 provided further evidence for the enhanced GMV deficits characterizing SCZ. Based on the clinical-neuroanatomical analyses, we cannot exclude possible confounding effects due to 1) age of onset and medication in BD patients, 2) symptoms severity in SCZ patients. Our study reported both shared and specific <b>neuroanatomical</b> <b>characteristics</b> between the two disorders, suggesting more severe and generalized GMV deficits in SCZ, with a specific role for insula and thalamus...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Although {{impaired}} general intellectual {{ability is}} a prevalent feature in schizophrenia, patterns suggesting preserved, deteriorated, and premorbidly impaired intellect {{have also been}} identified. The main purpose {{of this investigation was}} to examine the clinical, cognitive, and <b>neuroanatomical</b> <b>characteristics</b> of these intellectual subtypes, and to establish the value and validity of this approach for reducing the heterogeneity of schizophrenia. Methods: A total of 71 patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and 66 healthy controls were assessed. A preserved performance pattern (n= 29) was defined by average-range estimated premorbid and current IQ with no evidence of decline (premorbid- current IQ difference < 10 points). A deteriorated pattern (n= 14) was defined by a difference between estimated premorbid and current IQ estimates of 10 points or more. A premorbidly impaired pattern (n= 14) was defined by below average estimated premorbid and current IQ and no evidence of decline greater than 10 points. The groups were compared on demographic, neurocognitive, clinical, and neuroanatomical variables. Results: Patients with the preserved pattern outperformed those meeting criteria for deteriorated and premorbidly impaired intellectual ability on a composite measure of neurocognitive ability, as well as on indicators of processing speed, attention, working memory, verbal and visual memory, and social cognition. However, preserved patients scored lower than control participants on tests of processing speed, verbal memory, and reasoning/problem solving. Patients demonstrating the deteriorated and premorbidly impaired patterns were indistinguishable across all cognitive measures. The patient groups were clinically indistinguishable from each other and showed a similar pattern of widespread cortical thinning compared to controls. Conclusions: Cognitive impairment is a core feature of schizophrenia present to some degree in all patients, regardless of their intellectual status. Therefore, IQ fails to capture the true breadth of cognitive impairment in schizophrenia. Although the preserved subtype has partial validation, comprehensive neurocognitive data provides little support for the distinctiveness of deteriorative relative to premorbid intellectual compromise. Cognitive ability and symptom severity represent independent disease processes in schizophrenia, and cortical thinning across the brain appears to reflect a shared disease process with no association to intellectual or cognitive status...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Theories suggest two motivations {{that drive}} people to consume alcohol at {{pathological}} levels: (1) seeking of short-term pleasurable effects and (2) alleviation of unpleasant states. The former {{is associated with}} binge drinking (BD; i. e. high intake during fewer occasions) and the latter with heavy drinking (HD; substantial intake during more occasions). Although direct comparisons have not been made, BD {{has been associated with}} impairments in top-down executive control (related to frontal-parietal regions) and HD has been linked to bottom-up changes in internal mentation (related to the default mode network anatomical structure and function). This dissertation compares the two drinking patterns with the goal of testing for differential neurocognitive and <b>neuroanatomical</b> <b>characteristics</b> that would be indicative of two disorder subtypes. METHODS: The sample consisted of adult participants with a history of adolescent onset: BD (N = 16), HD (N = 15), and Healthy Controls (HC; N = 21). All groups were equated on age, education, amount of lifetime alcohol consumed (BD and HD groups), as well as other factors. The study compared group performance on an affective go/no go task and group differences in brain volume and cortical thickness based on structural MRI. RESULTS: Behavioral results showed a higher number of errors for the HD group, in comparison to other groups. Volumetric results indicated a smaller bilateral ventral diencephalon in both BD and HD, in comparison to the HC, and smaller bilateral globus pallidus in BD only. Cortical thickness analyses revealed a thinner left superior parietal region (overlapping with the dorsal attention and fronto-parietal networks) in BD, whereas a left medial occipito-parietal region was thicker in HD (overlapping mainly with the visual network). CONCLUSION: These data, interpreted in the context of prior studies, suggest that BD findings might be indicative of an executive control dysregulation that could contribute to continued BD. HD findings might be indicative of tissue damage due to frequent drinking. Prior research has found the occipital region to have the highest concentration γ-Aminobutyric acid receptors that are affected by alcohol, which might explain the thicker occipital region findings in the HD group...|$|R

40|$|Myoclonus is {{the second}} most common {{involuntary}} non-epileptic movement in intensive care units following tremor-like gestures. Although there are several types of myoclonus, they remain underappreciated, and their diagnostic and prognostic associations are largely ignored. This review discusses clinical, electrophysiological, <b>neuroanatomical,</b> and neuroimaging <b>characteristics</b> of different types of myoclonus in critically ill adults along with their prognostic impact and treatment options. Myoclonus is characterized by a sudden, brief, and sometimes repetitive muscle contraction of body parts, or a brief and sudden cessation of tonic muscle innervation followed by a rapid recovery of tonus. Myoclonus can resemble physiologic and other pathologic involuntary movements. Neurologic injuries, anesthetics, and muscle relaxants interfere with the typical appearance of myoclonus. Identifying "real myoclonus" and determining the neuroanatomical origin are important, as treatment responses depend on the involved neuroanatomical structures. The identification of the type of myoclonus, the involved neuroanatomical structures, and the associated illnesses is essential to direct treatment. In conclusion, the combined clinical, electrophysiological, and neuroradiological examination reliably uncovers the neuroanatomical sources and the pathophysiology of myoclonus. Recognizing cortical myoclonus is critical, as it is treatable and may progress to generalized convulsive seizures or status epilepticus...|$|R

Many of the critical <b>neuroanatomical</b> and functional <b>characteristics</b> of prefrontal cortex are preserved in rodents, allowing for meaningful cross-species comparisons relevant {{to the study of}} cognitive aging.

A particular emphasis is placed on behavioral approaches used to assess working memory and cognitive flexibility, which are sensitive to decline with age across species and for which strong rodent models currently exist.

Cortical atrophy and ventricular enlargement were characteristic features of the aged canine brain. Vascular volume did not vary as a function of age and BBB permeability exhibited a nonsignificant increasing trend with age.

Here, we present an overview of our current knowledge and a snapshot of ongoing research into these microcircuits. Rich in detail, Hippocampal Microcircuits: A Computational Modeler’s Resource Book provides focused and easily accessible reviews on various aspects of the theme. It is an unparalleled resource of information, including both data and techniques that will be an invaluable companion to all those wishing to develop computational models of hippocampal neurons and neuronal networks. The book is divided into two main parts. In the first part, leading experimental neuroscientists discuss data on the electrophysiological, <b>neuroanatomical,</b> and molecular <b>characteristics</b> of hippocampal circuits. The various types of excitatory and inhibitory neurons are reviewed along with their connectivity and synaptic properties. Single cell and ensemble activity patterns are presented from in vitro models, as well as anesthetized and freely moving animals.

40|$|Background: When {{psychosis}} first presents, {{and particularly}} in the case of schizophrenia, the guidelines recommend rapid institution of treatment with atypical antipsychotics. Two different clinical pictures can be observed: psychoses with acute onset and those with insidious onset. Acute cases (60 % of the total) have a favourable course in 85 % of young patients but where onset is insidious and the symptoms are predominantly negative, the course is poor in 25 % of subjects. Since acute symptoms are relatively easy to diagnose, it is diagnosis of the “insidious/negative” cases that represents a major challenge. Is such a diagnosis possible yet? How can we limit the number of false negatives and false positives with the attendant risk of stigma? What treatment should be administered? Methods: Review of the literature (PubMed, PsycARTICLES, PsycINFO) and comparison with clinical practice here. Results: Young people with a high risk of developing psychosis can be identified using scales such as SOPS (Scale of Prodromal Symptoms), PACE (Personal Assessment and Crisis Evaluation) or from the presence of <b>neuroanatomical</b> and genetic <b>characteristics.</b> Unfortunately, these tools are more specific for positive symptoms, and therefore identify a sub-population of young people at risk: those at Ultra-High Risk (UHR). It can be argued that effective treatment is available for these UHR young people to prevent the condition from developing into schizophrenia. On the other hand, the problem persists for young people presenting an insidious onset and predominantly negative symptoms: to date we have no real way of either screening them or assessing the efficacy of a treatment. Conclusion: “Ultra-High Risk” patients are starting to represent a separate nosological entity. This entity is made up of young patients, most of whom have positive symptoms. If left untreated, the course will lead to seriously compromised social and psychological functioning. Rapid diagnosis and treatment for UHRs is therefore essential. In the future we need to refine our diagnostic tools to make them sufficiently specific and sensitive but also so that the widest category of “Risk Syndrome for Psychosis” includes young patients with mostly negative symptoms...|$|R
