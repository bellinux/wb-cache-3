25|$|Extinctions include {{that of the}} endemic Norfolk kākā and Norfolk ground dove {{along with}} endemic {{subspecies}} of pigeon, starling, triller, thrush and boobook owl, though the latter's genes persist in a hybrid population descended from the last female.

25|$|Norfolk Island, with {{neighbouring}} Nepean Island, {{has been}} identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area because it supports the entire populations of white-chested and slender-billed white-eyes, <b>Norfolk</b> <b>parakeets</b> and <b>Norfolk</b> gerygones, as well as over 1% of the world populations of wedge-tailed shearwaters and red-tailed tropicbirds. Nearby Phillip Island is treated as a separate IBA.|$|R
50|$|Norfolk Island National Park is a {{protected}} area of 6.50 km2 established in 1984 and {{managed by the}} Commonwealth of Australia. It comprises two sections, the Mount Pitt section on Norfolk Island in the South Pacific Ocean with an area of 4.60 km2 and the neighbouring 1.90 km2 Phillip Island, {{as well as the}} much smaller Nepean Island. The Norfolk Island group is an Australian territory and the park is managed by Parks Australia. It is {{the only place in the}} world where the <b>Norfolk</b> Island <b>parakeet</b> and the white-chested white-eye occur.|$|R
50|$|R. baueri reaches 10 m {{or more in}} height. The pinnate {{leaves are}} 3 to 4 m long, on a stout, erect petiole (leafstem) {{approximately}} 20 cm long. The crownshaft is 50-60 cm long. The inflorescence is 30 50 cm long and has from 50 to 60 fairly stout branches. The fruits are green at first, turning a bright red when ripe, and are a favorite food of the endangered <b>Norfolk</b> Island <b>parakeet.</b> The growing tip of the palm was used by early settlers as a vegetable and {{is said to have}} tasted like a nut when raw and like an artichoke bottom when boiled.|$|R

5000|$|Around 1910, a {{small number}} of crimson rosellas were {{released}} off the Otago heads, New Zealand, along with eastern rosellas. These interbred and by the 1950s no pure crimson rosellas remained. This mixed population has remained there ever since. Crimson rosellas were also present in Wellington City from 1963 through the early 1990s as an introduced species. Two crimson rosellas were also recorded from the Tararua foothills in 1971. It is now thought to be extinct in the wild in New Zealand. They have also been introduced to Norfolk Island, where they are often known as [...] "red parrots", to distinguish them from the native <b>Norfolk</b> Island <b>parakeet</b> or [...] "green parrots".|$|R

50|$|The <b>Norfolk</b> <b>parakeet</b> (Cyanoramphus cookii), {{also called}} Tasman parakeet, Norfolk Island green parrot or Norfolk Island red-crowned parakeet, is {{a species of}} parrot in the family Psittaculidae. It is endemic to Norfolk Island (located between Australia, New Zealand and New Caledonia in the Tasman Sea). The species was once {{considered}} a subspecies of the red-fronted parakeet of New Zealand. The name Tasman parakeet is used by Christidis and Boles on the argument that this species and the Lord Howe red-crowned parakeet (Cyanoramphus novaezelandiae subflavescens) are probably a single species for which they use biogeographical arguments. Tasman is used for other species with the same distribution and they propose that name for that reason. However, the latter subspecies {{was not included in}} the genus-wide phylogenetic reconstruction using DNA sequences, and the lumping of the species should be considered tentative.|$|E
5000|$|The Polynesians {{who lived}} at the Island for some time {{before the arrival of}} the Europeans hunted the kākā for food before disappearing from the island around the 1600s. It was also hunted for food and trapped as a pet after the arrival of the first {{settlers}} in 1788. The species' population suffered heavily after a penal colony was maintained from 1788 to 1814, and again from 1825 to 1854. The species likely became extinct in the wild {{in the early nineteenth century}} some time during the period of this second penal colony. It was not recorded by Ensign Abel D. W. Best on either Norfolk or Phillip Island in his 1838/1839 diary entries. As Best collected specimens for ornithology, including the <b>Norfolk</b> <b>parakeet</b> (which he called [...] "lories", being similar in shape), it is hard to accept that he would not have documented this much more attractive quarry, had the kākā still been present. The last bird in captivity died in London in 1851.|$|E
