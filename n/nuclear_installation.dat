25|$|Iraq was a {{signatory}} to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, placing its reactors under International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards. In October 1981, the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists published {{excerpts from}} the testimony of Roger Richter, a former IAEA inspector who described the weaknesses of the agency's nuclear safeguards to the United States Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Richter testified that only part of Iraq's <b>nuclear</b> <b>installation</b> was under safeguard and that the most sensitive facilities were not even subject to safeguards. IAEA's Director-General Sigvard Eklund issued a rebuttal saying that Richter had never inspected Osirak and had never been assigned to inspect facilities in the Middle East. Eklund claimed that the safeguards procedures were effective {{and that they were}} supplemented by precautionary measures taken by the nuclear suppliers. Anthony Fainberg, a physicist at the Brookhaven National Laboratory, disputed Richter's claim that a fuel processing program for the manufacturing of nuclear weapons could have been conducted secretly. Fainberg wrote that there was barely enough fuel on the site to make one bomb, and that the presence of hundreds of foreign technicians would have made it impossible for the Iraqis to take the necessary steps without being discovered.|$|E

Its construction commenced in 1958, with French assistance. The official reason given by the Israeli and French governments was to build a nuclear reactor to power a [...] "desalination plant", in order to [...] "green the Negev". The purpose of the Dimona plant is widely assumed to be the manufacturing of nuclear weapons, and the majority of defense experts have concluded that it does in fact do that. However, the Israeli government refuses to confirm or deny this publicly, a policy it refers to as [...] "ambiguity".|$|E

If Egypt is not actually at war with Israel, but Israel has fully mobilized on the Egyptian border and so Egypt has likewise done so, the Libyan/Egyptian conflict can be quite prolonged, but Egypt usually still wins (and has not taken too many losses, since it only has one brigade in combat). Libya is capable of setting up a <b>nuclear</b> <b>installation,</b> but almost never uses nuclear warheads when at war with Egypt.|$|E

The {{significance}} of their inclusion in risk assessment of <b>nuclear</b> <b>installations</b> has consequently been self-evident {{from the very beginning of}} the development of probabilistic safety assessment (PSA). The methodology of seismic probabilistic safety assessment (SPSA) for <b>nuclear</b> <b>installations</b> was first developed in the late 1970 s in the United States but, over time, applications and refinements have been made throughout the world. Given international interest and the importance of the issue, the NEA sponsored several activities in the fi eld. A Workshop on Seismic Risk was organised in Tokyo in August 1999 to discuss SPSA and seismic margin assessment (SMA) methodologies for <b>nuclear</b> <b>installations.</b> 1 The workshop itself benefi ted from a state-of-the-art report on the same topic. 2 In 2002, the NEA Committee on the Safety of <b>Nuclear</b> <b>Installations</b> (CSNI) issued a brief technical opinion paper on seismic PSA. 3 Since the 1999 workshop, SPSA has been applied widely at many nuclear power plants around the world. There have also been technical advances in several aspects of the overall methodology. Today, SPSA is judged to be a mature technology for assessing the risk to <b>nuclear</b> <b>installations</b> from earthquakes. Related methodologies, notably the probabilistic seismic hazard analysis (PSHA) assessing the seismicity hazard and its uncertainties, and the SMA assessing the safety margin against seismic events, are also in widespread use...|$|R
