It is {{owned and operated}} by <b>Netrepreneur</b> Connections Enterprises and is a sister-company of the Philippine buy and sell website Sulit.com.ph. Pinoy Auto Trader is primarily a business-to-consumer (B2C) website.|$|E
50|$|Shortly after launch, Pinoy Auto Trader founders {{met with}} RJ David, the Co-Founder and Managing Director of Sulit.com.ph to discuss {{potential}} collaboration and possible investment opportunities. On February 28, 2013 Pinoy Auto Trader was officially acquired by <b>Netrepreneur</b> Connections Enterprises (Sulit.com.ph). The {{announcement of the}} acquisition was made public on July 3, 2013 during an official press conference which also marked the release of version 2.0 of the Pinoy Auto Trader website.|$|E
40|$|This chapter {{considers}} the pedagogic requirements of entrepreneurial education within one specific context of e-commerce. It documents and evaluates {{the development of}} an e-commerce trading simulation “Netrepreneur”, which was first introduced in a development stage at the European Association for Education and Research in Commercial Distribution in 2002 and later published in the Journal of Retail and Distribution Management in 2004. <b>Netrepreneur</b> is a virtual world that users can run to learn the general dynamics of business-to-consumer (B 2 C). E-commerce venture creation is one of the complex causes of casualties in the online economy. The virtual world is represented by a shopping mall within which entrepreneurs can design and implement Web-based companies to market virtual goods/services online to a large group of users. ‘Consumers’ then use the site and their behaviour is monitored to form the basis of a future business plan. The later part of the chapter reviews the finding of a post-evaluation survey that was undertaken with an undergraduate e-enterprise teaching programme of 100 students. The methodology adopted was grounded in the current body of knowledge within the field of ‘presence’ (Witmer & Singer, 2005) and which was measured by the Presence Questionnaire (PQ). The post evaluation feedback from Netretpreneur demonstrates that a strong sense of presence was experienced by participants and that this {{plays an important role in}} the process of the transfer of skills by emulating the behaviour of the practitioners. Netrepeneur has been used by universities to facilitate undergraduate-level learning. It has also been used by The Retail Enterprise Network, an organisation created under the European EQUAL initiative to develop ways of protecting and promoting diversity within the SME retail sector, in its training programmes for both Spanish and British users...|$|E
40|$|Current {{and future}} {{requirements}} of the aerospace sensors and transducers field make it necessary for the design and development of new data acquisition devices and instrumentation systems. New designs are sought to incorporate self-health, self-calibrating, self-repair capabilities, allowing greater measurement reliability and extended calibration cycles. With the addition of power management schemes, state-of-the-art data acquisition systems allow data to be processed and presented to the users with increased efficiency and accuracy. The design architecture {{presented in this paper}} displays an innovative approach to data acquisition systems. The design incorporates: electronic health self-check, device/system self-calibration, electronics and function self-repair, failure detection and prediction, and power management (reduced power consumption). These requirements are driven by the aerospace industry need to reduce operations and maintenance costs, to accelerate processing time and to provide reliable hardware with minimum costs. The project's design architecture incorporates some commercially available components identified during the market research investigation like: Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) Programmable Analog Integrated Circuits (PAC IC) and Field Programmable Analog Arrays (FPAA); Digital Signal Processing (DSP) electronic/system control and investigation of specific characteristics found in technologies like: Electronic Component Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF); and Radiation Hardened Component Availability. There are three main sections discussed in the design architecture presented in this document. They are the following: (a) Analog Signal Module Section, (b) Digital Signal/Control Module Section and (c) Power Management Module Section. These sections are discussed in detail in the following pages. This approach to data acquisition systems has resulted in the assignment of patent rights to Kennedy Space Center under U. S. patent # 6, 462, 684. Furthermore, NASA KSC commercialization office has issued licensing rights to Circuit Avenue <b>Netrepreneurs,</b> LLC, a minority-owned business founded in 1999 located in Camden, NJ...|$|R
