25|$|Complex {{social network}} {{analysis}} is used to study the dynamics of large, complex social networks. Dynamic network analysis brings together traditional {{social network analysis}}, link analysis and multi-agent systems within network science and <b>network</b> <b>theory.</b> Through the use of key concepts and methods in social network analysis, agent-based modeling, theoretical physics, and modern mathematics (particularly graph theory and fractal geometry), this method of inquiry brought insights into the dynamics and structure of social systems.

25|$|A {{theoretical}} framework explaining {{the workings of}} the adaptive immune system is provided by immune <b>network</b> <b>theory,</b> based on interactions between idiotypes (unique molecular features of one clonotype, i.e. the unique set of antigenic determinants of the variable portion of an antibody) and 'anti-idiotypes' (antigen receptors that react with the idiotype {{as if it were a}} foreign antigen). This theory, which builds on the existing clonal selection hypothesis and since 1974 has been developed mainly by Niels Jerne and Geoffrey W. Hoffmann, is seen as being relevant to the understanding of the HIV pathogenesis and the search for an HIV vaccine.|$|E
25|$|Food webs {{are limited}} {{representations}} of real ecosystems as they necessarily aggregate many species into trophic species, which are functional groups {{of species that}} have the same predators and prey in a food web. Ecologists use these simplifications in quantitative (or mathematical) models of trophic or consumer-resource systems dynamics. Using these models they can measure and test for generalized patterns {{in the structure of}} real food web networks. Ecologists have identified non-random properties in the topographic structure of food webs. Published examples that are used in meta analysis are of variable quality with omissions. However, the number of empirical studies on community webs is on the rise and the mathematical treatment of food webs using <b>network</b> <b>theory</b> had identified patterns that are common to all. Scaling laws, for example, predict a relationship between the topology of food web predator-prey linkages and levels of species richness.|$|E
40|$|AbstractEarthquakes, hurricanes, {{flooding}} and terrorist attacks pose a severe {{threat to our}} society. What’s more, when such a disaster happens, it can spread {{in a wide range}} with ubiquitous presence of a large-scale networked system. Therefore, the emergency/disaster management faces new challenges that the decision-makers have extra difficulties in perceiving the disaster dynamic spreading processes under this networked environment. This study tries to use the complex <b>networks</b> <b>theory</b> to tackle this complexity and the result shows the theory is a promising approach to support disaster/emergency management by focusing on simulation experiments of small world networks and scale free <b>networks.</b> The <b>theory</b> can be used to capture and describe the evolution mechanism, evolution discipline and overall behavior of a networked system. In particular, the complex <b>networks</b> <b>theory</b> is very strong at analyzing the complexity and dynamical changes of a networked system, which can improve the situation awareness after a disaster has occurred and help perceive its dynamic process, which is very important for high-quality decision making. In addition, this study also shows the use of the complex <b>networks</b> <b>theory</b> can build a visualized process to track the dynamic spreading of a disaster in a networked system...|$|R

25|$|Michel Callon's {{concept of}} framing {{provides}} a useful schema: each economic act or transaction occurs against, incorporates and also re-performs a geographically and cultural specific complex of social histories, institutional arrangements, rules and connections. These network relations are simultaneously bracketed, so that persons and transactions may be disentangled from thick social bonds. The character of calculability is imposed upon agents as they come to work in markets and are “formatted” as calculative agencies. Market exchanges contain a history of struggle and contestation that produced actors predisposed to exchange under certain sets of rules. Therefore, for Challon, market transactions can never be disembedded from social and geographic relations {{and there is no}} sense to talking of degrees of embeddedness and disembeddeness. An emerging theme is the interrelationship, inter-penetrability and variations of concepts of persons, commodities, and modes of exchange under particular market formations. This is most pronounced in recent movement towards post-structuralist theorizing that draws on Michel Foucault and Actor <b>Network</b> <b>Theory</b> and stress relational aspects of person-hood, and dependence and integration into networks and practical systems. Commodity network approaches further both deconstruct and show alternatives to the market models concept of commodities.|$|E
