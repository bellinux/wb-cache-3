[...] They were also active in seeking the vote: in 1913 a delegation of them arrived at the legislature demanding the vote; Sifton asked them [...] "did you ladies wash up your luncheon dishes before you came down here to ask me for the vote? [...] If you haven't you'd better go home because you're <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>any</b> votes from me." [...] In October 1914 another delegation arrived, bearing the signatures of 40,000 people. [...] At that time, the Premier agreed that most traditional objections to extension of the franchise were [...] "played out", but expressed concern at the increases that would result {{to the cost of}} elections and uncertainty at whether most of the province's women actually wanted suffrage. [...] In February 1915 a larger delegation arrived at the legislature and occupied the MLAs' seats, demanding that the franchise be extended quickly enough to allow women to vote in the upcoming prohibition referendum; an angry Sifton refused and suggested to the women that if they wanted the vote, they should contact their MLAs and promise that they would use their votes to re-elect them, [...] "which is after all one of the strongest way in which you can appeal to male human nature, as represented in the legislature." [...] Even so, he committed to raising the issue in the legislature after the referendum. [...] On September 17, 1915, he told UFA President James Speakman that he had given instructions for the preparation of a statute [...] "placing men and women in Alberta on the basis of absolute equality so far as Provincial matters are concerned." [...] True to his word, he introduced legislation in the spring of 1916 giving women the vote in all provincial and municipal elections. [...] The Conservatives supported it enthusiastically, and only St. Albert MLA Lucien Boudreau voted against it (though Ribstone Liberal James Gray Turgeon admitted that he was supporting his leader's legislation against his own convictions).|$|E

No sooner does he say that than he comes across an alarm clock, that rings and wakes up another hibernating bear. Thinking Daffy to be {{responsible}} for the rude awakening, the bear chases him straight into a cave where Bugs directs them. Bugs then seals up the cave entrance with a boulder, leaving the bear to pummel Daffy, who finally exits the cave looking a little worse for wear.|$|E

Neither the initial attempt nor a later attempt at it went well, and both times {{he returned to the}} Mega Man sprite comic. Anez has stated that he hated the hand-drawn comic. The hand-drawn comic made something of a return in the storyline [...] "All Good Things"—the hand-drawn format is used to represent George's home dimension, though this time drawn by Liss, Dave's wife. Dave stated {{the reason for this is}} he realized that he still could not draw, and was <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>any</b> better.|$|E
5000|$|Fullbright's debut studio release From the Ground Up - {{released}} on May 8, 2012 - was recorded and mixed at 115 Recording in Norman, Oklahoma with producer/engineer Wes Sharon. The {{title of the}} release pays homage to the farmhouse where he grew up. Fullbright states: [...] "Every song on this record was written in that house, and I was kind of written in that house." [...] In the studio with his backing musicians, Fullbright was almost immediately captivated by what he was hearing. Although he initially thought he would leave the studio with a demo record, he says: [...] "We got lost in it in those three hours we were recording. We all {{looked at each other}} and thought, ‘No, this is the record. It’s <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>any</b> better than this anywhere else." ...|$|E

I’m {{disappointed}} that these people think that way, but that is because of the previous culture and attitude around Eclipse, and I would have hoped that these people would give us the time to fix what needs to be fixed and then come back to us. I think most of them will understand {{that there are so many}} other financial obligations that doing something like this makes no sense, just causes more damage, and then they’re <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>any</b> money anyway. I would be surprised if a bankruptcy judge would even go there with all the jobs at stake and all the other obligations at stake. I’m disappointed that these people hold a grudge against the company while they see the company changing." ...|$|E
50|$|Since {{the spill}} on March 29, {{there have been}} {{conflicting}} reports {{as to whether the}} oil sands oil has reached Lake Conway. Official reports have indicated that there is no oil in Lake Conway, but an independent study claims to have samples showing oil in the water column. Scott Smith of Opflex, an oil clean-up company, states that official samples are of surface water only: “Exxon and the EPA are taking instantaneous water samples, grab samples from the surface. Obviously if the contaminants in oil sands oil, and chemicals, are in the water column beneath the surface you’re <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>any</b> of those molecules to test.” Keith Stephens of Arkansas Game and Fish has countered these findings, pointing out that there have been no dead fish or other wildlife that would indicate that there is oil in {{the main body of the}} lake.|$|E
50|$|The Kimpo {{airfield}} was {{the largest}} and most important in Korea. On September 17, General MacArthur was extremely urgent in his request for the early capture of Kimpo airfield. Once it was secured, the Fifth Air Force could bring fighters and bombers over from Japan to operate more easily against North Korea. The attack on Kimpo airfield was carried out by 2nd Battalion 5th Marines. That night at Kimpo, the North Koreans under the command of Brigadier General Wan Yong (the commander of the North Korean air force) were organizing their defense of the airfield. His troops were a conglomeration of half-trained fighting men and service forces. Several North Korean troops had already fled across the Han River toward Seoul to escape the fight. The North Koreans' defense was almost as bad as the morale of the men who realized that they were <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>any</b> help from the North Korean officials in Seoul.|$|E

Speaking of Madden, who had expressed no remorse or emotion {{in response to his}} actions throughout the trials, his lawyer said [...] "Kevin desperately needs treatment, and unfortunately he's <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> it. We could have had 10 years of in-depth treatment in the youth system and he's <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> it."

50|$|Jim Rhodes, {{formerly}} War Machine but {{now down}} on his luck, came to Little Mogadishu {{to look into the}} murder of his estranged sister, and when it became apparent that the police were <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>any</b> results, he took the matter into his own hands. He delivered the men responsible for his sister's murder to the police in a neatly tied up package for them, coming across the local Muslim preacher Josiah X along the way. However, this was not enough to satisfy Rhodey, and he set his sights on the 66 Bridges leader, Triage. His covert, vigilante action and contact with Josiah put him on Kasper Cole's radar, making Kasper suspicious of what a guy like Rhodey was doing in a place like the Mog. Rhodey hit Little Mogadishu like a force of nature, derailing the secret money train that delivered bribes in bulk to a large number of corrupt officials. This action drew in Junta, who smelled opportunity to leverage his way back into the spy business if he could get a piece of the action. He found himself drafted into Rhodey's plan along with Kasper Cole and eventually a reluctant Josiah X.|$|E

40|$|Much of {{the book}} is devoted to {{discussing}} the heavy human dependence on grasslands and whether this relationship can be maintained in company with grassland conservation. Can humans continue to use grasslands for food, fiber, and newer uses like biofuels and carbon banking while still sustaining the ecosystem? Many of us in academic ecology struggle with resolving perceived conflicts between conservation and human grassland use. In many cases, a 2 ̆ 2 win-win 2 ̆ 2 scenario exists in which, for example, the proper use of livestock grazing is perfectly compatible with a healthy grassland ecosystem. In other cases, such as conserving prairie dog populations, tensions have to be negotiated. Truett discusses some promising strategies that benefit both conservation and landowner concerns, such as conservation easements, conservation grants, and ecotourism. Grasslands comprise the western 2 ̆ 2 wide open spaces 2 ̆ 2 that figure prominently in the country 2 ̆ 7 s imagination. Not many of us, even ardent conservationists, are eager to see the iconic ranching and cowboy culture disappear. Truett, however, points out that making a living in these remote areas is <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>any</b> easier, especially with the dwindling supply and increased cost of fossil fuels. Maintaining miles of fence line, for example, involves huge outlays in transportation costs. A clear-eyed view of expenses versus profit in ranching does not paint a rosy picture for continued economic viability. In fact, Truett makes the point that most existing ranch operations have significant subsidies, often {{in the form of a}} wife 2 ̆ 7 s job in town...|$|E

[...] The police arrived and {{convinced}} a black man sitting behind the two women to move so that Mrs. Hamilton could move back, but Colvin still refused. She was forcibly removed from the bus and arrested by the two policemen, Thomas J. Ward and Paul Headley. This event took place nine months before the NAACP secretary Rosa Parks was famously arrested for the same offense. Claudette Colvin: [...] "My mother told me to be quiet about what I did.
