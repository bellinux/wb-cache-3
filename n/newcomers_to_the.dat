5|$|The {{game was}} {{designed}} as a playing experience that <b>newcomers</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> series could come to. Its presentation was compared to that of a fairy tale, as depicting the usual style of the series would have been difficult on the platform. Both Tetsuya Nomura and Yoko Shimomura, veterans from the main series, returned as director and composer respectively. The game received favorable reception from critics.|$|E
5|$|The 75-minute film premiered at the 2008 Tribeca Film Festival {{before its}} {{television}} premiere on Animal Planet on May 25, 2008. While it was praised for its cinematography, {{for maintaining the}} depth of coverage of the television series, and for its accessibility to <b>newcomers</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> series, it was criticized for not offering anything new to fans. The Kalahari Meerkat Project noted that the film was not completely accurate but praised it overall and recommended against analyzing it. Several reviewers praised Goldberg's narration, but the script was criticized as being too simplistic for adult viewers.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the 1948 season, on December 2, the Indians traded Groth to the Chicago White Sox {{along with}} Bob Kuzava for Frank Papish. After signing a {{contract}} with the White Sox, Groth took part in spring, training alongside many other <b>newcomers</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> White Sox, where his pitching performance earned him a place on the major league roster. He pitched in three games for the White Sox, losing one, and finished his tenure with the White Sox with a 5.40 ERA in five innings pitched. After his final game on May 4, the White Sox purchased Ed Klieman and sold Groth to the Kansas City Blues, a New York Yankees minor league team, ending his major league career.|$|E

5|$|Conceived from a name {{idea for}} a Swedish character, Lars was given a moveset fitting with other strong {{characters}} in the series, to make him easy to use by <b>newcomers</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> franchise. Lars had a mixed reception from video game reviewers. While some critics praised his fighting style, even suggesting him to new players of the franchise, his design was met with a negative response; most reviewers found it ridiculous, often referring to his spiky hair. Nevertheless, he has been popular among fans of the franchise, often ranking {{as one of its}} most popular characters.|$|E
5|$|Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U {{features}} {{a roster of}} 58 playable characters (51 on-disc and 7 available as downloadable content) taken from both Nintendo's first-party franchises and some third-party franchises, including returning character Sonic the Hedgehog.

5|$|The inaugural 2005game {{featured}} a Florida State win over Virginia Tech, 27–22. In 2006, two different teams made their first {{appearances in the}} game, which was held in Jacksonville, Florida. Wake Forest defeated Georgia Tech, 9–6. In 2007, one team new to the championship game and championship-game veteran featured in the contest as Virginia Tech faced off against Boston College. The game resulted in a 30–16 Virginia Tech victory. The 2008 game saw a rematch of the previous year, as Virginia Tech again defeated Boston College, 30–12. In 2009, Georgia Tech defeated Clemson, 39–34, in a matchup of two <b>newcomers</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> championship game.|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} time, {{the police were}} {{managing}} the Sitting Bull incident. In 1876 the United States military led a campaign against the Sioux in Dakota; the Sioux's leader, Sitting Bull, concluded that the conflict was unwinnable, and chose to seek sanctuary in Canada. Sitting Bull arrived in May the following year and, by the summer, around 5,600 Sioux had crossed the border despite opposition from the Blackfoot. The mounted police helped to facilitate the negotiations with the Sioux, in which Assistant Commissioner Acheson Irvine played a prominent part. The Sioux declined to return south, however, and the police had to deploy around 200 men to Fort Walsh to oversee the immigrant community. The police lived in primitive conditions and voluntarily shared {{some of their own}} supplies with the Sioux, who were not covered by Treaty 7 and therefore ineligible for government support. Nonetheless, starvation gradually forced the return of most of the <b>newcomers</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> United States, and Sitting Bull himself finally surrendered in 1881.|$|E
5|$|The Millicent Ward {{repertory}} company typically staged evening {{performances of}} three-act plays; the works changed each week, and rehearsals were held during the daytime {{for the following}} week's production. Under his birth name John Halliley, Le Mesurier made his stage debut in September 1934 at the Palladium Theatre, Edinburgh in the J. B. Priestley play Dangerous Corner, along with three other <b>newcomers</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> company. The reviewer for The Scotsman thought that Le Mesurier was well cast in the role. Appearances in While Parents Sleep and Cavalcade were followed by a break, as problems arose with the lease of the theatre. Le Mesurier then accepted an offer to appear with Alec Guinness in a John Gielgud production of Hamlet, which began in Streatham {{in the spring of}} 1935 and later toured the English provinces. Le Mesurier understudied Anthony Quayle's role of Guildenstern, and otherwise appeared in the play as an extra.|$|E
5|$|Critics {{primarily}} found {{fault with}} the game's length, as {{the bulk of}} the game's content can be completed in only a few hours. Will Tuttle of GameSpy questioned whether Harmonix limited the number of songs on release knowing {{that there would be a}} market for the game's downloadable content in the near future. The low number of songs, along with the new themed instrument controllers, were found to make the game an expensive proposition for those new to rhythm games. Due to the limited selection of songs on the disc, some critics questioned the specific inclusion of certain songs or the exclusion of more popular songs. Furthermore, critics claimed that the game's complete dedication to the Beatles, without the option for cross-compatibility with Rock Band or vice versa, can potentially lead to tedious play sessions with minimal variety, hampering the social nature of the game. Justin Haywald of 1UP.com considered that in attaching the Rock Band name to the game's title, there was a certain expectation on an expandable library of songs and interoperability with previous Rock Band titles, which The Beatles: Rock Band failed to meet. Some players coming from previous versions of Rock Band would consider the songs in The Beatles: Rock Band to lack technical challenge. However, the less difficult note tracks were seen to be a welcoming benefit for <b>newcomers</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> series as well as those attempting to sing along with the harmony portions of the game. For purist fans, some critics noted that the game purposely avoids certain aspects of the Beatles' history; former band members such as Pete Best or collaborators such as Billy Preston or Eric Clapton are never seen during gameplay. Concerning supplemental content, Hilary Goldstein of IGN felt the extra features could have been more substantial, especially in comparison to the additional material that accompanies the remastered CDs.|$|E
50|$|Although Piotrowski held an {{impressive}} win over Rick Roufus, {{he was considered}} a relative <b>newcomer</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sport and an underdog against Wilson, who had defeated fighters such as Dennis Alexio, Branko Cikatić and Maurice Smith.|$|R

25|$|Polygon Michael McWhertor also {{awarded the}} game 9/10, {{similarly}} praising the game mechanics, but directing criticism at the convoluted storyline which it felt hinged on a detailed {{knowledge of the}} series' mythos {{to the point where}} it would be inaccessible to <b>newcomers</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> franchise.|$|E

Sri Lanka, meanwhile, went through to the second stage unbeaten, after <b>newcomers</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> team Upul Tharanga and Chamara Silva both struck half-centuries and Murali took three wickets, including wicket-keeper MS Dhoni for a duck.|$|E
25|$|The {{limited access}} to housing provokes strong local politics. It is often assumed that tourism {{is to blame for}} this, {{attracting}} <b>newcomers</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> area who can afford to outbid locals for available housing. Many buildings are used for tourist accommodation which reduces the number available for local residents. Second homes are also thought to account for a significant proportion of the housing stock, leaving many buildings empty for much of the year.|$|E

25|$|After the war ended, {{the church}} went into decline. Older members died and {{were buried in}} the cemetery; younger ones left the area. They were not so easily replaced. Somers' early {{economic}} advantages had been offset when the railroads, which had begun extending themselves into Westchester during the 1840s, grew out having bypassed the town, and <b>newcomers</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> region settled where the tracks were. The planned new church was never built.|$|E
25|$|The village {{underwent}} {{housing development}} during the 1960s and early 1970s {{and now has}} about 4,000 inhabitants (almost double that of nearby Great Missenden).

25|$|POWs {{operated}} a system whereby <b>newcomers</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> camp were vetted, to prevent German agents from infiltrating their ranks.

Several infiltrators were discovered by this method and none is known to have escaped detection in Luft III.|$|E
