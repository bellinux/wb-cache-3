Coupled with this, a growing population and increasing trends in consumer demand have resulted in national waste loads increasing. A possible solution to both issues is energy-from-waste (EfW) technologies. Many studies have focused on municipal solid waste (MSW) as a potential feedstock, but appear to overlook the potential benefits of commercial and industrial waste (C&IW). In this study, samples of C&IW were collected from three North West waste management companies and Lancaster University campus. The samples were tested for their gross and <b>net</b> <b>calorific</b> value, moisture content, ash content, volatile matter, and also elemental composition to determine their suitability in EfW systems. Intra-sample analysis showed there to be little variation between samples with the exception two samples, from waste management site 3, which showed extensive variation with regards to <b>net</b> <b>calorific</b> value, ash content, and elemental analysis. Comparisons with known fuel types revealed similarities between the sampled C&IW, MSW, and refuse derived fuel (RDF) thereby justifying its potential for use in EfW systems.

Fifty-two facilities were surveyed to gather statistics on rates of fibre use for energy, thermal and electrical energy capacity and net production. We estimated that from 2000 to 2011, on average 9. 4  Mt of wood fibre (oven-dry) was used annually to produce energy, which was {{about one-third of the}} total harvested biomass. However, bioenergy does not drive the harvest. Bioenergy uses residual fibre from other operations—primarily black liquor from pulp mills.

40|$|Za izračunavanje emisije ugljikova dioksida zbog izgaranja ugljena, emisijski faktor CO 2 važan je ulazni parametar. Referentni emisijski faktori prema Uputama Međuvladinog tijela za klimatske promjene iz 2006. godine (engl. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC) specificirani su prema stupnju pougljenja (coal rank), ali se pri izradi nacionalnog izvješća o stakleničkim plinovima preporučuje primjena nacionalnih emisijskih faktora. Sadržaj ugljika najvažnije je svojstvo ugljena i pokazatelj je stupnja pougljenja (karbonizacije). Međutim mnoga svojstva ugljena vrlo su specifična (npr. sadržaj sumpora, pepela, vlage i macerala) te emisijski faktori CO 2 ugljena ne ovise samo o stupnju pougljenja već i o njegovu geografskom porijeklu. U preliminarnom istraživanju, temeljem podataka dobivenih analizom goriva, izračunati su emisijski faktori CO 2 za ugljene i treset s područja Livna, BiH: 147, 9 t TJ− 1 za treset, 109, 5 t TJ− 1 za lignit i 98, 7 t TJ− 1 za smeđi ugljen, što odgovara sljedećim donjim ogrjevnim vrijednostima (Hd) : 3, 6 MJ kg− 1, 11, 5 MJ kg− 1 i 20, 6 MJ kg− 1. Razlika u ogrjevnoj vrijednosti može se djelomično objasniti različitim udjelom ukupne vlage u ispitivanim uzorcima. Usporedba izračunatih emisijskih faktora s referentnim vrijednostima, pokazala je najveća odstupanja kod treseta (39, 5 %), potom kod lignita (8, 2 %) i smeđeg ugljena (4, 3 %). Emission {{factors are}} used in {{greenhouse}} gas inventories to estimate emissions from coal combustion. In the absence of direct measures, emissions factors are frequently used as a quick, low cost way to estimate emissions values. Coal combustion {{has been a major}} contributor to the CO 2 flux into the atmosphere. Nearly all of the fuel carbon (99 %) in coal is converted to CO 2 during the combustion process. The carbon content is the most important coal parameter which is the measure of the degree of coalification (coal rank). Coalification is the alteration of vegetation to form peat, succeeded by the transformation of peat through lignite, sub-bituminous, bituminous to anthracite coal. During the geochemical or metamorphic stage, the progressive changes that occur within the coal are an increase in the carbon content and a decrease in the hydrogen and oxygen content resulting in a loss of volatiles. Heterogeneous composition of coal causes variation in CO 2 emission from different coals. The IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) has produced guidelines on how to produce emission inventories which includes emission factors. Although 2006 IPCC Guidelines provided the default values specified according to the rank of the coal, the application of country-specific emission factors was recommended when estimating the national greenhouse gas emissions. This paper discusses the differences between country-specific emission factors and default IPCC CO 2 emission factors, EF(CO 2), for coals. Also, this study estimated EF(CO 2) for two different types of coals and peat from B&H, on the basis fuel analyses. Carbon emission factors for coal mainly depend on the carbon content of the fuel and vary with both rank and geographic origin, which supports the idea of provincial variation of carbon emission factors. Also, various other factors, such as content of sulphur, minerals and macerals play an important role and influence EF(CO 2) from coal. Carbonate minerals (calcite and siderite) directly contribute CO 2 when they decompose during coal combustion. Variations in the maceral content can also influence CO 2 emissions; high inertinite contents increase CO 2 emissions. Sulphur in coal reduces EF(CO 2). Fuel analysis is very important when estimating greenhouse gas emissions and emission factors. In this preliminary study, {{based on the results of}} the fuel analysis, CO 2 emission factors for coals and peat from Livno, B&H have been calculated. EF(CO 2) is defined as the amount of carbon dioxide emission per unit <b>net</b> <b>calorific</b> values of the fuel. <b>Net</b> <b>calorific</b> value (the lower heating value) corresponds to the heat produced by combustion where total water in the combustion products exists as water vapour. The EF(CO 2) obtained for sub-bituminous coal, lignite and peat were: 98. 7, 109. 5, and 147. 9 t TJ− 1, respectively, which correspond to the following <b>net</b> <b>calorific</b> values: 20. 6, 11. 5 and 3. 6 MJ kg− 1. The heating value is generally known to increase with the increase in carbon content (this parameter is connected with the degree of coalification, coal age). The other indispensable parameters are hydrogen, which has a positive effect on the <b>net</b> <b>calorific</b> value, and oxygen and water which impact the <b>net</b> <b>calorific</b> value negatively. The differences in <b>net</b> <b>calorific</b> values can be explained in part by the difference of total moisture content among the different fuel types.

The calorific deficit is thought to lead to utilization of energy stored i...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is the conversion of different types of biomass into solid composite fuel. The subject of research is the heat conversion of biomass into solid composite fuel. The research object is the biomass of the Tomsk region (Russia) : peat, waste wood, lake sapropel. Physical experiment of biomass conversion is used as method of research. The new experimental unit for thermal conversion of biomass into carbon residue, fuel gas and pyrolysis condensate is described. As a result of research such parameters are obtained: thermotechnical biomass characteristics, material balances and product characteristics of the heat-technology conversion. Different methods of obtaining solid composite fuel from the products of thermal technologies are considered. As a result, it is established: heat-technology provides efficient conversion of the wood chips and peat; conversion of the lake sapropel is inefficient since the solid composite fuel has the high ash content and <b>net</b> <b>calorific</b> value...|$|R
