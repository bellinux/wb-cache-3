Obstruction of NCR transport in the dnf 1 - 1 signal peptidase mutant correlated with the absence of terminal bacterial differentiation. On the contrary, ectopic expression of NCRs in legumes devoid of NCRs or challenge of cultured rhizobia with peptides provoked symptoms of terminal differentiation.

The former pathway is altogether inoperative in Rhizobium 32 H 1; the latter pathway operates at a slow rate and is under strict negative control by ammonium itself. Rhizobium 32 H 1 glutamine synthetase activity is modulated by both repression-derepression and reversible adenylylation.

We determined whether developmental control of the Medicago truncatula nodule meristem bears resemblance to that in root meristems through analyses of root meristem-expressed PLETHORA genes. In nodules, MtPLETHORA 1 and 2 are preferentially expressed in cells positioned at {{the periphery of the}} meristem abutting nodule vascular bundles.

Nodule-specific knockdown of MtPLETHORA genes results in a reduced number of nodules and/or in nodules in which meristem activity has ceased. Our nodule gene expression map indicates that the nodule meristem is composed of two distinct domains in which different MtPLETHORA gene subsets are expressed.

Sampling occurred in the protected natural park of the Asinara island. Roots and stems of the two plants and the root nodules of A. terraccianoi were surface sterilized in order to remove external and rhizospheric microbiota and to subsequently isolate the culturable bacterial communities. Plate counts revealed densities of endophytes between 3. 7 × 102 and 2. 8 × 104 colony forming units per gram of fresh weight. 16 S rDNA sequencing revealed the occurrence of bacteria displaying high similarity with Actinobacterium sp., Paenibacillus sp., Rhizobium sp., Methylobacterium sp., Pedobacter panaciterrae, Aerococcus viridans, Stenotrophomonas rhizophila, Bacillus sporothermodurans, Bacillus pumilus, Bacillus simplex, Bacillus flexus, Streptomyces ciscaucasicus and Dyella sp.

In order to avoid these issues, we adopted the soybean root hair cell, derived from a single, differentiated root epidermal cell, as a single-cell model for functional genomics.

A 180 -kDa MAC 265 -HRGP dominated in pea shoot plasma membranes, while almost no MAC 265 -HRGP was detected in root plasma membranes. We show here that a major difference between the plant-derived peribacteroid membrane of the symbiosomes and the root plasma membrane was {{the presence of a}} 100 -kDa MAC 265 -HRGP in the former. Arabinogalactan proteins (AGPs), as recognized by the monoclonal antibodies MAC 207 and JIM 8, were not detected in the peribacteroid membrane, while two isoforms (100 and 220 kDa) were detected in shoot and root plasma membranes. Specific MAC 265 -HRGP isoforms were found in the peribacteroid space fraction of the symbiosomes and thus as soluble proteins in the interface between the symbionts. The abundance of the MAC 265 -epitope was much reduced in non-nitrogen-fixing nodules when this phenotype resulted from a dicarboxylate transport mutation in Rhizobium. There was no reduction in the abundance of the MAC 265 -epitope in non-fixing phenotypes resulting from a mutation in the plant. The results suggest that bacterial signals related to the bacterial ability to fix nitrogen, might be responsible for the regulation of HRGP expression in root nodules...|$|E

In this study, we analyzed the AMF community composition in the roots of three nonlegumes and in the roots and root nodules of three legumes growing in a natural dune grassland. We amplified {{a portion of the}} small-subunit ribosomal DNA and analyzed it by using restriction fragment length polymorphism and direct sequencing. We found differences in AMF communities between legumes and nonlegumes and between legume roots and root nodules. Different plant species also contained different AMF communities, with different AMF diversity. One AMF sequence type was much more abundant in legumes than in nonlegumes (39 and 13 %, respectively). Root nodules contained characteristic AMF communities that were different from those in legume roots, even though the communities were similar in nodules from different legume species. One AMF sequence type was found almost exclusively in root nodules. Legumes and root nodules have relatively high nitrogen concentrations and high phosphorus demands. Accordingly, the presence of legume- and nodule-related AMF {{can be explained by the}} specific nutritional requirements of legumes or by host-specific interactions among legumes, root nodules, and AMF.

In this study, we characterize the microbial community present in different regions of the alimentary tract of P. nigrolineatus fed a mixed diet of date palm and palm wood in laboratory aquaria. Analysis was performed on 16 S rRNA gene clone libraries derived from anterior and posterior regions of the alimentary tract and the auxiliary lobe (AL), an uncharacterized organ that is vascularly attached to the midgut. Sequence analysis and phylogenetic reconstruction revealed distinct microbial communities in each tissue region. The foregut community shared many phylotypes in common with aquarium tank water and included Legionella and Hyphomicrobium spp. As the analysis moved further into the gastrointestinal tract, phylotypes with high levels of 16 S rRNA sequence similarity to <b>nitrogen-fixing</b> <b>Rhizobium</b> and Agrobacterium spp. and Clostridium xylanovorans and Clostridium saccharolyticum, dominated midgut and AL communities.

Most cultivated soils contain large populations of such micro-organisms. A diversity of interactions occur between rhizobia and PGPR with leguminous plants in natural conditions, however, their associations and functions in field crops such as faba bean is less studied. In Sweden, faba bean cultivation is increasing because of increasing demand for self-sufficiency of native protein feed. Two {{of the most serious}} diseases to limit the yield of faba beans are chocolate spot disease and Ascochyta blight. This thesis contains several studies. One study was done on the microbial communities naturally associated with faba bean seeds of two different cultivars. In another study, the role of selected bacteria for health of faba bean was examined. Furthermore, the antagonistic ability of Rhizobium and PGPR towards faba bean pathogens, and the compatibility and root colonization competence of the two beneficial bacteria was investigated. Cultivation-dependent and cultivation-independent approaches used to study the seed microbial community structure revealed high diversity, which seemed to be affected by the health status of the seeds. Enterobacteriaceae dominated the bacterial flora and Serratia, Pseudomonas and Burkholderia were among the numerous genera that inhabited the seeds. Higher bacterial growth in cv. Aurora seed exudates compared to cv. Fuego suggested differences in the chemical composition between the two varieties. Both rhizobial and PGPR isolates were shown to be antagonistic but PGPR proved to be stronger antagonists than rhizobia. Serratia proteamaculans S 4 was strongest antagonist and produced both diffusible and volatilic antifungal metabolites. In greenhouse, rhizobia and PGPR colonised roots of both cultivars after single or co- inoculation but the level of colonisation differed depending on the cultivar and the isolate combination. Colonisation by Rhizobium leguminosarum was stimulated by fluorescent Pseudomonas sp. Positive effects of seed bacterisation with Rhizobium in greenhouse were evident in terms of emergence and plant growth in both Aurora and Fuego.

However, cowpea suffers from a wide range of production constraints such as viral diseases. Cowpea aphid-borne mosaic potyvirus (CABMV) is one of the most important viral pathogens of cowpea in major cowpea growing regions of the world and significantly reduces cowpea yields of resource poor farmers. In an effort to characterise a CABMV isolate from Zimbabwe, designated CABMV-Z 3, using classical virology techniques the host range of CAMBV-Z 3 was tested. The symptoms produced on susceptible Nicotiana bethamiana, N. clevelandii, Vigna unguiculata, Chenopodium amaranticolor and Ch. quinoa plants were described. Nicotiana glutinosa, N. tabacum, N. rustica, Phaseolus vulgaris and Cucumeris sativus were shown to be non-hosts of the virus. The CABMV-Z 3 was purified for the first time and polyclonal antiserum was produced against the virus. Full-length cDNA clones of CABMV-Z 3 were made by long-range reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Another aspect of the study was to determine the most effective virus resistance mechanism using the CABMV-Z 3 coat protein (CP) gene, in tobacco as a model host since no reliable cowpea transformation protocol was available at the time. The 1. 2 kb 3 â€™ terminal region of CABMV-Z 3 was amplified using RT-PCR technique and cloned into a PCR cloning vector pGEM-T, and named pGEM-CPRep. This clone was used as template in a PCR to amplify a CP gene optimised for expression in plants (CPk), an untranslatable CP gene with stop codons in all three reading frames (CPstop), an anti-sense CP (PC), and the central region of the CP gene (CPcore). All four amplification products were provided with promoters and terminators from expression cassette vector pCa 2 Nos, and ligated into the unique Hind III site of the binary plasmid pBI 121, to result in plasmids pBI 121 -CPk, pBI 121 -CPstop, pBI 121 -PC and pBI 121 -CPcore. The constructs were used in Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of Nicotiana benthamiana leaf sections following the co-cultivation method. Regenerated plants were analyzed by PCR and Southern hybidization. R 1 seedlings were assayed for kanamycin resistance and for presence of CP, and challenged with CAMBV-infected sap. Lines showing delayed symptom development, tolerance and recovery were identified but no line showing immunity was identified. This was significant resistance, since it affords protection to the plants during the crucial early stages of development and exerts little evolutionary pressure on the virus to evolve new strategies. The ultimate goal of the project was to produce cowpea lines that are resistant to CABMV. However, there was no efficient, reliable and reproducible cowpea transformation and regeneration system. A cowpea transformation protocol was developed and evaluated, utilizing the binary constructs specified above. The binary constructs were electrophoresed into the apical meristems of developing cowpea seedlings under various conditions including different voltage and current settings as well as pretreatment of seedlings with acid or plant growth regulators. Preliminary screening was done using GUS assays, PCR and Southern analysis, and the plants allowed to set seed. The T 1 seeds were germinated in-vitro on MS plates. The results show that DNA delivery to meristematic cells was successful, leading to transgenic sectors of the plants. However, the chimeric nature of the plants poses a problem, as there is need for a reliable non-destructive mechanism to track the transgenic branches of the chimeras. This transformation method has the potential to avert some of the concerns often raised against transgenic plants since it does not necessarily require selectable marker and reporter genes, and avoids the expensive and laborious tissue culture step...|$|E

The enzyme is inactivated by low ionic strength and low temperature. On SDS/PAGE under reducing conditions, purified 3 -oxoacyl-ACP reductase migrated as a single polypeptide giving a molecular mass of 28 kDa.

We report that it can survive carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus starvation for at least 2 months with little loss of viability. Upon carbon starvation, R. leguminosarum cells were found to undergo reductive cell division. During this period, they acquired the potential for long-term starvation-survival, levels of protein, DNA, and RNA synthesis were decreased to base levels, and pool mRNA was stabilized. The starved cells are ready to rapidly restart growth when nutrients become available. Upon addition of fresh nutrients, there is an immediate increase in the levels of macromolecular synthesis, pool mRNA destabilizes, and the cultures enter exponential growth within 5 to 8 h. The starved cells were cross-protected against pH, heat, osmotic, and oxidative shock. These results provide evidence for a general starvation response in R. leguminosarum similar to that previously found in other bacteria such as Escherichia coli and Vibrio sp.

40|$|ABSTRACT Studies of the {{taxonomy}} of bacteria were initiated {{in the last}} quarter of the 19 th century when bacteria were classified in six genera placed in four tribes based on their morphological appearance. Since then {{the taxonomy}} of bacteria has been revolutionized several times. At present, 30 phyla belong to the domain Bacteria, which includes over 9600 species. Unlike many eukaryotes, bacteria lack complex morphological characters and practically phylogenetically informative fossils. It is partly due to these reasons that bacterial taxonomy is complicated. Due to the improvement of methods to obtain sequence level characters plus new methods for their analyses, the taxonomy of bacteria has also been improved. However, there is still no official classification of prokaryotes. Biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) is a process in which bacteria reduce inert nitrogen gas to biologically useful ammonia. The symbiotic interaction between rhizobia and legumes (Fabaceae or Leguminosae) is important both in natural systems and in agriculture. Rhizobia is a general name for a group of bacteria that can enter symbiosis with legumes. Until 1982, all these were classified into one single bacterial genus, Rhizobium. The number of rhizobial genera increased to 17 by the year 2011, from which five genera, Rhizobium, Allorhizobium, Agrobacterium, Ensifer (syn. Sinorhizobium), and Shinella were accommodated in the family Rhizobiaceae. The genus Agrobacterium, a group of mostly pathogenic bacteria, was placed among the beneficial nitrogen-fixing bacteria (rhizobia) in the family Rhizobiaceae. That resulted in several taxonomic issues regarding the family Rhizobiaceae. The main nomenclatural issue regarding the genus Agrobacterium resulted from transferring this genus to the genus Rhizobium. Moreover, the phylogenetic position of the former <b>nitrogen-fixing</b> <b>Rhizobium</b> galegae complex was not clear. This group of bacteria was in previous studies clustered with either Agrobacterium or Rhizobium or placed in a lineage separately from other genera of the family Rhizobiaceae. During the last decade, the number of the rhizobial species increased dramatically, especially in the genus Rhizobium. However, Rhizobium is an inappropriate genus name for some of the species assigned to the genus. To resolve some of the major taxonomic uncertainties of the family Rhizobiaceae, two separate multilocus sequencing analyses (MLSA) were performed. In the first study, an MLSA of 114 rhizobial strains was performed by using six housekeeping genes (atpD, glnA, glnII, recA, rpoB, and thrC). The first MLSA study was focusing on the phylogeny of the taxa belonging to the former Rhizobium galegae complex and the genus Agrobacterium. In the second MLSA, a total of 100 strains representing 81 species of the family Rhizobiaceae were studied using four housekeeping genes namely 16 S rRNA, atpD, recA, and rpoB. Based on these results, we proposed delineation of two new genera, Neorhizobium gen. nov. and Pararhizobium gen. nov., and 16 new species combinations, Neorhizobium galegae comb. nov., Neorhizobium huautlense comb. nov., Neorhizobium alkalisoli comb. nov., Agrobacterium nepotum comb. nov., Agrobacterium pusense comb. nov., Agrobacterium skierniewicense comb. nov., Allorhizobium vitis comb. nov., Allorhizobium taibaishanense comb. nov., Allorhizobium paknamense comb. nov., Allorhizobium oryzae comb. nov., Allorhizobium pseudoryzae comb. nov., Allorhizobium borbori comb. nov., Pararhizobium giardinii comb. nov., Pararhizobium capsulatum comb. nov., Pararhizobium herbae comb. nov., and Pararhizobium sphaerophysae comb. nov. (Paper I and II). A total of 159 bacterial strains were isolated from the nodules of the Chinese specimens of the plant genus Glycyrrhiza L. The results of the study showed that 29 true symbiotic strains belong to the genus Mesorhizobium. To estimate the phylogenetic position of the 29 isolates an MLSA was performed for 59 mesorhizobial strains by using three housekeeping genes 16 S rRNA, recA, and rpoB. Moreover, the phylogeny of three symbiotic genes (nodA, nodC, and nifH) of these 59 mesorhizobial strains was investigated. The results of MLSA showed that 21 test strains belong to the species M. tianshanense, M. gobiense, M. temperatum, M. muleiense, M. amorphae, M. alhagi, and M. camelthorni, whereas eight test strains might belong to a novel species of Mesorhizobium. The results of the analyses of accessory genes in this study showed that the mesorhizobial strains isolated from the plant genus Glycyrrhiza have probably acquired some genetic material from other rhizobia co-evolving with Glycyrrhiza and other legumes (Paper III). ...|$|E
40|$|Endosymbiotic {{interactions}} form a fundament {{of life as}} we know it and {{are characterized}} by the formation of new specialized membrane compartments, in which the microbes are hosted inside living plant cells. A striking example is the symbiosis between legumes and <b>nitrogen-fixing</b> <b>Rhizobium</b> bacteria (rhizobia), which represents the most important source of biologically fixed nitrogen. The accommodation of rhizobia as novel nitrogen-fixing organelles, called symbiosomes, inside the cells of a novel organ, the root nodule, forms the heart of this ecologically and agriculturally important symbiosis. Understanding how these organelles are made will be keystone to exploit this symbiosis for sustainable agriculture in the future. In this thesis, we undertook a genetic approach to identity key components that control symbiosome formation especially in the genetically well-characterized garden pea (Pisum sativum) system. At the start of this thesis, the most extensive and morphologically best-characterized collection of mutants impaired in symbiosome formation was, and currently still is, available in pea. However, the cloning of the corresponding genes is severely hampered by its large genome size and recalcitrance to genetic transformation. Therefore, we used the model legume Medicago truncatula (Medicago) as reference genome to clone pea symbiosome mutants via a synteny-based cloning approach. We focused especially on three mutants in pea, named sym 33, sym 41 and sym 31, which are affected most early in symbiosome formation: namely blocked in the release of bacteria from cell wall bound infection threads inside root nodule cells (sym 33 and sym 41) or induction of the subsequent differentiation of the symbiosomes (sym 31). In Chapter 1, a general introduction is given on the process of symbiosome formation in legume root nodules. In this introduction, we focus on mechanisms by which these new nitrogen-fixing organelles are formed and address some of the recent insights, most of which were obtained after the start of this thesis, into plant components that control this process, which have been obtained from genetic studies in pea and the model legumes Medicago and Lotus japonicus (Lotus). Pea is part of the Papillionoid legume subfamily and closely related to the model legume Medicago. It has been shown that there is extensive synteny between the pea and Medicago genomes, which offers an efficient strategy to clone pea gene using Medicago as intergenomic cloning vehicle. In Chapter 2, we outline this synteny-based cloning approach and the molecular tools that we created to clone the pea genes required for symbiosome formation. In addition, we describe an efficient method to obtain transgenic roots via Agrobacterium rhizogenes mediated root transformation in pea that facilitates the functional analysis of pea genes in root endosymbioses. In Chapter 3, we report the cloning of the pea Sym 33 and Medicago SYM 1 genes those mutants are most strongly impaired in their ability to form symbiosomes, i. e. the release of rhizobia from the cell wall bound infection threads. Both pea Sym 33 and Medicago SYM 1 encode the interacting protein of DMI 3, IPD 3. IPD 3 was shown to interact with DMI 3 /CCaMK, a calcium- and calmodulin-dependent kinase that is an essential component of the common symbiotic signalling pathway for both rhizobial symbiosis and arbuscular mycorrhiza. Our data reveal a novel, key role for IPD 3 in symbiosome formation and development. Further, we show that MtIPD 3 is required for the expression of a nodule-specific remorin MtSYMREM 1, which is required for proper infection thread growth and essential for symbiosome formation. In Chapter 4, we report the synteny-based cloning of the pea sym 41 mutant that is also impaired in the release of the bacteria from the infection threads. We show that Sym 41 represents a weak allele of the common symbiotic signalling gene PsSym 19 /MtDMI 2, a leucine-rich repeat domain containing receptor kinase that is essential for both rhizobial and mycorrhizal endosymbioses. Sym 41 contains a splice-site mutation in intron 9, by which the formation of a functional transcript is reduced by ~ 90 %. The implication of Sym 19 /DMI 2 together with the identified role of Sym 33 /IPD 3 in symbiosome formation (Chapter 3) strongly indicate that rhizobia have co-opted the signalling pathway from the ancient arbuscular mycorrhiza to be hosted as new organelles inside root nodule cells. In Chapter 5, we describe the synteny-based mapping of pea sym 31, a mutant impaired in symbiosome differentiation. By making use of the synteny with Medicago, we fine mapped the Sym 31 gene to a region of ~ 2. 5 cM, which corresponds to a < 450 kb region in Medicago. In this syntenic region, one gene MtN 3. 1, a putative sugar transporter stands out as prime candidate to control symbiosome differentiation. We describe and discuss our efforts to determine the role of this gene in symbiosome differentiation in pea and Medicago. In Chapter 6, we summarize and discuss our current insight into symbiosome formation and its relation to the arbuscular mycorrhiza and we give a perspective on the future of cloning the pea genes required for endosymbioses.  ...|$|E
40|$|Nitrogen is a {{key element}} for plant growth. To meet {{nitrogen}} demands, some plants establish an endosymbiotic relationship with <b>nitrogen-fixing</b> <b>rhizobium</b> or Frankia bacteria. This involves formation of specialized root lateral organs, named nodules. These nodules are colonized intracellularly, which creates optimal physiological conditions for the fixation of atmospheric nitrogen by the microbial symbiont. Nitrogen-fixing endosymbioses are found among four related taxonomic orders that together form the nitrogen-fixation clade. Within this clade, nodulation is restricted to ten separate lineages that are scattered among mostly non-nodulating plant species. This limited distribution suggests that genetic adaptations that allowed nodulation to evolve occurred in a common ancestor. A major aim of the scientific community is to unravel the evolutionary trajectory towards a nitrogen-fixing nodule symbiosis. The formation of nitrogen-fixing root nodules is best studied in legumes (Fabaceae, order Fabales); especially in Lotus japonicus and Medicago truncatula, two species that serve as model. Legumes and Parasponia (Cannabaceae, order Rosales) represent the only two lineages that can form nodules with rhizobium bacteria. Studies on M. truncatula, L. japonicus and Parasponia showed, amongst others, that nodule formation is initiated upon perception of rhizobial secreted lipo-chitooligosaccharide (LCO) signals. These signals are structurally related to the symbiotic signals produced by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. These obligate biotropic fungi colonize roots of most land plants and form dense hyphal structures inside existing root cortical cells. Rhizobial and mycorrhizal LCOs are perceived by LysM-domain-containing receptor-like kinases. These activate a signaling pathway that is largely shared between both symbioses. Symbiotic LCO receptors are closely related to chitin innate immune receptors, and some receptors even function in symbiotic as well as innate immune signaling. In Chapter 2, I review the intertwining of symbiotic LCO perception and chitin-triggered immunity. Furthermore, I discuss how rhizobia and mycorrhiza might employ LCO signaling to modulate plant immunity. In a perspective, I speculate on a role for plant hormones in immune modulation, besides an important function in nodule organogenesis. In legumes, nodule organogenesis requires activation of cytokinin signaling. Mutants in the orthologous cytokinin receptor genes MtCRE 1 and LjLHK 1 in M. truncatula and L. japonicus, respectively, are severely affected in nodule formation. However, how cytokinin signaling is activated in response to rhizobium LCO perception and to what extent this contributes to rhizobium LCO-induced signaling remained elusive. In Chapter 3, I show that the majority of transcriptional changes induced in wild-type M. truncatula, upon application of rhizobium LCOs, are dependent on activation of MtCRE 1 -mediated cytokinin signaling. Among the genes induced in wild type are several involved in cytokinin biosynthesis. Consistently, cytokinin measurements indicate that cytokinins rapidly accumulate in M. truncatula roots upon treatment with rhizobium LCOs. This includes the bioactive cytokinins isopentenyl adenine and trans-zeatin. Therefore, I argue that cytokinin accumulation represents a key step in the pathway leading to legume root nodule organogenesis. Strigolactones are plant hormones of which biosynthesis is increased in response to nutrient limitation. In rice (Oryza sativa) and M. truncatula, this response requires the GRAS-type transcriptional regulators NSP 1 and NSP 2. Both proteins regulate expression of DWARF 27 (D 27), which encodes an enzyme that performs the first committed step in strigolactone biosynthesis. NSP 1 and NSP 2 are also essential components of the signaling cascade that controls legume root nodule formation. In line with this, I questioned whether the NSP 1 -NSP 2 -D 27 regulatory module functions in rhizobium symbiosis. In Chapter 4, I show that in M. truncatula MtD 27 expression is induced within hours after treatment with rhizobium LCOs. Spatiotemporal expression studies revealed that MtD 27 is expressed in the dividing cells of the nodule primordium. At later stages, its expression becomes confined to the meristem and distal infection zone of the mature nodule. Analysis of the expression pattern of MtCCD 7 and MtCCD 8, two additional strigolactone biosynthesis genes, showed that these genes are co-expressed with MtD 27 in nodule primordia and mature nodules. Additionally, I show that symbiotic expression of MtD 27 requires MtNSP 1 and MtNSP 2. This suggests that the NSP 1 -NSP 2 -D 27 regulatory module is co-opted in rhizobium symbiosis. Comparative studies between legumes and nodulating non-legumes could identify shared genetic networks required for nodule formation. We recently adopted Parasponia, the only non-legume lineage able to engage in rhizobium symbiosis. However, to perform functional studies, powerful reverse genetic tools for Parasponia are essential. In Chapter 5, I describe the development of a fast and efficient protocol for CRISPR/Cas 9 -mediated mutagenesis in Agrobacterium tumefaciens-transformed Parasponia andersonii plants. Using this protocol, stable mutants can be obtained in a period of three months. These mutants can be effectively propagated in vitro, which allows phenotypic evaluation already in the T 0 generation. As such, phenotypes can be obtained within six months after transformation. As proof-of-principle, we mutated PanHK 4, PanEIN 2, PanNSP 1 and PanNSP 2. These genes are putatively involved in cytokinin and ethylene signaling and regulation of strigolactone biosynthesis, respectively. Additionally, orthologues of these genes perform essential symbiotic functions in legumes. Panhk 4 and Panein 2 knockout mutants display developmental phenotypes associated with reduced cytokinin and ethylene signaling. Analysis of Pannsp 1 and Pannsp 2 mutants revealed a conserved role for NSP 1 and NSP 2 in regulation of the strigolactone biosynthesis genes D 27 and MAX 1 and root nodule organogenesis. In contrast, symbiotic mutant phenotypes of Panhk 4 and Panein 2 mutants are different from their legume counterparts. This illustrates the value of Parasponia as comparative model - besides legumes - to study the genetics underlying rhizobium symbiosis. Phylogenetic reconstruction showed that the Parasponia lineage is embedded in the non-nodulating Trema genus. This close relationship suggests that Parasponia and Trema only recently diverged in nodulation ability. In Chapter 6, I exploited this close relationship to question whether the nodulation trait is associated with gene expression differentiation. To this end, I sequenced root transcriptomes of two Parasponia and three Trema species. Principal component analysis separated all Parasponia samples from those of Trema along the first principal component. This component explains {{more than half of the}} observed variance, indicating that the root transcriptomes of two Parasponia species are distinct from that of the Trema sister species T. levigata, as well as the outgroup species T. orientalis and T. tomentosa. To determine, whether the transcriptional differences between Parasponia and Trema are relevant in a symbiotic context, I compared the list of differentially expressed genes to a list of genes that show nodule-enhanced expression in P. andersonii. This revealed significant enrichment of nodule-enhanced genes among genes that lower expressed in roots of Parasponia compared to Trema. Among the genes differentially expressed between Parasponia and Trema roots are several involved in mycorrhizal symbiosis as well as jasmonic acid biosynthesis. Measurements of hormone concentrations, showed that Parasponia and Trema roots harbor a difference in jasmonic acid/salicylic acid balance. However, mutants in jasmonic acid biosynthesis are unaffected in nodule development. Therefore, it remains a challenge to determine whether the difference in root transcriptomes between Parasponia and Trema are relevant in a symbiotic context. In Chapter 7, I review hormone function in nitrogen-fixing nodule symbioses in legumes, Parasponia and actinorhizal species. In this chapter, I question whether different nodulating lineages recruited the same hormonal networks to function in nodule formation. Additionally, I discuss whether nodulating species harbor genetic adaptations in hormonal pathways that correlate with nodulation capacity...|$|E
