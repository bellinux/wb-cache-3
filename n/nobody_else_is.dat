Scorpio intends to have Bont killed with a laser, but Bont uses a coin to free himself from his {{restraints}} before attempting to flee. However, Homer, who is unaware of events, easily knocks him down, allowing Scorpio's soldiers to shoot the agent. A proud Scorpio happily thanks Homer for a job well done. At dinner, Homer proudly tells of his successes at work, but discovers that his family hates Cypress Creek and {{want to go back}} to Springfield.

Dejected, Homer decides to visit Scorpio back at Globex Headquarters. His visit coincides with an assault by the U.S. military, but Homer still remains oblivious to what is taking place.

25|$|During {{the first}} episode of series three of Ashes to Ashes, {{the nature of his}} death is raised when Alex Drake discovers a witness {{statement}} implied to have been written by Gene Hunt with various parts blacked out, accompanied by Alex seeing visions of a man with injuries to {{the left side of his}} face dressed in police tunic and greatcoat. In the second episode, DCI Jim Keats, an officer from the Discipline and Complaints department, intent on removing Gene Hunt, states he believes Gene killed Sam Tyler. In the fifth episode, Gene destroys Tyler's clothes (which Alex had requested from Manchester) and the censored file in order to prevent her from learning the truth about his death. In the following episode, a suspect who is not only a known fantasist but appears very different physically from Sam tries to convince Alex that he is Sam Tyler after undergoing extensive plastic surgery, and that he is from the future. He quotes Sam's usual speech in the Life on Mars introductions, claiming that <b>nobody</b> <b>else</b> <b>is</b> real, although he still seems to be pleased when he, Gene and Alex are in the same room, calling them the 'Three Musketeers', and avoiding Alex's attempts to test him for future knowledge by claiming that such details are forgotten after too long in the past. Gene tells Alex that he helped Sam fake his own death, meaning Sam was still alive but had disappeared into thin air.|$|E

[...] She also appeared in a music video by Marcy Playground for the film's soundtrack and starred with Matthew Broderick in Election {{which is based on}} Tom Perrotta's novel. For her portrayal of Tracy Flick, she received vast critical acclaim and won the Best Actress Award from the National Society of Film Critics and the Online Film Critics Society, a first Golden Globe nomination and an Independent Spirit Award nomination. Witherspoon also received a rank on the list of 100 Greatest Film Performances of All Time by Premiere. Director Alexander Payne said of her, [...] "She's got that quality that men find attractive, while women would like to be her friend. But that's just the foundation. <b>Nobody</b> <b>else</b> <b>is</b> as funny or brings such charm to things. She can do anything." ...|$|E

500|$|Sheen worked {{predominantly}} in theatre in the 1990s and {{has since}} remarked that he will always feel [...] "slightly more at home" [...] on stage. [...] "It's more of an actor's medium. You are your own editor, <b>nobody</b> <b>else</b> <b>is</b> choosing what is being seen of you." [...] His first professional role, while still in his third and final year at RADA, was in When She Danced at the Globe Theatre in 1991. He later described the role as [...] "a big break. One day, I was at RADA doing a movement class, the next I was at a read-through with Vanessa Redgrave and Frances de la Tour." [...] Milton Shulman of the Evening Standard praised an [...] "excellent" [...] performance while The Observer wrote of [...] "a notable West End debut". In 1992, Sheen's performance in Romeo and Juliet at the Royal Exchange received a MEN Theatre Award nomination and led theatre critic Michael Coveney to declare him [...] "the most exciting young actor of his generation ... a volatile, electrifying and technically fearless performer". His 1993 turn as Perdican in Alfred de Musset's Don't Fool With Love at the Donmar Warehouse was nominated for the Ian Charleson Award. and was described by The Independent as [...] "quite thrilling". Also in 1993, Sheen appeared in {{the world premiere of}} Harold Pinter's Moonlight at the Almeida Theatre and made his television debut in the 1993 BBC mini-series Gallowglass.|$|E

As the official [...] "Cowbell Man", <b>nobody</b> <b>else</b> <b>is</b> authorized to use it, although it was agreed upon by the group that other Creatures could take over the duties when he couldn't attend. This agreement was reached due to the many fans who were disappointed that the tradition was not carried out at every game.|$|E

[...] And our great uniqueness, what surrounds American exceptionalism, what really drives it is that entrepreneurial individualistic spirit which goes out and takes a risk when <b>nobody</b> <b>else</b> <b>is</b> willing to do it or comes up with an idea that nobody else comes up with and that all gets dampened down the larger and more intrusive government becomes, especially if you follow a European model." ...|$|E

Abigail {{and the girls}} run about screaming, claiming Mary's spirit is attacking them {{in the form of}} a yellow bird, which <b>nobody</b> <b>else</b> <b>is</b> able to see. When Danforth tells the increasingly distraught Mary that he will sentence her to hang, she joins with the other girls and recants all her allegations against them, claiming John Proctor forced her to turn her against the others and that he harbors the devil.

The island is a [...] "bare rock" [...] with no hiding places, {{and no one could}} have arrived or left; thus, they uncomfortably conclude that any one of the seven remaining persons is the killer. Justice Wargrave leads the group in determining that as of yet, none of them can definitively be ruled out as the murderer. The next morning, Rogers is found dead while chopping wood, and after breakfast, Miss Brent is found dead in the kitchen, where she had been left alone after complaining of feeling unwell; she had been injected with potassium cyanide via a hypodermic needle.|$|E
2500|$|Upon the album's release, Corgan told CNN that {{he should}} have [...] "been given credit [...]" [...] Erlandson responded to Corgan's {{statements}} in a Rolling Stone interview, commenting: [...] "We were working on all the stuff that Courtney and I had already written. Billy really facilitated things, in a way... I would bring in the music, Courtney would start coming up with lyrics right away, and [...] would help map it all out." [...] Erlandson also stated: [...] "Courtney writes all her own lyrics. <b>Nobody</b> <b>else</b> <b>is</b> writing those lyrics and nobody ever has." [...] One journalist took note of the controversy when reviewing the album, stating: [...] "Back in 1994, the acclaim for Live Through This was undercut by whispers that Love's late husband wrote the album. Combine those conspiracy theories with the unfounded but persistent rumor that Cobain was actually murdered, and it is no surprise that, in the song [...] "Celebrity Skin", Love calls herself a walking study in demonology." ...|$|E

2500|$|SandÃ© {{said the}} key to a {{successful}} song was simplicity. The singer pointed out that she could never have used songs which she wrote when she was 17 because she made the songs too complicated; saying there were too many words and parts to the track. She stated that the key feature to a classical song was keeping the [...] "melody simple" [...] and having big [...] "lyric effective", which was much easier said than actually done. SandÃ© said that another important key to a good song when songwriting is using [...] "honesty" [...] and [...] "raw emotion" [...] as the best way to write. She said that if she attempts to write something which is [...] "too smart" [...] the creative process will not work for her. [...] "Kill the Boy" [...] {{was one of the first}} ideas that came to SandÃ©'s head. If she has to work on a song longer than a day, she will not go back to it because it won't work. She went on to say if it was to work, the idea for the song would be almost instant. SandÃ© said that all her songs are about world peace and political issues. She is the same person since gaining the record deal with Virgin Records, and they are the same songs which she planned for the album before gaining the deal. She said that a lot of people didn't see the potential in the songs or in her, but once she gained the record deal, she gained more confidence. [...] "When you get knocked back so much you kind of learn to believe in yourself, stand up for yourself, because you can bet that <b>nobody</b> <b>else</b> <b>is</b> going to do it." ...|$|E
