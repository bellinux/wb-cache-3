5000|$|Until 1965, {{cars were}} {{assembled}} at the manufacturer's Slough premises, {{to the west}} of London, using a combination of French made knock down kits and locally sourced components, some of them machined on site. A French electrical system superseded the British one on the Slough cars in 1962, giving rise to a switch to [...] "continental style" [...] <b>negative</b> <b>earthing.</b> After 1965 cars for the British market were imported fully assembled from the company's French plant. The British-built cars are distinguished by their leather seats, wooden (early ID19 models) one piece plastic (early DS19 models) dashboards, chromed number plate mount let into the front bumper, and (on pre-1962 cars) Lucas-made electrics. These were all right hand drive cars.|$|R
50|$|In late 1967, {{sufficient}} {{changes were}} introduced for the factory {{to define a}} Mark II model for the 1968 model year. Changes included synchromesh on all four gears with revised ratios, an optional Borg-Warner automatic gearbox (except in the US), a new rear axle, and an alternator {{in place of the}} dynamo with a change to a <b>negative</b> <b>earth</b> system. To accommodate the new gearboxes there were significant changes to the sheet metal in the floorpan, and a new flat-topped transmission tunnel.|$|E
50|$|Apart {{from the}} obvious {{radiator}} grill and bumper bar changes, {{there were other}} less obvious changes that {{took place during the}} Midgets production run. The first cars assembled in 1967 were wired positive earth, had thinly cast engine blocks requiring nitrated crank shafts to provide extra rigidity. Later engines blocks were cast with thicker walls. Other changes were to <b>negative</b> <b>earth</b> wiring and alternator, chunckier boot lock handle, internal door latch handles, and quarter light window handles. Plastic window winder and internal door pull handles. Crossflow radiators running at higher pressures. The differential ratio was also changed to 3.9 some time during 1970.|$|E
5000|$|The Series 1 cars, {{which are}} by far the most valuable, {{essentially}} fall into two categories: Those made between 1961 and 1964, which had 3.8-litre engines and non-synchromesh transmissions, and those made between 1965-1967, which increased engine size and torque by around 10%, added a fully synchronised transmission, and also provided new reclining seats, an alternator in place of the prior generator, an electrical system switched to <b>negative</b> <b>earth,</b> and other modern amenities, all while keeping the same classic Series 1 styling. The 4.2-litre Series 1 E-Types also replaced the brake servo of the 3.8-litre with a more reliable unit.

50|$|The MGB {{initially}} had {{an extremely}} simple electrical system. Dash-mounted toggle switches controlled the lights, ventilation fan, and wipers {{with only the}} direction indicators being mounted on a stalk on the steering column. The ignition switch was also mounted on the dash. Like the MGA, the MGB utilized two 6-volt batteries wired in series to give a 12-volt positive earth configuration. The batteries were placed under a scuttle panel behind the seats making access difficult; the location gave excellent weight distribution and thus improved handling. The charging system used a Lucas dynamo. Later MGBs had considerable changes to the electrical system {{including the use of}} a single 12-volt battery, a change from positive to <b>negative</b> <b>earth,</b> safety-type toggle (rocker) switches, alternator in lieu of dynamo, additional warning lights and buzzers, and most common functions moved to steering column stalks.|$|E
5000|$|The next upgrade was {{presented}} at the London Motor Show in October 1966. Besides receiving the larger 1275 cc engine (which disappointed enthusiasts by being in a lower state of tune than that of the Mini-Cooper 'S'), the Mark IV and its cousin the Mark III MG Midget had several changes which were more than cosmetic. Most notable is the change from a removable convertible top, which had to be stowed in the boot, to a permanently affixed, folding top of greatly improved design, which was much easier to use. Separate brake and clutch master cylinders were fitted, as car manufacturers' thoughts began to turn to making their products safer. On US market versions the larger engine sacrificed some of its performance from 1968 on, through the use of smog pumps and other modifications to comply with federal emission control requirements. 1969 was the final year the Sprite was exported to the US. At the same time reversing lamps were made a standard fitment and the cars' electrical system was switched to <b>negative</b> <b>earth</b> and powered by an alternator rather than a dynamo. This was also the first year that reclining seats were fitted.|$|E

40|$|The {{geographic}} and geologic settings of Puerto Rico {{served as the}} context to develop a mixed methods investigation on: (1) {{the effects of a}} five-day long constructivist and field-based earth science education professional development institute upon 26 secondary school science teachers 2 ̆ 7 earth science conceptual knowledge, perceptions of fieldwork, and beliefs about teaching earth science; and (2) the implementation of participants 2 ̆ 7 newly acquired knowledge and experience in their science lessons at school. Qualitative data included questionnaires, semi-structured interviews, reflective journals, pre-post concept maps, and pre-post lesson plans. The Geoscience Concept Inventory and the Science Outdoor Learning Environment Inventory were translated into Spanish and culturally validated to collect quantitative data. Data was analyzed through a constructivist grounded theory methodology, descriptive statistics, and non-parametric methods. Participants came to the institute with serious deficiencies in earth science conceptual understanding, <b>negative</b> <b>earth</b> science teaching perspectives, and inadequate earth science teaching methodologies. The institute helped participants to improve their understanding of earth science concepts, content, and processes mostly related to the study of rocks, the Earth 2 ̆ 7 s structure, plate tectonics, maps, and the geology of Puerto Rico. Participants also improved their earth science teaching beliefs, perceptions on field-based education, and reflected on their environmental awareness and social responsibility. Participants greatly benefited from the field-based learning environment, inquiry-based teaching approaches modeled, the attention given to their affective domain, and reflections on their teaching practice as part of the institute 2 ̆ 7 s activities. The constructivist learning environment and the institute 2 ̆ 7 s contextualized and meaningful learning conceptual model were effective in generating interest and confidence in earth science teaching. Some participants successfully integrated inquiry-based lessons on the nature of science and earth science at their schools, but were unsuccessful in integrating field trips. The lack of teacher education programs and the inadequacy of earth science conceptual and pedagogical understanding held by in-service teachers are the main barriers for effective earth science teaching in Puerto Rico. This study established a foundation for future earth science education projects for Latino teachers. Additionally, {{as a result of this}} investigation various recommendations were made to effectively implement earth science teacher education programs in Puerto Rico and internationally. ...|$|E

50|$|A major {{expense of}} {{wire-line}} telephone service is the outside wire plant. Telephones transmit both the incoming and outgoing speech signals on {{a single pair of}} wires. A twisted pair line rejects electromagnetic interference (EMI) and crosstalk better than a single wire or an untwisted pair. The strong outgoing speech signal from the microphone (transmitter) does not overpower the weaker incoming speaker (receiver) signal with sidetone because a hybrid coil (A3) and other components compensate the imbalance. The junction box (B) arrests lightning (B2) and adjusts the line's resistance (B1) to maximize the signal power for the line length. Telephones have similar adjustments for inside line lengths (A8). The line voltages are <b>negative</b> compared to <b>earth,</b> to reduce galvanic corrosion. Negative voltage attracts positive metal ions toward the wires.|$|R

60|$|I {{had been}} a {{professional}} man, but some years before had retired upon a very comfortable income. I had always been very fond of scientific pursuits, and now made these the occupation and pleasure of much of my leisure time. Our home was in a small town; and {{in a corner of}} my grounds I built a laboratory, where I carried on my work and my experiments. I had long been anxious to discover the means not only of producing, but of retaining and controlling, a natural force, really the same as centrifugal force, but which I called negative gravity. This name I adopted because it indicated better than any other the action of the force in question, as I produced it. Positive gravity attracts everything toward the centre of the <b>earth.</b> <b>Negative</b> gravity, therefore, would be that power which repels everything from the centre of the earth, just as the negative pole of a magnet repels the needle, while the positive pole attracts it. My object was, in fact, to store centrifugal force and to render it constant, controllable, and available for use. The advantages of such a discovery could scarcely be described. In a word, it would lighten the burdens of the world.|$|R
40|$|The {{emission}} of secondary electrons from surfaces {{exposed to the}} space plasma and radiation environment {{is a process of}} great importance to space system engineering design and operations. A spacecraft will collect charge until it reaches an equilibrium potential gov,erned by the balance of incoming electron and ion currents from the space environment with outgoing secondary, backscattered, and photoelectron currents. Laboratory measurements of secondary electron yields are an important parameter for use in spacecraft charging analyses because the magnitude and sign of the equilibrium potential depends on both the energy spectrum of electrons and ions in the space environment and the electrical properties of the surface materials (including the energy dependent secondary electron yields). Typical benign equilibrium potentials range &om a few tens of volts positive in interplanetary space to a few volts <b>negative</b> in low <b>Earth</b> orbit. However, spacecraft are known to charge to negative potentials exceeding one to ten kilovolts in some environments and anomalies or system failures due to electrostatic discharges originating from highly charged surfaces becomes a serious concern. This presentation will provide a review of the spacecraft charging process with special emphasis on the role of secondary electrons in controlling the current balance process. Charging examples will include spacecraft in Earth orbit and interplanetary space as well as dust charging on the lunar surface, a phenomenon of importance to future lunar surface operations...|$|R
40|$|Lightning strike {{incidents}} {{to commercial}} and military aircraft and helicopters have produced damage unlike what is usually inflicted by laboratory tests conducted {{in accordance with}} the aircraft lightning environment defined in present aircraft lightning environment standards including SAE ARP 5412 and EUROCAE ED 81 and US Military Standard 464 A (and predecessor standards dating back to 1970). These standards define a first stroke current of 200 kA peak amplitude and overall time duration of 500 µs followed by intermediate and continuing currents whose amplitudes do not exceed 4 kA. There is no recognition of the possibility of lightning stroke currents of higher amplitude than 200 KA or, more likely, of lower than 200 kA amplitude, but of longer time duration than 500 µs. The physical damage effects that have prompted this review appear to have resulted from lightning stroke currents that have long durations and moderate to severe amplitudes, but not the fast rates of rise (di/dt) usually associated with lightning stroke currents especially those that lower <b>negative</b> charge to <b>earth.</b> A proposal is made to add to the present aircraft lightning standards a current component that represents a long duration stroke current of moderate amplitude. It is suggested that this proposal be taken up by the committees responsible for updating aircraft lightning standards: SAE AE 2 and EUROCAE WG 31. This proposal might be extended to incorporate a higher amplitude version of this current component to account also for some effects that can only be attributable to strokes of very high action integrals, but such an extension is not discussed in this paper...|$|R
40|$|For mankind as a whole, {{and in many}} respects, {{the world}} is {{becoming}} a better place each year. In both rich and poor countries {{the standard of living}} has improved steadily for a very long time. This progress has a serious drawback, the <b>negative</b> effects on <b>Earth’s</b> climate. It is clear that {{the only way we can}} live sustainably is by consuming much less. However, this is not enough: there is an undeniable need for new energy sources. As the world’s population grows, many countries will also face more severe shortages of food and of fresh, disease-free water. Most developing countries are situated in tropical regions and are therefore hit hard by increasing tropical storms and similar weather-based disasters, adding to these problems. Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC) technology has been proven to be an ideal candidate for addressing and resolving all of these problems for small island developing states (SIDS), and a few months ago, the EU set aside€ 72 million euros for constructing OTEC plants outside Martinique. Built on a much larger scale, OTEC can, as the only technology known to man, supply the world with its total energy and fresh water needs, increase seafood production many times over, and cooling off parts of the sea surface when they become too hot – all this without any atmospheric emissions. Thus, it is with great excitement that this very first issue of the only journal dedicated to OTEC is being published. The publication covers many facets of OTEC and related matters, such as OTEC technology, sustainability including gender and other social studies, renewable energy, marine biology, metallurgy, and research on developing countries. The publication is aimed at two different audiences, scientists directly or indirectly involved with OTEC technology, and a more diverse group of people consisting of scientists from non-technical fields, industry people, politicians, investors, educators, and more.

40|$|We {{present the}} results of an ongoing survey on the {{association}} between the muon flux variation at ground level (3 m above sea level) registered by the Tupi telescopes (Niteri-Brazil, 22 degrees. 9 S, 43 degrees. 2 W, 3 m) and the Earth-directed transient disturbances in the interplanetary medium propagating from the Sun (such as coronal mass ejections (CME), and corotating interaction regions (CIRs)). Their location inside the South Atlantic Anomaly region enables the muon telescopes to achieve a low rigidity of response to primary and secondary charged particles. The present study is primarily based on experimental events obtained by the Tupi telescopes in the period from 2010 August to 2011 December. This time period corresponds to the rising phase of solar cycle 24. The Tupi events are studied in correlation with data obtained by space-borne detectors (SOHO, ACE, GOES). Identification of interplanetary structures and associated solar activity was based on the nomenclature and definitions given by the satellite observations, including an incomplete list of possible interplanetary shocks observed by the CELIAS/MTOF Proton Monitor on the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) spacecraft. Among 29 experimental events reported in the present analysis, there are 15 possibly associated with the CMEs and sheaths, and 3 events with the CIRs (forward or reverse shocks); the origin of the remaining 11 events has not been determined by the satellite detectors. We compare the observed time (delayed or anticipated) of the muon excess (positive or <b>negative)</b> signal on <b>Earth</b> (the Tupi telescopes) with the trigger time of the interplanetary disturbances registered by the satellites located at Lagrange point L 1 (SOHO and ACE). The temporal correlation of the observed ground-based events with solar transient events detected by spacecraft suggests a real physical connection between them. We found that the majority of observed events detected by the Tupi experiment were delayed in relation to the satellite triggers. This result agrees with theoretical expectations. Our experimental data indicate that the Tupi experiment is able to add new information and can be complementary to other techniques designed to interpret the origin of some interplanetary disturbances observed by satellites...|$|R
