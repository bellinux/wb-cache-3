Although these challenges add to the locational and time dependency of the underlying cost of operating the system, this variability in time and location is not reflected in residential tariff schemes. Consequently, residential users are not incentivised to react to varying system conditions and to help the integration of renewable energy resources. Therefore, this paper provides a theoretical framework for designing a locational dynamic pricing scheme. This {{can be used to}} assess existing tariff structures for consumption and injection, and can serve as a theoretical background for developing <b>new</b> <b>tariff</b> <b>schemes.</b> Starting from the underlying costs, this paper shows that the potential for locational dynamic pricing depends on the locational and time dependency of its cost drivers. When converting costs into tariffs, the tariff design should be determined. This includes the advance notice of sending tariffs to users, and the length of price blocks and price patterns. This tariff design should find a balance between tariff principles related to costs, practicality and social acceptability on the one hand, and the resulting demand response incentive on the other. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|E

40|$|The {{electricity}} {{sector in}} Sri Lanka {{is governed by}} the Sri Lanka Electricity Act, No. 20 of 2009 (as amended), and the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) is empowered by the Electricity Act to regulate the electricity industry. Ceylon Electricity Board has license of Generation, Transmission and Distribution, while the Transmission Licensee is the Transmission System Operator and the Single Buyer. Five Distribution Licensees (DLs) buy electricity from the Transmission Licensee (TL). Tariffs and charges levied from the Distribution Licensees for purchasing of electricity from the Transmission Licensee are determined in pursuant to the Tariff Methodology approved by PUCSL. In addition to the five DLs {{there are a few}} customers directly served by the TL at 220 kV and 132 kV voltage level, but charged under the tariff imposed by DLs, since the presently approved tariff methodology is not properly address tariff calculation for the bulk customers connected at 132 kV/ 220 kV. In this research, different power market models, transmission pricing principles and methodologies in different power markets were studied first, followed by transmission pricing methodologies in different countries. The study evaluated three main methodologies which can be implemented in Sri Lanka: (i) embedded cost based, (ii) marginal cost based and (iii) composite cost based methodologies. By analyzing data in each proposed model, the best suited methodology for Sri Lanka is recommended to be the embedded cost based method. The <b>new</b> <b>tariff</b> <b>scheme</b> which is to be implemented should recover the cost of utility, simple, stable and easy to implement in existing framework. With this background it was proposed the embedded cost based tariff calculation model, as the most appropriate option for calculation the transmission tariff in Sri Lanka...|$|R

We study the tariff experiment conducted by South Central Bell where local telephone measured tariffs were introduced {{for the first time}} in Louisville, KY. Households were given the choice to remain in a flat rate scheme or switch to the <b>new</b> measured <b>tariff</b> <b>scheme.</b> The results of the analysis support models where consumers react to a change in the environment in the direction predicted by theories of rational investment in information. Households learn rapidly to undertake optimal decisions, and react to potential savings of seemingly small magnitude, typically about $ 5. 00 per month. We find no support for models where consumers’ responses are determined by inertia or impulsiveness, including systematic tendencies to undervalue future wants common to models of hyperbolic discounting. From a methodological viewpoint, the analysis shows how the appropriate treatment of predetermined endogenous variables and state dependence turns out to be crucial for interpreting the data. dynamic consistency; dynamic discrete choice panel data analysis; learning; rationality...|$|R
40|$|This report {{deals with}} design issues for Internet <b>tariff</b> <b>schemes.</b> It proposes a {{framework}} that is able to explain why current tariff proposals look like as they do, and why there cannot exist tariffs that are {{significantly different from the}} existing ones. Moreover, it is demonstrated how an exten-sion of this framework allows to design a <b>new</b> <b>tariff</b> that eventually even solves the so-called “fea-sibility problem”, i. e. the trade-off between technical, economical and user-based requirements. To this end, the general focus is directed towards time-scales. There are four time-scales identified as being relevant for Internet tariffing, and the close relationship between these time-scales and existing tariffs is demonstrated. Afterwards, the notion of “tariff reaction ” is introduced, and the Cumulus Pricing Scheme CPS is presented as leading example of the resulting <b>new</b> <b>tariff</b> struc-tures. The second part of the report deals with some important mathematical results for CPS and various implementation aspects as well as a couple of open issues to be answered by simulation. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{liberalisation}} of the telecommunication {{sector has}} dispossessed regulators {{from the use}} of cross-subsidisation in order to achieve the universality goal. In a liberalised context, special <b>tariff</b> <b>schemes</b> represent one possible policy tool in order to increase the penetration rate. This paper focuses on the UK fixed home telephone network and analyses LUS and InContact <b>tariff</b> <b>schemes</b> adopted by British Telecom (BT) in the 1990 s. Both schemes turned out to yield unsatisfactory results. This paper, after reviewing past literature on telephone access demand, uses an econometric approach to test whether such schemes were properly targeted to suit the characteristics of "un-phoned" households. The empirical analysis points out that some important socio-economic factors, rather than simply low income, are the major drivers of non-connection. The failure to take into account these and other factors discussed in the paper, has significantly contributed to the poor results of the two special <b>tariff</b> <b>schemes.</b> In this context the UK experience provides a useful basis for discussion on the validity of policies aimed at promoting network good adoption via the introduction of special <b>tariff</b> <b>schemes.</b> Universal service Home telephone network Special tariffs Probit model UK...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the last}} two decades, feed-in tariffs have pushed the massive {{expansion}} of electricity from renewable energy sources in Germany. Between 1991 and 1999, feed-in tariffs were prescribed through the Electricity Feed-in Law – the so-called Stromeinspeisungsgesetz (SEG) – at relatively moderate rates. From 2000 onwards, the SEG {{was replaced by the}} Renewable Energy Sources Act – the so-called Erneuerbare-Energien-Gesetz (EEG) – with much higher subsidy rates. The rise in subsidies to renewable power generation under the EEG came along with a substantial increase in electricity prices provoking an intense public debate on the benefits of renewable energy promotion. In our regression analysis, we assess one popular justification for feed-in tariffs: the demand-side effect of induced innovation. We find that the innovation impact of the German feed-in <b>tariff</b> <b>scheme</b> over {{the last two}} decades supports the positive innovation hypothesis. However, the inducement effect of the feed-in <b>tariff</b> <b>scheme</b> under the EEG is not significantly different from that of the SEG. Given the drastic cost of the EEG, we caution against the appraisal of the EEG feed-in <b>tariff</b> <b>scheme</b> solely on the grounds of its impact on technological innovation...|$|R

The example includes the minimum amount of firm-level savings on tariff payments, i. e., trade values under FTA schemes multiplied by the tariff margin, in all transactions. Consequently, the median costs for FTA utilization in 2008, for example, are estimated to be approximately US$ 2, 000 for exports from China, US$ 300 for exports from Australia, and US$ 1, 000 for exports from Japan.

40|$|The {{preference}} utilization ratio, i. e., {{the share}} of imports under preferential <b>tariff</b> <b>schemes</b> out of total imports, has been a popular indicator for measuring the usage of preferential tariffs vis-à-vis tariffs on a most-favored-nation basis. A crucial shortcoming of this measure is the data requirements, particularly for import value data classified by <b>tariff</b> <b>schemes,</b> which are not available in most countries. This study proposes an alternative measure for preferential tariff utilization, termed the "tariff exemption ratio. " This measure offers the unique advantage of needing only publicly available data, such as those provided by the World Development Indicators, for its computations. We can thus calculate this measure for most countries for an international comparison. Our finding is that tariff exemption ratios differ widely across countries, with a global average of approximately 50 %...|$|R
