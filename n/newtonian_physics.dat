5|$|Halley's {{prediction}} of the comet's return {{proved to be}} correct, {{although it was not}} seen until 25 December 1758, by Johann Georg Palitzsch, a German farmer and amateur astronomer. It did not pass through its perihelion until 13 March 1759, the attraction of Jupiter and Saturn having caused a retardation of 618 days. This effect was computed prior to its return (with a one-month error to 13 April) by a team of three French mathematicians, Alexis Clairaut, Joseph Lalande, and Nicole-Reine Lepaute. The confirmation of the comet's return was the first time anything other than planets had been shown to orbit the Sun. It {{was also one of the}} earliest successful tests of <b>Newtonian</b> <b>physics,</b> and a clear demonstration of its explanatory power. The comet was first named in Halley's honour by French astronomer Nicolas Louis de Lacaille in 1759.|$|E
5|$|In Computer Space, {{the player}} {{controls}} a rocket as {{it attempts to}} shoot a pair of flying saucers while avoiding enemy fire. The monochrome game has the three ships flying on a two-dimensional plane, set {{against the backdrop of}} a starfield. Missiles are fired one at a time, and there is a cooldown period between launches. The player's rocket follows <b>Newtonian</b> <b>physics,</b> remaining in motion even when the player is not accelerating, though the rocket can rotate at a constant rate without inertia. The flying saucers stay in place or glide in a zig-zag pattern around the screen in tandem, with one staying a constant distance directly below the other. If a ship or missile moves past one edge of the screen, it reappears on the other side in a wraparound effect. While the missile is in flight, the player can turn it left or right by turning their rocket.|$|E
5|$|Players {{have access}} to a {{communication}} system {{that can be used to}} contact other starfighters, which has more impact in the game's single-player mode. Through the system, the player can order either a single starfighter, a wing, or all craft (depending on how many are still active), with tasks such as taking down a player's target, covering the player, or engaging all hostiles, amongst other commands. The system can also be used to call in for reinforcements (if available), and requesting deployment of a support ship to repair a player's subsystems as well as re-arm their secondary weapons; the support ship can be given limited orders when deployed. Furthermore, a player can manage the energy input of certain subsystems, thus affecting how efficient it is in battle; changing the input for engines, for example, changes the max speed of the craft and the time needed to fully recharge the ship's afterburners. The controls for the game in both modes are designed so that players have ease with controlling their starfighter and its systems, and be able to do so with either a joystick, or a keyboard (on its own or with a mouse). Because of the flexibility in controls, some have categorised Descent: FreeSpace as a flight simulator, since it has more controls and commands than a typical arcade game, yet its flight model is simple, akin to that of the game , and incorporates some elements of <b>Newtonian</b> <b>physics</b> such as precise collision physics.|$|E

50|$|Most {{games in}} the space combat genre feature futuristic {{scenarios}} involving space flight and extra planetary combat. Such games generally place the player into the controls of a small starfighter or smaller starship in a military force of similar and larger spaceships and don't {{take into account the}} physics of space flight, usually often citing some technological advancement to explain the lack thereof. The prominent Wing Commander, X-Wing and Freespace series all use this approach. Exceptions include the first Independence War and the Star Trek: Bridge Commander series, which model craft at a larger scale and/or in a more strategic fashion. It should be noted that I-War also features <b>Newtonian</b> style <b>physics</b> for the behaviour of the space craft, but not orbital mechanics.|$|R

In addition, the adjectival form, where one exists, is usually lowercased for medical terms (thus parkinsonian although Parkinson disease), and gram-negative, gram-positive although Gram stain. Uppercase Gram-positive or Gram-negative however are also commonly used in scientific journal articles and publications.

40|$|Some {{philosophers}} - such as Popper and Kuhn - {{have cited}} the theory-shift from <b>Newtonian</b> to Einsteinian <b>physics</b> {{as one of}} the great scientific revolutions. This thesis argues against this that the shift was 'evolutionary' and exhibits a high degree of continuity (or quasi-continuity). I will develop a view that selects the relationships between events - one specified by dynamical laws at issue - as the essential elements within these two physical theoretical frameworks. This view brings together the dynamical perspective of space-time (developed by Harvey Brown, Robert DiSalle and Nick Huggett) and structuralism (developed by Henri Poincare and Pierre Duhem, and more recently resuscitated by John Worrall). The former view turns our attention away from the structure of space-time to the dynamical laws. While the second view will clarify to what extent the theory-change is evolutionary. The thesis consists of five chapters. The first chapter discusses the failures of existing views on the theory-change. The second chapter develops my own positive view - building, as indicated, on the work of the two aforementioned perspectives. The third and fourth chapters consider detailed aspects of the particular theory-change from <b>Newtonian</b> to Einsteinian <b>physics</b> from the point of view. The final chapter discusses the strengths of my view in comparison to the existing accounts of the theory-change...|$|R

25|$|In general relativity, {{the effects}} of {{gravitation}} are ascribed to spacetime curvature instead of a force.

40|$|D. Litt. et Phil. The {{aim of this}} {{investigation}} is to provide support to the growing evidence that people's paradigms directly influence the way differences are managed. Adherence to the old or Newtonian model has seemingly led to a restricted {{ability to deal with}} differences. Adherence to the new or quantum model, on the other hand, appears to facilitate not only the understanding of why there are so many differences and why they should be "celebrated" (topic of the American Counselling Association's 1995 Conference, Denver), but also encourages people to freely and nonjudgementally acknowledge, explore and integrate these differences. As a first step toward achieving this aim, {{a review of the literature}} regarding the existence of differences, the perceived causes of differences, and the perceived ways of managing differences in interpersonal relationship up to the present time will be provided. Secondly, the importance of paradigms in general, and of the natural scientific paradigms in particular, will be illustrated. Concepts of <b>Newtonian</b> and quantum <b>physics</b> that are considered relevant to the investigation will be described under this heading. Thirdly, the rationale of the exploratory, or qualitative study will be outlined. Fourthly, a chapter linking the natural scientific paradigms. to the discipline of psychology will be presented. Psychological analogies of Newtonian and quantum concepts will be put forward as well as examples of Newtonian and quantum psychology. Finally, implications of the described and discussed findings of <b>Newtonian</b> and quantum <b>physics</b> on the management of psychological differences will be explored, so that the 'celebration' and integration of differences can, indeed, be promoted...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{target of}} this paper is a {{discussion}} of the meaning of the Newtonian concept of a reference frame showing no rotation with respect to a set of distant celestial objects in the framework of general relativity. Because of the properties of Newtonian absolute space and time and the existence of global inertial reference systems in Newton’s theory the theoretical construction of such a globally nonrotating reference frame is obvious. This definitively no longer is the case in a relativistic framework. There exist no global inertial reference systems and one faces the necessity to give the notion of nonrotating frames a rigorous meaning. Considering possible definitions of nonrotating reference frames in both <b>Newtonian</b> and relativistic <b>physics,</b> we conclude that the concept of relative spatial rotation between reference systems plays a fundamental role in defining nonrotating astronomica...|$|R

A number of effects in the Solar System cause the perihelia of planets to precess (rotate) around the Sun. The principal cause {{is the presence of}} other planets which perturb one another's orbit.

The invariance of light speed is one of the postulates of special relativity.|$|E
40|$|General {{equilibrium}} equations {{in economics}} {{play the same}} role with many-body <b>Newtonian</b> equations in <b>physics.</b> Accordingly, each solution of the general equilibrium equations {{can be regarded as}} a possible microstate of the economic system. Since Arrow's Impossibility Theorem and Rawls' principle of social fairness will provide a powerful support for the hypothesis of equal probability, then the principle of maximum entropy is available in a just and equilibrium economy so that an income distribution will occur spontaneously (with the largest probability). Remarkably, some scholars have observed such an income distribution in some democratic countries, e. g. USA. This result implies that the hypothesis of equal probability may be only suitable for some "fair" systems (economic or physical systems). From this meaning, the non-equilibrium systems may be "unfair" so that the hypothesis of equal probability is unavailable. Comment: Newtonian equations in Economic syste...|$|R

Choi based his understanding of power on biomechanics and <b>Newtonian</b> <b>physics</b> as well as Chinese martial arts. For example, Choi observed {{that the power of}} a strike increases quadratically with the speed of the strike, but increases only linearly with the mass of the striking object.

25|$|There {{is also a}} rival {{tradition}} within <b>Newtonian</b> <b>physics</b> {{and engineering}} which sees weight as that which is measured when one uses scales. There the weight {{is a measure of}} the magnitude of the reaction force exerted on a body. Typically, in measuring an object's weight, the object is placed on scales at rest with respect to the earth, but the definition can be extended to other states of motion. Thus, in a state of free fall, the weight would be zero. In this second sense of weight, terrestrial objects can be weightless. Ignoring air resistance, the famous apple falling from the tree, on its way to meet the ground near Isaac Newton, is weightless.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, quantum mechanics—the physics of the extremely small—has revealed previously concealed aspects of events.

At the scale where humans exist and interact with the universe, Newtonian mechanics remain useful, and make relatively accurate predictions (e.g. calculating the trajectory of a bullet).

40|$|Despite {{the fact}} that it has been known since the time of Heisenberg that quantum {{operators}} obey a quantum version of Newton's laws, students are often told that derivations of quantum mechanics must necessarily follow from the Hamiltonian or Lagrangian formulations of mechanics. Here, we first derive the existing Heisenberg equations of motion from Newton's laws and the uncertainty principle using only the equations F=dP/dt, P=mdV/dt, and [X,P]=i. Then, a new expression for the propagator is derived that makes a connection between time evolution in quantum mechanics and the motion of a classical particle under Newton's laws. The propagator is solved for three cases where an exact solution is possible 1) the free particle 2) the harmonic oscillator 3) a constant force, or linear potential in the standard interpretation.
