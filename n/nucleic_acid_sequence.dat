5|$|The code defines how {{sequences}} of nucleotide triplets, called codons, specify which amino acid {{will be added}} next during protein synthesis. With some exceptions, a three-nucleotide codon in a <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>sequence</b> specifies a single amino acid. The vast majority of genes are encoded with a single scheme (see the RNA codon table). That scheme {{is often referred to}} as the canonical or standard genetic code, or simply the genetic code, though variant codes (such as in human mitochondria) exist.|$|E
5|$|Octopuses {{and other}} coleoid {{cephalopods}} {{are capable of}} greater RNA editing (which involves changes to the <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>sequence</b> of the primary transcript of RNA molecules) than any other organisms. Editing is concentrated in the nervous system and affects proteins involved in neural excitability and neuronal morphology. More than 60% of RNA transcripts for coleoid brains are recoded by editing, compared to less than 1% for a human or fruit fly. Coleoids rely mostly on ADAR enzymes for RNA editing, which requires large double-stranded RNA structures to flank to the editing sites. Both the structures and editing sites are conserved in the coleoid genome and the mutation rates for the sites are severely hampered. Hence, greater transcriptome plasticity has come {{as the cost of}} slower genome evolution. High levels of RNA editing {{do not appear to be}} present in more basal cephalopods or other molluscs.|$|E
5|$|Bioinformatics {{involves}} {{the development of}} techniques to store, data mine, search and manipulate biological data, including DNA <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>sequence</b> data. These have led to widely applied advances in computer science, especially string searching algorithms, machine learning, and database theory. String searching or matching algorithms, which find an occurrence of a sequence of letters inside a larger sequence of letters, were developed to search for specific sequences of nucleotides. The DNA sequence may be aligned with other DNA sequences to identify homologous sequences and locate the specific mutations that make them distinct. These techniques, especially multiple sequence alignment, are used in studying phylogenetic relationships and protein function. Data sets representing entire genomes' worth of DNA sequences, such as those produced by the Human Genome Project, are difficult to use without the annotations that identify the locations of genes and regulatory elements on each chromosome. Regions of DNA sequence that have the characteristic patterns associated with protein- or RNA-coding genes can be identified by gene finding algorithms, which allow researchers to predict the presence of particular gene products and their possible functions in an organism even before they have been isolated experimentally. Entire genomes may also be compared, which can {{shed light on the}} evolutionary history of particular organism and permit the examination of complex evolutionary events.|$|E

Using this method, absolute statements are not always possible regarding causation. Since this is true, higher amounts of distinctive pathogenic <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>sequences</b> would be in those exhibiting disease compared to controls since inoculating those without the pathogen is unethical.

25|$|There are {{a number}} of biophysical {{techniques}} for determining sequence information. Protein sequence can be determined by Edman degradation, in which the N-terminal residues are hydrolyzed from the chain one at a time, derivatized, and then identified. Mass spectrometer techniques can also be used. <b>Nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>sequence</b> can be determined using gel electrophoresis and capillary electrophoresis. Lastly, mechanical properties of these biopolymers can often be measured using optical tweezers or atomic-force microscopy. Dual polarization interferometry can be used to measure the conformational changes or self-assembly of these materials when stimulated by pH, temperature, ionic strength or other binding partners.|$|E
25|$|The {{sequence}} of DNA, which encodes the {{sequence of}} the amino acids in a protein, is copied into a messenger RNA chain. It may be copied many times into RNA chains. Ribosomes can bind to a messenger RNA chain and use its sequence for determining the correct sequence of amino acids. Amino acids are selected, collected, and carried to the ribosome by transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules, which enter {{one part of the}} ribosome and bind to the messenger RNA chain. It is during this binding that the correct translation of <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>sequence</b> to amino acid sequence occurs. For each coding triplet in the messenger RNA there is a distinct transfer RNA that matches and which carries the correct amino acid for that coding triplet. The attached amino acids are then linked together by another part of the ribosome. Once the protein is produced, it can then fold to produce a specific functional three-dimensional structure although during synthesis some proteins start folding into their correct form.|$|E

40|$|High quality {{sequence}} alignments of RNA and DNA sequences are {{a prerequisite}} for the comparative analysis of genomic sequence data. The high level of sequence heterogeneity, as compared to proteins, makes good alignments of <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>sequences</b> often impossible. In many cases, the <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>sequences</b> under consideration, or parts of them, code for proteins. While protein sequences can still show substantial homology, the corresponding <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>sequences</b> have already evolutionarily diverged, thus they are essentially randomized.

500|$|Oswald Avery {{showed in}} 1943 that DNA was likely the genetic {{material}} of the chromosome, not its protein; {{the issue was}} settled decisively with the 1952 Hershey–Chase experiment—one of many contributions from the so-called phage group centered around physicist-turned-biologist Max Delbrück. In 1953 James Watson and Francis Crick, building {{on the work of}} Maurice Wilkins and Rosalind Franklin, suggested that the structure of DNA was a double helix. In their famous paper [...] "Molecular structure of Nucleic Acids", Watson and Crick noted coyly, [...] "It has not escaped our notice that the specific pairing we have postulated immediately suggests a possible copying mechanism for the genetic material." [...] After the 1958 Meselson–Stahl experiment confirmed the semiconservative replication of DNA, it was clear to most biologists that <b>nucleic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>sequence</b> must somehow determine amino acid sequence in proteins; physicist George Gamow proposed that a fixed genetic code connected proteins and DNA. Between 1953 and 1961, there were few known biological sequences—either DNA or protein—but an abundance of proposed code systems, a situation made even more complicated by expanding knowledge of the intermediate role of RNA. To actually decipher the code, it took an extensive series of experiments in biochemistry and bacterial genetics, between 1961 and 1966—most importantly the work of Nirenberg and Khorana.|$|E
