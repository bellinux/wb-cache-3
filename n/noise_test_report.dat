40|$|The signal {{amplification}} and summation electronics of the ATLAS Hadronic End-cap Calorimeter (HEC) {{is operated}} at {{the circumference of}} the HEC calorimeters inside the cryostats in liquid argon. The present electronics is designed to operate at irradiation levels expected for the LHC. For operation at the sLHC the irradiation levels {{are expected to be}} a factor 10 higher, therefore a new electronic system might be needed. The technological possibilities are investigated. From irradiation tests of the present HEC electronics it is known that it will operate up to a dose of 55 kGy of ionizing radiation and up to a neutron fluence of 3 * 10 ** 14 n/cm** 2, where it shows some degradation of performance. This matches well the requirements of up to 1. 5 * 10 ** 13 n/cm** 2 for 10 years of LHC operation, including safety factors. For a subsequent sLHC running phase with 10 times higher expected irradiation levels, a more radiation hard HEC electronics will be needed. Therefore generic studies of different technologies have been carried out at the transistor level to understand the radiation hardness up to integrated neutron fluxes of ~ 2 * 10 ** 16 n/cm** 2 and the behaviour during operation at cryogenic temperatures. The S-parameter technique has been used to monitor the performance e. g. of gain and linearity during irradiation at room temperature. In addition, DC measurements before and after irradiation have been compared. Results of these tests and of accompanying <b>noise</b> <b>tests</b> are <b>reported.</b> In addition, results of S-parameter measurements will be reported operating the transistors in liquid nitrogen. Conclusions are drawn and the potential is assessed on the viability of using the tested technologies for carrying out the design of new HEC cold electronics for the sLHC...|$|R

However, the {{mechanism}} and propagation of the noise generated by these tires have not been systematically investigated. To determine the noise of heavy truck tires with different structures and patterns, and to analyze the correlation between the indoor tire noise and coast-by tire noise, an integrated tire indoor <b>noise</b> <b>test</b> and a coast-by <b>noise</b> <b>test</b> were designed and successfully implemented. The indoor test was conducted on a drum inside a semi-anechoic chamber to simultaneously measure the near field and far field noise of the tires. The outdoor measurements were carried out using a coast-by test on the new ISO 10844 surface. A formula for quantitative analysis with appropriate corrections was developed to analyze the data with reasonable errors, which can be used to predict the coast-by noise through the indoor tire <b>noise</b> <b>test</b> accurately and effectively. The analysis shows that when trying to build the relationship between indoor and outdoor heavy truck tire noise, care should be taken to differentiate the tires with a load capacity index in excess of 121 and without any dual fitting indication from ordinary tires, due to the specified test procedure...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} approximate digital implementations {{of two new}} mathematical transforms, namely, the ridgelet transform [2] and the curvelet transform [6], [5]. Our implementations offer exact reconstruction, stability against perturbations, ease of implementation, and low computational complexity. A central tool is Fourier-domain computation of {{an approximate}} digital Radon transform. We introduce a very simple interpolation in Fourier space which takes Cartesian samples and yields samples on a rectopolar grid, which is a pseudo-polar sampling set based on a concentric squares geometry. Despite the crudeness of our interpolation, the visual performance is surprisingly good. Our ridgelet transform applies to the Radon transform a special overcomplete wavelet pyramid whose wavelets have compact support in the frequency domain. Our curvelet transform uses our ridgelet transform as a component step, and implements curvelet subbands using a filter bank of à trous wavelet filters. Our philosophy throughout is that transforms should be overcomplete, rather than critically sampled. We apply these digital transforms to the denoising of some standard images embedded in white <b>noise.</b> In the <b>tests</b> <b>reported</b> here, simple thresholding of the curvelet coefficients is very competitive with “state of the art ” techniques based on wavelets, including thresholding of decimated or undecimated wavelet transforms and also including tree-based Bayesian posterior mean methods. Moreover, the curvelet reconstructions exhibit higher perceptual quality than wavelet-based reconstructions, offering visually sharper images and, in particular, higher quality recovery of edges and of faint linear and curvilinear features. Existing theory for curvelet and ridgelet transforms suggests that these new approaches can outperform wavelet methods in certain image reconstruction problems. The empirical results reported here are in encouraging agreement...|$|R

40|$|This {{article was}} {{accepted}} for publication in the journal Applied Acoustics: [URL] many people are exposed to road traffic noise in urban areas, current legislation aims to limit vehicle noise emissions. In Europe, the vehicle pass-by <b>noise</b> <b>test</b> is implemented {{according to the international}} standard ISO 362. As a result of more recent investigations of urban traffic, a revision to the ISO 362 standard has been proposed that includes a constantspeed test in addition to the traditional accelerated test {{in order to determine the}} pass-by noise value. To ensure compliance with the pass-by <b>noise</b> <b>test</b> vehicle manufacturers and suppliers must quantify vehicle noise source characteristics during the design stage of the vehicle. In addition, predictive tools need to be available during the product development phase in order to estimate the final pass-by noise level. In this paper an extensive literature survey is presented of noise source characteristics in the ISO 362 vehicle pass-by <b>noise</b> <b>test.</b> Vehicle pass-by <b>noise</b> is analysed in the time and frequency domains and a ranking of the noise source contributions is established.

Consequently, the aim {{of this study was to}} compare the results of gap in <b>noise</b> <b>test</b> in 18 to 40 -year-old patients with multiple sclerosis and normal participants. Methods: This cross-sectional non-invasive cohort study was conducted on 20 patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (mean age: 28. 9 years) and 26 healthy normal hearing participant (mean age: 27. 7 years) in the age range 18 to 40 years. The approximate threshold and percent of corrected responses were obtained and then were analyzed using Student's t-test. Results: There was an increase in gap detection and decrease in percent of corrected responses in gap in <b>noise</b> <b>test</b> within multiple sclerosis patients in comparison with normal people (p< 0. 0001). Moreover, there were a correlation of 78 % between increasing disease duration and approximate threshold and also a correlation of 82 % between increasing disease duration and corrected responses (p< 0. 0001). Conclusion: Based on the findings of this study, it seems that people with multiple sclerosis suffer from some degree of disorder in the temporal resolution which might be due to involvement of central nerve system and, somehow, deficit in central auditory processing. Therefore, for evaluating the temporal resolution in people with multiple sclerosis, gap in <b>noise</b> <b>test</b> could be useful...|$|R

Environmental noise exposure represents a burden to people and can result in cardiovascular disease, sleep disturbance or annoyance. Road traffic noise is a main contributor to environmental noise, thus, {{it is intended to}} be reduced and limited by legislation in order to increase health and life quality. Vehicle pass-by <b>noise</b> <b>tests</b> are conducted according to the international standard ISO 362, which is suppose to reflect the noise emission of a vehicle in an urban traffic environment. It is discussed that nowadays urban traffic situation requires a change of the test procedure with accompanying reductions in pass-by noise limits. To achieve compliance with the pass-by <b>noise</b> <b>test</b> it is important that vehicle engineers have access to predictive tools at the design stage. In this paper the initial development of a pass-by noise predictive tool is reported. To begin with, the vehicle pass-by <b>noise</b> <b>test</b> according to standard ISO 362 is summarized.
