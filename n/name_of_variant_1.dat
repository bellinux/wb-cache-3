40|$|WWOX is a {{candidate}} tumour suppressor gene that exhibits LOH or homozygous deletion in several tumour types. As well as the predominant full-length transcript (<b>variant</b> <b>1)</b> there also exist alternatively spliced transcripts found previously only in malignant tissue. It {{has been suggested that}} proteins encoded by these variants may interfere with normal WWOX function in a dominant negative fashion. The most prevalent alternate transcript demonstrated in ovarian cancer is variant 4, which lacks exons 6 - 8. Here, we report the first comparison of the mRNA expression <b>of</b> WWOX <b>variants</b> <b>1</b> and 4 in human ovarian tumours and normal ovaries, and correlate expression with clinical data. We demonstrate significantly lower WWOX <b>variant</b> <b>1</b> expression in tumours than in normal ovaries. This reduction was not associated with any specific clinical subgroup. Variant 4 was expressed at low levels, and significantly associated with high grade and advanced stage ovarian cancer. Furthermore, tumours co-expressing variant 4 and relatively high levels <b>of</b> <b>variant</b> <b>1</b> showed significantly worse survival than tumours expressing <b>variant</b> <b>1</b> alone. However, <b>variant</b> 4 was also frequently identified in non-malignant ovarian tissue. These results support the role <b>of</b> WWOX <b>variant</b> <b>1</b> as a suppressor of ovarian tumouri-genesis, but the role <b>of</b> <b>variant</b> 4 remains speculative...|$|R
50|$|When byte {{swapping}} {{is required}} to convert between the big-endian byte order <b>of</b> <b>variant</b> <b>1</b> and the little-endian byte order <b>of</b> <b>variant</b> 2, the fields above define the swapping. The first three fields are unsigned 32- and 16-bit integers and are subject to swapping, while the last two fields consist of uninterpreted bytes, not subject to swapping. This byte swapping applies even for version 3, 4, and 5 UUID's where the canonical fields do not correspond {{to the content of}} the UUID.|$|R

40|$|Colony opacity {{variants}} {{were detected}} for type III group B streptococci (GBS). Transparent colonies predominate in the parent GBS, with occasional colonies having opaque portions. Two stable opaque <b>variants</b> (<b>1.</b> 1 and 1. 5) {{were compared with}} three transparent clones (1. 2, 1. 3, and 1. 4). All grew well on blood agar and on GC medium, but <b>variant</b> <b>1.</b> 1 failed to grow on Todd-Hewitt medium. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy demonstrated that colony opacity correlated with bacterial aggregation status, with opaque variants forming longer and more organized chains. Opaque-transparent switches were observed in both directions for most variants, with transparent to opaque noted most frequently, but 1. 5 did not switch at all. Switching of the opacity phenotype was observed both in vitro and in neonatal mice. Relationships between colony opacity and several cell surface phenomena were explored. (i) Opaque <b>variant</b> <b>1.</b> 1 had two surface proteins (46 and 75 kDa) that were either unique or greatly overexpressed. (ii) <b>Variant</b> <b>1.</b> 1 was deficient in type III polysaccharide, while 1. 5 lacked group B antigen. Diminished capsular polysaccharide <b>of</b> <b>variant</b> <b>1.</b> 1 was reflected in reduced negative electrophoretic mobility and in increased buoyant density. (iii) Transparent variant colonies growing closest to a penicillin disk were opaque, but colonial variants {{did not differ in}} their sensitivity to penicillin. These data indicate that GBS can exist in both opaque and transparent forms, with opaque appearance occurring by multiple routes. Opaque variants grow poorly on Todd-Hewitt medium generally used for isolation of GBS, so any possible relationships between opacity variation and pathogenesis of GBS infection are unknown...|$|R
