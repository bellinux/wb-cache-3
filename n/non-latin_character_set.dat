40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the realization of}} the Greek DBpedia as part of the DBpedia Internationalization proccess. “I 18 n fil-ters ” are proposed as pluggable components of the DBpedia Information Extraction Framework, in order to address is-sues concerning covering more knowledge from non-English Wikipedia’s and International Resource Identifier (IRI) sup-port. Moreover, a new extractor is introduced that uses the Wikipedia Interlanguage Links to connect international DB-pedia’s and transitively to the LOD Cloud. Finally, the paper illustrates the first international project which pro-vides Transparent Content Negotiation (TCN) rules for In-ternational Resource Identifier’s (IRI’s) for de-referencing purposes. This work could serve as a guide not only for other multilingual DBpedias, but for publishing linked data in languages based on <b>non-Latin</b> <b>character</b> <b>sets</b> as well...|$|R
40|$|Since its {{launch in}} 2006, Twitter has turned from a niche service to a mass phenomenon. By the {{beginning}} of 2013, the platform claims {{to have more than}} 200 million active users, who “post over 400 million tweets per day” (Twitter, 2013). Its success is spreading globally; Twitter is now available in 33 different languages, and has significantly increased its support for languages that use <b>non-Latin</b> <b>character</b> <b>sets.</b> While Twitter, Inc. has occasionally changed the appearance of the service and added new features—often in reaction to users’ developing their own conventions, such as adding ‘#’ in front of important keywords to tag them—the basic idea behind the service has stayed the same: users may post short messages (tweets) of up to 140 characters and follow the updates posted by other users. This leads to the formation of complex follower networks with unidirectional as well as bidirectional connections between individuals, but also between media outlets, NGOs, and other organisations. While originally ‘microblogs’ were perceived as a new genre of online communication, of which Twitter was just one exemplar, the platform has become synonymous with microblogging in most countries. A notable exception is Sina Weibo, popular in China where Twitter is not available. Other similar platforms have been shut down (e. g., Jaiku), or are being used in slightly different ways (e. g., Tumblr), thus making Twitter a unique service within the social media landscape...|$|R

In the case of scripts which used 8-bit <b>character</b> <b>sets</b> with <b>non-Latin</b> <b>characters</b> encoded in the upper half (such as most Cyrillic and Greek alphabet code pages), characters in UTF-8 will be double the size. [...] For some scripts, such as Thai and Devanagari (which is used by various South Asian languages), characters will triple in size. There are even examples where a single byte turns into a composite character in Unicode and is thus six times larger in UTF-8. This has caused objections in India and other countries.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{the first}} part of this paper we report about {{experiences}} when applying the DBpedia extraction framework to the Korean Wikipedia. We improved the extraction of <b>non-Latin</b> <b>characters</b> and extended the framework with pluggable internationalization components in order to facilitate the extraction of localized information. With these improvements we almost doubled the amount of extracted triples. We also will present the results of the extraction for Korean. In the second part, we present a conceptual study aimed at understanding the impact of international resource synchronization in DBpedia. In the absence of any information synchronization, each country would construct its own datasets and manage it from its users. Moreover the cooperation across the various countries is adversely affected. Keywords: Synchronization, Wikipedia, DBpedia, Multi-lingual...|$|R

50|$|As a {{response}} to deficiencies in the Soundex algorithm, Lawrence Philips developed the Metaphone algorithm in 1990. Philips developed an improvement to Metaphone in 2000, which he called Double Metaphone. Double Metaphone includes a much larger encoding rule set than its predecessor, handles a subset of <b>non-Latin</b> <b>characters,</b> and returns a primary and a secondary encoding to account for different pronunciations of a single word in English. Philips created Metaphone 3 as a further revision in 2009 to provide a professional version that provides a much higher percentage of correct encodings for English words, non-English words familiar to Americans, and first and last names found in the United States. It also provides settings that allow more exact consonant and internal vowel matching to allow the programmer to focus the precision of matches more closely.|$|R
