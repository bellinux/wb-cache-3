5|$|By December 1942 {{there were}} {{concerns}} that even Oak Ridge {{was too close}} to a major population center (Knoxville) in the unlikely event of a major <b>nuclear</b> <b>accident.</b> Groves recruited DuPont in November 1942 to be the prime contractor for the construction of the plutonium production complex. DuPont was offered a standard cost plus fixed-fee contract, but the President of the company, Walter S. Carpenter, Jr., wanted no profit of any kind, and asked for the proposed contract to be amended to explicitly exclude the company from acquiring any patent rights. This was accepted, but for legal reasons a nominal fee of one dollar was agreed upon. After the war, DuPont asked to be released from the contract early, and had to return 33 cents.|$|E
5|$|Natural {{strontium}} is {{a mixture}} of four stable isotopes: 84Sr, 86Sr, 87Sr, and 88Sr. Their abundance increases with increasing mass number and the heaviest, 88Sr, makes up about 82.6% of all natural strontium, though the abundance varies due to the production of radiogenic 87Sr as the daughter of long-lived beta-decaying 87Rb. Of the unstable isotopes, the primary decay mode of the isotopes lighter than 85Sr is electron capture or positron emission to isotopes of rubidium, and that of the isotopes heavier than 88Sr is electron emission to isotopes of yttrium. Of special note are 89Sr and 90Sr. The former has a half-life of 50.6days and is used to treat bone cancer due to strontium's chemical similarity and hence ability to replace calcium. While 90Sr (half-life 28.90years) has been used similarly, it is also an isotope of concern in fallout from nuclear weapons and nuclear accidents due to its production as a fission product. Its presence in bones can cause bone cancer, cancer of nearby tissues, and leukemia. The 1986 Chernobyl <b>nuclear</b> <b>accident</b> contaminated about 30,000km2 with greater than 10 kBq/m2 with 90Sr, which accounts for 5% of the core inventory of 90Sr.|$|E
40|$|Between 1952 and 2011, many <b>nuclear</b> <b>accidents</b> {{transformed}} the public’s perception of nuclear power, yet there {{continues to be}} a disconnected relationship between the public’s perception of <b>nuclear</b> <b>accidents</b> and the governmental perception of <b>nuclear</b> <b>accidents.</b> In the 1950 s, <b>nuclear</b> <b>accidents</b> were quite unknown and people did not understand the negative consequences associated with such events. By 2011, <b>nuclear</b> <b>accidents</b> had become more known, and people understood the negative consequences and other implications that were associated with such events; this is also the time period where the disconnected relationship becomes more evident. The literature on <b>nuclear</b> <b>accidents</b> seems to focus largely on social, psychological and environmental scientific perspectives, but what is missing is the ethical perspective of this change in public perception. Study of the ethical perspective of this change in public perception can add to the current literature on <b>nuclear</b> <b>accidents</b> by showing that ethical thought is influenced and shaped through learning from the negative consequences of historical events. Drawing on the works of Roderick Nash and Gordon Graham, this thesis explores the ethical and historical perspectives of this change in public perception of <b>nuclear</b> <b>accidents</b> and how this change will contribute to future energy use policies. I argue that this change in the public perception of <b>nuclear</b> <b>accidents</b> stemmed from lessons learned from multiple <b>nuclear</b> <b>accidents</b> that occurred from 1952 to 2011. As the public perception of <b>nuclear</b> <b>accidents</b> changes, the disconnected relationship between the public perception and the governmental perception becomes more evident...|$|R

5|$|Arnold {{returned}} to {{working on the}} hydrogen bomb book, but 1987 was the 30th anniversary of the Windscale accident. Rather than let {{the records of the}} accident and subsequent inquiries be released over several years, Arnold persuaded the Public Records Office to release them all at once. In meetings with the various responsible government agencies, the topic of a book about Windscale came up, and Arnold decided to write one, which became Windscale 1957: Anatomy of a <b>Nuclear</b> <b>Accident</b> in 1992. Gowing, in poor health, retired from the UKAEA in 1993. By this time her two research assistants had also left, and Arnold feared that the UKAEA Council would shut down the hydrogen bomb book project, which she hoped to follow up with one on the UK civil nuclear power programme. The UKAEA Council decided to press on with the project, asking Arnold to stay on although she was now over seventy years old. In 1993, she was joined by Katherine Pyne, an aircraft engineer working on a history degree, who became her research assistant for two years. However, the end was in sight. The UKAEA no longer had responsibility for nuclear weapons, and management was not interested in it. With funds for the project almost exhausted, the UKAEA Council decided that Arnold should retire in 1996. She loaded her notes into her car and took them home. Sympathetic friends at the Ministry of Defence found some money to cover her expenses, and she doggedly worked on it from home. Britain and the H-Bomb finally appeared in 2001.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} investigated {{whether the}} Japanese people’s anxiety about {{a variety of}} hazards, including earthquakes and <b>nuclear</b> <b>accidents,</b> has changed over time since the Tohoku Earthquake in 2011. Data from three nationwide surveys conducted in 2008, 2012, and 2015 were compared to see the change in societal levels of anxiety toward 51 types of hazards. The same two-phase stratified random sampling method was used to create the list of participants in each survey. The results showed that anxiety about earthquakes and <b>nuclear</b> <b>accidents</b> had increased for a time after the Tohoku Earthquake, and then decreased after a four-year time frame with no severe earthquakes and <b>nuclear</b> <b>accidents.</b> It was also revealed that the anxiety level for some hazards other than earthquakes and <b>nuclear</b> <b>accidents</b> had decreased at ten months after the Earthquake, and then remained unchanged after the four years. Therefore, ironically, a major disaster might decrease the public anxiety in general at least for several years...|$|R
