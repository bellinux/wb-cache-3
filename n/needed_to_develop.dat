After hearing him play {{a couple of}} songs on the guitar, Bay-Schuck wanted to sign him immediately, but it took roughly three years for Atlantic records to finally sign Mars to the label, because they felt {{it was too early}} and that he still <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> as an artist.|$|E
5|$|Preparations for the counterattack {{were made}} during {{the first months of}} 1944. As the bulk of the 17th Army was {{stationed}} in northern and southern Bougainville, engineers <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> roads and bridges to allow the troops to move to the hills inland from the American perimeter. All of the units selected for the offensive had departed their bases by mid-February, and advanced along the eastern and western coasts of the island. Barges also moved artillery and other equipment to a point east of Cape Torokina; the guns and supplies were then carried overland into the hills. Only two weeks' worth of rations were assembled, however.|$|E

5|$|What Lawrence <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> {{the idea}} was capable {{graduate}} students to do the work. Edlefsen left to take up an assistant professorship in September 1930, and Lawrence replaced him with David H. Sloan and M. Stanley Livingston, who he set to work on developing Widerøe's accelerator and Edlefsen's cyclotron, respectively. Both had their own financial support. Both designs proved practical, and by May 1931, Sloan's linear accelerator was able to accelerate ions to 1 MeV. Livingston had a greater technical challenge, but when he applied 1,800V to his 11-inch cyclotron on January 2, 1931, he got 80,000-electron volt protons spinning around. A week later, he had 1.22 MeV with 3,000 V, more than enough for his PhD thesis on its construction.|$|E
5|$|As they {{evolved from}} lunged fish, {{amphibians}} {{had to make}} certain adaptations for living on land, including {{the need to develop}} new means of locomotion. In the water, the sideways thrusts of their tails had propelled them forward, but on land, quite different mechanisms were required. Their vertebral columns, limbs, limb girdles and musculature needed to be strong enough to raise them off the ground for locomotion and feeding. Terrestrial adults discarded their lateral line systems and adapted their sensory systems to receive stimuli via the medium of the air. They <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> new methods to regulate their body heat to cope with fluctuations in ambient temperature. They developed behaviours suitable for reproduction in a terrestrial environment. Their skins were exposed to harmful ultraviolet rays that had previously been absorbed by the water. The skin changed to become more protective and prevent excessive water loss.|$|E
5|$|XIV {{was first}} hinted at the 2005 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) when Square Enix {{announced}} that they were developing a new MMORPG, showing it off using a tech demo. The demo included aesthetic elements similar to XI, such as races from Vana'diel. In 2006, rumors emerged that Square Enix was developing a direct sequel to Final Fantasy XI, but further details remained unknown. During the next few years, contradictory reports were issued as to what platforms the game was being developed for: the platforms listed varied from the game being an Xbox 360 exclusive, to being for PlayStation platforms, to being for Xbox 360, PlayStation 3 (PS3) and Windows platforms. XIV was officially announced at E3 2009 for PS3, then for Windows. After its official announcement for those platforms, it was stated that a port to Microsoft hardware was under consideration. Despite negotiation with Microsoft concerning an Xbox 360 version of the game, the two companies were unable to agree upon the use of Xbox Live, as Square Enix wanted a shared server across all platforms and Microsoft would not give them the full access necessary to implement this. Because of this disagreement and the consequent extra manpower <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> a version separate from the other two platforms, development on the Xbox 360 version was stopped.|$|E

25|$|Particularly {{along the}} western coast, the local peoples had {{cultivated}} African rice for what is estimated to approach 3,000 years. African rice is a related, yet distinct species from Asian rice. It was originally domesticated in the inland delta of the Upper Niger River. Once British colonial planters in the American South discovered that African rice would grow in that region, they often sought enslaved Africans from rice-growing regions because of their skills and knowledge <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> and build irrigation, dams and earthworks.|$|E
25|$|By July 2009, {{work was}} being done on carving the headstones. A supply of the {{traditional}} Portland Stone (Broadcroft Whitbed) was reserved, and blank headstones shaped and shipped to France. Carving of the headstones was done using the Commission's computer-controlled Incisograph system. Also that month, planning and cultivation had started for the plants {{to be used in}} the new cemetery. Many months would be <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> and prune the plants in pots so they would be ready to transplant in the Spring of 2010, in preparation for the opening ceremony that July. The limited time between the planned reburials in February 2010, and the opening of the cemetery, meant that the grassed areas would need to be turfed, instead of growing the grass from seeds. The roses used are the 'Remembrance' cultivar, one often used in Commission cemeteries.|$|E
25|$|In 1980, {{the raising}} of the Operational Deployment Force, which {{required}} a battalion of the 3rd Task Force to be maintained at high readiness for deployment to the South West Pacific or Southeast Asia year-round, meant that the Army once again <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> skills necessary to operate in tropical or jungle conditions. As a result, a renewed jungle warfare training program was established. Urban development around Canungra had encroached upon the training area, though, so {{the decision was made}} to situate this training in a new establishment called the 1st Division Tropical Training Centre (later redesignated to Battle School), at Tully, Queensland. The Land Warfare Centre therefore continued to focus on individual training rather than collective training and this in part led, in March 1980, to the reduction of LWC's demonstration force, the 10th Independent Rifle Company, to just one platoon of 40 men as its manpower was redirected to meet shortages in the 3rd Task Force.|$|E

25|$|At the French {{municipal}} elections held in March 2008, several prominent mayors who are {{member of the}} Flosse-Temaru coalition lost their offices in key municipalities of French Polynesia, which was interpreted as a disapproval of the way Gaston Tong Sang, whose party French Polynesian voters had placed first in the territorial elections the month before, had been prevented from becoming president of French Polynesia by the last minute alliance between Flosse and Temaru's parties. Eventually, on 15 April 2008 the government of Gaston Flosse was toppled by a constructive vote of no confidence in the territorial assembly when {{two members of the}} Flosse-Temaru coalition left the coalition and sided with Tong Sang's party. Gaston Tong Sang was elected president of French Polynesia {{as a result of this}} constructive vote of no confidence, but his majority in the territorial assembly is very narrow. He offered posts in his cabinet to Flosse and Temaru's parties which they both refused. Gaston Tong Sang has called all parties to help end the instability in local politics, a prerequisite to attract foreign investors <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> the local economy.|$|E
25|$|The peak of Australia's form {{proved to}} be brief. The team lost a number of players to early retirement, mainly because {{remuneration}} was so poor. Chappell was able to parlay his position into a reasonable income with his Queensland contract and personal endorsements, but he still <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> business interests in life insurance outside the game. His leadership abilities were tested {{in the summer of}} 1976–77 as a number of new players were blooded and Jeff Thomson was laid low by long-term injury. Australia received much criticism for defensive play during a drawn series with Pakistan, but Chappell's form was faultless, and he scored 121 and 67 in the only Test victory. The tour to New Zealand that followed was similar; it was clear Australia was in a rebuilding phase. During the Test at Auckland, a streaker appeared when Chappell was at the crease. Incensed by this new craze and the disruption that it caused, Chappell grabbed the man and hit his bare backside with the bat. When play resumed, the ensuing din from the incident caused Chappell to mis-hear his partner's call for a run, and he found himself run out. For once, the famous Chappell concentration had been broken. But the most significant occurrence of this match occurred off-field: Chappell was approached to sign with a proposed break away competition, later to be known as World Series Cricket (WSC).|$|E
