Of course, infrastructure and acceptance network were very important, they are the factors that allowed the widespread use of cards. Currently, any <b>natural</b> person <b>or</b> <b>legal</b> <b>entity</b> is engaged in commercial relationships involving financial transactions, the electronic payments having an important role, representing virtually future transactions, both nationally and across borders. The financial institutions have made a more rapid segmentation of the portfolio of cards and began to focus increasingly on services and benefits situated behind the payment instruments. Meanwhile, cardholders were becoming more educated and sophisticated, knowing what to ask of cards. More, many financial institutions have adapted so that network to accept chip cards. On the Romanian market, the chip cards will increase which are much more effective in terms of security transactions, as well as for co-branded cards, that offers the possibility of the loyalty of the customers. They will try to get as many benefits from different types of cards, but at {{the same time}}, they will focus on niche products, business cards, cards for shopping or for payment of public services. The scientific paper aims to capture aspects that emphasize the fact that the permanent market monitoring and the continuous adaptation of it will become necessary for the next period. The current client is more demanding, more educated and less tolerant in the relation to the suppliers of any kind and especially with those of financial services. The tendency to use co-branded cards for everyday payments will increase as merchants and issuing banks will attach more and more benefits on these cards, which will ultimately increase trading volumes on the card to merchants.

5000|$|Another theory {{asserts that}} it is {{feasible}} to typify letter of credit as a collateral contract for a third-party beneficiary because three different entities participate in the transaction: the seller, the buyer, and the banker. Because letters of credit are prompted by the buyer’s necessity and in application {{of the theory of}} Jean Domat the cause of a LC is to release the buyer of his obligation to pay directly to the seller. Therefore, a LC theoretically fits as a collateral contract accepted by conduct or in other words, an implied-in-fact contract under the framework for third party beneficiary where the buyer participates as the third party beneficiary with the bank acting as the stipulator and the seller as the promisor. The term [...] "beneficiary" [...] is not used properly in the scheme of an LC because a beneficiary (also, in trust law, cestui que use) in the broadest sense is a <b>natural</b> person <b>or</b> other <b>legal</b> <b>entity</b> who receives money or other benefits from a benefactor. Note that under the scheme of letters of credit, banks are neither benefactors of sellers nor benefactors of buyers and the seller receives no money in gratuity mode. Thus is possible that a “letter of credit” was one of those contracts that needed to be masked to disguise the “consideration or privity requirement”. As a result, this kind of arrangement, would make letter of credit to be enforceable under the action assumpsit because of its promissory connotation.|$|R

Efficiency and effectiveness of the actions carried out to meet the expectations of stakeholders shall be assessed by periodic measurements and analyses accomplished with appropriate tools for each category. Obtaining favourable results following the measurement of contentment does not {{put an end to the}} process of relationships with the customers and stakeholders. Implementation of the process will reveal new expectations and requirements that, in conjunction with the ones existing in the Organization and in order to improve the activity will lead to strategies and policies that are intended to contribute to the continuous improvement of the relations with stakeholders. Thus, based on previous researches undertaken internationally and nationally, we carried out two investigations which aimed to identify the employers` needs and requirements related to the quality of skills provided by universities to the higher education graduates, and measurement of their degree of adjustment to the specified or implied requirements. In our country, the studies on employers' requirements have permanently concerned the universities. The problems identified are almost similar with those abroad, and the solutions offered by many studies have not provided the solving key but only at most an improvement of the situation. The labour market in Romania is not structured, and there is no nationwide program for its development, but nevertheless the universities must provide the workforce for the next 3, 4 or 5 years. The researches carried out for this purpose show that work experience is considered by employers as a main criterion, stronger than the grade of graduation or than the reputation of the university where they graduated from. A first research - the exploratory type – has aimed through investigation to identify the following issues: the importance placed by employers on the staff selection criteria; areas in which employers have difficulties in finding staff with higher qualifications; skills that the employers would like the University to focus on, preparing additionally the graduates in this respect, and the general level of contentment in terms of the educational services quality. A second research – both the descriptive and explanatory type – has provided information on: identifying the skills required from the higher education graduates; measuring the importance placed by employers on several groups of skills and competencies; estimating the levels of the skills achieved in some Romanian universities; contentment survey related to other services provided by the higher education institutions in Romania...|$|R
