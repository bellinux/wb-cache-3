5000|$|Sleep {{deprivation}} and learning have continually been linked together. The common {{belief is that}} sleep deprivation can affect children when they are learning at school or in any daily task. However, different types of learning are processed differently and have different outcomes {{when a child is}} sleep deprived. A study conducted by Csabi, Benedk, Janacesk, Katona and Nemeth looked at the impairment of declarative and <b>nondeclarative</b> <b>learning</b> when a child is sleep deprived. <b>Nondeclarative</b> <b>learning</b> was measured by having children perform an Alternating Serial Reaction Time (ASRT) task. This task had a dog's head appear in four empty circles. Every time the dog's head appeared the child had to press the corresponding letter as quickly and correctly as possible. Declarative learning was measured by [...] "The War of the Ghosts" [...] test, which is a recall test where the children were told a short story consisting of thirty-six sentences and had to then recall it immediately after hearing it. The study showed that <b>nondeclarative</b> <b>learning</b> was preserved and not affected when sleep deprived children took the ASRT task. However, declarative learning greatly declined in the face of sleep-deprivation. Declarative Learning can be associated with tasks that require a greater amount of attention, such as learning in school. Therefore, the lack of sleep a child obtains can affect declarative learning and can affect how well a child learns during school overall.|$|E
50|$|From {{that point}} forward, Dr. Corkin {{directed}} the Behavioral Neuroscience Laboratory, making seminal contributions to many different domains of cognitive neuroscience. These contributions included further delineation of memory systems required for {{different forms of}} <b>nondeclarative</b> <b>learning,</b> elucidation of memory deficits that arise in Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and contributions toward theoretical debates regarding {{the role of the}} medial temporal lobe in the retrieval of remote memories.|$|E
40|$|Patients with Huntington's Disease (HD) {{were tested}} on 2 tasks, {{probabilistic}} classification learning and artificial grammar learning. Both tasks are performed normally by amnesic patients and {{are considered to}} be independent of declarative memory. Patients with HD were severely impaired in probabilistic learning but performed normally in artificial grammar learning. The probabilistic classification task may be akin to habit-learning tasks that depend on the neostriatum, whereas artificial grammar learning may depend on changes within neocortex similar to what is thought to occur in perceptual priming. The deficit in the probabilistic classification task indicates that impaired <b>nondeclarative</b> <b>learning</b> in patients with HD occurs not only in motor tasks but also in <b>nondeclarative</b> <b>learning</b> tasks that have no motor component. Huntington's disease (HD) is an inherited progressive neurological disorder that is characterized by involuntary, choreiform movements, affective disturbance, and progressive cognitive and functional decline. The primary neuropathology is loss of cells in the caudate nucleus and the putamen (Vonsattel et al., 1985), although there is eventually mor...|$|E
40|$|This article reviews {{recent studies}} of memory systems in humans and nonhuman primates. Three major {{conclusions}} from recent work are that (i) the capacity for <b>nondeclarative</b> (nonconscious) <b>learning</b> can now be studied in {{a broad array of}} tasks that assess classification learning, perceptuomotor skill learning, artificial grammar learning, and prototype abstraction; (ii) cortical areas adjacent to the hippocampal formation, including entorhinal, perirhinal, and parahippocampal cortices, are {{an essential part of the}} medial temporal lobe memory system that supports declarative (conscious) memory; and (iii) in humans, bilateral damage limited to the hippocampal formation is nevertheless sufficient to produce severe anterograde amnesia and temporally graded retrograde amnesia covering as much as 25 years...|$|R
40|$|There {{is often}} little {{correspondence}} between {{human and animal}} examples of nondeclarative memory. The serial reaction time task (SRT) is a sequence learning example of human nondeclarative memory that may be suitable for development as an animal model. The SRT {{is believed to be}} impaired by basal ganglia, not limbic system damage, but there is uncertainty whether limbic system pathology does in fact leave the SRT unimpaired. We therefore developed a new rat model that closely approximated the human SRT, using intracranial self-stimulation to promote rapid continuous responding to four adjacent nose pokes in a single test session. Intact rats that experienced repeated sequences demonstrated robust interference effects when switched to a random sequence of cued responses (at 4 -, 8 -, and 12 -sequence lengths), unlike intact controls that experienced the random sequences only. The interference effect in the human task is a key measure for <b>nondeclarative</b> sequence <b>learning.</b> Rats with dorsal caudate lesions that experienced massed sequence repetitions showed an interference effect at the four-sequence length only. By contrast, rats with dorsal hippocampal lesions showed an interference effect at all sequence lengths. This new rat SRT model clarifies the basal ganglia–limbic system dichotomy suggested by human work. Key words: declarative memory; nondeclarative memory; procedural memory; multiple-memory systems; sequence learning; caudate; hippocampus; lesion; rat; serial reaction time task; intracranial self-stimulatio...|$|R
40|$|Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) {{have been}} shown to be {{impaired}} on some nondeclarative memory tasks that require cognitive skill learning (perceptual-motor sequence learning, probabilistic classification). To determine what other skill-based tasks are impaired, 13 patients with PD were tested on artificial grammar learning, artificial grammar learning with transfer to novel lettersets, and prototype learning. Patients with PD performed similarly to controls on all 3 tests. The intact learning exhibited by PD patients on these tests suggests that <b>nondeclarative</b> cognitive skill <b>learning</b> is not a single entity supported by the neostriatum. If learning the regularities among visual stimuli is the principal feature of artificial grammar learning and prototype learning, then these forms of skill learning may be examples of perceptual learning, and they may occur in early visual cortical processing areas. A number of cognitive skill learning tasks are known to depend on nondeclarative memory, that is, memory systems outside the medial temporal lobe memory system and diencephalic structures that are important for declarative memory (Squire, Knowlton, & Musen, 1993; Squire & Zola...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{investigated the}} nature of interactions between multiple memory systems (MMS) in the human brain during probabilistic learning. How MMS interact in the brain is highly debated in the literature, with evidence supporting competition, cooperation, and parallel engagement observed across several species and various experimental paradigms (e. g., Poldrack et al., 2001; Poldrack and Rodriguez, 2004; Voermans et al., 2004; White and McDonald, 2002). In this dissertation, three functional neuroimaging experiments investigated {{the relationship between the}} medial temporal lobes (MTL), implicated in declarative learning, and the basal ganglia (BG), involved in <b>nondeclarative</b> <b>learning,</b> during probabilistic learning. Specifically, tasks which varied with respect to learning type (feedback, akin to <b>nondeclarative</b> <b>learning</b> and observation akin to declarative learning) and cue difficulty (e. g., easy, hard) were employed. Based on the evolutionary theory of MMS, neuroanatomical connections between these regions, as well as connectivity with midbrain dopaminergic centers involved in reward, memory, and reinforcement learning, i...|$|E
40|$|Different {{forms of}} <b>nondeclarative</b> <b>learning</b> involve {{regionally}} specific striatal circuits. The motor circuit (involving the putamen) {{has been associated}} with motor–skill learning and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) circuit (involving the caudate) {{has been associated with}} cognitive–habit learning. Efforts to differentiate functional striatal circuits within patient samples have been limited. Previous studies have provided mixed results regarding striatal-dependent <b>nondeclarative</b> <b>learning</b> deficits in patients with schizophrenia. In this study, a cognitive–habit learning task (probabilistic weather prediction) was used to assess the DLPFC circuit and a motor–skill learning task (pursuit rotor) was used to assess the motor circuit in 35 patients with schizophrenia and 35 normal controls. Patients with schizophrenia displayed significant performance differences from controls on both nondeclarative tasks; however, cognitive–habit learning rate in patients did not differ from controls. There were performance and learning-rate differences on the motor–skill learning task between the whole sample of patients and controls, however, analysis of a subset of patients and controls matched on general intellectual level eliminated learning rate differences between groups. The abnormal performance offset between patients with schizophrenia and controls in the absence of learning rate differences suggests that abnormal cortical processing provides altered input to normal striatal circuitry...|$|E
40|$|The neural {{underpinnings}} of prototype learning {{are not well}} understood. A major source of confusion is that {{two versions of the}} prototype learning task have been used interchangeably in the literature; one where participants learn to categorize exemplars derived from two prototypes (A/B task), and one where participants learn to categorize exemplars derived from one prototype and noncategorical exemplars (A/non-A). We report results from an fMRI study of A/B and A/non-A prototype learning that allows for a direct contrast of the two learning methods. Accuracy in the two tasks did not correlate within subject despite equivalent average difficulty. The fMRI results revealed neural activation in a network of regions consistent with episodic memory retrieval for the A/B task while greater activation of a <b>nondeclarative</b> <b>learning</b> network was observed for the A/non-A task. The results demonstrate that learning in these two tasks is mediated by different neural systems and that recruitment of each system is dictated by the context of learning rather than the actua...|$|E
40|$|Declarative or {{explicit}} memory refers to those facts or events {{of which we}} are consciously aware and includes semantic knowledge and episodic (autobiographical) memory. Other aspects of past experience may influence behavior without conscious recollection (e. g., Jacoby & Dallas, 1981). These nondeclarative or implicit forms of learning and memory are generally characterized as ac-quired fluency of perceptual and motor performance (e. g., Roediger, 1990). Nondeclarative memory reveals itself in habits, procedural knowledge, perceptual priming, simple sequence learning, single-discriminant forms of classical and operant conditioning, and path-based route learning (for reviews, see Eichenbaum, 1999 b; Mosco-vitch, 2000). One of the most convincing demonstrations that <b>nondeclarative</b> <b>learning</b> and memory are indepen-dent of declarative memories is that declarative memory may be substantially impaired without corresponding impairments of nondeclarative memory. That is, whereas damage to part or all of the hippocampal system (hip-pocampus, amygdala, parahippocampal cortices) results in anterograde amnesia, which is an inability to acquire new declarative memories, performance on nondeclara-tive tasks is normal or near normal (for reviews, see Mil...|$|E
