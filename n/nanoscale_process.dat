30|$|In {{order to}} {{overcome}} the mentioned issues above, a nano-watt MOSFET-based resistorless subthreshold voltage reference with high PSRR is proposed in this brief, which is suitable for advanced technology, such as <b>nanoscale</b> <b>process.</b> A self-biased MOSFET voltage divider for PSRR enhancement is adopted in the proposed voltage reference, which can generate a positive temperature coefficient (TC) current containing threshold voltage characteristics. The current serves as bias currents for the whole voltage reference. Besides, the threshold voltage embedded in the bias current is reproduced by injecting bias current into MOSFET with different threshold voltages in the paper. With the proposed method, a delta threshold voltage (∆VTH) with greatly reduced negative TC is obtained. Besides, a weighted proportional to absolute temperature (PTAT) item is also obtained, while a weighted sum of ∆VTH and PTAT voltage is realized at the same time. Due to the mutual TC cancelation of two different threshold voltages, the required PTAT voltage can be greatly reduced for temperature compensation. By this method, a MOSFET-only resistorless voltage reference is achieved by a compacted structure with low power consumption.|$|E
30|$|Most importantly, {{semiconductor}} ZnS nanowire probe replacing common metal probe {{has been}} also successfully applied for manipulating low-melting point metals and ultrathin metal nanowires. Referring to welding of ultrathin Au nanowires, atomic diffusion and surface relaxation are {{obvious in the}} aforementioned <b>nanoscale</b> <b>process</b> [24 – 26]. It is well recognized that the diffusion barrier for a single metal atom on the ultrathin metal surface is quite low (typically less than 1 eV) [27]. Thermal activation, even at room temperature, is enough to overcome such low barriers, so isolated metal atoms can diffuse rapidly by means of surface diffusion. The mechanical manipulation can clearly provide the necessarily extra driving force to facilitate the cold welding and unification of two nanowires. Additionally, because of low-melting point metals and ultrathin metal nanowires, current flowing through nanostructured metals faces a major problem that the nano-objects can be structurally and functionally damaged due to atom migration due to Joule heating and electromigration [28, 29]. Here, we innovatively have developed the nano-probes of semiconductor nanowires and excellently solved these mentioned problems.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—For implantable neural {{interface}} applications, it {{is important}} to compress data and analyze spike patterns across multiple channels in real time. Such a computational task for online neural data processing requires an innovative circuit-architecture level design approach for low-power, robust and area-efficient hardware implementation. Conventional mi-croprocessor or Digital Signal Processing (DSP) chips would dissipate too much power and are too large in size for an implantable system. In this paper, we propose a novel hardware design approach, referred to as “Preferential Design ” that exploits the nature of the neural signal processing algorithm to achieve a low-voltage, robust and area-efficient implementation using <b>nanoscale</b> <b>process</b> technology. The basic idea is to isolate the critical components with respect to system performance and design them more conservatively compared to the noncritical ones. This allows aggressive voltage scaling for low power op-eration while ensuring robustness and area efficiency. We have applied the proposed approach to a neural signal processing algorithm using the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) and observed significant improvement in power and robustness over conventional design.

40|$|The {{video of}} a growing {{fullerene}} within a carbon nanotube, initiated by a tungsten catalyst, provides a dramatic realization of a complex <b>nanoscale</b> <b>process.</b> While there may be many detailed models which can account for this growth, we propose one of the simplest possible models {{which is consistent with}} the major observed features of the growth process. In particular, we assume that the fullerene is immersed in a carbon vapor environment, and that the growth occurs {{as a consequence of the}} diffusion of the carbon vapor into the fullerene. Moreover, we assume that the classical diffusion equation applies in the region exterior to the fullerene and that a standard Stefan condition applies at the moving fullerene surface. We assume that the gaseous medium through which the carbon atoms diffuse is represented through the value of the diffusion coefficient D appearing in the classical diffusion equation. We also assume that the influence of the catalyst is felt through the value of the constant alpha appearing in the Stefan condition. Based on these assumptions, we derive simple similarity solutions for both spherical and ellipsoidal fullerenes which are entirely consistent with the observations. A corresponding analysis is provided for the longitudinal growth of a carbon nanotube. J. E. Bunder and James M. Hil...|$|E
40|$|Bubble {{chambers}} and droplet detectors used in dosimetry and dark matter particle search experiments use a superheated metastable liquid in which nuclear recoils trigger bubble nucleation. This process {{is described by}} the classical heat spike model of F. Seitz [Phys. Fluids (1958 - 1988) 1, 2 (1958) ], which uses classical nucleation theory to estimate the amount and the localization of the deposited energy required for bubble formation. Here we report on direct molecular dynamics simulations of heat-spike-induced bubble formation. They allow us to test the <b>nanoscale</b> <b>process</b> described in the classical heat spike model. 40 simulations were performed, each containing about 20 million atoms, which interact by a truncated force-shifted Lennard-Jones potential. We find that the energy per length unit needed for bubble nucleation agrees quite well with theoretical predictions, but the allowed spike length and the required total energy are about {{twice as large as}} predicted. This could be explained by the rapid energy diffusion measured in the simulation: contrary to the assumption in the classical model, we observe significantly faster heat diffusion than the bubble formation time scale. Finally we examine α-particle tracks, which are much longer than those of neutrons and potential dark matter particles. Empirically, α events were recently found to result in louder acoustic signals than neutron events. This distinction is crucial for the background rejection in dark matter searches. We show {{that a large number of}} individual bubbles can form along an α track, which explains the observed larger acoustic amplitudes. Comment: 7 pages, 5 figures, accepted for publication in Phys.

While <b>nanoscale</b> <b>processes</b> involving simple two-electron transfer reactions such as enzymatic microbial U(VI) reduction results in biogenic UO 2 formation, mesoscale processes involving minerals and U(VI) are a step up in complexity and have shown varying results ranging from partial uranium reduction to the formation of mixed U(IV) /U(V) species. Although nano- and meso-scale biogeochemical processes have been helpful in predicting the contaminant dynamics at the meter scale, their occurrence is not necessarily apparent in soils and aquifers given the enormous volume of contaminated groundwater to be remediated, among other factors. The formation and long-term stability of biologically reduced uranium at the meter scale is also determined in addition by the complex interplay of aqueous geochemistry, hydrology, soil and sediment mineralogy and microbial community dynamics. For instance, indigenous subsurface microbes often encounter multiple electron acceptors in heterogeneous environments during biostimulation and can catalyze the formation of various reactive biogenic minerals. In such cases, abiotic interactions between U(VI) and reactive biogenic minerals is potentially important because the success of a remediation strategy is contingent upon the speciation of reduced uranium.
