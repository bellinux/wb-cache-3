5|$|In {{works from}} Jeux vénitiens, Lutosławski wrote long {{passages}} {{in which the}} parts of the ensemble are not to be synchronised exactly. At cues from the conductor each instrumentalist may be instructed to move straight on to the next section, to finish their current section before moving on, or to stop. In this way the random elements within compositionally controlled limits defined by the term aleatory are carefully directed by the composer, who controls the architecture and harmonic progression of the piece precisely. Lutosławski notated the music exactly; there is no improvisation, no choice of parts is given to any instrumentalist, and there is thus <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>about</b> how the musical performance is to be realised.|$|E

5|$|Randall left <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>about</b> his sympathies when he {{assigned}} {{members to}} the committee, stacking it with Hayes's enemies from both parties. The committee's investigation had {{the opposite of the}} Democrats' intended effect, uncovering telegrams from Tilden's nephew, William Tilden Pelton, offering bribes to Southern Republicans in the disputed states to help Tilden claim their votes. The Pelton telegrams were in code, which the committee was able to decode; Republicans had also sent ciphered dispatches, but the committee was unable to decode them. The ensuing excitement fizzled out by June 1878 as the Congress went into recess.|$|E
5|$|While the {{persecution}} under Constantius was relatively light, there is <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>about</b> {{the force of}} {{the persecution}} in Maximian's domain. Its effects are recorded at Rome, Sicily, Spain, and in Africaindeed, Maximian encouraged particularly strict enforcement of the edict in Africa. Africa's political elite were insistent that the persecution be fulfilled, and Africa's Christians, especially in Numidia, were equally insistent on resisting them. For the Numidians, to hand over scriptures was an act of terrible apostasy. Africa had long been home to the Church of the Martyrsin Africa, martyrs held more religious authority than the clergyand harbored a particularly intransigent, fanatical, and legalistic variety of Christianity. It was Africa that gave the West most of its martyrdoms.|$|E
25|$|Puglisi's murder shocked Italy. There was an {{immediate}} call by eight priests in Palermo for the pope to travel to Palermo to be present at his funeral. Pope John Paul II, however, {{was scheduled to be}} in Tuscany on that date and did not attend the memorial service. At the funeral Mass the archbishop of Palermo, Cardinal Salvatore Pappalardo, carefully avoided indicating the Mafia as the suspects in Puglisi's murder, although many had <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>about</b> Cosa Nostra's involvement.|$|E

25|$|After lengthy {{psychiatric}} {{and psychological}} assessments of Dahlgren's mental state, which concluded {{that he was}} sane, the police officially closed the investigation on 21 March 2016 and recommended the State Attorney indict Dahlgren. The investigators claimed that there was <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>about</b> Dahlgren committing the murders; however, they failed to establish a motive. State Attorney Ludmila Doležalová subsequently indicted Dahlgren in April 2016. The case fell {{into the hands of}} judge Michal Zámečník, who will be presiding a panel consisting of himself and two lay judges. Dahlgren chose to remain silent during the investigation as well as during most of the court hearings.|$|E
25|$|The Dacians {{knew about}} writing. Permanent {{contacts}} with the Graeco-Roman world had brought {{the use of the}} Greek and later the Latin alphabet. It is also certainly not the case that writing with Greek and Latin letters and knowledge of Greek and Latin were known in all the settlements scattered throughout Dacia, but there is <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>about</b> the existence of such knowledge in some circles of Dacian society. However, the most revealing discoveries concerning the use of the writing by the Dacians occurred in the citadels on the Sebes mountains. Some groups of letters from stone blocks at Sarmisegetuza might express personal names; these can not now be read because the wall is ruined, and because it is impossible to restore the original order of the blocks in the wall.|$|E

25|$|Peckford's assertions have, in turn, been {{challenged}} by Howard Leeson, {{who was then}} the Saskatchewan Deputy Minister for Intergovernmental Affairs and present during all of the negotiations that night. He claimed that, while the officials did work from Newfoundland's draft, it was only because it was largely similar to the Kitchen Accord, which had already been developed and agreed to by the governments of Ontario and Saskatchewan and was known to the federal government. Further, Peckford played only a minor role that evening, entering later, with the majority of the negotiating being done by Blakeney and Davis. Leeson concluded that Davis and Lougheed were the most important players in securing an agreement. In his opinion, the presence in the National Archives of Canada of the Kitchen Accord leaves <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>about</b> its existence {{and it was one of}} several crucial linkages in the patriation negotiations.|$|E
25|$|This {{branch of}} the family was {{maintained}} in their nobility by judgments dated 3 September 1666, by Mr. Dupuy (or du Puy), subdelegate of Claude Pellot, Intendant of Guyenne in Bordeaux, 20 June 1696 by Claude Bazin de Bezons, also the Intendant of Guyenne in Bordeaux, and, lastly by a judgment of the Conseil d'État rendered 29 June 1787 {{in the presence of}} the King. These three judgments leave <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>about</b> the origins of the branch, in that the family's nobility and filiation was legally established going back to Jean de Forcade, who was qualified as noble, Squire and Governor of the Château d'Auvillar in his marriage contract dated 29 April 1554. The 3 September 1666 judgment further confirms that Philippe de La Forcade, sieur de La Prade, was a squire, a captain in the infantry, that his father had been one of the Henry IV of France's bodyguards, that his grandfather had been Governor of the Château d'Auvillar and that they descended from the noble house of Forcade in Orthez, in Béarn.|$|E
25|$|Elizabeth Graeme married Henry Fergusson on April 21, 1772 {{without her}} father's consent. This caused quite {{a problem for}} the newlyweds. Henry and Elizabeth had been {{introduced}} to each other by Dr. Benjamin Rush, a founding father of Pennsylvania, on December 7, 1771 at one of the salons hosted by Elizabeth and Dr. Graeme. Fergusson was a recent and penniless Scottish Immigrant and he was eleven years younger than Elizabeth. Both of these qualities made him a less than ideal suitor for Elizabeth's hand in marriage and Dr. Graeme forbade that they marry. Four months after they met, Henry and Elizabeth married secretly in Old Swede's Church. Only their close friends attended, including Benjamin Rush, Provost William Smith and his wife. Despite her father's disapproval, Elizabeth had vowed to let her marriage be known. Ironically, the day on which she decided to tell him the news was the day that he suffered his fatal heart attack, with Elizabeth watching him approach Graeme Park through a window of the mansion. Elizabeth was never able to tell of her marriage. She was Dr. Graeme's only living heir, she inherited Graeme Park and by right of marriage Henry Fergusson gained title to the property. With his sudden new fortune Henry Fergusson was able to quickly ascend the Philadelphia society ladder. He traveled to England twice, became director of a prominent Philadelphia library and was awarded the title magistrate in Philadelphia. He was the last magistrate of Philadelphia under British colonial rule. He sailed once more for England in late 1775 just as the American Revolution was beginning to gather steam. He returned to Philadelphia by way of New York City as a loyalist with Sir William Howe commander of the British forces in American. With Howe, Fergusson witnessed the Battle of Brandywine and the occupation of Philadelphia during the Philadelphia campaign. Fergusson involved his wife in his activities by sending her as a messenger to General George Washington to ask for his surrender and to present a bribe to a major in the Continental Army. Both of these incidents caused the Patriots of Philadelphia to doubt her loyalty. There was <b>no</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>about</b> where Henry Fergusson's loyalties lay. He was found a traitor by the Supreme Executive Council of Pennsylvania and Graeme Park was seized under the Confiscation Act of 1778.|$|E
