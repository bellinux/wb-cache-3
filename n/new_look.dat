When it became the Indianapolis Public Transportation Corporation (adopting the Metro name) in 1975, the <b>New</b> <b>Looks</b> would become the workhorse of the fleet, with the agency adding AM General, GM's RTS-II series, GMDD Canada <b>New</b> <b>Looks,</b> and Orion I to the lineup as the <b>New</b> <b>Looks</b> were starting to show its age by the mid-1990s.

In the days after the vote was announced, Guerra sought to appoint Rodriguez as a special prosecutor in the Garza case. Rodriguez declined, saying that he preferred to take a <b>new</b> <b>look</b> at the evidence once he took control of the district attorney's office in January 2015. In April, he announced that the Garza case was open again. Without mentioning any suspects or elaborating on new evidence, he said that several employees in his office were working on the case.|$|E

5|$|By {{the late}} 1880s, there were {{increasing}} {{calls for the}} replacement of the Seated Liberty design, used since the 1830s on most denominations of silver coins. In 1891, Mint Director Edward O. Leech, having been authorized by Congress to approve coin redesigns, ordered a competition, seeking a <b>new</b> <b>look</b> for the silver coins. As only the winner would receive a cash prize, invited artists refused to participate and no entry from the public proved suitable. Leech instructed Barber to prepare new designs for the dime, quarter, and half dollar, and after the chief engraver made changes to secure Leech's endorsement, they were approved by President Benjamin Harrison in November 1891. Striking of the new coins began the following January.|$|E
5|$|Gilly {{was later}} seen using his <b>new</b> <b>look</b> {{in attempt to}} get the {{affections}} of Steph Cunningham (Carley Stenson). After failing he acted out of character and struck up a scam date with Cheryl Brady (Bronagh Waugh) to make Steph jealous but it back-fired when his false tooth came loose in Cheryl's mouth. He later has relationships with Cheryl and Jem Costello (Helen Russell-Clark). Another change implemented during this period was a dramatic change to the character's appearance after new series producer Lucy Allan and Quinlan came to a mutual decision to transform his hairstyle by shaving it all off, a stark contrast as during his early years he was constantly seen with long hair.|$|E
50|$|Lately, she {{has decided}} that since {{she does not know}} her birth parents, she has no real identity.

5000|$|Because of new FMCSA regulations, three roof {{head and}} tail lights, {{commonly}} called [...] "Michigan markers", were added as standard equipment (they had been optional on first- and second-generation <b>New</b> <b>Looks).</b> First-generation <b>New</b> <b>Looks</b> had these lights {{installed in a}} roof-mounted bracket, called [...] "Manhattan style"; thereafter each light was mounted directly on roof.|$|R

5|$|In {{contrast}} to the critical acclaim, players' response to the game remained deeply mixed over the cel-shaded design. Reception was comparatively warm in Japan, where various media commonly borrow an anime aesthetic, but was much more divided in North America. Some players appreciated the design and Miyamoto's vision for the game, but others criticized the choice. These fans felt that the new design {{was too much of}} a change from the more realistic designs of previous games, and found the <b>new</b> <b>look</b> childish. According to Stephen Totilo of Kotaku, much of the backlash came from a contemporary anxiety among fans that Nintendo was losing its edge by focusing on games for children, as opposed to the more mature, realistic fare developed by competitors.|$|E
5|$|The first buses {{operated}} by GO Transit, a suburban {{variant of the}} GM <b>New</b> <b>Look</b> bus, were unveiled at Queen's Park on August 11, 1970, about a month before commencing operations on its expanded services east, west and north of Toronto. Operated by Gray Coach, a pilot program to test them was conducted in Pickering before they entered service on 8 September 1970. Later buses included a combination of single-door, suburban-type transit buses built by Orion Bus Industries and New Flyer, and single-level highway coaches built by Prevost Car and Motor Coach Industries (MCI, now a subsidiary of New Flyer).|$|E
5|$|The {{other major}} {{influence}} was the Gaia hypothesis, that the Earth {{is a single}} living system that self-regulates to maintain the optimum conditions for life, formulated by climate scientist James Lovelock and popularised in his 1979 book Gaia: A <b>new</b> <b>look</b> at life on Earth. Kennedy Martin used the name GAIA for the environmental organisation Emma Craven was involved in and drew the notion for the black flowers seen at the serial's conclusion from a passage in Lovelock's book that describes a dark marsh grass that grew {{on the surface of}} the Earth trapping heat during a time when the planet was too cold to sustain life, simulated in Lovelock's Daisyworld model.|$|E

5|$|Wise asked Harold Michelson {{to be the}} film's {{production}} designer, and Michelson was put to work on {{finishing the}} incomplete Phase II sets. The designer began with the bridge, which had nearly been completed. Michelson first removed Chekov's new weapons station, a semicircular plastic bubble grafted onto {{one side of the}} bridge wall. The idea for Phase II was that Chekov would have looked out toward space while crosshairs in the bubble tracked targets. Wise instead wanted Chekov's station to face the Enterprises main viewer, a difficult request as the set was primarily circular. Production illustrator Michael Minor created a <b>new</b> <b>look</b> for the station using a flat edge {{in the corner of the}} set.|$|E
5|$|After {{his success}} at Zaragoza, {{the team was}} in need of money, as a result, Villa made his big move to one of Spanish football's heavyweights, as a <b>new</b> <b>look</b> Valencia under Quique Sánchez Flores parted with €12million to secure his {{services}} in the summer of 2005. During his first game in a Valencia shirt, an Intertoto Cup match against Belgian outfit Gent, Villa scored the first goal in a game which Valencia won 2–0. He made his league debut for Valencia coming on as a substitute against Real Betis in a 1–0 win on 27 August 2005. The next match would see his previous team, Zaragoza, leading 2–1 {{for the majority of the}} match; however, on the 81st minute, Villa came on as a late substitute for Rubén Baraja and scored the equalizer within the space of a minute, earning Valencia a point in a 2–2 draw.|$|E
5|$|After {{the death}} of Charles Ritz in 1976, the hotel went into a period of slow decline. As it lost its luster, its {{clientele}} diminished, {{and for the first}} time in its existence it began to lose money. It was rescued, however, in 1979 by an Egyptian businessman, Mohamed Al-Fayed, who purchased the hotel for $20million and installed a new managing director, Frank Klein. Klein in turn put Guy Legay, the former chef of the three-star Ledoyen, in charge of the kitchen. Al-Fayed renovated it completely over several years without stopping its operation; this was achieved by annexing two town houses, joined by an arcade with many of Paris's leading boutiques. The renovation of the hotel was headed by the architect Bernard Gaucherel from 1980 to 1987. The entire ten-year renovation cost a total of $250million. The restaurants were given a <b>new</b> <b>look,</b> and a swimming pool, health club, and spas were created in the basement. The Little Bar was renamed the Hemingway Bar. In 1988 the Ritz-Escoffier School of French Gastronomy was established in honour of Auguste Escoffier.|$|E

5|$|Sheridan Drive was {{constructed}} during the early1920s as {{a town of}} Tonawanda project to help alleviate the anticipated growth of the village of Kenmore. Despite its construction, the new road was not without controversy. During construction, new traffic lights were put in with concrete supports were opposed heavily by the town of Tonawanda and its residents, resulting in the traffic lights not having been built for many years. The town also felt that {{the construction of a}} superhighway {{in the middle of the}} country in Tonawanda was unjustified with the average traffic in that area. After construction of Sheridan Drive was completed in 1925, a monument with a statue of General Phillip Sheridan {{was constructed}} to commemorate the new road. However, the taxpayers feeling enough money had already been spent on the road, the statue of Sheridan was never constructed and only the monument to the road's construction was completed. In order to give the road a <b>new</b> <b>look,</b> the road had large trees planted throughout what was considered a desolate area at the time.|$|E
5|$|Within the town, {{the four}} major UK {{supermarkets}} can be found - Tesco, Sainsbury's, Morrisons and a small Asda near the town centre. There is also an M Simply Food on the high street. The northern part of Northallerton is a developing area in retail with a B, Carpet Right and the town's industrial estate and business parks. Homebase ceased trading in May 2015 due to being unprofitable. It was also announced that B will cease trading in 2016 {{at the end of}} the current lease on the site, also due to not being profitable. The long High Street provides a wide variety of shops, restaurants, pubs and cafes. There are national retailers such as Costa Coffee (who also have another outlet in Tesco), Pizza Express, <b>New</b> <b>Look,</b> Fat Face, Wilko (who occupy the former Woolworth's premises), Waterstones, Vodafone and Claire's alongside local independent or regional retailers; Betty's tearooms, Lewis & Cooper, Barker's Department Store and Boyes.

5|$|Animals {{eventually}} follow Evan to Congress. When Long discovers this, {{he allows}} Evan latitude at first, but warns {{him that he}} will no longer tolerate it if it happens again in the future. Meanwhile, Evan's staffers are outraged by his change of appearance and behavior. When Evan returns to the ark during construction, God presents him with a robe, and later tells Evan that the flood will likely come at mid-day on September 22. When Joan becomes suspicious of his behavior, Evan tells her the truth: God has been talking to him and is responsible for his <b>new</b> <b>look</b> and recent actions, although Joan does not believe Evan and is convinced that he is beginning to lose his mind. After wearing the robe for some time, Evan finds it comfortable, but he soon realizes that God will not allow him {{to take it off}} and wear anything else after two failed attempts to change his clothes later. The next time Evan arrives at Congress for work, animals follow him once again and he is mysteriously changed into his robe halfway through the session. Evan reluctantly explains his divine mission, although Long does not take him seriously, and Evan is fired from Congress and later removed his name from the Public Land Act bill. Evan deduces that God purposely had him fired from Congress, so that he would have more time to build the ark. In continued skepticism, Joan leaves Evan alone after believing that he was going insane.|$|E
