Optical aids are allowed {{as long as}} they are not mounted on the pistol, which may only have open sights. Ear protection is recommended by the ISSF as well as by coaches, who sometimes stress their usefulness in shutting out distracting noise rather than their <b>necessity</b> <b>for</b> safety reasons (paramount in other shooting disciplines).|$|E

5|$|Acting on {{a report}} in January 2009, the city council {{recommended}} that B of the Bang should be dismantled and placed in storage until funds could be raised for its safe reinstatement. The report recognised the sculpture's aesthetic value for Manchester and Manchester City Council committed itself to working with the artist to reach a long-term solution. One possibility involved {{the replacement of the}} steel spikes with alternatives made from carbon fibre, although the report underlined the <b>necessity</b> <b>for</b> extensive testing.|$|E

5|$|After {{a period}} of rest and recovery, Zita found herself {{regularly}} going back to Europe for the weddings of her children. She decided {{to move back to}} the continent full-time, in 1952, to Luxembourg, in order to look after her aging mother. Maria Antonia {{died at the age of}} 96 in 1959. The bishop of Chur proposed to Zita that she move into a residence that he administered (formerly a castle of the Counts de Salis) at Zizers, Graubünden in Switzerland. As the castle had enough space for visits from her large family and a nearby chapel (a <b>necessity</b> <b>for</b> the devoutly Catholic Zita), she accepted with ease.|$|E
5|$|As {{the initial}} {{usage of the}} Cunard Building was mixed, {{there are a variety}} of {{features}} within the building that reflect the original purposes of different areas within. Initially, Cunard's administration facilities were located on the upper floors and due to the <b>necessity</b> <b>for</b> large amounts of light in the design facilities, these rooms where developed to include both toplights in the roof and also large windows to maximise the amount of natural light. Another feature are the high quality ornate fittings that are present in what would have been the former first class passenger lounge, which is located on the first floor. These fitting are also in the former board room, which is located in a 'commanding' position on the fifth floor, overlooking the river below.|$|E
5|$|Butterflies are {{distributed}} worldwide except Antarctica, totalling some 18,500 species. Of these, 775 are Nearctic; 7,700 Neotropical; 1,575 Palearctic; 3,650 Afrotropical; and 4,800 {{are distributed}} across the combined Oriental and Australian/Oceania regions. The monarch butterfly {{is native to}} the Americas, but {{in the nineteenth century}} or before, spread across the world, and is now found in Australia, New Zealand, other parts of Oceania, and the Iberian Peninsula. It is not clear how it dispersed; adults may have been blown by the wind or larvae or pupae may have been accidentally transported by humans, but the presence of suitable host plants in their new environment was a <b>necessity</b> <b>for</b> their successful establishment.|$|E

5|$|During his {{period in}} Berlin, {{he came in}} contact with and was greatly {{influenced}} by Friedrich Carl von Savigny, Alexander von Humboldt, Eduard Gans, and especially Professor Leopold von Ranke, whose ideas on the <b>necessity</b> <b>for</b> politicians to be acquainted with historical science he readily adopted. In pages he dedicated to the influence exercised by Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel on Romanian thought, Tudor Vianu noted that certain Hegelian-related principles were a common attribute of the Berlin faculty during Kogălniceanu's stay. He commented that, in later years, the politician adopted views which resonated with those of Hegel, most notably the principle that legislation needed to adapt to the individual spirit of nations.|$|E
5|$|From the 1890s onwards, Muller had {{published}} with great regularity {{about the importance}} of a proper Dutch consular service to promote the Dutch mercantile interests around the world. In his articles he forcefully advanced the idea that the consular and diplomatic services should be merged and professionalised. In his publications Muller also strongly propagated a more active role of the Netherlands in international affairs. In this vain, in 1919, he published an article on the history and geography of Spitsbergen (Svalbard) and the <b>necessity</b> <b>for</b> the Dutch government to defend its historic claims on the islands. A year later, the Dutch government became a signatory to the Spitsbergen Treaty.|$|E
5|$|General praise went to {{the variety}} of choice in its {{narrative}} and gameplay, despite the former being seen as lacking in places and the latter being held back by other {{factors such as the}} limitations of the Biomod upgrade system and its limited environment sizes. Poor AI behavior was also a recurring criticism. The Xbox version was praised for its performance and graphics despite several reviewers noting distracting drops in frame rate and other technical issues. The PC version was frequently criticized as having similar frame rate issues in addition to problems with the controls, the <b>necessity</b> <b>for</b> a powerful computer to run the game properly, {{and the fact that the}} game was scaled down to run on the Xbox.|$|E

5|$|In , a new {{collectible}} item {{known as}} mini medals, resembling small gold coins with a five-pointed {{star in the}} middle, was introduced; {{they have nothing to}} do with winning the game, but they can be traded with a certain character for items. Players collect them throughout the game, primarily by opening chests, breaking pots and barrels, and searching in sacks and drawers. Horii introduced them as he wanted to have something players collected that were similar to the crests and orbs in the previous Dragon Quest games, but did not want to repeat the <b>necessity</b> <b>for</b> players having to collect a certain number of them before they could complete the game.|$|E
5|$|In 1525 or 1526, Gérard {{withdrew his}} son from the Collège de Montaigu and {{enrolled}} {{him in the}} University of Orléans to study law. According to contemporary biographers Theodore Beza and Nicolas Colladon, Gérard believed that Calvin would earn more money as a lawyer than as a priest. After {{a few years of}} quiet study, Calvin entered the University of Bourges in 1529. He was intrigued by Andreas Alciati, a humanist lawyer. Humanism was a European intellectual movement which stressed classical studies. During his 18-month stay in Bourges, Calvin learned Koine Greek, a <b>necessity</b> <b>for</b> studying the New Testament.|$|E
5|$|Leclerc heeded {{the advice}} {{he was given}} by United States General of the Army Douglas MacArthur to bring as many {{soldiers}} as possible. He broke the Vietminh blockade around Saigon, then drove through the Mekong delta and up into the highlands. This was possible because Ho feared Chinese domination far more than French colonialism, which he perceived to be in decline. Ho's first priority was {{getting rid of the}} Chinese, and for this he needed French help. Leclerc quickly perceived the <b>necessity</b> <b>for</b> a political solution to the conflict.|$|E

5|$|On December 18, 2006, a video {{which showed}} BackupHDDVD {{being used to}} decrypt and copy the film Full Metal Jacket to a hard drive was {{uploaded}} to YouTube. Two days after the video was uploaded, the initial version of the utility along with its source code and documentation was uploaded to a file hosting service. A link to the file was then posted by the utility's creator on the forums of Doom9, a website devoted to DVD backup. The utility's documentation, along with the forum post, contained little information as to how necessary keys could be obtained. The author elaborated in another forum post, claiming that keys could be obtained by exploiting the <b>necessity</b> <b>for</b> them {{to be held in}} memory to allow playback in player software.|$|E
5|$|Siliconera writer Rolando again {{echoed the}} <b>necessity</b> <b>for</b> {{understanding}} Japanese {{due to the}} game's text-heavy nature while noting the plot was quite simple and in common with other Monolith Soft titles, but otherwise generally praised the gameplay mechanics and noted that multiplayer would be fun {{despite the lack of}} WiFi functionality. In conclusion, he positively compared Soma Bringer to console turn-based role-playing game Lost Odyssey: while it brought nothing new to the genre, it was a nostalgic experience that reminded players of the genre's worth. English previews positively compared the gameplay to the Mana series, with 1UP.com's Jeremy Parish also noting it feeling familiar to gameplay from the Diablo series. These comparisons were also shared by other reviewers.|$|E
5|$|The battle lasted two and {{a quarter}} hours, in which Centurion and Cybèle fought a close duel which left both ships badly damaged. Supported by the {{remainder}} of the squadron, Cybèle successfully withdrew under fire, but Centurion, without support from the distant Diomede was also forced to retire for repairs. Unable to continue the blockade the British force returned to India, allowing food supplies to reach Île de France. Due to the <b>necessity</b> <b>for</b> campaigns against Dutch Ceylon and the Dutch East Indies, the British blockade was not renewed, but the French were unable to take advantage due to increasing civil unrest among the island's population.|$|E

5|$|There were {{increasing}} {{signs of}} heavy communist logistical activity in southeastern Laos, activity which heralded {{just such a}} North Vietnamese offensive. Communist offensives usually took place near {{the conclusion of the}} Laotian dry season (from October through March) and, for PAVN logistical forces, the push to move supplies through the system came {{during the height of the}} season. One U.S. intelligence report estimated that 90 percent of PAVN materiel coming down the Ho Chi Minh Trail was being funneled into the three northernmost provinces of South Vietnam, indicating forward stockpiling in preparation for offensive action. This build-up was alarming to both Washington and the American command, and prompted the perceived <b>necessity</b> <b>for</b> a spoiling attack to derail future communist objectives.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from his}} {{profound}} differences with psychoanalytic ideas, the theoretical basis of Bowlby's monograph was controversial {{in a number}} of ways. Some profoundly disagreed with the <b>necessity</b> <b>for</b> maternal (or equivalent) love in order to function normally, or that the formation of an ongoing relationship with a child was an important part of parenting. The idea that early experiences have serious consequences for intellectual and psychosocial development was controversial in itself. Others questioned the extent to which his hypothesis was supported by the evidence. There was criticism of the confusion of the effects of privation (no primary attachment figure) and deprivation (loss of the primary attachment figure) and in particular, of the failure to distinguish between the effects of the lack of a primary attachment figure and the other forms of deprivation and understimulation that might affect children in institutions.|$|E
5|$|Bacteria {{used for}} {{biological}} control infect insects via their digestive tracts, so they offer only limited options for controlling insects with sucking mouth parts such as aphids and scale insects. Bacillus thuringiensis {{is the most}} widely applied species of bacteria used for biological control, with at least four sub-species used against Lepidopteran (moth, butterfly), Coleopteran (beetle) and Dipteran (true fly) insect pests. The bacterium is available to organic farmers in sachets of dried spores which are mixed with water and sprayed onto vulnerable plants such as brassicas and fruit trees. Genes from B. thuringiensis have also been incorporated into transgenic crops, making the plants express some of the bacterium's toxins, which are proteins. These confer resistance to insect pests and thus reduce the <b>necessity</b> <b>for</b> pesticide use. If pests develop resistance to the toxins in these crops, B. thuringiensis will become useless in organic farming also.|$|E
