Sangeet Debuchya Mulee made satirical {{comments on the}} current communal harmony in India, through the daughters of a saintly social reformer in Maharashtra, Debuji Zhingraji Janorkar, popularly known as Gadge Maharaj. The play's <b>narrative</b> <b>format</b> used Kirtans, call-and-response chanting or responsory, which were popularised by the 13th century Hindu saint, Dnyaneshwar and another 16th century Varkari saint, Tukaram. His 2001 comedy play, Mukam Post Bombilwadi, showcased tumultuous events upon Adolf Hitler's accidental landing in a small village in coastal Maharashtra. The 2004 musical play, Sangeet Lagnakallol, was set in early 1900s referencing the characters and situations from Shripad Krushna Kolhatkar's book, Sudaamyaache Pohe (1910) and Ram Ganesh Gadkari's book, Sampoorna Baalakraam (1925). His other plays like Mangalawarache Mundake (2001) discussed environmental concerns and Samudra (2005), starring Atul Kulkarni, explored a mystery based upon ancient Vedic mythological history.|$|E

Blue's Clues was the first cutout animation series for preschoolers and resembles a storybook in its use of primary colors and its simple construction paper shapes of familiar objects with varied colors and textures. Its home-based setting is familiar to American children but has a look, unlike other children's TV shows. A live production of Blue's Clues, which used many of the production innovations developed by the show's creators, toured the U.S. starting in 1999. As of 2002, over 2 million people had attended over 1,000 performances.|$|E

40|$|The {{approach}} {{of this article}} is centered on the concepts of digital competence and new <b>narrative</b> <b>formats.</b> We aim to apply these dimensions to the videogame «Dragon Age Origins», winner of the 2009 videogame of the year award. Its features - plot, characters and interactivity – make it ideal reading material in other formats and are highly motivational for young people. The development of digital competence signifies new literacy, and it is necessary to find new stimulating resources that combine the fun and formative dimensions. Equally relevant are multimodal texts (Kress & Van Leeuwen, 2001), especially new <b>narrative</b> <b>formats</b> that imply social progress, as the ways of reading are different. The texts have acquired new formats with the same quality as books but they sometimes motivate users more. This is the case of «Dragon Age Origins», a dark heroic fantasy role-playing game set in a unique world containing a story to be read and experienced. Our analysis of the videogame discusses whether it should be considered a form of reading or not...|$|R

But many educators and librarians still resist inclusion of graphic narratives in school libraries and devalue the reading practice of students who prefer more visual texts. Using the framework of radical change, which posits that both text conventions and reader expectations for text are increasingly multimodal as they possess characteristics of evolving digital media, this study considered the relationship of the characteristics of text individual students prefer, particularly those they select from the school library, and their attitudes towards aspects of reading practice as evidenced through the Adolescent Motivation to Read Profile instrument. Survey data was supplemented with circulation history from the library management system to inform a correlational study punctuating attitudinal differences based on reader preferences. Findings include high school students who engage with graphic <b>narrative</b> text <b>formats</b> reporting more favorable views of libraries and reading. There is a demonstrable distinction in attitudes between students who prefer more visual text when compared with peers with more traditional print affinities. Student engaging with graphic narrative texts also report more frequent engagement with text overall. These demonstrated relationships should help to legitimize the inclusion of more graphic <b>narrative</b> text <b>formats</b> in school library collections...|$|R

500|$|Though Valmiki was {{the main}} {{inspiration}} for the Geet Ramayan, Madgulkar chose a different <b>narrative</b> <b>format.</b> He used a simple lyrical format with a flexible number of stanzas (from five to eleven stanzas, {{with three or four}} lines of varying length). The metre used was similar to Bhavageete, with roughly the same number of mātrās in each line. The metre was also suited to the narration and the characters who sang the song. Madgulkar used various formats, including narrative, descriptive and communal songs. He was praised for his lyrics, and was called [...] "Ādhunik Valmiki" [...] (the modern Valmiki); and the Geet Ramayan is considered [...] "the crescendo of Madgulkar's literary vigour".|$|E

Madgulkar ended the series with the song [...] "Gā Bāḷāno, Shrīrāmāyaṇ" [...] which was voiced by Valmiki where he tells his disciples, Lava and Kusha, how they should recite the Ramayana in front of Rama.

Through this spatial analysis the article considers how a bias was formed within the industry between high end single plays and popular series. Using archival production documents that detail the design and resourcing of studio space, it explores the different working studio practices that existed for the single play and series from 1955 - 63. Drawing on studio floor-plans, internal memos and institutional records of policy discussions that detail the creation, modification and resourcing of studio production facilities, including production control rooms, lighting systems, and camerawork, this article compares the different production practices for the popular BBC police series, Dixon of Dock Green (BBC 1955 - 1976) and the anthology series of single plays Armchair Theatre (ABC 1956 - 74). Although each text was produced for the rival channels of BBC 1 and ITV, my intention is not to provide a direct institutional comparison of the production practices of the BBC and ABC but rather to demonstrate how the design and technological resources of a studio can impact upon the aesthetics of different televisual <b>narrative</b> <b>formats.</b> Hence my primary aim {{is to examine the}} relationship between the physical attributes of studios and resultant styles of the cheaper, popular series and the more prestigious single play, offering an original approach to considering television space...|$|R

500|$|Steve Perry is the Daddies' sole lyricist, {{and writes}} the {{majority}} of his songs in a fictional <b>narrative</b> <b>format</b> he credits as being influenced by Randy Newman, Ray Davies and Jarvis Cocker, often told about or through the unreliable perspective of downtrodden characters struggling against adversity.

Perry has also incorporated political themes into his music, most overtly on the Daddies' 2013 album White Teeth, Black Thoughts, which addressed issues relating to the 2008 financial crisis through a variety of American character perspectives. The Register-Guard has described Perry's lyrics as [...] "ribald [...] often despairing", [...] " [...] the underbelly of society, stabbing at oppressors such as...the pressure to conform", while The New York Times has lauded them as [...] "vivid poetry" [...] containing [...] "an inventiveness missing from the other swing bands' lyrics".|$|E

500|$|Sesame Street {{reflected}} the prevailing view that preschoolers had short attention spans; it featured a magazine-like format consisting of varied segments. Based on research conducted over the 30 {{years since the}} launch of Sesame Street by theorists like Anderson, the producers of Blue's Clues wanted to develop a show that took advantage of children's intellectual and behavioral activity when watching television. Previous children's television programs presented their content with little input from their viewers, but Blue's Clues {{was one of the}} first children's shows to actively invite its viewers' involvement. Its creators believed that if children were more involved in what they were viewing, they would attend to its content longer than previously expected—for up to a half hour—and learn more. They also dropped the magazine format for a more traditional <b>narrative</b> <b>format.</b> As Variety magazine stated, [...] "...The choice for Blue's Clues became to tell one story, beginning to end, camera moving left-to-right like reading a storybook, transitions from scene to scene as obvious as the turning of a page."

The producers requested that Henson and his team create Muppets such as Big Bird and Oscar the Grouch to interact with the human actors, and the Street segments were re-shot. Sesame Streets format remained intact until the show's later decades, when the changing audience required that producers move to a more <b>narrative</b> <b>format.</b> In 1998, the popular segment [...] "Elmo's World", a 15-minute-long segment hosted by the Muppet Elmo, was created.
