5000|$|Tax codes {{followed}} by the letter L represent the size of tax free personal allowance on earnings. This is {{the total amount of}} money, per year, one can earn tax free. The number attached to them represents tax free earnings divided by 10.

[...] Persons over 65 and 75 have an increased personal allowance.Tax free Personal allowances can only be taken once across earnings. A second job or a job with a pension is taxed at a basic rate of 20%, or the tax allowance can be split across both sources of income.Non-standard codes are used when usual tax free allowances do not apply. Where no allowances exist, code BR is used to tax at basic rate (20%), and code D0 is used to tax at higher rate (40%). If no tax is to be collected, code NT is used. If tax has to be collected on an income above PAYE earnings, a K code is used. This works as equivalent to a <b>negative</b> <b>tax</b> allowance.|$|E

40|$|In this thesis, {{the idea}} of an {{unconditional}} basic income is investigated by means of sociological and public finance analyses, with results about structural problems of the Austrian tax and transfer system building the starting point. The unconditional basic income {{in the form of a}} <b>negative</b> income <b>tax</b> is therefore discussed and tentatively developed. It is suggested that the <b>negative</b> income <b>tax</b> should be granted unconditionally and individually to all legal and permanent residents without the obligation of services in return. Besides the <b>negative</b> lump sum <b>tax,</b> a lump sum supplement should be granted for caregivers, honorary workers and people incapable of working. Based on a person’s own income a positive tax should be counted against the <b>negative</b> income <b>tax.</b> With the implementation of the suggested model of a <b>negative</b> income <b>tax,</b> basic (financial) needs could be secured and the tax and transfer system could be harmonized, whereby administration effort could be reduced and poverty traps avoided. It is stressed that for the implementation of a comprehensive model of a <b>negative</b> income <b>tax</b> all relevant parameters as well as possible impacts need to be investigated cautiously; suggestions of this thesis therefore need to be seen as a first attempt. The attitude towards an unconditional basic income furthermore influences its successful implementation. Results suggest that great importance needs to be laid on the designation of the model as well as the conservation of the performance principle and self-responsibility to ensure a successful transformation. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Using {{a general}} multi-country {{equilibrium}} {{model with a}} multinational enterprise, this paper investigates the efficiency properties of separate accounting and formula apportionment. If governments are large, i. e. {{take into account the}} effect of their statutory tax rate on the interest rate, and maximize tax revenues, tax rates under separate accounting may be inefficiently high while tax rates under formula apportionment turn out to be inefficiently low. In case of separate accounting the tendency toward inefficiently high tax rates traces back to a <b>negative</b> <b>tax</b> base externality. In case of formula apportionment the race to the bottom is caused by positive formula and tax base externalities.

40|$|Č. 11 (2000) : Sborník synopsí referátů pro 1. výroční konferenci České společnosti ekonomickéThe {{principle}} of negative income tax {{stems from the}} idea of ”guaranteed income”. The construction of negative income tax is based on the principle that the tax is paid only by those taxpayers who reach a specified level on income. Those with income below such a level would be entitled to receive financial support (<b>negative</b> <b>tax)</b> from the government. Negative income tax links taxation with social security payments. It means the abolition of social security insurance and requires tax authorities to merge with social security institutions. On the practical level, negative income tax supposes the replacement of existing taxes. <b>Negative</b> <b>tax</b> should secure not only a minimum income level, but also stimulate the economic activity of taxpayers. Negative income tax is not currently used in any country. If the Czech Republic decided to introduce it, the country would bear the high costs associated with any radical and innovative tax reform, which, in this case, would also be combined with a restructuring of the whole of the social security system...|$|E

40|$|Very {{preliminary}} {{and incomplete}} draft: Please do not quote without permission. Structural Vector Autoregressions (SVARs) are identified imposing parametric restrictions. Each set of restrictions {{corresponds to a}} different structural model with potentially different implications. Yet the link between assumptions on the structural model and results has not been systematically explored. This paper contributes to fill this gap in the literature. First, we show how to solve analytically the translation of reduced-form residuals into policy shocks. Second, we use the closed-form solution to derive analytically impulse response functions. This theoretical framework is applied to explore identification of tax shocks. We derive an analytical relation between the output elasticity of tax revenue (restriction) and the impact tax multiplier. We show that all identification schemes used in the literature can be recasted {{in terms of the}} elasticity. Two results emerge from our analysis. First, differences in elasticity explain differences in the estimates of the tax multiplier reported in the literature. Second, empirically plausible elasticities are consistent with positive and <b>negative</b> <b>tax</b> multipliers. This finding contradicts conjectures in the literature ruling out <b>negative</b> <b>tax</b> multipliers. JEL Classification: E 62; C 52...|$|E
40|$|Tax {{expenditures}} are government indirect spending, {{hidden in the}} tax system, often used to support government’s social and economic objectives. Instead of directly allocating money for a particular objective, the government forgoes tax revenues from those who undertake activities that could achieve the objective. Therefore, tax expenditures should be analysed as government spending programs. Tax expenditure reporting and analysis has been a regular practice among many countries in the world, especially in developed countries, to ensure efficient and effective allocation of government resources and enhance government’s transparency. Unfortunately, despite having lavish tax incentives, the Malaysian government has not produced a tax expenditure report. As a result, tax {{expenditures are}} mistakenly analysed as aspects of the tax collection system rather than as part of spending programs. This thesis sets a foundation for tax expenditure reporting and analysis in Malaysia by identifying and analysing tax expenditures of Malaysia’s corporate income tax arising from all sources of tax law – tax legislation, case law and administrative practices. In addition, this thesis also identifies and analyses <b>negative</b> <b>tax</b> expenditures that provide disincentives to government-disfavoured activities. The main objective of this thesis is to determine whether particular corporate income tax expenditures or corporate negative income tax expenditures should be removed, maintained or modified using the conventional tax expenditure analysis. Prior to identifying tax expenditures, elements of a benchmark tax structure are developed. This thesis contributes to new knowledge by proposing Malaysian accounting standards as the benchmark tax base to identify corporate tax expenditures. Any tax rules that deviate from the benchmark tax structure are analysed as tax expenditures (if they lower tax payable) or <b>negative</b> <b>tax</b> expenditures (if they increase tax payable). Conventional tax expenditure analysis commences with an assertion of (or speculation about) the apparent objective {{of each of the}} tax expenditures and <b>negative</b> <b>tax</b> expenditures being assessed, asking first whether there are justifiable reasons for the government to intervene in the market by offering subsidies or imposing penalties based on taxpayers’ behaviour. If government intervention can be justified, {{the next step is to}} propose the optimal vehicle to achieve the objective. The findings of this thesis reinforce doubts held by some about the effectiveness of tax expenditures as tools to promote government objectives. A number of the tax expenditures identified appear to be redundant, providing government support for companies to undertake actions that they would likely do even without the tax expenditures. Most tax expenditures in Malaysia are not accurately targeted; they only benefit profitable companies and thus miss many enterprises most in need of assistance. There are also tax expenditures that have lost their relevancy, including a few that were inherited from the British tax system. They have been forgotten or accepted as part of the normative tax system, and are left in the legislation with no revision. Most <b>negative</b> <b>tax</b> expenditures that are explicitly legislated have plausible reasons to stay in the tax system. However, implicit <b>negative</b> <b>tax</b> expenditures that stem from strict judicial interpretations have led to the denial of deductions for some normal business expenses. This is unfair to businesses. Overall, this thesis demonstrates the importance of tax expenditure reporting and analysis, particularly in Malaysia, to help the government in managing its resources and formulating better policies...|$|E
