50|$|When byte {{swapping}} {{is required}} to convert between the big-endian byte order <b>of</b> <b>variant</b> 1 and the little-endian byte order <b>of</b> <b>variant</b> <b>2,</b> the fields above define the swapping. The first three fields are unsigned 32- and 16-bit integers and are subject to swapping, while the last two fields consist of uninterpreted bytes, not subject to swapping. This byte swapping applies even for version 3, 4, and 5 UUID's where the canonical fields do not correspond {{to the content of}} the UUID.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} three restricted <b>variants</b> <b>of</b> P systems with active membranes: (1) P systems using out communication rules only, (2) P systems using elementary membrane division and dissolution rules only, and (3) polarizationless P systems using dissolution and restricted evolution rules only. We show that every problem in P {{can be solved}} with uniform families of any <b>of</b> these <b>variants.</b> This, using known results on the upper bound of the computational power <b>of</b> <b>variants</b> (1) and (3) yields new characterizations of the class P. In the case <b>of</b> <b>variant</b> (<b>2)</b> we provide a further characterization of P by giving a semantic restriction on the computations of P systems of this varian...|$|R

40|$|A {{fish pond}} {{experiment}} {{was conducted in}} two ponds which were stocked with 0 aged common carp and bighead carp larvae in numeric abundance ratio 3 : 1 (variant 1) while in other two ponds the ratio was 1 : 3 in favor <b>of</b> bighead carp (<b>variant</b> <b>2).</b> To each <b>of</b> the two stocking variants we added {{one and the same}} number of 0 aged grass carps and 1 + or 2 + common carps. The experiment lasted 4 months (May to September) and was repeated in two consecutive years (2007, 2008). The second year <b>variant</b> <b>2</b> was conducted in three ponds. The fish ponds belonged to the experimental facilities of the Institute for Fishery and Aquaculture, Bulgaria. The plankton primary production and other related variables were measured approximately fortnightly and continuously throughout the experiment duration. At the end of experiment number and yield of fishes were measured and survival rates were calculated. Survival rate of bighead carp and yield of common carp and bighead carp <b>of</b> <b>variant</b> 1 were significantly higher than those <b>of</b> <b>variant</b> <b>2.</b> The yield <b>of</b> bighead carp larvae did not, while that of common carp, grass carp and total fish yield correlated significantly and positively with plankton primary production. The yield of accidentally fallen into ponds of crucian carps (Carassius carassius Lin.) correlated strongly negatively with 1 +/ 2 + common carps, which was indication for the strong food completion between them...|$|R
