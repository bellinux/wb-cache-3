25|$|Historically, LDLT {{began with}} {{terminal}} pediatric patients, {{whose parents were}} motivated to risk donating {{a portion of their}} compatible healthy livers to replace their children's failing ones. The first report of successful LDLT was by Dr. Christoph Broelsch at the University of Chicago Medical Center in November 1989, when two-year-old Alyssa Smith received a portion of her mother's liver. Surgeons eventually realized that adult-to-adult LDLT was also possible, and now the practice is common in a few reputable medical institutes. It is considered more technically demanding than even standard, cadaveric donor liver transplantation, and also poses the ethical problems underlying the indication of a major surgical operation (hemihepatectomy or related procedure) on a healthy human being. In various case series, the risk of complications in the donor is around 10%, and very occasionally a second operation is needed. Common problems are biliary fistula, gastric stasis and infections; they are more common after removal of the right lobe of the liver. Death after LDLT has been reported at 0% (Japan), 0.3% (USA) and <1% (Europe), with risks likely to decrease further as surgeons gain more experience in this procedure. Since the law was changed to permit altruistic <b>non-directed</b> living organ donations in the UK in 2006, the first altruistic living liver donation took place in Britain in December 2012.|$|E

Recidivism rates of direct commitment youth are over 8 % higher than identically matched probation supervision youth. Results from youth completing a FDJJ service during fiscal year 2010 - 2011 indicate: • Males and minority youth, as well as low risk to re-offend youth constitute significantly higher proportions of direct commitments than they do <b>non-direct</b> commitments. Direct commitment therefore arguably exacerbates already high rates of disproportionate minority contact (DMC), specifically minority males, within the juvenile justice system; • High risk to re-offend youth constitute a significantly higher proportion of <b>non-direct</b> commitments than they do direct commitments; • Youth who are <b>non-direct</b> commitments have significantly higher criminal history scores, indicating more priors, more serious priors, and more prior deeper-end placements than direct commitment youth; • Youth who are <b>non-direct</b> commitments have significantly higher scores on a global measure of risk including areas such as school (enrollment, conduct, attendance and performance), delinquent peer associations, history of running away/getting kicked out of the house, family incarceration history, alcohol and drug use, physical/sexual abuse o...|$|R

2500|$|The above figure {{illustrates}} the proposed mechanism for oxidation by the White–Chen catalyst. [...] The reaction proceeds {{in conjunction with}} hydrogen peroxide oxidant and acetic acid. [...] The catalyst quickly reacts with hydrogen peroxide, believed to be catalyzed by the acetic acid, and forms and iron-oxo intermediate. [...] The iron-oxo intermediate is then thought to abstract a hydrogen on the carbon to be oxidized to generate a short-lived carbon centered radical. [...] The iron-hydroxide then quickly rebounds onto the carbon centered radical to form the oxidized compound. Recently, direct evidence was obtained for a carbon-centered radical intermediate in this reaction using a Taxane-based radical trap. It {{is important to note}} that these reactions (both directed and <b>non-directed)</b> proceed with complete retention of stereochemistry.|$|E

50|$|Linguist Martin Haspelmath classifies inchoative/causative verb pairs {{under three}} main categories: causative, anticausative, and <b>non-directed</b> alternations. <b>Non-directed</b> alternations are further {{subdivided}} into labile, equipollent, and suppletive alternations.English tends to favour labile alternations, {{meaning that the}} same verb {{is used in the}} inchoative and causative forms.

In the underlying tree structure for (3b), the silent subunits CAUS and BECOME are both embedded within the VP, resulting in the causative change-of-state meaning (x cause y become z).|$|E

40|$|The {{fragmentation}} {{reactions of}} the MH+ ions of Leu-enkephalin amide {{and a variety of}} heptapeptide amides have been studied in detail as a function of collision energy using a QqToF beam type mass spectrometer. The initial fragmentation of the protonated amides involves primarily formation of bn ions, including significant loss of NH 3 from the MH+ ions. Further fragmentation of these bn ions occurs following macrocyclization/ring opening leading in many cases to bn ions with permuted sequences and, thus, to formation of <b>non-direct</b> sequence ions. The importance of these <b>non-direct</b> sequence ions increases markedly with increasing collision energy, making peptide sequence determination difficult, if not impossible, at higher collision energies.

50|$|Similar to Cu(I) {{chemistry}} mentioned above, Rh(I) complexes {{can also}} transmetallate with arylboronic esters to get aryl rhodium intermediates, to which CO2 is inserted giving carboxylic acids.. Later, Iwasawa et al. described C-H carboxylation strategy. Rh(I) undergoes oxidative addition to aryl C-H bond followed by transmetallation with alkyl aluminum species. Ar-Rh(I) regenerates by reductive elimination releasing methane. Ar-Rh(I) attacks CO2 then transmetallates with aryl boronic acid {{to release the}} boronic acid of product, giving final carboxylic acid by hydrolysis.
