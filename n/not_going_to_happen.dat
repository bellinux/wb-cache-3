5|$|British {{producer}} Elizabeth Karlsen of Number 9 Films {{came across}} Nagy's script circa 2004, {{during which she}} co-produced Nagy's film Mrs. Harris with Christine Vachon of New York-based Killer Films. Berwin's rights to The Price of Salt expired in 2010, and Karlsen thereafter acquired the script. Berwin remained an executive producer on the film. Karlsen managed to convince Highsmith's estate to sign over the rights to her, closing down the deal with Tessa Ross in late 2011. She then persuaded a disillusioned and reluctant Nagy to come back on board. The producers hired a U.K. director who then dropped out because of scheduling conflicts. They later recruited Irish director John Crowley, who was announced in May 2012 along with the film's lead cast, Cate Blanchett and Mia Wasikowska, and involved producers, Karlsen and Stephen Woolley of Number 9 Films and Tessa Ross of Film4, who received executive producer credit. Carol was scheduled to commence photography in early 2013, until Crowley withdrew due to a scheduling conflict. Karlsen called Christine Vachon to discuss losing another director and Vachon told her that Haynes' new film was <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> because its star had backed out of it. They then decided to approach Haynes. Vachon, Haynes' frequent collaborator, {{asked him if he}} would be interested and he received a copy of the screenplay. Two days later he committed to direct and Vachon joined the film as a producer. Haynes was announced {{as the director of the}} film in May 2013. Two days later, The Weinstein Company acquired U.S. distribution rights at the Cannes Film Festival.|$|E

And if people are expecting {{something}} better to come along tomorrow, then they shouldn't be holding their breath, because it's <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen.</b> Big Day Out set the high benchmark which {{is not going to}} be succeeded by a one-day festival in the near future for sure.|$|E

They would use member owned speedboats to run liquor from Canada to Detroit. Trust would soon be lost between {{the men and the}} Purple Gang. Lebowitz, Paul, and Sutker hijacked members of the gang and preyed on other local gang members disregarding their territories. Trying to establish themselves as an independent power, they became known as the “Third Avenue Terrors”. Trying to take over Detroit’s underworld mainly controlled by the Purple Gang was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be a hard task and one that the Gang was <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> let <b>happen</b> easily.|$|R
5000|$|One {{important}} point to consider about {{this study is}} that Sunnafrank says that college freshmen can be “aggressive” in pursuing new friendships and relationships within social circles and that behavior tends to change over time. “In most situations in life, our time is pretty much claimed by work and family matters, so even when you meet people you really like, chances are <b>not</b> much is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen.</b> As life goes on and social networks become solidified, acting on that first impression becomes less likely.” ...|$|R
25|$|On 8 April Haig, {{having learned}} of {{intelligence}} reports of German reserves massing in the British sector, tried again, asking his French liaison officer, General de Laguiche, to ask Foch to send French divisions {{to free up}} six British divisions to form a reserve in Flanders, but Weygand arrived at GHQ to tell Herbert Lawrence in person that this was <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen.</b> Wilson arrived in France {{on the morning of}} 9 April, just as the German offensive in Flanders was beginning.|$|E
25|$|On 2 October Hindenburg {{told the}} Kaiser’s Crown Council that Germany {{could no longer}} win a {{military}} victory, and the following day a new government was formed under Prince Max, which approached President Wilson for peace based on the Fourteen Points. When Haig met Foch on 6 October, Foch showed him the newspaper reports of this and {{told him it was}} {{a direct result of the}} BEF breach of the Hindenburg Line at its strongest point, although the almost simultaneous capitulation of Bulgaria was also a factor and discussions would continue for a month until the ceasefire on 11 November. At the meeting Haig again asked for US divisions for his sector, and was told this was <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen.</b>|$|E
25|$|Beginning at WrestleMania 32, a {{match between}} Big Show and NBA star Shaquille O'Neal had been teased from various media outlets, {{including}} WWE. Shaq {{was a surprise}} entrant in the 2016 André the Giant Memorial Battle Royal where he and Big Show faced off, but the other participants eliminated both of them. In July at the 2016 ESPY Awards on the red carpet, Show and Shaq had another brief confrontation. A match was proposed for WrestleMania 33, which Shaq accepted. In January 2017, the two began calling each other out on social media, posting workout videos of themselves preparing for the potential match. Big Show then began to doubt Shaq's commitment to the match. By the end of February, Shaq said {{that it looked like}} the match was <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen,</b> but he would still train just in case. The following week, Shaq said that discussions were back on between him and WWE. However, Big Show's announcement as a participant in the 2017 André the Giant Memorial Battle Royal indicated that the match was off. According to Dave Meltzer of Wrestling Observer Newsletter, the match was canceled due to monetary reasons, as both parties could not agree on a deal. Big Show said that he really wanted to do the match, especially since this would probably be his last WrestleMania and blamed Shaq's weight as a reason for why Shaq backed out.|$|E

While Cole is being withheld and the doctors try to keep him awake, Sasha contacts him and tells him she's <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> let anything <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> him. She also tells him that Moya thinks she's beaten her, but she's wrong and she'll see her dead. When Cole's vitals stabilize, Moya says the two of them need to have a long talk.|$|R

500|$|Rehman caused {{controversy}} in 2007 when {{in an interview}} with the British weekly newspaper the Eastern Eye he said that players of Asian descent should consider sticking to their roots rather than dreaming of playing for England. Rehman pointed to Michael Chopra and David Nugent, who both were top scorer in the Championship, but Nugent was called up for England while Chopra was not. Rehman claimed [...] "Why wasn't (Chopra) picked ahead of Dave Nugent? He's the top goal scorer in the Championship but he can't get in (the England set-up). So he needs to maybe look at his decision and go play for India instead of hanging on to the dream of playing for England, because it's <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen,</b> end of discussion." ...|$|E

[...] D'Onofrio cited Feige's {{previous}} reasoning as well as the fact that the films already had difficulty [...] "bringing big characters in that they have to service in the writing" [...] and adding characters from the television series would be [...] "just too many characters" [...] since the films were [...] "trying to figure out already how to individualize more {{and at the same time}} keep The Avengers going." [...] In March 2017, Anthony Mackie, who portrays Sam Wilson / Falcon in the films, felt a crossover between the films and television series [...] "wouldn't work at all" [...] given they are [...] "different universes, different worlds, different companies, different designs" [...] and that [...] "Kevin Feige is very specific about how he wants the Marvel Universe to be seen in the film world." [...] That May, Feige noted that a character appearing in a television series would not necessarily exclude them from appearing in a film, adding that [...] "at some point, there's going to be a crossover.

He was however unconditionally released and permitted to keep the furs in spite of the verdict, because the Métis who attended the trial, Louis Riel Sr. at their head, made it clear they were <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> let it <b>happen.</b>|$|R

500|$|Chandler's {{budget was}} limited, so {{in an effort}} to reduce {{expenditures}} he and Hendrix completed much of the album's pre-production work at their shared apartment.

He later explained: [...] "I wasn't concerned that Mitch or Noel might feel that they weren't having enough—or any—say... I had been touring and recording in a band for years, and I'd seen everything end as a compromise. Nobody ended up doing what they really wanted to do.

When I put that with the voice and figure being the same, and only those things altered which might be changed by a razor or a wig, I could not doubt that it was the same man. Of course you expect two brothers to be alike, but not that they should have the same tooth stuffed in the same way. He bowed me out, and I found myself in the street, hardly knowing whether I was on my head or my heels. Back I went to my hotel, put my head in a basin of cold water, and tried to think it out. Why had he sent me from London to Birmingham? Why had he got there before me? And why had he written a letter from himself to himself? It was altogether too much for me, and I could make no sense of it. And then suddenly it struck me that what was dark to me might be very light to Mr. Sherlock Holmes. I had just time to get up to town by the night train to see him this morning, and to bring you both back with me to Birmingham." ...|$|R

50|$|The novel {{introduces}} some of Pat Barker’s stable motifs and themes, e.g. {{the different}} {{smell of a}} person’s body when they are afraid; the preoccupation with the visual and the enigma of the human eye; the destruction of clichés, s.a. the belief that prostitutes are poor, unintelligent, {{and do not have}} other opportunities for work: ’I like this life. I’m not in it because I’m a poor, deprived, inadequate, half-witted woman, whatever some people might like to think, I’m in it because it suits me, I like the company, I like the excitement. I like the feeling of stepping out onto the street, <b>not</b> knowing what’s <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> or who I’m <b>going</b> <b>to</b> meet. I like the freedom. I like being able to decide when I’m <b>going</b> <b>to</b> work. I like being able to take the day off without being answerable to anybody.’ Similarly to Kelly’s story in Union Street, Barker’s first oeuvre, in Blow Your House Down is the obscure middle-class character (here, a serial killer, there a child rapist), apparently a well-to-do family man, but in reality one who has an unresolved complex stemming from his childhood. There is a telling parallel between them: the rapist from Union Street eats a peppermint chewing gum, the murderer in Blow Your House Down violet-smelling candies, when they are about to commit their crimes - perhaps a way of keeping their egos clean from the dirty business of their ids. Also reminiscent of Barker’s debut, there is a community of women who are on honest, friendly, supportive terms mutually. The only males in the novel are the clients. These are sometimes pathetic, sometimes brutal but they rarely manage to arouse a real positive emotion in the prostitutes. The novel can be read as a celebration of the aggressive vitality of the women prostitutes.|$|R
