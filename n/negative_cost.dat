The transaction occurred around August 1946, but was not made public until it was screened for the trade press on October1, marking its official release date. The sale occurred so quickly and hastily on the copyright files stores at the Library of Congress, the name Universal Pictures was crossed out and Pathe Industries, PRC's corporate body, was written in its place in pencil. Some pressbook advertisements circulated for the film still included the Universal Pictures logo.

25|$|Ford's {{next two}} films stand {{somewhat}} {{apart from the}} rest of his films in terms of production, and he notably took no salary for either job. The Rising of the Moon (Warner Bros, 1957) was a three-part 'omnibus' movie shot on location in Ireland and based on Irish short stories. It was made by Four Province Productions, a company established by Irish tycoon Lord Killanin, who had recently become Chair of the International Olympic Committee, and to whom Ford was distantly related. Killanin was also the actual (but uncredited) producer of The Quiet Man. The film failed to recoup its costs, earning less than half ($100,000) its <b>negative</b> <b>cost</b> of just over $256,000 and it stirred up some controversy in Ireland.|$|E

In 2000, Marvel made a long-term agreement with Artisan Entertainment to turn 15 of their characters into films and TV shows, among them The Punisher with Gale Anne Hurd to produce. The Punisher marked Marvel’s first major independent release as an equity owner, whereby it contributes characters and creative support to lower-budget pics {{in exchange for a}} financial stake in the <b>negative</b> <b>cost.</b> Screenwriter Jonathan Hensleigh signed on in April 2002, and The Punisher also became his directing debut. The story and plot were mainly based on two Punisher comic book stories, Welcome Back, Frank and The Punisher: Year One. Hensleigh explained he had to excise much of the influence from Welcome Back, Frank as it would have likely been a four-hour-long film.|$|E

500|$|Initially, Pinocchio {{was not a}} box-office success. The {{box office}} returns from the film's initial release were both below Snow White's {{unprecedented}} success and below studio expectations. Of the film's $2.289 million <b>negative</b> <b>cost</b> – twice the cost of Snow White – Disney only recouped $1 million by late 1940, with studio reports of the film's final original box office take varying between $1.4 million and $1.9 million. Animation historian Michael Barrier notes that Pinocchio returned rentals of less than one million by September 1940, and in its first public annual report, Walt Disney Productions charged off a $1 million loss to the film. Barrier relays that a 1947 Pinocchio balance sheet listed total receipts to the studio of $1,423,046.78. This was primarily {{due to the fact}} that World War II and its aftermath had cut off the European and Asian markets overseas, and hindered the international success of Pinocchio and other Disney releases during the early and mid-1940s. Joe Grant recalled Walt Disney being [...] "very, very depressed" [...] about Pinocchio's initial returns at the box office. RKO recorded a loss of $94,000 for the film.|$|E
500|$|When Sony Pictures Entertainment renegotiated with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer {{the deal}} to co-finance the Bond {{franchise}} in 2011, they were tasked to provide 25 percent of the <b>negative</b> <b>cost</b> of both Skyfall and Spectre, [...] in exchange to receiving 25 percent of the profits plus distribution fees for overseeing its worldwide rollout. When the film was announced in June 2013, the budget was not yet fixed, but was certain {{to be higher than}} the $210 million of Skyfall due to foreign locations and bigger payments for Mendes and Craig. In November 2014, Sony was targeted by hackers who released details of confidential e-mails between Sony executives regarding several high-profile film projects. Included within these were several memos relating to the production of Spectre, claiming that the film was over budget, detailing early drafts of the script written by John Logan, and expressing Sony's frustration with the project. Eon Productions later issued a statement confirming the leak of what they called [...] "an early version of the screenplay". Eon resisted Sony and MGM's arguments to cut on stunts and location work to reduce the budget, but managed to secure tax incentives and rebates, such as $14 million from Mexico. Spectre has a final budget estimated between $250 million and $275 million.|$|E

This undecidability result follows from an encoding of Stop-Watch Automata using such MPTA, and applies to MPTA with as few as two cost variables, and even when no costs are incurred upon taking edges. (2) We then restrict the MPTA such that each viable quasi-cyclic path of the underlying MPTS incurs a minimum absolute cost.
