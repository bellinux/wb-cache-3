Training <b>network</b> <b>administrators</b> is a rather expensive and time consuming process. However, this training needs to be provided {{on a regular basis}} in order to refresh their readiness and to train them to respond to new, emerging threats. Malicious Activity Simulation Tool (MAST) aims to provide realistic, tailored simulation of malicious activity for the purpose of training <b>network</b> <b>administrators</b> to recognize and respond to threats on the network they manage. In a continuation of MAST development, this thesis reports the testing and evaluation of the MAST functionality on a Local Area Network (LAN) using a Common PC Operating System Environment (COMPOSE) as its network operating system. We conclude that MAST can present realistic simulations of malicious activity that could be detected, recognized, and responded to by <b>network</b> <b>administrators</b> and host <b>network,</b> while posing no threat to the operational readiness of the host network or its supported missions.
