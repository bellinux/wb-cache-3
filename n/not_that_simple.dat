2500|$|In {{distinguishing}} {{his work}} from others, Martin {{makes a point}} of emphasizing realism and plausible social dynamics above an over-reliance on magic and a simplistic [...] "good versus evil" [...] dichotomy, which contemporary fantasy writing is often criticized for. Notably, Martin's work makes a sharp departure from the prevalent [...] "heroic knights and chivalry" [...] schema that has become a mainstay in fantasy as derived from The Lord of the Rings series of J.R.R. Tolkien. He specifically critiques the oversimplification of Tolkien's themes and devices by imitators in ways that he has humorously described as [...] "Disneyland Middle Ages", which gloss over or even ignore major differences between medieval and modern societies, particularly social structures, ways of living, and political arrangements. Martin has been described as [...] "the American Tolkien" [...] by literary critics. While Martin finds inspiration in Tolkien's legacy, he aims to go beyond what he sees as Tolkien's [...] "medieval philosophy" [...] of [...] "if the king was a good man, the land would prosper" [...] to delve into the complexities, ambiguities, and vagaries of real-life power: [...] "We look at real history and it's <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>simple...</b> Just having good intentions doesn't make you a wise king." [...] Per this fact George R.R. Martin has been credited with the rise of Grimdark fantasy, a modern form of an [...] "anti-Tolkien" [...] approach to fantasy writing which, according to British science fiction and fantasy novelist Adam Roberts, is characterized by its reaction to Tolkien's idealism even though it owes a lot to Tolkien's work. The Canadian fantasy writer R. Scott Bakker [...] "says he wouldn't have been able to publish his fantasy novels without the success George R. R. Martin achieved first."
