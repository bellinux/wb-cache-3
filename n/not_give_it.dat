5|$|Davies scored for Bolton on 21 {{minutes when}} an error by Middlesbrough goalkeeper Schwarzer allowed his shot {{to go inside}} his near post. Bolton {{continued}} to attack, and Schwarzer made a double save from winger Per Frandsen and Djorkaeff. The latter had two more chances soon after, missing the target with the first. Boro pleaded for a second penalty when Nicky Hunt pulled Job, but referee Riley did <b>not</b> <b>give</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
5|$|Ten {{minutes into}} the second half, Juventus {{equalised}}: Claudio Marchisio back-heeled the ball to right-back Stephan Lichtsteiner, who set up Carlos Tevez. Barcelona goalkeeper Marc-André ter Stegen blocked the shot from Tevez, but Álvaro Morata equalised by putting the rebound into the net. In the 67th minute, Juventus appealed for a penalty when Paul Pogba {{went down in the}} area when challenged by Dani Alves, but the referee did <b>not</b> <b>give</b> <b>it.</b> Two minutes later, Barcelona got back into the lead when Lionel Messi shot {{from the edge of the}} area, Gianluigi Buffon blocked it and Suárez put in the rebound. Soon after, Neymar put the ball into the net from Alba's cross, but it was disallowed as the referee deemed that Neymar had headed it into his own hand.|$|E
5|$|The koala {{was given}} its generic name Phascolarctos in 1816 by French {{zoologist}} Henri Marie Ducrotay de Blainville, who would <b>not</b> <b>give</b> <b>it</b> a specific name until further review. In 1819, German zoologist Georg August Goldfuss {{gave it the}} binomial Lipurus cinereus. Because Phascolarctos was published first, according to the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature, it has priority as the official name of the genus. French naturalist Anselme Gaëtan Desmarest proposed the name Phascolartos fuscus in 1820, suggesting that the brown-coloured versions were a different species than the grey ones. Other names suggested by European authors included Marodactylus cinereus by Goldfuss in 1820, P.flindersii by René Primevère Lesson in 1827, and P.koala by John Edward Gray in 1827.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} August, all of Bonanza Creek {{had been}} claimed by miners. A {{prospector}} then advanced up {{into one of the}} creeks feeding into Bonanza, later to be named Eldorado Creek. He discovered new sources of gold there, which would prove to be even richer than those on Bonanza. Claims began to be sold between miners and speculators for considerable sums. Just before Christmas, word of the gold reached Circle City. Despite the winter, many prospectors immediately left for the Yukon by dog-sled, eager to reach the region before the best claims were taken. The outside world was still largely unaware of the news and although Canadian officials had managed {{to send a message to}} their superiors in Ottawa about the finds and influx of prospectors, the government did <b>not</b> <b>give</b> <b>it</b> much attention. The winter prevented river traffic, and it was not until June 1897 that the first boats left the area, carrying the freshly mined gold and the full story of the discoveries.|$|E

This left Australia 1 wicket down with no runs scored. Hayden {{followed}} soon after leaving Ponting and Hussey at the crease. The two survived until lunch Ponting scoring a half century. Harbhajan dismissed Ponting again causing a middle order collapse to leave Australia 6/137. On 30, Symonds was clearly caught behind off the bowling of Sharma but umpire Steve Bucknor controversially did <b>not</b> <b>give</b> <b>it</b> out.

On Kansas City's ensuing drive, New York defenders Harry Hamilton and Russell Carter shared a tackle on running back Larry Moriarty, forcing a fumble that was recovered by linebacker Kyle Clifton. Ryan then converted the turnover with a 1-yard touchdown pass to McNeil. The Chiefs were forced to punt on their next possession due to a sack by Mark Gastineau, and the Jets increased their lead to 21-6 with another score. The key player on this drive was receiver Al Toon, who made a 30-yard reception from Ryan, and later finished the drive with an 11-yard touchdown catch.|$|E
25|$|Not {{much more}} is known {{historically}} of Sulmo, which, however, appears to have {{continued to be a}} considerable provincial town.

From the Liber Coloniarum we learn also that it had received the status of a colony, probably in the time of Augustus; though Pliny does <b>not</b> <b>give</b> <b>it</b> the title of a Colonia. Inscriptions, as well as the geographers and Itineraries, attest its continued existence as a municipal town throughout the Roman Empire.|$|E

25|$|The Packers were {{scheduled}} to retire Favre's #4 jersey in a ceremony {{during the first week}} of the season. However, on July 2, 2008, he publicly indicated that he wanted to play again as the starting quarterback. On July 11, 2008, Favre sent a letter to the Packers management asking for an unconditional release which will allow him to play for another team. The Packers did <b>not</b> <b>give</b> <b>it</b> to him, but they were unwilling to release him for fear that he would sign with division rival Minnesota Vikings (Favre's choice for an alternate team). Also, the Packers would not start him as quarterback if he came back to the team, and named the other Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers as the starting quarterback and Favre as the backup.|$|E
500|$|Part of {{the reason}} why South Pacific is {{considered}} a classic is its confrontation of racism. [...] According to professor Philip Beidler, [...] "Rodgers and Hammerstein's attempt to use the Broadway theater to make a courageous statement against racial bigotry in general and institutional racism in the postwar United States in particular" [...] forms part of South Pacifics legend. [...] Although Tales of the South Pacific treats the question of racism, it does <b>not</b> <b>give</b> <b>it</b> the central place that it takes in the musical. Andrea Most, writing on the [...] "politics of race" [...] in South Pacific, suggests that in the late 1940s, American liberals, such as Rodgers and Hammerstein, turned to the fight for racial equality as a practical means of advancing their progressive views without risking being deemed communists. Trevor Nunn, director of the 2001 West End production, notes the importance of the fact that Nellie, a southerner, ends the play about to be the mother in an interracial family: [...] "It's being performed in America in 1949. That's the resonance." ...|$|E
500|$|The Australian raven {{was first}} {{described}} by Nicholas Aylward Vigors and Thomas Horsfield in 1827, when they reported George Caley's early {{notes on the}} species from the Sydney district. Its specific epithet coronoides [...] "crow-shaped" [...] {{is derived from the}} Greek corone/κορόνη [...] "crow" [...] and eidos/είδος [...] "shape" [...] or [...] "form". The two naturalists regarded the Australian raven as very similar in appearance to the carrion crow (C. corone) of Europe, though they noted it was larger with a longer bill. They did <b>not</b> <b>give</b> <b>it</b> a common name. The location where the type specimen was collected is not recorded, but thought to be in the Parramatta district. Christian Ludwig Brehm described Corvus affinis in 1845, later determined to be this species. In his 1865 Handbook to the Birds of Australia, John Gould recognised only one species of corvid in Australia, Corvus australis, which he called the white-eyed crow. He used Johann Friedrich Gmelin's 1788 name, which predated Vigors and Horsfield's description. In 1877 Richard Bowdler Sharpe recognised two species, but recorded that the feather bases of the type specimen of C. coronoides were white. He named C. coronoides as the [...] "crow" [...] and C. australis (as Corone australis) the [...] "raven". Scottish naturalist William Robert Ogilvie-Grant corrected this in 1912 after re-examining the type specimen, clarifying the species as C. coronoides (raven, and incorporating little and forest ravens) and C. cecilae (Torresian crow).|$|E
