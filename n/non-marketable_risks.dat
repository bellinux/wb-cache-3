5000|$|In {{addition}} to traditional export credit, Delcredere | Ducroireâ€™s offer includes insurance of import prefinancing, domestic trade credit insurance for projects of exporting companies, {{foreign direct investment}} insurance, insurance of contract guarantees (bonds), financial guarantees, direct financing for limited amounts as well as credit, surety and political risk reinsurance[...] To comply with EU competition rules, Delcredere | Ducroire along with other export credit agencies, needs to make {{a clear distinction between}} marketable and <b>non-marketable</b> <b>risks</b> when providing short-term risk coveragee. This leads {{to the creation of a}} private limited liability company: Credimundi. Credimundi has its headquarters in Brussels and branch offices in London, Paris, Wiesbaden and Milan and a subsidiary in Prague: KUPEG (which in turn has a branch office in Bratislava).|$|E
40|$|Export {{guarantees}} {{are among}} the few tools left for an active economic policy to promote foreign trade. Under international agreements, which are in place since 1996, guarantees have been restricted to <b>non-marketable</b> <b>risks.</b> As a result, the total volume of guarantees has been stagnating in recent years. Nevertheless, there is clear evidence for {{the positive effect of}} guarantees on the export volume in Austria from the calculation of a positive export multiplier and the simulation of a WIFO Macro Model.

40|$|Through {{this paper}} we analyze {{the demand for}} assets in {{presence}} of a dependent background risk (informational asymmetries, political risk, "noisy traders", investment constraints, moral hazard, cross border <b>risk,</b> market <b>risk,</b> <b>non-marketable</b> assets, [...] ). The desirability of the risky asset is pointed out and {{also the fact that}} the demand is monotonously decreasing in the degree of dependence in a specified interval by the use of stochastic variation. Negative dependence is enough to guarantee that investors will take more risky asset even if the expected excess return is null, and this result is reversed in case of positive one. The convexity of the marginal utility is enough to guarantee that the fraction of wealth optimally invested in the risky asset is unambiguously larger (smaller) for wealthier individuals when the dependence is negative (positive). The aim {{of this paper is to}} develop an analytical framework for investment decision making in globalize international financial markets. To this end we will use some results coming from the area of risk theory. We will also show how this framework can be applied to the particular case of noisy markets. Our attention will be focused on the dependence between the risky asset and the background risk...|$|R
