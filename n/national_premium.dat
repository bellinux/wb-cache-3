5000|$|WMGF was, for a time, an {{affiliate}} of the Delilah After Dark and John Tesh syndicated radio shows. Both were dropped in Fall 2010. Nights and weekends, the station adopted Clear Channel's Premium Choice music service. The station's playlist was coordinated with the <b>national</b> <b>Premium</b> Choice playlist around the clock, which gave the station a more uptempo sound. Around Fall 2011, the station had its playlist return to local programming.|$|E
50|$|Medicare {{beneficiaries}} {{who were}} eligible for but did not enroll in a Part D {{when they were first}} eligible and later want to enroll, pay a late-enrollment penalty, basically a premium surtax, if they did not have creditable coverage through another source such as an employer or the U.S. Veterans Administration. This penalty is equal to 1% of the <b>national</b> <b>premium</b> index times the number of full calendar months that they {{were eligible for}} but not enrolled in Part D and did not have creditable coverage through another source. The penalty raises the premium of Part D for beneficiaries, when and if they elect coverage.|$|E
5000|$|When First Choice, as TMN {{was then}} known as, was {{launched}} on February 1, 1983, it operated as a <b>national</b> <b>premium</b> service; the network's original slogan was [...] "Look Out for Number One!

[...] The network inaugurated programming with a two-hour promotional reel announcing the programming that First Choice would carry, {{followed by a}} replay of The Who's farewell tour concert special; the airing of The Who concert which had been aired live on other channels in Canada the year before, {{as well as the}} two-hour promotional ad had several critics wondering about the channel's claims that it would be commercial-free and not play reruns. These programs were followed by first movie ever to be broadcast on First Choice, For Your Eyes Only.|$|E
50|$|Under the {{new system}} when the JPS was {{launched}} in January 2010, the organization is allowed to delegate to the National Tax Agency authority to forcibly collect unpaid pension premiums, but {{this has not been}} occurring. Analysts attributed it to squabbles between the Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare, under which the JPS operates, and the Ministry of Finance, under which the National Tax Agency works. The ratio of people continuing to pay their <b>national</b> pension <b>premiums</b> has been dropping, falling to 56% as of October 2011. The number of companies failing to make pension payments hit 162,400 nationwide in 2010.|$|R

40|$|One of {{the major}} {{objectives}} of the <b>national</b> <b>Premium</b> Grains for Livestock Program (PGLP) is to develop rapid methods for measuring the determinants of grain quality relevant to the nutritional requirements of ruminants, pigs and poultry. This paper provides a brief update {{on the development of}} NIR calibrations for a range of chemical, physical, in vitro and in vivo analyses. The major emphasis in this section of the PGLP from now on will be the implementation of NIR tests at strategic locations within the grain and animal industries. This would allow the test results to be used for pricing grains in accordance with their suitability as an animal feed, and also as a real time decision tool in grain utilisation and diet formulation...|$|E

50|$|Research {{has found}} that some {{retailers}} believe that, while advertising by <b>premium</b> <b>national</b> brands brings shoppers to the store, the retailer typically makes more profit by selling the shopper a store brand.

50|$|Even {{with all}} their success in their {{healthcare}} system, Taiwan has suffered many misfortunes. The government is not taking in enough money to cover the services it provides, so it is borrowing money from banks. The revenue base is capped so it does not {{keep pace with the}} increase in <b>national</b> income. <b>Premiums</b> are regulated by politicians and they are afraid to raise premiums because of voters. There is a low doctor-to-population ratio resulting in too many patients depending on too few doctors. Patients visit the doctor more frequently causing doctors to keep visits short to about 2 to 5 minutes per patient. There is no system to regulate systematic reporting of clinical performance, patient outcomes and adverse events, thus leading to a lower quality of care compared to other countries like the U.S. and Canada.|$|R
40|$|The {{literature}} {{contains a}} wide range of reported values for the content of most chemical constituents of feed grains and meals. It is not possible to assess accurately how much of this variation is due to genotypic and environmental factors and how much to differences in methodologies between laboratories. We have reviewed the literature for the preparation and analysis of feed grains (cereals, legumes, and oilseeds) and made recommendations for procedures considered to give the most accurate and reliable results. Recommendations are also made for a quality assurance scheme, an inter-laboratory evaluation program, and the use of reference materials. Australia-wide adoption of these practices should ensure that any future variations observed can be ascribed to genotype and/or environment. This review is part of a <b>national</b> <b>premium</b> feed grains quality project which, in turn, is part of a program to provide more accurate and reliable information about the true value of our feed grains to the domestic and international feeds industries...|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of the work is}} to test the existence of differences in earnings between salaried jobs and self-generated jobs in the labor markets of Peru. To this purpose it uses data from household surveys from 2007 to 2011. Also it uses non-parametric and semi-parametric methods for premium estimates (propensity score matching, double difference and double difference with matching). The use of 3 different methods and the use of several datasets that combines cross-section and panel samples, provide robustness to the results. The findings suggest the existence of segmentation between these two types of jobs. The calculations were made for different population samples: national, by sex and by area of residence. At <b>national</b> level <b>premiums</b> are in the range of 35 - 53 % depending on the method used. Among women and residents of rural areas the premiums are larger...|$|R
40|$|Abstract This study {{examines}} the redistributional {{effects of the}} National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) using a <b>national</b> database of <b>premium,</b> coverage, and claim payments at the county level between 1980 and 2006. Measuring progressivity as the departure from per capita county income proportionality we find that NFIP premiums are weakly regressive {{on an annual basis}} but become proportional as the time horizon is extended beyond a single year. In contrast, we find that NFIP claim payments are moderately progressive over all time horizons studied. In sum, we find no evidence that the NFIP disproportionally advantages richer counties...|$|R
40|$|Background/AimsThe Korean {{government}} has expanded {{the coverage of}} the national insurance scheme for four major diseases: cancers, cardiovascular diseases, cerebrovascular diseases, and rare diseases. This policy may have a detrimental effect on the budget of the national health insurance agency. Like taxes, <b>national</b> insurance <b>premiums</b> are levied {{on the basis of the}} income or wealth of the insured. MethodsUsing a preference elicitation method, we attempted to estimate how much people are willing to pay for insurance premiums that would expand their coverage for liver cancer treatment. ResultsWe calculated the marginal willingness to pay (MWTP) through the marginal rate of substitution between the two attributes of the insurance premium and the total annual treatment cost by adopting conditional logit and mixed logit models. ConclusionsThe effects of various other terms that could interact with socioeconomic status were also estimated, such as gender, income level, educational attainment, age, employment status, and marital status. The estimated MWTP values of the monthly insurance premium for liver cancer treatment range from 4, 130 KRW to 9, 090 KRW...|$|R
