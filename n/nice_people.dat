500|$|Halperin {{concludes that}} the Scientology {{organization}} is more focused on money than on other issues: [...] "I pretty much found that everything about the church is about making {{as much money as}} possible, which doesn't really make them much different from most other religions. I have to be honest and admit I also met some <b>nice</b> <b>people</b> in the church. It's just that I have a huge problem with their discriminatory attitude toward gays." [...] Halperin disputes Andrew Morton's claim in his book [...] that actor Tom Cruise is second in command of the organization, instead asserting Cruise is actually in the top position of leadership.|$|E

500|$|In 1985, Dale {{was cast}} in the {{continuing}} role of Jim Robinson in the Australian soap opera Neighbours, earning him acclaim across the world, including the United Kingdom. He appeared on the show from the first episode and stayed for eight years before his character was killed off in 1993. He found working on Neighbours [...] "exciting" [...] and it enabled him to provide for his sons, but he noted: [...] "You were a totally replaceable commodity; [...] didn't put any value {{on any of the}} people appearing in the show." [...] He expanded: [...] "I didn't like it there, they were not <b>nice</b> <b>people.</b> When we decided that we hated each other, the company and me, {{one of the things the}} company did was to market everything they could out of us and pay us nothing."

[...] Another scene featuring the Applewhite family, in which Betty brings food to a prisoner in their basement, was cut from this episode but was used in the second season premiere, [...] "Next". Cherry's inspiration for the Lynette storyline came from his own childhood experience when his mother returned to work.

Felicity Huffman expressed satisfaction with how her storyline was handled, explaining that Lynette [...] "didn't deal with [...] in the most straightforward way, but she was fighting for her family. They were noble motives." [...] While discussing the courtroom scene in which Carlos attacks John, Ricardo Antonio Chavira commented: [...] "People can see the full rage that is in my character. I'm yelling at him, 'I'm gonna kill you'... Then I broke into Spanish: [...] "Yo voy a matar!"... I just went for it... Then I looked, and Jesse [...] had the most honest look of sheer terror.

2500|$|Bosley Crowther, {{writing for}} The New York Times, complimented {{some of the}} actors, {{including}} Stewart and Reed, but concluded that [...] "the weakness of this picture, from this reviewer's point of view, is the sentimentality of it—its illusory concept of life.

[...] At the same time, Joan Rivers was quoted as saying: [...] "Two years ago, when I hosted a benefit for AIDS, I couldn't get one major star to turn out. ... Rock's admission is a horrendous way to bring AIDS {{to the attention of}} the American public, but by doing so, Rock, in his life, has helped millions in the process. What Rock has done takes true courage." [...] Morgan Fairchild said that [...] "Rock Hudson's death gave AIDS a face." [...] In a telegram Hudson sent to a September 1985 Hollywood AIDS benefit, Commitment to Life, which he was too ill to attend in person, Hudson said: [...] "I am not happy that I am sick.

Haye started his ambition and passion for boxing at old-school boxing gym Fitzroy Lodge Boxing Club in Lambeth, South London, where he quickly impressed and confidently won his first amateur bouts. Mick Carney, who ran the gym where David began training from 10 years old, said of Haye: [...] "He could whack as a kid. I think he chinned about three kids.

[...] Of his upbringing, he described Haye as [...] "a lovely kid. He comes from a beautiful, loving family. He wasn't on the streets. He went to school, came to the gym, went home.

5000|$|... ==You {{meet the}} <b>nicest</b> <b>people</b> on a Honda== In June 1963 in US media, Honda began the 12-year-long {{advertising}} campaign [...] "You meet the <b>nicest</b> <b>people</b> on a Honda", created by Grey Advertising. Grey {{had bought the}} idea from a UCLA undergraduate student, who had created the concept for a class assignment. The event {{marked the beginning of}} the decline of domestic and British motorcycle brands in the US market, and the rise of Honda and the other Japanese companies. In December 1965, Edward Turner said the sale of small Japanese motorcycles was good for BSA, by attracting new riders who would graduate to larger machines, not anticipating that the Japanese would advance over the next 5 years to directly threaten British bikes with technically sophisticated models such as the Honda CB750, and the Kawasaki Z1. As a case study in business and marketing, the campaign is still remembered half a century later, with one strategic management textbook saying, [...] "Honda and the Supercub is probably the best known and most debated case in business strategy." [...] It was credited with having [...] "invented the concept of lifestyle marketing." ...|$|R
