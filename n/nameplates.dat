5|$|The {{base of the}} Conn Smythe Trophy {{has been}} {{expanded}} twice {{over the years to}} accommodate more winners. Although the 16 <b>nameplates</b> on the original base tier were filled up after , a new tier was not added until the 1983-84 season. Following the 2000 Stanley Cup Finals, the 20 <b>nameplates</b> on the new tier were filled up, so the first nine winners' <b>nameplates</b> were moved up to the remaining three sides of the foundation tier, with the remaining <b>nameplates</b> shifted accordingly to keep the winners in chronological order. Due to the cancellation of the 2004-05 season, the trophy wasn't filled up again until , after which a new tier was added, making room for 24 more names.|$|E

5|$|First {{unveiled}} {{in a single}} uppercase weight in 1928, Gill Sans achieved national prominence almost immediately, when it was chosen the following year to become the standard typeface for the LNER railway system, soon appearing on every facet of the company's identity, from metal locomotive <b>nameplates</b> and hand-painted station signage to printed restaurant car menus, timetables and advertising posters.|$|E

50|$|This {{generation}} {{marked the}} only generation in Canada {{to have the}} GTI as a separate <b>nameplate</b> rather than a trim of the Golf. When Volkswagen announced {{the revival of the}} Golf in the United States & Canada for the 2010 model year, Volkswagen reverted the GTI <b>nameplate</b> as a Golf trim, although the GTI remains a separate <b>nameplate</b> in the United States.|$|R
5|$|Other {{relics of}} both classes that have survived are <b>nameplates,</b> which were removed {{towards the end}} of steam on the British Railways Southern Region in the 1960s. As a result, many exist in private collections, and several have been seen at auction, selling for several {{thousands}} of pounds.|$|E
5|$|The non-streamlined Nos. 6230–6234 {{were painted}} {{in a special}} version of the {{standard}} crimson lake livery. The locomotives were lined out in gold bordered with fine red lines. Serif lettering and numerals in gold leaf and vermillion shading were applied. Handrails and sundry small external fittings were chrome-plated, as were the <b>nameplates,</b> which had a black background.|$|E
5|$|Coach 2, used as {{a summer}} house, is on display (unrestored) at the National Railway Museum York along with the <b>nameplates</b> of the {{original}} locomotives. Coach 15, recovered from Snapper Halt in 1959 and restored by the Ffestiniog Railway in North Wales, has been running there (now as FR Coach 14) for longer than it did on the L Due to the Ffestiniog's smaller loading gauge, the roof profile was altered so it can pass through Garnedd tunnel. In September 2010, Coach 15 visited the L with the Lew replica loco, Lyd.|$|E
50|$|The <b>nameplate</b> {{design for}} the 1958 Diesel {{was based on the}} Cornish Riviera Limited <b>nameplate</b> and was drawn in 1957 by Tom Stanton, aged 26, at the Swindon Drawing Office.|$|R
50|$|For 1978, the Ventura <b>nameplate</b> was {{retired and}} all X-body cars were sold under the Phoenix <b>nameplate</b> through {{that year and}} into 1979 with a {{top-line}} Phoenix SJ designated as the top-line series.|$|R

5|$|Once {{it became}} clear that the {{locomotives}} would be used further afield than the West Country, a decision was made to name the remainder after RAF squadrons, airfields, commanders and aircraft that had participated in the Battle of Britain over Kent, Surrey and Sussex. 'Battle of Britain' <b>nameplates</b> incorporated the name of the locomotive with the class name below, in a design that resembled the wings of an aircraft. This was painted Air Force blue, though other colours were sometimes substituted for the same reasons as above. An enamelled crest of the aircraft, personality or squadron was placed below the nameplate, in the same position as the West Country class equivalent.|$|E
5|$|The {{second and}} fourth batches of {{streamlined}} locomotives, Nos. 6225–6229 and 6235–6244, were painted in crimson lake, with banding in gold lined with vermilion and black. <b>Nameplates</b> had a black background. LMS shop grey was carried briefly in service on No. 6229 Duchess of Hamilton from 7 September 1938 until its return to Crewe Works later that year. It was then painted crimson lake and disguised as No. 6220, {{in preparation for the}} 1939 visit to the New York World's Fair. Lettering and numerals for both Caledonian blue and crimson lake liveries were in a newly created style of unshaded sans-serif.|$|E
5|$|Earlier restorations had {{all left}} their {{marks on the}} frescoes. To {{counteract}} the whitening caused by salination, animal fat and vegetable oil had been applied, which effectively made the salt crystals transparent, but left a sticky layer that accumulated dirt. An additional problem, most obvious in the small putti which hold the <b>nameplates</b> on the pendentives, was saltpetre seeping through small cracks and appearing as dark rings on the surface. Unlike the white crystalline salt deposits, this could not be removed and the staining was irreversible. Layers of varnish and glue had been applied to many areas. This had darkened and become opaque. Restorers had repainted details over the darkened areas in order to define the features of figures. This was particularly {{the case for the}} lunettes, spandrels and lower parts of the pendentives.|$|E
50|$|The third Cutlass <b>nameplate</b> {{introduced}} was {{the compact}} Cutlass Calais (originally just Oldsmobile Calais) on the front-wheel-drive N-body in 1985. The famed 4-4-2 <b>nameplate</b> was revived for the Cutlass Calais in 1990 and 1991.|$|R

5|$|Upon {{entering}} the Ellwood House, guests of Isaac or Perry Ellwood {{would have been}} greeted or formally welcomed {{by members of the}} family. After Perry Ellwood inherited the house in 1910 the entry parlor began to become known as the library. Prominent among the library's features is a carved Italian marble mantle with a large gilt mirror hung above it. The library's bookshelves are cast in a Neo-Italian Renaissance style and constructed of fine mahogany. Presently filling the shelves in the Ellwood House are a large collection of books with Ellwood family <b>nameplates.</b> Near the library window, which is adorned with its original walnut shutters, is an 1890s French statue. The statue was donated to the Ellwood House Association from someone in Sycamore who bequeathed it to the museum.|$|E
5|$|Lexus' {{arrival in}} the Japanese market in July 2005 marked the first {{introduction}} of a Japanese premium car marque in the domestic market. New generation LS, IS, ES, GS, and RX models subsequently became available in Japan along with the SC 430, ending domestic sales of Toyota-branded models under the Celsior, Altezza, Windom, Aristo, Harrier, and Soarer <b>nameplates,</b> respectively. The Altezza and Aristo were previously exclusive to Japanese Toyota retail sales channels called Toyota Vista Store, the Windom was exclusive to Toyota Corolla Store, the Celsior and Harrier were exclusive to Toyopet Store, and the Soarer was previously available at both Toyota Store and Toyopet Store locations. Lexus models sold in Japan featured higher specifications and a price premium compared with their discontinued Toyota counterparts. Sales for the first half-year were slower than expected, affected by the contraction of the domestic auto market and price increases, but improved in subsequent months with an expanded lineup.|$|E
5|$|The UAAI badge-engineered cars first {{introduced}} in 1989 sold in far fewer numbers than anticipated, but the Holden Commodore, Toyota Camry, and Corolla were all successful when sold under their original <b>nameplates.</b> The first generation Nova and the donor Corolla were produced at Holden's Dandenong, Victoria facility until 1994. UAAI was dissolved in 1996, and Holden returned to selling only GM products. The Holden Astra and Vectra, both designed by Opel in Germany, replaced the Toyota-sourced Holden Nova and Apollo. This {{came after the}} 1994 introduction of the Opel Corsa replacing the already available Suzuki Swift as the source for the Holden Barina. Sales of the full-size Holden Suburban SUV sourced from Chevrolet commenced in 1998—lasting until 2001. Also in 1998, local assembly of the Vectra began at Elizabeth, South Australia. These cars were exported to Japan and Southeast Asia with Opel badges. However, the Vectra did not achieve sufficient sales in Australia to justify local assembly, and reverted to being fully imported in 2000.|$|E
50|$|The Ambassador <b>nameplate</b> {{was used}} {{continuously}} from 1927 until 1974 (the name being a top-level trim line between 1927 and 1931); {{at the time}} it was discontinued, Ambassador was the longest continuously used <b>nameplate</b> in automotive history.|$|R
5000|$|One {{confounding}} factor with estimating plug load energy use is {{the discrepancy between}} the rated or <b>nameplate</b> energy power consumption and the actual average power consumption, which can be as little as 10-15% of the <b>nameplate</b> value.|$|R
5000|$|The Nissan Clipper <b>nameplate</b> {{has been}} used for two {{separate}} commercial vehicle ranges of kei trucks in Japan.

The <b>nameplate</b> was revived again in late 2013 for a relabelled version of the Suzuki Carry and Every.|$|R

25|$|To prevent {{information}} {{identifying the}} Oscar winners from leaking {{ahead of the}} ceremony, Oscar statuettes presented at the ceremony have blank baseplates. Until 2010, winners were expected to return the statuettes to the Academy after the ceremony and wait several weeks to have inscriptions applied. Since 2010, winners have {{had the option of}} having engraved <b>nameplates</b> applied to their statuettes at an inscription-processing station at the Governor's Ball, a party held immediately after the Oscar ceremony. In 2010, the R.S. Owens company made 197 engraved <b>nameplates</b> ahead of the ceremony, bearing the names of every potential winner. The 175 or so <b>nameplates</b> for non-winning nominees were recycled afterwards.|$|E
