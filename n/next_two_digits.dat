5000|$|Flat 12 (boxer) models {{used the}} {{displacement}} in litres {{for the first}} digit {{and the number of}} cylinders for the <b>next</b> <b>two</b> <b>digits.</b> Therefore, the BB 512 was five litre flat 12 (a Berlinetta Boxer, in this case). However, the original Berlinetta Boxer was the 365 GT4 BB, which was named in a similar manner to the V12 models.|$|E
50|$|For new {{vehicles}} another scheme was used. In 1954 {{a new system}} was introduced for the fast Ganz (DR Class VT 12.14) railcars imported from Hungary. After the class letters 'VT' the <b>next</b> <b>two</b> <b>digits</b> indicated the top speed divided by 10. The average axle load followed, separated by a full stop.

50|$|The first number (1-9) {{relates to}} the German wine region where the wine was {{produced}} and tested (e.g. 3-Rheingau). The second 2 or 3 digit number indicates the village of the vineyard (e.g. 30-Rauenthal)). The <b>next</b> <b>two</b> <b>digits</b> represents the particular wine estate (e.g. 50-Kloster Eberbach). The following 2 to 3 digit number is the sequential order that the wine was submitted by that producer for testing (e.g. 031 - this was the 31st wine submitted by Kloster Eberbach for testing). The final two digits is {{the year of the}} testing, which is normally the year following the vintage (e.g. 04 - the wine was tested in 2004).|$|E
50|$|Military {{vehicles}} have {{a unique}} numbering system unlike any other licence numbers. The numbers are registered by the Ministry of Defence in New Delhi. The first (or the third) character is an upward-pointing arrow. This {{is known as a}} Broad Arrow, whose origins lie in the UK Office of Ordnance and is still used {{in many parts of the}} British Commonwealth on assorted army items, not just vehicles. The <b>next</b> <b>two</b> <b>digits</b> (or the two succeeding the arrow) signify the year in which the Military procured the vehicle. The next is the base code, followed by the serial number. The letter ending after the serial number indicates the class of the vehicle (e.g. ↑10A266162W).|$|E
50|$|The tire {{date code}} {{mandated}} by the US DOTis a 4 digit date code WWYY with <b>two</b> <b>digits</b> of the week number WW followed by the last <b>two</b> <b>digits</b> of the calendar year YY.|$|R
50|$|The Unique Master Citizen Number is {{composed}} of 13 digits (DDMMYYYRRSSSC) arranged in six groups: <b>two</b> <b>digits</b> (DD) for the citizen's day of birth, <b>two</b> <b>digits</b> (MM) {{for the month of}} birth, last three digits (YYY) of the year of birth, <b>two</b> <b>digits</b> (RR) as a registry number, three digits (SSS) as a combination of the citizen's sex and ordinal number of birth, and one digit (C) as a control number.|$|R
50|$|Season 10 {{introduced}} a new episode numbering system. Previous seasons had been numbered in three digit format using the season number (1-9) as the first digit, and the episode number making up the last <b>two</b> <b>digits.</b> So, for example, the third episode of the 4th season would be episode number 403. Starting with this season, episodes numbers consisted of four digits with the first <b>two</b> <b>digits</b> representing the last <b>two</b> <b>digits</b> {{of the year in}} which the season first aired and the last <b>two</b> <b>digits</b> representing the episode number within that season. So, the fourth episode of the 10th season, having first aired in 1998, would be episode number 9804.|$|R
5000|$|After NOAA {{took over}} the former Coast and Geodetic Survey fleet in 1970 along with {{research}} vessels of other government agencies, it adopted {{a new system of}} ship classification. In its system, the NOAA fleet is divided into two broad categories, research ships and survey ships. The research ships, which include oceanographic and fisheries research vessels, are given hull numbers beginning with [...] "R", while the survey ships, generally hydrographic survey vessels, receive hull numbers beginning with [...] "S". The letter is followed by a three-digit number; the first digit indicates the NOAA [...] "class" [...] (i.e., size) of the vessel, which NOAA assigns based on the ship's gross tonnage and horsepower, while the <b>next</b> <b>two</b> <b>digits</b> combine with the first digit to create a unique three-digit identifying number for the ship.|$|E
50|$|All living Icelanders, {{as well as}} {{all foreign}} {{citizens}} with permanent residence in Iceland, have a personal identification number (kennitala) identifying them in the National Registry. This number is composed of 10 digits, whereof the first six are made up of the individual's birth date in the format DDMMYY. The <b>next</b> <b>two</b> <b>digits</b> are chosen at random when the kennitala is allocated, the 9th digit is a check digit, and the last digit indicates the period of one hundred years in which the individual was born (for instance, '9' for the period 1900-1999). An example would be 120192-3389. While similar, all-inclusive personal registries exist in other countries, the use of the national registry is unusually extensive in Iceland. For example, video rentals register their customers using the registry identification numbers. It is worth noting that the completeness of the National Registry eliminates any need for census to be performed.|$|E
50|$|At {{the time}} of Lola's creation, their sports cars and formula cars {{followed}} a naming scheme of being numbered in order of construction, and preceded by the term Mark (Mk1 through Mk6). However, in 1964, the designations were altered to become Type (marked as simply T), with the first digit or two designating what type of car, and the final digit designating a variant of that car. This continued until 1986 when the numbering scheme was slightly altered. The T would remain, yet the <b>next</b> <b>two</b> <b>digits</b> would designate the year of original design, and the next two would designate what type of car it was. The final digit would again denote variants of that design. This was again slightly altered in 1998, with the T being replaced by a B, in honor of Lola's owner Martin Birrane. The numbering system would however remain the same.|$|E
50|$|The {{semiconductor}} package {{date code}}is often a 4 digit date code YYWW {{where the first}} <b>two</b> <b>digits</b> YY are the last 2 digits of the calendar year and the last <b>two</b> <b>digits</b> WW are the two-digit week number.|$|R
