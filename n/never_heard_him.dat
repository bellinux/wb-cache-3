5|$|To address his problems, Cho's {{parents also}} {{took him to}} church. According to a pastor at the Centreville Korean Presbyterian Church, Cho was a smart student who {{understood}} the Bible, but {{he was concerned about}} Cho's difficulty in speaking to people. The pastor added that, until he saw the video that Cho sent to NBC News, he <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> <b>him</b> say a complete sentence. The pastor also recalled that he told Cho's mother that he speculated Cho was autistic and he asked her to take him to a hospital, but she declined.|$|E
5|$|McGugin {{took time}} off from {{coaching}} {{to work in the}} mining business during the First World War. On a draft registration card completed in 1918, McGugin stated that he was the president of the Kensee Mining Company in Marion, Kentucky. On August 10, 1918, while on protection patrol, Rabbit Curry was killed in an aerial combat over Perles, France. After learning about Curry's death McGugin wired this telegram to The Tennessean:During the four years of my intimate association with Irby Curry, I <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> <b>him</b> utter a word his mother might not hear and approve. A game sportsman and scholar, truly he was gentle as a dove. He had a lion's heart, and now a hero's death. Poor Little Rabbit! How he pulls at the heart-strings of all of us who knew him and therefore honored and loved him tenderly.|$|E
500|$|While Wellington and Jack {{had a solid}} relationship, Tim and Wellington {{frequently}} clashed. [...] "Wellington Mara {{lives the}} spiritual life." [...] Former Giant Frank Gifford later recalled. [...] "I <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> <b>him</b> utter a swear word. He goes to mass almost every day and has put all eleven of his children through catholic colleges. That's Well's life: his family, his church, and his Giants." [...] Tim, however, had two ex-wives and lived a more outgoing, laid back lifestyle.|$|E
6000|$|... 'No, doctor; I wish it 'ad. I shouldn't 'ave thought {{anything}} of that; there's something natural {{in a man}} talking about stocks and shares and trousers, but I've <b>never</b> <b>'eard</b> <b>'im</b> say anything like this before. He was always a wonderfully steady man.' ...|$|R
60|$|SIR PATRICK. Bernard Shaw? I <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> of <b>him.</b> He's a Methodist preacher, I suppose.|$|R

500|$|Ford was {{the only}} person to hold the {{president}}ial office without being elected as either president or vice-president. The choice of Ford to fulfill Spiro Agnew's vacated role as vice president was based on Ford's reputation for openness and honesty. [...] "In all the years I sat in the House, I never knew Mr. Ford to make a dishonest statement nor a statement part-true and part-false. He never attempted to shade a statement, and I <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> <b>him</b> utter an unkind word," [...] said Martha Griffiths.|$|E
500|$|After {{the end of}} {{the four}} day engagement, Deke's {{management}} is offered a one-man show in Freegate, Texas, outside of Dallas. Due to the terms of the contract, Tex fires Susan and the singing trio, leaving only Deke in the show. Before he has to begin his new tour, Deke drives Susan to her family's farm. Meanwhile, in another publicity move, Glenda convinces Tex to buy a Imperial against his life insurance for Deke, inventing a story to tell Deke that it was a gift from the widow of an oil magnate. Back on the farm, Deke and Susan talk, where she tells him about being fired, after which they are about to kiss, when they are interrupted by her parents, who ask him to sing the song he promised. After Deke sings [...] "Loving You", a surprised Susan remarks that she <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> <b>him</b> sing that way; Deke admits that he never felt that way before.|$|E
500|$|As to his {{national}}ism, {{he wished}} to see Scotland {{on an equal footing}} with other nations. His national pride was intense; in a Preparatory Note to The Voyage of the Scotia he wrote: [...] "While 'Science' was the talisman of the Expedition, 'Scotland' was emblazoned on its flag". This insistence on emphasising the Scottish character of his enterprises could be irksome to those who did not share his passion. However, he retained the respect and devotion of those whom he led, and of those who had known him longest. John Arthur Thomson, who had known Bruce since Granton, wrote of him when reviewing Rudmose Brown's 1923 biography: [...] "We <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> <b>him</b> once grumble about himself, though he was neither to hold or bend when he thought some injustice was being done to, or slight cast on, his men, on his colleagues, on his laboratory, on his Scotland. Then one got glimpses of the volcano which his gentle spirit usually kept sleeping".|$|E
60|$|Hodder, who {{had listened}} in amazement, {{glanced at the}} banker. He had <b>never</b> before <b>heard</b> <b>him</b> opposed, or seen him really angry.|$|R
60|$|I {{made another}} shameful confession. Either I had {{forgotten}} Lord Uppercliff, during my long absence abroad, or I had <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> of <b>him.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "It is strange," [...] replied Elinor, in a {{most painful}} perplexity, [...] "that I should <b>never</b> have <b>heard</b> <b>him</b> even mention your name." ...|$|R
2500|$|Contemporary {{opinions}} of Mussorgsky as a composer and person varied from positive to ambiguous to negative. Mussorgsky's eventual supporters, Stasov and Balakirev, initially registered strongly negative {{impressions of the}} composer. Stasov wrote Balakirev, in an 1863 letter, [...] "I have no use for Mussorgsky. His views may tally with mine, but I have <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> <b>him</b> express an intelligent idea. All in him is flabby, dull. He is, it seems to me, a thorough idiot", and Balakirev agreed: [...] "Yes, Mussorgsky is little short of an idiot." ...|$|E
2500|$|It {{was also}} claimed that one Sunday Liddell {{refereed}} a hockey match {{to stop fighting}} amongst the players, as he was trusted not to take sides. One of his fellow internees, Norman Cliff, later {{wrote a book about}} his experiences in the camp called [...] "The Courtyard of the Happy Way" [...] (Chinese 樂道院, also translated as [...] "The Campus of Loving Truth"), which detailed the remarkable characters in the camp. Cliff described Liddell as [...] "the finest Christian gentleman it has been my pleasure to meet. In {{all the time in the}} camp, I <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> <b>him</b> say a bad word about anybody". Langdon Gilkey, who also survived the camp and became a prominent theologian in his native America, said of Liddell: [...] "Often in an evening I would see him bent over a chessboard or a model boat, or directing some sort of square dance– absorbed, weary and interested, pouring all of himself into this effort to capture the imagination of these penned-up youths. He was overflowing with good humour and love for life, and with enthusiasm and charm. It is rare indeed that a person has the good fortune to meet a saint, but he came as close to it as anyone I have ever known." ...|$|E
2500|$|He was {{the first}} to tell the {{audience}} that King had died; some of the attendees screamed and wailed in grief. Several of Kennedy's aides were even worried that the delivery of this information would result in a riot. When the audience quieted, Kennedy acknowledged that many would be filled with anger. He said: [...] "For {{those of you who are}} black and are tempted to be filled with hatred and mistrust of the injustice of such an act, against all white people, I would only say that I can also feel in my own heart the same kind of feeling. I had a member of my family killed, but he was killed by a white man." [...] These remarks surprised his aides, who had <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> <b>him</b> speak publicly of his brother's death. Kennedy said that the country had to make an effort to [...] "go beyond these rather difficult times", and quoted a poem by the Greek playwright Aeschylus, [...] "Even in our sleep, pain which cannot forget falls drop by drop upon the heart until, in our own despair, against our will, comes wisdom through the awful grace of God." [...] In conclusion, Kennedy said that the country needed and wanted unity between blacks and whites, and asked the audience members to pray for the King family and the country, quoting the Greeks again.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then you do {{not blame}} me?" [...] asked Campbell, with a subdued, almost deprecatory voice, such as Thurnall had <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> in <b>him</b> before.|$|R
6000|$|... 102. And {{now let me}} {{tell you}} {{something}} of his personal character. You have <b>heard</b> <b>him</b> spoken of as ill-natured, and jealous of his brother artists. I will tell you how jealous he was. I knew him for ten years, and during that time had much familiar intercourse with <b>him.</b> I <b>never</b> once <b>heard</b> <b>him</b> say an unkind thing of a brother artist, and I <b>never</b> once <b>heard</b> <b>him</b> find a fault with another man's work. I could say this of no other artist whom I have ever known.|$|R
60|$|VOICES: (Sighing) So he's gone. Ah yes. Yes, indeed. Bloom? <b>Never</b> <b>heard</b> of <b>him.</b> No? Queer kind of chap. There's the widow. That so? Ah, yes.|$|R
60|$|He {{was rather}} abrupt. Jemima Puddle-duck had <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> <b>him</b> speak like that.|$|E
60|$|He did {{not make}} any reply, but turned away homeward: I <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> <b>him</b> speak another word.|$|E
60|$|I had <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> <b>him</b> {{talk like}} this before. In his {{excitement}} {{he rose from}} the table, and commenced pacing the room.|$|E
6000|$|... "Prince Marvel?" [...] exclaimed the Baron. [...] "I have <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> of <b>him.</b> Does he {{come from}} the Kingdom of Dawna, or that of Auriel, or Plenta?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Is {{the doctor}} on board?" [...] he cried {{as he came}} up. [...] "Dr. Symonds, I mean? You <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> of <b>him?</b> Nor yet of the Trinity Hall? Ah!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. I had <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> of <b>him</b> as a boxer. Still, {{he seems}} {{very anxious to}} go down, and he {{certainly}} has one remarkable testimonial, and as there's no one else--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I have <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> <b>him</b> say that; but I think Mr. Gradfield does those things. Owen, I am afraid, is inexperienced as yet.' ...|$|E

60|$|She {{waited for}} my reply to this last inquiry with an {{appearance}} of anxiety that surprised me. I had <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> <b>him</b> speak of Low Lanes.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{never saw}} him before!" [...] cried Olive. [...] "I <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> of <b>him.</b> I don't {{understand}} anything about it. The whole thing shocked me, and I wanted to get on." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There must be no {{room for}} doubt. This is nonsense; sheer nonsense. I shall send to Mary." [...] George had <b>never</b> before <b>heard</b> <b>him</b> call Miss Baker by her Christian name.|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{should think}} not," [...] she answered, smiling. [...] "Dear old dad! I have <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> <b>him</b> say an unkind word {{to any one}} in my life." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Ha! he {{is a tough}} un," [...] {{observed}} Gaff, with {{a significant}} grin. [...] "I knows him well. He don't much care riskin' fellers' lives, though I <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> of <b>him</b> riskin' his own." ...|$|R
50|$|In December 1933, Sir Umar {{took him}} back to India. In 1935, he won a match against V. K. Khadilkar, {{yielding}} just one draw in ten games. The chess world <b>never</b> <b>heard</b> from <b>him</b> again.|$|R
