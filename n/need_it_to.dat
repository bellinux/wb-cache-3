25|$|In July 1773, {{responding}} {{to pressure from}} the new emperor, Pope Clement XIV dissolved the Jesuit Order and the university came under intensified state control. Several university buildings were taken over {{for use by the}} army, {{and by the end of}} the 1770s the university was left with only the St. Xavier's building (currently the Faculty of Theology). At the same time the main language was changed from Latin to German; the Czech language remained in use for lectures to trainee priests, who would <b>need</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> communicate with their congregations. Czech gained importance in the 1830s as part of the Czech National Revival.|$|E

Arizona tells her they will stay in to eat and they reconcile. Meredith tells Bailey and Derek's idea to Izzie: they give her their wedding. Yang becomes the maid of honor and Meredith serves as Alex's best man. Back at the hospital, Izzie is sad about her hair loss but Alex tells her she doesn't <b>need</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> be beautiful. The episode concludes with Izzie having shaved her head and telling Denny to leave as {{she wants to be}} alone with her husband.|$|E
25|$|The {{presence}} of powerful businesswomen—still a rare sight—in {{some of these}} groups helps get them heard. Prior to 2008, women {{were not allowed to}} enter hotels and furnished apartments without a chaperon or mahram. With a 2008 Royal Decree, however, the only requirement for a woman to be allowed to enter hotels is a national ID card, and the hotel must inform the nearest police station of their room reservation and length of stay; however, this happens with everybody staying in the hotel. In April 2010, a new, optional ID card for women was issued which allows them to travel in countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council. The cards include GPS tracking, fingerprints and features that make them difficult to forge. Women do not need male permission to apply for the card, but do <b>need</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> travel abroad. Proponents argue that new female identity cards enable a woman to carry out her activities with ease, and prevent forgeries committed in the name of women.|$|E

25|$|There are {{a number}} of reasons for low sales outside Japan. One main reason is that it takes some time for the {{customers}} {{to get used to the}} idea of a washlet. Sales in Japan were also slow when the device was introduced in 1980, but after some acclimatization, sales improved significantly starting in 1985. Around 1990, 10% of Japanese households had a washlet, and this number increased greatly to over 50% in 2002. Toto expects a corresponding improvement in foreign sales within the next few years. Another reason is the lack of a power supply near the toilet. While virtually all Japanese washrooms have an electric outlet behind the toilet, many foreign bathrooms do not have a nearby outlet. In Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, the UK, and many other countries, high current electrical outlets installed in close proximity to water, or where persons may be wet, are prohibited by legally enforced codes due to health and safety reasons. Finally the outlet of the toilet (for S-type toilets) is max. 10 ~ 15cm from back wall but Japanese toilets <b>need</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> be at least 30cm so a S-type European toilet cannot be replaced easily with a Japanese toilet. They are also much more expensive than traditional Western toilets. Finally, in Europe, there is the competition of the traditional Western bidet; conversely, North Americans are not accustomed to any sort of bidet.|$|E
500|$|Jay Z {{assisted}} him in {{the production}} of what would become his debut album Lupe Fiasco's Food & Liquor. The title of the album is a reference to 'Food and Liquor' stores common in Chicago. He explains, [...] "The store is where everything is at...Food to me represents growth and progression. You eat food and you get strength. You <b>need</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> live. Liquor is not a necessity; it is a want. It destroys you. It breaks you down. I can see why it's prohibited in Islam...I've always felt like liquor represents the bad, the food represents the good, and everyone is made up of a little of both." [...] Lupe Fiasco's Food & Liquor was officially released on September 19, 2006. The album featured production from Jay-Z, Kanye West, Mike Shinoda, The Neptunes, Prolyfic, among others. The record spawned the singles [...] "Kick, Push", [...] "I Gotcha" [...] and [...] "Daydreamin'" [...] featuring Jill Scott. The critically lauded album was later nominated for three Grammy Awards including Best Rap Album. Fiasco won [...] "Best Urban/Alternative Performance" [...] for [...] "Daydreamin'". In the same year, he was voted by GQ magazine as the [...] "Breakout Man of the Year." [...] He also received four BET Hip Hop Award nominations, and it made it to number eight on Billboard 200 and number two on Billboard Top R/Hip-Hop Albums chart. That same year he participated in the first Cypher at the BET Hip-Hop Awards.|$|E
500|$|Back at Nico’s apartment, Bruno {{reveals that}} the stolen key was the Key of Solomon; Susarro would <b>need</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> access a special armillary in an ancient building, the {{location}} of which is unknown. Whilst looking at the Omega Stone, George realises he saw the same symbol, {{in exactly the same}} style as the key, in the Congo, leading him and Nico to travel there and investigate. [...] The pair quickly find another stone with the alpha symbol upon it, and manage to evade Petra, who had come after them and the site. [...] Upon returning to Paris, the pair learn that Bruno had been captured whilst Nico's apartment was ransacked, and taken to Prague, leaving Nico to find out where exactly by returning to the abandoned theatre and searching it for clues, quickly finding out that he was taken to a large castle owned by Susarro. [...] Whilst there, they manage to track down Bruno, along with the discovery that the armillary is in Egypt, and that the Key of Solomon was taken by the St. Stefan chapter of the Knights Templar - a surviving remnant of the Templars that still exist, and known to Susarro. He promptly returns to Paris to confront them, while Bruno is taken to Egypt. George decides to track the St. Stefan chapter as well, and returns to Paris and the Montfauçon where they are based, only to arrive too late to stop their base being invaded. Despite finding bodies, George manages to find survivors of the attack, including the Preceptor for the chapter's temple. The Preceptor tasks George with stopping Susarro, revealing the key was taken from them, before handing over a third stone key needed to pinpoint the armillary, bearing a psi symbol on it, and knighting George.|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the main}} issues that the Brahimi report {{identifies}} {{is the lack of}} coordination and planning of the Peacekeeping Operations. Also, the difference between the objectives of the Peacekeeping Operations and the resources destined to fund the missions. Therefore, the report asks the Security Council to make clear the goals and the resources to accomplish them. [...] According to Fearon and Laitin, the Brahimi Report provides a political instrument for the secretary-general to negotiate with the Security Council the goals, the troops, and the resources <b>need</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the operations. This instrument tries to avoid the cases of underfunding presented in Missions such as in Bosnia, Somalia, and Sierra Leone.|$|E
