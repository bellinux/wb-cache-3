5|$|Although officially {{designated}} a tropical cyclone by the NHC, Météo-France, the French meteorological service, stated in their annual {{report to the}} World Meteorological Organization that Grace {{should not have been}} classified a tropical system. In their report, they argued that although the storm presented deep convection, an eye-like feature, and winds above 60mph (95km/h), the overall development of Grace was more similar to that of a mid-latitude <b>non-tropical</b> <b>cyclone.</b> However, operationally, Météo-France considered Grace to be a subtropical cyclone. They also criticized the NHC of warning upon this system based on recent trends of the link between global warming and increased hurricane activity.|$|E
5|$|Subtropical Storm Alpha (also called Alfa) {{was a rare}} {{off-season}} subtropical cyclone {{that hit}} Georgia in May 1972. It developed from a previously <b>non-tropical</b> <b>cyclone</b> in the western Atlantic Ocean, and initially it moved northeastward off the Carolinas. The storm turned southwestward due to a building ridge, and concurrently it intensified to become Subtropical Storm Alpha. It later moved ashore near Savannah, and it finally dissipated in the northeast Gulf of Mexico on May 29. It produced wave action and moderate rainfall along the coast. Damage totaled over $100,000 (1972USD), {{and there were two}} associated deaths.|$|E
50|$|Another {{significant}} system produced {{severe weather}} from September 21 to 23 across a large {{swath of the}} Midwestern and Southern United States.

2500|$|The 1966 Tampa tornado {{family was}} a deadly tornado family that {{affected}} the I-4 corridor in Central Florida from the Tampa Bay area to Brevard County on April 4, 1966. Two tornadoes affected the region, {{each of which}} featured a path length in excess of [...] One of the tornadoes produced estimated F4 damage on the Fujita scale; it remains {{one of only two}} F4 tornadoes to strike the U.S. state of Florida, the other of which occurred in 1958. Both F4 tornadoes occurred during El Niño years. Eleven people were killed across the state, including three in the city of Tampa and seven in Polk County. The F4 tornado remains the fourth-deadliest tornado event recorded in Florida; only tornadoes on March 1962, February 2007, and February 1998 caused more deaths in the state. All of the events were induced by <b>non-tropical</b> <b>cyclones.</b> The two tornadoes are officially listed as continuous events, but the tornadoes' damage paths did not cross the entire state, and downbursts may have been responsible for destruction near Lake Juliana and the Kissimmee–Saint Cloud area. However, the combination of tornado and downburst destruction was continuous in Central Florida.|$|R
5000|$|Heavy {{rainfall}} {{can lead}} to a number of hazards, most of which are floods or hazards resulting from floods. Flooding is the inundation of areas that are not normally under water. It is typically divided into three classes: River flooding, which relates to rivers rising outside their normals banks; flash flooding, which is the process where a landscape, often in urban and arid environments, is subjected to rapid floods; and coastal flooding, which can be caused by strong winds from tropical or <b>non-tropical</b> <b>cyclones.</b> Meteorologically, excessive rains occur within a plume of air with high amounts of moisture (also known as an atmospheric river) which is directed around an upper level cold-core low or a tropical cyclone. [...] Flash flooding can frequently occur in slow-moving thunderstorms and are usually caused by the heavy liquid precipitation that accompanies it. Flash floods are most common in dense populated urban environments, where less plants and bodies of water are presented to absorb and contain the extra water. Flash flooding can be hazardous to small infrastructure, such as bridges, and weakly constructed buildings. Plants and crops in agricultural areas can be destroyed and devastated by the force of raging water. Automobiles parked within experiencing areas can also be displaced. Soil erosion can occur as well, exposing risks of landslide phenomena. Like all forms of flooding phenomenon, flash flooding can also spread and produce waterborne and insect-borne diseases cause by microorganisms. Flash flooding can be caused by extensive rainfall released by tropical cyclones of any strength or the sudden thawing effect of ice dams.|$|R
40|$|Mauritius is {{a typical}} {{tropical}} volcanic island with a distinct elevated central plateau above 550 m. a. s. l. Rainfall depth, duration, intensity, kinetic energy, and erosivity were analysed for 385 erosive rainfall events at five locations {{over a five-year period}} (2004 to 2008). Two Mauritius Meteorological Services stations located on the west coast and three sited on the Central Plateau provide detailed rainfall data at 6 -minute intervals. Erosive storm events are found to differ markedly between the coastal lowlands and the elevated interior with regard to the frequency, the total rainfall generated, the duration, total kinetic energy, and total erosivity of individual events. However, mean kinetic energy, mean and maximum rainfall erosivity (EI 30), and maximum intensities (I 30) from individual erosive events do not show this distinct differentiation. The distribution of kinetic energy and erosivity generated by individual events at the two altitudes are also significantly different. Although erosivity measured during summer exceeds that recorded in winter, the data indicate that large percentages of winter rainfall events on Mauritius are erosive and rainfall from <b>non-tropical</b> <b>cyclones</b> can pose a substantial erosion risk. Soil erosion risk occurs from storm-scale to synoptic-scale events, and extreme rainfall events generate the bulk of the erosivity. This paper also highlights that the use of rainfall records at an event scale in soil erosion risk assessments on tropical islands with a complex topography increases the effectiveness of erosivity estimates.

50|$|On September 8, an upper-level trough {{spawned a}} {{tropical}} depression southeast of Bermuda; {{the next day}} it was upgraded to Tropical Storm Henri. Struggling against strong westerly wind shear, the system attained a peak intensity of 50 mph (85 km/h) and a minimum pressure of 1003 mbar (hPa), possibly due to baroclinity. Thereafter, increasing interaction with the same upper-level trough to the west degraded Henri's circulation. It opened up into a trough on September 11; the remnants were later absorbed into a <b>non-tropical</b> <b>cyclone</b> over the North Atlantic several days later.|$|E

50|$|At 12:00 UTC on September 11, Humberto reached {{hurricane}} status while turning northward. About {{six hours}} later, it peaked with sustained winds of 90 mph (150 km/h). By late on September 12, increasing wind shear, cooling sea surface temperatures, {{and a more}} stable atmosphere led to a weakening trend of the storm. Around 12:00 UTC on the next day, Humberto fell to tropical storm intensity, while curving west-northwestward in the low-level flow south of the Azores surface high pressure. Early on September 14, the storm degenerated into a remnant low. However, deep convection began re-developing later that day. At 00:00 UTC on September 15, Humberto regenerated into a tropical storm about 1,095 mi (1,760 km) southwest of Ponta Delgada, Azores. An approaching mid- to upper-level cyclone began to capture Humberto, causing the storm to decelerate between late on September 16 and early on September 17. When Humberto's low-level circulation became vertically stacked under the <b>non-tropical</b> <b>cyclone,</b> the system transitioned into a subtropical storm on September 17. Humberto then weakened to a subtropical depression early the next day, about 1120 mi south of Ponta Delgada. The subtropical depression continued north-northwestward until degenerating into an open trough, and was soon absorbed by a cold front.|$|E
40|$|The {{tropical}} cyclone rainfall climatology study that was performed for the North Pacific {{was extended to}} the North Atlantic. Similar to the North Pacific {{tropical cyclone}} study, mean monthly rainfall within 444 km {{of the center of}} the North Atlantic tropical cyclones (i. e., that reached storm stage and greater) was estimated from passive microwave satellite observations during, an eleven year period. These satellite-observed rainfall estimates were used {{to assess the impact of}} tropical cyclone rainfall in altering the geographical, seasonal, and inter-annual distribution of the North Atlantic total rainfall during, June-November when tropical cyclones were most abundant. The main results from this study indicate: 1) that tropical cyclones contribute, respectively, 4 %, 3 %, and 4 % to the western, eastern, and entire North Atlantic; 2) similar to that observed in the North Pacific, the maximum in North Atlantic tropical cyclone rainfall is approximately 5 - 10 deg poleward (depending on longitude) of the maximum <b>non-tropical</b> <b>cyclone</b> rainfall; 3) tropical cyclones contribute regionally a maximum of 30 % of the total rainfall 'northeast of Puerto Rico, within a region near 15 deg N 55 deg W, and off the west coast of Africa; 4) there is no lag between the months with maximum tropical cyclone rainfall and <b>non-tropical</b> <b>cyclone</b> rainfall in the western North Atlantic, while in the eastern North Atlantic, maximum tropical cyclone rainfall precedes maximum <b>non-tropical</b> <b>cyclone</b> rainfall; 5) like the North Pacific, North Atlantic tropical cyclones Of hurricane intensity generate the greatest amount of rainfall in the higher latitudes; and 6) warm ENSO events inhibit tropical cyclone rainfall...|$|E
40|$|Tropical cyclone monthly {{rainfall}} amounts {{are estimated}} from passive microwave satellite observations in the North Atlantic and in three equal geographical {{regions of the}} North Pacific (i. e., Western, Central, and Eastern North Pacific). These satellite-derived rainfall amounts are {{used to assess the}} impact of tropical cyclone rainfall in altering the geographical, seasonal, and inter-annual distribution of the 1987 - 1989, 1991 - 1998 North Atlantic and Pacific rainfall during June-November when tropical cyclones are most abundant. To estimate these tropical cyclone rainfall amounts, mean monthly rain rates are derived from the Defence Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) Special Sensor Microwave/ Radiometer (SSM/I) observations within 444 km radius of the center of those North Atlantic and Pacific tropical cyclones that reached storm stage and greater. These rain rate observations are then multiplied by the number of hours in a given month. Mean monthly rainfall amounts are also constructed for all the other North Atlantic and Pacific raining systems during this eleven year period for the purpose of estimating the geographical distribution and intensity of rainfall contributed by <b>non-tropical</b> <b>cyclone</b> systems. Further, the combination of the <b>non-tropical</b> <b>cyclone</b> and tropical cyclone (i. e., total) rainfall is constructed to delineate the fractional amount that tropical cyclones contributed to the total North Pacific rainfall...|$|E

The main results of this study indicate that: 1) tropical cyclones contribute 7 % of the rainfall to the entire domain of the North Pacific during the tropical cyclone season and 12 %, 3 %, and 4 % when the study area is limited to, respectively, the western, central, and eastern third of the ocean; 2) the maxima in tropical cyclone rainfall are poleward (5 deg to 10 deg latitude depending on longitude) of the maxima in <b>non-tropical</b> <b>cyclone</b> rainfall; 3) tropical cyclones contribute a maximum of 30 % northeast of the Philippine Islands and 40 % of the lower Baja California coast; 4) in the western North Pacific, the tropical cyclone rainfall lags the total rainfall by approximately two months and shows seasonal latitudinal variation following the ITCZ; and 5) in general, tropical cyclone rainfall is enhanced during the El Nino years by warm SSTs in the eastern North Pacific and by the monsoon trough in the western and central North Pacific...|$|E
40|$|In {{response}} to the Deepwater Horizon (DwH) oil spill event in 2010, the Naval Oceanographic Office deployed a nowcast-forecast system covering the Gulf of Mexico and adjacent Caribbean Sea that was designated Americas Seas, or AMSEAS, which is documented in this manuscript. The DwH disaster provided {{a challenge to the}} application of available ocean-forecast capabilities, and also generated a historically large observational dataset. AMSEAS was evaluated by four complementary efforts, each with somewhat different aims and approaches: a university research consortium within an Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS) testbed; a petroleum industry consortium, the Gulf of Mexico 3 -D Operational Ocean Forecast System Pilot Prediction Project (GOMEX-PPP); a British Petroleum (BP) funded project at the Northern Gulf Institute in {{response to}} the oil spill; and the Navy itself. Validation metrics are presented in these different projects for water temperature and salinity profiles, sea surface wind, sea surface temperature, sea surface height, and volume transport, for different forecast time scales. The validation found certain geographic and time biases/errors, and small but systematic improvements relative to earlier regional and global modeling efforts. On the basis of these positive AMSEAS validation studies, an oil spill transport simulation was conducted using archived AMSEAS nowcasts to examine transport into the estuaries east of the Mississippi River. This effort captured the influences of Hurricane Alex and a <b>non-tropical</b> <b>cyclone</b> off the Louisiana coast, both of which pushed oil into the western Mississippi Sound, illustrating the importance of the atmospheric influence on oil spills such as DwH...|$|E
40|$|On most {{tropical}} volcanic islands {{the risk}} for soil erosion is enhanced due to a complex topography, high intensity rainfall and the exploitation of land for agriculture. Mauritius is a typical maritime tropical volcanic island with a distinct elevated interior. Rainfall is dominated by tropical weather systems and trade winds and the island is under intensive cultivation. Rainfall depth, duration, intensity, kinetic energy and erosivity were analysed for 385 erosive rainfall events at five locations over a five year period (2004 to 2008) {{on the island of}} Mauritius. Two stations located on the west coast and three stations sited on the Central Plateau above 550 m a. s. l. are used to provide detailed rainfall data at six minute intervals. Erosive storm events, defined here as a total rainfall exceeding 12. 5 mm and a maximum 6 -minute intensity exceeding 25 mm/hour, are found to differ markedly between the coastal lowlands and the elevated interior with regards to the frequency, the total rainfall generated, the duration, total kinetic energy and total erosivity of individual events. However, mean kinetic energy, mean and maximum rainfall erosivity (EI 30) and maximum intensities (I 30) from individual erosive events do not show this distinct differentiation.
