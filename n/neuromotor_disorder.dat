500|$|Cerebral palsy {{is a term}} {{referring}} to a non-progressive developmental <b>neuromotor</b> <b>disorder</b> with an upper motor neuron lesion origin. Depending on {{the location of the}} brain lesion, individuals with cerebral palsy can have a wide variety of gross and fine motor challenges, including different forms and areas of the body affected. Fine motor planning, control and coordination are often affected. Dysarthria, a speech disorder resulting from neurological damage to the motor-speech system, occurs in an estimated 31% to 88% of those with cerebral palsy. Such individuals may require AAC support for communication. Approximately one half to one third have some degree of intellectual impairment, and visual and hearing problems are also common. [...] Gross and fine motor challenges are often of particular concern in accessing an AAC device. Appropriate seating and positioning are important to facilitate optimum stability and movement. Extensive motor training and practice may be required to develop efficient AAC access and use. [...] The trend towards custom-placed sensors and personalized signal processing may assist in facilitating communication for those who are incapable of using other AAC technologies.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: To {{investigate}} {{the effectiveness of}} upper limb rehabilitation, sound measures of upper limb function, capacity, and performance are paramount. OBJECTIVES: This systematic review investigates reliability and responsiveness of upper limb measurement tools used in pediatric neurorehabilitation. METHODS: A 2 -tiered search was conducted up to July 2014. The first search identified upper limb motor assessments for 1 - to 18 -year-old children with <b>neuromotor</b> <b>disorders.</b> The second search examined {{the psychometric properties of}} the tools. Methodological quality was rated according to COSMIN guidelines, and results for each tool were assembled in a "best evidence synthesis. " Furthermore, we delineated whether tools were unimanual or bimanual tests and if they measured recovery or did not distinguish between physiological and compensatory movements. RESULTS: The first search delivered 2546 hits. Of these, 110 articles on 51 upper limb assessment tools were included. The second search resulted in 58 studies on reliability, 11 on measurement error, and 10 on responsiveness. Best evidence synthesis revealed only 2 assessments with moderate positive evidence for reliability, whereas no evidence on measurement error and responsiveness was found. The Melbourne Assessment showed moderate positive evidence for interrater and a fair positive level of evidence for intrarater reliability. The Pediatric Motor Activity Log Revised revealed moderate positive evidence for test-retest reliability. CONCLUSIONS: There is a lack of high-quality studies about psychometric properties of upper limb measurement tools in children with <b>neuromotor</b> <b>disorders.</b> To date, upper limb rehabilitation trials in children and adolescents risk being biased by insensitive measurement tools lacking reliability...|$|R
40|$|Hyperekplexia is a rare, but {{potentially}} fatal, <b>neuromotor</b> <b>disorder</b> characterized by exaggerated startle reflexes and hypertonia {{in response to}} sudden, unexpected auditory or tactile stimuli. This disorder is primarily caused by inherited mutations in the genes encoding the glycine receptor (GlyR) alpha 1 subunit (GLRA 1) and the presynaptic glycine transporter GlyT 2 (SLC 6 A 5). In this study, systematic DNA sequencing of GLRA 1 in 88 new unrelated human hyperekplexia patients revealed 19 sequence variants in 30 index cases, of which 21 cases were inherited in recessive or compound heterozygote modes. This indicates that recessive hyperekplexia is far more prevalent than previous estimates. From the 19 GLRA 1 sequence variants, we have investigated the functional effects of 11 novel and 2 recurrent mutations. The expression levels and functional properties of these hyperekplexia mutants were analyzed using a high-content imaging system and patch-clamp electrophysiology. When expressed in HEK 293 cells, either as homomeric alpha 1 or heteromeric alpha 1 beta GlyRs, subcellular localization defects were the major mechanism underlying recessive mutations. However, mutants without trafficking defects typically showed alterations in the glycine sensitivity suggestive of disrupted receptor function. This study also reports the first hyperekplexia mutation associated with a GlyR leak conductance, suggesting tonic channel opening as a new mechanism in neuronal ligand-gated ion channels.

The neuromuscular {{junction}} {{is a critical}} component of the motor system that enables transmission of impulses from the alpha-motor nerve to muscle fibers. Cerebral palsy is a <b>neuromotor</b> <b>disorder</b> that has been characterized by deficits in the central nervous system and, more recently, disruptions in the peripheral nervous system at the {{neuromuscular junction}}. The specific mechanisms accounting for neuromuscular junction disruption in cerebral palsy are not known, but the development and maintenance of the neuromuscular junctions is a complex process involving alterations in gene expression of synaptic myonuclei and terminal Schwann cells {{and the development of a}} highly-regulated synaptic structure. To understand neuromuscular junction abnormalities associated with cerebral palsy, a method for assessing the regulation of gene expression in synapse-associated nuclei is needed. This work focuses on development of a technique to isolate synaptic myonuclei and terminal Schwann cell nuclei from human skeletal muscle biopsies to enable epigenetic analyses. Using tissue dissociation and immunological separation techniques, a method to isolate synaptic myonuclei and terminal Schwann cells is accomplished using fluorescence-activated and magnetic-activated sorting technologies. Nuclear material separated from muscles of patients with different clinical diagnoses using this technique may provide a critical approach to studying the epigenetic regulation of neuromuscular junction development and maintenance in both health and disease.

Analogous to genetic defects in humans single point mutations, microdeletions, or insertions in the Glra 1 gene {{but also in the}} Glrb gene underlie the pathology in mice. The mutations either localized in the (spasmodic, oscillator, cincinnati, Nmf 11) or the (spastic) subunit of the glycine receptor (GlyR) are much less tolerated in mice than in humans, leaving the question for the existence of different regulatory elements of the pathomechanisms in humans and rodents. In addition to the spontaneous mutations, new insights into understanding of the regulatory pathways in hyperekplexia or glycine encephalopathy arose from the constantly increasing number of knock-out as well as knock-in mutants of GlyRs. Over the last five years, various efforts using in vivo whole cell recordings provided a detailed analysis of the kinetic parameters underlying glycinergic dysfunction. Presynaptic compensation as well as postsynaptic compensatory mechanisms in these mice by other GlyR subunits or GABA(A) receptors, and the role of extra-synaptic GlyRs is still a matter of debate. A recent study on the mouse mutant oscillator displayed a novel aspect for compensation of functionality by complementation of receptor domains that fold independently.

40|$|Gephyrin (GPHN) is an {{organizational}} protein that clusters and localizes the inhibitory glycine (GlyR) and GABAA receptors to the microtubular matrix of the neuronal postsynaptic membrane. Mice deficient in gephyrin develop a hereditary molybdenum cofactor deficiency and a neurological phenotype that mimics startle disease (hyperekplexia). This <b>neuromotor</b> <b>disorder</b> {{is associated with}} mutations in the GlyR α 1 and β subunit genes (GLRA 1 and GLRB). Further genetic heterogeneity is suspected, and we hypothesized that patients lacking mutations in GLRA 1 and GLRB might have mutations in the gephyrin gene (GPHN). In addition, we adopted a yeast two-hybrid screen, using the GlyR β subunit intracellular loop as bait, {{in an attempt to}} identify further GlyR-interacting proteins implicated in hyperekplexia. Gephyrin cDNAs were isolated, and subsequent RT-PCR analysis from human tissues demonstrated the presence of five alternatively spliced GPHN exons concentrated in the central linker region of the gene. This region generated 11 distinct GPHN transcript isoforms, with 10 being specific to neuronal tissue. Mutation analysis of GPHN exons in hyperekplexia patients revealed a missense mutation (A 28 T) in one patient causing an amino acid substitution (N 10 Y). Functional testing demonstrated that GPHNN 10 Y does not disrupt GlyR-gephyrin interactions or collybistininduced cell-surface clustering. We provide evidence that GlyR-gephyrin binding is dependent on the presence of an intact C-terminal MoeA homology domain. Therefore, the N 10 Y mutation and alternative splicing of GPHN transcripts do not affect interactions with GlyRs but may affect other interactions with the cytoskeleton or gephyrin accessory proteins...|$|E
40|$|Hereditary hyperekplexia, or startle disease, is a <b>neuromotor</b> <b>disorder</b> caused {{mainly by}} {{mutations}} that either prevent the surface expression of, or modify the function of, the human heteromeric a 1 b glycine receptor (GlyR) chloride channel. There {{is as yet}} no explanation as to why hyperekplexia mutations that modify channel function are almost exclusively located in the a 1 {{to the exclusion of}} b subunit. The majority of these mutations are identified in the M 2 –M 3 loop of the a 1 subunit. Here we demonstrate that a 1 b GlyR channel function is less sensitive to hyperekplexia-mimicking mutations introduced into the M 2 –M 3 loop of the b than into the a 1 subunit. This suggests that the M 2 –M 3 loop of the a subunit dominates the b subunit in gating the a 1 b GlyR channel. A further attempt to determine the possible mechanism underlying this phenomenon by using the voltage-clamp fluorometry technique revealed that agonist-induced conformational changes in the b subunit M 2 –M 3 loop were uncoupled from a 1 b GlyR channel gating. This is in contrast to the a subunit, where the M 2 –M 3 loop conformational changes were shown to be directly coupled to a 1 b GlyR channel gating. Finally, based on analysis of a 1 b chimeric receptors, we demonstrate that the structural components responsible for this are distributed throughout the b subunit, implying that the b subunit has evolved without the functional constraint of a normal gating pathway within it.

Physical therapy revealed to be fit for the symptomatic treatment of the disease and the adoption of biofeedback signals showed to be effective in prolonging the benefits of the therapy. Thus, this doctoral project has been designed to assess the benefits that wearable technologies for biofeedback generation could have in physical therapy. To further improve the developed biofeedback-based system, the assessment of new methods for the objective evaluation of balance control was included into the study. The dissertation is divided into three different set of studies, respectively aimed at: 1) presenting new wearable systems specifically designed for biofeedback-based rehabilitation; 2) assessing proprioceptive impairments in PD subjects through the adoption of a robotic platform to destabilize the base of support; 3) discussing new methods for the evaluation of balance preceding the execution of voluntary movements. The efficacy of the main proposed solution was assessed in a 6 -months RCT study by comparison of subjects with PD trained with the biofeedback system and patients that received usual care. Both clinical and instrumental outcomes supported the higher efficacy of the biofeedback-based approach.

Mutations in the GlyR α 1 subunit gene (GLRA 1) are the major cause of this disorder, since remarkably few individuals with mutations in the GlyR β subunit gene (GLRB) {{have been found to}} date. Systematic DNA sequencing of GLRB in individuals with hyperekplexia revealed new missense mutations in GLRB, resulting in M 177 R, L 285 R and W 310 C substitutions. The recessive mutation M 177 R results in the insertion of a positively-charged residue into a hydrophobic pocket in the extracellular domain, resulting in an increased EC 50 and decreased maximal responses of α 1 β GlyRs. The de novo mutation L 285 R results in the insertion of a positively-charged side chain into the pore-lining 9 ′ position. Mutations at this site are known to destabilize the channel closed state and produce spontaneously active channels. Consistent with this, we identified a leak conductance associated with spontaneous GlyR activity in cells expressing α 1 βL 285 R GlyRs. Peak currents were also reduced for α 1 βL 285 R GlyRs although glycine sensitivity was normal. W 310 C was predicted to interfere with hydrophobic side-chain stacking between M 1, M 2 and M 3.

40|$|Congenital hyperekplexia is a rare, {{potentially}} treatable <b>neuromotor</b> <b>disorder.</b> Three major {{genes of}} effect are known, {{and all three}} affect glycinergic neurotransmission. Two genes encode for subunits of the postsynaptic inhibitory glycine receptor, GLRA 1 encoding the α 1 subunit and GLRB encoding the β subunit. The third, SLC 6 A 5, encodes the cognate presynaptic glycine transporter 2. Ninety-seven individuals had a clinical diagnosis of hyperekplexia confirmed by genetic testing: 61 cases had mutations in GLRA 1, 24 cases in SLC 6 A 5 and 12 in GLRB. Detailed retrospective clinical analysis ascertained that all gene-positive cases present in the neonatal period (occasionally prenatally) and that clonazepam is the treatment of choice (95 % {{found it to be}} efficacious). We confirm that hyperekplexia is predominantly a recessive condition but dominant cases are seen (16 %). We found no genetic evidence for ‘major’ or ‘minor’ forms of hyperekplexia on a population basis. Thirty-five gene-negative cases were studied for comparison, their cardinal feature was presentation after the first month of life (P < 0. 001). In addition to the characteristic ‘stiffness, startles and stumbles’ of hyperekplexia, apnoea attacks (50 of 89) and delayed development (47 of 92) were frequently reported. Patients with SLC 6 A 5 mutations {{were significantly more likely to}} have had recurrent infantile apnoeas (RR 1. 9; P < 0. 005) than those with GLRA 1 mutations. Patients with GLRB and SLC 6 A 5 mutations were more likely to have developmental delay (RR 1. 5 P < 0. 01; RR 1. 9 P < 0. 03) than those with GLRA 1 mutations; 92 % of GLRB cases reported a mild to severe delay in speech acquisition. Molecular modelling of pathogenic mutations demonstrates specific patterns of protein disruption that can be used to predict phenotype severity. The developmental delay in hyperekplexia, and speech acquisition in particular, may represent failure of developmental neural networks or subtle neurogenic migration defects in the absence of presynaptic glycine release. We recommend early genetic testing for symptomatic neonates and possibly preconception counselling for those at risk for GLRB and SLC 6 A 5 mutations, because of the more challenging phenotype...|$|E

Building from studies in antipsychotic-naive patients, this article reviews 2 domains of neuromotor dysfunction in schizophrenia: neurological signs and involuntary movements. The presence and characteristics of neurological signs in untreated vis-a-vis treated psychosis indicate a vulnerability marker for schizophrenia and implicate disruption to neuronal circuits linking the basal ganglia, cerebral cortex, and cerebellum. The presence and characteristics of involuntary movements in untreated vis-a-vis treated psychosis indicate an intrinsic feature of the disease process and implicate dysfunction in cortical-basal ganglia-cortical circuitry. These <b>neuromotor</b> <b>disorders</b> of schizophrenia join other markers of subtle but pervasive cerebral and extracerebral, systemic dysfunction, and complement current concepts of schizophrenia as a disorder of developmentally determined cortical-basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical/cerebellar network disconnectivity...|$|R
40|$|It is now {{thought that}} some <b>neuromotor</b> <b>disorders</b> (e. g., {{cerebral}} palsy, ALS, Parkinson disease) {{may be the}} result of toxin exposure early in development. Consequently, methods to assess impairments in early nervous system functioning are of considerable interest to both researchers and clinicians. While such methods already have been developed for the postnatal period, few tools exist for the assessment of fetal nervous system functioning. Behavioral measures used in our lab have shown clear developmental patterns, suggesting they may be useful in detecting early assaults to the central nervous system. To test this hypothesis, pregnant rats were given an injection of the neurotoxin methylazoxymethanol (MAM) on E 17 of gestation. On E 20, 72 hours later, fetuses were prepared for in vivo testing, which consisted of the following behavioral observations: (a) spontaneous movement, (b) facial wiping in response to lemon infusion, and (c) response to an artificial nipple presentation. Quantification of these three measures showed clear disruptions of movement coordination in the MAM-treated subjects, with no discernable differences from saline controls in weight or anatomical measures. These findings suggest that prenatal behavioral assessments of motor coordination, either spontaneous or evoked, may be useful in identifying neural insult during fetal development...|$|R
40|$|Comunicação Suplementar e/ou Alternativa (CSA) é uma área clínica reconhecida pela ASHA (1991) que visa suprir temporária ou permanentemente dificuldades severas de comunicação oral, seja qual for o fator etiológico e a idade do indivíduo em questão. É uma área ainda recente no Brasil, havendo poucos estudos científicos, sobretudo que a relacionem com o trabalho cognitivo e de linguagem e com quadros de alteração sensório-motora em crianças. A hipótese inicial é que haja pré-requisitos cognitivos e de linguagem para a abordagem direta da CSA. A presente pesquisa teve como objetivo relacionar o nível de desenvolvimento cognitivo e de linguagem com o desempenho do trabalho de CSA com crianças com Paralisia Cerebral. Utilizou-se como amostra nove crianças com paralisia cerebral, com idades entre 4; 0 e 9; 11. Cada criança foi avaliada a partir de um protocolo estabelecido para determinar sua etapa de desenvolvimento cognitivo e de linguagem. Paralela a esta avaliação registrou-se o desempenho da criança no uso da CSA e a descrição detalhada do seu {{material}} - tipo de sistema utilizado, número de símbolos no total e por categoria semântica, forma de disposição e tipo de acesso. No caso das crianças que apresentaram uso eficiente da CSA, aplicou-se um questionário sobre sua comunicação aos pais/responsáveis. Os dados foram relacionados e analisados comparando essencialmente a etapa cognitiva com o desempenho no uso de CSA. Quanto ao questionário e análise comparativa do material de CSA, não foi possível estudo mais aprofundado visto que apenas uma criança apresentava uso eficiente da CSA no momento da avaliação. A partir da comparação realizada entre os desempenhos nas provas e no uso da CSA, verificou-se que apenas as crianças caracterizadas no período pré-operatório demonstraram usar a CSA de forma eficiente, o que sugere que de fato há pré-requisitos para o uso de sistemas gráficos de CSAThe Augmentative and/or Alternative Communication (AAC) is {{a clinical}} area recognized by ASHA (1991) {{that attempts to}} compensate, temporarily or permanently, severe expressive communication disorders, being whatever the etiologic factor {{and the age of}} the subject studied. It is still a recent area in Brazil, with few scientific studies, above all that associates the AAC with the cognitive and language intervention and with developmental <b>neuromotor</b> <b>disorder.</b> The initial hypothesis is that cognitive and language pre-requisites exist for a direct intervention with AAC. The present research had the aim of verifying the relationship between the cognitive and language development level and the learning of the AAC, in children with cerebral palsy. The subjects of the research were nine children with cerebral palsy, with age ranging from 4; 0 to 9; 11 years old. Each child was assessed by a set protocol {{in order to determine the}} cognitive and language development level. Moreover, it was registered the performance of the child with the AAC use and the detailed description of her material - type of system and selection, arrangement of symbols, and total number of symbols and by semantic category. In the case the children present efficient use of AAC, a questionnaire about their communication was applied to their parents/responsibles. The data were related and analyzed comparing, essentially (principally), the cognitive level and the performance in the use of the AAC. In relation to the questionnaire and the comparative analysis of the AAC material, it was not possible to make a deeper study due to only one child presented efficient AAC use in the assessment occasion. According to the comparison done between the performance in the tests and the use of AAC, it was verified that only the children in the preoperational level demonstrated an effective use of the AAC. The results suggest that it really exists a pre-requisite for the AAC representational systems us...|$|E
40|$|The {{most common}} {{physical}} disability in children is cerebral palsy (CP). The prevalence of this <b>neuromotor</b> <b>disorder</b> {{is estimated at}} 1. 7 per 1000 live births. CP is caused by non-progressive brain lesions that occur during the antenatal, perinatal, or postnatal period, {{at a time when}} the brain and spinal cord are not yet fully developed. As brain lesions are not curable, treatment mainly focusses on symptom management. Primary motor symptoms in CP are spasticity, weakness, impaired balance, and loss of selective motor control. These symptoms often have a destructive influence on a patient’s ability to walk, which is one of the most crucial functional activities of daily life. In CP, about 70 % of children are able to walk, albeit with major or minor gait deviations and with or without the use of walking aids. The clinical presentation of gait in CP is ever changing due to the complex interplay of those primary motor symptoms with a maturing brain, growth, and treatment. As a result, secondary symptoms such as muscle contractures and lever arm dysfunctions will eventually occur, for which invasive treatments such as orthopedic surgery are required. To guide treatment planning, gait is typically evaluated through instrumented, three-dimensional motion analysis (3 DGA), which provides a highly detailed assessment of joint angles, joint moments, and power during walking. The challenge with using this comprehensive biomechanical measurement of gait is the clinical interpretation of the vast amount of multidimensional data that it generates. The benefits of 3 DGA as opposed to observational gait analysis are therefore dependent on the expertise of the clinical professional who is analyzing the data. To this date, there is no standardized method to qualitatively interpret 3 DGA data, and there is a lack of effective and robust tools that capture the full complexity of gait reliably and validly, with widespread clinical acceptance and applicability. In routine clinical and research practice, the amount of 3 DGA data is reduced before it is analyzed and interpreted. Two approaches for reduction are commonly applied. The first approach analyses gait features, which are specific points extracted from the kinematic and kinetic waveforms. Within the scope of this PhD research, important steps were undertaken in the search for an alternative, standardized method to extract and analyze the clinically relevant information from 3 DGA data (study 1). The second approach to reduce 3 DGA data is to define gait patterns, which allocate multiple gait features, either within a joint or across multiple joints, into groups. The principal goal of the PhD was to develop a clinically relevant, reliable, and valid classification for pathological movement patterns during gait in children with CP (study 2, 3, 4, 5). In the first study, a literature review found that approximately 220 papers have reported on the outcome of treatment in CP by evaluating children pre- and post-treatment using 3 DGA features. Focusing on the studies that evaluated the effect of Botulinum Toxin type A (a common treatment intervention to manage spasticity), this first study shows that there is no consensus regarding the selection of gait features that are expected to be sensitive to change after treatment in CP. Feature analysis may fail to provide a full understanding of the effect of treatment. Clinically relevant information could be missed, as the selection of features is most likely based on the clinical expertise of the medical team that decides on the treatment plan. In a subsequent retrospective intervention study, statistical parametric mapping (SPM) was identified as a valid, unbiased statistical alternative. SPM allowed kinematic and kinetic waveforms to be evaluated as a whole. This statistical approach eliminates the need for a priori data reduction, and keeps the probability of making a Type I or Type II error stable by considering the interdependency of all points of the waveform. Regarding gait classifications in CP, a literature review showed that several gait patterns and classifications based on kinematic and kinetic data have been previously reported in literature. However, their clinical applicability is limited because psychometric properties of reliability and validity are often not yet established. In the second study, a Delphi consensus project was organized to ensure that the new classification was clinically relevant. The Delphi approach is a semi-quantitative research method where an international expert panel was consulted via iterative surveys to provide their opinion on the problem of gait classification in CP. The study started with a first proposal of gait patterns that should be included in the classification, based on previous literature and on the expertise of the clinical and research team of University Hospitals Leuven. After three consecutive survey rounds, consensus was reached on 49 gait patterns across the pelvis, hip, knee, and ankle joints in the sagittal, coronal, and transverse plane. After the development of the classification, a necessary next step was to ensure that the level of clinician agreement on the patterns of a patient was at a sufficiently high level so that the patterns could be used reliably in practice. In the third study, an international agreement study was conducted among 29 clinicians with varying levels of experience with regards to CP and 3 DGA. Apart from a few individual patterns, the study demonstrated that, after a brief learning phase, clinicians could assign the consensus-based joint patterns with good consistency between and within raters. The amount of patient data that were found to be ‘unclassifiable’ by the clinicians was low compared to previously published classifications and formed an indirect confirmation of the content validity of the patterns. As the patterns defined during the Delphi study were the result of an informed, yet subjective opinion of an expert panel, the classification might have still provided an incomplete picture on gait pathology in CP. Therefore, the fourth study examined the content validity of the classification. It was assessed whether objective patient data supported the existence of the patterns. To this end, SPM was used to analyze a large database of classified kinematic and kinetic trials. This was to confirm whether each of the 49 patterns differed from the gait pattern of typically developing children in the key areas of the gait cycle that were indicated in the pattern definitions by the experts. Even though this hypothesis was largely confirmed, some additional areas that were not included within the definitions of the Delphi patterns were highlighted by the SPM analysis. The fifth study examined the construct validity of the classification, measuring the extent to which the gait patterns of the classification system are able to distinguish between the categories of other validated scales that measure the same or a related construct. Therefore, the prevalence of the patterns in a large cohort of children with CP was evaluated. It was found that the distribution of these patterns was associated with the distribution of other relevant and validated scales in CP, such as topographical classification, gross motor function, and levels of spasticity and weakness. In conclusion, this doctoral research has made important contributions to the analysis and standardized interpretation of 3 DGA. The classification that was developed within this research presents clinicians and researchers with a comprehensive overview of clinically relevant gait features and gait patterns, which will hopefully serve as a basis for improved communication and a more uniform terminology regarding gait pathology in CP. Patterns and their definitions should be adapted when necessary, and future research should further demonstrate the validity, responsiveness, and clinical applicability of the classification. One of the main contributions of this PhD thesis is that the developed methodological framework, combining qualitative and quantitative research methods to build a clinically relevant, reliable, and valid classification, could also be generalized to any other medical condition that affects movement. nrpages: 229 status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Bird schistosomes, {{besides being}} {{responsible}} for bird schistosomiasis, are known as causative agents of cercarial dermatitis. Cercarial dermatitis develops after repeated contact with cercariae, mainly of the genus Trichobilharzia, and {{was described as a}} type I, immediate hypersensitivity response, followed by a late phase reaction. The immune response is Th 2 polarized. Primary infection leads to an inflammatory reaction that is insufficient to eliminate the schistosomes and schistosomula may continue its migration through the body of avian as well as mammalian hosts. However, reinfections of experimental mice revealed an immune reaction leading to destruction of the majority of schistosomula in the skin. Infection with the nasal schistosome Trichobilharzia regenti probably represents a higher health risk than infections with visceral schistosomes. After the skin penetration by the cercariae, parasites migrate via the peripheral nerves, spinal cord to the brain, and terminate their life cycle in the nasal mucosa of waterfowl where they lay eggs. T. regenti can also get over skin barrier and migrate to CNS of experimental mice. During heavy infections, neuroinfections of both birds and mammals lead {{to the development of a}} cellular immune response and axonal damage in the vicinity of the schistosomulum. Such infections are manifest by <b>neuromotor</b> <b>disorders...</b>|$|R
40|$|Decoding neural {{activities}} {{related to}} voluntary and involuntary movements is fundamental to understanding human brain motor circuits and <b>neuromotor</b> <b>disorders</b> {{and can lead to}} the development of neuromotor prosthetic devices for neurorehabilitation. This study explores using recorded deep brain local field potentials (LFPs) for robust movement decoding of Parkinson’s disease (PD) and Dystonia patients. The LFP data from voluntary movement activities such as left and right hand index finger clicking were recorded from patients who underwent surgeries for implantation of deep brain stimulation electrodes. Movement-related LFP signal features were extracted by computing instantaneous power related to motor response in different neural frequency bands. An innovative neural network ensemble classifier has been proposed and developed for accurate prediction of finger movement and its forthcoming laterality. The ensemble classifier contains three base neural network classifiers, namely, feedforward, radial basis, and probabilistic neural networks. The majority voting rule is used to fuse the decisions of the three base classifiers to generate the final decision of the ensemble classifier. The overall decoding performance reaches a level of agreement (kappa value) at about 0. 729 ± 0. 16 for decoding movement from the resting state and about 0. 671 ± 0. 14 for decoding left and right visually cued movements...|$|R

Like in other bird schistosomes, repeated penetration of larvae (cercariae) into the skin lead to development of skin allergic reaction in humans (cercarial dermatitis). Soon after the penetration in the skin, cercariae transform to schistosomula which are able to resist the host response and, in case of T. regenti, migrate to central nervous system (CNS). During CNS involvement, the infections of both specific avian and non-specific mammalian hosts can result in <b>neuromotor</b> <b>disorders</b> and even death of the host. The present PhD thesis deals with T. regenti infections of non-specific mammalian host. The first part of the experimental work was focused on antibody reactivity and antigen specificity of sera from mice experimentally infected with T. regenti. Development of antigen-specific IgM and IgG 1 antibodies and elevated levels of total serum IgE indicated a Th 2 immune response. Cercarial antigens stimulated IL- 4 release from basophiles obtained from healthy volunteers.

In contrast to previous systems intended for short-term use in a laboratory, Mercury is designed to support long-term, longitudinal data collection on patients in hospital and home settings. Patients wear up to 8 wireless nodes equipped with sensors for monitoring movement and physiological conditions. Individual nodes compute high-level features from the raw signals, and a base station performs data collection and tunes sensor node parameters based on energy availability, radio link quality, and application specific policies. Mercury is designed to overcome the core challenges of long battery lifetime and high data fidelity for long-term studies where patients wear sensors continuously 12 to 18 hours a day. This requires tuning sensor operation and data transfers based on energy consumption of each node and processing data under severe computational constraints. Mercury provides a high-level programming interface that allows a clinical researcher to rapidly build up different policies for driving data collection and tuning sensor lifetime.
