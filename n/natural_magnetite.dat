3000|$|The rebound of {{remanence}} in cooling below TV {{is reminiscent}} of the memory phenomenon, in which a certain fraction of the initial 300 -K remanence is recovered in the second passage through TV. One difference is that memory persists in warming to room temperature, whereas the rebound gain of remanence is largely transitory and disappears with further cooling. Muxworthy and McClelland’s (2000) explanation for the rebound, which they call a positive anomaly, is the removal of screening soft DWs, revealing a hard domain structure carrying a net moment {{in the direction of the}} initial remanence. While this might be reasonable for the PSD-size hydrothermal grains that display the anomaly in their sample set, it is doubtful for the larger MD-size <b>natural</b> <b>magnetites</b> that more typically show rebound in other studies, including ours.

30|$|An {{interesting}} and unexplained detail of some cycling curves of room temperature remanence {{is a small}} to pronounced minimum at TV, particularly in warming curves (Figs.  3, 4, 5). Where the minimum is well developed there is an accompanying peak in both warming and cooling curves centered on 100 – 105  K. In cooling, this represents a spontaneous recovery of remanence lost in crossing the Verwey transition. This dip-and-recovery phenomenon has been widely observed but not convincingly explained. It is absent from samples with significant internal stress and from <b>natural</b> <b>magnetites</b> below about 15  µm in size. But artificial magnetites produced in a low-stress hydrothermal environment exhibit dips and peaks near TV in small grains and lack them in ≈[*] 100  µm grains (Muxworthy and McClelland 2000; Özdemir et al. 2002). The key {{may lie in the}} rather unexpected similarity between uniaxial monoclinic magnetization directions below TV and the corresponding cubic multiaxial patterns and Ms vectors above TV, as demonstrated by Kasama et al. (2013). What is recovered on a small scale over a few tens of degrees can evidently be retained as remanence memory over the broad temperature range of the entire cycling experiment.|$|R

40|$|The {{simplest}} {{and most}} effective method of removing low concentrations of anionic surfactants such as sodium dodecyl benzenesulfonate (SDBS) and {{sodium lauryl sulfate}} (SLS) is adsorption. Among adsorbents the natural clays are cheap and promising for these purposes. However, there are significant difficulties in removal of spent sorbent after the adsorption process. So, the creation of magnetic sorbents that can be effectively removed from water after sorption by magnetic separation will be a successful decision. The aim of this investigation {{is the creation of}} cheap and efficient magnetic sorbents based on <b>natural</b> clays and <b>magnetite</b> for anionic surfactant removal from wastewater. We have synthesized a series of magnetic sorbents from different natural clays with a content of magnetite from 2 to 10 wt%. The ability of magnetic sorbents to remove SDBS and SLS from aqueous solutions has been studied for different adsorbate concentrations by varying the amount of adsorbent, temperature and shaking time. Thermodynamic parameters were calculated from the slope and intercept of the linear plots of ln K against 1 /T. Analysis of adsorption results obtained at different temperatures showed that the adsorption pattern on magnetic sorbents correspond to the Langmuir isotherm. It is shown that with increasing the content of magnetite in the magnetic sorbents improves not only their separation from water by magnetic separation, but adsorption capacity to SDBS and SLS.

40|$|If a rock is {{to retain}} a geologically {{meaningful}} magnetic record of its history, {{it is essential that}} it contains magnetic minerals which are capable of carrying stable magnetic remanence. Of the natural occurring magnetic minerals, magnetite is the most important because of its abundance and strong magnetic signature. The stability, i. e., the resistance to demagnetisation or reorientation, of magnetic remanence is related to grain size; in smaller grains the magnetic moments align to have single domain (SD) structures, in larger grains complex magnetic patterns are formed (multidomain (MD)). “Classical” domain theory predicts that SD remanence is stable, whilst MD remanence is not. However experimental evidence has shown that both SD and MD grains can have stable remanences. In this thesis the origin of stable MD remanence is examined. There are two opposing theories; one suggests that the stability is due to independent SD-like structures, the other postulates that the stability is due to metastable MD structure. A series of experiments were designed to examine the stability using a selection of characterised synthetic and natural samples. Low-stress hydrothermal recrystallised samples where grown for this study. For the first time, the stability of thermoremanence induced in hydrothermal crystals to cooling was examined. The results agree with previous observations for crushed and <b>natural</b> <b>magnetites,</b> and support kinematic models. The behaviour of SIRM and thermoremanences in MD magnetite to low-temperature cooling to below the crystallographic Verwey transition at 120 - 124 K (T v) and the cubic magnetocrystalline anisotropy isotropic point (T k) at 130 K was investigated. On cooling through T v, SIRM was observed to decrease and demagnetise, however thermoremanence was found to display a large increase in the magnetisation at T v, which was partially re- versible on warming. The size of the anomaly is shown to be dependent on the temperature at which the thermoremanence is acquired, internal stress and grain size. The anomaly is attributed to the large increase in the magnetocrystalline anisotropy which occurs on cooling through T v. It is postulated that low-temperature cycling demagnetisation is due to kinematic processes which occur on cooling between room temperature and T k. Characterisation of low-temperature treated remanence and partially alternating field demagnetised remanence, suggest that the stable remanence is multidomain. Low-temperature cooling of remanence in single sub-micron crystals was simulated using micromagnetic models. The models predict the observed anomaly for thermoremanence on cooling through T v, and also the relative behaviour of SIRM and thermoremanence. The single domain threshold was calculated for the low-temperature phase of magnetite, and was found to be 0. 14 microns, compared to 0. 07 microns at room temperature. </p...|$|R

Our results also indicate that intact magnetosomes are a unique system with distinct FMR signatures.

40|$|<b>Natural</b> <b>magnetite</b> is {{used for}} {{producing}} iron ore pellets, one of the raw materials in steel production. The quality of produced pellets depends on many factors, including {{the properties of the}} magnetite concentrate fed to pelletization. To be able to minimize the effect of the variations in feed properties on pellets quality, investigation of magnetite particle interaction with a focus on the surface properties is required. Atomic force microscopy (AFM), using the colloidal probe technique, is a suitable tool for measuring such particle-particle interaction in-situ. Natural particles are usually of micro-sizes (m-s) and have different sizes and shapes, which complicates an accurate investigation of particle interaction with AFM. To overcome such difficulties, synthetic nanoparticles are used instead. Process water chemistry is one of the factors affecting magnetite surface properties. Partial dissolution of calcite and apatite minerals, present in iron ore, results in high Ca 2 + concentrations in the process water, which has been shown to have a major effect on the charge of the magnetite particles [1, 2]. The aim of this study was therefore to investigate forces and aggregation between magnetite particles, of micro- and nano-size (n-s), in Ca 2 + solutions at various pH values. The spherical monodispersed magnetite nano-sized particles, with a diameter of approx. 10 nm, were synthesized by the precipitation technique [3]. Measurements were performed for m-s probe/m-s layer and m-s probe/n-s layer systems. <b>Natural</b> <b>magnetite</b> particles of 10 - 30 µm size were glued to NP-S cantilevers (Digital Instruments/Bruker, Santa Barbara, CA) with a measured spring constant of 0. 12 N/m. Nano-sized particles were deposited on the glass slides by dip-coating. Roughness (Ra) of the n-s layers was measured with AFM and was about 10 nm for areas 1 × 1 µm 2, a representative high-resolution image is shown in Figure 1. Particle interaction was similar for m-s and n-s magnetite particles at pH 4 and 6. At pH 10, the interaction behavior was different due to probable surface modification of <b>natural</b> <b>magnetite</b> particles by ions from process water. The adhesion force for both interacting systems was measured, see ref. [4] for {{a detailed description of the}} results. To verify that ϛ-potential measurements could be used to predict the interaction between charged particles (in this case silica and magnetite) in solutions containing inorganic ions, force measurements between n-s magnetite layer and a SiO 2 spherical probe (3. 5 µm in diameter) were performed and correlated with the ϛ-potential results for these particles in the same solutions. Also, a DLVO simulation was performed to theoretically confirm the experimental interaction based on surface charge trends. An example of the simulated force curves is shown in Figure 2. The interaction between the probe and the magnetite surface was attractive at pH 4 and 6 but became repulsive at pH 8 and 10, which is in agreement with what could be expected from the ϛ-potential results for these particles.

40|$|The crystal {{structure}} of the Dps-like (Dps, DNA-protecting protein during starvation) ferritin protein DpsA from the halophile Halobacterium salinarum was determined with low endogenous iron content at 1. 6 -Å resolution. The mechanism of iron uptake and storage was analyzed in this noncanonical ferritin by three high-resolution structures at successively increasing iron contents. In the high-iron state of the DpsA protein, up to 110 iron atoms were localized in the dodecameric protein complex. For ultimate iron storage, the archaeal ferritin shell comprises iron-binding sites for iron translocation, oxidation, and nucleation. Initial iron–protein interactions occur through acidic residues exposed along the outer surface in proximity to the iron entry pore. This narrow pore permits translocation of ions toward the ferroxidase centers via two discrete steps. Iron oxidation proceeds by transient formation of tri-iron ferroxidase centers. Iron storage by biomineralization inside the ferritin shell occurs at two iron nucleation centers. Here, a single iron atom provides a structural seed for iron-oxide cluster formation.

Unlike <b>magnetite,</b> only scarce information is available about the magnetic characteristics of greigite. For this reason, and the present inability to grow these microorganisms in pure culture, it is not known whether or not the magnetosomes in the newly discovered greigite-precipitating bacteria are of single-domain (SD) size, as are the magnetosomes from magnetite-precipitating bacteria. The hypothesis of natural selection for magnetotactic behavior predicts that the greigite-bearing magnetosomes should also be single magnetic domains. Using previously reported magnetic properties and crystallographic features for greigite, we have calculated the size and shape boundaries expected for SD and superparamagnetic (SPM) behavior in this mineral. For further characterization of the greigite crystals, we analyzed the domain state at various length/width ratios assuming crystal shapes of parallelepipeds and prolate spheroids. Magnetite was used as control for the current theories supporting these calculations. We also present a simple algorithm to calculate the upper size limit of single-domain grains. Our results show that the crystals of bacterial greigite characterized so far are located in the region close to the single-domain superparamagnetic boundary and should have relatively low coercivity. If these crystals contribute to the magnetization of sediments, remanence produced by bacterial greigite could be mistaken for large, multidomain magnetite in alternating field demagnetization studies. ...|$|R

We analyzed 36 histograms related to bacterial, inorganic, and biomimetic nanoparticle sizes. Using statistical software we concluded that the size of the nanoparticles in cultured magnetotactic bacteria follows an extreme value distribution. Magnetite in uncultured samples can be treated as a two-component mixture containing extreme value and/or log-normally distributed nanoparticles. Analysis of the time-dependent formation of bacterial magnetite revealed that the magnetite size distribution transforms from the initial log-normal (young bacterial culture) through normal-like toward the extreme value distribution (evolved culture). It seems that at a certain moment during bacterial magnetite formation, the bacterial system starts to behave as a closed system. The closing of the system must be followed by another unknown process, because restriction of the nutrient supply into magnetosomes is insufficient for the generation of the extreme value distribution.

Particular attention was given to possible diffusion aftereffects such as dislocation creep (stress relaxation) and disaccommodation (vacancy and ionic reordering) and their contribution to viscous behavior in what has been commonly thought of as a purely thermal fluctuation process. Dislocation creep was examined by measuring viscosity before and after annealing. Annealing was found to reduce the non-log(t) behavior, where t is time. Non-log(t) behavior has been associated with diffusion aftereffects, suggesting that these are a major contributor to viscosity and (de) magnetization processes in MD samples. The positive curvature of the non-log(t) acquisition processes indicates that dislocation creep dominates over disaccommodation. This does not imply that VM and VRM are due solely to dislocation creep, but rather that VRM and VM reflect a number of unrelated temperature-dependent processes, primarily thermal fluctuations and dislocation creep. This {{is the first time that}} dislocation creep has been directly identified as contributing to viscosity at temperature. These findings will have particular implications for paleointensity determinations, as on heating a sample, its dislocation structure may relax, giving rise to demagnetizations not associated with thermal fluctuations.

In contrast, pyrrhotite and Fe-rich spinel were formed prior to the xenoliths' ascent to the surface, as evidenced by their dominant occurrence as tiny inclusions and thin exsolution lamellae in pyroxene. The Fe-rich spinel has ~ 50 % mole fraction of Fe₃O₄ and corresponds to the strongest magnetization, and its coexistence with Mg-rich spinel implies a reheating event due to the underplating of basaltic magma. Besides, armalcolite and ilmenite were found in the reaction rims between xenoliths and the basalt, but they contribute little to the whole rock magnetization. However, these pyroxenite xenoliths would be nonmagnetic at in situ depths, as well as peridotite and mafic granulite xenoliths derived from the crust-mantle transition zone (~ 32 - 42 km).

40|$|Experiments {{were carried}} out to {{investigate}} the earlier prediction that prolonged exposure to long-wavelength (> 500 nm) light would eliminate homing orientation by male Eastern red-spotted newts Notophthalmus viridescens. As in previous experiments, controls held in outdoor tanks under natural lighting conditions and tested in a visually uniform indoor arena under full-spectrum light were homeward oriented. As predicted, however, newts held under long-wavelength light and tested under either full-spectrum or long-wavelength light (> 500 nm) failed to show consistent homeward orientation. The newts also did not orient {{with respect to the}} shore directions in the outdoor tanks in which they were held prior to testing. Unexpectedly, however, the newts exhibited bimodal orientation along a more-or-less `fixed' north-northeast—south-southwest magnetic axis. The orientation exhibited by newts tested under full-spectrum light was indistinguishable from that of newts tested under long-wavelength light, although these two wavelength conditions have previously been shown to differentially affect both shoreward compass orientation and homing orientation. To investigate the possibility that the `fixed-axis' response of the newts was mediated by a magnetoreception mechanism involving single-domain particles of <b>magnetite,</b> <b>natural</b> remanent magnetism (NRM) was measured from a subset of the newts. The distribution of NRM alignments with respect to the head—body axis of the newts was indistinguishable from random. Furthermore, there was no consistent relationship between the NRM of individual newts and their directional response in the overall sample. However, under full-spectrum, but not long-wavelength, light, the alignment of the NRM when the newts reached the 20 cm radius criterion circle in the indoor testing arena (estimated by adding the NRM alignment measured from each newt to its magnetic bearing) was non-randomly distributed. These findings are consistent with the earlier suggestion that homing newts use the light-dependent magnetic compass to align a magnetite-based `map detector' when obtaining the precise measurements necessary to derive map information from the magnetic field. However, aligning the putative map detector does not explain the fixed-axis response of newts tested under long-wavelength light. Preliminary evidence suggests that, in the absence of reliable directional information from the magnetic compass (caused by the 90 ° rotation of the response of the magnetic compass under long-wavelength light), newts may resort to a systematic sampling strategy to identify alignment(s) of the map detector that yields reliable magnetic field measurements...|$|R
40|$|Magnetic {{measurements}} of samples with precisely controlled magnetic mineralogy, grain size, and interparticle spacing {{are needed to}} provide crucial experimental rock magnetic underpinning for paleomagnetic studies. We report a novel nanofabrication method for producing two-dimensional arrays of cylindrical synthetic magnetite particles with well-defined composition, particle size, and interparticle spacing. The samples are fabricated by writing dot arrays with electron beam lithography, transferring these patterns into sputtered Fe thin films by reactive ion etching in a CO/NH 3 plasma, and oxidizing the resulting Fe particles in a controlled atmosphere to form magnetite. Scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy {{have been used to}} monitor the fabrication process and to determine the particle geometry. The particle sizes of our samples range between 100 nm and 265 nm with center-to-center spacings between 180 nm and 310 nm. Low-temperature magnetic remanence data confirm the stoichiometry of the magnetite. We present magnetic hysteresis data and first-order reversal curve diagrams for our samples and compare these with previously published data from other synthetic and <b>natural</b> <b>magnetite</b> samples. The ability to independently control particle size and interparticle spacing of magnetite grains makes our synthetic samples ideal for studying the influence of magnetostatic interactions on the paleomagnetic recording fidelity of naturally occurring magnetite in rock...|$|E
40|$|Iron ore pellets are an {{important}} refined product used as a raw material {{in the production of}} steel. In order to meet the requirements of the processes for iron production, the iron ore is upgraded in a number of steps including, among others, reverse flotation. Under certain circumstances the flotation collector may inadvertently adsorb on the iron ore particles increasing the hydrophobicity of the iron ore concentrate, which in turn has been shown to have an adverse effect on pellet strength. To minimize the influence of the collector on pellet properties, {{it is important to understand}} the mechanism of collector adsorption on iron oxides and how different factors may affect the extent of adsorption. In Papers I-III, the adsorption of a commercial anionic carboxylate collector Atrac 1563 and a number of model compounds on synthetic iron oxides was studied in-situ using attenuated total reflectance Fourier transforms infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy. The effect of surfactant concentration, pH, ionic strength, calcium ions and sodium silicate on surfactant adsorption was investigated. The adsorption mechanism of anionic surfactants on iron oxides at pH 8. 5 in the absence and presence of other ions was elucidated. Whereas silicate species were shown to reduce surfactant adsorption, calcium ions were found to facilitate the adsorption and precipitation of the surfactant on magnetite even in the presence of sodium silicate. This implies that a high concentration of calcium in the process water could possibly enhance the contamination of the iron ore with the flotation collector. In Paper III, the effect of calcium, silicate and a carboxylate surfactant on the zeta-potential and wetting properties of magnetite was investigated. It was concluded that a high content of calcium ions in the process water could reduce the dispersing effect of silicate in flotation of apatite from magnetite. Whereas treatment with calcium chloride and sodium silicate made magnetite more hydrophilic, subsequent adsorption of the anionic surfactant increased the water contact angle of magnetite. The hydrophobic areas on the magnetite surface could result in incorporation of air bubbles inside the iron ore pellets produced by wet agglomeration, lowering pellet strength. Based on the adsorption studies, it was concluded that calcium ions could be detrimental for both flotation and agglomeration. Since water softening could result in further dissolution of calcium-containing minerals, an alternative method of handling surfactant coatings on magnetite surfaces was proposed in Paper IV. It was shown that the wettability of the magnetite surface after surfactant adsorption could be restored by modifying the surface with polyacrylate or sodium silicate. In Paper V, the results obtained using synthetic magnetite were verified for <b>natural</b> <b>magnetite.</b> It was illustrated that the conclusions made for the model system regarding the detrimental effect of calcium ions were applicable to the <b>natural</b> <b>magnetite</b> particles and commercial flotation reagents. It was confirmed that polyacrylate and soluble silicate could be successfully used to improve the wettability of the flotated magnetite concentrate. The fact that polyacrylate improved the wettability of magnetite more efficiently at the increased concentration of calcium ions indicates that this polymer is a good candidate for applications in hard water. Finally, it was concluded that in-situ ATR-FTIR spectroscopy in combination with zeta-potential and contact angle measurements could be successfully applied for studying surface phenomena related to mineral processing.

40|$|About {{ten years}} ago, the present author {{reported}} on the acquisition of the remanent magnetization caused by the uni-directional high pressure and proposed such a remanent magnetization may be called 'piezo-remanent magnetization (prm) ' (Domen & Kawai 1957, Domen 1958, 1962, Nagata 1966). Some additional experimental data obtained afterwards are herein presented; such as the acquisition of prm in Nagasaki magnetite, piezo-trm (thermo-remanent magnetization), thermal fluctuation of prm in the artificaially prepared rock sample, {{the effect of the}} mechanical shocks and of the tensile stress, the demagnetization effect of the hydrostatic pressuer and so on (Domen 1966). The mode of the aequisition of prm caused by the uni-directional high pressure is shown in figure 1 and the equilibrium prm v. s. pressure relation is shown in Fig. 2, as the curves for the <b>natural</b> <b>magnetite</b> come from Nagasaki Prefecture, Kyushu Island, Japan together with these of the Okayaam magnetite which are already given in the previous paper (Domen 1962).

40|$|The thesis {{focuses on}} the {{application}} of force measurements with atomic force microscopy (AFM) on materials with a few surface contacts/asperities and chemically modified surfaces. The technique allows measurements of ultra-small intermolecular and surface forces, down to the piconewton level. The force measurements between surfaces of well-defined geometry are often used to measure and model the interaction between different systems of charged and neutral surfaces in various environments. However, detailed knowledge of the contacting surface profile geometry and surface properties is required to model the fundamental forces involved in the interaction. The preparation of such well-defined and idealized surfaces is often time consuming and the surfaces may not possess the behavior and properties of a source material in real processes, such as in industry. Moreover, external factors such as magnetic fields, ionic strengths and pH-values in a solution, may further complicate the evaluation. Hence, it is desirable to explore and develop techniques for trustable measurements of forces between “real” surfaces. These are often a complex composition of various force interactions and multiple surface contacts. The AFM probe technique was explored to measure force interactions between “real” particle surfaces. The work shows {{the applicability of the}} AFM technique to study the interaction forces despite the forecasted difficulties with the roughness of the particles. A technique to measure the adhesion and work of adhesion from AFM force curves was implemented and used. The thermal tune method was implemented in our commercial NT-MDT microscope to determine cantilever spring constants. The force interactions between <b>natural</b> microsize (m-s) <b>magnetite</b> particles and synthetic nanosize (n-s) magnetite particles were studied in calcium solution with concentrations of 1, 10, 100 mM and at pH values 4, 6 and 10. The changes in force interactions, due to variations in calcium concentration and pH were investigated. The adhesion force change with the concentration and pH was similar for m-s/m-s and m-s/n-s systems, and the adhesion force increased with the concentration at pH 6, except for the highest calcium concentration of 100 mM at pH 10. It was found that the magnetite surface modification could appear at the highest calcium concentration at pH 10. Moreover, the thesis contains preliminary results of the force interaction study between natural and synthetic bentonite-magnetite particles in calcium solution with concentrations of 1, 10 and 100 mM at pH 6. The influence of roughness on the calculation of contact mechanics parameters were studied with AFM and Vertical Scanning Interferometry (VSI). This is important for future development of a model to describe and characterize the force interaction between samples with multiple surface contacts. It was found that the optical artifacts, induced by VSI, have a large influence on all the roughness parameters calculated on the calibration grids, which represent extreme surface topographies.

40|$|The platinum-group element (PGE) {{contents}} of the upper portions of the Bushveld Complex were investigated with three questions in mind: (a) In <b>natural</b> systems does <b>magnetite</b> concentrate Os, Ir, Ru and Rh (IPGE), as has been observed in experimental systems? (b) Is there a Au-Pd-enriched layer present such as observed in the upper parts of the Skaergaard intrusion? (c) Can changes in metal ratios be used for prospecting for PGE deposits? In the sulfide-poor Main Magnetite Layer of the eastern Bushveld, Ir and Rh are enriched relative to Pt, Pd and Au and this could be because magnetite preferentially concentrated Ir and Rh over Pt, Pd and Au. However, in most other magnetite layers no enrichment was observed. This could be because most magnetite layers contain approximately 1 % sulfides and the PGE budget {{is dominated by the}} sulfides. These sulfides obscured the effects of magnetite collecting IPGE, because sulfides collect all the PGE and the partition coefficients for the PGE into a sulfide liquid are much greater than the partition coefficient for IPGE into magnetite. The weighted average of the platinum-group elements (PGE) and Au over the 2000 m of sampled stratigraphy is Au 2. 1 ppb, Pd 1. 7 ppb, Pt 1. 7 ppb, Rh 0. 18 ppb, Ru< 0. 5, Ir 0. 16 ppb, Os< 0. 5 ppb. Compared to the marginal rocks (presumed initial liquids) of the Bushveld Complex the PGE and Au are severely depleted. Only one sample (a leuconorite in the first cyclic unit) contained Pt and Pd at economic grade (Pt 2 ppm, Pd 2 ppm). The overall depletion of the PGE in the Upper Zone (despite the presence of 1 % to 3 % sulfides) could be the result of the PGE having been stripped from the magma by early sulfide liquid which had already settled out of the magma to form the world famous platinum reefs lower in the magma chamber. In addition to the overall depletion of PGE, PGE/S ratios decrease up section indicating that the sulfide fraction is poorer in PGE up section. This is interpreted {{to be the result of}} continued depletion of the silicate liquid as sulfides constantly settle out of the silicate liquid. There appears to be little prospect of a Pd-reef type deposit in the Upper Zone. Comparison of the composition of the marginal rocks of the Bushveld with a weighted average for the complete 6 km of the Bushveld cumulates shows that the cumulate pile is much richer in compatible elements (Ir, Rh, Cr) and poorer in incompatible elements (Sm and Hf) than the marginal rocks. Two possible solutions to this are: (a) The magma emplaced into the chamber was a crystal mush and thus more mafic than marginal rocks to the intrusion or (b) fractionated magma has been removed from the cumulate sequence and either erupted or intruded the country rocks as granites and granophyres...|$|R
40|$|Partial thermoremanent {{magnetization}} (pTRM) was imparted over {{a narrow}} temperature interval, T = 370 – 350 ◦C, to {{a suite of}} crushed and annealed <b>natural</b> <b>magnetite</b> samples, ranging in grain size from ≈ 1 to 125 – 150 m and in domain state from small pseudo-single-domain (PSD) to multidomain (MD). In this way, effectively a single blocking temperature, TB, of pTRM was activated. Stepwise thermal demagnetization did not erase the pTRMs sharply at TB, as for single-domain (SD) grains. Demagnetization began well below 350 ◦C and continued above 370 ◦C, with a median unblocking temperature, TUB, close to 360 ◦C. The largest grains deviated most from SD behavior. Their pTRM demagnetized over the entire interval from room temperature to the Curie point, in accordance with predictions for MD grains. In terms of the unblocking temperature distribution f(TUB) or slope dM/dT of the thermal demagnetization curve, SD grains have a sharp spectrum, T UB = T B; MD grains were observed to have a broad, roughly symmetrical spectrum centered on TB; and intermediate size grains in the PSD range had non-Gaussian spectra, combining a central peak near TB with broad tails above and below TB. In this respect, PSD grains display a superposition of SD and MD remanences, not a blend between the two. Practical implications of these observations are that Thellier’s law of reciprocity (T UB = T B) will be increasingly violated as grain size increases in the PSD range. The low-TUB part of f(TUB) produces anomalously large demagnetization of NRM in low-temperature heating steps of Thellier-type paleointensity determinations and a sagging shape of the Arai plot.
