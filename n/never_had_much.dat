5|$|In 59BC, when he {{was four}} years old, his father died. His mother married a former {{governor}} of Syria, Lucius Marcius Philippus. Philippus claimed descent from Alexander the Great, and was elected consul in 56BC. Philippus <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>much</b> of an interest in young Octavius. Because of this, Octavius was raised by his grandmother, Julia, the sister of Julius Caesar.|$|E
5|$|Steph was {{introduced}} as Zara Morgan's (Kelly Greenwood) bitchy friend with {{a penchant for}} humiliating and bullying others. She was touted as a new student for Hollyoaks High and was the first character from the Dean family to be introduced into the series. Over time the character was joined by an on-screen family. She was not initially particularly close to her brothers and sister, although for many years she tried to maintain a relationship with them. Generally, her mother Frankie <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>much</b> time for Steph or her life, usually preferring to involve herself in the lives of Steph's brothers, Craig and Jake, or to boast about her daughter Debbie's professional singing prowess; in contrast Steph had a very close relationship with her father Johnno, who continually supported the family through a number of tough times over the years; however, Steph was hit very hard when he left Hollyoaks in 2005 after discovering that he had an illegitimate baby son.|$|E
25|$|Since the Crown <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>much</b> of a {{case against}} Megrahi, it was no {{surprise}} when the Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission (SCCRC) found prima facie evidence in June 2007 that Megrahi had suffered a miscarriage of justice and recommended that he be granted a second appeal.|$|E

500|$|Robert Christgau of The Village Voice {{gave the}} album an A- letter grade, stating, [...] "I'm real happy this record exists, {{not just because}} Nelson {{can be a great}} interpretive singer—his [...] "Moonlight in Vermont" [...] is a revelation—but [...] because he's {{provided}} me with ten great popular songs that I've <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>much</b> emotional access to." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic gave the record five stars out of five, and said: [...] "(Stardust) showcases Nelson's skills as a musician and his entire aesthetic—where there is nothing separating classic American musical forms, it can all be played together—perhaps better than any other album, which is why it was a sensation upon its release and grows stronger with each passing year." ...|$|E
500|$|Voorhis's campaign, {{described}} by Bullock as [...] "traditionally amateurish and poorly put together", {{was slow to}} perceive the threat presented by Nixon and remained continually on the defensive. [...] In 1971, in an article marking the 25th anniversary of the campaign, Voorhis acknowledged that [...] "I <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>much</b> of an organization; frankly, there was no form to it. [...] And we needed it badly in 1946." [...] In the same article, the Los Angeles Times described Voorhis's campaign as [...] "undermanned, underfinanced, outgunned, outmaneuvered and he apparently was {{on the wrong side}} of most of the issues of the day". [...] His one avenue of outreach in the press was his newspaper column, People's Business, which ran in most local newspapers. In July 1946, Voorhis chose to suspend this column lest it be thought that he was using it as a means of campaigning. According to Gellman, this weakened Voorhis's political outreach.|$|E
500|$|A lone [...] rider {{formed the}} day's breakaway. Daniel Sesma slipped {{ahead of the}} peloton after only [...] Given the stage's flat profile and the limited power one rider can muster on his own, he was allowed an {{advantage}} of nearly ten minutes at one point, before the chase began. When he was caught, at the [...] to go mark, the [...] team took {{to the front of}} the field to try to set up an attack by their leader Giovanni Visconti. Visconti <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>much</b> of an advantage, but the work done by his team did put sprinters like Mark Cavendish into more difficulty than anticipated on the short climb that preceded the finish. For the second day in a row, Cavendish had to chase back on to the main field prior to the mass sprint finale. In the sprint, world champion Thor Hushovd again led out race leader Tyler Farrar, but may have been too strong in so doing, as he briefly opened up a gap on his team leader. Cavendish lost the wheel of his leadout man Mark Renshaw, and again failed to factor into the finish. Hushovd's early leadout left Farrar to go for the finish line from [...] out, which proved too far as Juan José Haedo was able to come around the American at the last moment and just pip him at the line for the victory. Farrar, however, retained the race leadership for another day.|$|E

500|$|After {{it became}} known that Billy, not Cane, fathered Chloe's {{daughter}} Delia, journalist Michael Fairman of On-Air On-Soaps praised the storyline that involved Chloe, Lily, Billy and Cane as [...] "one of soaps all-time best quadrangle story arcs". Jeevan Brar of TV Buzz noted the popularity that Chloe and Billy (a couple that fans have named [...] "Chilly") generated, writing, [...] "A lot of fans saw that pairing end way too quickly {{to make way for}} the ill-fated Billy & Mac redux." [...] Referring to the love triangle between Chance, Chloe and Heather, Nekeeta Borden (also writing for Zap2it) said, [...] "All things considered, will Chance and Chloe survive Hurricane Heather?" [...] In another article, Borden heavily criticized the writing for Chloe's character. She wrote, [...] "Initially I hated the pint-sized minx when she first planted her stilettos in Genoa City and on Lily’s face a few years back, but lately I've come to realize how much I miss the scheming, sassy Chloe of old [...] The pairing with [...] killed poor Chloe dead. She, like Phyllis Newman (Michelle Stafford), is not meant to be some happy housewife, married to a boy scout. Chloe needs a sparring partner and partner-in-crime. She is way too much woman to be cheated on by someone like Chance." [...] Also unfavorable of the relationship was Sara Bibel of Xfinity, who wrote that [...] "Chance and Chloe <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>much</b> chemistry. [...] She was attracted to him because she thought he was a safe, dependable guy who would not cheat on her", describing Chance as [...] "the anti-Billy" [...] in Chloe's eyes.|$|E
2500|$|The Maritimes are {{generally}} socially conservative but unlike Alberta, {{they also have}} fiscally socialist tendencies. It {{is because of the}} lack of support for fiscal conservatism that federal parties such as the Canadian Alliance <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>much</b> success in the region, [...] In the 2004 federal election, the Conservatives had one of the worst showings in the region for a right-wing party, going back to Confederation, with the exception of the 1993 election. The Conservative party improved its seat count in the 2008 and elected 13 MPs in the 2011 election. However, in the 2015 election the Liberal Party won every seat in the region, defeating all of the Conservative (and NDP) challengers.|$|E
2500|$|By the 1792 {{general conference}} of the Methodist Episcopal Church, the {{controversy}} relating to episcopal power boiled over. Ultimately, the delegates sided with Bishop Asbury. However, the Republican Methodists split off from the Methodist Episcopal Church (MEC) in 1792. Also, William Hammet (a missionary ordained by Wesley who traveled to America from Antigua with Bishop Coke), led a successful revolt against the MEC in 1791. He opposed Bishop Asbury and the episcopacy. He formed his people into the American Primitive Methodist Church (not directly connected with the British Primitive Methodist Church). Both American churches operated in the Southeast and presaged the episcopal debates of later reformers. Regardless, Asbury remained the leading bishop of early American Methodism and did not share his [...] "appointing" [...] authority until Bishop McKendree was elected in 1808. Coke had problems with the American preachers. His authoritarian style alienated many. Soon, he became a missionary bishop of sorts and <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>much</b> influence in America.|$|E

Acerola goes too far with his newfound powers and strains his friendship with Laranjinha.|$|R
50|$|This hamlet stood {{close to}} Dalsangan Mill and {{practically}} vanished because the railway was built through its centre and several dwellings were demolished. The mill was worked by Hugh Morton in 1841 {{and was out}} of use by 1860, prompted by the Garroch Burn <b>never</b> <b>having</b> <b>much</b> of a head of water or force of flow.|$|R
