5|$|Argentina is {{vulnerable}} {{and will likely}} be significantly impacted by climate change. Temperatures have increased {{in the last century}} while the observed changes in precipitation are variable, with some areas receiving more and other areas less. These changes have impacted river flow, increased the frequency of extreme weather events, and led to the retreat of glaciers. Based on the projections for both precipitation and temperatures, these climatic events are likely to increase in severity and create <b>new</b> <b>problems</b> associated with climate change in the country.|$|E
5|$|Galen Clark {{retired as}} the state grant's {{guardian}} in 1896, leaving Yosemite Valley and the Mariposa Grove of Big Trees under ineffective stewardship. Pre-existing problems in the state grant worsened and <b>new</b> <b>problems</b> arose, but the cavalry could only monitor the situation. Muir and the Sierra Club continued to lobby the government and influential people {{for the creation of}} a unified Yosemite National Park. The Sierra Club began to organize annual trips to Yosemite in 1901 in an effort to make the remote area more accessible.|$|E
5|$|The {{success and}} {{expansion}} of Islam brought it into contact with different cultures, societies and traditions, {{such as those of}} Byzantines and Persians. With such contact, <b>new</b> <b>problems</b> emerged for Islamic law to tackle. Moreover, there was a significant distance between Medina, the Islamic capital, and the Muslims on the periphery on the Islamic state. Thus far off jurists had to find novel Islamic solutions without the close supervision of the hub of Islamic law (back in Medina). During the Umayyad dynasty, the concept of qiyas was abused by the rulers. The Abbasids, who succeeded the Umayyads defined it more strictly, in an attempt to apply it more consistently.|$|E
5000|$|Second: {{suppose we}} have a problem that we've proven is hard to solve, and {{we have a}} similar <b>new</b> <b>problem.</b> We might suspect that it is also hard to solve. We argue by contradiction: suppose the <b>new</b> <b>problem</b> is easy to solve. Then, if we can show that every {{instance}} of the old problem can be solved easily by transforming it into instances of the <b>new</b> <b>problem</b> and solving those, we have a contradiction. This establishes that the <b>new</b> <b>problem</b> is also hard.|$|R

2500|$|The typical {{method of}} proving {{a problem to}} be {{undecidable}} is with the technique of reduction. [...] To do this, it is sufficient to show that if {{a solution to the}} <b>new</b> <b>problem</b> were found, it could be used to decide an undecidable problem by transforming instances of the undecidable problem into instances of the <b>new</b> <b>problem.</b> [...] Since we already know that no method can decide the old problem, no method can decide the <b>new</b> <b>problem</b> either. Often the <b>new</b> <b>problem</b> is reduced to solving the halting problem. (Note: the same technique is used to demonstrate that a problem is NP complete, only in this case, rather than demonstrating that there is no solution, it demonstrates there is no polynomial time solution, assuming P ≠ NP).|$|R
5|$|Charles X of Sweden had {{concluded}} the earlier war with Denmark with a stunning victory by succeeding in the bold March across the Belts. Denmark-Norway {{had been forced}} into a humiliating peace in the Treaty of Roskilde in which Denmark had to cede Scania, Halland and Blekinge on the Scandinavian Peninsula and the island of Bornholm, and Norway lost the provinces of Båhuslen and Trøndelag. Europe {{was stunned by the}} quick victory, and Charles proudly publicized his accomplishments. However, peace meant <b>new</b> <b>problems.</b> In the peace treaty of Roskilde, Denmark was obliged to supply the Swedish army with provisions until May 1658, but soon thereafter the army would need to be moved. The Swedish king knew that the army {{would not be able to}} be supplied in Sweden for long, and disbanding it was not desirable with the Poles eager to revenge the 1655 invasion of Poland. Sweden was not in want of enemies to attack: campaigns in Livonia and Estonia were considered, but were rejected due to supply problems. The Swedish King maintained that his main goal was to invade Royal Prussia, but he also wanted to punish Frederick William of Brandenburg-Prussia. The many enemies in continental Europe, among them Poland and a hostile Dutch would make this a difficult endeavor however. A new attack on Prussia would also see little international support, France was already urging peace. The surprising Swedish solution to this dilemma would be to return to Denmark in an attempt to finish the job.|$|E
5|$|The great {{accomplishment}} of the Hortensian Law {{was in that}} it deprived the Patricians of their final weapon over the Plebeians. Therefore, the new Patricio-Plebeian aristocracy replaced the old Patrician aristocracy, and the last great political question of the earlier era had been resolved. As such, no important political changes occurred between 287 BC and 133 BC. This entire era was dominated by foreign wars, which eliminated the {{need to address the}} flaws in the current political system, since the patriotism of the Plebeians suppressed their desire for further reforms. However, this era created <b>new</b> <b>problems,</b> which began to be realized {{near the end of the}} 2nd century BC. For example, the nature of Rome's military commanders changed. Roman soldiers of earlier eras fought short wars, and then returned to their farms. Since their generals did the same thing, the soldiers came to view their generals as being nothing more than fellow citizen-soldiers. Now, however, wars were becoming longer and of a larger scale. Thus, this period saw a growing affinity between the average citizen and his general, while the generals acquired more power than they had ever held before.|$|E

50|$|Decomposition methods {{create a}} problem that is easy to solve from an {{arbitrary}} one. Each variable of this <b>new</b> <b>problem</b> is associated {{to a set of}} original variables; its domain contains tuples of values for the variables in the associated set; in particular, these are the tuples that satisfy a set of constraints over these variables. The constraints of the <b>new</b> <b>problem</b> bounds the values of two new variables to have as values two tuples that agree on the shared original variables. Three further conditions ensure that the <b>new</b> <b>problem</b> is equivalent to the old one and can be solved efficiently.|$|R

The trustworthiness of a CBR solution depends on whether the <b>new</b> <b>problem</b> falls within this realm. An indication of the trustworthiness of a CBR solution allows the user to decide whether to use the solution. This paper proposes a set of decision criteria which indicate trustworthiness, based on the relative similarities of the items in the case library...|$|R

25|$|In September 1398, <b>new</b> <b>problems</b> arose for the Hollanders: an insurrection {{against their}} rule {{broke out in}} Achtkarspelen, a small Frisian {{territory}} on the eastern border of Oostergo. Albert sent 250 English mercenaries to quash the unrest, which was quickly achieved, but the event made clear that Hollandic domination in the Frisian territories could not stop at the eastern border of Oostergo, because then the free territories which lay further east, across the Lauwers river, would always remain {{a threat to the}} count's rule.|$|E

To fix the problem, Representative Juan Alano filed a bill in Congress to separate Basilan from Zamboanga City. So the island of Basilan was proclaimed a separate city through Republic Act No. 288 on July 16, 1948.|$|E

25|$|By the 1970s, <b>new</b> <b>problems</b> such as overpopulation, limited natural {{resources}} and pollution {{that could not be}} solved by normal hierarchical systems had arrived. Jay Forrester stated that he knew how to solve this problem. He applied systems theory to the problem and drew a cybernetic system diagram for the world. This was turned into a computer model, which predicted population collapse. This became the basis of the model that was used by the Club of Rome, and the findings from this were published in The Limits to Growth. Forrester then argued for zero growth in order to maintain a steady equilibrium within the capacity of the Earth.|$|E
25|$|The {{purpose of}} the reform program was not to abandon {{communism}} but {{to make it work}} better by substantially increasing the role of market mechanisms in the system and by reducing—not eliminating—government planning and direct control. The process of reform was incremental. New measures were first introduced experimentally in a few localities and then were popularized and disseminated nationally if they proved successful. By 1987 the program had achieved remarkable results in increasing supplies of food and other consumer goods and had created a new climate of dynamism and opportunity in the economy. At the same time, however, the reforms also had created <b>new</b> <b>problems</b> and tensions, leading to intense questioning and political struggles over the program's future.|$|E
25|$|Rabinow {{holds that}} {{concepts}} are tools {{designed to be}} used on specified problems and calibrated {{to the production of}} pragmatic outcomes both analytic and ethical. As such, concepts must be adjusted to the changing topology of problem spaces. Concept work involves archaeological, genealogical, and diagnostic dimensions. Archaeologically, concept work involves investigating and characterizing concepts as part of a prior repertoire or structured conceptual ensemble. Genealogically, concept work frees concepts from their field of emergence by showing the contingent history of their selection, formation, as well as their potential contemporary significance. Diagnostically, concept work involves a critical function: testing the adequacy and appropriateness of a given concept or repertoire of concepts to <b>new</b> <b>problems</b> and purposes.|$|E
