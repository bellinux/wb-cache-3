5|$|A minor {{excavation}} {{was undertaken}} by George Marçais in the 1920s. Slimane Mostafa Zbiss conducted {{a more thorough}} excavation in the 1950s of the palace in the southeast quadrant of the city. Further excavations by a Franco-Tunisian team were made around the southeast palace in the late 1970s, ending in 1982. Few results have been published from these earlier excavations, and <b>no</b> <b>records</b> were made of the stratigraphic locations of the stucco fragments that were found.|$|E
5|$|A. r. obscura, {{described}} by Donald R. Dickey and Adriaan van Rossem in 1923, {{is found in}} the Channel Islands of California on Santa Cruz, Anacapa, and formerly on Santa Catalina. While the Santa Catalina population has not been observed since 1863, the subspecies seems to have colonized Anacapa Island. <b>No</b> <b>records</b> exist of them before 1940. This subspecies is similar to A. r. canescens but is darker.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Bockscar {{returned}} to the United States in November 1945 and served with the 509th at Roswell Army Air Field, New Mexico. It was nominally assigned to the Operation Crossroads task force, but there are <b>no</b> <b>records</b> indicating that it deployed for the tests. In August 1946, it {{was assigned to the}} 4105th Army Air Force Unit at Davis-Monthan Army Air Field, Arizona, for storage.|$|E
30|$|Among 481 fixtures, {{there was}} <b>no</b> <b>record</b> of fixture {{diameter}} in 8 fixtures, {{and there was}} <b>no</b> <b>record</b> of fixture length in 9 fixtures. Fifty-eight fixtures had <b>no</b> <b>record</b> of bone width, 51 fixtures had <b>no</b> <b>record</b> of bone height, and 2 fixtures had no information about bone graft.|$|R

5|$|Both of the Russian Toy {{varieties}} can be {{crossed and}} produce smooth- and long-coated puppies {{from the same}} litter. In addition, when two smooth-coated dogs are bred together, they may occasionally bear a long-coated offspring if the long hair gene is present in their pedigrees. However, there have been <b>no</b> <b>records</b> of two long-coated Russian Toys breeding together and producing smooth-coated offspring.|$|E
5|$|Conversely, {{there are}} <b>no</b> <b>records</b> of a {{large-scale}} Greek slave revolt {{comparable to that}} of Spartacus in Rome. It can probably be explained by the relative dispersion of Greek slaves, which would have prevented any large-scale planning. Slave revolts were rare, even in Rome. Individual acts of rebellion of slaves against their master, though scarce, are not unheard of; a judicial speech mentions the attempted murder of his master by a boy slave, not 12 years old.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though the}} Romney Literary Society's {{membership}} was relatively small, its debates and activities were frequently discussed throughout the Potomac Highlands region. For this reason, the society greatly influenced trends of {{thought in the}} Romney community and surrounding areas. <b>No</b> <b>records</b> of the society's proceedings, works, or membership enrollments spanning the period between January 22, 1830 and 1861 are extant. During this period, the society counted among its members Angus William McDonald, John Baker White, and Robert White.|$|E

5|$|Further rumours {{circulated}} {{about the}} death of Corder and Marten's child. Both claimed that they had taken their dead child to be buried in Sudbury, but <b>no</b> <b>records</b> of this could be discovered and no trace was found of the child's burial site. In his written confession, Corder admitted that he and Marten had argued {{on the day of the}} murder over the possibility of the burial site being discovered.|$|E
5|$|However, {{with the}} {{increase}} in paved roads and the increasing size of cities, snow-paving fell out of favour, as the resultant slippery surfaces posed a danger to pedestrians and traffic. The earliest patents for snowplows date back to 1840, but there are <b>no</b> <b>records</b> of their actual use until 1862, when the city of Milwaukee began operating horse-drawn carts fitted with snowplows. The horse-drawn snowplow quickly spread to other cities, especially those in areas prone to heavy snowfall.|$|E
5|$|In 1850, the Duchess of Kent's new comptroller, Sir George Couper, {{studied the}} old accounts. He found huge discrepancies. <b>No</b> <b>records</b> for her {{household}} or personal expenses {{had been kept}} after 1829. There was also no record of nearly £50,000 the Duchess had received from her brother, Leopold, nor of an additional £10,000 from William IV.|$|E

5|$|Karamokho Alfa's {{maternal}} {{cousin was}} Maka Jiba, {{the ruler of}} Bundu, and both men studied in Fugumba under the famous scholar Tierno Samba. However, there are <b>no</b> <b>records</b> of Bundu participation in the Futa Jallon jihad, {{perhaps because of the}} internal troubles in Bundu at that time, or perhaps because Maka Jiba was not greatly interested in the cause.|$|E
5|$|<b>No</b> <b>records</b> of the Maine Coon's exact {{origins and}} date of {{introduction}} to the United States exist, so several competing hypotheses have been suggested. The breed was popular in cat shows in the late 19th century, but its existence became threatened when long-haired breeds from overseas were introduced in the early 20th century. The Maine Coon has since made a comeback and {{is now one of}} the more popular cat breeds in the world.|$|E
5|$|On 5 February 2009 a fire {{broke out}} at the west wing on {{the third and fourth}} floor of the College building. Eight London Fire Brigade fire engines were able to bring the flames under control, in the {{meantime}} 35 people were evacuated from the building and a further 100 from adjacent buildings. Fortunately <b>no</b> <b>records</b> or books of the College were damaged. Repairs to the smoke-damaged rooms and exterior brickwork were completed in December 2009.|$|E

5|$|Scully {{reports that}} the Crew Cut Man had <b>no</b> <b>records</b> on file with the FBI or other agencies. The {{material}} injected into the cows and children {{is found to be}} an unknown substance. All the children who were inoculated came down with a flu-like illness while those in the Church of the Red Museum did not, causing her to think they were a control group. Scully declares the case open and unsolved.|$|E
5|$|Sources {{disagree}} on the house's initial construction date, and <b>no</b> <b>records</b> survive of its construction. There is some archaeological evidence dating parts of the building to the 15th century; William Robinson's History and Antiquities of the Parish of Tottenham (1840) suggests a date of about 1514, although the Royal Commission on Historic Monuments attributes it to the late 16th century. Nikolaus Pevsner speculates the front may have formed part of a courtyard house of which the remainder has disappeared.|$|E
5|$|The Javan {{rhinoceros}} never {{fared well}} in captivity. The oldest {{lived to be}} 20, about half the age that the rhinos can reach in the wild. <b>No</b> <b>records</b> are known of a captive rhino giving birth. The last captive Javan rhino died at the Adelaide Zoo in Australia in 1907, where the species was so little known {{that it had been}} exhibited as an Indian rhinoceros.|$|E

5|$|The {{history of}} nipple {{piercing}}, navel piercing, and genital piercing {{has been particularly}} misrepresented by printed works continuing to repeat myths that were originally promulgated by Malloy in the pamphlet Body & Genital Piercing in Brief. For example, according to Malloy's colleague Jim Ward, Malloy claimed navel piercing was popular among ancient Egyptian aristocrats and was depicted in Egyptian statuary, a claim that is widely repeated. Other sources say there are <b>no</b> <b>records</b> to support a historical practice for navel piercing.|$|E
5|$|The only {{surviving}} {{record of}} the trial is the speech given by Theomnestus and Apollodorus against Neaira and Stephanus, and the outcome is unknown. <b>No</b> <b>records</b> of Neaira exist after the trial. Modern commentators have noted the weaknesses in Apollodorus' arguments, though as the outcome of an Athenian trial depended heavily on what the parties involved could persuade the jury to accept, {{and how much of}} their dishonesty they could get away with, we cannot say for certain that the suit failed.|$|E
5|$|Women {{appear to}} have been allowed {{considerable}} freedom and independence during this period. Dutthagamani frequently sought his mother's advice during his military campaign. Rock inscriptions show that women donated caves and temples {{for the use of the}} sangha. However, there are <b>no</b> <b>records</b> of women holding any administrative posts. It is not clear if women were given equal footing with men, but they did have complete freedom in religious matters.|$|E
