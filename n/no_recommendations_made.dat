The same accusations were also levelled by same other U.A.E. officials on other occasions but with no substantiations to support them. These are flatly wrong and that <b>no</b> <b>recommendations</b> <b>made</b> them credible. On the contrary, its repulsive and hypocritical on a country whose jet fighters are bombing Saudi-led intervention in Yemen when accusing Iran of interference in domestic affairs of other countries. It is farcical we a regime who has exported extremist taqfiri ideologies in Syria, Lebanon and other places to dystabilise the region. Officials have insulted Iran's integrity with claims to the Persian Gulf Islands. We reject the claim the islands {{are a part of}} Iran. No claim, no matter the repetition, will not dent it in any way. Moreover, taking Israeli representatives' statement we realise they are in line with the Israeli statement. With alignment with Israeli and regional regimes, in light of the U.A.E. statement, is not a coincidence. It shows how the respective regimes come together and its Persian Gulf allies are working with the Israelis and are tantamount to betraying the Palestinian people. In reference to the JCPOA...we know its partners tried to impede the road to a bill. After the fruition of the JCPOA, have been escalated provocations on Iran...we regret the work to deescalate is not reciprocated by the others." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{problem with}} which {{this study is}} {{concerned}} {{is that of a}} descriptive analysis of counseling techniques being used by selected child welfare workers. The method determining the counseling techniques being used was a questionnaire. Seven counseling techniques were tested on the questionnaire. The questionnaire was developed through the use of various sources. Validity and reliability of the questionnaire were not tested. The findings were inconclusive, based upon the data. The workers tended to show eclectic use of techniques. Psychoanalysis and client-centered therapy did poll the greatest number of positive responses. Z-scores and probability between the counseling techniques were determined. The findings supported the responses received by psychoanalysis and client-centered therapy. <b>No</b> <b>recommendations</b> were <b>made...</b>|$|R

Current evidence suggests a benefit in efficacy for O 2 -O 3 -nucleolysis when compared to steroid injections alone with no difference regarding safety.
