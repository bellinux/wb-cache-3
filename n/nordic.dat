Alfa <b>Nordics</b> will double their number of employees by the end of 2010 and we were asked to investigate how Alfa <b>Nordics</b> should enable this growth while keep being successful in having high profits, a strong brand, motivated employees and satisfied clients. By using theories about KBOs (Knowledge-Based Organizations) and conducting interviews with employees at Alfa <b>Nordics</b> we identified what makes Alfa <b>Nordics</b> successful today and what they should do to keep these success factors when growing. To keep their success within the organization Alfa should keep the execution teams small, recruit a resource manager and improve the knowledge exchange between the countries. To keep making successful engagements they should keep defining the problem in the best way for the client, ensuring sales and keep having the right employees. To keep their success in employing top consultants they should be visible in talented people environments, show that they are growing, develop a more thorough recruiting plan...|$|R

Its development was no isolated phenomenon, drawing on existing classical traditions in the <b>Nordic</b> countries, and from new ideas being pursued in German-speaking cultures. It can thus be characterised as a combination of direct and indirect influences from vernacular architecture (<b>Nordic,</b> Italian and German) and Neoclassicism.|$|E
