25|$|Proposals for a northerly VTS arose around 2000 and {{the plans}} approve din 2003. The station became {{operational}} on 1 January 2007 and was jointly located with Vardø Radio. It was issued {{the task of}} a new traffic separation scheme and the emergency tugboat service.

25|$|The {{main task}} is {{monitoring}} all ship traffic {{along in the}} mandated zone {{with the goal of}} detecting irregularities. A primary goal is to avoid accidents through communication with relevant ships and taking necessary actions. NOR VTS is responsible for dispatching the five tugboats which make up the State Emergency Tow Response Service. It is also responsible for issuing extreme weather warnings, as well as coordinating messages in <b>Navarea</b> XIX. This covers the waters between Greenland and the Norway–Russia border north of the 65th parallel north. NOR VTS also records statistics on traffic, including single-hull tankers. The VTS retains information exchange with Iceland and a mutual notification of acute pollution with Russia. The center is manned around the clock.|$|E
50|$|<b>NAVAREAs</b> are {{mentioned}} in International Maritime Organization Assembly Resolution A.706(17) adopted 6 November 1991.|$|R
50|$|<b>NAVAREAs</b> are the {{geographic}} {{areas in which}} various governments are responsible for navigation and weather warnings.|$|R
5000|$|The International Hydrographic Organization {{publication}} S-53 has {{a document}} entitled [...] "Worldwide Navigational Warnings Service - Guidance Document" [...] which {{is related to}} <b>NAVAREAs.</b>|$|R
50|$|Navigational {{warnings}} {{are issued}} regularly and usually give information about people or vessels in distress and objects or events {{that can be}} an immediate danger to people at sea {{and how they are}} navigating. In the United States,MARAD (Marine Administration) sends out infrequent advisories about potential global political climate dangers.There are four types of navigational warnings, which are categorized by their location. These areas are <b>NAVAREA</b> IV, HYDROLANT, <b>NAVAREA</b> XII, and HYDROPAC. Meteorological information is information that is about the marine atmosphere. These meteorological advisories include the development of weather systems such as and not limited to, rain squalls, big tidal drops, major current shifts, lightning storms, hurricane and tsunami warnings, high winds, and cyclones.|$|E

5000|$|The Chief Hydrographer to the Government of India is the {{executive}} head of the Indian Naval Hydrographic Department. The Chief Hydrographer is generally held by a rear admiral or vice admiral from the Indian Navy. The Chief Hydrographer is also the coordinator for charting Area [...] "J" [...] in the North Indian Ocean and <b>NAVAREA</b> VIII coordinator.|$|E
50|$|METAREAs are {{geographical}} {{sea regions}} {{for the purpose}} of coordinating the transmission of meteorological information to mariners on international voyages through international and territorial waters. These regions are part of the Global Maritime Distress Safety System. The regions are identical to <b>NAVAREAs</b> which are used to coordinate the transmission of navigational hazards to the same mariners. Mariners receive the meteorological and navigational information via NAVTEX. The Joint WMO/IOC (Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission) Technical Commission for Oceanography and Marine Meteorology is the responsible agency for the coordination of the dissemination of this information for METAREAs and <b>NAVAREAs.</b>|$|R
50|$|The main {{mission of}} the SHN is to provide safe {{navigation}} on national waters. The service do so with the creation and maintenance of nautical charts, coastal marker buoys, and lighthouses. In concordance to the International Maritime Organization regulations, the SHN is also the global coordinator for the <b>NAVAREA</b> VI zone, which covers the South West Atlantic Ocean region being responsible for emitting alerts to ships at sea and coordinating search and rescue operations.|$|E

50|$|Each station {{identifier}} has a fixed 10-minute time slot, {{starting with}} A at 0000UTC. The time slots are repeated at 4 hour intervals. Within each time slot, {{a mix of}} navigation warnings, weather forecasts, ice information and other content may be sent, and this is normally according to a structured plan for that specific station. For example, {{in the first and}} third time slot they may decide to transmit navigation warnings, and weather forecasts in the others. Normally each <b>NAVAREA</b> or sub-NAVAREA has only one station at each slot.|$|E

50|$|Satellite systems {{operated}} by the Inmarsat company, overseen by the International Mobile Satellite Organization (IMSO) are also important elements of the GMDSS. The types of Inmarsat ship earth station terminals recognized by the GMDSS are: Inmarsat B, C and F77. Inmarsat B and F77, {{an updated version of}} the now redundant Inmarsat A, provide ship/shore, ship/ship and shore/ship telephone, telex and high-speed data services, including a distress priority telephone and telex service to and from rescue coordination centers. Fleet 77 fully supports the Global Maritime Distress and Safety System (GMDSS) and includes advanced features such as emergency call prioritisation. The Inmarsat C provides ship/shore, shore/ship and ship/ship store-and-forward data and email messaging, the capability for sending preformatted distress messages to a rescue coordination center, and the Inmarsat C SafetyNET service. The Inmarsat C SafetyNET service is a satellite-based worldwide maritime safety information broadcast service of high seas weather warnings, <b>NAVAREA</b> navigational warnings, radionavigation warnings, ice reports and warnings generated by the USCG-conducted International Ice Patrol, and other similar information not provided by NAVTEX. SafetyNET works similarly to NAVTEX in areas outside NAVTEX coverage.|$|E
