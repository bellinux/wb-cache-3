50|$|The Power <b>Loom</b> <b>Carpet</b> Weavers' and Textile Workers' Union (PLCWTWU) was a {{trade union}} {{representing}} {{workers in the}} textile industry in the Kidderminster area of England.|$|R
5000|$|In 1917, {{the union}} began admitting women and textile workers outside carpet and {{tapestry}} weaving, changing {{its name to}} the Power <b>Loom</b> <b>Carpet</b> Weavers' and Textile Workers' Association. This produced a jump in membership, which reached 4,500 by the end of 1918, and remained fairly constant thereafter, peaking at 6,000 in 1980. The 1980s proved a difficult time for the union as the industry declined in the Kidderminster area, and membership had fallen to 2,300 by 1991. [...] It changed its name slightly to the [...] "Power <b>Loom</b> <b>Carpet</b> Weavers' and Textile Workers' Union" [...] then, in 2000, it merged into the Iron and Steel Trades Confederation.|$|R
50|$|The {{union was}} founded in 1865 and was {{initially}} named the Power <b>Loom</b> Brussels <b>Carpet</b> Weavers Defence Association. In its early days, it advocated for the emigration of unemployed carpet weavers, in order that they could find alternative work elsewhere, and competition in the industry would be reduced. This idea was soon abandoned, and in 1869 the union began admitting tapestry weavers in the area, changing {{its name to the}} Power <b>Loom</b> <b>Carpet</b> Weavers Mutual Defence and Provident Association.|$|R
50|$|However {{the decline}} of British {{manufacturing}} jobs in these industries led the union to diversify its membership merging with the National League of the Blind and Disabled (NLBD) in 1999 and the Power <b>Loom</b> <b>Carpet</b> Weavers and Textile Workers Union (PLCWTWU) in 2000.|$|R

50|$|The Northern Carpet Trades Union (NCTU) was a {{trade union}} in the United Kingdom. It was first formed in 1892 in Halifax, West Yorkshire, later {{expanding}} {{to cover all}} of Northern England. The NCTU was formed later than the Power <b>Loom</b> <b>Carpet</b> Weavers' and Textile Workers' Association, based in Kidderminster, and was considerably smaller. Approximately a fifth of eligible workers {{were members of the}} NCTU in 1939, compared to 50 percent for the Kidderminster union. Attempts to amalgamate all unions in the carpet trade failed, but in 1917 the National Affiliation of Carpet Trade Unions was established with equal representation from the NCTU, Scottish Carpet Workers' Union, National Union of Dyers, Bleachers and Textile Workers and Power <b>Loom</b> <b>Carpet</b> Weavers and Textile Workers Association.|$|R

50|$|Carpets were woven in town {{manufactures}} by organized manufactories. Usually, town manufactures have {{a larger}} range of patterns and ornaments and more artistically developed designs which can be executed by the weavers, the palette of colours is rich, and the weaving technique may be finer due to their access to high-quality wool, and the employment of specialized weavers. Larger formats can be produced on the larger, stationary <b>looms.</b> <b>Carpets</b> are woven from cartoons, using material provided by the manufacturer. The town manufactories may accept commissions even from foreign countries, and produce carpets for export.|$|R

40|$|A {{systematic}} approach {{to improve the}} existing tools and processes used by the artisans engaged in carpet sectors to enhance the productivity {{and the quality of}} the finished products in a cost effective manner have been initiated in 2000 by IIT Delhi [1]. Several machines like <b>Carpet</b> <b>Loom,</b> Scrapping Machine, Drying Machine, and Tools used in carpet manufacturing have been developed and tested in many carpet manufacturing belts, namely, Bhadohi, Mirzapur, Jaipur, Srinagar and other places of India. Among those two machines, namely, a <b>carpet</b> <b>loom</b> and a scrapping machine are taken up in this paper for further improvement to reduce their cost. The loom is a static structure and the scrapping machine is a dynamic system. This paper presents the overview of these newly developed machines and the associated features. In order to get wider acceptance to the users, the machines should be available at affordable prices. Hence, as a part of further improvement, modelling and optimization of the loom [4] and scrapping machines are undertaken. Key word- <b>Carpet</b> <b>Loom,</b> Scrapping Machine, Handmade Carpet...|$|R
50|$|Smith became {{interested}} in manufacturing, and in 1844 established a shop in West Farms for making <b>looms</b> and <b>carpets.</b> The shop caught fire and was rebuilt, and after a second fire in 1864 Smith reestablished his business in Yonkers. His business prospered, especially after he invented a loom suitable for weaving fine carpets, which other carpet makers used under licensing agreements with Smith, and his two factories eventually employed more than 3,000 people.|$|R
40|$|Low {{temperature}} {{fabric filter}} plants normally utilize bags manufactured from Polyacrylonitrile (PAN). Although these bags are cheaper than high temperature bags, manufactured from Polyphenylenesulphide (PPS), they {{are prone to}} shrinkage. Shrinkage in a fabric filter plant is problematic {{in the sense that}} it not only affects the performance of the bags, but indeed, of the whole gas cleaning system. Some of the areas affected are permeability, cleanability and strength. The shrinkage can be chemical of nature. This is related to the cyclisation of the PAN fibers due to heat or chemical attack. The shrinkage could also be physical of nature, which means the shrinkage is caused by the elastic memory of the fibers and stresses induced in the felt during manufacturing. Heat setting of the fabric is very important and differences of parameters during the heat setting process are responsible for differences in the shrinkage behaviour of adjacent bags in the same bag house, constructed of the same fibre and in the same <b>needling</b> <b>loom.</b> This paper deals with the reasons for bag shrinkage and how it could be managed...|$|R
5000|$|The {{museum was}} {{designed}} by architect Abdol-Aziz Mirza Farmanfarmaian.

40|$|Abstract. Firstly, {{based on}} the {{structure}} of tufted <b>carpet</b> <b>looms</b> (DHGN 801 D- 400), the lumped parameter models were built, in which included the massless shafts, lumped masses, disk and elastic support. Secondly, according to various parts of the relationship between force and deformation, the transfer matrix of right and left ends were established, thus the universal transfer matrix of shaft units was determined by solving the various parts transfer matrix simultaneously. Thirdly, the dynamic behavior model of coupling shafts in tufted <b>carpet</b> <b>looms</b> was given, and different natural frequencies were acquired by simulating the model in Matlab. Lastly, the dynamic behavior model using transfer matrix was verified to be effective and feasible by experiment. Introductions The structure of coupling shafts in weaving equipments is very complicated. Many parallel axis and multiple sets of drive mechanisms are included, and every parallel axis is multi-span rotor system with bearing different dynamic load...|$|R
50|$|The {{technically}} more advanced, stationary vertical looms {{are used}} in villages and town manufactures. The more advanced types of vertical looms are more comfortable, as they allow for the weavers to retain their position throughout the entire weaving process. In essence, {{the width of the}} carpet is limited by the length of the loom beams. While the dimensions of a horizontal loom define the maximum size of the rug which can be woven on it, on a vertical <b>loom</b> longer <b>carpets</b> can be woven, as the completed sections of the rugs can be moved {{to the back of the}} loom, or rolled up on a beam, as the weaving proceeds.|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Master) [...] İzmir Institute of Technology, Mechanical Engineering, İzmir, 2009 Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves: 61 - 63) Text in English; Abstract: Turkish and Englishix, 63 leavesThis thesis {{covers a}} study on the design of micromechanisms which are capable of imitating the knotting operation and their applications on carpet manufacturing. For this purpose, motion generation synthesis of a planar two degree-of-freedom serial manipulator is performed for a given path by using interpolation approximation. For a given four points, four design parameters are solved as a result of non-linear equations. Also, analysis of each stages of knotting operation is kinematically performed for the design of a cam-actuated mechanism which is designed as an alternative concept. Results of these analysis are used for the design of cam profiles those of which actuates the manipulators. After design stage of knotting micromechanisms, fully automated <b>carpet</b> <b>loom</b> design is introduced for a real-life experiment of designed mechanisms. Finally, assembly considerations of <b>carpet</b> <b>loom</b> and knotting mechanisms are given for carpet manufacturing purpose...|$|R
50|$|In 1941, Michael Kraus began {{importing}} fabrics to Canada. In 1946 {{he formed}} a partnership to manufacture fabric. Initially adopting fabric <b>looms</b> to manufacture <b>carpet,</b> he founded Kraus Carpet Mills in 1959. A daring expansion into fibre extrusion, he founded Strudex Fibres in 1971. By {{his death in}} 2003, Kraus companies employed over 900 people at facilities across Canada, in the United States and in Australia.|$|R

5000|$|The modern carpet {{industry}} {{was founded in}} the area in 1785 by Brintons, and the carpet industry became extremely important to the local economy, {{so much so that the}} local newspaper is still named The Shuttle after the shuttles used on the <b>carpet</b> <b>looms.</b> [...] By 1951 there were over thirty carpet manufacturers in the town, including, for example Quayle & Tranter (now defunct) who commissioned notable artists including George Bain for their traditional designs.Aided by a 2004 grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund, a museum dedicated to the Kidderminster Carpet Industry was officially opened by Lord Cobham in 2012.|$|R
60|$|Yesterday evening Mr. William Morris {{delivered}} a most interesting and fascinating lecture on Carpet and Tapestry Weaving at the Arts and Crafts Exhibition now {{held at the}} New Gallery. Mr. Morris had small practical models of the two <b>looms</b> used, the <b>carpet</b> <b>loom</b> where the weaver {{sits in front of}} his work; the more elaborate tapestry loom where the weaver sits behind, {{at the back of the}} stuff, has his design outlined on the upright threads and sees in a mirror the shadow of the pattern and picture as it grows gradually to perfection. He spoke at much length on the question of dyes--praising madder and kermes for reds, precipitate of iron or ochre for yellows, and for blue either indigo or woad. At the back of the platform hung a lovely Flemish tapestry of the fourteenth century, and a superb Persian carpet about two hundred and fifty years old. Mr. Morris pointed out the loveliness of the carpet--its delicate suggestion of hawthorn blossom, iris and rose, its rejection of imitation and shading; and showed how it combined the great quality of decorative design--being at once clear and well defined in form: each outline exquisitely traced, each line deliberate in its intention and its beauty, and the whole effect being one of unity, of harmony, almost of mystery, the colours being so perfectly harmonised together and the little bright notes of colour being so cunningly placed either for tone or brilliancy.|$|R
5000|$|In 1839 he {{contracted}} {{to produce a}} power-loom capable of weaving two-ply ingrain carpets, such as had been hitherto woven exclusively by the handloom, which only produced eight yards a day. With his first loom he succeeded in obtaining ten or twelve yards daily, which he increased by improvements until a product of twenty-five yards was regularly obtained. Afterward he invented a power loom for weaving [...] "Brussels" [...] (i.e. pictorial tapestry) and velvet tapestry carpets, his most important invention, which attracted much attention at the World's Fair in London in 1851. The town of Clinton, Massachusetts, owed its growth and manufacturing importance to him, as it contained the coach-lace works, the Lancaster Quilt Company, and the Bigelow Carpet Company, {{all of which were}} direct results of his inventive ability. The <b>carpet</b> <b>loom</b> made his name widely known.|$|R
40|$|India {{produces}} a large variety of carpets {{in terms of}} quality, size, and raw material. At present, carpets are woven on wooden looms, which have several drawbacks, like susceptibility to termites, low life (2 - 3 years), loss of environment friendly trees, etc. Moreover, {{it is very difficult}} to provide tension to the warp, as it requires 4 to 5 persons and about 30 - 40 minutes. The tension is given by pulling a rope tied with a metal rod on the upper and lower beams. The present work deals with the design and development of a <b>carpet</b> <b>loom,</b> which can overcome all the above problems faced due to the wooden structure. Metallic channels and beams are used. Field trials indicate that the designed metallic looms in which one person can easily give tension in about 10 min are very much acceptable to the users. Moreover, beam bending is also very small, providing uniform tension that improves the quality of carpets...|$|R
50|$|Now after {{a period}} of 8 years, around 2800 plots have been allotted and the {{population}} is about 18,000 persons. Five doctors provide health services along with permanent health care unit of Family Planning Association of Pakistan. Private buses ply every 30 minutes. There are 110 shops to serve the daily need of the population. More than 247 <b>carpet</b> <b>looms</b> provide jobs to at least 600 persons. In 8 years residents have collected and spent some 5.0 million rupees in water supply, sewerage and electrification in the Basti. Presently every house has electricity and indoor water supply. Over 2000 houses have already been built. The most important fact is that the allottees have occupied their plots and they live there as they built their houses. Nearly all families started with reed-huts and within a short period all houses have been converted into permanent structures. However, majority of the roofs are still not weather proof.|$|R
5000|$|From {{the early}} 1920s {{through the early}} 1960s, Dilmaghani owned three {{factories}} in Kerman, and several in Tabriz and Sarouk, Persia. Based on quality, these carpets were subjected to the highest import tax assessment determined by United States Customs. In 1929, Dilmaghani adapted a crown and laurel woven into specific rugs to supplement or substitute the long-time run of Dilmaghani signatures. Mehdi Dilmaghani & Co. Inc. registered several variations of their Cyrus Crown trademark in 1934. [...] Post mid 20th century, Dilmaghani still traded and imported Kerman carpets, and the Cyrus Crown trademark remains active and in use today. Over the course of nearly sixty years, Mehdi manufactured an estimated 25,000 Crown Kerman, Crown Sarouks and Crown Tabriz Carpets ranging from 2'x3' to 15' x 30' in size. Crown carpets were extensively documented, and the firm still retains many original production records including weaver names and <b>loom</b> dates for <b>carpets</b> from the 1930s.|$|R
5000|$|Killybegs {{is famous}} for its {{tapestries}} and carpets, some of which were produced on the biggest <b>carpet</b> <b>loom</b> in the world at the [...] "Donegal Carpet Factory". The carpets, known as Donegals, are hand-knotted in the Turkish style. The carpets have adorned many important buildings in Ireland such as Dublin Castle, the Royal Hospital Kilmainham, Áras an Uachtaráin, Buckingham Palace and internationally the Vatican, The White House, 10 Downing Street and most state buildings around the world. The factory in Killybegs closed in 2003 and has been open since 2006 as the Maritime & Heritage Centre. The Centre provides information on the carpet making and the fishing industry. Tours are conducted daily and visitors can watch smaller carpets being made and try making a knot. There is also a ship simulator which is the most modern in Ireland. The simulator offers three levels of technique providing great fun for children and the not so young testing their navigation skills. The centre is open all year round.|$|R
40|$|Morrales or net {{bags are}} an {{important}} man’s accessory in rural Guatemala, and many are made from maguey fibers using the ancient techniques of thigh spinning, and simple looping. Adaptations to these styles probably began when neighboring Mayan and Xinca tribes exchanged ideas as they {{came in contact with}} each other in times of trade and conflict. With Spain’s colonization, new tools such as spinning wheels, knitting <b>needles,</b> and <b>looms,</b> along with their uses, were incorporated into bag construction. The sailors who transported these early explorers likely introduced the strap methods of braiding, and knotwork, and with the introduction of horses there became a demand for horse gear, such as saddlebags. One community abandoned their ancestral homeland for the present one, and brought unique bag making skills with them. More recently, missionaries, and international aid workers living in remote communities have introduced new techniques, and styles, while globalization has brought additional products and materials into these same villages. Movement of people {{as a result of the}} recent civil war, and economics has also affected morral making. Even a researcher such as myself can influence the production of bags made in the republic. All of these events have transformed morrales, and today besides being looped, bags are woven, knit, crocheted, and linked. From the first people to the present, learn what morrales can reveal about Guatemala’s unique land, its people and their history...|$|R
60|$|What {{manner of}} men they were {{it is hard}} to say, so few details are left to us. But we may {{conceive}} them as a tall, fair-haired people, clothed in shirts and smocks of embroidered linen, and gaiters cross-strapped with hide; their arms and necks encircled with gold and silver rings; the warriors, at least of the upper class, well horsed, and armed with lance and heavy sword, with chain-mail, and helmets surmounted with plumes, horns, towers, dragons, boars, and the other strange devices which are still seen on the crests of German nobles. This much we can guess; for in this way their ancestors, or at least relations, the War-Geats, appear clothed in the grand old song of Beowulf. Their land must have been tilled principally by slaves, usually captives taken in war: but the noble mystery of the forge, where arms and ornaments were made, was an honourable craft for men of rank; and their ladies, as in the middle age, prided themselves on their skill with the <b>needle</b> and the <b>loom.</b> Their language has been happily preserved to us in Ulfilas' Translation of the Scriptures. For these Goths, the greater number of them at least, were by this time Christians, or very nearly such. Good Bishop Ulfilas, brought up a Christian and consecrated by order of Constantine the Great, had been labouring for years to convert his adopted countrymen from the worship of Thor and Woden. He had translated the Bible for them, and had constructed a Gothic alphabet for that purpose. He had omitted, however (prudently as he considered) the books of Kings, with their histories of the Jewish wars. The Goths, he held, were only too fond of fighting already, and 'needed in that matter the bit, rather than the spur.' He had now a large number of converts, some of whom had even endured persecution from their heathen brethren. Athanaric, 'judge,' or alderman of the Thervings, had sent through the camp--so runs the story--the waggon which bore the idol of Woden, and had burnt, with their tents and their families, those who refused to worship.|$|R
6000|$|Over the sea, past Crete, on the Syrian {{shore to}} the southward, Dwells in the well-tilled lowland a dark-haired AEthiop people, Skilful with <b>needle</b> and <b>loom,</b> {{and the arts}} of the dyer and carver, Skilful, but feeble of heart; for they know not the lords of Olympus, Lovers of men; neither broad-browed Zeus, nor Pallas Athene, Teacher of wisdom to heroes, bestower of might in the battle; Share not the cunning of Hermes, nor list to the songs of Apollo. Fearing {{the stars of the}} sky, and the roll of the blue salt water, Fearing all things that have life in the womb of the seas and the livers, Eating no fish to this day, nor {{ploughing}} the main, like the Phoenics, Manful with black-beaked ships, they abide in a sorrowful region, Vexed with the earthquake, and flame, and the sea-floods, scourge of Poseidon. [...] Whelming the dwellings of men, and the toils of the slow-footed oxen, Drowning the barley and flax, and the hard-earned gold of the harvest, Up to the hillside vines, and the pastures skirting the woodland, Inland the floods came yearly; and after the waters a monster, Bred of the slime, like the worms which are bred from the slime of the Nile- bank, Shapeless, a terror to see; and by night it swam out to the seaward, Daily returning to feed with the dawn, and devoured of the fairest, Cattle, and children, and maids, till the terrified people fled inland. [...] Fasting in sackcloth and ashes they came, both the king and his people, Came to the mountain of oaks, to the house of the terrible sea-gods, Hard by the gulf in the rocks, where of old the world-wide deluge Sank to the inner abyss; and the lake where the fish of the goddess, Holy, undying, abide; whom the priests feed daily with dainties. There to the mystical fish, high-throned in her chamber of cedar, Burnt they the fat of the flock; till the flame shone far to the seaward. Three days fasting they prayed; but the fourth day the priests of the goddess, Cunning in spells, cast lots, to discover the crime of the people. All day long they cast, till the house of the monarch was taken, Cepheus, king of the land; and the faces of all gathered blackness. Then once more they cast; and Cassiopoeia was taken, Deep-bosomed wife of the king, whom oft far-seeing Apollo Watched well-pleased from the welkin, the fairest of AEthiop women: Fairest, save only her daughter; for down to the ankle her tresses Rolled, blue-black as the night, ambrosial, joy to beholders. Awful and fair she arose, most like in her coming to Here, Queen before whom the Immortals arise, as she comes on Olympus, Out of the chamber of gold, which her son Hephaestos has wrought her. Such in her stature and eyes, and the broad white light of her forehead. Stately she came from her place, and she spoke {{in the midst of the}} people. [...] 'Pure are my hands from blood: most pure this heart in my bosom. Yet one fault I remember this day; one word have I spoken; Rashly I spoke on the shore, and I dread lest the sea should have heard it. Watching my child at her bath, as she plunged in the joy of her girlhood, Fairer I called her in pride than Atergati, queen of the ocean. Judge ye if this be my sin, for I know none other.' She ended; Wrapping her head in her mantle she stood, and the people were silent. [...] Answered the dark-browed priests, 'No word, once spoken, returneth, Even if uttered unwitting. Shall gods excuse our rashness? That which is done, that abides; and the wrath of the sea is against us; Hers, and the wrath of her brother, the Sun-god, lord of the sheepfolds. Fairer than her hast thou boasted thy daughter? Ah folly! for hateful, Hateful are they to the gods, whoso, impious, liken a mortal, Fair though he be, to their glory; and hateful is that which is likened, Grieving the eyes of their pride, and abominate, doomed to their anger. What shall be likened to gods? The unknown, who deep in the darkness Ever abide, twyformed, many-handed, terrible, shapeless. Woe to the queen; for the land is defiled, and the people accursed. Take thou her therefore by night, thou ill-starred Cassiopoeia, Take her with us in the night, when the moon sinks low to the westward; Bind her aloft for a victim, a prey for the gorge of the monster, Far on the sea-girt rock, which is washed by the surges for ever; So may the goddess accept her, and so may the land make atonement, Purged by her blood from its sin: so obey thou the doom of the rulers.' [...] Bitter in soul they went out, Cepheus and Cassiopoeia, Bitter in soul; and their hearts whirled round, as the leaves in the eddy. Weak was the queen, and rebelled: but the king, like a shepherd of people, Willed not the land should waste; so he yielded the life of his daughter. [...] Deep in the wane of the night, as the moon sank low to the westward, They by the shade of the cliffs, with the horror of darkness around them, Stole, as ashamed, to a deed which became not the light of the sunshine, Slowly, the priests, and the queen, and the virgin bound in the galley, Slowly they rowed to the rocks: but Cepheus far in the palace Sate in the midst of the hall, on his throne, like a shepherd of people, Choking his woe, dry-eyed, while the slaves wailed loudly around him. They on the sea-girt rock, which is washed by the surges for ever, Set her in silence, the guiltless, aloft with her face to the eastward. Under a crag of the stone, where a ledge sloped down to the water; There they set Andromeden, most beautiful, shaped like a goddess, Lifting her long white arms wide-spread to the walls of the basalt, Chaining them, ruthless, with brass; and they called on the might of the Rulers. [...] 'Mystical fish of the seas, dread Queen whom AEthiops honour, Whelming the land in thy wrath, unavoidable, sharp as the sting-ray, Thou, and thy brother the Sun, brain-smiting, lord of the sheepfold, Scorching the earth all day, and then resting at night in thy bosom, Take ye this one life for many, appeased by the blood of a maiden, Fairest, and born of the fairest, a queen, most priceless of victims.' [...] Thrice they spat as they went by the maid: but her mother delaying Fondled her child to the last, heart-crushed; and the warmth of her weeping Fell on the breast of the maid, as her woe broke forth into wailing. [...] 'Daughter! my daughter! forgive me! Oh curse not the murderess! Curse not! How have I sinned, but in love? Do the gods grudge glory to mothers? Loving I bore thee in vain in the fate-cursed bride-bed of Cepheus, Loving I fed thee and tended, and loving rejoiced in thy beauty, Blessing thy limbs as I bathed them, and blessing thy locks as I combed them; Decking thee, ripening to woman, I blest thee: yet blessing I slew thee! How have I sinned, but in love? Oh swear to me, swear to thy mother, Never to haunt me with curse, as I go to the grave in my sorrow, Childless and lone: may the gods never send me another, to slay it! See, I embrace thy knees--soft knees, where no babe will be fondled-- Swear to me never to curse me, the hapless one, not in the death-pang.' [...] Weeping she clung to the knees of the maid; and the maid low answered-- 'Curse thee! Not in the death-pang!' The heart of the lady was lightened. Slowly she went by the ledge; and the maid was alone in the darkness. [...] Watching the pulse of the oars die down, as her own died with them, Tearless, dumb with amaze she stood, as a storm-stunned nestling Fallen from bough or from eave lies dumb, which the home-going herdsman Fancies a stone, till he catches the light of its terrified eyeball. So through the long long hours the maid stood helpless and hopeless, Wide-eyed, downward gazing in vain at the black blank darkness. Feebly at last she began, while wild thoughts bubbled within her-- 'Guiltless I am: why thus, then? Are gods more ruthless than mortals? Have they no mercy for youth? no love for the souls who have loved them? Even as I loved thee, dread sea, as I played by thy margin, Blessing thy wave as it cooled me, thy wind as it breathed on my forehead, Bowing my head to thy tempest, and opening my heart to thy children, Silvery fish, wreathed shell, and the strange lithe things of the water, Tenderly casting them back, as they gasped on the beach in the sunshine, Home to their mother--in vain! for mine sits childless in anguish! O false sea! false sea! I dreamed what I dreamed of thy goodness; Dreamed of a smile in thy gleam, of a laugh in the plash of thy ripple: False and devouring thou art, and the great world dark and despiteful.' [...] Awed by her own rash words she was still: and her eyes to the seaward Looked for an answer of wrath: far off, in the heart of the darkness, Blight white mists rose slowly; beneath them the wandering ocean Glimmered and glowed to the deepest abyss; and the knees of the maiden Trembled and sunk in her fear, as afar, like a dawn in the midnight, Rose from their seaweed chamber the choir of the mystical sea-maids. Onward toward her they came, and her heart beat loud at their coming, Watching the bliss of the gods, as they wakened the cliffs with their laughter. [...] Onward they came in their joy, and before them the roll of the surges Sank, as the breeze sank dead, into smooth green foam-flecked marble, Awed; and the crags of the cliff, and the pines of the mountain were silent. Onward they came in their joy, and around them the lamps of the sea-nymphs, Myriad fiery globes, swam panting and heaving; and rainbows Crimson and azure and emerald, were broken in star-showers, lighting Far through the wine-dark depths of the crystal, the gardens of Nereus, Coral and sea-fan and tangle, the blooms and the palms of the ocean. [...] Onward they came in their joy, more white than the foam which they scattered, Laughing and singing, and tossing and twining, while eager, the Tritons Blinded with kisses their eyes, unreproved, and above them in worship Hovered the terns, and the seagulls swept past them on silvery pinions Echoing softly their laughter; around them the wantoning dolphins Sighed as they plunged, full of love; and the great sea-horses which bore them Curved up their crests in their pride to the delicate arms of the maidens, Pawing the spray into gems, till a fiery rainfall, unharming, Sparkled and gleamed on the limbs of the nymphs, and the coils of the mermen. [...] Onward they went in their joy, bathed round with the fiery coolness, Needing nor sun nor moon, self-lighted, immortal: but others, Pitiful, floated in silence apart; in their bosoms the sea-boys, Slain by the wrath of the seas, swept down by the anger of Nereus; Hapless, whom never again on strand or on quay shall their mothers Welcome with garlands and vows to the temple, but wearily pining Gaze over island and bay for the sails of the sunken; they heedless Sleep in soft bosoms for ever, and dream of the surge and the sea-maids. [...] Onward they passed in their joy; on their brows neither sorrow nor anger; Self-sufficing, as gods, never heeding the woe of the maiden. She would have shrieked for their mercy: but shame made her dumb; and their eyeballs Stared on her careless and still, like the eyes in the house of the idols. Seeing they saw not, and passed, like a dream, on the murmuring ripple. [...] Stunned by the wonder she gazed, wide-eyed, as the glory departed. 'O fair shapes! far fairer than I! Too fair to be ruthless! Gladden mine eyes once more with your splendour, unlike to my fancies; You, then, smiled in the sea-gleam, and laughed in the plash of the ripple. Awful I deemed you and formless; inhuman, monstrous as idols; Lo, when ye came, ye were women, more loving and lovelier, only; Like in all else; and I blest you: why blest ye not me for my worship? Had you no mercy for me, thus guiltless? Ye pitied the sea-boys: Why not me, then, more hapless by far? Does your sight and your knowledge End with the marge of the waves? Is the world which ye dwell in not our world?' ...|$|R
