Carcass measures included: cold carcass weight (CCW), EUROP conformation and fat class scores (MLC-CF), primal joint weights predicted using MLC-CF and several carcass linear and area measures obtained by Video Image Analysis (VIA-DM). Heritability estimates for subjective carcass traits (MLC-CF and primal joint weights predicted using MLC-CF) were low (0. 05 ? 0. 17), whereas those for objective carcass traits (linear and area measurements on the carcass from VIA) were moderate to high (0. 20 ? 0. 53). Phenotypic correlations between MLC-CF and VIA-DM were in general low (0. 01 ? 0. 51) and genetic correlations were slightly higher (? 0. 04 ? 0. 81), when interpreting their absolute value. The results suggest that selection for shorter carcasses (VIA lengths) will be associated with improved conformation but a reduction of the total CCW. Likewise there was a trend in the genetic correlations between conformation and carcass widths which indicated that conformation could also be improved by selection for wider carcasses as measured by VIA which in turn will also imply an increase in CCW. The genetic correlations between VIA-DM and fat class score were only significantly different from zero for the VIA measurement for the leg area (rg = ? 0. 73). Length traits were highly correlated with each other, with an average genetic correlation of 0. 84. Positive genetic correlations (0. 47 ? 0. 85) were found between widths measured on the shoulders and chest with hind leg widths. The areas measured on the carcass were moderately to highly correlated with each other (0. 54 ? 0. 90). In general, genetic correlations which were found to be significant between areas, lengths and widths were moderate to high and positive. Phenotypic and genetic correlations along with heritabilities of the VIA-DM from crossbred lambs, suggest that using this VIA dimensional information in the evaluation of purebred terminal sire breeds is likely to improve conformation on crossbred lambs.

Effects of a {{quantitative}} trait locus for increased muscularity on carcass traits measured by subjective conformation and fat class scores and video image analysis in crossbred lambs.

Crossbred lambs born out of Mule ewes mated to heterozygous Texel sires for the TM-QTL were evaluated {{for a range of}} carcass traits. Lambs were genotyped and classified as carriers (n = 62) of a single copy of the TM-QTL and non-carriers (n = 49). In this study, the effects of the TM-QTL on carcass attributes were investigated using subjective classification scores for conformation and fatness, and measurements from a video image analysis (VIA) system. In addition, refined prediction equations to estimate weights of primal joints (leg, chump, loin, breast and shoulder) were obtained by calibrating the VIA system against computer tomography (CT) measurements in the loin region. The new refined prediction models increased the accuracy of prediction of all primal cuts on an average of 16 % compared to previously derived standard VIA prediction equations. The coefficient of determination (R 2) of the VIA system to predict in vivo CT measurements ranged from 0. 39 to 0. 72 for measurements of Musculus longissimus lumborum (MLL) area, width and depth, lumbar spine length, loin muscle volume and loin muscularity index. Using VIA estimates of CT-measured loin muscle traits, a significant increase in depth (+ 2. 7 %) of the MLL was found {{to be associated with the}} TM-QTL. Conformation and fatness scores and the shape of the carcass measured as individual lengths, widths and areas by VIA were not significantly influenced by the TM-QTL. Primal meat yields estimated using both standard and refined VIA prediction equations were not significantly affected by the TM-QTL. However, carcass ?compactness? was found to have significantly increased in carrier lambs. The weight of the dissected MLL estimated using VIA information was greater (+ 2. 6 %) for carriers compared to non-carriers. To conclude, neither the current industry carcass evaluation system for conformation and fatness nor the standard VIA system is able to identify the effect of the TM-QTL in the loin region in the moment. However, the calibration of the VIA system against CT measurements resulted in improved VIA prediction equations for primal meat yields and also showed moderate potential to estimate loin muscle traits measured by CT and to detect, partially, the effect of the TM-QTL on these traits.

The {{aim of the}} study is to investigate how Belgian consumers perceive "superior" quality and to confront consumer expectations with the producer's motivation to supply "superior" <b>quality</b> <b>meat.</b> In the first phase consumer and producer beliefs, as well as attitude and behaviour towards the <b>quality</b> of fresh <b>meat</b> were established. In the second phase consumer motivation to buy "superior" meat, and the motivation of producers to engage in the production of "superior" <b>quality</b> <b>meat,</b> were investigated. The insights from this exploratory research yield hypotheses about differences and potential conflicts in consumer's and producer's view on "superior" <b>quality</b> <b>meat.</b> The main potential source of conflicts pertains to price expectations. Ultimately, the findings of consumers and producers are to be confronted in order to obtain an integrated vision on "superior" <b>quality</b> <b>meat.</b> © 2005 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This {{literature}} review focuses on meat tenderness and flavor, which {{are most important}} in determining <b>meat</b> <b>quality,</b> but difficultly predictable and maintained. Meat tenderness primarily relates to muscle tissues while meat flavor is mostly resulted from fatty tissues. Many {{studies have indicated that}} not only protein composition of muscle fibers but also handling and slaughtering conditions, genetic traits, and growth progress could affect meat tenderness. Surprisingly, there is somewhat connection between tenderness and flavor through marbling of meat cuts. The more marbling the meat cut has, the more flavorful and tender it is. Some clear understandings of those <b>quality</b> traits of <b>meat</b> are important to improve <b>quality</b> of <b>meat</b> and processed meat products.
