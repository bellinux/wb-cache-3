5|$|In 1054, {{relations}} between the Eastern and Western traditions within the Christian Church reached a terminal crisis, known as the East–West Schism. Although there was a formal declaration of institutional separation, on July 16, when three papal legates entered the Hagia Sophia during Divine Liturgy on a Saturday afternoon and placed a bull of excommunication on the altar, the so-called Great Schism was actually the culmination of centuries of gradual separation. Unfortunately the legates did <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Pope had died, an event that made the excommunication void and the excommunication only applied to the Patriarch who responded by excommunicating the legates.|$|E

5|$|Ney now had two problems: he {{expected}} support columns from Soult's division on both flanks to arrive momentarily {{and he did}} <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Austrians had arrived in force, {{directly in front of}} his center. Although Roget's brigade was strong enough to prevent the Austrians from flanking the position, Gazan's brigade was too weak to resist the superior Austrian force, which was growing visibly stronger as Hotze's troops continued to arrive at the forward line and throw themselves into the fray.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} year, the War of the Quadruple Alliance broke out, aligning Spain against France, England, the Dutch Republic, and Austria. The war {{was fought}} primarily over Italy, but England and France used {{the war as}} an excuse to attempt to take over Spanish interests in North America. In June 1719, 7Frenchmen from Natchitoches took control of Mission San Miguel de los Adaes from its sole defender, who did <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> countries were at war. The French soldiers explained that 100 additional soldiers were coming, and the Spanish colonists, missionaries, and remaining soldiers abandoned the area and fled to San Antonio.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} three months of 1944, Cicero {{supplied}} the Germans with copies of documents taken from his employer's dispatch box or his safe. Photographs of top secret documents were generally handed over in Moyzisch's car, which was parked inconspicuously on an Ankara street. On one occasion, this led to a high-speed chase around Ankara as someone had taken an interest in the hand-over. Bazna, who had perhaps been tailed, escaped. Ultra, the British codebreaking system based at Bletchley Park routinely read German messages, coded by the Enigma machine. From that information, the codebreakers knew that there was an intelligence breach, but did <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> source was the British Embassy in Turkey.|$|E

5|$|The revolt {{intensified}} after Essad's exile. In {{order to}} gain support from the 1,000 Mirdita Catholic paid volunteers from the northern mountains, Prince of Wied appointed their leader, Prênk Bibë Doda, as foreign minister. Isa Boletini and his men, mostly from Kosovo, also joined the International Gendarmerie to fight the rebels. Dutch gendarmes together with the Mirdita attempted to capture Shijak, but when they engaged on May23, they were surrounded and captured, along with another expedition from Durrës which attempted to release the captured gendarmes. Captain Sar did <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> northern Catholic tribes refused to fight the rebels because General Besa was agreed when the Prince of Wied took over the throne. Rebels attacked Durrës, firing on it with light weapons. The people in Durrës panicked, and the Prince took his family to shelter in an Italian ship anchored in the bay.|$|E
5|$|The German Navy {{had decided}} on a {{strategy}} of bombarding British towns on the North Sea coast {{in an attempt to}} draw out the Royal Navy and destroy elements of it in detail. An earlier Raid on Yarmouth on 3 November 1914 had been partially successful, but a larger-scale operation was devised by Admiral Franz von Hipper afterwards. The fast battlecruisers would conduct the bombardment while the entire High Seas Fleet was to station itself east of Dogger Bank to provide cover for their return and to destroy any elements of the Royal Navy that responded to the raid. The Germans did <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> British were reading the German naval codes and were planning to catch the raiding force on its return journey; they were not aware that the High Seas Fleet would be at sea as well. Admiral Beatty's 1st BCS, now reduced to four ships, including Lion, as well as the 2nd Battle Squadron with six dreadnoughts, was detached from the Grand Fleet in an attempt to intercept the Germans near Dogger Bank.|$|E
5|$|The {{demoralized}} Austrian army {{arrived at}} Ulm {{in the early}} hours of 10 October. Mack was deliberating his course of action and the Austrian army remained inactive at Ulm until the 11th. Meanwhile, Napoleon was operating under flawed assumptions: he believed the Austrians were moving to the east or southeast and that Ulm was lightly guarded. Ney sensed this misapprehension and wrote to Berthier that Ulm was, in fact, more heavily defended than the French originally thought. During this time, the Russian threat to the east began to preoccupy Napoleon so much that Murat was given command of the right wing of the army, consisting of Ney's and Lannes's corps. The French were separated in two massive wings at this point: the forces of Ney, Lannes, and Murat to the west were containing Mack while those of Soult, Davout, Bernadotte, and Auguste Marmont to the east were charged with guarding against any possible Russian and Austrian incursions. On 11 October Ney made a renewed push on Ulm; the 2nd and 3rd divisions were to march to the city along the right bank of the Danube while Dupont's division, supported by one dragoon division, was to march directly for Ulm and seize the entire city. The orders were hopeless because Ney still did <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> entire Austrian army was stationed at Ulm.|$|E

50|$|The {{film was}} shot in 1978 and {{released}} in 1980. An old Greek ocean liner, SS Athinai, was converted into {{a replica of the}} Titanic. A scale model was used for close-up underwater scenes. At the time of filming it was <b>not</b> <b>known</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Titanic broke in half as she foundered. Therefore the ship appears intact in the film. The wreck of the real Titanic was found in 1985.|$|R
5|$|The {{division}} was allotted three specific tasks to achieve {{as a part}} of Tonga, apart from protecting the eastern flank of the Allied seaborne landings and taking control of the areas of strategic importance to the east of Caen. First, it was to capture intact the two bridges over the Caen Canal and the Orne River at Bénouville and Ranville. The bridges then would be defended against counterattacks. Gale knew that the capture of the bridges would be critical for the resupply and reinforcement of his division, but he did <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> bridges were incapable of supporting tanks. Second, the {{division was}} to destroy the heavily fortified Merville coastal artillery battery located at Franceville Plage, to ensure that it could not shell the British forces landing in the area codenamed Sword. The third mission was to destroy several bridges which spanned the River Dives, located near the towns of Varaville, Robehomme, Bures and Troarn. The division would then hold the territory that it had seized, until it could be relieved by advancing British ground forces.|$|E
25|$|In 2015, McDonnell's name {{appeared}} on a letter calling for the armed police and MI5 to be disbanded.

25|$|But, second, {{not only}} can we <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{objective}} world is nonmentalistic, we also cannot intelligibly suppose {{that it could be}} material. To conceive of a dualism entails attributing material properties to the objective world. However, this presupposes that we could observe that the objective world has material properties. But this is absurd, for whatever is observed must ultimately be the content of our own consciousness, and consequently, nonmaterial.|$|E

They still had 26,000 troops occupying New York City, Charleston, and Savannah, {{together with a}} powerful fleet. The French army and navy departed, so the Americans were on their own in 1782–83. The treasury was empty, and the unpaid soldiers were growing restive, {{almost to the point}} of mutiny or possible coup d'état. The unrest among officers of the Newburgh Conspiracy was personally dispelled by Washington in 1783, and Congress subsequently created the promise of a five years bonus for all officers.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of the detective's statements, Sabrina was branded by her family as a liar. Her uncle {{continued}} to rape her repeatedly, saying he would kill her if she told anyone. She became pregnant by him, and had an abortion. The family did <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> rape kit had been tested at the state lab and showed the presence of semen. The lab requested that the detective obtain a blood sample from the suspect, Patrick Morrison. Instead of obtaining the blood sample, or making an arrest, the detective filed the crime-lab note and closed the case for four years.|$|E

25|$|Originally {{believed}} {{to be one of}} the subconscious identities developed by Carol Ferris, which acted as a masculine animus to the feminine anima of Star Sapphire, the Predator repeatedly appeared as a mysterious figure, protecting Carol's beloved company from the threats of Eclipso, the Demolition Team, and Jason Bloch. He also established the company Intercontinental Petroleum (Con-Trol) to let her regain control of Ferris Aircraft. Finally, the Predator started to court Carol (who did <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Predator was a part of herself) and battled Hal Jordan for her love. The Predator was later assumed to have been killed by Nekron.|$|E
25|$|Early on 25 July, the British Lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada, Lieutenant General Gordon Drummond, {{arrived in}} Fort George to take {{personal}} command on the Niagara peninsula. He immediately ordered a force under Lieutenant Colonel John Tucker to advance south from Fort Niagara (which the British had captured in December 1813) {{along the east}} side of the Niagara River, hoping this would force Brown to evacuate the west bank. Instead, Brown ordered an advance north, intending in turn to force the British to recall Tucker's column to protect Fort George.

25|$|In Darwin's {{theory of}} natural selection, more organisms are {{produced}} than can survive. Some have variations that {{give them a}} competitive advantage, {{and they have the}} best chance of surviving and procreating. The main element lacking in the theory was any mechanism that would allow organisms to pass on these favorable variations. Lacking such a mechanism, the theory of evolution faced competition from theories such as neo-Lamarckism, in which the environment acted directly on organisms, changing their structures. Darwin did <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> monk Gregor Mendel was already working on experiments that would explain inheritance in terms of units of heredity that we now call genes.|$|E
