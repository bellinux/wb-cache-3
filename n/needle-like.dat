5|$|In 2008, {{researchers}} {{studying the}} presence or absence of a dorsal stripe suggested that it has independently evolved several times in Timema species and is an adaptation for crypsis on <b>needle-like</b> leaves. All of the eight Timema species with a dorsal stripe have at least one host plant with <b>needle-like</b> foliage. Of the thirteen unstriped species, seven feed only on broadleaf plants. Four (T. ritensis, T. podura, T. genevieve, and T. coffmani) rest during the day on the host plant's trunk rather than its leaves and have bodies that are brown, gray, or tan. Only two species (T. nakipa and T. boharti) have green unstriped morphs that feed on <b>needle-like</b> foliage; both are generalist feeders that also feed on broadleaf hosts.|$|E
5|$|Love darts, {{also known}} as {{shooting}} darts, or just as darts, are shaped in many distinctive ways which vary considerably between species. What all the shapes of love darts {{have in common is}} their harpoon-like or <b>needle-like</b> ability to pierce.|$|E
5|$|Banksia grossa is {{cultivated}} for its attractive <b>needle-like</b> {{leaves and}} rusty-brown flower spikes, {{both of which}} can be quite variable in colour. This species favours well-drained sandy or loamy acidic soils with a pH of 5.5 to 7, and a sunny aspect. Once established, it tolerates dry spells. It can be pruned heavily as it resprouts from its lignotuber.|$|E
5|$|Leaf {{morphology}} is {{also very}} diverse in this large genus. Some leaves are very thin, almost <b>needle-like</b> (S. affine), while others are short, stubby, and arranged in rosettes (S. pulviniforme). Another group of species, such as S. scandens (climbing triggerplant) form scrambling, tangled mats typically propped up on aerial roots.|$|E
5|$|The Murray cod {{is a large}} grouper-like {{fish with}} a deep, {{elongated}} body that is round in cross section. It has a broad, scooped head, and a large mouth lined with pads of very small, <b>needle-like</b> teeth. The jaws of the Murray cod are equal, or the lower jaw protrudes slightly.|$|E
5|$|Aphids: There {{are five}} species of aphids {{commonly}} found on apples: apple grain aphid, rosy apple aphid, apple aphid, spirea aphid and the woolly apple aphid. The aphid species {{can be identified}} by their color, {{the time of year}} when they are present and by differences in the cornicles, which are small paired projections from the rear of aphids. Aphids feed on foliage using <b>needle-like</b> mouth parts to suck out plant juices. When present in high numbers, certain species reduce tree growth and vigor.|$|E
5|$|Exposure {{to light}} is {{detrimental}} to the stability of aqueous solutions of psilocybin, and will cause it to rapidly oxidize—an important consideration when using it as an analytical standard. Osamu Shirota and colleagues reported a method for the large-scale synthesis of psilocybin without chromatographic purification in 2003. Starting with 4-hydroxyindole, they generated psilocybin from psilocin in 85% yield, a marked improvement over yields reported from previous syntheses. Purified psilocybin is a white, <b>needle-like</b> crystalline powder with a melting point between , and a slightly ammonia-like taste.|$|E
5|$|Most crickets {{lay their}} eggs in the soil or inside the stems of plants, and to do this, female crickets have a long, <b>needle-like</b> or sabre-like {{egg-laying}} organ called an ovipositor. Some ground-dwelling species have dispensed with this, either depositing their eggs in an underground chamber or pushing them into {{the wall of a}} burrow. The short-tailed cricket (Anurogryllus) excavates a burrow with chambers and a defecating area, lays its eggs in a pile on a chamber floor, and after the eggs have hatched, feeds the juveniles for about a month.|$|E
5|$|Most {{pterosaur}} skulls had elongated jaws with a {{full complement}} of <b>needle-like</b> teeth. In some cases, fossilized keratinous beak tissue has been preserved, though in toothed forms, the beak is small and restricted to the jaw tips and does not involve the teeth. Some advanced beaked forms were toothless, such as the pteranodonts and azhdarchids, and had larger, more extensive, and more bird-like beaks.|$|E
5|$|Shulaprota (pierced by sharp pointed spear/dart): Some {{people give}} shelter to birds or animals {{pretending to be}} their saviours, but then harass them poking with threads, needles or using them like lifeless toys. Also, some people behave the same way to humans, winning their {{confidence}} and then killing them with sharp tridents or lances. The bodies of such sinners, fatigued with hunger and thirst, are pierced with sharp, <b>needle-like</b> spears. Ferocious carnivorous birds like vultures and herons tear and gorge their flesh.|$|E
5|$|Tooth shape {{depends on}} the shark's diet: those that feed on mollusks and {{crustaceans}} have dense and flattened teeth used for crushing, those that feed on fish have <b>needle-like</b> teeth for gripping, and those that feed on larger prey such as mammals have pointed lower teeth for gripping and triangular upper teeth with serrated edges for cutting. The teeth of plankton-feeders such as the basking shark are small and non-functional.|$|E
5|$|A spine is a sharp, <b>needle-like</b> {{structure}} used {{to inflict}} pain on predators. An {{example of this}} seen in nature is in the Sohal surgeonfish. These fish have a sharp scalpel-like spine {{on the front of}} each of their tail fins, able to inflict deep wounds. The area around the spines is often brightly colored to advertise the defensive capability; predators often avoid the Sohal surgeonfish. Defensive spines may be detachable, barbed or poisonous. Porcupine spines are long, stiff, break at the tip, and are barbed to stick into a would-be predator. In contrast, the hedgehog's short spines, which are modified hairs, readily bend, and are barbed into the body, so they are not easily lost; they may be jabbed at an attacker.|$|E
5|$|Crocodilian teeth {{vary from}} blunt and dull to sharp and <b>needle-like.</b> Broad-snouted species have teeth that vary in size, while those of slender-snouted species are more uniform. The teeth of {{crocodiles}} and gharials {{tend to be}} more visible than those of alligators and caimans when the jaws are closed. The easiest way to distinguish crocodiles from alligators is by looking at their jaw line. The teeth on the lower jaw of an alligator fit into sockets in the upper jaw, so only the upper teeth are visible when the mouth is closed. The teeth on the lower jaw of a crocodile fit into grooves {{on the outside of the}} top jaw making both the upper and lower teeth visible when the mouth is closed.|$|E
5|$|Seldom observed, the {{frilled shark}} may capture prey by bending its body and lunging forward like a snake. The long, {{extremely}} flexible jaws {{enable it to}} swallow prey whole, while its many rows of small, <b>needle-like</b> teeth {{make it difficult for}} the prey to escape. It feeds mainly on cephalopods, leavened by bony fishes and other sharks. This species is aplacental viviparous: the embryos emerge from their egg capsules inside the mother's uterus, where they survive primarily on yolk. The gestation period may be as long as three and a half years, the longest of any vertebrate. Litter sizes vary from two to fifteen, and there is no distinct breeding season. Frilled sharks are occasional bycatch in commercial fisheries, but have little economic value.|$|E
5|$|The {{body of the}} finetooth shark is {{slender and}} streamlined. The snout is long and pointed, with the nares preceded by short, broadly {{triangular}} flaps of skin. The eyes are large and round, with nictitating membranes (protective third eyelids). The mouth is broad with well-defined furrows at the corners. Twelve to 15 tooth rows occur {{on either side of}} the upper jaw and 1314 tooth rows {{on either side of the}} lower jaw. Each tooth is small and <b>needle-like,</b> with a narrow central cusp and smooth to minutely serrated edges. The five pairs of gill slits are long, measuring about half the length of the dorsal fin base.|$|E
5|$|The finetooth shark (Carcharhinus isodon) is {{a species}} of requiem shark, in the family Carcharhinidae, found in the western Atlantic Ocean, from North Carolina to Brazil. It forms large schools in shallow, coastal waters, and migrates {{seasonally}} following warm water. A relatively small, slender-bodied shark, the finetooth shark can be identified by its <b>needle-like</b> teeth, dark blue-gray dorsal coloration, and long gill slits. It attains a maximum length of 1.9m (6.2ft). The diet of this species consists primarily of small bony fishes, in particular menhaden. Like other members of its family, it is viviparous with females giving birth to two to six pups in estuarine nursery areas every other year.|$|E
5|$|The species Timema cristinae {{exhibits}} both striped and unstriped populations {{depending on}} the host plant, a form of polymorphism that clearly illustrates the camouflage function of the stripe. The earliest ancestors of this species were generalists that fed on plants belonging to both the genera Adenostoma and Ceanothus. They eventually diverged into two distinct ecotypes with a more specialist host plant preference. One ecotype prefers to feed on Adenostoma while the other ecotype prefers to feed on Ceanothus. The Adenostoma ecotype possesses a white dorsal stripe, an adaptation {{to blend in with}} the <b>needle-like</b> leaves of the plant, while the Ceanothus ecotype does not (Ceanothus spp. have broad leaves). The Adenostoma ecotype is also smaller, with a wider head, and shorter legs.|$|E
5|$|The spines of cacti {{are often}} useful in identification, since they vary greatly between species in number, color, size, shape and hardness, {{as well as}} in whether all the spines {{produced}} by an areole are similar or whether they are of distinct kinds. Most spines are straight or at most slightly curved, and are described as hair-like, bristle-like, <b>needle-like</b> or awl-like, depending on their length and thickness. Some cacti have flattened spines (e.g. Schlerocactus papyracanthus). Other cacti have hooked spines. Sometimes, one or more central spines are hooked, while outer spines are straight (e.g., Mammillaria rekoi).|$|E
5|$|Individual archaea {{range from}} 0.1micrometers (μm) to over 15μm in diameter, and occur in various shapes, {{commonly}} as spheres, rods, spirals or plates. Other morphologies in the Crenarchaeota include irregularly shaped lobed cells in Sulfolobus, <b>needle-like</b> filaments {{that are less}} than half a micrometer in diameter in Thermofilum, and almost perfectly rectangular rods in Thermoproteus and Pyrobaculum. Archaea in the genus Haloquadratum such as Haloquadratum walsbyi are flat, square archaea that live in hypersaline pools. These unusual shapes are probably maintained both by their cell walls and a prokaryotic cytoskeleton. Proteins related to the cytoskeleton components of other organisms exist in archaea, and filaments form within their cells, but in contrast to other organisms, these cellular structures are poorly understood. In Thermoplasma and Ferroplasma the lack of a cell wall means that the cells have irregular shapes, and can resemble amoebae.|$|E
5|$|Many {{patterns}} in nature are formed by cracks in sheets of materials. These patterns {{can be described}} by Gilbert tessellations, also known as random crack networks. The Gilbert tessellation is a mathematical model {{for the formation of}} mudcracks, <b>needle-like</b> crystals, and similar structures. The model, named after Edgar Gilbert, allows cracks to form starting from randomly scattered over the plane; each crack propagates in two opposite directions along a line through the initiation point, its slope chosen at random, creating a tessellation of irregular convex polygons. Basaltic lava flows often display columnar jointing as a result of contraction forces causing cracks as the lava cools. The extensive crack networks that develop often produce hexagonal columns of lava. One example of such an array of columns is the Giant's Causeway in Northern Ireland. Tessellated pavement, a characteristic example of which is found at Eaglehawk Neck on the Tasman Peninsula of Tasmania, is a rare sedimentary rock formation where the rock has fractured into rectangular blocks.|$|E
5|$|Mycena adscendens {{produces}} a white spore print. The spores are broadly , amyloid, and have dimensions of 8–10 by 5–6.5µm. Basidia (spore-bearing cells) are two-spored, club-shaped, and measure 14–17 by 7–9µm. Pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill faces) {{may be present}} or absent. If present, they {{are similar to the}} cheilocystidia (cystidia on the gill edges). The cheilocystidia are abundant, measuring 28–44 by 8–12µm. They are variable in shape, often fusoid-ventricose (fuse-shaped with a swollen center) or with 2–3 <b>needle-like</b> projections arising from the apex; the projections are sometimes forked. The swollen parts of the cheilocystidia are covered with short rodlike protuberances or warts. The flesh of the gills is vinaceous-brown when stained in iodine. The flesh of the cap is made up of greatly enlarged cells, with the surface covered with club-shaped to almost globular cells measuring 25–40 by about 20µm. Their walls are finely verrucose (covered with small warts), and all but the verrucose cells are -brown in iodine. Clamp connections are abundant in the hyphae.|$|E
25|$|Amphibole class fibers are <b>needle-like.</b> Amosite, crocidolite, tremolite, {{anthophyllite}} and actinolite {{are members}} of the amphibole class.|$|E
25|$|Rosmarinus officinalis, {{commonly}} known as rosemary, is a woody, perennial herb with fragrant, evergreen, <b>needle-like</b> leaves and white, pink, purple, or blue flowers, native to the Mediterranean region.|$|E
25|$|Another {{complexity}} {{not entirely}} documented {{is how the}} shape of PM can affect health, except for the <b>needle-like</b> shape of asbestos which can lodge itself in the lungs. Geometrically angular shapes have more surface area than rounder shapes, which in turn affects the binding capacity of the particle to other, possibly more dangerous substances.|$|E
25|$|The {{centre of}} the street is {{dominated}} by the imposing presence of the 1818 General Post Office (GPO) with its hexastyle Ionic portico projecting over the west pavement, and the 120m (393ft) Spire of Dublin, a <b>needle-like</b> self-supporting sculpture of rolled stainless steel erected in 2003. Both structures are addressed by a large civic plaza space, traversed by the street's two roadways.|$|E
25|$|Radiofrequency {{ablation}} is a {{minimally invasive}} treatments for fibroids. In this technique the fibroid is shrunk by inserting a <b>needle-like</b> device into the fibroid through the abdomen and heating it with radio-frequency (RF) electrical energy to cause necrosis of cells. The treatment {{is a potential}} option for women who have fibroids, have completed child-bearing and want to avoid a hysterectomy.|$|E
25|$|Japanese green teas have a thin, <b>needle-like</b> {{shape and}} a rich, dark green color. Unlike Chinese teas, most Japanese teas are {{produced}} by steaming rather than pan firing. This produces their characteristic color, and creates a sweeter, more grassy flavor. A mechanical rolling/drying process then dries the tea leaves into their final shape. The liquor of steamed Japanese tea tends to be cloudy due to the higher quantity of dissolved solids.|$|E
25|$|The /Phanerostomata {{were defined}} as those taxa in which the leaf stomata occur superficially or in shallow pits. These taxa are {{typically}} tall shrubs and trees that occur in moist areas; they have unbeaked follicles and soft, short-lived leaves that are in many cases <b>needle-like.</b> The clade includes all eastern taxa of the series Salicinae and Spicigerae (that is, all taxa except B.serrata, B.aemula and B.ornata) and also the western Spicigerae, Quercinae, Grandes, Abietinae and Dryandroideae.|$|E
25|$|Field ion {{microscopy}} is {{a modification}} of field emission microscopy where a stream of tunneling electrons is emitted from the apex of a sharp <b>needle-like</b> tip cathode when subjected to a sufficiently high electric field (~3-6V/nm). The needle is oriented towards a phosphor screen to create a projected image of the work function at the tip apex. The image resolution is limited to (2-2.5nm), due to quantum mechanical effects and lateral variations in the electron velocity.|$|E
25|$|Like {{all known}} {{members of the}} family Synanceiidae, all members of the genus Inimicus possess a complex and {{extremely}} potent venom. It is stored in glands at the bases of <b>needle-like</b> spines in their dorsal fins. Upon contact with the dorsal fin, the fish can deliver a very painful, potentially fatal, sting. The venom consists of a mixture of proteolytic enzymes, including stonustoxin (a hemotoxin), trachynilysin (a neurotoxin), and cardioleputin (a cardiotoxin). Envenomation results severe and immediate local pain, sometimes followed by shock, paralysis, tissue necrosis, and even death.|$|E
25|$|The {{southern}} African {{frilled shark}} (Chlamydoselachus africana) is {{a species of}} shark in the family Chlamydoselachidae, described in 2009. It {{is found in the}} deep waters off southern Angola to southern Namibia. This species is difficult to distinguish from the better-known frilled shark (C. anguineus), but is smaller at maturity and differs in several proportional measurements including head length and mouth width. It seems to be a specialized predator of smaller sharks, using its flexible jaws and numerous <b>needle-like,</b> recurved teeth to capture and swallow them whole. Reproduction is presumably ovoviviparous, as with the other member of its family.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} {{symptoms}} of primidone overdose are coma with loss of deep tendon reflexes and, during the recovery period, {{if the patient}} survives, disorientation, dysarthria, nystagmus, and ataxia, lethargy, somnolence, vomiting, nausea, and occasionally, focal neurological deficits which lessen over time. Complete recovery comes within five to seven days of ingestion. The symptoms of primidone poisoning have generally been attributed to its biotransformation to phenobarbital; however, primidone has toxic effects independent of its metabolites in humans. The massive crystalluria that sometimes occurs sets its symptom profile apart from that of phenobarbital. The crystals are white, <b>needle-like,</b> shimmering, hexagonal plates consisting mainly of primidone.|$|E
25|$|The {{quality of}} a ruby is {{determined}} by its color, cut, and clarity, which, along with carat weight, affect its value. The brightest and most valuable shade of red called blood-red or pigeon blood, commands a large premium over other rubies of similar quality. After color follows clarity: similar to diamonds, a clear stone will command a premium, but a ruby without any <b>needle-like</b> rutile inclusions may indicate that the stone has been treated. Ruby is the traditional birthstone for July and is usually more pink than garnet, although some rhodolite garnets have a similar pinkish hue to most rubies. The world's most expensive ruby is the Sunrise Ruby.|$|E
25|$|Based on {{the width}} and {{structure}} of each segment, they {{can be divided into}} the broad preabdomen (segments 1 to 7) and the narrow postabdomen (segments 8 to 12). The preabdomen is the broader segments of the anterior portion of the ophisthosoma while the postabdomen are the last five segments of the Eurypterus body. Each of the segments of the postabdomen contain lateral flattened protrusions known as the epimera {{with the exception of the}} last <b>needle-like</b> (styliform) segment known as the telson (the 'tail'). The segment immediately preceding the telson (which also has the largest epimera of the postabdomen) is known as the pretelson.|$|E
25|$|The foliage is a dull dark {{to light}} green color, with scale-like leaves 1-1.5mm long, with the leaf tips not spreading; {{seedlings}} bear <b>needle-like</b> leaves 8–10mm long. The cones are small, 11–24mm long, and almost spherical, with {{six or eight}} scales arranged in opposite decussate pairs, with the bract visible as {{no more than a}} small lump or short spine on the scale. The seeds are 3–5mm long, with a pair of small wings along the sides. The cones remain closed on the trees for many years, until the trees are killed by a forest fire; after the tree is dead, the cones open to release the seeds which can then germinate successfully on the bare fire-cleared ground.|$|E
25|$|Creatinine {{was first}} {{synthesized}} in vitro by Ivan Horbaczewski in 1885. One year later, Jaffe's research {{was published in}} the paper Über den Niederschlag, welchen Pikrinsäre in normalem Harn erzeugt und über eine neue Reaction des Kreatinins. Jaffe had noticed that, when mixed in a sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution, picric acid and creatinine formed a reddish-orange color and <b>needle-like</b> crystal precipitate. By using zinc chloride in a process known as the Neubauer reaction, and then performing the Weyl's test, a colorimetric reaction using sodium nitroprusside (SNP), he determined that the precipitated compound was a double salt of the solution. Although he found the amount of precipitate directly proportional to the creatinine concentration, he also noted that the reaction was highly nonspecific and could be observed with many other organic compounds.|$|E
