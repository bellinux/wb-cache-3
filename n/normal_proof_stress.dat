In this study, the tensile properties of 7475 aluminum alloys having various average grain sizes were evaluated. The 0. 2 % <b>proof</b> <b>stress</b> and elongation were discussed based on the theory of dislocation mechanism and the observation of microstructures.

40|$|Magnesium and its alloys exhibit {{not only}} elastic and plastic {{behaviour}} but also anelastic behaviour upon loading. The presence of anelastic strain poses {{a challenge to}} the measurement of <b>proof</b> <b>stress</b> using conventional methods. As such, the <b>proof</b> <b>stress</b> measurement methods specified by American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) and International Standards Organization (ISO) are reviewed and applied to three common die-cast magnesium alloys including AE 44, AM 60 and AZ 91. The methods in the standards give inconsistent results due largely to the inherent anelastic behaviour of these alloys.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Influences {{of thermal}} cycling (100 cycles between 200 and 300 C) and {{isothermal}} exposure (80 h at 300 C) on tensile strength, micro Vickers hardness and fracture mechanism of T 6 -SiCp/Al 6061 composites (SiCp/Al) and base metal of T 6 -Al 6061 alloy(AA 6061) were studied under {{the condition of}} the same hardness of the base metal for isothermal exposure and thermal cycling. Both thermal cycling and isothermal exposure reduced 0. 2 % <b>proof</b> <b>stress,</b> tensile strength and micro Vickers hardness to one third through a half of those of the original SiCp/Al 6061 composites and mainly due to the softening of the matrix. In addition, the thermal cycling caused interfacial debonding between coarse particles and matrix in the SiCp/Al, which was confirmed from the observation of fracture morphology. The reduction in 0. 2 % <b>proof</b> <b>stress</b> and tensile strength increased with increasing SiC particle volume fraction. It was shown empirically that 0. 2 % <b>proof</b> <b>stress</b> and tensile strength of thermally degraded composites can be described as a linear function of hardness, which provides a useful tool for further study since 0. 2 % <b>proof</b> <b>stress</b> and ultimate tensile strength can be inferred by this relation without tensile test.

40|$|A resume {{is given}} of an {{investigation}} of the influence of plastic deformation and of annealing temperature on the tensile and shear elastic properties of high strength nonferrous metals and stainless steels in the form of rods and tubes. The data were obtained from earlier technical reports and notes, and from unpublished work in this investigation. There are also included data obtained from published and unpublished work performed on an independent investigation. The rod materials, namely, nickel, monel, inconel, copper, 13 : 2 Cr-Ni steel, and 18 : 8 Cr-Ni steel, were tested in tension; 18 : 8 Cr-Ni steel tubes were tested in shear, and nickel, monel, aluminum-monel, and Inconel tubes were tested in both tension and shear. There are first described experiments on the relationship between hysteresis and creep, as obtained with repeated cyclic stressing of annealed stainless steel specimens over a constant load range. These tests, which preceded the measurements of elastic properties, assisted in devising the loading time schedule used in such measurements. From corrected stress-set curves are derived the five <b>proof</b> <b>stresses</b> used as indices of elastic or yield strength. From corrected stress-strain curves are derived the secant modulus and its variation with stress. The relationship between the forms of the stress-set and stress-strain curves and the values of the properties derived is discussed. Curves of variation of <b>proof</b> <b>stress</b> and modulus with prior extension, as obtained with single rod specimens, consist in wavelike basic curves with superposed oscillations due to differences of rest interval and extension spacing; the effects of these differences are studied. Oscillations of <b>proof</b> <b>stress</b> and modulus are generally opposite in manner. The use of a series of tubular specimens corresponding to different amounts of prior extension of cold reduction gave curves almost devoid of oscillation since the effects of variation of rest interval and extension spacing were removed. Comparison is also obtained between the variation of the several properties, as measured in tension and in shear. The rise of <b>proof</b> <b>stress</b> with extension is studied, and the work-hardening rates of the various metals evaluated. The ratio between the tensile and shear <b>proof</b> <b>stresses</b> for the various annealed and cold-worked tubular metals is likewise calculated. The influence of annealing or tempering temperature on the <b>proof</b> <b>stresses</b> and moduli for the cold-worked metals and for air-hardened 13 : 2 Cr-Ni steel is investigated. An improvement of elastic strength generally is obtained, without important loss of yield strength, by annealing at suitable temperature. The variation of the <b>proof</b> <b>stress</b> and modulus of elasticity with plastic deformation or annealing temperature is explained in terms of the relative dominance of three important factors: namely, (a) internal stress, (b) lattice-expansion or work-hardening, and (c) crystal reorientation. Effective values of Poisson's ratio were computed from tensile and shear moduli obtained on tubular specimens. The variation of Poisson's ratio with plastic deformation and annealing temperature is explained in terms of the degree of anisotropy produced by changes of (a) internal stress and (b) crystal orientation...|$|R
