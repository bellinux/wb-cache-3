50|$|To avoid {{ambiguity}} {{in how to}} translate returned packets, further modifications to the packets are required. The vast bulk of Internet traffic is Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) or User Datagram Protocol (UDP) packets.

RFC 2663 uses the term <b>network</b> <b>address</b> and port <b>translation</b> (NAPT) for this type of NAT.

40|$|Monitoring network {{security}} of a university {{is one of the}} most important jobs for the network managers. Without the monitoring, it is hard to keep the network safe. It is common that the security policy of a university has the term which states that monitoring {{network security}} is a mandate. However it is very hard to monitor every part of a university's network by the limited number of staff and a limited amount of time and expense. In order to cope with these problems, we bought a commercial network security monitoring service for the doorway of our campus network and we are doing Do It Yourself (DIY) monitoring with free software for the inside of the network. By the commercial monitoring service, we could reach 24 hours a day and 365 days a year monitoring at the doorway. By the DIY monitoring, we could realize the precise monitoring of inside network, which is hard to realize by the commercial monitoring, because there are <b>Network</b> <b>Address</b> <b>Translations</b> (NATs). If an incident was found by the combination of these monitoring, we could deal with it as fast as we can.

40|$|Selecting one or {{multiple}} peers to relay voice calls {{is a critical}} component of large-scale peer-to-peer (P 2 P) voice-over-IP (VoIP) systems, such as Skype. The challenge is to determine good relay paths for a given voice call in a practical manner. We study different VoIP relay path selection schemes which are usually instantiated during the call session initiation and refreshed periodically. This not only allows end hosts behind <b>Network</b> <b>Address</b> <b>Translations</b> (NATs) or firewalls to establish voice calls but also allows communication in periods of poor performance to be switched to alternate relay paths quickly. We propose an enhanced version of existing algorithms for selecting VoIP relay paths and demonstrate that it improves voice quality. Then, we provide a series of simulations and analytical discussions on the correspondences of relay path performance to overlay network scenarios. We show that there are more opportunities for P 2 P VoIP systems to obtain good relay paths when selecting relay nodes located at highly connected Transit domains. For better relay path performance, we recommend to select relay nodes whose distances are less than four hops from the source. We also show that, in general, increasing relay node density can reduce relay path length but generate more hop overlaps to the default path due to the breadth first search manner in existing algorithms. Finally, we fully address the problem of selecting VoIP relay path by taking a new approach, including the development of overall formulation, a new network model to effectively identify the optimal solution space, and a new heuristic algorithm for selecting VoIP relay paths...|$|R

Windows Vista provides a GUI for configuration of both IPv4 and IPv6 properties. IPv6 is now supported by all networking components and services. The Windows Vista DNS client can use IPv6 transport. Internet Explorer in Windows Vista and other applications that use WinINet (Windows Mail, file sharing) support literal IPv6 addresses (...) [...] Windows Firewall and the IPsec Policies snap-in support IPv6 addresses as permissible character strings. In IPv6 mode, Windows Vista can use the Link Local Multicast Name Resolution (LLMNR) protocol, as described in , to resolve names of local hosts on a network which {{does not have a}} DNS server running. This service is useful for networks without a central managing server, and for ad hoc wireless networks. IPv6 can also be used over PPP-based dial-up and PPPoE connections. Windows Vista can also act as a client/server for file sharing or DCOM over IPv6. Support for DHCPv6, which can be used with IPv6, is also included. IPv6 can even be used when full native IPv6 connectivity is not available, using Teredo tunneling; this can even traverse most IPv4 symmetric <b>Network</b> <b>Address</b> <b>Translations</b> (NATs) as well.

40|$|Abstract — The {{current network}} is {{evolving}} gradually from IPv 4 to IPv 6 network {{in order to}} acquire sufficient IP addresses and guarantee the QoS. However, the current mobile IP protocol is supported only when the MN moves within networks of the same IP version because the mobile IPv 4 protocol is not compati-ble with mobile IPv 6 protocol. Therefore, we propose an efficient method for the mobility support in mixed IPv 4 /IPv 6 networks by introducing a Mobile IP-Application Level Gateway (MIP-ALG) into the <b>Network</b> <b>Address</b> Translation-Protocol <b>Translation</b> (NAT-PT). This MIP-ALG compatibly translates MIPv 4 messages to MIPv 6 messages and vice versa. In addition, the proposed scheme minimizes the triangular routing problem of MIPv 4 by inserting the binding function into the NAT-PT. Thus, the proposed mobility management scheme shows good delay performances compared with the conventional MIPv 4 and MIPv 6 operations. I...|$|R
