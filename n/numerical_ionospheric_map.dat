40|$|This thesis {{presents}} research {{pertaining to}} the development of an African <b>Ionospheric</b> <b>Map</b> (AIM). An <b>ionospheric</b> <b>map</b> is a computer program that is able to display spatial and temporal representations of ionospheric parameters such as, electron density and critical plasma frequencies, for every geographical location on the map. The purpose of this development was to make the most optimum use of all available data sources, namely ionosondes, satellites and models, and to implement error minimisation techniques in order to obtain the best result at any given location on the African continent. The focus was placed on the accurate estimation of three upper atmosphere parameters which are important for radio communications: critical frequency of the F 2 layer (foF 2), Total Electron Content (TEC) and the maximum usable frequency over a distance of 3000 km (M 3000 F 2). The results show that AIM provided a more accurate estimation of the three parameters than the internationally recognised and recommended ionosphere model (IRI- 2012) when used on its own. Therefore, the AIM is a more accurate solution than single independent data sources for applications requiring <b>ionospheric</b> <b>mapping</b> over the African continent...|$|R

40|$|In SAR applications, the {{ionosphere}} {{is normally}} {{considered as a}} disturbance {{that has to be}} removed or compensated for. In this paper the ionosphere is the objective of observation. This is motivated by the fact that nowadays polarimetric SAR systems can provide high resolution <b>ionospheric</b> <b>maps</b> that are not possible using conventional <b>ionospheric</b> <b>mapping</b> tools. This paper investigates a set of new ionospheric parameters that can be observed and mapped by SAR by exploring range and azimuth sub-bands. The range sub-bands are used to estimate the ionosphere independently of polarimetry. The azimuth sub-bands are related to the three-dimensional geometry of the ionosphere, as well as, to its dynamic component. The potential to estimate these parameters from SAR sub-bands is discussed and first results using ALOS PALSAR data are presented...|$|R

The first result of the 3 D images of the ionospheric electron density distribution in South Korea has been generated from the permanent Korean GPS Network (KGN) data. Compared with the profiles obtained by independent ionosondes {{at or near the}} GPS receiver stations, the electron density profiles obtained by the GPS tomographic construction method are in better agreement, showing the validity of the GPS ionospheric tomographic reconstruction.

The local effects of the solar radiant energy are filtered out by normalizing of the TEC in terms of the solar zenith angle &chi; at a particular time and the local noon value &chi; 0 . The degree of perturbation, DTEC, is computed as log of TEC relative to quiet reference median for 27 days prior to the day of observation.

40|$|The {{accuracy}} of satellite-based single-frequency radar ocean altimeters benefits from calibration {{of the total}} electron content (TEC) of the ionosphere below the satellite. Data from the global network of Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers provides timely, continuous, and globally well-distributed measurements of ionospheric electron content. We have created a daily automated process called Daily Global <b>Ionospheric</b> <b>Map</b> (Daily-GIM) whose primary purpose is to use global GPS data to provide ionospheric calibration data for the Geosat Follow-On (GFO) ocean altimeter. This process also produces an hourly time-series of global maps of the electron content of the ionosphere. This system is designed to deliver "quick-look" ionospheric calibrations within 24 hours with 90 +% reliability and with a root-mean-square {{accuracy of}} 2 cm at 13. 6 GHz. In addition we produce a second product within 72 hours which takes advantage of additional GPS data which were not available {{in time for the}} first process. The diagram shows an example of a comparison between TEC data from the Topographic Experiment (TOPEX) ocean altimeter and Daily-GIM. TEC are displayed in TEC units, TECU, where 5 TECU is 1 cm at 13. 6 GHz. Data from a single TOPEX track is shown. Also shown is the Bent climatological model TEC for the track. Although the GFO satellite is not yet in its operational mode, we have been running Daily-GIM reliably (much better than 90 %) with better than 2 -cm accuracy (based on comparisons against TOPEX) for several months. When timely ephemeris files for the European Remote Sensing Satellite 2 (ERS- 2) are available, daily ERS- 2 altimeter ionospheric calibration files are produced.

Additionally, limited data availability and inhomogeneous distribution of GNSS stations could also impact the performance of forecasting.
