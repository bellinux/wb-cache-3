5|$|St Peter's {{is made up}} {{of three}} parts, {{including}} a mid-19th-century west tower, which replaced the original in 1859–60 after it fell down. The perpendicular clerestory is decorated with shields in quatrefoils and is lit with closely set three-light windows. The tall decorated chancel has very large windows. The side windows have reticulated tracery. The large east window was partly rebuilt in 1875–76, and is composed of six lights with two large mouchettes <b>nodding</b> <b>to</b> each other, as well as a very large reticulation unit.|$|E
25|$|Whether Reed excluded, by {{accident}} or by design, {{the names of}} men that accompanied him on such a vital mission, or whether members of the Light Horse sought credit, ex post facto, for a mission {{with which they were}} not involved, is unclear. History seems to have sided with the Light Horse; most accounts of the expedition mention twelve, not seven cavalrymen. A notable exception is David Hackett Fischer’s Washington's Crossing, which—perhaps <b>nodding</b> <b>to</b> the discrepancy—avoids the mention of a figure.|$|E
500|$|Another {{cultural}} reference {{appeared in}} a scene when Emma hears Leroy (who is actually Grumpy) whistling Whistle While You Work (the song used in the 1937 film version of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs), indicating its acknowledged ties to Disney, whose subsidiary ABC Studios {{also happens to be}} the production company behind Once Upon a Time, since Disney has allowed them access to their fairy tale characters and properties for use in the series. [...] "They've given us license," [...] Kitsis said. [...] "I could be wrong, but I think {{this is the first time}} anyone's shown Snow White with a sword, or pregnant." [...] Other Disney references include the blue star candle Emma wishes on, <b>nodding</b> <b>to</b> the scene in the 1940 film version of Pinocchio where Pinocchio wishes on a blue star and his wish is granted by the Blue Fairy (both of whom also make a brief appearance alongside Jiminy Cricket in this episode).|$|E
5000|$|A parrot says, [...] "Remarkable!", a <b>nod</b> <b>to</b> the Our Gang film Forgotten Babies. In a deleted scene, {{the parrot}} also says, [...] "Yum, yum! Eat em up!", a <b>nod</b> <b>to</b> The Kid From Borneo.|$|R

500|$|The video commences with Inna and Antonia {{entering}} the building after <b>nodding</b> <b>to</b> each other. Afterwards, the latter walks to a hall full of partying people while taking and developing photographs. Meanwhile, Inna is shown {{sitting on a}} mask-designed chair surrounded by males in tie in a white room. Stan, dressed in red lingerie, is displayed with a man which she later ties up to {{a chair in the}} video and steals his money. Fellow band member Lori then walks in a neon-green room where both lesbian and gay couples are shown kissing, with the latter being portrayed in a bathtub letting a glass of water falling on one's body. She subsequently writes [...] "911" [...] on a mirror, and all the band members are shown dressing neon and sparkling outfits in order to be visible in the dark. After Lori mixes up some pink drinks, the visual ends with them walking out of the building while throwing all the frames that were taken by Antonia in the beginning on the floor. Scenes interspersed through the main video show the band performing to the track close to each other in light or dark places.|$|E
2500|$|Brian Lowry of Variety praised Moffat's script, {{stating that}} it [...] "emphasizes storyline {{continuity}} and easing faithful viewers into the regeneration transition" [...] {{and closed his}} review by saying [...] "It’s a skillful tonal balance that defines the best of “Doctor Who,” and exemplifies the ethos that keeps the series going strong, <b>nodding</b> <b>to</b> the past with all eyes on the future". David Wiegand of San Francisco Chronicle heavily praised the episode, particularly Moffat's writing, saying that his script [...] "masterfully manipulates audience expectation". He ultimately awarded the episode a perfect 4/4 stars.|$|E

60|$|Matthew {{enjoyed the}} drive after his own fashion, except during the moments {{when he met}} women and had <b>to</b> <b>nod</b> <b>to</b> them--for in Prince Edward island you are {{supposed}} <b>to</b> <b>nod</b> <b>to</b> all and sundry you meet on the road whether you know them or not.|$|R

5000|$|As for the band's name, Tuchscherer said in 2010: [...] "It’s a {{reference}} to The Byrds.
