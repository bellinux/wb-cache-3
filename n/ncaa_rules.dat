5|$|In {{the weeks}} leading up to the Chick-fil-A Bowl, the number of controversies {{surrounding}} Tennessee head coach Lane Kiffin continued to grow. Throughout the regular season, he was linked to violations of <b>NCAA</b> <b>rules</b> and actions that appeared to fall outside the norm for SEC coaches. He was mentioned in a rap song by Lil Wayne, and his combative attitude toward opposing coaches caused friction within the SEC. In the second week of December, he was connected to an ongoing scandal in which Tennessee hostesses allegedly helped lure recruits to Tennessee, violating <b>NCAA</b> <b>rules.</b> Despite these problems, he was a successful recruiter, and gained commitments from sought-after recruits in the leadup to the Chick-fil-A Bowl.|$|E

5|$|In 2008, the ACC {{experienced}} {{a season of}} unusual parity and fielded an NCAA-record number of ten bowl-eligible teams. Six of those possessed identical 4–4 conference records, and the remaining four had 5–3 conference records. Among the eligible teams, N.C. State (6–6) possessed the only non-winning overall record and was therefore forced by <b>NCAA</b> <b>rules</b> to find an at-large berth outside of the ACC tie-in games.|$|E

Thus, all thirteen of Texas's games are counted in accumulating the 652 points. The 1983 Nebraska team scored 654 points, including its bowl game, but only its twelve regular season games are counted for statistics, thus the 624 total points). Their 50.2points per game set a new school record.|$|E

5|$|The Tennessee Volunteers {{entered the}} 2009 season {{following}} a 2008 campaign {{that ended with}} a bowl-ineligible 5-7 record. After the 2008 season ended, Tennessee fired head coach Phillip Fulmer and replaced him with Lane Kiffin, who promised to turn the program around. Kiffin made an offseason splash by breaking the social norms among SEC head football coaches and violating a handful of <b>NCAA</b> <b>rules.</b> In a season-opening win over Western Kentucky, Kiffin appeared {{to have made a}} difference for Tennessee, as the Volunteers had their largest margin of victory in nine years.|$|E

5|$|After denying rumors for decades, in 2004 McElhenny {{confirmed}} {{that he received}} improper financial benefits from the University of Washington during his time there, which included a $300 monthly check. Per <b>NCAA</b> <b>rules,</b> the most a college can offer an athlete is a summer job and a scholarship covering boarding and tuition. A popular (albeit usually jocular) spin on the rumor was that McElhenny essentially took a pay cut {{when he left the}} university to play for the 49ers. This was not entirely untrue; all payments accounted for, including legitimate ones, McElhenny claimed he and his wife received a combined $10,000 a year while at Washington—with the 49ers, his rookie salary was worth $7,000.|$|E
5|$|The nearby Southeastern Conference (SEC), {{which also}} {{encompasses}} college football {{teams in the}} American South, also expanded in 1990. Instead of adding one team, as did the ACC, the then 10-team SEC added two—the University of Arkansas and the University of South Carolina. The expansion made the SEC the first 12-school football conference and thus the first eligible to hold a conference championship game under <b>NCAA</b> <b>rules</b> (the first game was held in 1992). The SEC enjoyed increased television ratings and revenue through the 1990s and by 2003 was earning over $100million annually, with revenues shared out among member schools.|$|E
5|$|Dick Harp was in {{the midst}} of his first season as head coach of the Kansas Jayhawks as the team entered the National Championship game. Kansas came into the season favored to win the {{national}} title. This was due in large part to Wilt Chamberlain joining the varsity team after finishing his freshman year on the freshman team per <b>NCAA</b> <b>rules.</b> At the beginning of the season, the Jayhawks starting line up consisted of Seniors Gene Elstun, Maurice King, John Parker, Lew Johnson, and Sophomore Chamberlain. Ron Loneski replaced Johnson's spot in the starting line up during the season. Harp began the season with a man to man defense, but later switched to a zone in order to give them an advantage in rebounding the basketball.|$|E

5|$|During {{his time}} with the Development Program, he {{committed}} to an athletic scholarship with the Michigan State Spartans of the Central Collegiate Hockey Association (CCHA). Joining the Spartans in 2002–03, he recorded 36 points (17 goals and 19 assists) over 39 games, ranking fourth in team scoring and 13th in the CCHA overall. His freshman year included two CCHA Rookie of the Week distinctions and a hat-trick, recorded on January 10, 2003, in a 5–2 win against the Alaska Nanooks. His efforts as a freshman earned him Spartans Rookie of the Year and CCHA All-Rookie Team honors. Although Booth was eligible for the 2003 NHL Entry Draft, National Collegiate Athletics Association (<b>NCAA)</b> <b>rules</b> stipulated that players {{under the age of}} 19 could not opt into the draft without foregoing their college eligibility.|$|E
5|$|During the University of Michigan {{basketball}} scandal the Big Ten Conference, National Collegiate Athletic Association, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Internal Revenue Service, and United States Department of Justice {{investigated the}} relationship between the University of Michigan, its men's basketball teams and basketball team booster Ed Martin. The program was punished for <b>NCAA</b> <b>rules</b> violations, principally involving payments booster Martin made to several players to launder money from an illegal gambling operation. It {{is one of the largest}} incidents involving payments to college athletes in American collegiate history. It was described as one of the three or four worst violations of NCAA bylaws in history up to that time by the NCAA infractions committee chairman and the largest athlete payment scandal ever by ESPN.|$|E
5|$|In a {{situation}} with more time, Virginia Tech would have kicked the ball off to Florida State and {{hoped for a}} defensive stop to give the offense {{a chance for a}} game-winning drive. With less than twominutes remaining, however, and with Virginia Tech having used all its timeouts, the only chance for the Hokies was to attempt a difficult onside kick. A successful recovery would give the Hokies another chance on offense. Kicker Brandon Pace teed up the ball, and kicked it forwards, bouncing the ball high into the air to create a jump ball situation. Virginia Tech's Xavier Adibi recovered the ball, but because the kick had only traveled nineyards before the recovery, the ball was awarded to Florida State. <b>NCAA</b> <b>rules</b> state that an onside kick must travel at least 10yards before the kicking team can legally touch the ball, and Pace's kick had not traveled the requisite distance.|$|E
