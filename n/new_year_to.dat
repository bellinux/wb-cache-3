5|$|Individuals {{who could}} leave their body in spirit during sleep were called burkudzäutä among the Ossetians of the Caucasus, {{and they were}} called mazzeri in parts of Corsica. The burkudzäutä, mounted on animals or {{household}} objects, flew on a night between Christmas and <b>New</b> <b>Year</b> <b>to</b> burku, {{the land of the}} dead described as a great meadow. There they collected the seeds of agricultural plants and took them to their village, thus ensuring a rich harvest. The dead pursued and shot arrows at them as they flew back home. The wounded burkudzäutä would fall sick after the return, and some of them would die. The mazzeri of neighbouring villages fought each other in spirit on the night between 31July and 1August. The village of the defeated mazzeri would suffer more deaths during the next year.|$|E
5|$|On 8 October, it was {{announced}} that postal workers had voted three to one in favour of taking strike action over job security and working conditions. It was later announced that a national strike would be held on Thursday 22 October and Friday 23 October. After further talks failed, more strikes were announced to take place on Thursday 29 October, Friday 30 October and Saturday 31 October. Discussions continued throughout the second wave of strikes with proposals being put to both sides, but these were overshadowed by the announcement of a third walkout on Friday 6 November and Monday 9 November. However, on 5 November it {{was announced}} that strikes had been called off until the <b>New</b> <b>Year</b> <b>to</b> allow time for fresh talks to take place. A resolution to the dispute was finally reached following lengthy discussions on 8 March 2010, and on 27 April it was reported that postal workers voted to accept the deal.|$|E

But he added that although the postal service would be free from disruption over the Christmas period, a long term deal was still some distance away.

500|$|In May 1944, the {{battalion}} was {{brought back to}} Australia, {{as part of a}} broader plan to return the three AIF divisions to Australia for [...] "training and rehabilitation" [...] while the United States military assumed primary responsibility for combat operations in the Pacific. A period of operational uncertainty followed regarding the future combat role of the Australian Army, and consequently a long period of training in Australia followed for the AIF battalions. After a period of leave {{the battalion}}'s personnel concentrated at Strathpine, Queensland, in July. In August, the battalion moved to the Atherton Tablelands again, establishing themselves at Kairi. After this, the battalion conducted exercises which included collective training up to brigade level, while amphibious training was also undertaken at Trinity Beach near Cairns aboard the British troopship HMS Glenearn, working in concert with Royal Marines. In December 1944, the battalion participated in a divisional exercise. During this period the unit was also introduced to several new weapons, including flame throwers and the PIAT anti-tank weapon, and undertook training in infantry/tank co-operation. A range of training exercises, competitions, sporting events, and recreational activities continued early in the <b>new</b> <b>year</b> <b>to</b> keep the men busy and combat possible feelings of [...] "anti-climax" [...] and [...] "boredom" [...] that may have been associated with the granting of limited local leave after the delay of their expected deployment overseas.|$|E
500|$|Eaton {{was awarded}} the Air Force Cross on 10March 1931 [...] "in {{recognition}} of his zeal and devotion to duty in conducting flights to Central Australia in search of missing aviators". The media called him the [...] "'Knight Errant' of the desert skies". Aside from his crash landing in the desert while searching for the Kookaburra, Eaton had another narrow escape in 1929 when he was test flying the Wackett WarrigalI with Sergeant Eric Douglas. Having purposely put the biplane trainer into a spin and finding no response in the controls {{when he tried to}} recover, Eaton called on Douglas to bail out. When Douglas stood up to do so, the spin stopped, apparently due to his torso changing the airflow over the tail plane. Eaton then managed to land the aeroplane, he and his passenger both badly shaken by the experience. In December 1931, he was posted to No.1 Aircraft Depot at Laverton, where he continued to fly as well as performing administrative work. Promoted squadron leader in 1936, he undertook a clandestine mission around the <b>new</b> <b>year</b> <b>to</b> scout for suitable landing grounds in the Dutch East Indies, primarily Timor and Ambon. Wearing civilian clothes, he and his companion were arrested and held for three days by local authorities in Koepang, Dutch Timor. Eaton was appointed commanding officer (CO) of No.21 Squadron in May 1937, one of his first tasks being to undertake another aerial search in Central Australia, this time for prospector Sir Herbert Gepp, who was subsequently discovered alive and well. Later that year, Eaton presided over the court of inquiry into the crash of a Hawker Demon biplane in Victoria, recommending a gallantry award for Aircraftman William McAloney, who had leapt into the Demon's burning wreckage in an effort to rescue its pilot; McAloney subsequently received the Albert Medal for his heroism.|$|E

2500|$|The {{origins of}} [...] "Happy Birthday to You" [...] {{date back to}} at least the late 19th century, when two sisters, Patty and Mildred J. Hill, {{introduced}} the song [...] "Good Morning to All" [...] to Patty's kindergarten class in Kentucky. Years later, in 1893, they published the tune in their songbook Song Stories for the Kindergarten. Kembrew McLeod stated that the Hill sisters likely copied the tune and lyrical idea from other popular and similar nineteenth-century songs that predated theirs, including Horace Waters' [...] "Happy Greetings to All", [...] "Good Night to You All" [...] also from 1858, [...] "A Happy <b>New</b> <b>Year</b> <b>to</b> All" [...] from 1875, and [...] "A Happy Greeting to All", published 1885. However, American law professor Robert Brauneis disputes this, noting that these earlier songs had quite different melodies.|$|E

Shortly after, [...] "Cross Road" [...] was released on November 10, 1993, which was used to promote the Japanese drama [...] The single was not a hit, but through word of mouth [...] "Cross Road" [...] gained popularity and after 22 weeks sold over a million copies and later, though released in 1993, managed to become the fifteenth best selling single in Oricon's 1994 yearly charts.

2500|$|The {{sound of}} the clock chiming has also been used this way in audio media, but as the Westminster Quarters are heard from other clocks and other devices, the sound {{is by no means}} unique. Big Ben is a focus of New Year {{celebrations}} in the United Kingdom, with radio and TV stations tuning to its chimes to welcome the start of the <b>New</b> <b>Year.</b> <b>To</b> welcome in 2012, the clock tower was lit with fireworks that exploded at every toll of Big Ben. Similarly, on Remembrance Day, the chimes of Big Ben are broadcast to mark the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month and the start of the two minutes' silence. Londoners who live an appropriate distance from the tower and Big Ben can, by means of listening to the chimes both live and on analogue radio, hear the bell strike thirteen times. This is possible because the electronically transmitted chimes arrive virtually instantaneously, while the [...] "live" [...] sound is delayed travelling through the air since the speed of sound is relatively slow.|$|E
2500|$|American {{photographer}} Attila von Szalay {{was among}} the first to try recording what he believed to be voices of the dead as a way to augment his investigations in photographing ghosts. He began his attempts in 1941 using a 78 rpm record, but it wasn't until 1956, after switching to a reel-to-reel tape recorder, that he believed he was successful. Working with Raymond Bayless, von Szalay conducted a number of recording sessions with a custom-made apparatus, consisting of a microphone in an insulated cabinet connected to an external recording device and speaker. Szalay reported finding many sounds on the tape that could not be heard on the speaker at the time of recording, some of which were recorded when there was no one in the cabinet. He believed these sounds to be the voices of discarnate spirits. Among the first recordings believed to be spirit voices were such messages as [...] "This is G!", [...] "Hot dog, Art!", and [...] "Merry Christmas and Happy <b>New</b> <b>Year</b> <b>to</b> you all". [...] Von Szalay and Raymond Bayless' work was published by the Journal of the American Society for Psychical Research in 1959. Bayless later went on to co-author the 1979 book, Phone Calls From the Dead.|$|E
2500|$|The {{first day}} of Tết is {{reserved}} for the [...] nuclear family. Children receive a red envelope containing money from their elders. This tradition is called mừng tuổi (happy new age) {{in the north and}} lì xì in the south. Usually, children wear their new clothes and give their elders the traditional Tết greetings before receiving the money. Since the Vietnamese believe that the first visitor a family receives in the year determines their fortune for the entire year, people never enter any house on the first day without being invited first. The act of being the first person to enter a house on Tết is called [...] xông đất, xông nhà or đạp đất, {{which is one of the}} most important rituals during Tết. According to Vietnamese tradition, if good things come to the family on the {{first day of}} the lunar New Year, the entire following year will also be full of blessings. Usually, a person of good temper, morality, and success will be the lucky sign for the host family and be invited first into the house. However, just to be safe, the owner of the house will leave the house a few minutes before midnight and come back just as the clock strikes midnight to prevent anyone else entering the house first who might potentially bring any unfortunate events in the <b>new</b> <b>year</b> <b>to</b> the household.|$|E
