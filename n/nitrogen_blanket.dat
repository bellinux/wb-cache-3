As a reference, a widely used machine to inject DCPD resins is the Cannon A-100 fitted with a DCPD kit. The most important change is that the resin can never be in contact with air or moisture, which required a <b>nitrogen</b> <b>blanket</b> in the tanks. The tools or moulds are closed tools and are being clamped using a hydraulic press. Because the resins shrink about 6% in volume during reaction, these presses (also called clamping units) don't have to handle high pressures such as for Sheet Moulding Compound (SMC) or expanding polyurethane.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} <b>nitrogen</b> <b>blanketing</b> front during the dead-ended anode (DEA) {{operation}} of a PEM fuel cell. Surprisingly the dynamic evolution of nitrogen and water accumulation in the dead-ended anode (DEA) of a PEM fuel cell arrives to a steady-state suggesting the existence of equilibrium behavior. We use a multi-component model of the two-phase one-dimensional (along-the-channel) system behavior to analyze and exploit this phenomenon. Specifically, the model is first verified with experimental observations, and then utilized for showing the evolution towards equilibrium. The full order model is reduced to a second-order ordinary differential equation (ODE) with one state, {{which can be used}} to predict and amalyse the surprising but experimentally observed steady state DEA behavior...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{develops}} {{models for}} the design and control of Dead-Ended Anode (DEA) fuel cell systems. Fuel cell operation with a dead-ended systems anode reduces fuel cell system cost, weight, and volume because the anode external humidification and recirculation hardware can be eliminated. However, DEA operation presents several challenges for water management and anode purge scheduling. Feeding dry hydrogen reduces the membrane water content near the anode inlet. Large spatial distributions of hydrogen, nitrogen, and water develop in the anode, affecting fuel cell durability. The water and nitrogen which cross through the membrane accumulate in the anode during dead-ended operation. Anode channel liquid water plugging and <b>nitrogen</b> <b>blanketing</b> can induce hydrogen starvation and, given the right conditions, trigger cathode carbon oxidation leading to permanent loss of active catalyst area. Additionally, the accumulation of inert gases in the anode leads to a decrease in cell efficiency by blocking the catalyst and reducing the area available to support the reaction. Purging the anode uncovers the catalyst and recovers the available area, but {{at the expense of}} wasting hydrogen fuel. To understand, design, and control DEA fuel cells, various models are developed and experimentally verified with plate-to-plate experiments using neutron radiography and gas chromatography. The measurements are used to parameterize dynamic models of the governing two-phase (water liquid and vapor) spatially distributed transport phenomena. A reduced order model is developed that captures the water front evolution inside the gas diffusion layer and channels. A second model captures the <b>nitrogen</b> <b>blanketing</b> front location along the anode channel. The reduced order models are combined to form a complete description of the system. They require less computational effort, allow efficient parameterization, and provide insight for developing control laws or designing and operating DEA fuel cells...|$|R

Polyacrylamides have been synthesised by a solution polymerisation process using water as the solvent. The radical polymerisation performed under a <b>nitrogen</b> <b>blanket</b> was initiated by the thermal decomposition of potassium persulphate. The influence of monomer and initiator concentrations, temperature and reaction time on the polymerisation conversion of monomer into polymer and on polymer molecular weight has been investigated. Average molecular weights of the polymers were determined by solution viscometry and membrane osmometry. A procedure for obtaining reproducible viscosity data. has been developed using the Ubbelohde capillary type viscometer. Because of a degassing problem with water as a solvent and membrane breakdown with formamide as a solvent, {{it was found that}} reliable osmotic pressure results were only obtained with difficulty for polymers dissolved in formamide/water (1 : 3) mixtures. Polyacrylamide samples have been separated by analytical gel permeation chromatography with silica packings. Various modified silicas and several eluents were investigated with the aim of reducing the adsorption of polyacrylamide onto the chromatographic packing.

In this thesis a procedure is presented for the fabrication of a microelectrode to monitor the neurotransmitter dopamine in vivo. The microelectrodes are fabricated by in situ pyrolysis of acetylene under a <b>nitrogen</b> <b>blanket</b> onto a quartz capillary. The carbon film was then anodically oxidised {{in the presence of}} 2, 4 -dinitroaniline. These microelectrodes are stable, provide the physical strength to penetrate brain tissue, have a low capacitance, are resistant to fouling in vivo and selectively suppress the endogenous ascorbic acid which oxidises at the same potential as dopamine. With such properties the carbon film microelectrode appears ideally suited for fast scanning cyclic voltammetric studies of cationic neurotransmitters such as dopamine in vivo. xxviii, 323 p. il...|$|E
40|$|Accumulators are {{important}} components {{used in many}} systems at commercial boiling water reactors (BWRs) and pressurized water reactors in the United States. The accumulators are vessels attached to fluid systems to provide 1) a limited backup source of stored fluid energy for hydraulic/pneumatic mechanical equipment, 2) a damping effect on pressure pulses in fluid systems, and 3) a volume of fluid to be injected passively into a fluid system. Accumulators contain a gas that is compressed or expanded as the fluid from the system enters or exits the accumulator. The gas and fluid in accumulators are usually separated from each other by a piston or bladder. In support of the U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission's Nuclear Aging Research Program (NPAR), the Pacific Northwest Laboratory conducted an analysis of available industry databases to determine if accumulator components already had been studied in other NPAR assessments and to evaluate each accumulator type for applicable aging issues. The results of this preliminary study indicate that two critical uses of accumulators have been previously evaluated by the NPAR program. NUREGICR- 5699, Aging and Service Wear of Control Rod Drive Mechanisms for BUT Nuclear Plants (Greene 199 I), identified two hydraulic control unit components subject to aging failures: accumulator nitrogen-charging cartridge valves and the scram water accumulator. In addition, NUREGICR- 6001, Aging Assessment of BWR Standby Liquid Control Systems (Buckley et al. 1992), identified two predominant aging-related accumulator failures that result {{in a loss of}} the <b>nitrogen</b> <b>blanket</b> pressure: (charging) valve wear and failure of the gas bladder. The present study has identified five prevalent aging-related accumulator failures: rupture of the accumulator bladder separation of the metal disc {{from the bottom of the}} bladder leakage of the gas from the charging valve leakage past the safety injection tank manway cover gasket leakage past O-rings. An additional study of the accumulator subcomponents associated with these failures is recommended, including an evaluation of current inspection programs to verify that they are detecting the aging degradation effects. The study may also provide beneficial input to the design of passive accumulator applications in advanced reactor designs...|$|E
40|$|The {{toxicity}} and flammability {{of aircraft}} cabin blankets was investigated, using a controlled atmosphere cone calorimeter with a compartment around the test specimen {{which was used}} for controlled fire ventilation. A calibrated heated FTIR was used to analyse the toxic gases from the raw fire product gas using a heated gas sampling system. The blankets were tested at a heat flux representative of a developed fire and in a ventilation controlled atmosphere at 15 air changes an hour or 20 g/m 2 s, typical of that found in an aircraft passenger cabins. The FTIR was calibrated {{for the analysis of}} 65 species including all the significant toxic emissions. Six different aircraft blankets were investigated and three that had significantly different compositions were fire tested and these included fire retarded and non-fire retarded blankets. Vertical fire propagation was also investigated. Two phases of burning were observed, flaming and smoldering combustion. The highest toxicity was during the flaming phase, but during the smoldering phase there were high concentrations of irritant gases. HCN was the most dominant toxic gas for the two high fuel bound <b>nitrogen</b> <b>blankets</b> and acrolein for the low fuel bound <b>nitrogen</b> specimen <b>blanket.</b> There was evidence of HCl from halogenated flame retardants in the smoldering period. The controlled atmosphere cone calorimeter was shown to be a good method for testing materials for their toxic gas production under realistic ventilation controlled compartment fire conditions. It was recommended that materials that could be part of fire initiation in aircraft cabins or elsewhere, should be subject to fire tests that access toxicity levels at realistic fire ventilation conditions. This work shows that some fire blankets could be eliminated from use if test procedures reflected their toxic gas yields, rather than just their fire propagation and smoke production rates, which is the basis of current aircraft fire material tests...|$|R

40|$|Envelope 'C' {{high-level}} waste simulants {{were prepared to}} represent the chemical composition of the supernates of two tanks located at the Hanford Site in Washington State. Experiments were conducted with these simulants to determine the impact of several chemical and physical parameters on the phenomena of post-filtration precipitation. Baseline experiments were conducted for flow sheet conditions, which involved a reaction of each simulant with 0. 075 M strontium nitrate, 0. 05 M sodium permanganate, and 1. 0 M added sodium hydroxide at 50 degrees Celsius for four hours. Simulants were filtered and stored in the dark under a <b>nitrogen</b> <b>blanket.</b> Chemical and physical parameters investigated were categorized as either reaction or filtrate variables. Reaction variables examined the effect of reaction temperature, free sodium hydroxide concentration, reagent concentrations, and shear level during the precipitation reaction on post-filtration solids formation. Filtrate variables {{examined the effects of}} light intensity, temperature of the filtrate, filtration at 50 degrees Celsius, filter pore size, and oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) on post-filtration solids formation. Experiments were designed to study both primary effects and secondary effects of the parameters. Data presented for the primary effects study indicated that post-filtration solids formed with all treatments examined given sufficient time. However, in the short term (within 48 hours), reacting the simulant at flow sheet conditions but eliminating the addition of sodium hydroxide from the reaction mixture and minimizing exposure to oxygen in the filtrates minimized the formation of precipitates. In addition, the formation of post-filtration solids could also be minimized by reducing the concentration of sodium permanganate to approximately 0. 01 M. In summary, the data suggests that for the base case conditions, lowered reaction temperature and the absence of added NaOH do not result in the formation of dark solids within 16 -days. Similarly, the variable evaluated for the newly optimized conditions that did not result in the formation of dark solids was the 0. 01 M permanganate treatment. The newly optimized conditions also did not result in the formation of dark solids. Post-filtration solids that formed in both filtrates were completely soluble in 0. 5 molar nitric acid. Additionally, the mass of predominantly manganese containing solids that formed in the filtrates was small, generally in the mg/L range...|$|E
40|$|Chip seals are a {{pavement}} {{surface treatment}} used for maintaining asphalt concrete pavements. National Cooperative Highway Research Program (NCHRP) Project 14 - 17 {{was performed to}} produce a national Chip Seal Manual which would consolidate the best chip seal engineering practices. A subcontract to NCHRP Project 14 - 17 performed at Texas A&M University {{was the basis for}} this thesis. It included the following tasks: investigation of a testing and grading system for grading asphalt binder residues from chip seal emulsions; and investigation of texture measurement methods for assessing existing pavement macrotexture before a chip seal is placed. The performance graded (PG) asphalt binder specification, which was developed to characterize asphalt binder properties related to the performance of hot mix asphalt concrete in pavements, cannot be directly applied to asphalt binders or emulsion residues for use in chip seals. Therefore, the surface performance graded (SPG) specification was developed using the same equipment as the PG system but with some procedural modifications and different limiting values for the test parameters. NCHRP Project 14 - 17 utilized the PG and SPG systems to grade base asphalt binders and recovered emulsion residues. Two emulsion residue recovery methods were compared: hot oven evaporation with <b>nitrogen</b> <b>blanket</b> and stirred can with nitrogen purge. The PG and SPG grades were found to be similar for the two emulsion residue recovery methods but slightly different from the base asphalt binder. A strawman specification for emulsion residues in chip seals was recommended for use with the stirred can recovery method. In chip seal construction, macrotexture of the existing pavement affects the rate at which chip seal emulsion must be applied. In this project, existing pavement macrotextures were measured at three chip seal projects immediately before construction using both the sand patch test and the circular track meter, CT Meter. The CT Meter was found to quickly and effectively measure pavement macrotexture. The CT Meter measurements correlated well with the sand patch test measurements. Finally, this project investigated the utility of measuring pavement macrotexture in the laboratory using the aggregate imaging system (AIMS) on pavement cores and on small samples cut from fabricated slabs. Statistical analyses showed good correlation between the mean profile depth, MPD, calculated from AIMS measurements on pavement cores and small samples, based on analysis using 50 mm (2 inch) segment lengths, and the MPD measured on the pavement or on the large fabricated slabs with the CTMeter. These results supported the use of AIMS to measure pavement macrotexture using small samples in the laboratory...|$|E
40|$|Deux types de {{membranes}} peuvent être utilisés pour la séparation des gaz. Les unes sont poreuses et séparent les gaz sur la base de leur masse moléculaire selon un mécanisme de diffusion de Knudsen dans des micropores. Les facteurs de séparation obtenus sont généralement trop faibles pour présenter un intérêt industriel. Les autres, appelées membranes non poreuses, mettent en oeuvre un mécanisme de dissolution-diffusion des gaz dans une fine couche de polymère dénuée de toute porosité. C'est de ces dernières que nous allons parler. Commencé il y a une vingtaine d'années, le développement de ce type de membranes {{a conduit}} aux premières applications industrielles en 1979 avec l'introduction par Monsanto des séparateurs PRISM pour la récupération d'hydrogène à partir de différents gaz de raffinerie et de pétrochimie. Après des débuts modestes par suite de la compétition avec des technologies éprouvées comme la cryogénie, l'adsorption et l'absorption, la perméation gazeuse est en train de conquérir sa place parmi les techniques de séparation de gaz. Elle est aujourd'hui l'une des techniques membranaires présentant le plus fort taux de progression (30 % par an). Après un rappel des principes de base de la perméation gazeuse on abordera successivement les points suivants : - le choix du polymère constituant la couche séparatrice, - l'élaboration des membranes à structure asymétrique présentant une peau dense et fine, - les principales applications industrielles. Cela permettra de mettre en évidence les avantages et les limitations actuelles de la perméation gazeuse et de souligner les différents domaines où les efforts de R et D peuvent amener des progrès significatifs. Principle of Gas permeation - Gas permeation {{is a technique}} for fractionating gas mixtures by using nonporous polymer membranes having a selective permeability to gas according to a dissolution-diffusion mechanism. Gas is made {{to pass through the}} membrane by applying a pressure difference {{on either side of the}} membrane. This pressure difference causes a difference in dissolved gas concentration between the two faces of the membrane and hence a diffusional gas flow through the membrane. Choice of Polymer - The gas sorption capacity of the polymer depends on its free volume and its physical affinity for the gas. For a gas mixture, differences in affinity are selectivity factors. The mobility of sorbed molecules depends on the free volume of the polymer and on the degree of rigidity of the chains. Vitreous polymers are more selective in this respect than rubbery polymers. This is why they are generally chosen for manufacturing gas permeation membranes. Permeability and selectivity are somewhat antinomic properties, especially when the selectivity is of a diffusional type, i. e. when the polymer acts as a molecular sieve. The definition of new polymers providing a better compromise between permeability and selectivity thus goes via research on the relationships between structure and the permeability to the gas to be separated. In polymers in a vitreous state, the chains are fixed overall, but small local movements, for example such as the rotation of an aromatic nucleus around bonds in the para position, remain possible. It seems that such small movements are beneficial for permeability, while not detracting very much from the selectivity. Structures of chains that are unfavorable for compact piling increase permeability in general to the detriment of selectivity. This is true for chains having non-coplanar aromatic nuclei or ones having bulky groups. Tables 2, 3 and 4 give some structural and permeability data for various polyimides. Figures 4 and 5 show the performances for hydrogen/ methane and carbon-dioxide/methane separations of various polyimides synthesized in our laboratories. Asymmetric MembranesThe membranes used in practice have a particular structure that is called asymmetric, which combines high permeability and good mechanical strength. This structure has a thin dense and selective skin (0. 1 to 1 µm thick) supported by a thick microporous substructure (50 to 200 µm). Such membranes come either in a flat shape or in the form of hollow fibers with their skin outside. The asymmetric structure is obtained by the so-called phase inversiontechnique, which consists in transforming a homogeneous polymer solution into a two-phase medium made up of a polymer-rich phase and a polymer-poor phase. The continuous rich phase prefigures the pore walls of the substructure. Once the poor phase becomes continuous, it will make up a network of communicating pores. Phase inversion can be caused in several ways: (a) solvent departure by evaporation (dry process) (b) introduction of a nonsolvent (wet process) (c) dry-wet process (d) temperature reduction (thermal process). The dense skin is formed on the side where evaporation takes place or where contact is made with the nonsolvent, or again on the cooled side (with the other side being in contact with the support for a flat membrane and a more or less coagulating liquid with a hollow fiber). A dense skin is formed by the superficial polymer overconcentration resulting from solvent evaporation or from its extraction by the nonsolvent before phase inversion. Figure 6 shows a ternary polymer-solvent-nonsolvent isothermal phase diagram on which arrows indicate how the homogeneous polymer solution (I) evolves toward a liquidliquid phase separation (II) or toward a gel structure (III). Industrial Development -Industrial permeators have large membrane surface areas in a compact form. These areas can be up to 500 m²/m³ for the flat version and up to 8000 m²/m³ for the hollow-fiber version. This compactness is obtained by the spiral winding of flat membranes or by the grouping of hollow fibers in bundles. Fig. 7 shows both types of permeators. The advantages of gas permeation lie in the small investment required, low energy consumption, great flexibility of implementation because of the modular nature and the possibility of the great automation of permeators, and the moderate size and weight of the installation. Limitations are linked to the difficulty in obtaining both good purity and high yield for a product with a membrane surface area that is economically acceptable. Likewise, the pressure drop undergone by the permeate may be a disadvantage. Gas permeation can be associated with other separation techniques such as pressure swing adsorption, freeze drying or absorption. The principal applications of gas permeation at present are as follows: (a) Hydrogen recovery from drain effluents from ammonia synthesis units in which hydrogen has to be separated from nitrogen, methane and argon. (b) Hydrogen recovery from refinery gas in which the hydrogen is mixed with hydrocarbons, hydrogen sulfide and water vapor. (c) Adjustment of the hydrogen/carbon-monoxide ratio of alcohol synthesis gas. (d) Air fractionating from the production of <b>blanketing</b> <b>nitrogen.</b> (e) Natural-gas dehydration and sweetening with a view to its transportation by pipeline, especially in offshore production.
