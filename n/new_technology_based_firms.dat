The questionnaire survey reveals that a relatively high proportion of Japanese VCists place a special importance on the interview with entrepreneurs, and curriculum vitae of management in valuating the potential investments.

Growing attention is being focused upon the small firm sector as a seedbed for Innovation and government policy has been changing to encourage the entrepreneurial <b>new</b> <b>technology</b> <b>based</b> <b>firm</b> (NTBF). The novel perspective of this research results from working in such a firm. It provides a longitudinal study of the management of innovation {{in conjunction with the}} corporate strategy of the firm. Given that the researcher was a participant and observer in the firm studied, the research is akin to action research in methodology but is better described as grounded theory. Theoretical concepts are drawn from the prescriptive literature describing corporate strategy, and from the empirical literature which has evaluated new product success and failure. Models of the Innovation process are discussed and appropriate strategies and reasons for product innovation failure in NTBFs are described. The strategy, structure and new product development progress of the company are examined, using both the researcher's observations and company documents. This provides information on the methods and practices adopted for product innovation in a NTBF. The thesis analyses the performance of the firm In terms of product innovation. The models and strategies derived from the literature are then tested {{in the light of the}} experience of the company. Conclusions are drawn regarding strategies for innovation in NTBFs and about the innovation process in general. The importance of a NTBF adopting a synergistic strategy is shown. Links are established between the existence of synergy in the strategy and coupling in the management of innovation. Innovation is shown to be a laterally interdisciplinary exercise and therefore the "pipeline model" Is criticised. Finally a set of guidelines Is produced for the managers of NTBFs...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} how five intergovernmental big-science organizations facilitate {{the creation of}} <b>new</b> <b>technology</b> <b>based</b> <b>firms.</b> The context of intergovernmental research organization is underexplored in the literature {{when it comes to}} technology transfer in general, and no studies with the objective of comparing several organizations in this context have been performed prior to this study. The purpose of the thesis is hence to do to develop a better understanding of this context, with regards to facilitation of new ventures. The study uses a multiple case study approach, using semi-structured interviews as the main approach to gathering data. Cross case analysis is performed according to a framework based on the literature review and the research questions. The most important contribution of the study is an overview of five very different technology transfer initiatives, with a focus on how they support <b>new</b> <b>technology</b> <b>based</b> <b>firms.</b> These initiatives were of very different maturity and employed different strategies. The support for creation of <b>new</b> <b>technology</b> <b>based</b> <b>firms,</b> spanned from only giving access to the intellectual property to a full package from the opportunity recognition to associated venture capital. The study has also identified several factors that contribute to the facilitation of <b>new</b> <b>technology</b> <b>based</b> <b>firms,</b> like engaging students in opportunity recognition, employment contracts, internal technology transfer funds and associated incubators. A classification of different types of <b>new</b> <b>technology</b> <b>based</b> <b>firms</b> that are associated with international research centres is developed and suggestions on how to facilitate the creation of the different types are provided. The context of intergovernmental research centres has several possibilities for future research. Firstly, developing a more holistic picture of the technology transfer in general in these organizations as this study only focused on facilitation of <b>new</b> <b>technology</b> <b>based</b> <b>firms.</b> Secondly, expand the scope to include other forms of big-science initiatives like national labs, and thirdly to explore the same research questions from the new companies perspective. </p...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, I {{review the}} {{existing}} literature in order to elucidate the investment processes of venture capitalists from the pre-investment stage to the post-investment stage, {{with a focus on}} venture capitalists who invest in <b>new</b> <b>technology</b> <b>based</b> <b>firms.</b> Additionally, I discuss factors associated with growth stages and factors associated with technology separately, with regard to the function of these venture capitalists. With respect to investment processes of venture capitalists, Manigart et at al. claimed that the post-investment activities of venture capitalists will influence the rate of required return in pre-investment valuations. Bygrave and Timmons discussed the function of venture capitalists that revolves around the growth stages, and stated that venture capitalists that invest in early stage ventures must have, in addition to the astute ability to select promising portfolio firms, the ability to support and add value to the portfolio firms after investment. With respect to venture capitalists that invest in <b>new</b> <b>technology</b> <b>based</b> <b>firms,</b> Pfirrmann et al identified 3 types of risk; i. e. business risk, innovation risks and financial risks. Baum and Silverman maintain that venture capitalists investing in <b>new</b> <b>technology</b> <b>based</b> <b>firms</b> are likely to consistently combine both scouting for excellent technology as well as being able to coach by imparting management skills. With the rise of the developing nations, and the escalation of global economic competition, the commercialization and industrialization of new technologies such as biotechnology and nanotechnology is promising for the revitalization of the economies of Japan and other industrialized nations. The creation of ventures based on these new technologies is one of the important options for commercialization and industrialization, and it is desirable that during this creation process, venture capitalists not simply parasite high-tech entrepreneurs, but instead provide value to them and exercise originality...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{set out to}} {{find the}} motivations and abilities that affected the decision of venture capitalists and early stage <b>new</b> <b>technology</b> <b>based</b> <b>firms</b> to provide and accept early stage venture capital. A behavioral perspective was used to build a conceptual framework of intrinsic motivations, extrinsic motivations and abilities that could induce or prevent the provision or acceptance of venture capital at a micro-level. A sample of venture capitalists and a sample of <b>new</b> <b>technology</b> <b>based</b> <b>firms</b> were then surveyed digitally on their motivations with both perception indicators and a set of behavioral indicators related to their decision to engage in venture capital funding. The results indicate that late stage Venture Capitalists experience four barriers preventing expansion into early stage investments, namely low return/risk rates of early stage deals, lack of sector experience, the potential reputational harm of early stage investments and the different time investments required for an early stage portfolio. Early stage oriented Venture Capitalists experience no lack of capital or business proposals, but are likely limited by human capital constraints. On the receiving end, <b>New</b> <b>Technology</b> <b>Based</b> <b>Firms</b> do not identify the added value of the VCs and are drawn to its’ substitutes instead. Lack of local involvement of the VC, distrust of the references of intermediaries and unsatisfactory negotiation results further decrease the acceptance rate of venture capital. Policy makers must address the current informational market failure and beware of a potential supply side human capital shortages on the early stage VC market. Quantitative investigation at micro level into the behavior of market level actors is still accompanied with significant conceptual and practical challenges. However, several widely accepted effects could not be confirmed at the micro level and some findings even appeared to contradict current beliefs.
