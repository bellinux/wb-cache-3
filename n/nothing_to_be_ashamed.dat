500|$|In 1992, Gunn's two-year-old daughter, Francesca, was {{diagnosed}} with leukaemia. Norwich City fans were at first astonished {{by the sight of}} the goalkeeper running out with a completely shaven head. In the words of author and Norwich supporter, Kevin Baldwin, [...] "Occasionally, the gap between the crowd and the players can cause unfortunate misunderstandings. A few months ago, Gunn shaved his head and we all laughed at him ... I was especially keen ... to shout [...] "Baldy!" ... It now turns out that his daughter was undergoing chemotherapy at the time, which made her hair fall out. He shaved his head to show her that this was <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>ashamed</b> of. Sorry, Bryan." [...] When news spread of the reason for Gunn's shaven head, he received [...] "support from the whole of the sporting world and the people of Norfolk".|$|E
500|$|Rudolph Schnaubelt (1863–1901) was {{an activist}} and the brother-in law of Michael Schwab. He {{was at the}} Haymarket when the bomb exploded. Schnaubelt was indicted with the other {{defendants}} but fled the city and later the country before he could be brought to trial. He was the detectives' lead suspect, and state witness Gilmer testified he saw Schnaubelt throw the bomb, identifying him from a photograph in court. Schnaubelt later sent two letters from London disclaiming all responsibility, writing, [...] "If I had really thrown this bomb, surely I would have <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>ashamed</b> of, but in [...] truth I never once thought of it." [...] He is the most generally accepted and widely known suspect and figured as the bomb thrower in The Bomb, Frank Harris's 1908 fictionalization of the tragedy. Written from Schnaubelt's point of view, the story opens with him confessing on his deathbed. However, Harris's description was fictional and those who knew Schnaubelt vehemently criticized the book.|$|E

"The most {{important}} thing to bear in mind when arrested is that you are a volunteer of a revolutionary Army, that you have been captured by an enemy force, that your cause is a just one, that you are right and that the enemy is wrong and that as a soldier you have taken the chance expected of a soldier and that there is <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>ashamed</b> of in being captured.|$|E
2500|$|In 2010 Massow {{developed}} an aneurysm and became seriously ill. He required urgent hospital treatment, including {{at one point}} having to be operated on without anaesthetic, which saved his life. Massow subsequently described the experience as uplifting, stating that [...] "The prospect of dying wasn't frightening, as I'd thought, but calm and full of relief. And instead of thinking about a tomorrow that wouldn't come, I looked over my past 'life' and was actually quite proud and happy I'd acquitted myself OK. There was <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>ashamed</b> of." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, yes, mother; by all means:" [...] and then, {{with some}} {{surprise}} marked in his countenance, he prepared a seat for her. Such a visit as this from Lady Arabella was very unusual; so much so, {{that he had}} probably not seen her in his own room since {{the day when he}} first left school. He had <b>nothing,</b> however, <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>ashamed</b> of; <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> conceal, unless it were an open letter from Miss Dunstable which he had in his hand when she entered, and which he somewhat hurriedly thrust into his pocket.|$|R

6000|$|... "That's in keeping--you {{must have}} felt as if you <b>were</b> coming <b>to</b> bury me!" [...] And she forced a smile of {{encouragement}} to an easy view of their situation. She had reasoned the matter well out, making it perfectly clear that she broke no faith and falsified no contract; but for all this {{she was afraid of}} her visitor. She <b>was</b> <b>ashamed</b> of her fear; but she was devoutly thankful there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> else <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>ashamed</b> of. He looked at her with his stiff insistence, an insistence in which there was such a want of tact; especially when the dull dark beam in his eye rested on her as a physical weight.|$|R
2500|$|Obituaries for {{her were}} {{published}} in The New York Times, the Los Angeles Times, The Washington Post, The Sydney Morning Herald, and the Corriere della Sera, amongst others. The Sydney Morning Herald also republished one of her last blog posts, in which she discussed how engaging with a difficult activity had taught her about helping students with their own difficulties, partly by teaching them to celebrate the little successes {{on the way to}} a goal. She wrote that, [...] "Ultimately, nothing was more helpful for me than failing repeatedly" [...] and that she wanted her students to realize that failures could be part of learning and were <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>ashamed</b> of. The journal ABO, which Wadewitz had worked for from 2011 to 2012, dedicated its March 2014 issue to Wadewitz.|$|E
2500|$|On 14 April, in the Commons, Powell claimed [...] "it is {{difficult}} to fault the military and especially the naval measures which the Government have taken". He added: [...] "We are in some danger of resting our position too exclusively upon the existence, the nature and {{the wishes of the}} inhabitants of the Falkland Islands... if the population of the Falkland Islands did not desire to be British, the principle that the Queen wishes no unwilling subjects would long ago have prevailed; but we should create great difficulties for ourselves in other contexts, as well as in this context, if we rested our action purely and exclusively on the notion of restoring tolerable, acceptable conditions and self-determination to our fellow Britons on the Falkland Islands.... I do not think that we need be too nice about saying that we defend our territory as well as our people. There is nothing irrational, <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>ashamed</b> of, in doing that. Indeed, it is impossible in the last resort to distinguish between the defence of territory and the defence of people".|$|E
2500|$|Another {{factor is}} also, that, for example {{decision-makers}} in government offices and upper echelons {{are not allowed}} to show weaknesses or signs of disease etc., because this would immediately lead to doubts of the ability for further responsibility. Only 20% of managers (e.g. in Germany) do sports regularly and also only 2% keep regularly preventive medical check-up. In such a position other priorities seem to be set and the time is lacking for regular sports. Frightening is that the job has such a high priority, that people waive screening as a sign of weakness. In contrast to that, the burnout syndrome seems to be gaining popularity. There seems <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>ashamed</b> to show weaknesses, but quite the opposite: The burnout is part of a successful career like a home for the role model family. Besides that the statement which describes the burnout as a [...] "socially recognized precious version of the depression and despair that lets also at the moment of failure the self-image intact" [...] fits and therefore concludes [...] "Only losers become depressed, burnout against it is a diagnosis for winners, more precisely, for former winners.".|$|E
2500|$|After the game, {{sports writer}} Harry Bullion {{wrote in the}} Detroit Free Press: [...] "M.A.C.'s defeat <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> for her <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>ashamed</b> of. [...] It simply {{was a case of}} a better-conditioned and smarter eleven overpowering another that, though it lacked nothing in the way of fight that its enemy possessed, failed to cope with the {{superior}} knowledge of the game that was Michigan's by right of judgment and the attending conditions." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Death from {{accident}} while {{engaged in}} illegal fishing." [...] That was {{the verdict of}} the coroner's jury; {{and that is why}} I pride myself on the neat and artistic way in which I finished off John Claverhouse. There was no bungling, no brutality; <b>nothing</b> of which <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>ashamed</b> in the whole transaction, as I am sure you will agree. No more does his infernal laugh go echoing among the hills, and no more does his fat moon-face rise up to vex me. My days are peaceful now, and my night's sleep deep.|$|R
500|$|Additional {{controversy}} developed {{after the}} battle about Pickett's personal location during the charge. The fact that fifteen of his officers and all three of his brigadier generals were casualties while Pickett managed to escape unharmed led many to question his proximity to the fighting and, by implication, his personal courage. The 1993 film Gettysburg depicts him observing on horseback from the Codori Farm at the Emmitsburg Road, {{but there is no}} historical evidence to confirm this. It was established doctrine in the Civil War that commanders of divisions and above would [...] "lead from the rear", while brigade and more junior officers <b>were</b> expected <b>to</b> lead from the front, and while this was often violated, there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> for Pickett <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>ashamed</b> of if he coordinated his forces from behind.|$|R
2500|$|Thirty {{years after}} the scandal broke, Amanda Marcotte {{suggested}} in The Daily Beast that [...] "we owe a lot to Vanessa Williams for being a pioneer {{when it comes to}} showing the world how to recover when you’ve been unjustly shamed for being sexual. Williams could have slunk off into the shadows in shame, which no doubt many people at the time expected her to do. Williams picked herself up and kept fighting for a career as an entertainer, first by becoming a successful singer and then becoming a well-known comic actress ... Sleazy people tried to drag Vanessa Williams down with accusations of being sexual 30 years ago, but she moved on, showing she had <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>ashamed</b> of." [...] In addition, Williams commented on her ability to persevere after these events in a 2015 interview with Entertainment Tonight by stating that [...] "you can't give up ... you always have to remember what you're made of and not let circumstances get in the way. They might delay your progress for the moment, but you always have to remember who you are, and that will give you the eyes on the prize." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "I just couldn't {{believe there}} was no flag", Clark said after the game, in {{reference}} to Davis' contact with him. [...] "I mean, I just assumed it would be thrown. When I heard the crowd cheering, I gave the ref an earful. I'm not saying that cost us the game. I don't think any of the calls would have changed anything because the 49ers have a better team. But there were some calls out there we should have had." [...] "I'm not going {{to walk out of}} here crying", Redskins coach Joe Gibbs added. [...] "We got beat fair and square. I did think there were some things called wrong. Rice outweighs Darrell Green by 20 pounds and gets 15 yards (for Green's flinging tackle). That's hard to understand." [...] Rypien added [...] "I don't think the score was any indication of how the game was played. We have <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>ashamed</b> about other than the score. You look at 28-10 and it looks like they pretty much handled us, but all of you that watched the game know that it's a different story. We had our chances. We had our shots. We just didn't make the plays we had to." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{was afraid}} she would be--I knew she would be, in fact; and {{for that very reason}} I hesitated to do it, as I hesitated to dance with you the first time I met you, as soon as I knew who you really were. But I felt I ought to face it out. You know by this time, no doubt, Miss Hazleden, that my mother was once a slave on your grandfather's estate. Now, it is a theory of mine--a little Quixotic, perhaps, but still a theory of mine--that the guilt and the shame of slavery lay with the slave-owners (forgive me if I must needs speak against your own class), and not with the slaves or their descendants. We have <b>nothing</b> on earth <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>ashamed</b> of. Thinking thus, I felt it {{incumbent}} upon me to call at Palmettos, partly in defence of my general principles, and partly also because I wished to see whether you shared your mother's ideas on that subject." ...|$|R
60|$|And now, {{because my}} mind was not {{confused}} enough before, I complicated its confusion fifty thousand-fold, by having states and seasons when I was clear that Biddy was immeasurably better than Estella, and that the plain honest working life <b>to</b> which I <b>was</b> born had <b>nothing</b> in it <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>ashamed</b> of, but offered me sufficient means of self-respect and happiness. At those times, I would decide conclusively that my disaffection to dear old Joe and the forge was gone, and that I {{was growing up in}} a fair way <b>to</b> <b>be</b> partners with Joe and to keep company with Biddy,--when all in a moment some confounding remembrance of the Havisham days would fall upon me like a destructive missile, and scatter my wits again. Scattered wits take a long time picking up; and often before I had got them well together, they would be dispersed in all directions by one stray thought, that perhaps after all Miss Havisham <b>was</b> going <b>to</b> make my fortune when my time was out.|$|R
