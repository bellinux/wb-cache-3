40|$|One of {{the primary}} tasks of the GeoCAP team of the Joint Research Centre (JRC) Agriculture Unit is to provide {{technical}} and methodological support on the control of Common Agriculture Policy (CAP) subsidies to EU Member State National Administrations involved in the annual Control with Remote Sensing (CwRS) campaigns. This assistance covers {{a broad range of}} issues related not only to the workflow <b>of</b> <b>on-the-spot</b> <b>checks,</b> but also to other relevant topics such as: evaluation of the currency of the Land Parcel Identification System (LPIS); quality control of aerial or satellite orthoimagery; area measurements using GPS and many others. The provision and dissemination of technical information through the Web is considered a powerful means to provide immediate assistance to users. However, in order to be effective, the information should be presented in well-structured, ¿subject-oriented¿, manner through a simple and user-friendly interface. There is already a substantial knowledge archive collected in the JRC and organized in different technical guidelines, recommendations, specifications and working documents, for which access needed to be optimized. To address this need, the GeoCAP team implemented a process of review, reorganization and consolidation of the technical and regulatory reference documentation available, in order to provide this knowledge base to users though Wiki-technologies. Such collaborative software tools are already broadly used in Knowledge Management; the use in government services, however, is still quite under developed. In the beginning of 2008, the first version of the system, called WikiCAP, was made available online to the users for review and feedback. JRC. G. 3 -Agricultur...|$|R

If eye witnessing is reality-conferring, then, the powerful Renaissance act of reading a text as a simulation of eye witnessing is reality-conferring too.

On 5 April, Arblaster announced the implementation of a 3 million dollar per annum scheme of funding for state sporting organisations and the establishing of a State Sporting Secretariat, to provide administrative assistance to those sporting bodies. He held this post to 14 May 1976 when the Liberal Party lost the 1976 election to the Australian Labor Party under Neville Wran. Thereafter he was appointed as Shadow Minister for Public Works, Ports and Housing under Opposition leader Willis until his resignation on 16 December 1977. Arblaster then announced his intention to contest the vacant leadership against John Maddison, Peter Coleman and Kevin Rozzoli.

25|$|Although {{meant to}} take place in Santa Barbara, California, the installment, like the {{majority}} of Psychs episodes, was filmed in and around the Vancouver area of British Columbia. According to the show's creator Steve Franks, about half of the scenes in each episode are filmed in the suburb town of White Rock. Several of the sets, like the Psych office and Henry Spencer's house, are located along the coast in the White Rock area. Because of the differences between Vancouver and Santa Barbara, the show's producers were forced to bring in props for each episode, such as nine fake palm trees which had to be trucked to the set every day. The scripts for each Psych episode had to go through several reviews, and often were cut down by as many as one hundred pages.

40|$|A {{key element}} in Australian {{policing}} {{in recent years is}} the growth of police-imposed discretionary summary justice. The rise and impact <b>of</b> <b>on-the-spot</b> fines, infringement notices, exclusion orders and move-on powers enable police-initiated resolutions and punishments to be imposed, often without legal or judicial intervention. These operational policing mechanisms reflect underlying pressures to reduce costs, ease the burden on the court system, and speed up the decision-making process, but when viewed from a human rights perspective the potential consequences are significant. Focusing on the legislative development of banning notices in Victoria, this article highlights the impact of such a police-imposed punishment upon individual due process procedural protections. Banning notices deny the recipient the right to conduct a defence, undermine the presumption of innocence, and conflate notions of pre-emption and punishment. The rhetoric upon which the banning notice legislation is predicated obviates meaningful scrutiny of the diminution of individual rights that are implicit in its enactment. A perceived ‘need’ to control disorder and ‘re-balance’ justice to prioritise community protection is used to legitimise any consequential impact upon the principles of criminal law, due process and human rights...|$|R

40|$|There is an {{increasing}} interest to re-invent device technologies for use in actual field applications where resources may be limited. Numerous examples exist in the medical and agricultural industry where the demand and benefits for <b>on-the-spot</b> methods <b>of</b> sample collection, preparation, and characterization is being recognized by the scientific community. Some key attributes of devices that cater to this demand <b>of</b> <b>on-the-spot</b> testing are portability, low cost, disposability, easy fabrication and storage, simple operational procedure, and reasonable sensitivity and selectivity. Within the abovementioned realm of device technologies, the thesis attempts to provide low-cost alternative methods for two applications: (i) fluid flow in paper microfluidic devices and (ii) nematode egg separation and counting. Chapter 1 presents a technique to control and operate fluid flow between multiple paper substrates by employing a folded paper cantilever strip. The paper strip is mechanically actuated by a small fluid droplet. The technique can be scaled up to accomplish multiple colorimetric tests, and is demonstrated for the parallel detection of three analytes (glucose, nitrite, and protein). This actuator is intended for use in paper microfluidic devices to quantify levels of disease biomarkers. Chapter 2 describes a method to separate nematode eggs from soil particles followed by counting the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> eggs within a fluid suspension. Nematode eggs with similar-sized soil particles are collected {{from a series of}} soil processing steps. Conventionally, through a staining procedure and sucrose centrifugation, a relatively cleaner soil suspension with eggs is obtained that is later counted manually on a microscopic slide. Here we present a method of density-based centrifugation that seems to provide better efficiency in separating the eggs from the soil particles. Egg counting from large-volume fluids is accomplished on a scanner with a custom imaging software that recognizes and counts the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> eggs. In summary, the use of paper substrates is advocated in the thesis because they are considerably cheaper than polymeric substrates and can be easily fabricated, molded, stored, transported, and imaged. For both applications, the methods presented here could be adopted in field settings and integrated with other current procedures of sample preparation and characterization...|$|R
