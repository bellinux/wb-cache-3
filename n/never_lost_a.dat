5|$|In 1961, Fischer {{started a}} 16-game match with Reshevsky, split between New York and Los Angeles. Reshevsky, 32 years Fischer's senior, was {{considered}} the favorite, since he had far more match experience and had <b>never</b> <b>lost</b> <b>a</b> set match. After 11 games and a tie score (two wins apiece with seven draws), the match ended prematurely due to a scheduling dispute between Fischer and match organizer and sponsor Jacqueline Piatigorsky. Reshevsky was declared the winner, by default, and received the winner's share of the prize fund.|$|E

5|$|Steve Prefontaine {{arrived on}} campus in 1969 and immediately, head coach Bowerman and {{assistant}} coach Bill Dellinger had their hands full {{to rein in}} the rebellious new athlete. The bold running style of Prefontaine, front-running, was a strategy that altered the pace of the sport. At one point, Prefontaine held every American distance record above the 2,000 meters and was thought of by many {{to be one of the}} greatest American runners in history. Prefontaine had <b>never</b> <b>lost</b> <b>a</b> race longer than a mile during his collegiate career and won a total of seven NCAA championships in track and field and cross country. He raced in the 5000m at the 1972 Olympics in Munich, placing fourth in the race. He died in an automobile accident in Eugene in 1975, at the peak of his career.|$|E
5|$|The story {{switches}} {{again to}} Mamoru Takamura. His {{story is the}} most similar to the manga in {{that he is the}} only character in the series to have <b>never</b> <b>lost</b> <b>a</b> fight.

After having a successful boxing career in Japan, Takamura aims for a world title and receives a challenge from the World Junior Middleweight Champion, Brian Hawk. Takamura begins a strict weight management program to drop to Hawk's weight class. When they eventually fight, Takamura is victorious and becomes the new Junior Middleweight Champion of the world.|$|E

5|$|Both {{teams had}} won the UEFA Champions League before; Manchester United had three titles, while Barcelona had two. The most recent of these had come only the season before, when Manchester United beat Chelsea on {{penalties}} in the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow. They won the first of their European Cups in 1968, beating Benfica 4–1 at Wembley Stadium, while their second was achieved in 1999 via a last-gasp 2–1 win over Bayern Munich at Barcelona's home ground, the Camp Nou. Barcelona's first European Cup was won as recently as 1992, when they beat Sampdoria 1–0 after extra time at Wembley; their only other title came in 2006 with a 2–1 win over another English side, Arsenal. Prior to 2009, unlike Barcelona, Manchester United had <b>never</b> <b>lost</b> <b>a</b> European Cup final; Barcelona had lost three – in 1961, 1986 and 1994, to Benfica, Steaua București and Milan respectively.|$|E
5|$|He was a Test {{selector}} for the Australian {{team from}} 1970 to 1981, filling the vacancy {{left by the}} retirement of former Test captain Ryder. Loxton's tenure on the selection panel coincided with a period of great upheaval in Australian cricket, {{on and off the}} field. Up until 1965, Australia had <b>never</b> <b>lost</b> <b>a</b> Test series to any country other than England, and their bilateral contests were regarded as the de facto world championship. However, in the next five years, Australia lost away to the West Indies 2–1, and to South Africa twice, 3–1 and 4–0 respectively. The former all-rounder became a selector after the whitewash in South Africa, joining Bradman and Harvey on the panel. During the 1970–71 home series against England, which Australia lost 2–1, the trio made a raft of changes, handing debuts to nine players, the largest number in a season since 1945–46 when competition resumed after World War II. One of the new players that Harvey and Loxton recommended to Bradman was Dennis Lillee, who went on to become one of Australia's greatest fast bowlers and the world’s leading wicket-taker. However, the season ended acrimoniously when captain Bill Lawry was sacked before the final Test without being informed of his fate; he only learned of his omission second hand.|$|E
5|$|New Zealand {{have won}} the World Cup three times, the only team to have done so. They beat France in {{the final of the}} 1987 inaugural {{competition}} held in New Zealand and Australia, defeated France again in the final of the 2011 tournament, also hosted in New Zealand, and most recently defeated Australia in England in 2015, making them the first and only team to win the World Cup in consecutive tournaments. In 1991, they lost their semi-final to Australia before winning the playoff for third. In 1995, they reached the final, before losing in extra time to hosts South Africa. They finished in fourth place in 1999, after losing their semi-final and then the third-place playoff game. In 2003, New Zealand were knocked out by hosts Australia in their semi-final, before finishing third. The 2007 World Cup saw their worst tournament, being knocked out in the quarterfinals by the host nation France; until this they were the only team to have reached the semifinals of every tournament. As a result of the poor performance in the 2007 World Cup the NZRU commissioned a 47-page report to detail the causes of the failure. The All Blacks have <b>never</b> <b>lost</b> <b>a</b> World Cup pool match, and have finished top of their pool in all seven tournaments.|$|E

5|$|The Marlins {{franchise}} {{entered the}} National League in 1993 as an expansion team, and {{was known as}} the Florida Marlins until 2011. The franchise's first manager was Rene Lachemann, who accumulated 285 losses during his four-season tenure. Jim Leyland and Jack McKeon each guided the team to World Series victories, in 1997 and 2003, respectively; however, the team has never won the East Division. Marlins managers have <b>never</b> <b>lost</b> <b>a</b> playoff series, the only franchise in Major League Baseball to accomplish the feat. McKeon is the franchise leader in wins (281). Joe Girardi won the Manager of the Year Award in his only season managing the Marlins (2006); he is the only manager to win the award while fielding a team with a losing record, and the only manager to win with a team that finished in fourth place in its division. Jack McKeon was named the team's interim manager in 2011, having been named to the position following the mid-season resignation of Edwin Rodríguez. At the conclusion of the 2011 season, the Marlins hired Ozzie Guillén to be their manager for the 2012 season. After firing Guillen, the Marlins named Mike Redmond as their manager. Redmond was fired on May 17, 2015 and replaced by Dan Jennings. On October 29, 2015, it was reported that Mattingly would be signing a four-year contract to manage the Miami Marlins.|$|E
