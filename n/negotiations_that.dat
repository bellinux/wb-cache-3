40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the Akshaya E-Government project.

In particular, we show that the nature of the service delivered and the socioeconomical development supported by the project are constantly shaped by the <b>negotiation</b> <b>that</b> occurs among the different actors involved and the consequent changes the project itself experiences. We therefore suggest to study e-Government in its making and not as results of planned action and sequential evolutionary phases. 18 th European Conference on Information Systems Page 2 of 12...|$|R

5|$|Following the {{capitulation}} of Germany in November 1918, most {{of their}} fleet ships were interned in the British naval base in Scapa Flow {{under the command of}} Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter. Prior to the departure of the German fleet, Admiral Adolf von Trotha made clear to von Reuter that he could not allow the Allies to seize the ships, under any conditions. The fleet rendezvoused with the British light cruiser , which led the ships to the Allied fleet that was to escort the Germans to Scapa Flow. The massive flotilla consisted of some 370 British, American, and French warships. Once the ships were interned, their guns were disabled through the removal of their breech blocks. The fleet remained in captivity during the <b>negotiations</b> <b>that</b> ultimately produced the Versailles Treaty.|$|E

This situation gave additional backing to those Council members who were seeking independence without any ties to other countries. The prime concern at this point was to invite back those members who had left the Council. Negotiations were undertaken that led to the reformulation of previous versions of the Act.|$|E

The accords called for a Palestinian police force to be formed from local recruits and Palestinians abroad, to patrol areas of self-rule. Authority over the various fields of rule, including education and culture, social welfare, direct taxation and tourism, would be transferred to the Palestinian interim government. Both parties agreed also on forming a committee that would establish cooperation and coordination dealing with specific economic sectors, including utilities, industry, trade and communication.|$|E
