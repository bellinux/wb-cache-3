Evidence is given for expert agreement about relevance to <b>nosographies</b> (DSM -IV & ICD- 10), psychometric grounds underlying the validity scales, independence from linguistic competence and verbal intelligence. Nosographic categories {{were reduced to}} the ones of above average importance in the experts’ (N = 29) assessment. Diagnostic indicators were evaluated by a different panel (N = 27) mostly as «useful» (93 %) or «seldom useful» (5 %), agreement varying between 100 % and 79 %. Correlations with intelligence test showed significant only for ten items, therefore excluded from the data bank. The test readability was verified in a quasi-clinical setting (national sample of small groups, N = 410), and on a large national sample (N = 4070) of draftees. The few words «linguistically difficult» in two or more samples were substituted. In the large sample less than 1 % of Ss. omitted or not clearly answered one or more items. TALEI A appears as a potentially sound instrument to be further investigated...|$|R

40|$|A Kuhnian {{reformulation}} of {{the recent}} debate in psychiatric <b>nosography</b> suggested that the current psychiatric classifi cation system (the DSM) is in crisis and that a sort of paradigm shift is awaited (Aragona, 2009). Among possible revolutionary alternatives, the proposed fi ve-axes etiopathogenetic taxonomy (Charney et al., 2002) emphasizes {{the primacy of the}} genotype over the phenomenological level as the relevant basis for psychiatric <b>nosography.</b> Such a position is {{along the lines of the}} micro-reductionist perspective of E. Kandel (1998, 1999), which sees mental disorders reducible to explanations at a fundamental epistemic level of genes and neurotransmitters. This form of micro-reductionism has been criticized as a form of genetic-molecular fundamentalism (e. g. Murphy, 2006) and a multi-level approach, in the form of the burgeoning Cognitive Neuropsychiatry, was proposed. This article focuses on multi-level mechanistic explanations, coming from Cognitive Science, as a possible alternative etiopathogenetic basis for psychiatric classifi cation. The idea of a mechanistic approach to psychiatric taxonomy is here defended on the basis of a better conception of levels and causality.

40|$|With {{this article}} we intend to outline the story of American {{psychiatry}} starting {{at the end of}} the 19 th century until the present time, describing the cultural, political and economic context which culminated in the development and diffusion of biological psychiatry and its <b>nosography.</b> The diffusion of psychoanalysis and of A. Meyer’s psychological psychiatry, beginning {{at the end of the}} Second World War until the end of the Sixties, determined such as an enlargement of psychiatric diagnosis which no longer allowed one to distinguish a sane individual from an ill individual. This “dimensional” model caused a slow process of de-medicalization of psychiatry which removed consent and legitimacy from the discipline. The answer was the publication in 1980 of DSM III, the work of a small number of psychiatrists known as the “Neo-Kraepelinians”. The new <b>nosography</b> based on a categorial diagnostic system, emphasized what is directly observable and therefore measurable, and not what is clinically significant. Whit DSM III and the successive versions the interest of the psychiatrists moved from the clinical to the epidemiological research. In the attempt to take psychiatry back to one of the medical sciences DSM III has in reality continued the process of undermining started whit Meyer and psychoanalysis. And now with the forthcoming publication of DSM V, psychiatry will be confused ever more with neurosciences...|$|E

40|$|Finding {{one major}} hepatotropic virus {{may not be}} enough to {{identify}} the aetiology of liver disease when risk factors are present, particularly in patients with past or present infection with other viral agents, or chronic liver disease. The pathogenic process in these cases is often complex. In the five cases we report, acute hepatitis (initiated by halothane, cytomegalovirus or Epstein-Barr virus) preceded the reactivation of hepatitis B infection, and these events occurred in patients with chronic hepatitis C infection. Each case demonstrates how several viruses can be implicated in the development of hepatitis, either as single agents or via cross-activation of T cells. The <b>nosography</b> of hepatitis, therefore, and the optimum therapeutic choices, can puzzle the clinical team...|$|E

40|$|This article {{reviews the}} current status of Asperger {{syndrome}} (AS) in the child and adolescent psychiatric <b>nosography.</b> Given the lack of well-established diagnostic criteria of AS, the question of its very specificity is put forward: either AS is a distinct diagnostic entity, or it falls into the autistic spectrum. Most specialists rather opt for the second proposition. This article aims at establishing links between several cognitive, neuropsychological as well as psychanalytic features of AS. Coupled with the dismantling process, neuropsychological intermodal integration disorders seem to explain the lack of intersubjectivity. The current scientific challenge is therefore to identify the relevant connections that may exist between the different models in order to alleviate the ongoing uncertainty about the nosologic status of AS. © 2007 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Since the proportions of patients who can be defined as resistant to antihypertensive treatment is elevated, this distinction is mandatory in order to identify only those who need special clinical attention and, possibly, newer non-traditional techniques.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Emotion dysregulation and impulsivity are {{considered}} an hallmark of personality pathology (Livesley & Jang, 2000), even though research has mainly regarded Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD; e. g., Linehan, 1993). Recently, some scholars proposed that facets of emotion dysregulation and impulsivity {{are likely to}} be associated with different PD traits across all clusters (Garofalo et al., 2014; Sarkar & Adshead, 2006), highlighting significant association with all PDs included in the DSM- 5 (APA, 2013). OBJECTIVES: We sought to expand extant research exploring whether also PDs not included in the DSM <b>nosography,</b> yet clinically relevant and suggested for future research, were associated with facets of emotion dysregulation. AIMS: In a community sample, we tested the unique associations between facets of emotion dysregulation and impulsivity with traits of 3 PDs Not Otherwise Specified: Sadistic PD, Depressive PD, and Passive-aggressive PD.

40|$|Gastric carcinoids (GCs), which {{originate}} from gastric enterochromaffin-like (ECL) mucosal cells and account for 2. 4 % of all carcinoids, are found increasingly {{in the course}} of upper gastrointestinal tract endoscopy.

The optimal clinical approach to GCs remains to be elucidated, depending upon type, size and number of carcinoids. While there is agreement concerning the treatment of type 3 carcinoids, for types 1 and 2, current possibilities include simple surveillance, endoscopic polypectomy, surgical excision, associated or not with surgical antrectomy, or total gastrectomy. Moreover, the recent introduction of somatostatin analogues represents a therapeutic option of possibly outstanding relevance...|$|E
40|$|Although Madhava's Rogaviniscaya {{commonly}} referred to as Madhavanidana, is largely based on earlier treatises, it has a stamp of its own, by virtue of its description of new diseases absent from earlier works.

The description of the dosic type of Sula more extensive than that found in Susruthasamhitha is followed by a depiction of two varieties called Parinamasula and Annadravasula both unknown in aerlier medical treatises. So also, while visphota are only cursorily mentioned in the early Samhithas. Madhava confers an independent status on these group of applications. Credit goes to Madhava for having dealt with for the first time new diseases like amavatha, sitapitta, Amalapitta, Masurika, and yonikanda.

40|$|Functional and {{structural}} neuroimaging {{provide a means}} to understand brain function in patients affected by sleep disorders. Herein, we describe neuroimaging findings of primary sleep disorders, including types of dyssomnia related to intrinsic sleep impairments (i. e., idiopathic insomnia, narcolepsy, and obstructive sleep apnea) and abnormal motor behaviors during sleep (i. e., periodic limb movement disorder, restless legs syndrome and rapid-eye-movement sleep behavior disorder). We also include functional neuroimaging studies in sleep complaints secondary to specific psychiatric disorders. Functional neuroimaging may address different kinds of issues in sleep medicine. Functional {{and structural}} neural changes can have a causal role in the pathophysiology of sleep disorders.

40|$|The present work of {{reflection}} proposes {{the approach of}} the concepts of clinical structures and mental health, starting from the position of psychoanalysis and the question is asked if it is possible to think the madness within them.

In this sense, the concept of mental health proposed by WHO is addressed and the place of psychology and psychoanalysis in this concept is questioned. In the same way a reflection is made around the questions: Is it possible to speak of madness in the XXI century, when psychiatry has tried to eradicate this term?

Is it possible to think nowadays the importance of elaborating a <b>nosography</b> that includes Insanity?</p...|$|E

A considerable development over the last years of several lines of biological, biochemical and biophysical investigation techniques has enormously enlarged the chance to obtain significant information by their application in the study of mitochondrial diseases in both in vivo and in vitro clinical applied research. The <b>nosography</b> of mitochondrial diseases is, therefore, day by day enriched by reports of new acquisitions that merge with the innovative contribution that novel laboratory and clinical investigative technologies add to the knowledge of the physiopathology and management of these complex diseases. Apart from the molecular genetic characterization of mitochondrial diseases, different experimental laboratory approaches have contributed, from a molecular point of view, to add new insights in this field of medicine. The strategies of these investigations can be targeted to detect and evaluate the significance of molecules that can play a relevant role in the determination of clinical phenotypes, making it possible to better understand several still unexplained mechanisms of cell damage...|$|E
40|$|The {{advent of}} the Internet {{is among the most}} {{significant}} changes in recent decades and has greatly affected the entire range of human experience.

Literature on the clinical management of the distress related to Internet use systematically measures up to an evolving <b>nosography,</b> with ambiguous definitions of the phenomenon and a diversity of diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic criteria. To date, case studies on "Internet addiction" treatment are rather limited, and no standard clinical treatment protocols exist. With regard to pharmacological treatment options, empirical or anecdotal assessments are mostly referred to. The aim of this article was to review current literature on Internet addiction treatment and assess the extent to which specific pharmacological interventions alleviate these patients' symptomatic burden, to propose a rationale that may guide the therapeutic approach.

40|$|International audienceThe {{fundamental}} {{concepts of}} the theory of humours of the Avicennian thought are often seen as static and a-historical entities whose identity and function were defined once and for all in the classical sources. This article questions this view by looking at the Šifā al-maraż, a Persian medical handbook written in India by Šihāb al-Dīn Nāgawrī in 790 / 1388. In the first chapter, Nāgawrī proposes a shift of perspective in the classical categorisation of humoural pathology of the Arabic and Persian texts. His proposal is based on a combination of Avicennian and Ayurvedic physicians’ views through the assimilation of notions of the latter into the conceptual framework of the former. Nāgawrī’s audacious proposal addresses a key question, since the classification of humours constitutes a central element of the doctrinal identities of both the Avicennian and the Ayurvedic schools. Moreover, a closer reading of this chapter {{raises the question of whether}} Nāgawrī’s intent was to revise both doctrines at the base of his hybrid <b>nosography.</b> His model can be read not only as a key adjustment to the Avicennian view but also as a reconsideration of the Ayurvedic theory which does not count blood among the humours...|$|E
40|$|AbstractGastric neuroendocrine tumors (g-NETs), which {{originate}} from gastric enterochromaffin-like (ECL) mucosal cells and account for 2. 4 % of all carcinoids, are increasingly recognized due to expanding indications of upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. Often silent and benign, g-NETs may however, be aggressive {{and sometimes they}} mimic the course of gastric adenocarcinoma. Current <b>nosography</b> distinguishes those occurring in chronic conditions with hypergastrinemia, as the type 1 associated with chronic atrophic gastritis, and the type 2 associated with Zollinger–Ellison syndrome in MEN 1. Conversely, type 3 and 4 (according to some authors) are unrelated to hypergastrinemia and are frequently malignant, with a propension to develop distant metastases. While {{there is a general}} agreement concerning the treatment of malignant gastric neuroendocrine tumors, for types 1 and 2, current possibilities include surveillance, endoscopic polypectomy, surgical excision, associated or not with surgical antrectomy, or total gastrectomy. This report, based on our clinical experience, discusses how the size, number, depth, histological grading, staging with CT, MRI, and the use of recently developed somatostatin receptor tracers (68 Ga-DOTATATE, 68 Ga-DOTA-TOC) could allow the correct identification of a benign or malignant propensity of an individual tumor, thus avoiding underestimation or overtreatment of these uncommon neoplasms...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} article we intend to demonstrate, by {{following}} Freudian ways of constructing his theories on the psychoanalytical <b>nosography</b> based on paradigmatic cases - such as Dora, for hysteria; the Ratman, for the obsessive neurosis and Schreber, for psychosis - how we could think of a model for demonstration and debate, on the controversial structure or clinical type of melancholy in the literary subject of Faust as it's best example. Since the same Freud has taught us to learn with the masterpieces of universal literature and made himself of his classic clinical cases great literary works and characters, we take the protagonist of his most quoted Drame (Goethe's Faust) {{as a type of}} fictional "support" (Anlehnung) for a metapsychology of melancholy concerning it's relations with knowledge, truth, esthetics, inhibition, and so on. For that, we count as an important background concerning Melancholy and it's relation with esthetics, on the works of Marie-Claude Lambotte and so we will try to demonstrate how Faust can display not only the limitations of that clinical structure (narcissist neurosis, according to Lambotte) but brings also the keys for a savoir-faire based on it's subjective conditions...|$|E

We describe an archival and genealogical research in Italian family with hereditary dementia associated with a novel mutation in the presenilin 2 gene’s disease. Methods: Clinical investigations of the diseased subjects; interviews with relatives; studies of medical records; pedigree analysis; and neuroradiologic, neuropathologic {{studies were carried out}} in the pedigree. Results: Genetic analysis showed a novel PSEN 2 A 85 V mutation present in the proband and in all analyzed affected members, in a subject presenting with an amnesic mild cognitive impairment, and in a young, still asymptomatic subject. The proband showed a clinical phenotype indicative of Lewy body dementia and the neuropathologic examination demonstrated the presence of unusually abundant and widespread cortical Lewy bodies in addition to the hallmark lesions of AD. Other affected members exhibited a clinical phenotype typical of AD. Conclusion: Our findings add complexity to the spectrum of atypical phenotypes associated with presenilin mutations and should then be taken into account when considering the <b>nosography</b> of neurodegenerative diseases. They also support previous data that specific mutations of genes associated with familial Alzheimer disease may influence the presence and extent of Lewy bodies...|$|E

Material and method. The statistic trial is a retrospective, document-based study. The statistical lot consists of 770 initial examination reports performed and completed during the whole year 2007, primarily analyzed in order to summarize the data within the National Institute of Forensic Medicine, Bucharest, Romania (INML), {{with one of the}} group variables being “particularities of the psychiatric patient history”, containing the items “forensic onset”, “commitments within the last year prior to the examination ” and “absence of commitments within the last year prior to the examination”.

40|$|After {{decades of}} {{manifold}} contributions aimed at defining hysteria, somatisation and conversion, such syndromes are still neglected and their nosographical definition is debated. The DSM and the ICD have undergone major changes, but their clinical utility {{with regards to}} these syndromes is still questionable. On the contrary, the Diagnostic Criteria for Psychosomatic Research represents a useful clinical instrument since it translates psychosocial variables derived from psychosomatic research into operational tools. The present paper offers an overview on the psychopathological description of syndromes such as alexithymia, hypochondriasis, health anxiety, thanatophobia, conversion symptoms, anniversary and reaction which are frequent in clinical practice, but often misdiagnosed due to their absence in the DSM and the ICD. In addition, the influence of culture and cultural changes on the modifications of psychopathological manifestations {{is described as a}} further possible source of misdiagnosing and underreporting. New psychopathologies (e. g., multiple chemical sensitivity, orthorexia/vigorexia) that resemble conversion and/or somatisation have been developed, but neither is included in <b>nosography</b> nor taught to clinicians. The aim of the present paper is thus to describe psychopathological manifestations of somatic symptoms and related disorders to help clinicians formulate their diagnosis on the presence of signs and symptoms that can be elicited during a clinical visit, rather than by way of exclusion of other organic or psychiatric disease only...|$|E
