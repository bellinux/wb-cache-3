Ahimsa is not meant to imply pacifism.|$|E

5|$|This bird is {{classified}} as vulnerable by the IUCN and is threatened by habitat destruction. Since the arid, spiny forests in which it lives are <b>not</b> <b>protected</b> by the Malagasy government, it is losing habitat to slash-and-burn agriculture, charcoal collection, and logging. It is also hunted by the native peoples of Madagascar.|$|E

5|$|An {{early success}} {{story in the}} 1950s was the saving of the nene (or Hawaiian goose) from extinction. Birds {{were brought to the}} site and {{breeding}} at Slimbridge was successful. Initial releases into the wild in Hawaii were a failure however, because the nene's natural habitat was <b>not</b> <b>protected</b> from the predators that had been introduced to the islands by man. Once that problem was alleviated, successful reintroduction became possible.|$|E

5|$|In the United Kingdom, H.non-scripta is a {{protected}} species under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. Landowners {{are prohibited from}} removing common bluebells on their land for sale {{and it is a}} criminal offence to remove the bulbs of wild common bluebells. This legislation was strengthened in 1998 under Schedule 8 of the Act making any trade in wild common bluebell bulbs or seeds an offence, punishable by fines of up to £5,000 per bulb. The species is <b>not</b> <b>protected</b> in the Republic of Ireland.|$|E

5|$|Native Americans have {{inhabited}} the Table Rocks area {{for at least}} 15,000 years before European-American settlement. Starting in the mid-19th century during a gold rush, the settlers forced the Takelma tribe away from the Table Rocks and into reservations. The surrounding area was quickly developed. The Table Rock post office was established in 1872, an airstrip was built atop Lower Table Rock in 1948, and a very high frequency omni-directional range (VOR) aviation tower was constructed on Upper Table Rock in the 1960s. The Table Rocks were <b>not</b> <b>protected</b> until the 1970s.|$|E

Salem police estimated they received 30 or 40 calls for marijuana activity in 2007 which were not pursued because the grow operations were legal, even one next to a high school. One grower, a previously convicted felon, was found with evidence of making hash oil, which is <b>not</b> <b>protected,</b> though a grand jury did not indict him.|$|E

5|$|Both {{ships were}} rearmed {{in the late}} 1860s with 14 seven-inch and 2 eight-inch rifled muzzle-loading guns. The new guns were heavier so fewer could be carried. On both ships the eight-inch guns were mounted {{amidships}} on the main deck on the broadside {{and a pair of}} seven-inch guns were mounted on the upper deck as fore and aft chase guns. Eight of the remaining seven-inch guns were also placed on the main deck on the broadside where they were protected by the ship's armour, but one pair was on the main deck further aft where they were <b>not</b> <b>protected</b> by armour. The two ships differed where the last pair of seven-inch guns was positioned: Defence mounted them on the main deck, forward of the armour, while Resistance mounted hers on the upper deck.|$|E
5|$|Claiming the General Assembly's {{decision}} was invalid, Taylor sued to prevent Beckham from exercising {{the authority of}} the governor's office. Beckham countersued Taylor for possession of the state capitol and governor's mansion. The suits were consolidated and heard in Jefferson County circuit court, which claimed it had no authority to interfere with the method of deciding contested elections prescribed by the state constitution, an outcome that favored Beckham. The Kentucky Court of Appeals upheld the circuit court's decision on appeal and rejected Taylor's claim that he had been deprived of property without due process by stating that an elective office was not property and thus <b>not</b> <b>protected</b> by the Fourteenth Amendment.|$|E
5|$|Justice Potter Stewart, {{joined by}} Justice Hugo Black, dissented. Stewart {{acknowledged}} that the Wolf River Treaty unquestionably conferred hunting and fishing rights on the tribe and its members. He stated that the Termination Act subjected {{the members of the}} tribe to the same laws that all other citizens of Wisconsin were held to, including hunting and fishing regulations. In Stewart's opinion, Public Law 280 had no bearing on the case and the rights were <b>not</b> <b>protected</b> by the Termination Act, so they were lost. Stewart did note that this would have also made the claim for compensation valid under Shoshone Tribe v. United States, regardless of whether Congress intended it or not. He would have reversed the decision of the Court of Claims.|$|E

5|$|On August 29, 2007, six AGM-129 ACM cruise missiles, each {{loaded with}} a W80-1 {{variable}} yield nuclear warhead, were mistakenly loaded onto a United States Air Force (USAF) B-52H heavy bomber at Minot Air Force Base in North Dakota and transported to Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana. The nuclear warheads in the missiles {{were supposed to}} have been removed before the missiles were taken from their storage bunker. The missiles with the nuclear warheads were not reported missing, and remained mounted to the aircraft at both Minot and Barksdale for 36 hours. During this period, the warheads were <b>not</b> <b>protected</b> by the various mandatory security precautions for nuclear weapons.|$|E
5|$|Over the winter, {{there seems}} to have been some tension between the Allies. In particular, the Athenians, who were <b>not</b> <b>protected</b> by the isthmus, but whose fleet were the key to the {{security}} of the Peloponnesus, felt hard done by. They demanded an Allied army march north the following year. When the other Allies failed to commit to this, the Athenian fleet probably refused to join the Allied navy in the spring. The navy, now under the command of the Spartan king Leotychides, thus skulked off Delos, while the remnants of the Persian fleet skulked off Samos, both sides unwilling to risk battle. Similarly, Mardonius remained in Thessaly, knowing an attack on the isthmus was pointless, while the Allies refused to send an army outside the Peloponessus.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} storm formed, {{officials}} in Galveston County, Texas issued a voluntary evacuation for {{the western end of}} Galveston Island, as the area was <b>not</b> <b>protected</b> by the Galveston Seawall.

Voluntary evacuations were also suggested near Sabine Pass in Jefferson County, Texas, though few left. Also, when the National Hurricane Center issued the first advisory on Allison, officials issued Tropical Storm Warnings from Sargent, Texas to Morgan City, Louisiana, just three hours before tropical storm winds were observed.|$|E
