40|$|Online {{advertising}} in search engines {{is a wide}} and growing market. In this market, revenue of search engines depends onthenumberofuserclicksreceivedondisplayedads. Thus, {{in order to increase}} the revenue, search engines try to select top ads and rank them based on the expected number of clicks they will receive. For ads that were in the system for a period of time, the expected number of clicks could be estimated based on historical data. For <b>new</b> <b>ads,</b> or those ads without enough historical data, search engines need to predict the potential of these ads in attracting user clicks. We purpose a method to estimate the potential of <b>new</b> <b>ads</b> in attracting user’s clicks. We use semantic and feature based similarity algorithms to predict the click through rate of <b>new</b> <b>ads</b> using historical similar ads. Our trace-based evaluations show that the proposed method outperforms other approaches in the literature in terms of the accuracy of prediction. In addition, the proposed method is less computationally expensive than previous methods and it can run in real time...|$|R

On April 3, Mr. Cherniak posted 7 new videos to the Liblogs video page and issued a press release contrasting the expensive Tory headquarters to the grassroots YouTube campaign.

On April 4, 2007, the video page was included in the front-page story of the Globe and Mail and some Liberal videos were highlighted on page 4.

500|$|Gygax {{immediately}} discarded {{his movie}} ambitions—his D movie {{would never be}} made—and flew back to Lake Geneva. There, he discovered to his shock that although industry leader TSR was grossing , it was barely breaking even; {{it was in fact}} [...] in debt and teetering on the edge of insolvency. After investigating the reasons why, Gygax brought his findings to the five other company directors. (Since 1982, TSR Inc. had conformed to the recommendations of the American Management Association by adding three [...] "outside" [...] directors to the board, increasing its size to six.) Gygax charged that the financial crisis was due to mismanagement by Kevin Blume: excess inventory, overstaffing, too many company cars, and some questionable (and expensive) projects such as dredging up a 19th century shipwreck. Gygax demanded that Kevin Blume be removed as company president, and the three outside directors agreed with him. However, the board still believed the financial problems were terminal and the company needed to be sold. In an effort to stay in control, in March 1985, Gygax exercised his 700-share stock option, giving him just over 50% control. He appointed himself president and CEO, and rather than selling the company, he took steps to produce new revenue generating products. To that end, he contacted Dave Arneson with a view to produce some Blackmoor material. He also bet heavily on a <b>new</b> <b>AD</b> book, Unearthed Arcana, a compilation of material culled from Dragon Magazine articles. And he quickly wrote a novel set in his Greyhawk setting, Saga of Old City, featuring a protagonist called Gord the Rogue. In order to bring some financial stability to TSR, he hired a company manager, Lorraine Williams.|$|E
500|$|In {{the twenty-first}} century the company {{returned}} to independence when it was purchased from Diageo {{by a group of}} investment firms led by TPG Capital for [...] in 2002. The new owners rapidly moved to revitalize and reorganize the company, culminating with the company being taken public in 2006 with a highly successful initial public offering. The firms' strategy for turning the chain around included a new advertising agency and <b>new</b> <b>ad</b> campaigns, a revamped menu strategy, a series of programs designed to revamp individual stores, and a new restaurant concept called the BK Whopper Bar. These changes re-energized the company. Despite the successes of the new owners, the effects of the financial crisis of 2007–2010 weakened the company's financial outlooks while those of its immediate competitor McDonald's grew. The falling value of Burger King eventually lead to TPG and its partners divesting their interest in the chain in a [...] sale to 3G Capital of Brazil. Analysts from financial firms UBS and Stifel Nicolaus agreed that 3G will have to invest heavily in the company to help reverse its fortunes. After the deal was completed, the company's stock was removed from the New York Stock Exchange, ending a four-year period as a public company. The delisting of its stock was designed to help the company repair its fundamental business structures and continue working to close the gap with McDonald's without having to worry about pleasing shareholders. 3G later took the company public again after a series of changes to its operations and structure. Burger King would eventually be merged with Canadian-based donut and coffee chain Tim Hortons, igniting a political controversy in the United States over tax inversions.|$|E
