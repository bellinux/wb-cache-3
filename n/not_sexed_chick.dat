40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare {{performance}} and carcass characteristics of broilers fed diets with different Dietary Electrolyte balances (DEB) during the summer season. A total of 1, 280 one-day-old Ross <b>sexed</b> <b>chicks</b> were distributed in 32 experimental units according to a randomized block design in a 4 x 2 factorial arrangement (4 levels and 2 sexes) and 4 replicates per treatment (40 birds per replicate). Feed program consisted of 3 phases (1 - 21, 22 - 42, 43 - 49 days of age). Experimental diets were formulated based on corn and soybean meal and adjusted to 210, 250, 290 and 330 mEq/kg of Na + K - Cl through the addition of sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate and ammonium chloride. Weekly measurements of body weight gain and feed intake were done, and at 49 days, birds were slaughtered to evaluate the dressing percentage and parts yield. Weight gain during the starter phase increased linearly (p< 0. 01) as DEB increased. Different DEB levels did not affect feed intake or mortality. Carcass characteristics were not affected by treatments. Dietary electrolytic balance influenced weight gain and feed gain ratio from 1 to 21 days, and best results were observed when diets contained 290 and 330 mEq/kg...|$|R
40|$|Sorghum {{is used as}} {{a source}} of energy {{alternative}} to corn, however, its low pigments content are considered hindrance to the use of this feedstuff for poultry. The inclusion of annatto seed by-product (ASB) may solve this problem. In this context, the objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effect of ASB inclusion in diets containing sorghum as the main source of energy on performance, carcass traits, meat color, and economic viability in the production of slow-growth broilers. A total of 420 <b>sexed</b> <b>chicks</b> of the Carijó Pesadão line were distributed in a completely randomized design according to a 2 × 7 factorial arrangement, with three replicates of 10 birds per treatment. Studied factors were two sexes (males and females) and seven diets, wherein one had corn as source of energy and the others contained sorghum plus inclusion of 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15 % of ASB. Irrespective of the sex, diets did not affect feed intake (g/bird), feed conversion (g/g), yields (%) of carcass, breast and drumstick+thigh, percentage of abdominal fat, or relative weight of the liver. However, the inclusion of ASB influenced the color parameters of the meat making it more pigmented and improved the economic viability parameters. In diets for slow-growth birds containing sorghum as the main source of energy, ASB can be included up to 15 %, and meat pigmentation problems can be reduced with total substitution of corn by sorghum with inclusion of ASB from 3 %...|$|R

Those chicks have been divided in two groups: the first group with 40 chicks fed with the diet incorporating papaya leaves flour (Carica papaya L.) (L 1) and the second group with 40 others chicks fed with the diet lacking the aforementioned flour and served as control (L 0). The obtained results indicated that papaya leaves flour based diet was more provided (1337. 5 g) than the control diet (1025 g); The test diet (L 1) had brought about fewer cases of mortality (10 %) than the control diet (L 0) (17 %); The diet enriched with the Carica papaya L. flour is quite better according to its consumption index (1. 4 versus 1. 6 for control diet); The test diet (L 1) has favored more medium live weight (156. 7 g) and average live weight gain (33. 8 g) than the control diet (L 0) with 87. 9 g and 23. 5 g respectively. The results obtained seem to be comparable to those obtained with other foods. For this purpose, it is encouraging to feed chicks using the diet seasoned with papaya leaves as source of antibiotics, proteins, vitamins and anti-helminthes because the imported balanced diet is expensive and has been the stumbling block of development projects in developing countries...|$|R

The percentage of chick weight involved both sexes at hatching time to the original egg weight averaged 70. 4 % for Cornishes, 72. 2 % for White Rocks, and 73. 8 % for F_ 1 s. Significantly high correlation coefficients above 0. 83 in all the breeds were found between chick weight at hatching time and egg weight. The correlation coefficients in the 2 nd-week of age rapidly declined to about 0. 35, and thereafter these decreased to the level of 0. 1.

Drawing from Elizabeth Grosz, Gilles Deleuze, Henri Bergson and Jakob Von Uexküll, I argue that we need to think life beyond the constitution of the organism as the continuous enmeshment of different milieus. Sexual difference is a force of differentiation that articulates relationships between organisms and organs as crucial aspects of many milieus that make up the Earth.

PCR products on the gel electrophoresis vary in size revealing one band in males at the CHD-Z, and two bands in females corresponding to both the CHD-W and CHD-Z. Two independent sets of primer (P 8 /P 2 and 2550 F/ 2718 R) were used to amplify the CHD gene region from both the Z and W chromosome.

After 5 months on the experimental rations it was observed that male birds had higher free cholesterol levels than did females. The addition of cholesterol (2 %) and fatty acids (6 %) to ration increased free cholesterol levels in liver and aorta.

40|$|Our {{planet is}} {{strongly}} suffering from human activities and their consequences. Obviously, {{the animals and}} plants {{have to cope with}} the variable environmental conditions that result from these anthropic activities. The aquatic species are even more vulnerable as, often, their habitats is affected by climate. As global warming causes the temperature to rise, the increase of evaporation and consequent dryness of ponds can highly affect the survival and fitness of their inhabitants. The amphibians are the mostly threatened vertebrate group, and the Yellow-bellied toad (Bombina variegata) {{is one of the most}} endangered amphibian species in Switzerland. In an effort to improve the knowledge on Bombina variegata in Geneva to develop more efficient and robust conservation measures, we monitored 27 sites (21 Genevan and 6 French) during 1 to 5 years using capture-recapture method. In these sites, we monitored 2713 ponds of three different categories: artificial ponds (n= 1302), semi-natural ponds (n= 1147) and natural ponds (n= 264). The first category concerns plastic buckets that were installed in the field. The second category concerns artificial ponds that were dug in the field and made waterproof thanks to clay, or other ancient man-made ponds. The last category concerns natural depressions that were mapped in each site. The sites were monitored at least once a month during the activity period of the toads, for at least one year, but the prospections were much more regular in some sites (TEP: up to 21 sessions during a year, 5 years of monitoring). This census allowed the global observation (sum of capture events) of 2655 toads from 2012 to 2016 in the whole Geneva area. These represent 1587 adults (975 males, 612 females), 737 subadults (444 males, 293 females) and 331 juveniles (52 males, 70 females and 209 <b>not</b> <b>sexed).</b> Among these observations, we were able to recognize 1107 different individuals thanks to the colouration of their belly. We were also able to count 4770 tadpoles and 7819 eggs. The global sex-ratio on the whole study area is 53 : 47. The observed population size per site range from 2 to 433 individuals. Out of the 27 sites, 6 never allowed the observation of Bombina variegata. Among the 21 sites occupied by the toads, 3 did not allow the observation of breeding indices. Thanks to the analyses of the environmental data, we found that the presence of Bombina variegata is especially influenced by water availability. We also showed that the toads preferentially choose ponds filled between 50...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{was to investigate the}} effects of sex-sorting on early fertilization events in ovum pick up (OPU) derived oocytes fertilized in vitro with frozen-thawed sperm at different co-incubation lengths. Eighty-four OPU sessions were carried out in 18 cyclic, dry and non-stimulated Holstein Friesian and German black pied cows. Ovum pick up oocytes were matured in vitro for 24 hours and fertilized with frozen-thawed sex sorted or unsorted sperm from the same ejaculate. Fertilization was achieved by two experimental protocols: 1) short gamete co-incubation length: 4, 8 and 12 hours; and 2) long gamete co-incubation length: 18 and 24 hours. After in vitro fertilization, ova were fixed and stained to identify early fertilization events.

We tested whether five passerine species can be sexed according to standard morphological measurements applying a forward logistic regression with sex determined by molecular analysis as the dependent variable. Furthermore, we tested whether {{the results can be}} used on a larger geographic scale by applying morphological sexing methods gained by similar studies from other regions to our data set. Of the five species of this study only Garden Warblers could <b>not</b> be <b>sexed</b> morphologically. In the Robin, 87. 2 % of all individuals were sexed correctly. For Reed Warblers, Willow Warblersand Reed Buntings, the respective values were 77. 6, 89. 4 and 86. 4 %. When the logistic regression functions from similar studies on Robins and Reed Buntings in Denmark and Scotland were applied to the birds from south-western Germany, they performed less well compared to the original dataset of these studies and compared to the logistic regression function of our own study. The same was the case for Willow Warblers when a wing length criterion used in Great Britain was applied to the birds of our study. These discrepancies may have several explanations: (1) the models are optimised for the dataset from which they were extracted, (2) inter-ringer variation in measurements, (3) the use of different age cohorts, (4) different morphology due to different habitat availability around the study site, or, most likely, (5) different morphology due to different migratory behaviour.

40|$|Molecular {{techniques}} for identifying sex of birds utilize length differences between CHD-Z and CHD-W introns, {{but in some}} cases these methods can lead to sexing errors. Here we show that an additional W-specific primer can be used in conjunction with a pre-existing sexing primer pair to dramatically improve the reliability of molecular sexing methods. We illustrate the approach with American coots (Fulica americana), a species with CHD-Z polymorphism that could <b>not</b> be accurately <b>sexed</b> using traditional methods. We developed a reverse primer GWR 2 designed to sit within the intron of the W chromosome and amplify a distinctively small DNA fragment that serves as a W-specific marker. Analysis of known-sex individuals indicates that this W-specific primer provides an efficient and reliable protocol to identify the sex of F. americana. The development of such sex-specific primers will likely increase the reliability of molecular sexing methods in other birds as well. Comparisons between CHD-Z alleles of coots and common moorhens (Gallinula chloropus) revealed that CHD-Z polymorphism evolved separately in these two closely related species.

The humans have a very large range of δ 13 C (− 23. 3 ‰ to − 7. 1 ‰) and δ 15 N (4. 3 ‰ to 10. 9 ‰) values which reflects extraordinarily diverse diets and included individuals with predominately C 3 {{as well as those}} with exclusive C 4 diets. This wide span of isotopic results produced a subtle linear trend (R 2 [*]=[*] 0. 62) in the human data, which paralleled the animals across the C 3 and C 4 environmental gradient. However, the majority of the individuals had a predominately C 4 diet based on millet with δ 15 N results only slightly elevated above the animals, except for the pigs and cattle. This is evidence that many of the animals were likely used for their secondary products, labour or as sacrificial offerings and that pork and beef were the main sources of animal protein for the population. High status individuals had elevated δ 15 N values (10. 2 [*]±[*] 0. 6 ‰) compared to medium (8. 9 [*]±[*] 0. 3 ‰) and lower status (8. 8 [*]±[*] 0. 8 ‰) individuals, possibly related to increased animal protein in the diet.

40|$|The {{monitoring}} of Polar Bears in Canada {{has been completed}} largely through management unit (MU) wide capture-mark-recapture (CMR) surveys. While this data is very useful {{at the time of}} collection, these surveys are expensive and take time to plan and execute; cannot be feasibly executed across the polar bear range at intervals that reflect the expected rapid environmental changes in the Arctic; and are disdained by the Inuit as being invasive. As part of recent efforts to explore less expensive and non-invasive methods to monitor polar bears (see Wong et al & Van Coevderden de Groot et al this conference) we are evaluating genetic information obtained from non-invasively collected polar bear tissue. In this work we report on the genetic data obtained from non-invasively collected harisnags recovered from sampling stations erected between May-June 2006 - 2009 in M’Clintock Channel, Nunavut. Across the 4 years 344 hair snags were collected; following Paetkau (2004) we optimized 6 microsatellite loci to reliably amplify polar bear DNA from this tissue and we modified the procedure of Pages et al (2009) to reliably genetically sex these tissues. Our estimates for two common errors with this type of tissue across all loci – allelic dropout (0. 026) and false allele (0. 03) - were both less than p =. 05. This suggests these errors are not going to significantly affect the accuracy of the consensus genotypes collected from these data. Using consensus genotypes from relevant hairsnags, we posit a minimum of 59 (max 82) unique bears entered our sampling stations. Of these, 24 % were female, 64 % were male, and 12 % could <b>not</b> be <b>sexed.</b> We resampled 2 bears in 2006, 1 in 2007, 0 bears in 2008 and 14 bears in 2009 – the 2009 value reflects significantly increased sampling effort in 2009. Five bears were re-sampled between the non-invasive surveys in 2006 - 2009. When comparing our data to a subset of cubs and subadults captured during the Taylor et al. (2006) CMR survey of M’Clintock Channel (MU), we found 6 genotype matches. Our sampling stations may have a male bias as the sex ratio from the 1998 - 2000 CMR study was 42. 1 % ♂ (Taylor et al 2006) vs. 64 % ♂ (this study). We cannot accurately determine the age bias (but see Wong et al this conference). Genetic data from Polar bear faecal samples may provide an unbiased sex and age sample of polar bears in any MU. Any data from these samples will help refine hairsnag derived MKNA estimate of polar bears from any MU. Here we report on our efforts to genotype and genetically sex 95 faecals we have collected from M’Clintock Channel from 2006 - 2009. Finally, we discuss the implications of these findings, results from other noninvasive work (Wong et al & Van Coevderden de Groot et al this conference) and ongoing/proposed work in the context of i) a non-invasive Inuit-based polar bear activity and health survey, and ii) a more rigorous census method which may allow more precise adjustments of harvest levels than currently possible using infrequently collected CMR data only.

As amostragens foram {{realizadas}} de novembro/ 2007 à outubro/ 2008, em um trecho do Córrego Perau, no município de Jaguari-RS. Foram realizadas coletas mensais e os indivíduos foram capturados de duas maneiras, com o auxílio de 25 armadilhas tipo covo, sendo que estas foram dispostas no final da tarde de um dia e retiradas pela manhã do dia seguinte. O segundo método de amostragem foi com auxílio de um surber disposto em sentido contrário à correnteza de modo que, com o revolvimento das pedras, vegetação e todo tipo de substrato, os organismos fossem arrastados para dentro do equipamento de captura. Na coleta com surber adotou-se um esforço amostral de 30 minutos. Os organismos coletados foram sexados com base na presença de pleópodos nas fêmeas e ausência destes nos machos e/ou posição das aberturas genitais. Os indivíduos tiveram as seguintes dimensões corporais mensuradas com um paquímetro digital com precisão de 0, 01 mm: comprimento do cefalotórax (CC), largura do cefalotórax (LC), largura do segundo somito abdominal (LA), comprimento do própodo quelar esquerdo (CPE), comprimento do própodo quelar direito (CPD) e altura do maior própodo quelar (ALT). Após registradas as medidas e a sexagem, os organismos foram devolvidos no mesmo local de onde coletados. Durante o tempo de trabalho foram amostrados 1774 indivíduos (1259 machos, 512 fêmeas e 03 indivíduos não-sexados). Machos e fêmeas foram agrupados em classes de CC, onde foi observada uma distribuição bimodal. Os machos apresentam tamanhos significativamente maiores que fêmeas, de acordo com o teste de Mann-Whitney (p 0, 05). A maior incidência de fêmeas ovígeras ocorreu no outono (65, 11 %), seguido do inverno (5, 81 %) e primavera (1, 75 %). Embora os juvenis tenham ocorrido em todas as estações do ano, as maiores freqüências destes, em relação aos adultos, foram observadas no outono (20, 43 %) e no inverno (17, 29 %). A menor fêmea ovígera amostrada em campo mediu 10, 45 mm. O tamanho dos indivíduos no início da maturidade sexual morfológica foi estimado, utilizando o programa REGRANS, em 12, 78 e 10, 78 mm de comprimento cefalotoráxico para machos e fêmeas respectivamente. Machos de Aegla sp. n. exibem heteroquelia, com preponderância de lateralidade da quela esquerda, enquanto fêmeas apresentam isoquelia. Após a muda puberal, uma mudança adicional no nível de alometria em relação as dimensões das quelas foi detectada em machos adultos. Como resultado, dois grupos de morfotipos em machos adultos, aqui designados como morfotipo I e II foram reconhecidos de acordo com o estado de desenvolvimento dos quelípodos. As curvas de crescimento do cefalotórax, estimadas para machos e fêmeas, são descritas pelas seguintes equações Ct = 26, 57 [1 e - 0, 0064 (t+ 18, 14) e Ct = 21, 71 [1 e- 0, 008 (t+ 30, 25), respectivamente. Os machos atingiram tamanhos maiores que as fêmeas e apresentaram taxas de crescimento maiores que essas. A longevidade estimada para os machos foi de 670 dias e enquanto que para as fêmeas foi de 736 dias.

This study aims {{to evaluate}} {{some aspects of}} the biology of a new species of aeglid at Jaguari River basin (in process of description), such as the population structure, the morphological sexual maturity and somatic growth in natural environment. These investigations were conducted from November/ 2007 to October/ 2008, in a section of stream Perau in Jaguari county-RS. Monthly collections were made and individuals were captured in two ways, with the help of 25 traps trap, and these were arranged in the late afternoon of one day and removed in the following morning. The second method of sampling was a surber placed in the opposite direction to the stream flow so that with the revolving stones vegetation and all kinds of substrate and the animals were dragged into the capture equipment. The Surber sampling was made with a sampling effort of 30 minutes. The organisms collected were sexed based on the presence of pleopods in females and absence of those in males and / or position of the genital openings. Individuals had the following body dimensions measured with a digital caliper with 0. 01 mm of precision: cephalothoracic length (CL), cephalothoracic width (CW), width of the second abdominal somite (AW), length of propodus chela left (LLC), length of propodus right chela (LRC) and height of the larger chelae (HC). After sexing and measurements the animals were returned to the same location that where collected. During working hours we sampled 1774 individuals (1259 males, 512 females and 03 individuals <b>not</b> <b>sexed).</b> Males and females were grouped into size classes of CL, where was observed a bimodal distribution. Males has significantly larger sizes than females, according to the Mann-Whitney (p< 0, 05). The sex ratio was significantly different from 1 : 1 in most sampling periods (p < 0. 05) when considering the general data (surber + trap), but followed the expected in most months sampled with Surber (p< 0, 05). The highest incidence of ovigerous females occurred in autumn (65. 11 %), followed by winter (5. 81 %) and spring (1. 75 %). Although the juveniles had been found in all seasons, the highest frequencies of these in relation to adults were observed in autumn (20. 43 %) and winter (17. 29 %). The smallest ovigerous female sampled in the field measured 10. 45 mm of CL. The size of individuals at the beginning of morphological sexual maturity was estimated, using the program REGRANS, in 12. 78 and 10. 78 mm CL for males and females respectively. Males Aegla sp. n exhibit heterochely, with a preponderance of left chela laterality, while females have isoquelia. After the pubertal changes, an additional change in the level of allometry in relation to the dimensions of the chelae was detected in adult males. As a result, two groups of morphotypes in adult males, here designated as morphotype I and II were recognized according to the state of development of the chelipeds. The growth curves of the cephalothorax, estimated for males and females, are described by the following equations: Ct = 26, 57 [1 e - 0, 0064 (t+ 18, 14) e Ct = 21, 71 [1 e- 0, 008 (t+ 30, 25), respectively. Males reached larger sizes than females and showed higher growth rates than those. The estimated longevity for males was 670 days while that for females was 736 days.

A histogram of the distal widths of a large (n = 44) sample of cattle metacarpals from 15 th century Beja (Alentejo, Portugal), revealed a bimodal distribution. It was assumed that the large measurements belonged to males and the small to females. In order to rule out the possibility of a post-Moslem change in the sex ratio of cattle, a sub-sample of 21 cattle metacarpals from Beja was selected and we used genetic markers to identify the sex of the animals to which these metacarpals belonged. The ancient DNA sex of all specimens agreed with the previously assumed sex as determined osteometrically. We conclude that the two nearly separated peaks for the metacarpal distal width measurements do indeed indicate sex. A similar bimodal distribution was obtained from another large but earlier sample of cattle metacarpals from Moslem Alcáçova de Santarém (9 th– 12 th century AD). Although these have <b>not</b> been molecularly <b>sexed</b> and since osteometric sexing has now been validated, we conclude that both small (female) and large (male) peaks are smaller than the 15 th century ones and that there was an overall size increase or improvement of cattle in this region. Why the Christians improved cattle is unclear, but a selection for larger beeves for meat is one possibility as is the selection of more robust cattle for power. The spread of the quadrangular or chariot plough in Iberia is known to have occurred at this time. We then use the genetically sexed metacarpals to determine which measurements provide reasonable distinction between the sexes. Both the distal width (BFd; as already noted by Svensson et al., 2008; in Swedish medieval cattle) and the width of the lateral condyle (WCL) offer the best distinction. We also used them as a reference ‘collection’ to sex the medieval and post-medieval cattle metacarpals from Launceston Castle in England. This re-visit of the Launceston data corroborates other evidence indicating increased specialisation (milk and veal) in post-medieval cattle husbandry in England. ...|$|R
