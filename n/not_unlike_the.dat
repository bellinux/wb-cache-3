5|$|Ziphiids {{consist of}} 22 species of beaked whale. These vary from size, to coloration, to distribution, {{but they all}} share a similar hunting style. They use a suction technique, aided {{by a pair of}} grooves on the {{underside}} of their head, <b>not</b> <b>unlike</b> <b>the</b> throat pleats on the rorquals, to feed.|$|E
5|$|As the geyser fills, {{the water}} {{at the top of}} the column cools off, but because of the narrowness of the channel, {{convective}} cooling of the water in the reservoir is impossible. The cooler water above presses down on the hotter water beneath, <b>not</b> <b>unlike</b> <b>the</b> lid of a pressure cooker, allowing the water in the reservoir to become superheated, i.e. to remain liquid at temperatures well above the standard-pressure boiling point.|$|E
5|$|<b>Not</b> <b>unlike</b> <b>the</b> circuit {{riders in}} the Episcopal and Methodist traditions, the presbyteries often sent out licentiates to {{minister}} in multiple congregations that were {{spread out over}} a wide area.

5|$|One major {{challenge}} was {{the approach to}} the museum. The Japanese team proposed a winding road up the mountain, <b>not</b> <b>unlike</b> <b>the</b> approach to the NCAR building in Colorado. Instead, Pei ordered a hole cut through a nearby mountain, connected to a major road via a bridge suspended from ninety-six steel cables and supported by a post set into the mountain. The museum itself was built into the mountain, with 80percent of the building underground.|$|E

25|$|In addition, they do {{not find}} anyone {{inferior}} or superior to others {{with respect to the}} jobs they do. They neither do any menial jobs nor make others do so. In turn, they live with a mutual understanding of others <b>not</b> <b>unlike</b> <b>the</b> innocence of children.|$|E
25|$|The spatha type {{remained}} popular {{throughout the}} Migration period and {{well into the}} Middle Ages. Vendel Age spathas were decorated with Germanic artwork (<b>not</b> <b>unlike</b> <b>the</b> Germanic bracteates fashioned after Roman coins). The Viking Age saw again a more standardized production, but the basic design remained indebted to the spatha.|$|E
25|$|In {{the latter}} Vedantic period, several texts were also {{composed}} as summaries/attachments to the Upanishads. These texts collectively called as Puranas {{allowed for a}} divine and mythical interpretation of the world, <b>not</b> <b>unlike</b> <b>the</b> ancient Hellenic or Roman religions. Legends and epics with a multitude of gods and goddesses with human-like characteristics were composed.|$|E

50|$|The {{execution}} {{units were}} simplified {{relative to the}} SuperSPARC to achieve higher clock frequencies - {{an example of a}} simplification is that the ALUs were <b>not</b> cascaded, <b>unlike</b> <b>the</b> SuperSPARC, to avoid restricting clock frequency.|$|R
25|$|About {{a hundred}} elegiac lines survive from this poem on beauty {{treatments}} for women's faces, {{which seems to}} parody serious didactic poetry. The poem says that women should concern themselves first with manners and then prescribes several compounds for facial treatments before breaking off.

25|$|During the Vietnam War, the {{military}} draft (and {{the ability to}} avoid the draft by enrolling in college) contributed to increases in college attendance throughout the US. Attendance at the college increased but then fell when the draft ended in the 1970s causing financial strain <b>not</b> <b>unlike</b> <b>the</b> losing of students to the Civil War had done in the then distant past.|$|E
25|$|In Taiwan, by contrast, the Hongmen is {{not only}} legal, but {{politically}} influential; this came as no surprise, since Sun Yat-sen, founding father of the Republic of China, was a senior figure within the Hongmen, as was nationalist leader Chiang Kai-shek. Moreover, the Kuomintang, or Chinese Nationalist Party, was formed from the Xingzhonghui and Guangfuhui, groups <b>not</b> <b>unlike</b> <b>the</b> Hongmen.|$|E
50|$|Zen {{teachers}} say that taking meals with ōryōki cultivates gratitude, mindfulness, and {{better understanding of}} self. (In this regard, it is <b>not</b> <b>unlike</b> zazen.) <b>The</b> intricacies of the form may require the practitioner to pay great attention to detail.|$|R

Throughout Italy but also in the Papal States, mafia-type criminal bands threatened commerce and travellers in several regions, engaging in robbery and murder at will.|$|E
25|$|Archetypal {{pedagogy}} {{was developed}} by Clifford Mayes. Mayes' work also aims at promoting what he calls archetypal reflectivity in teachers; this {{is a means of}} encouraging teachers to examine and work with psychodynamic issues, images, and assumptions as those factors affect their pedagogical practices. More recently the Pearson-Marr Archetype Indicator (PMAI), based on Jung's theories of both archetypes and personality types, has been used for pedagogical applications (<b>not</b> <b>unlike</b> <b>the</b> Myers–Briggs Type Indicator).|$|E
25|$|Just west of {{the plains}} and into the foothills, there are {{a wide variety of}} climate types. Locations merely a few miles apart can {{experience}} entirely different weather depending on the topography. Most valleys have a semi-arid climate <b>not</b> <b>unlike</b> <b>the</b> eastern plains, which transitions to an alpine climate at the highest elevations. Microclimates also exist in local areas that run nearly the entire spectrum of climates, including subtropical highland (Cfb/Cwb), humid subtropical (Cfa), humid continental (Dfa/Dfb), Mediterranean (Csa/Csb) and subarctic (Dfc).|$|E

25|$|The {{constant}} chord wings were gimbal mounted {{to the lower}} fuselage, with pairs of streamlined compression struts from about 30% span to the upper fuselage just ahead of each cockpit.

25|$|Echomail did not {{necessarily}} use the same distribution pathways as normal netmail, and the distribution routing was stored in a separate setup file <b>not</b> <b>unlike</b> <b>the</b> original ROUTES.BBS. At the originating site a header line {{was added to the}} message indicating the origin system's name and address. After that, each system that the message traveled through added itself to a growing PATH header, as well as a SEENBY header. SEENBY prevented the message from looping around the network in the case of mis-configured routing information.|$|E

The foreman told me that stokers were selected from among the strongest, but that nevertheless they all became consumptive after {{seven or eight years}} of toil and died of pulmonary consumption. That explained the sadness and apathy in the faces and every movement of the hapless men.|$|E

50|$|The paper ball is very light. Its {{surface is}} <b>not</b> smooth, <b>unlike</b> <b>the</b> wood and rock ball, and so its {{movement}} is slightly variable. A paper ball can be blown {{into the air}} by fans and can roll up steep hills easily.|$|R
