5|$|For the Antwerp {{publisher}} Ons Volk, {{he created}} three comics, published as books without a prepublication in a <b>newspaper</b> <b>or</b> magazine. Piwo, about {{the adventures of}} a wooden horse, became his first comic album in 1943, and was followed by two sequels in 1944 and 1946. Those comics were also published in French. For the same editor, he illustrated 11 children books. In the same years, he also created the cover illustration {{for a number of}} novels from other publishers. In 1944, he also started working for two more magazines, De Rakker and De Illustratie, where he created some comics and made numerous illustrations.

In Seattle, the Post-Intelligencer made a similar offer with a $5,000 reward. The offers {{remained}} in effect until Thanksgiving 1974, and though there were several near-matches, no genuine bills were found. In 1975 Northwest Orient's insurer, Global Indemnity Co., complied with an order from the Minnesota Supreme Court and paid the airline's $180,000 claim on the ransom money.|$|E

25|$|Since journalism {{relies on}} the public trust, a reporter's failure to {{honestly}} acknowledge their sources undercuts a <b>newspaper</b> <b>or</b> television news show's integrity and undermines its credibility. Journalists accused of plagiarism are often suspended from their reporting tasks while the charges are being investigated by the news organization.|$|E

25|$|The Blackwell Company advertised Bull Durham Tobacco in an {{uncommon}} fashion for advertising of the time. One of the company’s first huge campaigns was {{the implementation of}} ads depicting the bull in magazines, trade journals, periodicals, and huge outdoor painted signs.

[...] In addition to being sold by homeless individuals, many of these papers are partially produced and written by them.|$|R

25|$|The {{final stage}} in {{publication}} involves making the product {{available to the}} public, usually by offering it for sale. In previous centuries, authors frequently also acted as their own editor, printer, and bookseller, but these functions have become separated. Once a book, <b>newspaper,</b> <b>or</b> another publication is printed, the publisher may {{use a variety of}} channels to distribute it. Books are most commonly sold through booksellers and through other retailers. Newspapers and magazines are typically sold in advance directly by the publisher to subscribers, and then distributed either through the postal system or by newspaper carriers. Periodicals are also frequently sold through newsagents and vending machines.|$|E
25|$|Avante! was {{illegally}} {{printed and}} distributed from February 1931 until May 1974. Many times, the newspaper distribution suffered breakdowns {{due to the}} suppression by the political police of party members who helped to distribute the <b>newspaper,</b> <b>or</b> due {{to the destruction of}} the clandestine printing offices. Successfully evading official censorship, Avante! was {{one of the very few}} Portuguese newspapers that freely reported on events like World War II, the Colonial War in Africa or massive workers' strikes and waves of student protest against the dictatorship. Avante! continues to be printed after more than three decades of democracy and has now a full online edition. The Avante! Festival was named after the newspaper.|$|E

25|$|The next morning, {{they drive}} to the bank to stop the transfer, evading Wesley's team, groups of Chechen and Nigerian investors to whom Ershon owes money, and police {{officers}} who are told Allen and Terry have gone rogue. They reach the bank and halt the transfer. Wesley arrives, and as a delaying tactic, shoots both officers and Ershon in their arms. Mauch finally arrives with police backup, rescuing the two and arresting Ershon for his embezzlement, and Wesley for multiple counts of murder. Ershon's arrest leads to a stock market crash and the subsequent federal bailout of Lendl Global. Terry marries Francine, and Allen reunites with his wife. The narrator (Ice-T) finishes off by stating that the true heroes are the everyday people who work to make a difference, not the ones who appear in the <b>newspaper</b> <b>or</b> on TV.|$|E
25|$|Before John Reed {{left for}} Russia, the Espionage Act was passed on June 15, 1917, which fined and imprisoned anyone who {{interfered}} with the recruiting of soldiers and prohibited the mailing of any <b>newspaper</b> <b>or</b> magazine that promoted such sentiments. The U. S. Postal Service was also given leave to deny any mailing that fitted these standards from further postal delivery, and then to disqualify a magazine because it had missed a mailing and hence, was no longer considered a regular publication. Because of this, The Masses was forced by the United States federal government to cease publication {{in the fall of}} 1917, after refusing to change the magazine's policy against the war. The Liberator, founded by Max Eastman under his and his sister's private control, published Reed's articles concerning the Russian Revolution instead. In an effort to ensure the magazine's survival, Eastman compromised and tempered its views accordingly.|$|E
25|$|The society held {{monthly meeting}} to discuss new books, share folklore, deliver presentations, debate on ways to stop Germanization. The {{meetings}} took place not only in Tilsit, but also in Memel (Klaipėda), Coadjuthen (Katyčiai), Kaukehmen (Jasnoje), Ragnit (Neman), Lasdehnen (Krasnoznamensk), Schmalleningken (Smalininkai). The number of attendees grew from a dozen to 300. However, the quality of presentations and discussions was limited by lack of education among Birutė's members, most of whom only had primary education. In {{one of the early}} meetings, Vilius Bruožis, future chairman of the society, spoke for three hours trying to prove that the Lithuanian language was spoken in the Garden of Eden. The society considered and took tentative steps to establish Lithuanian-language schools, publish books (including a history of Lithuania that would incorporate the history of Lithuania Minor), its own <b>newspaper,</b> <b>or</b> calendars, but those plans were not realized. The society considered but rejected the idea of taking over the publication of bankrupt Aušra. Instead, it financially supported (15 marks per month) the short-lived newspaper Garsas published by Jankus. In 1888, the society officially dropped book publication from its goals and reduced the number of meetings to once a quarter. In total, between 1885 and 1888, the society held about 30 meetings.|$|E
