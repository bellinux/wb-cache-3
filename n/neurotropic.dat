25|$|Exophiala dermatitidis is {{typically}} considered a human opportunistic pathogen, as those affected by E. dermatitidis often have underlying health conditions. An {{exception to this}} is the <b>neurotropic</b> clinical presentation, which {{is typically}} found in young and otherwise healthy individuals.|$|E
25|$|The {{effect of}} {{physical}} activity {{is not limited to}} vascular effects. Physical activity can give rise to new neurons in the brain, as well as releasing a substance that can protect them. The protein known as brain-derived <b>neurotropic</b> factor (BDNF) is known to be important in the development, survival and plasticity of neurons. Regular exercise can boost BDNF levels by 2-3 times.|$|E
25|$|The {{mosquito}} {{group can}} be divided into two branches: one branch contains the <b>neurotropic</b> viruses, often associated with encephalitic disease in humans or livestock. This branch tends to be spread by Culex species and to have bird reservoirs. The second branch is the non-neurotropic viruses which are associated with haemorrhagic disease in humans. These tend to have Aedes species as vectors and primate hosts.|$|E
25|$|Very {{recently}} the orphan OA1 receptor has been de-orphaned. Studies showed that L-DOPA is the specific ligand for the OA1 receptor. L-DOPA is {{a by-product of}} melanin biosynthetic pathway. During melanin synthesis, L-DOPA is released to the retina in the retinal pigment epithelium and is necessary for specific stages of retinal development. Activation of the OA1 receptor by L-DOPA leads to the secretion of a <b>neurotropic</b> factor by the retinal pigment epithelium that helps in normal retinal development.|$|E
25|$|While over 100 fungal {{species can}} cause phaeohyphomycosis, E. dermatitidis {{is one of}} the two fungi most {{frequently}} implicated, along with another Exophiala species, E. jeanselmei. Exophiala dermatitidis is considered {{to be one of the}} most pathogenic fungi in the genus Exophiala, and is highly deadly, with a fatality rate of over 40%. The high fatality rate is primarily due to an ability to form systemic and <b>neurotropic</b> infections, which represent approximately half of reported E. dermatitidis cases.|$|E
25|$|Up {{to one in}} {{four people}} {{experience}} fever, aches, and local soreness and redness {{at the site of}} injection. In rare cases (less than one in 200,000 to 300,000), the vaccination can cause yellow fever vaccineâ€“associated viscerotropic disease, which is fatal in 60% of cases. It is probably due to the genetic morphology of the immune system. Another possible side effect is an infection of the nervous system, which occurs in one in 200,000 to 300,000 cases, causing yellow fever vaccine-associated <b>neurotropic</b> disease, which can lead to meningoencephalitis and is fatal in less than 5% of cases.|$|E
25|$|The {{creation}} of artificial conduits {{is also known}} as entubulation because the nerve ends and intervening gap are enclosed within a tube composed of biological or synthetic materials. Whether the conduit {{is in the form of}} a biologic tube, synthetic tube or tissue-engineered conduit, it should facilitate <b>neurotropic</b> and neurotrophic communication between the proximal and distal ends of the nerve gap, block external inhibitory factors, and provide a physical guidance for axonal regrowth. The most basic objective of a nerve guidance conduit is to combine physical, chemical, and biological cues under conditions that will foster tissue formation.|$|E
25|$|Systemic E. dermatitidis infections {{can include}} {{cerebral}} metastases. The fatality rate for such infections {{is reported to}} be over 90%. Central nervous system phaeohyphomycosis is rare, and for unknown reasons primarily arise in East Asia, despite a cosmopolitan distribution of the fungus. Within East Asian populations, young and otherwise healthy people have developed cerebral infections. Lung infections in European CF patients and <b>neurotropic</b> mycosis in East Asia are caused by E. dermatitidis strains that are genetically similar, and host factors such as immunological differences may be responsible for the different infection patterns. Exophiala dermatitidis occurs at very high frequency in both Asian and European saunas, and absence of neurotrophic mycosis in Europe isn't explained by reduced exposure to the fungus.|$|E
25|$|On 29 May 1954, {{less than}} three years after his beatification, Pius X was canonized, {{following}} the S.C.R.'s recognition of two more miracles. The first involved Francesco Belsami, an attorney from Naples who had a pulmonary abscess, who was cured upon placing a picture of Pope Pius X upon his chest. The second miracle involved Sr. Maria Ludovica Scorcia, a nun who was afflicted with a serious <b>neurotropic</b> virus, and who, upon several novenas, was entirely cured. The canonization Mass was presided over by Pius XII at Saint Peter's Basilica before a crowd of about 800,000 of the faithful and church officials at St. Peter's Basilica. Pius X became the first pope to be canonized since Pius V in 1712.|$|E
25|$|In 1927, {{scientists}} {{isolated the}} {{yellow fever virus}} in West Africa. Following this, two vaccines were developed in the 1930s. The vaccine 17D {{was developed by the}} South African microbiologist Max Theiler at the Rockefeller Institute in New York City. This vaccine was widely used by the U.S. Army during World War II. Following the work of Ernest Goodpasture, Theiler used chicken eggs to culture the virus and won a Nobel Prize in 1951 for this achievement. A French team developed the French <b>neurotropic</b> vaccine (FNV), which was extracted from mouse brain tissue. Since this vaccine was associated with a higher incidence of encephalitis, FNV was not recommended after 1961. Vaccine 17D is still in use, and more than 400 million doses have been distributed. Little research has been done to develop new vaccines. Some researchers worry that the 60-year-old technology for vaccine production may be too slow to stop a major new yellow-fever epidemic. Newer vaccines, based on vero cells, are in development and should replace 17D at some point.|$|E
25|$|The {{difficulty}} of isolating Schwann cells and subsequently inducing proliferation {{is a large}} obstacle. A solution is to selectively induce cells such as ectomesenchymal stem cells (EMSCs) into Schwann cell-like phenotypes. EMSCs are neural crest cells that migrate from the cranical neural crest into the first branchial arch during early development of the peripheral nervous system. EMSCs are multipotent and possess a self-renewing capacity. They {{can be thought of}} as Schwann progenitor cells because they are associated with dorsal root ganglion and motor nerve development. EMSC differentiation appears to be regulated by intrinsic genetic programs and extracellular signals in the surrounding environment. Schwann cells are the source for both <b>neurotropic</b> and neurotrophic factors essential for regenerating nerves and a scaffold for guiding growth. Nie, Zhang et al. conducted a study investigating the benefits of culturing EMSCs within PLGA conduits. Adding foskolin and BPE to an EMSC culture caused the formation of elongated cell processes, which is common to Schwann cells in vitro. Thus, foskolin and BPF may induce differentiation into Schwann cell-like phenotypes. BPE contains the cytokines GDNF, basic fibroblast growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor, which cause differentiation and proliferation of glial and Schwann cells by activating MAP kinases. When implanted into the PLGA conduits, the EMSCs maintained long-term survival and promoted peripheral nerve regeneration across a 10mm gap, which usually demonstrates little to no regeneration. Myelinated axons were present within the grafts and basal laminae were formed within the myelin. These observations suggest that EMSCs may promote myelination of regenerated nerve fibers within the conduit.|$|E

500|$|Not all virus infections {{produce a}} {{protective}} immune response in this way. HIV evades the immune system by constantly changing the amino acid sequence of the proteins {{on the surface of}} the virion. This is known as [...] "escape mutation" [...] as the viral epitopes escape recognition by the host immune response. These persistent viruses evade immune control by sequestration, blockade of antigen presentation, cytokine resistance, evasion of natural killer cell activities, escape from apoptosis, and antigenic shift. Other viruses, called <b>neurotropic</b> viruses, are disseminated by neural spread where the immune system may be unable to reach them.|$|E
500|$|It {{has been}} argued that prehistoric rock art at a site known as Selva Pascuala near the Spanish town of Villar del Humo offers {{evidence}} that P.hispanica was used in religious rituals 6,000 years ago. The rock shelter at Selva Pascuala was discovered in the early 20th century; in the early 21st century it was noticed that objects in one of the murals, which [...] previously had been described as [...] "mushrooms", matched the general morphology of P.hispanica: the mural depicts a row of 13 mushroom-like objects with convex to conical caps, and ringless stems that vary from straight to sinuous (wavy). Additionally, the mural shows a bull, which suggests an association with the coprophilic P.hispanica. Although the hallucinogenic species P.semilanceata is also widespread in the area where the mural was found, its differing shape (narrowly conical and acutely papillate) and its habitat on soil instead of dung suggests it is not the species represented in the mural. If the interpretation is correct, the mural represents the oldest evidence of psychedelic fungi use in Europe, and the third reported instance of rock art suggesting prehistoric usage of <b>neurotropic</b> fungi. The only older example is from Tassili n'Ajjer, in the Sahara desert in southeast Algeria. In 1992, the Italian ethnobotanist Giorgio Samorini reported finding a painted mural dated 7000 to 9000 BCE portraying mushrooms, later tentatively identified as Psilocybe mairei, a species known from Algeria and Morocco.|$|E
2500|$|Diagnosis of MS {{has always}} been made by {{clinical}} examination, supported by MRI or CSF tests. According with both the pure autoimmune hypothesis and the immune-mediated hypothesis, researchers expect to find biomarkers able to yield a better diagnosis, and able to predict {{the response to the}} different available treatments. As of 2014 no biomarker with perfect correlation has been found, but some of them have shown a special behavior like IgG- and IgM- oligoclonal bands in the cerebrospinal fluid and autoantibodies against <b>neurotropic</b> viruses (MRZ reaction) [...] and the potassium channel Kir4.1.|$|E
2500|$|Symptoms of {{herpes simplex}} virus {{infection}} include watery blisters in the skin or mucous membranes of the mouth, lips, nose or genitals. Lesions heal with a scab characteristic of herpetic disease. Sometimes, the viruses cause very mild or atypical symptoms during outbreaks. However, they can also cause more troublesome forms of herpes simplex. As <b>neurotropic</b> and neuroinvasive viruses, HSV-1 and -2 persist in the body by becoming latent and hiding from the immune system in the cell bodies of neurons. After the initial or primary infection, some infected people experience [...] episodes of viral reactivation or outbreaks. In an outbreak, the virus in a nerve cell becomes active and is transported via the neuron's axon to the skin, where virus replication and shedding occur and cause new sores. It {{is one of the}} most common sexually transmitted infections.|$|E

50|$|<b>Neurotropic</b> {{growth factors}} {{regulate}} growth, survival, and plasticity of the axon. They benefit nerve regeneration after {{injury to the}} nervous system. They are a potent initiator of sensory axon growth and are up-regulated at the lesion site. The continuous delivery of <b>neurotropic</b> growth factor (NGF) would increase the nerve regeneration in the spinal cord. However, the excessive dosing of NGF often leads to undesired plasticity and sprouting of uninjured sensory nerves. Gene therapy {{would be able to}} increase the NGF efficacy by the controlled and sustained delivery in a site-specific manner.|$|E
50|$|Several diseases, {{including}} transmissible spongiform encephalopathy, kuru, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease {{resemble a}} slow <b>neurotropic</b> virus infection - but are, in fact, {{caused by the}} infectious proteins known as prions.|$|E
50|$|A <b>neurotropic</b> {{virus is}} said to be neuroinvasive if it is capable of {{accessing}} or entering the nervous system and neurovirulent if it is capable of causing disease within the nervous system. Both terms are often applied to central nervous system infections, although some <b>neurotropic</b> viruses are highly neuroinvasive for the peripheral nervous system (i.e. herpes simplex virus). Important neuroinvasive viruses include poliovirus, which is highly neurovirulent but weakly neuroinvasive, and rabies virus, which is highly neurovirulent but requires tissue trauma (often resulting from an animal bite) to become neuroinvasive. Using these definitions, herpes simplex virus is highly neuroinvasive for the peripheral nervous system and rarely neuroinvasive for the central nervous system, but in the latter case may cause herpesviral encephalitis and is therefore considered highly neurovirulent. Many arthropod-borne <b>neurotropic</b> viruses, like West Nile virus, spread to the brain primarily via the blood system by crossing the blood-brain barrier in what is called hematogenous dissemination.|$|E
50|$|<b>Neurotropic</b> viruses are {{increasingly}} being exploited as research tools, and for their potential use in treatment. In particular, they {{are being used to}} improve the understanding of the nervous systems circuits.|$|E
