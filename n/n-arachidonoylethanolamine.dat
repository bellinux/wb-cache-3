5000|$|Anandamide, {{also known}} as <b>N-arachidonoylethanolamine</b> or AEA, is a fatty acid {{neurotransmitter}} derived from the non-oxidative metabolism of eicosatetraenoic acid (arachidonic acid) an essential ω-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid. The name is taken from the Sanskrit & Pāli word ananda, which means [...] "joy, bliss, delight", and amide. It is synthesized from N-arachidonoyl phosphatidylethanolamine by multiple pathways. It is degraded primarily by the fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) enzyme, which converts anandamide into ethanolamine and arachidonic acid. As such, inhibitors of FAAH lead to elevated anandamide levels and are being pursued for therapeutic use.|$|E

In nominally Ca 2 +-free media, these compounds exerted a weak protonophoric effect manifested by dissipation of the transmembrane potential and stimulation of resting state respiration. The strongest action was exhibited by <b>N-arachidonoylethanolamine,</b> followed by N-oleoylethanolamine, whereas N-palmitoylethanolamine was almost inactive. These protonophoric effects were resistant to cyclosporin A (CsA) and were much weaker {{than those of}} corresponding nonesterified fatty acids. In uncoupled mitochondria <b>N-arachidonoylethanolamine</b> and N-oleoylethanolamine partly inhibited mitochondrial respiration with glutamate and succinate but not with tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine (TMPD) plus ascorbate as respiratory substrates. In mitochondria preloaded with small amounts of Ca 2 +, NAEs produced a much stronger dissipation of the membrane potential and a release of accumulated calcium, both effects being inhibited by CsA, indicative for opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP). Again, the potency of this action was N-arachidonoylethanolamine>N-oleoylethanolamine>N-palmitoylethanolamine. However, in spite of making the matrix space accessible to external [14 C]sucrose, <b>N-arachidonoylethanolamine</b> and N-oleoylethanolamine resulted in only a limited swelling of mitochondria and diminished the rate of swelling produced by high Ca 2 + load...|$|E

The data also indicated that plasma and tissues levels of all three N-acylethanolamines fluctuate throughout pregnancy. Tissue levels of endocannabinoids did not correlate with plasma, suggesting that during pregnancy, maternal tissue levels of endocannabinoids are primarily regulated by in situ production and degradation to create endocannabinoid gradients conducive to successful pregnancy. 1777...|$|E

One lesser-known property of COX- 2 is its ability to metabolize the endocannabinoids, <b>N-arachidonoylethanolamine</b> (AEA) and 2 -arachidonoylglycerol (2 -AG). Endocannabinoid metabolism by COX- 2 is not merely a means to terminate their actions.

Lymphocytes have also a specific ARA transporter and a functional CB 1 cannabinoid receptor, which were not modulated by LPS. The effect of this endotoxin on FAAH was not mediated by AEA-induced activation of cannabinoid receptors. Conversely, the stimulatory action of LPS on AEA levels might be due to inhibition of FAAH, as suggested by the observation that an increase of AFA amounts was also induced by an irreversible FAAH inhibitor.

The aim of the present work was to investigate in more detail the mechanism of the inhibitory effects of NAEs on the respiratory chain. In connection with this, we also investigated a possible action of NAEs on the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by respiring rat heart mitochondria.

Saturated N-palmitoylethanolamine had a much smaller effect compared to unsaturated NAEs. N-Ara and N-Ole were found to decrease ROS formation, apparently due to their uncoupling action. However, under specific conditions, N-Ara slightly but significantly stimulated ROS generation in uncoupled conditions, probably due to its inhibitory effect on complex I.

In particular, eCBs are important regulators in blood, where they modulate haematopoiesis, platelet aggregation and apoptosis, as well as chemokine release and migration of immunocompetent cells. Here, we shall review the current knowledge on the pathophysiological roles of eCBs in blood. We shall also discuss the involvement of eCBs in those disorders affecting the haematological system, including cancer and inflammation. Knowledge gained to date underlines a fundamental role of the eCB system in blood, thus suggesting that it may represent a therapeutic promise for a broad range of diseases involving impaired hematopoietic cell functions...|$|E
40|$|Endocannabinoids (ECs) are {{endogenous}} {{compounds that}} interact with type- 1 and type- 2 cannabinoid receptors (CB 1 and CB 2), {{as well as}} non-cannabinoid receptors. The multitude of roles attributed to ECs makes them an emerging target of pharmacotherapy {{for a number of}} disparate diseases. Here a high-throughput bioanalytical method based on micro SPE (μ-SPE) followed by LC-MS/MS analysis for the simultaneous determination of the two major endocannabinoids 2 -arachidonoylglycerol (2 -AG) and <b>N-arachidonoylethanolamine</b> (anandamide, AEA) in human plasma is presented. The chromatographic conditions obtained with the fused-core column allowed a good separation in 10 min also of the AG isomers. A very simple and reliable extraction has been optimised by means of C 18 -modified tips: it requires only 100 μL of plasma and allows the use of minimal volumes of organic solvent. The present method allows a rapid and effective clean-up, which also minimises the isomerisation of 2 -AG. The whole procedure has been validated following the FDA guidelines for bioanalytical methods validation: the satisfactory recovery values, the negligible matrix effect and the good values of accuracy and reproducibility make it a simple and high-throughput analytical tool for clinical and biochemical studies on endocannabinoid signaling in humans...|$|E
40|$|A radiochromatographic {{method has}} been set up to assay the {{activity}} of N-acyl-phosphatidylethanolamine-specific phospholipase D (NAPE-PLD), based on reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and online scintillation counting. The anandamide (<b>N-arachidonoylethanolamine,</b> AEA), product released by NAPE-PLD from the N-arachidonoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine (NArPE) Substrate, was separated using a 08 column eluted with methanol-water-acetic acid and was quantified with an external standard method. Baseline separation of AEA and NArPE was completed in less than 15 min, with a detection limit of 0. 5 fmol AEA at a signal-to-noise ratio of 4 : 1. The sensitivity and accuracy of the radiochromatographic procedure allowed detection and characterization of NAPE-PLD activity in very tiny tissue samples or in samples where the enzymatic activity is very low. With this method, we could determine the kinetic constants (i. e., apparent Michaelis-Menten constant (K-m) of 40. 0 +/- 5. 6 mu M and maximum velocity (V-max) of 22. 2 +/- 3. 5 pmol/min per milligram protein toward NArPE) and the distribution of NAPE-PLD activity in brain areas and peripheral tissues of mouse. In addition, we could collect unprecedented evidence that compounds widely used in studies of the endocannabinoid system (e. g., AEA and congeners, receptor a(nta) gonists and inhibitors of AEA degradation) can also affect NAPE-PLD activity.

40|$|The endocannabinoid {{system and}} endocannabinoid receptor-driven {{modulation}} of glutamate release were studied in rat brain cortex astroglial gliosomes. These preparations contained the endocannabinoids <b>N-arachidonoylethanolamine</b> (anandamide) and 2 -arachidonoylglycerol, as well their major biosynthetic (N-acyl-phosphatidylethanolamines-hydrolyzing-phospholipase D and diacylglycerol-lipase) and catabolic (fatty acid amide-hydrolase and monoacylglycerol-lipase) enzymes. Gliosomes expressed type- 1 (CB 1 R), type- 2 (CB 2 R) cannabinoid, and type- 1 vanilloid (TRPV 1) receptors, as ascertained by Western blotting and confocal microscopy. Methanandamide, a stable analogue of anandamide acting as CB 1 R, CB 2 R, and TRPV 1 agonist, stimulated or inhibited the depolarization-evoked gliosomal [(3) H]D: -aspartate release, at lower and higher concentrations, respectively. Experiments with ACEA (arachidonyl- 2 '-chloroethylamide), JWH 133 ((6 aR, 10 aR) - 3 -(1, 1 -dimethylbutyl) - 6 a, 7, 10, 10 a-tetrahydro- 6, 6, 9 -trimethyl- 6 H-dibenzo[b,d]-pyran) and capsaicin, selective agonists at CB 1 R, CB 2 R and TRPV 1, respectively, demonstrated that potentiation of [(3) H]D: -aspartate release {{was due to}} CB 1 R while inhibition to CB 2 R and TRPV 1 engagement. These findings were confirmed by using selective receptor antagonists. Furthermore, CB 1 R activation caused increase of intracellular IP 3 and Ca(2 +) concentration, suggesting an involvement of phospholipase C...|$|E
