25|$|The <b>northern</b> <b>two-lined</b> <b>{{salamander}}</b> (Eurycea bislineata) is {{a species}} of salamander in the family Plethodontidae found in Canada and the United States.

25|$|Upon hatching, the gilled larva {{are about}} 10mm long, {{and remain in}} slow-moving pools, or less frequently, hiding in crevices between rocks and {{boulders}} in swift-flowing streams. The larvae do not begin feeding until their yolk sacs are reabsorbed, at which point they begin to feed on benthic invertebrates by prowling {{the bottom of the}} stream. Typical prey items for <b>northern</b> <b>two-lined</b> <b>salamander</b> larvae include chironomid larvae and other dipteran larvae, stonefly larvae, cladocera, and copepods. Predators of the larvae are many, such as fish, crayfish, and other salamander larvae, such as the larger northern spring salamander (Gyrinophilus porphyriticus). The larval period of E. bislineata is variable depending on latitude. In the southern portion of their range, such as New York, metamorphosis occurs at 50mm total length or two years old, while further north, such as in Quebec and likely Ontario, metamorphosis takes place at nearly 70mm total length, or three years old. The larvae over-winter in deeper pools not prone to freezing.|$|E
25|$|The {{reproductive}} {{strategy of}} the <b>northern</b> <b>two-lined</b> <b>salamander</b> begins with an elaborate courtship. It may take place from September (in the southern parts of its range) to May (in the north). Observations of courtship in the species were made based on individuals held in captivity by Noble (1929), and a summary of these observations are: the male becomes restless, as if searching for a female. Upon finding the female, he will lift her by pushing his snout under her cloacal region or chest. The male adopts a distinct posture, bending his body laterally around her snout. The pair may remain in this position {{for an hour or}} more. The female eventually slips out of this posture and begins to straddle the male's tail with her fore limbs, while pressing her chin against the base of the male's tail. The male may undulate his tail from side to side in a slow and exaggerated manner, and the female moves her head from side to side, alternately from the male’s tail. This tail-straddling walk may last for over an hour, at which point the male deposits a spermatophore, leading the female to walk over it, at which time she may either accept or reject the male’s sperm. The spermatophore of this species is described as conical, 2.5mm in height and with a colorless stalk that tapers towards the tip.|$|E

40|$|As {{urbanization}} increases {{across the}} globe, more ecologists have taken note of its consequences to stream systems. Sufficient data {{have been collected}} to document repeated patterns in urbanized streams for many abiotic parameters, aquatic insects, and fish. For example, {{we now know that}} urbanized streams experience more frequent and intense spates as a result of increased runoff form impervious surfaces in the urban watershed. The spates eventually lead to a more incised and wider stream bed. Such abiotic shifts consistently result in decreased aquatic invertebrate and fish diversity. More recently, stream-breeding salamanders have been observed to decrease in density in urban areas. We monitored the density of southern <b>two-lined</b> <b>salamanders</b> for the duration of two cohorts in 12 streams in western Georgia, USA. We then used path analysis to determine the relationships between land-use change, abiotic shifts in the stream environment, and larval salamander density. |$|R
40|$|We {{found that}} {{southern}} <b>two-lined</b> <b>salamanders</b> in the streams we monitored exhibited {{no change in}} reproductive output between urban and reference habitats. However, repeated sampling throughout the larval period revealed a large decline in density of larvae in urban areas prior to metamorphosis, while a similar decline was not seen in reference habitats. We evaluated several hypotheses that might explain the observed decline in urban areas, and a model in which increased impervious surface causes an increase in spate frequency and magnitude, which then leads to decreased larval density had the most support. This is the first attempt to compare multiple plausible hypotheses as to why salamander density and diversity decreases in urban habitats. By describing larval density {{at the beginning and}} end of the larval period, and by identifying a likely mechanism for the observed decline in density, species-specific and stream restoration efforts can be enhanced. |$|R

40|$|Abstract Forested {{riparian}} buffers are {{an increasingly}} common method of mitigating {{the negative effects}} of impervious surface cover on water quality and wildlife habitat. We sampled larval southern <b>two-lined</b> <b>salamanders</b> (Eurycea cirrigera) in 43 streams, representing the range of impervious surface cover and forested riparian buffer width across Wake County, NC, USA. Larval abundance decreased with increasing impervious surface cover in the upstream catchment, but was not affected by buffer width. This is likely a result of an incomplete buffer system and culverts or other breaches along streams. Larval abundance increased with detritus cover in the stream to a threshold and then decreased as detritus continued to increase. As percent pebble substrate in the stream increased, especially in perennial streams, larval salamander abundance also increased. We suspect salamanders were unable to migrate with the water column during dry periods in intermittent streams with sedimented interstices below the surface, resulting in low abundances. A combination of increased peak flows and sedimentation, reduced base flow, and chemical changes likely reduces the abundance of salamanders in urban and suburban streams. We suggest creation of catchment-wide, unbreached buffers to maintain the integrity of stream habitats in urbanizing watersheds...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. —The Southern <b>Two-lined</b> <b>Salamander,</b> Eurycea cirrigera, {{typically}} inhabits {{the margins}} of small, rocky streams,springs, and seeps in forested areas. The species is found only occasionally in subterranean habitats and, consequently, isconsidered a cave visitor (accidental or trogloxene). However, we discovered egg clutches in the deep cave zone of asubterranean stream during January and February 2005, indicating that some individuals are adapted to reproduce in caves. Eggs were attached singly to form monolayer masses on the undersurfaces of submerged rocks; females were found attendingthree of nine clutches. We determined {{the total number of}} eggs/clutch, mass surface area, egg and embryo size, and stage ofdevelopment using digital images of each clutch. Embryo length correlated positively with developmental stage. Duration ofembryonic period ranged from 35 - 42 days; consequently, eggs were laid from early to mid-January and larvae hatched fromlate February to early March. Adult males and females migrated into the cave to breed during late autumn. Males exited thecave after mating; whereas, females brooded their eggs and exited the cave only after eggs hatched. Larvae drifteddownstream and out of the cave following heavy winter and early spring rains. Reproduction of this population is relativelyearly compared to epigean populations and may be associated with the stable aquatic cave environment...|$|R
40|$|Physical {{barriers}} {{are known to}} limit species' ranges, but, {{in the absence of}} physical barriers, what prevents adaptation and expansion at the periphery? Genetic influence from central populations may prevent adaptation to ecological barriers by swamping peripheral populations with suboptimal genes. If this is the case, then isolation may enable local adaptation and further range expansion. Barriers such as rivers provide ideal tests of the influence of gene flow and may explain differences in range sizes. This study investigates northern range limitations and phylogeography of the <b>Northern</b> <b>Two-lined</b> (Eurycea bislineata) and Northern Dusky (Desmognathus fuscus) stream salamanders. Phylogeographic patterns of populations throughout Quebec and Labrador were investigated by sequencing portions of cytochrome b and 12 S rRNA mitochondrial DNA genes. Interpopulation divergence was low for both species, however, unique genetic haplotypes and morphological variation on the north shore of the St. Lawrence indicate that the river is acting as a barrier to gene flow...|$|R
