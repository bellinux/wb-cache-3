25|$|A fan heater, {{also called}} a forced {{convection}} heater, is {{a variety of}} convection heater that includes an electric fan {{to speed up the}} airflow.

25|$|In industry, thermal {{analyses}} are often {{ignored in the}} design process or performed too latenbsp&—nbsp&when design changes are limited and become too costly. Of the three methods mentioned in this article, theoretical and numerical methods {{can be used to}} determine an estimate of the heat sink or component temperatures of products before a physical model has been made. A theoretical model is normally used as a first order estimate. Online heat sink calculators can provide a reasonable estimate of forced and <b>natural</b> <b>convection</b> heat sink performance based on a combination of theoretical and empirically derived correlations. Numerical methods or computational fluid dynamics (CFD) provide a qualitative (and sometimes even quantitative) prediction of fluid flows. What this means is that it will give a visual or post-processed result of a simulation, like the images in figures 16 and 17, and the CFD animations in figure 18 and 19, but the quantitative or absolute accuracy of the result is sensitive to the inclusion and accuracy of the appropriate parameters.|$|E
2500|$|Thermal contact {{resistance}} occurs {{due to the}} voids created by surface roughness effects, defects and misalignment of the interface. The voids present in the interface are filled with air. Heat transfer is therefore due to conduction across the actual contact area and to conduction (or <b>natural</b> <b>convection)</b> and radiation across the gaps. If the contact area is small, {{as it is for}} rough surfaces, the major contribution to the resistance is made by the gaps. To decrease the thermal {{contact resistance}}, the surface roughness can be decreased while the interface pressure is increased.

40|$|The {{fluid flow}} and heat {{transfer}} problems encountered in industry applications span into different scales {{and there are}} different numerical methods for different scales problems. Multiscale methods are needed to solve problems involving multiple scales. In this dissertation, multiscale methods are developed by combining various single scale numerical methods, including lattice Boltzmann method (LBM), finite volume method (FVM) and Monte Carlo method. Two strategies exist in combing these numerical methods. For the first one, the whole domain is divided into multiple subdomains and different domains use various numerical methods. Message passing among subdomains decides the accuracy {{of this type of}} multiscale numerical method. For the second one, various parameters are solved with different numerical methods. These two types of multiscale methods are both discussed in this dissertation. In Chapters 3 and 4, the whole domain is divided into two subdomains and they are solved with LBM and FVM respectively. This LBM-FVM hybrid method is verified with lid driven flows and <b>natural</b> <b>convections.</b> In Chapter 5, a LBM-FVM hybrid method is proposed to take both advantages of LBM and FVM: velocity field and temperature file are solved with LBM and FVM respectively. MCM has advantages in solving radiative heat transfer, and LBM-MCM hybrid method is proposed in Chapter 6. Numerical investigation for melting problems are carried on in this dissertation. The key point in solving the melting problem is how to obtain the interface location. To overcome the disadvantages in the now existing numerical methods, an interfacial tracking method is advanced to calculate the interface location. In Chapter 7, low Prandtl fluid <b>natural</b> <b>convections</b> are solved with LBM to discuss the oscillation results. Based on these results, low Prandtl number melting problems are solved using LBM with interfacial tracking method in Chapter 8. High Prandtl number melting problems in a discrete heated enclosure are solved using FVM with interfacial tracking method in Chapter 9. To take both advantages of LBM and FVM, melting problems are solved with LBM-FVM hybrid method in chapter 10, while interfacial tracking method is advanced by porous media assumptions in fluid flow field simulation process. Problems in Chapters 3 - 10 are all in two-dimensional and three-dimensional problems are more general than them in the realistic applications. Double LBM-MRT model for three-dimensional fluid flow and heat transfer is proposed and three types of <b>natural</b> <b>convections</b> in a cubic cavity are discussed in Chapter 11. For the first two types of cubic <b>natural</b> <b>convections,</b> the present results agreed very well with the benchmark solutions or experimental results in the literature. The results from the third type exhibited more general three-dimensional characters. Three-dimensional melting problems are solved with the proposed double LBM-MRT model with interfacial tracking method in Chapter 12. Numerical results in three conduction melting problems agree with the analytical results well. Taking Chapter 11 results in consideration, the double LBM-MRT model with interfacial tracking method is valid to solve three-dimensional conduction or convection controlled melting problems. Two convection melting problems in a cubic cavity are also solved. With a lower Rayleigh number, the convection effects are weaker; side wall effects are smaller; melting process carries on slower...|$|R

2500|$|A {{trickling}} filter {{consists of a}} bed of rocks, gravel, slag, peat moss, or plastic media over which wastewater flows [...] downward and contacts a layer (or film) of microbial slime covering the bed media. [...] conditions are maintained [...] by forced air flowing through the bed or by <b>natural</b> <b>convection</b> of air. The process involves adsorption of organic compounds in the wastewater by the microbial slime layer, diffusion of air into the slime layer to provide the oxygen required for the biochemical oxidation of the organic compounds. The end products include carbon dioxide gas, water and other products of the oxidation. As the slime layer thickens, it becomes difficult for the air to penetrate the layer and an inner anaerobic layer is formed.|$|E

(The term battery refers to the long-life, factory-fabricated core, not to any provision for electrochemical energy conversion.) The fuel is metal or nitride-based containing fertile uranium and transuranics. The LFR is cooled by <b>natural</b> <b>convection</b> with a reactor outlet coolant temperature of 550°C, possibly ranging up to 800°C with advanced materials.

2500|$|Cooling towers {{constructed}} {{in whole or}} in part of combustible materials can support internal fire propagation.

[...] The resulting damage can be sufficiently severe to require the replacement of the entire cell or tower structure. For this reason, some codes and standards recommend that combustible cooling towers be provided with an automatic fire sprinkler system. Fires can propagate internally within the tower structure when the cell is not in operation (such as for maintenance or construction), and even while the tower is in operation, especially those of the induced-draft type, because of the existence of relatively dry areas within the towers.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the year}} 2000, {{experiments}} by NASA confirmed that gravity plays an indirect role in flame formation and composition. The common distribution of a flame under normal gravity conditions depends on convection, as soot tends {{to rise to}} the top of a flame (such as in a candle in normal gravity conditions), making it yellow. In microgravity or zero gravity environment, such as in orbit, <b>natural</b> <b>convection</b> no longer occurs and the flame becomes spherical, with a tendency to become bluer and more efficient. There are several possible explanations for this difference, of which the most likely is the hypothesis that the temperature is sufficiently evenly distributed that soot is not formed and complete combustion occurs. Experiments by NASA reveal that diffusion flames in microgravity allow more soot to be completely oxidized after they are produced than do diffusion flames on Earth, because of a series of mechanisms that behave differently in microgravity when compared to normal gravity conditions.

50|$|<b>Natural</b> <b>convection</b> is a mechanism, or type of heat transport, {{in which}} the fluid motion is not {{generated}} by any external source (like a pump, fan, suction device, etc.) but only by density differences in the fluid occurring due to temperature gradients. In <b>natural</b> <b>convection,</b> fluid surrounding a heat source receives heat, becomes less dense and rises. The surrounding, cooler fluid then moves to replace it. This cooler fluid is then heated and the process continues, forming a convection current; this process transfers heat energy {{from the bottom of}} the convection cell to top. The driving force for <b>natural</b> <b>convection</b> is buoyancy, a result of differences in fluid density. Because of this, the presence of a proper acceleration such as arises from resistance to gravity, or an equivalent force (arising from acceleration, centrifugal force or Coriolis effect), is essential for <b>natural</b> <b>convection.</b> For example, <b>natural</b> <b>convection</b> essentially does not operate in free-fall (inertial) environments, such as that of the orbiting International Space Station, where other heat transfer mechanisms are required to prevent electronic components from overheating.|$|E
