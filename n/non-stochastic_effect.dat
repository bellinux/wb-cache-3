40|$|Except for {{infectious}} diseases all the main occupational hazards affecting health workers are reviewed: accidents (explosions, fires, electrical accidents, {{and other sources}} of injury); radiation (stochastic and <b>non-stochastic</b> <b>effects,</b> protective measures, and personnel most at risk); exposure to noxious chemicals, whose effects may be either local (allergic eczema) or generalised (cancer, mutations), particular attention being paid to the hazards presented by formol, ethylene oxide, cytostatics, and anaesthetic gases; drug addiction (which is more common among health workers than the general population) and psychic problems associated with promotion, shift work, and emotional stress; and assault (various types of assault suffered by health workers, its causes, and the characterisation of the most aggressive patients) ...|$|R
50|$|In Greece, {{following}} the accident there was panic and false rumors {{which led to}} many obstetricians initially thinking it prudent to interrupt otherwise wanted pregnancies and/or were unable to resist requests from worried pregnant mothers over fears of radiation, {{within a few weeks}} misconceptions within the medical profession were largely cleared up, although worries persisted in the general population. Although it was determined that the effective dose to Greeks would not exceed 1 mSv (0.1 rem), a dose much lower than that which could induce embryonic abnormalities or other <b>non-stochastic</b> <b>effects,</b> there was an observed 2500 excess of otherwise wanted pregnancies being terminated, probably out of fear in the mother of some kind of perceived radiation risk.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The use of {{ionizing}} radiation in diagnostic medical imaging procedures {{has been found}} to aid in the diagnosis of diseases. However, the associated risks due to stochastic and <b>non-stochastic</b> <b>effects</b> make it necessary to protect patients from potential harm. It is therefore important for the referring medical doctor to acquire appropriate and accurate knowledge on the risks and benefits of {{ionizing radiation}}. This knowledge could be acquired at the undergraduate level of medical school training. This study explored and described the knowledge of final year Zambian medical students on the use of ionizing radiation, the associated risks thereof and their readiness to justify and prescribe imaging procedures once qualified. A convenient non-probability sampling technique was used in which all final year medical students were invited to participate. Data was collected using a structured questionnaire and analysed using the Statistical Product and Service Solutions version 20. 0 in the form of descriptive and inferential statistics. A total of 58 final year medical students participated in the study and the results indicated that 48 (83 %) were male and 10 (17 %) were female. Twenty-four (41. 4 %) participants did not know what ionizing radiation is associated with in terms of the different types of electromagnetic radiation. Fifty-one (91. 4 %) participants did not understand the meaning of stochastic and <b>non-stochastic</b> <b>effects</b> and only five (8. 6 %) participants understood the meaning of these terms. A high number of participants (81. 0 %) responded that knowing radiation doses to the patient when referring patients for diagnostic imaging procedures was very important, 46 (79. 3 %) participants noted that it was a necessity to consider radiation exposure when referring patients. Forty-five (77. 6 %) participants responded that they were not aware of any laws governing ionizing radiation in Zambia. The results implied that despite the high risks {{associated with the use of}} ionizing radiation, the knowledge levels of the medical students was insufficient. Therefore a model of referral imaging guidelines was developed as a proposal to minimize the knowledge gap. It is suggested that apart from incorporating these guidelines in the medical curriculum, the syllabus should be revised and a course on radiation [...] . M. Tech. (Radiography...|$|R
5000|$|Following the accident, journalists mistrusted many medical {{professionals}} (such as the spokesman from the UK National Radiological Protection Board), {{and in turn}} encouraged the public to mistrust them. Throughout the European continent, due to this media-driven framing of the slight contamination and in nations where abortion is legal, many requests for induced abortions, of otherwise normal pregnancies, were obtained out of fears of radiation from Chernobyl, including an excess number of abortions in Denmark {{in the months following}} the accident. In Greece, following the accident many obstetricians were unable to resist requests from worried pregnant mothers over fears of radiation. Although it was determined that the effective dose to Greeks would not exceed 1 mSv (100 mrem), a dose much lower than that which could induce embryonic abnormalities or other <b>non-stochastic</b> <b>effects,</b> there was an observed 2500 excess of otherwise wanted pregnancies being terminated, probably out of fear in the mother of radiation risk. A [...] "slightly" [...] above the expected number of requested induced abortions occurred in Italy.|$|R
40|$|In 2011, the International Commission on Radiological Protection {{issued a}} {{statement}} on tissue reactions (formerly termed <b>non-stochastic</b> or deterministic <b>effects)</b> to recommend lowering the threshold for cataracts and the occupational equivalent dose limit for the crystalline lens of the eye. Furthermore, this statement {{was the first to}} list circulatory disease (cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease) as a health hazard of radiation exposure and to assign its threshold for the heart and brain. These changes have stimulated various discussions and may have impacts on some radiation workers, such as those in the medical sector. This paper considers emerging issues associated with cataracts and cardiovascular disease. For cataracts, topics dealt with herein include (i) the progressive nature, stochastic nature, target cells and trigger events of lens opacification, (ii) roles of lens protein denaturation, oxidative stress, calcium ions, tumor suppressors and DNA repair factors in cataractogenesis, (iii) dose rate effect, radiation weighting factor, and classification systems for cataracts, an...|$|R
40|$|Line-edge {{roughness}} (LER) and {{the related}} effect of contact size variation remain as significant challenges facing the commercialization of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography. LER is typically viewed as a resist problem; however, recent simulation results {{have shown that the}} mask can indeed be an important contributor. Problems arise from both mask absorber LER as well as mask multilayer roughness leading to random phase variations in the reflected beam (see Fig. 1). The latter effect is especially important as higher coherence off-axis illumination conditions are used and defocus is considered. Here we describe these effect in detail and explore how they will impact EUV mask requirements for the 22 -nm half-pitch node and beyond. Figure 2 shows modeling results for 22 -nm lines printed in a 0. 32 -numerical aperture system with 100 -nm defocus assuming a mask with 0. 24 -nm rms multilayer roughness and no absorber edge roughness (unlike the example in Fig. 1). The impact of the phase roughness on the printed line-edge roughness is clearly evident and demonstrates the basic problem with mask roughness. The more detailed modeling-based analysis to be presented will account for performance throughout the process window as well as <b>non-stochastic</b> resist <b>effects.</b> We note that the mean-field resist effect is important to consider because, in practice, the resist is the limiting resolution element in the system and therefore dominates the mask-error enhancement factor (MEEF). As is typically the case with projection-optic-induced MEEF, the resist-induced MEEF will lead to even tighter mask requirements. Note that we do not consider resist stochastic effects since {{the purpose of this study}} is isolate mask-induced sources of image-plane roughness...|$|R
40|$|Radiation {{exposure}} causes {{cancer and}} non-cancer health effects, {{each of which}} differs greatly {{in the shape of}} the doseâ€“response curve, latency, persistency, recurrence, curability, fatality and impact on quality of life. In recent decades, for dose limitation purposes, the International Commission on Radiological Protection has divided such diverse effects into tissue reactions (formerly termed <b>non-stochastic</b> and deterministic <b>effects)</b> and stochastic effects. On the one hand, effective dose limits aim to reduce the risks of stochastic effects (cancer/heritable effects) and are based on the detriment-adjusted nominal risk coefficients, assuming a linear-non-threshold dose response and a dose and dose rate effectiveness factor of 2. On the other hand, equivalent dose limits aim to avoid tissue reactions (vision-impairing cataracts and cosmetically unacceptable non-cancer skin changes) and are based on a threshold dose. However, the boundary between these two categories is be-coming vague. Thus, we review the changes in radiation effect classification, dose limitation concepts, and the definition of detriment and threshold. Then, the current situation is overviewed focusing on (i) stochastic effects with a threshold, (ii) tissue reactions without a threshold, (iii) target organs/tissues for circulatory disease, (iv) dose levels for limitation of cancer risks vs prevention of non-life-threatening tissue reactions vs prevention of life-threatening tissue reactions, (v) mortality or incidence of thyroid cancer, and (vi) the detri-ment for tissue reactions. For future discussion, one approach is suggested that classifies radiation effects according to whether effects are life threatening, and radiobiological research needs are also briefly discussed...|$|R
