5|$|Cabral {{was later}} passed over, {{possibly}} {{as a result}} of a quarrel with Manuel I, when a new fleet was assembled to establish a more robust presence in India. Having lost favor with the King, he retired to a private life of which few records survive. His accomplishments slipped mostly into obscurity for more than 300 years. Decades after Brazil's independence from Portugal in the 19th century, Cabral's reputation began to be rehabilitated by Emperor Pedro II of Brazil. Historians have long argued whether Cabral was Brazil's discoverer, and whether the discovery was accidental or intentional. The first question has been settled by the observation that the few, cursory encounters by explorers before him were barely noticed at the time and contributed <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> future development and history of the land which would become Brazil, the sole Portuguese-speaking nation in the Americas. On the second question, no definite consensus has been formed, and the intentional discovery hypothesis lacks solid proof. Nevertheless, although he was overshadowed by contemporary explorers, Cabral today is regarded as a major figure of the Age of Discovery.|$|E
5|$|In 1969 {{the large}} Allied Breweries combine {{initiated}} a {{hostile takeover bid}} for Boddingtons, which valued the company at £5million. Charles Boddington took {{the unusual step of}} issuing a spirited defence of the company to the shareholders: You will be only too aware that present-day pressures bear heavily towards the elimination of individuality and character in many consumer goods. There is an inexorable progression towards the mass-produced nationwide product of standardised quality. You, however, are still, at this moment in time, a shareholder in one of the remaining independent brewery companies whose traditional draught beers have a reputation for quality and individual character beyond the immediate area of the North of England in which we operate... The takeover of Boddingtons and its consequent elimination can achieve very little. It will do nothing for the national economy, add <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> nation's exports, and contribute nothing at all to the quality of life that we are all used to enjoy.|$|E

25|$|The {{book does}} not name its author. It is {{traditionally}} {{ascribed to the}} prophet Samuel, but Ruth's identity as a non-Israelite and the stress {{on the need for}} an inclusive attitude towards foreigners suggests an origin in the fifth century BCE, when intermarriage had become controversial (as seen in Ezra 9:1 and Nehemiah 13:1). A substantial number of scholars therefore date it to the Persian period (6th–4th centuries BC). The genealogy that concludes the book is believed to be a post-exilic Priestly addition, as it adds <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> plot; nevertheless, it is carefully crafted and integrates the book into the history of Israel running from Genesis to Kings.|$|E
25|$|The trust game, an {{extension}} of the dictator game, provides additional evidence for strong reciprocity. The trust game extends the dictator game by multiplying the amount given by the allocator to the recipient by some value greater than one, and then allowing the recipient to give some amount back to the allocator. Once again in this case, if participants are trying to maximize their payoff, recipient should give nothing back to the allocator, and the allocator should assign <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> recipient. A 2009 meta analysis of 84 trust game studies revealed that the allocator gave an average of 51% and that the receiver returned an average of 37%.|$|E

25|$|Initially, Buddhism in China faced {{a number}} of {{difficulties}} in becoming established. The concept of monasticism and the aversion to social affairs seemed to contradict the long-established norms and standards established in Chinese society. Some even declared that Buddhism was harmful {{to the authority of}} the state, that Buddhist monasteries contributed <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> economic prosperity of China, that Buddhism was barbaric and undeserving of Chinese cultural traditions. However, Buddhism was often associated with Daoism in its ascetic meditative tradition, and for this reason a concept-matching system was used by some early Indian translators, to adapt native Buddhist ideas onto Daoist ideas and terminology.|$|E
25|$|One {{experimental}} game used {{to measure}} levels of cooperation is the dictator game. In the standard form of the dictator game, there are two anonymous unrelated participants. One participant is assigned {{the role of the}} allocator and the other the role of the recipient. The allocator is assigned some amount of money, which they can divide in any way they choose. If a participant is trying to maximize their payoff, the rational solution (nash equilibrium) for the allocator to assign <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> recipient. In a 2011 meta study of 616 dictator game studies, Engel found an average allocation of 28.3%, with 36% of participants giving nothing, 17% choosing the equal split, and 5.44% give the recipient everything.|$|E
25|$|The {{overwhelming}} {{attention paid}} to foreign policy alienated the agricultural community in Italy which had been in decline since 1873. Both radical and conservative forces in the Italian parliament demanded that the government investigate how to improve agriculture in Italy. The investigation, which started in 1877 and was released eight years later, showed that agriculture was not improving, that landowners were earning revenue from their lands and contributing almost <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> development of the land. Lower class Italians were hurt by the break-up of communal lands {{to the benefit of}} landlords. Most of the workers on the agricultural lands were not peasants, but short-term laborers ("braccianti") who at best were employed for one year. Peasants without stable income were forced to live off of meager food supplies, disease was spreading rapidly and plagues were reported, including a major cholera epidemic which killed at least 55,000 people.|$|E

25|$|Australia took firm {{control of}} the match {{on the second day}} after a strong {{performance}} with both ball and bat. England crumbled from their strong overnight position to 342 all out, losing their last seven wickets for just 47 runs. Mark Butcher was caught behind off Jason Gillespie having added <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> overnight total, and England's tail was quickly dismissed by Gillespie (who finished with 4 for 78) and Warne (4 for 93). The English bowlers were next to suffer as the Australians advanced to 247 for 2 at stumps with Ricky Ponting undefeated overnight on 83. Matthew Hoggard and Andy Caddick were both smashed around the field and it was left to Craig White and Dawson to make the only breakthroughs in the afternoon, White having Matthew Hayden caught on 46 and Dawson striking to have Justin Langer caught behind on 48.|$|E
25|$|Muskox Ovibos moschatus (umingmar, maskar in Nunivak Cup'ig). Alaska's {{original}} muskox were hunted {{to extinction}} in the mid-1800s - perhaps by whalers and others. They had originally ranged Alaska's arctic and western coastal tundra. In 1935-1936 the U.S. Biological Survey brought 31 muskoxen from Greenland to Nunivak Island {{in an effort}} to reestablish the species in Alaska and as a means for subsistence living. Because the animals were federally protected, and since the Nunivaarmiut were afraid of them, they added <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> local economy until 40 years later. when Nunivak women learned to make fine items of clothing from the underwool of the muskox (qiviut). The muskox are large animals that look a lot like bison, but have wool like sheep, and has a two-layered coat, and qiviut refers specifically to the soft underwool beneath the longer outer wool. The first modern hunting season was in 1975. Today the Nunivak herd numbers around 600 animals, down from a high of around 700 animals in 1968.|$|E
25|$|Bracton {{considered}} {{the case of}} when a tenant made a gift of frankalmoin - a gift of land to the Church. A wardship would be of no value at all. An escheat of the land (a reclamation of the land by the overlord) would allow the owner {{to take control of}} the land. But the act of placing the land in frankalmoin left it in the hands of a group of lawyers or others who allowed the use of the land by a Church organization. The overlord would have nominal control of the corporation which had never entered into a feudal homage arrangement. The corporation owed <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> overlord. Bracton was sympathetic to this arrangement. According to him the lord is not really injured. His rights to the land remain unscathed. It is true they have been significantly diminished. He had suffered damnum, but there had been no iniuria. Bracton was of the opinion that a gift of land to the Church could be voided by the heirs, but not the lord.|$|E
