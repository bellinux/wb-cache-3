5000|$|Gustav V was 121.6 m long, 18.63 m {{wide and}} had a depth of 6.25 m [...] The hull was made of <b>nitrated</b> <b>steel</b> with {{overlapping}} plates with an armored belt at the waterline and on the citadel. The bow was designed with a forward sloping Atlantic bow which gave her the ability {{to act as an}} icebreaker. Unlike her sister ship HMS Sverige, Gustav V was not designed as a flagship but instead received two bunks for 22 cadets and engineers.|$|E
50|$|Wrangels hull {{was made}} of <b>nitrated</b> <b>steel.</b> Like former Swedish destroyers, the ship had no proper {{superstructure}} on the bow, but had only a protective skirt wall for the command bridge, {{though there was a}} small superstructure on the stern. The propulsion machinery consisted of four steam boilers which delivered steam to two steam turbines. The machine generated an output of 11,500 horsepower, giving a maximum speed of 34 knots. Each boiler had a separate funnel, which led to the common four stack arrangement of the time. The two steam turbines were of a new type with reduction gears, which meant that the turbine speed could be shifted down to lower the propeller speed, giving the machinery a better efficiency.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the idea of}} replacing a hypoid gear type gear of {{the same type of}} lift that is, worm face gear. Constructive and functional advantages of worm face gears require their use as alternatives to hypoid gears known. Reference is made to a real situation involving the differential mechanism of Dacia 1307 car for which a new alternative with a worm face gear made of <b>nitrated</b> <b>steel</b> is proposed. This study is the initial stage of an experiment that will continue for a longer period...|$|E
25|$|An {{economic}} depression {{that began in}} 1972 was exacerbated by capital flight, plummeting private investment, and withdrawal of bank deposits in response to Allende's socialist program. Production fell and unemployment rose. Allende adopted measures including price freezes, wage increases, and tax reforms, to increase consumer spending and redistribute income downward. Joint public-private public works projects helped reduce unemployment. Much of the banking sector was nationalized. Many enterprises within the copper, coal, iron, <b>nitrate,</b> and <b>steel</b> industries were expropriated, nationalized, or subjected to state intervention. Industrial output increased sharply and unemployment fell during the Allende administration's first year.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the first}} year of Allende's term, the {{short-term}} economic results of Economics Minister Pedro Vuskovic's expansive monetary policy were unambiguously favorable: 12% industrial growth and an 8.6% increase in GDP, accompanied by major declines in inflation (down from 34.9% to 22.1%) and unemployment (down to 3.8%). Allende adopted measures including price freezes, wage increases, and tax reforms, which had the effect of increasing consumer spending and redistributing income downward. Joint public-private public works projects helped reduce unemployment. Much of the banking sector was nationalized. Many enterprises within the copper, coal, iron, <b>nitrate,</b> and <b>steel</b> industries were expropriated, nationalized, or subjected to state intervention. Industrial output increased sharply and unemployment fell during the administration's first year. However, these results were not sustainable and in 1972 the Chilean escudo had runaway inflation of 140%. An economic depression that had begun in 1967 peaked in 1972, exacerbated by capital flight, plummeting private investment, and withdrawal of bank deposits in response to Allende's socialist program. Production fell and unemployment rose. The combination of inflation and government-mandated price-fixing led to the rise of black markets in rice, beans, sugar, and flour, and a [...] "disappearance" [...] of such basic commodities from supermarket shelves.|$|R
40|$|In {{this article}} we report the {{mechanism}} involved in the nitriding process of stainless steel by ion implantation. The importance of the nitrogen ion mean-free path on the stainless <b>steel</b> <b>nitrated</b> layer obtained by using a broad ion source is established. The energy distribution of the nitrogen ions arriving at the substrate is basically determined by the inelastic scattering suffered by the ions {{on the way to}} the material surface, i. e., the ion mean-free-path lambda. Besides this effect, the ion current density arriving at the sample surface is modified by the dispersion introduced by the collisions of the nitrogen ions with the chamber background molecules. This multiple scattering process is modeled assuming a stochastic phenomenon and its conclusions used to explain experimental results of hardness, diffusion profile, and nitrated layer thickness. A controlled oxygen-background partial pressure is also introduced and its role on the nitrated layer reported. At relatively low ion energies and oxygen partial pressures, both the diffusion zone and nitrated layer thickness are controlled by the ion current density. Indeed, they follow a linear relationship, provided that the composition of the nitrated layer does not change, i. e., the amount of incorporated nitrogen does not modify the original material crystalline phase.

5000|$|A {{well-known}} {{example of}} a (white wood-hulled) four-masted jackass-barque was the Olympic, a 1,402 GRT [...] "Down Easter" [...] (a square-rigged sailing ship from the dockyards of the downeastern ports, preferably made of timber). Said {{to be the only}} one in the world, she was launched in 1892 at the shipyard of the New England Ship Building Company, Bath, ME, for Captain W. H. Besse of New Bedford, MA1. Her maiden voyage under her first master, Captain Stephen Bourne Gibbs, led her from Bath to New York City, South Street Seaport, with [...] "clean swept holds" [...] and without any ballast, then with a cargo of iron rails and plates around Cape Horn to Portland, Oregon. She carried <b>steel,</b> <b>nitrate,</b> and other cargoes. Captain Gibbs was an experienced square-rigged skipper, and took great care of best stowage of the cargo, having the stevedores put 2/3 of it in the 'tween decks. For her new owner, Hackfield & Co. of Honolulu, managed by Williams, Dimond & Co., the Olympic ran in the sugar trade between Hawaii, California, and Australia from 1901 to 1912. Originally rigged with royal sails over double top and topgallant sails on both square-rigged masts and the main mast equipped with an additional single sky sail, she was re-fitted with royal sails over double top but single topgallant sails on both square-rigged masts and no main sky sail after being dismasted in 1901 during a voyage from Hawaii to San Francisco under Captain Gibbs, who retired from the sea in the same year. Under her new master Captain T. H. Evans she sailed between New Zealand, Australia and the US west coast in the timber trade. Towards the end of World War I she changed hands to Thomas Crowley & Co. In that time she was re-rigged as a four-masted barquentine with a square-rigged foremast and three fore-and-aft rigged other masts. During the slump years cargo space of a sailing ship wasn't needed anymore. After being laid up for some years the 30-year-old ship was converted into a towing barge.|$|R
40|$|Three {{simulated}} waste solutions representing wastes from tanks SY- 102 (high nitrate, {{modified to}} exceed guidance limits), AN- 107, and AY- 102 were supplied by PNNL. Out {{of the three}} solutions tested, both optical and electrochemical results show that carbon steel samples corroded much faster in SY- 102 (high nitrate) than {{in the other two}} solutions with lower ratios of nitrate to nitrite. The effect of the surface preparation was not as strong as the effect of solution chemistry. In areas with pristine mill-scale surface, no corrosion occurred even in the SY- 102 (high nitrate) solution, however, corrosion occurred in the areas where the mill-scale was damaged or flaked off due to machining. Localized corrosion in the form of pitting in the vapor space of tank walls is an ongoing challenge to overcome in maintaining the structural integrity of the liquid waste tanks at the Savannah River and Hanford Sites. It has been shown that the liquid waste condensate chemistry influences the amount of corrosion that occurs along the walls of the storage tanks. To minimize pitting corrosion, an effort is underway to gain an understanding of the pitting response in various simulated waste solutions. Electrochemical testing has been used as an accelerated tool in the investigation of pitting corrosion. While significant effort has been undertaken to evaluate the pitting susceptibility of carbon steel in various simulated waste solutions, additional effort is needed to evaluate the effect of liquid waste supernates from six Hanford Site tanks (AY- 101, AY- 102, AN- 102, AN- 107, SY- 102 (high Cl{sup -}), and SY- 102 (high <b>nitrate))</b> on carbon <b>steel.</b> Solutions were formulated at PNNL to replicate tank conditions, {{and in the case of}} SY- 102, exceed Cl{sup -} and NO{sub 3 }{sup -} conditions, respectively, to provide a contrast between in and out of specification limits. The majority of previous testing has been performed on pristine polished samples. To evaluate the actual tank carbon steel surface, efforts are needed to compare the polished surfaces to corroded and mill-scale surfaces, which are more likely to occur in application. Additionally, due to the change in liquid waste levels within the tanks, salt deposits are highly likely to be present along the tank wall. When the level of the tank decreases, a salt deposit will form as the solution evaporates. The effects of this pre-existing salt, or supernate deposit, are unknown at this time on the corrosion effect and thus require investigation. Additionally, in the presence of radiation, moist air undergoes radiolysis, forming a corrosive nitric acid condensate. This condensate could accelerate the corrosion process in the vapor space. To investigate this process, an experimental apparatus simulating the effects of radiation was designed and constructed to provide gamma irradiation while coupons are exposed to a simulate tank solution. Additionally, ammonia vapors will also be introduced to further represent the tank environment...|$|R
