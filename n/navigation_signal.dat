2500|$|Each Galileo {{satellite}} has two master passive {{hydrogen maser}} atomic clocks and two secondary rubidium atomic clocks which {{are independent of}} one other. As precise and stable space-qualified atomic clocks are critical components to any satellite-navigation system, the employed quadruple redundancy keeps Galileo functioning when onboard atomic clocks fail in space. The onboard passive hydrogen maser clocks' precision is four times better than the onboard rubidium atomic clocks and estimated at 1 second per 3 million years (a timing error of a nanosecond or 1 billionth of a second (10−9 or 1/1,000,000,000 s) translates into a [...] positional error on Earth's surface), and will provide an accurate timing signal to allow a receiver to calculate {{the time that it}} takes the signal to reach it. The Galileo satellites are configured to run one hydrogen maser clock in primary mode and a rubidium clock as hot backup. Under normal conditions, the operating hydrogen maser clock produces the reference frequency from which the <b>navigation</b> <b>signal</b> is generated. Should the hydrogen maser encounter any problem, an instantaneous switchover to the rubidium clock would be performed. In case of a failure of the primary hydrogen maser the secondary hydrogen maser could be activated by the ground segment to take over within a period of days as part of the redundant system. A clock monitoring and control unit provides the interface between the four clocks and the <b>navigation</b> <b>signal</b> generator unit (NSU). It passes the signal from the active hydrogen master clock to the NSU and also ensures that the frequencies produced by the master clock and the active spare are in phase, so that the spare can take over instantly should the master clock fail. The NSU information is used to calculate the position of the receiver by trilaterating the difference in received signals from multiple satellites.|$|E

50|$|VOR {{stations}} are fairly short range: the signals are {{line of sight}} between transmitter and receiver and are useful for up to 200 miles. Each station broadcasts a VHF radio composite signal including the <b>navigation</b> <b>signal,</b> station's identifier and voice, if so equipped. The <b>navigation</b> <b>signal</b> allows the airborne receiving equipment to determine a bearing from the station to the aircraft (direction from the VOR station in relation to Magnetic North). The station's identifier is typically a three-letter string in Morse code. The voice signal, if used, is usually the station name, in-flight recorded advisories, or live flight service broadcasts. At some locations, this voice signal is a continuous recorded broadcast of Hazardous Inflight Weather Advisory Service or HIWAS.|$|E

University of LimerickThis work {{presents}} the <b>navigation</b> <b>signals</b> and their allocation {{in the radio}} frequency band used in the new European Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) : Galileo. All signals are described mathematically and then simulated using Matlab language (in transmission). Results are shown thus proving the theory provided by the European Space Agency document: “Open Service Signal in Space Interface Control Document” (OS SIS ICD). Before introducing the <b>navigation</b> <b>signals,</b> a deep study and analysis on the modulations and multiplexing schemes (Binary Phase Shift Keying(BPSK), Binary Offset Carrier (BOC), Alternate Binary Offset Carrier (AltBOC), Carrier Adaptative Sub-Carrier Modulation (CASM) and Double Binary Offset Carrier (DBOC) is carried out, also giving detailed results and simulations in Matlab proving the theory again. Moreover, the acquirement of both the autocorrelation function (ACF) and the power spectral density (PSD) of all <b>navigation</b> <b>signals</b> (in Matlab) and all modulations (in theory) is emphasised in the study. Ranging codes are also studied in this work, however from a more practical than scientific point of view, showing how they have been implemented and what type of codes they are (memory codes, based register codes, gold codes). Finally, a paper is provided reviewing the innovative aspects of the <b>navigation</b> <b>signals</b> and why these have been selected for this new GNSS...|$|R

50|$|A {{traditional}} PAR {{flight inspection}} procedure is performed without a <b>navigation</b> <b>signal</b> available to compare {{directly to a}} truth reference. A traditional PAR is flight inspected by comparing written notes between two observers, one taking notes at a truth reference system such as a theodolite and the other observer taking notes while observing the radar console, see ICAO Document 8071. The Transponder Landing System (TLS) non-traditional PAR can transmit an ILS signal that corresponds to the aircraft position relative to the precision approach. Therefore, the graphical depiction can be directly verified using Instrument Landing System (ILS) flight inspection techniques. This direct measurement removes some ambiguity from the PAR flight inspection process.|$|E

Due to the increased number of the used <b>navigation</b> <b>signals</b> operating availability of GBAS improves. It is possible to use corrections, measured by a ground station for a pair of signals in different frequency bands (for example L 1 OF and L 2 OF) for more accurate positioning on other <b>navigation</b> <b>signals</b> (L 2 OC). It is also possible to broadcast the differential corrections for all available types of naviga- tion signals GLONASS and GPS and remain in a standard volume of transmitted information, which is regulated by the International Civil Aviation Organization...|$|R

Flight 1 was a regularly scheduled TWA Sun Racer flight from Newark, New Jersey to Los Angeles, California with almost a dozen intermediate stops between. Approaching the flight's second stop, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania's Allegheny County Airport, pilot Otto Ferguson lost contact with the airport's radio <b>navigation</b> <b>signal,</b> and tracked several miles in a southwestern line off course. Fearing icing conditions, he descended {{in an attempt to}} find visual landmarks for navigation. Thick fog hindered him, and his descent continued until Flight 1 hit ice-covered trees atop Cheat Mountain, about 40 mi south of Pittsburgh on the West Virginia line and near Uniontown, Pennsylvania. When the plane crashed it was aiming in a northern flight direction indicating that the pilot finally realized he had tracked south of his flightplan and may have been trying to correct it (the flight should have been aimed due west not north or hours prior south-southwest).|$|E

30|$|The <b>navigation</b> <b>signal</b> is an {{important}} part of satellite navigation systems as the coordination work link to satellites, ground control centers, and users [1].

The ranging code is the core part of modern satellite <b>navigation</b> <b>signal</b> transmission schemes and has been widely used in Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSSs), such as the US Global Positioning System (GPS), Russian Global Navigation Satellite System (GLONASS), European Galileo, and Chinese Compass. The properties of ranging code have a great influence on the performance of acquisition, tracking, demodulation, anti-jamming, secrecy, and so on [2]. Therefore, study on properties of ranging codes could provide theoretical support for pursuing ranging codes with better performance and expand design methods of ranging codes in future satellite <b>navigation</b> <b>signal</b> structures.|$|E
