5|$|World War II {{dramatically}} {{changed the}} lives of Gibraltarians. The decision to enforce mass evacuation {{in order to increase}} the strength of the Rock with more military and naval personnel meant that most Gibraltarians (some for up to ten years) had <b>nowhere</b> <b>to</b> call 'home'.

5|$|The {{choice of}} targets was {{left up to}} the midget commanders, with advice that they should {{primarily}} target aircraft carriers or battleships, with cruisers as secondary targets.

Karros moves for a mistrial and the motion is granted, leading to the need to pick a new jury and the judge imposes a fine on the already financially strained Finley & Figg. Wally stands in for Oscar as lead attorney while a new jury is seated and for the first day of testimony.

5|$|A cold open shows Trey Atwood (Bradley Stryker) and {{his brother}} Ryan {{stealing}} a car. The police chase and arrest the boys, resulting in a prison term for Trey and a short stay in juvenile hall for the underage Ryan. A conversation between Ryan and his public defender, Sandy Cohen (Peter Gallagher), establishes Ryan as a smart boy with a rough upbringing; he has three truancies and two suspensions, but his SAT I scores are in the ninety-eighth percentile. When Ryan's mother, Dawn (Daphne Ashbrook), collects Ryan, Sandy gives his business card to the boy. At home in Chino, Dawn asks Ryan to leave, and her boyfriend, A.J. (Ron Del Barrio), expels him from the house. Standing at a payphone with <b>nowhere</b> <b>to</b> go, Ryan calls Sandy for help. As Sandy drives Ryan to his house in Newport Beach, the opening credits and the theme tune play—unlike the other episodes, there is no title sequence.|$|E

They are caught in a storm and head to a nearby mansion to seek shelter. Once outside, Cooper checks his map, but is unaware that someone is watching. Baron von Ghoul, the game's main antagonist, looks down from his window and orders two gargoyles to retrieve Cooper and Amber. Amber is kidnapped by the gargoyles and is taken into the Ghouly Mansion, with Cooper in pursuit. Once inside the mansion, Cooper realises that Amber is <b>nowhere</b> <b>to</b> {{be seen in the}} Grand Hallway. Crivens, the mansion's butler, tells him to go to the archives where Amber is held.

5|$|After a night-time advance, the 20th Battalion was {{positioned}} {{on the ridge}} in reserve behind the 18th and 19th Battalions. On daybreak, {{it was discovered that}} the advance had bypassed numerous strong points, leaving the German line in front of the ridge largely intact. The supporting British armour was <b>nowhere</b> <b>to</b> be seen and the supporting artillery and anti-tank units were unable to break through, leaving the two New Zealand brigades in position on the exposed ridge. Kippenberger had difficulty with his radio communications and made a dash through enemy lines to make contact with the British armour. On reaching one of the British brigades, its commanding officer resisted Kippenberger's entreaties to advance and it was not until a passing British general authorised the move that the British mounted up. By the time the armoured support arrived, the flanking battalion of the 5th Brigade had been overrun, leaving the battalions of the 4th Brigade even more exposed and receiving fire from the enemy.|$|E
5|$|By then, Manning {{was living}} as an openly gay man. Her {{relationship}} with her father was apparently good, but there were problems between Manning and her stepmother. In March 2006, Manning reportedly threatened her stepmother with a knife during an argument about Manning's failure to get another job; the stepmother called the police, and Manning was asked to leave the house. Manning drove to Tulsa in a pickup truck her father had given her, at first slept in it, then moved in with a friend from school. The two got jobs at Incredible Pizza in April. Manning moved on to Chicago before {{running out of money}} and again having <b>nowhere</b> <b>to</b> stay. Her mother arranged for Brian's sister, Debra, a lawyer in Potomac, Maryland, to take Manning in. Nicks wrote that the 15 months Manning spent with her aunt were among the most stable of her life. Chelsea had a boyfriend, took several low-paid jobs, and spent a semester studying history and English at Montgomery College, but left after failing an exam.|$|E

Farrar refused to let her stay in his apartment, but gave her some cash, and she rented a room in a local hotel. Ellen Ryan, Green's divorce lawyer, found her there later in the day in a distraught state. She repeatedly asked Ryan whether her children had died, chanted rhythmically about their deaths, and seemed unable to care for herself. Green was transported to a local hospital for treatment but remained emotionally unstable, suffering from insomnia and appearing to Ryan to be unable to take care of day-to-day life, even after her release from the hospital.|$|E

Chris had been able to leave home on a football scholarship and would later play in the National Football League, but Washington himself had <b>nowhere</b> <b>to</b> go. He trained for three hours a day {{toward the end of his}} senior season, and showed up uninvited at a playground game featuring top high school players from Washington and Pennsylvania, where he talked his way into the game. Tom Young, who had recently left his job as an assistant coach at Maryland University to become head coach at American University, saw him play there, and although Washington did not perform particularly well, Young was impressed by his hustle and how he ignored the poor treatment he received from the people who organized the game.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to her work in big-budget productions, Baker also appeared in small, independent films, such as Just Your Luck (1996) and <b>Nowhere</b> <b>to</b> Go (1997). The '90s also had Baker more frequently appearing on television series, including episodes of Grand (1990), Tales from the Crypt (1991, opposite Teri Garr in a segment directed by Michael J. Fox), Murder, She Wrote and L.A. Law (both 1993); Chicago Hope (1995), and Roswell (1999). In 2000, she appeared in the Lifetime film Another Woman's Husband. In 2002, Baker appeared in the documentary Cinerama Adventure, and guest-starred on an episode of The Lyon's Den, playing Rob Lowe's mother.

Her acting career spanned 50 years, and more than 80 roles in film, television, and theater.|$|E

Elsewhere, Green is arrested. His property is searched but Helen is <b>nowhere</b> <b>to</b> be found—although another corpse is dug up in the garden, evidently killed nine years before. Black deduces that Green could not have killed Helen at the cabin as his house was already being watched by the police. He sees a set of tools in Green's home which he realizes were not used for murder or torture, but to immure Helen in the basement. Black and the police dismantle a newly finished plaster wall, finding Helen injured but alive; it is at this point that Black realizes Green was simply a pawn, used by his father to lure victims to the house.|$|E
