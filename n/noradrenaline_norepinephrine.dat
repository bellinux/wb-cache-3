50|$|The {{sympathetic}} {{nervous system}} is responsible for up- and down-regulating in many homeostatic mechanisms in living organisms. Fibers from the SNS innervate tissues in almost every organ system, providing at least some regulatory function to things as diverse as pupil diameter, gut motility, and urinary system output and function. It is {{perhaps best known for}} mediating the neuronal and hormonal stress response commonly known as the fight-or-flight response. This response is also known as sympatho-adrenal response of the body, as the preganglionic sympathetic fibers that end in the adrenal medulla (but also all other sympathetic fibers) secrete acetylcholine, which activates the great secretion of adrenaline (epinephrine) {{and to a lesser extent}} <b>noradrenaline</b> (<b>norepinephrine)</b> from it. Therefore, this response that acts primarily on the cardiovascular system is mediated directly via impulses transmitted through the {{sympathetic nervous system}} and indirectly via catecholamines secreted from the adrenal medulla.|$|E
5000|$|Chromaffin {{cells of}} the adrenal medulla are innervated by the splanchnic nerve and secrete {{adrenaline}} (epinephrine), <b>noradrenaline</b> (<b>norepinephrine),</b> some dopamine, enkephalin and enkephalin-containing peptides, {{and a few other}} hormones into the blood stream. The secreted adrenaline and noradrenaline {{play an important role in}} the sympathetic nervous system response, commonly called the fight-or-flight response. The enkephalins and enkephalin-containing peptides are related to, but distinct from endogenous peptides named endorphins (which are secreted from the pituitary); all of these peptides bind to opioid receptors and produce analgesic (and other) responses. The hormones are secreted from chromaffin granules; this is where the enzyme dopamine β-hydroxylase catalyses the conversion of dopamine to noradrenaline. [...] Distinct N and E cell forms exist (also Na and A cells in British nomenclature - noradrenaline and adrenaline); the former produce norepinephrine, the latter arise out of N cells through interaction with glucocorticoids, and convert norepinephrine into epinephrine.|$|E

2500|$|The term [...] "adrenergic" [...] {{is often}} misinterpreted {{in that the}} main {{sympathetic}} neurotransmitter is <b>norepinephrine</b> (<b>noradrenaline),</b> rather than epinephrine, as discovered by Ulf von Euler in 1946.|$|R
50|$|Included among catecholamines are {{epinephrine}} (adrenaline), <b>norepinephrine</b> (<b>noradrenaline),</b> and dopamine. Release of {{the hormones}} epinephrine and norepinephrine from the adrenal medulla of the adrenal glands {{is part of}} the fight-or-flight response.|$|R
5000|$|The {{reaction}} {{begins in}} the amygdala, which triggers a neural response in the hypothalamus. The initial reaction is followed by activation of the pituitary gland and secretion of the hormone ACTH. The adrenal gland is activated almost simultaneously and releases the hormone epinephrine. The release of chemical messengers results {{in the production of}} the hormone cortisol, which increases blood pressure, blood sugar, and suppresses the immune system. The initial response and subsequent reactions are triggered in an effort to create a boost of energy. This boost of energy is activated by epinephrine binding to liver cells and the subsequent production of glucose. Additionally, the circulation of cortisol functions to turn fatty acids into available energy, which prepares muscles throughout the body for response. Catecholamine hormones, such as adrenaline (epinephrine) or <b>noradrenaline</b> (<b>norepinephrine),</b> facilitate immediate physical reactions associated with a preparation for violent muscular action and : ...|$|E
5000|$|Chromaffin cells, also pheochromocytes, are neuroendocrine cells found {{mostly in}} the medulla of the adrenal glands in mammals. These cells serve a variety of {{functions}} such as serving {{as a response to}} stress, monitoring carbon dioxide and oxygen concentrations in the body, maintenance of respiration and the regulation of blood pressure. [...] They are in close proximity to pre-synaptic sympathetic ganglia of the sympathetic nervous system, with which they communicate, and structurally they are similar to post-synaptic sympathetic neurons. In order to activate chromaffin cells, the splanchnic nerve of the sympathetic nervous system releases acetylcholine, which then binds to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors on the adrenal medulla. This causes the release of catecholamines. The chromaffin cells release catecholamines: ~80% of Adrenaline (Epinephrine) and ~20% of <b>Noradrenaline</b> (<b>Norepinephrine)</b> into systemic circulation for systemic effects on multiple organs (similarly to secretory neurones of the hypothalamus), and can also send paracrine signals. Hence they are called neuroendocrine cells.|$|E
