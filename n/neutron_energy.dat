25|$|Uranium-238 (238U or U-238) is {{the most}} common isotope of uranium found in nature, with a {{relative}} abundance of 99%. Unlike uranium-235, it is non-fissile, which means it cannot sustain a chain reaction. However, it is fissionable by fast neutrons, and is fertile, meaning it can be transmuted to fissile plutonium-239. 238U cannot support a chain reaction because inelastic scattering reduces <b>neutron</b> <b>energy</b> below the range where fast fission of one or more next-generation nuclei is probable. Doppler broadening of U-238's neutron absorption resonances, increasing absorption as fuel temperature increases, is also an essential negative feedback mechanism for reactor control.|$|E
25|$|PWRs are {{designed}} to be maintained in an undermoderated state, meaning that there is room for increased water volume or density to further increase moderation, because if moderation were near saturation, then a reduction in density of the moderator/coolant could reduce neutron absorption significantly while reducing moderation only slightly, making the void coefficient positive. Also, light water is actually a somewhat stronger moderator of neutrons than heavy water, though heavy water's neutron absorption is much lower. Because of these two facts, light water reactors have a relatively small moderator volume and therefore have compact cores. One next generation design, the supercritical water reactor, is even less moderated. A less moderated <b>neutron</b> <b>energy</b> spectrum does worsen the capture/fission ratio for 235U and especially 239Pu, meaning that more fissile nuclei fail to fission on neutron absorption and instead capture the neutron to become a heavier nonfissile isotope, wasting one or more neutrons and increasing accumulation of heavy transuranic actinides, some of which have long half-lives.|$|E

2500|$|Most of {{the natural}} neutron {{background}} {{is a product of}} cosmic rays interacting with the atmosphere. The <b>neutron</b> <b>energy</b> peaks at around 1MeV and rapidly drops above. At sea level, the production of neutrons is about 20 neutrons per second per kilogram of material interacting with the cosmic rays (or, about 100–300 neutrons per square meter per second). The flux is dependent on geomagnetic latitude, with a maximum near the magnetic poles. At solar minimums, due to lower solar magnetic field shielding, the flux is about twice as high vs the solar maximum. It also dramatically increases during solar flares. In the vicinity of larger heavier objects, e.g. buildings or ships, the neutron flux measures higher; this is known as [...] "cosmic ray induced neutron signature", or [...] "ship effect" [...] as it was first detected with ships at sea.|$|E
50|$|It {{so happens}} that the neutron {{cross-section}} of many actinides decreases with increasing <b>neutron</b> <b>energy,</b> but the ratio of fission to simple activation (neutron capture) changes in favour of fission as the <b>neutron</b> <b>energy</b> increases.
