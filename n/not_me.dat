5|$|Discussions {{about making}} her sixth studio album being a Christmas record began on December 2012, {{a month after}} {{releasing}} her first greatest hits album, Greatest Hits – Chapter One. Having found {{the opportunity to do}} so, Clarkson commissioned producer and multi-instrumentalist Greg Kurstin, whom she had previously collaborated with on her albums Stronger and Greatest Hits – Chapter One, to solely produce the whole album. Despite having been raised in a Jewish faith and unfamiliar with Christmas songs, Kurstin still agreed to produce the project. As a result, the record marked the second time her studio album only had a single producer (the first being David Kahne solely producing My December in 2007). It also marked the fourth time Kurstin had solely produced an entire studio album apart from {{being a member of the}} musical groups The Bird and the Bee and Geggy Tah (the first three being Lily Allen's It's <b>Not</b> <b>Me,</b> It's You in 2009, Sia's We Are Born in 2010, and The Shins' Port of Morrow in 2012).|$|E

25|$|It's <b>Not</b> <b>Me,</b> It's You is {{the second}} studio album by English singer and {{songwriter}} Lily Allen. It was released on 4 February 2009 by Regal Recordings and Parlophone. It was produced and co-written by Greg Kurstin, with whom Allen had previously worked on her debut studio album, Alright, Still (2006). The album represents {{a departure from the}} ska and reggae influences of its predecessor, incorporating electropop with elements of jazz and country.|$|E
25|$|In the 2000s synthpop {{began to}} re-emerge {{as a new}} wave of indie artists began to {{incorporate}} the sound into their songs. Major British acts to be influenced by this sound include pioneers Goldfrapp, and Hot Chip, who were followed by acts including Little Boots, Ellie Goulding and La Roux. The electronic sound and style have arguably influenced many other mainstream pop artists, including Lily Allen's second album It's <b>Not</b> <b>Me,</b> It's You (2009), which abandoned the ska influences of her earlier work. British soul/R artists such as Jay Sean and Taio Cruz have also embraced electro-pop sounds.|$|E

25|$|Heywood's {{first play}} {{may have been}} The Four Prentises of London (printed 1615, but acted some fifteen years earlier). This tale of four {{apprentices}} who become knights and travel to Jerusalem may have been intended as a burlesque of the old romances, {{but it is more}} likely that it was meant seriously to attract the apprentice spectators to whom it was dedicated. Its popularity was satirized in Beaumont and Fletcher's travesty of the middle-class taste in drama, The Knight of the Burning Pestle.
