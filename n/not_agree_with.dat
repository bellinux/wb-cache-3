5|$|Although Robert {{condemned}} Gilbert Porrée {{in conjunction}} with Peter Lombard, he did <b>not</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> Lombard's Christology, or views {{on the nature of}} Jesus Christ. Likewise, although he disagreed with some of Abelard's teachings, he defended Abelard against charges of heresy. Robert did, however, agree with some of Abelard's teachings and methods. The introduction to the Sententiae proclaims Robert's desire to harmonise the writings of two unnamed scholars, who have been identified by modern writers as Hugh of St Victor and Abelard.|$|E
5|$|Burnett Hillman Streeter {{proposed}} Caesarea or Beirut {{for three}} reasons: it contains, after the New Testament, the two Epistles of Clement; it represents an eclectic {{text in the}} New Testament, Antiochian in the Gospels and Alexandrian in the Acts and Epistles, it suggests some place where the influence of Antioch and of Alexandria met; {{the text of the}} Old Testament appears to be a non-Alexandrian text heavily revised by the Hexapla, the Old Testament quotations in New Testament more often than <b>not</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> Alexandrinus against Vaticanus.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 1020s, Maymandi urged Mahmud to invade Jibal, {{which was then}} {{under the control of}} the young Buyid ruler Majd al-Dawla. However, the real ruler of the region was Majd al-Dawla's mother Sayyida Shirin, which was already known by the neighbors of the Buyids, {{including}} the Ghaznavids. Mahmud, however, did <b>not</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> him, because he did not feel his empire threatened because of a woman ruling in the region.|$|E

5|$|If a {{publisher}} does <b>not</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> the rating {{that they were}} assigned, they may edit the game and submit the revised version for a new rating; for example, an initial cut of The Punisher was given an AO rating due to the extremely violent nature of certain scenes contained within the game. To lessen their impact, the developer changed these scenes to be rendered in black and white: the revised cut of the game was re-submitted, and received the M rating.

5|$|The UCR and the Frepaso united as a {{political}} coalition, the Alliance for Work, Justice and Education, led by Alfonsín, Fernando delaRúa and Rodolfo Terragno from the UCR, and Carlos Álvarez and Graciela Fernández Meijide from the Frepaso.

5|$|After {{a winter}} filled with Indian attacks, {{including}} one which claimed {{the life of}} Shelby's younger brother Evan Shelby III, Kentucky militia units won some minor victories over the Indians in early 1794. In spring the response to Wayne's call for troops was more enthusiastic; 1,600 volunteers mustered at Fort Greenville and were hastily trained. By August, 1794, Wayne was on the offensive against the Indians and dealt them a decisive blow at the August 20, 1794 Battle of Fallen Timbers. This victory, and the ensuing Treaty of Greenville, secured the territory, and although Shelby did <b>not</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> some of the restrictions placed upon western settlers by this treaty, he abided by its terms and enforced those that were under his jurisdiction.|$|E
5|$|Casualties in {{the battle}} are {{notoriously}} hard to calculate exactly. With only one exception (Scipion), records made by the French captains of their losses at the time are incomplete. The only immediately available casualty counts are the sketchy reports of Saint-André and the records made by British officers aboard the captured ships, neither {{of which can be}} treated as completely reliable. Most sources accept that French casualties in the campaign numbered approximately 7,000, including around 3,000captured, but these figures are vague and frequently do <b>not</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> each other on details. British casualties are easier to confirm but here, too, there are some discrepancies; overall British casualties are generally given as around 1,200.|$|E
5|$|During the 1920s, Victoria had repressive and {{restrictive}} drinking laws, {{including the}} notorious six o'clock closing. Blamey took {{the position that}} it was the job of the police to enforce the laws, even if they did not support them. Many members of the public did <b>not</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> this attitude, maintaining that the police should not uphold such laws. Almost as controversially, Blamey drew a sharp distinction between his personal life and his job. His presence in a hotel after closing time was always welcome, as it meant that drinking could continue, for it was known {{that it would not be}} raided while he was there; but other citizens felt that it was unjust when they were arrested for breaking the same laws.|$|E
60|$|Rabecque was silent. Maybe he {{was ashamed}} of himself; or maybe that, <b>not</b> <b>agreeing</b> <b>with</b> his master, he had yet {{sufficient}} appreciation of his position to be discreetly silent where his opinions might be at variance. Thus Garnache was encouraged to continue.|$|R

5|$|In 1930, Segrè began {{studying}} the Zeeman effect in certain alkaline metals. When his progress stalled because the diffraction grating he required to continue {{was not available}} in Italy, he wrote to four laboratories elsewhere in Europe asking for assistance and received an invitation from Pieter Zeeman to finish his work at Zeeman's laboratory in Amsterdam. Segrè was awarded a Rockefeller Foundation fellowship and, on Fermi's advice, elected {{to use it to}} study under Otto Stern in Hamburg. Working with Otto Frisch on space quantization produced results that apparently did <b>not</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> the current theory; but Isidor Isaac Rabi showed that theory and experiment were in agreement if the nuclear spin of potassium was +1/2.|$|E
5|$|In 1961, Berkeley {{scientists}} {{claimed the}} discovery of element 103 in the reaction of californium with boron and carbon ions. They claimed {{the production of the}} isotope 257103, and also claimed to have synthesized an alpha decaying isotope of element 102 that had a half-life of 15s and alpha decay energy 8.2MeV. They assigned this to 255102 without giving a reason for the assignment. The values do <b>not</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> those now known for 255No, although they do agree with those now known for 257No, and while this isotope probably played a part in this experiment its discovery was inconclusive.|$|E
5|$|In December 1940 Bacher {{joined the}} Radiation Laboratory at MIT, {{but did not}} {{immediately}} cease his research. He reached an arrangement with its director, Lee Alvin DuBridge, to return to Cornell for four days every three weeks until it was completed. He was researching the neutron cross section of cadmium, a topic of interest to Enrico Fermi, who was attempting {{to build a nuclear}} reactor, but whose figures did <b>not</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> Bacher's. Bacher carefully checked his results, and Fermi, convinced of their correctness, urged Bacher to publish them. Bacher submitted a paper to the Physical Review with instructions to withhold publication until after the war, and the paper was not published until 1946.|$|E

5|$|Morehead {{moved to}} Louisville in 1859 {{and formed a}} law {{partnership}} with his nephew, Charles M. Briggs. In February 1861, he attended the Peace Conference of 1861 that tried to resolve the sectional differences between the states. In May 1861, he was chosen as a delegate to the Border State Convention, an ultimately futile attempt to avert the Civil War. Morehead refused to sign the final document produced by the convention because he did <b>not</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> all the statements it contained. He was an advocate of Kentucky's position of neutrality, but was personally sympathetic to the South and was {{an outspoken critic of}} the Lincoln administration. He condemned Secretary of State William H. Seward for cutting off trade with the South.|$|E
5|$|When {{he assumed}} his Senate seat in 1855, Crittenden was sixty-nine years old, the eldest {{member of that}} body. The Whig Party had {{practically}} dissolved by this time, and he joined many of his fellow Kentuckians in associating with the Know Nothing Party. Although he did <b>not</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> all of the party's principles, he would not associate with the Democrats, the party he {{had spent much of}} his career denouncing, nor would he associate with the new Republican Party because of their stance against slavery. Despite his misgivings about some of the party platform, he campaigned on behalf of Millard Fillmore, the party's candidate in the 1856 presidential election.|$|E
5|$|A {{declaration}} is only {{as effective}} as the willingness of a public body to abide by the court's statement of the law in it, as it is not a contempt of court to ignore a declaration. In Webster v. Southwark London Borough Council (1982), Webster was a parliamentary candidate for the National Front, a far right racial nationalist political party, who wanted to hold an election meeting in a hall owned by Southwark London Borough Council. Despite being required by provisions of the Representation of the People Act 1949 to permit Webster to use the hall, the local council refused to do so as it did <b>not</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> Webster's political views. The court made a declaration that Webster was legally entitled to use the hall at a certain time for the purpose of his election campaign, {{on the assumption that the}} local council would obey it. Nonetheless, the local council still refused to allow Webster use of the hall. It was held that a declaration is not a coercive order of the court and, accordingly, refusal to comply with it is not contempt.|$|E
