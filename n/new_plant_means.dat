5000|$|Certain {{groups and}} organisations {{are of the}} view that the <b>new</b> power <b>plant</b> would <b>mean</b> the {{continuation}} of traditional coal-based electricity production. Today Kosovo wastes 30% of available energy due to energy efficiency, 37% due to technical losses, the outdated electrical grid and other commercial losses, such as theft. A study by Dr. Daniel Kammen shows that [...] "Kosovo can cover 38% of its energy consumption from renewable sources". He also specified that this scenario, without including the Kosova e Re power plant, would create 27% more jobs than current scenarios. Energy Community commitments cite that Kosovo needs to source 25% of overall energy from renewable sources by 2020, which will be harder to achieve if the <b>new</b> power <b>plant</b> is to be constructed. The Kosovo Civil Society Consortium for Sustainable Development (KOSID) are questioning the necessity of the costly power plant and instead propose energy efficiency programmes, which tackle of energy losses, renewable energy development and the rehabilitation of the existing Kosovo B Power Station. They also raise the issue of the environmental and social impacts the new project would have on Kosovars. There are 835 deaths per year in Kosovo due to air pollution, of which the lignite power plants are responsible for a substantial proportion. A new power station could make matters worse. KOSID also stressed the issue of water and agricultural land shortage and the resettlement of the local population which consists mostly of farmers who will need compensation for the lost land and livelihoods ...|$|R
