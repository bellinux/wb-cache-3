25|$|Although {{only two}} Test matches had been {{scheduled}} for the tour, the Test series {{turned out to be}} a significant one in cricketing history. Both were high scoring matches, with the total runs scored in each match exceeding 1,400. Both matches were drawn, but a number of world records were established during the series, particularly in the first match. India played a three-day tour match before the first Test against the Sri Lanka Board President's XI, starting on 29 July. The match ended in a draw, with the Indians scoring 308 runs in their first innings. The President's XI responded with 291, and the Indian team had scored 255 for 5 wickets for their second innings by the end of the match. Sanath Jayasuriya was the highest scorer of the series with 571 runs, while Sachin Tendulkar produced 290 runs for the Indians. Muttiah Muralidharan was the highest wicket taker of the series with 9 wickets, followed by Anil Kumble with 5. Both Tests, as well as the practice match, were held in Colombo. The fact that all the matches of the tour were in Colombo was criticized by the media, and the Indian players and officials were also <b>not</b> <b>happy</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> The cricket board had ruled out other venues reportedly due to bad weather.|$|E

Spider {{eventually}} changed his mind and Hancock commented [...] "The fact is that he really fancies Toyah, and he figures that he may as well be hung for a sheep as a goat." [...] The actor reckoned that Spider and Toyah brought out the best in each other. Spider and Toyah soon began a proper relationship and briefly lived together. However, when Spider announced that he wanted to settle down and buy a house with Toyah, the couple realised that they had started to drift apart. Spider thought that if they got a mortgage together it would help save the relationship, but Toyah did not want that at all. When Spider was offered a promotion, he realised {{that he did not want}} to work for the DSS anymore and quit. He then told Toyah that he had bought them tickets to India so that they could go and [...] "find themselves." [...] However, Toyah insisted that she did not want to leave Weatherfield. Nicole Carmichael from Inside Soap wrote that while Spider did not want to lose Toyah, he felt that he could not stay and soon departed.|$|E

Reeve {{stunned the}} director and producers, but {{he was told to}} wear a [...] "muscle suit" [...] to produce the desired muscular physique. Reeve refused, undertaking a strict physical exercise regime headed by David Prowse. Prowse had wanted to portray Superman, but was denied an audition by the filmmakers because he was not American. Prowse also auditioned for Non. Reeve went from 188 to 212 pounds during pre-production and filming. Reeve was paid a mere $250,000 for both Superman and Superman II, while his veteran co-stars received huge sums of money: $3.7 million for Brando and $2 million for Hackman for Superman I. However, Reeve felt, [...] "'Superman' brought me many opportunities, rather than closing a door in my face." [...] Jeff East portrays teenage Clark Kent. East's lines were overdubbed by Reeve during post-production. [...] "I was <b>not</b> <b>happy</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> because the producers never told me what they had in mind," [...] East commented. [...] "It was done without my permission {{but it turned out to}} be okay. Chris did a good job but it caused tension between us. We resolved our issues with each other years later." [...] East also tore several thigh muscles when performing the stunt of racing alongside the train. He applied 3 to 4 hours of prosthetic makeup daily to facially resemble Reeve.|$|E

2500|$|An {{organized}} letter-writing campaign, dubbed COOP (Citizens Opposed to the Offing of Peaks), {{attempted to}} save the show from cancellation. The campaign was successful, as ABC agreed to air the remaining six episodes to finish the season. But due to the Gulf War, Twin Peaks was moved from its usual time slot [...] "for six weeks out of eight" [...] in early 1991, according to Frost, preventing the show from maintaining audience interest. In the final episodes, Agent Cooper was given a love interest, Annie Blackburn (Heather Graham), to replace the writers' intended romance between him and Audrey Horne. According to Frost, Lara Flynn Boyle, who was romantically involved with Kyle MacLachlan at the time, had effectively vetoed the Audrey-Cooper relationship, forcing the writers {{to come up with}} an alternative. Sherilyn Fenn corroborated this claim in a 2014 interview, stating, [...] " [...] was mad that my character was getting more attention, so then Kyle started saying that his character shouldn’t be with my character because it doesn’t look good, ’cause I’m too young... I was <b>not</b> <b>happy</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> It was stupid." [...] The series finale did not sufficiently boost interest, despite ending on a deliberate audience-baiting cliffhanger, and the show was not renewed for a third season, leaving the cliffhanger unresolved.|$|E
2500|$|Now, having used {{up much of}} {{the footage}} {{originally}} intended for Lucifer Rising for Invocation of My Demon Brother, Anger again set about to create [...] "Lucifer Rising", a symbolic analogy of the coming Aeon of Horus as prophesied in the Thelemic sacred text, The Book of the Law. Anger persuaded the singer and actress Marianne Faithfull to appear in it. He also tried to convince his friend Mick Jagger to play the part of Lucifer in the film but Jagger refused. Instead he offered his brother Chris for the part. Anger accepted, but was <b>not</b> <b>happy</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> Anger subsequently filmed eight minutes of film {{and showed it to}} the British National Film Finance Corporation who agreed to provide £15,000 in order for Anger to complete it – something that caused a level of outrage in the British press. With this money, he could afford to fly the cast and crew to both Germany and Egypt for filming. Anger befriended Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page around this time, the two sharing a great interest in Crowley. At Page's invitation, Anger travelled to Page's new home, Crowley's former residence Boleskine House located on the shores of Loch Ness in Scotland, to help the musician exorcise the building of what Page believed to be a headless man's ghost. Page subsequently agreed to produce the soundtrack for Lucifer Rising, and used the editing suite which was in the basement of his London home to shape the music which he produced. Anger later fell out with Page's wife Charlotte, who kicked him out of the house. In retaliation, Anger called a press conference in which he ridiculed Page and threatened to [...] "throw a Kenneth Anger curse" [...] on him. Page's music was dumped from the film and replaced in 1979 by music written and recorded by the imprisoned Bobby Beausoleil, with whom Anger had reconciled.|$|E
