40|$|The {{effects of}} 2. 5 mg/kg-day {{ibudilast}}, {{with or without}} 300 mg/kg-day <b>nicomol,</b> or 10 mg/kg-day ibudilast on calcium and magnesium con-centrations in {{the central nervous system}} (CNS), heart, liver, kidney, skeletal muscle, abdominal aorta and bone were determined in rabbits fed a 1 % cholesterol-rich diet for 3 months. Serum thromboxane Hz concentrations were reduced in rabbits treated with 10 mg/kg-day ibudilast or with 2. 5 mg/kg-day ibudilast plus 300 mg/kg-day <b>nicomol,</b> and atherosclerotic lesions were ameliorated compared with un-treated rabbits. Calcium concentrations in the frontal cortex and cerebellum were lower in ibudilast/nicomol-treated rabbits and in those fed a standard diet compared with those receiving a cholesterol-rich diet only. Calcium concentrations in the pons and abdominal aorta were also lower in ibudilast/nicomol-treated rabbits whereas the calcium concentrations in the cerebellum were lower in rabbits treated with either 2. 5 or 20 mg/kg-day ibudilast. There were no significant changes in tissue magnesium concentrations after feeding a choles-terol-rich diet, with or without drug treatment. It is concluded that 2. 5 mg/kg-day ibudilast plus 300 mg/kg-day <b>nicomol</b> or 10 mg/kg-day ibudilast produced a scavenger effect on calcium deposited in the CNS and abdominal aorta of rabbits fed a cholesterol-rich diet.

40|$|Protective {{effects of}} {{clinically}} used drugs against adriamycin (ADM) -induced toxicity were studied in ICR mice. The control mice, which were administered 15 mg/kg of ADM twice, survived 7. 48 +/- 1. 99 days (mean +/- S. D.). The survival times of mice {{treated with the}} following drugs, expressed {{as a percent of}} that of the control group, were 293. 6 % for coenzyme Q 10 (Co Q 10, 2 mg/kg), 402. 2 % for dextran sulfate (MDS, 300 mg/kg), 121. 6 % for flavin adenine dinucleotide (20 mg/kg), 236. 3 % for adenosine triphosphate disodium (50 mg/kg), 213. 7 % for reduced glutathione (100 mg/kg), 121. 6 % for phytonadione (50 mg/kg), 155. 2 % for inositol nicotinate (Ino-N, 500 mg/kg), 335. 5 % for <b>nicomol</b> (1000 mg/kg), 157. 5 % for nicardipine (10 mg/kg) and 123. 3 % for dipyridamol (50 mg/kg). Anti-hyperlipemic agents such as MDS, <b>nicomol,</b> Ino-N and Co Q 10 strongly protected against the ADM-induced toxicity, and the mice administered these drugs lived significantly longer than the control mice. The mechanism of the protective effect was discussed. </p...|$|E
40|$|In {{cardiovascular}} diseases with potential atherosclerosis, the serum concentration of HDL cholesterol {{as determined by}} a precipitation method with dextran sulfate and Mg++ was lower while that of total cholesterol was normal or elevated. Treatment with a daily dose of 1, 200 mg of <b>Nicomol,</b> a derivative of nicotinic acid, for 1 to 3 months increased the mean HDL cholesterol level by 3 to 5 mg/dl and reduced the total cholesterol level by 14 to 15 mg/dl and total/HDL cholesterol ratio by 0. 8 (3 months) to 0. 9 (1 month, p less than 0. 05). Similar decreases in HDL cholesterol concentration were also found in parenchymal and obstructive liver diseases with normal total cholesterol values except in fulminant hepatitis and intrahepatic cholestasis. </p...|$|E
