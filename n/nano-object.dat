The validity of the analysis depends upon the ability to physically isolate the <b>nano-objects</b> on a chemically inert support. This requirement can be realized by deposition of the <b>nano-objects</b> on a Nano-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization (NALDI™) plate. The featured nanostructured surface provides a support where <b>nano-objects</b> can be isolated if the deposition is performed at a proper concentration. We demonstrate the characterization of individual <b>nano-objects</b> on a NALDI™ plate for two different types of nanometric bacteriophages: Qβ and M 13.

The structure and morphology of the as-prepared hybrid nanomaterials were characterized and confirmed by Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometry, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometry, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and Raman spectroscopic analysis.

MMAs provide two benefits: reflection of luminescence from nano-objects within MMAs toward the Si (001) surface normal and <b>nano-object</b> labeling. The former increases the probability of optics collecting luminescence and is demonstrated by simulations based on the ray-tracing and finite-difference time-domain methods {{as well as by}} experiments. The latter enables different measurements to be repeatedly performed on a single <b>nano-object</b> located at a certain micromirror.

40|$|International audienceModification of the {{plasmonic}} {{response of}} a metal <b>nano-object</b> due to interaction with a substrate is experimentally investigated measuring the quantitative optical extinction spectra of individual nano-objects with various elongated shapes (bipyramids and rods) deposited on a dielectric (silica) or absorbing (carbon) membrane. Apart from the expected {{dependence of the}} nanoparticle surface plasmon resonance (SPR) frequency {{on the nature of}} the substrate, large substrate and particle shape dependent modifications of its SPR width are demonstrated. These dependencies are ascribed to strong localization of the electromagnetic field associated with the longitudinal SPR of an elongated <b>nano-object</b> around its tips, leading to different interaction with the substrate depending on the particle shape and 3 D orientation relative to the substrate. Both parameters have been precisely determined by electron tomography, permitting excellent reproduction of the experimental data.

This unique TiO 2 <b>nano-object</b> is uniform in length and width as a "sheet-like" shape which is integrated with numerous discrete nanocrystalline subunits. In contrast with the internal architecture of the TiO 2 nanosheets produced under equilibrium and non-equilibrium conditions, the local structure collapse transformation mechanism from the hydrogen titanate nanosheet to the anatase TiO 2 nanosheet with internal architecture is discussed. This unique anatase <b>nano-object</b> electrode exhibits high reversible lithium ion storage capacities and superior cyclic capacity retention at a high current rate. Such enhanced lithium storage performance could be attributed to the discrete subunits aggregation allowing efficient Li + ion diffusion and the interior anisotropy in the nanosheet can be more effective to buffer the volume variation during the lithium insertion/desertion cycle. © 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry...|$|E

All the <b>nano-objects</b> have a single resonance in the F NMR spectrum with relatively short MRI relaxation times, which were independent of the morphology of the <b>nano-objects.</b> These results confirm that these polymeric <b>nano-objects</b> of varied morphologies are promising as F MRI imaging agents for use in tracking of cells and selective MRI...|$|R
40|$|A {{method for}} {{determining}} the critical values of the flow speed and the flow constriction degree characteristic of the alignment of cylindrical <b>nano-objects</b> in a flowing suspension is proposed. Previously, the alignment process of cylindrical <b>nano-objects</b> in suspensions was investigated by using birefringence of the polarized light and the small-angle X-ray scattering. While both methods are suitable for measuring the alignment degree of cylindrical <b>nano-objects</b> in suspensions diluted down to low concentrations, they are restricted for the application to undiluted concentrated suspensions because of non-transparency and multiple scattering of X-rays. In addition, {{the use of the}} second method requires an expensive synchrotron equipment. We present a simple and faster method based on the direct ultrasound attenuation measurements of longitudinal viscosity of a suspension containing cylindrical <b>nano-objects,</b> which decreases monotonically, approaching its asymptotic value with increase in the flow speed and the flow constriction degree. The principle and advantages of the proposed method are as follows: • The cylindrical <b>nano-objects</b> align along an accelerated flow at overcritical values of the flow speed and the constriction degree. • The critical values correspond to the state of a suspension possessing viscosity close to the asymptotic value. • The method is applicable to undiluted concentrated suspensions, including opaque ones...|$|R
40|$|A {{wide range}} of <b>nano-objects</b> are {{synthesized}} by combining template synthesis, using polycarbonate membrane as template, with different material deposition methods. The resulting nanostructures varied from robust inorganic gold nanowires grown by electrodeposition to rigid polypyrrole nanotubes synthesized by chemical polymerization and softer nanotubes made of different combinations of synthetic and natural polyelectrolytes fabricated by layer-by-layer (LbL) assembly. The morphology of these various <b>nano-objects</b> is characterized prior to and after their immersion in water, revealing that the rigidity degree of LbL nanotubes strongly decreases after being in contact with water, leading to highly swollen and flexible nanotubes in aqueous solution that tend to stick to any surface and {{are very difficult to}} collect and disperse quantitatively in aqueous solution. Different processes to collect these <b>nano-objects</b> and disperse them in aqueous medium for further analysis and application were then studied. Among them, a method based on simple filtration of nanotubes {{in the presence of a}} powdered dextran adjuvant leads to the quantitative collection and dispersion in water of all types of tested cylindrical <b>nano-objects.</b> This universal method to efficiently collect membrane templated <b>nano-objects</b> paves the way to further characterization of a large variety of nanotubes in aqueous solution and to their potential use as cargo nanocarriers or as nanoreactors...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} new paradigms for {{a particular}} class of non-prehensile manipulators of nanoscale objects that are limited to modelling accurately the relative motion of objects using continuous mechanics where the contact area is not presented. This restrictions results in models which have low accuracy {{and a lack of}} understanding about the real motion of the nanoscale object. The newly developed paradigms are focused on three topics: characterisation and analysis of forces present during motion at nanoscale in two dimensional space; characterisation and analysis of the quasi-static motion of nanoscale objects using the the instantaneous centre of rotation iCOR; and characterisation and analysis of the quasi-static,impulsive and dynamic motion of nanoscale objects using motion constraints and the iCOR. For characterisation and analysis of forces present on objects being manipulated at nanoscale, new models to characterise rolling and sliding motion are introduced. For the sliding case a relation between friction load (force and torque) and slip motion (displacement and rotation) for rigid <b>nano-object</b> sliding on a flat and a rough surface, where the distribution of the normal contact forces is assumed to be known a priori and the friction is assumed to be independent of slip rate is introduced. Every point of frictional contact is assumed to obey Coulomb’s friction law. A developed set of equations are solved, performing high accuracy integration techniques such as the Bulirsch-Stoer Method implemented on a computing programming language such as FORTRAN. The full relation between the frictional load and the slip motion for a <b>nano-object</b> can thus be described by its iCOR. A new methodology to model the quasi-static motion of nanoscale objects is presented from which are derived equations {{that can be used to}} approximate the trii bological parameters of the nano-objects being manipulated for known and unknown contact pressure distributions. The characterisation of the tribological parameters, such as the coefficient of friction μ, is obtained from generated maps using the applied force or the observed iCOR location of the <b>nano-object</b> being manipulated. The approach has several advantages, including simplicity, robustness, and an ability to simulate classes of systems that are difficult to simulate using spatial mechanics. The final part of this thesis introduces a novel constraint-based method in combination with a minimum force principle to locate the iCOR position for nano-objects at quasi-static motion. Furthermore, the iCOR location for impulsive and dynamic motion cases are introduced. The results generated by modelling these cases can describe the full motion of the manipulated <b>nano-object</b> and generate knowledge of their tribological parameters...|$|E

40|$|Under a {{rational}} design, combining multiple constituents {{into a single}} <b>nano-object</b> will not only bridge the unique properties of individual materials to leverage research both fundamentally and practically, but will also improve conventional sensing, imaging, and therapeutic efficacies. Such a <b>nano-object</b> (< 100 nm) can be constructed by covalently bonding ZnO quantum dots (QDs) to nonlinear poly(ethylene glycol) -based nanogel network chains, followed by appropriate growth of metallic Au. With the polymer gel network serving as a three-dimensional scaffold, the fluorescence of ZnO QDs can be well protected, while metal Au still retains its surface plasmon resonance property. The ZnO QDs covalently bonded to the thermo-responsive gel network chains can sensitively respond to temperature change of the surrounding fluids over the physiologically important range of 37 - 42 degrees C, converting the disruptions in homeostasis of local temperature into stable, robust and high-resolution fluorescent signals.

40|$|We propose an {{interferometric}} scheme {{based on}} an untrapped <b>nano-object</b> subjected to gravity. The motion {{of the center of}} mass (c. m.) of the free object is coupled to its internal spin system magnetically, and a free flight scheme is developed based on coherent spin control. The wave packet of the test object, under a spin-dependent force, may then be delocalized to a macroscopic scale. A gravity induced dynamical phase (accrued solely on the spin state, and measured through a Ramsey scheme) is used to reveal the above spatially delocalized superposition of the spin-nano-object composite system that arises during our scheme. We find a remarkable immunity to the motional noise in the c. m. (initially in a thermal state with moderate cooling), and also a dynamical decoupling nature of the scheme itself. Together they secure a high visibility of the resulting Ramsey fringes. The mass independence of our scheme makes it viable for a <b>nano-object</b> selected from an ensemble with a high mass variability.

Experiments were carried out at the JANNuS Orsay facility that enables in situ ion irradiations inside the microscope to be carried out. The majority of 4 MeV gold ions were transmitted through the thin foil, and the induced radiation defects were investigated by TEM. Observations showed that nano-void formation occurs at ambient temperature in UO 2 thin foils irradiated with energetic heavy ions under an essentially nuclear energy loss regime. The diameter and density of nano-objects were measured {{as a function of the}} gold irradiation dose at RT. A previous paper has also revealed a similar <b>nano-object</b> population after a Xe implantation performed at 390 keV at 870 K. The <b>nano-object</b> density was modelled using simple concepts derived from Classical Molecular Dynamics simulations.
