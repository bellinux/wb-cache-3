5|$|In May 1995, several Texas sports teams, {{including}} the Houston Rockets, proposed {{legislation that would}} dedicate state tax revenue to build new arenas. Although the bill was failed in the Texas House of Representatives, Rockets owner Leslie Alexander announced {{he would continue to}} study the possibility of constructing a <b>new</b> <b>arena</b> in downtown Houston, saying the 20-year-old Summit arena was too outdated to be profitable. Although the Summit's management said they could renovate the building for {{a small part of the}} cost of a <b>new</b> <b>arena,</b> the Rockets began talks with the city of Houston on a possible location for an arena, They also negotiated with Houston Aeros and Summit owner, Chuck Watson, to release them from their contract with the Summit, which ran until 2003.|$|E

5|$|Ottawa {{moved into}} their <b>new</b> <b>arena,</b> simply dubbed The Arena, with seating for 4,500 and {{standing}} room for 2,500. With the free agent signings and the <b>new</b> <b>arena,</b> Ottawa started selling season-tickets, {{the first of}} their kind, $3.75 for five games, eventually selling 2,400. The capacity was topped with a crowd of 7,100 in the home opener, attending {{a game against the}} Wanderers on January 11, which Ottawa won 12–2. However, Ottawa started the season with two losses out of three games and ended in second place behind the Wanderers again. Walsh tied for the scoring lead with 28 goals in 9 games (including 7 in one match), while Phillips was close behind at 26 goals in 10 games.|$|E
5|$|Progress {{was made}} towards the team's <b>new</b> <b>arena</b> on March 22, when the former St. Francis Hospital, {{across the street}} from Mellon Arena, was imploded. Following debris removal and site preparation, {{groundbreaking}} for construction began in the summer.|$|E
5|$|Rockets owner Leslie Alexander {{first began}} to request a <b>new</b> <b>arena</b> in 1995, and {{attempted}} to release the Rockets from their lease at The Summit, which ran until 2003. However, he was denied by arena owner Chuck Watson, then-owner of the Aeros, who also wanted control of a <b>new</b> <b>arena.</b> The two sides agreed to equal control over an arena in a deal signed in 1997, but the proposal was rejected by city voters in a 1999 referendum. It {{was not until the}} city and the Rockets signed an amended agreement in 2001, excluding the Aeros, that the proposal was accepted.|$|E

5|$|In the {{following}} season, Houston began playing in their <b>new</b> <b>arena,</b> the Toyota Center, and redesigned their uniforms and logo, as long-time coach Tomjanovich resigned after {{being diagnosed with}} bladder cancer, {{and was replaced by}} Jeff Van Gundy. The Rockets finished the regular season with a record of 45–37, and earned their first playoff berth since 1999, but the Lakers again handed the Rockets a loss in the first round.|$|E

5|$|Though it is Sweden's {{third most}} populous city, Malmö often missed the {{possibility}} to host larger concert and music events because it lacked a suitable indoor arena. When the City Tunnel project was initiated by Malmö Stad in the late 1990s, the city began to plan a new district in Hyllievång. This led to the decision to build Hyllie station in 2001, {{as a part of}} the tunnel project, to boost the development of the new district. The ice hockey club Malmö Redhawks, which was the proposed main tenant of the <b>new</b> <b>arena,</b> was initially uncertain of the new project and wanted to renovate its present home, the Malmö Isstadion, instead of moving to an entirely <b>new</b> <b>arena.</b> However, the Redhawks were convinced when Percy Nilsson of Parkfast AB contributed seven million kronor to help the club's financial situation.|$|E

The first work of the partnership was a <b>new</b> <b>arena,</b> the Ottawa Auditorium, which was a 7,500 seat (10,000 capacity with standing room) arena with artificial ice. The new Ottawa Auditorium's first regular season game came on December 26, 1923.

5|$|The ARS had the Blue Line end at Addison Road. However, {{sports fans}} {{continually}} {{argued for a}} three-mile (5km) extension to the Capital Centre sports arena in Largo, Maryland. On February 27, 1997, the WMATA board approved construction of the extension. By the time the extension opened in 2004, professional basketball and hockey had relocated to a <b>new</b> <b>arena</b> atop the Gallery Place Station and the Capital Centre was replaced with a shopping mall. However, the extension still drew considerable sport spectator traffic because it is {{within walking distance of}} the FedExField football stadium. The extension cost $456 million.|$|E
5|$|The BOK Tower, built {{during this}} period, is the 2nd tallest {{building}} in Oklahoma {{and the surrounding}} states of Missouri, New Mexico, Arkansas, and Kansas.
