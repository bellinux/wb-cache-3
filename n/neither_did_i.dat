25|$|There {{must have}} been sixty or seventy others, though Pressman did not {{necessarily}} know them all; <b>neither</b> <b>did</b> <b>I.</b> All were dues-paying members of the Communist Party. Nearly all were employed in the United States Government, some in rather high positions, notably in the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Justice, the Department of the Interior, the National Labor Relations Board, the Agricultural Adjustment Administration, the Railroad Retirement Board, the National Research Project — and others.|$|E
2500|$|Some saw the Defence Secretary post as {{a reward}} for Portillo's {{cautious}} loyalty to Major during the 1995 leadership challenge of John Redwood, following Major's [...] "back me or sack me" [...] resignation as party leader. Many urged Portillo, the [...] "darling of the right", to run against Major. He declined to enter the first round, but planned to challenge Major if the contest went to a second round. To this end, he set up a potential campaign headquarters, with banks of telephone lines. He later admitted that this had been an error: [...] "I did not want to oppose , but <b>neither</b> <b>did</b> <b>I</b> want to close the possibility of entering a second ballot if it came to that." [...] Portillo acknowledged that [...] "ambiguity is unattractive" [...] and his opponents within the party later used Portillo's apparent equivocation as an example of his indecisiveness; [...] "I appeared happy to wound but afraid to strike: a dishonourable position." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'What I {{mean to say}} is, I didn't toil, <b>neither</b> <b>did</b> <b>I</b> spin. Ah, {{them was}} happy days! Lying on me back, plenty of tobacco, {{something}} cool in a jug--' ...|$|E
60|$|LADY CHESHIRE. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not. <b>Neither</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> {{think she}} has been trapped. I think nothing. I {{understand}} nothing.|$|R
5000|$|... "I have {{as head of}} the House of Hohenzollern no {{political}} role — and <b>neither</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> aim at such." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>Neither</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> {{find any}} murmuring {{on some other}} points of greater importance, where this {{favourite}} maxim is not so strictly observed.|$|R
60|$|So, when I {{departed}} from them, the Book of Statute was brought, {{but what they}} said of it I know nothing at all, <b>neither</b> <b>did</b> <b>I</b> hear any more from them.|$|E
6000|$|... "No; <b>neither</b> <b>did</b> <b>I</b> think that: my niece, I felt sure, {{was safe}} from danger. I {{knew that she}} would do nothing that would bring either her or me to shame." ...|$|E
6000|$|FRANK. <b>Neither</b> <b>did</b> <b>I.</b> You are {{my first}} playmate. [He catches {{her hand to}} kiss it, but checks himself to look around first. Very unexpectedly, he sees Crofts {{emerging}} from the box hedge]. Oh damn! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "These are new notions," [...] {{said the}} old gentlewoman, shaking her head. [...] "I shall never {{understand}} them; <b>neither</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> wish it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... ‘I know not, <b>neither</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> care: {{but it must}} be {{a strange}} road, if <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not find it out before I have eaten up the monster’s carcase.’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, <b>I</b> <b>do</b> {{not believe}} Dunwoodie would sell his command as Arnold wished to do; <b>neither</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> think him exactly {{trustworthy}} in a delicate business like this of yours." ...|$|R
60|$|No one {{appeared}} {{to give any}} attention to me however, and then I listened for a proclamation by the town crier; but none met my ears, <b>neither</b> <b>did</b> <b>I</b> see printed notices of any kind referring to Archie.|$|E
6000|$|... "No more I did. <b>Neither</b> <b>did</b> <b>I</b> {{ever see}} Punch again till to-day, but I {{know for certain}} that my young lady never sold no dog wotsomedever to no low feller as ever walked in shoe leather or out of it!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do {{you think}} so? Well, she did not, <b>neither</b> <b>did</b> <b>I.</b> Indeed, {{she pointed out}} that this was her trouble. Among the great of the earth she knew no such man, and, if she sought lower, then would come jealousies and war." ...|$|E
6000|$|Then the Lady Elaine said: [...] "Messire, it was I {{who gave}} my sleeve to him, yet <b>neither</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> {{know who he}} is nor whence he came." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Assuredly not," [...] she replied, [...] "since to do {{so would}} be to insult you. But <b>neither</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> suppose that you really meant to offer me that place." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "About {{the duke}} she did. You know {{she never did}} like the duke; and for the matter of that, <b>neither</b> <b>do</b> <b>I.</b> I tell you that fairly, Master Mark!" ...|$|R
60|$|The man evidently did {{not know}} what to say, and as a matter of fact, <b>neither</b> <b>did</b> <b>I.</b> I had told him some plain truths, and now I was anxious to get away from him and think out my future course of action.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, <b>neither</b> <b>did</b> <b>I.</b> It's funny {{we should}} both sail under sealed orders {{from a man}} we don't know. He seemed an uppish old bird. His {{brothers}} of science don't seem too fond of him, either. How came you to {{take an interest in}} the affair?" ...|$|E
60|$|Now, indeed, was I in {{a pretty}} fix, for <b>neither</b> <b>did</b> <b>I</b> know which avenue to follow nor when danger lay {{directly}} in my path; {{but there was nothing}} else to be done than follow one of the corridors, for I could gain nothing by remaining where I was.|$|E
60|$|You say General Geary's scouts {{report that}} they find no enemy {{this side of the}} Blue Ridge. <b>Neither</b> <b>do</b> <b>I.</b> Have they been to the Blue Ridge looking for them.|$|R
6000|$|... "I really don't know," [...] Geoffrey replied. [...] "Having no time {{to waste}} in conversation, <b>neither</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> care. If you have {{anything}} to say to me you can say it--very briefly--here." ...|$|R
5000|$|Clauses that {{omit the}} verb, in {{particular}} those like me too, nor me, me neither. The latter forms are used after negative statements. (Equivalents including the verb: <b>I</b> <b>do</b> too or so <b>do</b> I; <b>I</b> don't either or <b>neither</b> <b>do</b> <b>I.)</b> ...|$|R
60|$|The fatuousness of {{all this}} made me stare. If the man had not been somehow a {{sympathetic}} personality I would have resented it like an insult. As it was, I felt only sorry for him. Something remarkably earnest in his gaze prevented me from laughing in his face. <b>Neither</b> <b>did</b> <b>I</b> yawn at him. I just stared.|$|E
60|$|But I must observe here, that I did {{not enter}} {{immediately}} into all this confidence with him neither, nor all at once; <b>neither</b> <b>did</b> <b>I</b> let him into any part of it, but under the same solemn engagements of secrecy that he had laid upon us, nor till I was come above eighty leagues south from Lima.|$|E
60|$|<b>Neither</b> <b>did</b> <b>I</b> do, what I {{know some}} did, keep the spirits {{high and hot}} with cordials and wine, and such things, and which, as I observed, one learned {{physician}} used himself so much to, as {{that he could not}} leave them off when the infection was quite gone, and so became a sot for all his life after.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, <b>neither</b> <b>do</b> <b>I.</b> I {{dreamed about}} rowing, but I can't, {{for the life}} of me, {{remember}} where I went. I must have gone a good way, for I blistered my hands with the oars." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'And after all, is {{it worth}} it?' I went on. 'What does life mean that it should make you sweat? What {{justification}} do you find in sweat? Now look at me. <b>I</b> toil not, <b>neither</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> spin--' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Wall, <b>neither</b> <b>do</b> <b>I,</b> privately speakin'. I was goin' ter say," [...] went on {{the ranch}} owner slowly, [...] "when the cap'n got the letters he walked over there to the old place and tore 'em open. Maybe----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It doesn't much {{matter who}} it was," [...] replied the doctor. And I {{could see that}} neither he nor the captain paid much regard to Mr. Trelawney's protestations. <b>Neither</b> <b>did</b> <b>I,</b> to be sure, he was so loose a talker; yet in this case I believe he was really right and that nobody had told the {{situation}} of the island.|$|E
6000|$|... "My Lord King," [...] cried De Montfort, {{flushing}} with anger, [...] "I called not {{upon this}} fellow, nor did I {{know he was}} within two hundred miles of Lewes until I saw him ride into {{the midst of the}} conflict that day. <b>Neither</b> <b>did</b> <b>I</b> know, until I heard his battle cry, whether he would fall upon baron or royalist." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{whole of}} this time my {{landlord}} and I spent in surveying the country, and viewing his plantation. As {{for the city of}} Villa Rica, it was not the most proper to go there in public, and the doctor knew that as well as the Spaniard, and, therefore, though we went several times incognito, yet it was of no consequence to me, <b>neither</b> <b>did</b> <b>I</b> desire it.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have never}} been beyond the sight of land, <b>neither</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> care {{to work in a}} shop; but I have {{business}} which admits of no delay, and if you will give me the information I shall be very grateful." ...|$|R
6000|$|Having {{observed}} this Dare replied, 'I, too, am a traveller; and <b>neither</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> swoon nor {{scream at}} what you say. But I assure {{you that if you}} busy yourself about me, you may truly be said to busy yourself about nothing.' ...|$|R
60|$|This {{he calls}} the Magic Square, but gives no Reason for the Term, nor any Account of what infernal Operations are wrought by this Concurrence of the Numbers; <b>neither</b> <b>do</b> <b>I</b> see {{that there can be}} any such Use made of it.|$|R
