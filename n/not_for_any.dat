5|$|At {{about the}} same time, backup {{receiver}} and redshirt freshman Jamere Holland was dismissed from the team, although <b>not</b> <b>for</b> <b>any</b> violation of team rules. He was allowed to stay on scholarship for the year. Holland redshirted the previous season after breaking his collarbone, reinjured it during spring practice and had clashed with coaches during his return to fall camp. He would later transfer to the University of Oregon.|$|E
5|$|The Prince Consort's and Queen Victoria's {{rooms in}} the keep are named after their use during the royal visit of 1842, {{although}} their decoration today dates from the interwar period. The Dining Room, Drawing Room and Ante Room, which overlook the northern bastion, date from the 1730s, when the Duke of Dorset constructed them to form a private set of chambers. These rooms feature a range of pink and purple window glass, which tradition says was installed by the Earl of Liverpool to protect his wife's eyesight; recent analysis shows {{that some of the}} pink-tinted glass dates from the 1730s, and discoloured naturally over time, while other panes were intentionally purchased around 1800 in these hues, but probably as status symbols and <b>not</b> <b>for</b> <b>any</b> medical purpose.|$|E
5|$|Walter {{also helped}} with the {{creation}} of a more professional group of royal justices. Although the group, which included Simon of Pattishall, Ralph Foliot, Richard Barre, William de Warenne, Richard Herriard, and Walter's brother Osbert fitzHervey, had mostly already served as justices prior to Walter's term of office, it was Walter who used them extensively. It appears likely that Walter chose them for their ability, <b>not</b> <b>for</b> <b>any</b> familial ties to himself. This group of men replaced the previous system of using mostly local men, and are the first signs of a professional judiciary.|$|E

25|$|The Russian abacus {{was brought}} to France around 1820 by the {{mathematician}} Jean-Victor Poncelet, who served in Napoleon's army and had been {{a prisoner of war}} in Russia. The abacus had fallen out of use in western Europe in the 16th century with the rise of decimal notation and algorismic methods. To Poncelet's French contemporaries, it was something new. Poncelet used it, <b>not</b> <b>for</b> <b>any</b> applied purpose, but as a teaching and demonstration aid. The Turks and the Armenian people also used abaci similar to the Russian schoty. It was named a coulba by the Turks and a choreb by the Armenians.|$|E
25|$|A second {{incident}} {{occurred when the}} king was expected to visit to unveil a statue of himself. A rumour spread about the school that someone intended to deface the statue just before the visit. Evan-Thomas attempted to prevent this by setting the staff on guard over the statue all night. The staff, being civilians, refused, and Evan-Thomas sacked them. Matters got into {{the press and the}} visit was cancelled, although this coincided with the national strike and the matter disappeared from public attention. In July 1912 Evan-Thomas was promoted to Rear-Admiral, <b>not</b> <b>for</b> <b>any</b> particular service but because it was his turn as the next most senior officer. He served on a committee, went on a training course, and then awaited a new command on half pay. In December 1913 he was appointed second in command of the first battle squadron of the Home fleet. Whether this appointment was encouraged by the king is uncertain, although royal intervention was certainly used to assist other naval officers at this time. Evan-Thomas record of achievement was sufficient in its own right to merit the appointment.|$|E

Moore judges that the article was neither well written nor particularly persuasive, but notes that other writers at the time made the connection between sport, cricket, the ideology of the British Empire and Fascism.|$|E

500|$|Historians such as Adams and Horrox {{believe that}} Richard lost the battle <b>not</b> <b>for</b> <b>any</b> mythic reasons, {{but because of}} morale and loyalty {{problems}} in his army. Most of the common soldiers {{found it difficult to}} fight for a liege whom they distrusted, and some lords believed that their situation might improve if Richard was dethroned. [...] According to Adams, against such duplicities Richard's desperate charge was the only knightly behaviour on the field. As fellow historian Michael Bennet puts it, the attack was [...] "the swan-song of [...] English chivalry". [...] Adams believes this view was shared at the time by the printer William Caxton, who enjoyed sponsorship from Edward IV and Richard III. Nine days after the battle, Caxton published Thomas Malory's story about chivalry and death by betrayal—Le Morte d'Arthur—seemingly {{as a response to the}} circumstances of Richard's death.|$|E

500|$|Despite {{the legends}} {{that have grown}} up about the Liberty Bell, it did not ring on July 4, 1776 (at least <b>not</b> <b>for</b> <b>any</b> reason {{connected}} with independence), as no public announcement {{was made of the}} Declaration of Independence. When the Declaration was publicly read on July 8, 1776, there was a ringing of bells, and while there is no contemporary account of this particular bell ringing, most authorities agree that the Liberty Bell was among the bells that rang. However, there is some chance that the poor condition of the State House bell tower prevented the bell from ringing. According to John C. Paige, who wrote a historical study of the bell for the National Park Service, [...] "We do not know whether or not the steeple was still strong enough to permit the State House bell to ring on this day. If it could possibly be rung, we can assume it was. Whether or not it did, it has come to symbolize all of the bells throughout the United States which proclaimed Independence." ...|$|E

[...] That same month, executive producer/showrunner Jeff Pinkner further commented on the episode chronology for the new season, [...] "It won't be the first episode, and it probably won't be the second, but it'll be somewhere in the first batch of episodes.

500|$|Critics {{consider}} EarthBound a [...] "classic" [...] or [...] "must-play" [...] among video games. The {{game was}} included in multiple top 50 games of all time lists, including that of Famitsu readers in 2006 and IGN readers in 2005 and 2006. IGN ranks the game 13th in its top 100 SNES games and 26th among all games for its in-game world, which was [...] "distinct and unforgettable" [...] for its take on Americanism, unconventional settings, and 1960s music. And Gamasutra named it one of its 20 [...] "essential" [...] Japanese role-playing games. The rerelease was Justin Haywald of GameSpot game of the year, and Nintendo Life Virtual Console game of the year. GameZone said it [...] "would be a great disservice" [...] to merely call EarthBound [...] "a gem". In the United Kingdom, where EarthBound had been previously unreleased, GamesTM noted how it had been [...] "anecdotally heralded as a retro classic". IGN's Scott Thompson said the game was [...] "the true definition of a classic". Kotaku wrote that the game was content to make the player [...] "feel lonely", and, overall, was special <b>not</b> <b>for</b> <b>any</b> individual aspect but for its method of using the video game medium to explore ideas impossible to explore in other media.|$|E
