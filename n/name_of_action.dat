It shows that we have in Miss Fitz Gerald a new singer of considerable ability and vigour of mind, and it serves to remind us of the splendid dramatic possibilities extant in life, which are ready for poetry, and unsuitable for the stage.

6000|$|Again {{to make a}} use {{which is}} not uninstructive of the old tongue, Emerson is for faith before works. Nature, he says, will not have us fret and fume. She does not like our benevolences, our churches, our pauper-societies, much better than she likes our frauds and wars. They are but so many yokes to the neck. Our painful labours are {{unnecessary}} and fruitless. A higher law than that of our will regulates events. If we look wider, things are all alike: laws and creeds and modes of living are a travesty of truth. Only in our easy, simple, spontaneous action are we strong, and by contenting ourselves with obedience we become strong. Our real action is in our silent moments.

40|$|Abstract Among linguistic-cognitive failures, the {{retelling of}} stories and lexical {{disorders}} occur from the onset of AD. Recent studies have discussed whether lexical failures in AD patients include naming actions. Objectives: The aims {{of this study were}} to verify <b>naming</b> and reformulation <b>of</b> <b>action</b> difficulties in AD patients and their relationship with the retelling of stories. Our main questions were: Are there two linguistic abilities impaired {{in the early stages of}} AD? Is there some correlation between the capacity <b>of</b> <b>naming</b> <b>actions</b> and the retelling of stories? Methods: We assessed 28 elderly participants: 17 with probable AD and 11 control subjects, with schooling ³ 4 years. The textual reading comprehension was measured using four stories with descriptive and narrative textual structure. The lexical production was verified by 17 actions on video, assessed by the participants' first and second verbal emissions. Results: The results showed that the retelling of stories is a task that discriminates patients with AD from healthy individuals. The <b>naming</b> and reformulation <b>of</b> <b>actions</b> tasks did not show significant differences among the patients and their controls. A positive correlation was found between the difficulties in retelling stories and the reformulation <b>of</b> the <b>naming</b> <b>of</b> <b>actions.</b> Conclusions: These results confirm previous findings that show the preservation <b>of</b> <b>naming</b> <b>actions</b> in patients with AD, which involve familiar actions, and that the retelling of short stories is an instrument that discriminates patients with AD from healthy elders. Results also suggest that the difficulties in retelling are related a breakdown in reformulating information, perhaps stemming from mechanisms of decreased memory work...|$|R

Both books are of a badness beyond the power of criticism properly to evoke—the prose flat and stilted... The main characters in a novel must necessarily have some kinship to the author, {{they come out of}} his body as a child comes from the womb, then the umbilical cord is cut, and they grow into independence. The more the author knows of his own character the more he can distance himself from his invented characters and the more room they have to grow in. With these early novels the cord has not been cut, and the author at twenty-six was as unreal to himself, in spite of psychoanalysis at sixteen, as Oliver Chant, the hero of The <b>Name</b> <b>of</b> <b>Action,</b> is to the reader. Chant is only a daydream in the mind of a young romantic author, for it takes years of brooding and of guilt, of self-criticism and of self-justification, to clear from the eyes the haze of hopes and dreams and false ambitions. I was trying to write my first political novel, knowing nothing of politics. I hope I did better many years later with The Quiet American, but how little I had learned of life and politics during three years in the sub-editors’ room of The Times.|$|E

40|$|Recent studies <b>of</b> <b>action</b> <b>naming</b> in {{dementia}} report contradictory results. Some {{studies have}} shown that <b>naming</b> <b>of</b> pictured <b>actions</b> is impaired and indeed worse than <b>naming</b> <b>of</b> pictured objects, whereas other studies report the opposite result, i. e. action naming is better preserved than object naming. One reason for these conflicting results may be that actions vary in their relationships with object knowledge. Instrumental actions, e. g. hammering, require access to knowledge about a specific object (a tool), whereas non-instrumental actions can be named correctly without access to knowledge about a specific object, e. g. running. Moreover, many instrumental action names share a name relationship with the instrument used to perform the action (homophony), whereas other action names do not, e. g. digging. In this case report, we describe an anomic patient RS with dementia affecting his access to knowledge about objects from visual, verbal and tactile input. By contrast, RS displays relatively well-preserved knowledge and <b>naming</b> <b>of</b> <b>actions.</b> We found an effect of instrumentality on pictured action naming, i. e. actions that depict an actor using a tool are named less accurately than actions that depict an actor performing an action without a tool. We argue that the instrumentality effect is independent <b>of</b> the <b>name</b> relationship between the action and the object and also the visual complexity <b>of</b> the <b>action.</b> We consider several explanations of the instrumentality effect and conclude that an impairment to the areas underpinning sensory feature and sensorimotor information (specific to manipulation) can account for an effect <b>of</b> instrumentality on <b>action</b> <b>naming</b> in dementia. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
