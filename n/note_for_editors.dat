And, {{when it comes}} to creativity, what are the real possibilities <b>for</b> <b>editor</b> to be creative and to express her or himself? These are some of the questions raised in master thesis by Petr Pauer, called ?<b>Notes</b> <b>for</b> young <b>editors!</b> ?. This ?handbook? is instruction tool about process of film production and creation which tries to answer more general questions and to react to various frustrations of young and beginning filmmakers. For example: How to deal with editors? claustrophobia? How to deal with directors? self-centeredness? Where to start, when you start editing the film?. It tries also to describe the principles of editing process which aims to be compatible with viewers experience as well as editing process which serves to director?s vision. Important issue it deals with is: Where do we draw inspiration to feel and understand film, do we unconsciously recall our deepest animal instincts or we base our understanding on ?database? of all the films we saw and all the frames and pictures that our eye and brain caught before. Or, should we reject all that has been made and go for new unrevealed possibilities? Author of this work creates his own dogma, he encourage reader to so called collective filmmaking and explains what it is and how it functions. In short, a new solution would be ?In order to be editor one has to be brave enough to undergo the path of humbleness and forget the fact {{that he or she is}} an individual with a lot of complexes.

According to {{the provisions of the}} Constitution effective in 1954, it is stipulated that government leaders should be elected by people’s representatives, and representatives should be chosen through primary elections in work units. Therefore, in the work-unit system, editors elected their representatives in the publishing houses, and these representatives elected government leaders. At the same time, the CCP, the Chinese Communist Youth League (CCYL), and other democratic parties all had their representative bodies in every work unit. Most editors intended to join either the CCP or the CCYL, for the reason that Party membership was a valuable political asset for their careers. Furthermore, every editor was obliged to attend political study meetings, and in doing so, the political control and management of editors by their work units was achieved. In every Chinese publishing house, editors were organized to study the Party’s documents; topmost leaders’ speeches; and government administrative orders, regulations, and policies (Warner 2000). In the political study meetings, editors were not only expected to express their attitudes toward the Party’s new guidelines but also were asked to examine the deviations of their behavior from the Party’s guidelines and to make self-criticism. It is important to <b>note</b> that <b>for</b> <b>editors,</b> both their participation and performance in the political study meetings were considered vital elements in the evaluation process for their job promotion, their salary and bonus rises, and their applications for Party membership.|$|R

T“Use Of Convergent Mobile Technologies For Sustainable Economic Transformation In The Lives Of Small Farmers In Rural India” is the third paper for “Notes for Editor” section of TOJDE’s in this issue. It has written by C. S. H. N. Murthy, Professor in Journalism and Mass Communication from Institute of Management Studies, India. An article points out that a visualization of such an optimistic design of use of convergent mobile technologies. The first article is from Australia which on “Turkish Online Journal of Distance Education” approaches its tenth year, it seemed appropriate to assess to what extent its original goals had been achieved by conducting a content analysis of the <b>Notes</b> <b>for</b> <b>Editors</b> and articles in the issues of appearing between January 2000 and October 2008. This content explores that the majority of articles were from Asian countries, with Turkey providing the greatest number of contributions. There were also many papers from the Middle East, Africa, South America, USA, Eastern and Western Europe, and Australia. These articles covered a very wide range of topics and while the quality varied, there has been a appreciable improvement in the research and reporting since the journal’s inception. Some of the papers, presenting non-Western perspectives, are particularly illuminating. The earlier articles tended to be descriptive or theoretical, but the more recent papers have been quantitative-experimental and qualitative-descriptive studies into distance education and e-learning needs, policies, procedures, practices and outcomes. The Second article is on “A Comparative Survey On Mind Mapping Tools”, written by Dr. Avgoustos A. TSINAKOS and Thanasis BALAFOUTIS from Greece. As you remember Avgoustos A.

The fifth article came from Norway and written on Technology And Teaching In Post-Modern Environments-Or Rhetoric Negotiations of Education, by Geir HAUGSBAKK, from Faculty of Social Sciences, Lillehammer University College, NORWAY. He mentioned in his article that developments concerning technology and education during recent decades can most adequately be understood as a rhetorically based negotiation between two basic, antagonistic positions. The first position is grounded in perspectives of “the industrial society”, the other one in notions of “the learning society”, Then, tendencies described in the article are presented as overall trends within education, but the use of new technology to a large extent seems to be connected to new and more flexible educational methods and elements of distance education. The sixth article which is entitled as “A Simulation On Teaching Volhard Method”, chemistry education and written by Celal BAYRAK, Nilgün SECKEN, Funda OZCAN OZTURK and Evrim URAL ALSAN,Ankara, TURKEY.

40|$|Industry {{claims that}} poker machine reform will cost $ 5 billion {{can only be}} {{described}} as fanciful, with a new analysis by The Australia Institute showing that the cost is likely to be between $ 171 million and $ 342 million. The Institute’s Executive Director Dr Richard Denniss said the $ 5 billion estimate is an exaggeration based on the cost of introducing a policy that no-one is actually proposing. “The gambling industry has exaggerated the cost of poker machine reform in a number of ways. They have ignored the proposed phase-in periods and, in turn, ignored the fact that the cost of replacing machines is less for every year of service, and after seven years, non-compliant machines are replaced with new complaint machines at virtually no extra cost,” said Dr Denniss. “They have assumed that all machines will need to be individually updated when many machines can be reprogrammed en masse. And they have assumed that none of the machines currently installed have been designed to incorporate the required modifications. “The industry is clearly cherry picking the worst case data they can find, but the irony is that the more expensive they claim the reforms will be the more new jobs will be created by implementing the reforms,” said Dr Denniss. The Australian Hotels Association (AHA) has claimed that mandatory pre-commitment would require substantial software and hardware upgrades and, in some cases, the installation of brand new machines. If these costs amounted to $ 5 billion then more than 23, 000 jobs would be created in manufacturing, as well as jobs in the software industry.   “The gambling industry has said repeatedly that these reforms will impose large costs on the owners of poker machines, but what they have failed to mention is the huge amount of high skilled jobs that would be created if their worst fears are realised,” said Dr Denniss.   “At a time when Australian policy-makers are grappling with how to support the Australian manufacturing industry it is interesting that there hasn’t been more discussion of the potential for poker machine reform to generate the kind of high skilled jobs that the high exchange rate is pushing offshore. “Of course, one reason that there has been so little attention paid to the ability of poker machine reform to create more than 23, 000 jobs is that nobody in politics or business really believes it will cost $ 5 billion to upgrade existing machines. “Given that the Productivity Commission estimates that the costs of problem gambling are more than $ 4. 7 billion per year it would seem that Australia will be unambiguously better off if we proceed with this reform. It will clearly reduce the social costs of problem gambling and the reforms, depending on who you believe, will either be achieved at low cost or with substantial job creation,” concluded Dr Denniss Image: Kaptain Kobold / flickr <b>Notes</b> <b>for</b> <b>editors</b> The analysis was commissioned by the Stop the Loss Coalition.

The fourth <b>notes</b> <b>for</b> <b>Editor</b> written by Kadir ULUSOY on Open Education Students’ Perspectives on Using Virtual Museums Application in Teaching History Subjects. He is from Mersin University Faculty of Education, Mersin, TURKEY. The study was made to determine whether the attitudes of the open education faculty students, will be changed or not by virtual museum application. The pre-test and post-test model of the experimental design was used in the research. A significant difference was determined in the students’ opinions concerning the post test data’s prepared to measure the attitudes towards the history lesson after the application. As a result, the students had a favourable opinion on the virtual museum application in history lessons by observing variable documents and sources. The first article is a joint study which its authors are from Israel, on “Indicator For Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (Tpack) Evaluation of Online Tasks” written by Anat OSTER-LEVINZ and Aviva KLIEGER, Beit Berl Academic College. The aim of this study was indicated that the Information Communication Technology era teachers will have to wisely use the online environment in order to realize a new pedagogy. They found in their research that teachers can use this indicator for evaluating the quality of the tasks that were developed as well as to test the improvement that took place in their tasks over time. The Second article is on “The Use of Facebook For Online Discussions Among Distance Learners”, written by Tina LIM, Open University Malaysia, MALAYSIA.

The third articles are from Anadolu University, Turkey. The third one is on “Choice of Instructional Media of B. Ed. Students of IGNOU from Two Indian Metropolises”, conducted by Sutapa BOSE, Faculty, School of Education, Indira Gandhi National Open University, New Delhi, INDIA and Parveen SHARMA, Faculty, Hindu College of Education, INDIA. In their paper; A survey was undertaken to determine the extent of utilization of instructions provided through various media by the students of B. Ed of two Indian metropolises –Delhi and Kolkata, having high penetration of advanced communication technologies. As the students of B. Ed. happen to be teachers who are supposed to be using ICT for teaching in their schools, the survey aimed to determine whether they were also using ICT for learning. The survey was carried out with a questionnaire with closed and open ended questions. It was found that only print medium was used for learning while the other media of the multimedia package remained mostly unused. The reason for this trend was found to be mainly the perception that the print medium is sufficient for assessment purposes. The 4 th article arrived from Bangladesh, which is prepared on “Strategic Intervention of ODL In Bangladesh”, written by A. Q. M.

This paper first presents an overview of the concepts of assessment and evaluation in Open and Distance Learning (ODL) environment. The large numbers of students and numerous courses make assessment and evaluation very difficult and administrative nightmare at Distance Learning (DL) institutions. For validity to be high in ODL assessment, assessment must provide the appropriate situation possible for measuring the specific abilities being measured. It is hoped that these strategies if adopted have the potentials to eliminate some of the challenges that ODL institutions are currently facing in assessment. It will also strengthen quality assurance mechanism in ODL institutions.
