After that, she <b>gets</b> <b>a</b> job working with silk worms, but she and the other girls who work there are treated horribly. Chu Ju eventually writes a letter in protest of their unfair treatment, since {{she is the only}} one who knows how to write (her parents paid for her schooling, even though girls didn't normally receive educations). The girls are treated somewhat better, but Chu Ju loses her job. Subsequently, Chu Ju meets a woman named Han <b>Na</b> and <b>gets</b> <b>a</b> job helping her with her rice paddies. Han Na comes to love Chu Ju as a daughter, so when she dies, Han Na leaves land for Chu Ju. Four years after she secretly left home, Chu Ju decides to go home to visit her family. Her parents are overjoyed to see her. Chu Ju is relieved to see that her little sister, Hua, is safe and was not sent away. Chu Ju's mother has also had another baby when she was away. She gave birth to another girl named Nu Hai, but this one is going to stay in their family, even if it means they will break tradition because there will be no son in their family. After Chu Ju's visit with her family, Chu Ju goes back to her rice paddies determined to save up money to pay for her sisters' educations.|$|R

40|$|Non-innocent ligands are a {{hot topic}} in {{homogeneous}} catalysis, due to their attractive ability of storing and releasing electrons during the catalytic cycle, conferring noble character to first row transition metals. In this work, a comprehensive overview of the redox active ligand bis(methyl benzimidazolyl) ketone and its Fe complex is presented. The electronic properties of the ligand and the complex, were investigated using cyclic voltammetry (CV). They {{were found to be}} quasi-reversible, with a reduction potential of - 1. 75 V and - 1. 08 V, respectively. The complex showed a ligand-centred reduction. Electronic behaviours of the ligand and complex were probed also with scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS), and the positions of their LUMO were identified at 2. 07 V and 1. 15 V. CV and STS data for the free ligand were compared, showing agreement in the results. The reduction of the ligand was further studied by actually reducing it with <b>Na(s),</b> <b>getting</b> to <b>a</b> doubly and a singly reduced species. These species were both analysed with electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (EPR). The unpaired electron was found to be delocalized over the aromatic system of the ligand. The complex was synthesised on surface via lateral manipulation of single molecules and individual iron atoms. Inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy (IETS) on the complex, showed signals due to frustrated external vibrations of the molecule. IETS features on the Fe position may be related to Kondo resonance or convolution of substrate-ligand vibrations...|$|R
