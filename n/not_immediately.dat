Washington had all of his troops in the city on their way to north along the westside of Manhattan to Harlem Heights by 4:00 pm and they all reached the fortifications on the Heights by nightfall.|$|E
5|$|Although he {{left his}} bass and {{amplifier}} at home in Oadby, after {{less than a year}} of studying in London, he decided he wanted to join a band. By 1970, Freddie Mercury, Brian May, and Roger Taylor had already formed Queen; Deacon saw them in October that year but was <b>not</b> <b>immediately</b> impressed. Later in the year, he briefly formed a band called Deacon that made one live appearance at Chelsea College.|$|E
5|$|Although <b>not</b> <b>immediately</b> threatened, crested and marbled newts {{suffer from}} {{population}} declines, caused mainly by habitat loss and fragmentation. Both their aquatic breeding sites and the cover-rich, natural landscapes upon which they depend during their terrestrial phase are affected. All species are legally protected in Europe, {{and some of}} their habitats have been designated as special reserves.|$|E

5|$|Because of his soft-spoken demeanor, Day's accomplishments were <b>not</b> <b>immediately</b> {{recognized}} {{as opposed to}} other elite pitchers of the league like Satchel Paige. Nonetheless, Day {{is considered one of}} the best pitchers of the Negro leagues, equaling and sometimes surpassing the abilities of his rivals. In 1995, Day was elected into the Baseball Hall of Fame, just six days before his death at 78 years old.|$|E
5|$|Despite Sakonju's fears, the Allies were <b>not</b> <b>immediately</b> {{aware of}} the attack on Behar. Her {{distress}} signal had been picked up by only a single Allied merchant ship, which did not report it until she arrived at Fremantle on 17March. In the meantime, Somerville had decided on 16March that surface raiders no longer posed a threat to shipping in the Indian Ocean and allowed Allied vessels to resume their normal routing.|$|E
5|$|Female orangutans have eight-year {{intervals}} between births, {{the longest}} interbirth intervals among the great apes. Unlike many other primates, male orangutans {{do not seem}} to practice infanticide. This may be because they cannot ensure they will sire a female's next offspring because she does <b>not</b> <b>immediately</b> begin ovulating again after her infant dies.|$|E

5|$|In 1926, West Mersea {{became a}} self-governing urban district, which {{allowed it to}} set up a {{self-contained}} water and sewer system. Unlike several other coastal resorts, the island did <b>not</b> <b>immediately</b> develop any holidaymaker facilities aside from the beach huts which now stretch along the Esplanade.|$|E
5|$|On 2 December Hague {{announced}} {{the results of}} the joint investigation, which concluded that Norgrove was accidentally killed by a grenade thrown by a US sailor.

Zorzi did <b>not</b> <b>immediately</b> get out of his car as he could not disconnect the oxygen pipe from his helmet.|$|E
5|$|One complication—unintentional and unrecognized {{intubation}} of the esophagus—is both common (as frequent as 25% in {{the hands}} of inexperienced personnel) and likely to result in a deleterious or even fatal outcome. In such cases, oxygen is inadvertently administered to the stomach, from where it cannot be taken up by the circulatory system, instead of the lungs. If this situation is <b>not</b> <b>immediately</b> identified and corrected, death will ensue from cerebral and cardiac anoxia.|$|E

5|$|Scholars have {{developed}} a number of hypotheses to explain the historical origins of agriculture. Studies of the transition from hunter-gatherer to agricultural societies indicate an antecedent period of intensification and increasing sedentism; examples are the Natufian culture in southwest Asia, and the Early Chinese Neolithic in China. Current models indicate that wild stands that had been harvested previously started to be planted, but were <b>not</b> <b>immediately</b> domesticated.|$|E
5|$|The Superbas lodged a {{complaint}} against the Reds, claiming that Kelley was still under their control, seeking compensation from the Reds. However, the other NL owners saw the situation as a coup for their league, and compelled Hanlon to drop his complaint.

Kelley joined the Reds on July 31.|$|E

5000|$|Slow {{response}} - sideways acceleration does <b>not</b> start <b>immediately</b> {{when the}} steering is turned and may <b>not</b> stop <b>immediately</b> {{when it is}} returned to center. This is partly caused by body roll. Other causes include tires with high slip angle, and yaw and roll angular inertia. Roll angular inertia aggravates body roll by delaying it. Soft tires aggravate yaw angular inertia by waiting for the car to reach their slip angle before turning the car.|$|R
