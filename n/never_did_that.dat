500|$|Aguilera's {{new image}} was so widely {{rejected}} by the public that it began to overshadow her music. Tim Walker from The Independent wrote: [...] " [...] simulated masturbation while wearing {{little more than a}} pair of leather chaps." [...] Entertainment Weekly described Aguilera's image in the video as [...] "the world's skeeziest reptile woman," [...] and The Village Voice captioned her as a xenomorph from the Alien series. Aguilera's contemporaries Shakira, Kelly Osbourne, and Jessica Simpson expressed disapproval of the video. Time magazine commented that [...] "she appeared to have arrived on the set... direct from an intergalactic hooker convention." [...] Jancee Dunn of Rolling Stone dubbed the video [...] "Girls Gone Wild: Beyond Thunderdome". Writer Emma Forrest remarked: [...] "What she's depicting is subcultures within sexuality, and {{to say that this is}} normal young woman's sexuality is just not fair. ... Even Madonna <b>never</b> <b>did</b> <b>that</b> to girls." [...] Aguilera told Blender in response to the criticism: ...|$|E
2500|$|I {{remember}} Jimmy had {{a little}} bit of trouble with the solo on [...] "Stairway to Heaven"... e hadn't completely figured it out. Nowadays you sometimes spend a whole day doing one thing. Back then, we <b>never</b> <b>did</b> <b>that.</b> We never spent a very long time recording anything. I remember sitting in the control room with Jimmy, he's standing there next to me and he'd done quite a few passes and it wasn't going anywhere. I could see he was getting a bit paranoid and so I was getting paranoid. I turned around and said [...] "You're making me paranoid!" [...] And he said, [...] "No, you're making me paranoid!" [...] It was a silly circle of paranoia. Then bang! On the next take or two he ripped it out.|$|E
2500|$|When Vidal was in {{the band}} Gemstone, she {{recorded}} songs with herself as well as bandmate Jade Villalon performing vocals. A few of these tracks would surface many years later on albums consisting of demoes, rare tracks, and special songs of Villalon's music project, Sweetbox. In 2002, she was briefly signed to MCA Records {{and in that time}} she was supposed to release her first single [...] "Tropical" [...] and her solo debut album White in the summer of 2002, but <b>never</b> <b>did.</b> <b>That</b> same year she provided guest vocals on the remix of Will Smith's summer hit [...] "Black Suits Comin' (Nod Ya Head)" [...] from the Men in Black II soundtrack. She was a part of Lupe Fiasco's 1st & 15th Entertainment. She also recorded a track for the work out cd called Byou from Sabrina Bryan of the Cheetah Girls. The song she recorded was [...] "Anything Is Possible". She also sang the song [...] "Take Me Away" [...] in the movie Freaky Friday.|$|E
5000|$|In 2003 David Coulthard {{admitted}} for {{the first}} time the crash at Spa was his fault: [...] "The reality is that I lifted to let him pass me, but I lifted in heavy spray on the racing line. You should <b>never</b> <b>do</b> <b>that.</b> I would <b>never</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> now." ...|$|R

2500|$|NASCAR's new Compact Car {{category}} debuted at the Daytona International Speedway on January 31, 1960. The {{first of}} two races was a road course, which used a [...] portion of the high-banked tri-oval together with a twisting infield road for a lap distance of [...] The race length was 10 laps, [...] Averaging a speed of , Marvin Panch drove his Hyper-Pak into first place; all the Hyper-Paks swept the field taking the first seven places. The second race of the day used only the tri-oval track 20 laps on its full [...] length totaling [...] A multi-car accident on the fourth lap took out the four Valiant leaders including one driven by Richard Petty. Panch was not among them because car trouble delayed his start and he was busy passing slower cars {{from the rear of}} the field when the leaders crashed. After a restart, Panch worked to first place and stayed there averaging a speed of [...] The remaining Valiants placed 1-2-3 and Panch again went into the winner's circle. Maxwell again recalls that [...] "It was a Plymouth runway. We finished first through seventh. Our cars were so fast, NASCAR <b>never</b> <b>did</b> <b>that</b> race again." ...|$|E

60|$|He {{fell into}} a short mood of dejection. And, indeed, I could not but reflect {{that much of the}} {{character}} fitted him like a jacket. Not the betrayal of his country. He <b>never</b> <b>did</b> <b>that,</b> no matter how roundly they accused him of it afterward.|$|E
6000|$|As for Miriam, she overflowed with delight. The ocean was grand, but Cobhurst was Cobhurst. [...] "There {{was nothing}} better about my trip than the {{opportunity}} {{it gave me}} of coming back to my home. I <b>never</b> <b>did</b> <b>that</b> before, you know, my children." ...|$|E

60|$|Willy earnestly inquired {{after her}} health, and said how glad {{she was to}} see her, but Mrs. Cliff did not listen. She looked about her. For an instant she thought that {{possibly}} the train had come in ahead of time, but this, of course, was absurd--trains <b>never</b> <b>did</b> <b>that.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Said she, [...] "He {{loved me}} <b>never,</b> <b>Did</b> <b>that</b> great oak tree, But I'm neither rich nor clever, And {{so why should}} he?

6000|$|It is evident, Friedrich had {{not given}} up his hope (indeed, for above a year more, he <b>never</b> <b>did)</b> <b>that</b> England might, by profuse bribery,--"such the power of bribery in that mad court!"--assuage, overnet with backstairs packthreads, or in some way compesce the Russian {{delirium}} for him. And England, his sole Ally in the world, still tender of Austria, and unable to believe what the full intentions of Austria are; England demands much wariness in his procedures towards Austria; reiterating always, [...] "Wait, your Majesty!

I shall pray for you, that you well know. Pray for yourself, for this is a real crisis of life. God bless you, my dear boy.' He laid his hand on the head, and Fernando looked up gratefully, then said, 'You <b>never</b> <b>did</b> <b>that</b> before. May Lance come to me, if he has not gone?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Why, the {{annoying}} quality in YOU, is,' {{said the old}} man, 'that you never have a confederate or partner in YOUR juggling; you would deceive everybody, even those who practise the same art; and have a way with you, as if you--he, he, he!--as if you really believed yourself. I'd lay a handsome wager now,' said the old man, 'if I laid wagers, which I don't and <b>never</b> <b>did,</b> <b>that</b> you keep up appearances by a tacit understanding, even before your own daughters here. Now I, when I have a business scheme in hand, tell Jonas what it is, and we discuss it openly. You're not offended, Pecksniff?' ...|$|E

60|$|But {{however much}} {{inclined}} the good man {{was to be}} jocose and playful, and {{in the garden of}} his fancy to disport himself (if one may say so) like an architectural kitten, he had one impediment constantly opposed to him. The gentle Cherry, stung by a sense of slight and injury, which far from softening down or wearing out, rankled and festered in her heart--the gentle Cherry was in flat rebellion. She waged fierce war against her dear papa, she led her parent what is usually called, {{for want of a better}} figure of speech, the life of a dog. But <b>never</b> <b>did</b> <b>that</b> dog live, in kennel, stable-yard, or house, whose life was half as hard as Mr Pecksniff's with his gentle child.|$|E
60|$|In a sense, {{the volcano}} was company {{to him in}} the shades of the night--which were often too thick, one would think, to let a breath of air through. There was seldom enough wind to blow a feather along. On most evenings of the year Heyst could have sat outside with a naked candle to read one of the books left him by his late father. It was not a mean store. But he <b>never</b> <b>did</b> <b>that.</b> Afraid of mosquitoes, very likely. Neither was he ever tempted by the silence to address any casual remarks to the {{companion}} glow of the volcano. He was not mad. Queer chap--yes, that may have been said, and in fact was said; but there is a tremendous difference between the two, you will allow.|$|E
60|$|It was {{a glorious}} June afternoon, and <b>never</b> <b>did</b> <b>that</b> solitary {{sheet of water}} seem less like an arena of strife and bloodshed. The light air scarce descended as low as {{the bed of the}} lake, {{hovering}} over it, as if unwilling to disturb its deep tranquillity, or to ruffle its mirror-like surface. Even the forests appeared to be slumbering in the sun, and a few piles of fleecy clouds had lain for hours along the northern horizon like fixtures in the atmosphere, placed there purely to embellish the scene. A few aquatic fowls occasionally skimmed along the water, and a single raven was visible, sailing high above the trees, and keeping a watchful eye on the forest beneath him, in order to detect anything having life that the mysterious woods might offer as prey.|$|E
6000|$|... "I, my dear?" [...] {{she shook}} her head sadly. [...] "I shall <b>never</b> <b>do</b> <b>that.</b> I want you to speak frankly. It is much better that we should try to {{understand}} one another." ...|$|R
60|$|Why, it {{is running}} {{along the top of}} the water like a snake; and they <b>never</b> <b>do</b> <b>that.</b> Here it comes. It has got a long beak, like a snipe. Oh, let me see.|$|R
