5|$|Australia has {{maintained}} military forces since federation {{as a nation}} in January 1901. Shortly after Federation, the Australian Government established the Australian Army and Commonwealth <b>Naval</b> <b>Force</b> by amalgamating the forces each of the states had maintained. In 1911, the Government established the Royal Australian Navy, which absorbed the Commonwealth <b>Naval</b> <b>Force.</b> The Army established the Australian Flying Corps in 1912 although this separated to form the Royal Australian Air Force in 1921. The services were not linked by a single chain of command, as they each reported to their own separate Minister and had separate administrative arrangements. The three services saw action around the world during World War I and World War II, and took part in conflicts in Asia during the Cold War.|$|E

5|$|The {{history of}} the Royal Australian Navy traces the {{development}} of the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) from the colonisation of Australia by the British in 1788. Until 1859, vessels of the Royal Navy made frequent trips to the new colonies. In 1859, the Australia Squadron was formed as a separate squadron and remained in Australia until 1913. Until Federation, five of the six Australian colonies operated their own colonial <b>naval</b> <b>force,</b> which formed on 1 March 1901 the Australian Navy's (AN) Commonwealth <b>Naval</b> <b>Force</b> which received Royal patronage in July 1911 and was from that time referred to as Royal Australian Navy (RAN). On 4 October 1913 the new replacement fleet for the foundation fleet of 1901 steamed through Sydney Heads for the first time.|$|E
5|$|A Han <b>naval</b> <b>force</b> led by Zhuang Zhu {{departed}} from Shaoxing in northern Zhejiang towards Minyue.

5|$|After {{the end of}} {{the first}} Gulf War the Royal Australian Navy {{periodically}} deployed a ship to the Gulf or Red Sea to assist in maintaining sanctions against Iraq.

50|$|Due to {{political}} considerations, {{command of the}} <b>naval</b> <b>forces</b> in the region was split. Allied <b>Naval</b> <b>Forces</b> Southern Europe, at Naples, operated most of the NATO allies' <b>naval</b> <b>forces</b> in the Mediterranean under an Italian admiral. But due to the U.S. desire to retain control of their nuclear-armed <b>naval</b> <b>forces,</b> the United States Sixth Fleet reported directly to CinCAFSOUTH, supported by a separate headquarters named Naval Striking and Support Forces Southern Europe (STRIKFORSOUTH).|$|R
5|$|The raid was {{postponed}} {{for several days}} after the 23 February rehearsal due to weather conditions, but on 27 February the weather proved to be ideal, with clear skies and good visibility for the aircraft of 51 Squadron, and a full moon which would provide illumination for the evacuation of the raiding force. The <b>naval</b> <b>force</b> under Commander Cook departed from Britain during the afternoon, and the Whitley transport aircraft carrying C Company took off from RAF Thruxton in the evening.|$|E
5|$|The villa {{was soon}} cleared of enemy troops once more, and when Frost {{returned}} to the beach, {{he found that the}} machine-gun nest had been destroyed by the mis-dropped troops of 'Nelson'; avoiding other enemy positions, they had reached the beach and attacked the machine-gun post from the flank. By this time it was 02:15 {{but there was no sign}} of the <b>naval</b> <b>force</b> that was to evacuate the airborne troops. Frost ordered 'Nelson' to guard the inland approaches to the beach and then fired off an emergency signal flare; soon after that the <b>naval</b> <b>force</b> was seen approaching. The original plan for the operation had called for two landing craft at a time to land on the beach, but this had never been satisfactorily achieved during training; instead, all six landing craft landed at the same time, with the covering troops in the landing craft opening fire on German soldiers gathering at the top of the cliff.|$|E
5|$|This was {{a result}} of the attacks from Midway, {{as well as of the}} morning flight leader's {{recommendation}} of a second strike. Re-arming had been under way for about 30 minutes when, at 07:40, the delayed scout plane from Tone signaled that it had sighted a sizable American <b>naval</b> <b>force</b> to the east, but neglected to describe its composition.

5|$|Æthelstan invaded Scotland {{with a large}} {{military}} and <b>naval</b> <b>force</b> in 934.

Æthelstan evidently travelled through Beverley, Ripon and Chester-le-Street. The army harassed the Scots up to Kincardineshire and the navy up to Caithness but Æthelstan's force was never engaged.|$|E
5|$|A Venetian fleet forced Vatatzes' {{naval forces}} to withdraw, {{but after the}} Venetians {{departed}} for home the Greeks and Bulgarians besieged Constantinople again in November 1235.

A combined <b>naval</b> <b>force</b> from Venice, Genoa, Pisa and Geoffrey II of Achaea broke through the blockade.
