The transformation of cells is {{primarily due to}} molecular aberrations leading to excessive cellular signalling and proliferation. In addition cytokines and their receptors {{may play a role}} in leukaemogenesis by increasing the proliferative capacity of leukaemic cells and extending their life span. Chemotherapeutic agents are regularly used to treat patients with leukaemia but they are <b>non-discriminatory</b> <b>treatments</b> that kill both healthy and cancer cells. Consequently patients receiving chemotherapy suffer unwanted toxicities in both the haematological and other systems. Therapies that specifically target malignant cells sparing normal cells are being investigated in a number of contexts. Cytokine antagonists can target growth factor-dependent cells by obstructing the interaction between cytokine and receptor. In this review we will discuss the myeloproliferative disorders in particular the leukaemias, the cytokines involved in leukaemogenesis, and the therapeutic potential of new agents that block specific cytokines.

40|$|Modern {{scientific}} {{medicine is}} increasingly challenged by complementary and alternative therapies. Reviewing policy options for contemporary healthcare development, the World Health Organization's first global strategy on traditional and alternative medicine, released in May 2002, advocates integration. However, experience in East Asia, {{the only part}} of the world where state of the art modern scientific facilities are commonly found alongside thriving traditional practices, reveals that medical integration can take several forms. To clarify the available policy options, this article categorizes those forms, identifying three types of integration (unification, equalization and subjugation), plus one type of non-integration (marginalization). It marks out a zone of balanced healthcare development that cuts across two of the integrationist types, and comprises <b>non-discriminatory</b> state <b>treatment</b> of separate but linked sectors of traditional and modern medicine. The article closes by exploring arguments for and against locating state policy in this zone, and holds that policy should be situated here for medical practices that can meet broadly acceptable professional standards, demonstrate an existing social demand, and generate an adequate supply of medical practitioners, possibly through some state subsidy. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|This study {{addresses}} {{the impact of}} industrial upgrading on firm performance. It puts forward a general hypothesis which states that linkages of firms with other firms or economic agents, either globally or domestically, should facilitate the upgrading process. The empirical results based on the survey of 150 respondents provide some support to this. In particular, and among others, foreign or joint venture firms {{seem to have been}} more successful than domestic firms in conducting industrial upgrading. The study also found some supportive argument based on a few in-depth interviews on the importance of the linkages. Specifically, having an export market orientation and a motivation to improve competitiveness encourages firms to upgrade their production capability, particularly in terms of the technology of their machinery. Based on the key findings, this study puts forward some policy recommendations. One, the government needs to increase the level of foreign direct investment (FDI) as well as domestic direct investment, and to create a more liberal FDI policy such as <b>non-discriminatory</b> national <b>treatment</b> and liberal negative investment list.

40|$|This thesis {{questions}} {{the prospects for}} the World Trade Organisation, Agreement on Government Procurement. This {{is the most important}} international agreement seeking to promote cross-border trade in hitherto closed national procurement markets. For the above threshold goods, services and construction services contracts which it covers, the Agreement's principal objective is to require the <b>non-discriminatory</b> <b>treatment</b> of foreign suppliers. It is because of this general insistence on <b>non-discriminatory</b> <b>treatment</b> that the Agreement's membership is limited to 27 of the 134 World Trade Organisation Members. The first theme of this thesis is therefore devoted to explaining this problem of limited membership, and to proposing possible solutions. While the Agreement's limited membership means that it is not yet capable of liberalising international procurement markets among the general WTO membership, the thesis also considers the Agreement's prospects among the major trading partners which have acceded to date. Our second theme therefore explores two of the problematic areas presenting very different difficulties and challenges, which will impact on the Agreement's success among its present and prospective Members. These distinct areas are, firstly, the use of information technology in public contract awards, and, secondly, the need for an effective system of remedies and enforcement...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} Manawatu tenants' {{awareness and}} knowledge of the Residential Tenancies Act 1986, as well as tenants' attitudes and experiences of renting within the private residential market. It is based upon the responses of five tenants, four housing workers and two government housing officials to questions asked in semi-structured interviews. The Residential Tenancies Act 1986 has been in force for ten years, but are tenants any the wiser? This is a particularly important question, given changes in housing policies and the state's withdrawal from the direct provision of housing assistance as it looks to the private rental market to pick up the slack. The findings reported in this study indicate: that tenants, in the main, conducted their rental affairs from a position of ignorance; and that those tenants who were uncertain about their rights and obligations were reluctant to seek advice on tenancy matters, or to pursue any formal line of complaint in case they faced eviction. If tenants expect to receive fair and <b>non-discriminatory</b> <b>treatment</b> in their relationship with private landlords, they need at the very least to be aware not only of tenancy law, but their rights and obligations therein. Therefore, the dynamics and tensions that exist between tenants' knowledge of the law and their relationship with private landlords, fee-paying letting agencies and state functionaries, form a central part of this thesis...|$|E

Yet questions related to policy consistency, legal certainty and fair and <b>non-discriminatory</b> <b>treatment</b> in working and living standards still characterise the EU’s legal framework for cross-border mobility. This book critically explores the extent to which EU legal migration policies and their underlying working notions match the transnational mobility of individuals today. It addresses the main challenges of economic migration policies, both within the EU and in the context of EU cooperation with third countries. Special consideration is given to the compatibility of EU policies with international labour standards along with the fundamental rights and approach to fairness laid down in the EU Treaties. The contributions to this book showcase the various uses and potential of social science and humanities research in assessing, informing and shaping EU migration policies. Leading scholars and experts have brought together the latest knowledge available to reappraise the added value of the EU in this area.

40|$|The {{last two}} decades have {{witnessed}} an extensive growth in foreign direct investment (FDI) flows to developing countries. This {{has been accompanied by}} an increase in competition amongst the developing countries to attract FDI, resulting in higher investment incentives offered by the host governments and removal of restrictions on operations of foreign firms in their countries. This has also led to an ever-increasing number of bilateral investment treaties (BITs) and regional agreements on investments. In this scenario, the question addressed by the study is: How effective are these selective government policies and investment agreements in attracting FDI flows to developing countries and do FDI from developed and developing countries respond similarly to developing host countries' policies? To answer this, the study examines the impact of fiscal incentives offered, removal of restrictions and signing of bilateral and regional investment agreements with developed and developing countries on FDI inflows to developing countries, after controlling for the effect of economic fundamentals of the host countries. The analysis is first undertaken for aggregate FDI inflows to fifteen developing countries of South, East and South East Asia for the period 1980 - 81 to 1999 - 2000. Separate analyses are then undertaken for FDI from developed and developing countries. The results based on random effects model show that fiscal incentives do not have any significant impact on aggregate FDI, but removal of restrictions attracts aggregate FDI. However, FDI from developed and developing countries are attracted to different selective policies. While lowering of restrictions attract FDI from developed countries, fiscal incentives and lower tariffs attract FDI from developing countries. Interestingly, BITs, which emphasize <b>non-discriminatory</b> <b>treatment</b> of FDI, are found to {{have a significant impact on}} aggregate FDI. But it is BITs with developed countries rather than developing countries that ar found to have a significant impact on FDI inflows to developing countriesForeign Direct Investment, selective government policies, Bilateral Investment, Treaties, FDI from Developed and developing countries...|$|E

40|$|This book {{offers a}} {{systematic}} analysis {{of the interaction between}} international investment law, investment arbitration and human rights, including the role of national and international courts, investor-state arbitral tribunals and alternative jurisdictions, the risks of legal and jurisdictional fragmentation, the human rights dimensions of investment law and arbitration, and the relationships of substantive and procedural principles of justice to international investment law. Part I summarizes the main conclusions of the 24 book chapters and places them into the broader context of the principles of justice, global administrative law and multilevel constitutionalism that may be relevant for the administration of justice in international economic law and investor-state arbitration. Part II includes contributions clarifying the constitutional dimensions of transnational investment disputes and investor-state arbitration, as reflected in the increasing number of arbitral awards and amicus curiae submissions addressing human rights concerns. Part III addresses the need for principle-oriented ordering and the normative congruence of diverse national, regional and worldwide legal regimes, focusing on the pertinent dispute settlement practices and legal interpretation methods of regional economic courts and human rights courts, which increasingly interpret international economic law with due regard to human rights obligations of the governments concerned. Part IV includes twelve case studies on the potential human rights dimensions of specific protection standards (e. g. fair and equitable treatment, non-discrimination), applicable law (e. g. national and international human rights law, rules on corporate social accountability), procedural law issues (e. g. amicus curiae submissions) and specific fundamental rights (e. g. the protection of human health, access to water, and protection of the environment). These case studies discuss not only the still limited examples of human rights discourse in investor-state arbitral awards; they also probe the potential legal relevance of investor-state arbitration for the judicial recognition, interpretation and balancing of primary rules, such as of investment law and human rights law, {{in the light of the}} principles of justice as defined by national and international law.
