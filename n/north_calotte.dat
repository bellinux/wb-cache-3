40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} Coastal {{identities in}} the modern age - the case of Storfjord in Northern Norway as studied in 2009. Populations in the coastal areas of Northern Norway {{are more or less}} a mixture of Coastal Sami, Kven and Norwegian. Historically, it might be analyzed as some results of the encounters of three ethnic groups; the Coastal Sami, Kven and Norwegian historically. Therefore, there is a natural tendency to choose a “both–and” ethnicity. However, the Coastal Sami and Kven experienced the worst form of the Norwegianization policy until the last century. The Coastal Sami and Kven ethnicity were often stereotyped as a stigmatized ethnic identity or just inferior. The mixed ethnic population in Northern Norway was therefore integrated into the Norwegian mainstream. My thesis brings out the contemporary changes among them. I observed the different ethnic identifications among the mixed population in Storfjord. I analyzed them in three categories: Category 1 termed “the <b>North</b> <b>Calotte</b> Cocktail” and “Northerner (Nordlending in Norwegian) ” group. Category 2 is the group who chose the single ethnic identity as Sami instead of Northern Norwegian. Category 3 comprises of those who claim double/multiple ethnicity instead of Northern Norwegian. Furthermore, this thesis includes how these different ethnic identifications are influencing Sami ethnic revitalization and their mechanisms for strengthening their new identity...|$|E
40|$|This report concludes {{a three-year}} {{foresight}} process {{on the topic}} of future sustainable regional development in the Nordic Arctic (2013 – 2016), based on the mandate given by the Nordic Council of Ministers’ Committee of Senior Officials for Regional Policy to the Nordic Working Group for Sustainable Regional Development in the Arctic. The mandate has been “to provide input to the further development of the NCM Arctic Co-operation Programme by collecting, reviewing and analysing existing information, assessing different preconditions for future development in the area and developing future scenarios. This will contribute to the political debate and give a more holistic overview of the scientific knowledge in the field. ” The Nordic Working Group decided to implement this task by conducting a foresight analysis. To guide the work of the three-year project, three overarching questions were defined for the foresight analysis. 1. What social and resource conditions can be expected to have a decisive influence on regional development in the Arctic over the next 10, 20 and 30 years? 2. How will the management of these conditions affect the living standards and future prospects for the regions? 3. What are the implications of the identified challenges and opportunities for future planning and regional policy? Previous foresight analyses have been carried out for the <b>North</b> <b>Calotte</b> region as part of the broader geographical area of the Northern Sparsely Populated Areas (Gløersen et al. 2009) and for the West Nordic countries (Gløersen, 2012). However, this is the first foresight analysis that covers the Nordic Arctic region as a whole. It has been essential for this study to adopt a bottom-up perspective in the process with participation from citizens of local communities across the Nordic Arctic in the initial vision phase. As part of the process, specific attention has also been paid to youth participation and local and regional business development potential. As a supple- 1. Introduction ment to the foresight analysis, Working Papers have been produced on the topics of youth perspectives on future development (Karlsdóttir and Jungsberg, 2015) and challenges and opportunities for sustainable business development (Olsen et al. 2016) ...|$|E

Urfolket i Nord-Europa, samene, kom også i søkelyset da hekseforfølgelsen grep om seg på 1500 - og 1600 -tallet. Sett i forhold til det lave folketallet ble mange samer på Nordkalotten dømt for trolldomsaktivitet. Artikkelen til Rune Hagen er den første empiriske undersøkelsen av omfanget av trolldomsprosesser mot samer i Norge. Undersøkelsen viser at 37 samer, de fleste menn, ble tiltalt og dømt for trolldomsforbrytelser i de tre nordligste fylkene i Norge. I 1692 måtte Anders Poulsen svare for anklager om trolldomskunst som han særlig skulle ha utøvd gjennom sin tromme, runebommen. Kildene fra denne saken er blant de mest omfangsrike fra norske trolldomssaker og gir innblikk i trosforestillinger som de dansk-norske myndighetene fikk store problemer med å bringe på begrep. Poulsens beskrivelse av sine evner gir et godt utgangspunkt for en tverrvitenskapelige diskusjonen rundt samisk sjamanisme og magi. Med bakgrunn i denne saken drøfter forfatteren også noen av særtrekkene ved trolldomsprosesser ført mot samer. In the early modern period the Sami were known throughout Europe as immensely dangerous magicians and sorcerers. The missionaries and people representing the government came to the <b>North</b> <b>Calotte</b> to demolish sacred places and to confiscate magic drums. As this article shows, the witch hunt {{in the northern part of}} Norway (Arctic Norway) stands out as one of the worst cases of witch persecutions in all of Europe in comparison to the very small size of the population. Over 175 people were prosecuted for the crime of witchcraft from 1593 to 1695. The witch trials of the far north are distinctive in a European context because of the elements of Sami magic. About 20 % of the witch trials are known to have affected the Sami. But only a few of these trials show traces of Sami shamanism. In Sami shamanism the drum, runebomme, is of great importance, and often linked to ecstatic divinations. The Sami shaman, noaidi, played his drum when he wanted to heal, divine, or to bring luck during hunting, and when he wanted to communicate with his gods. During the witch trials in Finnmark, two Sami drums were confiscated. One of the owners had to answer questions about the use of the drum and about the meaning of all the figures and symbols on his drum. Trying to find traces of shamanism, the article emphasises on the trial records of this particular case. These records date from one of the last but most momentous witch-trial in 1692. An old Sami shaman, Anders Poulsen, told the court about the symbols and the use of his magic drum. He also stood up and demonstrated the instrument for the people being present in the court house of a small fishing village called Vadsø. The assessment of the court case upholds the findings which criticise ecstasy and trance as choice characteristics when trying to determine what exactly the shaman world view consists of...|$|E
40|$|This book is {{the outcome}} of a series of {{seminars}} on 'European Collective Memory' at the European University Institute in the spring semester of 2007, which was organised by the two editors. An examination of the role of history and memory is vital in order to better understand why the grand design of a United Europe—with a common foreign policy and market yet enough diversity to allow for cultural and social differences—was overwhelmingly turned down by its citizens. The authors argue that this rejection of the European constitution was to a certain extent a challenge to the current historical grounding used for further integration and further demonstrates the lack of understanding by European bureaucrats of the historical complexity and divisiveness of Europe’s past. A critical European history is therefore urgently needed to confront and re-imagine Europe, not as a harmonious continent but as the outcome of violent and bloody conflicts, both within Europe as well as with its Others. As the authors show, these dark shadows of Europe’s past must be integrated, and the fact that memories of Europe are contested must be accepted if any new attempts at a United Europe are to be successful.
