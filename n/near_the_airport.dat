5|$|As a {{tropical}} depression, the storm moved rapidly through the Lesser Antilles; consequently, most islands only experienced minor effects. For example, Saint Lucia received light and sporadic rain showers, accompanied by sustained winds of 20–25mph (32–40km/h) and gusts to 35mph (55km/h). In Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, however, the depression dropped up to 9.2inches (235mm) {{of rain in}} 24hours. The rainfall blocked storm drains, including those <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>airport,</b> which was forced to shut down. The rainfall caused debris to collect on roads throughout the island. Although the storm passed just 70miles (110km) north of the Yucatán Peninsula, the storm dropped only 0.6inches (15mm) of rain due to its small size.|$|E
5|$|At Oregon's request, the U.S. Congress {{stripped}} the slough of its navigable status in 1978. This ended channel dredging on the slough, which {{could then be}} used for recreation. Other laws affecting the slough in the 1970s and beyond were the federal Clean Water Act and the Oregon Comprehensive Land Use Planning Act. In 1986, a business association began promoting commercial development along the upper slough, and the city later used urban renewal funds to support industrial projects <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>airport.</b> In 1996 the city acquired the Whitaker Ponds Natural Area, where it began a slough watershed education program for children.|$|E
5|$|It was legislated in 1966 to run {{parallel}} to the New Jersey Turnpike from exit 13 until North Avenue, where it would turn northwest and intersect U.S. Route 1/9 <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>airport.</b> The routing was eventually shifted to begin from a new interchange along the New Jersey Turnpike. A total of $50 million in funding was allocated for {{the road and the}} Port Authority of New York and New Jersey was responsible for designing the road. The state had wanted the port authority to pay for construction; however it was ruled that they could not build the road. Construction on Route 81 took place between 1979 and 1982.|$|E

5|$|Strong winds {{from the}} {{hurricane}} downed trees and power lines throughout southern Oaxaca. The storm temporarily isolated Puerto Ángel, Oaxaca and a navy base thereby cutting off communications {{from the rest}} of Mexico. In Huatulco, the winds blew down antennas at the local television station and destroyed at least 30cardboard houses. A community <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>airport</b> of the city was hit hard, with several people left homeless. Heavy rainfall from the storm caused severe flooding in portions of Oaxaca and neighboring Chiapas. A total of about 500entire communities were destroyed in Oaxaca; the areas worst affected were Zapotecos, Chatino, and Mixtecos.|$|E
5|$|The highway passes {{south of}} Wiggins Lake as it {{approaches}} the junction with M-18 in Gladwin.

The trunkline crosses into Arenac County before meeting I-75 and US23 in Arenac County near Standish.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, plans for Stord Airport, Sørstokken were launched. The bridge plans across Stokksundet were again {{brought up in}} 1982 as the {{industry}} on Bømlo wanted to not have use a ferry to reach the airport. A committee with representatives from all three municipalities was established in May 1983 {{to look into the}} possibilities for a bridge. Led by Bømlo Mayor Arne M. Haldorsen, it issued Engineer Harald Møyner the task to author a report and recommendation. He made three proposals: a pontoon or suspension bridge between Foldrøyhomen and Litlaneset; a suspension bridge between Setraneset and Sokkbleikjo, which would terminate just south of the new airport; and a combined fixed link between Spissøy and Digernes, without passing via the Fitjar Archipelago. The latter was the first time a fixed link to the mainland was proposed. The Norwegian Civil Aviation Administration protested against a possible suspension bridge <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>airport,</b> but stated that one closer further away would be fine.|$|E

5|$|Research at the Asummiut {{excavation}} site <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>airport</b> has uncovered the changing settlement pattern, exhibiting {{transition from the}} single-family dwellings to tiny villages of several families. The types of dwelling varied from tent rings made of the hides of hunted mammals, to stone hearths, with no evidence of communal living in larger structures. In contrast, there is evidence for reindeer hunting as a coordinated effort of either villagers or groups of more loosely related individuals, with gathering places in proximity of the hunting grounds being found. Despite recent advances in DNA research based on hair samples from the ancient Saqqaq migrants (which gives insight into their origin), {{the reason for the}} decline and subsequent disappearance of the culture are not yet known.|$|E
5|$|The Piper Aviation Museum {{exhibits}} {{aircraft and}} aircraft equipment, documents, photographs, and memorabilia related to Piper Aircraft.

5|$|The Port of Miami {{was also}} {{recently}} awarded a federal grant {{as part of}} the Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery (TIGER) program to restore a connection between the Florida East Coast Railway's yard in Hialeah and the Port of Miami, directly connecting the port to rail networks across the United States, as well as re-establish the port's on-dock rail capability (loading and unloading directly between ships and trains). The railroad bridge connecting the Port of Miami to the mainland was damaged by Hurricane Wilma in 2005, at which time service was suspended, and the bridge remained closed for well over a decade. Rail service to the port was restored by 2014. The rail project is part of another element of increasing PortMiami's capacity; an inland intermodal center to be built <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>airport</b> known as Flagler Logistics Hub, which was planned to be built on 300 acres of land in Hialeah.|$|E

5|$|The {{entire length}} of I-94 is listed on the National Highway System, a network of roadways {{important}} to the country's economy, defense, and mobility. The freeway carried 168,200vehicles on average between I-75 and Chene Street in Detroit, which is the peak traffic count in 2015, and it carried 12,554vehicles immediately west of the Blue Water Bridge in Port Huron, the lowest traffic count in 2015. As the state trunkline highway closest to the lake shore in these areas, I-94 carries the Lake Michigan Circle Tour south of Benton Harbor–St. Joseph and the Lake Huron Circle Tour in the Port Huron area. Sections through the Detroit area are named the Detroit Industrial and Edsel Ford freeways. I-94 in the state is either a four- or six-lane freeway {{for most of its}} length; one segment in the Detroit area has up to ten lanes total <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>airport.</b>|$|E
5|$|The interstate was {{proposed}} in the mid-1950s, along with I-15 and I-80 through Salt Lake City. At the time, only the western portion of the belt route was assigned as I-215. The eastern portion of the belt route was designated Interstate 415. However, the I-415 designation was scrapped to provide a single route number for the entire route in 1969, with the I-215 designation covering the complete belt route. The freeway was constructed in segments, beginning with a section completed in 1963 from Redwood Road in North Salt Lake to 2100 North <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>airport.</b> Originally planned to be complete in the mid-1970s, challenges from citizens' groups over environmental impact statements led to {{the completion of the}} last section of I-215 in 1989 between 6200 South and 4500 South in Holladay.|$|E
5|$|After 1976, gaps in {{the belt}} route were present from 2100 North <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>airport</b> to SR-201 and from State Street in Murray to 4600 South in Holladay. The first step in {{completing}} the gap was taken in June 1979, when construction of the interstate from State Street to 700 East began. This {{was followed by the}} Cottonwood Inc. lawsuit being awarded in favor of UDOT in November 1979. In July 1985, the route from 280 East to Union Park Avenue was completed. At the time, this portion of road was the most expensive in the state in terms of cost per mile, due to the road being depressed below surrounding neighborhoods. The next section to open was from 2100 North south to I-80 in 1987. This was followed by a section between Union Park Avenue and 2000 East, opened in November 1987, which was also built as a sunken freeway. The western quadrant of the freeway was completed in October 1988, closing the gap between SR-201 and I-80 (however, the California Avenue interchange wasn't opened until mid-1989). In August 1989, the road from 2000 East to 6200 South was finished, and the belt route was completed with the opening of freeway between 4500 South and 6200 South in October 1989.|$|E
