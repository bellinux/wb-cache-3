5|$|In {{the sixth}} and final chapter, Yajnavalkya lists exemplars of Paramahamsas, the highest renouncers: the sages Samvartaka, Aruni, Svetaketu, Durvasa, Ribhu, Nidagha, Jadabharata, Dattatreya and Raivataka. The Paramahamsas do <b>not</b> <b>carry</b> {{articles}} or show signs that suggest they have renounced, their conduct is concealed, they may only seem insane. They do <b>not</b> <b>carry</b> staves, nor bowl, nor hair tuft, nor sacred thread, {{but they are the}} ones who seek after the Atman (self, soul).|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} legends have grown around Surcouf over the time: {{he is often}} stated {{to have been made}} a Baron of the Empire, which is untrue. Another legend states that Surcouf had thrown {{overboard}} gold seized on Kent; in fact, Kent did <b>not</b> <b>carry</b> gold.|$|E

5|$|The U.S. vice {{presidency}} did <b>not</b> <b>carry</b> many official duties, but Coolidge was invited by President Harding to attend cabinet meetings, {{making him the}} first vice president to do so. He gave a number of unremarkable speeches around the country.|$|E
5|$|Almost 90% {{of ethnic}} Vietnamese are {{stateless}} residents of Cambodia, and do <b>not</b> <b>carry</b> citizenship papers such as identity cards or birth certificates. The 1996 Cambodian law on nationality technically permits Vietnamese residents born in Cambodia {{to take up}} citizenship, but faced resistance from mid-ranking interior ministry officials who generally refrain from registering Vietnamese residents due to concerns of political implications from opposition parties if citizenship were to be granted. A minority of Vietnamese residents were able to obtain citizenship only after paying bribes to interior ministry officials, or were married to Khmer spouses. The minority of Vietnamese residents who hold citizenship reported of interior ministry officials confiscating their citizenship papers. As a result, the Vietnamese faced legal restrictions from getting access to public healthcare, education, employment and buying land for housing as the majority do <b>not</b> <b>carry</b> Cambodian citizenship. Stateless Vietnamese built floating settlements in-lieu of buying land-based dwellings which require citizenship papers. According to field research carried out by Cambodia's Minority Rights Organisation, interior ministry officials would confront Vietnamese fishermen in the Tonle Sap and demand bribes {{in order to allow}} them to carry out fishing.|$|E

As she could not succeed to the throne of Hanover, her arms did <b>not</b> <b>carry</b> the Hanoverian symbols that were used by her immediate predecessors. Her arms have been borne by all of her successors on the throne.|$|E
5|$|As the {{activities}} of Natlačen and his National Council of Slovenia were continuing, the Yugoslav Supreme Command ordered their arrest.

5|$|Butterflies feed {{primarily}} on nectar from flowers. Some also derive nourishment from pollen, tree sap, rotting fruit, dung, decaying flesh, and dissolved minerals in wet sand or dirt. Butterflies are important as pollinators for some species of plants. In general, they do <b>not</b> <b>carry</b> as much pollen load as bees, {{but they are}} capable of moving pollen over greater distances. Flower constancy has been observed for at least one species of butterfly.|$|E

5|$|Despite its continual {{merging with}} other units from 1881, {{the legacy of}} the 52nd remains. Many of the 52nd's battle honours are {{represented}} on the Belt Badge of The Rifles (being a rifle regiment, The Rifles do <b>not</b> <b>carry</b> colours). Various museums record the actions of the 52nd and hold collections of artifacts and memorabilia, including the Royal Green Jackets Museum, and the Soldiers of Oxfordshire Trust, whose archives are managed by the Oxfordshire County Council.|$|E
5|$|Each police {{district}} {{is led by}} a chief of police and is subdivided into several police stations in towns and cities, and sheriffs' offices for rural areas. The Governor of Svalbard acts as chief of police for Svalbard. Norwegian police officers do <b>not</b> <b>carry</b> firearms, but keep their Heckler & Koch MP5 submachine guns and Heckler & Koch P30 pistols locked down in the patrol cars. The Norwegian Prosecuting Authority is partially integrated with the police.|$|E
5|$|Health-care {{coverage}} in the United States {{is a combination of}} public and private efforts and is not universal. In 2014, 13.4% of the population did <b>not</b> <b>carry</b> health insurance. The subject of uninsured and underinsured Americans is a major political issue. In 2006, Massachusetts became the first state to mandate universal health insurance. Federal legislation passed in early 2010 would ostensibly create a near-universal health insurance system around the country by 2014, though the bill and its ultimate effect are issues of controversy.|$|E

5|$|Purebred Arabians never carry {{dilution}} genes. Therefore, purebreds {{cannot be}} colors such as dun, cremello, palomino or buckskin. However, there is pictorial evidence from pottery and tombs in Ancient Egypt suggesting that spotting patterns may have existed on ancestral Arabian-type horses in antiquity. Nonetheless, purebred Arabians today do <b>not</b> <b>carry</b> genes for pinto or Leopard complex ("Appaloosa") spotting patterns, except for sabino.|$|E
5|$|The Joint Chiefs of Staff {{issued a}} {{directive}} in January 1948 for the modification of 225 B-29, B-50, and B-36 bombers to carry nuclear weapons, along with eight C-97 Stratofreighter aircraft to carry bomb assembly teams. There were already 32 Silverplate B-29s in service with the Strategic Air Command, so the Air Materiel Command {{was directed to}} carry out Saddletree modifications on a further 80 B-29s, 36 B-50As, 23 B-50Bs and 18 B-36Bs. The B-36A could <b>not</b> <b>carry</b> nuclear weapons without major modifications.|$|E
5|$|The {{courtesy}} title Lord Dunglass did <b>not</b> <b>carry</b> with it {{membership of}} the House of Lords, and Dunglass was eligible to seek election to the House of Commons. Unlike many aristocratic families, the Douglas-Homes had little history of political service. Uniquely in the family the 11th earl, Dunglass's great-grandfather, had held government office, as Under-secretary at the Foreign Office in Wellington's 1828–30 government. Dunglass's father stood, reluctantly and unsuccessfully, for Parliament before succeeding to the earldom.|$|E

5|$|The {{toxicity}} of finely divided beryllium (dust or powder, mainly encountered in industrial settings where beryllium is produced or machined) is very well-documented. Solid beryllium metal does <b>not</b> <b>carry</b> the same hazards as airborne inhaled dust, but any hazard associated with physical contact is poorly documented. Workers handling finished beryllium pieces are routinely advised {{to handle them}} with gloves, both as a precaution and because many if not most applications of beryllium cannot tolerate residue of skin contact such as fingerprints.|$|E
5|$|Unusually in Japan, where photographers tend to join or form groups, Kikai {{has never}} been in any group, preferring to work by himself. When not setting out to take photographs, Kikai does <b>not</b> <b>carry</b> a camera with him. He leaves photographing his own family to his wife Noriko, and it is she who has the camera if they go on a trip together.|$|E
5|$|After April's failed {{wedding to}} Matthew, Callie and Arizona {{bought a house}} together, a fresh start, away from the {{memories}} of their apartment.

However, {{a trip to the}} OB/GYN led to the discovery that Callie had developed adhesions in her uterus in the years since Sofia's birth, meaning she could <b>not</b> <b>carry</b> any more babies. After talking about it, the couple agreed to postpone their dream to have another baby until they're on more solid footing as a couple.|$|E
