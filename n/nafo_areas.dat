5000|$|Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) {{considers}} this species endangered {{based on a}} 2012 Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada assessment. [...] The status report identified that catches of cusk in the DFO summer bottom trawl survey had declined by roughly 90% from 1970 to the late 1990s. [...] A landings limit of 1000 mt {{was put in place}} in 1999 in the 4X North American Fisheries Organization area and was further restricted to 750 t and expanded to include the 4VWX5Z <b>NAFO</b> <b>areas</b> in 2003.

40|$|We {{compared}} seasonal composition, abundance, and biomass of seabirds {{between the}} ICES Journal of Marine Science, 63 : 1145 e 1158 (2006) Northeast (ICES region) and Northwest (NAFO region) Atlantic fisheries regions to identify differences in community assemblage and prey consumption. Seabirds were more {{abundant in the}} Northwest Atlantic, but biomass was greater in the Northeast. This disparity resulted from enormous numbers of little auks Alle alle breeding in West Greenland and of Leach’s storm-petrels Oceanodroma leucorhoa breeding in Newfoundland, plus large numbers of non-breeding shearwaters Puffinus spp. entering southern <b>NAFO</b> <b>areas</b> in summer. The Northeast Atlantic communities were dominated numerically by northern fulmars Fulmarus glacialis, large auks Uria spp., and the Atlantic puffin Fratercula arctica. Seabirds oc-cupying the North Atlantic consume approximately 11 106 t of food annually. Overall consumption rates peak during summer {{as a result of}} increased breeding activity and sea-sonal movements of birds into the North Atlantic. Because of the greater biomass of birds in the northeast, consumption (mainly by piscivores) in ICES areas was approximately 20 % higher than that in <b>NAFO</b> <b>areas,</b> where planktivores dominate. <b>NAFO</b> <b>areas</b> had, however, a much greater consumption rate per unit area than ICES areas.

40|$|Feeding {{habits of}} 7 995 {{individuals}} of three wolffish species {{distributed in the}} north Atlantic were analyzed: 1 016 of northern wolffish (Anarhichas denticulatus), 4 783 of Atlantic wolffish (A. lupus) and 2 196 of spotted wolffish (A. minor). The individuals sampled were taken in the <b>NAFO</b> <b>Area</b> Divisions 3 NO in spring in the period 2002 - 2005, Div. 3 L in summer in the period 2003 - 2004, Div. 3 M in summer in the period 1993 - 2005, and in the ICES Area Div. IIb in autumn in the period 2004 - 2005. Feeding intensity was higher in the <b>NAFO</b> <b>Area</b> than in the northeast Atlantic (spring-summer vs. autumn), mainly in spotted wolffish in Div. 3 M. The importance of each prey taxa was evaluated using the weight percentage. Wolffish species diet showed geographical differences. Ontogenic diet changes and prey variation throughout the studied period were observed, mainly in Atlantic and spotted wolffishes. This two species preyed primarily on bottom (echinoderms, gastropods and bivalves) and benthopelagic (northern shrimp and redfish) organisms on Flemish Cap and Grand Bank. However fish and northern shrimp predation were more important on the Flemish Cap, mainly in spotted wolffish, showing periods with higher predation on these prey when the biomass of these prey species increased. This fact {{might have been the}} cause of diet overlap between Atlantic and spotted wolffishes in some periods in Div. 3 M. Less ontogenic, annual and geographical diet variations were found in northern wolffish in <b>NAFO</b> <b>Area,</b> feeding mainly on ctenophores; however in Svalbard area, this species showed to be highly piscivore.

40|$|Recently, the {{importance}} of elasmobranch fisheries has increased in the <b>NAFO</b> <b>area</b> due {{to the collapse of}} some important stocks like cod or American plaice; species like thorny skate are now one of the main resources in the <b>NAFO</b> Regulatory <b>Area,</b> especially in the Grand Bank. Nevertheless, in Flemish Cap (NAFO Div 3 M), despite the weakness of the main stocks, elasmobranchs carry on being a resource without direct fishing that is mainly fished as by-catch. Since 1988 a bottom trawl survey was carried out by the European Community in Flemish Cap waters. Furthermore, since 1995, another trawl survey was also carried out in the Regulatory Area of the Grand Bank (NAFO, Div. 3 NO); the goal of these surveys is collecting data for the assessment of the main species but these surveys are also an important source of information on biology and population dynamics of other fish species like elasmobranchs. The aim of this work is to show the present status and the recent changes in biomass of the main elasmobranch species in the areas covered by these surveys, with focus on their relative abundance, their spatial distribution and their size distribution.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{fisheries management}} {{problems on the}} Grand Banks that were due to divided jurisdiction between Canada's 200 mile Fisheries Zone and the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization's (<b>NAFO)</b> <b>area</b> outside this zone, which brought to the fore the predicaments associated with straddling stocks.

Because Canadian scientists overestimated the stocks, northern cod became {{the basis of a}} growth industry for Canada and for considerable fishing activity in the NAFO zone by vessels from NAFO member and non-member countries during the 1980 s. From 1985 onwards, straddling stocks became a contentious issue between Canada and NAFO with respect to management measures and their enforcement. This issue became particularly acute {{towards the end of the}} 1980 s when the overestimation of the northern cod stock became apparent, leading to a reduction in the TACs for this species and to Canada's closure of this fishery in 1992.

GadCap is an EU project dealing {{with the development of}} a GADGET multispecies model for the Flemish Cap cod, redfish and shrimp, as part of the NAFO roadmap for the EAF. The effect of fishing, trophic interactions (including cannibalism) and water temperature in the dynamic of these three major fishing resources has been modeled. The results highlight the interdependent dynamic of these stocks, and reveals strong interactions between recruitment, fishing and predation (including cannibalism), with marked changes in their relative importance by species-age-length over time. The multispecies model shows that disregarding the species interactions would lead to serious underestimates of natural mortality, overestimations of the exploitable biomass, and highlights the need to move beyond single-species management in this highly coupled ecosystem.
