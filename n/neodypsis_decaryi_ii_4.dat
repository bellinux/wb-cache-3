A. Church, Phys. Rev. A 47, 132 (1993) ]. The present results are tau(Ca <b>II,</b> <b>4</b> p P- 2 (1 / 2)) = 7. 098 (0. 020) ns, tau(Ca <b>II,</b> <b>4</b> p P- 2 (3 / 2)) = 6. 924 (0. 019) ns, and tau(Cl <b>II,</b> <b>4</b> p' F- 1 (3)) = 11. 17 (0. 06) ns. The experimental lifetimes of these, plus the Ar <b>II</b> <b>4</b> p' F- 2 (7 / 2) level, are compared with available recent many-electron calculations. Typically 1 %- 3 % differences between measurement and ab initio theory are found, while certain semiempirical calculations are in better agreement with experiment. Data for other precise lifetime measurements on alkali-metal systems are compared with recent ab initio and semiempirical calculations to provide perspective on the Ca II results. The hyperfine structure of the Cl- 35 II 3 d' 1 G 4 - 4 p' F- 1 (3) transition was also measured and analyzed {{in the course of the}} measurements, with the resulting hyperfine-structure constants: A(F- 1 (3)) = 301. 9 (0. 5) MHz, B(F- 1 (3)) = - 6. 7 (0. 8) MHz, A(1 G 4) = 205. 1 (0. 5) MHz, and B(1 G 4) = - 3. 9 (2. 4) MHz...|$|R

40|$|Type <b>II</b> phosphatidylinositol <b>4</b> -kinases are {{implicated in}} Fc epsilon RI-mediated {{signaling}} cascades leading to release of inflammatory molecules. Cross-linking of Fc epsilon RI on RBL 2 H 3 cells results in protein tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of type <b>II</b> PtdIns <b>4</b> -kinase activity. Protein tyrosine kinase(s) that phosphorylate type <b>II</b> PtdIns <b>4</b> -kinase(s) in RBL 2 H 3 cells remains elusive {{and is being}} addressed in this manuscript. Anti-Fyn kinase antibodies co-immunoprecipitated type <b>II</b> PtdIns <b>4</b> -kinase activity from Fc epsilon RI cross-linked RBL 2 H 3 cells. In reciprocal assays, His-tagged types <b>II</b> PtdIns <b>4</b> -kinases were shown to pull down Fyn kinase. Further, anti-Fyn immunoprecipitates were shown to phosphorylate type <b>II</b> PtdIns <b>4</b> -kinase alpha and beta in in vitro assays. Pull down studies with GST-Fyn-SH 2 and GST-Fyn-SH 3 domains showed that type <b>II</b> PtdIns <b>4</b> -kinases associate with Fyn-SH 2 domain. Knockdown of Fyn kinase in RBL 2 H 3 cells abrogated activation of type <b>II</b> PtdIns <b>4</b> -kinase activity in response to Fc epsilon RI cross-linking and type <b>II</b> PtdIns <b>4</b> -kinase activity in anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates. Knockdown of Fyn kinase was also strongly correlated with a reduction in beta-hexosaminidase release in response to Fc epsilon RI cross-linking. These results suggest that type <b>II</b> PtdIns <b>4</b> -kinases act downstream of Fyn kinase in Fc epsilon RI signaling cascades and are regulated by Fyn kinase...|$|R
