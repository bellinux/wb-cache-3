They are often made of either wool or polyester (although many other synthetic and <b>natural</b> <b>textiles</b> are used) and may be designed to be worn with a matching suit jacket. Suit trousers have a [...] on them because of their tight-fitting nature.

His clothes are often neutral in colour and loosely fitted, as he says women 'need to move freely' and that comfort is important.

40|$|A novel {{nano-sized}} copolymer nanofilm {{provides a}} unique reinforcement to the mechanical properties of <b>natural</b> <b>textiles.</b> This study reveals that a nano-sized coating provides a strong healing effect {{to resist the}} crack propagation of natural fiber surfaces.

Furthermore it contains tools which help companies to implement, improve and monitor social and ecological behaviour within the supply chain of the apparel industry. The three tools examined are the following: - conducting audits at the suppliers’ production facilities, - obtaining certifications and - recycling of used textiles. They mainly refer to improving the suppliers’ ability {{to act in a}} sustainable way. The third tool, recycling, aims at building a cycle of resources. After a theoretical presentation, the companies Hess Natur Textilien GmbH and Hennes & Mauritz AG are analysed regarding to their sustainability strategies in their supply chains. Hessnatur is seen as pioneer in the market for <b>natural</b> <b>textiles</b> and H&M is offering low-price clothing. The results show, that the apparel industry is highly affected by unsustainable behaviour. Manufacturing clothes is labour-intensive, it is consuming many resources and therefore has consequences for people and the environment. Audits and certification proved to be important tools for implementing sustainability in supply chains. Both companies use them, but they have different approaches. The idea of sustainability is characteristic for the whole business policy of Hessnatur, while H&M added this concept to its existing policy some years ago. Due to those different starting points, Hessnatur was able to build closer relationships with their suppliers than H&M. To sum up, there is not one perfect strategy for sustainability, but every company has to engage in increasing sustainability within the supply chain according to individual circumstances and to the firm’s individual character...|$|E

By studying the interface interaction of the composite materials using nanotechnology, we developed composite materials that achieve satisfactory mechanical properties in two classes of materials. Durable press (DP) <b>natural</b> <b>textiles</b> are important consumer products usually achieved by crosslinking the molecules in the textiles to achieve long-term wrinkle resistance, which, however, also leads to the simultaneous significant drop of mechanical properties. Herein, a series of polymeric nanoparticles were investigated, the application of as little as ~ 0. 14 wt% addition of the nanoparticles improved the mechanical property of the DP cotton fabric by 56 % in tearing resistance and 100 % in abrasion resistance; the loss in recovery angle is negligible. The author also studied the enzyme-triggered DP treatments of silk fabrics, as a green process method. After the treatment of enzymes, excellent DP property was achieved with improved strain property. Injectable calcium phosphate powder containing acrylic bone cements are widely used in orthopedic surgery to fix artificial prostheses. However, the bending strength is still unsatisfactory. The author modified the surface of the strontium (Sr) containing hydroxyapatite (HA) filler powders with acrylolpamidronate in order to improve the overall mechanical performance of the bone cement composites. By adding 0. 25 wt% of acrylolpamidronate to the Sr-HA nanopowders, more than 19 % of the bending strength and more than 23 % compression strength of the Sr-HA bone cement were improved. Biological evaluations revealed that these bone cement composites were biocompatible and bioactive in cell culture. The results obtained in this thesis work show an effective method to significantly enhance the mechanical properties of composite materials. Different from other available methods, by developing a new series of chemical compounds and nanoparticles, we successfully bound them to the surface or to the constitutional components of the materials through covalent bond. The treatment can enhance and modulate the interface-bonding of the filler materials and enhances the mechanical property of the surface through grafting a thin nano-layer. Since only surface reaction is involved, very small amount of the new material is needed, and the treatment can be readily integrated to the existing processes. The work is instructive in modifying available composite materials to acquire ultra-high mechanical performance...|$|E
