According to the common definition of a <b>normal,</b> standard <b>working</b> <b>condition,</b> part-time work should be treated as atypical work.

This article starts with an overview of developments in flexibilisation and a status-quo analysis of the part-time working arrangements in Austria as a sign of labour market flexibilisation. It continues with a contention of whether part-time work as an atypical working arrangement is automatically linked to precarious <b>working</b> and living <b>conditions.</b> Using Austria as a starting point, this article closes by approaching a crucial question for all European labour markets: What form do future part-time work arrangements need to take in order to be considered “normal” from an employee’s point of view? This article concludes with the assertion that discussions on the future of part-time work should not be driven by questions of definition. Rather, it would be more productive for further research to focus on offering scope for freedom of choice and social security for part-time employees.|$|R

Once the Pedestal looseness is {{developed in a}} rotor system, the rotor {{is more likely to}} make contact with stator under tight clearance conditions.

The present study is aimed to simulate a chaotic system of the nonlinear rotor system and the system can adaptively be converted to <b>normal</b> <b>working</b> state under the circumstance of the chaotic state occasioned by outside perturbation for the complicated chaotic system. The nonlinear dynamic equations of rotor-bearing system with coupling faults of pedestal looseness and rub-impact force are derived and a multi-parameter adaptive control algorithm is given.

Based on the consideration of the barrier fluctuations and the barrier height shift caused by image charge and the applied voltage drop across Ti/SiC interfical layer, a comprehensive analytical model for the reverse tunneling current is developed using a WKB calculation of the tunneling probability through a reverse biased Schottky barrier. This model {{takes into account the}} main reverse conduction mechanism, such as field emission, thermionic field emission and thermionic emission.
