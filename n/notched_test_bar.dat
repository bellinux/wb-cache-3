40|$|The fatigue {{behaviour}} of a 9 Cr {{power plant}} steel at {{a temperature of}} 600 °C was studied by uniaxial fatigue tests and microstructural analysis using electron microscopy. A continuum damage mechanics apporach was coupled to the constitutive equations of the Chaboche elasto-visco-plastic model to describe the fatigue behaviour of the 9 Cr power plant steel at 600 °C. A stress partition method is introduced to understand the fatigue softening behaviour, and used to give an initial estimate of the material constants in the Chaboche model. Further optimisation procedures with plastic strain range dependency of the material constants were introduced in the optimisation procedure in order to accurately predict the material behaviour, especially after damage initiation. An ABAQUS UMAT subroutine was coded to allow the full life cyclic softening behaviour of a power plant component to be accurately predicted in a finite element calculation.

40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{so-called}} Theory of Critical Distances is reformulated {{to make it}} suitable for estimating the strength of notched metals subjected to dynamic loading. The TCD takes as its starting point the assumption that engineering materials’ strength can accurately be predicted by directly post-processing the entire linear-elastic stress field acting on the material {{in the vicinity of}} the stress concentrator being assessed. In order to extend the used of the TCD to situations involving dynamic loading, the hypothesis is formed that the required critical distance (which is treated as a material property) varies as the loading rate increases. The accuracy and reliability of this novel reformulation of the TCD was checked against a number of experimental results generated by <b>testing</b> <b>notched</b> cylindrical <b>bars</b> of Al 6063 -T 5.

The fracture resistances of the self-reinforced monoliths were comparable to those of the composites and the fracture mechanisms were found to be similar at room temperature. However at elevated temperatures the differences of the fracture behavior became apparent where the superior fracture resistance of the self-reinforced monoliths were attributed to the minor amounts of glassy, intergranular phases which were often more abundant in the composites and affected the fracture behavior when softened by elevated temperatures...|$|R
40|$|The work {{summarizes}} a large bulk {{of experimental}} data from specimens made of 40 CrMoV 13. 9 steel. The {{first part of}} the paper deals with multiaxial fatigue strength of <b>notched</b> round <b>bars</b> <b>tested</b> under combined tension and torsion loading, both in-phase and out-of-phase. The results from multi-axial tests are discussed together with those obtained under pure tension and pure torsion loading from notched specimens with the same geometry.

Tests are performed varying temperature, from room temperature up to 650 °C. Altogether more than 180 new fatigue data are summarised in the present work, corresponding to more than two-years of testing programme. All fatigue data are presented first in terms of nominal stress amplitudes referred to the net area and then re-analysed in terms of the mean value of the strain energy density evaluated over a given, crescent shape volume embracing the stress concentration region.

40|$|AbstractHumans {{can compare}} the orientations and {{locations}} of two motion-defined <b>test</b> <b>bars</b> several degrees apart {{so as to}} rapidly encode and place in memory their mean orientation, orientation difference, separation and mean location, while ignoring stimuli located between the two <b>test</b> <b>bars.</b> Performance is not impaired by randomly varying {{the location of the}} bars. We conclude that the two <b>test</b> <b>bars</b> are not compared by shifting gaze location or attention from one <b>test</b> <b>bar</b> to the other, nor by attending to two spatial locations. In addition, observers can discriminate the orientation difference and mean orientation of two <b>test</b> <b>bars</b> that, each of which is rendered visible by a different sub-modality (motion, disparity or luminance). Taking into account the findings reported here and previously reported findings on the early processing of luminance-defined form (Vis. Res. 40 (2000) 2291, Vis.

This effect was due to an increased fracture stress, initiation strain, and propagation strain. With infrared measurements a temperature increase of 30 – 40 °C was observed. Also the size of the deformation zone increased with test speed. A possible explanation is a thermal blunting resulting from adiabatic heating at high speeds.
