40|$|Using a {{model of}} {{perinatal}} brain lesions induced by lipopolysaccharide and hypoxia/ischemia, we hypothesized that interleukin- 2 (IL- 2), a <b>neurotoxic</b> <b>cytokine,</b> was enhanced within injured brains. We showed that lipopolysaccharide and hypoxia/ischemia enhanced both intracerebral IL- 2 mRNA and protein levels, with a maximum increase upon lipopolysaccharide and hypoxia/ischemia. The lack of detectable T lymphocytes suggested the synthesis of IL- 2 by neural cells. Lipopolysaccharide and hypoxia triggered IL- 2 synthesis by cultured microglia with a peak after exposure to lipopolysaccharide and hypoxia. Double-labeling showed, in vivo and in vitro, that IL- 2 immunoreactivity was colocalized with a microglia/macrophage marker. These results disclosed the ability of microglia to produce IL- 2 and also suggest the implication of IL- 2 in neural cell death triggered by perinatal lipopolysaccharide and hypoxia/ischemia exposures. © Wolters Kluwer HealthSCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|At present, {{available}} {{treatments for}} Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 s disease (AD) are largely unable to halt disease progression. Microglia, the resident macrophages in the brain, are strongly {{implicated in the}} pathology and progressively degenerative nature of AD. Specifically, microglia are activated in response to both β amyloid (Aβ) and neuronal damage, and can become a chronic source of <b>neurotoxic</b> <b>cytokines</b> and reactive oxygen species (ROS). NADPH oxidase is a multi-subunit enzyme complex responsible {{for the production of}} both extracellular and intracellular ROS by microglia. Importantly, NADPH oxidase expression is upregulated in AD and is an essential component of microglia-mediated Aβ neurotoxicity. Activation of microglial NADPH oxidase causes neurotoxicity through two mechanisms: 1) extracellular ROS produced by microglia are directly toxic to neurons; 2) intracellular ROS function as a signaling mechanism in microglia to amplify the production of several pro-inflammatory and <b>neurotoxic</b> <b>cytokines</b> (for example, tumor necrosis factor-α, prostaglandin E 2, and interleukin- 1 β). The following review describes how targeting NADPH oxidase can reduce a broad spectrum of toxic factors (for example, cytokines, ROS, and reactive nitrogen species) to result in inhibition of neuronal damage from two triggers of deleterious microglial activation (Aβ and neuron damage), offering hope in halting the progression of AD...|$|R
40|$|There is {{increasing}} {{evidence that a}} chronic inflammatory response in the brain in Alzheimer's disease (AD) ultimately leads to neuronal injury and cognitive decline.

Evidence that the cytokine macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) is an important cofactor in microglial activation in AD is presented. Ongoing work using organotypic hippocampal expiant cultures to model the inflammatory process in the AD brain is also discussed. Potential avenues for therapeutic intervention are outlined...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Neuroinflammation occurs {{following}} brain injury, including soman (GD) induced status epilepticus (SE), and {{may contribute}} to loss of neural tissue and declined behavioral function. However, {{little is known about}} this important pathological process following GD exposure. Limited transcriptional information on a small number of brain-expressed inflammatory mediators has been shown following GD-induced SE and even less information on protein upregulation has been elucidated. The {{purpose of this study is}} to further characterize the regional and temporal progression of the neuroinflammatory process following acute GD-induced SE. Methods The protein levels of 10 cytokines was quantified using bead multiplex immunoassays in damaged brain regions (i. e., piriform cortex, hippocampus and thalamus) up to 72 hours following seizure onset. Those factors showing significant changes were then localized to neural cells using fluorescent IHC. Results A significant concentration increase was observed in all injured brain regions for four acute phase response (APR) induction cytokines: interleukin (IL) - 1 α, IL- 1 β, IL- 6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -α. Increases in these APR cytokines corresponded both temporally and regionally to areas of known seizure damage and neuronal death. <b>Neurotoxic</b> <b>cytokines</b> IL- 1 α and IL- 1 β were primarily expressed by activated microglia whereas the potentially neuroprotective cytokine IL- 6 was expressed by neurons and hypertrophic astrocytes. Conclusions Increases in <b>neurotoxic</b> <b>cytokines</b> likely play an active role in the progression of GD-induced SE neuropathology though the exact role that these and other cytokines play in this process require further study. </p...|$|R
40|$|Human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) –associated sensory neuropathy (HIV-SN) {{is the most}} common neurological complication of HIV infection. Currently, the pathogenesis of HIV-SN is unknown. Because there is no convincing evidence of neuronal infection, HIV neurotoxicity is likely to be effected either by secreted viral proteins such as the envelope glycoprotein gp 120 or by <b>neurotoxic</b> <b>cytokines</b> released from infected/activated glial cells. We describe a model of gp 120 toxicity to primary sensory neurons, in which gp 120 induces neuritic degeneration and neuronal apoptosis. We show that Schwann cells, the cells that ensheath peripheral nerve axons, and which traditionally have been viewed as having a passive, supporting role, mediate this neurotoxicity. Ligation of the chemokine receptor CXCR 4 on Schwann cells by gp 120 resulted in the release of RANTES, which induced dorsal root ganglion neurons to produce tumor necrosis factor– and subsequent TNFR 1 -mediated neurotoxicity in an autocrine fashion. This newly described Schwann cell–neuron interaction may be pathogenically relevant not only in HIV-SN but also in other peripheral neuropathies.

40|$|Background: Huntington disease (HD) is {{characterized}} by the progressive death of medium spiny dopamine receptor bearing striatal GABAergic neurons. In addition, microglial activation in the areas of neuronal loss has recently been described in postmortem studies. Activated microglia are known to release <b>neurotoxic</b> <b>cytokines,</b> and these may contribute to the pathologic process. Methods: To evaluate in vivo the involvement of microglia activation in HD, the authors studied patients at different stages of the disease using [C- 11](R) -PK 11195 PET, a marker of microglia activation, and [C- 11] raclopride PET, a marker of dopamine D 2 receptor binding and hence striatal GABAergic cell function. Results: In HD patients, a significant increase in striatal [C- 11](R) -PK 11195 binding was observed, which significantly correlated with disease severity as reflected by the striatal reduction in [C- 11] raclopride binding, the Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale score, and the patients' CAG index. Also detected were significant increases in microglia activation in cortical regions including prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate. Conclusions: These [C- 11](R) -PK 11195 PET findings show that the level of microglial activation correlates with Huntington disease (HD) severity. They lend support to the view that microglia contribute to the ongoing neuronal degeneration in HD and indicate that [C- 11](R) -PK 11195 PET provides a valuable marker when monitoring the efficacy of putative neuroprotecting agents in this relentlessly progressive genetic disorder...|$|R
40|$|In {{multiple}} sclerosis, long-term disability {{is caused}} by axonal and neuronal damage. Established therapies target primarily the inflammatory component of the disease, but fail to prevent neurodegeneration. Fingolimod (codenamed FTY 720) is an oral sphingosine 1 -phosphate (S 1 P) receptor modulator with promising results in phase II trials in multiple sclerosis patients and is under further development as a novel treatment for multiple sclerosis. To evaluate whether FTY 720 has neuroprotective properties, we tested this drug in a rat model of myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein-induced optic neuritis. FTY 720 exerted significant anti-inflammatory effects during optic neuritis and reduced inflammation, demyelination, and axonal damage; however, FTY 720 treatment did not prevent apoptosis of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), the neurons that form the axons of the optic nerve. Consistent with this lack of effect on RGC survival, FTY 720 treatment did not improve visual function, nor did it prevent apoptosis of RGCs in vitro. We observed a persistent activation of apoptotic signaling pathways in RGCs under FTY 720 treatment, a possible underlying mechanism {{for the lack of}} neuroprotection in the presence of strong anti-inflammatory effects, Furthermore, FTY 720 shifted the remaining inflammation in the optic nerve toward neurotoxicity by modest up-regulation of potential <b>neurotoxic</b> <b>cytokines.</b> We conclude that FTY 720 -induced anti-inflammation and axon protection did not of itself protect neurons from apoptotic cell death...|$|R
40|$|A complex {{therapeutic}} {{challenge for}} Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is minimizing deleterious aspects of microglial activation while maximizing beneficial actions, including phagocytosis/clearance of amyloid β (Aβ) peptides. One potential target is selective suppression of microglial prostaglandin E 2 receptor subtype 2 (EP 2) function, which influences microglial phagocytosis and elaboration of <b>neurotoxic</b> <b>cytokines.</b> To test this hypothesis, we transplanted bone marrow cells derived from wild-type mice or mice homozygous deficient for EP 2 (EP 2 −/−) into lethally irradiated 5 -month-old wild-type or APPswe-PS 1 ΔE 9 double transgenic AD mouse model recipients. We found that cerebral engraftment by {{bone marrow transplant}} (BMT) -derived wild-type or EP 2 −/− microglia was more efficient in APPswe-PS 1 ΔE 9 than in wild-type mice, and APPswe-PS 1 ΔE 9 mice that received EP 2 −/− BMT had increased cortical microglia compared with APPswe-PS 1 ΔE 9 mice that received wild-type BMT. We found that myeloablative irradiation followed by bone marrow transplant-derived microglia engraftment, rather than cranial irradiation or BMT alone, {{was responsible for the}} approximate one-third reduction in both Aβ plaques and potentially more neurotoxic soluble Aβ species. An additional 25 % reduction in cerebral cortical Aβ burden was achieved in mice that received EP 2 −/− BMT compared with mice that received wild-type BMT.

Here, we tested the hypothesis that bone marrow cell APOE genotype modulates pathological progression in experimental Alzheimer disease. We performed bone marrow transplants (BMT) from green fluorescent protein–expressing human APOE 3 / 3 or APOE 4 / 4 donor mice into lethally irradiated 5 -month-old APPswe/PS 1 ΔE 9 mice. Eight months later, APOE 4 / 4 BMT–recipient APPswe/PS 1 ΔE 9 mice had significantly impaired spatial working memory and increased detergent-soluble and plaque Aβ compared with APOE 3 / 3 BMT–recipient APPswe/PS 1 ΔE 9 mice. BMT-derived microglia engraftment was significantly reduced in APOE 4 / 4 recipients, who also had correspondingly less cerebral apoE. Gene expression analysis in cerebral cortex of APOE 3 / 3 BMT recipients showed reduced expression of tumor necrosis factor-α and macrophage migration inhibitory factor (both <b>neurotoxic</b> <b>cytokines)</b> and elevated immunomodulatory IL- 10 expression in APOE 3 / 3 recipients compared with those that received APOE 4 / 4 bone marrow. This was not due to detectable APOE-specific differences in expression of microglial major histocompatibility complex class II, C-C chemokine receptor (CCR) type  1, CCR 2, CX 3 C chemokine receptor 1 (CX 3 CR 1), or C 5 a anaphylatoxin chemotactic receptor (C 5 aR).

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} the induction of cytokines {{as a possible}} mechanism for the neurotoxicity of the HIV- 1 envelope protein gp 120. Design: The gp 120 protein was tested directly on primary human brain cultures to examine its ability to induce cytokines and its neurotoxicity on human neural cells because gp 120 {{is known to be}} toxic to rodent ganglion cultures, and neural cells such as astrocytes and microglia produce cytokines when stimulated. Methods: Primary cultures of human brain cell aggregates, astrocytes and macrophages were exposed to HIV- 1 recombinant(r) gp 120 (SF 2) Induction of cytokines was assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR); neurotoxicity of rgp 120 (SF 2) and interleukin (IL) - 6 on human brain cultures was examined by electron microscopy. Results: ELISA and RT-PCR studies revealed that rgp 120 (SF 2) induced IL- 6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -α in brain cultures; IL- 6 could also be induced by TNF-α added to brain cultures. Both IL- 6 and TNF-α were upregulated in astrocytes and macrophage cultures on rgp 120 (SF 2) treatment. Ultrastructural studies demonstrated that IL- 6 treatment for 72 h induced large cytoplasmic vacuoles in neural cells with morphology consistent with neurons; rgp 120 (SF 2) treatment for 7 days resulted in chromatin condensation along the inner margins of nuclear envelopes of neural cells. Conclusions: Our results demonstrated that HIV- 1 rgp 120 (SF 2) can upregulate at least two known <b>neurotoxic</b> <b>cytokines,</b> IL- 6 and TNF-α, which may injure neural cells and contribute to the neuropathology observed in AIDS dementia patients. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|Two {{groups of}} newborn infants have an {{increased}} risk for perinatal brain injury; preterm infants and term infants subjected to birth asphyxia. Experimental studies indicate that hypoxic-ischemic insults in the perinatal period initiate a secondary neurotoxic cascade including formation of toxic reactive oxygen species {{as well as an}} inflammatory response with elevated levels of potentially <b>neurotoxic</b> <b>cytokines.</b> In the preterm infant a fetal inflammatory response to maternal infection is also directly implied in the development of brain injury and immature white matter exhibits an intrinsic vulnerability to oxidative injury. Non-protein-bound iron (NPBI), measured by a new spectrophotometric method, is a potent pro-oxidant through its capacity to catalyze the formation of the highly toxic hydroxyl radical. The aims of the study were to evaluate: (a) inflammatory activation expressed as pro-inflammatory cytokines in CSF from infants with birth asphyxia as well as preterm infants with posthemorrhagic ventricular dilatation (PHVD) and subsequent high risk for white matter injury. (b) extracellular levels of NPBI in different areas of the brain under normal conditions as well as during hypoxia and reoxygenation in newborn piglets. (d) the content of NPBI in CSF from preterm infants with PHVD. CSF was obtained from asphyxiated term infants and term control infants within 72 h from birth and from preterm infants with PHVD and preterm control infants approximately two weeks after birth. Newborn piglets were subjected to hypoxia-reoxygenation according to a model that produces clinical encephalopathy and neuropathological changes similar to those seen in term asphyxiated infants. Samples for NPBI analysis were obtained by microdialysis probes inserted into vulnerable parts of the piglet brain. There was a significant increase of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL- 6 and IL- 8 in CSF after birth asphyxia. IL- 6 and IL- 8 levels correlated with the degree of encephalopathy and IL- 6 correlated with outcome. The CSF levels of IL- 1 b, IL- 6, IL- 8, and TNF-a were elevated in infants with PHVD. NPBI was detected in all examined areas of the piglet brain under normal conditions and increased during early reoxygenation after hypoxia. NPBI was detected frequently and at high levels in CSF from infants with PHVD. Conclusions: Birth asphyxia elicits an inflammatory response with elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines in CSF and elevated cytokine levels are associated with severe clinical course and abnormal outcome. Preterm infants with PHVD exhibit an intense inflammatory response in CSF weeks after the original insult, but at this late time-point no correlation with morphological brain injury or outcome is found. NPBI is present in brain extracellular space under normal conditions and increases during reoxygenation after hypoxia. NPBI is also elevated in CSF from infants with PHVD. Elevated levels of NPBI imply impaired iron-regulation and an increased risk for oxidative injur...|$|R
40|$|In {{patients}} with HIV encephalitis, activated macrophages and microglial {{cells in the}} brain are infected by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV- 1). Immune activation can release <b>neurotoxic</b> chemicals including <b>cytokines,</b> free radicals, autocoids, and hydrolytic enzymes. In this study, the presence of hydrolytic enzymes in acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) -related neurodegeneration was addressed. Activities of four lysosomal hydrolases were assayed in the frontal lobe of 69 males who died with AIDS and 31 age-matched control men. Activities of all four enzymes were increased significantly (1. 6 to 3. 6 times) in white matter of {{patients with}} AIDS. Less pronounced increases were present in cerebral cortex. Of 69 of the subjects with AIDS, 50 (72 %), {{had at least one}} abnormally active enzyme. Patients with HIV encephalitis and other neuropathological changes were affected as were many subjects without any clear neuropathological anomaly. Lysosomal cathepsin D immunostaining revealed increased lysosomes within perivascular macrophages, multinucleated cells, activated microglial cells, and hypertrophic astrocytes. Increased enzyme activity was correlated significantly with assay results for HIV- 1 DNA using the polymerase chain reaction. The release of acid hydrolases associated with cerebral HIV- 1 infection could lead to unopposed hydrolysis of matrix and surface proteins.

40|$|Two {{cellular}} {{processes of}} central importance to cancer and neurodegeneration are apoptosis and cellular senescence. Both are {{a means of}} cellular suicide that are utilized in time- and context-dependent manners and have important evolutionary purposes. However, {{they are also the}} drivers of many deleterious processes underlying cancer and neurodegeneration. Many of the cellular responses to aging and age-related diseases, including apoptosis and senescence, converge on the tumor suppressor pathway, p 53. Here I examine the molecular basis for loss of cell polarity and accelerated cell death mediated by apoptosis stimulating protein of p 53 2 (ASPP 2) in neurodegeneration. In this study we find that ASPP 2 mediates STAT 1 Linduced apoptosis. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induces ASPP 2 mRNA expression in vitro. Also, LPS induces nuclear ASPP 2 in vivo at the blood-cerebral spinal fluid-barrier (BCSFB), the brain's barrier to inflammation. Consistent with ASPP 2 's role as a gatekeeper to inflammation, ASPP 2 mutant mouse brains possess enhanced neuroinflammation. Elevated ASPP 2 expression is also observed in mouse models and human neuroinflammatory disease tissue in astrocytes. The identification of ASPP 2 as a novel transcriptional target of STAT 1 and the observed increase in ASPP 2 expression in both mouse and human neuroinflammatory disorders, suggests that the identified STAT 1 /ASPP 2 pathway may connect tumor suppression and cell polarity to neuroinflammation. Additionally, I investigate the regulation of cellular senescence by p 53 isoforms as a means to enhance neuroprotection of astrocytes in chronic neurodegenerative diseases, Alzheimer's disease (AD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Here we report that p 53 isoforms, Δ 133 p 53 and p 53 β, are endogenous regulators of cellular senescence in the central nervous system (CNS). Δ 133 p 53 functions as a dominant-negative regulator of full-length (FL) Lp 53 and represses senescence, while p 53 β as a co-activator of FLLp 53, promotes senescence. In neurodegenerative disease brain tissue, FLL 53 and p 53 β are upregulated while Δ 133 p 53 is downregulated. We demonstrate that Δ 133 p 53 and p 53 β directly regulate astrocyte senescence, including the release of key <b>neurotoxic</b> proL inflammatory <b>cytokines</b> such as ILL 6 and ILL 1 β. Also, we show that the p 53 isoform switch that occurs during aging and neurodegeneration promotes neuronal toxicity using coL culture experiments with human iPSC-derived motor neurons and human astrocytes. We also demonstrate that astrocyte senescence can be rescued through overexpression of Δ 133 p 53, revealing a promising therapeutic approach to delay or inhibit the progression of neurodegeneration. </p...|$|R
