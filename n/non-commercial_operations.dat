25|$|Ownership of {{the airport}} has changed {{a number of times}} over the years but the airport was wholly owned by Blackpool Borough Council until 2004 when it was sold to a {{consortium}} led by Wolverhampton Airport operators City Hopper Ltd (CHAL), who operated it until May 2008 when Balfour Beatty purchased MAR Property's 95% stake; Blackpool Borough Council having retained 5%. The remaining 5% is held by Blackpool Borough Council. During 2014 Balfour Beatty claimed to be looking for a buyer for the airport and then after just one month announced that it was to close the Airport. On 15 October 2014, the airport's terminal and Air Traffic Control provision was closed with the last scheduled flights to Dublin & Isle of Man leaving in the late afternoon. In November 2014, the former company formed a new company called Squires Gate Airport Operations Ltd and the airport reopened once again in December 2014 for <b>non-commercial</b> <b>operations.</b>|$|E

50|$|The $380,000 {{paid for}} the {{frequency}} was the second highest sum paid for any frequency {{in the country in}} this auction round. The last Waiheke Island frequency auctioned, in 2003, also went for a very large sum, $378,000. The effect of the high prices paid was that Waiheke interests were priced out of the market as there is not sufficient population to support either a commercial or <b>non-commercial</b> <b>operation</b> that had to recover such an amount.|$|R

5000|$|It was {{announced}} on September 21, 2009 that the WGBH Educational Foundation would acquire WCRB from Nassau and convert {{the station to}} <b>non-commercial</b> <b>operation,</b> complementing sister station WGBH (89.7 FM). The sale was completed on December 1. Since assuming control of WCRB, WGBH has sought to expand {{the reach of the}} station, particularly to areas that had been served by the station prior to the frequency shift in 2006; WCRB's programming was added to WNCK, which formerly simulcast WGBH, concurrent with the sale's completion, and April 8, 2010, W242AA also switched from carrying WGBH to WCRB, via the 89.7 HD-2 simulcast. WJMF began carrying WCRB programming in September 2011; since the frequency change in 2006, Providence {{had been one of the}} largest markets without access to a full-time classical music station. Because of this expanded reach, the station rebranded from 99.5 All Classical (the branding used since the sale to WGBH) to Classical New England on October 3, 2011. As of 2015, the station is branded as [...] "Classical Radio Boston, 99.5 WCRB." ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{focus of}} Indonesian {{forestry}} has shifted considerably {{since the beginning}} of the + 30 *s as the sector has developed from a largely <b>non-commercial</b> <b>operation</b> into one of the most important components of the economy, supporting national development and foreign exchange earnings in the three decades since the early seventies. However, rapid development of timber-based industries on the one hand and a lack of e#ort in securing regeneration of logged-over areas on the other, has resulted in forest degradation in many parts of Indonesia’s major islands where commercial timber trees are available. Changes in land use policy to accommodate human resettlement, agriculture and the development of estate crop plantations, which for the most part have been short-lived, have also contributed to deforestation and land degradation. Furthermore, forest fires, illegal logging and the subsequent illicit trade have become major issues which need to be addressed not only by the forestry sector itself, but also by related parties at various levels. Along with the country’s economic restructuring, the forestry sector has also undergone reform. In reviewing the structure of the sector so as to better address the various problems it faces, the Ministry of Forestry has identified five priority areas as the focus of its programme of activities for the period from,**+ to,** [...] Over the next twenty years forest policy will be directed towards rehabilitation of degraded forest land and conservation of the remaining forest. This paper describes and analyses the policy trends within Indonesian forestry over the last three decade...|$|R
40|$|The {{current study}} {{investigated}} the role of organizational influencers on motivating foodservice employees to follow safe food handling practices. Data were collected from 311 employees (60 % response rate) in either commercial or non-commercial foodservice organizations with no supervisory responsibilities. This research identified employee’s level of agreement with eight organizational influencers that motivate them to follow safe food handling practices and determined if employees of different demographics reported different levels of agreement. Results showed facilities (providing needed resources) and value (placing value on food safety) {{were the most important}} organizational influencers motivating employees in both commercial and <b>non-commercial</b> foodservice <b>operations.</b> Age, work status, and years of foodservice experience significantly impacted which organizational influencers motivated commercial employees. However, all eight organizational influencers motivated non-commercial employees irrespective of demographic differences. Future research could test a comprehensive measure of organizational influencers to investigate the role of organization on employee safe food handling practices...|$|R
5000|$|WNED-FM first {{signed on}} as a {{commercial}} radio station on June 6, 1960, with the call letters WEBR-FM. [...] It was a sister station to AM 970 WEBR (now WDCZ). In the early 1970s, WEBR-FM was renamed WBCE and then WREZ. In 1975, the Western New York Educational TV Association bought it and AM 970 WEBR, turning both stations into <b>non-commercial</b> <b>operations.</b> In 1977, 94.5 was renamed WNED-FM and began offering a classical music format that same year. WNED-FM is the only station exclusively broadcasting classical music 24 {{hours a day in}} the Buffalo/Toronto media markets.

40|$|E-commerce {{technologies}} have many possible applications both in commercial and <b>non-commercial</b> <b>operations.</b> The {{development and implementation}} of these applications is on the increase especially by government and its agencies, for the delivery of services. Specific to this study is the distribution of old age pension benefits to recipients that reside in the rural areas of South Africa. Of importance to this study are the factors that promote and impinge on the development, implementation and acceptance of these applications. A specific project, the Pension Biometric Project was implemented by the South African Post Office in line with the government's initiatives of improving service delivery, and in response to the encroaching digital economy. The research problem is to investigate the pensioners' perception and their experience of three areas of this project, its implementation, its acceptance and its uses and impact. The research was conducted in the constructivist paradigm, using the case study research method. Three data collection methods were used, i. e. a document study of SAPO project documentation, on-site observations and interviews with pensioners. It was found that despite problems in implementation, the pensioners were accepting of the new system, although they were ignorant of the functionalities of the smart card. Consequently, few pensioners were making use of the banking facilities of the card, or had changed their economic behaviour. The study has also found that two themes are overriding all findings of the study. These two themes are ignorance and dignity. Ignorance has had a causal effect on adoption of the smart cards and dignity {{has been found to be}} a result of the project. The overriding implication of this study is that pensioners' ignorance around issues of service delivery by government and its agencies needs to be eradicated, otherwise there is no reliable way of measuring efforts against actual delivery. Also, the fact that dignity has emerged as an overriding theme needs to be deliberately strengthened, and maybe even driven as a specified objective of the Pension Biometric Project. Recommendations in this regard are provided as well as ideas for further research...|$|E
50|$|The FCC {{granted a}} {{construction}} permit {{to build the}} station in 2002. In June 2005, the station — at the time holding the call sign KHFR — received permission from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to start test broadcasts, and was officially licensed on December 15, 2005. The station was originally owned by Family Radio, a <b>non-commercial</b> and non-profit <b>operation</b> headed by Harold Camping. The station sold no airtime, as the few outside ministries that air on Family Radio are not charged {{to be on the}} air. Programming included traditional Christian music, along with conservative fundamentalist teaching and preaching.|$|R
40|$|The first North American {{outbreak}} of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) involving a virus of Eurasian A/goose/Guangdong/ 1 / 1996 (H 5 N 1) lineage {{began in the}} Fraser Valley of British Columbia, Canada in late November 2014. A total of 11 commercial and 1 <b>non-commercial</b> (backyard) <b>operations</b> were infected before the outbreak was terminated. Control measures included movement restrictions that were placed on a total of 404 individual premises, 150 of which were located within a 3  km radius of an infected premise(s) (IP). A complete epidemiological investigation revealed {{that the source of}} this HPAI H 5 N 2 virus for 4 of the commercial IPs and the single non-commercial IP likely involved indirect contact with wild birds. Three IPs were associated with the movement of birds or service providers and localized/environmental spread was suspected as the source of infection for the remaining 4 IPs. Viral phylogenies, as determined by Bayesian Inference and Maximum Likelihood methods, were used to validate the epidemiologically inferred transmission network. The phylogenetic clustering of concatenated viral genomes and the median-joining phylogenetic network of the viruses supported, for the most part, the transmission network that was inferred by the epidemiologic analysis...|$|R
30|$|One {{argument}} {{often used}} to promote application of single-tree selection and also for alternative silvicultural approaches is {{the benefit of the}} production of high value, i.e., large diameter and high-quality trees (e.g., “Dutch cuttings”, see Schütz et al. 2012) (often in conjunction with the decreased need for <b>non-commercial</b> thinning <b>operations).</b> As markets have shifted, and in regions where much of the wood-processing industry has re-tooled to efficiently process smaller logs, large logs now may have no premium (per unit of volume), and in some cases may even have price penalties (Fitzgerald et al. 2013). This issue will vary by species and may be alleviated by sawmilling innovation in response to a higher availability of predicted assortments from alternative silviculture. In the meantime, in many regions, the theoretically higher mill recovery from larger diameter logs is often offset by the faster speed when processing homogenous (in terms of size and quality) logs, especially in high-volume sawmills. Concerns also exist about lower log quality for trees that grow in highly variable conditions throughout their lives. This variability can exhibit itself in somewhat adverse branching patterns, including large branch sizes and higher variation in juvenile wood, wood density, and growth rings (Schütz 1999 b; Macdonald et al. 2010; Piispanen et al. 2014).|$|R
