50|$|In aerodynamics, <b>wing</b> <b>loading</b> is {{the total}} mass of an {{aircraft}} divided by the area of its wing. The stalling speed of an aircraft in straight, level flight is partly determined by its <b>wing</b> <b>loading.</b> An aircraft with a low <b>wing</b> <b>loading</b> has a larger wing area relative to its mass, as compared to an aircraft with a high <b>wing</b> <b>loading.</b>|$|R
50|$|Wing {{loading of}} parachutes is {{measured}} similarly {{to that of}} aircraft, comparing exit weight to area of parachute fabric. Typical <b>wing</b> <b>loading</b> for students, accuracy competitors, and BASE jumpers is less than 5 kg per square meter - often 0.3 kilograms per square meter or less. Most student skydivers fly with <b>wing</b> <b>loading</b> below 5 kg per square meter. Most sport jumpers fly with <b>wing</b> <b>loading</b> between 5 and 7 kg per square meter, but many interested in performance landings exceed this <b>wing</b> <b>loading.</b> Professional Canopy pilots compete with <b>wing</b> <b>loading</b> of 10 to over 15 kilograms per square meter. While ram-air parachutes with <b>wing</b> <b>loading</b> higher than 20 kilograms per square meter have been landed, this is strictly the realm of professional test jumpers.|$|R
40|$|Flight {{speed is}} {{expected}} to increase with mass and <b>wing</b> <b>loading</b> among flying animals and aircraft for fundamental aerodynamic reasons. Assuming geometrical and dynamical similarity, cruising flight speed is predicted to vary as (body mass) (1 / 6) and (<b>wing</b> <b>loading)</b> (1 / 2) among bird species. To test these scaling rules and the general importance of mass and <b>wing</b> <b>loading</b> for bird flight speeds, we used tracking radar to measure flapping flight speeds of individuals or flocks of migrating birds visually identified to species as well as their altitude and winds at the altitudes where the birds were flying. Equivalent airspeeds (airspeeds corrected to sea level air density, Ue) of 138 species, ranging 0. 01 - 10 kg in mass, were analysed in relation to biometry and phylogeny. Scaling exponents in relation to mass and <b>wing</b> <b>loading</b> were significantly smaller than predicted (about 0. 12 and 0. 32, respectively, with similar results for analyses based on species and independent phylogenetic contrasts). These low scaling exponents {{may be the result of}} evolutionary restrictions on bird flight-speed range, counteracting too slow flight speeds among species with low <b>wing</b> <b>loading</b> and too fast speeds among species with high <b>wing</b> <b>loading.</b> This compression of speed range is partly attained through geometric differences, with aspect ratio showing a positive relationship with body mass and <b>wing</b> <b>loading,</b> but additional factors are required to fully explain the small scaling exponent of Ue in relation to <b>wing</b> <b>loading.</b> Furthermore, mass and <b>wing</b> <b>loading</b> accounted for only a limited proportion of the variation in Ue. Phylogeny was a powerful factor, in combination with <b>wing</b> <b>loading,</b> to account for the variation in Ue. These results demonstrate that functional flight adaptations and constraints associated with different evolutionary lineages have an important influence on cruising flapping flight speed that goes beyond the general aerodynamic scaling effects of mass and <b>wing</b> <b>loading...</b>|$|R
50|$|Modern gliders {{often use}} water ballast {{carried in the}} wings to {{increase}} <b>wing</b> <b>loading</b> when soaring conditions are strong. By increasing the <b>wing</b> <b>loading</b> the average speed achieved across country can be increased {{to take advantage of}} strong thermals. With a higher <b>wing</b> <b>loading,</b> a given lift-to-drag ratio is achieved at a higher airspeed than with a lower <b>wing</b> <b>loading,</b> and this allows a faster average speed across country. The ballast can be ejected overboard when conditions weaken to maximize glider cross-country speed in gliding competitions.|$|R

5000|$|A further {{complication}} with <b>wing</b> <b>loading</b> {{is that it}} {{is difficult}} to substantially alter the wing area of an existing aircraft design (although modest improvements are possible). As aircraft are developed they are prone to [...] "weight growth"—the addition of equipment and features that substantially increase the operating mass of the aircraft. An aircraft whose <b>wing</b> <b>loading</b> is moderate in its original design may end up with very high <b>wing</b> <b>loading</b> as new equipment is added. Although engines can be replaced or upgraded for additional thrust, the effects on turning and takeoff performance resulting from higher <b>wing</b> <b>loading</b> are not so easily reconciled.|$|R
5000|$|As {{stalling}} {{is due to}} <b>wing</b> <b>loading</b> {{and maximum}} lift coefficient at a given altitude and speed, this limits the turning radius due to maximum load factor.At Mach 0.85 and 0.7 lift coefficient, a <b>wing</b> <b>loading</b> of [...] can reach a structural limit of 7.33 g up to 15,000 feet and then decreases to 2.3 g at 40,000 feet while with a <b>wing</b> <b>loading</b> of [...] the load factor is twice smaller and barely reach 1g at 40,000 feet.|$|R
