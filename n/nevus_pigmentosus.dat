40|$|Reed nevus (pigmented {{spindle cell}} nevus) is a nevus with the histopathological {{features}} of abundant melanin, monomorphic spindle-epithelioid melanocytes, spindle cell nests confined within the epidermis and papillary dermis, and occasional upward interepidermal progression of melanocytes. Here, we reported an unusual case of Reed nevus in an 11 -month-old Japanese male infant. Infantile Reed nevus {{should be included}} as a differential diagnosis for <b>nevus</b> <b>pigmentosus</b> in infancy...|$|E
40|$|Cathepsin D is an aspartic {{lysosomal}} endopeptidase {{present in}} most mammalian cells. Overexpression of cathepsin D {{is associated with}} the progression of several human cancers including melanoma. We examined the expression levels of cathepsin D in 20 primary malignant melanomas, 20 metastatic malignant melanomas, 20 benign <b>nevus</b> <b>pigmentosus</b> and 10 normal skin samples in Japanese. In normal skin, granular or dotted pattern of positive staining was observed along the granular layer of epidermis and hair follicle with apparent moderate to strong staining in sebaceous and eccrine glands. The percent positivity and staining intensity of cathepsin D in primary and metastatic malignant melanomas were significantly higher than that of <b>nevus</b> <b>pigmentosus.</b> Moreover, the expression levels of cathepsin D in metastatic malignant melanomas were significantly higher than those of primary malignant melanomas. Data from our and previous reports strongly supports a notion that the upregulation of cathepsin D may be critically involved in the malignant transformation and progression of melanocytic tumors. カテプシンDはリソゾーム内に存在するエンドペプチダーゼであるが, 胃癌, 乳癌, 卵巣癌などでは周辺正常組織に比べ, 過剰発現していることが知られている. 悪性黒色腫においても, その過剰発現が 2 編の文献報告で知られているが, 日本人を対象とした検討は行われていない. 我々は, 20 例の原発性悪性黒色腫, 20 例の転移性悪性黒色腫, 20 例の良性色素細胞母班, 10 例の健常皮膚を用いて, カテプシンD の発現を免疫組織学的に検討した. 正常皮膚では, カテプシンDは表皮および毛囊の上層・顆粒層に顆粒状に発現しており, 脂腺やエクリン汗腺では強い発現を認めた. 原発性悪性黒色腫や転移性悪性黒色腫のカテプシンDの発現は, 良性色素細胞母班のそれよりも有意に上昇していた. また転移性悪性黒色腫では, 原発性悪性黒色腫よりも有意に高い発現が認められた. これらの結果から, カテプシンDの発現は色素細胞の悪性化と腫瘍進展に関与していると考えられた...|$|E
40|$|We {{hypothesize that}} {{dysregulated}} expression {{levels of the}} developmental regulatory genes in the adult body result in tumor development and malignant progression. PAX genes discovered as human orthologous genes of Drosophila 'paired' encode transcription factors, which control the expression of target genes to go on along the program of development. In this study, we first quantified expression of 9 PAX genes in human <b>nevus</b> <b>pigmentosus</b> tissues, melanoma tissues and melanoma cell lines by the real-time reverse transcription-PCR method. As a result, {{we found that the}} expression levels of PAX 4 and PAX 9 were extremely low in melanoma tissues and cell lines compared to <b>nevus</b> <b>pigmentosus</b> tissues. We then established melanoma cells overexpressing PAX 4 and examined roles of PAX 4 in cell growth. PAX 4 -overexpression reduced in vitro cell growth of human melanoma C 8161 and MeWo cells. BrdU-uptake assay and cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry indicated that the retardation of cell proliferation by PAX 4 -overexpression was due to decreased DNA synthesis and cell cycle arrest at the G 0 /G 1 phase. Furthermore, treatment of C 8161 and MeWo cells with 5 -azacytidine, a DNA demethylating agent, induced the expression of PAX 4, suggesting that DNA methylation repressed the PAX 4 gene expression in human melanoma. These results suggest that PAX 4 functions as a potent tumor suppressor...|$|E
40|$|The {{expression}} of nPKCμ, a Ca++-independent isoform of protein kinase C in normal human skin, and skin from patients with psoriasis, squamous cell carcinoma, basal cell epithelioma, <b>nevus</b> <b>pigmentosus,</b> and seborrheic keratosis, were examined by immunohistochemical staining using a polyclonal antibody raised against a synthetic peptide at a diverse {{region of the}} nPKCμ molecule. In normal epidermis, the strongest staining was observed in the uppermost granular layer with no staining of the spinous or basal layers. The inner layer of the intra-epidermal eccrine duct was also strongly stained. Weak staining was observed in several layers of the outer root sheath of the follicular infundibulum. No staining was detected in the inner root sheath of the hair follicles, hair matrix, sebaceous gland, eccrine gland, intradermal eccrine duct, arrectores pilorum, melanocytes, Langerhans cells, fibroblasts, or blood vessels. In psoriatic skin, stained keratinocytes were distributed in the suprabasal layers with the most being observed in the uppermost layer and the least in layers closed to the basal layer. In squamous cell carcinoma, weak staining was observed in the keratotic cells around horny pearls. In the basal cell epithelioma and <b>nevus</b> <b>pigmentosus,</b> the cells were not stained, whereas in seborrheic keratosis, cells that stained were located in the granular layer. We conclude from the evidence presented above that nPKCμ is expressed in close association with epidermal differentiation in normal skin and skin diseases...|$|E
40|$|The {{presence}} of catecholamine containing cells (chromaffin cells) in human skin was deter-mined by fixation with chromate-bichromate solution followd by post-staining and other methods. Some {{of the brown}} pigment granules in chromated dermis stained with Giemsa and toluidine blue showed similar staining properties to chromaffin cells in rabbit adrenal medulla treated in the same way. They also were seen in large numbers in <b>nevus</b> <b>pigmentosus,</b> especially in blue nevi, but were rarely seen in various lesions of Recklinghausen's disease nor in atopic dermatitis. Judging from other results, this dermal brown pigment is probably not catechol-amine but melanin or a degradation product of melanin. Other possibilities {{of the nature of}} the granules are discussed with special reference to lipid pigment...|$|E
40|$|A 2 -day- old male newborn was {{consulted}} to our {{clinic for}} cutaneous vascular and pigmentary lesions. The pregnancy {{of his mother}} and family history were unremarkable. Physi-cal examination showed bilateral nevus flammeus involving the scalp, face, neck, trunk, upper part of the back, scrotum and the flexor sides of arms and thighs. Large, bluish-grey pigmentation was observed on the abdominal area, back, but-tocks, legs and the extensor sides of the arms (Figure 1 a, b). Laboratory examination, abdominal ultrasound imaging and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain were normal. Sys-temic involvement was not detected. Phacomatosis pigmento-vascularis (PPV) type IIa was diagnosed. Phacomatosis pigmentovascularis is a rare disorder char-acterized by the coexistence of vascular malformations and pigmentary lesions of skin. The first description of the disease was reported by Ota et al. (1), and Hasegawa et al. (2) clas-sified the disease into four types. Nevus flammeus was the constant vascular malformation for all types. The associated pigmentary lesions were <b>nevus</b> <b>pigmentosus</b> et verrucosus in type I, Mongolian spots with or without nevus anemicus i...|$|E
