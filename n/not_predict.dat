5|$|Lili posed {{a threat}} to Bermuda, and a {{hurricane}} warning as the storm approached, but only gusty winds and light rainfall was reported. As Lili continued westward, it had also posed a significant threat to the East Coast of the United States, since some of the computer models did <b>not</b> <b>predict</b> a northward curve. As a result, several hurricane watches and warnings were issued from Little River Inlet, South Carolina, to Cape Henlopen, Delaware. However, Lili later curved northward, and only caused minor coastal erosion in North Carolina and rainfall in Pennsylvania. Lili began impacting Atlantic Canada as it was transitioning an extratropical cyclone, and the storm reportedly caused strong winds in Nova Scotia and Newfoundland. No damage total or fatalities were reported.|$|E
5|$|Philippe moved {{farther north}} {{skirting}} the low {{and continued to}} weaken gradually. The official forecast did <b>not</b> <b>predict</b> this, primarily {{as a result of}} some models indicating a reintensification to hurricane status. Philippe began to loop around the center of the non-tropical system, weakening as it did so. As Philippe turned towards Bermuda it weakened into a tropical depression on September 22. The depression degenerated into a remnant low the next day and this remnant continued to loop cyclonically and could be tracked for a further day or two within the circulation of the non-tropical system.|$|E

5|$|Tropical Depression Nine-E was {{influenced}} by a high pressure area located over Mexico, causing it to move 16mph (26km/h) to the north-west. The depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Hernan overnight as the storm became more organized. Although Hernan was located over warm waters, moderate wind shear prevented the storm from intensifying quickly, and the storm slowed. Hernan slowly became better organized throughout the night, but wind shear continued to impair Hernan through the morning; as a result, most of the tropical cyclone forecast models did <b>not</b> <b>predict</b> Hernan to become a hurricane.|$|E
5|$|Some psychologists {{believe that}} 'while object {{permanence}} alone may <b>not</b> <b>predict</b> communicative achievement, object permanence {{along with several}} other sensorimotor milestones, plays a critical role in, and interacts with, the communicative development of children with severe disabilities'. This was observed in 2006, in a study recognizing where the full mastery of object permanence {{is one of the}} milestones that ties into a child's ability to engage in mental representation. Along with the relationship with language acquisition, object permanence is also related to the achievement of self-recognition. This same study also focused specifically on the effects that Down syndrome has on object permanence. They found that the reason why the children that participated were so successful in acquiring object permanence, was due to their social strength in imitation. Along with imitation being a potential factor in the success, another factor that could impact children with Down syndrome could also be the willingness of the child to cooperate.|$|E

25|$|Several {{studies have}} {{proposed}} that the hiatus has been caused in part by increased sulfur emissions from volcanic activity.
