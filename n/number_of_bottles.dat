25|$|Faced {{with the}} {{upcoming}} scheduled {{maintenance of the}} mold-making machinery, over the next 24 hours Dean sketched out a concept drawing which was approved by Root the next morning. Dean then proceeded to create a bottle mold and produced a small <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>bottles</b> before the glass-molding machinery was turned off.|$|E
60|$|She busied {{herself with}} drawing the corks of a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>bottles,</b> which she then {{transferred}} {{from the end of}} the room where she stood to the tables at which sat her customers; she also brought out some fresh glasses. Béla watched her for a moment or two in silence, unconscious of the fact that he, too, was being watched by a pair of pale eyes in which lurked a gleam of jealousy and of hate. Suddenly, as Klara brushed past him carrying bottles and glasses, he took hold of her by the elbow and drew her close to him.|$|E
60|$|Here all was {{prepared}} for their meal, with an epicurean delicacy, which rather belonged to the saloon of a palace, than the cabin {{in which it was}} displayed. Four dishes of silver, with covers of the same metal, smoked on the table; and three seats were placed for the company. Beside {{the lower end of the}} board, was a small side-table, to answer the purpose of what is now called a dumb waiter; on which several flasks reared their tall, stately, and swan-like crests, above glasses and rummers. Clean covers were also placed within reach; and a small travelling-case of morocco, hooped with silver, displayed a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>bottles,</b> containing the most approved sauces that culinary ingenuity had then invented.|$|E

6000|$|... "DEAR GEORGE--As White's {{two bottles}} of Burgundy and a pack of cards {{constitute}} all the joys of your life, I take for granted {{that you are in}} London at this moment, preferring smoke and faro to fresh air and fresh haystacks. This will be delivered to you by a young gentleman with whom I have lately made acquaintance, and whom you will be charmed to know. He will play with you at any game for any stake, up to any hour of the night, and drink any reasonable <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>bottles</b> during the play. Mr. Warrington is no other than the Fortunate Youth about whom so many stories have been told in the Public Advertiser and other prints. He has an estate in Virginia as big as Yorkshire, with the incumbrance of a mother, the reigning Sovereign; but, as the country is unwholesome, and fevers plentiful, let us hope that Mrs. Esmond will die soon, and leave this virtuous lad in undisturbed possession. She is aunt of that polisson of a Castlewood, who never pays his play-debts, unless he is more honourable in his dealings with you than he has been with me. Mr. W. is de bonne race. We must have him of our society, if it be only that I may win my money back from him.|$|E
60|$|While Mr. Addison was abroad, {{and after}} he came home in rather a dismal way to wait upon Providence in his shabby lodging in the Haymarket, young Captain Steele was cutting a much smarter figure than that of his {{classical}} friend of Charterhouse Cloister and Maudlin Walk. Could not some painter give an interview between the gallant captain of Lucas’s, with his hat cocked, and his lace, and his face too, a trifle tarnished with drink, and that poet, that philosopher, pale, proud, and poor, his friend and monitor of schooldays, of all days? How Dick must have bragged about his chances and his hopes, and the fine company he kept, and the charms of the reigning toasts and popular actresses, and the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>bottles</b> that he and my lord and some other pretty fellows had cracked overnight at the “Devil”, or the “Garter”! Cannot one fancy Joseph Addison’s calm smile and cold grey eyes following Dick for an instant, as he struts down the Mall, to dine with the Guard at St. James’s, before he turns, with his sober pace and threadbare suit, to walk back to his lodgings up the two pair of stairs? Steele’s name was down for promotion, Dick always said himself, in the glorious, pious, and immortal William’s last table-book. Jonathan Swift’s name had been written there by the same hand too.|$|E
6000|$|The office {{which was}} (or should have been) {{the point of}} rest for so many {{evolving}} dollars stood {{in the heart of}} the city--a high and spacious room, with many plate-glass windows. A glazed cabinet of polished red-wood offered to the eye a regiment of some two hundred bottles conspicuously labelled. These were all charged with Pinkerton's Thirteen Star, although from across the room it would have required an expert to distinguish them from the same <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>bottles</b> of Courvoisier. I used to twit my friend with this resemblance, and propose a new edition of the pamphlet, with the title thus improved, [...] "Why Drink French Brandy, When We give You the same Labels?" [...] The doors of the cabinet revolved all day upon their hinges; and if there entered any one who was a stranger to the merits of the brand, he departed laden with a bottle. When I used to protest at this extravagance, [...] "My dear Loudon," [...] Pinkerton would cry, [...] "you don't seem to catch on to business principles! The prime cost of the spirit is literally nothing. I couldn't find a cheaper advertisement if I tried." [...] Against the side-post of the cabinet there leaned a gaudy umbrella, preserved there as a relic. It appears that when Pinkerton was about to place Thirteen Star upon the market, the rainy season was at hand. He lay dark, almost in penury, awaiting the first shower, at which, as upon a signal, the main thoroughfares became dotted with his agents, vendors of advertisements; and the whole world of San Francisco, from the business-man fleeing for the ferry-boat, to the lady waiting at the corner for her car, sheltered itself under umbrellas with this strange device: Are you wet? Try Thirteen Star. [...] "It was a mammoth boom," [...] said Pinkerton, with a sigh of delighted recollection. [...] "There wasn't another umbrella to be seen. I stood at this window, Loudon, feasting my eyes; and I declare, I felt like Vanderbilt." [...] And it was to this neat application of the local climate that he owed, not only much of the sale of Thirteen Star, but the whole business of his advertising agency.|$|E

50|$|Norway {{has limited}} {{availability}} of beers on tap in pubs and nightclubs. This {{is due to}} the custom of each pub signing a contract with one brewery, limiting them to providing draught beer from that brewery. In exchange, the brewery will provide the bar with all the systems required for pulling beer, including tanks, taps, and glasses. In place of the tap selection, bars often carry a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>bottled</b> beers. However, these usually carry a much higher price tag.|$|R
