25|$|The {{stone walls}} were {{originally}} {{to have been}} inscribed {{with the names of}} all Canada's servicemen and women who had died during the First World War; but, without enough space for all 66,000 names, it was later decided to place Books of Remembrance there instead; the books list all Canadian soldiers, airmen, and seamen who died in service of the Crown—whether that of Britain (before 1931) or that of Canada (after 1931)—or allied countries in foreign wars, including the Nile Expedition and Boer War, the First World War, the Second World War, and the Korean War.

25|$|With Lérida captured, {{new orders}} arrived from Napoleon to seize Tortosa. The new {{commander}} in Catalonia, Marshal Jacques MacDonald was {{ordered by the}} emperor to cooperate with Suchet. In July, Suchet sent a force close to Tortosa while he assembled his siege equipment at Mequinenza. At the beginning of August, Henry O'Donnell led 2,500 Spanish regulars to Tortosa. On 3 August, O'Donnell marched out of Tortosa to attack Laval's division, which was watching the city. The Spanish troops broke through the first defensive line but were unable to defeat the French and had to retreat. O'Donnell subsequently returned to Tarragona. Soon afterward, Suchet chased away the Army of Valencia which was threatening the force in front of Tortosa. By mid-August, MacDonald and 16,000 soldiers were finally cooperating with Suchet. Laval died of fever at Mora de Rubielos on 6 September 1810. His <b>name</b> <b>is</b> <b>on</b> the Arc de Triomphe on Column 36.|$|E
25|$|According to {{the book}} Who Killed Karen Silkwood, the {{assassination}} scene in the movie The China Syndrome, in which the character Hector's car is run off the road, {{is based on a}} theorized version of Silkwood's death. In the film, the power plant's agents come up behind Hector's vehicle and ram him, repeatedly, from behind until a device on their front bumper engages his rear bumper and lets them lift the rear end of his vehicle off the road, thereby pushing his car over a cliff. Subsequently, police officers remove the evidence from his vehicle and hand it to the villains because their company's <b>name</b> <b>is</b> <b>on</b> the documents. This could be construed as an attempt by the film's producers to influence the jury in the Silkwood case. According {{to the book}}, it was for this reason that the jury was forbidden from seeing that then-new movie while they were hearing the case and deliberating.|$|E

500|$|The scorebook {{hangs in}} the {{pavilion}} at Clifton to this day. The scorers faced a difficult task in accurately recording the innings. One of them, Edward Peglar, {{is said to have}} remarked that Collins's score was [...] "628, plus or minus twenty shall we say". The other scorer for the match was J.W. Hall, whose father in 1868 had batted with Edward Tylecote, who later played Test cricket for England and whose <b>name</b> <b>is</b> <b>on</b> a poem kept with the Ashes urn. Tylecote had earlier set a world-record score of 404 not out in 1868, also at Clifton. Hall later wrote that [...] "The bowling probably deserved all the lordly contempt with which Collins treated it, sending a considerable number of pulls full pitch over the fives courts into the swimming baths to the danger of the occupants." ...|$|E
500|$|The spire {{underwent}} a restoration that {{was completed in}} 1995. The joints in the now-closed observation deck were polished, and the facade restored, {{as part of a}} $1.5 million project. [...] Some damaged steel strips of the needle were replaced and several parts of the gargoyles were re-welded together. The cleaning received the New York Landmarks Conservancy's Lucy G. Moses Preservation Award for 1997. Cooke died in 1997, and debtors moved to foreclose on the estate's unpaid fees soon after. Tishman Speyer Properties and the Travelers Insurance Group bought the Chrysler Center in 1997–1998 for about $220million (equal to $ million in [...] ) from a consortium of banks and the estate of Jack Kent Cooke. Tishman Speyer Properties had negotiated a 150-year lease from the Cooper Union, and the college continues to own the land under the Chrysler Building.

500|$|Wenger conceded {{his opponents}} were the better side, but praised his team's resolve, telling reporters: [...] "It was {{important}} to score the first goal and with neither team scoring it remained tight for a long, long period. There were some times {{in the second half}} when we were a bit lucky but we defended very well and to keep a clean sheet is good." [...] He admitted his players had practiced taking penalties, but was quick to point out [...] "you don't score because of the practising – keeping your nerve is more important." [...] Lehmann, who had been side-lined by Wenger {{during the course of the}} season, credited his teammates for scoring all five penalties, and described it as a [...] "big mental achievement." [...] Cole called Arsenal's win a [...] "…great team performance, we didn't have too many chances but we defended really well and battled really hard." [...] Henry, who sat out the final due to injury expressed sympathy for Manchester United, and recollected a similar experience from his early Arsenal career: [...] "I know how they feel because we lost against Liverpool and did not deserve to lose. If your <b>name</b> <b>is</b> <b>on</b> the cup you win it." ...|$|E
