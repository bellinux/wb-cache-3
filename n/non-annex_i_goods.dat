Further determining factors are differences in the abatement potentials between Annex <b>I</b> and <b>non-Annex</b> <b>I</b> countries, and market power on the certificate market.

40|$|We {{present and}} apply a simple bottom–up model for {{estimating}} non-energy use {{of fossil fuels}} and resulting CO 2 (carbon dioxide) emissions. We apply this model for the year 2000 : (1) {{to the world as}} a whole, (2) to the aggregate of Annex <b>I</b> countries and <b>non-Annex</b> <b>I</b> countries, and (3) to the ten <b>non-Annex</b> <b>I</b> countries with the highest consumption of fossil fuels for non-energy purposes. We find that worldwide non-energy use is equivalent to 1, 670 ± 120 Mt (megatonnes) CO 2 and leads to 700 ± 90 Mt CO 2 emissions. Around 75 % of non-energy use emissions is related to industrial processes. The remainder is attributed to the emission source categories of solvent and other product use, agriculture, and waste. Annex I countries account for 51 % (360 ± 50 Mt CO 2) and <b>non-Annex</b> <b>I</b> countries for 49 % (340 ± 70 Mt CO 2) of worldwide non-energy use emissions.

40|$|The {{ultimate}} {{objective of}} the Framework Convention on Climate Change is the stabilisation of greenhouse gases concentration in the atmosphere {{at a level that}} will prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.

40|$|The {{historical}} responsibility of countries {{listed in the}} Annex I of the Convention on Climate Change has been used extensively as a justification {{for the lack of}} action of countries not included in Annex I to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. We analyzed the contribution of <b>non-Annex</b> <b>I</b> countries to the CO 2 emissions in the period 1850 - 2006 to assess their relative contribution to total CO 2 emissions. In the period 1980 - 2006 <b>non-Annex</b> <b>I</b> countries represented 44 % of the total but this contribution increased in the period 1990 - 2006 to 48 %. If we extrapolate present trends to 2020 they will represent 56 % in the period 1990 - 2020. The "{{historical responsibility}}" of Annex I countries is therefore decreasing. If we take 1990 as the starting year in which the Climate Convention recognized clearly that greenhouse gases are interfering dangerously with the climate system, it becomes very difficult to attribute "blame" and "guilt" to Annex I for their historical contributions. It becomes also quite clear the need of <b>non-Annex</b> <b>I</b> countries to engage with Annex I countries in the effort to reduce emissions.

40|$|This paper {{employs a}} three-stage {{approach}} to estimate low carbon economy efficiency {{in the largest}} twenty CO 2 emitting countries from 2000 to 2012. The approach includes the following three stages: (1) use of a data envelopment analysis (DEA) model with undesirable output to estimate the low carbon economy efficiency and calculate the input and output slacks; (2) use of a stochastic frontier approach to eliminate the impacts of external environment variables on these slacks; (3) re-estimation of the efficiency with adjusted inputs and outputs to reflect {{the capacity of the}} government to develop a low carbon economy. The results indicate that the low carbon economy efficiency performances in these countries had worsened during the studied period. The performances in the third stage are larger than that in the first stage. Moreover, in general, low carbon economy efficiency in Annex I countries of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is better than that in <b>Non-Annex</b> <b>I</b> countries. However, the gap of the average efficiency score between Annex <b>I</b> and <b>Non-Annex</b> <b>I</b> countries in the first stage is smaller than that in the third stage. It implies that the external environment variables show greater influence on <b>Non-Annex</b> <b>I</b> countries than that on Annex I countries. These external environment variables should be taken into account in the transnational negotiation of the responsibility of promoting CO 2 reductions. Most importantly, the developed countries (mostly in Annex I) should help the developing countries (mostly in <b>Non-Annex</b> <b>I)</b> to reduce carbon emission by opening or expanding the trade, such as encouraging the import and export of the energy-saving and sharing emission reduction technology...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} address carbon leakage and {{preserve}} the competitiveness of domestic industries, some industrialized Annex I countries have proposed to implement carbon tariffs. These tariffs would be levied on energy-intensive imports from developing <b>non-Annex</b> <b>I</b> countries that have not agreed to binding emissions reductions. This action could have detrimental welfare impacts, especially on those developing countries, and may not lead to significant reductions in leakage. A recent proposal {{is to use the}} revenues generated from carbon tariffs to finance clean development in the relevant exporting <b>non-Annex</b> <b>I</b> countries. This proposal is evaluated using an energy-economic model of the global economy. The model is supplemented by marginal abatement cost curves and bottom-up information on abatement potentials in order to represent how clean development financing affects emissions reductions. The results indicate that carbon tariffs could raise US$ 3. 5 - 24. 5 billion (with a central value of $ 9. 8 billion) for clean development financing. This could reduce the emissions of <b>non-Annex</b> <b>I</b> countries by 5 - 15 % and still leave funds available for other purposes, such as adaptation. Furthermore, recycling the revenues generated from carbon tariffs back to the exporting country itself could alleviate some of the negative welfare impacts associated with them. However, a net negative impact especially on the welfare and gross domestic product of developing countries would remain. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC...|$|R
