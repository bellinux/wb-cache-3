40|$|An {{increasing}} number of firms outsource peripheral functions {{in order to stay}} focused on their core capabilities. This paper contributes to a limited body of empirical research on the relationship between intermediate inputs offshoring and firm productivity. We use a unique firm-level panel data set of Slovenian manufacturing firms operating in the period 1994 – 2005 with a detailed accounting information and foreign trade data. Using propensity score matching techniques combined with the difference-in-differences approach, We analyze whether firms that start importing intermediate inputs become more productive. The results imply that <b>new</b> <b>importers</b> exhibit temporal boost in productivity growth and increase productivity level relative to non-importing control group over a medium term. In the first year, offshoring brings about a 20 % increase in labour productivity and an equivalent growth of total factor productivity. Despite the short-lived year-on-year growth rates of productivity in excess of non-importers, cumulative gain in productivity of <b>new</b> <b>importers</b> after four years remains significant at around 37 % for labour productivity and 35 % for total factor productivity...|$|E

40|$|Magnesium is an {{essential}} divalent metal that serves many cellular functions. While most divalent cations are maintained at relatively low intracellular concentrations, magnesium is maintained {{at a higher level}} (, 0. 5 – 2. 0 mM). Three families of transport proteins were previously identified for magnesium import: CorA, MgtE, and MgtA/MgtB P-type ATPases. In the current study, we find that expression of a bacterial protein unrelated to these transporters can fully restore growth to a bacterial mutant that lacks known magnesium transporters, suggesting it is a <b>new</b> <b>importer</b> for magnesium. We demonstrate that this transport activity is likely to be specific rather than resulting from substrate promiscuity because the proteins are incapable of manganese import. This magnesium transport protein is distantly related to the Nramp family of proteins, which have been shown to transport divalent cations but have never been shown to recognize magnesium. We also find gene expression of the new magnesium transporter to be controlled by a magnesium-sensing riboswitch. Importantly, we find additional examples of riboswitch-regulated homologues, suggesting that they are a frequent occurrence in bacteria. Therefore, our aggregate data discover a new and perhaps broadly important path for magnesium import and highlight how identification of riboswitch RNAs can help shed light on new, and sometimes unexpected...|$|R
