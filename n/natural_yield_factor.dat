The work uses the Monte Carlo technique of circuit simulation {{to obtain an}} unbiased estimation of the yield. A simple graphical analysis tool, the <b>yield</b> <b>factor</b> histogram, is presented. The <b>yield</b> <b>factor</b> histograms are generated by a new computer program called SPICENTER. Using the <b>yield</b> <b>factor</b> histograms, the most sensitive circuit parameters are noted, and their nominal values are changed to improve the yield.

40|$|The term {{structure}} {{of interest rates}} is often summarized using a handful of <b>yield</b> <b>factors</b> that capture shifts {{in the shape of}} the yield curve. In this paper, we develop a comprehensive model for volatility dynamics in the level, slope, and curvature factors that simultaneously includes level and GARCH effects along with regime shifts. We show that the level of the short-rate is useful in modeling the volatility of the three <b>yield</b> <b>factors</b> and that there is significant GARCH effects present even after including a level effect. We also study the effect of interest rate volatility on the level of the <b>yield</b> <b>factors</b> and report evidence that is consistent with a ”flight-to-cash”. Furthermore, we show that allowing for regime shifts in the factor volatilities dramatically improves the model’s fit and strengthens the level effect. Finally, we discuss how the dynamics of <b>yield</b> <b>factors</b> we identify could potentially be used to discriminate between alternative term structure models...|$|R
50|$|While {{absolute}} grain yield variations {{exist between}} different global locations {{as cited in}} this article, the potential for improved rain fed grain yields may be less than is suggested by a comparison between sub-Saharan and European locations for example, this applies particularly in areas where grain yield is primarily determined by the growing season rainfall. A more accurate formula for measuring yield potential is y x a = X, where X is grain yield in Kg/hectare, y is millimetres of growing season rainfall and a is the variable <b>yield</b> <b>factor,</b> a number that may vary somewhere between 5 and 20. Thus assuming a variable <b>yield</b> <b>factor</b> of 15 and a growing season rainfall of 220mm the formula would express as 220mm x 15 = 3300 kg/ha yield potential.This formula, while not taking account of either the carryover benefits of stored rainfall in the soil profile resulting from out of season rainfall or the impact of temperature or soil fertility, still gives a more accurate picture {{of the degree to}} which actual grain yields are matching the region's potential yields and is a better basis for comparison between very different regions such as Europe and the sub-Sahara.A European yield of 5000 kg/ha from a rainfall of 500mm results in a variable <b>yield</b> <b>factor</b> of 10 while a yield of 2500 kg/ha in a 200mm rainfall area has a variable <b>yield</b> <b>factor</b> of 12.5, in such an example the lower yielding crop has actually been 25% more efficient in its rainfall utilisation than the higher yielding crop. Agronomy needs to be based on attaining the highest possible variable <b>yield</b> <b>factor</b> rather than the highest absolute <b>yield,</b> <b>factor</b> numbers as high as 17+ are achievable.|$|R
40|$|An {{extensive}} literature {{examines the}} dynamics of interest rates, with particular attention given to the positive relationship between interest-rate volatility {{and the level of}} interest rates—the so-called level effect. This paper examines the interaction bet^'een the estimated level effect and competing parameterisations of interest-rate volatility for the Australian yield curve. We adopt a new methodology that estimates elasticity in a multivariate setting that explicitly accommodates the correlations that exist between various <b>yield</b> <b>factors.</b> Results show that significant correlations exist betM>een the residuals of <b>yield</b> <b>factors</b> and that such correlations do indeed impact on model estimates. Within the multivariate setting, the level of the short rate is shown to be a crucial determinant of the conditional volatility of all three <b>yield</b> <b>factors.</b> Measures of model fit suggest that, in addition to the usual level effect, the incorporation of GARCH effects and possible regime shifts is important.

40|$|We {{introduce}} a Nelson-Siegel type {{interest rate term structure}} model with the underlying <b>yield</b> <b>factors</b> following autoregressive processes revealing time-varying stochastic volatility. The factor volatilities capture risk inherent {{to the term}} struc- ture and are associated with the time-varying uncertainty of the yield curve’s level, slope and curvature. Estimating the model based on U. S. government bond yields applying Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques we find that the <b>yield</b> <b>factors</b> and factor volatilities follow highly persistent processes. Using the extracted factors to explain one-year-ahead bond excess returns we observe that the slope and cur- vature <b>yield</b> <b>factors</b> contain the same explanatory power as the return-forecasting factor recently proposed by Cochrane and Piazzesi (2005). Moreover, we identify slope and curvature risk as important additional determinants of future excess returns. Finally, we illustrate that the <b>yield</b> and volatility <b>factors</b> are closely con- nected to variables reflecting macroeconomic activity, inflation, monetary policy and employment growth. It is shown that the extracted yield curve components have long-term prediction power for macroeconomic fundamentals.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{evaluate}} the risks faced by fed cattle producers. With the development of livestock insurance programs as part of the Agricultural Risk Protection Act of 2000, a thorough investigation into the probabilistic measures of individual risk factors is needed. This research jointly models cattle production <b>yield</b> risk <b>factors,</b> using a multivariate dynamic regression model. A multivariate framework is necessary to characterize yield risk in terms of four <b>yield</b> <b>factors</b> (dry matter feed conversion, averaged daily gain, mortality, and veterinary costs), which are highly correlated. Additionally, a conditional Tobit model is used to handle censored yield variables (e. g., mortality). The proposed econometric model estimates parameters that influence the mean and variance of each production <b>yield</b> <b>factor,</b> as well as the covariance between variables. Following the model fitting using a maximum likelihood approach, simulation methods allow for profits, revenue, and gross margins to be evaluated given different assumptions concerning volatility among other shocks.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2014 This {{dissertation}} {{includes three}} chapters {{in which the}} first two are on return predictability {{and the third is}} on yield curve and <b>yield</b> <b>factors.</b> The abstract of each of them is as follows: 1), This paper proposes using capital gains instead of total returns in return predictability tests. Total return predictability can be inferred from capital gain predictability since total returns with dividends are highly correlated with returns based on capital gains only. An exact linear relationship exists among log dividend growth, log capital gain and log dividend price ratio. This exact linear relationship has similar implication as the Campbell-Shiller (1988) linear approximation but is more precise and easier for predictability tests. I verify the standard empirical findings on return predictability using capital gain predictability. Separation of price change and dividend change also leads to a new finding: shocks to dividend growth is shown to have significant positive correlation with shocks to dividend price ratio in the vector autoregressive regression (VAR) rather than close to zero as shown in previous literature. 2), This paper tests the return predictability of the cyclical and trend components in the log dividend price ratio. The log dividend ratio is found to have a near-unit root trend factor if the expectation of the future discount factor is highly persistent. We use Bayesian analysis and the Kalman filter to extract the strictly stationary and near-random-walk components in the log dividend price ratio. The extracted cyclical process can predict one-year ahead total returns during the post-war period and one-year ahead dividend growth rates during the pre-war and war period with notable R^ 2. We also demonstrate a reverse of predictability: returns become more predictable while dividend growth rates become more unpredictable. 3), This paper examines the fourth principal component of the yields matrix, which is largely ignored in macro-finance forecasting applications, in the context of predicting excess bond returns. Using yields data from the Fama-Bliss and the Federal Reserve, we present the significant in-sample and out-of-sample predictive power of models including the fourth <b>yield</b> <b>factor.</b> Additionally, the "return-forecasting factor" in Cochrane and Piazzesi (2005) is shown to be a restricted linear combination of all <b>yield</b> <b>factors</b> and to be highly correlated with the second and fourth factors.

40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to draw {{attention}} to calculations on the environmental effects of agriculture and to the definition of marginal agricultural yield. When calculating the environmental impacts of agricultural activities, the real environmental load generated by agriculture is not revealed properly through ecological footprint indicators, as the type of agricultural farming (thus the nature of the pollution it creates) is not incorporated in the calculation. It is commonly known that extensive farming uses relatively small amounts of labor and capital. It produces a lower yield per unit of land and thus requires more land than intensive farming practices to produce similar yields, so it has a larger crop and grazing footprint. However, intensive farms, to achieve higher yields, apply fertilizers, insecticides, herbicides, etc., and cultivation and harvesting are often mechanized. In this study, the focus is on highlighting the differences in the environmental impacts of extensive and intensive farming practices through a statistical analysis of the <b>factors</b> determining agricultural <b>yield.</b> A marginal function is constructed for the relation between chemical fertilizer use and yield per unit fertilizer input. Furthermore, a proposal is presented for how calculation of the <b>yield</b> <b>factor</b> could possibly be improved. The <b>yield</b> <b>factor</b> used in the calculation of biocapacity is not the marginal yield for a given area, but is calculated from the real and actual yields, and this way biocapacity and the ecological footprint for cropland are equivalent. Calculations for cropland biocapacity do not show the area needed for sustainable production, but rather the actual land area used for agricultural production. The proposal the authors present is a modification of the <b>yield</b> <b>factor</b> and also the changed biocapacity is calculated. The results of statistical analyses reveal the need for a clarification of the methodology for calculating marginal yield, which could clearly contribute to assessing the real environmental impacts of agriculture...|$|R
