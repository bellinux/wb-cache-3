50|$|The {{most common}} type of {{rearrangement}} leading to a <b>neocentromere</b> is an inverted duplication, categorized as Class I. The resulting marker chromosome consists of two copies of the chromosome segment. Each of the two copies is a mirror image to the chromosome segment. The <b>neocentromere</b> forms at an interstitial site, between the break point and one of the telomeres. It is interesting that despite having identical sequences in two halves of the chromosome, the <b>neocentromere</b> is only formed once. In some cases, segregation of these chromosomes result in partial trisomy, and at other times, a partial tetrasomy. In partial tetrasomy, the karyotype appears normal except for the marker chromosome.|$|E
50|$|Although not {{discussed}} explicitly {{in relation to}} neocentromeres, {{it is worth noting}} that the breakage-fusion-bridge cycle involves ring chromosomes too. Particularly, these ring chromosomes involved in breakage-fusion-bridge cycles have a relatively high percentage of prevalence in lipomatous tumors and a lower but still notable prevalence in lung and acute myelogenous leukemia, according to the Mitelman Database. Perhaps further studying of ring chromosomes and diseases, from the perspective of <b>neocentromere</b> formation, may shed light on mechanisms of tumor formation due to chromosome abnormalities. For example, one may question whether the ring chromosomes present in tumors contain a <b>neocentromere</b> following a Class II deletion, because the <b>neocentromere</b> may or may not be present on the ring.|$|E
50|$|As well as autosomes, human neocentromeres {{have also}} been {{observed}} in sex chromosomes, and correlate with some sex-linked diseases. In 1999, analysis of a <b>neocentromere</b> in the Y chromosome with a constriction site in the amniocytes of a 38-year-old woman, and in her husband and brother-in-law served as experimental evidence that neocentromeres can be stably transmitted through meiosis into the next generation. Not only is the <b>neocentromere</b> viable on a chromosome, it is also sufficient for allowing proper male sex determination. What is interesting is that these meiotically transmitted neocentric markers show mosaicism, which many think are due to mitotic instability. However, in contrary, others also think that mosaicism could be developed post-zygotically and hence {{may not be a}} result of mitotic instability. Post-zygotic formation happens when the function of the <b>neocentromere</b> is not established at the time of meiotic rearrangement.|$|E
40|$|Rye {{terminal}} <b>neocentromeres</b> {{were analyzed}} in various aspects. Plants {{with and without}} <b>neocentromeres</b> were crossed to determine the possible genetic control on their formation. The segregation obtained in our work {{is consistent with the}} hypothesis of two trans-acting genes determining neocentric activity {{in such a way that}} individuals with no <b>neocentromeres</b> at all would carry all non-activating alleles, whereas one activating allele might permit the activation of a few <b>neocentromeres.</b> Individuals with four activating alleles would show the maximum frequency of <b>neocentromeres</b> per cell. Anti-tubulin immunolabelling was used to visualize the interaction between the <b>neocentromeres</b> and the microtubules. In most cases an end-on interaction between <b>neocentromeres</b> and microtubules was observed, but a few <b>neocentromeres</b> were observed free of them. Spikes were irradiated at early meiosis to determine whether acentric fragments carrying subtelomeric heterochromatin were able to behave as <b>neocentromeres.</b> In no case were acentric fragments observed to form an extension polewards as they did in whole chromosomes. Broken chromosomes joined by a thin thread of chromatin to the centromeric region showed neocentric activity, strongly suggesting that subtelomeric sequences need a cis-acting centromere to be active as <b>neocentromeres.</b> No Full Tex...|$|R
50|$|<b>Neocentromeres</b> {{have been}} {{detected}} in human cancers, even though the observed frequency of <b>neocentromeres</b> in the population is relatively low. There is {{a strong correlation between}} <b>neocentromeres</b> and a specific class (ALP-WDLPS) of lipomatous tumors. It has been observed that lipomatous tumors with alphoid sequences in the centromere are more aggressive and metastatic. Hence, one suggestion is that <b>neocentromeres</b> may quickly evolve into a centromere with alpha satellite but the correlation between repetitive sequence and aggressiveness of tumors remains unclear.|$|R
50|$|Mechanisms of {{formation}} of <b>neocentromeres</b> are still unclear, {{but a few}} have been proposed. It is strongly speculated that <b>neocentromeres</b> form during mitosis or meiosis.|$|R
50|$|A rough {{estimation}} approximates that <b>neocentromere</b> formation on inverted duplicated chromosomes {{happens every}} 70,000-200,000 live births. However, this statistic {{does not include}} Class II rearrangements.|$|E
50|$|Neocentromeres {{have also}} been {{reported}} in lung carcinoma and acute myeloid leukemia. It may be worth noting that neocentromeres in cancer may occur more frequently than currently observed, because many cancer screenings involving karyotyping do not use assays that detect <b>neocentromere</b> formations.|$|E
50|$|Centric {{heterochromatin}} {{is usually}} formed on alpha satellite DNA in humans; however, {{there have been}} cases where centric heterochromatin and centromeres have formed on originally euchromatin domains lacking alpha satellite DNA; this usually happens {{as a result of}} a chromosome breakage event and the formed centromere is called a <b>neocentromere.</b>|$|E
50|$|A {{decade after}} the initial {{observation}} of <b>neocentromeres,</b> 60 more cases of human <b>neocentromeres</b> from across the genome, not just chromosome 10, were documented by 2002. These cases were also typically observed in children with developmental delay or congenital abnormalities. By 2012, more than 90 cases of human <b>neocentromeres</b> across 20 different chromosomes have been described.|$|R
50|$|Another {{element to}} {{consider}} from the evolutionary stand {{point is that}} because <b>neocentromeres</b> are viable and can be transmitted meiotically {{from one generation to}} the next, we should ask whether or not <b>neocentromeres</b> play a role in species evolution. Recently, it was shown in Drosophila that co-evolution of CENPA and its chaperone CAL1 may explain species incompatibility. This incompatibility exists between centromeric histones. This is an interesting observation and encourages <b>neocentromeres</b> to be studied along with their chaperones, to see if <b>neocentromeres</b> may also perhaps have “neo-chaperones” accompanying them.|$|R
50|$|<b>Neocentromeres</b> are new centromeres {{that form}} {{at a place}} on the {{chromosome}} that is usually not centromeric. They typically arise due to disruption of the normal centromere. These <b>neocentromeres</b> {{should not be confused with}} “knobs”, which were also described as “neocentromeres” in maize in the 1950s. Unlike most normal centromeres, <b>neocentromeres</b> do not contain satellite sequences that are highly repetitive but instead consist of unique sequences. Despite this, most <b>neocentromeres</b> are still able to carry out the functions of normal centromeres in regulating chromosome segregation and inheritance. This raises many questions on what is necessary versus what is sufficient for constituting a centromere.|$|R
50|$|Another case of mosaicism {{has been}} {{observed}} in a 15-year-old girl with a neocentric X chromosome. Her clinical features, along with cytogenetic and FISH analyses confirm {{that this is the}} first case of a mosaic Turner syndrome involving a <b>neocentromere.</b> During the time of this experiment, only two other cases of neocentric X chromosomes had been observed thus far, making this experiment the third. One of the two previous cases was also confirmed to be Turner syndrome but was not mosaic. An interaction of interest here would be between neocentromeres and the XIST gene, which is responsible for X-inactivation. It has been suggested that the abnormality caused by neocentromeres may account for the selective inactivation of the abnormal X chromosome in this patient. Taking into account that only fewer than 5% of Turner syndrome cases are mosaic, one may consider, likewise with <b>neocentromere</b> assays in cancer, that neocentromeres may occur at a higher frequency in mosaic Turner syndrome than observed.|$|E
50|$|Replenishment of CENPA every cycle, {{which is}} {{important}} for reestablishing centromere identity, is carried out by HJURP (Holliday Junction Recognition Protein), or Scm3 in fungi and CAL1 in Drosophila. Tethering HJURP to a non-centromeric locus can {{give rise to a}} <b>neocentromere,</b> even after the disassociation of HJURP. Interestingly, {{there seems to be a}} co-evolutionary relationship between the Drosophila chaperone CAL1 and CENPA which accounts for species incompatibility—this is discussed more below.|$|E
50|$|In {{rare cases}} in humans, neocentromeres can form at new {{sites on the}} chromosome. There are {{currently}} over 90 known human neocentromeres identified on 20 different chromosomes. The formation of a <b>neocentromere</b> must be coupled with the inactivation of the previous centromere, since chromosomes with two functional centromeres (Dicentric chromosome) will result in chromosome breakage during mitosis. In some unusual cases human neocentromeres have been observed to form spontaneously on fragmented chromosomes. Some of these new positions were originally euchromatic and lack alpha satellite DNA altogether.|$|E
50|$|Studies {{suggest that}} <b>neocentromeres</b> are {{ultimately}} formed from epigenetic processes, {{rather than from}} changes in DNA sequence. There is a general consensus that <b>neocentromeres</b> result from an attempt to fix chromosomes that lack a conventional centromere, through chromosome rearrangements.|$|R
50|$|Human centromeres usually {{consist of}} 2000-4000 kilobases of a 171 base pair repeat unit. This alpha {{satellite}} {{is not present}} at all in human <b>neocentromeres.</b> By 2008, more than 90 reported cases of human <b>neocentromeres</b> were detected on marker chromosomes that experienced a loss of centromere, and a subsequent rearrangement. Common traits among these human <b>neocentromeres</b> include being analphoid, staining C-band negative, containing a primary constriction site, and binding to essential centromere proteins that signal {{the presence of a}} kinetochore.|$|R
50|$|<b>Neocentromeres</b> were {{discovered}} relatively recently. They were first observed by Andy Choo {{in a human}} karyotype clinic case in 1997, using fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and cytogenetic analysis. The <b>neocentromeres</b> were observed on chromosome 10 of a patient, who was a child with developmental delays.|$|R
50|$|On {{the other}} hand, Class II marker {{chromosomes}} {{result from the}} second most common type of rearrangement: interstitial deletions. A chromosome is rearranged to give a ring chromosome, and a linear chromosome. Hence, in hindsight, the first observation of neocentromeres made by Andy Choo in 1997 was most likely an example of a Class II pericentric interstitial deletion, followed by a complex rearrangement. The <b>neocentromere</b> can either appear on the linear chromosome or on the ring chromosome, depending on which ever one lacks a centromere.|$|E
50|$|Findings {{in model}} organisms, namely {{inducing}} neocentromerization in chicken and fungal systems, have {{brought up a}} few more correlations for thought. Specifically, in chicken DT40 cells, {{it was found that}} neither histone modifications nor early replication timing is associated with <b>neocentromere</b> formation. Moreover, it was also found that neocentromeres form on both transcriptionally active and inactive loci, challenging the widely accepted notion that centromeres do not appear on coding regions of the chromosome. This leads to questions of how neocentromeres may disrupt transcription and expression of those genes.|$|E
50|$|What {{has been}} conserved, or {{appears to have}} been? Nearly all {{eukaryotic}} organisms, apart from budding yeasts (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) have satellite DNA in their normal centromeres. Yeast, Drosophila and mammals all have heterochromatin flanking their centromeres. Interestingly, although the vertebrate chaperone HJURP and the yeast chaperone Scm3 have diverged, their N-terminal domains show striking conservation. On the other hand, frogs and chickens have domains in their chaperones that {{are not at all}} shared with that of yeast. Hence, further research into the mechanistic properties of these chaperones may potentially reveal how they help determine where and what type of centromere and <b>neocentromere</b> form.|$|E

40|$|Supervisors: Professor Andy K. H. Choo & Dr. Lee Wong© 2006 Dr. Nicholas Chau-Lun WongThe Centromere {{is a vital}} {{chromosomal}} {{structure that}} ensures faithful segregation of replicated chromosomes to their respective daughter cells. With such an important structure, one would expect the underlying centromeric DNA sequence would be highly conserved across all species. It {{turns out that the}} underlying centromeric DNA sequences between species ranging from the yeast, fly, mouse to humans are in fact highly diverged suggesting a DNA sequence independent or an epigenetic mechanism of centromere formation. Neocentromeres are centromeres that form de-novo at genomic locations that are devoid of highly repetitive a-satellite DNA sequences of which normal centromeres are usually comprised from. To date, the 10 q 25 <b>neocentromere</b> is the most well-characterised, fully functional human centromere that has been used previously to characterise the extent of a number of centromeric protein binding domains and characterise the properties of the underlying DNA sequence. Along with other factors, the existence of neocentromeres has given rise to a hypothesis where centromeres are defined by epigenetic or DNA sequence independent mechanisms. The putative 10 q 25 <b>neocentromere</b> domain was recently redefined by high resolution mapping of Centromeric protein A (CENP-A) binding through a chromatin immunoprecipitation and array (CIA) analysis. The underlying DNA sequence was investigated to determine and confirm that the formation of the 10 q 25 <b>neocentromere</b> was through an epigenetic mechanism. Through a high-density restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis using overlapping PCR amplified DNA derived from genomic DNA representing the 10 q 25 region before and after <b>neocentromere</b> activation. No sequence polymorphisms, large insertions or deletions were detected and confirmed the epigenetic hypothesis of centromere formation. DNA methylation is one of many epigenetic factors that are important for cellular differentiation, gene regulation and genomic imprinting. As the mechanisms and functions of DNA methylation have been well characterised, its role at the 10 q 25 <b>neocentromere</b> was investigated to try and identify the candidate epigenetic mechanism involved in the formation of centromeres. DNA methylation across the <b>neocentromere</b> was assessed using sodium bisulfite PCR and sequencing of selected CpG islands located across the 10 q 25 <b>neocentromere.</b> Overall, the methylation level of the selected CpG islands demonstrated no difference in DNA methylation before and after <b>neocentromere</b> activation. However, significant hypomethylation upon <b>neocentromere</b> formation was detected close to the protein-binding domain boundaries mapped previously suggesting that this may have a role in demarcating protein binding domains at the <b>neocentromere.</b> Further analysis of DNA methylation investigated non-CpG island methylation at sites defined as CpG islets and CpG orphans. Interestingly, the DNA methylation level measured at selected CpG islets and CpG orphans across the 10 q 25 <b>neocentromere</b> were not completely hypermethylated as previously thought, but demonstrated variable methylation that became fully hypermethylated upon <b>neocentromere</b> activation in most sites investigated. These results suggested that a role for DNA methylation existed at the 10 q 25 <b>neocentromere</b> and that it occurred at sites devoid of CpG islands. This study has found that DNA methylation at non-CpG island sites was variable contrary to popular belief and, was linked with <b>neocentromere</b> formation through the observation of increased DNA methylation at the 10 q 25 <b>neocentromere.</b> Inhibition of DNA methylation demonstrated increased <b>neocentromere</b> instability and a decrease in methylation of these CpG islets and CpG orphans confirming the importance of DNA methylation at neocentromeres. This study has characterised a new class of sequences that are involved in the maintenance of chromatin structure through DNA methylation at the 10 q 25 <b>neocentromere.</b> Restricted Access: Resource is only available to University of Melbourne staff and students.

40|$|We have {{previously}} identified and characterized {{the phenomenon of}} ectopic human centromeres, known as neocentromeres. Human neocentromeres form epigenetically at euchromatic chromosomal sites and are structurally and functionally similar to normal human centromeres. Recent {{studies have indicated that}} <b>neocentromere</b> formation provides a major mechanism for centromere repositioning, karyotype evolution, and speciation. Using a marker chromosome mardel(10) containing a <b>neocentromere</b> formed at the normal chromosomal 10 q 25 region, we {{have previously}} mapped a 330 -kb CENP-A-binding domain and described an increased prevalence of L 1 retrotransposons in the underlying DNA sequences of the CENP-A-binding clusters. Here, we investigated the potential role of the L 1 retrotransposons in the regulation of <b>neocentromere</b> activity. Determination of the transcriptional activity of a panel of full-length L 1 s (FL-L 1 s) across a 6 -Mb region spanning the 10 q 25 <b>neocentromere</b> chromatin identified one of the FL-L 1 retrotransposons, designated FL-L 1 b and residing centrally within the CENP-A-binding clusters, to be transcriptionally active. We demonstrated the direct incorporation of the FL-L 1 b RNA transcripts into the CENP-A-associated chromatin. RNAi-mediated knockdown of the FL-L 1 b RNA transcripts led to a reduction in CENP-A binding and an impaired mitotic function of the 10 q 25 <b>neocentromere.</b> These results indicate that LINE retrotransposon RNA is a previously undescribed essential structural and functional component of the neocentromeric chromatin and that retrotransposable elements may serve as a critical epigenetic determinant in the chromatin remodelling events leading to <b>neocentromere</b> formation...|$|E
40|$|<b>Neocentromere</b> {{activity}} {{is a classic}} example of nonkinetochore chromosome movement. In maize, neocentromeres are induced by a gene or genes on Abnormal chromosome 10 (Ab 10) which causes heterochromatic knobs to move poleward at meiotic anaphase. Here we describe experiments that test how <b>neocentromere</b> activity affects the function of linked centromere/kinetochores (kinetochores) and whether neocentromeres and kinetochores are mobilized on the spindle by the same mechanism. Using a newly developed system for observing meiotic chromosome congression and segregation in living maize cells, we show that neocentromeres are active from prometaphase through anaphase. During mid-anaphase, normal chromosomes move on the spindle at an average rate of 0. 79 μm/min. The presence of Ab 10 does not affect the rate of normal chromosome movement but propels neocentromeres poleward at rates as high as 1. 4 μm/min. Kinetochore-mediated chromosome movement is only marginally affected by the activity of a linked <b>neocentromere.</b> Combined in situ hybridization/immunocytochemistry is used to demonstrate that unlike kinetochores, neocentromeres associate laterally with microtubules and that <b>neocentromere</b> movement is correlated with knob size. These data suggest that microtubule depolymerization is not required for <b>neocentromere</b> motility. We argue that neocentromeres are mobilized on microtubules by the activity of minus end–directed motor proteins that interact either directly or indirectly with knob DNA sequences...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Evolutionary {{centromere}} repositioning {{and human}} analphoid <b>neocentromeres</b> occurring in clinical cases are, very likely, {{two stages of}} the same phenomenon whose properties still remain substantially obscure. Chromosome 13 is the chromosome with {{the highest number of}} <b>neocentromeres.</b> We reconstructed the mammalian evolutionary history of this chromosome and characterized two human <b>neocentromeres</b> at 13 q 21, in search for information that could improve our understanding of the relationship between evolutionary-new centromeres, inactivated centromeres, and clinical <b>neocentromeres.</b> RESULTS: Chromosome 13 evolution was studied, using FISH experiments, across several diverse superordinal phylogenetic clades spanning > 100 Myrs of evolution. The analysis revealed exceptional conservation among Primates (hominoids, Old World Monkeys, and New World Monkeys), Carnivora (cat), Perissodactyla (horse), and Cetartiodactyla (pig). In contrast, the centromeres in both Old World Monkeys and pig have apparently repositioned independently to a central location (13 q 21). We compared these results to the positions of two human 13 q 21 <b>neocentromeres</b> using chromatin immunoprecipitation and genomic microarrays. CONCLUSIONS: We show that a gene-desert region at 13 q 21, of approximately 3. 9 Mb in size, possesses an inherent potential to form evolutionary-new centromeres over, at least, approximately 95 my of mammalian evolution. The striking absence of genes may represent an important property, making the region tolerant to the extensive pericentromeric reshuffling during subsequent evolution. Comparison of the pericentromeric organization of chromosome 13 in 4 Old World Monkey species revealed many differences in sequence organization. The region contains clusters of duplicons showing peculiar features...|$|R
50|$|That <b>neocentromeres</b> and {{conventional}} centromeres {{do not share}} consistent chromatin environment should also {{be taken into account}} in questioning the epigenetic regulation of centromere formation. The N-terminal tails of histones can be modified in several ways, including phosphorylation, acetylation, methylation and ubiquitination. Although certain histone modifications at centromeres seem to serve a purpose—for example, contributing to a higher order organization of chromatins in mouse centromeres—conventional and <b>neocentromeres</b> share very few modifications but arguably still maintain the same function of a centromere.|$|R

40|$|Neocentromeres are {{functional}} centromeres {{formed in}} chromosome regions outside the normal centromere domains and {{are found in}} {{an increasing number of}} mitotically stable human marker chromosomes in both neoplastic and non-neoplastic cells. We describe here the formation of a <b>neocentromere</b> in a previously undescribed chromosomal region at 1 p 32 →p 36. 1 in an oligospermic patient. Cytogenetic GTL banding analysis and the absence of detectable fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) signals using telomeric probes indicate the marker to be a ring chromosome. The chromosome is negative for CBG banding and is devoid of detectable centromeric α satellite and its associated centromere protein CENP-B, suggesting activation of a <b>neocentromere</b> within the 1 p 32 - 36. 1 region. Functional activity of the <b>neocentromere</b> is shown by the retention of the ring chromosome in 97 % of the patient's lymphocytes and 100 % of his cultured fibroblasts, {{as well as by the}} presence of key centromere binding proteins CENP-E, CENP-F, and INCENP. These results indicate that in addition to CENP-A, CENP-C, and CENP-E described in earlier studies, <b>neocentromere</b> activity can further be defined by CENP-F and INCENP binding.

40|$|Assembly of {{kinetochore}} complexes, involving {{greater than}} one hundred proteins, is essential for chromosome segregation and genome stability. Neocentromeres, or new centromeres, occur when kinetochores assemble de novo, at DNA loci not previously associated with kinetochore proteins, and they restore chromosome segregation to chromosomes lacking a functional centromere. Neocentromeres have been observed {{in a number of}} diseases and may play an evolutionary role in adaptation or speciation. However, the consequences of <b>neocentromere</b> formation on chromosome missegregation rates, gene expression, and three-dimensional (3 D) nuclear structure are not well understood. Here, we used Candida albicans, an organism with small, epigenetically-inherited centromeres, as a model system to study the functions of twenty different <b>neocentromere</b> loci along a single chromosome, chromosome 5. Comparison of <b>neocentromere</b> properties relative to native centromere functions revealed that all twenty neocentromeres mediated chromosome segregation, albeit to different degrees. Some neocentromeres also caused reduced levels of transcription from genes found within the <b>neocentromere</b> region. Furthermore, like native centromeres, neocentromeres clustered in 3 D with active/functional centromeres, indicating that formation of a new centromere mediates the reorganization of 3 D nuclear architecture. This demonstrates that centromere clustering depends on epigenetically defined function and not on the primary DNA sequence, and that <b>neocentromere</b> function is independent of its distance from the native centromere position. Together, the results show that a <b>neocentromere</b> can form at many loci along a chromosome and can support the assembly of a functional kinetochore that exhibits native centromere functions including chromosome segregation accuracy and centromere clustering within the nucleus...|$|E
40|$|The {{centromere}} is a chromatin region specialized for chromosome segregation. Conserved H 3 -variant CENP-A and kinetochore proteins {{are found}} on all active centromeres. These proteins assemble {{to form a}} platform for microtubule binding during cell division. However, centromeric DNA varies greatly among species in terms of size and sequences. Moreover, neocentromeres can form on non-centromeric DNA in endogenous chromosomes and even on exogenously introduced DNA. This suggests that centromere function is not determined by DNA sequences alone. It is proposed that CENP-A and other epigenetic factors specify the centromere location and maintain its function. Several lines of evidence suggest that histone post-translational modifications {{are some of the}} important factors regulating centromere function and identity. In C. elegans, DNA injected into the gonad can concatemerize to form extrachromosomal arrays, or artificial chromosomes (ACs), in embryos produced from the injected gonad. These ACs gain segregation ability in a few cell cycles by forming a new centromere (<b>neocentromere).</b> Importantly, C. elegans ACs gain neocentromeres much easier than Human Artificial Chromosomes (HACs). I used a recently developed real-time AC visualization system in C. elegans to monitor AC segregation and studied the role of histone modifications in <b>neocentromere</b> formation. It is found that H 3 K 9 ac, H 4 ac and H 3 K 27 me 3 are significantly enriched on newly formed C. elegans repetitive ACs when compared to endogenous chromosomes, whereas H 3 K 4 me 2 on ACs and endogenous chromosomes have similar levels. It is hypothesized that the special histone modification pattern on first-generation ACs in C. elegans may have contributed to its relatively efficient <b>neocentromere</b> formation. By tethering the histone deacetylase, HDA- 1, to ACs, H 3 K 9 ac and H 4 ac were depleted on ACs specifically. <b>Neocentromere</b> formation rate of histone acetylations-depleted ACs dropped significantly when compared to wild type. This indicates that histone acetylations may support efficient <b>neocentromere</b> formation in C. elegans. This finding is consistent with a previous study in HACs. We suggest that histone acetylations may promote <b>neocentromere</b> formation by maintaining an open chromatin environment to allow incorporation of CENP-A and other centromeric proteins. On the other hand, H 3 K 27 me 3 is not related to open chromatin. It is usually correlated with repressed transcription. However, it was previously found to be correlated with CENP-A occurrence in C. elegans. Tethering of the H 3 K 27 me 3 -specific histone methyltransferase, MES- 2, to ACs increased H 3 K 27 me 3 level on both ACs and endogenous chromosomes. The <b>neocentromere</b> formation rate of H 3 K 27 me 3 -enriched ACs increased slightly, but was not statistically significant when compared to wild type. This suggests that H 3 K 27 me 3 may be favourable for <b>neocentromere</b> formation, possibly by promoting ectopic CENP-A incorporation or facilitating centromere function. Further study is needed to verify this notion. This study demonstrated the use of C. elegans ACs and tethering of specific histone modifiers to ACs as a tool to study the role of histone modifications in <b>neocentromere</b> formation.
