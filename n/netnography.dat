In addition, participants may alter their reactions/answers when involving in the interviews, focus group and surveys. The main advantage of the <b>netnography</b> is that consumers reveal information, also sensitive details, unasked and voluntarily online naturally, and netnographer could gain this organic information through observation.|$|E
50|$|Though <b>Netnography</b> is {{developed}} from ethnography and {{applied in the}} online settings, {{it is more than}} the application of qualitative research in the form of traditional ethnographic techniques in an online context. There are several characters differentiate <b>Netnography</b> from Ethnography.|$|E
50|$|Compared to surveys, experiments, focus groups, and {{personal}} interviews, <b>netnography</b> {{can be less}} obtrusive. It is conducted using observations in a context that is not fabricated by the researcher. <b>Netnography</b> also is less costly and timelier than focus groups {{and personal}} interviews.|$|E
50|$|This what {{differentiate}} <b>netnography</b> to big-data {{analysis that}} often relies on machine (sentiment analysis, word cloud) {{and also to}} digital ethnography or digital anthropology. These terms : <b>netnography,</b> digital etnography, and digital anthropology are often used interchangeably, {{but they are very}} different.|$|E
5000|$|Research ethics {{may be one}} of {{the most}} {{important}} differences between traditional ethnography and <b>netnography.</b> Ethical concerns over <b>netnography</b> turn on early concerns about whether online forums are to be considered a private or a public site, and about what constitutes informed consent in cyberspace (see [...] ). In a major departure from traditional methods, <b>netnography</b> uses cultural information that is not given specifically, and in confidence, to the researcher. The consumers who originally created the data do not necessarily intend or welcome its use in research representations. <b>Netnography</b> therefore offers specific guidelines regarding when to cite online posters and authors, how to cite them, what to consider in an ethical netnographic representation, when to ask permission, and when permission is not necessary ( [...] ; cf. [...] ).|$|E
5000|$|According to Kozinets, Any netonography {{will fall}} into one of four categories: auto, symbolic, digital or humanist. These types of <b>netnography</b> are defined by {{distinctive}} axiologies and foci. In order to visualize how a <b>netnography</b> is defined one should Imagine a simple 2X2 figure. Along the figure's x-axis we see that a <b>Netnography</b> can be defined by whether or not it supports or challenges the status quo of business and management. In this way we determine a netnography's axiological representation orientation as either [...] "Critical", meant to disrupt, or [...] "Complementary", meant to assist in decision making. If we turn our focus to the y-axis of our imaginary figure, we see then that a <b>netnography</b> can also be categorized by its analytic field focus, or what it examines based on its orientation. A <b>netnography</b> can be deemed [...] "Global" [...] if its focus is on a larger and more general system, or we can think of it as [...] "Local" [...] if it narrows its scope to particular iterations of that more general system.|$|E
50|$|<b>Netnography</b> {{collects}} {{data from}} Internet data, interviews data and fieldnotes.|$|E
50|$|Distinct {{from data}} mining and content analysis, <b>netnography</b> {{as a method}} {{emphasizes}} the cultural contextualizing of online data. This often proves to be challenging in the social-cues-impoverished online context. Because <b>netnography</b> is based primarily upon the observation of textual discourse, ensuring trustworthy interpretations requires a different approach than the balancing of discourse and observed behavior that occurs during in-person ethnography. Although the online landscape mediates social representation and renders problematic the issue of informant identity, <b>netnography</b> seems perfectly amenable to treating behavior or the social act as the ultimate unit of analysis, rather than the individual person.|$|E

5000|$|Digital Netnography: Sits on the {{intersection}} of complementary axiology and global focus. Connects statistical data analysis with cultural understandings, meaning it encompasses {{a large amount of}} social data, but always with drive toward deeper cultural understanding, rather than just statistical trends. Along with symbolic <b>netnography,</b> digital <b>netnography</b> looks to reinforce existing business, management and social practices.|$|E
50|$|The {{difference}} between <b>netnography</b> and digital etnography {{could be seen}} in several ways, but the most obvious one is the research motivation and methodology determined by the purpose. <b>Netnography</b> believe in internet users forming an online community which is highlighted from the substantial daily life, while digital ethnography only treat the digital world as a place to extend their offline data collection to complement the ethnographic research. The methodological framework between them are not typically different, since <b>Netnography</b> mainly use online qualitative techniques and use online quantitative research as a supplement occasionally, while digital ethnography combines both quantitative (e.g. network and co-word analysis) and qualitative (e.g. sentiment and content analysis).|$|E
5000|$|<b>Netnography</b> is {{an online}} {{research}} method originating in ethnography which {{is applied to}} understanding social interaction in contemporary digital communications contexts. It {{is defined as a}} specific set of research practices related to data collection, analysis, research ethics, and representation, rooted in participant observation. In <b>netnography,</b> a significant amount of the data originates in and manifests through the digital traces of naturally occurring public conversations recorded by contemporary communications networks. <b>Netnography</b> uses these conversations as data. It is an interpretive research method that adapts the traditional, in-person participant observation techniques of anthropology to the study of interactions and experiences manifesting through digital communications [...]|$|E

5000|$|As {{research}} practice, <b>netnography</b> has 12 roughly temporal, nonexclusive {{and often}} interacting process levels (Kozinets, 2015): ...|$|E
50|$|There {{are several}} keys to <b>netnography,</b> and they are: emotion/story, the researcher, key source person, and {{cultural}} fluency.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Netnography</b> {{serves as}} an {{effective}} driver of innovation and new product development. Example: Nivea While and Black Deodrogant ...|$|E
5000|$|Number of participants. <b>Netnography</b> {{enables the}} {{researcher}} to investigate a large numbers of people, even more than when using ethnography.|$|E
50|$|<b>Netnography</b> is {{the same}} thing as etnography, but it is {{conducted}} online. It analyses the consumer’s life through blogs, forums, social media and other online contents.|$|E
5000|$|The term <b>netnography</b> is a {{portmanteau}} combining [...] "Internet" [...] or [...] "network" [...] with [...] "ethnography". <b>Netnography</b> {{was originally}} developed in 1995 by marketing professor Robert Kozinets {{as a tool}} to analyze online fan discussions about the Star Trek franchise. The use of the method spread from marketing research and consumer research to a range of other disciplines, including education, library and information sciences, hospitality, tourism, computer science, psychology, sociology, anthropology, geography, urban studies, leisure and game studies, and human sexuality and addiction research.|$|E
5000|$|The {{limitations}} of <b>netnography</b> {{draw from the}} need for researcher interpretive skill, {{and the lack of}} informant identifiers present in the online context that can lead to difficulty generalizing results to groups outside the sample. However, these limitations can be ameliorated somewhat by careful use of convergent data collection methods that bridge offline and online research in a systematic manner, as well as by careful sampling and interpretive approaches ( [...] , 2002). Researchers wishing to generalize the findings of a <b>netnography</b> of a particular online group to other groups must apply careful evaluations of similarity and consider using multiple methods for research triangulation. <b>Netnography</b> is still a relatively new method, and awaits further development and refinement {{at the hands of a}} new generation of Internet-savvy ethnographic researchers. However, several researchers are developing the techniques in social networking sites, virtual worlds, mobile communities, and other novel computer-mediated social domains.|$|E
5000|$|Retroactivity. <b>Netnography</b> could trace back conversations {{several years}} ago so that allow {{researchers}} understand the history or {{the development of a}} topic/community, but ethnography can only study the current situation.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Netnography</b> {{can also}} be used to {{understand}} infrastructures, networks, groups, and any relevant constituent’s online behaviors, and potentially inform us about many elements of their overall lifeworld. Example: Online conversions to Islam ...|$|E
5000|$|Unlike the fetishization of {{big data}} and {{its attempt to}} portray a generic, {{characterization}} of markets in online communities (i.e., frequency of brand engagement), <b>netnography</b> enables researchers [...] "to argue for a central tenet" [...] (Kozinets, 2016, p. 2) that emerges from the collected data that represents a particular market. <b>Netnography</b> has an advantage over ethnography in that it focuses primarily on the context of textual communication and any affiliated multimedia elements, whereas ethnography focuses primarily on physical forms of human communication (e.g., body language) (Bartl et al., p. 168). Since <b>Netnography</b> uses spontaneous data and conducts observation without intruding online users, it is regarded as more naturalistic than other approaches such as interviews, focus groups, surveys and experiments (Kozinets, 2015). While online communication has a relatively shorter duration in efficiency when compared to human communication, the speed in collecting online communication is much faster and far less expensive than traditional in-person ethnography and other qualitative methodologies like focus groups or interviews [...] It is also a challenging approach involving work to tackle unpredictable and abundant data (Kozinets, 2015).|$|E
5000|$|Communication Focus. Ethnography {{comprises}} {{research into}} {{all forms of}} human communication, including body language and tone of voice. <b>Netnography</b> incorporates human online communication, which is textual communication, or some multimedia communication such as video, audio, pictures.|$|E
5000|$|Instantiation phase: A <b>netnography</b> is {{instantiated}} {{in space}} and on time in a specific manner. It can {{take the form of}} one of the four ideal types (symbolic, digital, auto or humanistic) to guide the instantiated representation.|$|E
5000|$|Integration phase: The {{result of}} the <b>netnography</b> is {{detected}} or measured. The final phase is part of its ongoing life in the world. It deals with the integration of findings and discussions with recommended action in the wider world.|$|E
5000|$|Efficiency. <b>Netnography</b> {{tends to}} be less costly and timelier than many other methods because it leverages online {{archives}} and existing technologies to rapidly and efficiently gather and sort relevant data. Netnographic research is faster and cheaper in comparison with ethnographic research.|$|E
5000|$|To key to {{understand}} the culture {{is to find the}} [...] "EUREKA!!" [...] data, a gold-mine, a rich data from key source person, the third factor of <b>netnography.</b> Using the same examples, to find the reason behind perception of brand or the reason behind a brand loyalty, a <b>netnography</b> needs to comb through the comments section, to find the gold mine. One of the examples of gold mine is a genuine comment written by a person with a very strong emotions towards the brand, either it's positive or negative. On the other word, a person who either love or hate the brand with every fiber of his/her being. Find this data, analyse it, and this small, but in-depth data could be the answer of the research question.|$|E
50|$|Fieldnotes: Reflective fieldnotes, {{in which}} ethnographers record their observations, are a time-tested and {{recommended}} method in <b>netnography.</b> Although some netnographies {{have been conducted}} using only observation and download, without the researcher writing a single fieldnote, this non-participant approach draws into question the ethnographic orientation of the investigation.|$|E
50|$|To {{find the}} {{emotional}} story, big data analysis {{is often used}} as a complementary technique, usually {{at the beginning of}} the research. However, instead of scooping a huge amount of data and relying on machine to analyse it, the strength of <b>netnography</b> is contextualized data, human-centered analysis and resonant representation.|$|E
50|$|The {{goal of a}} {{successful}} netnographer is cultural fluency, the last factor of <b>netnography.</b> Cultual fluency means {{that at the end}} of the research, the researcher should be fluent in the symbolic language of the site, and even so knowledgeable about a key person that they have an almost biographical authority regarding them.|$|E
5000|$|Symbolic Netnography: The most {{commonly}} used version of <b>netnography,</b> it is both local and complementary. Utilizes social media information and interaction to render identities around individuals or websites in order to inform business decision making. It tends {{to focus on a}} particular group or field site and illustrate the group's practices, meanings and generate a more action based understanding of particular consumers.|$|E
50|$|The {{alternative}} to both ethnography and <b>netnography</b> {{is to ask}} customers to conduct researches on the company’s behalf. This can be done traditionally, by completing a diary, {{or it may be}} used the TROI(Touchpoint Return On Investment) method, in which the customers notify the company whenever they encounter the brand. The point is to study the customer’s experience without the work of a researcher.|$|E
5000|$|Auto-Netnography: Is the {{critical}} and local form of <b>netnography</b> {{due to the}} fact that the researcher must render the data through their own identity. It can be thought of as an adaption of auto-ethnography as it also contains personal and auto-biographical elements. However, an auto-netnography must also possess a distinctly critical element in its understanding of the netnographers own position in time suffused with technologically mediated communication.|$|E
5000|$|First, {{the emotion}} and the story. <b>Netnography</b> {{combines}} rich samples of communicative and interactions {{flowing through the}} internet: textual, graphic, audio, photographic and & audio-visual. The data then will be analysed using content analysis, semiotic visual analysis, interviews (online and in person), social network analysis {{and the use of}} big data analytic tools and techniques [...] These techniques are employed to find the emotional story behind a subject.|$|E
