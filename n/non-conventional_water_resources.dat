With growing demand due to climate change, booming industrial complexes and population growth, groundwater abstraction {{is no longer a}} sustainable <b>water</b> <b>resource</b> on its own and other methods must be put to increasing use. In Bahrain, non-conventional methods such as desalination and treated sewage effluents (TSE) are increasingly used to meet the water demand for agricultural, municipal and industrial purposes.

40|$|Egypt {{is one of}} the {{countries}} facing great challenges due to its limited <b>water</b> <b>resources</b> represented mainly by its fixed share of the Nile water. The increase in water demand is attributed to the increase in population, the upsurge in industrial activity, and the increase in the new reclaimed farmlands.

The reduction of evaporation losses has recently received increasing attention because of the increase in water demand and the decrease in water availability. The evaporation loss from Lake Naser is an influential factor in the Egyptian water budget.

Rapid population growth and increasing dominance of Israeli occupation over the Palestinian <b>water</b> and land <b>resources</b> exacerbate this problem. Wastewater reuse in agriculture is a potential <b>non-conventional</b> <b>water</b> <b>resource</b> that needs better utilization. Our research studied the enabling environment and the political economy of wastewater reclamation and reuse in Palestine. The research team adopted participatory approach that was based on active involvement of all stakeholders in the various phases and activities of this project. The team organized large number of public meetings and national workshops that gathered policy makers as well as representatives of the stakeholder community. The team also implemented a questionnaire survey to study the public perceptions toward wastewater reuse. The research was concluded by a national symposium that gathered more than 200 persons from this community. The major research findings show a national consensus on the importance of wastewater reclamation and reuse in irrigated agriculture. The results show positive knowledge and perceptions of all stakeholders towards reuse of reclaimed wastewater. It also shows that there is a big gap between various institutions related to the subject. It also shows poor collaboration between the academic/research institutions and policy making. The research also emphasizes the importance of onsite systems, especially grey water, for wastewater treatment and reuse as they are low cost and do not require permission of Israeli occupation.

40|$|As {{a result}} of chronic water scarcity, the {{countries}} of the MENA region (Middle East and Northern Africa) recognize reclaimed wastewater as a <b>non-conventional</b> <b>water</b> <b>resource.</b> Nonetheless, in this region, substantial amounts of the wastewater that are collected are still discharged into the sea or water courses without treatment. Moreover, most of the treated wastewater is not re-used but discharged. The objective of this research is to analyze the technological, regulatory, institutional, financial, and socio-cultural opportunities (incentives) and constraints (disincentives) that influence the adoption of wastewater treatment and reuse for agricultural irrigation in the MENA region based on the experiences of Jordan and Tunisia. A fieldwork was conducted in Jordan and Tunisia to collect data on wastewater treatment, agricultural irrigation with the reclaimed wastewater, and crop marketing and consumption. The data collection in the two countries targeted 72 administrators, 31 wastewater treatment plants, 104 farmers and their irrigated farms, 326 households, and 3 crop markets. Though Jordan and Tunisia have made great strides in raising the proportion of re-used wastewater, their Wastewater Reuse Index (WRI) (which measures the actual reuse rate over the potential one) is still only 27. 8 and 12. 7, respectively. The lack of an integrated wastewater management and reuse policy, and the poor coordination between bureaucracies are major hurdles. Different from the expectation, farmers and customers alike are relatively well prepared to use reclaimed wastewater in irrigation, and to buy crops f r om these fields. However, to raise the WRI, the economic and marketing dimensions of reuse should be better recognized. Notably, pure freshwater should be priced higher and reflect its true scarcity, thus creating a stronger incentive for farmers to buy the reclaimed wastewater. Similarly, better crop market transparency and regulation would increase the confidence of the consumer and remove a disincentive to buy such crops...|$|R

40|$|The {{gap between}} fresh water {{supplies}} and demands in arid zones is rapidly increasing due to {{population growth and}} limited water resources. The population of Egypt increased from 23 million in 1955 to more than 70 million in 2003.

Under these conditions, <b>non-conventional</b> <b>water</b> <b>resources</b> could be the challenge for Egypt to survive. <b>Non-conventional</b> <b>water</b> <b>resources</b> considered in this study include desalination of brackish and sea water and cloud seeding.

It shows that Malthusian narratives of water scarcity leading to conflict are just as mistaken as liberal notions of scarcity leading to cooperation. Instead, relationships of power, rooted in post-colonial state formation, development, conflict and division have motivated financially costly but politically expedient investments in excess capacities, rather than improvement of water management.

40|$|Abstract—In a world {{worried about}} <b>water</b> <b>resources</b> with {{the shadow of}} drought and famine looming all around, the quality of water is as {{important}} as its quantity. The source of all concerns is the constant reduction of per capita quality water for different uses. Iran With an average annual precipitation of 250 mm compared to the 800 mm world average, Iran is considered a water scarce country and the disparity in the rainfall distribution, the limitations of renewable resources and the population concentration in the margins of desert and water scarce areas have intensified the problem. The shortage of per capita renewable freshwater and its poor quality in large areas of the country, which have saline, brackish or hard <b>water</b> <b>resources,</b> and the profusion of natural and artificial pollutant have caused the deterioration of water quality. Among methods of treatment and use of these waters one can refer to the application of membrane technologies, which have come into focus in recent years due to their great advantages.

In order to solve this problem, <b>non-conventional</b> <b>water</b> <b>resources,</b> like treated wastewater, drainage water and brackish water resources are gaining increasing role in the planning and development of water supplies in the irrigation of golf courses. Generally all these <b>non-conventional</b> <b>water</b> <b>resources</b> are saline. Hence, the application of excessive amounts of freshwater in saline soils and the heavy use of fertilizers are techniques used to mitigate soil salinity and to increase the salt tolerance of turfgrass in golf courses. However, the intense use of these conventional techniques has attracted public attention due to the environmental pollution and the contamination of groundwater resources. In recent years, a new environmentally safe and clean technique, whereby the salt (ion) removing species are planted in the salt-affected soils, has been introduced to mitigate the salinity problems. The salt removal potential of several turfgrass cultivars was evaluated for their efficiency to remove salts (ions) from the soils under this study. Hence, chloride concentration of leaves was the studied indicator, once that chlorides are the most representative salts in this region, due to seawater intrusion.
