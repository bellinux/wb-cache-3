Historischer Hintergrund, rechtliche Grundlagen und Akteurskonstellationen des Diskursfelds österreichische Asylpolitik werden beleuchtet und die große Bedeutung politischer AkteurInnen gezeigt. Auf Basis einer Analyse von Sitzungsprotokollen des <b>Nationalrats</b> wird der Wandel der Argumentationsstrukturen zum Phänomen Asylmissbrauch, durch die Verbindung von Asyl mit Sicherheit und der Suche nach Schuldigen, im Kontext der Politisierung von Asyl und Migration, nachgezeichnet. In Form einer Phänomenstruktur wird schließlich die Konstruktion der Dimensionen des Phänomens Asylmissbrauch (Definitionen, Ursachen, Folgen, Lösungen und Schlagwörter) festgehalten. This thesis {{analyses}} {{the construction}} of societal knowledge about the phenomenon Asylmissbrauch (abuse of asylum) in the Austrian discourse. Historical background, legal basis and the constellation of actors {{in the field are}} examined, thus revealing the importance of political actors in this area. Based on the analysis of minutes of sessions of the Austrian Parliament, the change in the structures of the argument about the phenomenon Asylmissbrauch is shown, through the connection of asylum with security and the apportionment of blame {{in the context of the}} politicization of asylum and migration.

2500|$|Vienna {{is today}} {{considered}} {{the center of}} the Social Democratic Party (SPÖ). During the period of the First Republic (1918–1934), the Vienna Social Democrats undertook many social reforms. At that time, Vienna's municipal policy was admired by Socialists throughout Europe, who therefore referred to the city as [...] "Red Vienna" [...] (Rotes Wien).

2500|$|The cantonal {{constitution}} was rewritten in 2011. Before that, the constitution dates mainly from 1876, but was revised in 1898. Under the 1876/98 constitution, the legislature (Kantonsrat) {{is composed of}} members elected by {{a portion of the}} population and holds office for four years. Originally, each member of the Kantonsrat represented 600 people or a fraction thereof over 200 people. As the population has increased while the number of members has remained fixed at about 100, this has changed. , the 13 municipalities with the smallest population each elect one member of the Kantonsrat. The other 87 seats are divided between the remaining 17 municipalities based on population. The executive (Regierungsrat) consists of seven members who are elected by a popular vote, and hold office for four years. The two members of the federal Standerat and the four (three until 2003) of the federal <b>Nationalrat</b> are also chosen by a popular vote. In the case of all laws approved by the legislature and important financial measures there is a requirement for an obligatory referendum. Two thousand citizens may claim a popular vote as to any decrees or resolutions of the legislature, and have also the right of [...] "initiative" [...] as to the revision of the cantonal constitution or as to legislative projects.|$|E
