A day later, the <b>National</b> <b>Oceanic</b> <b>and</b> Atmospheric Administration's Climate Prediction Center {{released its}} seasonal prediction for the 2007 East Pacific hurricane season, predicting a total of 11–16 named storms, 6–9 hurricanes, and 2–4 major hurricanes.

40|$|This {{reporting}} period marked {{a change in}} the funding configuration from a combination of a grant and a contract from two different National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) sections to one single contract. One year of this reporting was under the grant/kontract configuration with the changeover occurring on 1 April 2003. Much of the work duties remained the same with some exception, notably the removal of the RADARSAT Geophysical Processor System and the removal of the commercialization line item from the contract. We chose this {{reporting period}} as a transition from the previous reporting period of 1 April to 31 March, to the current reporting period of 18 November to 17 November. The Alaska Synthetic Aperture Facility s (ASF) mission has been updated to carry us forward into the future congruent with our changed relationship with NASA. ASF will continue to evolve, and NASA will remain our primary customer. To compliment our new mission, we have a new name, the Alaska Satellite Facility (ASF), deeply rooted in the University environment and focused on satellite data products, services, and science support. We have the opportunity to reshape and rebuild ASF; we will continue to honor our heritage and Serve the science community. Our long-term goals include the commitment to continued first-rate service to our user community. This report contains input from ASF as a whole on the three major components of the NASA Contract, namely tasks devoted to the Distributed Active Archive Center (DAAC), the Receiving Ground Station (RGS), <b>and</b> the <b>National</b> <b>Oceanics</b> <b>and</b> Atmospherics Administration (NOAA) ...|$|R
