It is shown that the first-order interference reduces by more than 60 % the total breakup cross sections, by less than 3 % the Coulomb breakup cross sections and by more than 85 % the <b>nuclear</b> <b>breakup</b> cross sections, for both reactions. On the other hand, the high-order interference is found to reduce by less than 9 % the total breakup cross section, less than 1 % the Coulomb breakup cross section and less than 7 % the <b>nuclear</b> <b>breakup</b> cross section for the 15 C+ 208 Pb reaction. For the 11 Be+ 208 Pb reaction however, the high-order interference reduces by less than 7 % the total breakup cross section, by less than 1 % the Coulomb breakup cross section and by less than 4 % the <b>nuclear</b> <b>breakup</b> cross section. It is finally shown that even at first-order, the incoherent sum of the <b>nuclear</b> <b>breakup</b> cross sections {{is more important than}} the incoherent sum of the Coulomb breakup cross sections for the two reactions. The role of the diagonal and off-diagonal continuum-continuum couplings on total, Coulomb and <b>nuclear</b> <b>breakup</b> cross sections is also investigated for the 8 B+ 58 Ni, 8 B+ 208 Pb and 19 C+ 208 Pb at 29. 3, 170. 3 MeV and 1273 MeV incident energies respectively. Qualitatively, we found that, the diagonal continuum-continuum couplings are responsible for the large reduction of the differential total and <b>nuclear</b> <b>breakup</b> cross sections at backward angles. At forward angles, this reduction is due to the off-diagonal continuum-continuum couplings. In the absence of these couplings, the <b>nuclear</b> <b>breakup</b> is the more dominant process, while when they are included, the Coulomb breakup becomes dominant. This shows that, the <b>nuclear</b> <b>breakup</b> is more affected by the continuum-continuum couplings than its Coulomb counterpart. Quantitatively, we found that, the off-diagonal countinuum-countinuum couplings reduce by 13. 39 %, 12. 71 % and 11. 11 % the total breakup cross sections for the 8 B+ 58 Ni, 8 B+ 208 Pb and 19 C+ 208 Pb reactions, respectively.

40|$|Charmonium {{suppression}} in hot {{and dense}} nuclear matter {{has been argued}} to be a signature {{for the production of}} the quark gluon plasma (QGP).

The p+p collisions serve as a baseline for searching for suppression compared to binary scaling predictions, allow one to quantify the amount of feed-down from higher states as well as serve as a tool to distinguish between different theoretical calculations for charmonium production mechanisms.

The influence of breakup channels on the complete fusion of weakly bound systems is investigated in comparison with the benchmark curve called the Universal Fusion Function and the derived systematic behavior of fusion cross sections of weakly bound nuclei is explained in terms of polarization potentials. The systematic enhancement of the cross section at sub-barrier energies is consistent with recent experimental observations that nucleon transfer, often leading to breakup, is dominant compared to direct breakup in this energy regime. At energies above the barrier, the repulsive polarization potential due to direct breakup predominates and complete fusion is suppressed.

The high statistics proton-proton J/psi data taken in 2005 are used to improve the baseline measurement and thus construct updated cold nuclear matter modification factors (R(dAu)). A suppression of J/psi in cold nuclear matter is observed as one goes forward in rapidity (in the deuteron-going direction), corresponding to a region more sensitive to initial-state low-x gluons in the gold nucleus.

The density distributions and the electric-multipole strength functions of those isotopes are calculated by the Hartree-Fock+BCS and the canonical-basis-time-dependent-Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov methods, respectively, using three kinds of Skyrme-type effective interaction. The <b>nuclear</b> and Coulomb <b>breakup</b> processes are respectively described with the Glauber model and the equivalent photon method in which the effect of finite-charge distribution is taken into account. The three Skyrme interactions give different results for the total reaction cross sections because of different Coulomb breakup contributions. The contribution of the low-lying $E 1 $ strength is amplified when the low-incident energy is chosen. With an appropriate choice of the incident energy and target nucleus, the total reaction cross section can be complementary to the Coulomb excitation for analysing the low-lying $E 1 $ strength of unstable nuclei.
