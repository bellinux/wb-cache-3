5|$|The {{name was}} not retired, {{although}} {{due to the}} low activity in the central Pacific Ocean, the name will <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> several years.|$|E
5|$|Ambient {{pressure}} is deducted from cylinder pressure, as {{the quantity of}} air represented by PA can in practice <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> breathing by the diver as it required to balance the ambient pressure of the water.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{widespread}} property damage and extensive death tolls the name Isabel was retired after the 2003 season, and will <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> future Atlantic hurricanes. It {{was replaced by}} Ida for the naming list for the 2009 season. The names Ina and Ivy were also suggested as possible replacement names.|$|E
25|$|In France, steam {{locomotives}} have <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> {{commercial services}} since 24 September 1975.|$|R
50|$|B-MAC has <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> DTH {{applications}} since PrimeStar {{switched to}} an all-digital delivery {{system in the}} mid-1990s.|$|R
25|$|Since 2014, it has <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> any SANFL or AFL matches. As of 2017, it {{is still}} the {{headquarters}} and training ground for the Adelaide Football Club.|$|R
5|$|Clinical {{practice}} guidelines recommend frequencies for pulmonary nodule surveillance. CT imaging should <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> {{longer or}} {{more frequently than}} indicated as extended surveillance exposes people to increased radiation.|$|E
5|$|Following the docking, Mirs {{attitude}} control system was used to spin the station, to provide spin-stabilisation {{in order to further}} conserve the fuel, as the station had descended to an altitude at which its gyroscopes could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> {{attitude control}}. The station would remain in this spin until the deorbit manoeuvres began.|$|E
5|$|Starting blocks may be {{used for}} all races up to and {{including}} 400 m (including the first leg of the 4 × 100 m and 4 × 400 m) and may <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> any other race. No part of the starting block may overlap the start line or extend into another lane.|$|E
25|$|Minister Šutanovac {{said that}} he was also {{interested}} why the planes of Jat had <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> extinguishing fires in Serbia this summer, adding that the Ministry of Defense <b>was</b> <b>not</b> the bearer of this work.|$|R
50|$|Code letters {{used the}} twenty-six flags that {{represent}} {{the letters of the}} alphabet, plus the ten flags {{that represent the}} digits 0 - 9 also have <b>been</b> <b>used.</b> The substitute flags have <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> call signs.|$|R
50|$|A new {{entrance}} building {{opened in}} Linn in 1907, {{which is still}} preserved (the old one was demolished in 1912). It has <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> more than 20 years and is in a stage of advanced decay.|$|R
5|$|Another {{difficulty}} encountered {{during the}} aircraft's introduction was {{the occurrence of}} surging and stalling with the Avon engines. The F.2, which used the Armstrong-Siddeley Sapphire engine, did not suffer from this issue. Further problems occurred; ejected cannon ammunition links {{had a tendency to}} strike and damage the underside of the fuselage, and diverting the gas emitted by the cannon during firing was another necessary modification. The original split-flap airbrakes caused adverse changes in pitch trim and were quickly replaced by a single ventral airbrake. This meant, however, that the airbrake could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> landings.|$|E
5|$|As {{the first}} Category5 landfalling {{hurricane}} in 15years, {{and due to}} its widespread impact, the name Dean was officially retired on May 13, 2008 by the World Meteorological Organization during its annual meeting in Orlando, Florida, and will <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> a future Atlantic hurricane. It was replaced by Dorian on List V of the Atlantic hurricane naming lists, which {{was used in the}} 2013 Atlantic hurricane season.|$|E
5|$|Casterman {{felt that}} the {{black-and-white}} volumes of The Adventures of Tintin were not selling as well as colour comic books, and thus that the series should be produced in colour. At the same time, Belgium was facing a paper-shortage, with Casterman wishing to cut down the volumes from 120-pages in length to 62. Hergé was initially sceptical, but ultimately agreed to their demands in February 1942. For these new editions, Casterman introduced a four-colour system, although Hergé insisted that colour should remain secondary to line, {{and that it would}} <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> shading.|$|E
50|$|As Coney Island {{became more}} {{established}} as a center of tourism and leisure, the elephant began {{to serve as a}} brothel as well.When the elephant caught fire on September 27, 1896, it had <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> several years.|$|R
25|$|Cricket matches {{were held}} at the stadium in the past. Ellis Park hosted six Test matches between 1948 and 1954, but it has <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> {{first-class}} cricket since New Wanderers Stadium opened in 1956 and <b>is</b> now <b>used</b> only <b>for</b> rugby and soccer.|$|R
25|$|It {{was still}} active during the Japanese {{occupation}} showing support {{even for the}} guerrilla underground. The concert of the Manila Symphony Orchestra was cancelled because the performers ran away from the Japanese. The Metropolitan Theater has <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> a long time.|$|R
5|$|Decompression {{models and}} {{algorithms}} developed for binary mixtures of nitrogen and oxygen can <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> gases containing {{significant amounts of}} other diluent gases without modification {{to take into account}} the different solubilities and diffusion constants of the alternative or added diluents. It is also highly desirable to test any such modifications, to make sure the schedules produced by them are acceptably safe.|$|E
5|$|Friday, however, {{saw more}} panic on the exchange. Morgan again {{approached}} the bank presidents, {{but this time}} was only able to convince them to pledge $9.7 million. In order for this money to keep the exchange open, Morgan decided the money could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> margin sales. The volume of trading on Friday was 2/3 that of Thursday. The markets again narrowly {{made it to the}} closing bell.|$|E
5|$|In May 2011, {{the stadium}} hosted the Conference National {{play-off}} final between AFC Wimbledon and Luton Town; Wimbledon gained promotion to the Football League after beating Luton in a penalty shoot-out. The stadium {{was used for}} the play-offs because the 2011 UEFA Champions League Final was due to take place at Wembley on 28 May 2011 and UEFA regulations stipulate the stadium hosting the Champions League final must <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> other matches during the previous two weeks.|$|E
50|$|Common {{sainfoin}} (Onobrychis viciifolia), fern-leaf dropwort (Filipendula vulgaris), autumn lady's-tresses (Spiranthes spiralis), chalk milkwort (Polygala calcarea) {{and fragrant}} orchid (Gymnadenia conopsea) are notable grassland species that only grow {{in areas where}} fertilisers and herbicides have <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> a long time.|$|R
50|$|A patent {{application}} was submitted in 1991 suggesting {{the use of}} W(CH3)6 {{in the manufacture of}} semiconductor devices for chemical vapor deposition of tungsten thin films; however, to date it has <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> this purpose. Rather, tungsten hexafluoride and hydrogen <b>are</b> <b>used</b> instead.|$|R
3000|$|Summarizing {{the above}} algorithms, {{we know that}} these papers have mainly used the {{auxiliary}} principle, the projection technique and iterative schemes of fixed points. However, the Wiener-Hopf equation technique which is more flexible and general than projection methods has <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> solving [...]...|$|R
5|$|In Singapore {{primary schools}} at lower levels, lessons {{relating}} to the national anthem and the singing of the national anthem are carried out {{as part of the}} civics and moral education programme. The national anthem is sung in all mainstream schools and armed forces camps at ceremonies held at the beginning and/or the end of each day, during which the national flag is also raised and lowered and the Singapore National Pledge is taken. Both the anthem and the national pledge must <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> commercial situations.|$|E
5|$|Midazolam is {{sometimes}} used in {{neonatal intensive care}} units. When used, additional caution is required in newborns; midazolam should <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> longer than 72 hours due to risks of tachyphylaxis, {{and the possibility of}} development of a benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome, as well as neurological complications. Bolus injections should be avoided due to the increased risk of cardiovascular depression, as well as neurological complications.|$|E
5|$|The United States {{had issued}} {{commemorative}} coins between 1892 and 1954, {{as a means}} for fundraising for organizations deemed worthy of federal support. A sponsoring organization would be designated in the authorizing legislation, and was permitted to buy up the issue at face value, selling it to the public at a premium, and pocketing the difference. Various problems with the issues, including mishandling of distributions and complaints that public coins should <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> private profit, resulted in firm Treasury Department opposition to such issues, and none were struck after 1954.|$|E
5|$|Whitelaw is {{the area}} which the town centre is in but is a term which has <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> many years. The {{fountain}} which is situated at the town centre {{on the corner of}} Main Street and South Circular Road is officially called the Whitelaw Fountain.|$|R
50|$|Although the {{structure}} has <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> Reformed Presbyterian services since the 1940s, {{it is still}} known as the Reformed Presbyterian Church of Vernon. Its Greek Revival style of architecture led to its inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places on 7 January 1999.|$|R
50|$|Although lead has <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> writing since antiquity, lead {{poisoning}} from pencils <b>was</b> <b>not</b> uncommon. Until {{the middle of}} the 20th century the paint <b>used</b> <b>for</b> the outer coating could contain high concentrations of lead, and this could be ingested when the pencil was sucked or chewed.|$|R
5|$|The onion eelworm (Ditylenchus dipsaci), a tiny {{parasitic}} soil-living nematode, causes swollen, distorted foliage. Young {{plants are}} killed and older ones produce soft bulbs. No cure is known and affected plants should be uprooted and burned. The site should <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> growing onions again {{for several years}} and should also be avoided for growing carrots, parsnips, and beans, which are also susceptible to the eelworm.|$|E
5|$|The {{piercing}} gun: The {{vast majority}} {{of women in the}} west have their ears pierced with a piercing gun. The safety of piercing guns, which were originally developed for tagging livestock, has been disputed. The Department of Health of Western Australia does not recommend their use for piercing body parts other than the lobes of ears, and the Association of Professional Piercers recommends that piercing guns <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> any piercing, requiring members to agree not to use piercing guns in their practice.|$|E
5|$|While {{based at}} Verdun, the Patrie was {{stranded}} on Friday, 29November 1907, at nearby Souhesmes {{due to a}} mechanical problem caused by the clothing {{of one of the}} mechanics becoming caught in the distributor drive gear. On-the-spot repairs were made but the lack of a spare magneto on board meant that the motor could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> the return flight. The decision was made not to drag the airship back to Verdun but to tether her overnight in the open at Souhesmes.|$|E
25|$|The Alpha site, however, became {{exhausted}} by 1950, and further digging led to extensive flooding, as quarrying exceeded {{the depth of}} the water table. These quarries, still flooded, offer havens for wildlife, and are among the few surviving that have <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> rubbish infill or otherwise developed.|$|R
30|$|The {{sequences}} {{of the two}} TAs with high activity towards aromatic β-amino acids (TA from Mesorhizobium sp. LUK (Kim et al. 2007), ω-TA Ml 0107 from M. loti MAFF 303099 (Kwon et al. 2010)) have, {{to the best of}} our knowledge, so far <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> in-silico screening.|$|R
40|$|AbstractOperator {{splitting}} methods <b>are</b> widely <b>used</b> <b>for</b> partial differential equations. Up until now, {{they have}} <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>used</b> <b>for</b> delay differential equations. In this paper we introduce splitting methods for delay equations in an abstract setting. We then prove {{the convergence of}} the method and discuss the results of some numerical experiments...|$|R
