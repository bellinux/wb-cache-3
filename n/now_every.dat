25|$|Indeed, {{there is}} <b>now</b> <b>every</b> {{indication}} that the late precontact Huron and their immediate antecedents developed in a distinct Huron homeland in southern Ontario along {{the north shore of}} Lake Ontario. Subsequently they moved from there to their historic territory on Georgian Bay, where they were encountered by Champlain in 1615.|$|E

25|$|Because tricolorability is {{a binary}} {{classification}} (a link is either tricolorable or not), it {{is a relatively}} weak invariant. The composition of a tricolorable knot with another knot is always tricolorable. A way to strengthen the invariant is to {{count the number of}} possible 3-colorings. In this case, the rule that at least two colors are used is relaxed and <b>now</b> <b>every</b> link has at least three 3-colorings (just color every arc the same color). In this case, a link is 3-colorable if it has more than three 3-colorings.|$|E
25|$|Making {{matters worse}} was the continual {{increase}} in ICBM numbers. Even before the systems {{were ready for}} use, the number of interceptor missiles needed to effectively deter an attack kept increasing. As the ABM systems were expensive, it appeared {{the simplest way to}} defeat them was to simply make more ICBMs and deliberately start an arms race the defender could not win. The introduction of MIRV systems dramatically upset this in the favour of the attack; missiles now carried several warheads that would be dispersed over wide areas, so <b>now</b> <b>every</b> new ICBM built would require a small fleet of ABMs to counter it. Both the US and USSR rushed to introduce new weapons with MIRV systems, and the number of warheads in the world rapidly proliferated.|$|E
25|$|Paramore then {{played a}} sold out 15-date European tour with You Me At Six, Paper Route and Now <b>Now</b> <b>Every</b> Children. Their stadium tour culminated at London's Wembley Arena, to an {{audience}} of 12,500. The band performed in 2010 in the Australian Soundwave Festival along with bands such as Faith No More, Placebo, You Me at Six, All Time Low, Jimmy Eat World and Taking Back Sunday. Shortly before the tour, lead guitarist Josh Farro announced via the band's LiveJournal that he was engaged and stayed behind to plan his wedding. Justin York, brother of Taylor York, filled in for him on the tour. The band, with Farro returned, embarked on a spring tour of the U.S. in late April. Paramore supported Green Day on selected dates of their Stadium tour, in Dublin and Paris.|$|E

25|$|When moving or copying files, Windows Explorer {{displays}} the full source and destination path, size {{and number of}} items and the transfer speed in megabytes per second (MB/s). If a conflict or error is encountered, it does not terminate the copy, move or delete operation. Rather, the file is skipped {{and the rest of}} the files processed. At the end of the operation, the errors are presented to the user with resolution options (if available). If two files have the same name, an option is available to rename the file; in previous versions of Windows, the only options were to either replace the destination file or cancel the process. The user can also choose to apply the same action to further conflicts, if any. Also, for the first time in Windows, processing of dates when moving trees is somewhat consistent. Until <b>now,</b> <b>every</b> folder and subfolder obtained all three dates new to the time of operation. This was from the own nature of the operation at the file system level, create destination folders, move files, delete origin folders. Moved folders in Vista preserve creation and modification dates. Access date gets the time of the operation.|$|E
25|$|The {{conservation}} measures undertaken in Bhutan {{to preserve and}} conserve the cranes are unique; in fact more and more crane habitat areas are being brought under the protected area concept. The Royal Society for Protection of Nature (RSPN) established in 1987, which has the mandate for conservation and nature education {{has been involved in}} monitoring the winter visitors to the Phobjika valley and other habitats such as Bomdeling Valley. According to recorded information, 141 cranes visit Bomdeling valley (Phobjika reports a count of about 400 <b>now)</b> <b>every</b> year. RSPN has a Visitor Centre at the Phobjikha Valley, which provides information on cranes and the environment of the valley. The information Centre is a very modern decagonal building, next to a stream, with high-tech equipment. There is an observatory for birdwatchers, a mini theatre with mural painting with narration. The center staff provides services such as narration, facilitation and presentation of the valley and cranes in Bhutan. The Society has also produced a documentary (1989 : On the wings of prayer and 2014: Heavenly Bird with A german TV comapny) film on the cranes visiting Bhutan every year. Further, in Phubjika the Observation Towers have been so located that they cause the least disturbance to the crane habitats. Tourists are allowed to observe the cranes through the two or three high tech “spotting telescopes’’ and spotted on the watch the behaviour of the crane as described in the RSPN pamphlet titled “Field Guide to Crane Behaviour”, from a safe distance under the strict supervision of forest officials. Farmers are also advised to replace the barbed wire fencing with wooden and stone fencing to reduce harm to the cranes. Collisions with powerlines cause mortality to many crane species and when electricity was to be provided to the valley, the power cables were laid underground to avoid any mortality. The work was taken up during summer when the birds do not use the area.|$|E
500|$|Soon afterwards, Gore {{also had}} to contend with the Lewinsky scandal, {{involving}} an affair between President Clinton and an intern, Monica Lewinsky. Gore initially defended Clinton, whom he believed to be innocent, stating, [...] "He {{is the president of the}} country! He is my friend [...] I want to ask you <b>now,</b> <b>every</b> single one of you, to join me in supporting him." [...] After Clinton was impeached, Gore continued to defend him stating, [...] "I've defined my job in exactly the same way for six years now [...] to do everything I can to help him be the best president possible." ...|$|E

500|$|The Quảng Nguyên {{chieftain}} Lưu Ký {{launched an}} unexpected attack against Yongzhou in 1075, which was repelled by the Song's Vietnamese officer Nùng Trí Hội {{in charge of}} Guihua. Shenzong then sought to cement an alliance with the [...] "Five Clans" [...] of northern Guangnan by issuing an edict which would standardize their once irregular tribute missions to visit Kaifeng <b>now</b> <b>every</b> five years. Shenzong had officials sent from the capital to supervise militiamen in naval training exercises. Shenzong then ordered that all merchants were to cease trade with the subjects of Đại Việt, a further indication of heightened hostility that prompted the Lý court under Lý Nhân Tông (r. 1072–1127) to prepare for war.|$|E
500|$|In 1962 he {{appeared}} in Wendy Toye's comedy film We Joined the Navy before teaming up again with Peter Sellers in Only Two Can Play, Sidney Gilliat's film of the novel That Uncertain Feeling by Kingsley Amis; Powell noted with pleasure [...] "the armour of his gravity pierced by polite bewilderment". She compared Le Mesurier with the well-known American straight-face comedian, John McGiver. After appearing in another Sellers film in 1962—Waltz of the Toreadors—Le Mesurier joined him in the 1963 comedy The Wrong Arm of the Law. Powell again reviewed the pair's film, commenting that [...] "I thought I knew by <b>now</b> <b>every</b> shade in the acting of John Le Mesurier (not that I could ever get tired of any of them); but there seems a new shade here". In the same year {{he appeared}} in a third Sellers film, The Pink Panther, as a defence lawyer, {{and in the second}} Tony Hancock vehicle, The Punch and Judy Man. Le Mesurier played Sandman in the latter film; Powell wrote that the role [...] "allowed a gentler and subtler character than usual". He also appeared in a series of advertisements for Homepride flour in 1964, providing the voice-over for the animated character Fred the Flourgrader; he continued as the voice until 1983.|$|E
500|$|Over ominous keys, a {{keyboard}} opening and a repeating drum loop {{in the first}} verse, Beyoncé sings about how her relationship turned sour and puts all her cards on the table, [...] "I told you how you hurt me, baby / But you don't care / Now I'm crying and deserted, baby / But you don't care / Ain't nobody tell me this is love / You're immune to all my pain / I need {{you to tell me}} this love / You don't care, well, that's OK". While singing the first and second verses, she pulls out the power in her lower register. Each time, her voice slowly builds until the commanding chorus is reached, where towards the end, she sings, [...] "la la la", in a muted saxophone line. Her voice expresses anger as she sings the chorus lines. In the second verse, Beyoncé continues the [...] "wild-eyed pleas", as stated by Guerra and sings the lines, [...] "Even since you knew your power / you made me cry / And <b>now</b> <b>every</b> time our love goes sour / you won't sympathize". Her raw vocals then punch through most powerfully at the second chorus leading up to the bridge. After the bridge, Beyoncé, this time, scats the chorus alongside a multi-octave guitar solo.|$|E

On the special live August 30, 2011, episode of Raw, {{it was announced}} that wrestlers from the Raw brand could <b>now</b> appear <b>every</b> week on SmackDown. This mirrored the proclamation made on Raw the previous day that SmackDown brand wrestlers could <b>now</b> appear <b>every</b> week on Raw. These moves made both programs full-roster [...] "supershows", effectively ending the brand extension.|$|R
500|$|After the sprint race, Coletti {{spoke of}} his {{childhood}} dream of hearing the Monegasque national anthem while standing {{on the top step}} of the Monaco podium, [...] "It feels great I mean I’ve seen all the drivers winning here since I was a kid. I’m really, really happy especially that with this win I’ve consolidated my lead in the standings." [...] He said for the season's next race at Silverstone his team need to improve his car in qualifying trim and then aim to secure victory in the feature race. Quaife-Hobbs said it felt [...] "amazing" [...] to clinch his first career podium, [...] "Today, it’s a great reward for the team and how hard they’ve worked. We are a new team. <b>Now</b> <b>every</b> new team have had a podium." [...] Quaife-Hobbs believed if he had defended from Coletti on the third lap both drivers would not have entered the Novelle Chicane and affirmed that he elected to follow Coletti with the view for a attack later in the race. Third-place finisher Evans revealed on the formation lap he struggled to get the optimum rear tyre temperature especially {{since the start of the}} race was the best time to gain track position and was aware that finishing on the podium would probably not be realistic. Nevertheless he was happy to have again finished on the Monaco podium after altering his car.|$|E
