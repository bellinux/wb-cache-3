5|$|Following the Irish War of Independence the Irish Free State {{was set up}} as an {{independent}} British Dominion covering most of the island of Ireland. After a brief civil war between the pro-Free State forces {{and members of the}} Irish Republican Army (IRA) who wanted any independent nation to cover the entire island the status of the Irish Free State was confirmed, and the IRA forced underground. The IRA had supporters in the United Kingdom, working openly as the Irish Self-Determination League (ISDL), and the Free State government shared the names of these supporters with the British authorities, who kept a close eye on them. Between February and March they provided information on individuals that they said were part of widespread plots against the Irish Free State being prepared on British soil. On 11 March 1923 the police in Britain arrested IRA sympathisers living in Britain including Art O'Brien, the head of the ISDL. Sources disagree on numbers, giving either approximately eighty or approximately 100. The arrested men were placed on special trains and sent to Liverpool, where they were transferred to Dublin via a Royal Navy destroyer. It later transpired that not only were many British citizens (Art O'Brien himself had been born in England), at least six had <b>never</b> <b>even</b> <b>been</b> to Ireland before.|$|E
25|$|In January 1912, the lynching of a {{woman and}} three men in Hamilton, county seat of Harris County, Georgia, {{attracted}} national attention from the press and widespread outrage. Dusky Crutchfield, Eugene Harrington, Burrell Hardaway and Johnie Moore had been held for questioning {{in the death of}} a white landowner, and were later shown to have been utterly innocent. They had <b>never</b> <b>even</b> <b>been</b> arrested. Coverage by local white newspapers at the time suggested the four were guilty. The Montgomery Advertiser did not report their names correctly.|$|E
500|$|Henry Winter {{writing for}} The Daily Telegraph gave a brief {{explanation}} as to why Arsenal did not perform – their striker Henry was [...] "not at the races." [...] He was full of praise of United's determination and summarised: [...] "Yet though Arsenal had dominated possession, United had offered the more impressive individuals." [...] Matt Dickinson of The Times described the victory as huge for [...] "Ferguson and his faltering squad," [...] regardless of the scoreline or indeed if Arsenal had played the better football in patches. The Guardian correspondent Kevin McCarra felt aggrieved in the manner Arsenal had ended their unbeaten run, but pointed out they were fortunate no action was taken when Cole fouled Ronaldo. He closed his piece with an illustration of how impressive Arsenal's run was: [...] "In those prior 49 games they had <b>never</b> <b>even</b> <b>been</b> behind in the closing 20 minutes." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{interior}} of the royal living space in the palace was mostly completed in 1886; the lobbies and corridors were painted in a simpler style by 1888. [...] The Moorish Hall desired by the king (and planned below the Throne Hall) was not realized {{any more than the}} so-called Knights' Bath, which, modeled after the Knights' Bath in the Wartburg, was intended to render homage to the knights' cult as a medieval baptism bath. A Bride Chamber in the Bower (after a location in Lohengrin), [...] guest rooms in the first and second floor of the [...] and a great banquet hall were further abandoned projects. In fact, a complete development of Neuschwanstein had <b>never</b> <b>even</b> <b>been</b> planned, and {{at the time of the}} king's death there was not a utilization concept for numerous rooms.|$|E
2500|$|In May 2009, {{shortly after}} being elected Premier, Zille {{wrote a letter}} to the Cape Argus {{newspaper}} that was accidentally copied by her spokesperson to the Sowetan newspaper. Responding to criticism from gender lobby groups and the ANC over her all-male provincial cabinet, Zille stated in the letter that the ANC had <b>never</b> <b>even</b> <b>been</b> led by a woman, and that its leaders set bad examples on gender issues. She cited South African President Jacob Zuma's [...] "deeply sexist views", accused him of being a [...] "womaniser", and condemned him for putting [...] "all his wives at risk of contracting HIV" [...] by having unprotected sex with an HIV positive woman. Zuma, a polygamist, admitted in his rape trial that he had known that the woman with whom he had, had sex was HIV positive.|$|E
2500|$|Although it was Green's {{cancer that}} caused The Tom Green Show to cease production, a {{frequent}} rumor {{says that the}} show was cancelled because of an alleged segment where Green shows up at a bar mitzvah, or another Jewish event, dressed as Adolf Hitler. Green, however, has repeatedly denied that such a segment exists, {{and there is no}} evidence to suggest that such an event occurred. He mentions the rumor in his 2004 autobiography, Hollywood Causes Cancer, stating that it apparently started when some Boston teenagers were caught videotaping themselves performing a similar stunt and when asked by security, they used the name [...] "Tom Green." [...] Green says, [...] "I would never do a mean-spirited, anti-Semitic joke like that – it's both abhorrent and not funny. To this day I still get asked about it, and it's annoying. So again, for the record, it didn't happen. There is nobody on this planet that has ever seen this bit on tape because it does not exist. If it did exist, it would have certainly reared its ugly, hateful head on the Internet by now. But it won't, because it doesn't exist. I've never put on a Hitler costume. In fact, I've <b>never</b> <b>even</b> <b>been</b> to a Bar Mitzvah." ...|$|E

5000|$|Assurance {{for foreign}} governments: According to President Reagan's Attorney General Edwin Meese III, [...] "it is {{extremely}} difficult for any U.S. President to negotiate significant trade deals if he cannot assure other nations that Congress will refrain from adding numerous amendments and conditions that must then be taken back to the negotiating table". The very nature of Trade Promotion Authority requires Congress {{to vote on the}} agreements before they can take effect, meaning that without TPA, [...] "those agreements might <b>never</b> <b>even</b> <b>be</b> negotiated".|$|R

2500|$|The Titans {{were the}} first NFL team to play a preseason game, in the Pro Football Hall of Fame Game on August 9, 2009. Ringer played his NFL debut there. Ringer {{discussed}} the game earlier, saying, [...] "I am very excited. I have <b>never</b> <b>even</b> <b>been</b> to an NFL game as a fan, so my first experience I {{am going to be}} playing in one, I am looking forward to it." [...] Ringer had 4 carries for 14 yards, along with 2 catches for 9 yards, while the Titans won 21-18. On August 15, in a preseason game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Ringer lead the team in rushing with 7 attempts for 51 yards, including a 36 yard touchdown run. The Titans won 27-20. Ringer said of the run, [...] " [...] I saw a linebacker prepare to blitz, and I thought the offense was going to check out of the play. But as the cadence kept going, I realized we were going to run into that blitz". In a 10-30 loss against the Dallas Cowboys, the first game in Cowboys Stadium, Ringer again led the team in rushing, this time with 33 yards on 5 attempts. He had what would have been a 17-yard touchdown run called back due to a penalty. He also had 2 catches for 6 yards, and averaged 34 yards on two kickoff return.|$|E

The thing passed away! With studious care he fixed his mind upon trifles. There was a crease in his silk hat, clearly visible as he glanced at his reflection in a plate-glass window. He turned into Scott's, and waited whilst it was ironed. Then he walked homewards and spent the remainder of the day carefully revising a bundle of proofs which he found on his table fresh from the printer.|$|R

5000|$|Authors {{who accept}} the {{existence}} of the Mollies as a violent and destructive group acknowledge a significant scholarship that questions the entire history. In The Pinkerton Story, authors James D. Horan and Howard Swiggett write sympathetically about the detective agency and its mission to bring the Mollies to justice. They observe: The difficulty of achieving strict and fair accuracy in relation to the Mollie Maguires is very great. Sensible men have held there <b>never</b> <b>even</b> <b>was</b> such an organization... We do believe, however, that members of a secret organization, bound to each other by oath, used the facilities and personnel of the organization to carry out personal vendettas...|$|R
60|$|Movements of the Leaves.--That such thick, large leaves {{as those}} of Pinguicula vulgarisshould have the power of curving inwards when excited has <b>never</b> <b>even</b> <b>been</b> suspected. It is {{necessary}} to select for experiment leaves with their glands secreting freely, and which have been prevented from capturing many insects; as old leaves, at least those growing {{in a state of}} nature, have their margins already curled so much inwards that they exhibit little power of movement, or move very slowly. I will first give in detail the more important experiments which were tried, and then make some concluding remarks.|$|E

The friend confided to her that, in the past night, she had seen her brother, dripping wet. He {{told her that he}} had been drowned by the upsetting of a boat, which was attached by a rope to a ship. At this time, {{he was on his way}} home from Australia. The dream, or vision, was recorded in writing. When next the first lady met her friend, she was entertaining her brother at luncheon. He had <b>never</b> <b>even</b> <b>been</b> in a boat dragged behind a ship, and was perfectly safe.|$|E
60|$|In {{the grand}} {{matter of the}} Paradise Birds, however, little was done. Only one {{additional}} species was found, the Seleucides alba, {{of which he had}} already obtained a specimen in Salwatty; but he learnt that the other kinds' of which he showed them drawings, were found two or three days' journey farther in the interior. When I sent my men from Dorey to Amberbaki, they heard exactly the same story--that the rarer sorts were only found several days' journey in the interior, among rugged mountains, and that the skins were prepared by savage tribes who had <b>never</b> <b>even</b> <b>been</b> seen by any of the coast people.|$|E

5000|$|The ranch was the {{fulfillment}} of a longtime dream for Amory. He explained in his 1997 book Ranch of Dreams, [...] "It was not long after reading Black Beauty {{for the first time}} that I had a dream that one day I would have a place which would embody everything Black Beauty loved about his final home. I dreamed that I would go even a step further—at my place none of the horses would ever wear a bit or blinkers or check reins, or in fact have reins at all, because they would never pull a cart, a carriage, a cab, or anything else. Indeed, they would <b>never</b> <b>even</b> <b>be</b> ridden- they would just run free." ...|$|R

60|$|Of course {{our present}} {{collections}} {{of these things}} are the merest beginnings of the accumulations we may hope for in the future, when there are searchers enough to make a thorough examination of all possible sources and when other countries in the world, now inaccessible to archæologists, have been explored in some detail. The greater part of Africa and Asia has <b>never</b> <b>even</b> <b>been</b> traversed yet by a trained observer interested in these matters and free to explore, and we must be very careful therefore not to conclude that the early true men were distinctively inhabitants of western Europe or that they first appeared in that region.|$|E
6000|$|He adds: 'I beg to {{call your}} Honours' {{attention}} to the wanton destruction of property by the Boer forces in Natal. They not only have helped themselves freely to the cattle and other property of farmers without payment, but they have utterly wrecked the contents of many farmhouses. As an instance I would specify Mr. Theodore Wood's farm [...] "Longwood" [...] near Springfield. I point out how very different is {{the conduct of the}} British troops. It is reported to me from Modder River that farms within the actual area of the British Camp have <b>never</b> <b>even</b> <b>been</b> entered, the occupants are unmolested, and their houses, gardens, and crops remain absolutely untouched.' ...|$|E
60|$|From such anecdotes she pieced {{together}} her new Ditmar. He {{spoke of a}} large world she had never seen, of New York and Washington and Chicago, where he intended to take her. In the future he would never travel alone. And he told her of his having been a delegate to the last National Republican Convention, explaining what a delegate was. He gloried in her innocence, and it was pleasant to dazzle her with impressions of his cosmopolitanism. In this, perhaps, he was not quite so successful as he imagined, but her eyes shone. She had <b>never</b> <b>even</b> <b>been</b> in a sleeping car! For her delectation he launched into an enthusiastic description of these vehicles, of palatial compartment cars, of limited, transcontinental trains, where one had a stenographer and a barber at one's disposal.|$|E
25|$|The {{evidence}} {{which was}} the Commission's duty to record, satisfied all the members and was deemed trustworthy.

50|$|The only {{sequel to}} feature {{any of the}} {{original}} crew from Bring It On was 2004's Bring It On Again, which shared the film's same producers.

6000|$|Finally, as to {{the ladies}} and gentlemen question, all I can say is, would that every woman-child born into this world were trained to be a lady, and every man-child a gentleman! But then I do not use those much-abused words by way of {{distinguishing}} people who wear fine clothes, and live in fine houses, and talk aristocratic slang, from those who go about in fustian, and live in back slums, and talk gutter slang. Some inborn plebeian blindness, in fact, prevents me from understanding what advantage the former have over the latter. I have <b>never</b> <b>even</b> <b>been</b> able to understand why pigeon-shooting at Hurlingham should be refined and polite, while a rat-killing match in Whitechapel is low; or why [...] "What a lark" [...] should be coarse, when one hears [...] "How awfully jolly" [...] drop from the most refined lips twenty times in an evening.|$|E

I replied, of course, asking whether I could not come at once. He wrote me again to tell me to wait for a day or two, until his affairs were settled. Then I heard no more. I waited. I wrote again. I waited, and wrote again. There was no reply. I found afterwards that my letters had <b>never</b> <b>even</b> <b>been</b> called for at the address where he told me to write. Then one day a stranger who was staying at Rakney told my uncle there to look at the papers. We found the story of his murder. He had been dead some time." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{learned later}} from Stewart that the White Mustang was a {{beautiful}} stallion of the wildest strain of mustang blue blood. He had roamed the long reaches between the Grand Canyon and Buckskin toward its southern slope for years; {{he had been the}} most sought-for horse by all the wranglers, and had become so shy and experienced that nothing but a glimpse was ever obtained of him. A singular fact was that he never attached any of his own species to his band, unless they were coal black. He had been known to fight and kill other stallions, but he kept out of the well-wooded and watered country frequented by other bands, and ranged the brakes of the Siwash {{as far as he could}} range. The usual method, indeed the only successful way to capture wild horses, was to build corrals round the waterholes. The wranglers lay out night after night watching. When the mustangs came to drink--which was always after dark--the gates would be closed on them. But the trick had <b>never</b> <b>even</b> <b>been</b> tried on the White Mustang, for the simple reason that he never approached one of these traps.|$|E
