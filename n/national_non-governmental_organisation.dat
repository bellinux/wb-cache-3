40|$|Coastal Bangladesh is {{experiencing}} {{the effects of}} weather and climate-related stressors. The paper reports on the ways in which members of nine occupational groups in two coastal villages in South-west Bangladesh understand and respond differentially to recent changes in local weather and weather-related events and processes. Their understanding is grounded in local experiences and varied livelihood options, which are a complex interaction between people's social and spatial locations and local weather and non-weather events and processes. Their priorities are to protect livelihoods through resilience-building actions, which address proximate causes of vulnerability (improving coastal embankments, rehabilitating and strengthening homesteads, protecting agricultural land). Government support is limited to traditional development interventions that assist some more than others and often disconnected from local people's priorities. Most adaptation actions are practical measures within the prevailing politico-legal order.

40|$|<b>National</b> <b>non-governmental</b> {{development}} <b>organisations</b> (NNGDOs) in Ghana {{are confronted}} with declining external donor funding, arising {{in part from the}} country’s promotion to a lower-middleincome status, but also more complex changes in external funding modalities.

Drawing on 62 qualitative interviews with NNGDOs leaders, donor representatives and key informants, this article presents findings on how NNGDOs in Ghana are responding to this challenge. In particular, the article focuses on resource diversification. NNGDOs mobilised five main domestic resources: a) corporate philanthropy; b) individual donations and diaspora remittances; c) volunteer support; d) earned income through commercialisation and e) government funding. We conclude that while reduced external donor funding is an immediate threat to civil society space in Ghana, social innovations in domestic resources in response to it offer limited potentials for NNGDOs financial sustainability...|$|R

40|$|This report explores {{criteria}} and indicators (C&I) for monitoring and assessing {{the sustainability of}} community managed forests (CMFs), and offers some insights into methodological tools and conceptual approaches for C&I development. The research was intended to explore the potential value of C&I to forest communities, their partners and their representative organisations to legitimise and enhance management, including strengthening of control over forest resources and facilitating the equitable distribution of {{the costs and benefits}} of forest management. The C&I for CMF tests involved six forest communities and their partners in Central Province, Cameroon, the Amazonian state of Pará, Brazil, and West Kalimantan, Indonesia. Each test was of approximately one-month duration. The core teams included an ecologist, a social scientist and a forest management specialist. Local involvement was an essential element of the research process. Facilitators enabled the active participation of community members in the critical appraisal of the C&I. After each field test, academics, policy makers, representatives of local and <b>national</b> <b>non-governmental</b> <b>organisations,</b> and representatives of other forest communities reviewed the emergent 'draft' C&I. Over 750 statements of principles, criteria, indicators and verifiers were generated by the tests. There is an evaluation of C&I testing processes and C&I for CMF development methodologies, as well as an analysis of the C&I for CMF. The comprehensive coverage of issues related to the sustainability of CMFs makes this report a valuable reference for those interested in implementing C&I for CMF, and for other users and purposes. These may include: researchers or policy makers analysing intersectoral impacts on CMFs; practitioners assessing and developing collaborative CMF initiatives; development planners and project managers evaluating or planning initiatives; and professors seeking guidance on incorporating community forestry into curricula for rural development, forestry and anthropology students...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} discourses and {{practices}} of <b>national</b> <b>Non-governmental</b> <b>Organisations</b> (NGOs) in Enugu, Eastern Nigeria, {{as they relate to}} corruption. It examines how these discourses and practices reflect hybrid normative understandings of the state and politics. My research draws on nine months of participant observation with three Nigerian national NGOs (NGOs that are founded and run by Nigerians) based in Enugu, and on interviews conducted with the NGO workers. I examine how these NGOs are involved in grey practices; practices which can be seen to have certain attributes associated with corruption, but are not understood by NGO workers as such. I argue that the relationship of these organisations to corruption is highly ambiguous by showing that these practices are undertaken not for the benefit of NGOs or their workers, but in order to better assist their clients. My research findings imply that the ?international? norms put forward by advocates of good governance of a ?proper functioning state? are central to the norms surrounding these grey practices, albeit in a translated hybrid form. This translation is significant, for whilst the concepts of local and international norms and standards are discursively important for the production of the national NGOs legitimacy, their practices and discourses are radically hybrid. In examining this hybridity I {{contribute to the development of}} a more complex understanding of the translation of norms, arguing against those who conceptualise the role of national NGOs solely as extensions of the apparatus of global governmentality. I utilise Homi Bhabha?s concept of hybridity to argue that the hybrid discourses {{and practices of}} these national NGOs are produced by radically hybrid norms of politics and modes of governmentality. These practices are not a collage of pieces that can be traced back to either ?local? or imported conceptions, rather, they are ?new?. ESR...|$|R

40|$|As {{power is}} {{increasingly}} removed from local to national and global arenas, local environmental activists struggle both to secure local redress of their grievances and {{to place their}} concerns on supra-local agendas. Yet some succeed in doing so. In order to elucidate the conditions that facilitate such successes, campaigns concerning three issues – road-building, waste incineration and airport expansion – are examined. In each, local campaigners in England have, at least briefly, achieved national attention. Local campaigns {{are most likely to}} succeed in elevating their concerns to the status of national issues where they frame those concerns as translocal issues by networking with others with similar grievances. They are most likely to do this with the assistance of non-local actors such as <b>national</b> environmental <b>non-governmental</b> <b>organisations,</b> assistance that is most likely to be provided where the issue concerns a problematic government policy, and to be sustained only so long as that issue is nationally salient and consistent with the campaign priorities of those organisations.

40|$|Background: This {{study was}} {{originally}} {{prepared for the}} African Inter-Ministerial Conference on Literacy (September 2007) {{with the objective of}} analysing the costs of successful adult literacy programmes run both by government ministries, as well as international and <b>national</b> <b>non-governmental</b> <b>organisations.</b> Objectives: This study aims to increase the evidence base available on costs by examining adult literacy programme costs in the context of operational details and budgeting processes. It was intended to add to the limited amount of data currently available, and to provide broad recommendations regarding the calculation of costs. Methodology: In addition to estimates relating to costing currently available in the published literature, details of nine successful adult literacy programmes were obtained through a combination of web-searches, documentation received from organisers in response to an open-ended e-mail questionnaire and telephone calls. These are described, together with a presentation of their cost structure and our calculation of their unit costs. Particular attention was paid to "hidden" costs in terms of central or provincial government costs, to contributions by NGOs and other partners and to in-kind contributions in examining the new empirical data. Findings: Information from this study suggests that a realistic estimate of the costs of making an adult literate would be a minimum of US$ 100, the maximum estimate currently stated in LIFE documents. Despite an up to fivefold variation in unit costs with little obvious reason for this, the large diversity in modalities, objectives and target audience of the programmes explains much of the wide range in unit costs remarked upon by other authors. Conclusions: We believe that it would be premature for any country to pre-define the appropriate costing structures, and what is an allowable range of unit costs, based on this information. Recommendations are made for what factors should be taken into account when calculating unit costs. Each country should consider making an inventory of the large scale programmes that exist or are being developed as a preliminary step to deciding {{whether or not it is}} appropriate to impose a costing framework or proposing a specific range of unit costs. However, there is a demonstrable need for more general agreement about the components that should be considered in any costing of an adult literacy programme. Significance: This study contributes to the evidence base for developing a framework for analysing and allocating the costs of non-formal adult education projects in a manner to facilitate future planning.

Methods: Qualitative data was collected through semi-structured interviews, participant observation at policy-relevant events and document collection. Data analysis was organised according to the principles of framework analysis. Results: Trafficking has been defined in the UK as a problem of organised immigration crime and the dominance of this definition has limited the extent to which health was incorporated into the <b>national</b> policy response. <b>Non-governmental</b> <b>organisations</b> (NGOs) strategically used information about the health consequences of trafficking to support their arguments for the provision of support and protection to trafficked people.

40|$|In {{common with}} most {{countries}} of South Asia {{and indeed the}} rest of the world, discussion of the concept of civil society has emerged recently in Bangladesh among academics and activists. Much of it has been generated by the international aid agencies and their good governance policy agenda of the 1990 s, and is concerned primarily with the in-creasingly high profile community of local and <b>national</b> development <b>non-governmental</b> <b>organisations</b> (NGOs) which have emerged in Bangladesh since 1971. But there are also local meanings to the term derived from the independence struggle and the con-struction of a Bangladesh state, from local traditions of urban and rural voluntarism and from the organisation of religious life. The concept of civil society in contemporary Bangladesh is therefore best understood as both a system and an idea, consisting of both old and new civil society traditions, resisting tendencies to privilege only one (external, policy-focused) definition of the term. By recognising these different under-standings, the concept of civil society can help illuminate aspects of the changing relationships between citizens and the state, the formulation and implementation of public policy, and the shifting dimensions of the institutional landscape. But {{it would be wrong to}} overestimate the contribution of civil society as currently configured in the building of democratic processes, since there is a weak state and pervasive patron-clientelism. There is little sign of the more optimistic accounts of Putnam and others concerning the relationship between civil society and democracy...|$|R
