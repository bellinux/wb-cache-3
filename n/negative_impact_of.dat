5|$|Because {{of their}} abundance, seamounts {{are one of}} the most common marine {{ecosystems}} in the world. Interactions between seamounts and underwater currents, as well as their elevated position in the water, attract plankton, corals, fish, and marine mammals alike. Their aggregational effect has been noted by the commercial fishing industry, and many seamounts support extensive fisheries. There are ongoing concerns on the <b>negative</b> <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> fishing on seamount ecosystems, and well-documented cases of stock decline, for example with the orange roughy (Hoplostethus atlanticus). 95% of ecological damage is done by bottom trawling, which scrapes whole ecosystems off seamounts.|$|E

25|$|Tourism has {{now become}} the park's major industry, with about 12million {{visitors}} each year, mainly from the UK's larger settlements, China, Japan, Spain, Germany and the US. Windermere Lake Steamers are Cumbria's most popular charging tourist attraction with about 1.35million paying customers each year, and the local economy is dependent upon tourists. The <b>negative</b> <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> tourism has been seen, however. Soil erosion, caused by walking, is now a significant problem, with millions of pounds being spent to protect overused paths. In 2006, two tourist information centres in the National Park were closed.|$|E
25|$|The {{opposition}} to Kenya's action was criticised {{by some other}} TFG officials, militia allied to the TFG, and many ordinary Somalis.

Protests reportedly {{took place in the}} towns of Dhobley, Tabto and Qoqani, areas where Kenyan troops had passed through.

Economists argued that India's financial system is relatively insulated and its banks do not have significant exposure to subprime mortgage. In an editorial, the New York Times praised the strong regulations placed on the Indian banking system by the Reserve Bank of India.|$|E

The Endowment Council of the Canadian First World War Internment Recognition Fund also released a public statement; its criticism said the <b>negative</b> <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> Canada's first national internment operations of 1914-1920 was being downplayed at the CMHR. First and Second World War internment operations were not kept as historically separate entities, while the large-scale map projected {{in one of the}} galleries neglected to show the locations of receiving stations where internees were held, in Montreal, Toronto (Stanley Barracks), Niagara Falls, Sault Ste Marie and Winnipeg.|$|E
25|$|Another {{remedy that}} Singapore courts might apply if an {{appropriate}} case arises – {{though it has}} yet to do so – is the granting of temporary validity to unconstitutional laws. When a piece of legislation is ruled as unconstitutional, a lacuna or gap in the law may ensue as the legislation is void retrospectively and prospectively. The situation is exacerbated if the legislation is one with far-reaching effects. Hence, to overcome the <b>negative</b> <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> such a lacuna, the Supreme Court of Canada has adopted the remedy of granting temporary validity to unconstitutional legislation for the minimum time necessary for the legislature to enact alternative laws.|$|E

25|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that religiosity {{can be a}} pathway to both mental health and mental disorder. For example, religiosity is positively associated with mental disorders that involve an excessive amount of self-control and negatively associated with mental disorders that involve a lack of self-control. Other studies have found indications of mental health among both the religious and the secular. For instance, Vilchinsky & Kravetz found negative correlations with psychological distress among religious and secular subgroups of Jewish students. In addition, intrinsic religiosity has been inversely related to depression in the elderly, while extrinsic religiosity has no relation or even a slight positive relation to depression. Religiosity {{has been found to}} mitigate the <b>negative</b> <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> injustice and income inequality on life satisfaction.|$|E
25|$|However, such {{intensive}} agriculture {{in such an}} arid area has had a significant <b>negative</b> <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> water supplies. Eighty-eight percent of all water taken from {{above and below the}} surface is used for agriculture. One third of aquifers are overdrafted, especially in Caborca, Guaymas and the coast near Hermosillo. There have been water disputes in the state, notablely between officials from Hermosillo and the relatively water-rich Ciudad Obregón. The overpumping has drastically lowered water tables and has increased soil salinity in many areas. In some areas, the tables have dropped by as much as one or two meters per year, making fresh water increasing unavailable and forcing the abandonment of croplands. For this reason, {{in the last quarter of}} the 20th century area under cultivation in Sonora dropped by more than 24%.|$|E

Twenty-five percent of men aged 45 to 60 {{do not have a}} personal physician, increasing their risk of death from heart disease. Men between 25 and 65 are four times more likely to die from cardiovascular disease than women, {{and are more likely to}} be diagnosed with a terminal illness because of their reluctance to see a doctor. Reasons cited for not seeing a physician include fear, denial, embarrassment, a dislike of situations out of their control and the belief that visiting a doctor is not worth the time or cost.|$|E
