5|$|East Timor {{ratified}} the Nuclear <b>Non-Proliferation</b> <b>Treaty,</b> Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention and Chemical Weapons Convention in 2003. The East Timorese Government {{has no plans}} to acquire nuclear, biological or chemical weapons. The country also became a party to the Ottawa Treaty, which bans anti-personnel mines, in 2003.|$|E
5|$|On the AEC from 1949 to 1954, Smyth argued unsuccessfully {{against a}} crash course to develop the {{hydrogen}} bomb and in favor of international control of nuclear weapons. He was the sole {{member of the commission}} to vote against stripping J. Robert Oppenheimer's security clearance. As IAEA ambassador from 1961 to 1970 he {{played an important role in}} the realization of the Nuclear <b>Non-Proliferation</b> <b>Treaty.</b>|$|E
5|$|During the Cold War, Swiss {{authorities}} {{considered the}} construction of a Swiss nuclear bomb. Leading nuclear physicists at the Federal Institute of Technology Zürich such as Paul Scherrer made this a realistic possibility. In 1988, the Paul Scherrer Institute was founded in his name to explore the therapeutic uses of neutron scattering technologies. Financial problems with the defence budget and ethical considerations prevented the substantial funds from being allocated, and the Nuclear <b>Non-Proliferation</b> <b>Treaty</b> of 1968 was seen as a valid alternative. All remaining plans for building nuclear weapons were dropped by 1988.|$|E
5000|$|Burma {{has faced}} {{persistent}} accusations of using chemical weapons; however, the NTI has stated there is [...] "no {{evidence to suggest}} that Myanmar has a chemical weapons program." [...] Burma is a member of nuclear, but not chemical or biological, <b>non-proliferation</b> <b>treaties.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Similarly, for {{the means}} of {{delivery}}, there only exists a regime so these delivery systems are not the subject of legally binding <b>non-proliferation</b> <b>treaties.</b> Resolution 1540 explicitly integrates proliferation concerns about these means.The resolution goes beyond the three main <b>non-proliferation</b> <b>treaties</b> and specifies in article 2 and 3 the additional measures required concerning financial, security, and physical protection of sensitive materials and also border and export controls.Lastly, the Resolution, adopted under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, requires enforcement. This emphasizes the role states are expected to play to pre-empt [...] (article 10), because it hints {{at the possibility of}} sanctions in case of non-compliance. It also tries to address the enforcement weakness in the treaties and export control regimes.|$|R
50|$|A further term of {{the text}} invited the Iraqi Government {{to report to the}} Council within one year on {{progress}} made in adhering to all applicable disarmament and <b>non-proliferation</b> <b>treaties</b> and related international agreements, notably the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons (Chemical Weapons Convention) and the Additional Protocol to its Safeguards Agreement.|$|R
5|$|On September 24, 1996, the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) {{was opened}} for signature. All five nuclear weapons states {{recognized}} under the Nuclear <b>Non-Proliferation</b> <b>Treaty</b> (China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States) signed the treaty, with 66 other states following that day. Fiji {{became the first}} state to ratify the treaty on October 10, 1996. Currently, 183 states have signed and 166 states have ratified the treaty. Most recently, Niue signed the treaty on April 9, 2012 and Myanmar and Swaziland ratified on September 21, 2016.|$|E
5|$|Seaborg {{enjoyed a}} close {{relationship}} with President Lyndon Johnson and influenced the administration to pursue the Nuclear <b>Non-Proliferation</b> <b>Treaty.</b> Seaborg was called to the White House {{in the first week of}} the Nixon Administration in January 1969 to advise President Richard Nixon on his first diplomatic crisis involving the Soviets and nuclear testing. He clashed with Nixon presidential adviser John Ehrlichman over the treatment of a Jewish scientist, Zalman Shapiro, whom the Nixon administration suspected of leaking nuclear secrets to Israel.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the end of}} the Cold War, India has {{increased}} its economic, strategic, and military co-operation with the United States and the European Union. In 2008, a civilian nuclear agreement was signed between India and the United States. Although India possessed nuclear weapons at the time and was not party to the Nuclear <b>Non-Proliferation</b> <b>Treaty,</b> it received waivers from the International Atomic Energy Agency and the Nuclear Suppliers Group, ending earlier restrictions on India's nuclear technology and commerce. As a consequence, India became the sixth de facto nuclear weapons state. India subsequently signed co-operation agreements involving civilian nuclear energy with Russia, France, the United Kingdom, and Canada.|$|E
50|$|Proliferation risk is {{significant}} only in countries {{which are not}} signatories of <b>non-proliferation</b> <b>treaties.</b> The principle risk of proliferation concerns theft of, or illicit trade in nuclear materials used in industry and medicine. Ultimately, proliferation risk cannot be eliminated as long as nuclear power is used, because any country with sufficient funds could readily employ known legacy technologies {{to build a nuclear}} weapon from raw uranium ore. Civilian nuclear power plants in developed countries pose no credible proliferation risk.|$|R
30|$|Stansfield [32] {{presents}} Virtual Reality (VR) applications, {{which are}} designed for nuclear safeguards and non-proliferation, with support for facility visualization, training scenarios, and security and monitoring of nuclear facilities. Stansfield et al. [33] present an early VR environment for situational training of inspectors to verify compliance with nuclear <b>non-proliferation</b> <b>treaties.</b> The system monitors {{the actions of the}} users in the VR environment and reports when a user misses to prevent a security infraction. Although VR offers functional capabilities with easily accessible technical means, AR supports to investigate collaborative behaviour in more real work scenarios such as in the security domain.|$|R
50|$|The design {{criteria}} {{specified by the}} IAEA call for a reactor monitoring tool which is compact, portable, inexpensive, safe, and remotely controllable. It {{should be possible to}} unobtrusively place such a monitoring device near a nuclear reactor, without adversely impacting the safe operation of that reactor, and remotely monitor for indications of the production of nuclear materials intended for weapons applications in violation of international <b>non-proliferation</b> <b>treaties.</b> For example, the detection of a change in the antineutrino spectrum consistent with the removal of a large quantity of 239Pu from the reactor would raise suspicions and warrant further investigation.|$|R
5|$|The 1972–73 {{debate over}} French nuclear {{testing in the}} Pacific mobilised several groups, {{including}} some trade unions. In 1972 the International Court of Justice in a case launched by Australia and New Zealand, and advocated by Dr Helen Caldicott, ordered that the French cease atmospheric nuclear testing at Mururoa atoll. In 1973 Australia's concerns {{saw it as a}} champion and an early adopter of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, and around this time, the Government ratified the Seabed Arms Control Treaty. Shortly after this, the Government negotiated with the International Atomic Energy Agency to put in safeguards to ensure Australia could mine and export nuclear material but not breach the intent of the Nuclear <b>Non-Proliferation</b> <b>Treaty.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Australian Defence Force {{seeks to}} be a {{high-technology}} force, {{and much of}} its equipment {{is scheduled to be}} replaced or upgraded in the near future. Australia does not possess {{weapons of mass destruction and}} has ratified the Biological Weapons Convention, Chemical Weapons Convention and Nuclear <b>Non-Proliferation</b> <b>Treaty.</b> Although most of the ADF's weapons are only used by single service, there is an increasing emphasis on commonality. The three services use the same small arms and the FN Herstal 35 is the ADF's standard hand gun, the F88 Austeyr the standard rifle, the F89 Minimi the standard light support weapon, the FN Herstal MAG-58 the standard light machine gun and the Browning M2HB the standard heavy machine gun.|$|E
5|$|From 1961 to 1968, Fisher {{served as}} the Deputy Director of the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency in which he took a primary {{negotiations}} role during the Atomic Test Ban Treaty of 1963 between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. At that time he was Deputy to John J. McCloy, Adviser to the President on Disarmament. In 1968, Fisher served {{as one of the}} chief U.S. negotiators of the Nuclear <b>Non-Proliferation</b> <b>Treaty,</b> which was signed by the United States, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and 59 other countries on July 1, 1968. A collection of letters from Adrian Fisher to President Johnson and Secretary of State Dean Rusk regarding his perception and activities on arms control and disarmament is maintained by the Federation of American Scientists.|$|E
5000|$|India {{also sought}} to improve {{relations}} with the United States, which had been strained due to the latter's support for Pakistan during the 1971 war and India's subsequent proximity with the Soviet Union. The Janata government announced its desire to achieve [...] "genuine" [...] non-alignment in the Cold War, which had been the long-standing national policy. In 1978, Jimmy Carter became the first U.S. president to make an official visit to India. Both nations sought to improve trade and expand cooperation in science and technology. Vajpayee represented India at the U.N. conference on nuclear disarmament, defending India's nuclear programme and its refusal to sign <b>non-proliferation</b> <b>treaties.</b>|$|R
25|$|The U.S. {{government}} has officially taken a silent policy towards {{the nuclear weapons}} ambitions {{of the state of}} Israel, while being exceedingly vocal against proliferation of such weapons in the countries of Iran and North Korea. Until 2005 when the program was cancelled, it was violating its own <b>non-proliferation</b> <b>treaties</b> in the pursuit of so-called nuclear bunker busters. The 2003 invasion of Iraq by the U.S. was done, in part, on indications that Weapons of Mass Destruction were being stockpiled (lately, stockpiles of previously undeclared nerve agent and mustard gas shells have been located in Iraq), and the Bush administration said that its policies on proliferation were responsible for the Libyan government's agreement to abandon its nuclear ambitions.|$|R
40|$|To {{reduce the}} risk of {{proliferation}} of arms, particularly weapons of mass distruction, a number of international treaties and other agreements and export control regimes have been concluded. Their purpose is to reduce or eliminate certain weapons or weapons systems, to curb the proliferation of weapons and of sensitive, dual-use technologies, or to increase security and build confidence in other ways. Some of these treaties are multilateral and intended to cover all states, some are bilateral at origin. The most important <b>non-proliferation</b> <b>treaties</b> (NPT, CWC, BWC and CTBT) are presented in detail. Also the CFE, an arms control treaty, and the Kyoto Protocol (as an example of verification to protect the environment) are presented. Most of the treaties include technical and institutional measures of verification to prevent or detect possibile violations. The legal and technical aspects of the Treaties and Agreements are compared and an attempt is made to classify the verification provisions with respect to their objectives, scope and technical means. The current world situation, with new and increased security threats, including {{proliferation of weapons of mass}} distruction, disruption of critical infrastructure, terrorism or trafficking, will require new international or multilateral instruments, e. g. on security in the supply chain (container security), to counter proliferation of explosives, small arms and man-pads, to deal with cyber-crime etc. The lessons learned from existing Treaties and Agreements can help to draft such new instruments.

5|$|NATO's 2004 Istanbul summit {{was also}} remarkably {{silent on the}} subject of nuclear weapons policy and non-proliferation, as opposed to pre-summit {{diplomacy}} and earlier post-Cold War NATO summits and contrary to the demonstrations going on in Istanbul. In June 2004, shortly before the summit, NATO issued two fact sheets on nuclear policy, portraying the developments within NATO in a favourable light in the run up to the 2005 Nuclear <b>Non-Proliferation</b> <b>Treaty</b> Review Conference. In practice, no real changes {{since the end of the}} Cold War were implemented, as since the 1994 US Nuclear posture review the number of US nuclear weapons based in Europe remained unchanged, and as Cold War nuclear sharing arrangements dating back to the 1960s remained in force. Additionally, no changes were made to Alliance nuclear policy since the 1999 Strategic Concept.|$|E

50|$|To {{allow for}} the {{verification}} of its nuclear <b>non-proliferation</b> undertaking, the <b>Treaty</b> requires parties to conclude comprehensive safeguards agreements with the IAEA equivalent to the agreements required {{in connection with the}} <b>Treaty</b> on the <b>Non-Proliferation</b> of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). Twenty-one States in Africa have yet to bring such agreements into force. The IAEA encourages them to bring these agreements into force as soon as possible.|$|R
25|$|In June 1977, U.S. First Lady Rosalynn Carter visited Brazil and {{met with}} Geisel and his foreign minister, Azeredo da Silveira, in Brasília. Mrs. Carter was {{accompanied}} by Robert Pastor, U.S. National Security Advisor for Latin America, and Joseph Nye, Assistant Secretary of State for nuclear affairs. Although Mrs. Carter and Geisel talked about <b>non-proliferation</b> and the <b>Treaty</b> of Tlateloco, no substantive agreements on nuclear policy were created during this visit.|$|R
40|$|The {{authors have}} {{developed}} several {{different types of}} tools for sampling from sealed containers. These tools allow the user to rapidly drill into a closed container, extract a sample of its contents (gas, liquid, or free-flowing powder), and permanently reseal the point of entry. This is accomplished without exposing the user or the environment to the container contents, even while drilling. The entire process is completed in less than 15 seconds for a 55 gallon drum. Almost any kind of container can be sampled (regardless of the materials) with wall thicknesses up to 1. 3 cm and internal pressures up to 8 atm. Samples can be taken from the top, sides, or bottom of a container. The sampling tools are inexpensive, small, and easy to use. They work with any battery-powered hand drill. This allows considerable safety, speed, flexibility, and maneuverability. The tools also permit the user to rapidly attach plumbing, a pressure relief valve, alarms, or other instrumentation to a container. Possible applications include drum venting, liquid transfer, container flushing, waste characterization, monitoring, sampling for archival or quality control purposes, emergency sampling by rapid response teams, counter-terrorism, <b>non-proliferation</b> and <b>treaty</b> verification, and use by law enforcement personnel during drug or environmental raids...|$|R

40|$|In this Master's Thesis I am {{examining}} the nuclear non-proliferation as a regime. Nuclear non-proliferation is mainly {{discussed in the}} framework of the <b>Treaty</b> on the <b>Non-Proliferation</b> of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). After the terrorist attacks in USA in September 2001 nuclear terrorism {{has become one of the}} major concerns in the international relations. In this thesis nuclear terrorism is studied {{in the framework of}} nuclear non-proliferation and the power structure created by the NPT. The starting point for this study is the assumption that the power structure created by the NPT affects the argumentation on the suppression of the acts of nuclear terrorism. The NPT allows only five states to acquire and possess nuclear weapons. It creates an unbalanced system of states based on the ownership of nuclear weapons. This system is studied as a regime. Nuclear terrorism is considered strictly connected to the further proliferation of nuclear materials and weapons. My assumption is that this attempt to create a convention suppressing nuclear terrorism is just a way for the nuclear weapon states to maintain and continue the non-proliferation regime and the power structure created by it. My research stands mainly somewhere between the structuralist and realist views of IR. International regime theories form the theoretical basis for this study. I am concentrating on representing two approaches of regime theories, the structuralist and the cognitivist approaches and especially the thinking of Robert Keohane and Ernst B. Haas. The non-proliferation regime is studied through Keohane’s theory of hegemonic stability and by using the central concept of knowledge from Haas’s thinking. The research method used in this Thesis is rhetoric. I chose to use new rhetoric and especially the argumentation theories of Chaïm Perelman and Stephen Toulmin. I use their theories of argumentation in analysis of the arguments of the United Nations Ad Hoc Committee on Terrorism. Argumentation is based on the states views of the Draft Convention on the Suppression of the Acts of Nuclear Terrorism. This research shows that the international power structure created by the NPT could still be found in the arguments of the Ad Hoc Committee. The NWS do not seem to be giving up their rights to be the only legitimate possessors and users of nuclear weapons. Nowadays globalized world has brought along new possibilities to proliferate nuclear weapons; even the non-state actors may acquire nuclear weapons. Five nuclear weapon states cannot maintain their power political status anymore through the traditional non-proliferation regime. They need to find new ways to legitimize and justify the limited possession of nuclear arsenals and their use. The international power system cannot be equal or efficient in trying to fight nuclear terrorism if it is based on the ownership of nuclear weapons and on the structures created by the non-proliferation regime. Recent developments seem to be turning the international system towards the situation where the powerful state is only trying to secure its own interests and maintain its power status. 1.
