40|$|Design of ExtraVehicular Activity (EVA) {{interfaces}} for International Space Station {{is important}} to successful assembly. This is highlighted by the recent rise in the estimate of time required for EVA during the assembly to 900 hours. The traditional method of evaluating EVA design is examination of mockups in <b>neutral</b> <b>buoyancy</b> <b>testing.</b> While effective, this is costly. Any tools for streamlining this process have positive cost and schedule implications for Station design. The human modelling software package Jack {{has been shown to}} be a useful tool in computer-aided design of space hardware requiring actuation in EVA. The package has been used to aid in the design of flight hardware for a Station Assembly Mission; evaluation was based on comparison of the computer simulations with neutral buoyancy simulations.

40|$|Although {{telerobotics}} and {{extravehicular activity}} (EVA) are often portrayed as competitive approaches to space operations, ongoing {{research in the}} Space Systems Laboratory (SSL) has demonstrated the utility of cooperative roles in an integrated EVA/telerobotic work site. Working in the <b>neutral</b> <b>buoyancy</b> simulation environment, <b>tests</b> were performed on interactive roles or EVA subjects and telerobots in structural assembly and satellite servicing tasks. In the most elaborate of these tests to date, EVA subjects were assisted by the SSL's Beam Assembly Teleoperator (BAT) in several servicing tasks planned for Hubble Space Telescope, using the high-fidelity crew training article in the NASA Marshall <b>Neutral</b> <b>Buoyancy</b> Simulator.

40|$|A {{free-floating}} droplet in microgravity {{is ideal}} for scientific observation since it is free of confounding factors such as wetting and nonsymmetrical heat transfer introduced by contact with surfaces. However, the technology to reliably deploy in microgravity {{has not yet been}} developed. In some recent fluid deployment experiments, droplets are either shaken off the dispenser or the dispenser is quickly retracted from the droplet. These solutions impart random residual motion to deployed droplet, which can be undesirable for certain investigations. In the present study, two new types of droplet injectors were built and tested. Testing of the droplet injectors consisted of <b>neutral</b> <b>buoyancy</b> tank <b>tests,</b> 5 -sec drop tower tests at the NASA Lewis Zero Gravity Facility, and DC- 9 tests. One type, the concentric injector, worked well in the <b>neutral</b> <b>buoyancy</b> tank but did not do well in low-gravity. However, it appeared that it makes a fine apparatus for constructing bubbles in low-gravity conditions. The other type, the T-injector, showed the most promise for future development.

40|$|The International Space Station (ISS) {{design is}} a very large and complex {{orbiting}} structure with thousands of Extravehicular Activity (EVA) worksites.

40|$|A {{detailed}} procedure is presented that enables astronauts in extravehicular activity (EVA) to efficiently assemble and repair large (i. e., greater than 10 m-diameter) segmented reflectors, {{supported by a}} truss, for space-based optical or radio-frequency science instruments. The procedure, estimated timelines, and reflector hardware performance are verified in simulated 0 -g (<b>neutral</b> <b>buoyancy)</b> assembly <b>tests</b> of a 14 m-diameter, offset-focus, reflector test article. The test article includes a near-flight-quality, 315 -member, doubly curved support truss and 7 mockup reflector panels (roughly 2 m in diameter) representing {{a portion of the}} 37 total panels needed to fully populate the reflector. Data from the tests indicate that a flight version of the design (including all reflector panels) could be assembled in less than 5 hours - less than the 6 hours normally permitted for a single EVA. This assembly rate essentially matches pre-test predictions that were based on a vast amount of historical data on EVA assembly of structures produced by NASA Langley Research Center. Furthermore, procedures and a tool for the removal and replacement of a damaged reflector panel were evaluated, and it was shown that EVA repair of this type of reflector is feasible with the use of appropriate EVA crew aids...|$|R
