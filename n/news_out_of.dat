2500|$|The first Tropaeolum {{species was}} {{imported}} into Spain by the Spanish botanist Nicolás Monardes. He published an account in 1569 entitled Joyful <b>News</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the Newe Founde Worlde {{in which he}} described, among other things, the plants and animals discovered in South America. The English herbalist John Gerard reports having received seeds of the plant from Europe in his 1597 book Herball, or Generall Historie of Plantes. Tropaeolum majus was named by the Swedish botanist Carl Linnaeus, who chose the genus name because the plant reminded him of an ancient custom: After victory in battle, the Romans erected a trophy pole (or tropaeum, from the Greek tropaion, source of English [...] "trophy") on which the vanquished foe's armour and weapons were hung. The plant's round leaves reminded Linnaeus of shields, and its flowers of blood-stained helmets.|$|E

60|$|On {{the third}} day after (September 10th), Bevern, having {{finished}} packing, took the road for Schlesien; Daun and Karl attending him; nothing left of Daun and Karl in those Saxon Countries,--except, at Stolpen, out Dresden-wards, some Reserve-Post or Rear-guard of 15,000, should we chance to hear of that again.

60|$|The <b>news</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Silesia are ominously doubtful, bad at the best. Duke Bevern, once Winterfeld was gone, had, as we observed, {{felt himself}} free to act; unchecked, but also unsupported, by {{counsel of the}} due heroism; and had acted unwisely. Made direct for Silesia, namely, where are meal-magazines and strong places. Prince Karl, they say, was also unwise; took no thought beforehand, or he might have gained marches, disputed rivers, Bober, Queiss, with Bevern, and as good as {{hindered}} him from ever getting to Silesia. So say critics, Retzow and others; perhaps looking too fixedly {{on one side of}} the question. Certain it is, Bevern marched in peace to Silesia; found it by no means the better place it had promised to be.|$|E

60|$|Wilson {{refused to}} suspect Tom; for first, Tom couldn't murder anybody--he hadn't {{character}} enough; secondly, {{if he could}} murder a person he wouldn't select his doting benefactor and nearest relative; thirdly, self-interest was in the way; for while the uncle lived, Tom was sure of a free support {{and a chance to}} get the destroyed will revived again, but with the uncle gone, that chance was gone too. It was true the will had really been revived, as was now discovered, but Tom could not have been aware of it, or he would have spoken of it, in his native talky, unsecretive way. Finally, Tom was in St. Louis when the murder was done, and got the <b>news</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the morning journals, as was shown by his telegram to his aunt. These speculations were unemphasized sensations rather than articulated thoughts, for Wilson would have laughed at the idea of seriously connecting Tom with the murder.|$|E

Here, at {{the mouth}} of the Vils River (between Inn and Iser), is the first {{considerable}} Post; garrison some 4,000; Hessians and Prince Friedrich the main part,--who have their share of valor, I dare say; but with such <b>news</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Hessen, not to speak of the prospects in this Country, are probably in poorish spirits for acting. General Browne summons them in Vilshofen, this day; and, on their negative, storms in upon them, bursts them to pieces; upon which they beat chamade. But the Croats, who are foremost, care nothing for chamade: go plundering, slaughtering; burn the poor Town; butcher [in round numbers] 3,000 of the poor Hessians; and wound General Browne himself, while he too vehemently interferes." [...] [Adelung, iv. 356, and the half-intelligible Foot-note in Ranke, iii. 220.] This was the finale of those 6,000 Hessians, and indeed their principal function, while in French pay;--and must have been, we can Judge how surprising to Prince Friedrich, and to his Papa on hearing of it! Note another point.|$|E
6000|$|But in a {{month or}} two, there comes worse <b>news</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> England; falling heavy on the heart of Prussian Majesty: news that Queen Caroline herself is dead. ["Sunday evening, 1st December (20th Nov.), 1737." [...] Ib. pp. 510-539.] Died as she had lived, with much {{constancy}} of mind, with a graceful modest courage and endurance; sinking quietly under the load of private miseries long quietly kept hidden, but now become too heavy, and for which the appointed rest was now here. Little George blubbered a good deal; fidgeted and flustered a good deal: much put about, poor foolish little soul. The dying Caroline recommended HIM to Walpole; advised his Majesty to marry again. [...] "Non, j'aurai des maitresses (No, I'll have mistresses)!" [...] sobbed his Majesty passionately. [...] "Ah, mon Dieu, cela n'empeche pas" [...] (that does not an experience of the case). There is something stoically tragic in the history of Caroline with her flighty vaporing little King: seldom had foolish husband so wise a wife. [...] "Dead!" [...] thought Friedrich Wilhelm, looking back through the whirlwinds of life, into sunny young scenes far enough away: [...] "Dead!"--Walpole continued to manage the little King; but not for long; England itself rising in objection. Jenkins's Ear, I understand, is lying in cotton; and there are mad inflammable strata in that Nation, capable of exploding at a great rate.|$|E
