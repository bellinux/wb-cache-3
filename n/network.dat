5|$|The NTA Film <b>Network</b> was {{an early}} American {{television}} <b>network</b> founded by Ely Landau in 1956. The <b>network</b> was not a full-time television <b>network</b> like CBS, NBC, or ABC. Rather, it operated on a part-time basis, broadcasting films and several first-run television programs from major Hollywood studios. Despite attracting over 100 affiliate stations and the financial support of Twentieth Century-Fox (which purchased a 50% share of NTA in November 1956) the <b>network</b> proved unprofitable, and was discontinued by 1961. The NTA Film Network's flagship station, WNTA-TV, is now WNET, one of the flagship stations of the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS).|$|E
5|$|The Paramount Television <b>Network</b> aired several programs, {{including}} the Emmy Award-winning children's series Time for Beany.

The <b>network</b> signed affiliation agreements with more than 50 television stations in 1950; despite this, most of Paramount's series were not widely viewed outside the West Coast. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC), which filed suit against Paramount for anti-trust violations, prevented the studio from acquiring additional television stations. Paramount executives eventually gave up {{on the idea of}} a television <b>network,</b> and continued to produce series for other networks. In 1995, after four decades of television production for other companies, Paramount re-entered the broadcast <b>network</b> field when the company and Chris-Craft Industries launched the United Paramount <b>Network</b> (UPN), a television <b>network</b> that operated until 2006.

5|$|The {{essence of}} <b>network</b> {{synthesis}} {{is to start}} with a required filter response and produce a <b>network</b> that delivers that response, or approximates to it within a specified boundary. This is the inverse of <b>network</b> analysis which starts with a given <b>network</b> and by applying the various electric circuit theorems predicts the response of the <b>network.</b> The term was first used with this meaning in the doctoral thesis of Yuk-Wing Lee (1930) and apparently arose out of a conversation with Vannevar Bush. The advantage of <b>network</b> synthesis over previous methods is that it provides a solution which precisely meets the design specification. This is not the case with image filters, a degree of experience is required in their design since the image filter only meets the design specification in the unrealistic case of being terminated in its own image impedance, to produce which would require the exact circuit being sought. <b>Network</b> synthesis on the other hand, takes care of the termination impedances simply by incorporating them into the <b>network</b> being designed.|$|E
