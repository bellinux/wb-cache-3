She began {{breeding}} Arabian stallions, including Skowronek (1909–1930), a Polish Arabian stud, to Welsh mares from North Wales, especially the Coed Coch stud farm, which she imported {{beginning in the early}} 1920s. Other breeders in England and North America soon followed suit, although at this time they were <b>not</b> <b>focused</b> on creating a new breed, and the cross became known as the Welara.|$|E

Both of those criticisms were repeated by Electronic Gaming Monthlys Sam Kennedy in his review.

Major figures included Rob Donn Mackay (1714–78) and Donnchadh Bàn Mac an t-Saoir (Duncan Ban MacIntyre) (1724–1812). The most significant figure in the tradition was Alasdair mac Mhaighstir Alasdair (Alasdair MacDonald) (c. 1698–1770). His interest in traditional forms {{can be seen in}} his most significant poem Clanranald's Gallery. He also mixed these traditions with influences from the Lowlands, including Thompson's Seasons, which helped inspire a new form of nature poetry in Gaelic, which was <b>not</b> <b>focused</b> on their relations to human concerns.|$|E

5|$|While the {{selection}} process is need-blind and race-blind, most of the best high schools and preparatory schools in Brazil are private and very expensive, and represent a majority of admissions in Brazilian public universities, leading to increased inequality in the country. To remedy this, Unicamp introduced in 2004 the Social Inclusion and Affirmative Action Program (PAAIS, in Portuguese Programa de Ação Afirmativa e Inclusão Social) that allows high schoolers coming from public schools to receive a bonus score in their overall vestibular score. While <b>not</b> <b>focused</b> on racial and ethnical factors, over the years, the PAAIS initiative has {{increased the number of}} admission of minorities from public high school, especially black and native-Brazilians, historically the most economical and social fragile groups in Brazil. With this program, around 30% of admissions come from public schools, and the participation of minorities increased from 10% to around 30%.|$|E

This is called Tikkun Olam ("Fixing the World"). Olam HaBa can also mean the spiritual afterlife, and there is debate concerning the eschatological order. However, Judaism is <b>not</b> <b>focused</b> on personal salvation, but on communal (between man and man) and individual (between man and God) spiritualised actions in this world.|$|E

25|$|When Carl Menger, Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk, and Wieser {{began their}} careers in science, they were <b>not</b> <b>focused</b> on {{economic}} policy issues, much {{less in the}} rejection of intervention promoted by classical liberalism. Their common vocation was to develop an economic theory on a firm basis. To do this, following the course initiated by Carl Menger, Wieser, along with his friend and brother-in-law Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk, disapproved of the policies of interventionism that the Austrian government, as all governments of the time, had adopted, arguing that only the free market could allow more efficient economic and social development.|$|E
25|$|As of 2001, {{the scholar}} of {{religion}} Olav Hammer could still note that books presenting the Theosophical doctrines were mostly apologetic in nature. Examples of such works include William Q. Judge's 1893 book Ocean of Theosophy and Robert Ellwood's 1986 book Theosophy. He noted {{that most of}} these works treated Theosophical doctrine {{as if it were a}} fixed entity and provided little or no discussion of how they have changed over the decades. Hammer also lamented that while scholarship on Theosophy was developing, it had <b>not</b> <b>focused</b> on the reformulation of Theosophy by Leadbeater and Besant or with the developing ideas of post-Theosophical writers like Steiner or Bailey.|$|E
25|$|Some critics view {{evolutionary}} psychology {{as a form}} of genetic reductionism and genetic determinism, a common critique being that {{evolutionary psychology}} does not address the complexity of individual development and experience and fails to explain the influence of genes on behavior in individual cases. Evolutionary psychologists respond that they are working within a nature-nurture interactionist framework that acknowledges that many psychological adaptations are facultative (sensitive to environmental variations during individual development). The discipline is generally <b>not</b> <b>focused</b> on proximate analyses of behavior, but rather its focus is on the study of distal/ultimate causality (the evolution of psychological adaptations). The field of behavioral genetics is focused on the study of the proximate influence of genes on behavior.|$|E

25|$|One choice {{made by the}} {{development}} team was to use an existing {{system on a chip}} (SOC) rather than creating their own as they had done on previous consoles. Koizumi said that this break from tradition was done to gain more third-party support for the console by using an SOC that developers could easily port to. Koizumi said that they were <b>not</b> <b>focused</b> on raw processing power, but were instead looking to balance the overall features of the system, including battery life and size. For this reason, they did not opt to use the more powerful hardware they could have used, instead using a middle-ground approach to achieve their vision of the Switch.|$|E
25|$|In 1916 Dr. T.M. Nair and Rao Bahadur Thygaraya Chetty {{released}} the Non-Brahmin Manifesto sowing {{the seeds for}} the Dravidian movements. During the 1920s, two movements focused mainly on regional politics began in Tamil Nadu. One was the Justice Party, which won the local legislative elections held in 1921. The Justice Party was <b>not</b> <b>focused</b> on the Indian independence movement, rather on the local issues such as affirmative action for socially backward groups. The other main movement was the anti-religious, anti-Brahimin reformist movement led by E.V. Ramasami Naicker. Further steps towards eventual self-rule were taken in 1935 when the British Government passed the All-India Federation Act of 1935. Fresh local elections were held and in Tamil Nadu the Congress party captured power defeating the Justice party. In 1938, Ramasami Naicker with C. N. Annadurai launched an agitation against the Congress ministry's decision to introduce the teaching of Hindi in schools.|$|E
25|$|Mia visits Peyton, and Peyton is {{concerned}} that Mia is <b>not</b> <b>focused</b> on her work. She suggests to Mia that she listen to a CD of songs she could possibly sing. They clash because Mia writes all of her own songs. Eventually, Peyton gives up on Mia and asks her to leave the label. Meanwhile, Peyton deals with stomach pains. She sees a doctor about it, and tells the doctor about Ellie's cancer. Her tearful face after the phone call predicts trouble ahead. Peyton later finds out {{that she does not}} have cancer, but is actually pregnant. She tells Lucas first, and Haley finds out in her own time, but Peyton seems hesitant to share her news with Brooke because she knows how much Brooke has wanted a family. Peyton eventually tells Brooke, and Brooke is happy for her. Peyton has her first ultrasound, but is upset because she thinks that Lucas is too busy to come and has forgotten. Lucas surprises her by coming, and the two get to hear their baby's heartbeat for the first time. Later, Lucas and Peyton learn that Peyton has placenta praevia and that having this baby could mean the end of Peyton's life. Lucas, afraid of losing her and raising a child that has to go through the same motherless state Peyton did, tries to guilt her into an abortion. They get past this and decide to have the baby. Lucas tells her that he wants to get married to her sooner, not because she might die beforehand, but because he loves her, and wants her to be his wife. Lucas and Peyton get married at the lake where they met. Haley is the minister. After the reception, Lucas and Peyton go home and Peyton collapses on the floor while waiting for Lucas's surprise. Lucas walks in the house and finds Peyton unconscious on the floor in a pool of blood. Peyton is rushed to the hospital by a blood-covered Lucas, who begs her not to leave him. Peyton goes through an emergency caesarean section, and falls into a coma. The caesarean section is successful and she has a daughter named Sawyer Brooke Scott. She later awakes with Lucas and Brooke by her side. Karen brings in Sawyer, and Nathan, Haley, Jamie and Julian join them. Dan visits Peyton and she, after some hesitation, allows Dan to hold Sawyer. She and Lucas then leave Tree Hill.|$|E
