5|$|Gossip, {{with his}} long, flowing beard, {{looks like one}} of the old-time monks. He has a good-shaped cranium, bald at the top, and is a little above the medium height.... He {{believes}} himself {{to be one of the}} greatest chessplayers in the world, and thinks that if everything had gone on to his liking he could have beaten all the champions at the tournament. He is a deliberate player, but every <b>now</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>he</b> takes a nip from a flask of brandy that generally stands on his table. He complained that his chair was too low, and he once attributed a defeat to that. Finally, he got a large ledger and sat upon it. He did, in fact, seem to derive some inspiration from its contents, for he played two or three excellent games afterward.|$|E
25|$|He was a {{tall and}} bulky person with a {{prominent}} stomach and invariably played with a clean shaven head without any hat or cap {{or any kind of}} head gear. He always wore very loose pants and after batting for a while or keeping wicket for sometime his shirt will be hanging out of the trousers and somebody must tuck it in, <b>now</b> <b>and</b> <b>then.</b> <b>He</b> had a rather ugly and uncouth stance at the wicket as he held his bat very low and bent his body forward so much that his head was practically in line with the top of the wickets. Those who watched him from the on side could only see his prominent hind portion of the body sticking up while the head, bat and the rest of Dilawar Hussain were hardly visible. However, he had a very sound defense and so {{it was very difficult to}} get him out. He was the most selfish batsman that I have ever seen.|$|E
500|$|Howarth said of {{starring}} on a soap opera, [...] "Every actor at {{one time}} passes through daytime. I wouldn't have said yes to the offer if I didn't want to stay a while on daytime." [...] He added, [...] "I don't crave fame. It's kind of goofy. I didn't {{want to be a}} public figure. I wanted to be an actor, not a movie star. But I love rock 'n' roll-there, I'd rather be a rock star. That would be cool." [...] He said that [...] "like all soap actors," [...] he sticks with the script the majority of the time, [...] "but every <b>now</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>he</b> goes off the page," [...] commenting, [...] "You get to direct yourself. You come up with a little bit. It's improvisational. Maybe you're doing it just for your castmates, but the audience catches on." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The Judge indulges in {{a little}} relentlessness <b>now</b> <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> himself. <b>He</b> is not {{precisely}} what might be termed a mild man, if what we hear is correct." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{only that}} idiot Louis, sir," [...] he said. [...] "It's a habit he has. You'll hear him laugh to himself <b>now</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> when <b>he's</b> at the helm." ...|$|R
60|$|When his thirst was in {{a measure}} quenched, Mr. Stevens lay quietly on the sand, save <b>now</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> as <b>he</b> moaned in {{unconscious}} agony, heeding not the boy's pleading words.|$|R
2500|$|I was {{returning}} {{from high school}} one day and a runaway horse with a bridle on sped past {{a group of us}} into a farmer's yard looking for a drink of water. The horse was perspiring heavily. And the farmer didn't recognize it so we cornered it. I hopped on the horse's back. Since it had a bridle on, I took hold of the tick rein and said, [...] "Giddy-up." [...] Headed for the highway, I knew the horse would turn in the right direction. I didn't know what the right direction was. And the horse trotted and galloped along. <b>Now</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>he</b> would forget he was on the highway and start into a field. So I would pull on him a bit and call his attention to the fact the highway was where he was supposed to be. And finally, about four miles from where I had boarded him, he turned into a farm yard and the farmer said, [...] "So that's how that critter came back. Where did you find him?" [...] I said, [...] "About four miles from here." [...] "How did you know you should come here?" [...] I said, [...] "I didn't know. The horse knew. All I did was keep his attention on the road." ...|$|E
60|$|Every <b>now</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>he</b> laughed, {{sometimes}} with amusement and {{sometimes with}} indignation.|$|E
60|$|Aynsley was restless, but {{she thought}} rather less so than usual, and <b>now</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>he</b> spoke feebly but sensibly.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now thou speakest of him," [...] quoth Robin Hood, [...] "methinks I {{myself have}} seen him <b>now</b> <b>and</b> <b>then.</b> Hath <b>he</b> not a mill over beyond Nottingham Town, nigh to the Salisbury road?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Only tip him a nod every <b>now</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> when <b>he</b> looks off his paper," [...] said Wemmick, [...] "and he'll be {{as happy}} as a king. We are all attention, Aged One." ...|$|R
6000|$|Alton laughed softly, as <b>he</b> did <b>now</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> when <b>he</b> {{might have}} been disconcerted. [...] "I can't beat a Cayuse, Charley, and I don't think you'll hear them very long," [...] he said.|$|R
60|$|Hans did not answer, but rode on steadily, {{though every}} <b>now</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>he</b> cast a glance over his shoulder.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Jarvis made a slow retreat {{towards the}} door. Every <b>now</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>he</b> {{turned and looked}} back over his shoulder.|$|E
60|$|He lit {{the dining-room}} lamp, got out a cigar, and began pacing the room, ejaculating. <b>Now</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>he</b> would argue with himself.|$|E
60|$|The man {{was evidently}} not a {{confirmed}} law-breaker, but merely {{one of the}} small farmers who were willing to pick up a few dollars by assisting the whisky-runners <b>now</b> <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> <b>and</b> <b>he</b> abandoned all resistance.|$|R
60|$|It {{was some}} time before the company could recover from the silence into {{which they had been}} thrown. The very {{footsteps}} of the stranger, which were heard <b>now</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> as <b>he</b> traversed his chamber, inspired awe.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, Jack, of course,--dear old cousin Jack. Nobody else ever {{thinks of}} me, or cares whether I {{have a bit}} of {{pleasure}} <b>now</b> <b>and</b> <b>then.</b> Isn't <b>he</b> kind? Mayn't I go? and, O Pris, what shall I wear?" ...|$|R
60|$|Barrington {{was walking}} up and down the room, his hands in his pockets, his eyes fixed upon his wife. Every <b>now</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>he</b> glanced nervously towards her.|$|E
60|$|All Jackson's impositions, {{according}} to him, were given him for doing practically nothing. <b>Now</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>he</b> got them for doing literally nothing--when {{he ought to}} have been doing form-work.|$|E
60|$|Every <b>now</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>he</b> {{threw her}} a delicious cooky {{warm from the}} oven. She liked the queer fellow, and {{presently}} began to talk, being very curious about this country.|$|E
6000|$|Jake laughed. [...] "You hate posers. You feel you'd like Jim to play {{a romantic}} part, without his meaning it? Well, I expect he'll miss his cues and let you down <b>now</b> <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> but <b>he</b> {{certainly}} won't pose." ...|$|R
50|$|Dajiang {{is still}} in university. He changes girlfriends {{constantly}} just like changing his clothes every <b>now</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> as <b>he</b> prefers something fresh and new. He always like to try out new things and yearn for changes but he harbours no great ambition.|$|R
60|$|The {{journey to}} Fairview took three days, the boys pushing along {{as rapidly as}} {{circumstances}} would permit. The companionship of the lads appeared to brighten Pierre Dunrot's mind wonderfully, {{and it was only}} <b>now</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> that <b>he</b> relapsed into his former simpleness.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I'm not {{his only}} ideal," [...] March protested. [...] "He adores Kenby too, and every <b>now</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>he</b> {{brings me to}} book with a text from Kenby's gospel." ...|$|E
60|$|Every <b>now</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>he</b> {{stopped and}} asked questions, and Joan replied. The {{nature of the}} Church Militant was explained, and once more Joan was asked to submit herself to it.|$|E
6000|$|... "No;--he never talks much. Every <b>now</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>he</b> {{will give}} me a downright lecture, or he will write me a letter like that; but he never talks to any of us." ...|$|E
60|$|After that Peter's {{life was}} a very happy one. He sowed and {{ploughed}} all day, except <b>now</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> when <b>he</b> took his dogs and went to hunt. And whatever game he brought back the maiden with the golden hair knew how to dress it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I {{suppose he}} has to relax a bit every <b>now</b> <b>and</b> <b>then.</b> Anyway, <b>he</b> was there, {{swinging}} a dashed efficient shoe. I hadn't meant to go at first, but I turned up for a lark. Oh, Bertie, think what I might have missed!" ...|$|R
60|$|Shortly afterwards, Dick {{went down}} {{the bank of the}} gutter and began to wade across. The water did not come much above his ankles; but it was moving; slowly yet, {{although}} it would soon run fast. He got across and saw Jim's punt on the muddy sand. The fog was low and drifted about in belts, clearing <b>now</b> <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> <b>and</b> when <b>he</b> stopped by the punt the moon shone through.|$|R
60|$|Riley {{was very}} ill indeed, but {{the flame of}} his life burnt unsteadily. <b>Now</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>he</b> would be cheerful and {{confident}} about the future, sketching plans for going Home and seeing his mother.|$|E
60|$|When he did speak, {{he seemed}} to be {{speaking}} to himself. Every <b>now</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>he</b> would murmur a few words, sometimes a single name. In spite of himself, Mr Bickersdyke found himself listening.|$|E
6000|$|... "Sometimes," [...] said Richard. [...] "It {{is just as}} it happens. <b>Now</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>he</b> goes on {{just like}} himself, and then at other times he will not speak {{for three or four}} miles." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He's too venturesome <b>now</b> <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> but <b>he</b> {{has been}} a little spoiled. I've an idea that this affair is likely to be permanent. He has shown a keen {{interest}} in the price of land and the finances of farming, which struck me as having its meaning." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, yes, I poke him up <b>now</b> <b>and</b> <b>then,</b> but <b>he</b> gets peppery, so I let him alone. May be he is {{longing for}} his old circus again. Shouldn't blame him much if he was; it isn't very lively here, and he's used to excitement, you know." ...|$|R
5|$|Sal Valentino {{revisited}} {{the song}} on his 2008 solo album, Every <b>Now</b> <b>and</b> <b>Then,</b> on which <b>he</b> offers a darker {{interpretation of the}} track.|$|R
