Vladimir Sagerlund, heraldic artist at the National Archives since 1994, was critical of the decision, saying, [...] "once upon a time coats of arms containing lions without genitalia were given to those who betrayed the Crown." [...] The Times in London noted a recent trend toward heraldic [...] "castration", pointing to the lions passant on the royal coat of arms of England, as well as the lions rampant on those of Norway, Finland, Belgium, Luxembourg and Scotland, all of which have been depicted without genitals; in conclusion, The Times wrote, [...] "some crests are ambiguous, but the message remains clear: the lions are supposed to display courage and nothing else." [...] Officials at the National Archives treat this as a change in artistic style, rather than a heraldic change, and the lion remains in its original form on the rolls of the National Archives, while the castrated lion appears on the unit's sleeve patches. The Nordic Battle Group's coat of arms was originally designed to incorporate heraldic elements and colours from all member nations, including [...] "a lion that did not look Finnish, Norwegian, Estonian or Swedish." [...] In an unusual move, the Armed Forces Heraldry Council authorised the Nordic Battle Group commander's use of a command sign. This consisted of a bunting divided into fields of blue, gold and blue with a Roman numeral V in the gold field, since the unit would be the fifth mobilized combat unit of the European Union.|$|E

5000|$|Sweden and Finland {{announced}} {{the creation of}} a joint <b>Nordic</b> <b>Battlegroup.</b> To make up the required 1500 number, they also urged Norway to contribute in the Battlegroup despite the country not being part of the EU.

According to Swedish newspapers the price for the 6 months in 2008 was 1.2 billion Swedish kronor (app. 150,000,000 euros) and the Battlegroup was not used.|$|E

According to the National Auditor, Jan Landahl, the <b>Nordic</b> <b>Battlegroup</b> also suffered from inadequate control over expenditures and reporting from the Government to the Riksdag was also unsatisfactory. The audit office's report found that twice as many Swedish soldiers {{were assigned to the}} Battlegroup compared to what the 2004 mandate had assigned, and the costs to the State was in the multiples of what the Riksdag had been told.|$|E

Norway has negotiated an opt-in to participate, even though it is not an EU member state. Sweden, Finland and Norway have planned to form a joint battlegroup.|$|E

40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis in European studies {{examines the}} perceived effects of Europeanization among officers, soldiers and seamen in the Swedish Armed Forces (SAF) {{through the use}} of semi-structured respondent interviews. The study focuses on change in rules, values, identity and organizational changes. The study shows the most important parts of what {{is believed to be the}} biggest factors behind the major change in the SAF during the last 20 years. The biggest factors are shown to be the fall of the Warsaw pact and the increasing influence of NATO in Europe. Interviews show that staff within the SAF has difficulties separating change coming from the EU and the above-mentioned factors, partially due to the fact that most members of the European union are also part of NATO. Although in some areas, such as the completion of the <b>Nordic</b> <b>Battlegroup,</b> EU has played an important role and presents itself as a major factor in the ongoing change of the SAF...|$|E
40|$|This degree {{project is}} an {{investigation}} of solar cells {{and their ability to}} deliver electric power as well as reducing the need for cooling. The main object of interest is a BASE-X shelter. The shelter is purchased by the Swedish Defence Materiel Administration, FMV to be used for command and camp in the new force called <b>Nordic</b> <b>Battlegroup,</b> NBG. The demand on the equipment is firstly that it should have a small weight to be easy to transport and handle and secondly to be easy to bring up fast. Therefore the choice of solar cell technology fell on thin film cells. The electric power from the solar cells will not be enough to support the existing equipment, but the power is sufficiently large to support emergency light and some small electric loads as e. g. fans and refrigerators that are suited to be used with 12 or 24 volts systems. If the solar cells are arranged to function as a solar protection roof the temperature inside the shelter would decrease about 10 degrees Celsius when the solar irradiance is at its peak value...|$|E
