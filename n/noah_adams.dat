However, this led to doubt among critics who did not feel it was possible to have a sensible storyline that retained the services of Kim Delaney in the role of Simone's wife Detective Diane Russell. A humorous piece in Newsweek described the general consensus as [...] "He's gonna die. He looks like he's dying...If he dies, it's easy to keep his wife (played by Kim Delaney) on the show." [...] In addition, his castmates noted that their characters would grieve. However, some sources, such as National Public Radio's <b>Noah</b> <b>Adams</b> and Robert Siegel, read into the fact that [...] "Network publicity speaks of Simone's departure, not his demise..." ...|$|E

2500|$|Abraham's {{narrative}} in the Quran indirectly refers to {{his role as}} one of the great patriarchs. The Qur'an says that God made Abraham [...] "an Imam to the Nations.", Father of Muslims, and his narrative records him praying for his offspring. The Quran further states that Abraham's descendants were given [...] "the Book and Wisdom,", and this fact is reinforced in a verse which states that Abraham's family was one of those in which the gift of prophecy was established as a generic trait. The Quran emphasizes upon Abraham's significance as it states that Abraham's family, <b>Noah,</b> <b>Adam</b> and the family of Amram were the four selected by God above all the worlds. As a result of his significance as a patriarch, Abraham is sometimes given the misleading title Father of the Prophets, which contradicts the teachings of the Quran, which establishes that many prophets, such as Noah, lived before Abraham. Of Abraham's immediate sons, the Quran repeatedly establishes the gifts God bestowed upon them. Ishmael, along with Elisha and Dhul-Kifl (possibly Ezekiel), is regarded as being [...] "of the Company of the Good." [...] and one of the men who was given [...] "favour above the nations." [...] In addition, Ishmael is described as being [...] "true to what he promised, and he was a messenger (and) a prophet." [...] Likewise, the Quran says of Isaac that he was [...] "of the company of the Elect and the Good." [...] and was a [...] "a prophet,- one of the Righteous." [...] and further describes him as [...] "of Power and Vision." ...|$|R
