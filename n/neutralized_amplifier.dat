40|$|The {{rapid growth}} of mobile data and the u se of smart phones are making {{unprecedented}} challe nges for wireless service providers to overcomea g lobal bandwidth shortage. Millimeter-wave (mm-Wave) technology is widely considered {{as one of the}} ke y technologies that will continue to serve the con sumer demand for increased wireless data capacity. ¨Meanwhile, the advanced CMOS can now well operate ¨in mm-Wave bands, permitting the integration of a ¨full transceiver in a low-cost, high-yield techno logy. However, the design of a mm-Wave¨ transceiver in advanced CMOS still poses many chal lenges at device, circuit and architecture levels. ¨In addition to generic difficulties, such as high -frequency operation and low active gain, mm-Wave¨ designers must deal with issues like low breakdown¨voltage, high interconnect loss, unwanted mutual¨ coupling, poor device matching, inaccurate PDK hig h-frequency models, strict design rules, long EM-s imulation time, etc. At transmitter side, all thes e critical issues limit the output power and effic iency, prolong the design time and make it difficu lt to guarantee the success of tape-out. This doctoral work focuses on realizing compact¨ CMOS mm-Wave transmitters (TXs) and power amplifie rs (PAs) towards more output power, higher efficie ncy and broader bandwidth. To address design chall enges at mm-Wave, novel design techniques have bee n proposed in this thesis, such as optimal transis tor layout, enhanced amplifier stage and broadband ¨power combiner. Design methodologies will be pres ented to deal with the long EM-simulation time and ¨strict design rules. In addition, detailed design ¨issues, such ascommon-mode stability and magnetic ¨mutual coupling, will also be covered in the thes is. All the proposed design techniques will be app lied to five prior-art designs that are implemente d and measured {{in the context of this}} doctoral wor k. These designs include (1) a 60 -GHz outphasing T X which is the first application and implementatio n of outphasing techniqueat mm-Wave; (2) a 60 -GHz¨ dual-mode Class AB PA which is the first dual-mode ¨PA presented at 60 GHz and achieves a recorded PAE of 30 %; (3) an E-band direct-conversion TX that ¨shows measured 4. 5 -Gb/s 64 -QAM and 14 -Gb/s 16 -QAM; (4) a broadband 4 -way E-band PA which is the fir st reported silicon-based PA achieving uniform gai n, output power and PAE across complete E-band and ¨(5) a 4 -way E-band PA based on neutralized bootst rappedamplifier topology that shows highest report ed power gain per stage.

40|$|A mm-wave digital {{transmitter}} {{based on}} a 60 GHz all-digital phase-locked loop (ADPLL) with wideband frequency modulation (FM) for FMCW radar applications is proposed. The fractional-N ADPLL employs a high-resolution 60 GHz digitally controlled oscillator (DCO) and is capable of multi-rate two-point FM. It achieves a measured rms jitter of 590. 2 fs, while the loop settles within 3 ?s. The measured reference spur is only – 74 dBc, the fractional spurs are below – 62 dBc, with no other significant spurs. A closed-loop DCO gain linearization scheme realizes a GHz-level triangular chirp across multiple DCO tuning banks with a measured frequency error (i. e., nonlinearity) in the FMCW ramp of only 117 kHzrms for a 62 GHz carrier with 1. 22 GHz bandwidth. The synthesizer is transformer-coupled to a 3 -stage <b>neutralized</b> power <b>amplifier</b> (PA) that delivers + 5 dBm to a 50 ? load. Implemented in 65 nm CMOS, the transmitter prototype (including PA) consumes 89 mW from a 1. 2 V supply.
