40|$|With the {{conventional}} POS <b>payment</b> <b>transaction</b> method, vendors {{are bound to}} a payment institute in their region and can only use relatively expensive dedicated or slow dial-up lines to their financial institute. This paper report covers the work to produce an architecture and a prototype that supports Point of Sales terminal payments over the Internet through web services. With the use of web services for <b>payment</b> <b>transactions,</b> vendors will get more freedom to choosing their provider and the services they take without having to throw away their legacy applications. Given the globalization of the economy, vendors can negotiate about services and fees with payment providers all over the world. Literature research and the prototype tests and evaluation in this project shows that transactions fees and performance of POS terminal <b>payments</b> <b>transactions</b> trough web services can be competitive to conventional <b>payment</b> <b>transactions</b> methods and create flexibility for vendors POS terminal application. Vendor’s available Internet connections and the web services standards in the market {{can be used for}} <b>payment</b> <b>transactions.</b> With web services the system can be created and changed relatively fast and simple if the right skills are available...|$|R
40|$|Smart {{cards are}} {{replacing}} traditional magnetic cards for <b>payment</b> <b>transactions.</b> One {{of the main}} reasons is enhanced security capabilities that can be built in a smart card. With the high popularity of web technology, there is a trend towards smart cards being used as an electronic wallet for <b>payment</b> <b>transactions</b> on Internet. Most of the related work of smart card <b>payment</b> <b>transactions</b> concentrates only on the security aspects of hardware/firmware, encryption method and key management, or they only propose the online shopping protocol for uni-directional <b>payment</b> <b>transaction</b> based on the scenery of exact payment from the customer to merchant during business activity. We developed a prototype system called “SmartFlow ” to demonstrate these kinds of business activities on Internet by smart card. The main focus {{of this paper is to}} present the framework of “SmartFlow ” and some important security and privacy issues for bi-directional <b>payment</b> <b>transaction</b> with change among more than two parties involved business activity. Further, we present the application of downloading software license key from Internet into smart card in SmartFlow environment. We have already implemented a prototype “SmartFlow ” system with these functionalities...|$|R

40|$|Performing <b>payment</b> <b>transactions</b> {{over the}} Internet is {{becoming}} increasingly important. Whenever one interacts with others, he or she faces the problem of uncertainty because in interacting with others, one makes him or herself vulnerable, i. e. one can be betrayed. Thus, perceived risk and confidence are of fundamental importance in electronic <b>payment</b> <b>transactions.</b> A higher risk leads to greater hesitance about entering into a business relationship {{with a high degree}} of uncertainty; and therefore, to an increased need for confidence. This paper has two objectives. First, it aims to introduce and test a theoretical model that predicts consumer and merchant acceptance of the Internet payment solution by explaining the complex set of relationships among the key factors influencing confidence in electronic <b>payment</b> <b>transactions.</b> Second, the paper attempts to shed light on the complex interrelationship among confidence, control and perceived risk. An empirical study was conducted to test the proposed model using data from consumers and merchants in Slovenia. The results show how perceived risk dimensions and post-transaction control influence consumer’s and merchant’s confidence in electronic <b>payment</b> <b>transactions,</b> and the impact of confidence on the adoption of mass-market on-line payment solutions...|$|R
40|$|International audienceNowadays, NFC {{technology}} {{is used in}} contactless payment applications by offering the NFC payment functionality in credit/debit cards, smartphones and payment terminals. Thus, an NFC <b>payment</b> <b>transaction</b> is executed in a simple and practical way. EMV is the security protocol for both contact and contactless payment systems. However, during an EMV <b>payment</b> <b>transaction,</b> this standard does not ensure two main security constraints between a customer payment device and a payment terminal: (1) mutual authentication, (2) confidentiality of sensitive banking data exchanged. These weaknesses represent a major risk {{in the case of}} NFC <b>payment</b> because the <b>transaction</b> is performed using NFC radio waves in an open environment. The risk is reduced in the case of contact <b>payment</b> because the <b>transaction</b> is executed in a closed environment by inserting the card into the terminal. In this paper, we propose a new security protocol for NFC <b>payment</b> <b>transactions</b> based on a Cloud infrastructure. We verify the correctness of this proposal using Scyther tool that provides formal proofs for security protocols...|$|R

40|$|V magistrskem delu sta predstavljena plačilni promet ter projekt SEPA v Evropi in Sloveniji. Opisane so celovite informacijske rešitve (ERP) in predstavljeno je razvojno okolje Microsoft Dynamics NAV 2013. Kot glavni cilj magistrskega dela je bila izdelana programska rešitev za plačilni promet v Microsoft Dynamics NAV 2013. Rešitev omogoča plačevanje ter izvoz in uvoz plačil, ki jih uporabljajo banke v Sloveniji in Evropi. Na osnovi testiranja izdelanega plačilnega modula je bila potrjena hipoteza, da Microsoft Dynamics NAV 2013 s privzetimi moduli ni primeren za izvajanje plačilnega prometa v Sloveniji, in zavrnjena hipoteza, da izdelana rešitev v Microsoft Dynamics NAV 2013, narejena za Slovenijo, ni primerna za izvajanje plačilnega prometa v drugih državah Evrope. Predstavljeni so rezultati SWOT-analize plačilnega prometa v starejši različici Microsoft Dynamics NAV 5. 00 in v različici Microsoft Dynamics NAV 2013, iz katerih je razvidno, da je plačilni promet v novi različici veliko bolj konkurenčen in cenovno bolj ugoden od prejšnje različice. V zaključku dela so opisani pogoji za njegovo uvedbo in možnosti za nadaljnje delo. This Master’s thesis {{presents}} <b>payment</b> <b>transactions,</b> the SEPA project, and {{the implementation}} of SEPA in Slovenia. It includes descriptions of complete information solutions (ERP) and the Microsoft Dynamics NAV 2013 development system. The main goal of the thesis {{is to develop a}} software solution for executing <b>payment</b> <b>transactions</b> in Microsoft Dynamics NAV 2013. Such a solution enables payments, as well as the export and import of payments used by banks in Slovenia and Europe. The testing of the produced payment module confirmed the hypothesis claiming that Microsoft Dynamics NAV 2013 with its default modules is not suitable for executing <b>payment</b> <b>transactions</b> in Slovenia, and rejected the hypothesis that the solution produced in Microsoft Dynamics NAV 2013, which is to be used in Slovenia, is not suitable for executing <b>payment</b> <b>transactions</b> in other European countries. The results of the SWOT analysis of <b>payment</b> <b>transactions</b> in the older version of Microsoft Dynamics NAV 5. 00 are presented along with the results in the Microsoft Dynamics NAV 2013 versionthese demonstrate that <b>payment</b> <b>transactions</b> conducted in the new version are far more competitive and cost-efficient than the ones in the previous version.
