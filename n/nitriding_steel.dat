40|$|A {{study of}} the {{response}} of the <b>nitriding</b> <b>steel,</b> 34 CrAlNi 7, to two different nitriding techniques revealed remarkable differences. The techniques used were pulsed plasma nitriding and plasma immersion ion implantation over a range of temperatures from 300 to 500 degrees celsius. The surface produced by the pulsed plasma nitriding consisted of a nitride layer whose thickness varied with temperature, with an underlying diffusion zone. Plasma immersion ion implantation treatment, however, formed nitrides only at the lowest temperature, with most of the nitrogen in solid solution. Although quite different surface structures resulted from the two treatments, similar improvements in wear performance were obtained...|$|E

The sample was treated for 18 ks at 823 K in 25 % N 2 + 75 % H 2. The gas pressure was changed to 100, 600, and 1200 Pa. The distance between the screen and the sample was also changed to 10, 30, and 50 mm. The nitrided samples were characterized by observing their surface morphology and cross sectional microstructure by scanning electron microscopy, X ray diffraction, and microhardness testing. After nitriding, polygonal particles with a normal distribution were observed at the center and edges of all nitrided sample surfaces. The particles on the sample surface became finer with an increase in the gas pressure. A nitrided layer with a greater and homogeneous thickness was obtained at a low gas pressure of 100 Pa...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} a {{substrate}} bias and prenitride plasma etching on the nitriding response of four steel substrates is investigated in a two factor two level full factorial experimental design. The steels investigated were P 20 (M 200, plastic mould steel), H 13 (W 302, {{hot work tool steel}} - as received), 4140 (preheat treated <b>nitriding</b> <b>steel)</b> and 1020 (CS 1020, bright mild steel). The nitriding response was determined from surface and cross-sectional hardness measurements. Nitrogen depth profile measurements were obtained using glow discharge optical emission spectroscopy. Considering the main effects, the results show that without a worktable bias during the nitriding step there is effectively little or no nitriding response in most of the materials. The prenitride plasma etch did not produce a significant surface hardness response in all steels except H 13, where a prior etch substantially increased surface hardness and influenced the hardness depth profile. The bias also significantly increased the nitrogen wt-%. The plasma etch also influenced the near surface nitrogen wt-% concentrations, however the practical implications of this require further investigation...|$|E

The specimens were tested at wear testing temperatures of 25 °C and 500 °C under a normal load of 15 N at a sliding speed of 1 m/s. The increase in the wear temperature from 25 °C to 500 °C led to {{a decrease in the}} wear rate and coefficient of friction of the <b>nitrided</b> <b>steel</b> samples. At 25 °C, the wear resistance of the <b>nitrided</b> <b>steel</b> improved by 2. 3 times compared to the untreated specimen. There was about 57 times improvement in wear resistance as the wear temperature increased to 500 o C for the nitrided specimen.

For C 45, 31 CrMo V 9 and X 38 CrMo V 5 - 1 the time and pressure dependency of the surface layer formation can be described by #sq root#(t) and #sq root#(p) laws, respectively. Nitriding acceleration with pressure increase is due to the increase of the nitriding coefficient. The hardness-depth characteristics within the layers can be adjusted by controlled choice of process cycles. Passive layers at the material surfaces may inhibit the nitriding process.

40|$|The paper {{considers}} {{problems on}} regulation of phase composition of a nitrided layer during gas and ion nitriding {{process in a}} glow-discharge. It has been established that  available models for control of nitrided layer structure {{with the help of}} nitriding index (nitrogen potential) can not be applied for nitriding process in the glow-discharge. Principal difference of the ion nitriding from the gas one is in the fact that chemically active nitrogen is formed in the discharge zone (cathode layer) and its mass-transfer is carried out {{in the form of an}} active particle flow (ions, atoms, molecules) which directed to the metal surface. Interrelation of chemical discharge activity with such characteristics of <b>nitriding</b> <b>steel</b> as nitrogen solubility in  α-solid solution and  coefficient diffusion during ion nitriding in low-discharge plasma. It has been shown that regulation of the nitride layer structure during ion nitriding is reached due to changes in nitrogen flow density in plasma. While supporting the flow at the level of nitrogen solubility in  one phase or another (α, γ′)   it is possible to obtain the nitrided layer consisting only of α-solid solution or γ′-nitride layer and diffusion sub-layer. Moreover a specific range of nitrogen flow density values exists for every steel grade where it is possible to ensure a limiting nitrogen concentration in α-solid solution and the γ′-layer characterized by low diffusion  mobility is not formed on the surface. </p...|$|E
40|$|Nitriding {{processes}} {{are widely used}} to improve the fatigue properties of steel. Fatigue failures in nitriding steels initiate from sub-surface non-metallic inclusions, which are usually oxide inclusions. It is known that duplex oxysulphide inclusions are less harmful to the fatigue properties of steel than oxide inclusions alone, since the sulphide outer phase acts as a buffer to the oxide in the core, and thus reduces the fatigue-initiating stress influence of oxide inclusions. Twelve <b>nitriding</b> <b>steel</b> melts were produced, and non-metallic inclusions, modified by adding CaSi cored wire, were investigated. Since calcium has a high vapour pressure and a low solubility in molten steel, {{it is difficult to}} effectively modify non-metallic inclusions by the addition of CaSi cored wire in small furnaces. However, {{it was found that the}} addition of CaSi cored wire at a lower temperature was favourable to higher calcium injection yield in a small furnace, and it was also observed that the reaction with liquid steel was less violent, resulting in the effective modification of non-metallic inclusions. Analysis by a scanning electron microscope with energy dispersive X-ray technique showed a proportion of duplex oxysulphide inclusions formed in ingots from 11 A, with the remainder being predominantly globular calcium aluminate inclusions. Specimens for direct stress fatigue testing were produced from steels containing both modified and unmodified inclusions, and the fatigue properties were compared. It was found that calcium aluminate inclusions had a more deleterious effect on the fatigue properties of steel than alumina inclusions. In calcium modified steels, at lifetimes of more than 5 x 10 ⁵ cycles, fatigue cracks always initiated from calcium aluminate inclusions, which were partly or completely debonded from the matrix. The fatigue properties of the calcium modified steel was found to be inferior to those of the unmodified steel. No duplex oxysulphide inclusions were found among those inclusions which produced fatigue crack initiations, and this indicated that when they were present calcium aluminate inclusions governed the fatigue properties of steel whether or not duplex oxysulphide inclusions were present in the steel. It is inferred that the fatigue properties of steel can be improved if all large calcium aluminate inclusions are modified to duplex oxysulphide inclusions...|$|E

40|$|This thesis aims {{to provide}} a better {{understanding}} of the influence of various parameters on surface distress in gears. The types of gears of concern in this study are the ones found in gas turbine engines and helicopter gearboxes where tooth contacts are particularly heavily loaded. The work is concerned with the influence of surface roughness, gear material and hard coatings and their effect in reducing the occurrence of scuffing, which is a form of surface distress that can occur under severe conditions of sliding and high temperature. An extensive experimental programme has been carried out using a two-disc machine developed to simulate gas turbine gearing and micro-elastohydrodynamic lubrication (micro-EHL) contacts under realistic conditions of load, speed, surface finish and temperature. The project involved a large number of disc tests with the aim of quantifying the effects of: a significant improvement in surface finish the use of a different gear material and surface hardening and the use of different hard coatings on the resistance to scuffing. This work was conducted using an existing disc machine to extend the work carried out by Patching (1994) who used a single material. The scuffing performance of axially ground (roughness average, Ra = 0. 4 urn) case-carburised steel discs was used as a benchmark against which the performance of alternative materials/surfaces could be measured. Different materials and surface conditions were investigated as follows. The ground discs were superfinished to better than Ra = 0. 1 um using a proprietary polishing method. A <b>nitriding</b> <b>steel</b> was used. Two different super-hard coatings were investigated. The main conclusions to be drawn from the work are: the scuffing resistance of nitrided surfaces is superior to case-carburised surfaces, but it is essential to remove the compound layer ('white layer') to achieve durability at high sliding speeds. The benefits of superfmishing are clearly demonstrated better finish improves the scuffing performance and also gives lower friction and bulk temperatures during operation. Hard coatings show promise, and the triple combination of nitriding, superfmishing and hard coatings gave particularly impressive scuffing resistance in this investigation. A micro-EHL solver was used to simulate the conditions of the various tests. The solver, which was developed at Cardiff by Professor H P Evans and his associates, can be used to simulate the lubrication of rough surfaces in contact under realistic thin film conditions in which there is significant asperity interaction including momentary 'dry' contact. Surface profiles acquired from the discs used in the tests were used as input to the solver. Using the solver a number of objective performance parameters were obtained including high pressure cycling and occurrences of thin or zero film within the nominal contact between the discs. The results of the simulations confirmed the distinct advantages of using smoother surfaces and contributed to an understanding of the way in which hard coatings can lead to surface improvement. In addition to work on scuffing the project included the design and manufacture of a test rig, complete with data acquisition and control system, for research on contact fatigue and micropitting in particular...|$|E

The unlubricated sliding wear behaviour of gas nitrided, plasma nitrided, and ferritic nitrocarburized BS 970, 905 M 39 (EN 41 B) steels was investigated systematically from an engineering point of view. Commercial nitriding processes were employed, and the wear {{studies were carried out}} using a pin-on-disc machine over a wide range of sliding speeds and applied loads. The worn specimens and wear debris were examined by several techniques; including optical and electron microscopy and X-ray analysis. A sharp wear rate transition between mild and severe regimes was identified by varying the load for both untreated and gas <b>nitrided</b> <b>steels.</b> The wear rate was reduced by gas nitriding by up to two orders of magnitude, depending on the sliding condition. Moreover, gas nitriding expanded the mild wear region toward higher loads and sliding speeds. In the mild regime an oxidative wear mechanism operated, contrasting with the metallic wear in the severe regime. Wear maps for untreated and gas <b>nitrided</b> <b>steels</b> have been constructed, which show the dominant regimes of the wear mechanisms. A "wear-face-limited" gas nitrided pin test showed that the benefit of the treatment was lost once the effective surface layer was completely worn away. It is suggested that hardness has a crucial role in determining the wear rate through nitrided diffusion layers.

40|$|AbstractIn {{the present}} study, the {{performance}} parameters of EDM process {{are to be}} evaluated to achieve the feasibility in machining of <b>nitride</b> <b>steel</b> En 41 b which is extensively used in applications that required excellent resistance to wear and abrasion, e. g., connecting rods, small extruders, valve stems, dies, and gears. Here, the machining is done using rotary tubular copper and brass electrodes, in which the tool electrodes may have an additional rotary or orbiting motion, {{in addition to the}} servo-controlled feed. Taguchi's signal-to-noise ratio and grey relational analysis were applied in this work to improve the multi-response characteristics such as MRR and EWR on En 41 b steel and the optimum combination of control parameters such as current, gap voltage, pulse ON time and pulse OFF time were obtained...|$|R
