25|$|Hegel {{wanted to}} philosophize about Christianity {{but had no}} {{intention}} to ever become a Christian. For Climacus, the individual comes to {{know who he is}} by an intensely personal and passionate pursuit of what will give meaning to his life. As an existing individual, who must come to terms with everyday life, overcome its obstacles and setbacks, who must live and die, the single individual has a life that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> <b>will</b> ever live. In dealing with what life brings his way, the individual must encounter them with all his psycho-physical resources.|$|E
25|$|She {{goes with}} Brody to a {{memorial}} service for Walden at Langley, and tells him she wants to be with him. During the service, al-Qaeda operatives plant a bomb in Brody's car and detonate it, in an attack planned by Nazir in advance of his death. The blast kills Estes, Walden's family, and numerous senior government officials. Al-Qaeda also leaks Brody's confession video, thus framing him for the attack. Believing that Brody is innocent yet knowing that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> <b>will,</b> Carrie drives him over the Canada–US border and sets out to clear his name.|$|E
25|$|To give an example, two chess players {{might be}} engaged in a bitter {{struggle}} at the board, but they share all sorts of Background presuppositions: that they will take turns to move, that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> <b>will</b> intervene, that they are both playing to the same rules, that the fire alarm won't go off, that the board won't suddenly disintegrate, that their opponent won't magically turn into a grapefruit, and so on indefinitely. As most of these possibilities won't have occurred to either player, Searle thinks the Background must be unconscious, though elements of it can be called to consciousness (if the fire alarm does go off, say).|$|E

500|$|David Calvert-Smith, for the prosecution, {{alleged that}} the detectives' {{supposedly}} contemporaneous notes of the fifth interview with Silcott had been altered after the fact to include the self-incriminating remarks. Silcott had refused to answer questions during the first four interviews. During the fifth, when told there were witness statements that he had struck Blakelock with a machete or similar, the notes show him saying: [...] "Those kids will never go to court. You wait and see. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> <b>will</b> talk to you. You can't keep me away from them." [...] Silcott denied ever having said these words.|$|E
500|$|The notes {{show him}} asking: [...] "Who told you that?" [...] When the detectives {{said they had}} witnesses, he {{reportedly}} said: [...] "They are only kids. No {{one is going to}} believe them." [...] The notes say he walked around the interview room with tears in his eyes, saying: [...] "You cunts, you cunts," [...] and [...] "Jesus, Jesus," [...] then: [...] "You ain't got enough evidence. Those kids will never go to court. You wait and see. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> <b>will</b> talk to you. You can't keep me away from them." [...] The notes show him saying of the murder weapons: [...] "You're too slow, man, they gone." [...] He was at that point charged with murder, to which he reportedly responded: [...] "They won't give evidence against me." ...|$|E
500|$|The act was {{something}} that affected Kiedis significantly because he had never before experienced such an enlightening ideology on life. Growing up in Los Angeles, he had always thought differently from Hagen. Instead of giving material possessions away and being free thinking, the vocalist believed one must take what one wants, as <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> <b>will</b> provide. Instead, he now adopted Hagen's philosophy: [...] "It was such an epiphany that someone would {{want to give me}} her favorite thing. That stuck with me forever. Every time I'd be thinking 'I have to keep,' I'd remember 'No, you gotta give away instead.' When I started going regularly to [...] meetings, one of the principles I had learned was that the way to maintain your own sobriety is to give it to another suffering alcoholic. Every time you empty your vessel of that energy, fresh new energy comes flooding in." [...] Flea's bassline for the song allowed Kiedis to recall this incident and he believed the music paired perfectly with the lyrics. During the verses, Kiedis departs from the idea of unselfishness and sings about a variety of topics including long-time friend River Phoenix, musician Bob Marley and various sexual themes including fertility and lust.|$|E

500|$|Other than studio personnel, only twelve {{people saw}} the {{original}} 42-reel version of Greed {{at a special}} screening in January 1924; they included Harry Carr, Rex Ingram, Aileen Pringle, Carmel Myers, Idwal Jones, Joseph Jackson, Jack Jungmeyer, Fritz Tidden, Welford Beaton, Valentine Mandelstam, and Jean Bertin. After the screening Jones, Carr and Ingram all agreed that they had just seen the greatest film ever made {{and that it was}} unlikely that a better film would ever be made. Carr wrote a review of the advance screening where he raved that he [...] "saw a wonderful picture the other day—that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> <b>will</b> ever see... I can't imagine {{what they are going to}} do with it. It is like Les Miserables. Episodes come along that you think have no bearing on the story, then 12 or 14 reels later it hits you with a crash. For stark, terrible realism and marvelous artistry, it is the greatest picture I have ever seen. But I don't know what it will be like when it shrinks to 8 reels." [...] Jonathan Rosenbaum suggested that Carr was most likely referring to a cut sequence early in the film that introduced all of the characters who lived in McTeague's building. The forty-minute scene depicted what the tenants did on a Saturday afternoon, and established cinematic atmosphere without furthering the plot. Rosenbaum compared the cut sequence to novels of the 19th century and to the first few hours of Jacques Rivette's Out 1. Jones publicly praised the advance screening and compared Greed to The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari and Dr. Mabuse the Gambler. However, Welford Beaton of The Film Spectator disliked the 42-reel version and criticized its excessive use of close-ups.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} for Voliminal was mixed. The newspaper Dawn called the DVD [...] "an audible treat for thrash and speed metal fans", {{he went on}} to compliment drummer Joey Jordison, stating that he [...] "structures his beats and percussions in a very traditional thrash set-up, almost as well as (dare I say it) the great Dave Lombardo of Slayer fame". Ultimate Guitar called the DVD [...] "behind-the-scene action in an unorthodox format, complete with choppy editing and absolutely no specific chronology". They would go on to state though the DVD [...] "only gives partial attention to the music", [...] "The best moment in the 2-disc collection comes during a chat with Corey Taylor, who shares his feelings about everything from his less-than-perfect relationship with his father to the obstacles that the band faced in its early days". TuneLab wrote [...] "Slipknot takes a unique approach to their latest film, as they turn {{what could have been a}} mundane video of live footage and band antics into a rather peculiar and extremely interesting movie". The [...] "scatterbrained and choppy" [...] style of Voliminal [...] " [...] the viewer to feel like he or she is [...] "outside looking in", rather than being truly involved with the band's happenings". Reviewing for Blogcritics, Chris Beaumont wrote [...] " [...] was enthralled and bored by the documentary". He went on to state, [...] "the best part is watching them perform", despite the [...] "audio is near unlistenable"; [...] "these guys know their way around the stage...this shows the whole package". Reviewing for Billboard, Christa Titus criticized the DVD writing it [...] "randomly [...] footage from concerts and the usual backstage antics with images of pigeons and overflowing toilets, then tossing in whatever visual effects struck M. Shawn Crahan's fancy while he edited it." [...] She concluded [...] "Save your cash for the band's next tour...that's where you'll get your money's worth". Film School Rejects's Cole Abaius wrote of the DVD, [...] ", probably <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> <b>will</b> purchase or enjoy this DVD". He added that with no narration, [...] "the images are left to speak for themselves", only [...] "some just don’t speak loudly enough". Despite the mixed reviews, Voliminal was certified gold in Australia, platinum in the United States, and double platinum in Canada. The album peaked at the 5th spot on Billboards Music Video charts, and remained on the chart for 10 weeks.|$|E

2500|$|Queen Victoria wrote {{after his}} death that though she regretted his passing, she had never liked or {{respected}} him: [...] "Strange, and solemn {{to think of that}} strong, determined man, with so much worldly ambition – gone! He had often worried and distressed us, though as Pr. Minister he had behaved very well." [...] Florence Nightingale reacted differently upon hearing of his death: [...] "He will be a great loss to us. Tho' he made a joke when asked to do the right thing, he always did it. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> <b>will</b> be able to carry things thro' the Cabinet as he did. I shall lose a powerful protector...He was so much more in earnest than he appeared. He did not do himself justice." ...|$|E
2500|$|If {{voluntary}} {{provision of}} public goods will not work, then the obvious solution is making their provision involuntary. This saves {{each of us}} from our own tendency to be a free rider, while also assuring us that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> <b>will</b> be allowed to free ride. [...] One frequently proposed {{solution to the problem}} is for governments or states to impose taxation to fund the production of public goods. This does not actually solve the theoretical problem because good government is itself a public good. [...] Thus it is difficult to ensure the government has an incentive to provide the optimum amount even if it were possible for the government to determine precisely what amount would be optimum. [...] These issues are studied by public choice theory and public finance.|$|E

They're the female counterparts of the Mattachine Society — and one of the convention highlights will be an address by Atty. Morris Lowenthal titled, 'The Gay Bar in the Courts.' Oh brother.

2500|$|The alleged {{intention}} of the law, which was published during World War I, was a [...] "temporary movement of the Ottoman citizens" [...] during the conflicts and not the permanent displacement as there was a decree (regulation, or adjunct) {{with respect to the}} relocated citizens by the [...] "Tehcir Law" [...] who wanted to return; it claimed [...] "except those people , <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> <b>will</b> be touched." [...] Also {{if we look at the}} fourth section of the Tehcir law, it was specifically designed to hold the enforcer units responsible to follow up and record the properties owned by the subjects of the immigration. The law included a responsible party for the protection of properties the owners could/will return in a later term. Another law was passed to regulate the enforcement of this section On 10 June 1915. In this section, it was demanded that there would be three copies of this information; one kept in the regional churches, one in the regional administration, and one kept by the commission responsible for the execution of the law. The second and third parties of this law were held responsible for the protection of the properties until the immigrants' return.|$|E
2500|$|The show {{underwent}} further tightening, namely {{with improved}} sewer lighting and {{the incorporation of}} the Javert suicide scene effect. Boublil explained: [...] "The transfer from London to the United States has prompted further modifications. 'We are taking this opportunity to rethink and perfect, to rewrite some details which probably <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> <b>will</b> see, but which for us are still long nights of work,' Mr. Boublil says. 'There are things that nobody had time to do in London, {{and here we have}} a wonderful opportunity to fix a few things. No one will notice, perhaps, but for us, it will make us so happy if we can better this show. We would like this to be the final version.'" [...] Two songs were deleted—the complete version of Gavroche's song [...] "Little People" [...] and the adult Cosette's [...] "I Saw Him Once". A short section at the beginning of [...] "In My Life" [...] replaced [...] "I Saw Him Once". The lyrics in Javert's [...] "Stars" [...] were changed. It now ended with the line, [...] "This I swear by the stars!", while the London production and cast recording ended with the repeated line, [...] "Keeping watch in the night".|$|E
2500|$|More intent {{than ever}} on {{destroying}} the glee club, Sue forms a [...] "League of Doom", {{which consists of}} former glee club director Sandy Ryerson (Stephen Tobolowsky), the coach of rival glee club Vocal Adrenaline, Dustin Goolsby (Cheyenne Jackson), and Will's ex-wife Terri Schuester (Jessalyn Gilsig). Their first mission, to ruin a New Directions benefit, fails when Sandy is won over by a performance from Mercedes Jones (Amber Riley) and donates the full amount needed. Devastated by Jean's death from pneumonia, Sue turns to Terri, who has the glee club's plane tickets for Nationals changed from New York to Tripoli. She also removes Becky from the Cheerios, because she reminds her of her sister. Kurt and his stepbrother Finn Hudson (Cory Monteith) help Sue to clean out Jean's things, and she accepts their offer to have New Directions perform at the funeral, as she is afraid <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> <b>will</b> come. At the well-attended funeral service, an emotional Sue is unable to continue reading her eulogy after a few sentences, and Will reads the remainder for her. Touched by his support, Sue tells Will {{he is a good}} friend and she will no longer go after the glee club. She will instead be running for the United States House of Representatives on a platform of lowering health care costs, as her sister had faced significantly higher bills in her last few years. She then apologizes to Becky, reinstates her {{as a member of the}} Cheerios, and tells her she will be captain of the squad next year. As a final act of reconciliation, Sue asks for and receives a hug from Becky.|$|E
