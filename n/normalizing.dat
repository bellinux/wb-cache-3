These include alpha hydroxy acid, anti-androgen medications, antibiotics, antiseborrheic medications, azelaic acid, benzoyl peroxide, hormonal treatments, keratolytic soaps, nicotinamide, retinoids, and salicylic acid.

5|$|While {{generally}} {{adhering to}} American conservatism, McCain established {{a reputation as}} a political maverick for his willingness to defy Republican orthodoxy on several issues. In reaction to his Keating Five experience, he made campaign finance reform one of his signature concerns. He was also a leader in <b>normalizing</b> diplomatic relations with Vietnam. His national visibility as a senator gave him the basis to begin a campaign for the 2000 Republican nomination for President of the United States.|$|E
5|$|Another {{difficult}} area was feats. Although common feats worked well, with a random {{chance of success}} or failure, uncommon ones would appear to fail more often. To avoid this, randomization {{was replaced by a}} degree of difficulty in accomplishing the feat. Although pen-and-paper falling damage is random, the computer game bases damage on the distance of the fall. The team's biggest challenge was adapting disciplines. The pen-and-paper version may require a little blood that requires a long time to use, or have no blood cost and can be used at will; upgraded disciplines had additional requirements considered too confusing for a computer game. Troika attempted to equalize the disciplines, keeping the effect intact and <b>normalizing</b> the cost, so a first-level power requires one blood point, a second-level two points and so on. To balance the clans, the aristocratic Ventrue were only allowed to feed on noble blood, though this was changed to allow them to feed on lower-class humans, receiving less blood. During character creation, the game had an optional character biography with unique positive and negative characteristics (increasing one ability while limiting another). This was removed from the released game; Activision felt that there was insufficient test time, and removing it was a more stable option.|$|E

30|$|Once {{we have a}} {{relation}} between the crack density parameter and <b>normalized</b> conductivity in the study region, we can evaluate <b>normalized</b> conductivity from the crack density parameter. The inverse of <b>normalized</b> conductivity gives <b>normalized</b> resistivity: the resistivity <b>normalized</b> by the fluid resistivity. Dividing the observed resistivity by the <b>normalized</b> resistivity leads to the fluid resistivity. Its inverse gives the fluid conductivity. If the obtained fluid conductivity is an unrealistic value, we should change the rock type and evaluate the crack density parameter and <b>normalized</b> conductivity. Since the number of parameters to be estimated is larger than that of observables, we will have large uncertainties in the interpretation. The appropriateness of the interpretation should be checked from geological and petrological points of view.|$|R
