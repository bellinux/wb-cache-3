5|$|Yorcks {{commanding}} officer, Captain Piper, {{was among}} those rescued. In December 1914 he was court-martialled and sentenced to two years' imprisonment for <b>negligence,</b> disobedience of orders, and homicide through <b>negligence.</b> The ship's wreck was partially scrapped in 1929–30; more work was done in 1965, though the ship was not completely removed until work resumed in 1982.|$|E

5|$|Nevertheless, other historians like Masahiro Yamamoto {{have argued}} that the death {{sentence}} was too severe a penalty for Matsui's crime of mere <b>negligence</b> in failing to stop the massacre. The journalist Richard Minear also points out that Matsui's penalty was disproportionately severe compared to the other convicted defendants. Kuniaki Koiso was found guilty on four counts and Mamoru Shigemitsu was found guilty on five counts, in both cases including one count of <b>negligence,</b> and both were given prison sentences. Matsui, by contrast, was found guilty of only one count of <b>negligence</b> but was sentenced to death. The historian Tokushi Kasahara argues that the prosecution at the IMTFE did not attempt seriously to investigate all those {{who were involved in the}} Nanking Massacre, and instead just decided to make Matsui the sole scapegoat for the whole atrocity.|$|E

5|$|Robert Wood, the {{engineer}} who {{signed off on}} {{the engineer}}ing report declaring the mall structurally sound just {{a few weeks before the}} roof collapse, was charged with two counts of criminal <b>negligence</b> causing death and one count of criminal <b>negligence</b> causing bodily harm. According to the inquiry, Wood had previously indicated in conversation that he was aware that the roof was at risk of caving in, but altered his final report at Nazarian's request so that the structural issues did not jeopardize the building's refinancing. His trial began in September 2016.|$|E
5|$|The Cambridge Water Company {{brought a}} case against Eastern Counties Leather in the High Court of Justice, wanting £1 million in damages {{for the cost of}} finding a new {{borehole}} and an unsuccessful attempt to decontaminate the original one, and an injunction to prevent any more use of PCE. They argued that Eastern Counties Leather were liable in three ways; first, in <b>negligence,</b> second, in nuisance, and third, under the rule developed in Rylands v Fletcher. The case came before Kennedy J, who dismissed all three of the Company's claims. On the matter of <b>negligence,</b> he held that the damage had to be reasonably foreseeable, as was required under Overseas Tankship (UK) Ltd v Morts Dock and Engineering Co Ltd; he applied this same test to the claim under nuisance. Applying the case of Hughes v Lord Advocate, Kennedy found that the harm was not reasonably foreseeable, and both actions under nuisance and <b>negligence</b> must fail.|$|E
5|$|After the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, the Port Authority was sued by {{survivors}} of the attack for <b>negligence</b> in not making security upgrades to known flaws that could have prevented the attack. The Port Authority was ruled to be negligent.|$|E

5|$|In 2009, Jones {{brought a}} claim for damages for {{professional}} <b>negligence</b> against Kaney, {{on the basis that}} the personal injury claim had had to be settled for considerably less than would have been the case had Kaney not signed a document that apparently did not reflect her views. Kaney applied to strike out the claim before filing a defence, on the basis that the claim could not possibly succeed given the binding authority of the Court of Appeal decision of Stanton v Callaghan in 1998 that expert witnesses could not be sued for <b>negligence</b> when preparing a joint statement with the opposing side's expert witness.|$|E
5|$|Presiding Justice Edward Lazansky (joined by Justice J. Addison Young) wrote a dissent. Lazansky, {{the son of}} Czech immigrants, {{had been}} elected New York Secretary of State as a Democrat in 1910. Elected to the Supreme Court in 1917, he had been {{designated}} presiding justice of the Second Department by Governor Smith earlier in 1927. Lazansky did not question the jury finding of <b>negligence,</b> but felt that the employees' conduct was not the proximate cause of Palsgraf's injuries, since the man's conduct in bringing a package that might explode to a crowded passenger station was an independent act of <b>negligence,</b> rendering the neglect by the railroad too remote in causation {{for there to be}} liability.|$|E

5|$|The general {{principle}} {{is that a}} trespass to the person must be a direct and intentional act, while if it was indirect or unintentional the tort of <b>negligence</b> is more appropriate, as established in Letang v Cooper. The tort of trespass to the person contains three possible types; assault, battery and false imprisonment.|$|E
5|$|There {{are three}} main forms of {{manslaughter}} in English law: voluntary manslaughter, cases which would otherwise amount to murder {{but for some}} legally recognised mitigating factor; and involuntary manslaughter which includes cases of gross <b>negligence</b> manslaughter and unlawful act manslaughter.|$|E
5|$|While {{the courts}} in New Jersey allow actions based on dram shop {{liability}} or social host liability, they will instruct a jury to consider the intoxicated person's <b>negligence</b> under the doctrine of comparative <b>negligence.</b> Licensed establishments and social hosts may be liable for drunk driving accidents, assaults, falls, and other injuries and property damage caused by a customer, but are not liable for behavior which is unforeseeable (e.g. falling out of a tree), nor are they liable if they only served food or non-alcoholic beverages to a drunk patron. Dram shop and social host litigation may involve both compensatory and punitive damages. There is a 2-year statute of limitations for such lawsuits, but the time limit may be extended if the victim is a juvenile.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} Johnson {{submitted}} the contributory <b>negligence</b> defense, {{he had not}} yet been able to speak to Polehinke himself. By the time newspapers reported on the court documents, Johnson said he had already told Royse, who criticized the statements, that he would withdraw the argument. Prior to his employment by Comair, Polehinke worked for Gulfstream International as a captain.|$|E
5|$|During the 1895 South Carolina state {{constitutional}} convention, however, Tillman supported {{a provision that}} permitted the removal from office of sheriffs who through <b>negligence</b> or connivance permitted a lynching. He also supported a provision that held the county where the lynching occurred liable for damages of $2,000 or more {{to be paid to}} the heirs of the victim.|$|E
5|$|Reflexiones {{was sent}} to Madrid, where it was added as an {{appendix}} to the second edition of the medical treatise Disertación médica (1786) by Francisco Gil, {{a member of the}} Real Academia Médica de España. Instead of recognition, Espejo acquired enemies because his work criticized the physicians and priests in charge of public health in the Royal Audiencia for their <b>negligence,</b> and he was forced to leave Quito.|$|E
5|$|The Athenians {{then sent}} out a force to assist in garrisoning Corinth, with Iphicrates {{commanding}} the peltasts. The Spartans and the exiles, meanwhile, raided Corinthian territory from Lechaeum, and in 391 BC King Agesilaus led a large Spartan army to the area and attacked a number of strongpoints, winning a number of successes. The Athenians and their allies were largely bottled up in Corinth, but eventually found {{an opportunity to take}} advantage of Spartan <b>negligence.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{loss of the}} Levin J. Marvel {{during the}} {{hurricane}} prompted the United States Congress {{to pass a law}} in 1956, which allowed the Coast Guard to inspect all vessels with more than six passengers; the previous law only allowed inspections for boats of more than 700tons, greatly higher than the 183tons that the Marvel weighed. A federal courthouse charged the inexperienced captain with <b>negligence,</b> giving him a one-year probation.|$|E
5|$|This Joker's Card is a {{representation}} of the ghettos and the violence that occurs within them. It {{takes the form of a}} traveling carnival which releases the same brutality on those who have ignored the inner cities' cries for help. The Card issues a warning against the upper-class and government's <b>negligence</b> toward the lower classes. The cover of Carnival of Carnage was drawn by Joseph Utsler, who would later create artwork for the rest of the albums in the Joker's Cards series.|$|E
5|$|After Fan {{was forced}} to step down from his office, Wang Anshi (1021–1086) became Chancellor of the {{imperial}} court. With the backing of Emperor Shenzong (1067–1085), Wang Anshi severely criticized the educational system and state bureaucracy. Seeking to resolve {{what he saw as}} state corruption and <b>negligence,</b> Wang implemented a series of reforms called the New Policies. These involved land value tax reform, the establishment of several government monopolies, the support of local militias, and the creation of higher standards for the Imperial examination to make it more practical for men skilled in statecraft to pass.|$|E
5|$|Anniyan (English: Outsider or Stranger) is a 2005 Indian Tamil-language {{psychological}} thriller film {{written and}} directed by S. Shankar and produced by V. Ravichandran of Aascar Films. The plot centres on a disillusioned everyman whose frustration at what he sees as increasing social apathy and public <b>negligence</b> leads to a split personality that attempts to right the system. Vikram stars as Ramanujam, an idealistic, law-abiding lawyer who suffers from multiple personality disorder and develops two other identities: a metrosexual fashion model Remo and a vigilante serial killer named Anniyan. Sadha plays his love interest, Nandini. Actors Vivek, Prakash Raj, Nedumudi Venu and Nassar also feature in the film.|$|E
5|$|As of Jan 2013, Directorate General of Civil Aviation(DGCA), AAI and Ministry of Aviation, and the Government of India {{have not}} {{implemented}} {{the recommendations of}} the 812 crash inquiry committee. Work on runway lengthening has not started. 812 Foundation, a Mangalore-based trust, has filed the criminal charges for <b>negligence</b> against regulatory authorities and the airline. Regulatory authority and other organisations named in the petition are thinking of seeking anticipatory bail for their top officials, as the petition seeks non-bailable arrest warrants against those responsible.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{complaints}} from bar owners about {{their inability to}} obtain liability insurance, the state passed legislation in 1987 to limit liability to cases where the server could have realistically known that the patron was underage or intoxicated, and to limit lawsuits to types of injuries that are foreseeable. The act also instituted the legal standard of comparative <b>negligence</b> in these cases, wherein the monetary damages against a licensed establishment can be reduced if {{there are others who}} are also negligent (e.g. the patron, other bars). Additional legislation passed in 1987 substantially limited the liability of social hosts for adult guests.|$|E
5|$|Charlotte Shaw's mother {{subsequently}} sued Edgehill College and {{the teacher}} leading the expedition for <b>negligence.</b> The judgement given on 28 June 2012 found that the teacher had given clear instructions that the group should not attempt to cross Walla Brook but should instead go round it. It further found that the intervention of a passerby, who suggested that the group could cross the brook, had meant that the school could not {{be held responsible for}} the accident. It said that the failure of two teachers to meet up with the group as planned was not incompetence. The judge therefore rejected the claim.|$|E
5|$|Counsel {{assisting}} the Inquiry, Henry Winneke, advocated {{that the cause}} of the accident was Spence's diabetes. Justice Simpson was critical of the Director-General's investigation panel for considering 25 possible causes of the accident but failing to consider that the Department's <b>negligence</b> in licensing a diabetic pilot might have been the root cause of the accident. After the inquiry had received all available information related to Spence's diabetes, Justice Simpson said the insulin reaction of the pilot might have had a considerable bearing on the accident.|$|E
5|$|Fires in the {{workings}} hampered rescue efforts, {{and it took}} several days before they were under control. It took six weeks {{for most of the}} bodies to be recovered and the fire to be extinguished. The subsequent enquiry pointed to errors made by the company and its management leading to charges of <b>negligence</b> against Edward Shaw, the colliery manager, and the owners. Shaw was fined £24 while the company was fined £10; newspapers calculated the cost of each miner lost was just 5 pence.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{collision}} at least 31 lawsuits seeking damages were brought against United Airlines, the U.S. Government, or both. On September 24, 1958, United Airlines filed for damagesbased on the Federal Tort Claims Actagainst the United States in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware. The airline {{alleged that the}} United States through its agents in the United States Air Force negligently operated the F-100F, and sought damages of US$3,576,698. The court found neither crew was negligent for a failure to see and avoid each other, but held the United States was liable because of other <b>negligence.</b> The case was settled on December17, 1962, with the United States agreeing to pay the airline $1.45million.|$|E
5|$|Following the sinking, a Board of Inquiry was {{established}} to investigate the loss. Based on its findings, Captain Loben Maund was court-martialled in February 1942 for <b>negligence.</b> He was found guilty on two counts of negligence: one of failing to ensure that properly constituted damage control parties had remained on board after the general evacuation, and one of failing to ensure the ship was in a sufficient state of readiness to deal with possible damage. The board tempered their judgement with an acknowledgement that a high standard was being expected of Maund, {{and that he was}} primarily concerned with the welfare of his crew.|$|E
5|$|Gordon {{arrives at}} the {{building}} where Rachel perished, at which point Dent judges his fate, along with his own and Batman's, with three separate coin flips. He shoots Batman, spares himself, and threatens to kill Gordon's son, claiming that Gordon's <b>negligence</b> caused his family to die. Before he can, Batman, who was wearing body armor, tackles Dent off the building to his death. Batman persuades Gordon to preserve Dent's heroic image by holding Batman responsible for the killing spree. As the police launch a manhunt for Batman, Gordon destroys the Bat-signal, Fox watches as the sonar device self-destructs and {{walks out of the}} room, and Alfred Pennyworth burns a letter from Rachel about her choice to marry Dent.|$|E
5|$|However, the Russian Army's {{transformation}} into a professional army was not deemed as successful. In September 2008, General Vladimir Boldyrev acknowledged {{that many of}} the professional soldiers did not have better training than the conscripts. Russian Airborne Troops and special forces conducted most of the land fighting. Due to the Russian Air Force's inability to penetrate Georgian air defence, airborne troops could not be airlifted behind Georgian lines. An ambush of a ground-troop commander, in which only five of thirty vehicles in his convoy survived, indicated intelligence and surveillance <b>negligence.</b> Many Russian land units reportedly had an insufficient ammunition supply.|$|E
5|$|In March 2004, {{more than}} 300 {{residents}} from Chen's village of Dongshigu filed {{a petition to}} the village government demanding that they release the village accounts—which hadn't been made public for over ten years—and {{address the issue of}} illegal land requisitions. When village authorities failed to respond, villagers escalated their appeals to the township, county and municipal governments, still without response. Village authorities then began to publicly threaten villagers. In November 2004, Chen acted on behalf of villagers to file a lawsuit in the Qi'nan County Court against the local Public Security Bureau for <b>negligence.</b> The case was accepted, and proceedings began in early 2005.|$|E
