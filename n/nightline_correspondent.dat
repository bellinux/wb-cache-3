2500|$|Church of Scientology leader David Miscavige {{appeared}} in his first ever interview with the media on the program Nightline on February 14, 1992, and was interviewed by Ted Koppel. Miscavige stated that he believed Scientology did not [...] "lend itself well to the press", and he criticized a piece on Scientology that aired on Nightline shortly before his interview. In his criticism of the piece, Miscavige asserted that <b>Nightline</b> <b>correspondents</b> had only interviewed members of CAN, stating, [...] "For instance, something that isn't mentioned in there is that every single detractor on there {{is part of a}} religious hate group called Cult Awareness Network and their sister group called American Family Foundation. Now, I don't know if you've heard of these people, but it's the same as the KKK would be with the blacks. I think if you interviewed a neo-Nazi and asked them to talk about the Jews, you would get a similar result to what you have here." [...] Koppel then posited the notion that others critical of Scientology were less apt to come forward and speak publicly due to fears of potential recrimination from the Church. In 1994, the Cult Awareness Network opened a counter-suit against the Church of Scientology, eleven individual Scientologists and the Los Angeles law firm of Bowles and Moxon.|$|R

5000|$|Kirk Cameron and Ray Comfort {{participated in}} a debate with {{two members of the}} Rational Response Squad (RRS) atheist {{activism}} organization at Calvary Baptist Church in Manhattan, on May 5, 2007. <b>Nightline</b> <b>correspondent</b> Martin Bashir served as moderator at the event. Nightline aired the debate online and included a short two-segment summary on its May 9 broadcast. Cameron told the audience he would prove the existence of God scientifically, without resorting to faith. In reporting on the debate, Slate magazine pointed out that Cameron's declaration to prove God would have made him the first to accomplish this feat in many centuries of religious thought, besting scholars such as Thomas Aquinas. Slate reported that RRS atheist debaters Brian and Kelly defeated the three main arguments of Cameron and Comfort which were: a) everything has a maker, b) the existence of the human conscience shows that there is a higher moral power, and c) Christ is revealed in the Gospel. Although numerous Christians claimed that Comfort and Cameron went to the debate [...] "well-intentioned but unprepared", the two were also widely commended for having a very [...] "positive demeanor" [...] during the debate, in strong contrast to their opponents. In addition, debate viewers accused the moderator, Martin Bashir, of [...] "being biased towards the atheist side." ...|$|E
