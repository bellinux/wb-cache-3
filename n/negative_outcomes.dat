This was the first film where Woo used the dove symbolism and he has used it to similar effect in Hard Target and Face/Off. A cat appears when Ah Jong first meets Jennie on her visit home, and secondarily when Li's partner Tsang tries to catch Ah Jong in Jennie's apartment. In Chinese culture, a cat coming into a home is an omen of ruin and poverty for its inhabitants. Both Tsang and Jennie meet <b>negative</b> <b>outcomes</b> in the film.|$|E

50|$|It is {{important}} to distinguish a self-defeating prophecy from a self-fulfilling prophecy that predicts a <b>negative</b> <b>outcome.</b> If a prophecy of a <b>negative</b> <b>outcome</b> is made, and that <b>negative</b> <b>outcome</b> is achieved {{as a result of}} positive feedback, then it is a self-fulfilling prophecy. For example, if a group of people decide {{they will not be able}} to achieve a goal and stop working towards the goal as a result, their prophecy was self-fulfilling. Likewise, if a prediction of a <b>negative</b> <b>outcome</b> is made, but the outcome is positive because of negative feedback resulting from the rebellion, then that is a self-defeating prophecy.|$|R

40|$|SummaryAnimals {{monitor the}} outcome of their choice and adjust {{subsequent}} choice behavior using the outcome information. Together with the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), the lateral habenula (LHb) has recently attracted attention for its crucial role in monitoring <b>negative</b> <b>outcome.</b> To investigate their contributions to subsequent behavioral adjustment, we recorded single-unit activity from the LHb and ACC in monkeys performing a reversal learning task. The monkey was required to shift a previous choice to the alternative if the choice had been repeatedly unrewarded in past trials. We found that ACC neurons stored outcome information from several past trials, whereas LHb neurons detected the ongoing <b>negative</b> <b>outcome</b> with shorter latencies. ACC neurons, but not LHb neurons, signaled a behavioral shift in the next trial. Our findings suggest that, although both the LHb and the ACC represent signals associated with <b>negative</b> <b>outcome,</b> these structures contribute to subsequent behavioral adjustment in different ways...|$|R

Those who have performance approach goals strive for high grades and seek opportunities to demonstrate their abilities. Those who have performance avoidance goals are driven by fear of failure and avoid situations where their abilities are exposed. Research has found that mastery goals are associated with many positive outcomes such as persistence {{in the face of}} failure, preference for challenging tasks, creativity and intrinsic motivation. Performance avoidance goals are associated with <b>negative</b> <b>outcomes</b> such as poor concentration while studying, disorganized studying, less self-regulation, shallow information processing and test anxiety. Performance approach goals are associated with positive outcomes, and some <b>negative</b> <b>outcomes</b> such as an unwillingness to seek help and shallow information processing.|$|E

40|$|Do {{our bodies}} control our minds? That people {{approach}} positive outcomes is not surprising, but do people also infer an outcome is rewarding from their bodily sensation of approaching it, and does this positivity transfer indirectly to other outcomes linked in memory {{to the original}} <b>negative</b> <b>outcome?</b> We posit that, because people usually approach reward, they mistakenly infer that approach must equal reward. Thus, a sensation of approach, even toward a <b>negative</b> <b>outcome,</b> makes them feel more positively toward the <b>negative</b> <b>outcome</b> and associated outcomes. Experiment 1 demonstrates a positive effect of embodied movement in space toward an otherwise aversive product. Experiments 2 and 3 additionally show positive effects of psychological movement in time, using evaluative conditioning procedures, to associated stimuli in memory.

40|$|Background: Emerging {{evidence}} suggests that the APOE 4 allele may increase the risk of a <b>negative</b> <b>outcome</b> in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), but the results are conflicting. A genetic variable predicting the individual clinical course is currently lacking. Objective: To examine the association between the APOE 4 allele and a <b>negative</b> <b>outcome.</b> A secondary objective was to investigate the association between the APOE 4 allele and delayed ischemia, a major complication of SAH. Methods: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, CINHAL, LILACS, and www. google. it through March 2006. We hand-searched journals, international conference proceedings, and reference lists of retrieved articles. Individual patient data were requested from the corresponding authors of the original articles. Information on study design, participant characteristics, clinical outcome, delayed ischemia, and confounder distribution were independently abstracted by two investigators. Results: We included eight observational studies (696 patients for the clinical outcome and 600 for the delayed ischemia analyses). The corresponding authors of all the retrieved publications but one gave their original data. Summary odds ratios (ORs) were calculated by means of the random-effect model. The risk of a <b>negative</b> <b>outcome</b> (OR = 2. 558; 95 % CI 1. 610 to 4. 065) and delayed ischemia (OR = 2. 044; 95 % CI 1. 269 to 3. 291) were increased in the E 4 carriers.

25|$|Related {{to their}} {{increased}} tendency for risk-taking, adolescents show impaired behavioral inhibition, including deficits in extinction learning.

This phenomenon also has consequences for behavioral treatments based on the principle of extinction, such as cue exposure therapy for anxiety or drug addiction. It has been suggested that impaired inhibition, specifically extinction, may help to explain adolescent propensity to relapse to drug-seeking even following behavioral treatment for addiction.|$|E
40|$|This study {{applies the}} disconfirmation of {{expectations}} paradigm {{to explain what}} makes the consumption of sin products (high risk alcohol consumption) a satisfactory or unsatisfactory experience. It further tests if it affects readiness to change behaviour. It illustrates that disconfirmation of expectations should focus on consumption outcomes as they motivate customers to consume products and services. Furthermore, both positive and <b>negative</b> <b>outcome</b> expectancies should be included. The alcohol expectancy literature offers operational definitions of positive and <b>negative</b> <b>outcome</b> expectancies. However, alcohol expectancy studies do not use the disconfirmation paradigm to explain high risk drinking behaviours, even though disconfirmation of expectations {{have been shown to}} be a better predictor of customer satisfaction and behavioural intentions than customer expectations. Data gained via convenience sampling of undergraduate students from all divisions within a large Australian University provided a usable sample size of 462. The results and analysis illustrate a very distinct separation of four positive outcome expectation factors and four <b>negative</b> <b>outcome</b> expectation factors.
