5|$|The {{majority}} of woodpeckers are sedentary {{but there are}} a few examples of migratory species such as the rufous-bellied woodpecker and yellow-bellied sapsucker, and the Eurasian wryneck breeds in Europe and west Asia and migrates to the Sahel in Africa in the winter. More northerly populations of Lewis's woodpecker, <b>northern</b> <b>flicker,</b> Williamson's sapsucker, red-breasted sapsucker and red-naped sapsucker all move southwards in the fall in North America. Most woodpecker movements can be described as dispersive, such as when young birds seek territories after fledging, or eruptive, to escape harsh weather conditions. Several species are altitudinal migrants, for example the grey-capped woodpecker, which moves to lowlands from hills during the winter months. The woodpeckers that do migrate do so during the day.|$|E
25|$|Several {{varieties}} of rattlesnakes are indigenous to the region. While only the Pacific Northwest rattler makes its home in Northern California, almost a dozen rattlesnakes make {{their home in}} the deserts of Southern California, including the western diamondback and the Mojave rattlesnake. Birds in the region include the Anna's hummingbird, acorn woodpecker, <b>northern</b> <b>flicker,</b> California towhee, California vulture, red-tailed hawk and many more.|$|E
25|$|Flocks are {{sometimes}} formed with the hairy woodpecker (Picoides villosus), downy woodpecker (P. pubescens), <b>northern</b> <b>flicker</b> (Coloptes auratus), Clark's nutcracker, and European starling (Sturnus vulgaris) for {{a portion of}} the year, but these species are not important for the maintenance of the flock. The benefits of interspecific flocking are probably for protection from predators during feeding and to assist in locating locally abundant but scattered food.|$|E

5000|$|The gilded flicker most {{frequently}} builds its nest {{hole in a}} majestic saguaro cactus, excavating a nest hole nearer the top than the ground. The cactus defends itself against water loss into the cavity of the nesting hole by secreting sap that hardens into a waterproof structure that {{is known as a}} saguaro boot. [...] <b>Northern</b> <b>flickers,</b> on the other hand, nest in riparian trees and very rarely inhabit saguaros. Gilded flickers occasionally hybridize with <b>northern</b> <b>flickers</b> in the narrow zones where their range and habitat overlap.|$|R
50|$|P. flexilis, is an {{important}} source of food for several species, including red squirrels and Clark's nutcrackers. American black bears may raid squirrel caches for limber pine nuts. Squirrels, <b>Northern</b> <b>flickers,</b> and mountain bluebirds often nest in the trees.|$|R
25|$|Nyssa sylvatica is an {{important}} food source for many migrating birds in the fall. Its early color change (foliar fruit flagging) is thought to attract birds to the available fruit, which ripen before many other fall fruits and berries. The fruit is quite marked, dark blue, in clusters of two or three. The sour fruits are eagerly sought by many kinds of birds, including: American robin, Swainson's thrush, gray-cheeked thrush, hermit thrush, wood thrush, northern cardinal, northern mockingbird, blue jay, red-bellied woodpecker, yellow-bellied sapsucker, <b>northern</b> <b>flicker,</b> pileated woodpecker, eastern phoebe, brown thrasher, eastern bluebird, European starling, scarlet tanager, gray catbird, cedar waxwing, and American crow, all primarily eastern North American birds migrating or residing year-round within the tree's range.|$|E
500|$|Although {{many species}} of bird imitate the vocalizations of other birds, the {{northern}} mockingbird is the best known in North America for doing so. Among the species and vocalizations imitated are Carolina wren, northern cardinal, tufted titmouse, eastern towhee, house sparrow, wood thrush and eastern bluebird songs, calls of the <b>northern</b> <b>flicker</b> and great crested flycatcher, jeers and pumphandles of the blue jay, and alarm, chups, and chirrs [...] of the American robin. It imitates not only birds, but also other animals such as cats, dogs, frogs, crickets and sounds from artificial items such as unoiled wheels and even car alarms. As convincing as these imitations may be to humans, they often fail to fool other birds, such as the Florida scrub-jay.|$|E

50|$|This bird's call is a {{sustained}} laugh, ki ki ki ki, more congenial {{than that of}} the pileated woodpecker. One may also hear a constant knocking as they often drum on trees or even metal objects to declare territory. Like most woodpeckers, <b>northern</b> <b>flickers</b> drum on objects as a form of communication and territory defense. In such cases, the object is to make as loud a noise as possible, so woodpeckers sometimes drum on metal objects.|$|R

40|$|The {{importance}} of cavities as roost sites in migratory species is often unknown {{because it is}} challenging to monitor cavity use during the non-breeding period. We documented cavity use throughout the annual cycle of a woodpecker using light-level geolocators. <b>Northern</b> <b>Flickers</b> Colaptes auratus spent 63 – 90 % of nights roosting in a cavity throughout the year, including during migration. The high frequency of year-round cavity use by Flickers suggests that cavities provide benefits beyond nest-sites. Our work highlights the potential use of geolocators to examine cavity use...|$|R
50|$|These diving birds forage underwater. Year-round, about 32% {{of their}} prey is crustaceans, 28% is aquatic insects and 10% is molluscs.
