50|$|An {{alternative}} nomenclature {{is derived}} {{in a similar}} fashion from the corresponding Greek roots; for example, <b>niladic</b> (or medadic), monadic, dyadic, triadic, polyadic, and so on. Thence derive the alternative terms adicity and adinity for the Latin-derived arity.|$|E
50|$|The user may define custom {{functions}} which, like variables, {{are identified}} by name {{rather than by}} a non-textual symbol. The function header defines whether a custom function is <b>niladic</b> (no arguments), monadic (one right argument) or dyadic (left and right arguments), the local name of the result (to {{the left of the}} ‚Üê assign arrow), and whether it has any local variables (each separated by semicolon ';').Whether functions with the same identifier but different adicity are distinct is implementation-defined. If allowed, then a function CURVEAREA could be defined twice to replace both monadic CIRCLEAREA and dyadic SEGMENTAREA above, with the monadic or dyadic function being selected by the context in which it was referenced.|$|E
50|$|Another {{approach}} to RISCs was the minimal instruction set computer (MISC), <b>niladic,</b> or zero-operand instruction set. This approach realized that most space in an instruction {{was used to}} identify the operands of the instruction. These machines placed the operands on a push-down (last-in, first out) stack. The instruction set was supplemented with a few instructions to fetch and store memory. Most used simple caching to provide extremely fast RISC machines, with very compact code. Another benefit was that the interrupt latencies were very small, smaller than most CISC machines (a rare trait in RISC machines). The Burroughs large systems architecture used this approach. The B5000 was designed in 1961, long before the term RISC was invented. The architecture puts six 8-bit instructions in a 48-bit word, and was a precursor to very long instruction word (VLIW) design (see below: 1990 to today).|$|E
