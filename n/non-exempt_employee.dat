5000|$|On July 1, 2011, Connecticut Governor Dannel P. Malloy {{signed into}} law Public Act No. 11-52 which will make Connecticut {{the first state to}} mandate paid sick leave. The Act, which only {{narrowly}} passed through Connecticut’s Senate (18-17) and House of Representatives (76-65), took effect on January 1, 2012, and requires employers to allow their “service workers” to earn one hour of paid sick leave for every 40 hours worked, capped at a maximum of 40 hours per year. The Act applies to the “service workers” of employers with 50 or more employees in Connecticut during any single quarter in the previous year. It is estimated that 200,000 to 300,000 workers will be eligible for the paid leave. The Act defines “service worker” as an hourly or <b>non-exempt</b> <b>employee</b> who is primarily engaged in one of 68 occupations including: Food Service Manager, Medical and Health Services Manager, Librarian, Pharmacist, Physician Assistant, Registered Nurse, Home Health Aide, Nursing Aide, Orderly and Attendant, Security Guard, Cook, Food Preparation Worker, Bartender, Fast Food and Counter Worker, Waiter, Waitress, Dishwasher, Host, Hostess, Janitor, Usher, Lobby Attendant, Ticket Taker, Barber, Baggage Porter, Bellhop, Concierge, Cashier, Retail Salesperson, Courier, Secretary, Administrative Assistant, Computer Operator, Data Entry and Information Processing Worker, Bus Driver, Taxi Driver, and Chauffeur. Day laborers and temporary workers are not included within the definition of a “service worker.” ...|$|E
40|$|Every year, {{non-exempt}} employees cumulatively waste {{over one}} man-year tracking {{their time and}} using the timekeeping Web page to save those times. This app eliminates this waste. The innovation is a native iPhone app. Libraries were built around a reverse- engineered JPL API. It represents a punch-in/punch-out paradigm for timekeeping. It is accessible natively via iPhones, and features ease of access. Any <b>non-exempt</b> <b>employee</b> can natively punch in and out, as well as save and view their JPL timecard. This app is built on custom libraries created by reverse-engineering the standard timekeeping application. Communication is through custom libraries that re-route traffic through BrowserRAS (remote access service). This has value at any center where employees track their time...|$|E
40|$|Excerpt] This article {{explores the}} effects that these {{regulations}} have on: (a) the form of labor contracts and on training outcomes such as: (b) who pays for work place training of <b>non-exempt</b> <b>employees,</b> (c) whether training is obtained at schools or firms, (d) how much training <b>non-exempt</b> <b>employees</b> get? The evidence on who gets and who pays for training {{is consistent with the}} proposition that these regulations are having {{the effects that}} economists would predict for them. Many other explanations fit the data just as well, however, so causal connections between these regulations and training outcomes cannot be proved beyond a reasonable doubt...|$|R

5000|$|As of May 18, 2017, {{the plaintiffs}} scored {{a major victory}} in their lawsuit as a New York State Court has ruled the Jills to be <b>non-exempt</b> <b>employees,</b> not {{independent}} contractors. However, the court denied partial summary judgement {{as to whether the}} Bills themselves were their direct employers, and a jury will decide who the employers were unless a settlement is reached.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{examines}} the determinants and performance consequences of equity grants to senior-level executives, lower-level managers, and <b>non-exempt</b> <b>employees</b> of “new economy” firms. We {{find that the}} determinants of equity grants are significantly different in new versus old economy firms. We also find that employee retention objectives, which new economy firms rank {{as the most important}} goal of their equity grant programs, {{have a significant impact on}} new hire grants, but not subsequent grants. Our exploratory performance tests indicate that lower than expected grants and/or existing holdings of options are associated with poorer performance in subsequent years...|$|R
5000|$|In recent years, {{the term}} [...] "flextime" [...] has {{acquired}} a more controversial definition when used to describe proposals to overhaul the nation's overtime regulations. Under one such proposal by the Bush administration made public on August 5, 2004, employers would {{not be required to}} pay <b>non-exempt</b> <b>employees</b> overtime for working more than 40 hours in a week so long as the employee works no more than 80 hours over a two-week period. For example, a worker could be required to work 70 hours one week and receive no overtime compensation as long as they work 10 hours or less the following week. Such arrangements are opposed by trade unions such as the AFL-CIO.|$|R
50|$|California {{overtime}} laws {{differ from}} federal overtime laws in many respects. Foremost, pursuant to California Labor Code Section 510, <b>non-exempt</b> <b>employees</b> must be compensated at {{one and a}} half times the regular rate of pay for all hours worked in excess of eight hours in a workday, 40 hours in a workweek and the first eight hours of a seventh consecutive workday. Employees in California are entitled to double-time for working more than twelve hour workdays or more than eight hours on the seventh consecutive workday of a single workweek. Under federal law there are only 40 hour weekly overtime limits. This eight hour overtime limit in California frequently gives rise to wage-and-hour litigation for violations of state, but not federal, labour laws.|$|R
5000|$|The {{professional}} staff in local BSA councils consists {{of one or}} more commissioned BSA professionals. Smaller councils usually have three to five professionals, medium-sized councils have six or more professionals, and the largest councils may have 20 or more professionals. All professional Scouters are considered [...] "exempt" [...] employees according to the standards of the Fair Labor Standards Act and are salaried rather than paid by hourly wage. Most councils have a similar number of support staff and camp rangers who are [...] "non-exempt" [...] employees whose duties are very job-specific, limited to standard hours or equivalent labor rules, and paid by hourly wage. The BSA greatly values these <b>non-exempt</b> <b>employees</b> but does not include their positions in the classifications of professional Scouters.|$|R

40|$|When Cobb County School District (District) {{facilities}} are closed due to inclement weather {{or any other}} emergency, employees should not report to work, unless specifically requested to do so. Unsafe driving or facility conditions may make attempts to report to work inappropriate and unadvisable. Twelve-month maintenance and custodial employees as well as certain <b>non-exempt</b> <b>employees</b> specifically contacted by their supervisor should report to work to perform emergency repairs or other duties. All other District employees should not report to work unless directed to do so through either contact by their supervisor or by public announcement. RULE: The District Communications Office will notify local media of school closings, delayed openings and early closings. It will also post this information on the District Web site. Employees are responsible for accessing these information sources whenever there is cause to believe that school is closed, delayed, or closing early. Principals/supervisors are encouraged to establish more direct notification procedures for their faculties/staffs. A.

5000|$|In the United States the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 {{applies to}} {{employees}} in industries engaged in or producing goods for interstate commerce. The FLSA establishes a standard work week of 40 hours for {{certain kinds of}} workers, and mandates payment for overtime hours to those workers of one and one-half times the workers' normal rate of pay for any time worked above 40 hours. The law creates two broad categories of employees, those who are [...] "exempt" [...] from the regulation {{and those who are}} [...] "non-exempt". Under the law, employers are not required to pay exempt employees overtime but must do so for <b>non-exempt</b> <b>employees.</b> Independent contractors are not considered employees and therefore are not protected by the FLSA. Several factors determine whether a worker is an employee, who might be entitled to overtime compensation, or an independent contractor, who would not be so entitled. The employment agreement stating that a party is an independent contractor does not make it necessarily so. The nature of a job determines whether an employee is entitled to overtime pay, not employment status or the field of work.|$|R
40|$|As {{technology}} and employee values continue {{to shape a}} dynamic, growing workplace, managers and organization leaders are faced with new challenges and obstacles in their workplace policy decision-making. Striving for maximized worker productivity and efficient results, many leaders within the business world must alter their managerial approach due to changing workplace expectations. In order to achieve a work culture and management system that promotes profitability, many managers are implementing more autonomous work policies, providing employees greater opportunity to control their methods and hours of work. As the concept of work autonomy becomes more commonplace in the business world, a large effect on both exempt and <b>non-exempt</b> <b>employees</b> may result. What {{are the implications of}} autonomous work policies for employers and employees? This paper explores the many aspects of the results-oriented mindset that many managers and employers maintain as they work to facilitate higher productivity. Despite the constant call for internal growth, managerial decision-making and manager actions towards their employees may ultimately lead to unforeseen legal exposure. This paper effectively combines ma nagement theory with case law review in order to provide managers with a big picture of the growing workplace: a picture that will aid them in making knowledgeable, profitable, and legally responsible decisions when managing their employees...|$|R
40|$|Campuses have {{inquired about}} {{overtime}} payment requirements when <b>non-exempt</b> <b>employees</b> are appointed in multiple concurrent positions or are paid premium payments on an intermittent basis. The {{purpose of this}} memo is to review the requirements and clarify how to determine the “regular rate of pay ” when calculating overtime. Background Information: Collective bargaining agreements for represented employees and California State University (CSU) policy for non-represented employees typically define overtime as authorized time worked in excess of forty (40) hours in a designated workweek period. CSU employees are paid under the state pay plan whereby an employee’s monthly salary is paid {{on the basis of}} 12, nearly equal pay periods each year. The pay period is called a calendar month and contains either 21 or 22 “normal ” workdays (Monday through Friday including holidays during the week). Under the state pay plan, when a monthly rate employee is paid overtime, the hourly rate equivalent is derived by dividing the employment history base monthly salary rate by 173. 33. 1 The hourly rate is then multiplied by the number of overtime hours worked at the overtime factor (e. g., 1. 5 x) to calculate the overtime payment. When an employee receives additional compensation such as a monthly stipend, the stipend is added to the monthly salary rate to derive the regular rate of pay to...|$|R
40|$|Change is {{inevitable}} and can influence numerous events inside and outside an organization. The contrasting attitudes of acceptance and resistance to change are an increasingly interesting topic in today’s global, ever-changing, and competitive environment. Discovering the behavioral origins of employees’ reactions to change {{is an integral part}} of understanding the way in which individual mindset may play a role in coping with organizational change and resistance. This body of knowledge may give organizations insight for creating a competitive advantage over their counterparts. Conceivably, it can be argued that some researchers view change as a process of gradual adaptation that is largely influenced by people in organizations who react to internal and external pressures, while others view it as an emergent event due to environmental selections (Demers, 2007). Through both concepts, successful navigation through change events relies on the manner in which humans respond to these events. The current study employed a descriptive, non-experimental, correlational design to examine individuals’ self-rating of their level of mindfulness, tolerance of ambiguity, and resistance to change in four industries located in Kentucky. The quantitative study sought to identify the strengths of the relationship of the chosen variables using validated instruments – Langer’s (Pirson, Langer, Bodner, 2 ̆ 6 Zilcha-Mano, 2012) Langer Mindfulness Scale (LMS 14), Budner’s (1962) Tolerance of Ambiguity Scale (TOA), and Oreg’s (2003) Resistance to Change Scale (RTC). Regression models were utilized to evaluate multivariate relationships among the variables. Based on the findings in the current study, the results indicated that no differences lie between group comparisons of organizational or demographic factors when examining the relationship among the elements of mindfulness, tolerance of ambiguity, and resistance to change. Bivariate correlations yielded both strong positive and negative relationships among the three scales assessed by salary (exempt and <b>non-exempt)</b> <b>employees</b> located across different industries (p 3 ̆c. 01) ...|$|R
5000|$|Conversely, some {{low-level}} employees (particularly administrative-support staff) {{that had}} previously been classified as exempt were now reclassified as <b>non-exempt.</b> Although such <b>employees</b> work in positions bearing titles previously used to determine exempt status (such as [...] "executive assistant"), the 2004 amendment to the FLSA now requires that an exemption must be predicated upon actual job function and not job title. Employees with job titles that previously allowed exemption but whose job descriptions did not include managerial functions were now reclassified from exempt to non-exempt.|$|R
50|$|During the shutdown, most <b>non-exempt</b> {{government}} <b>employees</b> were furloughed. That {{would have}} put about 800,000 public employees on indefinite unpaid leave starting October 1. The White House estimated that a one-week shutdown could have cost the US economy $10 billion. Key government functions, such as air traffic control, stay active under emergency funding statutes, though other related functions (such as training and support of these services) would be suspended. Some agencies and departments—such as the United States Department of Veterans Affairs and Social Security Administration—are funded by long-term or mandatory appropriations and were also largely unaffected. While veteran and military benefits are funded a year in advance, furloughed civilians had a large impact on the military and their families. Services to families on bases ranging from commissaries to family and survivor counseling were affected. Since the United States Postal Service is self-funded, it was unaffected and continued normal operations.|$|R
