For monohalogenated ethanes, acetaldehyde was the major organic product and little or none of any of the alternate predicted products (2 -halogenated alcohols) were detected. The maximum rate of haloethane oxidation increased with decreasing halogen molecular weight from iodoethane to chloroethane (19 to 221 nmol/min per mg of protein). In addition, the amount of substrate required for the highest rate of haloethane oxidation increased with decreasing halogen molecular weight. For the n-chlorinated alkanes, the rate of dechlorination, as measured by the appearance of the corresponding aldehyde product, was greatest for chloroethane and decreased dramatically for chloropropane and chlorobutane (118, 4, and 8 nmol of aldehyde formed per min per mg of protein, respectively).

Inactivation was not observed {{in the presence of}} allylthiourea, a specific inhibitor of the enzyme ammonia monooxygenase, or under anaerobic conditions, indicating that the TCE-mediated inactivation required ammonia monooxygenase activity. When N. europaea cells were incubated with [14 C]TCE under conditions which allowed turnover of ammonia monooxygenase, a number of cellular proteins were covalently labeled with 14 C. Treatment of cells with allylthiourea or acetylene prior to incubation with [14 C]TCE prevented incorporation of 14 C into proteins. The ammonia-oxidizing activity of cells inactivated in the presence of TCE could be recovered through a process requiring de novo protein synthesis. In addition to TCE, a series of chlorinated methanes, ethanes, and other ethylenes were screened as substrates for ammonia monooxygenase and for their ability to inactivate the ammonia-oxidizing system of N. europaea. The chlorocarbons could be divided into three classes depending on their biodegradability and inactivating potential: (i) compounds which were not biodegradable by N. europaea and which had no toxic effect on the cells; (ii) compounds which were cooxidized by N. europaea and had little or no toxic effect on the cells; and (iii) compounds which were cooxidized and produced a turnover-dependent inactivation of ammonia oxidation by N. europaea...|$|R

Hydrazine, an alternate substrate for HAO, {{was added to the}} reaction mixtures as a source of reductant for AMO. Most inhibitors exhibited competitive or noncompetitive inhibition patterns. The competitive character generally decreased (KiE/KiES increased) as the molecular size of the inhibitors increased. For example, CH 4 and C 2 H 4 were competitive inhibitors of NH 3 oxidation, whereas the remaining alkanes (up to C 4) and monohalogenated (Cl, Br, I) alkanes were noncompetitive. Oxidation of C 2 H 5 Br (noncompetitive) increased as the NH 4 + concentration increased up to 40 mM, whereas oxidations of inhibitors with competitive character (KiE ≪ KiES) were diminished at 40 mM NH 4 +. Multichlorinated compounds produced nonlinear Lineweaver-Burk plots. Iodinated alkanes (CH 3 I, C 2 H 5 I) and C 2 Cl 4 were potent inhibitors of NH 3 oxidation.

NO is found to oxidize either partially or fully reduced HAO, but NO will not reduce ferric HAO. Since NO can be reduced but not oxidized to product by HAO, NO is {{not considered to be}} a long-lived intermediate in the catalytic mechanism. Substrate oxidation occurs in the presence of bound NO or cyanide, suggesting a second interaction site for substrate with HAO and providing a means for recovery of the NO-inhibited form of the enzyme.

The report contains theory round the formation of nitrite and the results from samplings where nitrite concentration was determined. The objective was to increase nitrite conversion and thereby decrease the content of nitrite in the effluent water, by studying the increase of nitrite.   Samplings started in March and no changes in the process where made, the first samples were analyzed to determine where the nitrite accumulation occurred. The samplings were taken in the intermittently aerated basin, wish includes a aerated period and a nonaerated period.   The initial samples showed that nitrite accumulates when there is oxygen in the basin. The content of nitrite decreases when there is no oxygen in the water. The ammonium limits were changed in one basin because it was suspected that the bacteria were becoming stressed by the intermittent aerated start-stop process. This resulted in a longer aerated period for the <b>nitrified</b> <b>bacteria</b> to grow and due to the change it was expected that the bacteria would thrive.

AMO activity was further stimulated in vitro {{by the presence}} of stabilizing agents, including serum albumins, spermine, or MgCl 2. In contrast, the addition of CuCl 2 and stabilizing agents to whole-cell suspensions did not result in any stimulation of AMO activity. The use of the AMO-specific suicide substrate acetylene revealed two populations of AMO in cell extracts. The low, copper-independent (residual) AMO activity was completely inactivated by acetylene in the absence of exogenously added copper. In contrast, the copper-dependent (activable) AMO activity was protected against acetylene inactivation in the absence of copper. However, in the presence of copper both populations of AMO were inactivated by acetylene. [14 C]acetylene labelling of the 27 -kDa polypeptide of AMO revealed the same extent of label incorporation in both whole cells and optimally copper-stimulated cell extracts.
