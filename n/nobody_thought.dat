5|$|Liz Lemon (Tina Fey), {{the head}} {{writer of the}} sketch show TGS with Tracy Jordan, goes back to work {{following}} the summer break and prepares for the show's fifth season. At the 30 Rock building, where she works, Liz and TGS producer Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit) meet their boss, Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) to discuss cutting the show's expenses. During the meeting, Pete reveals that star Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) now has a producer credit because of changes in her contract that were not set to start until the fifth season of TGS (<b>nobody</b> <b>thought</b> that the show would last that long). Jenna takes this role seriously and takes on the job of firing people. Eventually, on reviewing the budget, she realizes that her producer credit is costly—and unnecessary—and asks Pete to fire her.|$|E
25|$|Later {{development}} of the Stelo stagnated. The Universal League founders wanted to show their good will by maintaining a constant value for the Stelo, but their efforts were doomed to failure. The Dutch price of bread gradually increased, but <b>nobody</b> <b>thought</b> to adjust {{the relationship between the}} Stelo and the guilder. The ratio remained four Steloj to the guilder, and bank currency conversion tables were used to fix the value of the Stelo in other countries. Moreover, even the Universal League gave up the idea of recording bookkeeping transactions in Stelo monetary units, so nobody gained experience with a coin of constant value. It is no wonder that the Stelo lost its reputation and that its use even by Esperantists became rare.|$|E
25|$|In 1944, {{with his}} post {{doctoral}} researcher, William von Eggers Doering, Woodward reported {{the synthesis of}} the alkaloid quinine, used to treat malaria. Although the synthesis was publicized as a breakthrough in procuring the hard to get medicinal compound from Japanese occupied southeast Asia, in reality it was too long and tedious to adopt on a practical scale. Nevertheless, it was a landmark for chemical synthesis. Woodward's particular insight in this synthesis was to realise that the German chemist Paul Rabe had converted a precursor of quinine called quinotoxine to quinine in 1905. Hence, a synthesis of quinotoxine (which Woodward actually synthesized) would establish a route to synthesizing quinine. When Woodward accomplished this feat, organic synthesis was still largely a matter of trial and error, and <b>nobody</b> <b>thought</b> that such complex structures could actually be constructed. Woodward showed that organic synthesis could {{be made into a}} rational science, and that synthesis could be aided by well-established principles of reactivity and structure. This synthesis was the first one in a series of exceedingly complicated and elegant syntheses that he would undertake.|$|E

5000|$|In an {{interview}} with Vibe Magazine, Lumidee spoke about signing with TVT Records stating, [...] "TVT Records is the perfect {{way for me to}} come back and again I'm coming out of left field, just like with Never Leave You. <b>Nobody</b> ever <b>thought</b> of me coming back on a street credible label like TVT ... Actually, <b>nobody</b> ever <b>thought</b> of me really even coming back, period." ...|$|R
60|$|Both {{sides were}} glaring at each other. The strain was {{beginning}} to tell, but so far <b>nobody</b> had <b>thought</b> of letting up in the least.|$|R
500|$|After {{returning}} to Grand Rapids in 1946, Ford became active in local Republican politics, and supporters {{urged him to}} take on Bartel J. Jonkman, the incumbent Republican congressman. Military service had changed {{his view of the}} world. [...] "I came back a converted internationalist", Ford wrote, [...] "and of course our congressman at that time was an avowed, dedicated isolationist. And I thought he ought to be replaced. <b>Nobody</b> <b>thought</b> I could win. I ended up winning two to one." ...|$|E
500|$|Michael Douglas won the Academy Award for Best Actor {{and thanked}} Oliver Stone for [...] "casting me {{in a part}} that almost <b>nobody</b> <b>thought</b> I could play". However, Daryl Hannah's {{performance}} was not as well received and earned her a Razzie for Worst Supporting Actress, thus making this the only film to date to win both an Oscar and a Razzie. The [...] "quintessential financial high-roller's attire" [...] of Michael Douglas in the movie, designed by Alan Flusser, was emulated in the 1980s by yuppies.|$|E
500|$|Jane Krakowski, {{who plays}} Jenna Maroney, {{revealed}} to Entertainment Weeklys Michael Ausiello her character's plot in which Jenna becomes a television producer {{as part of}} her contract as TGS begins its fifth season. [...] " [...] has all these wacky things built into her contract , because <b>nobody</b> <b>thought</b> we'd still be on the air. So I get to be a producer." [...] Series producer Paula Pell reprised her role as Paula Hornberger, the wife of Scott Adsit's character Pete Hornberger. The episode references the ongoing storyline of Liz's desire to become a mother when she tells Carol that she is on a waiting list to adopt a child. This story first began in the show's first season, and continued in the third season.|$|E
5000|$|Frank S. Nugent of The New York Times {{wrote that}} the Three Mesquiteers' success was [...] "probably [...] <b>nobody</b> has <b>thought</b> of ambushing them with a Flit gun".|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah," [...] he echoed, [...] "the Shares--as the {{blackbird}} {{said to the}} Cherry Tree. And {{there was}} <b>nobody,</b> you <b>thought,</b> to discuss the letter with? You didn't answer it?" ...|$|R
50|$|European-law {{countries}} with {{a tradition of}} Roman law may also use an expression from Aristotle translated into Latin: nemo censetur ignorare legem (<b>nobody</b> is <b>thought</b> to be ignorant of the law) or ignorantia iuris nocet (not knowing the law is harmful).|$|R
500|$|The pair's first {{appeared}} together on television at the 1994 MTV Video Music Awards, {{in what has}} been described as a [...] "memorable moment". Holding hands, the couple walked onto the stage in New York. In front of a television audience of 250 million, Jackson announced, [...] "Just think, <b>nobody</b> <b>thought</b> this would last", before embracing Presley in a kiss. Afterward, Presley became angered at her husband, feeling he had used her. The male pop singer reasoned that the liplock, which was dubbed [...] "The Kiss of the Century", would be talked about for decades, with people playing the clip over and over. Jackson's attempts at placating his wife proved futile; she told the singer not to [...] "fucking even come near me" [...] and remained angry for several days.|$|E
500|$|Georgia did not {{prepare to}} confront a {{full-scale}} incursion by Russia. Many managerial and procedural issues surfaced during the war. According to a Western military officer, Georgian logistical preparations were mediocre and there was interference between units during the action. Exercises simulating combat against a probable enemy, the 58th Army, had never been organised by the Georgian Army. During the war, communications broke down {{in the mountains and}} troops had to resort to mobile phones. There was insufficient planning; according to Giorgi Tavdgiridze, <b>nobody</b> <b>thought</b> of how to seal the Roki Tunnel. There was a dismal organisation of the delivery of 10,000 Georgian reservists in Gori on 9 August; they had no specific targets and went back to Tbilisi the following day. The conflict was called by journalists as the war [...] "that was hidden from history" [...] because there was very little video recording of military action. According to their American trainers, Georgian soldiers were unprepared for combat despite having [...] "warrior spirit". There were few well-trained, educated officers in high ranking positions, and Saakashvili's government had no military experience.|$|E
500|$|In 1942, {{with the}} {{territory}} around Smolensk under German occupation, captive Polish railroad workers heard from the locals about a mass grave of Polish soldiers at Kozelsk near Katyn; finding one of the graves, they reported it to the Polish Underground State. The discovery was not seen as important, as <b>nobody</b> <b>thought</b> the discovered grave could contain so many victims. In early 1943, Rudolf Christoph Freiherr von Gersdorff, a German officer serving as the intelligence liaison between the Wehrmacht's Army Group Centre and Abwehr, received reports about mass graves of Polish military officers. These reports stated the graves were in the forest of Goat Hill near Katyn. He passed the reports to his superiors (sources vary on when exactly the Germans {{became aware of the}} graves—from [...] "late 1942" [...] to January–February 1943, and when the German top decision makers in Berlin received those reports [...] ). Joseph Goebbels saw this discovery as an excellent tool to drive a wedge between Poland, the Western Allies, and the Soviet Union, and reinforcement for the Nazi propaganda line about the horrors of Bolshevism, and American and British subservience to it. After extensive preparation, on 13 April, Reichssender Berlin broadcast to the world that German military forces in the Katyn forest near Smolensk had uncovered a ditch that was [...] "28metres long and 16metres wide , in which the bodies of 3,000 Polish officers were piled up in 12 layers". The broadcast went on to charge the Soviets with carrying out the massacre in 1940.|$|E
6000|$|... "In old times," [...] said he, [...] "when I {{was a young}} man, <b>nobody</b> ever <b>thought</b> of settin' out on {{any kind}} of sea-voyagin' without havin' a sailor along. The fact is, {{they used to be}} pretty much all sailors." ...|$|R

2500|$|It {{was very}} much a Band of Brothers. [...] Only 37 in the crew and Launders was way ahead in terms of his experience, his knowledge, his abilities; it was obvious to the rest of us. [...] <b>Nobody</b> <b>thought</b> to {{question}} what he decided to do.|$|E
2500|$|Cho began skating {{at the age}} of 3. [...] He {{trained in}} Salt Lake City but moved back to Upper Marlboro, Maryland a year before the U.S. Olympic Trials, {{initially}} quit speed skating after failing to qualify for performance grants from the U.S. Olympic Committee and U.S. Speedskating which would have offset the unaffordable costs of $40,000 for training. [...] About his chances of making the Olympic team, Cho said, [...] "When I say <b>nobody</b> <b>thought</b> I would make the team, literally <b>nobody</b> <b>thought</b> I would make it...Not even me". [...] However, {{at the age of}} 18, Cho qualified for the 2010 U.S. Olympic team. [...] Apolo Ohno noted that Cho [...] "basically made this team training on his own". [...] Cho cites Ohno and Shani Davis as mentors who helped him face challenges as being a person of color in the sport.|$|E
2500|$|Clements {{pointed out}} that [...] "The {{property}} distribution plan at issue in Valley Forge took {{a tremendous amount of}} appropriated funds to run. <b>Nobody</b> <b>thought</b> that was a basis for taxpayer standing. The Bibles that were purchased and the salaries of the teachers in Doremus presumably cost at least a threepence. But that was not found enough." ...|$|E

Nobody! Not the dean in his deanery, or the archdeacon out at Plumstead." ...|$|R
60|$|She was blue-eyed {{and very}} delicately complexioned, quick-moving, witty, given to little storms of clean enthusiasm; she loved {{handsome}} things, brave things, successful things, and {{the respect and}} affection of all the world.

2500|$|On 7 February 2012 noodles {{contaminated}} with radioactive cesium (258 becquerels of cesium per kilogram) {{were found in}} a restaurant in Okinawa. The noodles, called [...] "Okinawa soba", were apparently produced with water filtered through contaminated ashes from wood originating from the prefecture Fukushima. On 10 February 2012 the Japanese Agency for Forestry set out a warning not to use ashes from wood or charcoal, even when the wood itself contained less than the governmental set maximum of 40 becquerels per kilo for wood or 280 becquerels for charcoal. When the standards were set, <b>nobody</b> <b>thought</b> {{about the use of}} the ashes to be used for the production of foods. But, in Japan it was a custom to use ashes when kneading noodles or to take away a bitter taste, or [...] "aku" [...] from [...] "devil's tongue" [...] and wild vegetables.|$|E
2500|$|When Tito died on 4 May 1980, he was {{succeeded by}} a {{presidency}} that rotated annually between the six Republics and two Autonomous [...] Regions. This {{led to a}} fatal weakening of central power and ties between the republics. During the 1980s the republics pursued significantly different economic policies, with separatist- oriented Slovenia and Croatia allowing significant market-based reforms, while Serbia kept to its existing program of state ownership. This, too, was a cause of tension between north and south, as Slovenia in particular experienced a period of strong growth. Prior to the war, inflation skyrocketed. Then, under Prime Minister Ante Markovic, things began to improve. [...] Economic reforms had opened up the country, the living standard was at its peak, capitalism seemed to have entered the country and <b>nobody</b> <b>thought</b> that just a year later the first gunshots would be fired.|$|E
2500|$|I {{remember}} Maurice Garin well. I met him {{and talked}} to him almost every day because {{we lived in the}} same area, 200m from each other, at Lens. Le Père Garin, as my father and grandfather called him used to bring out a chair in fine weather and sit {{in the doorway of the}} little office of the service station he owned at 116 rue de Lille in [...] Lens, under the sign for Antar fuel and oil. My barber was in the neighbouring house and I used to go there once a month to have a crew cut, [...] which was the fashion in those days. My friends and I were aged seven to ten and on our one-speed bikes we used to pin numbers on our back... and we never missed riding past Maurice Garin in a tight group so that he would see. It's strange that <b>nobody</b> <b>thought</b> to take a picture of me, the little kid, alongside the first great champion of the biggest race in the world. But life's like that.|$|E
60|$|The latter {{arranged}} {{their eyes}} and lips to signify that in their opinion <b>nobody</b> could have <b>thought</b> such a thing, whatever it was.|$|R

2500|$|Despite having {{appeared}} {{in over a}} dozen film and television roles, Knightley struggled to get a breakthrough. That changed in 2002, when she starred in Gurinder Chadha's sports comedy film Bend It Like Beckham, which was a smash hit both in the UK and the United States, grossing over $76.6 million. It also surprised film critics who were laudatory of its [...] "charming" [...] and [...] "inspiring" [...] nature, social context and the cast's performances. Knightley and her co-star Parminder Nagra, who played the central roles of aspiring footballers, attracted international attention for their performances in the film. To prepare for their roles, they underwent three months of extensive football training under the English football coach Simon Clifford. Knightley, who was initially skeptical of the project, {{went on to win}} the London Film Critics' Circle for Best Newcomer and the Online Film Critics Society Award for Best Breakthrough Performance. In an interview with Tracy Smith she said, [...] "I remember telling friends I was doing this girls' soccer movie [...] And <b>nobody</b> <b>thought</b> that it was gonna be any good." [...] Film critic James Berardinelli, who was largely laudatory of the film and the [...] "energetic and likable" [...] cast, noted that Knightley and Nagra brought, [...] "a lot of spirit to their instantly likable characters".|$|E
