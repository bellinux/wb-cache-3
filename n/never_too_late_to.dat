25|$|On {{board the}} Jolly Roger, a young Killian is consoled by his father, Brennan, who promised his son {{that he would}} become the person that he was meant to be, only to {{suddenly}} abandon him and his brother, as he sold his sons into servitude, because Brennan was a wanted man and the ship was stolen. Years later in The Enchanted Forest, Regina recruits Hook to kill Cora, and takes Hook to a tavern, where she requires Hook to kill his father, {{who is now the}} tavern's owner. After the tavern closes, Hook confronts Brennan, who explains that his attempt to flee the law failed and was put under a sleeping curse as punishment; Brennan {{fell in love with the}} sound of his nurse's voice and she with him, allowing a kiss to wake him. They married, but she died soon after having their son, who was named after Liam, to honor his memory. Believed that Brennan has changed, Hook has to make it look like he had his father killed, so he can help his father and Liam escape. When Hook follows Brennan back to his home, he watches him with Liam, and witnesses his father tells Liam the same things he told Hook when he was little, which makes Hook very enraged, thinking that his father lied about having changed. When Brennan goes outside to meet Hook, he takes back his offer, and despite Brennan's insistence that he had changed, Hook kills Brennan, making Hook the person he is now. As Brennan dies, however, he tells Hook that it's <b>never</b> <b>too</b> <b>late</b> <b>to</b> change, to become a better man.|$|E
500|$|The book {{is divided}} into five {{sections}} and sixteen chapters. Each chapter is written {{from the perspective of}} one of the two authors; nine are by Eric, while Leslie writes seven, as well as the introduction. The first section, [...] "Desiring a Love Story", addresses sexual desire and lovesickness, suggesting that temporary relationships cannot fulfill those longings. Section Two, [...] "Preparing for a Love Story", advances ways in which one might, before initiating a romantic relationship, develop the characteristics of a good spouse. The next section, [...] "Waiting for a Love Story", discusses the practice of fidelity to one's future spouse before meeting them by way of sexual abstinence and argues that waiting indefinitely is worth it even if one's soulmate never arrives. In the fourth section, [...] "Sweetening a Love Story", the Ludys provide advice on how to proceed once the possibility of a romantic relationship has presented itself. The final section, [...] "Discovering a God-written Love Story", argues that it is <b>never</b> <b>too</b> <b>late</b> <b>to</b> give God control of one's love life, and that this sacrifice should be made not in expectation of personal benefit but rather to benefit one's future spouse and to honor God.|$|E

2500|$|The {{relationship}} cooled in 1874 amid Godwin's {{preoccupation with}} his architectural practice and financial difficulties. However, even after their 1875 separation, Godwin continued to design Terry's costumes {{when she returned}} to the stage. [...] In 1874 Terry played in a number of roles in Charles Reade's works: Philippa Chester in The Wandering Heir; Susan Merton in It's <b>Never</b> <b>Too</b> <b>Late</b> <b>to</b> Mend; and Helen Rolleston in Our Seamen. That same year she performed at the Crystal Palace with Charles Wyndham as Volante in The Honeymoon by John Tobin and as Kate Hardcastle in She Stoops to Conquer by Oliver Goldsmith.|$|E
2500|$|Before Ellie died, {{she left}} a piece of advice for Peyton {{regarding}} Peyton's love life, telling her that it is <b>never</b> <b>too</b> <b>late</b> <b>to</b> pursue her romantic interest. Peyton decides to give love another try and dates Pete Wentz from Fall Out Boy. Their relationship does not work out, since Pete is busy with touring. Peyton's father tells her to follow her heart and listen to it, so Peyton, considering Ellie's advice as well, decides to give Jake a visit in Savannah; she knows that she still loves him and feels {{that this will be}} enough for her to be happy. She renews her relationship with Jake and Jenny, and even goes far enough to propose marriage to Jake, who gladly accepts. This happiness fades once Jake overhears Peyton say, [...] "I love you, Lucas" [...] in her sleep. Peyton is then forced to confront Jake about the kiss she and Lucas shared {{on the day of the}} shooting. Jake figures that while Peyton loves him, she is in love with Lucas. He tells her to go back to Tree Hill, and to find out if Lucas is still in her heart. If he is not, Jake promises to still be there waiting. Peyton does as Jake has advised. In the finale, Brooke once again ends her friendship with Peyton after Peyton tells her that she still has romantic feelings for Lucas. Lucas later tells Brooke about the kiss in the library. At the end of the episode, Peyton burns pictures of herself with Brooke. She then picks up a picture of the three of them (herself, Brooke and Lucas) and burns it.|$|E

50|$|<b>Never</b> <b>Too</b> <b>Late</b> {{began her}} three-year-old {{season in the}} Prix Imprudence at Maisons-Laffitte Racecourse, which she won impressively by four lengths from Paola. The filly was then sent to England to contest the 1000 Guineas over Newmarket's Rowley Mile. Ridden by Roger Poincelet she started 8/11 {{favourite}} against thirteen opponents. She took the lead a furlong from the finish and won easily by two lengths from Lady In Trouble and Running Blue. <b>Never</b> <b>Too</b> <b>Late</b> returned <b>to</b> Britain a month later and started 6/5 favourite. The finish of the race was rough and controversial. Poincelet held the favourite up towards {{the back of the}} field, and struggled to obtain a clear run before making his challenge on the outside in the straight. As she moved up to the French-trained leader Paimpont, <b>Never</b> <b>Too</b> <b>Late</b> hung <b>to</b> the left and blocked the run of a third French filly, Imberline. <b>Never</b> <b>Too</b> <b>Late</b> caught Paimpont in the closing strides and won by a head, with Imberline an apparently unlucky third. After the race, Poincelet alleged that some of the British jockeys had deliberately hampered his progress on three separate occasions, while Etienne Pollet claimed that the filly would have won by six lengths with a clear run.|$|R
50|$|In September, <b>Never</b> <b>Too</b> <b>Late</b> {{ran in the}} Prix Vermeille at Longchamp.

6000|$|My own {{motive for}} {{opposing}} {{the bill is}} founded on its palpable injustice, and its certain inefficacy. I have seen the state of these miserable men, {{and it is a}} disgrace to a civilized country. Their excesses may be condemned, but cannot be subject of wonder. The effect of the present bill would be to drive them into actual rebellion. The few words I shall venture to offer on Thursday will be founded upon these opinions formed from my own observations on the spot. By previous inquiry, I am convinced these men would have been restored to employment, and the county to tranquillity. It is, perhaps, not yet <b>too</b> <b>late,</b> and is surely worth the trial. It can <b>never</b> be <b>too</b> <b>late</b> <b>to</b> employ force in such circumstances. I believe your Lordship does not coincide with me entirely on this subject, and most cheerfully and sincerely shall I submit to your superior judgment and experience, and take some other line of argument against the bill, or be silent altogether, should you deem it more advisable. Condemning, as every one must condemn, the conduct of these wretches, I believe in the existence of grievances which call rather for pity than punishment.

I kept the tightest hand over her that I could. I advised her, argued with her, ordered her, portioned out her time for her, watched her, warned her, told her in the plainest terms, that she should not deceive me--she or her gentleman! I was honest and open, and said I disapproved so strongly of the terms she kept up with Mr. Carr, that if ever it lay {{in my power to}} cut short their acquaintance together, I would most assuredly do it. I even told her plainly that if she once got into mischief, it would then be <b>too</b> <b>late</b> <b>to</b> reclaim her; and she answered in her reckless, sluttish way, that if she ever did get into mischief it would be nothing but my aggravation that would drive her to it; and that she believed her father's kindness would <b>never</b> find it <b>too</b> <b>late</b> <b>to</b> reclaim her again. This is only one specimen of the usual insolence and wickedness of all her replies to me." ...|$|R

6000|$|At this, the clergyman {{shook his}} head, [...] "Sir," [...] said he, [...] "pray {{tell him it}} is not too late; Christ will give him repentance, if he has {{recourse}} to the merit of his passion. Does he think he is beyond the power of Divine mercy? There may indeed be a time when provoked mercy will no longer strive, but <b>never</b> <b>too</b> <b>late</b> for men <b>to</b> repent in this world." [...] I told Atkins every word the priest had said, who then parted from us to walk with his wife, while we discoursed with the rest. But these were very stupid in religious matters; yet all of them promised to do their endeavours to make their wives turn Christians; and upon which promises the priest married the three couple. But as Atkins was the only sincere convert and of more sense than the rest, my clergyman was earnestly inquiring after him: [...] "Sir," [...] said he, [...] "let us walk out of this labyrinth, & I dare say we shall find this poor man preaching to his wife already." [...] And indeed we found it true; for coming {{to the edge of the}} wood, we perceived Atkins and his savage wife sitting under the shade of a bush, in very earnest discourse; he pointed to the sun, to the quarters of the earth, to himself, to her, the woods, and the trees. Immediately we could perceive him start upon his feet, fall down upon his knees, and lift up both his hands; at which the tears ran down my clergyman's cheeks; but our great misfortune was, we could not hear one word that passed between them. Another time he would embrace her, wiping the tears from her eyes, kissing her with the greatest transports, and then both kneel down for some minutes together. Such raptures of joy did this confirm in my young priest, that he could scarcely contain himself: And a little after this, we observed by her motion, as frequently lifting up her hands, and laying them on her breast, that she was mightily affected with his discourse, and so they withdrew from our sight.|$|R
