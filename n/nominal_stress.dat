40|$|The maximum von Mises {{stress is}} {{calculated}} for solid {{finite element models}} of splined shafts with straight-sided teeth. One spline shaft is stepped with larger diameter section containing spline teeth and the smaller diameter section circular and cylindrical with no spline teeth. A second shaft is not stepped, but contains incomplete spline teeth. Finite element analyses are performed for the cases of a stepped shaft of three different step size ratios (d/D). The second set of models consists of a solid cylindrical shaft with incomplete spline teeth. The incomplete regions of the spline teeth are modeled in three radii (R). Bending, torsion, and combined loads are applied to each model, including several combinations of bending and torsion between pure bending and pure torsion. Finite element stress results are converged to within 2 % for verification.

50|$|A material's {{strength}} {{is dependent on}} its microstructure. The engineering processes to which a material is subjected can alter this microstructure. The variety of strengthening mechanisms that alter {{the strength of a}} material includes work hardening, solid solution strengthening, precipitation hardening and grain boundary strengthening and can be quantitatively and qualitatively explained. Strengthening mechanisms are accompanied by the caveat that some other mechanical properties of the material may degenerate in an attempt to make the material stronger. For example, in grain boundary strengthening, although yield {{strength is}} maximized with decreasing grain size, ultimately, very small grain sizes make the material brittle. In general, the yield strength of a material is an adequate indicator of the material's mechanical strength. Considered in tandem {{with the fact that the}} yield strength is the parameter that predicts plastic deformation in the material, one can make informed decisions on how to increase the strength of a material depending its microstructural properties and the desired end effect. Strength is expressed in terms of the limiting values of the compressive stress, tensile stress, and shear stresses that would cause failure. The effects of dynamic loading are probably the most important practical consideration of the strength of materials, especially the problem of fatigue. Repeated loading often initiates brittle cracks, which grow until failure occurs. The cracks always start at stress concentrations, especially changes in cross-section of the product, near holes and corners at <b>nominal</b> <b>stress</b> levels far lower than those quoted for the strength of the material.|$|E

40|$|This study {{concerns}} the behaviour of the closed stiffener (trough) to crossbeam connection in orthotropic steel bridge decks and in particular, the connection where a continuous closed stiffener {{passes through the}} crossbeam. For this connection, the crossbeam in-plane and out-of-plane behaviour is analysed. The <b>nominal</b> <b>stresses</b> for unit loads on the crossbeam, unit rotations of the connection and the deck bending are determined for locations that are relevant for fatigue. For these locations, the geometrical stress concentration factors are also determined. Traffic loads for fatigue from ENV 1991 - 3 (EN 1991 - 2) are simulated by maximum crossbeam load, connection rotation and deck bending moment intervals with equivalent numbers of cycles. By applying geometrical stress concentration factors to the <b>nominal</b> <b>stresses</b> the geometrical stresses are obtained. By scaling these geometrical stresses of the unit loads, rotations and deck bending moments, the resulting geometrical stress intervals are used for a fatigue assessment of an example crossbeam with three different types of connections: - Closed stiffener through a cut-out with a cope hole, - Closed stiffener through a close fitting cut-out, - Closed stiffener fitted between the crossbeams. The restraints generated by local bending in the deck and torsion in the closed stiffeners are analysed separately. The results of the calculations obtained by analytical models and FE models, are compared with measurements.

40|$|The recent {{demand for}} {{architectural}} transparency has drastically increased {{the use of}} glass material for structural purpose. However, connections between structural glass members represent {{one of the most}} critical aspects of glass engineering, due to the fragile behaviour of this material. In that respect, research activities on adhesive point-fixings are currently on-going. The mechanical behaviour of adhesive point-fixings is affected by large nonlinearities, which are usually investigated by nonlinear Finite Element Analysis (FEA). This paper focuses on the geometrical and the material nonlinearities of adhesive point-fixings for glass structures. Firstly, the nonlinear material behaviour of two selected adhesives are investigated by means of uniaxial tension and compression tests on the bulk material. The production of specimens, test methodology and displacement rate dependency are discussed. Secondly, the nonlinear stress distribution occurring in the adhesive and the joint stiffness is investigated by means of nonlinear FEA. The effects of several parameters on the mechanical behaviour of adhesive point-fixings, such as the connection dimensions and adhesive elastic properties, are studied. The adhesive stress-strain curves resulting from the experimental campaign show that the adhesives exhibit a large nonlinear behaviour. The results show that the stress and strain at failure reduce as the displacement rate is reduced. From the numerical investigations it is concluded that large nonlinearity involves the mechanical behaviour of adhesive point-fixing which cannot be neglected. The stress distribution within the adhesive deviates from uniform <b>nominal</b> <b>stresses,</b> even in case of simple load condition, with stress peaks up to four times higher than <b>nominal</b> <b>stresses.</b> </span...|$|R

After developing a bespoke FS welding technology suitable for joining aluminium tubes, some one hundred welded tubular specimens of Al 6082 -T 6 were tested under pure axial, pure torsional and biaxial tension-torsion loading. The influence was explored of two independent variables, namely the proportional or nonproportional nature of the biaxial loading {{and the effect of}} axial and torsional non-zero mean stresses.
