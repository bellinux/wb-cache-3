5000|$|<b>Nebracetam</b> is an {{investigational drug}} of the racetam family {{that is a}} M1 {{acetylcholine}} receptor agonist in rats. [...] Its effects in humans have not been studied.|$|E
50|$|There is no universally {{accepted}} {{mechanism of action}} for racetams. Racetams generally show negligible affinity for common central nervous system receptors, but modulation of central neurotransmitters, including acetylcholine and glutamate, has been reported. Although aniracetam and <b>nebracetam</b> show affinity for muscarinic receptors, only nefiracetam demonstrates nanomolar interactions. Modification of membrane-located mechanisms of central signal transduction is another hypothesis.|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} delayed {{treatment}} with <b>nebracetam,</b> a novel nootropic drug, on neurotransmitters of brain regions {{were examined in}} rats with microsphere embolism-induced cerebral ischaemia. Cerebral ischaemia was induced by administration of 900 microspheres (48 [*]μm) into the internal carotid artery. The rats with stroke-like symptoms were treated p. o. with 30 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 <b>nebracetam</b> twice daily. The levels of acetylcholine, dopamine, noradrenaline, 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT) and their metabolites in the cerebral cortex, striatum and hippocampus of animals with microsphere embolism were determined by high performance liquid chromatography (h. p. l. c.) on the 3 rd and 7 th days after the operation. Although the microsphere embolism induced significant changes {{in most of the}} neurotransmitters and some of their metabolites in the brain regions, the delayed treatment with <b>nebracetam</b> partially restored only the hippocampal 5 -HT and the striatal dopamine metabolite contents on the 3 rd day. The hippocampal in vivo 5 -HT synthesis, but not the striatal dopamine synthesis, was attenuated in rats with microsphere embolism on the 3 rd day, but was restored by treatment with <b>nebracetam.</b> In vivo striatal dopamine turnover rate of the rats with microsphere embolism was inhibited on the 3 rd day irrespective of treatment with <b>nebracetam.</b> The present study provides evidence for a possible action of <b>nebracetam</b> on 5 -HT metabolism in the ischaemic brain...|$|E
40|$|As {{part of a}} {{research}} program aiming at the design, synthesis and pharmacological evaluation of a novel lead-candidates of neuroactive compounds, we describe herein the synthesis and the central profile of a new <b>nebracetam</b> analog having a 2 -aza-bicyclo[3. 3. 0]octane system. The new derivative, designed {{on the basis of}} the conformational restriction concept, was synthesized in good yields exploring a diastereoselective reductive-amination and cyclization one-pot sequence. The pharmacological profile of this new compound, investigated by using path-clamp techniques on neurons of the CNS, indicated no effects on these cells...|$|E
