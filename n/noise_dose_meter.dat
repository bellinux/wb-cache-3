40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this study is to {{determine}} noise exposure among grass cutters. Eighteen grass cutters were monitored for 8 hours each, using the <b>Noise</b> <b>dose</b> <b>meter.</b> The workers were exposed to noise levels ranging from 84. 3 dB(A) to 92. 3 dB(A), TWA (mean 88. 0 dB(A). The Lmax value ranged from 100. 4 dB(A) to 126. 5 dB(A) (mean 109. 5 dB(A)). 27. 8 % workers exceeded the permissible level 90 dB(A), and 83. 3 % exceeded the action level 85 dB(A). Audiometric test for both ears showed some evidence of mild to moderate hearing impairment in some workers (5 out of 18). This study revealed that some workers were exposed to excessive noise level and were at risk of acquiring noise induced hearing loss...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the combined effects of noise and shift work on physiological parameters including body temperature, heart rate and blood pressure. This study was performed in a chemical industry in Tehran in 1993. The workers’ physiological parameters was recorded at the beginning {{and at the end of}} all work shifts. Groups under study included : day workers (n= 115), day workers with continuous noise exposure (n= 44), two-shift workers without noise exposure (n= 180), three-shift workers without noise exposure and three-shift workers with continous noise exposure (n= 216). In workers with continuous noise exposure, noise dosimetry was performed using B & K <b>noise</b> <b>dose</b> <b>meter</b> type 4428. The results showed that noise and shift work hove more effects on systolic and diastolic blood pressure than body temperature. The statistical analysis showed that in 3 -shift workers, combined effects of noise and shift work on systolic and diastolic blood pressure caused considerable differences between exposed and control group. In general, regarding research design of this study to determine probable combined effects of noise and shiftwork on physiological parameters, our findings confirmed the additive effects of noise and shiftwork on systolic and diastolic blood pressure in which the effect of noise was more significant. Our findings showed that combined exposure to shiftwork and noise may be regarded as a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases because it is responsible for increasing blood pressure in exposed workers...|$|E
40|$|Most {{countries}} have guidelines to regulate sound exposure at concerts and music festivals. These guidelines limit the allowed sound pressure levels and the concert/festival’s duration. In Norway, {{where there is}} such a guideline, {{it is up to the}} local authorities to impose the regulations. The need to prevent hearing-loss among festival participants is self-explanatory, but knowledge of the actual dose received by visitors is extremely scarce. This study looks at two Norwegian music festivals where only one was regulated by the Norwegian guideline for concert and music festivals. At each festival the sound exposure of four participants was monitored with <b>noise</b> <b>dose</b> <b>meters.</b> This study compared the exposures experienced at the two festivals, and tested them against the Norwegian guideline and the World Health Organization’s recommendations. Sound levels during the concerts were higher at the festival not regulated by any guideline, and levels there exceeded both the national and the Worlds Health Organization’s recommendations. The results also show that front-of-house measurements reliably predict participant exposure...|$|R

This study′s aim {{was to examine the}} associations between noise exposure during sleep, and sleep variables derived from actigraphy among seamen on board vessels in the Royal Norwegian Navy (RNoN). Data were collected on board 21 RNoN vessels, where navy seamen participated by wearing an actiwatch (actigraph), and by completing a questionnaire comprising information on gender, age, coffee drinking, nicotine use, use of medication, and workload. <b>Noise</b> <b>dose</b> <b>meters</b> were used to assess noise exposure inside the seamen′s cabin during sleep. Eighty-three sleep periods from 68 seamen were included in the statistical analysis. Linear mixed-effects models were used to examine the association between noise exposure and the sleep variables percentage mobility during sleep and sleep efficiency, respectively. Noise exposure variables, coffee drinking status, nicotine use status, and sleeping hours explained 24. 9 % of the total variance in percentage mobility during sleep, and noise exposure variables explained 12. 0 % of the total variance in sleep efficiency. Equivalent noise level and number of noise events per hour were both associated with increased percentage mobility during sleep, and the number of noise events was associated with decreased sleep efficiency...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that collegiate level music {{students}} are exposed to potentially hazardous sound levels. Compared to professional musicians, collegiate level music students typically do not perform as frequently, but they are exposed to intense sounds during practice and rehearsal sessions. The {{purpose of the study was}} to determine the full-day exposure dose including individual practice and ensemble rehearsals for collegiate student musicians. Sixty-seven college students of classical music were recruited representing 17 primary instruments. Of these students, 57 completed 2 days of <b>noise</b> <b>dose</b> measurements using Cirrus doseBadge programed according to the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health criterion. Sound exposure was measured for 2 days from morning to evening, ranging from 7 to 9 h. Twenty-eight out of 57 (49 %) student musicians exceeded a 100 % daily <b>noise</b> <b>dose</b> on at least 1 day of the two measurement days. Eleven student musicians (19 %) exceeded 100 % daily <b>noise</b> <b>dose</b> on both days. Fourteen students exceeded 100 % dose during large ensemble rehearsals and eight students exceeded 100 % dose during individual practice sessions. Approximately, half of the student musicians exceeded 100 % <b>noise</b> <b>dose</b> on a typical college schedule. This finding indicates that a large proportion of collegiate student musicians are at risk of developing noise-induced hearing loss due to hazardous sound levels.

40|$|BACKGROUND The <b>metered</b> <b>dose</b> inhaler is {{difficult}} to use correctly, synchronising actuation with inhalation being the most important problem. A breath actuated pressurised inhaler, designed to help patients with poor inhaler technique, was compared with a conventional <b>metered</b> <b>dose</b> inhaler in terms of aerosol deposition and bronchodilator response. METHODS Radioaerosol deposition and bronchodilator response to 100 micrograms salbutamol were measured in 18 asthmatic patients, who inhaled from a conventional <b>metered</b> <b>dose</b> inhaler by their own chosen <b>metered</b> <b>dose</b> inhaler technique, from a conventional <b>metered</b> <b>dose</b> inhaler by a taught <b>metered</b> <b>dose</b> inhaler technique, and from a breath actuated pressured inhaler (Autohaler). RESULTS In the 10 patients who could coordinate actuation and inhalation of the inhaler on their own deposition of aerosol in the lungs and bronchodilator response were equivalent on the three study days. By contrast, in the eight patients who could not coordinate the mean (SEM) percentage of the dose deposited in the lungs with their own inhaler technique (7. 2 % (3. 4 %] was substantial lower than those attained by the taught <b>metered</b> <b>dose</b> inhaler technique (22. 8 % (2. 5 %] and by Autohaler (20. 8 % (1. 7 %]. CONCLUSION Although of little additional benefit to asthmatic patients with good coordination, the Autohaler is potentially a valuable aid to those with poor coordination, and {{should be considered in}} preference to a conventional <b>metered</b> <b>dose</b> inhaler in any patient whose inhaler technique is not known to be satisfactory...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the aerosol-release time in the development of a new automatic adapter for <b>metered</b> <b>dose</b> inhaler. With this device, regular manually operated <b>metered</b> <b>dose</b> inhalers become automatic. During the study, an inhalation simulator was designed and tested with the newly developed mechatronic system. By adjusting the volume and the pressure of the vacuum tank, most human inhalation waveforms were able to simulate. As an example, regular quick-deep and slow-deep waveforms were matched within reasonable accuracy. Finally, with the help of dynamic image processing, the aerosol-release time (Tr) was carefully measured and fully discussed, including the switch-on time (Ts), the mechatronics-hysteresis (Tm) and the intentional-delay (Ti). Under slow-deep inhalation condition which is suitable for <b>metered</b> <b>dose</b> inhaler medicine delivery, the switch-on flow-rate could reach as low as 10 [*]L/min, and the corresponding switch-on time was approximately 0. 20 [*]s. While the mechatronics-hysteresis depended on the brand of <b>metered</b> <b>dose</b> inhaler, assuming there was no intentional-delay, the aerosol-release time could be as low as 0. 40 and 0. 60 [*]s, respectively, for two commercially available <b>metered</b> <b>dose</b> inhalers studied in this article.

In {{order to determine the}} framing inside the law limits sound levels and the doses inside and outside a metallic confections plant hall were measured. Data Logging Sound Meter 840013 was used to determine the noise level and the data was processed with SE 322 and a Personal Noise Dosimeter to determine the <b>noise</b> <b>dose</b> and the data was processed dBLink 3. Regarding the sound level, it was seen that inside plant hall, the legal limits of 70 dB were exceeded by 20. 3 dB, and outside, near the plant hall, they were higher by 2. 8 dB. The values of these sound levels go down with the distances increase, so at 20 m from the plant hall, the values are between the normal limits. The measured doses were 528 % of the accepted level (indoor for 4 h of measurements), while the estimated dose for 8 hours is 951 % and respectively 265 % of the accepted level (outdoor for 4 h of measurements) while the estimated dose for 8 hours is 480 %. After these measurements were proposed a soundproofing of the hall and also the use of the earplugs by workers and installed wood panels between work teams, so that the workers would not hear noise except when they produce it themselves (and not by other work fellows) ...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: In {{the steel}} industry,air blowers used to supply {{compressed}} air are considered {{as sources of}} annoying noise. This study aims to acoustics analysis of theairblower workroomand sound source characteristics in order to present noise controlmeasuresinthe steel industry.. Material and Method: Measurement of noiselevel and its frequency analysis was performed usingsound levelmetermodelof CASELLA-Cell. 450. Distribution of noise level in the investigated workroom in form of noise map was provided using Surfer software. In addition, acoustic analysis of workroom and control room was performed in view point of soundabsorption andinsulation. Redesignofdoor and window of controlroom and installation of soundabsorbing materialson theceiling of the workroom were proposed and the efficiency of these interventionswasestimated.. Result: The totalsound pressurelevelin the blower workroom was 95. 4 dB(L) and the dominant frequency was 2000 Hz. Sound pressure level inside the room control was 80. 1 dB(A). The average absorption coefficient and reverberation time in the blower workroom was estimated equal to 0. 082 Sab. m 2 and 3. 9 seconds respectively. These value in control room was 0. 04 Sab. m 2 and 3 / 4 seconds respectively. In control room, sound transmission loss between the {{two parts of the}} wall dividing was 13. 7 dB(A). The average of <b>noise</b> <b>dose</b> in blower operators was 230 %.

This included also measurements on the dose contribution of secondary neutrons. Systematic data on the neutron dose behind a water target were obtained in previous measurements[1], using a WENDI-II neutron dose meter[2]. Recent studies on carbon fragmentation[3, 4] have shown that more charged particels than neutrons emerge from the target at small forward angles. At 0 ◦, the ratio of He- to H-fragments to neutrons is about 2. 6 : 1. 2 : 1.

MIRE and manikin techniques are applied. The uncertainties from different sources are estimated for a determination of the diffuse-field related equivalent continuous A-weighted SPL from an earphone. There is a worldwide rapid increase {{in the use of}} call centers with headset phone operators for quick satisfaction of consumer demand. Operator’s exposure to noise from communication headsets above specified limits can result in permanent hearing loss. Therefore measurement and monitoring <b>noise</b> <b>dose</b> for the operator is necessary. Exposure noise levels can be very different for the same headphone used by different operator, depending on head geometry, acoustic impedance of the ear, position of the headphone, etc. The <b>noise</b> <b>dose</b> of the operator depends not only on the type of headphone, but also on the ambient noise in the working place, including lay-out of the room, distance between operators, acoustic characteristics of the working place, quality of the headset, maintenance and volume of the headphone.

The correlation of CBF values of H 215 O PET (49. 2 ± 5. 4 [*]mL per 100 [*]g per minute) and those of 125 I-IMP autoradiography (49. 1 ± 5. 2 [*]mL per 100 [*]g per minute) was excellent (y= 1. 01 x− 0. 37, r 2 = 0. 97). The H 215 O steady-state method with a continuously increasing injection is useful for CBF measurement in small animal studies, especially when multiple scans are required in the same animal...|$|R
