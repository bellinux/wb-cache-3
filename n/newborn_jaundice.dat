50|$|After delivery, plastic wraps or warm {{mattresses}} {{are useful}} {{to keep the}} infant warm {{on their way to}} the NICU. In developed countries premature infants are usually cared for in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). The physicians who specialize in the care of very sick or premature babies are known as neonatologists. In the NICU, premature babies are kept under radiant warmers or in incubators (also called isolettes), which are bassinets enclosed in plastic with climate control equipment designed to keep them warm and limit their exposure to germs. Modern neonatal intensive care involves sophisticated measurement of temperature, respiration, cardiac function, oxygenation, and brain activity. Treatments may include fluids and nutrition through intravenous catheters, oxygen supplementation, mechanical ventilation support, and medications. In developing countries where advanced equipment and even electricity may not be available or reliable, simple measures such as kangaroo care (skin to skin warming), encouraging breastfeeding, and basic infection control measures can significantly reduce preterm morbidity and mortality.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The serum or plasma total {{bilirubin}} concentration (B(T)) {{has long been}} the standard clinical laboratory test for evaluating neonatal jaundice, despite studies showing that B(T) correlates poorly with acute bilirubin encephalopathy (ABE) and its sequelae including death, classical kernicterus, or bilirubin-induced neurological dysfunction (BIND). The poor correlation between B(T) and ABE is commonly attributed to the confounding effects of comorbidities such as hemolytic diseases, prematurity, asphyxia, or infection. Mounting evidence suggests, however, that B(T) inherently performs poorly because it is the plasma non-protein-bound (unbound or free) bilirubin concentration (B(f)), rather than B(T), that is more closely associated with central nervous system bilirubin concentrations and therefore ABE and its sequelae. CONTENT: This article reviews (a) the complex relationship between serum or plasma bilirubin measurements and ABE, (b) the history underlying the limited use of B(f) in the clinical setting, (c) the peroxidase method for measuring B(f) and technical and other issues involved in adapting the measurement to routine clinical use, (d) clinical experience using B(f) in the management of <b>newborn</b> <b>jaundice,</b> and (e) the value of B(f) measurements in research investigating bilirubin pathochemistry.

Therefore, we aimed to compare the oxidant and antioxidant status of hyperbilirubinemic newborns {{before and after the}} phototherapy. Methods: Twenty-nine newborns (16 male, 13 female) exposed to phototherapy with the diagnosis of indirect hyperbilirubinemia were included in the study. The serum total antioxidant capacity, total oxidative stress and oxidative stress index levels were measured before and after the phototherapy. Results: The newborn infants were 38. 5 ± 0. 7 (38 - 40) weeks of gestation and had birth weight of 3108. 2 ± 341. 6 (2500 - 3800) grams. The mean mother age was 26. 5 ± 5 (16 - 36) years. The mean hospitalization duration was 4. 4 ± 1. 9 (2 - 7) days and the mean phototherapy duration was 1. 52 ± 0. 6 (1 - 3) days. There was no statistically significant relation between gestation week, birth weight and total antioxidant levels (p˃ 0. 05) but the oxidative stress levels was significantly higher with longer hospitalization (p= 0. 047). Both total antioxidant capacity and total oxidative stress levels were low and statistically insignificant (P< 0. 001) and {{there was no significant difference}} for oxidative stress index levels.

40|$|Hyperbilirubinaemia is a {{ubiquitous}} transitional morbidity in {{the vast}} majority of newborns and a leading cause of hospitalisation in the first week of life worldwide. While timely and effective phototherapy and exchange transfusion are well proven treatments for severe neonatal hyperbilirubinaemia, inappropriate or ineffective treatment of hyperbilirubinaemia, at secondary and tertiary hospitals, still prevails in many poorly-resourced countries accounting for a disproportionately high burden of bilirubin-induced mortality and long-term morbidity. As part of the efforts to curtail the widely reported risks of frequent but avoidable bilirubin-induced neurologic dysfunction (acute bilirubin encephalopathy (ABE) and kernicterus) in low and middle-income countries (LMICs) with significant resource constraints, this article presents a practical framework for the management of late-preterm and term infants (>= 35 weeks of gestation) with clinically significant hyperbilirubinaemia in these countries particularly where local practice guidelines are lacking. Standard and validated protocols were followed in adapting available evidence-based national guidelines on the management of hyperbilirubinaemia through a collaboration among clinicians and experts on <b>newborn</b> <b>jaundice</b> from different world regions. Tasks and resources required for the comprehensive management of infants with or at risk of severe hyperbilirubinaemia at all levels of healthcare delivery are proposed, covering primary prevention, early detection, diagnosis, monitoring, treatment, and follow-up. Additionally, actionable treatment or referral levels for phototherapy and exchange transfusion are proposed within the context of several confounding factors such as widespread exclusive breastfeeding, infections, blood group incompatibilities and G 6 PD deficiency, which place infants at high risk of severe hyperbilirubinaemia and bilirubin-induced neurologic dysfunction in LMICs, as well as the limited facilities for clinical investigations and inconsistent functionality of available phototherapy devices. the need to adjust these levels as appropriate depending on the available facilities in each clinical setting and the risk profile of the infant is emphasised with a view to avoiding over-treatment or under-treatment. These recommendations should serve as a valuable reference material for health workers, guide the development of contextually-relevant national guidelines in each LMIC, as well as facilitate effective advocacy and mobilisation of requisite resources for the optimal care of infants with hyperbilirubinaemia at all levels.

Most <b>jaundice</b> is benign, {{but because of}} the {{potential}} toxicity of bilirubin, newborn infants must be monitored to identify those who might develop severe hyperbili-rubinemia and, in rare cases, acute bilirubin encephalop-athy or kernicterus. The focus of this guideline is to reduce the incidence of severe hyperbilirubinemia and bilirubin encephalopathy while minimizing the risks of unintended harm such as maternal anxiety, decreased breastfeeding, and unnecessary costs or treatment. Al-though kernicterus should almost always be prevent-able, cases continue to occur. These guidelines provide a framework for the prevention and management of hyperbilirubinemia in newborn infants of 35 or more weeks of gestation. In every infant, we recommend tha...|$|R
50|$|In phototherapy, {{blue light}} is {{typically}} used {{because it is}} more effective at breaking down bilirubin (Amato, Inaebnit, 1991). Two matched groups of <b>newborn</b> infants with <b>jaundice</b> were exposed to intensive green or blue light phototherapy. The efficiency of the treatment was measured by the rate of decline of serum bilirubin, which in excessive amounts causes jaundice, concentration after 6, 12 and 24 hours of light exposure. A more rapid response was obtained using the blue lamps than the green lamps. However, a shorter phototherapy recovery period was noticed in babies exposed to the green lamps(1). Green light is not commonly used because exposure time must be longer to see dramatic results.|$|R
50|$|When {{hyperbilirubinemia}} increases past a mild level, {{it leads}} to jaundice, raising the risk of progressing to kernicterus. When this happens in adults, it is usually because of liver problems. Newborns are especially vulnerable to hyperbilirubinemia-induced neurological damage, because in {{the earliest days of}} life, the young and still-developing liver is heavily exercised by the breakdown of fetal hemoglobin as it is replaced with adult hemoglobin. Mildly elevated serum bilirubin levels are common in <b>newborns,</b> and neonatal <b>jaundice</b> is not unusual, but bilirubin levels must be carefully monitored in case they start to climb, in which case more aggressive therapy is needed, usually via light therapy but sometimes even via exchange transfusion.|$|R
