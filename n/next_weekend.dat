40|$|A common {{discussion}} {{subject for}} the male {{part of the population}} in particular, is the prediction of <b>next</b> <b>weekend's</b> soccer matches, especially for the local team. Knowledge of offensive and defensive skills is valuable in the decision process before making a bet at a bookmaker. In this article we take an applied statistician's approach to the problem, suggesting a Bayesian dynamic generalised linear model to estimate the time dependent skills of all teams in a league, and to predict <b>next</b> <b>weekend's</b> soccer matches. The problem is more intricate than it may appear at first glance, as we need to estimate the skills of all teams simultaneously as they are dependent. It is now possible to deal with such inference problems using the iterative simulation technique known as Markov Chain Monte Carlo. We will show various applications of the proposed model based on the English Premier League and Division 1 1997 - 98; Prediction with application to betting, retrospective analysis of the final ranking [...] ...|$|R

It was the second-highest opening for both a Spider-Man film and a Sony film, after Spider-Man 3 $151.1 million debut in 2007. Early {{projections}} for the film from BoxOffice had it earning $135 million in its opening weekend, which was later adjusted to $125 million, and Deadline.com noting industry projections at anywhere between $90–120 million.

25|$|An eight-game unbeaten streak {{came to a}} gut-wrenching end in Philadelphia. Despite {{playing an}} {{unfamiliar}} midfield that included Markus Halsti and Miguel Aguilar getting their first starts ever for United, and Michael Farfan in his second start, United seemed headed to an earning a point with a scoreless draw against the Philadelphia Union. After using all three substitutions, United was suddenly shorthanded in the game's final minutes, when Silva left the match because of a hamstring injury. In the 3rd minute of stoppage time, Zach Pfeffer got the winning goal for the Union. Traveling to Foxboro the <b>next</b> <b>weekend</b> to play the New England Revolution, United seemed headed to a dispiriting second straight loss, trailing 1-0 at halftime. When two players were shown red cards {{early in the second}} half, there was reason to expect United to rally and take the 3 points. Nonetheless, the team struggled to generate good chances. Desperate to find the tying goal, Coach Olsen even turned to a new player, Facundo Coria, who had been signed only the week before. Coria reward the move, sending a pass to Kemp in the left corner, and Kemp's cross found the foot of the streaking Arrieta, who scored the equalizing goal in a 1–1 draw that kept United on top of the Eastern Conference. United finished a hugely challenging road trip, playing the 3rd straight road game over an 8-day span, against the Portland Timbers. Because of injuries and tired legs, Olsen rolled out a decidedly second-choice lineup that featured a midfield consisting of Halsti, Aguilar, Jared Jeffrey and Luke Mishu. These players had a combined two starts in prior matches. Jeffrey was making only his second appearance in 2015 for United, and Mishu was not only starting for the first time, but making his first ever appearance in an MLS match. The makeshift lineup played surprisingly well, especially in the second half, but an early turnover by Kemp led to the game's only goal, as United left Portland empty-handed, with a 1–0 loss.|$|E

500|$|Billy Walton {{scored the}} only {{goal of a}} {{friendly}} match against First Division team Derby County, in which Small Heath gave a first opportunity to brothers Arnold and Fred Jones. In the first half, Derby's attacks were foiled by the defensive tactics of the Small Heath half-backs, on fine form, and Wheldon twice hit the post. Derby, who had the better of the second half, appeared to score from a free kick, but the goal was disallowed because the ball had not been touched {{on its way to}} the net. That apart, Small Heath's defence held out, and Hollis, in goal for the unavailable Charsley, [...] "defended brilliantly".
