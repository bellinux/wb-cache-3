40|$|Foliar {{fertilizer}} application on sugarcane plantations using a knapsack sprayer was ineffective in spraying liquid foliar fertilizer evenly {{across the surface}} of the leaf. To improve its performance, a knapsack power sprayer was modified and tested, for a better comfort and effectiveness of the liquid foliar {{fertilizer application}}. The motor sprayer was modified by replacing its big fluid tank with a smaller fluid tank of the manual sprayer. The <b>nozzle</b> <b>pipe</b> was modified in such a way to be used in spraying two rows of sugarcane in one pass. The modified motor sprayers were tested in sugarcane plantation for applying the foliar fertilizer.

Spraying using high pressure of the motor sprayer could spray the foliar fertilizer to the leaf surface uniformly. The droplet size was more tiny, and could reach the entire leaf of the sugarcane.

40|$|A thermal {{analysis}} of the compressible CO 2 flow for the Portable Fire Extinguisher (PFE) system has been performed. A SINDA/FLUINT model has been developed for this analysis. The model includes the PFE tank and the TeSS nozzle, and both have initial temperature of 72 F. In order to investigate the thermal effect on the nozzle due to discharging CO 2, the PFE TeSS <b>nozzle</b> <b>pipe</b> has been divided into three segments.

40|$|The present work proposes an {{extension}} of the existing analytical development on the radial spread of a liquid jet over a horizontal surface to the case of a thin radial flow. When the gap, H, between the jet nozzle and the plate is reduced the discharging area may be smaller than the inlet area leading to an increase of the main flow velocity downstream of the thin cylindrical opening. This increase of velocity, de fined here as 1 /alpha, can be related to the relative gap of the nozzle H/R with R the <b>nozzle</b> <b>pipe</b> radius. Numerical computations with a volume of fluid method were realised with for H/R ranging from 0. 2 to 3 and with flow rates Q of 3 and 6 l/min 1. The results of these computations allowed to express alpha in respect of H/R. Taking in account the flow acceleration allowed to extend the set of equation from the jet impacting flow to the thin cylindrical opening flow. The liquid layer thickness and the surface velocity diff er with a maximum error of 4 % between the flow predicted by the model and computations. Main discrepancies appear in the region close to the nozzle where the analytical model assumption of a constant velocity outside the boundary layer is not valid. However, further downstream the model and the computations are in good agreement. Peer reviewe...|$|E

40|$|Traffic exhaust is {{the major}} {{pollutant}} source in urban areas that adversely affects air quality and the living standard of stakeholders. Round free jet is an appropriate platform that helps elucidate the turbulence and transport processes {{in the wake of}} a vehicular tailpipe. There is increasing evidence that turbulence structures in the whole flow are all affected by jet initial conditions, such as Reynolds number at the jet exit. However, most of the studies focused on round free jet in the stagnant environment or with extremely low coflow strength, which cannot be used to characterize the effect of background wind. Therefore, it is necessary to study the downstream emission plume being influenced by the interaction between the vehicular exhaust jet and the ambient wind. This research applied laboratory measurement techniques with the assistance of an axisymmetric mathematical model. In the laboratory, a 1 -meter high and 1 -meter wide test rack was built, on which a <b>pipe</b> <b>nozzle</b> and several measurement sensors were mounted. <b>Pipe</b> <b>nozzles</b> of different diameter were employed to control the mean velocity also. The Reynolds number at the jet exit in this study ranged from 6000 to 28000. A constant-temperature hot-wire anemometer with Xprobe and a resistance temperature detector (RTD) were installed on the test rack to detect the mean value and turbulent quantities in the wake of the jet. Due to the difficulty of simulating ambient wind in the laboratory platform, an axisymmetric computational domain was created in the cylindrical coordinates; it was solved by the standard k–ε model and was validated by lab measurement results to examine the flow characteristics in a turbulent round jet in coflow environment. Initial conditions are very significant factors for turbulence development. The critical value of Reynolds number for mean flow field is 10, 000 and is little related to the jet exit diameter. The mean velocity evolves into self-similarity faster than turbulent intensity. The critical Reynolds number for turbulent flow field is larger than the critical value of Reynolds number for mean flow field and is closely related to jet exit diameter. The relationship between critical Reynolds number for turbulent velocity field and jet exit diameter has been achieved by measurement data. The asymptotic value of turbulent intensity is also linearly related to long <b>pipe</b> <b>nozzle</b> diameter, instead of other initial conditions. Coflow strength is another significant factor for turbulence development. The normalized axial excess velocity decay is strongly affected by coflow strength. The mean velocity decay rate is not constant in the flow (except in the near-field region). The velocity field in the far-field region is dominated by the background wind. So the effect of coflow strength on turbulence development in the axial direction varies with coflow strength. Meanwhile, the spreading rate is linearly dependent on coflow strength that means coflow strength has the same effect on the turbulence development in the radial direction. Coflow strength also inhibits the turbulent intensity along the centerline in the intermediate-field and far-field regions. With higher coflow strength, the turbulent flow gets into self-similarity more quickly. published_or_final_versionMechanical EngineeringMasterMaster of Philosoph...|$|R

The relative velocity of airflow around a yarn was expanded up to 300 m/s. Previously, this had been investigated up to 100 m/s. Both the supplying air pressure and combinations of <b>nozzles</b> and <b>pipes</b> changed diffusion of the flow in a pipe. Air drag force increased extremely if the primary stream acted on the yarn directly when the jet from the nozzle was directed at very high speed (around sonic velocity). Yarn was often stuck inside the pipe by the airflow when very thin pipes were used. When this occurred, air drag force was reduced to half. The air drag coefficient Cf for monofilament yarn has been arranged using the radius Reynolds number, Rea, for suction flow with lower than 100 m/s. The formula, Cf = KRea-n, has been applied for suction flow under 500 in Rea. Cf could be arranged {{in the same manner}} for annular jet or confined jet if airflow acted on a yarn in the pipe uniformly. This formula, then, is also available even for very high velocity over 100 m/s. According to these results, we were able to calculate air drag force on monofilament yam.

A quantitative assessment is undertaken of the global differences between axisymmetric turbulent free jet flames from a smooth contraction and <b>pipe</b> <b>nozzle</b> by measurement of the radiant fraction, mean flame length, lift-off height and blow-off. The results show that the differences in these parameters are significant. The smooth contraction nozzle produces a flame less radiant, longer and more stable flame than the pipe. It resists lift-off at higher velocities and is self-sustaining at velocities 17 % greater than that for the pipe. Similarly, lift-off is prevented till a velocity 40 % higher compared to the pipe. The 25 % higher radiant fraction of the smooth contraction is also significant. These results show that the trends found in previous studies [4, 5] in non-reacting jets, where differences in the initial flow conditions are found to propagate throughout the flow, also apply for reacting flows. Thus the accepted approach of normalising global parameters based solely on bulk mean velocity and nozzle diameter is inadequate. A. S. Langman, G. J. Nathan and P. J. Ashma...|$|R

In all jets the shear-layer transition is dominated by vortex rolling-ups and pairings, which generate strong components in the noise spec-tra.
