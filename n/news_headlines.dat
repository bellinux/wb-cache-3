40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} our {{participation in}} the TREC 2009 Blog Track. Our system consists of the query likelihood component and the <b>news</b> <b>headline</b> prior component, based on the language model framework. For the query likelihood, we propose several approaches to estimate the query language model and the <b>news</b> <b>headline</b> language model. We also suggest two approaches to choose the 10 supporting relevant posts: Feed-Based Selection and Cluster-Based Selection. Furthermore, we propose two criteria to estimate the <b>news</b> <b>headline</b> prior for a given day. Experimental results show that using the prior significantly improves {{the performance of the}} task. ...|$|R

5|$|The Second Test {{match was}} held at Lord's, but Miller was still unable to bowl when it began. He came in to bat in the first innings with Australia at 3/166 on the first {{afternoon}} after electing to bat. Bedser bowled three consecutive outswingers; the fourth ball swung the other way, and Miller was hit on the pads not offering a shot, believing that the ball would have curved away past the stumps. The umpire upheld England's appeal for leg before wicket (lbw) and Miller was out for four. O'Reilly blamed Miller's poor form with the bat on an excessive bowling workload imposed on him by Bradman. Australia made 350, but suffered a blow when Lindwall's injury flared {{up in the first}} over; Lindwall played on through the pain. Bradman threw Miller the ball, hoping that the all rounder would reverse his decision not to bowl and take inspiration from Lindwall. The injured bowler returned the ball, citing his back. His gesture generated <b>news</b> <b>headlines</b> among journalists who believed that he had disobeyed Bradman.|$|E

25|$|President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali {{had ruled}} Tunisia since 1987, mostly as a one-party {{state with the}} Democratic Constitutional Rally (known as the RCD) in power.

40|$|Business and {{financial}} news are important resources that investors referred to when monitoring the stock performance. News brings us {{the latest information}} about the stock market. Studies have shown that business {{and financial}} news have a strong correlation with future stock performance. Business and financial news {{can be used to}} extract sentiments and opinions that may assist in the stock price predictions.

We utilized two most important elements of <b>news,</b> the <b>headline</b> and the content as our test data. We use polarity lexicon to distinguish between positive and negative polarity of each term in the corpus. We further investigate on how <b>news</b> <b>headline</b> will affect the sentiment analysis by adjusting the weights of the <b>news</b> <b>headline</b> and <b>news</b> content’s sentiment value. Three sets of experiments were carried out using headline only, content only and headline and content as test data. In the experiment, we used non-stemming tokens and stemming tokens when considering individual word found in the news article. The preliminary results are presented and discussed in this paper...|$|R
