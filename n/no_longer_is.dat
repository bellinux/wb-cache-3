25|$|A beam {{projector}} is a lensless instrument {{with very}} little beam spread. It uses two reflectors. The primary reflector is a parabolic reflector and the secondary reflector is a spherical reflector. The parabolic reflector directs the light into nearly parallel beams, and the spherical reflector is {{placed in front of}} the lamp to reflect light from the lamp back to the parabolic reflector, which reduces spill. The result is an intense shaft of light that cannot be easily controlled or modified. The beam projector <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>is</b> used {{to the extent that it}} once was, as newer fixtures and PAR lamps have created easier ways to produce the effect.|$|E

25|$|The {{head and}} body of Euoplocephalus {{were covered with}} bony armor, except for parts of the limbs and {{possibly}} the distal tail. The armor consisted of osteoderms, skin ossifications that {{are not part of}} the skeleton proper. This armor was in 1982 extensively described by Kenneth Carpenter, who however, largely based himself on the very complete specimen NHMUK R5161, the holotype of Scolosaurus, which genus <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>is</b> seen as a synonym of Euoplocephalus. When limited to the certain material of the latter genus, little is known of the exact configuration of the armor, with the exception of the head and the neck. The most informative specimen in this respect would then be ROM 1930, having conserved some osteoderms of the torso in their original position.|$|E
25|$|Much of the municipality's {{economy is}} now {{tied to the}} influx of {{tourists}} and foreigners who come to live, mostly retirees. A Wikipedia sister site Wikivoyage has an entry for San Miguel de Allende. In 2002, 250,000 visitors spent about 8.4 million USD at the town's attractions, but those who live here contribute far more to the economy. Most of this is concentrated {{in the town of}} San Miguel proper. It accounts for over 36% of the municipality's jobs and most of the municipality's income. Tourism accounts for almost all of the municipality's income from outside. This began in the mid 20th century as a cheap place to live; however, despite recent economic downturns, it <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>is.</b> This has not lessened San Miguel's attraction for foreign visitors and retirees as homes and hotels here are still significantly cheaper than in the U.S. or Europe. Despite not having a casino or an airport and being 400 miles from the nearest beach, this small city has been ranked by magazines such as Time and Leisure and Condé Nast Traveler as one of its preferred places to live and visit.|$|E

500|$|However, {{there is}} no precise point at which an object {{can be said to}} have reached {{hydrostatic}} equilibrium. As Soter noted in his article, [...] "how are we to quantify the degree of roundness that distinguishes a planet? Does gravity dominate such a body if its shape deviates from a spheroid by 10 percent or by 1 percent? Nature provides no unoccupied gap between round and nonround shapes, so any boundary would be an arbitrary choice." [...] Furthermore, the point at which an object's mass compresses it into an ellipsoid varies depending on the chemical makeup of the object. Objects made of ices, such as Enceladus and Miranda, assume that state more easily than those made of rock, such as Vesta and Pallas. Heat energy, from gravitational collapse, impacts, tidal forces, or radioactive decay, also factors into whether an object will be ellipsoidal or not; Saturn's icy moon Mimas is ellipsoidal, but Neptune's larger moon Proteus, which is similarly composed but colder because of its greater distance from the Sun, is irregular. In addition, the much larger Iapetus is ellipsoidal but does not have the dimensions expected for its current speed of rotation, indicating that it was once in hydrostatic equilibrium but <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>is.</b>|$|E
