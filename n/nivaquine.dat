50|$|After these events, Charles de Gaulle boycotted Sangoulé Lamizana {{in order}} to obtain Yaméogo's release. He {{received}} a promise. But time passed and in January 1968, Yaméogo made a second attempt at suicide by drinking a strong dose of <b>Nivaquine.</b> Finally, on 8 May 1969, Yaméogo was condemned in a closed court to five years of forced labour and banishment for life with the loss of all civil rights. A few days after this verdict, Lamizana issued a presidential pardon and on 5 August 1970, Yaméogo was set free.|$|E
50|$|Chloroquine was, until recently, {{the most}} widely used anti-malarial. It was the {{original}} prototype from which most methods of treatment are derived. It is also the least expensive, best tested and safest of all available drugs. The emergence of drug-resistant parasitic strains is rapidly decreasing its effectiveness; however, it is still the first-line drug of choice in most sub-Saharan African countries. It is now suggested that it is used in combination with other antimalarial drugs to extend its effective usage. Popular drugs based on chloroquine phosphate (also called <b>nivaquine)</b> are Chloroquine FNA, Resochin and Dawaquin.|$|E
40|$|International audienceOver {{the last}} decade, acute drug intoxications {{have been known}} to be a serious threat to the public health field. Nevertheless, only a few means of {{imperfect}} detoxication treatments have, unfortunately, been applied to date. This paper presents water-in-oil-in-water (w/o/w) reactive multiple emulsions (ME) as an efficient method of in vitro detoxication against <b>Nivaquine,</b> a drug widely accused of being used in suicide attempts. The detoxication efficiency of these emulsions is attributed to the use of an adequate extractant-trapping agent couple giving a good extraction yield. Interestingly, some prepared emulsions showed a <b>Nivaquine</b> extraction yield of about 85 %. A series of studies was conducted to recognize the effect of the preparation protocol, the emulsion ingredients, especially the extractant-trapping agent couple, and the experimental conditions on the extraction output. The extraction yield increases with the concentration of the extractant and with the alcalinization of the extraction medium. Globally, these reactive multiple emulsions have shown to be stable and highly detoxifying against <b>Nivaquine</b> taken as a toxic molecule model. Moreover, the process of <b>Nivaquine</b> extraction by the extractant in the oily phase and its trapping in the internal aqueous phase has been elucidated and validated...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Cutis Laxa (CL) is a {{rare disease}} in which the skin loses its {{elasticity}} and hangs in large folds. It is an inherited or acquired connective tissue disorder. We report {{the case of a}} 29 year-old woman followed up since 4 years for a dermatomyositis treated with glucocorticosteroids and methotrexate. She was hospitalized in February 2012 for fever, arthralgia, pelvic and shoulder muscle weakness with myalgia, malar rash, thrombocytopenia, leucopenia and lymphocytopenia Immunological tests showed Antinuclear Antibodies (ANA) (+) to 1 / 640, AC anti-DNA (+) and AC anti-SSA (+). Histology of the salivary glands showed grade III lymphocytic sialadenitis. The systemic lupus erythematosus and secondary Sjögren’s syndrome were diagnosed. The patient was treated with glucocorticostroids, methotrexate, <b>nivaquine</b> and bissolvon. One year later, the patient presented a skin aging that began in hands which has expanded rapidly in the face. The skin biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of a "Cutis Laxa". The esthetic treatment is proposed...|$|E
40|$|If {{rheumatoid}} arthritis (RA) {{patients with a}} mild disease course could be identified early in the phase of the disease, therapy with less aggressive and probably less toxic antirheumatic drugs seems to be rational. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate which factors at baseline could predict a clinical response (American College of Rheumatology preliminary response criteria) after treatment with chloroquine for 16 weeks. Two hundred and three early RA patients with active disease were treated with oral chloroquine sulphate (<b>Nivaquine)</b> at a daily dose of 300 mg during the first 4 weeks, 200 mg during the second 4 weeks and 100 mg thereafter. One hundred and eighty-three patients (90 %) completed the study and 20 patients prematurely discontinued treatment. Of all the patients, 43 patients (21 %) met the response criteria. A low level of C-reactive protein (CRP) was the only independent predictor for clinical response [relative risk: 0. 97 (95 % confidence interval: 0. 95 - 0. 98) ]. It was concluded that a clinical response to chloroquine therapy in early RA patients can be predicted by a low CRP level at baselin...|$|E
40|$|Microsporidia are spore forming {{protozoan}} parasites who cause {{a variety}} of diseases among immunodeficiency patients. Only a few cases are reported among immunocompetent patients. We report a case of intestinal microsporidial infection in a 22 -year-old student, coming back from Guatemala, after one month travel. Clinical aspects: The young boy {{was admitted to the}} hospital for napache with stiffness, backache and fever at 39 °C. He reported nonbloody diarrhea 5 days before hospitalization, without nausea or vomiting. During his travel he also presented a few days of self-limited diarrhea, with watery stools without fever. At the end of the trip he had lost 10 kg. Before his travel he was vaccinated against A hepatitis, poliomyelitis, typhoid fever and he receved a malaria prophylaxis by <b>Nivaquine.</b> The clinical examination pointed out a discreet pain at the left iliac fossa, napache and fever. Diagnosis: The biology schows an inflammatory syndrome, hyperleucocytosis, and impairing of the hepatic tests with cholestasis. Routine cultures for bacterial pathogens were negative. Stool examination for parasites with use of direct examination or after diphasic concentration didn't reveal the presence of pathogens. The search of cryptosporidia was also negative. All the serologies even against the HIV for the search of a viral etiology were negative. By the use of a modified trichrome stain, some bright pink-red organism mesuring 1 - 2 µ were detected by light microscopy in three consecutive stools. We concluded to the presence of protozoa of the phylum Microspora. Treatment: The patient receved first ciprofloxacine then albendazole, as specifically treatment. All the symptoms disappeared one month after hospitalization. The low charge of parasites didn't allow electron microscopy nor polymerase chain reaction for the determination of the species...|$|E
