40|$|We {{introduce}} a simple model of static networks, where nodes {{are located on}} a ring structure, and two accompanying dynamic rules of repeated averaging on periodic <b>node</b> <b>states.</b> We assume <b>nodes</b> can interact with neighbors, and will add long-range links randomly. The number of long-range links, E, controls structures of these networks, and we show that there exist many types of fixed points, when E is varied. When E is low, fixed points are mostly diverse <b>states,</b> in which <b>node</b> <b>states</b> are diversely populated; on the other hand, when E is high, fixed points tend {{to be dominated by}} converged <b>states,</b> in which <b>node</b> <b>states</b> converge to one value. Numerically, we observe properties of fixed points for various E's, and also estimate points of the transition from diverse states to converged states for four different cases. This kind of simple network models will help us understand how diversities that we encounter in many systems of complex networks are sustained, even when mechanisms of averaging are at work,and when they break down if more long-range connections are added.

When there is no flow across a node or there are flows only on the channel where the node stays, that node is at single-channel state. When the flows are distributed on different channels, the node is at switching <b>state.</b> A <b>node</b> is at non-free state when it is a neighbor of a switching <b>state</b> <b>node.</b> After applying those states, the deafness problem constraint is defined as two consecutive nodes in a flow cannot be simultaneously at switching state.|$|R
40|$|In sensor network, energy {{conservation}} {{is one of}} the most critical issues since sensor nodes should perform a sensing task for a long time (e. g., lasting a few years) but the battery of them cannot be replaced in most practical situations. For this purpose, numerous {{energy conservation}} schemes have been proposed and duty cycling scheme is considered the most suitable power conservation technique, where sensor <b>nodes</b> alternate between <b>states</b> having different levels of power consumption. In order to analyze the energy consumption of energy conservation scheme based on duty cycling, it is essential to obtain the probability of each state. In this paper, we analytically derive steady state probability of sensor <b>node</b> <b>states,</b> i. e., sleep, listen, and active states, based on traffic characteristics and timer values, i. e., sleep timer, listen timer, and active timer. The effect of traffic characteristics and timer values on the steady state probability and energy consumption is analyzed in detail. Our work can provide sensor network operators guideline for selecting appropriate timer values for efficient energy conservation. The analytical methodology developed in this paper can be extended to other energy conservation schemes based on duty cycling with different sensor <b>node</b> <b>states,</b> without much difficulty...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Target {{tracking}} is {{a killer}} application in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Energy efficiency {{is one of the}} most important design goals for target tracking. In this paper, we propose a herd-based target tracking protocol (HTTP) with the notions of <b>node</b> <b>state</b> transition and herd-based node group for target tracking. A sensor node has three states, namely, sleeping state, sensing state, and tracking state. Each sensor node is associated with a weight to be used to make a state transition among the three states. When a target moves into a monitoring area, a cluster node is selected as the herd head that is responsible for reporting the target information to the sink in the network. The sensor node can adjust the frequency of data reporting according to the velocity of the target. Simulation results show that HTTP not only improves the energy efficiency, but also enhances the tracking accuracy.

Tumours with a mitotic activity index of more than 10 were predominantly DNA aneuploid (61 %) compared with those with a mitotic activity index of less than 10 which showed a DNA aneuploid pattern in 27 %. The strongest prognosticator, the morphometric prognostic index (a multivariate combination of mitotic activity index, tumour size, and lymph <b>node</b> <b>state)</b> correlated positively with the DNA index in 63 % of the cases (p = 0. 038). Thus there was a discrepancy between the morphometric and DNA flow cytometric prognostic variables in 37 % of the cases.

Topology-oriented indicators of tipping points and early-warning signals of criticality in net- works {{do not reflect}} the gradual movement of a system towards a tipping point.

Remoteness and velocity reflect change in the state per iteration and are considered in order to estimate the influence of node dynamics. Both node dynamics and topology are taken into account. We consider the positive and negative impact of interbank interactions (edge presence). Each edge is considered with weight and length parameters corresponding to the size of interbank lending and the number of iterations remaining before it expires. It was shown that the dropping well below zero of the presented indicator, {{is referred to as the}} potential of interactions, is a sign of a forthcoming tipping point.

This paper concentrates on preventive contention avoidance schemes to decrease burst loss probability at the OBS layer of such hybrid network scenarios. Into operation, the proposed solution locally reacts to highly loaded downstream node situations by preventively deflecting bursts through a less loaded neighbor. Two different approaches for disseminating adjacent nodes state information are presented and extensively evaluated.

The preferred input vectors and <b>node</b> voltage <b>states</b> are identified {{to minimize the}} total leakage power consumption in the sleep mode. New low leakage design guidelines {{based on the results}} are presented. Previous studies indicate that a discharged dynamic <b>node</b> voltage <b>state</b> with high inputs is preferable to reduce the subthreshold leakage power consumption in an idle dual threshold voltage domino gate. However, the gate oxide leakage is ignored in the previous studies. The significantly increased gate dielectric tunneling current, as described in this paper, shifts the leakage power characteristics of dynamic circuits in the sub- 65 nm CMOS technologies. Contrary to the previously published techniques in older technologies, a charged dynamic <b>node</b> voltage <b>state</b> with low inputs is preferred for reducing the total leakage power consumption in the wide fan-in dual threshold voltage domino gates. Similarly, a charged dynamic <b>node</b> voltage <b>state</b> with low inputs is preferred for lowering the leakage power consumption in all types of low threshold voltage domino gates in a 45 nm CMOS technology. 1...|$|R

Next, the subsequent computation automatically infers the child nodes stage by stage along the branches. At each stage, the child <b>node</b> <b>states</b> are sampled from a posterior distribution, which incorporates image observations in different view-points and pre-defined priors, such as smoothness.

40|$|The {{structure}} of many biological, social and technological systems can usefully {{be described in}} terms of complex networks. Although often portrayed as fixed in time, such networks are inherently dynamic, as the edges that join nodes are cut and rewired, and nodes themselves update their states. Understanding the {{structure of}} these networks requires us to understand the dynamic processes that create, maintain and modify them. Here, we build upon existing models of coevolving networks to characterize how dynamic behaviour at the level of individual nodes generates stable aggregate behaviours. We focus particularly on the dynamics of groups of nodes formed endogenously by nodes that share similar properties (represented as <b>node</b> <b>state)</b> and demonstrate that, under certain conditions, network modularity based on state compares well with network modularity based on topology. We show that if nodes rewire their edges based on fixed node states, the network modularity reaches a stable equilibrium which we quantify analytically. Furthermore, if <b>node</b> <b>state</b> is not fixed, but can be adopted from neighbouring nodes, the distribution of group sizes reaches a dynamic equilibrium, which remains stable even as the composition and identity of the groups change. These results show that dynamic networks can maintain the stable community structure that has been observed in many social and biological systems...|$|E
