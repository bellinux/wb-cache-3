500|$|Mr. Nobody is a {{tale about}} choice. Nemo, a nine-year-old boy, has been thrust into a {{position}} where he must make an impossible decision – to choose between his mother and father. In the seconds preceding the rest of his life, he wonders where each choice will take him. The forces of the universe working to bring about total chaos are counteracted by this boy's overactive imagination. The dilemma that causes the film's main problem (not knowing the future) once solved makes it all the more difficult – [...] "I don't know the future, therefore I cannot make a decision. <b>Now</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> the future I still cannot make one." [...] The eloquent interplay between philosophical lifestyle and what forges reality, is epitomized by the constant change in storyline, between young boy, adolescent, and mature man. The film takes a four-dimensionalists view of the nature and existence of life in the universe. Each decision thus branching off creating an entirely separate alternative universe. Mr. Nobody raises many ontological arguments about the subjective nature of time. How actions have universal consequences, how the past inevitably shapes the future in a very impacting way – every single choice, no matter its simplicity or complexity can make, alter or change a lifetime.|$|E
500|$|At {{the heart}} of this scene is Cable's song [...] "You've Got to Be Carefully Taught", in which Cable realizes the sources of his own racism. [...] Its frank lyrics made it perhaps the most {{controversial}} element of the show. Michener recalled in his memoirs that a delegation of New Englanders had approached him after a New Haven tryout and urged him to recommend the song's removal to Rodgers and Hammerstein. [...] When Michener told Hammerstein, he laughed and replied, [...] "That's what the show is about!" [...] Boston drama critic Elliot Norton, after seeing the show in tryouts, strongly recommended its removal, or at least that Cable sing it less [...] "briskly", as there was much bigotry in Boston; Logan replied that that was all the more reason for leaving it unaltered. Several New York reviewers expressed discomfort with the song; Wolcott Gibbs wrote of [...] "something called 'You've Got to Be Taught', a poem in praise of tolerance that somehow I found a little embarrassing" [...] while John Mason Brown opined that he was [...] "somewhat distressed by the dragged-in didacticism of such a plea for tolerance as 'You've Got to Be Taught'". After the Broadway opening, Hammerstein received a large number of letters concerning [...] "You've Got to Be Carefully Taught". [...] Judging by the letters that remain among his papers in the Library of Congress, the reaction was mixed. One correspondent wrote [...] "What can I say to a man who writes, 'You've got to be taught to hate and fear?'... <b>Now</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> you, I feel that my informants didn't praise you enough." [...] Nevertheless, another wrote, [...] "I feel the inclusion of the song particularly in the album and to some extent in the show itself is not helpful to the cause of brotherhood, your intent to the contrary notwithstanding".|$|E
2500|$|When {{asked in}} an {{interview}} who he thought the originator of the 2005 bombings in London was, Litvinenko responded saying, [...] "You know, I have spoken about it earlier and I shall say <b>now,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> only one organization, which has made terrorism the main tool of solving of political problems. It is the Russian special services." ...|$|E

2500|$|Gwen Ihnat of The A.V. Club {{gave the}} episode {{positive}} review, {{giving it a}} B-. While she liked the episode, she left some reservations: [...] "Ultimately, depending on what you want from your Once, “Dreamcatcher” {{was a bit of}} a let down. It moved the plot along, but at a feverish pace and with built in leaps in faith and storyline that just haven’t been explained enough. (How, for instance, did Emma learn that she could capture memories in dreamcatchers? [...] And why is that the craft she chose now that she doesn’t need to sleep?) Maybe all those assumptions and conclusions will be eventually explained in one of those “ohhhhh, I get it now” summations a couple of episodes down the road, but maybe not. Once’s writers and creators have a tendency to play fast and loose with their storylines, knowing their audience will just kind of accept it and move on. Thus, these kinds of leaps aren’t really out of the question for them. (You can’t blame them, really. We’re already watching a show about fairy tales, for crying out loud.) But I didn’t really get “Dreamcatcher.” I’m not sure that I’m supposed to yet, and down the road I might change my mind and say, “you know, that was the episode I need to go back and watch <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> what I know.” But for now, it just left me a little cold.

2500|$|VA-11 HALL-A [...] made {{appearances}} on {{lists of the}} most anticipated video games multiple times before its release. An article by GamesRadar staff of the [...] "12 PAX East games we wish we were still playing" [...] included VA-11 HALL-A; praise was directed at the game's complexity, and how [...] "you can decide to give the customer the drink they ordered, flipping through the recipe book and dragging ingredients into the mixer in a simple minigame, or you can screw it up, and give them something totally different", {{as well as the}} [...] "wildly different directions" [...] the narrative takes as a result. Similarly, Twinfinite's Matthew Byrd ranked VA-11 HALL-A first on the [...] "10 Anticipated Indie Games You Have to Check Out in 2016", writing that: [...] "While I can honestly say that I've never specifically wished for a cyberpunk bartending game before, <b>now</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> such a thing exists, it is all that I can think of." [...] Zach Budgor of Kill Screen described VA-11 HALL-A as one of their favourite titles at Cyberpunk Game Jam 2014, describing it as [...] "self-styled 'cyberpunk bartender action' with detailed art and an LP's worth of bass-heavy future bangers." [...] PC Gamer added VA-11 HALL-As playable prologue to their list of [...] "The best free PC games". Upon release, Thomas Faust of IndieGames.com labelled VA-11 HALL-A the best game of the year, adding [...] "as far as I'm concerned, the rest of 2016 can go home now. Game of the year right there, bam." [...] Faust also noted that the slice of life setting of VA-11 HALL-A, as well as its characters, are a departure from more conventional video game settings. Similarly, Gizmodo UK on June 25 listed VA-11 HALL-A as their top recommended video game for the week. Ana Valens of Den of Geek also listed VA-11 HALL-A as [...] "one of the great visual novels of 2016", again praising the game's characters and [...] "powerful" [...] writing.|$|E
