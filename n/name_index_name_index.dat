This means UTF-16 code units are supported, but the file {{system does not}} check whether a sequence is valid UTF-16 (it allows any {{sequence of}} short values, not restricted {{to those in the}} Unicode standard). File names are limited to 255 UTF-16 code units. Certain names are reserved in the volume root directory and cannot be used for files. These are , , , , , [...] (dot), , , , , , and [...] (dot) and $Extend are both directories; the others are files. The NT kernel limits full paths to 32,767 UTF-16 code units. There are some additional restrictions on code points and file names.|$|R

40|$|Empirical {{evidence}} shows that health need and health care access depend, among other factors,on socioeconomic variables. Weighting the healthcare capitation system with a deprivation index would achieve equity in resource allocation in the Italian Nhs. The Scottish Nhs healthcare funding allocation formula includes a recently approved deprivation <b>index,</b> <b>named</b> Arbuthnott <b>index,</b> which allows for differentials in health care access due to relative poverty. Following the Scottish experience, this paper proposes a deprivation index based on regional data for weighting the Italian capitation formula. Key words.

Based on the advantages of wire-driven parallel mechanism, a 6 -DOF low-gravity environment simulation device with eight wires is designed in this paper. Firstly, the configuration and dimensional design of this wire-driven parallel mechanism are carried out. To operate and control the wire-driven parallel mechanism, a force distribution algorithm is introduced and the workspace is analyzed. Then, an evaluation <b>index</b> <b>named</b> quality <b>index</b> is established in order to study {{the performance of the}} wire-driven parallel manipulator in its workspace and reasonable tension is obtained after analyzing the influence on quality index caused by different wire tension...|$|R

Several methods propose uncertainty indexes based on specific data features, thus incomplete, while others are based on learning. We propose a simple <b>index,</b> <b>named</b> ambiguity <b>index,</b> taking into account both data and regularization, and derived directly from the optimization process. Exploiting properties of dynamic programming, this index is related to the posterior variance of the solution when the Semi-Global Matching (SGM) algorithm is used for stereo reconstruction. To illustrate its interest, improvements in refining stereo reconstruction are shown on the KITTI datasets when the index is used...|$|R
