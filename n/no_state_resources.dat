40|$|Measurement-based quantum {{computation}} {{is a novel}} model of quantum computing where universal {{quantum computation}} {{can be done with}} only local measurements on each particle of a quantum many-body state, which is called a <b>resource</b> <b>state.</b> One large difference of the measurement-based model from the circuit model is the existence of byproducts. In the circuit model, a desired unitary U can be implemented deterministically, whereas the measurement-based model implements BU, where B is an additional operator, which is called a byproduct. In order to compensate byproducts, following measurement angles must be adjusted. Such a feed-forwarding requires some classical processing and tuning of the measurement device, which cause the delay of computation and the additional decoherence. Is there any byproduct-free <b>resource</b> <b>state?</b> Here we show that if we respect the no-signaling principle, {{which is one of the}} most fundamental principles of physics, <b>no</b> universal <b>resource</b> <b>state</b> can avoid byproducts.
