5|$|Boeing {{announced}} the 747-500X and -600X at the 1996 Farnborough Airshow. The proposed models would have combined the 747's fuselage {{with a new}} 251ft (77m) span wing derived from the 777. Other changes included adding more powerful engines and {{increasing the number of}} tires from two to four on the <b>nose</b> <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> and from 16 to 20 on the main landing gear.|$|E
5|$|The Victor was a futuristic-looking, {{streamlined}} aircraft, {{with four}} turbojet (later turbofan) engines {{buried in the}} thick wing roots. Distinguishing features of the Victor were its highly swept T-tail with considerable dihedral on the tail planes, and a prominent chin bulge that contained the targeting radar, cockpit, <b>nose</b> <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> unit and an auxiliary bomb aimer's position. It was originally required by the specification that the whole nose section could be detached at high altitudes {{to act as an}} escape pod, but the Air Ministry abandoned this demand in 1950.|$|E
5|$|The YF-23 was an unconventional-looking aircraft, with {{diamond-shaped}} wings, {{a profile}} with substantial area-ruling to reduce aerodynamic drag at transonic speeds, and an all-moving V-tail. The cockpit was placed high, near {{the nose of}} the aircraft for good visibility for the pilot. The aircraft featured a tricycle landing gear configuration with a <b>nose</b> <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> leg and two main landing gear legs. The weapons bay was placed {{on the underside of the}} fuselage between the nose and main landing gear. The cockpit has a center stick and side throttle.|$|E
25|$|The BAe 146 is a jetliner {{specifically}} designed for short runway operations. Equipped with four Avco Lycoming ALF502R-5 geared turbofan engines, the aircraft is designed for flat landings, where the main and <b>nose</b> <b>landing</b> <b>gears</b> hit the runway nearly simultaneously. It has powerful wheel-brakes and airbrakes, with large spoilers to dump lift immediately on touchdown, but lacks thrust reversers.|$|R

5|$|Visible {{changes from}} the XF-104 to {{production}} {{versions of the}} Starfighter include a longer fuselage (to accommodate the J79 engine and extra internal fuel) and a forward-retracting <b>nose</b> <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> (except two-seat versions) to increase clearance for the downward-ejecting seat. A ventral fin for increased stability was added during the YF-104A test program. Inlet shock cones and a fuselage spine fairing between the canopy and fin that housed fuel piping were further added features. Production aircraft would also feature a redesigned fin structure using stainless steel spars to eliminate the flutter problem.|$|E
25|$|The <b>nose</b> <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> {{was located}} much farther {{back on the}} {{fuselage}} rather than just under the mid-deck as with the NASA Space Shuttle.|$|E
25|$|On 18 July 2017, C-5s {{based at}} Dover {{were ordered to}} stand down so {{maintenance}} crews could determine the cause for some <b>nose</b> <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> failing.|$|E
40|$|Tow {{tractors}} operating without towbar {{facilitate the}} ground handling of civil transport aircraft. In this paper, the loads at the <b>nose</b> <b>landing</b> <b>gears</b> during towbarless towing operations are described based on extensive measurements and on analytical investigations. The necessary load limitation during extreme situations, e. g. emergency brakings, is discussed. Fatigue load spectra for towbarless towing and push-back operations {{were derived from}} operational measurements and are compared with load spectra for towbar operations. Recommendations are presented how the operational loads can be reduced by an appropriate design of towbarless tractors. Some remarks are made about towing of fully loaded aircraft to the runway...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The shimmy {{phenomenon}} is a self-excited limit cycle oscillation occurring in many physical rolling systems, particularly in aircraft <b>nose</b> <b>landing</b> <b>gears</b> (NLG). This paper presents a new active damping controller {{developed in the}} context of the European DRESS (“Distributed and Redundant Electro-mechanical nose gear Steering System”) project for avoiding the shimmy oscillation. The controller based on the direct adaptive control approach, consists of two terms: the fuzzy adaptive term approximates the feedback linearization control law, and the stabilizing control term compensates the structural modelling error. The closed-loop system stability is proven by using Lyapunov theory. Simulation results corresponding to different test scenarios show that the proposed controller is able to effectively damp the shimmy phenomenon. 1...|$|R
25|$|A similar {{incident}} with an A320 occurred on an America West Airlines flight in February 1999 in Columbus, Ohio (Flight 2811). The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) found {{the cause was}} {{a failure of the}} external o-rings in the <b>nose</b> <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> steering module. That plane also landed safely.|$|E
25|$|The Douglas XA-26 {{prototype}} (AAC Ser. No. 41-19504) first flew on 10 July 1942 at Mines Field, El Segundo, with {{test pilot}} Benny Howard at the controls. Flight tests revealed excellent performance and handling, but engine cooling problems led to cowling changes and {{elimination of the}} propeller spinners on production aircraft. Repeated collapses during testing led to reinforcement of the <b>nose</b> <b>landing</b> <b>gear.</b>|$|E
25|$|Some of {{the very}} {{earliest}} B-26s suffered collapses of the <b>nose</b> <b>landing</b> <b>gear.</b> It is {{said that they were}} caused by improper weight distribution, but that is not likely to have been the only reason. The incidents occurred during low-speed taxiing, takeoffs and landings, and occasionally the strut unlocked. Later the Martin electric dorsal turret was retrofitted to some of the first B-26s. Martin also began testing a taller vertical stabilizer and revised tail gunner's position in 1941.|$|E

50|$|In June 1931, the AAC held a {{competition}} {{to evaluate the}} P-6, P-12, XP-22, and YP-20. The XP-22 came out the winner, but the YP-20 was given a <b>nose</b> and <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> graft from the XP-22, becoming the XP-6E (P-6E prototype). With {{the addition of a}} supercharger and an enclosed cockpit, it was tested as the XP-6F.|$|R
50|$|The ASP S15 is a two-seat single-engined, all {{composite}} construction, {{powered sailplane}} {{with the engine}} mounted in the center fuselage. The cockpit has room for two in side-by-side configuration.

25|$|On July 11, 2012 SNC {{announced}} that it successfully completed testing of the <b>nose</b> <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> for Dream Chaser. This milestone evaluated the impact to the landing gear during simulated approach and landing tests {{as well as the}} impact of future orbital flights. The main landing gear was tested in a similar way in February 2012. The nose gear landing test was the last milestone to be completed before the free flight approach and landing tests scheduled for later in 2012.|$|E
25|$|The {{aircraft}} sustained significant structural damage. There was major {{damage to}} the left wing's leading edge, leading edge slats, trailing edge flaps, and spoilers. The left wing fuel tank was breached near the outboard end of the outboard flaps. The front radome and weather radar were heavily damaged, and {{damage to the}} underside of the fuselage extended {{from the front of the}} aircraft all the way back to the left front passenger door. The <b>nose</b> <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> well and the main electronics bay also were damaged.|$|E
25|$|On November 28, 2004, the <b>nose</b> <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> of KLM Flight 1673, a Boeing 737-400, {{struck a}} bird during takeoff at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol. The {{incident}} {{was reported to}} air traffic control, the landing gear was raised normally, and the flight continued normally to its destination. Upon touching down at Barcelona International Airport, the aircraft started deviating {{to the left of}} the runway centreline. The crew applied right rudder, braking, and the nose wheel steering tiller but could not keep the aircraft on the runway. After it veered off the paved surface of the runway at about 100 knots, the jet went through an area of soft sand. The <b>nose</b> <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> leg collapsed and the left main landing gear leg detached from its fittings shortly before the aircraft came to a stop perched over the edge of a drainage canal. All 140 passengers and six crew evacuated safely, but the aircraft itself had to be written off. The cause was discovered to be a broken cable in the nose wheel steering system caused by the bird collision. Contributing to the snapped cable was the improper application of grease during routine maintenance which led to severe wear of the cable.|$|E
50|$|In June 1931, the AAC held a {{competition}} {{to evaluate the}} P-6, P-12, YP-20, and XP-22. The XP-22 came out the winner, earning a contract for 45 aircraft as the Y1P-22. Following the trials, the XP-22 donated a <b>nose</b> and <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> graft to the YP-20, which became the XP-6E, and the 45 production aircraft were completed to this standard.|$|R

25|$|The Klapmeier {{brothers}} {{would often}} fly their Champ {{from the farm}} up to their uncle's boat-building business in Mora to borrow tools and other supplies—such as polyester resin—for building the plane and molding its fuselage. To reduce cost, they went to different junk yards around Wisconsin and bought what they needed: a control system out of a wrecked Piper aircraft, a Cherokee <b>nose</b> <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> to weld parts onto it and convert it to a retractable gear, and an O-540 (290hp) engine they got off a scrapped de Havilland Heron. The first VK-30 slowly took shape.|$|E
25|$|On 17 September 2016 an airBaltic Bombardier Dash 8 Q400 NextGen {{aircraft}} made {{an emergency}} landing on the runway of Riga International Airport without its <b>nose</b> <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> deployed. The plane was carrying 63 passengers and 4 crewmembers {{and was forced to}} return to Riga International Airport following issues with its front chassis. The runway was closed between 10:26 and 15:55 as a safety precaution following {{an emergency landing}}. Seven inbound flights and four outbound flights were cancelled, 17 flights were diverted to Tallinn Airport and Kaunas Airport and others were delayed. The aircraft involved was YL-BAI and the flight BT 641 was scheduled to fly from Riga to Zürich Airport. No injuries were reported.|$|E
25|$|April 14, 1993: The {{pilot of}} American Airlines Flight 102, a McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30, {{registration}} number N139AA, lost directional control during a crosswind landing in rainy conditions and caused the jetliner to slide off runway 17L after arriving from Honolulu, Hawaii. The craft dug into deep mud alongside the runway, collapsing the <b>nose</b> <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> and tearing off the left-hand engine {{and much of}} the left wing. A fire in the left-hand wheel well was rapidly extinguished by firefighters who arrived almost immediately from the nearby DFW/DPS Fire Station. 2 passengers suffered serious injuries while using the evacuation slides to escape from the steeply tilted fuselage; the remaining 187 passengers and all 13 crew evacuated in relative safety, but the aircraft was a total loss.|$|E

25|$|On 27 May 1985, a Lockheed TriStar (registration: G-BBAI) overran {{the runway}} at Leeds/Bradford Airport on landing from Palma after a rain shower. The {{aircraft}} was evacuated, with only minor injuries {{sustained by the}} 14 crew and 398 passengers. The <b>nose</b> <b>landing</b> <b>gear</b> strut folded backwards during the overrun, leading to severe damage to {{the underside of the}} forward fuselage. The undersides of both wing-mounted engines were flattened and both engines suffered ingestion damage. The main wheels of the aircraft also dug deep troughs in the area beyond the end of the runway, damaging the buried airfield lighting cables. The accident report concluded that the overrun was caused by the inability of the aircraft to achieve the appropriate level of braking effectiveness, and recommended that both the scheduled wet runway performance of the Lockheed L-1011 TriStar and the condition of the surface of runway 14 at Leeds/Bradford Airport should be re-examined.|$|E
25|$|May 21, 1988: An American Airlines McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30, {{registration}} number N136AA, operating as AA Flight 70 bound for Frankfurt, overran runway 35L after automatic warning signals prompted {{the flight crew}} to attempt a rejected takeoff; the jetliner continued to accelerate for several seconds before slowing, and did not stop until it had run 1,100 feet (335 m) past the runway threshold, collapsing the <b>nose</b> <b>landing</b> <b>gear.</b> 2 crew were seriously injured and the remaining 12 crew and 240 passengers escaped safely; the aircraft was severely damaged and was written off. Investigators attributed the overrun to a shortcoming in the design standards that were used when the DC-10 was built; {{there had been no}} requirement to test whether partially worn (as opposed to brand-new) brake pads were capable of stopping the aircraft during a rejected takeoff and 8 of the 10 worn pad sets on N136AA had failed.|$|E

40|$|Structural design {{concepts}} for load bearing mechanical systems vary due to individual usage requirements. Particularly strut-configurations for <b>landing</b> <b>gears</b> in airplanes {{push the envelope}} according to tight requirements in shock absorption, normal, lateral and torsional load capacity, rolling stability, storage dimensions, low drag, low weight, and maintenance as well as reliability, safety and availability. Since the first controlled and powered flight of the Wright-Brothers in 1903, design evolution generated different structural {{design concepts}}. Today's structures may have, seemingly, reached mature conformity with distinct load path architectures that have been prevailed. In the proposed contribution, the authors evaluate and compare distinctive performance requirements like stroke ability and ride quality, elastic force retention, structure strength, and weight of mechanisms resulting from significant structural design concepts for main and <b>nose</b> <b>landing</b> <b>gears.</b> Loads in <b>landing</b> <b>gears</b> have always been distributed in struts with high and low amounts of strut members such as rods, beams, torque links, and joints as well as different types of absorbers. This paper's goal is to clarify {{pros and cons of}} the four different concepts with respect to their vulnerability due to uncertainty. Here, uncertainty mainly occurs due to variations in elastic force retention and their effect on the performance requirements. For that, simple mathematical models are derived to evaluate and compare the most significant characteristics of the four concepts in the earliest stage of development in order to make early decisions for or against a concept before time and cost consuming detailed development work including manufacturing and test takes over...|$|R
