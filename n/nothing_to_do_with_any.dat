25|$|Two days later, President Uribe {{publicly}} {{revealed that}} former US Vice President Al Gore had canceled {{his participation in}} a pro-environment event Uribe was to attend in Miami due to the continuing allegations against him. The Colombian President reacted by organizing a press conference during which he addressed several of the accusations Senator Petro and others had made against him. Uribe argued that his family had <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>any</b> massacres {{and that they had}} already sold the implicated farms several years before the alleged events. He also stated that the Uribes and the Ochoas were both famous in the horse breeding business, causing their meetings to be both common and public. He claimed that the helicopter's hours and missions had been strictly logged, making it impossible for it to have participated in any massacre. Uribe said that he supported the CONVIVIR groups but was not solely responsible for their creation, adding that other civilian and military authorities also participated in their oversight. He also said that he dismantled some CONVIVIR groups when doubts began to surround their activities.|$|E
500|$|Witchfinder General is a 1968 British horror film {{directed}} by Michael Reeves and starring Vincent Price, Ian Ogilvy, and Hilary Dwyer. The screenplay was by Reeves and Tom Baker based on Ronald Bassett's {{novel of the}} same name. Made on a low budget of under £100,000, the movie was co-produced by Tigon British Film Productions and American International Pictures. The story details the heavily fictionalised murderous witch-hunting exploits of Matthew Hopkins, a 17th-century English lawyer {{who claimed to have}} been appointed as a [...] "" [...] by Parliament during the English Civil War to root out sorcery and witchcraft. The film was retitled The Conqueror Worm in the United States in an attempt to link it with Roger Corman's earlier series of Edgar Allan Poe–related films starring Price—although this movie has <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>any</b> of Poe's stories, and only briefly alludes to his poem.|$|E

Privately, the Gardnerian initiate and founder of Alexandrian Wicca, Alex Sanders, rejected the claims that Liddell made.

500|$|In November 2009 Loretta {{became the}} centre of media {{controversy}} when various media outlets announced that Loretta {{would be part of}} a storyline which revealed that she had murdered a child in her past. The controversy began when tabloid newspaper The Sun compared the storyline to the real life murder of James Bulger. Bulger had been murdered when he was two years old by two young children. Being just 10 years of age they were handed small sentences to serve and were later released with new identities. Soon afterwards various other news sources and lifestyle magazines picked up the story and mimicked The Sun and its claims. Bulger's mother, Denise Fergus, condemned the storyline. While speaking to the news website Click Liverpool she criticised the decision to air a plot that allegedly mirrored her son's death, stating they should have consulted her first. She said, [...] "I'm shocked and disgusted at what Hollyoaks is doing. They have clearly based this story on what happened to James and it's outrageous that they should do this without consulting with me in any way." [...] She threatened to encourage a boycott of the show. Channel 4 released a statement defending the plot, explaining it had <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>any</b> real life case: [...] "The forthcoming storyline is not based on any real-life case and it will in no way seek to recreate real events. The storyline focuses on the psychological repercussions for two characters in the show who were {{responsible for the death of}} a 12-year-old girl in the past." [...] The storyline would answer questions for viewers who had been speculating on Loretta's secret past. It would reveal that Loretta had spent time in prison for her crime, was born with the name Joanna Norman, and is living under a false identity.|$|E

2500|$|The {{charitable}} {{status of}} the JNF-UK has come under increasing attack. British prime ministers Tony Blair and Gordon Brown had been Honorary Patrons of the JNF-UK, like all British prime ministers before them since its inception. Confounding expectations, David Cameron resigned as Honorary Patron to JNF-UK in 2011. According to a spokesman, Cameron's surprise refusal {{was due to the}} JNF-UK being an organisation that was specifically focused around work in one specific country—i.e., Israel. Cameron's decision was interpreted as a snub, in spite of the spokesman's assurances that his decision had [...] "absolutely <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>any</b> anti-Israel campaign". However, campaigners claimed that Cameron's resignation was due to political pressures motivated by the JNF-KKL's discriminatory policies in Israel. Since then, the JNF-UK's Honorary Patrons include no leader of the main British political parties. An Early Day Motion in the British parliament condemning the JNF and calling for the revocation of the JNF's charitable status in the UK was launched in 2011 and by February 2012 had been signed by 66 Members of Parliament. In 2012 the Green Party called for the JNF to be stripped of its charity status and pledged to sign up to a campaign which calls the charity [...] "racist".|$|E
2500|$|The Nathan {{security}} billing and Giuliani client base stories dominated Giuliani's {{press coverage}} {{for much of}} a week and coincided with a significant drop in his national poll figures and a worsening of his fortunes in the first caucus and primary states. [...] Combined with the Kerik developments, they associated an air of political-personal doubt around the candidate. [...] The Wall Street Journal stated that [...] "These are perilous times for Rudy Giuliani." [...] In a lengthy interview on the nationally televised Meet the Press, Giuliani defended the security detail decisions, saying they were warranted by threat assessments at the time, and defended his refusal to release a full Giuliani Partners client list, saying every client of significance had already been {{pointed out in the}} press. [...] Within a month after the original Nathan report, an investigation of city records by The New York Times revealed that the billing of mayoral travel-related expenses to obscure city agencies had started two years before the Nathan visits began, and totaled a hundred times more than what was spent for the Nathan visits, thus strongly suggesting that the Nathan visits [...] "had <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>any</b> accounting legerdemain."

2500|$|Throughout {{the entire}} {{period of the}} main {{response}} to the tsunami disaster – from December 2004 {{for the next four}} or five years – there was much debate about both the size and form of way that assistance was delivered. [...] For example, just one day after the tsunami, on 27 December 2004, UN Undersecretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs Jan Egeland reportedly categorised the contributions of rich countries as [...] "stingy". This was widely misinterpreted in the media as categorising the overall response to the tsunami whereas Mr Egeland later explained that at the time he had been making a general remark about overall global aid flows in recent years. Speaking at a press conference later Mr. Egeland said, [...] "It has <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>any</b> particular country or the response to this emergency. We are in early days and the response has so far been overwhelmingly positive". The U.S. government, led by President George W. Bush and Secretary of State Colin Powell, added another US$20 million on 28 December to the original U.S pledge of US$15 million, bringing the total up to US$35 million (not including direct aid rendered by naval vessels dispatched to the region). Initially, the U.S. Navy dispatched P-3C Orion patrol aircraft and an aircraft carrier to assist with relief operations.|$|E

[...] The University argued that given the importance of protecting academic freedom the court should not permit the attorney general to exceed his statutory power, and that [...] "such a potentially invasive investigative tool should not be permitted to be used to target academics merely because the Attorney General disputes the legitimacy of their research and conclusions." [...] It noted that four of the grants queried by Cuccinelli were received from the federal government and were therefore not covered by the Virginia Fraud Against Taxpayers Act, while the fifth was awarded before the statute was enacted in 2003.

Halder {{declared}} that he would support Brauchitsch {{if he were to}} try to curtail Hitler's plans for further expansion of the war, but Brauchitsch declined (the so-called Zossen Conspiracy). Brauchitsch and Halder had decided to overthrow Hitler after the latter had fixed [...] "X-day" [...] for the invasion of France for 12 November 1939, an invasion that both officers believed to be doomed to failure. During a meeting with Hitler on 5 November, Brauchitsch had attempted to talk Hitler into putting off [...] "X-day" [...] by saying that morale in the German Army was worse than what it was in 1918. This statement enraged Hitler, who then harshly berated Brauchitsch for incompetence. After that meeting, both Halder and Brauchitsch told Carl Friedrich Goerdeler that overthrowing Hitler was simply something that they could not do, and that he should find other officers if that was what he really wanted to do.

2500|$|Iraq's {{invasion}} of Iran in September 1980 {{was preceded by}} {{a long period of}} tension between the two countries throughout 1979 and 1980, including frequent border skirmishes, calls by Iranian leader Ruhollah Khomeini for the Shia of Iraq to revolt against the Ba'ath Party, and allegations of Iraqi support for ethnic separatists in Iran. On June 18, 1979, U.S. chargé d'affaires Charlie Naas asked Yazdi about the deterioration in relations; Yazdi stated he [...] "does not know what might be bothering Iraq... certainly we have done nothing to bother them." [...] Khomeini had recently condemned Iraq's arrest of Shi'ite leader Muhammad Baqir al-Sadr, but Yazdi claimed this had <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>with</b> <b>any</b> effort to export the Islamic Revolution to Iraq: Iran was merely concerned with protecting the [...] "religious centers in Najaf and Karbala." [...] Nevertheless, in a subsequent conversation between Naas and Entezam it emerged that the latter was unaware of the anti-Iraq broadcasts [...] "Sadegh Ghotbzadeh was sanctioning in his role as managing director of National Iranian Radio and Television." [...] Continuing to seek good relations with Iranian authorities, U.S. officials uncovered considerable evidence of Iraqi support for Kurdish rebels in Iran under the leadership of Jalal Talabani (Fatah contacts told the CIA's Beirut station that [...] "Saddam Hussein himself was directly involved in supervising these operations"); while these rebels were not considered capable of overthrowing the Iranian government militarily, they were undermining Iranian moderates, prompting Precht to broach the possibility of meeting with Iraqi officials to persuade them that Iraq's support for the Kurds was not in its best interest. Throughout this time, Iraq's intentions toward Iran were not entirely clear, as [...] "the Iraqi government was continuing to put out diplomatic feelers, unsuccessfully inviting a delegation led by Bazargan to visit Iraq in July 1979," [...] while the CIA concluded in November (despite Cave's warning the previous month) that Iraq intended [...] "to settle its differences with Iran through negotiations." [...] Muhammed Dosky, [...] "a Kurdistan Democratic Party representative in Washington," [...] also believed [...] "Iraq's overriding goal was to persuade the new government in Tehran {{to live up to the}} conditions of the Algiers Accord... Iraq was using Kurdish groups not out of a sense of opportunism, or as a prelude to the coming conflict, but in order to consolidate agreements made with the Shah." [...] Saddam was willing to work with Iranian moderates such as Yazdi, whom he met in Havana in October, but [...] "the mass resignation of the Bazargan government" [...] following the November 4th seizure of the U.S. embassy and initiation of the Iran hostage crisis—and the resulting consolidation of power under Khomeini—"would profoundly change Saddam's decision-making calculus." [...] While the Iraqi archives suggest that Saddam contemplated invading Iran as early as February 1979, he was deterred from doing so until July 1980, at which point [...] "purges and revolutionary chaos" [...] had rendered Iran grossly unprepared for the attack.|$|E
