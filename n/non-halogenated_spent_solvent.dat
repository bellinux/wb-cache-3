In this strategy, a solvent comprising the TODGA extractant with addition of 5 vol. -% 1 -octanol showed very good extraction efficiency of Am(III) and Cm(III) together with the trivalent lanthanides (Ln(III)) from simulated PUREX raffinate solution without 3 rd phase formation. CDTA (cyclohexanediaminetetraacetic acid) was used as masking agent to prevent the co-extraction of Zr and Pd. An(III) and Ln(III) were co-extracted from simulated PUREX raffinate, and the loaded solvent was subjected to several stripping steps. The An(III) were selectively stripped using the hydrophilic complexing agent SO 3 -Ph-BTP (2, 6 -bis(5, 6 -di(sulfophenyl) - 1, 2, 4 -triazin- 3 -yl) pyridine). For the subsequent stripping of the Ln(III), a citric acid based solution was used. A 32 -stage process flow-sheet was designed using computer-code calculations and tested in annular miniature centrifugal contactors in counter-current mode. The innovative SANEX process showed excellent performance for the recovery of An(III) from simulated HAR solution and separation from the fission and activation products. ≥ 99. 8 % An(III) were recovered with only low impurities (0. 4 % Ru, 0. 3 % Sr, 0. 1 % Ln(III)).

30|$|The {{most common}} {{technology}} {{to generate electricity}} is the combustion of fossil fuels in power plants. The generation of electricity via power plants emits a lot of carbon dioxide (CO 2), {{which is one of}} the greenhouse gases (GHG) causing global warming that contributes to global climate change. CO 2 capture and storage (CCS) is a proposed technique for mitigating global climate change and is widely considered as highly relevant for the sustainable use of fossil fuels (IEA 2015). Absorption, using amine-based solvents such as monoethanolamine (MEA), is currently the mature technology applied in the capture of CO 2 from power plants. However, emission of amines into the air (as vapour during CO 2 capture using the technology) poses health and environmental risks. Furthermore, the efficiency penalty caused by CO 2 capture and the huge costs associated with the regeneration of the <b>spent</b> <b>solvents</b> poses a threat to the economic viability of the absorption process. Adsorption technology seems promising due to its moderate energy consumption (which stems from the ability to operate at moderate temperatures and pressures) as well as the health and environmental benign nature of the adsorbents employed in the process. Recently, extensive research has been conducted on designing adsorbents in which the amine functionality is impregnated onto solid materials, thereby resulting in the enhancement of the CO 2 adsorption capacity of these materials due to the presence of amine functional groups in them (Pires et al. 2011). Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) could be used as one of such materials unto which amine could be impregnated. Application of CNTs has attracted a great attention in the medical scientific world owing to their unique structure providing a large surface area. Possession of larger surface area is one of the desired characteristics of a good adsorbent for CO 2 capture. Carbon nanotubes are desirable as solid supports in the preparation of composite adsorbents for CO 2 capture because they possess very high surface area with good geometric structure that could be used to improve geometric structure of other adsorbents. In addition, they are hydrophobic and will not be affected by the presence of water vapour (Ganesh 2013), giving them a unique advantage over other solid sorbents such as zeolites. Therefore, the hydrophobicity of CNTs could be explored in developing composite adsorbents, with good resistance to water, for CO 2 capture from flue gas. Carbon nanotubes are simple hollow cylinders of carbon commonly formed in bundles, and have the appearance of rolled tubes of graphite (Ganesh 2013). They are characteristically a nanometre wide and several microns in length. The bulk material of the CNTs is extremely porous and allows for good adsorption of CO 2 (Boot-Handford et al. 2014). In addition, the structure of the nanotube allows for the possibility of the occurrence of adsorption both on the inside and outside of the nanotube, thus allowing for enhanced adsorption of CO 2 in the material (Friedrich et al. 2010). However extensive research reports on the application of CNTs for CO 2 capture are still limited in literature.|$|R
40|$|Many fine chemicals, {{pharmaceuticals}} and speciality {{chemicals are}} produced in batch processes, which generate {{large volumes of}} solvent mixtures as ‘waste’. Due to the interactions between the solvents in these waste mixtures, azeotropes frequently occur. Hence, these solvents cannot be easily recovered by conventional distillation, and the solvent mixtures are usually incinerated. It {{is clear that the}} recovery of <b>spent</b> <b>solvents</b> from these azeotropic solvent mixtures could offer a direct cost saving to many chemical manufacturing companies and a large benefit for the environment. The increased world-wide competitiveness in production has forced the chemical industry to improve their current processes. Consequently, the reorganization of existing process designs and the development of new processes, with the possible integration of new technologies, is of growing importance to industry. Membrane technologies have emerged as an additional category of separation processes to the well-established mass transfer processes. The advantages of membrane separations include high selectivity, low energy consumption, moderate cost to performance ratio, and compact and modular design. In recent years, pervaporation has established itself {{as one of the most}} promising membrane technologies. It offers potential solutions in a wide range of applications from the well-established dehydration of solvents to the recovery of organics from water and the separation of organic/organic mixtures. Within these applications, pervaporation as a stand-alone process has often to compete with conventional, reliable separation processes like distillation, liquid-liquid extraction, adsorption and stripping, the cost of which can be readily calculated. Despite its clear advantages related to its energyefficient character, in many cases pervaporation alone may not supply products suitable for further processing or waste disposal in accordance with environmental standards. Therefore, hybrid processes are regarded as a means of overcoming these limitations. In an attempt to combine the advantages of robust standard thermal separation processes and an alternative, energy-efficient separation technology, a hybrid distillationpervaporation process was developed for the separation of azeotropic batch solvent mixtures. This hybrid concept is an innovative combination of separation techniques that, in many cases, individually fail in satisfactorily and/or efficiently separating azeotropic solvent mixtures and purifying the solvents to the requisite level. While azeotropic distillation is regarded as expensive and insufficiently sustainable due to the addition and recovery of entrainers, pervaporation as a stand-alone process does often not offer sufficient selectivity in the separation of solvent mixtures, especially since there are almost no pervaporation membranes for organic-organic separations on the market. By combining both separation techniques in a hybrid process, however, it is anticipated that solvents could be recovered from waste streams and purified to the targeted quality in an energy-efficient, thus competitive way. This hybrid separation concept was applied to several industrially relevant binary solvent mixtures. In general, an entrainer forming a heteroazeotrope with one of the solvents in the mixture was added first. The search for suitable entrainers was based on residue curve analysis using RegSol software. The ternary solvent mixture was then separated by heteroazeotropic distillation in which the two liquid phases constituting the heteroazeotrope were split by a decanter. Finally, the separated solvents, i. e. the light and heavy phases of the formed heteroazeotrope, were further purified by pervaporation. This contribution will focus on the heteroazeotropic distillation of a acetonitrile/toluene mixture using hexane as entrainer, and the subsequent processing of the obtained acetonitrile-rich heavy phase by pervaporation. status: accepte...|$|R

The variable parameters included the solvent to clay ratio (SCR) and the extraction time. Results showed methyl ethyl ketone with the final oil removal efficiency of 61. 3 % was superior to hexane and acetone, with efficiencies of 52. 7 and 59. 1 %, respectively.

In the nuclear case, hydrochemical separation processes are already employed in the world today for the recovery of uranium and plutonium. The method is however also considered for future separation systems for use in combination with the transmutation of the minor actinides. In a hydrochemical separation process the two phases are the pregnant (usually) aqueous feed and the organic phase comprising a diluent together with one or more extractants. One such class of extractants developed for partitioning and transmutation purposes is the bis(triazine) -bipyridine-type (BTBP) molecules. When assessing the feasibility and loading properties of such an extraction system, the solubility of the ligands is of the outmost importance.

40|$|Typically {{lubricants}} contain 90 % base oil(most often petroleum fractions,called mineral oils) {{and less}} than 10 % additives. Vegetable oils or synthetic liquids such as hydrogenated polyolefins,esters,silicones,fluorocarbons and many others are sometimes used as base oils. Solvent extraction is the method to eliminate the usage of high temperature or hydrogenation process in re-refining the base oil from spent lubricant oil. The main objective {{of this study is}} to recover the base oil from <b>spent</b> lubricants using <b>solvent</b> extraction method. Besides that,the effect of different solvent,the retention time and the characteristics of the extracted base oil are also determined. The raw materials that being used were spent lubricant oil and two types of solvents. These solvents are hexane mixed with potassium hydroxide in isopropyl alcohol and N-vinyl- 2 -pyrolidone (NNVP). During the experimental study, 200 ml of lubricant oil and 800 ml of solvents were mixed and leave to settle. After that,the mixture was filtered by vacuum pump to separate the sludge. Separation was continued using rotary evaporator to get the pure base oil. Then,the characteristics of the base oil for every mixture were analyzed. Results shows that the best solvent,is solvent 1 (Hexane + KOH + IPA) because it can recover more volume of base oil compare to solvent 2 (NNVP). Besides that,the best stirring time (retention time) for both solvent is 60 minutes. Solvent 1 is better than solvent 2 because it can recover higher volume of base oil compared to solvent 2 by 37 %. As a recommendation for future work,in order to recover higher volume of base oil,the amount of potassium hydroxide (KOH) used must be increased...|$|R
40|$|This study {{describes}} the characterization and product identification of sludge that is {{obtained from the}} recycling of spent lubricant into base oil. Sludge is produced from the recuperation of spent lubricant which involves two main processes. The first process is to produce the solvent that will be used. The solvent consists of Hexane, Isopropanol (IPA) and Potassium hydroxide (KOH). The next process is the recuperation of used lubricant using the solvent produced. The ratio of <b>spent</b> lubricant and <b>solvent</b> used is 1 : 4. Physical mixing is then used to produce a natural reaction between the <b>solvent</b> and <b>spent</b> lubricant. The mixture is stirred continuously for 30 minutes. The stirred mixture is then filtered. There {{are two ways to}} filter the mixture. One is by centrifugation and the other is filtration with thin filter papers. The residue that is left behind is the sludge {{that is going to be}} used for the characterization process. Many parameters of the sludge is investigated and characterized before product identification is done. Both physical and chemical parameters are investigated. The parameters investigated are pH, density, viscosity, heavy metal content and chemical composition of the sludge. The pH of sludge on average is 6. 59 with an average density of 0. 9041 g/ml or 904. 13 kg/m 3. The average viscosity is 1419 cP. There is a fair amount of heavy metals present in the sludge and its chemical composition consists of paraffin and olefins. From the results obtained, the sludge can be singled out for its major components and the contents can be derived into useful products. Three different products are identified. The sludge can be used as raw material for pyrolysis where the end product obtained is a diesel like liquid and also as concrete or cement additive. The sludge can also be used as grease...|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} the {{application}} of membrane technology to molecular separation processes has stimulated interest and showed great potential {{in a number of}} industrial fields. A new membrane market is arising in the chemical industry where many in-process separation problems can be tackled elegantly by sufficiently stable membranes. Since the 1990 s progress has also been made in the development of solvent resistant nanofiltration membranes, opening the possibility to tackle several separation problems in non-aqueous solvents. Organic solvent nanofiltration (OSN) offers great perspectives towards wide application in the process industry as it provides a facile, energy-efficient and scalable alternative to conventional separation processes such as distillation, liquid-liquid extraction or chromatographic purification. It has been proven that OSN has an enormous potential in many solvent intensive pharmaceutical and fine-chemical processes, where it can be used for the recovery, concentration and purification of valuable target molecules, {{as well as for the}} purification and recycling of <b>spent</b> <b>solvents.</b> Here, ceramic nanofiltration membranes with their broad solvent resistance and high temperature stability, have the potential to take a significant market share. The state-of-the-art nanoporous ceramic membranes for OSN are transition metal oxide membranes, containing a large amount of surface OH-groups, making them strongly hydrophilic. By exchanging these hydroxyl groups by a more apolar group (such as alkyl, perfluoroalkyl, [...] .), the surface becomes more hydrophobic, increasing non-polar solvent fluxes. Recently, VITO and UA have developed a new versatile grafting method (modification with Grignard reagents) capable of attaching a direct, non-hydrolysable bond between the membrane surface and the functional group. This results in novel membranes with a wide range of surface functionalities. The approach used in this thesis is to investigate the properties, performance and potential of these grafted membranes in organic solvent nanofiltration. The properties of the Grignard modified membranes were examined by physico – chemical characterisation (contact angle measurements, micro-ATR/FTIR-spectroscopy) in addition to performance characterisation (flux and retention measurements). All observations for modified membranes are consistent with the assumed partial replacement of the OH-groups on the membrane surface and the consequent amphiphilic character of the modified membrane surface. Moreover, the solvent filtration performance and application potential of such Grignard functionalised membranes was further evaluated and explored. To this purpose, the retention behavior of a variety of 5 different model solvent/solute mixtures was determined for a variety of grafted and ungrafted membranes. The varying retention behaviour was evaluated by considering the changing affinity of solvents and solutes for the modified and unmodified membrane surfaces. To support this interpretation, a sorption test was used to quantify the solute-membrane affinity. A long-term test was performed in order to check the stability of grafted groups on the surface of the membrane. Further experimental work was directed to understand how to tune solvent-membrane-solute interactions in a controlled way in order to enhance OSN performance. This was achieved by performing an extensive retention study on two type of Grignard functionalised membranes, choosing three PEG molecules and polystyrene as solutes, all with almost the same size but different polarities, in a wide range of solvents including water, ethanol, dimethylformamide (DMF), isopropanol, acetone, dichloromethane (DCM), tetrahydrofuran (THF), methyl ethyl ketone (MEK), toluene, ethyl acetate, methyl isobutyl ketone, cyclohexane and methyl cyclohexane. To unravel the transport mechanism properly, the pressure effect of flux and retentions was thoroughly investigated. The retention results showed in general a very different behaviour in different ranges of polarity: at low solvent polarity, retentions are relatively low, varying with pressure and solvent polarity; at high solvent polarity, retentions are relatively high, and independent of pressure and solvent polarity. The Spiegler-Kedem theory, taking into account both diffusion and convection transport mechanisms, was used as a basis for a fundamental explanation of the results and explaining the competing contribution of diffusion and convection in solute transport. Finally, this study demonstrates the importance of all solvent-membrane-solute interactions in the OSN transport, but also shows how they can be manipulated to enhance the membrane performance.
