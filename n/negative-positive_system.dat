5000|$|... 1841: CalotypeWilliam Henry Fox Talbot {{invented the}} <b>negative-positive</b> <b>system</b> of {{photography}} commonly used today. He first developed the Talbotype, which used silver chloride to sensitize paper. After improving {{the process by}} using silver iodide, he renamed it Calotype. The process could produce many positive images, {{but they were not}} as sharp because they were printed on fibrous paper rather than glass.|$|E
