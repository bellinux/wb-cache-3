40|$|Terminal motor {{innervation}} and the histochemical {{profile of}} muscle fibers were investigated, {{before and after}} sciatic <b>nerve</b> <b>crushing,</b> in 1 - to 150 -day-old myopathic hamsters. The observed morphologic abnormalities in terminal motor innervation were of varying degree prior to the nerve injury. These abnormalities were found {{in close proximity to}} lesions of the myofibers, and became more pronounced with age and the progression of the disease process. Collateral ramification of healthy axons occurred in hamsters of 120 days of age with reinnervation of damaged muscle fibers. When submitted to sciatic <b>nerve</b> <b>crushing,</b> myopathic hamsters showed an ability to regenerate and reinnervate the subneural apparatuses. The regenerative process in these animals was essentially the same as in normal, sciatic nerve-crushed hamsters. Thus, it was concluded that the morphologic changes in terminal motor innervation were secondary to muscle cell degeneration. © 1980, All rights reserved.

40|$|Objectives: To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and MSCs mixed with Matrixen as a cell carrier on the erectile dysfunction caused by bilateral cavernous <b>nerve</b> <b>crushing</b> injury. Materials and Methods: White male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into 4 groups: sham-operated control group (n = 5), bilateral cavernous <b>nerve</b> <b>crushing</b> group (BCNC group, n = 10), BCNC administered with MSCs group (n = 10, 1 x 106 in 20 µL), BCNC administered with Matrixen group (n = 10. 1 x 106 in 20 µL), BCNC administered with MSCs/Matrixen group (n = 10. 1 x 106 in 20 µL). After functional assessment at 4 weeks, major pelvic ganglion (MPG) and penile tissue were collected. Immunofl uorescent stai-ning of MPG was performed with PKH 26 and Tuj 1. Western blot analysis of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) were done in corpus cavernosum. Results: ICP/MAP ratios of BCNC with MSCs and MSCs/Matrixen groups were signifi-cantly increased compared with BCNC and BCNC with Matrixen group. Moreover, ICP/ MAP ratios of MSCs/Matrixen group were signifi cantly increased compared with BCNC with MSCs group. In MPG, the more implantation of MSCs and increased expression of nerve cells were observed in MSCs/Matrixen group compared with BCNC with MSCs group.

Hindlimb motor function was evaluated weekly by assessing sciatic functional indices, and the proximal and distal portions of the sciatic nerve were used for morphometric analysis. RESULTS: At 13 weeks post-injury, the distal nerve portion of all injured groups and the proximal nerve portion of the diabetic with sciatic <b>nerve</b> <b>crush</b> group presented altered morphometric parameters such as decreased myelinated fiber diameter (, 7. 4 ¡ 0. 3 mm vs, 4. 8 ¡ 0. 2 mm), axonal diameter (, 5 ¡ 0. 2 mm vs, 3. 5 ¡ 0. 1 mm) and myelin sheath thickness (, 1. 2 ¡ 0. 07 mm vs, 0. 65 ¡ 0. 07 mm) {{and an increase in}} the percentage of area occupied by endoneurium (, 28 ¡ 3 % vs, 60 ¡ 3 %). In addition, in the non-diabetic with sciatic <b>nerve</b> <b>crush</b> group the proximal nerve portion showed a decreased myelinated fiber diameter (7. 4 ¡ 0. 3 mm vs 5. 8 ¡ 0. 3 mm) and myelin sheath thickness (1. 29 ¡ 0. 08 mm vs 0. 92 ¡ 0. 08 mm). The non-diabetic with sciatic <b>nerve</b> <b>crush,</b> trained non-diabetic with sciatic <b>nerve</b> <b>crush,</b> diabetic with sciatic <b>nerve</b> <b>crush</b> and trained diabetic with sciatic <b>nerve</b> <b>crush</b> groups showed normal sciatic functional index from the 4 th, 4 th, 9 th and 7 th week post-injury, respectively. Morphometric alterations in the proximal nerve portion of the diabetic with sciatic <b>nerve</b> <b>crush</b> and non-diabetic with sciatic <b>nerve</b> <b>crush</b> groups were either prevented or reverted to values similar to the non-diabetic group by treadmill training. CONCLUSION: Diabetic condition promoted delay in sciatic nerve regeneration.

Our current research was designed to investigate the change of the recurrent inhibitory function in the spinal cord after the peripheral <b>nerve</b> <b>crush</b> injury in neonatal rat. Sciatic <b>nerve</b> <b>crush</b> was performed on 5 -day-old rat puppies and the recurrent inhibition between lateral gastrocnemius-soleus (LG-S) and medial gastrocnemius (MG) motor pools was assessed by conditioning monosynaptic reflexes (MSR) elicited from the sectioned dorsal roots and recorded either from the LG-S and MG nerves by antidromic stimulation of the synergist muscle nerve. Our results demonstrated that the MSR recorded from both LG-S or MG nerves had larger amplitude and longer latency after neonatal sciatic <b>nerve</b> <b>crush.</b> The RI in both LG-S and MG motoneuron pools was significantly reduced to virtual loss (15 – 20 % of the normal RI size) even after a long recovery period upto 30 weeks after <b>nerve</b> <b>crush.</b> Further, the degree of the RI reduction after tibial <b>nerve</b> <b>crush</b> was much less than that after sciatic <b>nerve</b> <b>crush</b> indicatig that the neuron-muscle disconnection time {{is vital to the}} recovery of the spinal neuronal circuit function during reinnervation. In addition, sciatic <b>nerve</b> <b>crush</b> injury did not cause any spinal motor neuron loss but severally damaged peripheral muscle structure and function. In conclusion, our results suggest that peripheral nerve injury during neonatal early development period would cause a more sever spinal cord inhibitory circuit damage, particularly to the Renshaw recurrent inhibition pathway, which might be the target of neuroregeneration therapy...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background We have {{previously}} {{shown that the}} slow Wallerian degeneration mutation, whilst delaying axonal degeneration after optic <b>nerve</b> <b>crush,</b> does not protect retinal ganglion cell (RGC) bodies in adult rats. To test {{the effects of a}} combination approach protecting both axons and cell bodies we performed combined optic <b>nerve</b> <b>crush</b> and lens injury, which results in both enhanced RGC survival as well as axon regeneration past the lesion site in wildtype animals. Results As previously reported we found that the Wld S mutation does not protect RGC bodies after optic <b>nerve</b> <b>crush</b> alone. Surprisingly, we found that Wld S transgenic rats did not exhibit the enhanced RGC survival response after combined optic <b>nerve</b> <b>crush</b> and lens injury that was observed in wildtype rats. RGC axon regeneration past the optic nerve lesion site was, however, similar in Wld S and wildtypes. Furthermore, activation of retinal glia, previously shown to be associated with enhanced RGC survival and axon regeneration after optic <b>nerve</b> <b>crush</b> and lens injury, was unaffected in Wld S transgenic rats. Conclusions RGC axon regeneration is similar between Wld S transgenic and wildtype rats, but Wld S transgenic rats do not exhibit enhanced RGC survival after combined optic <b>nerve</b> <b>crush</b> and lens injury suggesting that the neuroprotective effects of lens injury on RGC survival may be limited by the Wld S protein. </p...|$|R

The {{purpose of the present}} study was to examine the ability of neurons in abdominal sympathetic ganglia to regenerate after axonal injury and to determine whether reinnervation occurs after the removal of ganglia. Axons from the celiac ganglion and superior mesenteric ganglion complex (CG/SMG) of adult female BALB/c mice were crushed or the ganglion complex was removed. Immunohistochemistry, western blotting and in situ hybridization were performed to examine the changes in tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and growth-associated protein 43 (GAP- 43) in the duodenum and the sympathetic ganglia. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling and injection of the tracer dye, fluorogold were also performed. After crushing the nerve, TH in the duodenum disappeared and reappeared within 90 days. In the CG/SMG, TH decreased and increased as in the duodenum, while the expression of GAP- 43 changed in the opposite direction. <b>Nerve</b> <b>crushing</b> caused cell death to limited number of neurons in the CG/SMG. The removal of CG/SMG decreased TH in the duodenum and stomach, but 180 days later TH-positive innervation was recovered. Fluorogold injection revealed that the inferior mesenteric ganglion reinnervated the stomach. Therefore, postganglionic sympathetic nerves in the abdomen are able to regenerate and reinnervation occurs even after the removal of sympathetic ganglia...|$|E

40|$|The {{mammalian}} {{central nervous}} system (CNS) is unable to regenerate. In contrast, the CNS of fish, including the visual system, is able to regenerate after damage. Moreover, the fish visual system grows continuously throughout {{the life of the}} animal, and it is therefore an excellent model to analyze processes of myelination and re-myelination after an injury. Here we analyze Sox 10 + oligodendrocytes in the goldfish retina and optic nerve in controls and after two kinds of injuries: cryolesion of the peripheral growing zone and crushing of the optic nerve. We also analyze changes in a major component of myelin, myelin basic protein (MBP), as a marker for myelinated axons. Our results show that Sox 10 + oligodendrocytes are located in the retinal nerve fiber layer and along the whole length of the optic nerve. MBP was found to occupy a similar location, although its loose appearance in the retina differed from the highly organized MBP+ axon bundles in the optic nerve. After optic <b>nerve</b> <b>crushing,</b> the number of Sox 10 + cells decreased in the crushed area and in the optic nerve head. Consistent with this, myelination was highly reduced in both areas. In contrast, after cryolesion we did not find changes in the Sox 10 + population, although we did detect some MBP- degenerating areas. We show that these modifications in Sox 10 + oligodendrocytes are consistent with their role in oligodendrocyte identity, maintenance and survival, and we propose the optic nerve head as an excellent area for research aimed at better understanding of de- and remyelination processes...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to examine the {{physiological}} consequences of a unilateral infraorbital nerve lesion and its regeneration at different levels of the somatosensory neuraxis. In animals whose right infraorbital <b>nerve</b> had been <b>crushed,</b> a large unresponsive area was found in the main brainstem trigeminal nucleus (Pr 5). Responses evoked by ipsilateral vibrissal deflection in the middle of Pr 5 reappeared only on days 22 - 35 after the nerve had been transected, whereas recovery from the <b>nerve</b> <b>crush</b> took only 7 - 9 days. However, no sign of short-term neuronal plasticity was observed in Pr 5 after peripheral nerve injury. An enlargement of the receptive fields in two-thirds of the units and a lengthening in the delay of the evoked responses were observed as long-term plastic changes in Pr 5 neurons after peripheral-nerve regeneration. In the ventral posteromedial nucleus of the thalamus (VPM) of partly denervated animals, however, only minutes or hours after the <b>nerve</b> <b>crush,</b> certain units were found to respond in some cases not only to the vibrissae, but also to mechanical stimulation of the face over the eye (two units), the nose (one unit), and the midline (one unit). Apart from the experiments involving incomplete denervation, the vibrissal representation areas of the VPM were unresponsive to stimulation of both the vibrissae and other parts of the face until nerve regeneration had occurred. In the somatosensory cortex, an infraorbital <b>nerve</b> <b>crush</b> immediately resulted in a large cortical area being unresponsive to vibrissal deflection. It was noteworthy, however, that shortly after the <b>nerve</b> <b>crush,</b> this large unresponsive whisker representation cortical area was invaded from the rostromedial direction by responses evoked by stimulation of the forepaw digits. In spite of the reappearance of vibrissa-evoked responses 7 - 10 days after the <b>nerve</b> <b>crush,</b> an expanded digital representation could still be observed 3 weeks after the <b>nerve</b> <b>crush,</b> resulting in an overlapping area of digital and vibrissal representations.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{peripheral}} nerve lesions on the membrane and synaptic properties of motoneurones have been extensively studied. However, minimal information exists {{about how these}} alterations finally influence discharge activity and motor output under physiological afferent drive. The aim of this work was to evaluate the effect of hypoglossal (XIIth) <b>nerve</b> <b>crushing</b> on hypoglossal motoneurone (HMN) discharge {{in response to the}} basal inspiratory afferent drive and its chemosensory modulation by CO 2. The evolution of the lesion was assessed by recording the compound muscle action potential evoked by XIIth nerve stimulation, which was lost on crushing and then recovered gradually to control values from the second to fourth weeks post-lesion. Basal inspiratory activities recorded 7 days post-injury in the nerve proximal to the lesion site, and in the nucleus, were reduced by 51. 6 % and 35. 8 %, respectively. Single unit antidromic latencies were lengthened by lesion, and unusually high stimulation intensities were frequently required to elicit antidromic spikes. Likewise, inspiratory modulation of unitary discharge under conditions in which chemoreceptor drive was varied by altering end-tidal CO 2 was reduced by more than 60 %. Although the general recruitment scheme was preserved after XIIth nerve lesion, we noticed an increased proportion of low-threshold units and a reduced recruitment gain across the physiological range. Immunohistochemical staining of synaptophysin in the hypoglossal nuclei revealed significant reductions of this synaptic marker after nerve injury. Morphological and functional alterations recovered with muscle re-innervation. Thus, we report here that nerve lesion induced changes in the basal activity and discharge modulation of HMNs, concurrent with the loss of afferent inputs. Nevertheless, we suggest that an increase in membrane excitability, reported by others, and in the proportion of low-threshold units, could serve to preserve minimal electrical activity, prevent degeneration and favour axonal regeneration...|$|E
40|$|Protein {{compositional}} {{and functional}} differences exist between longitudinal and junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) {{in relation to}} Ca transport and to Ca release. In light of this knowledge, we have reinvestigated the effects of denervation on SR of rabbit gastrocnemius, a predominantly fast muscle. Electron microscopy of 2 -weeks denervated muscle showed proliferation of transverse tubules (TT), forming junctional contacts with SR terminal cisternae (TC). At coincident periods, the yield of muscle microsomes was increased, and their fractionation by sucrose-density centrifugation demonstrated a relative increase of heavy vesicles. Thin-section electron microscopy of heavy SR from denervated muscle showed an increased number of vesicles containing calsequestrin (CS) as compared with control muscle. Electrophoretic analysis confirmed the relative decrease of Ca-ATPase protein and the striking increase of CS both in total microsomes and in heavy SR vesicles. Calcium loading and Ca-ATPase activity {{as well as the}} density of Ca-ATPase protein were decreased to a similar extent (20 - 30 %) in denervated muscle microsomes. Stimulation of Ca-ATPase activity by Ca-ionophore A 23187 showed that the vesicles were tightly sealed. When probed by competitive ELISA with antibody to SR Ca-ATPase from pure fast muscle, the Ca-ATPase of denervated microsomes was found to be highly cross reactive. Cleveland's peptide maps of the Ca-ATPase protein after partial digestion with S. aureus V 8 protease also showed no significant change after denervation. Changes in cholesterol content and in the ratio of Mg-ATPase to Ca-ATPase activity of denervated muscle microsomes indicated a 4 -fold increase of TT protein, i. e., from about 3 % to not more than 12 % of total protein, at 2 weeks after denervation. All these changes were totally reversed upon reinnervation of muscle fibers, and the consequent muscle recovery, as obtained by <b>nerve</b> <b>crushing</b> instead of nerve sectioning. From these results, we conclude that denervated adult fast muscle, similarly to immature fast muscle, contains more junctional SR. However, the molecular and catalytic properties of the Ca-ATPase are unaffected by denervation...|$|E
40|$|Peripheral nerve injury {{results in}} {{retrograde}} cell body-related {{changes in the}} spinal motoneurons that {{will contribute to the}} regenerative response of their axons. Successful functional recovery also depends on molecular events mediated by innate immune response during Wallerian degeneration in the nerve microenvironment. A previous study in our lab demonstrated that TLR 2 and 4 develop opposite effects on synaptic stability in the spinal cord after peripheral nerve injury. Therefore, we suggested that the better preservation of spinal cord microenvironment would positively influence distal axonal regrowth. In this context, the present work aimed to investigate the influence of TLR 2 and TLR 4 on regeneration and functional recovery after peripheral nerve injury. Methods: Eighty-eight mice were anesthetized and subjected to unilateral sciatic nerve crush (C 3 H/HeJ, n = 22, C 3 H/HePas, n = 22; C 57 Bl 6 /J, n = 22 and TLR 2 (-/-), n = 22). After the appropriate survival times (3, 7, 14 days, and 5 weeks), all mice were killed and the sciatic nerves and tibialis cranialis muscles were processed for immunohistochemistry and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Gait analysis, after sciatic <b>nerve</b> <b>crushing,</b> was performed in another set of mice (minimum of n = 8 per group), by using the walking track test (CatWalk system). Results: TLR 4 mutant mice presented greater functional recovery as well as an enhanced p 75 (NTR) and neurofilament protein expression as compared to the wild-type strain. Moreover, the better functional recovery in mutant mice was correlated to a greater number of nerve terminal sprouts. Knockout mice for TLR 2 exhibited 30 % greater number of degenerated axons in the distal stump of the sciatic nerve and a decreased p 75 NTR and neurofilament protein expression compared to the wild type. However, the absence of TLR 2 receptor did not influence the overall functional recovery. End-point equivalent functional recovery in transgenic mice may be a result of enhanced axonal diameter found at 2 weeks after lesion. Conclusions: Altogether, the present results indicate that the lack of TLR 2 or the absence of functional TLR 4 does affect the nerve regeneration process; however, such changes are minimized through different compensatory mechanisms, resulting in similar motor function recovery, as compared to wild-type mice. These findings contribute to the concept that innate immune-related molecules influence peripheral nerve regeneration by concurrently participating in processes taking place both at the CNS and PNS...|$|E

This study used longitudinal retinal imaging of mice expressing cyan fluorescent protein under control of the Thy- 1 promoter (Thy 1 -CFP mice) {{to determine how the}} &# 945; 2 -adrenergic agonist brimonidine influences loss of Thy 1 promoter activation. 				 				 					 						Methods 					Baseline images of the fluorescent retinal neurons in 30 Thy 1 -CFP mice were obtained using a modified confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscope. Next, brimonidine (100 ug/kg, IP) was administered either one time immediately after optic <b>nerve</b> <b>crush,</b> or immediately after optic <b>nerve</b> <b>crush</b> and then every 2 days for four weeks. A control group received a single saline injection immediately after optic <b>nerve</b> <b>crush.</b> All animals were imaged weekly for four weeks after optic <b>nerve</b> <b>crush.</b> Loss of fluorescent retinal neurons within specific retinal areas was determined by counting. 				 				 					 						Results 					At one week after optic <b>nerve</b> <b>crush,</b> the proportion of fluorescent retinal neurons retaining fluorescence was 44 &# 177; 7 % of baseline in control mice, 51 &# 177; 6 % after one brimonidine treatment, and 55 &# 177; 6 % after brimonidine treatment every other day (P< 0. 05 for both brimonidine treatment groups compared to the control group). Subsequently, the number of fluorescent retinal neurons in the group that received one treatment differed insignificantly from the control group. In contrast, the number of fluorescent retinal neurons in the group that received repeated brimonidine treatments was greater than the control group by 28 % at two weeks after crush and by 32 % at three weeks after crush (P< 0. 05 at both time points). Rate analysis showed that brimonidine slowed the initial rate of fluorescent cell decline in the animals that received multiple treatments (P< 0. 05). Differences in the rate of loss among the treatment groups were insignificant after the second week. 				 				 					 						Conclusion 					Repeated brimonidine treatments protect against loss of fluorescence within fluorescent retinal neurons of Thy 1 -CFP mice after optic <b>nerve</b> <b>crush.</b> As most of fluorescent retinal neurons in this system are RGCs, these findings indicate that repeated brimonidine treatments may protect RGC health following optic <b>nerve</b> <b>crush...</b>|$|R
40|$|Our {{previous}} electrophysiological study {{demonstrated that}} amiloride-sensitive (AS) and-insensitive (AI) components of NaCl responses recovered differentially after the mouse chorda tympani (CT) was crushed. AI responses reappeared earlier (at 3 {{weeks after the}} <b>nerve</b> <b>crush)</b> than did AS ones (at 4 weeks). This and other results suggested that two salt-responsive systems were differentially and independently reformed after <b>nerve</b> <b>crush.</b> To investigate the molecular mechanisms of formation of the salt responsive systems, we examined expression patterns of three subunits (a, b and c) of the amiloride-sensitive epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC) in mouse taste cells after CT <b>nerve</b> <b>crush</b> by using in situ hybridization (ISH) analysis. The results showed that all three ENaC subunits, as well as a-gustducin, a marker of differentiated taste cells, were expressed in a subset of taste bud cells from an early stage (1 – 2 weeks) after <b>nerve</b> <b>crush,</b> although these taste buds were smaller and fewer in number than for control mice. At 3 weeks, {{the mean number of}} each ENaC subunit and a-gustducin mRNA-positive cells per taste bud reached the control level. Also, the size of taste buds became {{similar to those of the}} control mice at this time. Our previous electrophys-iological study demonstrated that at 2 weeks no significant response of the nerve to chemical stimuli was observed. Thus ENaC subunits appear to be expressed prior to the reappearance of AI and AS neural responses after CT <b>nerve</b> <b>crush.</b> These results support the view that differentiation of taste cells into AS or AI cells is initiated prior to synapse formation...|$|R
40|$|Studies {{have shown}} that sensory nerve damage can {{activate}} the p 38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, but whether {{the same type of}} nerve injury after exercise activates the p 38 MAPK pathway remains unclear.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: The {{effects of}} {{locomotor}} training (LT) on skeletal muscle after {{peripheral nerve injury}} and acetylcholinesterase deficiency are not well documented. METHODS: We determined the effects of LT on mouse soleus muscle performance after sciatic nerve transection with excision (full and permanent denervation), nerve transection (partial functional reinnervation), <b>nerve</b> <b>crush</b> (full denervation with full functional reinnervation), and acetylcholinesterase deficiency (alteration in neuromuscular junction functioning). RESULTS: We found no significant effect of LT on the recovery of soleus muscle weight, maximal force in response to muscle stimulation, and fatigue resistance after nerve transection with or without excision. However, LT significantly increased soleus muscle fatigue resistance after <b>nerve</b> <b>crush</b> and acetylcholinesterase deficiency.

40|$|Object. The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine whether choline acetyl {{transferase}} (ChAT) staining can be used for assessing the rate of motor neuron regeneration at an early phase of axon outgrowth. Methods. The authors developed a new sciatic <b>nerve</b> <b>crush</b> model in adult mice. In this model, in addition to performing a sciatic <b>nerve</b> <b>crush</b> injury, the authors excised the ipsilateral lumbar L 3 - 6 dorsal root ganglion (DRG), which resulted in degeneration of the sensory fibers entering into the sciatic <b>nerve.</b> <b>Crushed</b> <b>nerve</b> sections obtained at Day 3 or Day 7 postinjury were analyzed by means of immunostaining. Results. The immunostaining showed that ChAT, a motor axon-specific antigen, was totally co-localized with growth-associated protein 43 (GAP- 43), which is expressed in regenerating nerves and transported into growth cones. Conclusions. Our results suggest that measuring the length of motor axon outgrowth by ChAT immunostaining is reliable. ChAT staining provides a more convenient method for evaluating the rate of motor axon outgrowth in a mixed nerve. ©AANS, 2014. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to monitor the {{influence}} of chronic stress on functional recovery from a sciatic <b>nerve</b> <b>crush</b> lesion in the rat. Male Wistar rats underwent standard unilateral sciatic <b>nerve</b> <b>crush.</b> Subsequently, chronic stress was induced during the recovery phase using a daily 30 min shock box session where rats received three electric footshocks each session (0. 5 sec, 1 mA). Reduced body weight gain, adrenal gland hypertrophy, and thymus involution indicated that the stress rats were chronically stressed. Evaluation of sensorimotor function revealed significant differences in recovery between control and stress groups. Correlational analysis of individual stress rats indicated that recovery of the walking pattern was negatively correlated with adrenal gland and medulla enlargement, thymus involution, and plasma levels of adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) and corticosterone 45 min following the final stress session. In control rats, the index of sciatic nerve function (SF index, expressed as the difference between the injured paw and the intact contralateral paw as a percentage) was significantly correlated with adrenal medulla weight only. The present study reveals that chronic intermittent footshock stress impedes sensorimotor recovery following a sciatic <b>nerve</b> <b>crush</b> lesion and that the consequences of chronic intermittent stress are individually determined. We suggest that the quality of functional locomotor recovery after <b>nerve</b> <b>crush</b> lesion is related to the adaptive capacity or coping style of the individual rat...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Retinal {{ganglion}} cell (RGC) {{death is}} the final consequence of many blinding diseases, where there is considerable variation in the time course and severity of RGC loss. Indeed, this process appears {{to be influenced by}} a wide variety of genetic and environmental factors. In this study we explored the genetic basis for differences in ganglion cell death in two inbred strains of mice. Results We found that RGCs are more susceptible to death following optic <b>nerve</b> <b>crush</b> in C 57 BL/ 6 J mice (54 % survival) than in DBA/ 2 J mice (62 % survival). Using the Illumina Mouse- 6 microarray, we identified 1, 580 genes with significant change in expression following optic <b>nerve</b> <b>crush</b> in these two strains of mice. Our analysis of the changes occurring after optic <b>nerve</b> <b>crush</b> demonstrated that the greatest amount of change (44 % of the variance) was due to the injury itself. This included changes associated with ganglion cell death, reactive gliosis, and abortive regeneration. The second pattern of gene changes (23 % of the variance) was primarily related to differences in gene expressions observed between the C 57 BL/ 6 J and DBA/ 2 J mouse strains. The remaining changes in gene expression represent interactions between the effects of optic <b>nerve</b> <b>crush</b> and the genetic background of the mouse. We extracted one genetic network from this dataset that appears to be related to tissue remodeling. One of the most intriguing sets of changes included members of the crystallin family of genes, which may represent a signature of pathways modulating the susceptibility of cells to death. Conclusion Differential responses to optic <b>nerve</b> <b>crush</b> between two widely used strains of mice were used to define molecular networks associated with ganglion cell death and reactive gliosis. These results form the basis for our continuing interest in the modifiers of retinal injury. </p...|$|R

Microglial/macrophage Iba- 1 and astrocytic GFAP expression, increased in the dorsal horn of <b>nerve</b> <b>crushed</b> animals, was, however, effectively attenuated by propentofylline.

The enzyme activities followed a similar time course, with initial increases 2 - 3 days following <b>nerve</b> <b>crush,</b> peak activity at 4 days, and a gradual return to basal levels by day 21.

Activities of two enzymes of intermediary metabolism, pyruvate kinase (EC 2. 7. 1. 40) and lactic dehydrogenase (EC 1. 1. 1. 27), were not altered, indicating that the coordinate increases in nucleoside and nucleotide kinase activities were specific responses to the nerve injury. The increased labeling could not be explained by altered phosphohydrolytic activities. The nature of the enhancement was further studied in UDP kinase, the most active of the kinases examined. Neither low-molecular-weight components nor substrate availability {{could account for the}} observed increase in UDP kinase in the 4 day post-crush retinas. The K m, for UDP was unaltered, and a mixing experiment did not support the possibility that stimulatory or inhibitory factors played a role.
