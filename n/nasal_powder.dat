40|$|AbstractIn {{this work}} <b>nasal</b> <b>powder</b> {{formulations}} of thalidomide were designed and studied {{to be used}} by persons affected by hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia as a complementary anti-epistaxis therapy, with the goal of sustaining the effect obtained with thalidomide oral treatment after its discontinuation for adverse effects. Three nasal powders were prepared using as carriers β-CD or its more hydrophilic derivatives such as hydropropyl-β-CD and sulphobutylether-β-CD and tested with respect to technological and biopharmaceutical features after emission with active and passive <b>nasal</b> <b>powder</b> devices. For all formulated powders, improved dissolution rate was found compared to that of the raw material, making thalidomide promptly available in the nasal environment at a concentration favouring an accumulation in the mucosa. The very limited transmucosal transport measured in vitro suggests a low likelihood of significant systemic absorption. The topical action on bleeding could benefit from the poor absorption and from the fact that about 2 – 3 % of the thalidomide applied on the nasal mucosa was accumulated within the tissue, particularly with the β-CD <b>nasal</b> <b>powder...</b>|$|E
40|$|Nasal {{administration}} has {{potential for the}} treatment of indications requiring a fast onset of effect or for drugs with low oral bioavailability. Liquid nasal sprays are relatively common, but can be associated with suboptimal absorption from the nasal cavity; this thesis shows that nasal absorption can be significantly enhanced with a dry powder formulation. It was shown that interactive mixtures, consisting of fine drug particles adhered to the surface of mucoadhesive carrier particles, could be created in a particle size suitable for nasal administration. Sodium starch glycolate (SSG), a common tablet excipient, was used as carrier material. In vitro evaluation of the formulation indicated that the mucoadhesion of the carrier was unlikely to be affected by the addition of a drug. The powder formulation did not improve the in vitro transfer of dihydroergotamine across porcine nasal mucosa compared with a liquid formulation; however, the results were associated with methodological shortcomings. The binding of model substances to SSG and three other excipients was evaluated. Ion exchange interactions were for example detected between SSG and cationic drugs, but these interactions were most extensive at low salt concentrations and should unlikely affect in vivo bioavailability at physiological salt concentrations. Absorption of the peptide drug desmopressin from the SSG nasal formulation, from a novel sublingual tablet formulation and from a commercial nasal liquid spray was evaluated in a clinical trial. While no improvement over the liquid spray was seen with the sublingual tablet, plasma concentrations after the <b>nasal</b> <b>powder</b> formulation were three times higher than those after the liquid spray. All formulations were well accepted by the volunteers. The use of currently available mucoadhesive carrier particles in interactive mixtures offers potential for a new method of producing <b>nasal</b> <b>powder</b> formulations that should also be applicable to large scale production...|$|E

40|$|The paper briefly {{illustrates}} several approaches {{applied in}} delivering particulate drugs as powders. Microparticulate drug powders {{are difficult to}} manipulate with respect to dosage form preparation, particularly when they have very small size as this leads to poor flow and packing properties. When the dosage form performance resides {{on the presence of}} individual intact drug particles, the particle characteristics have to be retained in their original state, i. e., not altered during manufacturing and/or within the dosage form. There are several examples of dry powder dosage forms intended for different administration routes whose performance is strictly dependent on particle characteristics. In addition, the preparation of the finished dosage form is dependent on powder properties. The paper addresses dry powder formulations with special focus on oral powders mainly for elderly people or children, <b>nasal</b> <b>powders</b> and inhalation dry powders. These dosage forms are very attractive for both researchers and companies. Their formulation requires deep investigation, mainly in order to define particle structure and performance.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to study the {{characteristics}} of powders of morphine HCl suitable for nasal administration to be employed for pain treatment as alternative to injection. Primary microparticles of morphine were prepared by spray drying of aqueous drug solutions using sugars or sugar derivatives as drying protectors and particle shapers. The spray drying procedure modified morphine crystallinity making the substance amorphous and affecting its stability in dependence on the excipient employed. A tendency of the spray-dried powders to turn to varying degrees of yellow was observed. Tumbling the powder in a rotating pan allowed the agglomeration of the primary microparticles. Agglomerates were also obtained by tumbling a mixture of morphine crystals and spray-dried microparticles of excipients, with advantages for {{the stability of the}} preparation. A nasal device quantitatively insufflated all the morphine agglomerates. The in vitro transport of morphine through rabbit nasal mucosa was faster using <b>nasal</b> <b>powders</b> than with the saturated solution of morphine. Lactose was the most effective excipient for agglomerate manufacturing and delivery of spray-dried morphine.

40|$|Abstract In {{the present}} study, a <b>nasal</b> <b>powder</b> of the {{antidiuretic}} peptide desmopressin (DDAVP) formulated as chimera agglomerates was studied to improve drug bioavailability {{and provide a}} flexible drug product. Firstly, DDAVP was spray-dried along with mannitol and lecithin to produce primary microparticles capable of instantaneous dissolution in water. The chimera agglomerates were spontaneously formed by mechanically vibrating the microparticles on two stacked sieves. Agglomerate formation and strength were favored {{by the presence of}} lecithin. Drug content and dissolution rate remained unmodified after agglomeration. However, owing to the agglomerate larger size, powder flowability was greatly improved in comparison with the original microparticles, allowing accurate powder dosing into the nasal delivery device. DDAVP in vitro permeation across excised rabbit nasal mucosa from the agglomerates was significantly higher than that obtained from a commercial liquid nasal spray. In rats, intranasal DDAVP agglomerates allowed for efficient administration with almost 80...|$|E
40|$|The {{treatment}} of {{central nervous system}} diseases is very difficult due to the inability of drugs to permeate into the brain from the bloodstream.

Spray-freeze-drying (SFD) particles suitable for nasal delivery were characterized for physico-chemical properties and stability. Mucoadhesive compounds (MA) were characterized for their effects on nasal residence time of vaccine powders in rats compared with published in vitro data and elicited immune responses. SFD particles (D 50 = 26. 9 µm) were spherical with a specific surface area of 1. 25 m 2 /g. Thermal analysis indicated SFD powders were amorphous and demonstrated improved stability with respect to liquid formulations under various storage conditions. In vitro physico-chemical studies and in vivo scintigraphic imaging experiments indicated sodium alginate (SA) and carboxymethylcellulose-high molecular weight (CMC-HMW) powder formulations most significantly increased residence time in Brown Norway rats. Intramuscular delivery provided equivalent serum antibody titers to intranasal (IN) powder without MA, {{in the presence of}} CMC-HMW, SA, and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC-HMW) after initial dosing and all formulations except IN powder with chitosan after boosting.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the effect of polymeric microcarriers on the in vivo intranasal uptake of an anti-migraine drug for brain targeting. Mucoadhesive powder formulations consisted of antimigraine drug, zolmitriptan, and chitosans (various molecular weights and types) or hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC). Their suitability for nasal administration was evaluated by in vitro and ex vivo mucoadhesion and permeation tests. The formulations based on chitosan glutamate (CG) or HPMC were tested in vivo because they showed good mucoadhesive properties and altered the permeation rate of the drug. The in vivo results from intravenous infusion and nasal aqueous suspension of the drug or <b>nasal</b> particulate <b>powders</b> were compared. The plasmatic AUC values obtained within 8 h following intravenous administration appeared about three times higher than those obtained by nasal administration, independent of the formulations. Zolmitriptan concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid obtained from nasal and intravenous administrations were, respectively, 30 and 90 times lower than the concentrations of the drug in the blood. Thus, nasal administration potentiated the central zolmitriptan activity, allowing a reduction in the drug peripheral levels, with respect to the intravenous administration.

40|$|The overall {{objectives}} {{of this research}} project were i) to develop and evaluate methods of characterizing nasal spray products using realistic nasal airway models as more clinically relevant in vitro tools and ii) to develop and evaluate a novel high-efficiency antibiotic nanoparticle dry powder formulation and delivery device. Two physically realistic nasal airway models {{were used to assess}} the effects of patient-use experimental conditions, nasal airway geometry and formulation / device properties on the delivery efficiency of nasal spray products. There was a large variability in drug delivery to the middle passages ranging from 17 – 57 % and 47 – 77 % with respect to patient use conditions for the two nasal airway geometries. The patient use variables of nasal spray position, head angle and nasal inhalation timing with respect to spray actuation were found to be significant in determining nasal valve penetration and middle passage deposition of Nasonex®. The developed test methods were able to reproducibly generate similar nasal deposition profiles for nasal spray products with similar plume and droplet characteristics. Differences in spray plume geometry (smaller plume diameter resulted in higher middle passage drug delivery) were observed to have more influence on regional nasal drug deposition than changes to droplet size for mometasone furoate formulations in the realistic airway models. Ciprofloxacin nanoparticles with a mean (SD) volume diameter of 120 (10) nm suitable for penetration through mucus and biofilm layers were prepared using sonocrystallization technique. These ciprofloxacin nanoparticles were then spray dried in a PVP K 30 matrix to form nanocomposite particles with a mean (SD) volume diameter of 5. 6 (0. 1) µm.

40|$|AbstractAerosol {{vaccination}} via the mucosa targets an epithelium {{critical to}} host defence against inhaled pathogens, potentially avoids needle injection, and provides an exciting {{opportunity in the}} development of stable dry powder vaccine formulations. Specialised cells in the mucosa are able to take up and guide antigens directly to immune cells. In contrast to soluble antigen formulations, particles with antigen also provoke a local sIgA mediated immune response before being presented to the systemic immune system. In this study, particles containing the model antigen BSA and chitosan as stabiliser with adjuvant activity are produced by spray drying. The compatibility and uptake of these particles via the respiratory epithelium is determined in vitro on Calu- 3 cells. The in vitro deposition studies are performed in a nasal cast made from CT scan data using a novel <b>nasal</b> dry <b>powder</b> device. The deposition profile is optimised by the use of interactive mixtures with a low separation capacity. The spray drying process results in spherical particles with a size in the low micrometer range (x 50 3 μm), which are well tolerated when administered to the cells and which are readily taken up. As the particles have to be big enough to be retained in the appropriate place in the respiratory tract (e. g. the nasal cavity) to be taken up efficiently, the primary particles are too small. Deposition studies show a high fraction of almost 56 % transiting the nose and being capable of inhalation. This fraction can be reduced by utilising an interactive mixture with a carrier, where only 5 % of the antigen carrying particles leave the nasal cavity. Particulate vaccine formulations are a promising formulation approach for mucosal vaccination targeting the nasal mucosa. With small antigen carrying particles immobilised on carrier particles, the antigen is delivered exclusively to the nose...|$|R

Besides nasal application, topical, systemic and central effects are also available. Nasal powders (NPs) have better adhesion due to the additive polymers that may be, eg, gelling or good wettability agents; thus, their bioavailability is better compared to the liquid formulations. Using nanoparticles, innovative and more efficient products can be achieved, which {{may lead to the}} improvement of different therapies. The aim {{of this study was to}} produce NP formulations containing lamotrigine (LAM) as interactive physical mixtures and nanosized LAM-based formulations.

40|$|In this work, a {{dry powder}} nano-in-microparticle (NiM) vaccine {{formulation}} {{was developed by}} using a very gentle two-step-production method involving, first, an ionic gelation step to achieve primary nanoparticles followed by a spray drying step to gain the final dry powder vaccine formulation. The biopolymer chitosan was chosen as adjuvant and particle forming excipient because of its mucoadhesive and adjuvant properties. At first, different chitosan qualities were analysed {{with respect to their}} polymer properties like the molecular weight and the degree of deacetylation. Subsequently, an in vivo study (in cooperation with the University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand) was conducted in order to evaluate the adjuvant activity of three different chitosan qualities after s. c. administration. For this, two of the chitosans used were spray dried prior to the application and then administered as PBS soluble hydrochloride salts, the third quality was used as received and thus given as a PBS chitosan suspension. All three qualities were given together with the model antigen ovalbumin and also without it as placebo formulations. As a result of this study Chitosan from Sigma was identified as the chitosan with the highest adjuvant activity. Parallel to this study, a nanoparticle production method was developed. For this, chitosan was dissolved in acidic medium and then the bile salt derivative sodium deoxycholate was added under stirring to induce the gelation process. A method was developed to obtain nanoparticles with about 250 nm in diameter. Particles of this size are known to be taken up well by DCs specialised cells, called M-cells, which are located in the mucosal membranes. Particulate antigens induce both a strong systemic and also a local immune response on the mucosal membranes. The nanoparticles were combined with two model antigens, bovine serum albumin and ovalbumin, that were associated with the particles during the particle forming process. The particle forming process was further investigated regarding the relationship between the pH value of the chitosan solution and the resulting particle size as well as the antigen loading efficiency. These experiments were performed in order to enable the user to produce tailored particles in the different size ranges, if desired. In addition, the influence of the molecular weight of the polymer {{on the size of the}} generated particles was analysed. After that, freeze and spray drying with different stabilising excipients were examined in order to transfer the nanosuspension into a dry powder formulation being capable for direct respiratory administration. Finally, it was found that adding a 10 % mannitol solution to the nanosuspension followed by spray drying led to the best dry powder NiM formulation regarding handling and powder properties. Subsequently, protein stability in the final formulation was verified using SDS-PAGE and circular dichroism analysis. The results showed that the antigen (OVA) was not affected by the production process. The obtained powder was further analysed regarding its deposition profile inside the nasal cavity of adults and children using two nasal cast models and a <b>nasal</b> <b>powder</b> dispenser. In order to determine the respirable fraction the Twin Stage Glass Impinger with two dry powder inhalers were used. Obtained data showed that the nasal deposition of the NiM formulation inside the adults nasal cast model was satisfactory, while, due to the anatomy, the amount of NiM formulation deposited in the anterior regions of the child model was unacceptably high and thus the obtained deposition profile failed to match the desired one. Regarding the pulmonary delivery it was found that the produced powder showed a very high capsule and device retention. This problem was solved by adding 1 % magnesium stearate to the spray dried powder and blending for 3 h. Nevertheless, the resulting respirable fraction remained little too low. Finally, a second in vivo as well as another in vitro study were performed. In these studies the produced NiM formulation was administered intranasally to mice and the immune response measured as expression of CD 4 + and CD 8 + transgenic (OVA specific) cells was analysed via flow cytometry. In addition, the cell toxicity and the cellular uptake of the NiM formulation were investigated. In these studies it was found that the NiM formulation was taken up by dendritic cells in a satisfactory extent of about 50 %. Unfortunately, the magnitude of the immune response induced by the NiM formulation was rather modest and not significantly higher than those induced by the antigen-free placebo NiM formulation. Based on the obtained results, in future work it should be examined if a second adjuvant can be added to the existing formulation in order to increase the immune response. This new formulation should then be tested again in an in vivo study regarding its immunological potential. In order to ensure to induce an appropriate immune response in further studies the amount of antigen in the formulation should also be increased to about 2 %. But for this, the NiM formulation which was developed in this work is certainly a good basis for further development and optimisatio...|$|E

METHODS: The in vitro drug release from the mucoadhesive formulations was studied using a modified USP XXII rotating basket. The pharmacokinetics of apomorphine given as a solution was determined after subcutaneous and intranasal administrations to rabbits. The animals also received intranasally the mucoadhesive dosage forms and immediate release lactose powder mixture. Comparisons were made between the salient pharmacokinetic parameters of the different dosage forms. RESULTS: Sustained in vitro drug release was obtained from the mucoadhesive formulations. Apomorphine was absorbed more rapidly in rabbits when administered intranasally than as a subcutaneous injection. The mucoadhesive formulations both gave sustained plasma drug concentrations and bioavailabilities comparable to subcutaneous injections. The times taken to achieve peak plasma drug concentrations from these mucoadhesive formulations were more than three-fold that of lactose.

The goal of this dissertation is to understand how to develop, monitor an in vitro nasal model that will support the evaluation of the permeation effects that colominic acid may achieve in a nasal developed formulation. ^ Methods. An in vitro model was studied in both the Liquid / Liquid interface as well as the Air / Liquid interface to best represent the effect of the proposed permeation enhancing effects of colominic acid in a controlled 2 dimensional CALU- 3 cell line monolayer model. Various formulations of the fluorescent marker drug and the colominic acid were developed in a solution format and dosed onto the Air / Liquid interface of the in-vitro model. Both controls (without enhancer) and reproducibility (N= 3) were observed by examining results of the analysis against developed fluorescence responding analytical methods that would support the generation of P app values allowing for the comparison of permeation effects between different formulations. To achieve this Calu- 3 cells were first cultured to near confluence and then transferred to individual in vitro support membrane wells that allowed the formation of a tight junction monolayer of cells represent the nasal epithelium (approximately 7 to 10 days) depending on seeding density. Individual formulations incorporating various concentrations of colominic acid were then tested on the in vitro monolayer to see how much drug transport occurred across the epithelial barrier layer via a model drug of FITC-dextran. ^ Results and conclusions. The Papp values for various colominic acid formulations were in the 2 to 3 X 10 − 8 cm/sec with similar enhancement ratios observed indicating negligible effects in the permeation enhancement effect compared to the control formulation. Based on these results colominic acid as a permeation enhancer in a liquid formulation has been ruled out, but could still be a viable enhancer as either a <b>powder</b> <b>nasal</b> drug formulation enhancer or utilized in combination with other polyelectrolyte permeation enhancers to create a more favorable polyelectrolyte permeation enhancing complex or by combining with a cationic polysaccharide to form micelles or nanoparticles. ...|$|R

Due to the disadvantages associated with parenteral delivery alternative routes of administration (buccal, nasal, pulmonal, ocular, transdermal, rectal and vaginal route) have been investigated. In the present work, the nasal route was selected as an alternative route for peptide delivery. Despite the advantages related to nasal administration, the bioavailability remains low. In Chapter 1 the barriers to nasal absorption of peptides are described. The strategies which have been described in literature to circumvent the nasal barriers are also mentioned. This research project focused on powder formulations as carriers for the nasal delivery of peptides, aiming to improve the nasal bioavailability by enhancing the residence time of the drug in the nasal cavity by incorporating viscosity-enhancing excipients in the formulation. As carrier for the nasal delivery of insulin and salmon calcitonin (used as model peptides) mixtures of Drum Dried Waxy Maize starch and Carbopol® 974 P (ratio: 95 / 5, w/w) (DDWM/C 974 P 95 / 5) and of spray-dried Amioca® starch and Carbopol® 974 P (ratio: 25 / 75 and 85 / 15, w/w) (SD 25 / 75 and SD 85 / 15) were used. In Chapter 2 {{the characteristics of the}} components of the <b>nasal</b> <b>powders</b> were described in detail. In Chapter 3 the influence of powder bulk density on the nasal bioavailability of insulin was investigated in rabbits as in a previous study it was shown that the density of the formulation determined the spray pattern from the device. The powder bulk density of the nasal formulations was modified by changing the solid fraction of the dispersion (prior to freeze-drying) and by changing the freezing rate during the freeze-drying cycle. The bulk density was mainly determined by the solid fraction of the dispersion: the bulk density of the powders increased when the solid fraction of the freeze-dried dispersion was higher. However, no influence of powder bulk density on the nasal bioavailability of insulin in rabbits was seen. In Chapter 4 it was demonstrated that freeze-drying of aqueous dispersions containing spray-dried AmiocaÒ starch/CarbopolÒ 974 P (ratio: 25 / 75) and Ca(OH) 2 neutralised with NaOH yielded powders containing a mixture of sodium and calcium carboxylate. In Chapter 4. 1 the absorption enhancement of those powders was compared with equivalent powders containing only sodium carboxylate. An optimal balance between sodium and calcium carboxylate was required to maximise the absorption of insulin. The highest absorption of insulin was observed at a ratio of 90 / 10 between SD 25 / 75 and Ca(OH) 2, obtaining a bioavailability of ± 29 % and 19 % for equivalent formulation with and without Ca(OH) 2. This increase in nasal delivery was possibly due to the higher water absorbing capacity of the formulation (enhancing the paracellular transport by opening of the tight junctions) and to the higher elasticity after dispersing this formulation in nasal fluid. Furthermore, after nasal delivery of (SD 25 / 75) /Ca(OH) 2 90 / 10 or (SD 25 / 75) /CaCO 3 90 / 10 a decrease in tmax was observed, possibly due to a progressive dissociation of Ca 2 +-ions from the Ca 2 +-carboxylate after hydration of the powder which resulted in the closing of the tight junctions. Incorporation of salmon calcitonin in the (SD 25 / 75) /CaCO 3 90 / 10 formulation resulted in a similar trend: a higher Cmax but lower tmax was observed compared to the equivalent formulation without CaCO 3. The importance of using a spray-dried mixture of starch and CarbopolÒ 974 P instead of a physical mixture was also highlighted in this chapter. A physical mixture of starch and CarbopolÒ induced a lower absorption of insulin, possibly due to its lower and slower water absorbing capacity. A similar observation was made after addition of Ca(OH) 2 to this mixture: Cmax increased and tmax decreased in comparison with the mixture without Ca(OH) 2. As an enhanced bioavailability is frequently associated with a disruption of the integrity of the mucosal epithelium, in Chapter 4. 2 it was investigated if the enhanced nasal bioavailability of insulin after administration of the powder formulation containing (SD 25 / 75) /CaCO 3 90 / 10 was due to mucosal damage. The possible toxicological effects after multiple administration of the powders SD 25 / 75 and (SD 25 / 75) /CaCO 3 90 / 10 were evaluated using a non-invasive washing technique in rabbits and using a mucosal irritation assay on slugs. Both powder formulations induced mucosal damage after nasal administration to rabbits as an increased protein, LDH and ALP release from the nasal mucosa after administration was observed. A higher membrane damaging potential was observed for SD 25 / 75 compared to (SD 25 / 75) /CaCO 3 90 / 10. For both powders the effects on the epithelium were reversible as the protein and enzyme concentrations decreased within 24 h, returning to their basal levels within 3 days. Using the Slug Mucosal Irritation test, a lower mucosal tolerance was also observed for SD 25 / 75 as the mucus production and protein and LDH release after repeated administrations were higher in comparison with (SD 25 / 75) /CaCO 3 90 / 10. However, according to the Slug Mucosal Irritation prediction model both formulations were classified as moderate membrane irritating and mild to moderate membrane damaging. Hence they are not recommended for chronic drug therapies. Two modifications of the Slug Mucosal Irritation test were also described in Chapter 4. 2, which were performed in order to optimise the procedure for screening of formulations containing viscosity-enhancing and/or bioadhesive polymers. The results obtained using the modified protocols suggested that the present procedure might underestimate the tissue damaging potential of these formulations, especially for those test formulations at the borderline between a mild and moderate classification. The modified procedure wherein the foot mucosa of the slug was carefully cleaned with paper moistened with PBS after the 30 -min contact period with the formulation allowed the best prediction of those test substances. Consequently, this procedure will be further optimised and validated. The stability of the spray-dried Amioca® starch/Carbopol® 974 P 25 / 75 mixture stored during 9 months at different relative humidities (RH) and temperatures (10 % RH – 25 °C, 60 % RH – 25 °C, 75 % RH – 40 °C) was investigated in Chapter 5. Storage of a spray-dried mixture of Amioca® starch and Carbopol® 974 P 25 / 75 at 40 °C – 75 % RH induced structural modifications of the polymers which had an influence on the bioavailability of insulin after nasal delivery to rabbits. In order to maintain the powder characteristics obtained immediately after spray-drying the mixture should be stored at 25 °C and 10 % RH. In Chapter 6 the efficacy of oxymetazoline HCl formulated in a starch/Carbopol® powder formulation was compared to a commercial nasal spray (Nesivine®) in healthy human volunteers by measuring the nasal airflow during 8 h after administration and by scoring the nasal side effects (nasal obstruction, itching and sneezing) using a visual analogue scale. Powder formulations based on neutralised Amioca® starch/Carbopol® 974 P 25 / 75 and non-neutralised Amioca® starch/Carbopol® 974 P 85 / 15 were used as carriers for oxymetazoline HCl and two systems (Monopowder and Pfeiffer) were used as delivery devices. Nasal delivery of the neutralised SD 25 / 75 powder using the Monopowder device hardly improved the nasal airflow, possibly due to an ionic interaction between drug and carrier. In contrast, an increase in nasal airflow was seen for the non-neutralised SD 85 / 15 powder. The delivery device had an important influence on the pharmacological response. Spraying SD 85 / 15 with the Pfeiffer device resulted in higher pharmacological effect in healthy volunteers, the response being similar to the effect of the Nesivine® spray. However, the onset of action of oxymetazoline HCl was not as steep when the powder was administered. Longer measurements (> 8 h) are required to verify if a powder formulation based on Amioca® starch and Carbopol® 974 P induced a longer nasal decongestion compared to the conventional sprays. Furthermore, the side effects reported following powder administration were possibly related to the nasal delivery system: using the Pfeiffer system the nasal side effects were minimal, whereas with the Monopowder device stinging and watering eyes were reported immediately after administration. Possibly the pressure at which the powder particles are released from the device is too high...|$|R
40|$|The {{adenosine}} derivative N 6 -cyclopentyladenosine (CPA) {{has been}} proposed as a potent antiischemic drug for {{the central nervous system}} (CNS). 1 On the other hand, this compound has not yet entered in the clinical use being (i) quickly degraded in blood; (ii) unable to reach the brain by the systemic way; (iii) able to induce relevant side effects at other organs. 1 Recently, the nasal route {{has been proposed}} as a promising way to directly deliver into the brain those drugs unable to overcome the physiologic barriers between blood and CNS. 2, 3 Here, we report a study regarding the preparation of powder formulations containing CPA for <b>nasal</b> delivery. The <b>powders</b> have been obtained by spray-drying in the presence either of mannitol and lecithin, or chitosan as carriers. The drug content was detected by UV-spectrophotometric analysis, morphology by scanning electronic spectroscopy and particle size by laser diffraction. In vitro drug release studies from microspheres were carried out according to USP 24. Ex vivo mucoadhesive tests were performed on sheep nasal mucosa blowing an air stream over the microspheres spread onto the mucosa and calculating the detection of drug content by HPLC, upon dissolution in water of microparticles still adhered onto the mucosa. The permeability of both free and microencapsulated drug was studied across sheep nasal mucosa using phosphate buffer (pH 6. 5) as receptor solution. Male Wistar rats received an intravenous infusion of drug. Nasal administration was also performed using insufflators Monopowder P® (Valois Dispray, France). After the administration, blood and liquor samples, as well as the olfactory bulb and ventricular sections of the brain were withdrawn and the respective drug amounts analysed by HPLC. According to our results, the drug influenced the particle size and morphology in comparison with blank microparticles. The drug dissolution rate increased or decreased after loading in mannitol or chitosan microparticles, respectively. About 60 % of chitosan microspheres was recovered from mucoadhesive tests. The permeation rate of free drug was lower or higher than that of the encapsulated drug in mannitol or chitosan microspheres, respectively. The drug was not found in the central nervous system (CNS) after intravenous administration, which led to blood concentrations in the micromolar range. However, after nasal administration of the same dose, the drug was found in the CNS (up to micromolar range in the liquor, up to 0. 2 ng/mg tissue in the brain sections). The CPA amounts detected in rat blood after nasal administration of the powders appeared negligible with respect to the amounts detected after intravenous administration. We can conclude that nasal administration of microparticles prepared by spray-drying appears a promising strategy to obtain the selective CNS targeting of antiischemic adenosine derivatives...|$|R
