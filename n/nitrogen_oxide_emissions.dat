The BlueTec system, for example, injects a water-based urea solution into the exhaust system. The ammonia produced by the hydrolysis of the urea reacts with the <b>nitrogen</b> <b>oxide</b> <b>emissions</b> and is converted into nitrogen and water within the catalytic converter.

40|$|<b>Nitrogen</b> <b>oxides</b> <b>emissions</b> are an {{important}} aspect of engine design and calibration due to increasingly strict legislation. As a consequence, accurate modeling of <b>nitrogen</b> <b>oxides</b> <b>emissions</b> from Diesel engines could play a crucial role during the design and development phases of vehicle powertrain systems. A key step in future engine calibration will be the need to capture the nonlinear behavior of the engine with respect to <b>nitrogen</b> <b>oxides</b> <b>emissions</b> within a rapid-calculating mathematical model. These models will then be used in optimization routines or on-board control features. In this paper, an artificial neural network structure incorporating a number of engine variables as inputs including torque, speed, oil temperature and variables related to fuel injection is developed as a method of predicting the production of <b>nitrogen</b> <b>oxides</b> based on measured test data. A multi-layer perceptron model is identified and validated using data from dynamometry tests. The model predicts exhaust <b>nitrogen</b> <b>oxide</b> concentrations under different engine conditions with satisfactory accuracy.

This objective is achieved by measuring <b>nitrogen</b> <b>oxides</b> concentration in exhaust emissions from diesel generator units and estimating <b>nitrogen</b> <b>oxides</b> <b>emission</b> rates. <b>Nitrogen</b> <b>oxides</b> concentrations are measured using a single gas exhaust gas analyzer (the Kane Auto 1 -NOx gas analyzer) and measurements are taken directly from the exhaust pipes of the diesel engines driving the generator. <b>Nitrogen</b> <b>oxides</b> <b>emission</b> rates are calculated in g/kWh using United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.

25|$|Increasing {{nitrogen}} emission is {{a problem}} facing the delicate balance within the ecosystems that contain the Bay checkerspot in many areas. At Coyote Ridge the problem is well documented by conservation biologist Stuart Weiss. Faced with a declining population of Bay checkerspots at Coyote Ridge, Weiss searched for a cause. He found a link {{to a combination of}} pollution from the freeway below the ridge and, again, a cutback in cattle grazing locally. Weiss documented how <b>nitrogen</b> <b>oxide</b> <b>emissions</b> from cars enriched the nutrient-poor serpentine soil. This {{is a prime example of}} the nitrogen effect explained above. Aside from helping decrease nitrogen, the cattle also help to control invasive grasses by eating them. Any question about whether nitrogen emissions from cars traversing U.S. Route 101, 110,000 vehicles daily, is significant evaporates when faced with monitoring statistics from Weiss. His monitoring equipment has confirmed that 15 to 20 pounds of nitrogen per acre is deposited on Coyote Ridge annually. Some of the particles stick to the plant and ground and are washed into the soil, and others are directly absorbed by the plants themselves. By contrast, pollution from power plants and vehicles drops only about four to five pounds of nitrogen per acre per year on the Jasper Ridge preserve.|$|E

How to reduce <b>nitrogen</b> <b>oxides</b> <b>emission</b> {{is important to}} protect the environment. At the present work, a reduction mechanism based on a detailed chemical reaction kinetics mechanism, Gri_Mech 3. 0 was adopted to analyze <b>nitrogen</b> <b>oxides</b> formation in a CH 4 /air laminar premixed and turbulent diffusion flames, a two dimensional turbulent diffusion flame was simulated with the EDC model. Parameters were obtained, including flame temperature, burning velocity and mass fraction of <b>nitrogen</b> <b>oxides.</b> The results of laminar premixed flame show that <b>nitrogen</b> <b>oxides</b> <b>emission</b> mainly comes from the thermal and prompt NO mechanisms. A large amount of free radicals O, H and OH produced by combustion processes provide reactants for the reactions of <b>nitrogen</b> <b>oxides</b> formation.

However, when the fuel cell's waste heat is used to heat a building in a cogeneration system this efficiency can increase to 85%. This is significantly more efficient than traditional coal power plants, which are only about one third energy efficient. Assuming production at scale, fuel cells could save 20–40% on energy costs when used in cogeneration systems. Fuel cells are also much cleaner than traditional power generation; a fuel cell power plant using natural gas as a hydrogen source would create less than one ounce of pollution (other than [...] ) for every 1,000kW·h produced, compared to 25 pounds of pollutants generated by conventional combustion systems.

The methyl esters of {{vegetable}} oils known as biodiesel are fetching {{more and more}} attraction because of the low environmental impact and potential as a green alternative fuel for diesel engine {{and they would not}} require significant modification of existing engine. Methyl esters of Jatropha (JME) are derived through transesterification process.

The use of these methyl esters gives lower smoke, CO and HC but the <b>Nitrogen</b> <b>Oxide</b> <b>emission</b> is more. However to reduce the <b>Nitrogen</b> <b>Oxide</b> <b>emission</b> in diesel and various vegetable oil esters by lowering the combustion chamber temperature, Electronic fuel injection method is adopted.

The result indicates that the <b>Nitrogen</b> <b>Oxide</b> <b>emission</b> is less for Electronic fuel injection method than the single injection.
