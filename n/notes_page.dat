5000|$|While Theodore Roosevelt greatly enjoyed hunting, he {{was also}} an avid conservationist. In African Game Trails he condemns [...] "game {{butchery}} as objectionable as any form of wanton cruelty and barbarity" [...] (although he does note that [...] "to protest against all hunting of game is a sign of softness of head, not of soundness of heart") and as a pioneer of wilderness conservation in the USA he fully supported the British Government's attempts at that time to set aside wilderness areas as game reserves, some of the first on the African continent. He <b>notes</b> (<b>page</b> 17) that [...] "in the creation of the great game reserve through which the Uganda railway runs the British Government has conferred a boon upon mankind", a conservation attitude which Roosevelt helped sow that finally grew and blossomed {{in the form of the}} great game parks of East Africa today.|$|E
5000|$|On August 26, 2010, Devine {{announced}} on his Facebook page {{that he had}} begun writing his sixth album. A post made on his Facebook page also revealed tentative song titles which include [...] "Between the concrete & clouds", [...] "The first hit", [...] "Off-screen", [...] "A story, a sneak,", [...] "The city has left you", [...] "11-17", [...] "I used to be someone", [...] "Sleepwalking through my life", [...] "Wait out the wreck", and [...] "Merry Levov". The song [...] "Merry Levov" [...] was possibly renamed [...] "Awake in the dirt", as {{it does not appear}} on the album yet would explain the lyrical content of the later renaming. Several rough draft lyrics of these songs have been added to his Facebook <b>notes</b> <b>page.</b> Recording was completed on March 6, 2011. This is the first record he's made that is fully backed by a band, featuring musicians Brian Bonz (keyboard), Chris Bracco (a.k.a. [...] "Plosive") (bass, keyboard), Mike Fadem (drums, percussion), Russell Smith (electric guitar), and Mike Strandberg (guitar, mandolin). It was recorded in 10 days over a span of a month, being produced by longtime collaborator Chris Bracco and mixed by Rob Schnapf.|$|E
