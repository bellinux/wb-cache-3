40|$|The Nigerian Enugu and Polish Bellview coals were {{subjected}} to proximate analysis and Gray-King coke assay type tests. Proximate analysis gave the ash content as 7. 57 and 5. 56 %, the volatile content as 51. 76 and 31. 06 %, respectively for Enugu and Bellview coals. For the Gray-King coke type assay test, the coke types of B and G, the percentage coke yield of 71. 70 and 80. 40 % and percentage tar yield of 23. 30 and 11. 40 %, respectively, were determined for Enugu and Bellview coals. The coke type, the ash content and percentage coke yield confirms Bellview coal as a medium coking coal, suitable for cokemaking but with a volatile content that exceeds the upper limit of 30. 3 % for cokemaking at Ajaokuta and Enugu coal as a high volatile <b>non-caking</b> <b>coal.</b> However, the higher yield of tar from Enugu coal may be an advantage in its use as a binder in producing formed coke...|$|E
40|$|International audienceLumps of six {{bituminous}} coals, from 20 to 40 mm in size, were devolatilized in {{a laboratory}} oven in nitrogen atmosphere at different final temperatures ranging from 300 to 800 degrees C. The structure and morphology of the resulting chars with different degree of devolatilization have been examined under an optical microscope {{in order to better}} understand the formation mechanism of different types of char. The swelling of the caking coals and the fissuring of the <b>non-caking</b> <b>coals</b> were characterised by image analysis and some correspondences between the distribution of lithotypes within the initial coal lumps and the char structure obtained were revealed. The relation between chars structure and properties was also investigated. The char lumps obtained from caking coal exhibit better resistance to breakage than their parent <b>coal</b> lumps while <b>non-caking</b> <b>coals</b> show the opposite behaviour. For both caking and <b>non-caking</b> <b>coals,</b> a significant decrease of resistance is observed in the intensive devolatilization temperature range from 400 to 600 degrees...|$|R
40|$|Efforts {{continued}} to obtain financing {{for a commercial}} continuous formed coke plant. Discussions were held with two steel companies that are interested in producing coke for their use in steel production and foundry operations. Planning for production of 40 tons of foundry formed coke is underway. This coke {{will be used in}} two 20 -ton tests at General Motors` foundries. During this production, it is planned to determine if a tunnel kiln {{can be used as a}} coking furnace as an alternative for a rotary hearth. A rotary hearth is about three times more costly than a competitive-sized tunnel kiln. Work continued on using Western <b>non-caking</b> <b>coals</b> to produce formed coke. Successful tests were made by using Eastern caking coals and other binders to permit using up to 50 % of the cheaper Western <b>non-caking</b> <b>coals</b> in formed coke production. The primary objective of this project is to develop an advanced continuous mild gasification process and product upgrading processes which will be capable of eventual commercialization...|$|R
40|$|A {{method of}} {{desulfurizing}} coal {{is described in}} which chlorine gas is bubbled through an aqueous slurry of coal at low temperature below 130 degrees C., and at ambient pressure. Chlorinolysis converts both inorganic and organic sulfur components of coal into water soluble compounds which enter the aqueous suspending media. The media is separated after chlorinolysis and the coal dechlorinated at a temperature of from 300 C to 500 C to form a <b>non-caking,</b> low-sulfur <b>coal</b> product...|$|R
40|$|A coal blend {{consisting}} of 95 % Australian Agro-Allied coal and 5 % Nigerian <b>non-caking</b> Okaba <b>coal</b> wascarbonized in a 250 kg capacity coke oven at a flue temperature of 1, 250 oC by normal wet and preheatedcharging for 18 and 15 hours, respectively. Screen distribution analysis and micum drum tests on thecoke products gave M 10 of 24. 60 % and 9. 5 % and M 40 of 67 % and 76. 2 %, for normal and preheatedcharge, respectively. These {{results showed that}} the coke produced from the preheated charge has abetter resistance to abrasion (M 10) and fragmentation (M 40) and the micum indices obtained are similarto the micum characteristics of cokes produced in coke ovens in some other countries. Furthermore,the coke micum 10 and micum 40 strength are very close to the M 10 and M 40 specifications for coketo be used for blast furnace operations at the Ajaokuta Steel Plant, Nigeria...|$|R
40|$|The {{primary focus}} for the project during the quarter was {{shakedown}} testing of the large-scale coal preheater prototype in the CBTF with <b>non-caking</b> PRB <b>coal.</b> Additional pilot-scale tests were conducted in the PSCF in support of developing a preheating system design suitable for use with caking coals. Thirty-two additional pilot tests were conducted during the quarter with caking coal. These tests further evaluated {{the use of the}} air-bleed and indirect air-cooled liner designs to reduce or eliminate combustor plugging with caking coal. The air-bleed configurations tested used air injection holes perpendicular to the liner's longitudinal axis with the number, size and air flow though the air-bleed holes varied to determine the effect on combustor plugging. The indirect cooling configurations tested included a stainless steel liner with spiral fins in the annular space between the liner and the combustor wall, and a silicon carbide liner without fins. Continuous pilot operation was maintained for up to 30 minutes at a coal feed rate of 50 lb/h with the air-bleed liner. The best result achieved was for the stainless steel indirect air-cooled liner with 20 minutes of continuous operation at 126 lb/h of coal followed by an additional 20 minutes at 150 lb/h. The NOx results from these continue to indicate that even greater NOx reduction is possible with caking coal than with the PRB coal tested. The installation of the large-scale prototype coal preheater for PRB testing in the CBTF was completed and shakedown testing with natural gas and PRB coal started during the quarter. Stable operation of the coal system, combustor and burner were achieved at coal feed rates up to 6000 lb/h (50 MMBtu/h) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{proximate}} analysis and laboratory coking properties of Nigerian Enugu, Okaba, Lafia and Bellview coals A and B imported from Poland were determined. For the Nigerian coals, ash contents (db) of 7. 89 %, 8. 80 %., 25. 99 %, volatile matter (daf) of 54. 63 %, 64. 69 %, 31. 00 %, sulphur (db) of 0. 44 %., 0. 70 % 2. 34 % were determined for Enugu, Okaba and Lafia coals, respectively. For the Polish coals, ash contents (db) of 5. 80 %, 6. 10 %, volatile matter (daf) of 31. 80 %, 31. 30 %, sulphur (db) of 0. 60 %, 0. 70 % were analyzed for Bellview A and B, respectively. Furthermore, for Nigerian coals free swelling index (FSI) of 0, 0, 6 were determined for Enugu, Okaba and Lafia coals, respectively. For the Polish coals, FSI values of 2. 5, 2. 5, Gieseler maximum fluidity of 48 ddpm, 38 ddpm and G-coking capacity of 0. 97, 0. 93 were determined for Bellview A and B, respectively. The Nigerian Enugu and Okaba <b>coals</b> are thus <b>non-caking</b> sub-bituminous <b>coals,</b> while Lafia coal is a medium coking coal with intolerably high ash and sulphur contents. The Bellview coals are medium volatile coking coals of ISO codes 523 and 522, respectively. The relatively high G-value for Bellview A {{indicates that the}} coal may be self coking, {{but it may not}} accommodate the non-caking Enugu and Okaba coals and the high ash and high sulphur Lafia coals in blends for cokemaking. Blend calculations showed that up to 26. 38 % of the high ash, high sulphur Lafia coal can blend with 24. 98 % Bellview A and 48. 64 % prime coking UK Ogmore coal...|$|R
40|$|MSc (Chemistry), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2015 The {{plasticity}} of coal during pyrolysis is {{of significant}} importance, since {{it affects the}} reactivity, porosity, particle size and {{the density of the}} char and thus also the behaviour of the char during further utilisation processes. The main focus {{of this study was to}} characterize the chemical and physical changes which the thermally treated coal undergoes, in order to better understand the pyrolysis process of caking and <b>non-caking</b> South African <b>coals.</b> The pyrolysis behaviour of three South African coals with different caking indices was investigated. The coal samples included; (1) Highveld (TWD), a medium rank C coal with a free swelling index (FSI) of 0, (2) Grootegeluk (GG), also a medium rank C coal, with a FSI of 6. 5, and (3) Tshikondeni (TSH), a medium rank B coal with the highest FSI of 9. The three coal samples were classified as vitrinite-rich coals consisting of mainly aliphatic structures. Thermogravimetric experiments were used to determine the different temperatures relating to specific percentages of mass loss using set conditions. The pyrolysis process was stopped at various percentages of mass loss (thus at various stages of the reactions) to characterize the chemical structural changes that occurred at the specific mass loss percentages. The results obtained from characterization analyses indicated that the three coals differ in chemical composition and thus were expected to behave differently during pyrolysis. The coal samples consist of different amounts of macerals and minerals according to X-ray Fluorescence (XRF) and X-ray Diffraction (XRD) analyses. The Diffuse Reflectance Infrared Fourier Transform Spectroscopy (DRIFT) results indicated that some of the functional groups within the coal samples evolved with the increase in temperature. The highly caking coal (TSH) exhibited the highest aromaticity and ring condensation. The surface areas were determined by CO 2 adsorption and an increase in surface area was observed with an increase in temperature. The surface area of the GG and TSH coal-derived char samples decreased at some stage, which is an indication of thermoplastic behaviour and subsequent swelling of the coal samples. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images confirm the plastic stage of caking coals at specific temperatures and volatile matter release via the multiple bubble mechanism. All these results are given and discussed extensively in this dissertation. Master...|$|R
