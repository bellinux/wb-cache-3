50|$|The Piqua Nuclear Generating Station {{was shut}} down in 1966 due to an {{instrument}} scram. In the process of resuming operation, {{it was discovered that}} two control rods did not move freely within their guide tubes and four <b>nuclear</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>elements</b> required abnormally high force to remove. Subsequently, these fuel elements would not reseat. A complete unloading of the core showed that large carbonaceous deposits were present on the fuel, control rods, and support structures throughout the core region. These deposits interfered with the movement of the control rods, and altered the heat transfer characteristics of the fuel. As a consequence, the Atomic Energy Commission decided to end the Piqua experiment and the reactor was dismantled.|$|E
5000|$|One way to {{increase}} the temperature, and thus the specific impulse, is to isolate the <b>nuclear</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>elements</b> so {{they no longer have}} to be of the rigid fuel rod type. This is the basis of the particle-bed reactor, also known as the fluidized-bed, dust-bed, or rotating-bed design. In this design the fuel is placed in a number of (typically spherical) elements which [...] "float" [...] inside the hydrogen working fluid. Spinning the entire engine forces the fuel elements out to walls that are being cooled by the hydrogen. This design increases the specific impulse to about 1000 seconds (9.8 kN·s/kg), allowing for thrust-to-weight ratios greater than 1:1, although at the cost of increased complexity. Such a design could share design elements with a pebble-bed reactor, several of which are currently generating electricity.|$|E

50|$|A core melt {{accident}} {{occurs when}} the heat generated by a nuclear reactor exceeds the heat removed by the cooling systems {{to the point where}} at least one <b>nuclear</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>element</b> exceeds its melting point.

A meltdown may be caused by a loss of coolant, loss of coolant pressure, or low coolant flow rate or be the result of a criticality excursion in which the reactor is operated at a power level that exceeds its design limits. Alternately, in a reactor plant such as the RBMK-1000, an external fire may endanger the core, leading to a meltdown.|$|R
50|$|After {{the first}} {{demonstration}} of the practical arc-mode caesium vapor thermionic converter by V. Wilson in 1957, several applications of it were demonstrated in the following decade, including its use with solar, combustion, radioisotope and nuclear reactor heat sources. The application most seriously pursued, however, was the integration of thermionic <b>nuclear</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>elements</b> directly into the core of nuclear reactors for production of electrical power in space.The exceptionally high operating temperature of thermionic converters, which makes their practical use difficult in other applications, gives the thermionic converter decisive advantages over competing energy conversion technologies in the space power application where radiant heat rejection is required. Substantial thermionic space reactor development programs were conducted in the U.S., France and Germany in the period 1963-1973, and the US resumed a significant thermionic nuclear fuel element development program in the period 1983-1993.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>nuclear</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>elements</b> {{were made}} of {{refractory}} ceramic based on beryllium oxide, with enriched uranium dioxide as fuel and small amount of zirconium dioxide for structural stability. The fuel elements were hollow hexagonal tubes about 4 in long with 0.3 in distance between the outer parallel planes, with inside diameter of 0.227 in. They were manufactured by high-pressure extruding of the green compact, then sintering almost to its theoretical density. The core consisted of 465,000 individual elements stacked to form 27,000 airflow channels; the design with small unattached elements reduced problems related with thermal stresses. The elements were designed for average operation temperature of the autoignition temperature of the reactor base plates was only 150 °C higher. The neutron flux was calculated to be 9×1017 neutrons/cm2·s in the aft and 7×1014 neutrons/cm2·s in the nose. The gamma radiation level was fairly high {{due to the lack}} of shielding; radiation hardening for the guidance electronics had to be designed.|$|E
50|$|A third fuel vessel, , {{is filled}} with spent <b>nuclear</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>elements,</b> many of them damaged and thus {{difficult}} to handle. The vessel was used for dumping of nuclear waste in the Barents and Kara Seas from 1963 to 1984. During a dumping operation in 1984, Lepse encountered very rough seas, and high-level reactor waste mixed with water was splashed all over {{the inside of the}} cargo compartment. The contamination was so severe that the crew were forced to immediately return to port at the Atomflot harbor with most of the nuclear waste still in the hold. The ship was immediately recognized as being far too dangerous to decontaminate and return to service, and has been essentially abandoned with a cargo hold full of leaking spent reactor fuel vessels, staying in the harbor for over 15 years. A small crew monitored the ship on a constant basis while Russia tried to raise the money and perform the research needed for safe disposal. In September 2012 the Lepse was removed from the Atomflot harbor and transported to the Nerpa shipyard where it will be carefully scrapped.|$|E
25|$|For the {{propulsion}} of the studied vehicles, Bob Lazar {{claims that}} the atomic Element 115 served as a <b>nuclear</b> <b>fuel.</b> <b>Element</b> 115 (provisionally named 'Ununpentium' (Uup)) reportedly provided an energy source which would produce anti-gravity effects under proton bombardment along with the production of antimatter used for energy production.

50|$|Contamination of air {{and soil}} due to {{atmospheric}} testing {{is only part of}} a wider issue. Water contamination due to improper disposal of spent uranium and decay of sunken nuclear-powered submarines is a major problem in the Kola Peninsula in northwest Russia. Although the Russian government states that the radioactive power cores are stable, various scientists have come forth with serious concerns about the 32,000 spent <b>nuclear</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>elements</b> that remain in the sunken vessels. There have been no major incidents other than the explosion and sinking of a nuclear-powered submarine in August 2000, but many international scientists are still uneasy at the prospect of the hulls eroding, releasing uranium into the sea and causing considerable contamination. Although the submarines pose an environmental risk, they have yet to cause serious harm to public health. However, water contamination {{in the area of the}} Mayak test site, especially at Lake Karachay, is extreme, and has gotten to the point where radioactive byproducts have found their way into drinking water supplies. It has been an area of concern since the early 1950s, when the Soviets began disposing of tens of millions of cubic meters of radioactive waste by pumping it into the small lake. Half a century later, in the 1990s, there are still hundreds of millions of curies of waste in the Lake, and at points contamination has been so severe that a mere half-hour of exposure to certain regions would deliver a dose of radiation sufficient to kill 50% of humans. Although the area immediately surrounding the lake is devoid of population, the lake has the potential to dry up in times of drought. Most significantly, in 1967, it dried up and winds carried radioactive dust over thousands of square kilometers, exposing at least 500,000 citizens to a range of health risks. To control dust, Soviet scientists piled concrete on top of the lake. Although this was effective in helping mediate the amount of dust, the weight of the concrete pushed radioactive materials into closer contact with standing underground groundwater. It is difficult to gauge the overall health and environmental effects of the water contamination at Lake Karachay because figures on civilian exposure are unavailable, making it hard to show causation between elevated cancer rates and radioactive pollution specifically from the lake.|$|E
