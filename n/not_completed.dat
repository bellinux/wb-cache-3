5000|$|Saunders Mac Lane, one of {{the founders}} of {{category}} theory, is said to have remarked, [...] "I didn't invent categories to study functors; I invented them to study natural transformations." [...] Just as the study of groups is <b>not</b> <b>complete</b> without a study of homomorphisms, so the study of categories is <b>not</b> <b>complete</b> without the study of functors.

Despite serious opposition, which {{included}} the merchants and traders of Doncaster as well as Doncaster Corporation, the Bill was passed, giving the company new powers to make the river deeper and create a cut to avoid the shallows at Stainforth and Bramwith. Work on this northern section started almost immediately. The southern section to Tinsley was navigable by 1751, although the wharf and warehouse had not been completed by that date, and the towpath from Rotherham was <b>not</b> <b>completed</b> until 1822.|$|E

5|$|Agricultural {{improvement}} and the Industrial Revolution came to Aberdaron in the 19th century. The Inclosure (Consolidation) Act 1801 {{was intended to}} make it easier for landlords to enclose and improve common land, introduce increased efficiency, bring more land under the plough, and reduce the high prices of agricultural production. Rhoshirwaun Common, following strong opposition, was enclosed in 1814; while the process was <b>not</b> <b>completed</b> in Aberdaron, Llanfaelrhys and Y Rhiw until 1861. On the industrial front, mining developed as a major source of employment, especially at Y Rhiw, where manganese was discovered in 1827.|$|E

5|$|By 1974, the {{majority}} of the freeway that US-64 was to occupy in Tulsa was complete, and it was relocated onto the completed portion of the freeway. Only the portion in the downtown section of the city was yet to be completed. The remainder of the freeway, the concurrency with Interstate 444, was <b>not</b> <b>completed</b> until about 1983. The next and final major modification to the designation of US-64 took place when it was moved from its route through eastern Tulsa onto the newly constructed Creek Turnpike over the first half of 1992. The route has undergone only minor changes since then.|$|E

5|$|City College's Tudor and Gothic-style building, {{designed}} by Baltimore City Hall architect George A Frederick, lasted until 1892, {{when it was}} undermined by {{the construction of the}} Baltimore & Ohio Railroad tunnel from Camden Station to Mount Royal Station, and collapsed.

5|$|Construction {{began on}} 23 August 1774. The Prince of Wales {{was invited to}} lay the first stone but declined, and so the stone was laid by {{commission}} member Henry Hobart. The bridge opened to pedestrians in September 1776 and to other traffic on 12 January 1777, at which time the ferry service was closed, although work on the bridge was <b>not</b> <b>completed</b> until December 1777. A large milestone was placed at the Richmond end, giving the distances to other bridges and to local towns.|$|E
