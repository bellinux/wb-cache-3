5|$|Before {{coming to}} Cambridge, Burhop had <b>not</b> <b>engaged</b> <b>in</b> {{political}} activities. At Cambridge he encountered political debate {{generated by the}} suffering caused by the Great Depression {{and the rise of}} fascism in Europe. While he rejected his parents' faith in favour of rationalist science, he did not reject their values, especially that of compassion for others, and there was no estrangement between them. At Cambridge he embraced socialism, and believed that scientists had a moral responsibility to society, one that included fighting fascism.|$|E
5|$|Judge Cavanaugh granted summary {{judgment}} to the defendants on {{the freedom of}} speech claim based on their earlier motions, holding that Heffernan had <b>not</b> <b>engaged</b> <b>in</b> protected speech so his rights could not have been violated. In 2012, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals reversed Judge Cavanaugh's ruling and remanded the case to him with instructions that he was to allow Heffernan to present his freedom of association claim and consider the facts from the jury trial when reconsidering the summary-judgment motions.|$|E

5|$|Shortly after Jutland, Active again {{became a}} {{destroyer}} leader and escorted {{the main body}} of the Grand Fleet during the Action of 19 August 1916. By the end of the year, the ship was assigned to the Dover Patrol and was present during two battles with German destroyers, but was <b>not</b> <b>engaged</b> <b>in</b> either. She was transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet in 1918 and was based in Gibraltar for the rest of the war. The sister ships were both sold for scrap in 1920–21.|$|E
5|$|U.S.-Soviet {{relations}} took a {{turn for}} the worse with the Soviet’s arrest of U.S. reporter Nicholas Daniloff, evidently for use as a bargaining chip in response to the August 30, 1986 arrest of suspected KGB agent Gennadiy Zakharov. Since Daniloff was <b>not</b> <b>engaged</b> <b>in</b> espionage, Matlock advised taking a hard line with the Soviets. While charges against Daniloff were dropped, a diplomatic row ensued, leading by the end of October, to the expulsion of 100 Soviets, including 80 suspected intelligence officers. The U.S. lost 10 diplomats from Embassy Moscow, along with all 260 of the Russian support staff.|$|E
5|$|When the {{division}} was <b>not</b> <b>engaged</b> <b>in</b> coastal-defence duties or unit training, formation-level training {{took the form}} of increasingly larger exercises. Exercise Waterloo, conducted from 14–16June 1941, was the largest in the United Kingdom to date, with ICanadian Corps counter-attacking an imagined German sea and air landing. Exercise Bumper, held from 29September to 3October, was larger still, involving 250,000 men. These exercises tended to concentrate on traffic control, communications, and logistical concerns, and were of little practical value to the infantry.|$|E

5|$|As a consequence, investable funds became {{increasingly}} concentrated {{in a single}} institution, the Banco de la Nacion Argentina (BNA), creating a financial system vulnerable to rent-seeking. Rediscounting and non-performing loans grew steadily at the BNA after 1914, polluting its balance sheet. This corrosion of balance sheets {{was a result of}} crony loans to the other banks and the private sector. In its rediscounting actions the BNA was <b>not</b> <b>engaged</b> <b>in</b> pure lender of last resort actions, following Bagehot's principle of lending freely at a penalty rate. Instead, the state bank allowed the private banks to shed their risks, with bad paper used as security, and lent them cash at 4.5%, below the rate the BNA offered its customers on time deposits.|$|E
5|$|By the {{beginning}} of 1916, Active {{was assigned to the}} Grand Fleet and played a minor role in the Battle of Jutland later in the year. Shortly afterwards, she was briefly assigned as the flotilla leader of the 4th DF and escorted {{the main body of the}} Grand Fleet during the Action of 19 August. By the end of the year, the ship was assigned to the Dover Patrol and was present during two battles with German destroyers, but was <b>not</b> <b>engaged</b> <b>in</b> either. Active was based in Ireland by {{the beginning}} of 1918, but was soon transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet and based in Gibraltar for the rest of the war. The ship was reduced to reserve in 1919 and was sold for scrap the following year.|$|E
5|$|Judge Kevin McNulty {{heard the}} case on remand. After {{considering}} the parties' motions for summary judgment again, he ruled in the city's favor in 2014. Heffernan, he ruled, had <b>not</b> <b>engaged</b> <b>in</b> any protected speech or expressive conduct. Judge McNulty also ruled that Heffernan could not prevail on claims that his perceived speech was protected, per Ambrose v. Robinson Township, a previous case on that issue in the Third Circuit, or that his actions were protected since they aided and abetted speech. Judge McNulty also rejected similar claims for freedom of association. He decided that Dye v. Office of the Racing Commission, {{a case in which}} the Sixth Circuit had held that the First Amendment reached perceived political association, was not a precedent he could rely on since Dye itself explicitly rejected Ambrose, and as a district judge he could not reject circuit precedent.|$|E

5|$|The Utah beach landings, however, were {{relatively}} uncontested, with assault units landing on largely unoccupied beaches and experiencing far less action than the landings at Omaha. The filmmakers chose {{to begin the}} narrative with a depiction of the more dramatic story of Omaha, despite the strategic inaccuracy of an impossible mission that {{could easily have been}} pursued from the other beach area. In addition, one of the most notable of the operational flaws is the depiction of the 2nd SS Panzer Division Das Reich as the adversary during the fictional Battle of Ramelle. The 2nd SS was <b>not</b> <b>engaged</b> <b>in</b> Normandy until July, and then at Caen against the British and Canadians, 100 miles east. Furthermore, the Merderet River bridges were not an objective of the 101st Airborne Division but of the 82nd Airborne Division, part of Mission Boston.|$|E
5|$|There is no need, under Churchill v Walton, to {{show that}} the conspirators knew that their {{proposed}} course of conduct amounted to a crime, but they must have intended the consequences; if two people conspire to put poison in the victim's tea, this is not a conspiracy to murder unless the poison was intended to kill the victim. The defendants will similarly not be found guilty if they are unaware that a crime will result; if two people agree to grow plants, unaware that the plants are illegal, they have <b>not</b> <b>engaged</b> <b>in</b> a conspiracy. On the other hand, if the two people believe the plants to be illegal even though they are not, they could be found guilty.|$|E
5|$|Hsu {{was able}} to gain the trust of investors by his dress, by his warm and personable manner, by his {{educational}} credentials, by being quoted in trade magazines, and by {{the long list of}} business under his name, but had a record of changing addresses and leaving disappointed investors behind. Starting in 1989, Hsu raised $1 million from investors to launch a latex glove business. Some of these partners invested their life savings or mortgaged their homes, and some sued Hsu when it appeared their money was lost. In 1990, Hsu, then living in Foster City, California, declared a bankruptcy, stating that he was practically destitute, with no job, no income, and few possessions other than an SUV and a ring. That same year, he was also divorced as well as allegedly kidnapped by San Francisco Triad society gang leader Raymond Kwok Chow. In 1991, California authorities brought fraud charges against him, describing his operation as a Ponzi scheme. Specifically, authorities claimed Hsu had <b>not</b> <b>engaged</b> <b>in</b> any legitimate business activity, but instead was using funds from later investors to pay returns to earlier ones. In February 1992 Hsu plead no contest to one count of grand theft and agreed to serve up to three years in prison and pay a $10,000 fine. Hsu subsequently failed to appear at the sentencing hearing and a warrant was issued for his arrest.|$|E

Shortly afterwards, she was briefly assigned as the flotilla leader of the 4th DF and escorted the main body of the Grand Fleet during the Action of 19 August.
