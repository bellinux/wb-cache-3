She completed the installation of approximately {{a mile and a}} half of netting on 11 July and remained in the Puget Sound area tending nets for the remainder of 1942. Placed in full commission on 2 January 1943, Boxwood resumed her tending tasks after her overhaul at Todd, Seattle, shipyard and carried them out through the spring of 1943.|$|E
5000|$|Hale lawaia, {{the house}} of fishing. It was built along the beaches as a shelter for their fishing <b>nets</b> and <b>lines.</b> <b>Nets</b> and <b>lines</b> were made by a tough rope {{fashioned}} from woven coconut husks. Fish hooks were made of human, pig or dog bone. Implements found in the hale lawaia {{were some of the}} most prized possessions of the entire village.|$|R
50|$|Stored-program analog {{switches}} {{such as the}} 1ESS switch, {{had both}} simple wire junctors and circuit junctors. Circuit junctors were {{in the form of}} plug-in circuit boards to provide talk battery and supervision for intraoffice calls and were closely similar to intraoffice trunk packs, with two scan points and two signal distributor points per circuit, two circuits per plug-in pack. Wire junctors were two-wire connections between trunk nets and other trunk <b>nets</b> or <b>line</b> <b>nets.</b> When three-way calling was introduced, three-port conference trunks were used, which only appeared on trunk nets. All junctors appeared in subgroups of sixteen on plugs or jacks at the Junctor Grouping Frame, where as many subgroups as required were plugged into other trunk <b>nets,</b> <b>line</b> <b>nets,</b> or circuit junctor frames.|$|R

In Australian doubles, the server's partner at <b>net</b> <b>lines</b> {{up on the}} same side of the court, fronting the opposing net player, who serves as a poaching block and blind. The receiver then must return serve down the line and is liable to have that return poached. In the I-Formation, the server's <b>net</b> partner <b>lines</b> up in the center, between the server and receiver so he or she can poach in either direction. Both Australian Doubles and the I-Formation are poaching formations that can also be used to start the point for serve-and-volley doubles.|$|R

It keeps them at bay, but soon they break through it, and the battle begins. It's a difficult fight, but the Garthim aren't used to being stood up to, so they become confused, and eventually retreat.

5000|$|The ball is yellow wool, from 22 to 23 grams {{in weight}} and from 5 to 5.5 cm in diameter. A {{standard}} ball-badminton racket usually weighs from 200 to 250 grams and is 63 to 70 cm in length. The strung oval {{area of the}} racket should be 20 to 22 across and 24 to 27 cm in length. The net is made of fine cord to make a 2 cm square mesh along its length and is edged with red tape at the top. The entire net is red, white and blue, 100 cm wide and 13.5 meters in length. It is tied to a center pole of 183 cm and two poles of 185 cm {{at the sides of}} the court to maintain the 183 cm height of the net at the center. Two posts, each 2 meters high, are fixed one meter or less outside the court on either side {{at the end of the}} line to which the net is tied, strong enough to keep the net well stretched. A hook is fixed at 1.5 meters height to each pole to easily tighten the net whenever necessary.The size of the court for [...] "fives" [...] teams is 12 metres wide and 24 metres long. It is divided across the middle by a <b>net</b> <b>line</b> over which the net is hung, the ends of which are attached to the tops of the two posts. The serving crease lines are drawn one meter away from each side of the <b>net</b> <b>line</b> and parallel to it. The center line is drawn halfway between the serving crease lines and parallel to the sidelines; this divides the space on each side of the crease line into two halves, known as the right and left courts. The boundary lines are marked with white ropes, 5 mm thick. The center and crease lines are to be marked so as to be visible, about 10 mm wide ...|$|E

50|$|Mary River Cod {{are subject}} to the usual story of woe. Incredibly {{abundant}} at the time of first European settlement, they were grossly overfished with <b>nets,</b> <b>lines</b> and explosives by the early European settlers and, as with other Maccullochella cods, were even used as pig feed. This overfishing, combined with the massive siltation of their habitats by land-clearing, destruction of riparian vegetation and cattle trampling river banks, and dams and weirs blocking migration, rapidly caught up with this large, slow-growing, long-lived Maccullochella cod species, as it has with all its close relatives.|$|R

50|$|Attached to the 11th Naval District, Chestnut tended {{nets and}} gave other harbor {{services}} at San Diego, California, until 24 June 1942. On 25 May 1942 she {{was placed in}} full commission and Lieutenant A. Schlott, USNR, her officer-in-charge, became commanding officer. Steaming by way of Hawaii and Samoa, Chestnut arrived at Efate, New Hebrides, 26 February 1943. She tended nets there and at Noumea until 5 December 1943, except for an overhaul at Dunedin, New Zealand. Chestnut arrived in the Solomon Islands 13 December and until 29 August 1944 had cargo, salvage and net repair duty in those islands. She was redesignated AN-11, 20 January 1944. From 3 September to 10 October 1944 Chestnut dismantled and removed the <b>net</b> <b>line</b> in Havannah Harbor, Efate, and after repairs in Australia, returned to Noumea until 3 January 1945. Chestnut then moved to Ulithi for net and mooring operations. Except for brief duty at the seaplane base at Kossol Roads, Palau in April, she remained at Ulithi until 19 June when she departed for Guam, arriving two days later.|$|E
50|$|Open heel fins are {{secured to}} the foot by a strap which passes {{around the back of}} the ankle. These are usually elastic and may be adjustable. Early fins used rubber straps {{connected}} to the fin by a wire buckle, and were not readily adjustable. Later versions incorporated swivels, buckles, quick release connectors and adjustable tension, but the increased complexity and decreased reliability, and tendency of the loose strap ends to hook on things triggered a return by some manufacturers and aftermarket accessory manufacturers to simpler systems. These include stainless steel spring straps and bungee straps, which once set up, are not adjustable, and which reduce the number of potential failure points and places where the fin can snag on obstructions like <b>net,</b> <b>line</b> and seaweed. Some heel straps have a loop for better grip with wet hands or gloves.Some fins designed for surf use have integral straps which can neither be replaced nor adjusted, but are simple and have no projections which can snag or scratch the swimmer's legs. They are much like full foot pocket fins without the back part of the sole, but do not trap as much sand when used in the surf.|$|E
50|$|The road {{starts in}} Nottingham at a {{roundabout}} which Maid Marian Way and Upper Parliament Street spur (A6008 road. From here road ascends, passing Nottingham Cathedral. At Canning Circus, it meets the A6200 (former A52) for Derby and A608 for Ilkeston. The A610 becomes Alfreton Road {{as it passes}} through Hyson Green, where it meets the A6130 Radford Boulevard and Gregory Boulevard, then becomes Nuthall Road, crossing the Nottingham Ring Road (A6514). The road then passes through Aspley, with the speed limit being enforced by SPECS average speed cameras. It crosses the B6004 at NCN Basford Hall then the B6008 at the Cinderhill Roundabout. To the north is the Phoenix park terminus of the <b>NET</b> <b>Line</b> 2 (tram). At this point, the road detours from its original route through Nuthall, the new route (built when the M1 arrived in 1966) becomes a dual carriageway, passing the Millers Barn Nottingham Beefeater on the right opposite the BP St Mary`s Service Station, and Nuthall Pub & Kitchen on the left. The road ascends {{out of the city}} of Nottingham towards the large Nuthall Island with the A6002 and B600. The former route follows what is now the B600. Shortly afterwards, the route then meets the Nuthall Interchange (junction 26) of the M1 motorway at a large roundabout. On 24 May 1967, Barbara Castle opened the section of the M1 from here to junction 27 at Annesley Woodhouse.|$|E

After tending nets in the Adak area during the invasion of Kiska, Boxwood proceeded to Kiska {{as a replacement for}} a destroyer operating off that island and thus gained the distinction of being the first net tender in that area. Soon after Boxwood's arrival, Buckeye joined her; and the two ships installed cruiser moorings in Kiska harbor, as well as approximately two miles of a combination anti-torpedo and submarine-indicator net.|$|R
