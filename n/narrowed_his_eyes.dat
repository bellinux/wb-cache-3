6000|$|Clarke {{paused a}} moment and <b>narrowed</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes.</b> [...] "Now," [...] he said [...] "it is of vital {{importance}} to you to know who gave that order to retreat." ...|$|E
60|$|Gerald <b>narrowed</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> {{his face}} was cool and unscrupulous {{as he looked at}} Birkin, impersonally, with a vision that ended in a point in space, strangely keen-eyed and yet blind.|$|E
60|$|Again the Mino <b>narrowed</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> {{as if he}} {{were looking}} at the sun. Then, {{suddenly}} affecting to have no connection at all with the two people, he went trotting off, with assumed spontaneity and gaiety, his tail erect, his white feet blithe.|$|E
60|$|The doctor's lips had thinned into a <b>narrow</b> line. <b>His</b> <b>eyes</b> {{were raised}} again, and sparkled indignantly.|$|R
60|$|It {{was a quiet}} supper {{the three}} friends sat down to. Herbert sat <b>narrowing</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> over <b>his</b> thoughts, which, when the fancy took him, he {{scattered}} out upon the others' silence. Lawford apparently had not yet shaken himself free from the sorcery of the moonlight. <b>His</b> <b>eyes</b> shone dark and full {{like those of a}} child who has trespassed beyond its hour for bed, and sits marvelling at reality in a waking dream.|$|R
6000|$|Lassiter smiled, {{and then}} <b>his</b> bronzed eyelids <b>narrowed</b> till <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> seemed mere gray slits. [...] "You'll kill Tull!" [...] He did not question; he affirmed.|$|R
60|$|The {{senses of}} the man who {{crouched}} in his curious attitude, with his eyes still piercing the heavens, were mobile and extraordinary things. No disturbing sounds had reached him from outside. His isolation seemed complete and impregnable. Yet, without turning his head, he was perfectly conscious of the slow opening of the door. His whole frame stiffened. He was conscious for one bitter second of a lapse from the careful guarding of his ways. That second passed, however, and left him prepared even for danger, his brain and muscles alike tense. He turned his head. The expression of slow surprise, which even parted his lips and <b>narrowed</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> was only half assumed.|$|E
60|$|On the morrow he {{rode out}} of the red cliff gate with Dave and the pack-horses, a dull ache in his heart; for amid the cheering crowd of {{children}} and women who bade them good-bye he had caught the wave of Mescal's hand and a look of her eyes that would be with him always. What might happen before he returned, if he ever did return! For he knew now, {{as well as he}} could feel Silvermane's easy stride, that out there under the white glare of desert, the white gleam of the slopes of Coconina, was wild life awaiting him. And he shut his teeth, and <b>narrowed</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> and faced it with an eager joy that was in strange contrast to the pang in his breast.|$|E
6000|$|She said: [...] "Don't--Alvan!" [...] {{and there}} was {{something}} that resembled a warning in the pain of her tone. He <b>narrowed</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> as if trying to pierce her with his gaze. Her voice touched him. He had aspirations after magnanimity, generosity, superiority--interrupted, however, by flashes of indignation and anxiety--frightful anxiety to know how far she had gone. She looked down at the torn paper. Then she looked up, and their eyes met again, remained fastened together, like an unbreakable bond, like a clasp of eternal complicity; and the decorous silence, the pervading quietude of the house which enveloped this meeting of their glances became for a moment inexpressibly vile, for he was afraid she would say too much and make magnanimity impossible, while behind the profound mournfulness of her face there was a regret--a regret of things done--the regret of delay--the thought that if she had only turned back a week sooner--a day sooner--only an hour sooner. [...] . They were afraid to hear again the sound of their voices; they did not know what they might say--perhaps something that could not be recalled; and words are more terrible than facts. But the tricky fatality that lurks in obscure impulses spoke through Alvan Hervey's lips suddenly; and he heard his own voice with the excited and sceptical curiosity with which one listens to actors' voices speaking on the stage in the strain of a poignant situation.|$|E
6000|$|... "Who would?" [...] agreed Lieutenant Butzow, and then, with {{a sudden}} <b>narrowing</b> of <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> and {{a quick glance at}} Barney, [...] "if it WAS lightning." ...|$|R
50|$|In 2008 HSBC {{were accused}} of 'cultural insensitivity' in an {{advertising}} campaign featuring an overweight white man dressed {{to look like a}} Sumo wrestler. The campaign upset members of Britain's Japanese community who claimed the man's skin tone was darkened and makeup was applied to <b>narrow</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes.</b> HSBC denied making the model appear to be from a specific country or region but admitted makeup was applied and skin tone was tanned.|$|R
6000|$|Lawford sighed. 'I {{was only}} dreaming, Sheila,' he said, and softly, peacefully opened <b>his</b> <b>eyes.</b> 'I dreamed I was in the--, <b>His</b> lids <b>narrowed,</b> <b>his</b> dark <b>eyes</b> fixed {{themselves}} on the anxious spectacled face bending over him. 'Mr Bethany! Where? What's wrong?' ...|$|R
50|$|On November 30, Littlefield resumed chiseling, {{and worked}} for some time until he managed to punch a hole into the wall, at which point he felt a strong draft that did not permit his lantern to stay lit inside. Maneuvering it, he looked around, {{ignoring}} the foul fumes and letting his eyes adjust to the dark. Finally he saw {{something out of the}} ordinary. He <b>narrowed</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> and looked more sharply until he just made out on top of a dirt mound the shape of a human pelvis. He also saw a dismembered thigh and the lower part of a leg.|$|E
5000|$|The 2015 {{installation}} of the Hatbox Ghost figure is a new animatronic, designed to resemble the original. The new version's face is an animation that is projected onto the figure, similarly to the [...] "Constance the Bride" [...] figure. The character looks {{back and forth and}} <b>narrows</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> before <b>his</b> head dissolves into mist and vanishes. As the head vanishes, a chuckle can be heard. The head then appears inside the hatbox before disappearing again, but without an accompanying chuckle, and the head vanishes into the shadows without any mist.|$|R
60|$|Hobson's square jaw was set {{a little}} tighter, and <b>his</b> <b>narrow</b> <b>eyes</b> flashed.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, very true, you ARE! You ARE {{in need of}} enlightenment. A set of benighted wise virgins. Ha-ha-ha! That's good, that--benighted wise virgins! What--" [...] Argyle put his red face near to Aaron's, {{and made}} a moue, <b>narrowing</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> quizzically as he peered up from under his level grey eyebrows. [...] "Sit in the dark to save the lamp-oil--And all no good to them.--When the bridegroom cometh--! Ha-ha! Good that! Good, my boy!--The bridegroom--" [...] he giggled to himself. [...] "What about the bridegroom, Algy, my boy? Eh? What about him? Better trim your wick, old man, if it's not too late--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nels, I hevn't seen nothin'," [...] he replied, bluntly. His levity disappeared, {{and the red}} {{wrinkles}} <b>narrowed</b> round <b>his</b> searching <b>eyes.</b>|$|R
60|$|His sallow {{cheeks were}} paler than ever. <b>His</b> <b>narrow</b> <b>eyes,</b> furtively raised to Wrayson's, {{were full of}} {{inquisitive}} fear.|$|R
6000|$|... "One imagines {{that you}} did not know Don Martin," [...] Gomez said lightly, {{although}} there was a keen look in <b>his</b> <b>narrowed</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|R
60|$|He moved away, crooning and mumbling. The lama {{turned to}} Kim, {{and all the}} loving old soul of him looked out through <b>his</b> <b>narrow</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Martin Amis: [...] "Established authors often {{speak of}} the ‘coldness’ of novelists, a coldness purported to be {{necessary}} for the documenting process. Amis is not enthralled by the topic, <b>narrows</b> <b>his</b> pale <b>eyes,</b> lights another cigarette, and smokes {{it for a minute}} before speaking. ‘You’re certainly not one removed from your emotions, but a fraction of a removal away. You do have this sort of vampiric attitude to experience.'" ...|$|R
5000|$|Keramet Mumi Keske Memis Efendi - A {{man with}} slanted and <b>narrow</b> <b>eyes.</b> <b>His</b> {{creation}} {{allows him to}} gather as much people around him as he observes their reactions - the cherry colored tent.|$|R
5000|$|In Antonella Gambotto-Burke's novel The Pure Weight of the Heart, Angelica, the protagonist, gets stoned with William Grieve, {{the famous}} novelist, and says: “The first known galactic supernovae {{were seen in}} - were seen in Lupus in 1006. And [...] [...] [...] then [...] [...] [...] in, um [...] [...] [...] in 1054 in Taurus [...] [...] [...] and then in [...] [...] [...] was it 1572 or 1575? One or the other. At any rate, they were {{observed}} in Cassiopeia. And then [...] [...] [...] then [...] [...] [...] um, then [...] [...] [...] did I mention Taurus? I did? Excellent. But there were more. More Supernovae. More supernovae in Serpens. Fifteenth century. Which is interesting. I think so, don’t you? Because I do. Think so. Supernovae in Serpens. Supernovae everywhere.” Grieve <b>narrows</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> and replies: “No supernovae in here.” As Angelica is an astrophysicist, there are mentions of supernovae throughout the book.|$|R
5000|$|In 2015, Pitchfork {{ranked the}} song at number 22 in {{their list of}} [...] "The 200 Best Songs of the 1980s," [...] with Winston Cook-Wilson of the website saying: [...] "In the process of {{stripping}} down, Talking Heads showcased something {{at the root of}} their art: David Byrne’s inimitable gift for melody, and his unique ability to make every musical figure seem both familiar and tied directly to the lyrical thought (see 'I feel numb...born with a weak heart/ I guess I must be having fun'). Is there a better moment of catharsis in a pop then the song's final eureka realization, after Byrne gets whacked with the monolithic spiritual hammer and awakes from a life-encompassing daze into unexpected stability? There’s nothing to <b>narrow</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> at anymore: 'Cover up the blank spots, hit me on the head/ Aaoooh, aaooh, aaooh, aaoooh.' For a band rarely given to addressing issues of the heart head-on, 'Naive Melody' remains an unexpected and peerless achievement." ...|$|R
5000|$|Ephraim Cabot - He is seventy-five, {{tall and}} gaunt, with great, wiry, {{concentrated}} power, but stoop-shouldered from toil. His face is {{as hard as}} if it were hewn out of a boulder, yet there is a weakness in it, a petty pride in its own <b>narrow</b> strength. <b>His</b> <b>eyes</b> are small, close together, and extremely near-sighted, blinking continually in the effort to focus on objects, their stare having a straining, ingrowing quality. He is dressed in his dismal black Sunday suit.|$|R
6000|$|Gnob {{nodded his}} head gravely, his gnarled and age-twisted face inscrutably masking the soul that dwelt behind. <b>His</b> <b>narrow</b> <b>eyes</b> burned like twin coals through their narrow slits, as he piped in a high-cracked voice, [...] "But that is not all." ...|$|R
60|$|He was so attractive, and so repulsive at one. The sardonic suggestivity that flickered {{over his}} face and looked from <b>his</b> <b>narrowed</b> <b>eyes,</b> {{made her want to}} hide, to hide herself away from him and watch him from somewhere unseen.|$|R
6000|$|My heart {{suddenly}} seemed to stop beating. I {{felt as though}} {{the end of the}} world had come. With the light of triumph ablaze in <b>his</b> <b>narrow</b> black <b>eyes,</b> Mr. Cullen was standing by our table! ...|$|R
60|$|Barnes breathed thickly for a moment. Coward he {{knew that}} he was to the marrow of his bones, but other of the evil passions were {{stirring}} in him then. <b>His</b> <b>narrow</b> <b>eyes</b> were alight with greed. He had the animal courage of vermin hard pressed.|$|R
60|$|I {{looked at}} him deliberately. He was wearing English clothes--a dark tweed suit, ill-cut, and {{apparently}} ready-made; but the foreigner was written large all over him, from the tie of his bow to <b>his</b> <b>narrow</b> patent boots. <b>His</b> <b>eyes</b> were fixed anxiously upon me--large black eyes with long, feminine eyelashes. I think {{that if he had}} not been under the shelter of my own roof, I must have laid violent hands upon him.|$|R
60|$|Merlin in {{the hall}} was {{ordering}} two men to stand {{one on each side}} of Déroulède, and two more to follow him into the room. Now he entered it himself, <b>his</b> <b>narrow</b> <b>eyes</b> trying to pierce the semi-obscurity, which was rendered more palpable by the brillant light {{in the hall}}.|$|R
6000|$|The {{stranger}} nodded, and {{the play}} went on, no further word being spoken till the fourth act was reached, when the stranger again said, without taking <b>his</b> <b>narrow</b> black <b>eyes</b> from the stage: 'There's something in that love-making between Stancy and Power that's not all sham!' ...|$|R
6000|$|Thackeray {{is just as}} generous, {{and perhaps}} more critical, in writing of Kingsley. [...] "A fine, honest, go-a-head fellow, who charges a subject heartily, impetuously, with the {{greatest}} courage and simplicity; but with <b>narrow</b> <b>eyes</b> (<b>his</b> are extraordinarily brave, blue and honest), and with little knowledge of the world, I think. But he is superior to us worldlings in many ways, and I wish I had some of his honest pluck." ...|$|R
40|$|OsKar Castlereagh, a man {{well past}} the middle age, sat on a large sofa with his wife, Jeanie. Around them were {{gathered}} men from his profession, all musicians, most of them talented and a few hanging on to still cherished illusions. Castlereagh was obviously the prominent figure of the group, according {{to the number of}} eyes focused upon him. He sat forward with his elbows propped upon his knees, holding a cigarette between two long slender fingers. A spiral cloud of smoke was drifting up past his face to the ceiling making <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> squint. <b>His</b> <b>narrowed</b> <b>eyes</b> made one feel that he was looking through the surface of a face and settling <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> last upon the inner carefully concealed thoughts...|$|R
6000|$|Braile, said, without ceasing to smoke, [...] "You're {{the first}} one I've seen this morning, except my wife. She wasn't at the camp-meeting." [...] His aquiline profile, which met close at the lips {{from the loss of}} his teeth, {{compressed}} itself further in leaving the whole burden of the affair to the man on the claybank, and <b>his</b> <b>narrowed</b> <b>eyes</b> were a line of mocking under the thick gray brows that stuck out like feathers above them.|$|R
60|$|Tarzan become {{suddenly}} rigid as his keen ears {{noted the}} cessation of the regular inspirations and expirations of <b>his</b> companion. <b>His</b> <b>narrowed</b> <b>eyes</b> bored straight down upon the Belgian. Werper {{felt that he was}} lost--he must risk all on his ability to carry on the deception. He sighed, threw both arms outward, and turned over on his back mumbling as though {{in the throes of a}} bad dream. A moment later he resumed the regular breathing.|$|R
