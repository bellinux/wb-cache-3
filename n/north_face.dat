5|$|The <b>north</b> <b>face</b> of Ben Nevis is riven with buttresses, ridges, {{towers and}} pinnacles, and {{contains}} many classic scrambles and rock climbs. It is of major importance for British winter climbing, {{with many of}} its routes holding snow often until late April. It {{was one of the}} first places in Scotland to receive the attention of serious mountaineers, with a descent of Tower Ridge in 1892 the earliest documented climbing expedition on the Ben. (It was not climbed from bottom to top for another two years). The Scottish Mountaineering Club's Charles Inglis Clark hut was built below the <b>north</b> <b>face</b> in Coire Leis in 1929. Because of its remote location, it is said to be the only genuine alpine hut in Britain. It remains popular with climbers, especially in winter.|$|E
5|$|An {{earthquake}} at 8:32:17a.m. PDT (UTC−7) on Sunday, May 18, 1980, {{caused the}} entire weakened <b>north</b> <b>face</b> to slide away, creating the largest landslide ever recorded. This allowed the partly molten, high-pressure gas- and steam-rich {{rock in the}} volcano to suddenly explode northwards toward Spirit Lake in a hot mix of lava and pulverized older rock, overtaking the avalanching face.|$|E
5|$|Flat Bastion is a {{fortification}} in the British Overseas Territory of Gibraltar. Its {{north end}} is along the Charles V Wall, {{from which it}} projects southward. Prince Edward's Gate, Prince Edward's Road, and Trafalgar Cemetery are just {{to the west of}} the bastion. Flat Bastion Road extends to the bastion at the east side of its <b>north</b> <b>face</b> at the Charles V Wall and traverses the bastion at which point it becomes Gardiner's Road.|$|E

5|$|Ben Nevis is {{becoming}} popular with ski mountaineers and boarders. The Red Burn (Allt Coire na h-Urcaire) {{just to the}} North of the tourist path gives the easiest descent, but {{most if not all}} of the easier gullies on the <b>North</b> <b>Face</b> have been skied, as has the slope once adorned by the abseil poles into Coire Leis. No 4 gully is probably the most skied. Although Tower scoop makes it a no-fall zone, Tower Gully {{is becoming}} popular, especially in May and June when there is spring snow.|$|E
5|$|Neanderthals {{are known}} to have lived in caves around the Rock of Gibraltar; in 1848 the first known adult Neanderthal skull, and only the second Neanderthal fossil ever found, was {{excavated}} at Forbes' Quarry on the <b>north</b> <b>face</b> of the Rock. Had the skull been recognised for what it was, the species might have been named Gibraltarians rather than Neanderthals. The date of the skull is unclear but it has been attributed to around the start of the last glacial period about 50,000 years ago.|$|E
5|$|The Liberty Ridge Route, grade IV, {{was first}} climbed by Ome Daiber, Arnie Campbell and Jim Burrow in 1935 and {{is listed as}} one of the Fifty Classic Climbs of North America by Steve Roper and Allen Steck. The Liberty Ridge Route is a {{considerably}} more challenging and objectively dangerous route than the normal route to the summit. This route only accounts for approximately 2% of climbers on the mountain, but accounts for approximately 25% of deaths on the mountain. The Liberty Ridge Route runs up the center of the <b>North</b> <b>Face</b> of Mount Rainier and crosses the very active Carbon Glacier.|$|E

5|$|The Times {{sold the}} {{building}} to advertising executive and sign designer Douglas Leigh in 1961. Leigh then sold {{the building to}} Allied Chemical in 1963. Allied Chemical greatly modified the building's facade in a $10 million renovation, replacing intricate granite and terracotta elements with marble facing. In 1974, the building was sold to investor Alex Parker for $6.25 million, {{and then to the}} Swiss-based investment group Kemekod. Kemekod later sold the tower to an investment group led by Lawrence I. Linksman in 1982. Linksman promised further renovations to the building, including the possibility of using its <b>north</b> <b>face</b> for signage displays.|$|E
5|$|The inaugural parade route {{ran along}} Pennsylvania Avenue,N.W. from the U.S.Capitol, ending at the <b>north</b> <b>face</b> of the White House. During {{most of the}} parade, President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama {{traveled}} in the new armored limousine because of potential security threats. The President and First Lady twice exited their limousine, walking on Pennsylvania Avenue for portions of the parade. Vice President Biden and his wife Jill walked the parade route at several points with their children Beau, Hunter and Ashley.|$|E
5|$|The {{replacement}} 'T' on the <b>north</b> <b>face</b> of Tech Tower {{was stolen}} on May 28, 2001 by three students, {{two of whom}} were found guilty of numerous conduct code violations by the Undergraduate Judiciary Cabinet and subsequently suspended. The students had successfully removed the 'T' from its mount but {{were caught in the}} act by authorities when the removal triggered an alarm. In October 2005, a replica of the 'T' was stolen from the Student Services Building and returned two days later.|$|E

5|$|The second {{cross is}} tall and slender, a free {{standing}} monolith pillar-cross, with a slender rounded shaft (changing to square above) and a free armed head formed by notching the shaft. It is carved with figures in traditional Welsh style. One figure in particular, which looks much like {{the figure of a}} saint, is inscribed low on the <b>north</b> <b>face.</b> The Cross of St Padarn is granophyre and has Celtic interlace in panels down one face. It is uncertainly dated between the ninth and eleventh century. Though not comparable with the great Irish high crosses, it shows sophisticated carving, and willingness to bring the stone from the Mawdddach estuary, Gwynedd.|$|E
5|$|Within 20 {{years of}} its construction, {{alterations}} were made that expanded the shops and changed the façades. By {{the end of the}} 18th century it had been damaged by floods, but it was rebuilt to a similar design. Over the next century alterations to the shops included cantilevered extensions on the bridge's <b>north</b> <b>face.</b> In the 20th century several schemes were carried out to preserve the bridge and partially return it to its original appearance, enhancing its appeal as a tourist attraction.|$|E
5|$|A quadrangular castle, Bodiam {{is roughly}} square-shaped. This type of castle, {{with a central}} {{courtyard}} and buildings against the curtain wall, was characteristic of castle architecture in the 14th century. Bodiam Castle {{has been described by}} military historian Cathcart King as the most complete surviving example of a quadrangular castle. There are circular towers at each of the four corners, with square central towers in the south, east, and west walls. The main entrance is a twin-towered gatehouse in the <b>north</b> <b>face</b> of the castle. There is a second entrance from the south; the postern gate is through a square tower {{in the middle of the}} south wall. The towers are three storeys high, taller than the curtain walls and the buildings in the castle which are two storeys high.|$|E

5|$|A route {{popular with}} {{experienced}} hillwalkers starts at Torlundy, {{a few miles}} north-east of Fort William on the A82 road, and follows the path alongside the Allt a' Mhuilinn. It can also be reached from Glen Nevis by following the Pony Track as far as Lochan Meall an t-Suidhe, then descending slightly to the CIC Hut. The route then ascends Càrn Mòr Dearg and continues along the Càrn Mòr Dearg Arête ("CMD Arête") before climbing steeply to the summit of Ben Nevis. This route involves a total of 1,500 metres of ascent and requires modest scrambling ability and a head for heights. In common with other approaches {{on this side of}} the mountain, it has the advantage of giving an extensive view of the cliffs of the <b>north</b> <b>face,</b> which are hidden from the Pony Track.|$|E
5|$|At midday on 16 August, von Kluge {{had refused}} {{an order from}} Hitler for another counter-attack, and in the {{afternoon}} Hitler agreed to a withdrawal but became suspicious that von Kluge intended to surrender to the Allies. Late on 17 August, Hitler sacked von Kluge and recalled him to Germany; von Kluge then either killed himself or was executed by SS-officer Jürgen Stroop for {{his involvement in the}} 20 July plot. Von Kluge was succeeded by Field Marshal Walter Model, whose first act was to order the immediate retreat of the 7th Army and Fifth Panzer Army, while the II SS Panzer Corps—with the remnants of four Panzer divisions—held the <b>north</b> <b>face</b> of the escape route against the British and Canadians, and the XLVII Panzer Corps—with what was left of two Panzer divisions—held the southern face against the Third US Army.|$|E
5|$|The <b>north</b> <b>face</b> is {{also one}} of Scotland's {{foremost}} venues for winter mountaineering and ice climbing, and holds snow until quite late in the year; in a good year, routes may remain in winter condition until mid-spring. Most of the possible rock routes are also suitable as winter climbs, including the four main ridges; Tower Ridge, for example, is grade IV on the Scottish winter grading system, having been upgraded in 2009 by the Scottish Mountaineering Club after requests by the local Mountain Rescue Team, there being numerous benightments and incidents every winter season. Probably the most popular ice climb on Ben Nevis is The Curtain (IV,5) {{on the left side of}} the Càrn Dearg Buttress. At the top end of the scale, Centurion in winter is a grade VIII,8 face climb.|$|E

25|$|Up to 1970, Reinhold Messner {{had made}} a name for himself mainly through his {{achievements}} in the Alps. Between 1960 and 1964, he led over 500 ascents, most of them in the Dolomites. In 1965, he climbed a new direttissima route on the <b>north</b> <b>face</b> of the Ortler. A year later, he climbed the Walker Spur on the Grandes Jorasses and ascended the Rocchetta Alta di Bosconero. In 1967 he made the first ascent of the northeast face of the Agnér and the first winter ascents of the Agnér <b>north</b> <b>face</b> and Furchetta <b>north</b> <b>face.</b>|$|E
