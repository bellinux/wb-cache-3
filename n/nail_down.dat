5|$|The Canadian {{embassy in}} Moscow {{learned of the}} Soviets' {{interest}} in a series initially through reading {{an article in the}} Soviet Izvestia newspaper in the winter of 1971–1972. Diplomat Gary Smith, responsible for sport and cultural exchanges with the Soviet Union, read that the Soviets were looking for a new challenge in ice hockey. Smith met with Izvestia sports editor Boris Fedosov initially, then followed up with a meeting with Soviet hockey boss Andrei Starovoitov. The Soviets divulged that they were ready to play in a series between its national team and Canadian professionals. After the meetings, Canadian ambassador Robert Ford passed the matter to Ottawa to negotiate a series and Hockey Canada was given the task to <b>nail</b> <b>down</b> the terms for a series.|$|E

25|$|With Van der Sar injured for {{the first}} two months of the 2009–10 season, Foster was given the {{opportunity}} to <b>nail</b> <b>down</b> the number one shirt in the 2009 FA Community Shield defeat to Chelsea, where his mistakes led to two Chelsea goals and made no saves in the penalty shootout. Foster continued to play in the League, starting with the opening day victory over Birmingham City. In wins against Arsenal and Manchester City, Foster received heavy criticism for massive errors that led to opposition goals. Manager Alex Ferguson stated that he believes in Foster's abilities and potential; however, eight days later, Foster was again criticised for a mistake which led to a Sunderland goal in a 2–2 draw, and left out of the England squad the next day with bruised ribs. However, following Robert Green's red card in the match against Ukraine and consequent suspension, Foster was given the all-clear by doctors and recalled to the England squad for the match against Belarus on 14 October. Foster played only twice more in 2009 for Manchester United after the Sunderland match: a League Cup win against Championship team Barnsley, and a Champions League tie versus Beşiktaş, with Manchester United's progress from the group already secured. He was displaced from the first team in Van der Sar's absence by Tomasz Kuszczak, and on occasion, reserve goalkeeper Ben Amos took Foster's place on the substitutes bench. Foster started his first match for three months against West Ham in February 2010, keeping a clean sheet in a 3–0 victory.|$|E

Further, he suggested that if the dam were to be named after any one person, it should be for California Senator Hiram Johnson, a lead sponsor of the authorizing legislation. Roosevelt also referred to the dam as Boulder Dam, and the Republican-leaning Los Angeles Times, which at the time of Ickes' name change had run an editorial cartoon showing Ickes ineffectively chipping away at an enormous sign [...] "HOOVER DAM," [...] reran it showing Roosevelt reinforcing Ickes, but having no greater success.|$|E
500|$|In {{his final}} {{appearance}} of 2011, Gosling co-starred with Philip Seymour Hoffman {{in the political}} drama The Ides of March directed by George Clooney, in which he played an ambitious press secretary. Gosling partly decided to do the film to become more politically aware: [...] "I'm Canadian and so American politics aren't really in my wheelhouse." [...] Joe Morganstern of the Wall Street Journal said that Gosling and Hoffman [...] "are eminently well equipped to play variations on their characters' main themes. Yet neither actor has great material to conjure with in the script." [...] In a generally tepid review, Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times asserted that it was [...] "certainly involving to see the charismatic Gosling verbally spar with superb character actors like Hoffman and [...] Giamatti." [...] Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle felt there was [...] "one aspect to the character that Gosling can't quite <b>nail</b> <b>down,</b> that might simply be outside his sphere, which is idealism." [...] He {{was nominated for a}} Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama. The film grossed $66 million worldwide.|$|E
500|$|The album's cover art (known as the 'Screaming Elf') is a {{distorted}} {{photograph of the}} band members, photographed by Kevin Westenberg, above {{a black and white}} upside-down burning forest. Concerning the artwork, Cornell said, [...] "Superunknown relates to birth in a way... Being born or even dying—getting flushed into something that you know nothing about. The hardest thing is to <b>nail</b> <b>down</b> a visual image to put on a title like that. The first thing we thought of was a forest in grey or black. Soundgarden has always been associated with images of flowers and lush colors and this was the opposite. It still seemed organic but it was very dark and cold... I was into those stories as a kid where forests were full of evil and scary things as opposed to being happy gardens that you go camping in." [...] In a 1994 Pulse! magazine interview, Cornell said that the inspiration for the album's title came from his misreading of a video entitled Superclown. He added, [...] "I thought it was a cool title. I'd never heard it before, never saw it before, and it inspired me." [...] The album also saw a limited release on 12" [...] colored vinyl (blue, orange, and clear), as a double-LP in a gatefold sleeve. The album's title 'SUPERUNKNOWN' is sometimes displayed with the [...] "UNKNOWN" [...] as semi upside down and reversed lettering (stylized as [...] "SUPER∩ИKИOWИ").|$|E

He found the sea a sanctuary, {{spending}} about thirty weekends {{a year on}} the water, with a particular fondness for sailing around Catalina Island. He once said, [...] "An actor needs something to stabilize his personality, something to <b>nail</b> <b>down</b> what he really is, not what he is currently pretending to be."

2500|$|Following a rough outing in long {{relief for}} Jacob Turner the {{previous}} day, the Nationals designated him for assignment on July 1. Left-handed reliever Sammy Solis was activated off the 60-day disabled list. The Nationals rallied {{in the ninth}} inning of their July 1 game against the St. Louis Cardinals, scoring a run and loading the bases against closer Trevor Rosenthal. St. Louis brought in reliever Matt Bowman to try to <b>nail</b> <b>down</b> his first career save, while Nationals manager Dusty Baker sent infielder Adrián Sánchez to the plate to pinch-hit in his first MLB at-bat. Sánchez worked the count full before taking a pitch roughly six inches off the plate away for what would have been ball four and a game-tying walk, but home plate umpire Manny Gonzalez called him out on strikes to end the game at 2–1 in the Cardinals' favor. Baker praised Sánchez after the game, saying the call [...] "just wasn't fair to him" [...] and remarking, [...] "You hate to have an at-bat like that and have it settled on apparently a bad call." [...] In the following game, on July 2, minutes after being named to play in the 2017 All-Star Game as the top overall National League vote-getter, right fielder Bryce Harper hit two home runs off fellow All-Star Carlos Martínez. Starting pitcher Max Scherzer, also named to the All-Star roster, struck out 12 Cardinals while allowing no runs in seven innings to earn the 7–2 win.|$|E
