40|$|The {{work in this}} {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} fluid-structure interaction phenomena {{in a series of}} three experimental studies. The first two sets of experiments were conducted in a large, water-filled pressure vessel with a <b>nominal</b> <b>internal</b> <b>diameter</b> of 1. 77 m. Cylindrical shells were made from thin-walled aluminum and brass tubes with circular cross-sections (internal diameters D) and internal clearance-fit aluminum end caps. Implosion and explosion events were photographed with a high-speed camera (27, 000 frames per second), and the waterborne pressure waves resulting from the implosion were measured simultaneously with underwater blast sensors. The natural implosions were generated by raising the ambient water pressure slowly to a value, Pc, just above the elastic instability limit of the models. For the models with larger L/D, where L is the internal length of the model, the model cross sections flattened during the implosion (mode 2). It was found that the amplitude of these mode 2 pressure waves scale with the pressure difference Pc-Pi (where Pi is the internal pressure of the air inside the cylindrical models) and the time scales with the characteristic bubble collapse time. The geometry and material properties of the structure seem to play only a secondary role. During the explosion experiments, the pressure vessel is pressurized to various pressure levels below the natural implosion pressure of the models and an explosive was set off nearby. It was found that the implosion is induced by one of two mechanisms: the shockwave generated by the explosion and the hydrodynamic pressure field of the explosion bubble during its collapse and re-expansion. In the final experimental study, the impact of a plunging breaking wave (wavelength, 1. 2 m) on a partially submerged cube (with dimensions L = 0. 3048 m) is studied in a wave tank (14. 8 m long). The water free surface shape upstream of the cube before and after the wave impact was measured with cinematic Laser-Induced Fluorescence (LIF), employing a high-speed digital camera, a laser light sheet and fluorescent dye mixed with the water. It was observed that for some cube positions, the free surface between the front face of the cube and the wave crest forms a circular arc that converges to a point and forms a high-velocity vertical jet (about 3 m/s). Although these problems are intrinsically different, they are flows dominated by inertial forces (viscous effects are not important) where a rapidly collapsing interface shape produces high-pressure waves...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{shows the}} {{influence}} of pipeline diameters, on Leak Detection and Isolation. Nowdays, there are many publications, which deal with leak isolation, by using Model- Based approach. Those methods require accurate parameters to isolate the leak. In general, if the parameters are not correctly known, the leak isolation fails, and using parameter values {{provided by the supplier}} may be misleading. In the present paper, it is pointed out how a small variation on the diameter parameter can cause considerable variations in the so-called Equivalent Straight Length, and consequently lead to bad leak isolation. Difference between <b>nominal</b> <b>diameter</b> and <b>internal</b> <b>diameter</b> is presented as well as its impact on the LDI algorithm.

40|$|Australian {{utility pole}} network is aging and {{reaching}} its end of life, with 70 % of the 5 million poles currently in-service nationally installed within the 20 {{years following the}} end of World War II. The estimated investment required for the replacement or remedial maintenance of the aging 3. 5 millions poles is as high as 1. 75 billion dollars. Additionally, an estimated 21, 700 high-durability new poles are required each year, representing further investment of 13. 5 million dollars per year. Yet, agreements which progressively phase out logging of native forests around Australia have been signed, giving the industry about 25 years to make the transition from Crown native forests to plantations and private forests. As utility poles were traditionally cut from native forest hardwood species, finding solutions to source new poles currently presents a challenge. This paper presents tests on Veneer Based Composite hardwood hollow utility poles manufactured from Gympie messmate (Eucalyptus cloeziana) plantation thinning. Small diameter poles of <b>nominal</b> 115 mm <b>internal</b> <b>diameter</b> and 15 mm wall-thickness were manufactured in two half-poles butt jointed together, using 9 veneers per halfpole.
