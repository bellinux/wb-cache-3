5|$|Uranium metal {{reacts with}} almost all <b>non-metal</b> {{elements}} (with {{the exception of}} the noble gases) and their compounds, with reactivity increasing with temperature. Hydrochloric and nitric acids dissolve uranium, but non-oxidizing acids other than hydrochloric acid attack the element very slowly. When finely divided, it can react with cold water; in air, uranium metal becomes coated with a dark layer of uranium oxide. Uranium in ores is extracted chemically and converted into uranium dioxide or other chemical forms usable in industry.|$|E
5|$|In chemistry, a nonmetal (or <b>non-metal)</b> is a {{chemical}} element that mostly lacks metallic attributes. Physically, nonmetals {{tend to be}} highly volatile (easily vaporized), have low elasticity, and are good insulators of heat and electricity; chemically, {{they tend to have}} high ionization energy and electronegativity values, and gain or share electrons when they react with other elements or compounds. Seventeen elements are generally classified as nonmetals; most are gases (hydrogen, helium, nitrogen, oxygen, fluorine, neon, chlorine, argon, krypton, xenon and radon); one is a liquid (bromine), and a few are solids (carbon, phosphorus, sulphur, selenium, and iodine).|$|E
25|$|An {{ionic bond}} is formed when a metal loses {{one or more}} of its electrons, {{becoming}} a positively charged cation, and the electrons are then gained by the <b>non-metal</b> atom, becoming a negatively charged anion. The two oppositely charged ions attract one another, and the ionic bond is the electrostatic force of attraction between them. For example, sodium (Na), a metal, loses one electron to become an Na+ cation while chlorine (Cl), a <b>non-metal,</b> gains this electron to become Cl−. The ions are held together due to electrostatic attraction, and that compound sodium chloride (NaCl), or common table salt, is formed.|$|E

25|$|Twists or Torsade, threads made of {{multiple}} strands of metal twisted together are also sometimes used, some of which, such as Soutache, sometimes have different colored metals or colored <b>non-metal</b> threads twisted together.

25|$|There are {{a variety}} of chemicals, both metal and <b>non-metal,</b> that can be added to steel {{to make it easier to}} cut. These {{additives}} may work by lubricating the tool-chip interface, decreasing the shear strength of the material, or increasing the brittleness of the chip. Historically, sulphur and lead have been the most common additives, but bismuth and tin are increasingly popular for environmental reasons.|$|E

25|$|Antimony is a soft (MH 3.0) {{and brittle}} semi-metallic element. It is {{commonly}} {{regarded as a}} metalloid, or by some other authors as either a metal or a <b>non-metal.</b> It exhibits poor electrical conductivity which, like a metal, decreases with temperature. It has a relatively open and partially covalent crystalline structure (BCN 3+3). Antimony forms covalent bonds with most other elements. The oxide in its preferred oxidation state (Sb2O3, +3) is amphoteric. Antimony forms a series of anionic antimonites and antimonates such as NaSbO2 and AlSbO4, and Zintl phases such as K5Sb4, Sr2Sb3 and BaSb3.|$|E

[...] In the first step, a reaction between phenylacetone and formamide, either using additional formic acid or formamide itself as a reducing agent, yields [...] [...] This intermediate is then hydrolyzed using hydrochloric acid, and subsequently basified, extracted with organic solvent, concentrated, and distilled to yield the free base. The free base is then dissolved in an organic solvent, sulfuric acid added, and amphetamine precipitates out as the sulfate salt.|$|E

Oxygen is named for its formation of acids, especially with <b>non-metals.</b> Some oxides of some <b>non-metals</b> are extremely acidic, like sulfur trioxide, which forms sulfuric acid on contact with water. Most oxides with metals are alkaline, some extremely so, like potassium oxide. Some metallic oxides are amphoteric, like aluminum oxide, which means that they can react with both acids and bases.|$|R
500|$|In 1991, Huey said Metallica {{with new}} {{producer}} Bob Rock simplified and streamlined its music {{for a more}} commercial approach to appeal to mainstream audiences. Robert Palmer of Rolling Stone said the band abandoned its aggressive, fast tempos to expand its music and expressive range. The change in direction proved commercially successful; Metallica was the band's first album to peak at {{number one on the}} Billboard 200. Metallica noticed changes to the rock scene created by the grunge movement of the early 1990s. In Load—an album that has been described as having [...] "an almost alternative rock" [...] approach—the band changed musical direction and focused on <b>non-metal</b> influences. Metallica's new lyrical approach moved away from drugs and monsters, and focused on anger, loss, and retribution. Some fans and critics were not pleased with this change, which included haircuts, the cover art of Load, and headlining the alternative rock concert Lollapalooza. David Fricke of Rolling Stone described the move as [...] "goodbye to the moldy stricture and dead-end Puritanism of no-frills thrash", and called Load the heaviest record of 1996. With the release of ReLoad in 1997, the band displayed blues and early hard rock influences, incorporating more rhythm and harmony in song structures.|$|E

25|$|As of 2012, {{there are}} 118 known elements, about 80 {{of which are}} stable – that is, they do not change by {{radioactive}} decay into other elements. Some elements can occur {{as more than a}} single chemical substance (allotropes). For instance, oxygen exists as both diatomic oxygen (O2) and ozone (O3). The majority of elements are classified as metals. These are elements with a characteristic lustre such as iron, copper, and gold. Metals typically conduct electricity and heat well, and they are malleable and ductile. Around a dozen elements, such as carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen, are classified as <b>non-metals.</b> <b>Non-metals</b> lack the metallic properties described above, they also have a high electronegativity and a tendency to form negative ions. Certain elements such as silicon sometimes resemble metals and sometimes resemble <b>non-metals,</b> and are known as metalloids.|$|R

Eddy currents are created by rapidly alternating magnetic fields, which induce metals to jump away from <b>non-metals.</b> Then water separation is used to sort plastics and glass from circuit boards and copper wires. Circuit boards and copper content is then sold. Plastics and glass are further compacted for reuse.|$|R
