And this is – {{this is one of the}} drawbacks that we've had with so many troops having been put into this constant rotational basis inside one country when we have a war against international terrorism that's global." ...|$|E

He went on to study theology at the University of Copenhagen. He {{had little interest in}} historical works, philosophy dissatisfied him, and he couldn't see [...] "dedicating himself to Speculation". He said, [...] "What I really <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> get clear about [...] "what am I to do", not what I must know." [...] He wanted to [...] "lead a completely human life and not merely one of knowledge". Kierkegaard didn't want to be a philosopher in the traditional or Hegelian sense and he didn't want to preach a Christianity that was an illusion. [...] "But he had learned from his father that one can do what one wills, and his father's life had not discredited this theory." ...|$|E

30|$|Legal {{regulations}} for RC should {{bridge the gap}} between (eco-)toxicological data generated by experts and risk perceptions of non-experts. Ideally, products posing no risks would not require any RC process. Yet, as long as PCPs pose a residual risk, the legal requirements should be adequate to ensure that consumers are informed and are able to understand the information provided in order to make informed choices. RC is the process through which individuals are informed about potential hazards and risks for risk mitigation decision making and management, often with the intention of provoking safety behaviors [3, 45 – 48]. The process of communicating risks is not static, nor are there universally agreed upon approaches. Over the past 25  years, RC has evolved in developed countries as RC practitioners continued to identify more effective strategies. In 1995, Fischhoff listed these stages, each building on the former, as (1) all practitioners <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> make sure the statistics were right, (2) all practitioners <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> present the statistics, (3) all practitioners <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> explain what the statistics meant, (4) all practitioners <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> show that similar risks had previously been accepted, (5) all practitioners <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>was</b> illustrate that the risk is good for those exposed, (6) all practitioners <b>needed</b> was <b>to</b> treat those exposed nicely, (7) all practitioners <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> make those exposed to the risk partners, and (8) all practitioners <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> incorporate all of the above stages [49, 50]. The more recent literature on RC indicates that it should be a two-way process - that is, a process that involves consultation with and participation by the general public/consumers [3, 46]. This could be seen as falling under Fischhoff’s seventh stage. In developing and low-middle-income countries like SA, however, the RC process has not evolved and tends to be at Fischhoff’s stages 1 and 2 - that is, risks are communicated through a top-down approach (one-way communication), or risk information is just presented (i.e. listed on the label) [46]. In the EU, the recognition of consultation and participation is referred to in several documents rather than implemented in practice. This is particularly the case with PCP labels and results in the EU paying lip service to Fischhoff’s stage 7. The reality is that two-way RC is costly and time consuming. Thus, the challenge is to move from policy to practice in order to protect consumers.|$|R

60|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} it one ought to examine a coco-nut {{in the act of}} budding, and to do this {{it is by no means}} necessary to visit the West Indies or the Pacific Islands; all you <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> ask a Covent Garden fruit salesman to get you a few 'growers.' On the voyage to England, a certain number of precocious coco-nuts, stimulated by the congenial warmth and damp of most shipholds, usually begin to sprout before their time; and these waste nuts are sold by the dealers at a low rate to East-end children and inquiring botanists. An examination of a 'grower' very soon convinces one what is the use of the milk in the coco-nut.|$|E
60|$|I will detain you no longer. I {{hope that}} I {{have made it}} clear that we {{conceive}} the end of education on its literary side to be to make a man and not a cyclopaedia, to make a citizen and not an album of elegant extracts. Literature does not end with knowledge of forms, with inventories of books and authors, with finding the key of rhythm, with the varying measure of the stanza, or the changes from the involved and sonorous periods of the seventeenth century down to the staccato of the nineteenth, or all the rest of the technicalities of scholarship. Do not think I contemn these. They are all good things to know, but they are not ends in themselves. The intelligent man, says Plato, will prize those studies which result in his soul getting soberness, righteousness, and wisdom, and he will less value the others. Literature is one of the instruments, and one of the most powerful instruments, for forming character for giving us men and women armed with reason, braced by knowledge, clothed with steadfastness and courage, and inspired by that public spirit and public virtue of which it has been well said that they are the brightest ornaments of the mind of man. Bacon is right, as he generally is, when he bids us read not to contradict and refute, nor to believe and take for granted, nor to find talk and discourse, but to weigh and to consider. Yes, let us read to weigh and to consider. In the times before us that promise or threaten deep political, economical, and social controversy, what we <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> induce our people to weigh and consider. We want them to cultivate energy without impatience, activity without restlessness, inflexibility without ill-humour. I am not going to preach to you any artificial stoicism. I am not going to preach to you any indifference to money, or to the pleasures of social intercourse, or to the esteem and good-will of our neighbours, or to any other of the consolations and necessities of life. But, after all, the thing that matters most, both for happiness and for duty, is that we should strive habitually to live with wise thoughts and right feelings. Literature helps us more than other studies to this most blessed companionship of wise thoughts and right feelings, and so I have taken this opportunity of earnestly commending it to your interest and care.|$|E
