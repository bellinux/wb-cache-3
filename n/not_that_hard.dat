UAE conditions differ significantly from those of Pakistan due to the Gulf's sandy soils. Bowlers with a straight arm action like Johan Botha tend to reap wickets at these pitches.

500|$|... "Open Your Heart" [...] has a {{continuous}} percussion filled structure and a chorus sounding like Belinda Carlisle, according to author Rikky Rooksby {{in his book}} The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna. Lyrically, [...] "Open Your Heart" [...] is a simple love song. According to Professor Mavis Tsai, the phrase [...] "Open Your Heart" [...] {{is a metaphor for}} the act of being vulnerable that corresponds to the behavior involved in developing an intimate or close relationship. The following lines in the song, [...] "Open Your Heart, I'll make you love me; It's <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>hard,</b> if you just turn the key" [...] illustrate this metaphor vividly. The concept of the song places Madonna as a victim of love.|$|E
500|$|Kid A {{received}} a Grammy Award for Best Alternative Album and a nomination for Album of the Year in early 2001. It won both praise and criticism in independent music circles for appropriating underground styles of music; some mainstream British critics saw Kid A as a [...] "commercial suicide note", labelling it [...] "intentionally difficult" [...] and {{longing for a}} return to the band's earlier style. Radiohead's fans were similarly divided; along with those who were appalled or mystified, there were many who saw the album as the band's best work. Yorke, however, denied that Radiohead had set out to eschew commercial expectations, saying: [...] "I was really, really amazed at how badly [...] was being viewed... because the music's <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>hard</b> to grasp. We're not trying to be difficult... We're actually trying to communicate but somewhere along the line, we just seemed to piss off a lot of people... What we're doing isn't that radical." [...] The album has since been ranked one of the best of all time by publications including Time and Rolling Stone; Pitchfork, the Times and Rolling Stone named it the best album of the decade.|$|E
2500|$|Being very {{detached}} from the Hollywood scene, Murray {{does not have an}} agent or manager and reportedly only fields offers for scripts and roles using a personal telephone number with a voice mailbox that he checks infrequently. This practice has the downside of sometimes preventing him from taking parts in films such as Who Framed Roger Rabbit, Monsters, Inc., The Squid and the Whale, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, and Little Miss Sunshine. [...] When asked about this practice, however, Murray seemed content with his inaccessibility, stating, [...] "It's <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>hard.</b> If you have a good script that's what gets you involved.

I dined to-day with Mr. Secretary St. John, on condition I might choose my company, which were Lord Rivers, Lord Carteret, Sir Thomas Mansel,(1) and Mr. Lewis; I invited Masham, Hill, Sir John Stanley, and George Granville, but they were engaged; and I did it in revenge of his having such bad company when I dined with him before; so we laughed, etc. And I ventured {{to go to church}} to-day, which I have not done this month before. Can you send me such a good account of Stella's health, pray now? Yes, I hope, and better too. We dined (says you) at the Dean's, and played at cards till twelve, and there came in Mr. French, and Dr. Travors, and Dr. Whittingham, and Mr. (I forget his name, that I always tell Mrs. Walls of) the banker's son, a pox on him. And we were so merry; I vow they are pure good company. But I lost a crown; for you must know I had always hands tempting me to go out, but never took in anything, and often two black aces without a manilio; was <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>hard,</b> Presto?
