5|$|Although it is {{important}} in catabolism, NADH is also used in anabolic reactions, such as gluconeogenesis. This need for NADH in anabolism poses a problem for prokaryotes growing on nutrients that release {{only a small amount}} of energy. For example, nitrifying bacteria such as Nitrobacter oxidize <b>nitrite</b> to nitrate, which releases sufficient energy to pump protons and generate ATP, but not enough to produce NADH directly. As NADH is still needed for anabolic reactions, these bacteria use a <b>nitrite</b> oxidoreductase to produce enough proton-motive force to run part of the electron transport chain in reverse, generating NADH.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} follow the {{modifications}} in time of milk <b>nitrites</b> quantity which are contained in cheese, we created the follwing experimental model. From the same known milk quantity with a known fat content we formed 4 milk control groups in which we added different natrium <b>nitrites</b> quantities (20, 40, 60 mg natrium nitrits in 100 ml milk). After each milk control group processing we analyzed the clot and the whey {{in order to establish}} the <b>nitrites</b> content. We performed analyzis from cheese and salt over 21 days with one week break. Obtained results evidenced that during cheese processing the <b>nitrites</b> quantity is 3 times reduced depending on <b>nitrites</b> milk content. During maturation <b>nitrites</b> are distributed in cheese and salt and are progressively reduced leading after 21 days to a decrease under the maximum admitted level of 7 mg%...|$|R

40|$|New SIA {{method was}} {{developed}} for simultaneous determination of <b>nitrites</b> and nitrates. <b>Nitrites</b> were analyzed by Griess reaction. Nitrates were determined after their reduction to <b>nitrites</b> in cadmium column. Absorbance was measured at maximum of absorption 540 nm. Optimal conditions for analysis: speed of peristaltic pump is 40 % of its maximal speed, speed of syringe pump is 50 µl. s- 1, sample volume of <b>nitrites</b> and nitrates is 150 µl. Optimal time for reduction of nitrates is 0 sec, it means during their flow through cadmium column. Method was used for analysis of <b>nitrites</b> and nitrates in samples of waters: Fromin, Bonaqua, Rajec, Mattoni and tap water in Hradec Králové. Obtained values were compared with values declared by producers. New SIA method for simultaneous determination of <b>nitrites</b> and nitrates is used in subject Special methods of instrumental analysis as a new practical task...|$|R
5|$|<b>Nitrite</b> is also {{a common}} ligand that can {{coordinate}} in five ways. The most common are nitro (bonded from the nitrogen) and nitrito (bonded from an oxygen). Nitro-nitrito isomerism is common, where the nitrito form is usually less stable.|$|E
5|$|Researchers {{recently}} discovered archaeal involvement in ammonia oxidation reactions. These reactions {{are particularly important}} in the oceans. The archaea also appear crucial for ammonia oxidation in soils. They produce <b>nitrite,</b> which other microbes then oxidize to nitrate. Plants and other organisms consume the latter.|$|E
5|$|Some prokaryotes use redox pairs {{that have}} only a small {{difference}} in midpoint potential. For example, nitrifying bacteria such as Nitrobacter oxidize <b>nitrite</b> to nitrate, donating the electrons to oxygen. The small amount of energy released in this reaction is enough to pump protons and generate ATP, {{but not enough to}} produce NADH or NADPH directly for use in anabolism. This problem is solved by using a <b>nitrite</b> oxidoreductase to produce enough proton-motive force to run part of the electron transport chain in reverse, causing complex I to generate NADH.|$|E
40|$|The surface {{species formed}} during {{adsorption}} of NOx {{on a commercial}} NSR catalyst (containing barium oxide, Pt, and alumina as the main components) were investigated by in situ IR spectroscopy. During adsorption of NO, mainly linear and bridged bonded <b>nitrites</b> of Ba- O- N- O- Ba type were formed on Al and Ba oxide components. <b>Nitrites</b> were detected during the initial phase of the NO/O 2 and NO 2 adsorption, whereas with further exposure nitrates were the dominant surface species. Using the different surface species and reaction intermediates identified by IR spectroscopy a series of sequential reaction steps during the sorption of NOx on a NSR catalyst was derived. Initially, NO is stored {{in the form of}} <b>nitrites</b> on the storage component (Ba oxide). NO 2 formed by oxidation on the noble metal component (Pt) sorbs either molecularly by forming nitrate species or dissociatively by forming <b>nitrites.</b> After a certain concentration of NOx is adsorbed, the transformation and further oxidation of the surface <b>nitrites</b> into surface nitrates by NO 2 occur. The stability of the NOx surface species was found to increase in the order Al <b>nitrites</b> < Ba <b>nitrites</b> < Al nitrates < Ba nitrates...|$|R
25|$|Other alkyl <b>nitrites</b> were outlawed in the U.S. by Congress {{through the}} Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988. The law {{includes}} {{an exception for}} commercial purpose, defined as any use other than {{for the production of}} consumer products containing volatile alkyl <b>nitrites</b> meant for inhaling or otherwise introducing volatile alkyl <b>nitrites</b> into the human body for euphoric or physical effects. The law came into effect in 1990.|$|R
50|$|For most people, {{the highest}} dietary source of nitrates is from fruits and {{vegetables}} and no studies have conclusively linked nitrates and <b>nitrites</b> to cancer or any other form of diseases. On the contrary, some research has hinted to beneficial properties of <b>nitrites</b> such as lowering blood pressure by slightly expanding arteries. The only reason nitrates and <b>nitrites</b> came under such legal scrutiny is when the US Food and Drug Administration presented a brief report which stated that some adverse effect was observed on mice (“depression of growth”) when their intake of <b>nitrites</b> was up to 90% of daily diet.|$|R
5|$|Nitric oxide's rapid {{reaction}} {{with water}} in animals results in production of its metabolite <b>nitrite.</b> Animal metabolism of nitrogen in proteins, in general, results in excretion of urea, while animal metabolism of nucleic acids results in excretion of urea and uric acid. The characteristic odour of animal flesh decay {{is caused by}} the creation of long-chain, nitrogen-containing amines, such as putrescine and cadaverine, which are breakdown products of the amino acids ornithine and lysine, respectively, in decaying proteins.|$|E
5|$|Chemolithotrophy {{is a type}} of {{metabolism}} {{found in}} prokaryotes where energy is obtained from the oxidation of inorganic compounds. These organisms can use hydrogen, reduced sulfur compounds (such as sulfide, hydrogen sulfide and thiosulfate), ferrous iron (FeII) or ammonia as sources of reducing power and they gain energy from the oxidation of these compounds with electron acceptors such as oxygen or <b>nitrite.</b> These microbial processes are important in global biogeochemical cycles such as acetogenesis, nitrification and denitrification and are critical for soil fertility.|$|E
5|$|The {{oxidation}} state +5 {{can be produced}} by dissolving manganese dioxide in molten sodium <b>nitrite.</b> Manganate (VI) salts can be produced by dissolving Mn compounds, such as manganese dioxide, in molten alkali while exposed to air. Permanganate (+7 {{oxidation state}}) compounds are purple, and can give glass a violet color. Potassium permanganate, sodium permanganate, and barium permanganate are all potent oxidizers. Potassium permanganate, also called Condy's crystals, is a commonly used laboratory reagent because of its oxidizing properties; it {{is used as a}} topical medicine (for example, in the treatment of fish diseases). Solutions of potassium permanganate were among the first stains and fixatives {{to be used in the}} preparation of biological cells and tissues for electron microscopy.|$|E

5000|$|Eating cured meat {{products}} {{has been linked}} to a small increase in gastric cancer, as well as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. [...] The negative effects are presumed to be caused by nitrates and <b>nitrites,</b> as well as nitrosamines which are formed by <b>nitrites</b> reacting with meat. These risks are generally regarded as minimal, and regulations in the United States limit ingoing <b>nitrites</b> to 156 parts per million (0.0156%) (less for bacon) as a precautionary measure.|$|R
25|$|The {{conversion}} of ammonium to nitrate is performed primarily by soil-living bacteria and other nitrifying bacteria. In the primary stage of nitrification, the oxidation of ammonium (NH) is performed by bacteria {{such as the}} Nitrosomonas species, which converts ammonia to <b>nitrites</b> (NO). Other bacterial species such as Nitrobacter, {{are responsible for the}} oxidation of the <b>nitrites</b> (NO) into nitrates (NO). It is important for the ammonia (NH) to be converted to nitrates or <b>nitrites</b> because ammonia gas is toxic to plants.|$|R
5|$|Various {{causes for}} the {{dramatic}} decreases in population have been proposed, including predation, in particular by Eurasian sparrowhawks; electromagnetic radiation from mobile phones; and diseases. A shortage of nesting sites caused {{by changes in}} urban building design is probably a factor, and conservation organisations have encouraged the use of special nest boxes for sparrows. A primary cause of the decline {{seems to be an}} insufficient supply of insect food for nestling sparrows. Declines in insect populations result from an increase of monoculture crops, the heavy use of pesticides, the replacement of native plants in cities with introduced plants and parking areas, and possibly the introduction of unleaded petrol, which produces toxic compounds such as methyl <b>nitrite.</b>|$|E
5|$|In humans, sodium is an {{essential}} mineral that regulates blood volume, blood pressure, osmotic equilibrium and pH; the minimum physiological requirement for sodium is 500 milligrams per day. Sodium chloride is the principal source of sodium in the diet, and is used as seasoning and preservative in such commodities as pickled preserves and jerky; for Americans, most sodium chloride comes from processed foods. Other sources of sodium are its natural occurrence in food and such food additives as monosodium glutamate (MSG), sodium <b>nitrite,</b> sodium saccharin, baking soda (sodium bicarbonate), and sodium benzoate. The US Institute of Medicine set its Tolerable Upper Intake Level for sodium at 2.3grams per day, but the average person in the United States consumes 3.4grams per day. Studies have found that lowering sodium intake by 2g per day tends to lower systolic blood pressure by about two to four mmHg. It {{has been estimated that}} such a decrease in sodium intake would lead to between 9 and 17% fewer cases of hypertension.|$|E
5|$|The lake {{does not}} meet the National Water Quality Standards due to its high {{concentration}} of Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD). Considering the adverse impact on the lake water quality due to Eutrophication, anthropogenic pressures and holy rituals and tourism, a water quality study was specifically undertaken at four sites on a monthly basis for six months. The sampling sites were chosen to represent the pressure of pilgrims and other pollution inflows at the locations. The water samples were analysed for temperature, pH, salinity, conductivity, total dissolved solids, alkalinity, hardness, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, chloride, <b>nitrite,</b> nitrate, phosphate, sulphate, sodium, ammonium, potassium, total chlorophyll, biochemical oxygen demand and chemical oxygen demand. The analysis over the period has revealed that the lake water was alkaline, chloride and conductivity concentrations were high at all the four sites, and there were lower levels of dissolved oxygen (at sites with greater pollution load) and high hardness (on account of excess of calcium and magnesium from surface run-off). During the period of the annual Pushkar Fair, a distinct co-relationship was discerned between various parameters analysed and the degree of water pollution in the lake. This has called for urgent remedial actions to be undertaken by all of the government agencies involved with the lake management, with people's participation.|$|E

25|$|Ammonium and <b>nitrite</b> show {{a maximum}} {{concentration}} at 50–80 m (lower {{end of the}} euphotic zone) with decreasing concentration below that depth. This distribution can {{be accounted for by}} the fact that <b>nitrite</b> and ammonium are intermediate species. They are both rapidly produced and consumed through the water column. The amount of ammonium in the ocean is about 3 orders of magnitude less than nitrate. Between ammonium, <b>nitrite,</b> and nitrate, <b>nitrite</b> has the fastest turnover rate. It can be produced during nitrate assimilation, nitrification, and denitrification; however, it is immediately consumed again.|$|E
40|$|International audienceAbstract. The {{interaction}} of NO, and the further reactivity of oxygen, with water-passivated aluminum surfaces are investigated {{for the first}} time by in situ Polarization Modulation Infrared Reflexion Absorption Spectroscopy (PM-IRRAS) coupled with Quartz Crystal Microbalance (QCM). Chemical and quantitative complementary information are thus obtained. Exposure of water-passivated plane aluminum samples to NO/N 2 mainly results in the formation of <b>nitrites,</b> as identified by PM-IRRAS. O 2 hardly reacts with adsorbed <b>nitrites</b> in the absence of NO in the gaseous atmosphere. In contrast, the introduction of O 2 to a NO/N 2 mixture leads to the rapid transformation of <b>nitrites</b> to nitrates, both water-solvated and oxide-coordinated species. The fact that the transformation of <b>nitrites</b> to nitrates occurs only in the presence of NO and O 2 may suggest that <b>nitrites</b> react with gas phase NO 2 to form nitrates and NO. The evolution of the PM-IRRAS spectra of the Al surface with the composition of the gaseous phase is fully correlated to the mass uptake changes measured by QCM. From the PM-IRRAS and QCM measurements obtained during the same experiments, the ratio of the IR response coefficient of nitrates to that of <b>nitrites</b> (3. 4) is reported {{for the first time}}...|$|R
