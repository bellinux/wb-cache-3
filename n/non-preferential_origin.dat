40|$|This article {{discusses}} EU law {{and practice}} {{with regard to}} tackling circumvention of trade defence instruments, notably anti-dumping measures. The author considers that, while strong legal arguments {{can be made that}} anti-circumvention rules are WTO-illegal, as a practical matter transparent and predictable anti-circumvention rules are to be preferred over vague and multi-interpretable <b>non-preferential</b> <b>origin</b> rules that vary from country to country. Furthermore, the many findings of transhipment in EU anti-circumvention investigations show that circumvention may constitute a real problem which warrants quick and effective relief. Therefore, the article suggests that the way forward is to agree on detailed anti-circumvention rules within the WTO with focus on further improvements in transparency and predictability...|$|E

Volume 2 : AnnexesDefence date: 4 June 2013 The {{analysis}} of rationales for preferential {{rules of origin}} presented in the thesis brings forward the assumptions that, contrary {{to what has been}} written in the literature, it still seems legitimate to maintain preferential rules of origin as distinct from <b>non-preferential</b> rules of <b>origin.</b> However, multiplication of rules of origin regimes causes systemic problems and fairness concerns. The thesis aims therefore at analysing diversification and harmonisation patterns and their interaction with the systemic problems identified. The final objective of the thesis is to analyse the possible methods for regulating rules of origin in light of these systemic issues. The thesis employs an interdisciplinary approach in order to understand rationales for and systemic problems derived from preferential rules of origin. The methodology, adopted to understand patterns of diversification and harmonisation, combines instead comparative analysis and case study approach with the {{analysis of}} WCO and WTO law. While it is impossible to find a solution that could solve all the systemic problems (beside the complete abolition of the rules), this thesis argues that the first objective of the WTO should be to achieve a greater level of correspondence between rules of origin and MFN concessions and address fairness concerns. This should allow the enforcement of rules of origin in line with article XXIV GATT, while recognising the particular role of preferential rules of origin in guaranteeing that the partner only benefits from the preferential liberalisation. Contrary to the current literature, the thesis hints that this can be addressed effectively without resorting to international substantial harmonisation and without leaving regulation simply to partial regional harmonisation processes, which are respectively either politically difficult to achieve or ineffective means for properly addressing systemic issues related to rules of origin...|$|R
40|$|From neutral {{trade policy}} devices {{employed}} to identity {{country of origin}} of commodities, the rules of origin are emerging as protectionist tools. Nation-states, as they are increasingly denied of conventional trade policy tools, are reasserting themselves by evolving new and less visible weapons of intervention. The misuse of rules of origin as protectionist tools is widely reported from PTAs among developed countries, such as EEC and NAFTA. More recently, <b>non-preferential</b> rules of <b>origin</b> are also being used for protectionist purpose. It is such protectionist adaptation {{of the rules of}} origin that prompted the WTO to launch the HWP to evolve common rules of origin for all countries. The present study is a critique of the harmonization work programme. The central objective of the ARO and also the HWP is to ensure that the rules of origin are employed without/ or with least trade distorting effects. But, as our study shows, it would be too optimistic to expect such an outcome from the HWP. On the contrary, even if it is successfully completed, the HWP is likely to leave considerable scope for misuse of rules of origin for protectionist purpose. Further, the new multilateral regime, even if it succeeds in establishing semblance of an order in the arena of rules of origin, is likely to have unequal effects on members. The moot question is as to whether the adopted harmonised rules match the trading interests of the developing nations. The picture emerging from our analysis of outstanding disputes is not very encouraging for the developing countries. They belong mainly to the traditional areas of western protectionism against developing countries. The fear that the developed countries are trying to manipulate rules of origin to compensate for the loss of tariff and other conventional barriers, therefore, cannot be ruled out.

40|$|Rules {{of origin}} {{mechanism}} {{used to determine}} the origin of a product. Rules of origin serve many purposes such as collecting data on trade flows, implementing preferential tariff treatment, and applying anti-dumping duties. Rules of origin can be divided into preferential and non-preferential rules. Preferential rules of origin are used to determine whether a product originates in a preference-receiving country or trading area and hence qualifies to enter the importing country on better terms than products {{from the rest of the}} world. <b>Non-preferential</b> rules of <b>origin</b> are used for all other purposes, including enforcement of product- and country-specific trade restrictions that increase the cost of, or restrict or prevent, market entry. Preferential rules of <b>origin</b> differ from <b>non-preferential</b> ones because they are designed to minimize trade deflection. With rapid increase of bilateral and regional trade agreements, the role of rules of origin has become more evident. In the context of bilateral and regional trade agreements, rules of origin prevent free-riders from enjoying the benefits negotiated between the countries concerned. In other words, once the origin of a product is known, a country can extend the benefit of its free trade agreement to its trading partners thus excluding non-partners. In principle, rules of origin are supposed to be straightforward and easy-to-follow methods used to determine origin especially when a product is manufactured in one country, which rarely happens in reality. However, more than often, rules of origin are complex and protectionist method used a barrier to trade. As another case study, the purpose of this article is to examine rules of origin in the U. S. -Arab countries free trade agreements (FTAs). The article begins with a brief discussion of the concept of free trade, its evolution through the GATT and then the WTO, and the recently concluded FTAs between the U. S. and Arab countries. Then, in section three, the article analyzes in details rules of origin in the U. S. -Arab countries FTAs. The analysis includes, among other things, substantial transformation and value-added tests, product specific processes, and other relevant rules of origin. Sections four and five address the documentations and procedures required to prove origin and the costs involved in this process. Finally, the article provides a set of conclusions...|$|R
40|$|Excerpt] Determining {{the country}} of origin of a product is {{important}} for properly assessing tariffs, enforcing trade remedies (such as anti-dumping and countervailing duties) or quantitative restrictions (tariff quotas), and statistical purposes. Other commercial trade policies are also linked with origin determinations, such as country of origin labeling and government procurement regulations. Rules of origin (ROO), used to determine {{the country of}} origin of merchandise entering the U. S. market, can be very simple, noncontroversial tools of international trade as long as all of the parts of a product are manufactured and assembled primarily in one country. However, when a finished product’s component parts originate in many countries, {{as is often the case}} in today’s global trading environment, determining origin can be a very complex, sometimes subjective, and time-consuming process. U. S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is the agency responsible for determining country of origin using various ROO schemes. <b>Non-preferential</b> rules of <b>origin</b> are {{used to determine the}} origin of goods imported from countries with which the United States has most-favored-nation (MFN) status. They are the principal regulatory tools for accurate assessment of tariffs on imports, addressing country of origin labeling issues, qualifying goods for government procurement, and enforcing trade remedy actions and trade sanctions. Preferential rules are used to determine the eligibility of imported goods from certain U. S. free trade agreement (FTA) partners and certain developing country beneficiaries to receive duty-free or reduced tariff benefits under bilateral or regional FTAs, trade preference programs (such as the Generalized System of Preferences), and other special import programs. Preferential rules of origin are specific to each FTA, which means that they vary from agreement to agreement and preference to preference. This report deals with ROO in three parts. First, we describe in more detail the reasons that country of origin rules are important and briefly describe U. S. laws and methods that provide direction in making these determinations. Second, we discuss briefly some of the more controversial issues involving rules of origin, including the apparently subjective nature of some CBP origin determinations, and the effects of the global manufacturing process on ROO. Third, we conclude with some alternatives and options that Congress could consider that might assist in simplifying the process. This report will be updated as events warrant...|$|R
