40|$|<b>Non-profit</b> <b>organizations</b> are {{increasingly}} gaining {{importance in the}} modern economy with their development and their numbers increasing day by day. It {{is very important to}} note that <b>non-profit</b> <b>organizations</b> are often subject to various benefits that the for-profit companies are not. Thus, for example, preferential tax status of <b>non-profit</b> <b>organizations</b> is manifested primarily in the form of exemption from corporate income tax. In addition, private <b>non-profit</b> <b>organizations</b> enjoy various other state, local and federal taxes exemptions. Under certain conditions, these organizations are exempt from taxes on donations and membership fees. A feature that differentiates various <b>non-profit</b> <b>organizations</b> and profit-oriented companies is their source of income. Profit oriented companies depend on their income, obtained from sales of their goods or services to customers, who usually cover the price and cost of goods and services plus the profit. In contrast, nonprofit organizations are very dependent on membership fees, tax exemptions, members donations or depend on funds of the sponsoring agency which covers most of their costs, for example a federal government agency. Those <b>non-profit</b> <b>organizations</b> that have substantial operating costs beyond national borders and do not identify themselves as purely domestic in their mandate are International <b>non-profit</b> <b>organizations.</b> Most <b>non-profit</b> <b>organizations</b> remain in their national boundaries, on the territory of the country in which they were created, but a large number of <b>non-profit</b> <b>organizations</b> rapidly internationalize, and some larger non-profits have grown into important global actors. The paper includes the following sections: (1) introduction, (2) why is the 'non-profit' important, (3) the internationalization of <b>non-profit</b> <b>organizations,</b> (4) sources of income of <b>non-profit</b> <b>organizations</b> (4. 1.) causality of impact and of strategic decisions in cases pertaining to universities, (5) the limits of strategic management impact on <b>non-profit</b> <b>organizations</b> (6) management trends in <b>non-profit</b> <b>organizations,</b> and (7) conclusion...|$|R
