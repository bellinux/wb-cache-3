5|$|Lalic {{thinks the}} {{strategies}} in which Black gives up the bishop pair (by exchanging its Bb4 for the Nd2) for nothing are a mistake. He does <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> strategy to retreat the Bb4 in d6 either, {{because they are}} too drawish. He recommends the strategy to retreat the bishop in c5, and maintain its position there {{with the help of}} the a7–a5 pawn advance.|$|E
5|$|Many critics did <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> film, {{comparing}} it unfavorably with the films of John Waters and criticizing the colorful production design. Although the lead actors were praised for their performances, {{some of the}} characters were described as stereotypical.|$|E

5|$|Around 1779 Priestley and Shelburne had a rupture, {{the precise}} reasons for which remain unclear. Shelburne blamed Priestley's health, while Priestley claimed Shelburne had no further use for him. Some contemporaries speculated that Priestley's {{outspokenness}} had hurt Shelburne's political career. Schofield {{argues that the}} most likely reason was Shelburne's recent marriage to Louisa Fitzpatrick—apparently, she did <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> Priestleys. Although Priestley considered moving to America, he eventually accepted Birmingham New Meeting's offer to be their minister.|$|E
5|$|Beginning as a supporter, Greeley {{soon became}} disillusioned with President Johnson, whose Reconstruction {{policies}} allowed the quick formation of state governments without provision for suffrage for the freedman. When Congress convened and gradually {{took control of}} Reconstruction, Greeley generally supported their actions, favoring universal male suffrage and, his anger against the Confederates having cooled, amnesty. While Greeley generally supported the Radical Republicans, he did <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> harshness of Thaddeus Stevens. Greeley ran for Congress in 1866, but lost badly, and for Senate in the legislative election held in early 1867, to be defeated by Roscoe Conkling.|$|E
5|$|Contrary {{to popular}} belief, great white sharks do not mistake humans for seals. Many bite {{incidents}} occur in waters with low visibility or other situations which impair the shark's senses. The species appears to <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> taste of humans, {{or at least}} finds the taste unfamiliar. Further research shows that they can tell in one bite {{whether or not the}} object is worth predating upon. Humans, for the most part, are too bony for their liking. They much prefer a fat, protein-rich seal.|$|E

Elijah suggests that the incident highlights the common comic trope whereby superheroes often have one weakness; he contends David's might be water. While surveying the stored wreckage of the train crash that he survived, David recalls the car accident that ended his athletics career, remembering that he was unharmed and ripped a door off the car {{in order to save}} Audrey. David used the accident as an excuse to quit football because Audrey did <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> violence of the sport.|$|E
5|$|Fan {{interest}} in women's wrestling sunk once {{again as the}} year closed, and Sing tired of working there. Moreover, Faye was frustrated with her gimmick. WWF management asked her not to perform the same power moves as the male wrestlers, so instead, Faye was forced to act as comic relief. After a year with the company, Sing asked for a release from her contract. She briefly returned to Japan, but did <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> new system, which did not guarantee payouts.|$|E

5|$|In 1669, Anna Maria Luisa was {{considered}} as a potential bride to Louis, le Grand Dauphin, the heir-apparent of Louis XIV of France. Cosimo III did <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> idea of a French marriage, and never devoted himself fully to the cause (she was later rejected). Instead, Cosimo offered her to his first choice, Peter II of Portugal. Peter's ministers, fearing that Princess Anna Maria Luisa would dominate Peter II and fearing she might have inherited Marguerite Louise’s manner, declined. In fact, contemporaries thought her traits to {{be a combination of}} those of her father and paternal grandmother, Vittoria della Rovere.|$|E
5|$|In 1973, mendelevium(I) was {{reported}} to have been produced by Russian scientists, who obtained it by reducing higher oxidation states of mendelevium with samarium(II). It was found to be stable in neutral water–ethanol solution and be homologous to caesium(I). However, later experiments found no evidence for mendelevium(I) and found that mendelevium behaved like divalent elements when reduced, <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> monovalent alkali metals. Nevertheless, the Russian team conducted further studies on the thermodynamics of cocrystallizing mendelevium with alkali metal chlorides, and concluded that mendelevium(I) had formed and could form mixed crystals with divalent elements, thus cocrystallizing with them. The status of the +1 oxidation state is still tentative.|$|E

Their child, who grows 21-years-old in three weeks, becomes the resurrected Superman and saves the world. Warner Bros. did <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> script because of the similar underlying themes with Bruce Wayne's obligations of heroism found in Batman Forever.|$|E
5|$|O'Donoghue complained {{directly}} to Belushi {{that he thought}} his parody of Shatner during the dress rehearsals was inadequate and needed much improvement. Further, actor Chevy Chase was annoyed that he was satirizing Leonard Nimoy as Spock; he did <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> idea of playing second-fiddle to Belushi. During all of the rehearsals, Chase attempted to attract more attention to his character's role and dominate the scene. Just prior to the actual on-air performance of the sketch, O'Donoghue admonished Belushi and implored him to perform an effective parody. Belushi's dress rehearsal performance had worried executives {{so much that they}} had discussed canceling the entire sketch altogether.|$|E
5|$|Silver City Airways {{moved to}} Lympne in 1948, {{operating}} Bristol Freighter Mk.21 aircraft and an aerial car ferry to Le Touquet started on 13 July 1948. The air ferry {{was the idea}} of Griffith J Powell, who wanted to holiday in France but did <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> ferry. Bristol lent an aircraft for an experiment on 7 July 1948. The first car was Powell's Armstrong Siddeley 16 which was carried by G-AGVC.The Bristol Freighter Mk.21 could carry two cars. Although only 170 cars were carried in 1948, experience was gained.|$|E

5|$|Studio {{executives}} did <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> {{film and}} restructured Fincher's intended marketing campaign {{to try to}} reduce anticipated losses. Fight Club {{failed to meet the}} studio's expectations at the box office and initially received polarizing reactions from critics, becoming {{one of the most controversial}} and talked-about films of the year. Critics praised the acting, directing, themes and messages but debated the explicit violence and moral ambiguity. Over time, however, reception towards the film has become largely positive with critics and audiences, finding critical and commercial success with its DVD release, which established Fight Club as a cult film. It is now regarded by many as one of the greatest films of the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|The Free City of Danzig made Hitler {{an honorary}} {{citizen of the}} city as a {{birthday}} gift. Hitler received the citizenship papers from the hands of Albert Forster, the city's Nazi leader. Political and military tension between Germany and Poland was heightened at the time, and Time Magazine reported the possibility of Danzig being returned to Germany. Martin Bormann, Hitler's private secretary, had the Eagle's Nest constructed as the Nazi Party's birthday gift. Hitler, however, did <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> location, as he had a fear of heights. Because of his indigestion, Hitler did not drink alcohol, so a Munich brewery created a special batch of low alcohol beer for his birthday. The brew became a regular order.|$|E
5|$|The PJ held primary {{elections}} for the 1989 presidential elections between Carlos Menem, governor of La Rioja, and Antonio Cafiero, governor of the Buenos Aires Province.

Duhalde did <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>the</b> legislative work, and preferred {{to work with the}} actual administration of a district. Menem suggested that he run for governor of the populous Buenos Aires Province, which Duhalde accepted on the condition of a great budget aid to the province. This proposal was supported in Congress by Alfonsín, which led to a steady alliance between both politicians. Duhalde was elected governor, ending the political influence of Cafiero.|$|E
