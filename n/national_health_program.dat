2500|$|According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the United States {{spent more}} {{on health care}} per capita ($7,146), and more on health care as {{percentage}} of its GDP (15.2%), than any other nation in 2008. In 2010, 49.9 million residents or 16.3% of the population reported not carrying health insurance to the U.S. Census. Of that number 18.3 million had annual household incomes at or greater than $50,000, 9.5 million had household incomes of $75,000 or higher, 16.2 million had household incomes of less than $25,000, 27.2 million were under age 35, and 9.7 million were non-citizens. The Census has stated that its surveys likely underreport insurance coverage. For example, a quality control analysis revealed that 16.9% of those enrolled in Medicaid incorrectly reported being uninsured. [...] Analyses have also shown that millions of uninsured are eligible for coverage through programs like Medicaid but have not signed up or have let their enrollments expire. According to Physicians for a <b>National</b> <b>Health</b> <b>Program,</b> this lack of insurance causes roughly 48,000 unnecessary deaths per year. The group's methodology has been criticized by John C. Goodman for not looking at cause of death or tracking insurance status changes over time, including the time of death. A 2009 study by former Clinton policy adviser Richard Kronick found no increased mortality from being uninsured after certain risk factors were controlled for.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to accomplish a systematic review about the evaluation of the effectiveness of <b>health</b> <b>programs,</b> with emphasis to the effectiveness indicators used to the <b>health</b> evaluation <b>programs.</b> The review was conducted by electronic search of publications in the bibliographic databases LILACS and PubMed/MEDLINE. In the first database the key words used were "avaliação de programas", "avaliação de programas e projetos de saúde", "qualidade da assistência a saúde, acesso e avaliação”, "avaliação de eficácia-efetividade de intervenções" and "efetividade". At PubMed/MEDLINE database the following ones were used: “Program Evaluation ", " Quality Assurance, Health Care " and " <b>National</b> <b>Health</b> <b>Programs</b> ". Ten publications were both selected and analyzed in the items: <b>health</b> <b>program</b> evaluation and pathology, study design, population and sample, source of the data, collected data, indicators of effectiveness used, outcomes, estimators used and main results of the studies. Of the effectiveness indicators used in the studies, three of them established the goals which should be reached by programs. One of the study points out the procedures and the education performed actions; two studies highlighted coverage indicators, the access and the program actions carried out. With respect to the effectiveness evaluation of the <b>national</b> <b>health</b> <b>programs,</b> five of ten publications concluded that the <b>health</b> <b>program</b> was effective, according to the indicator of effectiveness used. In the other publications the results pointed out some aspects that demonstrate the program was ineffective, showing quality problems of the interventions. The accomplishment of studies using systematic review as tool may to contribute in a significant way to an analysis of the effectiveness. Also, it can become possible the analysis about how are the <b>national</b> <b>health</b> <b>programs</b> being evaluated. ...|$|R
