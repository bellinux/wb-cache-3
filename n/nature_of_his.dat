5|$|Davies {{also notes}} two flaws in Rhys's achievement. One was the {{personal}} <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> accord with Henry II, {{which meant that}} it did not survive Henry's death.

Allemand questioned Cotes intently about the <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> recent combat and, on identifying Uranie as one of his own squadron, commented that Tartu should have defeated Thames in half the time the action had taken.|$|E

5|$|Although Innis remains {{appreciated}} {{and respected}} {{for the grand}} and unique <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> later efforts regarding communications theories, he was not without critics. Particularly, the fragmentary and mosaic writing style exemplified in Empire and Communications has been criticized as ambiguous, aggressively non-linear, and lacking connections between levels of analysis. Biographers have suggested that this style {{may have been a}} result of Innis' illness late in his career.|$|E
5|$|At this point, the Greeks of Laconia and Arcadia, {{under the}} {{leadership}} of a certain Michael, tried to stop the Franks at the olive grove of Kountouras in northeastern Messenia. Modern scholars have traditionally identified this Michael with Michael I Komnenos Doukas, founder of the Despotate of Epirus, but this identification has been questioned more recently by Raymond-Joseph Loenertz, as the fragile <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> control over Epirus would have made a departure to aid the Moreote Greeks a major and unlikely gamble.|$|E
5|$|Beonna (also {{known as}} Beorna) was King of East Anglia from 749. He is notable {{for being the}} first East Anglian king whose coinage {{included}} both the ruler's name and his title. The end-date of Beonna's reign is not known, but may have been around 760. It is thought that he shared the kingdom with another ruler called Alberht and possibly with a third man, named Hun. Not all experts agree with these regnal dates, or the <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> kingship: {{it has been suggested}} that he may have ruled alone (and free of Mercian domination) from around 758.|$|E

5000|$|Zola's {{plan for}} the Rougon-Macquart novels was to show how {{heredity}} and environment worked on members of one family {{over the course of}} the Second Empire. All of the descendants of Adelaïde Fouque (Tante Dide), Saccard's grandmother, demonstrate what today would be called obsessive-compulsive behaviors to varying degrees. Saccard is obsessed with money and the building of wealth, to which everything in his life holds second place. In Le docteur Pascal, Zola describes the influence of heredity on Saccard as an [...] "adjection" [...] in which the <b>natures</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> avaricious parents are commingled.|$|R

The family moved to Ballarat in 1923, where he attended Ballarat High School {{for most of his}} secondary education, receiving his leaving (Year 11) certificate in 1926.

5000|$|Troncoso’s The <b>Nature</b> <b>of</b> Truth informs <b>his</b> mature works—From This Wicked Patch of Dust and Crossing Borders: Personal Essays—as they {{examine the}} ideas of borders, their permeability, and their dualistic <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> the real and the imagined. Without the {{intellectual}} questioning of truth in The <b>Nature</b> <b>of</b> Truth, <b>his</b> mature works, I believe, {{would not have been}} possible. Troncoso, primarily known for his US-Mexican Border works, is, as The <b>Nature</b> <b>of</b> Truth suggests, the brightest and most able of the modern Border writers and thinkers.

5|$|Over {{the years}} I {{have found that}} it is {{difficult}} if not impossible to bring to consciousness of another person the <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> tacit assumptions when, by some special experiences, I have been made aware of them. This became painfully evident to me in my attempts during the 1950s to convince geneticists that the action of genes had to be and was controlled. It is now equally painful to recognize the fixity of assumptions that many persons hold on the nature of controlling elements in maize and the manners of their operation. One must await the right time for conceptual change.|$|E
5|$|Thorpe's term as {{president}} {{was marked by}} the range of distinguished guest speakers that he recruited, among them Lord Hailsham, the jurist and former Liberal MP Norman Birkett, and the humorist Stephen Potter.

As a famous general, he was widely popular and regarded as the ideal Roman long after his death. To the Roman people, Germanicus was the Roman equivalent of Alexander the Great due to the <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> death at a young age, his virtuous character, his dashing physique, and his military renown.|$|E
