40|$|An {{efficient}} manufacturing {{solution for}} aircraft primary structures is the liquid resin injection/infusion (LRI) process with <b>non-crimp</b> <b>fabric</b> (NCF). Nevertheless, {{the main drawback of}} <b>non-crimp</b> <b>fabric</b> and liquid resin systems versus {{state of the}} art unidirectional prepreg tape (UDPT) is their poor tolerance to low velocity impact (compression strength after impact for the same indentation depth). The influence of the matrix properties (resin system and interlaminar toughening) on the impact tolerance of quasi-isotropic laminate manufactured with biaxial <b>non-crimp</b> <b>fabric</b> is studied. None of the liquid resin systems considered increased the impact tolerance of the NCF-Iaminate. The impact tolerance of UDPT could only be achieved by reducing the most critical impact failure mechanisms, delamination, thanks to an interlaminar toughening concept {{in the form of a}} veil positioned between each fibrous layer. The energy absorbed by the laminate during the impact could be qualitatively compared to an analytical estimation of the energy used for indentation and delamination. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{aerospace}} industry {{is committed to}} improving the performance of aircraft whilst reducing emissions and weight. Part of this goal can be achieved {{with the use of}} new types of composite materials, such as <b>non-crimp</b> <b>fabric</b> composites. These new composites, still under development, are made from dry fabrics and combine in theory the excellent in-plane behaviour of the unidirectional pre-impregnated tape composites with better out-of-plane behaviour and lower cost of the woven fabric composites. In practice, however, due to several parameters associated with the different stages of manufacturing of the <b>non-crimp</b> <b>fabric</b> laminates, some in-plane and out-of-plane waviness at the mesoscopic scale is introduced. This waviness (typically called crimp) is responsible for lowering the in-plane behaviour and causing specific failure models. A new method to efficiently model the fibre crimp of the tows in mesoscopic scale 3 D finite element models of <b>non-crimp</b> <b>fabric</b> laminates is presented in this study. This method consists of modelling the fibre crimp using straight meshes and “rotating” the mechanical properties according to the actual direction of the fibres. In order to ensure the validity of this method, it has been compared with previously developed methods in which the mesh is curved along the fibres direction. The new method allowed the creation of complex parametric 3 D FE models which in turn have been used to predict the apparent in-plane stiffness properties and to study the compressive behaviour and the in-plane shear behaviour of a <b>non-crimp</b> <b>fabric</b> laminate...|$|E

Experimental data for transverse loading out-of-plane in combination with in-plane loads are scarce. Therefore, to validate the developed criteria, experimental data are complemented with numerical data from a representative volume element model using a meso-micromechanical approach. The representative volume element model also provides a deeper understanding of how failure occurs in <b>non-crimp</b> <b>fabric</b> composites.

40|$|The {{deformation}} resistance and mechanisms of biaxial and triaxial <b>non-crimp</b> <b>fabrics</b> under bias extension loading is experimentally investigated. The bias {{deformation resistance}} of multiaxial <b>non-crimp</b> <b>fabrics</b> {{is found to}} be substantially lower than conventional single layer woven fabric due to the unique deformation mechanisms of rotation, sliding and compaction of the fibre tows. It is shown that the amount, line-tension and location of the warp-knitted stitches used to bind <b>non-crimp</b> <b>fabrics</b> have a major influence on the bias deformation resistance. It is found that lowering the amount and line-tension of the stitches facilities the tow sliding mechanism that reduces the deformation resistance of <b>non-crimp</b> <b>fabrics.</b> Fabric deformation is also affected by the location of the stitches, with stitches that pass between, rather than through, the tows reducing the resistance to bias deformation, again due to increasing ease of the tow sliding process.

40|$|Resin Transfer Moulding (RTM) {{has proven}} to be a cost {{effective}} production method for nearnet shaped products with a high accuracy and a high reproducibility. It makes RTM suitable for the manufacture of complex shaped products. The applicability of <b>non-crimp</b> <b>fabrics</b> (NCFs) in RTM offers both lower cost and improved through-thickness properties with no significant drop in in-plane properties compared to woven fabrics, due to better crimp and drapeability properties. Accurate flow simulations are an essential tool in finding the optimal process parameters, in particular for complex shaped structural components as applied in the aircraft industry. One of the most critical parameters in the mould filling simulations is the permeability of the fibre preform, which is in essence a geometric quantity. Geometrical changes, such as compaction and drape affect the permeability. This research aims to predict the permeability on a local level. The local permeability depends on the geometrical features of <b>non-crimp</b> <b>fabrics</b> and the influences of fabric deformation on these features.

40|$|Composite {{materials}} have become viable alternatives to traditional engineering materials for many different product categories. Liquid transfer moulding (LTM) processes, specifically resin transfer moulding (RTM), is a cost-effective manufacturing technique for creating {{high performance composite}} parts. These parts can be tailor-made to their specific application by optimizing {{the properties of the}} textile preform. Preforms which require little or no further assembly work and are close to the shape of the final part are critical to obtaining high quality parts while simultaneously reducing labour and costs associated with other composite manufacturing techniques. One type of fabric which is well suited for near-net- shape preforms is stitched <b>non-crimp</b> <b>fabrics.</b> These fabrics offer very high in-plane strength and stiffness while also having increased resistance to delamination. Manufacturing parts from these dry preforms typically involves long-scale fluid flow through both open channels and porous fibre bundles. This thesis documents and analyzes the flow of fluid through preforms manufactured from <b>non-crimp</b> <b>fabrics</b> featuring through-thickness stitches. The objective of this research is to determine the effect of this type of stitch on the RTM injection process. All of the tests used preforms with fibre volume fractions representative of primary and secondary structural parts. A series of trials was conducted using different fibre materials, flow rates, fibre volumes fractions, and degrees of fibre consolidation. All of the trials were conducted for cases similar to RTM.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{ultimate}} goal {{of this study is}} to develop a method that can provide an optimized initial blank shape and blank holding force (BHF) for sheet forming of complex composite parts. For that purpose the forming process for a double dome geometry is being studied using <b>non-crimp</b> <b>fabric</b> (NCF). The forming behaviour of the NCF is dependent on the blank shape which affects the propagation mode of shear resistance, and also the blank holding force that controls in-plane tension of the fabric. To investigate the effect of these factors on the formed shapes, finite element (FE) simulations are performed using a non-orthogonal constitutive equation that utilises fabric structural parameters and the shear response of the material. Since NCFs usually feature a preferred shear response according to shear direction, asymmetric shear is reflected in the FE simulation by using an exact linearization scheme of the shear response from picture-frame experiments. Based on the formed shapes due to several blank geometries and holding forces, an inversion problem, to determine optimized blank shape and blank holding force from final product shape and material properties, is proposed.
