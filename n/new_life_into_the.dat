25|$|In {{the middle}} of the 16th century, a group of rhetoricians (see Medieval Dutch literature) in Brabant and Flanders {{attempted}} to put <b>new</b> <b>life</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> stereotyped forms of the preceding age by introducing in original composition the new-found branches of Latin and Greek poetry. The leader of these men was Johan Baptista Houwaert, who was led by an unbounded love of classical and mythological fancy.|$|E

25|$|Many of Wan Chai's older {{buildings}} {{now face}} {{a serious problem}} of urban decay. To tackle the problem, the government has launched a series of urban renewal projects to bring <b>new</b> <b>life</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> area. Many local residents have relocation worries such as whether the Urban Renewal Authority can compensate enough {{to put them in}} a new space of equal size. Other concerns involve the loss of building character that make up part of that Hong Kong cultural identity.|$|E

International Record Review declared the recording a committed, persuasive and highly accomplished performance of an exceptional composing voice of our time, while BBC Music Magazine gave the disc a double five-star rating.|$|E
25|$|Mike Bateson {{took over}} as Torquay {{chairman}} in May 1990, taking over from Lew Pope. The beginning of the 1990–91 season saw Torquay off to a wonderful start – they were unbeaten for 14 games and were clear leaders in November but they faded dramatically, Bateson sacked Smith in April and appointed former United captain and then youth coach John Impey as manager. Impey proceeded to breathe <b>new</b> <b>life</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> team, guiding them to 7th place and the play-offs for a second time.|$|E

This includes up to 20 new buildings designed to complement the existing heritage landmarks and numerous community spaces as well as public amenities including an open piazza, forecourt areas and public open space including landscaped gardens as set out in the Pentridge Coburg Masterplan. Shayher Group also revealed its plans to invest several million dollars to restore the roof of A Division, the seven guard towers on site and the demolition of H Division's rock breaking yards.

25|$|In 2000 {{a strong}} economy, falling unemployment, {{and the impact}} of the Internet {{appeared}} to breathe <b>new</b> <b>life</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> “Swedish model” of a welfare society, one that had seemed dead and buried during the deep recession of the early 1990s: growth reached 4%, and unemployment fell to the lowest level in years. The Social Democrats, however, failed to capitalize on the economic boom. Opinion polls showed the party struggling to return to its post-election 36% approval level. Instead, the smaller Left Party, a Social Democrat ally, picked up support with its program of increased public spending and opposition to Swedish membership in the European single currency.|$|E
25|$|Robinson {{was inaugurated}} as the seventh President of Ireland on 3 December 1990. She proved a remarkably popular {{president}}, earning the praise of Brian Lenihan himself who, {{before his death}} five years later, {{said that she was}} a better president than he ever could have been. She took an office that had a reputation as being little more than a retirement position for prominent politicians and breathed <b>new</b> <b>life</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> role. Robinson brought to the presidency legal knowledge, deep intellect, and political experience. She reached out to the Irish diaspora (the large number of Irish emigrants and people of Irish descent). She also changed the face of Anglo-Irish relations, when she was the first serving Irish president to visit the United Kingdom and meet Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace. She welcomed visits by senior members of the British royal family, most notably the Prince of Wales, to her official residence, Áras an Uachtaráin.|$|E

50|$|By late March, Nixon's stock {{speeches to}} civic groups were {{becoming}} worn. Day hired political consultant Murray Chotiner for $580 {{for the primary}} campaign, and the consultant warned that unless <b>new</b> <b>life</b> came <b>into</b> <b>the</b> campaign, it was in serious danger. In the following years, Chotiner was to become Nixon's campaign manager, adviser, and friend in an association that lasted until Chotiner's death {{a few months before}} President Nixon's 1974 resignation.|$|R
25|$|Lynam relinquished {{his head}} {{coaching}} position to become general manager following the 1991–92 season, and hired Doug Moe {{to fill the}} vacancy. Moe's tenure lasted just 56 games, with the Sixers posting a 19–37 record. Popular former player and longtime assistant coach Fred Carter succeeded Moe as head coach in March 1993, but could only manage a 32–76 record at the helm. Following the 1993–94 season, the 76ers hired John Lucas in the dual role of head coach and general manager. The enthusiastic Lucas had been successful {{as a head coach}} for the San Antonio Spurs, and Philadelphia hoped he could breathe <b>new</b> <b>life</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> 76ers. It proved disastrous, as the team went 42–122 in its two seasons under Lucas. The acquisition of unproductive free agents such as Scott Williams and Charles Shackleford, players {{at the end of their}} careers such as LaSalle Thompson, Orlando Woolridge, and Scott Skiles along with stunningly unwise high draft picks such as Shawn Bradley and Sharone Wright were also factors in the team's decline. In fact, Wright would only play four seasons in the NBA while Temple product Eddie Jones—drafted 4 slots below Wright in 1994 by the L.A. Lakers—had 16 productive seasons as an NBA player.|$|E
25|$|The 2012–13 season saw a {{more stable}} squad than had been seen by Grimsby Town in recent years, {{with a total of}} 12 players from the {{previous}} season's squad remaining. The previous season's top scorer Liam Hearn suffered an Achilles tendon injury in pre-season, and although he appeared to be on the road to recovery when he came on as a substitute against Stockport County, just three days later he injured his leg in training, and tests showed it was an Achilles tendon rupture and he would be out for several months. However, despite the loss of such an important player, and despite not winning 5 games into the season, Grimsby were top of the table by Christmas, with two crucial loan players Ross Hannah and Scott Neilson breathing <b>new</b> <b>life</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Grimsby team. The turn of the year, however, appeared to be a turning point for Grimsby, with Nathan Pond returning from loan to Fleetwood Town and Scott Neilson signing for league rivals Luton Town. The team appeared to lack the quality they had shown {{towards the end of the}} previous year, and despite not losing until mid-February, a run of 4 consecutive losses in March saw them give up the top spot and ultimately fall away from the title race. Despite this, they reached the FA Trophy final, where they played Wrexham at Wembley Stadium on 24 March 2013. Grimsby went ahead in the second half with 20 minutes left to go, through an Andy Cook strike. However, they conceded a penalty with 9 minutes left and Wrexham equalised. This took the game to extra time, and then penalties, where Grimsby lost the shoot-out 4–1. Grimsby finished the season in good form, with a 9 match unbeaten run, finishing the season with a 3–0 win against Newport County. This led them to finish in 4th place with 83 points. They faced Newport County again straight away in the play-off semi-finals, where they were knocked out by a 1–0 loss in both legs. The managerial duo was broken up on 6 September 2013 due to Rob Scott being suspended and Paul Hurst was placed in sole charge of the team.|$|E

500|$|The New York Times critic, Charles McGrath, {{felt that}} Faulks [...] "improbably injects <b>new</b> <b>life</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> formula", {{which meant that}} Devil May Care was [...] "a {{stronger}} novel than any that Fleming wrote". Fritz Lanham, writing for the Houston Chronicle declared that [...] "so satisfying was Sebastian Faulks' new James Bond novel that I felt obliged to celebrate by making myself a vodka martini, very dry, shaken, not stirred." [...] Lanham considered that Faulks had [...] "produced a book true {{to the spirit of}} the originals", whilst also producing a novel that [...] "works as a thriller".|$|E
500|$|Inaba stated, [...] "We {{wanted to}} create a {{challenging}} game with stunning visuals and fluid gameplay". As a lifelong fan of superheroes, Inaba's aim was to combine traditional Japanese tokusatsu with American comic books. The character designs created by Kumiko Suekane were inspired specifically by 1960s and 1970s Japanese-costumed tokusatsu television shows such as Kamen Rider and Ultraman. Graphically, the game adopted a 2D side-scrolling style mixed with 3D cel-shaded animation. Despite many games in the then-modern industry shying away from 2D graphical formats, Inaba said, [...] "We have been able to breathe <b>new</b> <b>life</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> genre because we are using a new stylistic way that hasn't been seen before." [...] The team chose the GameCube as its platform because of their target audience and because it lent itself well to Viewtiful Joes gameplay.|$|E

500|$|The cast {{changes were}} met with mixed reviews. Mike Hale felt that the {{departure}} of Christopher Meloni {{was a relief to}} the show, as his [...] "tightly wound" [...] character had a [...] "wack-a-doodle intensity [...] had taken 'SVU' way off track", but still found it hard to imagine the show without him. He said that Meloni's absence turned the episode [...] "into the best showcase his partner, Olivia, had been given in years." [...] He called the addition of Michael Cutter was [...] "a big gain" [...] for the show, but felt uncertain about the addition of Detective Rollins, writing: [...] "A scene in which she tried to sweet-talk information out of a jailed suspect was the one really weak moment in the episode."

500|$|Reaction {{towards the}} re-worked version of [...] "On a Night Like This" [...] was {{positive}} amongst music critics. Scott Kara from the New Zealand Herald highlighted the track {{as one of}} the two standouts on the album, and praised its composition; he called it a [...] "sweeping and grand serenade". Similarly, Digital Spy's Robert Copsey selected the track {{as one of the}} better cuts and commended how the orchestral quality allowed to emphasise the lyrical content more than the original. Jeff Katz from the American music website Idolator was very positive, stating [...] "Many of the cuts—including 'On A Night Like This,' 'Finer Feelings' and 'Conﬁde In Me' — sound ready for placement in a Bond ﬁlm. Driving drums and suspenseful strings breathe <b>new</b> <b>life</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> old favorites." [...] Philip Matusavage from MusicOMH enjoyed the [...] "re-invented" [...] and [...] "advertous" [...] track, and selected it as a [...] "confident" [...] highlight from the album.

Love and Other Drugs." [...] Sandie Angulo Chen of Common Sense Media wrote that the characters' [...] "relationship is built on mutual respect and trust, something completely missing in many earlier Disney movies." [...] The Miami Heralds Rene Rodriquez opined, [...] "Even though they may seem to be boilerplate fairy-tale heroes, you genuinely come to care about Rapunzel and Flynn and root for them to be together," [...] while Joe Neumaier of the Daily News simply called their relationship [...] "cute". Ted Fry of The Seattle Times wrote, [...] "The back-and-forth banter of what inevitably becomes a courtship is consistently witty and given extra sparkle from adroit characterizations by Moore and Levi." [...] Similarly, Cathy Jakicic, writing for the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, opined, [...] "Moore and Levi, meanwhile, breathe <b>new</b> <b>life</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> classic love-hate romance." [...] Colin Covert of the Star Tribune felt that both [...] "characters are equally strong and funny". Ann Hornaday of The Washington Post wrote that the characters' relationship makes the film [...] "engaging".
