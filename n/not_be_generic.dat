By computing the holographic stress tensor we show that the CFT dual of the black hole is a 2 + 1 -dimensional ball (i. e., a disk) of plasma at finite temperature, surrounded by vacuum. This confirms some earlier conjectures about plasma balls in AdS/CFT. We also estimate {{the value of the}} surface tension for the ball.

40|$|A {{congregation}} {{is not a}} business, and {{to manage}} it as such would be inappropriated. Although the church is primarily invis- ible and spiritual by nature, in this world it is functioning as an institution which must be managed efficiently and effectively to ensure that everything is done successfully and in good order. A {{major part of the}} responsibility to ensure order and effective- ness rests on the shoulders of the minister. The training of as- piring ministers in the Reformed Churches of South Africa does not involve specific training in managing and leading an organi- sation. This fact might leave them vulnerable, especially in the earlier stages of their careers.   Although some people are blessed with natural skills and ta- lents regarding management and leadership, it has been pro- ven that management skills required to manage an organisation successfully can be acquired by means of study and training.   An empirical study was performed to determine whether training in management could assist ministers in the execution of their calling. A questionnaire was sent to all the ministers of the Re- formed Churches of South Africa regarding the scope of circum- stances in a congregation which can be compared with other organisations, as well as the minister’s role in managing the situations.   The research concludes with a recommendation that considera- tion should be given to include a course on management in the training syllabus of aspiring ministers. Furthermore, it is sugges- ted that this course be developed specifically taking into ac- count the background and circumstances of the Reformed Churches of South Africa, and should <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>generic</b> like the course which is included for Baccalaureus Commercii or Mas- ters of Business Administration (MBA) students...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (MDF) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2014. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: The South African {{government}} {{continues to}} provide post-settlement support to emerging farmers, {{with the objective}} of improving productivity through targeted funding or conditional grants. The Comprehensive Agricultural Support Programme (CASP), which came into effect in 2004, provides funding targeted at supporting emerging farmers. CASP has six pillars, of which this study focused on one, which is capacity building and training. The study investigated the assessment of the impact of training on the projects’ beneficiaries who had benefited from the CASP pillar of training and capacity building in the Limpopo Province. The methodology applied was the difference-in-difference technique. Projects that benefited from funding were regarded as the treatment group and those that did not benefit from the programme were regarded as the control group. The justification for the research was that while the government had financed CASP through fiscal allocation since 2004, because CASP is a conditional grant, there was a need to review the programme, focusing on establishing whether the budget allocation had achieved its intended objectives during this time. The objectives of the study were to measure whether there had been an improvement in the beneficiaries’ income levels. It focused on the status of the projects prior to the beneficiaries receiving training and benefiting from capacity building, and what the status was after receiving training through the programme, with the key determinant being an increase in income levels. Not all funded projects had benefited from the particular pillar investigated here. The selection of the beneficiaries to be trained was based on a skills audit which treated the groups as homogeneous, which was found to be inappropriate because of the differences in the prior skills, education levels and the specific interests of individuals. The findings were that there was variation in the increase of income levels. There was a positive relationship between training and reported increase in income levels in some projects, and a negative relationship between training and income levels for other projects. It was interesting that income levels increased for projects that had benefited from the CASP pillar of training and capacity building when the projects were analysed as a group, but when projects were analysed individually, it was revealed that there was a marginal decrease in income levels. There should be a shift in policy. The focus on training and capacity building should be a priority and should occur prior to the projects receiving infrastructure support. The 10 % of the total CASP budget allocated for training and capacity building needs to be reviewed, taking into account that low skills levels continue to be the main reason why projects are not sustainable. There is also a need to review the impact of training. The type of training offered should <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>generic</b> for all projects, it should be differentiated to suit the both the people and the commodities concerned and should be more biased towards entrepreneurship, as this would enable emerging farmers to grow their business units and realise increased income levels...|$|E

40|$|Objective – To {{determine}} if university library users {{are aware of}} electronic books,and how and why electronic books are used. Design – Survey. Setting – University of Denver. Subjects – Two thousand sixty‐seven graduate and undergraduate students, faculty, and staff. Methods – In Spring 2005, the University of Denver faculty, and graduate and undergraduate students {{were invited to participate}} in a survey about awareness and use of electronic books. A link to the survey was also posted on the library’s home pageand on the university’s Web portal. The 19 ‐question survey consisted of 11 questions to get feedback about electronic books in general, five questions focused on netLibrary,and the remaining were demographic questions. Eligibility to win one of two university bookstore gift certificates provided incentive to complete the survey. Main results – Surveys were completed by 2, 067 respondents, including undergraduate students (30. 1 %), graduate students (39. 1 %),faculty (12. 5 %), and staff (11. 8 %). Results were reported by question, broken out by status (undergraduate students, graduate students, faculty) and/or by discipline (Business, Humanities, Nontraditional, Professional, Sciences, Social Sciences), and presented in tables or in the text. In general, most respondents (59. 1 %) were aware that the library provides access to electronic books. The library catalog and professors were the main ways respondents learned about electronic books. Approximately half (51. 3 %) indicated they had used an electronic book. Of those who indicated that they used electronic books (1, 061 respondents), most (72 %) had used electronic books more than once. The main reasons mentioned for choosing to use an electronic book included: no print version available, working from home makes getting to the library difficult, and searching text in an electronic book is easier. When asked about typical use of electronic books, most respondents indicated they read only apart of an electronic book; only 7. 1 % of 1, 148 respondents indicated they read the entire electronic book. In answer to a questiona bout choosing the print or electronic version of the same book, 60. 7 % responded that they would always or usually use print,and 21. 5 % indicated they would always or usually use electronic. The amount of material to read, the need to refer to the material at a later time, and the desire to annotate or highlight text are all factors that influence whether users read electronic books on a computer or PDA, or print out the material. U. S. government publications and netLibrary were the electronic resources used the most by survey participants. Conclusion – The results of this survey suggest the need to market availability of the library’s electronic books. Problems {{associated with the use of}} electronic books are related to reading large amounts of text on a computer screen, but a reported benefitis that searching text in an electronic book is easier. Responses to the survey suggest that the use of electronic resources may <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>generic,</b> but rather depends on the type of resource (content) being used. The author notes that this finding should lead to further investigation of which items will be preferred and used in which format...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Business Management)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2011. The {{church is}} not like any other {{institution}} or organisation in society. Although the church is primarily invisible and spiritual, it is a visible organisation in the world, and it spans across borders of nations, languages and countries. John Calvin strongly rejected {{the notion that the}} church is only a spiritual organisation of which the visible administrative side is downplayed. The fellowship of the church must not only be seen as a mystical relation with Jesus Christ. At the three-yearly synod of the GKSA, which was held in the year 2000, a report was tabled titled 'Preservation and Growth of the Church'. The report requested that all local congregations should develop and implement a congregational strategy that is applicable to their own unique environment. The congregational strategy's main purpose must be to guide the congregation to fulfil its biblical purpose. The fact that people are turning their backs on the traditional churches, including the GKSA who is losing about 2000 members per year, is an indication that it cannot be 'business as usual' for them in future. The {{purpose of this study is}} to design a framework for crafting and executing a congregational strategy for the local congregations of the GKSA. The study started with a literature study on the science of strategic management. This provided a theoretical foundation for the framework. Although the strategy of different organisations will differ vastly, the process to follow is much the same. The literature study indicated that the benefits of a well developed and executed organisational strategy are not limited to large profit making organisations, but is also useful to non-profit organisations such as government departments and church congregations. The literature study included a study on the essence and work of a congregation. The purpose of this part of the study was not to be a detailed theological study of the different views and types of church denominations, but only focused on the views of the GKSA. The literature study also tested the applicability of the strategic management theory on the nature and work of a congregation. An empirical study was performed in the congregations of the GKSA, which indicated that the majority of congregations do not have a congregational strategy. The main reason for not having a congregational strategy is that congregations do not have the knowledge and skills available to lead and facilitate the process of crafting and executing a congregational strategy. The empirical study also gathered best practices from congregations that are doing strategic management. These best practices were included in the proposed framework for crafting and executing a congregational strategy. The knowledge gained from the literature and empirical study was combined into a framework for crafting and executing a congregational strategy. This framework can be used by congregational leaders to guide them though their own process of crafting and executing their unique congregational strategy. The research concludes with a recommendation that the Theological School of the GKSA should consider including a course on strategic management in the training syllabus of aspiring ministers. The course should be developed specifically taking into account the background and circumstances of the GKSA, and should <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>generic</b> like the course that is included in the Baccalaureus Commercii curriculum. Because of the fast changing environment of the 21 st century, the course should also be condensed and be presented to ministers already called in congregations. Because strategic management is a specialised management science, and external Strategic Management consultants tend to be expensive, the research also made the recommendation that the Administrative Bureau of the GKSA consider employing their own Strategic Management consultant for the GKSA with the specific assignment to assist and guide all congregations with their congregational strategy.
