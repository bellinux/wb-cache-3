Past programming from Prime Television has been recognised nationally, with some local productions winning the Logie Award for 'Outstanding Contribution by a Regional Television Station'. The network has won Logies for Goin' Down The Road (CBN-8, 1979), Naturally (NEN-9/ECN-8, 1984), Stranded (Prime Television, 1993), Rest in Peace (Prime Television, 1994), and <b>No</b> <b>Time</b> <b>For</b> Frailty (Prime Television, 1996).|$|E
5|$|Competing at {{her first}} Summer Olympics, Aicha Fall {{qualified}} for the London Games as a wildcard, as she had set <b>no</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> her event, the 800 meters. She was {{to compete in the}} 2012 World Junior Championships in Athletics 800 meters but did not start the event. She competed on August 8 in Heat 5 against seven other athletes. She posted a time of 2 minutes and 27.97 seconds, finishing sixth and setting a national record in the process. She placed ahead of Palestine's Woroud Sawalha (2 minutes and 29.16 seconds) and behind Canada's Melissa Bishop (2 minutes and 09.33 seconds) in a heat led by Ukraine's Nataliia Lupu (2 minutes and 8.35 seconds). Overall, Fall was 24.12 seconds behind the slowest athlete that progressed to the semi-finals and therefore did not advance.|$|E
5|$|Roekiah {{was born}} in Bandoeng (now known as Bandung), West Java, Dutch East Indies, in 1917 to Mohammad Ali and Ningsih, actors with the Opera Poesi Indra Bangsawan troupe; Ali was {{originally}} from Belitung, while Ningsih was of Sundanese descent and came from Cianjur. Though Roekiah learned acting mainly from her parents, she also studied the craft {{with other members of}} their troupe. The trio were constantly travelling, leaving Roekiah with <b>no</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> a formal education. By the mid-1920s they were with another troupe, the Opera Rochani.|$|E

He plans to leave Cigading for the capital, Batavia (today Jakarta), where he will find work. Tati, upon learning this, joins him. She lives at her aunt's home in the city, making a living by washing clothes, while he finds lodging with a local man and learns to drive a becak (pedicab). Together they begin saving for their wedding. Unknown to them, Pardi has cut short his time in Cigading to move to Batavia, both to begin his new job and to find Tati.|$|E
5|$|The HV 102nd Infantry Brigade {{arrived at}} the Sisak OG AOR on 11 December 1992, and was ordered to {{undertake}} the offensive on the same evening, at about 20:00, leaving <b>no</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> any preparation or reconnaissance. A reconnaissancesabotage detachment of the HV Glina Battalion and the special police force were ferried across the Kupa River {{on the night of}} 11/12 December, capturing the village of Stankovac and preparing to support the 102nd Infantry Brigade at the river crossing. The 36th Engineering-Pontoon Battalion completed a crossing point in the village of Šišinec by 4:00 and the lead elements of the 102nd Infantry Brigade crossed the Kupa River a half-hour later.|$|E
5|$|The novel {{begins as}} Sukartono (Tono), a Dutch-trained doctor, {{and his wife}} Sumartini (Tini), {{residents}} of Batavia (modern day Jakarta), are suffering a marital breakdown. Tono is busy treating his patients, leaving <b>no</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> him to be with Tini. In response, Tini has become active in numerous social organisations and women's groups, leaving her little {{time to deal with}} household work. This further distances Tono from her, as he expects her to behave like a traditional wife and be waiting for him at home, with dinner ready, when he returns from work.|$|E

5|$|When the Corregidor {{entered the}} minefield, {{there was a}} large {{explosion}} on the starboard side of the vessel. The overcrowded ship quickly began to sink, with many people trapped below-deck. Survivors stated that the ship sank so quickly that there was <b>no</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> large-scale panic to set in. Searchlights from Corregidor Island illuminated the scene which aided the rescue effort. Sailors of MTB Squadron 3 posted at Sisiman Cove heard the explosion and left on three PT boats (PT-32, PT-34 and PT-35) to investigate. When the boats arrived they found survivors in the water and were able to retrieve 282 survivors. Seven of the rescued passengers later died from their injuries.|$|E
5|$|Hill faced further {{problems}} as he {{planned for the}} operation. The American pilots of the Dakota transport aircraft that would transport the battalion were inexperienced and had never conducted a parachute drop before, and there was <b>no</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> any training or exercises. There were also no photos of the airfield or the surrounding areas, and only a single, smallscale map available for navigation. To ensure that the aircraft found the dropzone and delivered the battalion accurately, Hill sat in the cockpit of the leading Dakota and assisted the pilot. The Dakotas were escorted by four American P-38 Lightning fighters, which engaged and drove off two roving German fighters, but as the Dakotas approached the Tunisian border they encountered thick clouds and were forced to turn back, landing at Maison Blanche at 11:00. It was decided that the battalion would conduct the operation the next day, which allowed the paratroopers to rest for a night. 1st Parachute Battalion took off {{on the morning of}} 16 November, and enjoyed excellent weather that allowed the transport aircraft to drop the battalion accurately around the airfield at Souk elArba. Most of the paratroopers landed successfully, but one man was killed when his rigging line twisted around his neck middrop, throttling him; one officer broke his leg on landing, and four men were wounded when a Sten gun was accidentally fired. The battalion's secondincommand, Major Alastair Pearson, remained at the airfield with a small detachment that collected the airborne equipment and supervised the burial of the casualty.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the four nationwide tours {{and all the other}} concerts, what little time remained was taken up with TV shows, press interviews, and recording sessions for the singles and albums released that year. The Beatles also had a weekly radio show. The music papers were full of stories about the Beatles, and magazines for teenage girls regularly contained interviews with the band members, colour posters and other Beatle-related articles. The intense public interest in the Beatles, coupled with Epstein's demanding schedule, ensured that they had <b>no</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> family matters. Lennon's August 1962 marriage to Cynthia Powell was kept from public view as a closely guarded secret. When Lennon's son Julian was born on 8 April 1963, Lennon, visiting the hospital to see his wife and meet his new son for the first time, attempted to disguise himself to prevent people in the hospital from recognising him. Lennon's attempt to keep the secret was not successful as other patients could see it was him. After the hospital visit, Epstein's schedule prevailed once more.|$|E
5|$|Seeing {{that the}} {{artillery}} would not break the Polish, General von Toll devised {{a new plan}} of attack. He decided to disregard Paskevich's order not to assault Warsaw. Although dusk was nearing, von Toll ordered an all-out assault on both the western and southern fronts. As there was <b>no</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> proper artillery preparation, von Toll wanted to overwhelm the defenders by sheer numerical superiority, {{even if it meant}} increased casualties from Polish artillery. To distract the Polish artillery at Czyste and prevent it from firing at the Russian columns attacking Forts 21 and 22, Muraviev's forces were to lead the attack directly towards the Jerozolimskie Gate. Before 15:00, von Toll dispatched General Neidhardt to Paskevich to receive his blessing for the new plan, but Paskevich categorically refused, and ordered his subordinate to continue shelling the Polish forts with artillery at least until 16:00. As the Russian commander-in-chief was away, von Toll decided to act despite Paskevich's orders.|$|E
5|$|That night, Castelli and Saavedra {{informed}} Cisneros {{of their}} resignation from {{the newly formed}} Junta. They explained that the population {{was on the verge}} of violent revolution and would remove Cisneros by force if he did not resign as well. They warned that they did not have the power to stop that: neither Castelli to stop his friends, nor Saavedra to prevent the Regiment of Patricians from mutiny. Cisneros wanted to wait for the following day, but they said that there was <b>no</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> further delays, so he finally agreed to resign. He sent a resignation letter to the Cabildo for consideration on the following day. Chiclana felt encouraged when Saavedra resigned, and started to request signatures for a manifesto about the will of the people. Moreno refused any further involvement, but Castelli and Peña trusted that he would eventually join them if events unfolded as they expected.|$|E

5|$|The {{release of}} Street Fighter II in 1991 is {{considered}} a revolutionary moment in the fighting game genre. Yoshiki Okamoto's team developed the most accurate joystick and button scanning routine in the genre thus far. This allowed players to reliably execute multi-button special moves, which had previously required an element of luck. The graphics took advantage of Capcom's CPS arcade chipset, with highly detailed characters and stages. Whereas previous games allowed players to combat a variety of computer-controlled fighters, Street Fighter II allowed players to play against each other. The popularity of Street Fighter II surprised the gaming industry, as arcade owners bought more machines {{to keep up with}} demand. Street Fighter II was also responsible for popularizing the combo mechanic, which came about when skilled players learned that they could combine several attacks that left <b>no</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> the opponent to recover if they timed them correctly.|$|E

Despite the battalion's parachutes only arriving at 16:30 on 14 November, and were packed twelve to a container which meant they had to be removed and individually repacked, the battalion was prepared by 15 November and took off at 07:30. The Dakotas were escorted by four American P-38 Lightning fighters, which engaged and drove off two roving German fighters, but as the Dakotas approached the Tunisian border, they encountered thick clouds and were forced to turn back, landing at Maison Blanche at 11:00. It was decided that the battalion would conduct the operation the next day, which allowed the paratroopers to rest for a night. At the same time, 2nd Battalion of the 509th PIR successfully conducted a drop at Tebessa, capturing its objectives and securing the area; it then passed from the control of 1st Parachute Brigade and remained in the area for some time. 1st Parachute Battalion took off on the morning of 16 November, and encountered excellent weather which allowed the transport aircraft to drop the battalion accurately around the airfield at Souk elArba. Most of the paratroopers landed successfully, but one man was killed when his rigging line twisted around his neck middrop, throttling him; one officer broke his leg on landing, and four men were wounded when a Sten gun was accidentally fired.
