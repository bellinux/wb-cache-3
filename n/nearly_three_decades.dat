5|$|It was {{not until}} 1840, that the Salukis were first brought to England. Referred to as Slughis, they and the modern Sloughi were treated as the same breed; however, recent genetic tests {{have shown that the}} two breeds are genetically separate. The first {{successful}} modern breeding line of Salukis began in 1895, with Florence Amherst (daughter of the 1st Baron Amherst of Hackney). Having seen Salukis on a Nile tour in that year, she imported a breeding pair from the Al Salihah area of Lower Egypt.

5|$|Construction of Route 25 east of Wareham, however, {{was delayed}} for <b>nearly</b> <b>three</b> <b>decades</b> to {{property}} disputes, environmental concerns and resistance from business owners in Buzzards Bay village, who claimed the freeway would divert all the traffic, and their business, elsewhere, leaving {{a ghost town}} in its wake. The proposed alignment ran through land {{where much of the}} state's cranberry harvest was located, and this led to lengthy lawsuits and delays. In particular, farmers were concerned that salt runoff from winter ice removal would harm cranberry harvests. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, the MassDPW developed several proposals to control storm water runoff and avoid potential damage to the cranberry crops. Engineers for the department developed four different drainage systems to be used {{along the length of the}} freeway that would divert runoff away from the Wareham River basin. In addition, the freeway was planned with a thicker asphalt pavement that was largely impervious to water.|$|E
5|$|Due {{partly to}} their ready {{availability}} and {{the ease with}} which they may be grown in the laboratory, C.micaceus and other coprinoid mushrooms were common subjects in cytological studies of the 19th and 20th centuries. The German botanist Johann Heinrich Friedrich Link reported his observations {{of the structure of the}} hymenium (the fertile spore-bearing surface) in 1809, but misinterpreted what he had seen. Link thought that microscopic structures known today as basidia were thecae, comparable in form to the asci of the Ascomycetes, and that each theca contained four series of spores. His inaccurate drawings of the hymenium of C.micaceus were copied in subsequent mycological publications by other authors, and it was not until microscopy had advanced that mycologists were able to determine the true nature of the basidia, when <b>nearly</b> <b>three</b> <b>decades</b> later in 1837 Joseph-Henri Léveillé and August Corda independently published correct descriptions of the structure of the hymenium. In 1924, A. H. Reginald Buller published a comprehensive description and analysis of the processes of spore production and release in the third volume of his Researches on Fungi.|$|E

But, they have been unable to convince the public that prevention is possible and to motivate positive behavior change, at either the individual or societal levels, in support of prevention. In early 2003, PCA America began to explore the concept of "strategic reframing" of the issue of {{child abuse and neglect}} prevention. The goal was to identify a more effective strategy for communicating about, and advocating on behalf of, child abuse and neglect prevention, based on a thorough understanding of the public's frame of reference on the issue...|$|R

The Acts of 1939 and 1946 established floor prices for silver of 71 cents and 90.5 cents (respectively) per ounce. Predicated by an anticipated shortage of silver bullion, Public Law 88-36 (PL88-36) was enacted on 4 June 1963 which repealed the Silver Purchase Act of 1934, and the Acts of 6 July 1939 and 31 July 1946, while providing specific instruction regarding the disposition of silver held as reserves against issued certificates and the price at which silver may be sold. It also amended the Federal Reserve Act to authorize the issue of lower denomination notes (i.e., $1 and $2), allowing for the gradual retirement (or swapping out process) of $1 silver certificates and releasing silver bullion from reserve. In repealing the earlier laws, PL88-36 also repealed {{the authority of the}} Secretary of the Treasury to control the issue of silver certificates. By issuing Executive Order 11110, President John F. Kennedy was able to continue the Secretary’s authority. While retaining their status as legal tender, the silver certificate had effectively been retired from use.|$|E

40|$|What {{is known}} as "Hilbert's hotel" {{is a story of}} an {{imaginary}} hotel with infinitely many rooms that illustrates the bizarre consequences of assuming an actual infinity of objects or events. Since the 1970 s it has been used in a variety of arguments, some of them relating to cosmology and others to philosophy and theology. For a long time it has remained unknown whether David Hilbert actually proposed the thought experiment named after him, or whether it was merely a piece of mathematical folklore. It turns out that Hilbert introduced his hotel in a lecture of January 1924, but without publishing it. The counter-intuitive hotel only became better known in 1947, when George Gamow described it in a book, and it took <b>nearly</b> <b>three</b> more <b>decades</b> until it attracted wide interest in scientific, philosophical, and theological contexts.

40|$|Abstract. With market-oriented {{opening in}} the China's civil {{aviation}} industry and the rapid development of China's economy, China's civil aviation transportation fuel consumption has grown significantly in <b>nearly</b> past <b>three</b> <b>decades.</b> Therefore, it’s a very important strategic significance of the prediction of China's civil aviation transportation fuel consumption. In this paper, by using gray system and neural network approach, combined with China's civil aviation industry 1980 - 2010 total traffic volume of the data, we establish gray system GM (1, 1) model and BP neural network model for civil aviation transport volume. Training and simulation of the back propagation neutral network model and the gray system GM(1, 1) are used by MATLAB. BP neural network modeling takes into account three factors: the number of aircraft aviation industry, flight hours and total turnover. The fitting precision of the gray system GM(1, 1) model is 64. 2 % while the fitting precision of the back propagation neutral network model is 90. 16 %. Thus, the back propagation neutral network model is better for estimating civil aviation fuel consumption...|$|R

Satellite and airborne hyperspectral imaging {{has been the focus}} of research in remote sensing applications since <b>nearly</b> the past <b>three</b> <b>decades.</b> Recent use of ground-based hyperspectral imaging has found immense interest in areas such as medical imaging, art and archaeology, and computer vision. In this paper, we make an attempt to draw closer the forensic community and image analysis community towards automated forensic document examination. We believe that it has a huge potential to solve various challenging document image analysis problems, especially in the forensic document examination domain. We present the use of hyperspectral imaging for ink mismatch detection in handwritten notes as a sample application. Overall, this paper provides an overview of the applications of hyperspectral imaging with focus on solving pattern recognition problems.

40|$|Background: The {{incidence}} {{of breast cancer}} in Uganda has <b>nearly</b> tripled in <b>three</b> <b>decades,</b> the reasons not wholly understood. Country specific evidence is needed to better understand associated risk factors. Breast density is a strong predictor of breast cancer risk in Caucasian populations. The {{aim of this study}} was to establish whether increased breast density is a contributory risk factor for breast cancer amongst black African women. Methods: A case control study carried out at the National Referral and teaching Hospital, Mulago in Kampala Uganda over a 6 months period. All patients who presented for breast cancer screening and underwent a mammography breast examination during the study period had their breast densities measured using the BI-RADS classification were eligible. Those diagnosed with breast cancer during the period formed the cases and those who had a normal breast examination formed the controls. Mulago receives patients from all over the country but more so from the central part, owing to its location (proximity). Prevalence of high breast density between the two groups was compared using cross tabulations and an association between high breast density and breast cancer was defined.
