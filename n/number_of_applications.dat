5|$|Iridium's modulus of {{elasticity}} is {{the second-highest}} among the metals, only being surpassed by osmium. This, together with a high shear modulus and a very low figure for Poisson's ratio (the relationship of longitudinal to lateral strain), indicate {{the high degree of}} stiffness and resistance to deformation that have rendered its fabrication into useful components a matter of great difficulty. Despite these limitations and iridium's high cost, a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>applications</b> have developed where mechanical strength is an essential factor in some of the extremely severe conditions encountered in modern technology.|$|E
5|$|The {{first series}} {{was seen by}} an average of 7.49million, and {{received}} generally favourable reviews from critics, with some comparing the series to American espionage-based series such as 24.

As a result of the series, MI5's website saw a surge in a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>applications</b> to the organisation by viewers. Spooks was awarded a British Academy Television Awards (BAFTA) for Best Drama Series, and was nominated for two other BAFTAs and three Royal Television Society Awards.

GAO's review included the Coast Guard components. GAO compiled <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>applications</b> based on data provided by the Armed Forces. However, these numbers {{do not include the}} <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>applications</b> that are not formally reported to the components' headquarters.

30|$|Figure  7 {{shows that}} of all the {{industries}} construction has a significant contribution to the increase in labor cost over time. From our earlier analysis on the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> patent <b>applications</b> by industry (shown in Fig.  2), construction showed a less-than-average <b>number</b> <b>of</b> patent <b>applications</b> per 10, 000 inhabitants. It appears that there is a negative association between labor cost and <b>number</b> <b>of</b> patent <b>applications.</b> The higher the labor cost, the lower the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> patent <b>applications,</b> suggesting that countries should contain the cost of labor in order to stimulate innovation and growth.|$|R

5|$|Carbon fibre is {{actually}} a carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer, and is a strong, light-weight material used in a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>applications,</b> including sporting goods like baseball bats, car parts, helmets, sailboats, bicycles and other equipment where rigidity and high strength-to-weight ratio is important. The polymer used for this equipment is normally epoxy, but other polymers are also used, depending on the application, and other reinforcing fibres may also be included. In the blade manufacturing process, sheets of impregnated material are cut into square sheets and pressed onto a form to produce the final shape. From 30 to 90 sheets may be layered, depending on the expected weight of the athlete, and the mold is then autoclaved to fuse the sheets into a solid plate. This method reduces air bubbles that can cause breaks. Once the result is cooled, it is cut {{into the shape of}} the blades. The finished blade is bolted to a carbon fibre socket that is an intimate fit to each of Pistorius' legs. These are custom made and make up the bulk of the total cost, along with the assessment and setting up of the finished prostheses. Each limb costs between $15–18,000 USD.|$|E

40|$|In {{enterprise}} data warehouses, different {{users in}} different business units often define their own application specific dimension hierarchies tailor made to their reporting and business performance monitoring needs. Due to resource constraints, {{only on a}} small <b>number</b> <b>of</b> these hierarchies are precomputed for performance optimization. Consequently aggregations over hierarchies without precomputations are often less responsive. We report on a performance problem in a very large banking enterprise where the large <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>application</b> specific hierarchies became a performance bottleneck. This paper proposes a novel solution for optimizing the performance of data warehouses with a large <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>application</b> specific hierarchies. We exploit the observation that dimension hierarchies in real data warehouses often contain significant overlaps. Our method detects common sub-structures among hierarchies and provides a rewriting algorithm to exploit any precomputations on these shared sub-structures. Our solution is applicable to data warehouses of large enterprises with a large <b>number</b> <b>of</b> business units and hence a large <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>application</b> specific hierarchies. 1...|$|R
