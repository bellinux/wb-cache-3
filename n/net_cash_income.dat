40|$|The New Basel Capital Accord (Basel II) {{provides}} added {{emphasis to}} the development of portfolio credit risk models. An important regulatory change in Basel II is the differentiated treatment in measuring capital requirements for the corporate exposures and retail exposures. Basel II allows agricultural loans to be categorized and treated as the retail exposures. However, portfolio credit risk model for agricultural loans is still in their infancy. Most portfolio credit risk models being used have been developed for corporate exposures, and are not generally applicable to agricultural loan portfolio. The objective {{of this study is to}} develop a credit risk model for agricultural loan portfolios. The model developed in this study reflects characteristics of the agricultural sector, loans and borrowers and designed to be consistent with Basel II, including consideration given to forecasting accuracy and model applicability. This study conceptualizes a theory of loan default for farm borrowers. A theoretical model is developed based on the default theory with several assumptions to simplify the model. An annual default model is specified using FDIC state level data over the 1985 to 2003. Five state models covering Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, and Nebraska areestimated as a logistic function. Explanatory variables for the model are a three-year moving average of <b>net</b> <b>cash</b> <b>income</b> per acre from crops, <b>net</b> <b>cash</b> <b>income</b> per cwt from livestock, government payments per acre, the unemployment rate, and a trend. <b>Net</b> <b>cash</b> <b>income</b> generated by state reflects the five major commodities: corn, soybeans, wheat, fed cattle, and hogs. A simulation model is developed to generate the stochastic default rates by state over the 2004 to 2007 period, providing the probability of default and the loan loss distribution in a pro forma context that facilitates proactive decision making. The model also generates expected loan loss, VaR, and capital requirements. This study suggests two key conclusions helpful to future credit risk modeling efforts for agricultural loan portfolios: (1) <b>net</b> <b>cash</b> <b>income</b> is a significant leading indicator to default, and (2) the credit risk model should be segmented by commodity and geographical location...|$|E

Through the use of the Financial and Risk Management (FARM) Assistance database, this study evaluated economic measures for row-crop producers, livestock producers and diversified producers (farms which can not be classified as primarily crop or livestock). The sample population for this study was agricultural producers (N= 196) who had participated in the Texas Cooperative Extensions FARM Assistance program in the years 2002 to 2004. Financial performance was determined by several financial measures, such as <b>net</b> <b>cash</b> farm <b>income,</b> ending <b>cash</b> reserves, return on assets (ROA), equity growth and working capital. In addition, information gathered about the FARM Assistance clientele was used to examine the relationship between their demographic backgrounds and their financial success. SPSS was used to calculate frequencies, percentages, means, standard deviations, and administer one-way analysis of variance and independent sample t-test. The major findings of the study showed that the average age of the FARM Assistance participants was 51 years old. A large number of the participants (41. 90 %) in the FARM Assistance program had a Bachelor of Science degree.

However, land pressure is high and both income and food security are low. The {{aim of this study}} has been to assess the potential of various forage cultivation intensification strategies (‘scenarios’) to improve physical production and income of smallholder crop-dairy farmers in Lushoto district, Tanzania. Representative farms were created in the FarmDESIGN model with data from household surveys, feed analyses, milk measurements, soil samples and GPS measurements from 20 farms in Ubiri village. Two baseline farms were modeled, to account for the sample range in labor availability: 4 farm households were headed by a single (grand) parent; as such, available labor was about half the level of households with at least two members active on-farm full-time. The baseline farm without such labor-constraints (‘HL’ for ‘high labor’) owns two dairy cows, the baseline farm with limited labor (‘LL’) does not own cattle. A participatory scenario development workshop revealed the most promising intensification strategy: Napier cultivation on the plots close to the homesteads. Bio-economic performance under this scenario was modeled for each representative farm, the main management difference between HL and LL being that the latter does not collect natural grasses from public land in addition to Napier cultivation. The scenario shows potential for substantial improvement compared to the baseline: a tripling of milk production, a <b>net</b> <b>cash</b> <b>income</b> increase of 147 %, and no reduction in household food production on the representative farm without labor constraints. This scenario seems promising for both farms, but {{it should be noted that}} [1] the farms would become structurally reliant on mineral fertilizers and imported maize bran, and [2] the LL farm runs a negative carbon balance because it does not import natural grasses, thereby threatening long-term soil fertility.

40|$|Contract farming (CF) is an {{institutional}} arrangement by which agribusinesses replace or supplement {{primary agricultural production}} with supply from smallholders. In developing countries where farms are typically small and resource poor, questions have been asked about its impact on smallholders, particularly the poorest. This study examined these aspects of a Contract Farming Arrangement (CFA) between a chickpea processing firm and a farmers’ cooperative union in central Ethiopia. A random sample of 95 growers was drawn {{from a list of}} CF participants. In addition, a representative sample of 114 households was drawn from seven counties where the CFA was active. A subset of non-participating households with characteristics similar to those of participants was identified as a control group using propensity scores predicted by a logit model. The logit model indicated that the CFA was biased against farmers who were relatively poor, risk averse and short of farming skills and experience. However, {{there was no evidence that}} participation was influenced by gender, education, farm size or household labour endowments. Univariate comparisons revealed significant differences in key outcomes between participants and households in the control group. A multivariate ‘treatment’ model estimated to isolate the impact of the CFA found that participation had a substantial positive impact on household cash revenue (ETB 3, 658 per adult equivalent) and <b>net</b> <b>cash</b> <b>income</b> (ETB 3, 411 per adult equivalent) earned from crop production. Local Average Treatment Effects (LATEs) computed for ‘complier’ households were also sizeable for these outcomes at ETB 2, 879 and ETB 1, 896 per adult equivalent respectively. Participants attributed increases in net income to improved seed, a stable product price, higher yields and a guaranteed market. Descriptive analysis of other perceived outcomes suggested that participants also benefited from improved food security and better access to preferred markets, credit, new technology, information and technical advice.

The farm investment is a complex process owing to many factors such as differences in the types of assets and their gestation period apart from varying lending procedures and recovery methods followed by different lending agencies. In this context, the present study was taken up to evaluate the different impacts of credit or owned capital on farm investment and also on the returns to investment. The overall objective {{of the study was to}} analyze the impact of farm finance and investment on profitability of farms. Also, to identify the determinants of farm investment and the factors influencing returns from investment.

40|$|This report {{contains}} {{the results of}} an analysis of the National Counter-Cyclical Income Support Program for Dairy Producers on the Agricultural and Food Policy Center’s (AFPC) representative dairy farms. The impact of the proposal on the representative farms is evaluated in terms of the change in average annual cash receipts and the change in the average annual <b>net</b> <b>cash</b> farm <b>income.</b> The role and potential importance of payment limits on these farms are discussed. All milk prices by state and program benefits under the payment limit binding and nonbinding scenarios were developed by FAPRI and were applied to the representative dairies. For more information on those results see the FAPRI analysis of this program. Agribusiness, Agricultural and Food Policy, Livestock Production/Industries,...|$|R
40|$|A whole-farm {{simulation}} model {{is used to}} analyze the impacts of PST adoption on representative farms in Missouri and Indiana. Farmers who do not adopt experience lower average annual <b>net</b> <b>cash</b> farm <b>incomes</b> than adopters. Lower feed prices and/or an average PST/feed response decrease the incentive to adopt. Payment of a 5 percent carcass merit premium (CMP) and/or higher grain prices greatly increase the economic incentive to adopt. Key Words: Carcass Merit Premium, PST, Simulation Porcine Somatotropin (PST) is a naturally-occurring hormone in swine which accelerates the rate of growth, increases feed efficiency, and produces leaner hogs, Although the effects of PST on feeder hogs has been known for many years, it was not used commercially in the United States because of lack of federal approval. The ability to produce PST using recombinant DNA technolog...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2014 The recent 2013 Oregon State Board of Agriculture report {{identified}} {{several ways to}} improve agricultural income in Oregon. Recommendations to improve water development {{are at the top}} of the report's list of objectives. In this study, I analyze the relationship between <b>net</b> <b>cash</b> farm <b>income</b> (NCFI) and a cross-sectional set of climate, production, and water policy variables for an eleven western state region and a four-state subset representing the Pacific Northwest region. County-level farm data from 2007 are used. The results indicate that agricultural water use and policy strongly influence county NCFI. Contributions to income from climate and production characteristics are also considerable but differ depending on the study region. Although the results confirm the positive relationship between NCFI and water development, new projects face a difficult regulatory environment and uncertain access to water...|$|R
