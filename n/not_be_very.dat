5|$|During World War II, {{scientists}} from the United Kingdom, United States and Japan (Unit 731 of the imperial Japanese army) were involved in research into producing a biological weapon from smallpox. Plans of large scale production were never carried through as they considered that the weapon would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> effective due to the wide-scale availability of a vaccine.|$|E
5|$|Yannick LeJacq of Kotaku, {{commenting on}} the 2014 game MouseCraft which {{incorporates}} elements of Lemmings and Tetris, speculated that games like Lemmings would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> successful in the current gaming market, as {{the pace of the}} game is far too slow to satisfy most players.|$|E
5|$|Lysosomes are organelles {{that contain}} hydrolytic enzymes {{that are used}} for {{intracellular}} digestion. The main functions of a lysosome are to process molecules taken in by the cell and to recycle worn out cell parts. The enzymes inside of lysosomes are acid hydrolases which require an acidic environment for optimal performance. Lysosomes provide such an environment by maintaining a pH of 5.0 inside of the organelle. If a lysosome were to rupture, the enzymes released would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> active because of the cytosol's neutral pH. However, if numerous lysosomes leaked the cell could be destroyed from autodigestion.|$|E

5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. Mulder is a believer in the paranormal, while the skeptical Scully has been {{assigned}} to debunk his work. In this episode, Mulder and Scully investigate the Church of God with Signs and Wonders, a church where the Bible is read literally, and punishment is dealt deftly, after a small town church {{is the site of}} a number of ritualistic-like murders. But soon the agents realize that the difference between the peaceful religious and the fanatics may <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> much at all.|$|E
5|$|The {{goldcrest}} is monogamous. The male sings {{during the}} breeding season, usually while foraging {{rather than from}} a perch. It has a display involving bowing its head towards another bird and raising the coloured crest. Firecrests will sometimes defend their territories against goldcrests, but the amount of actual competition between the species may <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> great. A Spanish study suggested that territorial conflicts between species, and other phenomena like males singing mixed or alternating songs, were most frequent when one species locally far outnumbered the other; in other circumstances, the two species learned to ignore each other's songs. However, in very small areas of conifers it is rare for the goldcrest and the firecrest to share territories; either {{one or the other}} is present, but not both. A male goldcrest will defend his territory against either species, sometimes including some firecrest phrases in his song.|$|E
5|$|By August 1967, Baer and Harrison had {{completed}} a third prototype machine, but {{had found that}} to even come near to Baer's initial aim of a US$20 or $25 console would require {{so much to be}} excluded that the resulting console would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> enjoyable. Baer additionally felt that he was not proving successful at designing fun games for the system; to make up for this he formally added Bill Rusch, who had helped him come up with the initial games for the console, to the project. Though the pair found Rusch difficult to work with, he soon proved his value to the team by coming {{up with a way to}} display three spots on the screen at once rather than the previous two, and proposing the development of a ping pong game. By November the team, now on their fourth prototype machine, had a ping pong game, a chasing game, a light gun game, and three types of controllers: joysticks for the chase game, a rifle for the light gun game, and a three dial controller for the ping pong game. Campman felt that the system was advanced enough to begin trying to find a manufacturer to buy it; they had decided to aim for selling the rights to produce the console, as Sanders was not in the business of making and selling commercial electronics.|$|E

25|$|If the gas or {{liquid is}} very viscous (resulting in {{turbulent}} differential motion), {{the reversal of}} the magnetic field may <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> periodic.

25|$|Although {{some items}} of the {{infrastructure}} requirements above can already be easily produced on Earth and would therefore <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> valuable as trade items (oxygen, water, base metal ores, silicates, etc.), other high value items are more abundant, more easily produced, of higher quality, or can only be produced in space. These would provide (over the long-term) a very high return on the initial investment in space infrastructure.|$|E

25|$|The {{utility of}} a model will be given, at least in part, by the degree of {{accuracy}} and precision of the model. An accurate model with relatively poor precision could be useful to study the evolutionary relationships between the structures {{of a set of}} proteins, whereas the rational drug design requires both precise and accurate models. A model that is not accurate, regardless of the degree of precision with which it was obtained will <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> useful.|$|E
25|$|In {{the second}} stage, {{abnormal}} new blood vessels (neovascularisation) form {{at the back}} of the eye as part of proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR); these can burst and bleed (vitreous hemorrhage) and blur the vision, because these new blood vessels are fragile. The first time this bleeding occurs, it may <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> severe. In most cases, it will leave just a few specks of blood, or spots floating in a person's visual field, though the spots often go away after few hours.|$|E

25|$|When {{seen from}} above, a sexually mature female hamster has a trim tail line; a male's tail line bulges on both sides. This might <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> visible in all species. Male hamsters {{typically}} have very large testes {{in relation to}} their body size. Before sexual maturity occurs, it is more difficult to determine a young hamster's sex. When examined, female hamsters have their anal and genital openings close together, whereas males have these two holes farther apart (the penis is usually withdrawn into the coat and thus appears as a hole or pink pimple).|$|E
25|$|The Olympic bid was unsuccessful, coming {{third in}} the bidding process that {{concluded}} in October 2009. The Vice-President of the Japan Football Association, Junji Ogura, had previously admitted that if Tokyo were to fail in its bid, its chances of hosting either the 2018 or 2022 World Cup would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> good. On 4 May 2010, Japan {{announced that it was}} withdrawing its bid for the 2018 tournament to focus on 2022, amidst rising speculation that the 2018 edition will be held in Europe.|$|E
25|$|Korchnoi, in a 2006 lecture in London, {{mentioned}} that the breakthrough {{that allowed him to}} resume international appearances came when Anatoly Karpov inherited the World Championship title (forfeited by Bobby Fischer). Questions arose about how Karpov had qualified to be a World Champion, when he had never played Fischer. Since Korchnoi was not publicly visible, it was largely believed that he (and Karpov) could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> strong. Korchnoi was then allowed to play the 1976 Amsterdam tournament, as a means to prove Karpov was a worthy World Champion.|$|E

25|$|Polish Railways {{for many}} years did not possess the rolling stock to achieve speeds over 160km/h. Polish Railways planned to buy Pendolino trains in 1998, but the {{contract}} was cancelled the following year by the Supreme Control Chamber due to financial losses by Polish Railways. However, a new contact with Alstom Transport worth 665 million euros was signed in May 2011 and since December 2014, 20 Pendolino units service the Katowice/Kraków - Gdynia line and Wrocław/Warsaw line. However, Pendolinos in Poland are not equipped with tillting system, which would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> useful on the flat Polish Plains. The lack of a tilting system for the Pendolino train along with choosing Alstom Transportation despite domestic train producers was a subject of broad debate in media and Polish Railways were heavily criticised for that purchase.|$|E
25|$|A simple linear {{polarizer}} {{can be made}} by tilting a stack of glass plates at Brewster's angle to the beam. Some of the s-polarized light is reflected from each surface of each plate. For a stack of plates, each reflection depletes the incident beam of s-polarized light, leaving a greater fraction of p-polarized light in the transmitted beam at each stage. For visible light in air and typical glass, Brewster's angle is about 57°, and about 16% of the s-polarized light present in the beam is reflected for each air-to-glass or glass-to-air transition. It takes many plates to achieve even mediocre polarization of the transmitted beam with this approach. For a stack of 10 plates (20 reflections), about 3% (=(1-0.16)20) of the s-polarized light is transmitted. The reflected beam, while fully polarized, is spread out and may <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> useful.|$|E
25|$|There {{is little}} openly {{published}} {{information on the}} device shipments of desktop and laptop computers. Gartner publishes estimates, but the way the estimates are calculated is not openly published. Another source of market share of various operating systems is StatCounter basing its estimate on web use (although this may <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>very</b> accurate). Also, sales may overstate usage. Most computers are sold with a pre-installed operating system (OS); some users replace that OS with a different one due to personal preference, or install another OS alongside it and use both. Conversely, sales underestimate usage by not counting unauthorized copies. For example, in 2009, approximately 80% of software sold in China were due to copyright infringement. In 2007, the statistics from an automated update of IE7 for registered Windows computers differed with the observed web browser share, leading one writer to estimate that 25–35% of all Windows XP installations were illegal.|$|E
