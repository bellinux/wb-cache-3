25|$|While {{direct support}} {{has not been}} found for these hypotheses, {{evidence}} that favours this theory exists. Further, while percentages of the likelihood of homosexuality have been estimated to be increased by 15–48% per older brother, these odds really account {{for only a few}} percent of the population; thus, this hypothesis cannot be universally applied to the majority of homosexual men. Not all studies have been able to reproduce the fraternal birth order effect. Some did not find any statistically significant difference in either the sibling composition or rate of older brothers of gay and straight men, including large, <b>nationally</b> <b>representative</b> studies in the US and Denmark.|$|E
25|$|A 2010 <b>nationally</b> <b>representative</b> {{study of}} Australians over 18 years {{published}} in The Medical Journal of Australia found that 61 per cent said abortion should be lawful without question {{for a woman}} in her first trimester of pregnancy, while 26 per cent said it should be lawful depending on the reason. In the second trimester (12 to 24 weeks), support for outright lawful abortion was 12 per cent, while 57 per cent said it depended on circumstances. For third trimester or late-term abortions, 6 per cent said it should be outright lawful while 42 per cent said it depended on circumstances and 48 per cent said it should be unlawful.|$|E
25|$|Recent {{advances}} in data collection have vastly improved {{our ability to}} understand important relationships between retirement and factors such as health, wealth, employment characteristics and family dynamics, among others. The most prominent study for examining retirement behavior in the United States is the ongoing Health and Retirement Study (HRS), first fielded in 1992. The HRS is a <b>nationally</b> <b>representative</b> longitudinal survey of adults in the U.S. ages 51+, conducted every two years, and contains {{a wealth of information}} on such topics as labor force participation (e.g., current employment, job history, retirement plans, industry/occupation, pensions, disability), health (e.g., health status and history, health and life insurance, cognition), financial variables (e.g., assets and income, housing, net worth, wills, consumption and savings), family characteristics (e.g., family structure, transfers, parent/child/grandchild/sibling information) {{and a host of other}} topics (e.g., expectations, expenses, internet use, risk taking, psychosocial, time use).|$|E
25|$|In a <b>nationally</b> <b>representative,</b> online {{sample of}} 3145 men and 3283 women, 3.6% {{of the men}} and 1.4% of the women {{identified}} as gay. A further 5.5% {{of the men and}} 7.4% of the women identified as bisexual. Self-identification was assessed on a 5-point scale and all three non-exclusive options were combined for bisexual self-identification. Same-sex attraction is more prevalent than homo- or bisexual orientation. Of the men, 9.9% reported at least some same-sex attraction (4.2% exclusively). Among women, this was 10.9% (1.5% exclusively), of which a large group reported mainly heterosexual attraction. Of the men, 3.6% had had sex with men {{in the past six months}} and a further 2.0% with both men and women. For women, these percentages were 1.6% and 0.8% respectively. Gay or bisexual self-identification without same-sex attraction was almost non-existent. However, not all men and women who felt attracted to their own gender identified as gay or bisexual. Same-sex sexual behavior did occur among men and women who neither reported any same-sex attraction or a gay or bisexual identification, especially when lifelong sexual behavior was considered.|$|E
25|$|A 2005 review {{determined}} that some, but not all, randomized controlled {{studies have found}} that AAS use correlates with hypomania and increased aggressiveness, but pointed out that attempts to determine whether AAS use triggers violent behavior have failed, primarily because of high rates of non-participation. A 2008 study on a <b>nationally</b> <b>representative</b> sample of young adult males in the United States found an association between lifetime and past-year self-reported AAS use and involvement in violent acts. Compared with individuals that did not use steroids, young adult males that used AAS reported greater involvement in violent behaviors even after controlling for the effects of key demographic variables, previous violent behavior, and polydrug use. A 1996 review examining the blind studies available at that time also found that these had demonstrated a link between aggression and steroid use, but pointed out that with estimates of over one million past or current steroid users in the United States at that time, an extremely small percentage of those using steroids appear to have experienced mental disturbance severe enough to result in clinical treatments or medical case reports.|$|E
25|$|In 2000, {{researchers}} Roberto Colom and Francisco J. Abad {{conducted a}} large study of 10,475 adults on five IQ tests {{taken from the}} Primary Mental Abilities and found negligible or no significant sex differences. The tests conducted were on vocabulary, spatial rotation, verbal fluency and inductive reasoning. Roberto Colom in 2002 found that males' IQs were 3.16 points higher on the WAIS III test, but {{that there was no}} difference on the general intelligence factor (g) and therefore explained the differences as due to non-g factors such as specific group factors and test specificity. Responding to findings by Richard Lynn in 2002, researchers Roberto Colom and Oscar Garcia Lopez proposed that g factor is the variance of correlation among different IQ tests and not the sum of group scores published by Lynn in his studies. So measuring variance of Colom's study of 4,072 high school graduates, they found that females outperform males on the inductive Primary Mental Abilities reasoning test, males outperform females on the Raven's Progressive Matrices and that there is no difference on the Culture-Fair intelligence test and therefore concluded no difference in general intelligence. Using multi-group covariance and mean group structure analysis in 2006, researchers Sophie van der Sluis, Conor V. Dolan and Roberto Colom found that g factor couldn't explain any sex differences on the WAIS III. Later that year in another study, the same researchers concluded that sex differences on WAIS are due to primary factors or broad stratum abilities like working memory and perceptual organization not g factor. A study conducted by Jim Flynn and Lilia Rossi-Case (2011) found that men and women achieved roughly equal IQ scores on Raven's Progressive Matrices after reviewing recent standardization samples in five modernized nations. In 2010, researcher Emily Savage-McGlynn proposed that inconsistent results in sex differences are due to opportunity samples rather than samples that represent the general population. After a study with a <b>nationally</b> <b>representative</b> sample of 926 participants in the UK, no sex difference was found in the Raven's Progressive Matrices test.|$|E

2500|$|In a <b>nationally</b> <b>representative</b> {{online survey}} of 7,841 French adults {{carried out by}} IFOP in early 2011, 6.6% of {{respondents}} identified as homosexual (3.6%) or bisexual (3%), and 90.8% as heterosexual.

The bisexual population had fewer statistically significant deviations from the heterosexual population, resembling the heterosexuals on some measures, homosexuals on others, or being at a midpoint on still some others. However, they were more likely to be aged 18–24 than the other two groups. Like homosexuals, they were also more likely to be single.|$|E
2500|$|The main {{sticking}} {{point during the}} autumn negotiations had been the method of choosing the merged party's leader.

2500|$|In 1997, {{psychology}} professor Bruce Rind from Temple University and doctoral student Philip Tromovitch from the University of Pennsylvania published a literature review in The Journal of Sex Research of seven studies regarding adjustment problems {{of victims of}} child sexual abuse (CSA). [...] To avoid the sampling bias that, they argued, existed in most studies of CSA (which drew from samples mostly in the mental health or legal systems and thus were, as a sample, unlike the population as a whole), the 1997 study combined data from studies using only national samples of individuals expected to be more representative of the population {{of child sexual abuse}} victims.

2500|$|Based on <b>nationally</b> <b>representative</b> data, a study {{conducted}} by Kaiser Family Foundation in five-year intervals in 1998–99, 2003–04, and 2008–09 found that with technology allowing nearly 24-hour media access, the amount of time young people spend with entertainment media has risen dramatically, especially among Black and Hispanic youth. [...] Today, 8- to 18-year-olds devote an average of 7 hours and 38 minutes (7:38) to using entertainment media in a typical day (more than 53 hours a week) – about the same amount most adults spend at work per day. [...] Since much of that time is spent 'media multitasking' (using more than one medium at a time), they actually manage to spend a total of 10 hours and 45 minutes worth of media content in those 7½ hours per day. According to the Pew Internet & American Life Project, 96% of 18- to 29-year-olds and three-quarters (75%) of teens now own a cell phone, 88% of whom text, with 73% of wired American teens using social networking websites, a significant increase from previous years. A survey of over 25000 9- to 16-year-olds from 25 European countries found that many underage children use social media sites despite the site's stated age requirements, and many youth lack the digital skills to use social networking sites safely.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{specific}} {{estimates of}} the percentage of United States homeless youth who identify as LGBT vary widely, estimates generally fall somewhere between 11 and 40 percent. Barriers to a more definitive percentage include the lack of a <b>nationally</b> <b>representative</b> study and the possibility of underreporting due to stigma associated with identifying as LGBT. The city from which the sample is drawn for each study may also account for a difference in estimates. For example, one 2004 study at the University of Nebraska Lincoln noted that while estimates based on samples from Los Angeles range from 25 to 40 percent, a 1999 study of small and medium Midwestern cities concluded that only 6% of homeless youth there identified as LGBT. According to the authors of this study, geographical location could affect these numbers. For example, due to the higher risk of coming out in rural, midwestern cities, [...] youth {{may be more likely to}} either stay closeted there or to migrate to larger cities. Further, the authors continue, the differences might reflect differences in the ages of the samples in the different studies, or other differences in sampling methodology. The study concludes that when taken together, a general consensus can be found among the studies that 20% of homeless youth in magnet studies identify as gay, lesbian or bisexual, with the number being slightly lower in nonmagnet cities. Finally, in a 2012 study, legal expert Nusrat Ventimiglia noted that studies focusing on the number of transgender youth who experience homelessness are less prevalent, and therefore including youth who identify as transgender but not as gay, lesbian or bisexual could result in an estimate of 40 percent.|$|E
