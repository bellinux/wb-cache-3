5|$|The 30th Infantry Division {{began its}} advance on 2 October, using divisional heavy {{artillery}} to target German pillboxes; {{even then it}} took, on average, thirty minutes to capture a single pillbox. The Americans found that if they failed to immediately press {{on to the next}} pillbox, the Germans were sure to counterattack. Heavy resistance had not been expected, and one company lost 87 combatants in an hour; another lost 93 out of 120soldiers to a German artillery strike. The attackers were slowly able to cross the Wurm River and engage German pillboxes with flamethrowers and explosive charges. By the afternoon of 2 October, elements of the 30th Infantry Division had breached German defenses and reached the town of Palenberg. Here, GIs advanced house-to-house and fought a number of gruesome hand grenade duels. (Private Harold G. Kiner would be awarded the Medal of Honor for throwing himself on a German grenade near Palenberg, thus saving the lives of two fellow soldiers). Fighting in the town of Rimburg was equally terrible; American armor had <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> across the Wurm River, and therefore could not provide fire support to infantrymen who were attempting to storm a medieval castle being used as a fort by the Germans. The 30th Infantry Division subdued roughly 50 German pillboxes {{on the first day of}} the advance, often having to envelop the structure and attack from the rear. The division's effort was aided by the 29th Infantry Division's diversionary attacks on their flank, leading the Germans to believe that that was the Americans' main attack. On the night of 2 October, the German 902nd Assault Gun Battalion was ordered to launch a counterattack against the 30th Infantry Division, but Allied artillery delayed the start of the raid, and ultimately the attempt failed.|$|E
25|$|No new rail {{projects}} {{were able to}} get off the ground for many years until the 1990s when several factors combined to make the idea more palatable to area politicians. Governor Jesse Ventura and Minnesota Transportation Commissioner Elwyn Tinklenberg heavily promoted the idea of rail transport, and significant amounts of money became available from the federal government. Previous governors had advocated light rail, but had <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> legislation passed. Governor Tim Pawlenty had campaigned on a promise to fight the expansion of light rail, but altered his opinions after taking office. He also initially opposed the Northstar Line commuter rail project, which is a rail corridor north of Minneapolis, but changed his mind about that project in January 2004 when a scaled-back version was shown to have good potential.|$|E
25|$|Donald Tsang, the Chief Executive of Hong Kong, {{offered his}} condolences to the victims' families, {{stating that the}} Chinese {{government}} would do anything within its power to aid and rehabilitate the survivors and their families. He complained that he had <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> through to President Aquino by telephone during the siege, and criticized the way the siege was handled. The government chartered two airplanes carrying doctors and counsellors to Manila to support {{the survivors of the}} incident, and to fly the Hong Kong victims home. The bodies of all eight victims, along with most of the survivors, were returned to Hong Kong on August 25, 2010. A memorial ceremony was held as the victims arrived on the tarmac of Hong Kong International Airport, attended, amongst others, by Chief Secretary for Administration Henry Tang and Secretary for Security Ambrose Lee.|$|E

500|$|In November, as {{a result}} of the {{acquisition}} EMI released Songs from the South – Volume 2, a collection of Kelly's songs from the last decade, following on from Songs from the South – Volume 1. The new compilation featured the first physical release of Kelly's song, [...] "Shane Warne". Volume 1 and Volume 2 are available separately but also as a combined double album. EMI released a DVD, Paul Kelly – The Video Collection 1985–2008, a collection of Kelly's home videos made over the past 23 years. Also included are several live performances. Songs from the South – Volume 2 included one new song, [...] "Thoughts in the Middle of the Night", which he described as [...] "It's a band song, we all wrote it together. There's a poem by James Fenton, a British poet, called [...] "The Mistake", which is probably an influence on the lyrics.

500|$|Liu Xia {{was under}} house-arrest almost {{immediately}} after the announcement, and was escorted to Liaoning to visit her imprisoned husband. She reported that she was denied visitors, her telephones were repeatedly down, and complained that even her elderly mother had <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> through to her. Visitors were denied entrance to her residential compound, including Norwegian diplomats {{who had tried to}} visit her on 12 October; she was able to send out a few messages through Twitter. Chinese police stationed there cordoned off the area. Thus, journalists and well-wishers were kept at bay for several hours after the announcement; as she was being taken away to see her husband, Reuters heard her say [...] "they are forcing me to leave Beijing". Dissident groups reported on 18 October that numerous supporters and associates of Liu may have been detained by police—that Tiananmen Mother Ding Zilin, and her husband Jiang Peikun, had not been seen or heard of for four days, and that their phones were cut off. Writer Jiang Qisheng went missing just days after the Nobel announcement.|$|E

2500|$|In {{a widely}} publicized report, former Deputy Leader of the Red Electoral Alliance Marte Mjøs Persen left the party, believing {{there was a}} big generational gap between the older and younger members of Red. She further claimed that only the older members, who have their origins from the {{foundation}} of the Red Electoral Alliance and the Workers' Communist Party, controlled the party. Persen's statements were met with positive response by fellow party members and outsiders. Mathias Furevik, who had served as Dahle's campaign manager, agreed with her accusations. Bergen City Council representative, Stine Akre, reluctantly agreed with Persen's accusations and said; [...] "Red is now a party for middle-aged men, and has <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> rid of the generation gap. It also means that many younger people will get burned out before they move the party's direction." [...] Persen shortly after joined the Norwegian Labour Party.|$|E
2500|$|Maugham's father, Robert Ormond Maugham, was {{a lawyer}} who handled the legal affairs of the British embassy in Paris. Since French law {{declared}} that all children born on French soil could be conscripted for military service, his father arranged for Maugham to be born at the embassy, technically on British soil. His grandfather, another Robert, was a prominent lawyer and co-founder of the Law Society of England and Wales. Maugham refers to this grandfather's writings in Chapter 6 his literary memoir, The Summing Up: [...] "...in the catalogue of the Library at the British Museum {{there is a long}} list of his legal works. [...] He wrote only one book that was not of this character. [...] It was a collection of essays that he had contributed to the solid magazines of the day and he issued it, as became his sense of decorum, anonymously. I once had the book in my hands, a handsome volume bound in calf, but I never read it and I have <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> hold of a copy since. [...] I wish I had, for I might have learnt from it something of the kind of man he was." [...] His family assumed Maugham and his brothers would be lawyers. His elder brother, Viscount Maugham, enjoyed a distinguished legal career and served as Lord Chancellor from 1938 to 1939.|$|E
