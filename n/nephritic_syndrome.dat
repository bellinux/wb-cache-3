50|$|<b>Nephritic</b> <b>{{syndrome}}</b> (or acute <b>nephritic</b> <b>syndrome)</b> is a syndrome comprising {{signs of}} nephritis, which is kidney disease involving inflammation. It often occurs in glomerulonephritis, which {{is characterized by}} a thin glomerular basement membrane and small pores in the podocytes of the glomerulus, large enough to permit proteins and red blood cells to pass into the urine (yielding proteinuria and hematuria). By contrast, nephrotic syndrome is characterized by only proteins moving into the urine. <b>Nephritic</b> <b>syndrome,</b> like nephrotic syndrome, may involve hypoalbuminemia due to the protein albumin moving from the blood to the urine.|$|E
50|$|Glomerulonephritis {{refers to}} an {{inflammation}} of the glomerulus, which is the unit involved in filtration in the kidney. This inflammation typically results in {{one or both of}} the nephrotic or <b>nephritic</b> <b>syndromes.</b>|$|R
50|$|Mesangial {{cells in}} the renal {{glomerulus}} use endocytosis to take up and degrade circulating immunoglobulin. This normal process stimulates mesangial cell proliferation and matrix deposition. Therefore, during times of elevated circulating immunoglobulin (i.e. lupus and IgA nephropathy) {{one would expect to}} see an increased number of mesangial cells and matrix in the glomerulus. This is characteristic of <b>nephritic</b> <b>syndromes.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{presence}} of {{red blood cells}} within the cast is always pathological, and is strongly indicative of granulomatosis with polyangiitis, systemic lupus erythematosus, post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis or Goodpasture's syndrome. They can also be associated with renal infarction and subacute bacterial endocarditis. They are a yellowish-brown color and are generally cylindrical with sometimes ragged edges; their fragility makes inspection of a fresh sample necessary.

40|$|The {{discipline}} of paediatric nephrology encompasses the congenital <b>nephritic</b> <b>syndromes,</b> renal dysplasias, neonatal renal tumours, early onset cystic disease, tubulopathies and vesicoureteric reflux, {{all of which}} arise due to defects in normal kidney development. Indeed, congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) represent 20 - 30 % of prenatal anomalies, occurring in 1 in 500 births. Developmental biologists have studied the anatomical and morphogenetic processes involved in kidney development {{for the last five}} decades. However, with the advent of transgenic mice, the sequencing of the genome, improvements in mutation detection and the advent of functional genomics, our understanding of the molecular basis of kidney development has grown significantly. Here we discuss how the advent of new genetic and genomics approaches has added to our understanding of kidney development and paediatric renal disease, as well as identifying areas in which we are still lacking knowledge...|$|R

40|$|Aim There is {{a paucity}} of data {{pertaining}} to the incidence of biopsy-proven glomerulonephritis (GN) in Australia. This retrospective study aims to review the data from all adult native renal biopsies performed {{in the state of}} Queensland from 2002 to 2011 - comparing results with centres from across the world. Methods Pathology reports of 3697 adult native kidney biopsies were reviewed, of which 2048 had GN diagnoses. Age, gender, clinical indication and histopathology findings were compared. Results The average age at biopsy was 48 ± 17 years. Male preponderance was noted overall (∼ 60 %), with lupus nephritis being the only individual GN with female predilection. The average rate of biopsy was 12. 04 per hundred thousand people per year (php/yr). Nephrotic and <b>nephritic</b> <b>syndromes</b> comprised approximately 75 % of all clinical indications that lead to GN diagnoses. IgA nephropathy (1. 41 php/yr) was the most common primary GN followed by focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (1. 02 php/yr) and crescentic GN (0. 73 php/yr). Diabetic nephropathy (0. 84 php/yr), lupus nephritis (0. 69 php/yr) and amyloidosis (0. 19 php/yr) were the most commonly identified secondary GN. Conclusion IgA nephropathy is the predominant primary GN in Queensland, and nephrotic syndrome the most common indication for a renal biopsy. While crescentic GN incidence has significantly increased with time, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis incidence has not shown any trend. Incidence of GN overall appears to increase with age. The annual rate of biopsy in this study appears lower than previously published in an Australian population...|$|R
40|$|Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), the causative {{agent of}} {{infectious}} mononucleosis, plays {{a significant role}} as a cofactor in the process of tumorigenesis, and has consistently been associated with a variety of malignancies especially in immunocompromised patients. Forty-four children and adolescents (21 liver transplant patients, 7 heart transplant, 5 AIDS, 3 autoimmune hepatitis, 2 <b>nephritic</b> <b>syndromes,</b> 2 medullar aplasia, 2 primary immunodeficiency disorder patients, 1 thrombocytopenic purpura and 1 systemic lupus erythematosus) presenting with chronic active EBV infection (VCA-IgM persistently positive; VCA-IgG > 20 AU/mL and positive IgG - EBNA) had peripheral blood samples obtained during clinically characterized EBV reactivation episodes. DNA samples were amplified in order to detect and type EBV {{on the basis of the}} EBNA- 2 sequence (EBNA 2 protein is essential for EBV-driven immortalization of B lymphocytes). Although we have found a predominance of type 1 EBNA- 2 virus (33 / 44; 75 %), 10 patients (22. 73 %) carried type 2 EBNA- 2, and one liver transplant patient (2. 27 %) a mixture of the two types, the higher proportion of type 2 EBV, as well as the finding of one patient bearing the two types is in agreement with other reports held on lymphoproliferative disorder (LPD) patients, which analyzed tumor biopsies. We conclude that EBNA- 2 detection and typing can be performed in peripheral blood samples, and the high prevalence of type 2 in our casuistic indicates that this population is actually at risk of developing LPD, and should be monitored.

40|$|Henoch-Schonlein purpura (HSP) {{is a form}} of {{systemic}} vasculitis characterized by vascular wall deposits of predominantly IgA, typically involving small vessels in skin, gut, and glomeruli and associated with purpura, intestinal colic, hematuria, and arthralgia or arthritis. HSP nephritis leads to chronic renal failure in up to 20 % of pediatric patients after 20 years of follow-up in selected series. The risk is related to the initial clinical presentation and is maximal (more than 50 %) when initial signs are a combination of nephrotic and <b>nephritic</b> <b>syndromes.</b> Although less important, the risk persists for mild renal symptoms or when the patient has apparently completely recovered from the renal disease. Other types of non-IgA-related leukocytoclastic vasculitis may be difficult to discriminate from HSP, thus confounding the diagnosis. The clinical picture of HSP is often incomplete and renal signs can become manifest years after initial signs. When based on clinical signs only, the diagnosis of HSP can therefore be missed, and some patients risk developing silent chronic renal failure after decades without appropriate treatment. Patients can also be overdiagnosed as HSP and thus submitted to unnecessary follow-up. It is therefore important that HSP should be correctly diagnosed from the initial signs. As the finding of IgA deposits in vessel walls associated with the characteristic signs of small-vessel vasculitis is a sine qua non in the diagnosis, a skin biopsy should be performed for histological and immunofluorescence studies in cases of clinical suspicion of HSP. The systematic diagnostic use of a cutaneous biopsy should not only improve the follow-up of patients with HSP but will also allow a reliable epidemiological study of vasculitis in children and a better knowledge of the diseas...|$|R

A 45 -year-old gentleman with chronic kidney disease due to unknown etiology received renal transplantation from his sister with 4 HLA mismatches. He received antithymocte globulin induction therapy and was maintained on steroids, azathioprine (AZA) and cyclosporine A (CsA). Up to eight years post-transplantation he was clinically and biochemically stable.

50|$|Renal {{physiology}} is {{the study}} of kidney function, while nephrology is the medical specialty concerned with kidney diseases. Diseases of the kidney are diverse, but individuals with kidney disease frequently display characteristic clinical features. Common clinical conditions involving the kidney include the <b>nephritic</b> and nephrotic <b>syndromes,</b> renal cysts, acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease, urinary tract infection, kidney stones, and urinary tract obstruction. Various cancers of the kidney exist. The most common adult renal cancer is renal cell carcinoma. Cancers, cysts, and some other renal conditions can be managed with removal of the kidney. This is known as nephrectomy. When renal function, measured by the glomerular filtration rate, is persistently poor, dialysis and kidney transplantation may be treatment options. Although they are not normally harmful, kidney stones can be extremely painful.|$|R
40|$|The {{diversity}} of clinical presentations of lupus nephritis parallel the {{diversity of}} pathologic lesions seen in the kidneys of patients with SLE. Renal manifestations range from asymptomatic hematuria or proteinuria to overt <b>nephritic</b> and nephrotic <b>syndromes,</b> rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, and chronic renal failure. Subclinical nephropathy both during presentation and during monitoring of disease activity is frequently missed because of the notorious unreliability of routine screening urinalyses performed in high-throughput clinical pathology laboratories. Requisitions for urine microscopy should be flagged for special attention in patients at risk for lupus nephritis. Depression of classic complement pathway components and high titers of anti-DNA, anti-nucleosome, or anti-C 1 q antibodies identify patients are increased risk of renal involvement or flares of nephritis. Several disease activity and damage indexes are available, but they are mostly used in clinical research setting and none has achieved wide use for standard clinical practice.

40|$|What is the {{difference}} between IgA nephropathy and Henoch-Schönlein purpura nephritis? Henoch-Schönlein purpura nephritis (HSPN) and IgA nephropathy (IgAN) are considered to be related diseases since both can be encountered consecutively in the same patient, they have been described in twins, and bear identical pathological and biological abnormalities. Apart from the presence of extrarenal clinical signs found only in HSPN, other differences are noticed between the two diseases. The peak age ranges between 15 and 30 years for a diagnosis of IgAN, whereas HSPN is mainly seen in childhood. <b>Nephritic</b> and/or nephrotic <b>syndromes</b> are more often seen at presentation in HSPN. In contrast to IgAN, HSPN has been described in association with hypersensitivity. Endocapillary and extracapillary inflammations as well as fibrin deposits in the glomerulus are more frequent in HSPN. No major biological differences have been found between the two illnesses, except for a larger size of circulating IgA-containing complexes (IgA-CC) and a greater incidence of increased plasma IgE levels in HSPN. As tissue infiltration by leukocytes is a major feature of HSPN vasculitis, a possible role of a more potent activation of the latter cells by IgA-CC and/or circulating chemokines in HSPN should be considered. Further studies are required to elucidate this possible mechanism as well as the role of hypersensitivity in HSPN...|$|R

Sixteen patients with AGN (10 males) and nine patients with NS and hypoalbuminemia (7 males) were studied on admission, and after recovery (12 AGN patients) or remission (4 NS patients). Eighteen normal controls were each studied after five days on a low (20 mEq Na/day), regular (120 mEq Na/day) and high (300 mEq Na/day) dietary salt intake. Patients with AGN and NS had comparable edema (AGN 2. 8 ± 0. 53 kg; NS 3. 36 ± 0. 47 kg; SE) and urinary Na excretion (mean ± SEM: AGN 0. 97 ± 0. 11 mEq/hr; NS 1. 06 ± 0. 16 mEq/hr), but AGN patients had five times higher ANF (AGN 27. 2 ± 4. 06 fmol/ml; NS 5. 51 ± 1. 02 fmol/ml; P < 0. 001) and six times lower PRA ng/liter · sec levels (AGN 0. 187 ± 0. 047; NS 1. 144 ± 0. 222; P < 0. 001) than NS patients.

Our studies suggest that intrarenal mechanisms are responsible for Na retention in AGN as well as in NS, but AGN patients have a compensatory hormonal response related to the degree of fluid retention, while volume-sensing receptors in hypoalbuminemic NS patients are neither actively stimulated nor suppressed, probably due to increased transudation of fluid out of the capillaries...|$|R
