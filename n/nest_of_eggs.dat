25|$|Dong and Currie {{reported}} {{the discovery of}} an oviraptorid from the Djadokhta Formation of northern China preserved {{on top of a}} <b>nest</b> <b>of</b> <b>eggs.</b> This overturned more than 60 years of interpreting the Oviraptor of the Central Asiatic Expeditions as a rapacious egg-thief in favor of it likely being a faithful mother at her nest.|$|E
25|$|Osborn {{described}} the new non-ceratopsian theropod dinosaur {{genus and species}} Oviraptor philoceratops. Since a specimen was found preserved {{on top of a}} <b>nest</b> <b>of</b> <b>eggs</b> presumed to belong to Protoceratops and its short toothless beak seemed adapted to cracking open eggs, Osborn thought that it was smothered by a sandstorm while in the act of raiding the nest.|$|E
500|$|In 2004 Lü {{and colleagues}} {{determined}} that the skeleton belonged to a new, distinct taxon, and made it the holotype specimen of Nemegtia barsboldi. The genus name refers to the Nemegt Basin, and the specific name honours the Mongolian palaeontologist Rinchen Barsbold, {{the leader of the}} team who found the specimen. In 2005 the describers discovered (after being notified by a biologist) that the name Nemegtia had already been used for a genus of freshwater seed shrimp (Ostracoda) from the same formation in 1978, and was therefore preoccupied. They proposed instead the new genus name Nemegtomaia ("maia" [...] means [...] "good mother" [...] in Greek, and the full name means [...] "good mother of the Nemegt"), making reference to the then-recent discovery that oviraptorids brooded eggs rather than stealing them, though no trace of a nest or eggs had yet been found associated with Nemegtomaia itself. The first known member of the oviraptorid family was found with a <b>nest</b> <b>of</b> <b>eggs</b> originally thought to have belonged to the ceratopsian genus Protoceratops, and was therefore named Oviraptor in 1924; this name means [...] "egg-seizer". In the 1990s more oviraptorid specimens were discovered associated with nests and eggs, wherein oviraptorid embryos were found, thereby proving that the eggs belonged to the oviraptorids themselves. Ingenia was similarly renamed as Ajancingenia in 2013, since the former genus name was preoccupied by a roundworm (Nematoda).|$|E

6000|$|Resuming our road, {{we passed}} the ruins of an [...] "Olako," [...] the khámbí of East Africa, a {{temporary}} encampment, whose few poles were still standing under a shady tree. We then came upon a blockaded lagoon; the sea-water had been imprisoned by a high bank which the waves had washed up, and it will presently be released by storms from the south-west. Near the water, even at half-ebb, we find the floor firm and pleasant; it becomes loose walking at high tide, and the ribbed banks are fatiguing to ascend and descend under a hot sun and in reeking air. A seine would have supplied a man-of-war in a few hours; large turtle is often turned; in places young ones {{about the size of}} a dollar scuttled towards the sea, and Hotaloya brought a <b>nest</b> <b>of</b> <b>eggs,</b> which, however, were too high in flavour for the European palate. The host of crabs lining the water stood alert, watching our approach, and when we came within a hundred yards they hurried sideways into the safer sea--the scene reminded me of the days when, after [...] "tiffin," [...] we used to [...] "már kankrás" [...] on the Clifton Sands in the Unhappy Valley.|$|E

On one {{occasion}} we had a <b>nest</b> <b>of</b> <b>eggs</b> in the field over there, which we had left to be hatched in the natural way by the hen-ostrich. One night it rained very hard--so hard that we feared the young ones would be drowned in the nest, so brother Johnny was sent to look after them. He took two Totties with him. It was very dark, but he found the nest with the cock bird sitting on it. You know the cock always sits at night. Well, Johnny took him by the nose and pulled him off the nest, and gave him to the two Totties to hold. It was hard work, but they kept his head well down, so that he couldn't kick. Johnny soon bagged all the little ones, leaped over the wall, and then called out to let go the cock. It was so dark that he couldn't see very well. He could only hear a scuffle, and then saw the two men bounding over the wall like indiarubber balls while the cock went bang against it like a battering-ram. We got the little ones home all safe, but, would you believe it? these rascally Totties had managed to pull out all the best wing-feathers while they were holding the cock--each feather worth, perhaps, twenty shillings or more--and got clear away with them to the canteen, where they can always sell stolen goods.|$|E

The rooster is polygamous, but cannot guard several <b>nests</b> <b>of</b> <b>eggs</b> at once.

During the daytime, a rooster often sits on a high perch, usually 3 to 5 ft off the ground, {{to serve as a}} lookout for his group (hence the term [...] "rooster"). He sounds a distinctive alarm call if predators are nearby.|$|R
