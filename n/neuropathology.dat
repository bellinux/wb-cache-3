5|$|After {{returning}} from Germany, Southard interned in pathology at Boston City Hospital {{and became an}} instructor at Harvard Medical School in 1904. From 1906 to 1909, he was an assistant pathologist at Danvers State Hospital. Southard was named assistant {{professor of psychology at}} Harvard University and Bullard Professor of <b>Neuropathology</b> at Harvard Medical School in 1909, titles he held until his death. That year, he also became a pathologist for the Massachusetts Commission on Mental Diseases.|$|E
5|$|At Danvers State Hospital Southard met Myrtelle Canavan, {{with whom}} he worked and {{published}} in <b>neuropathology</b> {{for the next few}} years. When Canavan received a tempting job offer from the Pennsylvania Hospital for the Insane, in his capacity with the Massachusetts Commission on Mental Diseases, Southard petitioned the board to create a position for her as his assistant, and her salary was enough for her to refuse the Pennsylvania offer.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the war, Southard {{returned}} to Boston State Hospital and it was reorganized. He was relieved of his directorship at Boston Psychopathic and named director of the Massachusetts Psychiatric Institute, a unit of Boston Psychopathic. Free of his previous hospital administration duties, Southard was able to concentrate on research. Southard delineated several priorities for his scientific work and writing. He hoped to publish four books; the first would cover observations from his research laboratory made between 1906 and 1919. The second book, on clinical work he had done at Boston Psychopathic since 1912, he hoped would increase enthusiasm for psychiatric hospitals. The third would report on the expansion of psychiatric social work, and the final work (a requirement for his academic post) would be an overview of <b>neuropathology.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Microglia {{are perhaps}} the most underestimated cell type of our immune system. Not only were immunologists unaware of their {{capabilities}} until recently, but also, some neuroscientists denied their actual existence until the late 20 th century. Nowadays, their presence is confirmed extensively, as demonstrated by numerous reports describing their involvement in virtually all <b>neuropathologies.</b> However, despite distinct approaches, their origin remains a point of controversy. Although many agree about their myeloid-monocytic ancestry, the precise progenitor cells and the differentiation mechanisms, which give rise to microglia in the different developmental stages of the CNS, are not unraveled yet. Mostly, this can be attributed to their versatile phenotype. Indeed, microglia show a high morphological plasticity, which is related to their functional state. This review about microglia aims to introduce the reader extensively into their ontogeny, cell biology, and involvement in different <b>neuropathologies.</b> J...|$|R

5|$|For {{most of the}} 20th century, the {{diagnosis}} of Alzheimer's disease was reserved for individuals {{between the ages of}} 45 and 65 who developed symptoms of dementia. The terminology changed after 1977 when a conference on AD concluded that the clinical and pathological manifestations of presenile and senile dementia were almost identical, although the authors also added that this did not {{rule out the possibility that}} they had different causes. This eventually led to {{the diagnosis}} of Alzheimer's disease independent of age. The term senile dementia of the Alzheimer type (SDAT) was used for a time to describe the condition in those over 65, with classical Alzheimer's disease being used to describe those who were younger. Eventually, the term Alzheimer's disease was formally adopted in medical nomenclature to describe individuals of all ages with a characteristic common symptom pattern, disease course, and <b>neuropathology.</b>|$|E

40|$|Fractalkine (CX 3 CL 1) is an {{intriguing}} chemokine that plays {{a central role}} in the nervous system. The expression of CX 3 CL 1 on neurons and of its receptor CX 3 CR 1 on microglia facilitates a privileged interaction, playing important roles in regulating the function and maturation of these cells. CX 3 CL 1 is reported to have neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory activities in several experimental systems and animal models of disease, and its expression correlates with positive outcomes in human <b>neuropathologies.</b> However, a comparable amount of evidence shows that CX 3 CL 1 sustains neuroinflammatory conditions and contributes to neurotoxicity. This review discusses the evidence in favor of the CX 3 CL 1 /CX 3 CR 1 pair being neuroprotective and other evidence that it is neurotoxic.

40|$|Neuroinflammation (NI) is an {{adaptive}} response to different noxious stimuli, involving microglia, astrocytes and peripheral immune cells. NI is {{a hallmark of}} several acute and chronic diseases of central nervous system (CNS) and contributes to both damage and repair of CNS tissue. Interventional or genetically modified rodent models mimicking human <b>neuropathologies</b> may provide valuable insights on basic mechanisms of NI, but also for improving {{the development of new}} diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. Preclinical positron emission tomography (PET) allows to investigate noninvasively the inflammatory response in CNS of rodent models at a molecular level, validating innovative probes for early diagnosis, and characterizing the time course of neuroinflammatory changes and their relationship with disease progression, as well as the effects of experimental treatments with high translational potential. In particular, recent efforts of preclinical PET field are intended to develop specific and selective radiotracers that target the activation of innate immune system in CNS. Here, we have reviewed the state of art for PET in relevant rodent models of acute and chronic <b>neuropathologies</b> associated with NI, with particular regard on imaging of activated microglia and astrocytes...|$|R
40|$|Epidemiological {{studies show}} that {{maternal}} immune activation (MIA) during pregnancy is {{a risk factor for}} autism. However, mechanisms for how MIA affects brain development and behaviors in offspring remain poorly described. To determine whether placental interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) signaling is required for mediating MIA on the offspring, we generated mice with restricted deletion of the receptor for IL- 6 (IL- 6 R_) in placental trophoblasts (Cyp 19 -Cre^(+);Il 6 ra^(fl/fl)), and tested offspring of Cyp 19 -Cre^(+);Il 6 ra^(fl/fl) mothers for immunological, pathological and behavioral abnormalities following induction of MIA. We reveal that MIA results in acute inflammatory responses in the fetal brain. Lack of IL- 6 signaling in trophoblasts effectively blocks MIA-induced inflammatory responses in the placenta and the fetal brain. Furthermore, behavioral abnormalities and cerebellar <b>neuropathologies</b> observed in MIA control offspring are prevented in Cyp 19 -Cre^(+);Il 6 ra^(fl/fl) offspring. Our results demonstrate that IL- 6 activation in placenta is required for relaying inflammatory signals to the fetal brain and impacting behaviors and <b>neuropathologies</b> relevant to neurodevelopmental disease...|$|R
50|$|Epilepsy {{has also}} been linked with polymorphisms in BDNF. Given BDNF's vital role in the {{development}} of the landscape of the brain, there is quite a lot of room for influence on the development of <b>neuropathologies</b> from BDNF. Levels of both BDNF mRNA and BDNF protein are known to be up-regulated in epilepsy. BDNF modulates excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission by inhibiting GABAA-receptor-mediated post-synaptic currents. This provides a potential mechanism for the observed up-regulation.|$|R
25|$|However, {{the link}} between {{dopamine}} and purine synthesis is a nucleotide called guanosine triphosphate or 'GTP'.

Thus a lack of HGPRT may produce a nucleotide deficiency (specifically: GTP deficiency) disorder, resulting in dopamine deficiency.|$|E
25|$|Neurology, psychiatry, neurosurgery, psychosurgery, {{anesthesiology}} {{and pain}} medicine, <b>neuropathology,</b> neuroradiology, ophthalmology, otolaryngology, clinical neurophysiology, addiction medicine, and sleep medicine are some medical specialties that specifically address the {{diseases of the}} nervous system. These terms also refer to clinical disciplines involving {{diagnosis and treatment of}} these diseases. Neurology works with diseases of the central and peripheral nervous systems, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and stroke, and their medical treatment. Psychiatry focuses on affective, behavioral, cognitive, and perceptual disorders. Anesthesiology focuses on perception of pain, and pharmacologic alteration of consciousness. <b>Neuropathology</b> focuses upon the classification and underlying pathogenic mechanisms of central and peripheral nervous system and muscle diseases, with an emphasis on morphologic, microscopic, and chemically observable alterations. Neurosurgery and psychosurgery work primarily with surgical treatment of diseases of the central and peripheral nervous systems. The boundaries between these specialties have been blurring recently as they are all influenced by basic research in neuroscience. Brain imaging also enables objective, biological insights into mental illness, which can lead to faster diagnosis, more accurate prognosis, and help assess patient progress over time.|$|E
25|$|After Sacks {{received}} his medical {{degree from the}} Queen's College, Oxford in 1960, he interned at Middlesex Hospital (part of University College, London) {{before moving to the}} U.S. He then interned at Mount Zion Hospital in San Francisco and completed his residency in neurology and <b>neuropathology</b> at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). He relocated to New York in 1965, where he first worked under a paid fellowship in neurochemistry and <b>neuropathology</b> at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. Upon realising that the neuro-research career he envisioned for himself would be a poor fit, in 1966 he began serving as neurologist at Beth Abraham Hospital's chronic-care facility in the Bronx. While there, he worked with a group of survivors of the 1920s sleeping sickness encephalitis lethargica, who had been unable to move on their own for decades. His treatment of those patients became the basis of his book Awakenings.

25|$|To further sketch psychiatry's {{history shows}} a {{departure}} from structural <b>neuropathology,</b> relying more upon ideology (Sabshin, 1990). A {{good example of this}} is Tourette syndrome, which Ferenczi (1921), although never having seen a patient with Tourette syndrome, suggested was the symbolic expression of masturbation caused by sexual repression. However, starting with the efficacy of neuroleptic drugs in attenuating symptoms (Shapiro, Shapiro and Wayne, 1973) the syndrome has gained pathophysiological support (e.g. Singer, 1997) and is hypothesized to have a genetic basis too, based on its high inheritability (Robertson, 2000). This trend can be seen for many hitherto traditionally psychiatric disorders (see table) and is argued to support reuniting neurology and psychiatry because both are dealing with disorders of the same system.|$|E
25|$|In 1882, Freud {{began his}} medical {{career at the}} Vienna General Hospital.

Over a three-year period, Freud worked in various departments of the hospital. His time spent in Theodor Meynert's psychiatric clinic and as a locum in a local asylum led to an increased interest in clinical work. His substantial body of published research led to his appointment as a university lecturer or docent in <b>neuropathology</b> in 1885, a non-salaried post but one which entitled him to give lectures at the University of Vienna.|$|E
25|$|In late 1924 or 1925, Spielrein left Moscow. She and her {{daughter}} rejoined her husband Pavel in Rostov-on-Don. As well as probably being disillusioned by her experience in Moscow, Spielrein may have been impelled to return because her husband by now was {{in a relationship with}} a Ukrainian woman, Olga Snetkova (born Aksyuk), and they now had a daughter, Nina. Pavel returned to his wife, and their second daughter Eva was born in 1926. For at least the next decade, Spielrein continued to work actively as a pediatrician, carrying out further research, lecturing on psychoanalysis, and publishing in the west until 1931. In 1929 she presented a vigorous defense of Freud and psychoanalysis at a congress of psychiatry and <b>neuropathology</b> in Rostov, possibly the last person to mount such a defense at a time when psychoanalysis was on the point of being proscribed in Russia.|$|E
40|$|TNF-alpha {{expression}} is elevated {{in a variety}} of <b>neuropathologies,</b> including multiple sclerosis, cerebral malaria and HIV encephalitis. However, the consequences of such high cerebral TNF-alpha expression remain unresolved. Here, using MRI, we demonstrate that a focal intrastriatal injection of TNF-alpha causes a significant, acute reduction (15 - 30 %) in cerebral blood volume (CBV), which is dependent on TNF-alpha-type 2 receptor (TNFR 2) activation, and can be ameliorated by pre-treatment with a non-specific endothelin (ET) receptor antagonist. An acute breakdown of the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier (B-CSF-B) and a delayed breakdown of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) were also observed using contrast-enhanced MRI. Furthermore, a significant reduction in tissue water diffusion was apparent 24 h after intrastriatal injection of TNF-alpha injection, which may indicate compromise of tissue energy metabolism. Prolonged expression of endogenous TNF-alpha, achieved through the use of an adenoviral vector expressing TNF-alpha cDNA (Ad 5 TNF-alpha(m)), caused a sustained depression in CBV in accordance with the single TNF-alpha bolus data. These findings identify vasoconstriction, disrupted tissue homeostasis and damage to the BBBs as adverse effects of TNF-alpha within the brain, and suggest that antagonists of the endothelin and TNF-alpha type 2 receptors may be therapeutic in TNF-alpha-associated <b>neuropathologies.</b> <br/...|$|R
