5|$|In 1919, Compton {{was awarded}} {{one of the}} first two <b>National</b> <b>Research</b> Council Fellowships that allowed {{students}} to study abroad.

Further research along these lines led to the discovery of the Compton effect. He used X-rays to investigate ferromagnetism, concluding that it was a result of the alignment of electron spins, and studied cosmic rays, discovering that they were made up principally of positively charged particles.|$|E

5|$|In 1919, Compton {{was awarded}} {{one of the}} first two <b>National</b> <b>Research</b> Council Fellowships that allowed {{students}} to study abroad.

He observed that the scattered rays were more easily absorbed than the original source. Compton was greatly impressed by the Cavendish scientists, especially Ernest Rutherford, Charles Galton Darwin and Arthur Eddington, and he ultimately named his second son after J. J. Thomson.|$|E
5|$|In 1963, Gascoigne {{developed}} a device, {{known as an}} optical corrector plate, which allowed wide field photography on the new 40-inch telescope at Siding Spring.

5|$|Ross married Bertha (Bee) Halley Horecker, a singer-musician and {{daughter}} of Ross's Chicago neighbors, in 1931, received a <b>National</b> <b>Research</b> Council Fellowship for 1932, {{and worked as}} a <b>National</b> <b>Research</b> Council postdoctoral fellow at California Institute of Technology with Eric Temple Bell until 1933. Ross moved back to Chicago and led the mathematics department at an experimental school started by Ph.D.s during the Great Depression, People's Junior College, where he also taught physics. Ross became an assistant professor at St. Louis University in 1935 and stayed for about 11 years. In an interview, he said he advocated for a student who became the first black woman in the South to receive a master's degree in mathematics. This exception led the university to admit black students despite the idea's widespread unpopularity. During World War II, Ross served as a research mathematician for the U.S. Navy. He befriended Hungarian mathematician Gábor Szegő while in St. Louis, who recommended Ross for a 1941 Brown University summer school that prepared young scientists to assist in the war, a program Ross attended. He occasionally worked on proximity fuzes for Stromberg-Carlson's laboratory from 1941 to 1945 before accepting a position as head of University of Notre Dame's mathematics department in 1946. He set out to change the school's research climate by inviting distinguished mathematicians including Paul Erdős, whom Ross made a full professor.|$|E
