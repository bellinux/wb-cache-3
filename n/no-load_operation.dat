40|$|The {{demand on}} {{reducing}} circuit breaker failure, extending service life, increasing equipment reliability and lowering the related operating and maintenance costs are nowadays of prime {{importance for the}} electricity supply network. According to statistics, the major failure mode is originated from operating mechanism, whereas interrupter has {{the highest percentage of}} failure in high voltage component. Thus, the method to facilitate the assessment of internal mechanical conditions by using commercially available devices without opening major parts and the experimental investigation on electrical erosion inside the interrupter were performed in this work. The experimental investigation on the mechanical endurance of operating mechanism up to 6, 000 no-load switching was performed with 110 kV puffer type circuit breakers due to its requirement of large driving energy for hydraulic operating mechanism. The conventional measurement, e. g. coil current, contact timing, dynamic contact resistance and pumping motor current as well as additional vibration technique were carried out in both laboratory and field test. The investigation on electrical erosion focusing on aging of nozzle and electrode under current interruption was performed with a reduced-size SF 6 self-blast circuit breaker model and synthetic test circuit, providing the current density comparable to that in the real circuit breaker, because of the extensive use of nozzle ablation, the possibility for parameters variation and the reduction of cost and time. For mechanical investigation, the parameters were measured at the beginning as a reference and also thereafter every 500 switching under normal and variable operating conditions, e. g. variation of auxiliary supply voltage, hydraulic oil pressure and SF 6 gas pressure. The test result was verified by that from two of the same type circuit breakers and the theoretical calculation for vibration result in the frequency-domain analysis. Subsequently, the on-site measurement before and after maintenance and some simulated defects were executed. The electrical aging investigation was performed by successive tests with constant energy stresses until interrupting failure occurred. The effect of current amplitude, nozzle diameter, expansion volume, arcing time and recovery voltage on mass losses, geometry changes of nozzle and its influence on pressure build-up were investigated. The analysis of vibration signals in a combination with the other supervised parameters provides the useful information regarding the significant events occurring inside during circuit breaker operation, e. g. motion start of mechanism and within pole, contact touching and motion stop. The deviations of these measured values from the reference according to number of <b>no-load</b> switching <b>operations,</b> variable operating conditions and some incorporated defects were comprehensively determined. The relationship between the gradual changes in technical status of the supervised components and the number of <b>no-load</b> <b>operations</b> is helpful for selecting the proper maintenance method. Regarding the electrical erosion of the nozzle and the electrodes, the mass losses per switching and per energy; and the geometry change of nozzle especially between the arcing column and the expansion chamber were investigated. Moreover, volume loss and mass loss along the nozzle column; its effect on the pressure build-up reduction; and the dependences of mass losses on interrupting current amplitude, charge and generated heat have been determined. Furthermore by applying the wear equivalent law, the allowable number of interruption in function of the breaking current to rated short-circuit current ratio and the remaining lifetime can be determined. This result will be used to verify the accuracy of simulation tools in order to visualize the aging process, to evaluate the interrupter condition and to minimize the expensive experiment tests...|$|R

40|$|At the University of Twente, a fetal {{heart monitor}} {{based on a}} high-TC SQUID {{magnetometer}} system is under development. The purpose of this system is to measure a fetal heart signal in a clin. environment. For cooling a first demonstrator version, a closed-cycle Joule-Thomson cooler from APD Cryogenics - the Cryotiger? - was selected. In this work, the Cryotiger is characterised with respect to three noise generating mechanisms: electromagnetic interference, mech. vibrations and temp. fluctuations. The electromagnetic interference of the cold tip was below the resoln. of our 3 -axis fluxgate magnetometer (7 pT/?Hz). The interference from the compressor, however, requires it to be placed 2 m or more from the sensor head {{in order to remain}} below the environmental power line disturbances. As mech. vibrations of a magnetometer in a background field - the earth magnetic field - will result in an apparent field at the frequency of vibration, we require the rotation of the cold tip to remain below 200 micro rad in the frequency band of interest (0. 5 - 100 Hz). This was checked by applying a magnetic field to a SQUID magnetometer mounted on the cooler's cold tip. In this way, rotations of 3 micro rad and translations of 40 nm of the Cryotiger were measured; both at a frequency of 49 Hz.

40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} the {{computation}} of eddy-current losses in the end regions of synchronous machines. Various magnetic and electric vector potential formulations of three-dimensional eddy-current problems are investigated. The equations are discretized by the finite element method with nodal or edge finite elements. Special attention is given to modeling the windings of electrical machines and their contribution to the magnetic field. Two benchmark problems are {{used to compare the}} different formulations and finite elements. Hexahedral edge finite elements give more accurate results for a given discretization than nodal finite elements and allow for a reduction of the computational effort necessary to achieve a given accuracy.

40|$|Permanent magnet {{generators}} (PMG) {{represent the}} cutting edge technology in modern wind mills. The efficiency remains high (over 90 %) at partial loads. To improve the machine efficiency even further, every aspect of machine losses has to be analyzed. Additional losses are often given as a certain percentage without providing any detailed information about the actual calculation process; meanwhile, there are many design-dependent losses that {{have an effect on}} the total amount of additional losses and that have to be taken into consideration. Additional losses are most often eddy current losses in different parts of the machine. These losses are usually difficult to calculate in the design process. In this doctoral thesis, some additional losses are identified and modeled. Further, suggestions on how to minimize the losses are given. Iron losses can differ significantly between the measured no-load values and the loss values under load. In addition, with embedded magnet rotors, the quadrature-axis armature reaction adds losses to the stator iron by manipulating the harmonic content of the flux. It was, therefore, re-evaluated that in salient pole machines, to minimize the losses and the loss difference between the <b>no-load</b> and load <b>operation,</b> the flux density has to be kept below 1. 5 T in the stator yoke, which is the traditional guideline for machine designers. Eddy current losses may occur in the end-winding area and in the support structure of the machine, that is, in the finger plate and the clamping ring. With construction steel, these losses account for 0. 08 % of the input power of the machine. These losses can be reduced almost to zero by using nonmagnetic stainless steel. In addition, the machine housing may be subjected to eddy current losses if the flux density exceeds 1. 5 T in the stator yoke. Winding losses can rise rapidly when high frequencies and 10 – 15 mm high conductors are used. In general, minimizing the winding losses is simple. For example, it can be done by dividing the conductor into transposed subconductors. However, this comes with the expense of an increase in the DC resistance. In the doctoral thesis, a new method is presented to minimize the winding losses by applying a litz wire with noninsulated strands. The construction is the same as in a normal litz wire but the insulation between the subconductors has been left out. The idea is that the connection is kept weak to prevent harmful eddy currents from flowing. Moreover, the analytical solution for calculating the AC resistance factor of the litz-wire is supplemented by including an end-winding resistance in the analytical solution. A simple measurement device is developed to measure the AC resistance in the windings. In the case of a litz-wire with originally noninsulated strands, vacuum pressure impregnation (VPI) is used to insulate the subconductors. In one of the two cases studied, the VPI affected the AC resistance factor, but in the other case, it did not have any effect. However, more research is needed to determine the effect of the VPI on litz-wire with noninsulated strands. An empirical model is developed to calculate the AC resistance factor of a single-layer formwound winding. The model includes the end-winding length and the number of strands and turns. The end winding includes the circulating current (eddy currents that are traveling through the whole winding between parallel strands) and the main current. The end-winding length also affects the total AC resistance factor...|$|R

In particular, HVDC-connected Offshore Wind Power Plants (OWPPs) are emerging as an economical solution for long distances from the shore. This thesis was focused on three key areas related to planning, operation and stability issues, which are present technical challenges in the integration of OWPPs through VSC-HVDC transmission systems. In relation to planning, the installation of interlink cables between OWPPs was analysed to increase the wind power transfer. Different interlink options were compared based on a power loss reduction and an increase of availability. In general, it was recommended to have interlinks close to the wind generation point to provide more flexible active power sharing between OWPPs. Also, a cost-benefit analysis was used to quantify savings from the operation with interlinks and a design procedure was developed to determine the interlink cable capacity. In terms of operation, inertia emulation was analysed as a potential fast frequency response service from OWPPs. Synthetic inertia and temporary overproduction have been presented as main control strategies to implement inertia emulation and they were compared using MATLAB Simulink. Results showed similar frequency response performance from both strategies, however temporary overproduction was more appropriate in order to comply with system operator’s requirements. Emulation of inertia was also demonstrated in a HVDC-connected OWPP employing a hardware-in-the-loop set-up. The converter control interaction with electrical resonances of the offshore ac grid was analysed. An impedance-based representation of the system was used to identify resonant frequencies and to assess stability. A reformulation of the positive-net-damping criterion was used to evaluate the effect that the offshore HVDC converter control and OWPP configuration have on the stability.

40|$|Modern {{electrical}} rail vehicles employ four-quadrant {{voltage source}} converters, which allow independent control of real and reactive power. This thesis focuses {{the control of}} reactive power at the vehicle regarding load flow and stability. Settings for power factor {{as a function of}} voltage were proposed in a project fall 2010, aiming to reduce line loss and increase transmission capacity. This thesis is mainly a further investigation of some of the settings proposed. One of the proposed settings for controlling reactive power is found to reduce the load of a rotary converter station in the range of 0 - 3 %. Total system losses are reduced by 0. 21 - 0. 33 %. During traction, the problematic issue regarding stability is found to be speed oscillations of the rotary converter. Controlling reactive power is found to have a limited damping effect on speed oscillations of a rotary converter. Other works have investigated how speed oscillations of the rotary converter can be damped by controlling the real power of the vehicle; the real power control is found to have a clearly better effect than reactive. During <b>no-load</b> <b>operation,</b> the problematic issue regarding stability is found to be oscillations caused by the vehicle and its control system. The vehicle control system and its response to the line voltage may cause instability, especially at long line lengths, regardless of any rotary converter. As reactive power has a significant effect on the line voltage, reactive power may be controlled in a manner increasing the damping of such oscillations significantly. Finally the thesis describes how a simulation model of a modern electrical rail vehicle for stability analysis can be made from the steady state characteristics and the input admittance of the vehicle, without knowing the complete vehicle model.

Reluktančni navor omogoča vrtenje rotorja v sinhronizmu z glavnim vrtilnim poljem. Pri takšnem načinu delovanja (sinhronsko vrtenje) je v rotorju gostota magnetnega pretoka vedno enosmerna, kar narekuje brezizguben rotor. Vendar imamo zaradi statorskih utorov spremembo magnetne upornosti zračne reže, kar pri vrtenju povzroči utorske pulzacije magnetnega polja in s tem površinske izgube na rotorju. Na podlagi temeljnih elektromagnetnih zakonitosti smo izpeljali enačbo in z njo ovrednotili površinske izgube na rotorju motorja. Z obremenilnim preizkusom in preskusom prostega teka smo analizirali obratovalne karakteristike in izgube motorja. Kot posledico izgub smo nastalo temperaturno polje v motorju in na njem prikazali v obliki temperaturne slike. The aim of {{this paper}} is to present power losses in {{synchronous}} reluctance motors (SRM). Generally speaking, this type of motors is an unexcited synchronous machine with stator windings and a stator similar to any regular induction machine. The rotor is cross-laminated and contains flux barriers placed equidistantly around the air gap (Fig. 1). They serve to diminish the quadrature (q-axis) flux flowing between poles and at the same time they permit the direct axis flux to flow largely unimpeded through the poles. On the basis of the Parkćs theory, an impedance model of SRM for stationary operating modes is presented in a matrix form (Eq. 1). Further, the paper devotes special attention to surface power losses. The main flux of synchronous reluctance motors rotates at the same speed as the rotor. The presence of the stator openings gives rise to permeance variations causing a ripple in the main flux (Fig. 2) through which the rotor is driven and resulting in induced losses on the rotor surface. The same is going on on the stator surface due to the permeance variations in the rotor slot opening range. At normal tooth ripple frequencies, only eddy current components of these losses are of any significance and histeresis losses may be ignored. Eqs. (2 - 5) describe the magnetic flux density distribution and penetration into the rotor. Fundamental electromagnetic equtions (6 - 8) are used to calculate the eddy current distribution (Eq. 9) on a thin surface layer of a laminated rotor. Surface losses are calculated with Eq. 10 and presented in Figs. (3 - 4). The measured torque and current characteristics of SRM for asynchronous run are shown in Fig. 5. and for synchronous run in Fig. 7. The principle of the rotor load angle measurement is given in Fig. 6. No-load characteristics of SRM and power losses separation are presented in Fig. 8. Power losses at <b>no-load</b> <b>operation</b> of the measured prototype are separated and given in Table 1. To establish the surface losses impact on rotor temperature variations the temperature measurements (Fig. 9) were made. They are presentedin Table 2. Temperature variations for the SRM stator winding at a nominal load are given in Fig. 11...|$|E
40|$|For {{the design}} of an {{electric}} power system, knowledge of the parameters of all the components is essential. Especially the transformers {{are an important part}} of this. It is therefore important that the measurement equipment for determining these values is accurate. In <b>no-load</b> <b>operation,</b> the transformer mainly consumes reactive power. A small error in the measurement of the power angle therefore gives a large error in the active power calculation. The Technical Research Institute of Sweden, SP, performs calibrations of these measurement systems. Calibrations are done by measuring a reference voltage and generating a current in a secondary circuit with a controllable phase shift. The voltage and current make up a virtual power and are measured by the reference instrument and by the equipment to be calibrated. This thesis describes the work of constructing a single-phase full-bridge converter for inverter operation with accurate phase control of the current in the secondary circuit relative to the sinusoidal reference voltage. A CompactRIO™ system from National Instruments is used to control the converter through pulse-width modulation (PWM). An analogueto- digital converter (ADC) module is used to sample the reference signal and a digital I/O module outputs the PWM signals. A phase-locked loop (PLL) algorithm estimates the phase of the sampled reference voltage to use in the generation of the PWM signals. Three different PLLs have been implemented with LabVIEW™ code on the FPGA chip of the CompactRIO™ system. The three PLLs are the inverse Park PLL (IP-PLL) based on the synchronous reference frame, the enhanced PLL (E-PLL) based on the gradient descent method and the KF-PLL based on the Kalman filter. Both the E-PLL and the KF-PLL are also based on models for estimating specific signal components. With the basic configurations, the IP-PLL shows superior performance in simulations with dc offset and low-order harmonic in the input signal. This is due to its low-pass filters. While the standard deviation in the phase error of the IP-PLL was 50 rad it was 350 rad for the E-PLL and 570 rad for the KF-PLL with a dc offset at 1. 8 % of the fundamental amplitude in the input signal. With a third harmonic at 10 % of the fundamental amplitude, the standard deviations of the phase errors were 50. 3 rad, 776 rad and 889 rad for the IP-PLL, the E-PLL and the KF-PLL respectively. By extending the E-PLL and the KF-PLL to include estimation of dc-offset and harmonics, these steady-state errors are completely eliminated. However, especially the KF-PLL but also the E-PLL, is much more complex and harder to tune than the IP-PLL. When implemented on CompactRIO™ the KF-PLL including estimation of dc offset got the best results with a standard deviation in the phase error of 5. 1 rad compared to 49. 2 rad for the IP-PLL with minimized cut-off frequency iii of the low-pass filters for a dc offset of 0. 41 % of the fundamental amplitude in the input signal. It is shown that the phase error of the complete system can be kept below a standard deviation of 600 rad, with a stable reference voltage. The pattern of the phase error however has an oscillatory shape with a frequency of about 0. 12 Hz. This is thought to originate from a drift in the clock of the ADC module relative to the clock of the FPGA in the CompactRIO™ system. This must be further investigated. Additionally, the amplitude accuracy of the fundamental frequency is found to have a standard deviation of about 63 ppm, with a dc-source specified to be accurate to 50 ppm...|$|E

Podana je primedava izmerjenih in izračunanih tokov, in sicer tako za primer brez kot tudi z upoštevanjem vrtinčnih izgub. The paper deals with, a magnetically {{nonlinear}} {{dynamic model}} of a single-phase transformer where the effects of dynamic hysteresis losses and iron core losses to {{be accounted for by}} a simplified method. The existing simplified method [4] for considering dynamic iron core losses in the form of magnetizing curve B(H), displaced to the left and to the right by factor Hhist (22), is modified. It is now suitable to be used when the magnetizing curve of the iron-core material is not available, while the magnetically nonlinear characteristic y(i) of the entire device can be determined experimentally [7]. The characteristic y(i) can be given {{in the form of an}} approximation polynomial or in the form of a look-up table. A schematic presentation of the discussed single-phase transformer is shown in Figure 1. It is used as a basis for two different circuit models presented in sections 2. 1 and 2. 2. The first circuit model with neglected eddy-current losses is shown in Figure 2, while the second circuit model with the eddy-current losses are accounted for by the resistor RFo is shown in Figure 3. The corresponding magnetically nonlinear single-phase transformer dynamic models is given by sets of equations (1) to (11) and (12) to (20). In the first model, only the hysteresis losses can be accounted for while the second one can handle hysteresis and eddy current losses. Both models are completed by magnetically nonlinear characteristic y(i) of the tested transformer. Section 3 describes how the hysteresis losses can be accounted for by shifting an unique magnetically nonlinear iron - core characteristic given in the form of the magnetizing curve B(H) to the left and to the right by factor Hhist. The complete approach is explained in Figure 4 where fo denotes the unique characteristic B(H). Factor Hhist (22) is defined by the hysteresis factor Khist, actual flux density B and flux density in the last turning point Brev. Equations (23) to (25) show, how partial derivatives a&ao, needed in dynamic models (equations sets (1) -(1 1) and (12) -(20)), can be determined from characteristic B(H). Expressions (26) and (27) are used to determine characteristic VI(i) from the measured applied voltage and corresponding current under transformer <b>no-load</b> <b>operation.</b> Figure 5 shows a set of characteristics VI(i) in the form of hysteresis loops determined for different amplitudes of the applied voltage. The unique characteristic y(i) used in calculations is given by end points of individual hysteresis loops. Equations (28) to (31) are used to determine magnetic reluctances Rm or partial derivatives Mao from the end points of the individual hysteresis loops shown in Figure 5. Figure 6 shows the measured hysteresis loop a), unique y(i) characteristic b) and approximation of the hysteresis loop used to account for hysteresis losses c). A corresponding comparison of the measured and calculated currents is shown in Figure 7. Figure 8 shows that a better agreement the between measured and calculated currents can be achieved if hysteresis losses are accounted for in the transformer dynamic model together with the eddy-current losses...|$|E
