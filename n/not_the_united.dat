25|$|Ironically, {{considering}} O'Connell's {{dedication to}} peaceful methods of political agitation, his greatest political achievement {{ushered in a}} period of violence in Ireland. There was an obligation for those working the land to support the established Church (i.e., the United Church of England and Ireland) by payments known as tithes.

25|$|Informally, a {{national}} recession {{is a period}} of declining economic output. In a 1974 New York Times article, Julius Shiskin suggested several rules of thumb to identify a recession, which included two successive quarterly declines in gross domestic product (GDP), a measure of the nation's output. This two-quarter metric is now a commonly held definition of a recession. In the United States, the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) is regarded as the authority which identifies a recession and which takes into account several measures in addition to GDP growth before making an assessment. In many developed nations (but <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States), the two-quarter rule is also used for identifying a recession.|$|E

He branded himself as a reliant conservative whose campaign was [...] "looking good" [...] due to the base he was attempting to establish in Iowa. The state would hold the nation's first presidential caucus in January 2008. His entrance into the race slightly increased voter's recognition of [...] "Thompson" [...] in polls but pollsters stated that this increase was most likely attributed to the exposure of potential candidate Fred Thompson. He remained at 2% in presidential polls, in sixth place overall behind potential candidates Newt Gingrich and Fred Thompson, but ahead of declared candidates Ron Paul, Jim Gilmore, Tom Tancredo, Sam Brownback, Duncan Hunter and Mike Huckabee. Statewide polls placed Thompson at 24% {{in his home state}} of Wisconsin, which was considerably higher than the marks achieved by other lower tiered candidates in their home states. [...] Upon his entrance, the candidate set forth his position on the War in Iraq, holding that as president, he would allow Iraqis to vote on whether or <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States military should remain in the nation. He stated that if the Iraqis [...] "don't want us there...we should get out." ...|$|E

[...] In an effort to argue against the Supreme Court having jurisdiction over the proceedings, the defendant filed a petition seeking a writ of certiorari. [...] This request for judicial review, upon writ of error, was denied. [...] The court held that a conviction for murder, punishable with death, was no less a conviction for a capital crime by reason even taking into account the fact that the jury qualified the punishment. [...] The American Indian defendant was sentenced to life in prison.|$|E
2500|$|Nicaraguan {{migration}} to Costa Rica has occurred since the mid-19th century.

An estimated 10% [...] (400,000 - 600,000) of the Costa Rican population {{is made up}} of Nicaraguans; some of them migrate for seasonal work opportunities and then return to their country. Costa Rica and Nicaragua signed an agreement regulating seasonal migration in 1998; it allows Nicaraguans with work permits to enter Costa Rica at the western border at Peñas Blancas on the Pan-American Highway.
