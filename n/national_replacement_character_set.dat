5000|$|Code page 1011, {{also known}} as CP1011 (IBM), CP20106 (Microsoft) and D7DEC (Oracle) is the German version (...) of ISO/IEC 646. It {{is also part of}} DEC's <b>National</b> <b>Replacement</b> <b>Character</b> <b>Set</b> (NRCS) for their VT220 terminals.|$|E
50|$|Like the VT200's, the VT300's {{included}} {{a number of}} alternate <b>character</b> <b>sets</b> for various international uses and basic form graphics. The system shipped with five <b>sets</b> of 94 <b>characters,</b> {{as well as a}} single set with 96 graphics <b>characters.</b> The <b>sets</b> were ASCII, ISO Latin and three graphics <b>character</b> <b>sets.</b> Using sixels, any one of these sets could be replaced with user-generated characters. The system also included DEC's unique <b>National</b> <b>Replacement</b> <b>Character</b> <b>Sets</b> that allowed single <b>characters</b> in a <b>set</b> to be swapped out to match the layout of a keyboard. For instance, in the UK the # symbol could be swapped out for the £, eliminating the need for custom versions of the terminal for each country. It supported the full range of ANSI escape codes, although some sources state it did not decode standard color sequences even on the VT340.|$|R
50|$|The Unicode Security Considerations report {{recommends}} {{this character}} {{as a safe}} <b>replacement</b> for unmappable <b>characters</b> during <b>character</b> <b>set</b> conversion.|$|R
2500|$|In many web browsers {{and other}} {{computer}} programs, when converting text between encodings, {{it may not}} be possible to map some characters into the target <b>character</b> <b>set.</b> In this situation it is common to replace each unmappable character with a question mark [...] "?", inverted question mark [...] "¿", or the Unicode <b>replacement</b> <b>character</b> [...] "�" [...] (U+FFFD, usually rendered as a white question mark in a black diamond). This commonly occurs for apostrophes and quotation marks when they are written with software that uses its own proprietary non-standard code for these characters, such as Microsoft's Smart Quotes.|$|R
5000|$|The Multinational Character Set (DMCS or MCS) is a {{character}} encoding created in 1983 by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) {{for use in the}} popular VT220 terminal. It was an 8-bit extension of ASCII that added accented characters, currency symbols, and other character glyphs missing from 7-bit ASCII. It {{is only one of the}} code pages implemented for the VT220 <b>National</b> <b>Replacement</b> <b>Character</b> <b>Set</b> (NRCS). MCS is registered as IBM code page 1100 (Multinational Emulation) since 1992. Depending on associated sorting Oracle calls it WE8DEC, N8DEC, DK8DEC, S8DEC, or SF8DEC. Such [...] "extended ASCII" [...] sets were common (the <b>National</b> <b>Replacement</b> <b>Character</b> <b>Set</b> provided sets for more than a dozen European languages), but MCS has the distinction of being the ancestor of ECMA-94 in 1985 and ISO 8859-1 in 1987.|$|E
50|$|Code page 1012, {{also known}} as CP1012 or I7DEC, is IBM's code page for the Italian version of ISO 646, {{also known as}} ISO 646-IT IR 15. The {{character}} set was originally specified in UNI 0204-70. It {{is also part of}} DEC's <b>National</b> <b>Replacement</b> <b>Character</b> <b>Set</b> (NRCS) for their VT220 terminals.|$|E
50|$|Code page 1020, {{also known}} as CP1020, is an IBM code page number {{assigned}} to the French-Canadian variant of DEC's <b>National</b> <b>Replacement</b> <b>Character</b> <b>Set</b> (NRCS). The 7-bit character set was introduced for DEC's computer terminal systems, starting with the VT200 series in 1983, but is also used by IBM for their DEC emulation. Similar but not identical to the series of ISO 646 character sets, the character set is a close derivation from ASCII with only ten code points differing.|$|E

50|$|HP {{developed}} {{a series of}} Symbol Sets (each with its associated Symbol Set Code) to encode either its own <b>character</b> <b>sets</b> or other vendors’ <b>character</b> <b>sets.</b> They are normally 7-bit <b>character</b> <b>sets</b> which, when moved to the higher part and associated with the ASCII <b>character</b> <b>set,</b> make up 8-bit <b>character</b> <b>sets.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{character}} {{after the}} [...] (for single-byte <b>character</b> <b>sets)</b> or [...] (for multi-byte <b>character</b> <b>sets)</b> specifies {{the type of}} <b>character</b> <b>set</b> and working set that is designated to. In the above examples, the character [...] (0x28) designates a 94-character set to the G0 <b>character</b> <b>set.</b> This may be replaced by , [...] or [...] (0x29-0x2B) to designate to the G1-G3 <b>character</b> <b>sets.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The VT420 had a {{total of}} 5 sets of 94 {{characters}} for normal VT operation, another 3 sets of 128 PC characters, and 1 set of 96 characters containing various graphics and math symbols. Like all models since the VT200 series, the user could also upload a custom character set of their own design using the Sixel system. Likewise, it also supported the <b>National</b> <b>Replacement</b> <b>Character</b> <b>Set</b> system, which swapped out single characters in 7-bit modes to allow basic changes like swapping the [...] for the [...] for use on UK systems.|$|E
50|$|The VT200s {{included}} {{the ability to}} make minor changes to the character set using the <b>National</b> <b>Replacement</b> <b>Character</b> <b>Set</b> (NRCS) concept. When operating on an 8-bit clean link up to 256 character codes were available, which included a full set of European characters. But when operating on a typical 7-bit link, only 128 were available, and only 96 of these produced display output as the rest were control characters. This was not enough characters to handle all European languages. Most terminals solved this by shipping multiple complete character sets in ROM, but there was a cost in doing so.|$|E
50|$|The <b>National</b> <b>Replacement</b> <b>Character</b> <b>Set,</b> or NRCS for short, was {{a feature}} {{supported}} by later models of Digital's (DEC) computer terminal systems, {{starting with the}} VT200 series in 1983. NRCS allowed individual characters from one character set {{to be replaced by}} one from another set, allowing the construction of different character sets on the fly. It was used to customize the character set to different local languages, without having to change the terminal's ROM for different counties, or alternately, include many different sets in a larger ROM. Many 3rd party terminals and terminal emulators supporting VT200 codes also supported NRCS.|$|E

5000|$|Like {{all models}} of the VT series, the VT500's primary purpose is {{to act as an}} ANSI {{standard}} terminal. The VT510 supported only a single session, while the 520 and 525 supported up to four sessions, up from two in the earlier VT series. The user can flip between the sessions using control sequences on the keyboard (typically [...] ), or display multiple sessions at the same time by splitting the screen horizontally or vertically. All models have multiple character sets in ROM, supporting DEC, international and PC characters. They can also replace any of these by downloading custom characters using sixels, and perform single-character swaps using the <b>National</b> <b>Replacement</b> <b>Character</b> <b>Set,</b> swapping [...] with [...] for use with UK keyboards for instance.|$|E

In the <b>character</b> <b>sets</b> that allocate ASMO 449 (or some variant of it) {{in the upper}} part of the 8-bit <b>character</b> <b>set,</b> the existence of apparently repeated characters is due to the fact that the characters in the lower part are for left-to-right script while the characters in the upper part are for right-to-left script.
