40|$|Background: Ventilator {{dependency}} following {{coronary artery}} bypass grafting (CABG) {{is often associated with}} significant morbidity and mortality. However, few reports have focused on the independent risk factors <b>for</b> <b>ventilator</b> dependency following CABG. This study aimed to evaluate the independent risk factors <b>for</b> <b>ventilator</b> dependency following {{coronary artery bypass}} grafting (CABG). Methods: The relevant pre-, intra- and post-operative data of patients without a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease undergoing isolated CABG from January 2003 to December 2008 in our center were retrospectively analyzed. Elapsed time between CABG and extubation of more than 48 hours was defined as postoperative ventilator dependency (PVD). Results: The incidence of PVD was 13. 8 % (81 / 588). The in-hospital mortality in the PVD group was significantly higher than that in the non-PVD group (8. 6 % versus 2. 4 %, p= 0. 0092). Besides the length of ICU and hospital stay, PVD correlated with negative respiratory outcomes. The independent risk factors for PVD were preoperative congestive heart failure (OR= 2. 456, 95 %CI 1. 426 - 6. 879), preoperative hypoalbuminemia (OR= 1. 353, 95 %CI 1. 125 - 3. 232), preoperative arterial oxygen partial pressure (PO 2) (OR= 0. 462, 95 %CI 0. 235 - 0. 783) and postoperative anaemia (OR= 1. 541, 95 %CI 1. 231 - 3. 783). Conclusions: Preoperative congestive heart failure, preoperative hypoalbuminemia, low preoperative PO 2 and postoperative anaemia were identified as four independent risk factors <b>for</b> <b>ventilator</b> dependency following CABG. </p...|$|R

From May-December 1999, all patients attending one of the 27 participating chest clinics throughout Italy and who were or had been using a home nebulizer in the previous 6 months were consecutively enrolled. All patients completed a self-administered questionnaire on their current practices of home nebulization. Of the 1, 721 questionnaires delivered, 1, 257 were returned with an overall response rate of 73 %.

40|$|SummaryBackgroundNoninvasive {{mechanical}} ventilation {{is being used}} up to continuously by patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Invasive and noninvasive tests are used to assess ventilatory function but there are few reports relating them to extent of <b>ventilator</b> dependence <b>for</b> which simple and cost effective parameters are needed. ObjectiveTo investigate the relative efficacy of noninvasive lung function parameters for determining extent of need <b>for</b> <b>ventilator</b> use. Materials and methods 83 DMD patients were divided into three groups: no ventilator use (asymptomatic) (n =  26) [Group 1], nocturnal ventilator use (symptomatic) (n =  20) [Group 2], and full-time ventilator dependence (n =  37) [Group 3]. Tidal volume (TV), vital capacity (VC), respiratory rate (RR), inspiratory time (Ti), respiratory cycle time (Ttot), rapid shallow breathing index (RSBI [RR/TV]), breathing intolerance index (BITI), ventilator requirement index (VRI) and a new parameter RR/VC were monitored and compared. Data were analyzed with receiver-operating-characteristic curves (ROC) and the area under the curve (AUC) was calculated. ResultsIn group 2 and 3, patients used NIV for 3. 3  ±  2. 1 and 11. 2  ±  4. 7 years, respectively. By ROC comparison, RR/VC (RR/VC ≥  0. 024 [AUC, 0. 921] and ≥ 0. 071 [AUC, 0. 935]), RR/TV (RR/TV ≥  0. 024 [AUC, 0. 905] and ≥ 0. 153 [AUC, 0. 905]), and VC (VC ≤  770  ml [AUC, 0. 896] and ≤ 370  ml [AUC, 0. 898]) represented to introduce nocturnal and continuous ventilator use, respectively. TV/VC, BITI, and VRI were either less sensitive or less specific. ConclusionsLung function parameters including RR/VC, RR/TV, and VC are useful and inexpensive in predicting the extent of need <b>for</b> <b>ventilator</b> use. Overall, RR/VC is the most appropriate predictor for determining extent of need <b>for</b> <b>ventilator</b> use...|$|R
