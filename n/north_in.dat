5|$|A {{low-pressure}} area {{developed into}} a weak tropical depression on September24 off the north coast of Honduras in the western Caribbean Sea. It was initially disorganized, without a well-developed circulation. On September25, while still a tropical depression, the system was named Debbie. Without intensifying further, the depression crossed the northeastern Yucatán Peninsula on September26. The next day, the depression turned toward the <b>north</b> <b>in</b> the central Gulf of Mexico before beginning a northeast motion. On September28, Debbie intensified into a tropical storm, attaining peak winds of 50mph (85km/h). This occurred after the storm developed two distinct spiral rainbands.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{developed into}} Tropical Depression Six {{while it was}} centered about 1,150miles (1,850km) east of the southernmost Lesser Antilles on September3. Later that day, the depression intensified enough to be upgraded to Tropical Storm Erika. It moved west-northwestward and steadily intensified to attain hurricane status on September4. Erika passed a short distance {{to the north of}} the Lesser Antilles, and later turned to the <b>north</b> <b>in</b> response to an approaching trough. The hurricane quickly strengthen to reach peak winds of 125mph (195km/h) on September8, and after maintaining peak strength for 24hours Erika weakened over cooler waters. It turned to the east, weakened to a tropical storm, and became extratropical after passing near the Azores on September15.|$|E

5|$|After leaving Mount Vision, the two roads {{parallel}} {{each other}} {{into the town}} of Hartwick, where both intersect with another highway crossing Otego Creek, CR11D. The roads enter the hamlet of Jones Crossing, intersecting with another crossroad, the locally maintained Jones Crossing Road. In the rural backdrop north of Jones Crossing, NY205 intersects with CR45's western terminus. The parallel alignments of NY205 and CR11 end a short distance to the <b>north</b> <b>in</b> the hamlet of Hartwick as CR11 enters the community on the east–west Main Street and intersects NY205 in the hamlet's center. CR11 leaves NY205 for good outside of Hartwick, continuing on a generally easterly track toward Cooperstown, while NY205 passes Hartwick Town Park and crosses over Otego Creek as it heads northward into the town of Otsego.|$|E
5|$|After {{several hundred}} years of no {{permanent}} habitation, the second wave of migration arrived from Canada, bringing the Dorset people to western Greenland. The first wave of immigrants, known as Dorset I, arrived around 500 BCE, inhabiting the region for the next 700 years. The early Dorset people were followed later by the Dorset II people, although no artifacts have been discovered from the later era around Sisimiut, and few artifacts from the era of Dorset I have been uncovered in archaeological sites, with the finds often limited to harpoon heads and numerous animal bones. The largest number of Dorset culture artifacts can be found further <b>north</b> <b>in</b> the Disko Bay region, while the further to the south, the poorer the finds, disappearing completely {{on the coast of}} Labrador Sea in southwestern Greenland.|$|E
5|$|After the Klondike Gold Rush, {{the mounted}} police {{continued}} to spread their network of posts across the far <b>north.</b> <b>In</b> 1903, a small team of police under Inspector Charles Constantine {{were sent to}} Herschel Island to investigate the alleged sexual mistreatment of Inuit women by the transient whaling community there; the decision was also driven by fears that the United States might try to assert sovereignty over the wider Mackenzie Delta. The police {{found no evidence of}} sexual abuse, but took the opportunity to collect customs duties and to attempt to clamp down on liquor sales to the indigenous community. The same year, a well-publicised Canadian expedition was sent to Hudson Bay on the schooner SS Neptune, including Superintendent John Moodie and a small team of mounted police.|$|E
