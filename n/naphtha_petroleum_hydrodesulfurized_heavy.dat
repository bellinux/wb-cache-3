40|$|Substitution of {{hazardous}} substances against less hazardous ones {{is a central}} requirement of the European Chemical Regulation REACH (European Regulation 1907 / 2006 /EC). Hazardous substances emitted from products may not only affect the worker; drift off and distribution in the environment may finally result in exposure of the general population. This potential threat to health is covered by the impact category “toxicity” in Life Cycle Assessments. In this paper, we present {{a case of a}} substitution of volatile organic compounds in a reactive varnish, and compare the “old” formulation with the “new” formulation against health risk to the worker, and concerning the Life Cycle Assessment impact category “toxicity”. The “old” formulation contained <b>Naphtha</b> (<b>petroleum),</b> <b>hydrodesulfurized,</b> <b>heavy</b> and Solvent naphtha (petroleum), light, aromatic. In the new formulation, both naphthas were replaced by n-Butylacetate, 1 -Ethoxy- 2 -propyl acetate and Ethyl- 3 -ethoxy propionate. In the European Union, the naphthas are classified as mutagens and carcinogens category 1, officially. However, if benzene is below 0. 1 %, registrants in the EU proposed to omit this classification, and todays naptha products on the market obviously have benzene contents below 0. 1 %. On a first glance, the improvement for workplace safety introduced by the substitution, therefore, is comparatively small, as it is for toxicity in Life Cycle Assessment. However, when background knowledge concerning chemical production processes of naphtha is included, benzene below a content of 0. 1 % needs to be taken into consideration, and the benefit of substitution is more obvious...|$|E

The procedure includes the dilution of 3 [*]mL of sample (<b>naphtha</b> or <b>petroleum</b> condensate) to a final volume of 10 [*]mL with xylene, and direct injection of 30 [*]µL of this solution into the graphite furnace. The optimization of the instrumental conditions was performed using multivariate techniques. Firstly, a 23 full factorial design was performed for preliminary evaluation of the factors: pyrolysis time, pyrolysis temperature and atomization temperature. This experiment showed that in the studied levels only the factors pyrolysis time and atomization temperature were significant. Then, a 32 full factorial design was performed for {{the determination of the}} critical conditions of these variables. The method allows the determination of lead using the standard calibration technique with a calibration curve from 2. 6 to 30 [*]µg[*]L− 1 (correlation coefficient higher than 0. 998). A limit of detection (3 σ) of 0. 8 [*]µg[*]L− 1 and a characteristic mass of 35 [*]pg were obtained in the presence of palladium as modifier.

40|$|Abstract Quantitative cradle-to-gate {{environmental}} impacts for ethylene production from <b>naphtha</b> (<b>petroleum</b> crude), ethane (natural gas) and ethanol (corn-based) are predicted using GaBi software. A comparison {{reveals that the}} majority of the predicted {{environmental impacts}} for these feedstocks fall within the same order of magnitude. Soil and water pollution associated with corn-based eth-ylene are however much higher. The main causative factor for greenhouse gas emissions, acidification and air pollu-tion is the burning of fossil-based fuel for agricultural operations, production of fertilizers and pesticides needed for cultivation (in the case of ethanol), ocean-based trans-portation (for naphtha) and the chemical processing steps (for all feedstocks). An assessment of the environmental impacts of different energy sources (coal, natural gas and fuel oil) reveals almost similar carbon footprints for all the fossil fuels used to produce a given quantity of energy. For most of the environmental impact categories, the GaBi software reliably predicts the qualitative trends. The pre-dicted emissions agree well with the actual emissions data reported by a coal-based power plant (Lawrence Energy Center, Lawrence, KS) and a natural gas-based power plant (Astoria Generating Station, Queens, NY) to the United States Environmental Protection Agency. The analysis shows that for ethylene production, fuel burning at the power plant to produce energy is by far the dominant source (78 – 93 % depending on the fuel source) of adverse environmental impacts...|$|R
50|$|A typical modern ammonia-producing plant first {{converts}} {{natural gas}} (i.e., methane) or LPG (liquefied petroleum gases such as propane and butane) or <b>petroleum</b> <b>naphtha</b> into gaseous hydrogen.

25|$|Steam {{cracking}} is a petrochemical {{process in}} which saturated hydrocarbons are broken down into smaller, often unsaturated, hydrocarbons. It is the principal industrial method for producing the lighter alkenes (or commonly olefins), including ethene (or ethylene) and propene (or propylene). Steam cracker units are facilities in which a feedstock such as <b>naphtha,</b> liquefied <b>petroleum</b> gas (LPG), ethane, propane or butane is thermally cracked {{through the use of}} steam in a bank of pyrolysis furnaces to produce lighter hydrocarbons. The products obtained depend on the composition of the feed, the hydrocarbon-to-steam ratio, and on the cracking temperature and furnace residence time.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis work reports bio-oil {{production}} by hydrothermal liquefaction of blackcurrant pomace (Ribes nigrum L), a fruit residue obtained after berry pressing. The bio-oil {{has a higher}} heating value of 35. 9 MJ kg(- 1) and low ash content, which makes it suitable for energy applications. We report the influence of process parameters on yields and carbon distribution between products: temperature (563 - 608 K), holding time (0 - 240 min), mass fraction of dry biomass in the slurry (0. 05 - 0. 29), and initial pH (3. 1 - 12. 8) by adding sodium hydroxide (NaOH). Depending on the experiments, the bio-oil accounts for at least 24 % mass fraction of the initial dry biomass, while char yields ranges from 24 to 40 %. A temperature of 583 K enhances the bio-oil yield, up to 30 %, while holding time {{does not have a}} significant influence on the results. Increasing biomass concentrations decreases bio-oil yields from 29 % to 24 %. Adding sodium hydroxide decreases the char yield from 35 % at pH = 3. 1 (without NaOH) to 24 % at pH = 12. 8. It also increases the bio-oil yield and carbon transfer to the aqueous phase. Thermogravimetric analysis shows that a 43 % mass fraction of the bio-oil boils in the medium <b>naphtha</b> <b>petroleum</b> fraction range.

40|$|A {{cross-sectional}} {{study was conducted}} to determine whether exposure to hydrocarbons in a shoe factory may produce renal effects that can be detected by determination of the urinary excretion of proteins and enzymes. The study population included 59 women who had been exposed to <b>petroleum</b> <b>naphtha</b> and toluene and 24 age-matched control women. The time-weighted average exposure to <b>petroleum</b> <b>naphtha,</b> toluene and ethylacetate was 1, 619, 81 and 160 mg/m 3, respectively. The integrity of the renal structures or functions was assessed by measuring the urinary excretion of total protein, beta- 2 -microglobulin, retinol-binding protein, albumin, transferrin, lysozyme, lactate dehydrogenase and beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase (NAG). The only parameter that was significantly influenced by hydrocarbon exposure was the urinary, activity of beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase. Although the health significance of this renal change, which was not accompanied by changes in the urinary excretion of low- or high-molecular-weight proteins, is unclear, {{the results of the present}} study are in agreement with our previous observations suggesting that long-term moderate exposure to solvents does not entail a significant risk for the development of nephrotoxicity...|$|R
