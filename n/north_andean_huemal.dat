40|$|International audienceTrench-parallel extensional strain {{resulting}} from the northward drift of the <b>North</b> <b>Andean</b> block has controlled the tectonic evolution of the Gulf of Guayaquil-Tumbes Basin, {{at least for the}} past ∼ 1. 8 - 1. 6 Ma. Industrial multichannel seismic and well data document that E-W to ENE, low-angle detachment normal faults, the Posorja and Jambelí detachment systems to the north and the Tumbes detachment system to the south, accommodated the main subsidence step along the shelf area during late Pliocene-Quaternary times (1. 8 - 1. 6 Ma to present). Two tectonic regimes showing different styles and ages controlled the evolution of the southern Ecuador and northern Peru continental margin and shelf. The ∼N-S extensional regime along the shelf area is related to <b>North</b> <b>Andean</b> block drift, whereas the E-W extensional regime along the continental margin results from tectonic erosion at depth. Strain rotation takes place along a major N-S-trending transfer system formed by the Inner Domito fault and the Inner Banco Peru fault, which bound the detachment systems to the west. The strike-slip component along this transfer system, roughly located at the continental margin-shelf break, evolved as a response to slip along the detachment systems bounding the basin to the north and to the south. The Tumbes detachment system is the master fault controlling basin evolution through time, and it may represent the shallower expression of a reactivated obduction megathrust. It connects landward with the continental structures assumed {{to be part of the}} eastern frontier of the <b>North</b> <b>Andean</b> block.

To clarify some issues concerning the distribution and the taxonomic identity of the species of Coendou in the country, we reviewed specimens from five natural history collections. We introduce the first record of Coendou ichillus from the Orinoco river basin of the country, extending the distribution of the species by more than 600 km to the north from previous known localities in Ecuador and Peru. Additionally, we present new records of C. pruinosus and C. quichua from the Amazonia and inter-Andean valleys, respectively. Only one skull presents the diagnostic characters of C. bicolor; thus, previous records of this species for the country were based on misidentifications. Coendou is distributed in seven of the nine geographic provinces of Colombia. Coendou prehensilis was found in five provinces and is expected to be present in the Amazonia, whereas C. pruinosus was documented in three provinces (<b>North</b> <b>Andean,</b> Orinoco and Guyana).

40|$|A {{new view}} of Ecuador's complex geodynamics has been {{developed}} {{in the course of}} modeling seismic source zones for probabilistic seismic hazard analysis. This study focuses on two aspects of the plates' interaction at a continental scale: (a) age-related differences in rheology between Farallon and Nazca plates-marked by the Grijalva rifted margin and its inland projection-as they subduct underneath central Ecuador, and (b) the rapidly changing convergence obliquity resulting from the convex shape of the South American northwestern continental margin. Both conditions satisfactorily explain several characteristics of the observed seismicity and of the interseismic coupling. Intermediate-depth seismicity reveals a severe flexure in the Farallon slab as it dips and contorts at depth, originating the El Puyo seismic cluster. The two slabs position and geometry below continental Ecuador also correlate with surface expressions observable in the local and regional geology and tectonics. The interseismic coupling is weak and shallow south of the Grijalva rifted margin and increases northward, with a heterogeneous pattern locally associated to the Carnegie ridge subduction. High convergence obliquity is responsible for the <b>North</b> <b>Andean</b> Block northeastward movement along localized fault systems. The Cosanga and Pallatanga fault segments of the <b>North</b> <b>Andean</b> Block-South American boundary concentrate most of the seismic moment release in continental Ecuador. Other inner block faults located along the western border of the inter-Andean Depression also show a high rate of moderate-size earthquake production.

40|$|A seismic {{study of}} {{a segment of the}} {{convergent}} margin of Ecuador is presented. During the SISTEUR campaign a network of 24 Ocean Bottom Seismometers (OBS) was deployed on the Carnegie Ridge, one line along the main axes of the ridge and two lines across the strike of the edge of the ridge, during one month. This marine network was complemented with a land network of 20 stations distributed in two lines: one parallel to the margin and the other perpendicular to it. The seismic event recorded by these networks, were located using different crustal models defined from the wide-angle seismic data modeling. Relative location techniques were used to improve earthquake locations. Seismogram waveform modeling allowed us to constrain hypocentral location for events farther than similar to 50 km from the network. This modeling also provided additional information to constrain the focal mechanisms of these events. The upper limit of the Interplate Seismogenic Zone (ISZ) is estimated to be at a 10 km depth in the region. The background seismic activity of the upper plate provided new insights: 1) A seismic cluster that reaches the base of the overriding plate is linked to the Jipijapa-Portoviejo fault. The reactivation of this Quaternary fault is confirmed by focal mechanisms that provide rupture planes parallel to its superficial projection (N 10 degrees-N 25 degrees). 2) The focal mechanisms presented in this study are compatible with a homogeneous regional stress field corresponding to an E-W to ESE-WNW compression and an NNE-SSW extension.

50|$|The <b>North</b> <b>Andean</b> {{convergent}} margin is {{a region}} of large crustal deformation.

In addition, the subduction of the Carnegie Ridge may be an important drive contributing to the relatively northeastward movement of the North Andes block. Although there was no large earthquakes in the Gulf of Guayaquil segment of the subduction zone in the late 20th century, the strong earthquakes in 1953 and 1959 suggested that this was because of the strong coupling rather than being aseismic, and the seismic coupling may be quite high and be able to produce large earthquakes.|$|R

On the other hand, those lakes where Daphnia is present have the lower predation risk than those were Daphnia is absent.

The project aims at mapping the segmentation of this major active fault system. A series of fault strands newly mapped in direct continuation to the Pallatanga Fault (PF) to the north allow the definition of a large structure capable of triggering large events. This is confirmed by the presence of historical well-preserved scarps and decametric offsets (probably due to the 1797 M 7. 5 Riobamba event) disrupting the Igualata volcano. We could not find evidence for any structural continuity between the PF and the fault mapped in the Huisla volcano to the NE. We suggest that a 5 - 10 km wide step over separates the two segments and probably blocked the 1797 rupture. A recent surface rupture has also been recently discovered during the M 5 Pisayambo quake along the Cosanga Fault (CF) system, with uncommon surface rupture length and displacement.

On 04 June 2011, a mega-eruption in the Puyehue volcanic complex (Chile) discharged {{massive amounts of}} ash and pumice. Using long-term data from five <b>North</b> <b>Andean</b> Patagonian lakes (Espejo, Correntoso, Nahuel Huapi, Gutiérrez, and Mascardi) that received differing levels of ash, we show that, in Lakes Espejo, Correntoso, and Nahuel Huapi, these inputs resulted in 1. 5 - to 8 -fold increases in total suspended solids, light extinction, phosphorus concentrations, and phytoplankton biomass relative to pre-eruption conditions. Although ashes affected light scattering, the ultraviolet: photosynthetically active radiation ratio remained, 0. 30 – 0. 35 in all the lakes and no changes were seen in dissolved organic carbon in the affected lakes post-eruption. Thus, no differential specific absorption of the different light wavelengths occurred due to ash input. The results of multiple regression analysis identified light extinction coefficient of PAR (KPAR) as the primary variable that was associated with variation in phytoplankton biomass (chlorophyll). Furthermore, incubation experiments demonstrated significant effects of photoinhibition on phytoplankton growth in these lakes at ambient pre-eruption light intensities. Thus, we infer that increased phytoplankton biomass following the eruption likely reflects nutrient (phosphorus) loading and attenuation of excessive ligh...|$|R
40|$|The inter-Andean {{structure}} {{is defined as}} an approximately north–south-trending, linear, topographic depression in Ecuador located between the Cordillera Real and the Cordillera Occidental. The depression swings westward toward the Gulf of Guayaquil in southern Ecuador, dissecting the topography of the Cordillera Occidental. The structural limits of the depression are reactivated faults, which formed during accretionary events after 140 Ma along the Ecuadorian continental margin. Several distinct basins progressively formed along the depression. A new, radiometric-based, chronostratigraphic framework for the sedimentary series of the Chota basin has been combined with data from other subbasins in the inter-Andean depression to reevaluate the timing and formation of the larger scale tectonic structures. Inception of the Chota basin commenced at ∼ 6 – 5 Ma (latest Miocene), and the progressively younger Quito-San Antonio-Guayllabamba, Ambato-Latacunga, and Riobamba-Alausí basins formed along a southward trend. Each basin was filled with alluvial fan, fluvial, lacustrine, and contemporaneous volcanic deposits. Synsedimentary transpressive deformation was dominant during basin development, though minor, synsedimentary, normal faulting is assumed to have occurred during short periods of weakening compression.

40|$|Along the Ecuadorian margin, oblique {{subduction}} induces {{deformation of}} the overriding continental plate. For the last 15 Ma, both exhumation and tectonic history of Ecuador {{suggest that the}} northeastward motion of the <b>North</b> <b>Andean</b> Sliver (NAS) was accompanied by an eastward migration of its eastern boundary and successive progressively narrowing restraining bends. Here we present geologic data, earthquake epicenters, focal mechanisms, GPS results, and a revised active fault map consistent with this new kinematic model. All data sets concur to demonstrate that active continental deformation is presently localized along a single major fault system, connecting fault segments from the Gulf of Guayaquil to the eastern Andean Cordillera. Although secondary faults are recognized within the Cordillera, they accommodate a negligible fraction of relativemotion compared to themain fault system. The eastern limit is then concentrated rather than distributed as first proposed, marking a sharp boundary between the NAS, the Inca sliver, and the Subandean domain overthrusting the South American craton. The NAS limit follows a northeast striking right-lateral transpressional strike-slip system from the Gulf of Guayaquil (Isla Puná) to the Andean Cordillera and with the north-south striking transpressive faults along the eastern Andes. Eastward migration of the restraining belt since the Pliocene, abandonment of the sutures and reactivation of north-south striking ancient fault zones lead to the final development of a major tectonic boundary south and east of the NAS, favoring its extrusion as a continental sliver, accommodating the oblique convergence of the Nazca oceanic plate toward South Americ...|$|R

Gravimetric and geologic data show that the reactivation of the Neogene Interandean depression and/or the ~ 75 - 65 Ma ophiolite suture into the modern dynamic of the Andes controlled the Gulf of Guayaquil Tumbes basin (GGTB) location and evolution during the past 1. 8 - 1. 6 Myr at least. Depending on whether the remobilization occurred along the in-terandean depression or the ophiolite suture, the GGTB evolved trough pure or simple shear mechanisms, respectively. Because the GGTB exhibits an along strike tectonic asymmetry associated with a pervasive seismic gap, the simple shear solution is more likely. Tectonic inversion occurred along a mid-crust detachment (the Mid-Crust detachment hereafter) matching the ophiolite suture that accommodates the <b>North</b> <b>Andean</b> Block (NAB) northward drift.

The land-ward dipping Woollard detachment system located at the Upper-Lower slope boundary connects the subduction channel at depth, allowing the Upper slope to evolve independently from the Lower slope wedge. The long-term recurrence in-terval between earthquakes, the strong interplate coupling, and the aseismic creeping deformation acting along the mai...|$|R
