Within a coalescent framework C. Wiuf and P. Donnelly (1999, Theor. Popul. Biol. 56, 183 201) derived an exact analysis of the conditional genealogy but it is inconvenient for applications. Here, we develop an approximation to the exact distribution of the conditional genealogy, including an approximation to the distribution of the time at which the mutation arose. The approximations are accurate for frequencies q< 5 10. In addition, a simple and fast simulation scheme is constructed. We consider a demography parameterized by a d-dimensional vector:=(: 1, [...] ., : d). It is shown that the conditional genealogy and the age of the mutation have distributions that depend on a=q: and q only, and that the effect of q is a linear scaling of times in the genealogy; if q is doubled, the lengths of all branches in the genealogy are doubled.

40|$|The {{sampling}} {{distributions of}} several statistics that measure {{the association of}} alleles on gametes (linkage disequilibrium) are estimated under a two-locus <b>neutral</b> infinite <b>allele</b> model using an efficient Monte Carlo method. An often used approximation for the mean squared linkage disequilibrium is shown to be inaccurate unless the proper statistical conditioning is used. The joint distribution of linkage disequilibrium and the allele frequencies in the sample is studied. This estimated joint distribution is sufficient for obtaining an approximate maximum likelihood estimate of C = 4 Nc, where N is the population size and c is the recombination rate. It {{has been suggested that}} observations of high linkage disequilibrium might be a good basis for rejecting a neutral model in favor of a model in which natural selection maintains genetic variation. It is found that a single sample of chromosomes, examined at two loci cannot provide sufficient information for such a test if C < 10, because with C this small, very high levels of linkage disequilibrium are not unexpected under the neutral model. In samples of size 50, it is found that, even when C is as large as 50, the distribution of linkage disequilibrium conditional on the allele frequencies is substantially different from the distribution when there is no linkage between the loci. When conditioned on the number of alleles at each locus in the sample, all of the sample statistics examined are nearly independent of θ = 4 Nµ, where µ is the neutral mutation rate...|$|R

40|$|AbstractA single {{nucleotide}} polymorphism in the promoter of the multifunctional cytokine Interleukin 4 (IL 4) affects the binding of NFAT, a key transcriptional activator of IL 4 in T cells [1, 2]. This regulatory polymorphism influences the balance of cytokine signaling in the immune system, with important consequences—positive and negative—for human health [3 – 12]. We determined that the NFAT binding site is unique to humans; it arose by point mutation along the lineage separating humans from other great apes. We show that its frequency distribution among human subpopulations has been shaped by the balance of selective forces on IL 4 's diverse roles. New statistical approaches, based on parametric and nonparametric comparisons to neutral variants typed in the same individuals, indicate that differentiation among subpopulations at the IL 4 promoter polymorphism is too great to be attributed to <b>neutral</b> drift. The <b>allele</b> frequencies of this binding site represent local adaptation to diverse pathogenic challenges; disease states associated with the common derived allele are side-effects of positive selection on other IL 4 functions...|$|R

A prime candidate for inducing cross-reactive immune responses is a homology sequence, PEVKEK, found both in CBV 4 2 C protein and in GAD 65. To characterize the CBV 4 -specific T-cell epitopes, overlapping peptides covering the 2 C protein were synthesized and CBV 4 -specific T-cell lines were established from healthy and diabetic subjects. The T-cell epitopes were dependent on the HLA-DR genotype of the T-cell donor, but no difference between diabetic and healthy subjects could be detected. Peptide p 4, which included the PEVKEK sequence, contained an HLA-DR 1 -restricted T-cell epitope. Three randomly selected CBV 4 -specific T-cell lines, which responded to peptide p 4, failed to recognize GAD 65 protein or GAD 65 peptides containing the PEVKEK sequence. We conclude that the CBV 4 2 C protein is strongly immunogenic for T-cells and PEVKEK is included in a T-cell epitope. However, presentation of this epitope {{in the context of}} <b>neutral</b> HLA-DR 1 <b>allele</b> does not support its role in pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes...|$|R
40|$|Loci {{involved}} in local adaptation can potentially {{be identified by}} an unusual correlation between allele frequencies and important ecological variables or by extreme allele frequency differences between geographic regions. However, such comparisons are complicated by differences in sample sizes and the <b>neutral</b> correlation of <b>allele</b> frequencies across populations due to shared history and gene flow. To overcome these difficulties, we have developed a Bayesian method that estimates the empirical pattern of covariance in allele frequencies between populations from a set of markers and then uses this as a null model for a test at individual SNPs. In our model the sample frequencies of an allele across populations are drawn from a set of underlying population frequencies; a transform of these population frequencies is assumed to follow a multivariate normal distribution. We first estimate the covariance matrix of this multivariate normal across loci using a Monte Carlo Markov chain. At each SNP, we then provide {{a measure of the}} support, a Bayes factor, for a model where an environmental variable has a linear effect on the transformed allele frequencies compared to a model given by the covariance matrix alone. This test is shown through power simulations to outperform existing correlation tests. We also demonstrate that our method can be used to identify SNPs with unusually large allele frequency differentiation and offers a powerful alternative to tests based on pairwise or global FST.

40|$|We {{studied the}} effect of multilocus {{balancing}} selection on neutral nucleotide variability at linked sites by simulating a model where diallelic polymorphisms are maintained at an arbitrary number of selected loci by means of symmetric overdominance. Different combinations of alleles define different genetic backgrounds that subdivide the population and strongly affect variability. Several multilocus fitness regimes with different degrees of epistasis and gametic disequilibrium are allowed. Analytical results based on a multilocus extension of the structured coalescent predict that the expected linked neutral diversity increases exponentially {{with the number of}} selected loci and can become extremely large. Our simulation results show that although variability increases with the number of genetic backgrounds that are maintained in the population, it is reduced by random fluctuations in the frequencies of those backgrounds and does not reach high levels even in very large populations. We also show that previous results on balancing selection in single-locus systems do not extend to the multilocus scenario in a straightforward way. Different patterns of linkage disequilibrium and of the frequency spectrum of neutral mutations are expected under different degrees of epistasis. Interestingly, the power to detect balancing selection using deviations from a <b>neutral</b> distribution of <b>allele</b> frequencies seems to be diminished under the fitness regime that leads to the largest increase of variability over the neutral case.

40|$|Comparing allele {{frequencies}} among {{populations that}} differ in environment {{has long been}} a tool for detecting loci involved in local adaptation. However, such analyses are complicated by an imperfect knowledge of population <b>allele</b> frequencies and <b>neutral</b> correlations of <b>allele</b> frequencies among populations due to shared population history and gene flow. Here we develop a set of methods to robustly test for unusual allele frequency patterns, and correlations between environmental variables and allele frequencies while accounting for these complications based on a Bayesian model previously implemented in the software Bayenv. Using this model, we calculate a set of `standardized allele frequencies' that allows investigators to apply tests of their choice to multiple populations, while accounting for sampling and covariance due to population history. We illustrate this first by showing that these standardized frequencies can be used to calculate powerful tests to detect non-parametric correlations with environmental variables, which are also less prone to spurious results due to outlier populations. We then demonstrate how these standardized allele frequencies can be used to construct a test to detect SNPs that deviate strongly from neutral population structure. This test is conceptually related to FST but should be more powerful as we account for population history. We also extend the model to next-generation sequencing of population pools, which is a cost-efficient way to estimate population allele frequencies, but it implies an additional level of sampling noise. The utility of these methods is demonstrated in simulations and by re-analyzing human SNP data from the HGDP populations.

40|$|Terpenoids, {{especially}} monoterpenes, {{are major}} aroma-impact compounds in grape and wine. Previous studies highlighted a key regulatory role for grapevine 1 -deoxy-D-xylulose 5 -phosphate synthase 1 (VvDXS 1), the first enzyme of the methylerythritol phosphate pathway for isoprenoid precursor biosynthesis. Here, the parallel analysis of VvDXS 1 genotype and terpene concentration in a germplasm collection demonstrated that VvDXS 1 sequence {{has a very}} high predictive value for the accumulation of monoterpenes and also {{has an influence on}} sesquiterpene levels. A metabolic engineering approach was applied by expressing distinct VvDXS 1 alleles in the grapevine model system “microvine” and assessing the effects on downstream pathways at transcriptional and metabolic level in different organs and fruit developmental stages. The underlying goal was to investigate two potential perturbation mechanisms, the former based on a significant over-expression of the wild-type (<b>neutral)</b> VvDXS 1 <b>allele</b> and the latter on the ex-novo expression of an enzyme with increased catalytic efficiency from the mutated (muscat) VvDXS 1 allele. The integration of the two VvDXS 1 alleles in distinct microvine lines was found to alter the expression of several terpenoid biosynthetic genes, as assayed through an ad hoc developed TaqMan array based on cDNA libraries of four aromatic cultivars. In particular, enhanced transcription of monoterpene, sesquiterpene and carotenoid pathway genes was observed. The accumulation of monoterpenes in ripe berries was higher in the transformed microvines compared to control plants. This effect is predominantly attributed to the improved activity of the VvDXS 1 enzyme coded by the muscat allele, whereas the up-regulation of VvDXS 1 plays a secondary role in the increase of monoterpenes...|$|R
