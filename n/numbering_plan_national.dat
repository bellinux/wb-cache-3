A controversy arose when the regular Army attempted {{to reduce the}} <b>number</b> of <b>planned</b> <b>National</b> Guard divisions to 21, which was resolved when Secretary of Defense Neil H. McElroy decided on 27 for the Army National Guard. By September 1959 the Army National Guard had reorganized into twenty-one infantry and six armored divisions. Non-divisional regimental combat teams were replaced with separate combined arms brigades; Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and Arizona organized the 29th, 92nd and 258th Infantry Brigades.|$|R

40|$|In this report, {{the extent}} of safety of moped and {{low-speed}} moped riders (In Dutch: "snorfietsers") {{in the province of}} Zeeland and relevant measures are studied. First of all, the Zeeland accident data was analysed to establish the extent and development of safety of mopeds and light-speed mopeds. National data were included {{to be able to make}} a comparison with the rest of the country. With 19 % of the national total, and compared to the other eleven provinces, Zeeland has the highest share of moped and light-speed moped rider in-patients. Since 1991, there has been an increasing number of such victims. The study further divided the victims by region within the province, and analysed them by age group and injury severity. The report considers a <b>number</b> of (<b>planned)</b> <b>national</b> measures for improving moped and light-speed moped riders' safety. The report concentrates on the description of a number of specific activities aimed at older moped or light-speed moped riders, speeds of mopeds and light-speed mopeds, and the extent to which crash helmets are used (properly). Speeds and (correct) helmet use are covered in relation to the increased police surveillance. Two measuring programmes to obtain a representative picture of speeds and crash helmet use in Zeeland, are outlined...|$|R

The system divided the North American service territories into <b>numbering</b> <b>plan</b> areas (NPAs), and called the numerical prefix the <b>numbering</b> <b>plan</b> area code, which became known in a short-form as area code.
