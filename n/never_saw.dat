5|$|The Guards {{apparently}} <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> the letter; the Adjutant General instead {{directed the}} letter {{to be placed in}} a War Office file rather than being sent to the regiment.|$|E
5|$|The {{use of the}} Silverplate codename was {{discontinued}} {{after the}} war, but modifications continued under a new codename, Saddletree. Another 80 aircraft were modified under this program. The last group of B-29s was modified in 1953, but <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> further service.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have seen}} the hour, Jacopo, when even thy young arm would have tired in such a strife between us. That was before the birth of my eldest son, who died in battle with the Ottoman, when the dear boy he left me was but an infant in arms. Thou <b>never</b> <b>sawest</b> the comely lad, good Jacopo?" ...|$|R

5|$|By 1636 the tulip bulb {{became the}} fourth leading export {{product of the}} Netherlands, after gin, {{herrings}} and cheese. The price of tulips skyrocketed because of speculation in tulip futures among people who <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> the bulbs. Many men made and lost fortunes overnight.|$|E
5|$|Hogarth {{was still}} at work on A Harlot's Progress when she died, so she <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> herself immortalised. There were other madams ready to step into her shoes, {{but it was not}} until Mother Douglas took over the King's Head in Covent Garden in 1741 that a brothel reappeared with a {{reputation}} to match that of Needham.|$|E
5|$|Over {{forty years}} after his death, Ochs's songs remain relevant. Ochs {{continues}} to influence singers and fans worldwide, most of whom <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> him perform live. There are mailing lists and online discussion groups dedicated to Ochs and his music; websites that have music samples, photographs, and other links; and articles and books continue to be written and published about him.|$|E

50|$|Le Corbusier <b>never</b> {{actually}} <b>saw</b> the building. He {{was invited}} to the opening ceremony, but he declined the invitation {{on account of his}} poor health.|$|R
5|$|Stanley <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> a Stanley Cup {{championship}} game, {{nor did he}} {{ever present}} the Cup. Although his term as Governor General ended in September 1893, {{he was forced to}} return to England on July 15. In April of that year, his elder brother Edward Stanley, 15th Earl of Derby died, and Stanley succeeded him as the 16th Earl of Derby.|$|E
5|$|The 13th Airborne Division was an {{airborne}} forces formation of division-size of the United States Army that was active during World War II. The division was commanded {{for most of}} its existence by Major General Elbridge G. Chapman. It was officially activated in the United States in August 1943 at Fort Bragg in North Carolina, remaining active until February 1946, but <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> combat.|$|E
5|$|A Dexter's Laboratory combat-style action {{video game}} for the PlayStation 2 and Nintendo GameCube was set to be {{developed}} by n-Space, published by BAM! Entertainment, and distributed by Acclaim Entertainment for a 2004 release, but the project was cancelled. On February 15, 2005, Midway Games announced plans to develop and produce a new Dexter's Laboratory video game for multiple consoles, but the game <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> the light of day.|$|E

5|$|After {{a drunken}} and violent fight with Graham in 1938, Scott {{returned}} to Asheville. A group from Zelda's hospital {{had planned to}} go to Cuba, but Zelda had missed the trip. The Fitzgeralds decided to go on their own. The trip was a disaster even by their standards: Scott was beaten up {{when he tried to}} stop a cockfight and returned to the United States so intoxicated and exhausted that he was hospitalized. The Fitzgeralds <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> each other again.|$|E
5|$|Albert and his elder brother, Ernest, {{spent their}} youth {{in a close}} {{companionship}} marred by their parents' turbulent marriage and eventual separation and divorce. After their mother was exiled from court in 1824, she married her lover, Alexander von Hanstein, Count of Polzig and Beiersdorf. She presumably <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> her children again, and died of cancer {{at the age of}} 30 in 1831. The following year, their father married his own niece, his sons' cousin Princess Antoinette Marie of Württemberg; their marriage was not close, however, and Antoinette Marie had little—if any—impact on her stepchildren's lives.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of this attack, a 4-inch Mark III QF gun was erected on a {{promontory}} overlooking Village Bay, but it <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> action against the enemy. Of greater long-term significance to the islanders were the introduction of regular {{contact with the outside world}} and the slow development of a money-based economy. This made life easier for the St Kildans but also made them less self-reliant. Both were factors in the evacuation of the island little more than a decade later.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in July 1943, No. 450 Squadron {{took part}} in the Allied {{invasion}} of Sicily and the Italian campaign, primarily in the close support role. Its aircraft attacked targets in Yugoslavia as well as in Sicily and Italy. The squadron began converting from Kittyhawks to North American P-51 Mustang fighters in May 1945, but <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> action with its new aircraft. It was disbanded in August 1945 following the conclusion of hostilities, having suffered 63 fatal casualties during the war. Today, by agreement with the RAAF, the squadron's number is carried by a Royal Canadian Air Force unit, 450 Tactical Helicopter Squadron.|$|E
5|$|Both the Two Tons and Sylvester came {{to suspect}} that Fantasy Records had failed to pay them {{all of the money}} that they were owed from the sale of their records. Sylvester left Fantasy and in November 1982 he filed a lawsuit against them; it {{ultimately}} proved successful in establishing that the company had been withholding money from him totaling $218,112.50. Nevertheless, Fuqua proved unable to pay anything more than $20,000, meaning that Sylvester <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> the majority of the money that was legally owed to him. Sylvester grew to despise Fuqua, and forbade his friends from ever mentioning his name.|$|E
5|$|Butlin {{remained}} {{close to}} his mother, both in following her to Canada and in arranging {{for her to come}} home {{after the death of his}} stepfather. She died in 1934 and <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> his first holiday camp. By contrast, Butlin makes no mention in his biography of his father after returning from Canada. Public records from South Africa show that his father remained in Cape Town for the rest of his life, dying in 1954.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} of the court-martial in August 1944, the charges against Robinson had been reduced to two counts of insubordination during questioning. Robinson was acquitted by an all-white panel of nine officers. The {{experiences}} Robinson was subjected to during the court proceedings would be remembered when he later joined MLB and was subjected to racist attacks. Although his former unit, the 761st Tank Battalion, became the first black tank unit to see combat in World War II, Robinson's court-martial proceedings prohibited him from being deployed overseas; thus, he <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> combat action.|$|E
5|$|Director Rob Bowman {{initially}} {{thought that}} the episode could be filmed in five days, two fewer than usual. However, it was actually filmed in three days after pressure from Paramount with two spent only on the sickbay set. He later said that he simply shot the framework for the clips to be added in later, and <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> a final cut of the episode. Production assistant Eric A. Stillwell was responsible for selecting the clips {{that went into the}} episode, with 21 different clips included. The prop used on Riker to fight the infection was created from drawings by designer Rick Sternbach.|$|E
5|$|Every October 10, UPLB celebrates Loyalty Day, {{which has}} also become UPLB's alumni homecoming. The celebration commemorates events in 1918, when {{more than half of}} {{students}} and faculty (193 out of 300 students and 27 out of 32 faculty), including two women, enlisted in the Philippine National Guard for service in France during World War I. The volunteers <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> action, as the Allied Forces signed an armistice with Germany during the same year, essentially ending the war.|$|E
