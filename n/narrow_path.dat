5|$|Damage {{was also}} {{reported}} in Prince Edward Island {{as a result}} of the storm, particularly around Charlottetown, where its waterfront sustained heavy wave damage to pleasure craft and sea walls, as well as significant damage to the older urban forest in that city's downtown core. Extensive tree damage was also reported across the island, as well as structural damage to weaker buildings, such as barns and silos. The hurricane left portions of the island without power. The <b>narrow</b> <b>path</b> meant that damage was quite localized; little damage was reported in New Brunswick or western Prince Edward Island. Voting in the PEI general election on September29 was also disrupted, though more than 80% of voters made it to polling stations.|$|E
5|$|Shakti on a <b>narrow</b> <b>path.</b> As a kshatriya (member of {{the ruler}} class), Kalmashapada {{does not make}} way for Shakti, a brahmin (priestly class). Nevertheless, Shakti refuses to budge. Finally, an enraged Kalmashapada hits Shakti with his whip. In turn, the sage curses the king to wander the forest for 16 years. The sage Vishwamitra, the arch-enemy of Vashishtha who desires to have Kalmashapada as his disciple, sends a rakshasa to possess the king's body. Vishwamitra plots to destroy his enemy's family {{with the help of}} the king. Under the {{influence}} of the rakshasa, the king serves human flesh to a Brahmin, who sets Shakti's curse into effect. The king turns into a cannibalistic rakshasa.|$|E
5|$|Commanding 75 lances from Kinsky's company, and {{followed}} by {{the bulk of his}} force, Nassau passed through a <b>narrow</b> <b>path</b> in a small forest, and, coming out to open field, was surprised by the Spanish troops, namely by those under Hendrik van den Bergh, followed by Carlo Maria Caracciolo and the 's-Hertogenbosch lances. Van den Bergh's harquebusiers, discovering the Dutch column emerging from the forest, fired a volley and, turning right, clashed with the Dutch scouts, starting the action. There was then a firece fight. The Dutch troops were formed into eight squadrons, but caught by surprise in a narrow passage, the Dutch soldiers were unable to use their lances, so they were forced to defend themselves with swords and pistols. Philip of Nassau, his brothers and their cousin Ernst von Solms were seriously wounded and dismounted at the beginning the fight. Kinsky's and Balen's troops, coming in relief, were unable to rescue the wounded commanders, and some Dutch soldiers started to flee from the battlefield. Nicholas Parker, however, managed to collect the fugitives and, renewing the action, he put disorder into the Spanish cavalry. The encounter turned then a general action out the wood, in open ground.|$|E

25|$|Most of the Kandyan kingdom was mountainous and thickly forested, {{inhabited}} by snakes and leeches. The cold, wet climate compounded {{the difficulties of}} the terrain. Invaders were forced to march in single file along <b>narrow</b> <b>paths,</b> stretching an army over long distances. The Kandyans often used these <b>narrow</b> <b>paths</b> to set up ambuscades, trapping advancing columns by suddenly felling trees {{to the front and}} rear.|$|R
5|$|If the Moon {{were in a}} {{perfectly}} circular orbit, {{a little closer to}} the Earth, and in the same orbital plane, there would be total solar eclipses every new moon. However, since the Moon's orbit is tilted at more than 5 degrees to the Earth's orbit around the Sun, its shadow usually misses Earth. The Moon's orbit must cross Earth's ecliptic plane in order for an eclipse (both solar as well as lunar) to occur. In addition, the Moon's actual orbit is elliptical, often taking it far enough away from Earth that its apparent size is not large enough to block the Sun entirely. The orbital planes cross each other at a line of nodes resulting in at least two, and up to five, solar eclipses occurring each year; no more than two of which can be total eclipses. However, total solar eclipses are rare at any particular location because totality exists only along a <b>narrow</b> <b>path</b> on the Earth's surface traced by the Moon's shadow or umbra.|$|E
5|$|With {{the death}} of Ballaban, Ottoman forces were left {{surrounded}} and according to Bernandino de Geraldinis, a Neapolitan functionary, 10,000 men remained in the besieging camp. Those inside the encirclement asked to leave freely to Ottoman territory, offering to surrender all that was within the camp to the Albanians. Skanderbeg was prepared to accept, but many nobles refused. Among them was Dukagjini, who wanted to attack and destroy the Turkish camp. Demetrio Franco described Dukagjini's proposal with the Albanian word Embetha which in modern Albanian means Mbë ta or in English Upon them. The Albanians thus began to annihilate the surrounded army before the Ottomans cut a <b>narrow</b> <b>path</b> through their opponents and fled through Dibra. On 23 April 1467, Skanderbeg entered Krujë. Meanwhile, the Venetians had taken advantage of Mehmed's absence in Albania and sent a fleet under Vettore Capello into the Aegean. Capello attacked and occupied the islands of Imbros and Lemnos after which he sailed back and laid siege to Patras. Ömer Bey, the Ottoman commander in Greece, led a relief force to Patras where he was initially repelled before turning on his pursuers, forcing them to flee, terminating their campaign.|$|E
5|$|Back in Mopán, Amésqueta had {{received}} additional supplies {{and decided to}} catch up with his advance party. He left Mopán on 10 March 1696 with friar Agustín Cano and about 10 soldiers. He arrived at Chakal a week later but there was still no word from Díaz or AjK'ixaw. On 20 March Amésqueta left Chakal with 36 men and four days' supplies to find Díaz's party, whom he assumed would be nearby. After two days travelling in intense heat they met up with some Verapaz porters that Díaz had left behind. They followed Díaz's trail to the shore of Lake Petén Itzá near to the Itza capital. As they scouted along the south shore they were shadowed by about 30 Itza canoes, and more Itzas approached by land but kept a safe distance. There were plentiful signs that Díaz's party had passed that way, and Amésqueta assumed that they had crossed to Nojpetén. He wrote a letter to Díaz, which was passed to an Itza onlooker who indicated he would deliver it. Various Itzas now approached the party, including a nobleman who exchanged gifts with Amésqueta. During various attempts at communication to verify Díaz's whereabouts the Itza became agitated and responded angrily, although no-one in the Spanish party could understand the Itza language. The Itzas indicated that the Spanish should proceed to the lakeshore along a <b>narrow</b> <b>path</b> and embark in the small canoes that were stationed nearby. One of Amésqueta's officers recognised an Indian among the Itzas as a Mopan who had served as a soldier in Díaz's first expedition and thought that the Mopan was trying to tell him not to trust the Itzas.|$|E

5|$|This {{extremely}} long-tracked EF4 tornado {{touched down}} near Raleigh, Mississippi, in Smith County at 5:42p.m. CDT (2242 UTC), and {{continued into the}} Uniontown, Alabama area before dissipating. The tornado initially downed trees, blew skirting from mobile homes, and tore shingles from roofs. The tornado intensified as it moved northeast across Smith County and produced up to EF2 and EF3 damage. One mobile home was picked up, bounced a couple times, and thrown into a tree line, where it was torn apart and debris was scattered up to a mile away, including the frame. The tornado mowed down a stand of pine trees and destroyed two frame houses, with major damage to the interior walls, and the exterior walls completely destroyed. Many power poles were snapped, a mobile home was annihilated, and a large shop building was completely destroyed as well. It then moved into Jasper County and snapped and debarked many pine trees. The first area of EF4 damage was observed near Louin as a frame home and several mobile homes were completely destroyed, with parts of the mobile homes being thrown long distances, {{and some of the}} frame home foundation being swept clean. The tornado caused significant damage to a poultry farm and cattle ranch before it weakened briefly. It then destroyed two mobile homes and caused extensive tree and power line damage. The tornado then produced a relatively <b>narrow</b> <b>path</b> of EF1-strength tree and power line damage for several miles, until re-intensifying near to EF3 strength near Rose Hill.|$|E
