40|$|The {{systematic}} {{revision of}} the collection of Pliocene otoliths in the Museo Civico "F. Eusebio" at Alba allowed the identification of 145 teleost taxa of which 37 are new for the Mediterranean Lower Pliocene (Zanclean). The Zanclean Mediterranean deep water fish fauna {{was very different from}} the present day one. It essentially consisted of relicts from the Miocene fauna and of non-Mediterranean modern fishes.

Although three species common to the Belgian Eocene are still present, the appearance of four typically Oligocène species together with numerous new species unknown in the Eocene suggest that these sands are of lower Oligocene age.

40|$|International audienceRange shifts are {{of great}} {{importance}} as a response for species facing climate change. In the light of current ocean-surface warming, many {{studies have focused on}} the capacity of marine ectotherms to shift their ranges latitudinally. Bathymetric range shifts offer an important alternative, and may be the sole option for species already at high latitudes or those within enclosed seas; yet relevant data are scant. Hydrostatic pressure (HP) and temperature have wide ranging effects on physiology, importantly acting in synergy thermodynamically, and therefore represent key environmental constraints to bathymetric migration. We present data on transcriptional regulation in a shallow-water marine crustacean (Palaemonetes varians) at atmospheric and high HP following 168 -h exposures at three temperatures across the organisms' thermal scope, to establish the potential physiological limit to bathymetric migration by <b>neritic</b> <b>fauna.</b> We observe changes in gene expression indicative of cellular macromolecular damage, disturbances in metabolic pathways and a lack of acclimation after prolonged exposure to high HP. Importantly, these effects are ameliorated (less deleterious) at higher temperatures, and exacerbated at lower temperatures. These data, alongside previously published behavioural and heat-shock analyses, have important implications for our understanding of the potential for climate-driven bathymetric range shifts...|$|E
40|$|In the Guerrero {{province}} of Mexico, the calc-alcaline lavas of the Teloloapan volcanic arc unit are overlain by carbonates with reworked <b>neritic</b> <b>faunas</b> of Aptian–Albian age (La Evolucion Geologica y la Metalogénesis del Noroccidente de Guerrero. Universidad Autonoma de Guerrero, Serie Técnico-Cientifica, 1 (1979) 84). The discovery of an ammonite fauna {{at the top}} of the Teloloapan limestone provides a latest Albian age assignment for that horizon. The fauna includes: Pervinquieria rostrata, P. gr. inflata, Turrilitoides hugardianus, Stoliczkaia cf. blancheti, S. cf. tenuis, Desmoceras latidorsatum, Oxytropidoceras cf. cantianum, Puzosia aff. mayoriana, Lechites moreti, Hamites cf. gardneri, H. cf. maximus, and Falciferella campae n. sp. A pelagic microfauna is associated with the ammonites and contains Hedbergella sp. and Colomiella recta. The fossiliferous horizon may thus be restricted to the Inflatum and lower Dispar zones. The overlying flysch contains Hamites sp. gr. intermedius near the base. Therefore, volcanism in the Teloloapan arc ceased before the end of the Early Cretaceous, while flysch deposition began in latest Albian times...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} the benthic foraminiferal {{record of the}} neritic sequence at Gebel Aweina (Nile Valley, Egypt) {{in relation to the}} latest Paleocene deep-sea benthic extinction event (BEE). At Gebel Aweina an expanded sequence, spanning calcareous nannofossil Zones NP 8 -NPlO, is continuously exposed and yields calcareous microfauna throughout. The BEE level is situated about halfway through Zone NP 9 at 17 m above the base of the Esna Formation. Detailed biostratigraphic and isotopic studies have indicated that the sequence is (nearly?) complete across the upper Paleocene lower Eocene and, like elsewhere in Egypt and around the Mediterranean, the lowest common occurrence of the planktonic marker Globanomalina luxorensis coincides with the benthic foraminiferal extinction and the carbon isotopic excursion. Some fifteen benthic taxa disappeared at the same level, amongst them taxa that became globally extinct, such as Angulogavelinella avnimelechi, Coryphostoma midwayensis. Neoeponides lunata, and Neoflabellina jarvisi. Due to outer neritic (150 - 200 m; slightly deeper during late Biochron NP 8) depositional conditions, deepsea taxa such as Bulimina trinitatensis, Gavelinella beccariiformis, and Gyroidinoides globosus yield only scattered occurrences in a few samples. Despite a number of new appearances, the post-BEE assemblages (in total, 70 different taxa, about 40 per sample) remain impoverished relative to pre-BEE assemblages (in total, 91 taxa, about 55 per sample). The Gebel Aweina sequence provides strong evidence that the latest Paleocene BEE cannot be considered as a turnover that affected deep-sea benthic foraminifera faunas exclusively; simultaneously, outer <b>neritic</b> <b>faunas</b> experienced a punctuated, though less severe, evolutionary turnover. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|The {{ostracod}} fauna of {{the continental}} shelf of the States of Nayarit and Sinaloa in the Mexican Pacific Ocean consists of 33 species and 24 genera. Twenty of these 33 species had been previously described from the Gulf of California; 13 from the Pacific Coasts of Oregon, California and Baja California, 8 from the Mexican Tropical Pacific and 11 from Central America. The bathimetric distribution of the Ostracoda in the continental shelf of the studied área is restricted to the upper 100 m water depth. Below this, no ostracodes were found, although other calcareous microorganisms such as foraminifera are abundant and well preserved. This distribution is consistent with that found in other áreas of the Mexican Tropical Pacific and is probably related to the low oxygen concentrations in bottom water at that depth. Q-mode factor analysis delineated two associations. One characterized by Trachyleberidea? sp, Pterygocythereis delicata, Cativella dispar, Eucytherura spp, Loxoconcha tamarindoidea, Costa? sanfelipensis, Cytheropteron pacificumn, C. caboensis y C. altatensis, representing middle to outer neritic conditions; and a second association characterized by Cytherella ovularia, Kangarina ancyla, Megacythere punctocostata, Orionina serrulata, and Trachyleberis sp A suggesting a shallower, inner <b>neritic</b> <b>fauna...</b>|$|E

Both associations reflect deep neritic deposition, but a more precise interpretation can only be obtained by the examination of otolith associations from modern sea-floors with well known geographical and bathymetric locations. The deep neritic and mesopelagic components of the fauna will have little biostratigraphical value. On the contrary, the littoral component may acquire biostratigraphical significance, if compared with a biostratigraphical scale for littoral faunas, resulting from the study of otoliths of the underlying and overlying Aquitanian Miocene strata...|$|E

We investigated {{the role of the}} Algerian Current on the structure of the copepod community during June 1990 that covered an area between 1 °E and 5 °E. In this area, 2 oligotrophic systems of different origins (one related to the Atlantic flow, and the other related to typical Mediterranean waters) and a frontal system were identified. Environmental differences among the 3 zones were related to changes in sea surface salinity, density, and phytoplankton biomass (chlorophyll (Chl) -a concentrations). Three main copepod assemblages were revealed to be distributed along well-defined environmental gradients characterized by the distribution of physical variables and Chl-a. The 1 st group was located in the frontal zone where the highest Chl-a concentration was observed at the subsurface (> 1. 5 mg/m 3). This assemblage showed an important increase of herbivorous species (Paracalanus parvus, Clausocalanus arcuicornis, C. furcatus, Mesocalanus tenuicornis, and Eucalanus elongatus) which were numerically 4 times more abundant (> 90 %) than in modified Atlantic water (MAW) and offshore surface Mediterranean water (SMW) systems (< 30 % and 35 %, respectively). The 2 nd group occupied the inshore MAW system, and was characterized by a typical <b>neritic</b> <b>fauna</b> (Acartia clausi, Euterpina acutifrons, Oithona nana, and Temora stylifera).

40|$|The Southern Ocean {{cephalopod}} fauna is distinctive, {{with high}} levels of endemism in the squid and particularly in the octopodids. Loliginid squid, sepiids and sepiolids are absent from the Southern Ocean, and all the squid are oceanic pelagic species. The octopodids dominate the <b>neritic</b> cephalopod <b>fauna,</b> {{with high levels}} of diversity, probably associated with niche separation. In common with temperate cephalopods, Southern Ocean species appear to be semelparous, but growth rates are probably lower and longevity greater than temperate counterparts. Compared with equivalent temperate species, eggs are generally large and fecundity low, with putative long development times. Reproduction may be seasonal in the squid but is extended in the octopodids. Cephalopods {{play an important role in}} the ecology of the Southern Ocean, linking the abundant mesopelagic fish and crustaceans with higher predators such as albatross, seals and whales.

40|$|In {{the coastal}} waters between Cabo Frio, Rio de Janeiro State (Lat. 23 °S) and Chui, Rio Grande do Sui State (Lat. 34 °S), more than 30 species of {{cephalopods}} {{occur in the}} different marine environments. Temperate benthic octopuses of low fecundity, bearing large eggs, are restricted to the cold bottom waters of the outer shelf and the slope, in contrast to species of tropical origin, which occupy the more diverse shallow water habitats, principally along the Rio de Janeiro coast. Cosmopolitan warm-water octupuses with high fecundity, like Scaeurgus unicirrhus and Octopus vulgaris, are found along the entire area because the transport of pelagic juveniles is favored by the warm, southward flowing superficial Brazil Current. All three families of epipelagic octopuses are represented. The <b>neritic</b> squid <b>fauna</b> includes only five myopsid squids, four of them of tropical origin. At the upper slope Illex argentinus is dominant and several mesopelagic and bathipelagic oegopsids, widely distributed in tropical and temperate Atlantic Ocean waters, also occur.

40|$|The {{study of}} otolith assemblages from the pre-evaporitic Messinian {{deposits}} allows {{the reconstruction of}} a fauna of 79 taxa of which 35 could be identified at the specific level. Three of these are new: Diaphus rubus, Myctophum coppa, and Uranoscopus ciabatta. The assemblages reflect mainly a neritic environment influenced by the oceanic realm. Analysis of the global present-day geographic distribution of 42 of the recognised Messinian genera indicates that 88 % of these are {{still living in the}} Mediterranean, 98 % in the Atlantic and 78 % in the Indo-Pacific realm. These results are in good agreement with the evolutionary trends documented for the Oligocene and Miocene teleost fauna, specifically an increase in percentage of genera inhabiting the modern Mediterranean, a very high percentage of Atlantic and Indo-Pacific genera, and a slight fall of the importance of present-day Indo-Pacific genera from the Rupelian up to the Late Miocene. Analysing the composition of the Early Messinian fauna at the level of nominal species indicates that about 53 % of the species represented in the assemblages are still living in the Recent Mediterranean, and that a significant number of these were already present in the Tortonian. It is interesting that these species are mainly neritic. This seems to confirm that the close affinity of the fossil assemblage with the present-day Mediterranean <b>neritic</b> <b>fauna,</b> which was already recorded at the genus level for the Rupelian fauna, persists during the Neogene and continues until the Pleistocene...|$|E
40|$|The {{study of}} Oligocene fish {{otoliths}} {{from the blue}} marls in the Castellane area allowed the reconstruction of a teleost fauna of 38 taxa of which 16 could be identified at species level. This is the first otolith-based neritic fish fauna known from the Mediterranean Early Oligocene. Additional data for Early Oligocene otolith-based fish faunas of the paleo-Mediterranean Basin are available only from the Liguro-Piemontese Basin, northern Italy, where the associations are dominated by deepwater fishes. Combining the data from both Mediterranean paleoenvironments, one obtains a list of 88 taxa of which 48 could be identified to species level. This is the only available overview on {{the composition of the}} otolith-based fish fauna in the Mediterranean realm during the Early Oligocene. It is shown that already in the Oligocene, the <b>neritic</b> <b>fauna</b> shows good affinities with the present-day Mediterranean one, while the deepwater fauna was a circumglobal oceanic one, strongly different from the Recent Mediterranean deepwater fauna. The Early Oligocene and Late Eocene Mediterranean otolith-based teleost faunas are compared {{to each other and to}} contemporaneous faunas from the Aquitaine Basin. This provides evidence for a very strong faunal break in both basins, both in the neritic and the mesopelagic fauna, and this faunal turnover is interpreted as a response to the paleoceanographic and climatic changes (cooling) that took place at the Late Eocene-Early Oligocene at global scale. Finally, the results indicate the great homogeneity of the Eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean faunas during the late Eocene. Notwithstanding the strong faunal turnover at the Eocene-Oligocene boundary, the new Oligocene fauna also exhibits a similar homogeneity over a large geographic area which, for this time unit, can be extended to the Paratethys...|$|E
40|$|The tectono-sedimentary {{analysis}} of the Jurassic sediments in the southern margin of the central High-Atlas {{and particularly in the}} Todrha-Dad&# 232;s area shows the existence of a good relationship between the tectonic and the sedimentary events. The structuring of this area is controlled by a group of faults whose cartographic axes show bending paces of direction NE-SW straightening toward the NNE. The {{analysis of}} the spatial organisation of lower and middle Lias deposits shows a dominance of carbonated deposits with ammonites, algae and foraminifera, with variations of thickness and lateral facies variations. The upper Lias and the Dogger correspond to clastic deposits and carbonates interbeded with <b>neritic</b> <b>fauna.</b> The structural analysis shows that the sedimentation in the southern margin of the central High- Atlas is controlled, in addition to eustatic factors, by a paleostress field dominated by minimum main stress fields of orientations which change depending on the age. The analysis of structures and their geometry as well as the syn-sedimentary tectonics allowed to establish the directions of the tectonic stress, which controlled the structuration of the studied basin in the Jurassic. The general synthesis of the data shows variations of distensive directions in time and space. In the Sinemurian-lower Carixian the direction of the tectonic stress (&# 194;&# 163;m 3) is NW-SE. The middle Domerian was a relative quiet tectonic time. In the upper Domerian the distensive tectonic stress is NNW-SSE to NW-SE. In the Toarcian, the sedimentation takes place in a transtensif tectonic context. The synsedimentary structures are developed by fossilized normal faults, slope deposits and spatio-temporal variations of the facies and thickness. Geodynamic and paleogeographic reconstitution of Lias-Dogger shows an arrangement of the lithostratigraphic formations, where some evolved in the borders of the basin, while others evolved {{in the center of the}} basin within a block-tilting regime controlled by the conjugation of the sea-level changes and the tectonics events.

40|$|The Leeuwin Current can {{be tracked}} {{from the western}} margin of the Australian {{continent}} to the southern margin by the record of fossilized organisms typical of warm-water marine environments. This transport smudges the normal latitudinal asymmetry in the biotas of opposing oceanic and continental margins, in which the eastern margins of oceans are cooler than the western margins and warmer biotas are restricted to lower latitudes in the east. The most comprehensive record is in the large benthic foraminifera, although fossils of benthic invertebrates, nektonic nautiloids and planktonic protists are also informative. In addition, organic biomarker hydrocarbons in stranded bitumens and resins demonstrate that they have travelled the same route from their ultimate sources in Cenozoic sedimentary basins and modern tropical rainforests of the Indonesian Archipelago. The earliest spoor of the current is in the later middle Eocene, at which time the part-deflection of counter-gyral circulation in the Indian Ocean to the southeast was stimulated by the accelerated opening of the oceanic gap between Australia and Antarctica. Thus {{the origin of the}} Leeuwin Current is twice the age of the previously suggested origin in the Miocene. The current turns on and turns off in the Great Australian Bight during the late Quaternary in concert with the interglacials and the glacials at scales of 105 yr. The switch {{can be seen in the}} faunal succession of planktonic foraminifera which are consistent with the <b>neritic</b> benthic <b>faunas</b> of the central gulfs: both communities show that, at the warm peak of the last interglacial, the current transported biota across the Bight more strongly than it has during the Holocene. The Cenozoic record of the past 40 Ma is in the same mode at 106 yr scales: the relevant fossils are found concurrently at major marine transgressions and warming reversals of the overall fall in global temperature. However, the fossil pattern is due to transport on the activated Leeuwin Current, not merely to general warming and the spread of friendly environments to higher latitudes.

40|$|Micronektonic fishes and {{invertebrates}} were sampled with 32 {{midwater trawls}} at nine sites along the Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) in the austral fall (March-April) of 2010. Study sites were located within four hypothesized hydrographic regions: near Joinville Island in Region I, at Croker Passage, near Anvers Island, and near Renaud Island in Region II, within Marguerite Bay and the Marguerite Trough in Region III, and near Charcot Island in Region IV. A total of 62 taxa representing 12 taxonomic groups of pelagic invertebrates and 9 families of fish were captured, but assemblages {{were dominated by}} only a few species. The most numerically abundant taxa were the euphausiids, Thysanoessa macrura, Euphausia superba, and E. crystallorophias, combining to contribute nearly 79 % of the total catch. Biomass dominants included E. superba, which contributed more than 44 % of the total catch, the notothenioid Pleuragramma antarctica, and the salp, Salpa thompsoni. A comparison of total catches among sites revealed that the largest volumetric abundances and biomasses were captured at the Marguerite Bay site. Cluster analysis of abundance data identified distinct multispecies assemblages at Joinville Island in Region I, Croker Passage in Region II, Marguerite Bay in Region III, and Charcot Island in Region IV. A fifth distinct assemblage included samples from sites near Anvers and Renaud Island in Region II, and from the Marguerite Trough in Region III. Assemblages at Joinville Island and Croker Passage were both dominated by E. superba and S. thompsoni, but hydrographic conditions at Joinville Island favored a neritic assemblage, underscored by substantial numbers of P. antarctica. The assemblage at Croker Passage was more oceanic in nature with major inputs from the myctophid, Electrona antarctica and the hyperiid amphipod, Themisto gaudichaudii. Marguerite Bay and Charcot Island were well-mixed assemblages with strong representation by both <b>neritic</b> and oceanic <b>fauna.</b> The mid-peninsula assemblage was oceanic in character, being overwhelmingly dominated by Thysanoessa macrura and T. gaudichaudii. Pleuragramma antarctica were captured at five sites: Joinville Island, Croker Passage, Marguerite Bay, and the two sites near Charcot Island. They were completely absent at the two sites near Anvers Island, at Renaud Island, and in the Marguerite Trough. One fish was captured in Croker Passage. The majority of fish captured in Marguerite Bay were larger than 150 mm standard length (SL), with very few fish of smaller size present. If resident populations of Pleuragramma reproduce and recruit locally rather than being sustained by larval advection, those populations will be highly susceptible to local disappearance. This may be the causative factor behind the absence of Pleuragramma from the mid-peninsula region. Continued warming and subsequent sea ice reductions may not only cause Pleuragramma population collapses in the Marguerite Bay and Charcot Island regions, but may also change {{the character of the}} faunal assemblages along the WAP to those of an oceanic system...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Micronekton and macrozooplankton were sampled {{from the}} Western Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) and eastern Ross Sea regions. Samples were {{collected}} {{over the course}} of six research cruises to the Southern Ocean. Four of those cruises were conducted in the Marguerite Bay region of the WAP during the austral fall and winter of 2001 and 2002. A fifth cruise sampled faunal assemblages at nine sites, ranging from Joinville Island at the northern tip of the WAP to Charcot Island near the southern extent of the WAP, during austral fall 2010. A sixth cruise was conducted in the pack ice within the offshore, continental slope, and continental shelf zones of the Eastern Ross Sea during austral summer 1999 / 2000. The purpose of this dissertation was to describe the macrozooplanktonic/ micronektonic faunal assemblages present in each of those regions and relate differences in species composition and distribution patterns to local bathymetry, hydrography, and physical conditions. A variety of multivariate techniques were used to identify unique multispecies assemblages and to quantify the contributions of both oceanic and neritic species to the assemblages within each study region. The invertebrate micronekton/macrozooplankton communities found in the Marguerite Bay region of the WAP during the 2001 / 2002 cruises were a mixture of oceanic and neritic fauna: a direct result of local hydrographic conditions. Near the shelf break and in the outer reaches of the Marguerite Trough, a deep canyon transecting the shelf in a south-southeast direction, the communities were more diverse, dominated by oceanic species such as the euphausiid, Euphausia triacantha, the salp, Salpa thompsoni, and, an amphipod, Themisto gaudichaudii. The assemblages present in the nearshore fjords exhibited lower diversity and were dominated by neritic species such as the euphausiid, E. crystallorophias, and the mysid, Antarctomysis ohlinii. At the mid-shelf and mid-trough locations, the assemblages were composed of a variable mixture of oceanic and <b>neritic</b> <b>fauna.</b> The faunal mixing and overall species composition in those areas is the result of episodic Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW) intrusions onto the shelf via deep bathymetric features such as the Marguerite Trough. Distinct multispecies assemblages were identified at Joinville, Croker Passage, Marguerite Bay, Charcot Island, and from a region that included samples from sites near Anvers Island, Renaud Island and the Marguerite Trough. Assemblages at Joinville and Croker Passage were both dominated by E. superba and S. thompsoni, but hydrographic conditions at Joinville favored a neritic assemblage, underscored by the substantial numbers of the nototheniid fish, Pleuragramma antarcticum. The assemblage at Croker Passage was more oceanic in nature with major inputs from the myctophid fish, Electrona antarctica and the amphipod, T. gaudichaudii. Marguerite Bay and Charcot Island were well-mixed assemblages with strong representation by both neritic and oceanic fauna. The mid-peninsula assemblage was also oceanic in character, being overwhelmingly dominated by the euphausiid, Thysanoessa macrura, and T. gaudichaudii. Pleuragramma antarcticum were captured at five sites: Joinville, Croker Passage, Marguerite Bay, and the two sites near Charcot Island. They were completely absent at the two sites near Anvers Island, at Renaud Island, and in the Marguerite Trough. In the eastern Ross Sea, cluster analyses identified three primary groups, which were characterized as oceanic, mixed, and neritic assemblages due partly to their geographical location, but mostly to their faunal composition. The oceanic assemblage contained the highest number of taxa and was dominated by oceanic fauna, such as the hydrozoans Diphyes antarctica and Calycopsis borchgrevinki, and the scyphozoan Atolla wyvillei. Top contributors in the mixed assemblage included those species that dominated in the oceanic assemblage as well as substantial contributions from E. superba and the tunicate, Ihlea racovitzai. The neritic assemblage was overwhelmingly dominated by E. crystallorophias and E. superba. The physical environment strongly impacted micronektonic/ macrozooplanktonic distributions and densities in the eastern Ross Sea. Changes in faunal composition were directly related to temperature differences encountered at the shelf break and the subsequent filtering out of oceanic fauna from cold, shelf waters where endemic fauna were most prevalent...|$|E
