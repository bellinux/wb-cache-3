5000|$|In Industrial Knitting applications, {{the terms}} [...] "Flat" [...] and [...] "Circular" [...] have very {{different}} meanings to those given above. A [...] "Flat" [...] or Vee Bed knitting machine consists of 2 flat <b>needle</b> <b>beds</b> arranged in an upside-down [...] "V" [...] formation. These <b>needle</b> <b>beds</b> can be up to 2.5 metres wide. A carriage, {{also known as a}} Cambox or Head, moves backwards and forwards across these <b>needle</b> <b>beds,</b> working the <b>needles</b> to selectively, knit, tuck or transfer stitches. A flat knitting machine is very flexible, allowing complex stitch designs, shaped knitting and precise width adjustment. It is, however relatively slow when compared to a circular machine. Knitting speed up to [...]5 m/s or low is considered the low speed in flat knitting which is generally in hand flat machines. The two largest manufacturers of industrial flat knitting machines are Stoll of Germany, and Shima Seiki of Japan. The industrial hand flat knitting machine is considered to be launched by the Isaac Lamb patents.|$|R
50|$|Complete garment {{knitting}} requires two <b>needle</b> <b>beds</b> for three-dimensional structures (such as clothing). As is {{the case}} with all fully fashioned knitting, machines require individual single needle selection (through electronic control) and presser feet (to hold down formed loops).|$|R
5000|$|<b>Needle</b> <b>Bed</b> is {{the first}} studio album {{recorded}} by John Ralston. The album was released on June 6, 2006 on Vagrant Records. It was initially released privately and later re-released under the Vagrant label. A music video was shot for the promotional single, [...] "Gone Gone Gone". Ralston toured with Dashboard Confessional {{in support of this}} record.|$|E
5000|$|When We Are Cats is {{the first}} solo EP by John Ralston after his band Legends of Rodeo went on {{indefinite}} hiatus. Only 500 copies were originally pressed on clear vinyl. [...] When We Are Cats was later re-recorded for the debut full length <b>Needle</b> <b>Bed.</b> [...] Fake Emergency later appeared on the Box of Chocolates EP that accompanied Needle Bed's re-release by Vagrant Records.|$|E
5000|$|I {{waited on}} him and took his order for these rowing trunks, {{to be made of}} a stitch like that of a cuff of a sweater so that they would stay up without a drawstring. After he tried them, he liked them so well that he came back for another pair {{and other members of the}} club heard about them, saw them and came in and ordered trunks like them. Nearly every member of the club who rowed had a pair. Later on, this same member came to me and asked if we could not make him a bathing suit of the same {{material}} .... a suit was made for him and he went to the ocean to bathe in the cold water. When he came back, he came into the store and told us that it was heavy and one could not swim well in it, but that he was well satisfied because it was so much warmer than any suit that he had ever had before and that it made ocean bathing a pleasure. ... this experience gave us the idea that a bathing suit made of this stitch, only in lighter weight, would be an excellent garment. We discussed this between ourselves and decided that we would order a <b>needle</b> <b>bed</b> for our sweater machine that would be fine enough to knit a rib-stitch bathing suit in a weight that would be comfortable. Roy, Carl, Joe Gerber and I were constantly in the water those days, either in the Y. M. C. A. swimming pool or in the river and we began to experiment for our own use on swimming suits made of this fine elastic fabric. We soon developed a suit which we found was the most excellent garment for swimming that we had ever seen.|$|E
50|$|Most of {{the graves}} were looted. The buried {{clothing}} and footwear is colorful, with various ornaments of bronze, bone and stone: plaques, buttons, necklaces, pendants, mirrors, cowrie shells. The accompanying tools are rare: <b>Needles</b> and <b>needle</b> <b>beds,</b> knives and axes-celts. Even less common are weapons: arrowheads, daggers, bow end caps. In some graves are horse harnesses, whip handles. There are bronze objects, fewer iron and precious metals.|$|R
50|$|Mycena strobilinoides, {{commonly}} known as the scarlet fairy helmet, is a species of agaric fungus in the family Mycenaceae. It is found in North America, where it fruits scattered or in dense groups on <b>needle</b> <b>beds</b> and moss. The mushroom is more common in western than eastern North America, and it prefers to grow at elevations greater than 2500 ft in montane locales. It has amyloid, ellipsoid spores measuring 7-9 by 4-5 μm.|$|R
500|$|The fruit {{bodies of}} Mycena flavoalba grow {{scattered}} to densely gregarious on <b>needle</b> <b>beds</b> under conifers, and on humus in oak woods during the autumns months. Although generally rare, the species sometimes occurs {{in large quantities}} in certain localities. In the United States, it has been collected from Colorado, Idaho, Michigan, North Carolina, Oregon, Washington, Wyoming, Florida, and Kansas. It {{is also found in}} Europe, and Israel. The species is listed as [...] "Least Concern" [...] in the Danish Red Data Book.|$|R
40|$|Warp {{knitting}} {{is always}} performed on flat (linear) knitting machines. A circular warp-knitting machine is recently {{made possible by}} using a novel concept of a conical <b>needle</b> <b>bed</b> and patterning cams with enclosed cam followers to drive the patterning rings. This also requires a mechanical linkage to transmit the motion from the patterning cam to the patterning rings, which is prone to vibration at undesirable levels. A new generation design replaces the mechanical cam and linkage with high-speed AC brushless servomotors enabling limitless precision patterning possibilities. A method of selecting servomotors based on minimising the power required to perform the fastest motion required for a given application is reported. This method ensures cost minimising by selecting the smallest servomotor suitable for a given application. A circular warp-knitting machine using servomotor to drives selected using the method reported is designed, built and successfully tested...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the areas}} of medical textile is the spacer knitted {{orthopaedic}} products. The concept of compression therapy of orthopaedic supports lies on a simple and efficient mechanical principle – it consists of applying elastic garment around the limb. Spacer orthopaedic supports are knitted on flat knitting machines equipped with especial elastomeric thread feeder. Compression made by the support depends on the support area, shape and characteristics of knitting. Because of orthopaedic supports are intended for durable wearing and need to vouchsafe compression of fixed value, {{it is very important}} to known how processes acting during exploitation influence alteration of compression values. The aim of this study was to establish the alteration of compression of knitted support during exploitation, i. e. after multifold extension, washing and drying. The samples were knitted on a flat double <b>needle</b> <b>bed</b> knitting machine in combined jacquard-laid-in pattern with elastomeric weft threads. It was established that compressive properties of knits after cyclic tensile load changed slightly, i. e. range between margins of error. It was measured that knitted orthopaedic supports dimensions and density after washing and drying cycles changes significant, i. e. knitted supports shrinks and thickens and their compression decreases.

40|$|Pine needles, {{which are}} abundantly found as underexploited biomass in {{coniferous}} forests, {{are responsible for}} fire hazards and air pollution. Utilization of pine needles as bed material in lactic acid production with solid state fermentation (SSF) has been studied here. This investigation compared lactic acid production by pure strains of Lactobacilli, (1) L. delbrueckii (NCIM 2025); (2) L. pentosus (NCIM 2912); (3) Lactobacillus sp. (NCIM 2734); (4) Lactobacillus sp. (NCIM 2084); and a co-culture {{of the first two}} strains. The studies required 6 g per flask powdered dry pine needles as bed material, 2 g/L (inoculum), liquid production media based on pure glucose or whey substituted glucose, at 60, 80, and 120 g/L sugar levels, 37 oC, and an initial pH of 6. 5. Co-culture attained a maximum lactic acid concentration of 45. 10 g/L, followed by that of strain- 1, 43. 87 g/L and strain- 4, 26. 15 g/L, in 80 g/L pure glucose media. With 120 g/L total sugar in whey-substituted media, the co-culture attained maximum lactic acid production of 44. 88 g/L followed by that of strain- 1, 43. 67 g/L. The present experimental studies indicated better compatibility of pine <b>needle</b> <b>bed</b> with co-culture in solid state fermentation of lactic acid, which may prove to be an eco-friendly technology for utilization of biomass as well as minimizing fires in coniferous forests...|$|E
500|$|Another Mycena that {{produces}} a reddish latex is Mycena sanguinolenta, the [...] "terrestrial bleeding Mycena". It may be distinguished from M.haematopus in several ways: it is smaller, with cap diameters between [...] wide; grows in groups rather than clusters; is found on leaves, dead branches, moss <b>beds</b> and pine <b>needle</b> <b>beds</b> rather than decaying wood; and the edges of its gills are consistently dark brownish-red. Furthermore, range of cap color in M.sanguinolenta is different than in M.haematopus, varying from reddish-to orange-brown, and it lacks a band of partial veil remnants hanging from the margin.|$|R
50|$|Knitting fibre preforms can be {{done with}} the {{traditional}} methods of Warp and Weft Knitting, and the fabric produced is often regarded by many as two-dimensional fabric, but machines with two or more <b>needle</b> <b>beds</b> are capable of producing multilayer fabrics with yams that traverse between the layers. Developments in electronic controls for needle selection and knit loop transfer, and in the sophisticated mechanisms that allow specific areas of the fabric to be held and their movement controlled. This has allowed the fabric to form itself into the required three-dimensional preform shape with a minimum of material wastage.|$|R

40|$|Calorimetry, {{the science}} of {{measuring}} heat from chemical reactions and physical changes, is one to the most valuable tools fire safety engineering have at their disposal. Calorimetric devices such as the cone calorimeter and the fire propagation apparatus (FPA) give us the means to evaluate and understand how different materials burn at a small scale. Due to fire being affected by many different environmental factors, these devices help us to isolate and examine how each factor affects fire {{as a whole and}} be able to apply this knowledge to tools that can be used at larger scales. This thesis reports various pieces of work on different calorimetric studies done on cellulosic material used in today’s natural and built environment. All experimental tests herein are done using the FPA, {{the state of the art}} calorimeter for fire safety studies. The experimental techniques presented here show how invaluable calorimetry is in giving us key insights on the combustion dynamics of fire related processes. The thesis is presented in manuscript style. Each chapter is a stand alone research work intended for publication with the exception of the first and last chapter; intended to introduce these and their relevance to the science and the last to summarize on overall findings and recommended improvements. Chapter 2 presents a study on the burning of live and dead pine needles. Pine forests present a relatively high flammability risk comprised in great part by pine needles. Different moisture content, flow conditions and their interrelationship is studied on the different parameters affecting the combustion processes. Overall, the results show that fire physics and chemistry vary with fuel and flow conditions and that moisture content is not the only difference between live and dead fuels but that the <b>needle</b> <b>bed</b> physiochemical mechanisms matter as well. This is the first time calorimetry data is presented on the burning of live and dead pine needles. Chapter 3 complements chapter 2 with an added in-depth analysis on the effect of different pine needle species, fuel load and imposed heat insult. Interrelationship between these variables is shown to have a strong effect on the overall combustion process. Fuel load is shown to be an essential condition to know as it gives a direct indication on the intensity of the fire. Flow is shown to have a varied effect depending on the fuel load, it can either aid or be detrimental to the overall combustion process especially relating to ignition times. Chapter 4 is a study on the effect of leaf morphology to flammability of different natural fuels. This study is a direct extension of the work presented in the paper Belcher et al (2010) in Nature Geoscience. Representative natural fuel samples from the Triassic/Jurassic Boundary, a time period of great importance because it marked a time of major environmental changes, are used to evaluate fire activity as a whole during this time period. The study shows that smaller leaf area and larger surface area to volume ratio show a strong correlation to an increase in flammability of these fuels. The research presents new insight into how leaf morphology can be used as a tool to assess the effect of fire activity around the globe and how closely vegetation is linked to this. Chapter 5 presents a study on flammability of chipboard. Wood being an inhomogeneous, non isotropic material presents researchers with a complex problem due to its burning behavior. Wood has been a preferred construction material since far back and is widely used in construction today. Different oxygen levels, heat insults, material thicknesses and densities and the interrelationship between these variables are assessed to observe the effect on the flammability of chipboard. Density and thickness is shown to have little effect on the overall burning dynamics with thermally thick samples apart from the increased fuel content. Oxygen levels and imposed heat insults, however, show a wide range of effects and the interrelationship proves to be quite important during the combustion process. The research outlines how char formation is affected by the different variables and how important this process becomes along the overall combustion process. Calorimetric studies are presented that illustrate the use of these devices to study the effect of varying environmental conditions and the importance of their interrelationships on both natural and built environment fuels. The works highlight the importance of first establishing the dynamics of the combustion process in order to be able to extract combustion parameters that are needed for modeling fires better in both wildland and built environments...|$|E

The effect described was obtained by combining three knitted layers with the use of different reports and the number of monofilament threads knitted-in, and by modifying the knitted layers with elastomer threads.

A multiphase {{approach has been}} implemented in OpenFOAM, {{which is based on}} the FireFOAM solver for large eddy simulations (LES). Conservation equations are averaged in a control volume containing a gas and a solid phase. Drying, pyrolysis, and char oxidation are described by interaction between the two phases. Numerical simulations are compared to laboratory experiments carried out with porous pine <b>needle</b> <b>beds</b> in the FM Global Fire Propagation Apparatus (FPA). These experiments are used to support the use and the development of submodels that represent heat transfer, pyrolysis, gas-phase combustion, and smoldering processes. The model is tested for different bulk densities, two distinct species and two different radiative heat fluxes used to heat up the samples. It has been possible to reproduce mass loss rates, heat release rates, and temperatures that agree with experimental observations, and to highlight the current limitations of the model...|$|R

Various weft machines can be configured to produce textiles from a single spool of yarn or multiple spools {{depending on the size}} of the machine cylinder (where the <b>needles</b> are <b>bedded).</b> In a warp knit there are many pieces of yarn and there are vertical chains, zigzagged together by crossing the Cotton yarn.|$|R
40|$|Understanding {{the burning}} {{behaviour}} of litter fuels is essential before developing a {{complete understanding of}} wildfire spread. The challenge of predicting the fire behaviour of such fuels arises from their porous nature and from the strong coupling of the physico-chemical complexities of the fuel with the surrounding environment, which controls the burning dynamics. In this work, a method is presented to accurately understand the processes which control the burning behaviour of a wildland fuel layer using numerical simulations coupled with laboratory experiments. Simulations are undertaken with ForestFireFOAM, a modification of FireFOAM that uses a Large Eddy Simulation solver to represent porous fuel by implementing a multiphase formulation to conservation equations (mass, momentum, and energy). This approach allows the fire- induced behaviour of a porous, reactive and radiative medium to be simulated. Conservation equations are solved in an averaged control volume at a scale su cient to contain both coexisting gas and solid phases, considering strong coupling between the phases. Processes such as drying, pyrolysis, and char combustion are described through temperature-dependent interaction between the solid and gas phases. Di↵erent sub-models for heat transfer, pyrolysis, gas combustion, and smouldering have been implemented and tested to allow better representation of these combustion processes. Numerical simulations are compared with experiments undertaken in a controlled environment using the FM Global Fire Propagation Apparatus. Pine <b>needle</b> <b>beds</b> of varying densities and surface to volume ratios were subject to radiative heat fluxes and flows to interrogate the ignition and combustion behaviour. After including modified descriptions of the heat transfer, degradation, and combustion models, it is shown that key flammability parameters of mass loss rates, heat release rates, gas emissions and temperature fields agree well with experimental observations. Using this approach, {{we are able to}} provide the appropriate modifications to represent the burning behaviour of complex wildland fuels in a range of conditions representative of real fires. It is anticipated that this framework will support larger-scale model development and optimisation of fire simulations of wildland fuels...|$|R

40|$|Smoke from {{prescribed}} burns can occasionally cause {{significant reduction}} in visibility on highways in the southern United States. Visibility reduction to less than three meters has been coined “superfog” and initial conditions for its formation have been developed previously. Accurate characterization and prediction of precursor conditions for superfog is needed to prevent dangerous low visibility situations when planning prescribed burns. It has been hypothesized that extremely hygroscopic cloud condensation nuclei from the smoldering phase of a fire can produce {{a large number of}} droplets smaller in size than in naturally occurring fog producing superfog conditions at relatively low liquid water content. A thermodynamics-based model for fog formation was developed. Laboratory generated superfog measured by a Phase Doppler Particle Analyzer determined that mean droplet radius was 1. 5 μm and the size distribution could be modeled as a log normal distribution. Experiments in an environmentally-conditioned wind tunnel using longleaf pine <b>needle</b> fuel <b>beds</b> provided visibility, heat flux, temperature, humidity, and particle production data for model verification. Numerical modeling was used to approximate the growth of a superfog boundary layer with C H 2 O values of 2 g m - 3 or greater in the Superfog Analysis Model (SAM) which successfully predicted previous superfog events...|$|R
