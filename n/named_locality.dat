50|$|An {{ironically}} <b>named</b> <b>locality</b> {{nearby is}} known as North Pole (21° 05' S. 119° 22' E.), no doubt for its heat. It is the location of rock formations considered to have evidence that puts {{the origin of life}} on earth back to 3,400-3,500 million years ago, due to stromatolites in particular rock sequences. However this is disputed, and it is argued that stromatolites older than 3,200 mya are not the result of living organisms (the definition of stromatolites includes both living and abiotic causes), the small conical structures in the Strelley Pool formation (Warrawoona Group) being formed by evaporation and a dome structure from the North Pole chert (also Warrawoona Group) being formed by soft-sediment deformation.|$|E
5000|$|Private Acts {{are either}} local or {{personal}} in their effect, applying to a specifically <b>named</b> <b>locality</b> or legal {{person in a}} manner different from all others. Private bills are [...] "usually promoted by organisations, like local authorities or private companies, to give themselves powers beyond, or in conflict with, the general law. Private bills only change the law {{as it applies to}} specific individuals or organisations, rather than the general public. Groups or individuals potentially affected by these changes can petition Parliament against the proposed bill and present their objections to committees of MPs and Lords." [...] They include acts to confer powers on certain local authorities, a recent example being the Canterbury City Council Bill, which makes provisions relating to street trading and consumer protection in the city. Private bills can also affect certain companies; the Northern Bank Bill allowed the statutory right of Northern Bank to issue bank notes to be transferred following a takeover of the company by Danske Bank. Other private bills may affect particular companies established by Act of Parliament such as TSB Bank and Transas.|$|E

40|$|Recently, Sparse Representation-based Classification (SRC) has {{attracted}} {{a lot of attention}} for its applications to various tasks, especially in biometric techniques such as face recognition. However, factors such as lighting, expression, pose and disguise variations in face images will decrease the performances of SRC and most other face recognition techniques. In order to overcome these limitations, we propose a robust face recognition method <b>named</b> <b>Locality</b> Constrained Joint Dynamic Sparse Representation-based Classification (LCJDSRC) in this paper. In our method, a face image is first partitioned into several smaller sub-images. Then, these sub-images are sparsely represented using the proposed locality constrained joint dynamic sparse representation algorithm. Finally, the representation results for all sub-images are aggregated to obtain the final recognition result. Compared with other algorithms which process each sub-image of a face image independently, the proposed algorithm regards the local matching-based face recognition as a multi-task learning problem. Thus, the latent relationships among the sub-images fro...|$|E
40|$|It is {{important}} and challenging to make the growing image repositories easy to search and browse. Image clustering is a technique that helps in several ways, including image data preprocessing, user interface designing, and search result representation. Spectral clustering method {{has been one of}} the most promising clustering methods in the last few years, because it can cluster data with complex structure, and the (near) global optimum is guaranteed. However, existing spectral clustering algorithms, like Normalized Cut, are difficult to handle data points out of training set. In this paper, we propose a clustering algorithm <b>named</b> <b>Locality</b> Preserving Clustering (LPC), which shares many of the data representation properties of nonlinear spectral method. Yet LPC provides an explicit mapping function which is defined everywhere, both on training data points and testing points. Experimental results show that LPC is more accurate than both “direct Kmeans ” and “PCA + Kmeans”. We also show that LPC produces in general comparable results with Normalized Cut, yet is more efficient than Normalized Cut...|$|E
