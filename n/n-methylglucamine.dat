40|$|ABSTRACT The aim of {{this study}} was to verify whether {{enalapril}} and captopril would reverse the renal damage caused by <b>N-methylglucamine</b> antimoniate in C 57 BL/ 6 mice. We used inbred C 57 BL/ 6 female mice, obtained from the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (FIOCRUZ), Salvador, BA. The mice were divided into four groups as follows: Group 1 : received saline by the intramuscular (IM) route; Group 2 : received <b>N-methylglucamine</b> antimonate (IM); Group 3 : received <b>N-methylglucamine</b> antimoniate and captopril; Group 4 : was treated with <b>N-methylglucamine</b> antimoniate and enalapril. Both enalapril and captopril were orally administered in drinking water (ad libitum). After 30 days of treatment, the animals were sacrificed and their kidneys were collected for histological analysis which showed that enalapril completely reversed the edema, the podocytes hyperplasia and nucleus of the epithelial cells in the proximal convoluted tubules caused by <b>N-methylglucamine</b> antimoniate. On the other hand, the captopril treatment partially inhibited kidney harmful effects caused by N-metilgucamina antimoniate. Taken together, we would conclude that enalapril and captopril reverse edema and renalhyperplasia caused by <b>N-methylglucamine</b> antimonate in mice...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT INTRODUCTION Despite {{their high}} toxicity, antimonials and {{amphotericin}} B deoxycholate {{are commonly used}} for treating visceral leishmaniasis (VL). Few studies showing conflictive data about their efficacy and adverse events in pediatric population are available. This study aimed to evaluate efficacy and safety of amphotericin B deoxycholate vs. that of <b>N-methylglucamine</b> antimoniate in treating pediatric VL in Brazil. METHODS This was a randomized, open-label, 2 -arm and controlled pilot clinical trial. Treatment naïve children and adolescents with VL without signs of severe illness were treated with <b>N-methylglucamine</b> antimoniate (20 mg/kg/day for 20 days) or amphotericin B deoxycholate (1 mg/kg/day for 14 days). All patients were diagnosed with positive direct examination and/or positive PCR for Leishmania spp. performed in bone marrow samples. The primary efficacy end-point was VL cure determined after 180 days of completion of treatment. The analysis was performed using intention-to-treat (ITT) and per protocol (PP) analyses. RESULTS In total, 101 volunteers were assessed. Efficacy was similar for both groups. The antimonial (n= 51) and amphotericin B groups (n= 50) had a cure rate of 94. 1 % and 100 %, and 94 % and 97. 9 % according to ITT and PP analyses, respectively. All patients reported adverse events (AE). Serious AE incidence was similar in both groups. Five individuals {{were excluded from the}} study because of severe adverse events.

40|$|Ten 2 -substituted {{quinoline}} alkaloids {{isolated from}} a plant used {{for treatment of}} New World cutaneous leishmaniasis have antileishmanial in vitro activities against the extracellular forms of Leishmania spp. BALB/c mice infected with Leishmania amazonensis PH 8 or H- 142 or Leishmania venezuelensis were treated 1 day after the parasitic infection with a quinoline alkaloid (100 mg/kg of body weight per day) or with reference drug <b>N-methylglucamine</b> antimonate (Glucantime) (56 mg of pentavalent antimony [Sbv] per kg per day) for 14 days. Lesion development was the criterium used to assess disease severity. Two three-carbon chain quinolines [2 -n-propylquinoline and 2 -(1 ', 2 '-trans-epoxypropyl) quinoline (chimanine D) ] were more potent than <b>N-methylglucamine</b> antimonate against L. amazonensis PH 8, and five quinoline alkaloids [2 -(3, 4 -methylenedioxyphenylethyl) quinoline, cusparine, 2 -(3, 4 -dimethoxyphenylethyl) quinoline, 2 -(E) -prop- 1 '-enylquinoline (chimanine B), and skimmianine] were {{as effective as the}} reference drug. Single treatment near the site of infection, 14 days after infection with L. amazonensis, with 2 -n-propylquinoline or chimanine B reduced the severity of lesions but less notably than <b>N-methylglucamine</b> antimonate. 2 -n-Propylquinoline exhibited significant activity against the virulent strain L. venezuelensis.

40|$|A novel sorbent was {{prepared}} by the functionalization of an inorganic support material, MCM- 41, with <b>N-methylglucamine</b> for the uptake of boron from aqueous solutions prior to its determination by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP–OES). Characterization of the newly synthesized material was performed using BET, XRD, TEM, SEM and DRIFTS techniques, {{in addition to its}} C and N elemental content. Sorption behavior of the novel sorbent for boron was also investigated and found to obey Freundlich and Dubinin–Radushkevich (D–R) isotherm models. The maximum amount of B (as H 3 BO 3) that can be sorbed by the sorbent was calculated from the D–R isotherm and was found to be 0. 8 mmol B g− 1 of sorbent. The applicability of the new sorbent for the removal/preconcentration of boron from aqueous samples was examined by batch method. It was found that the sorbent can take up 85 % of boron in 5 min whereas quantitative sorption is obtained in 30 min. Any pH greater than 6 can be used for sorption. Desorption from the sorbent was carried out using 1. 0 M HNO 3. The sorption efficiency of the new sorbent was also compared to that of Amberlite IRA 743, a commercial resin with <b>N-methylglucamine</b> functional groups. Within the experimental conditions employed, the new sorbent was found to have higher sorption efficiency than the commercial resin.

The reference drug, <b>N-methylglucamine</b> antimonate (Glucantime), was administered by subcutaneous or intralesional injection (regimens of 14, 28, or 56 mg of pentavalent antimony per kg of body weight daily). Twice-daily oral treatment with chimanine B at 50 mg/kg resulted in a decrease in lesion weight by 70 % (P < 0. 001) {{and a decrease in}} the parasite loads by 95 % (P < 0. 001). Five injections of chimanine B at intervals of 4 days reduced the lesion weight by 74 % and the parasite loads in the lesion by 90 % compared with the values for the group of untreated mice. Subcutaneous administration of <b>N-methylglucamine</b> antimonate at 28 mg of pentavalent antimony kg per day for 15 days reduced the parasite burden by 95 % (P < 0. 001) and five intralesional injections at the same concentration reduced the parasite burden by 96 % (P < 0. 001).

[Ca 2 +]i was measured by digital fluorescence imaging in cells loaded with fura- 2. ATP (100 μm) applied {{for a short period}} of time (6 s) caused a rise in [Ca 2 +]i from 127 ± 3 (n = 290) to 797 ± 25 nm, which then declined to the resting level, with a t½ (time required for [Ca 2 +]i to decline to half of peak [Ca 2 +]i) of 5. 4 ± 0. 09 s. This effect was independent of external Ca 2 + and could be abolished by previously discharging the Ca 2 + pool of the endoplasmic reticulum with thapsigargin (1 μm). Application of thapsigargin (1 μm) or cyclopiazonic acid (10 μm) to inhibit the Ca 2 +-ATPase of the endoplasmic reticulum 6 s prior to ATP application did not influence the peak [Ca 2 +]i but greatly reduced the rate of decline of [Ca 2 +]i, with t½ values of 15 ± 1. 6 and 23 ± 3 s, respectively. In the absence of external Na+ (Na+ replaced by Li+ or <b>N-methylglucamine)</b> the basal [Ca 2 +]i was slightly elevated (152 ± 6 nm) and the restoration of [Ca 2 +]i after the ATP stimulation was significantly slower (t½, 7. 3 ± 0. 46 s in Li+ medium, 8. 12 ± 0. 4 s in <b>N-methylglucamine</b> medium). The external Na+-dependent component of the [Ca 2 +]i sequestration was also demonstrated in cells stimulated by ATP subsequent to addition of cyclopiazonic acid; in a Na+-free medium [Ca 2 +]i remained at the peak level in 88 % of the cells after stimulation with ATP. Addition of monensin (10 μm) in the presence of external Na+ increased the resting [Ca 2 +]i to 222 ± 9 nm over ∼ 1 min and subsequent removal of extracellular sodium resulted in a further increase in [Ca 2 +]i to a peak of 328 ± 11 nm, which was entirely dependent on external Ca 2 +. These findings indicate that a functional Na+–Ca 2 + exchanger is present at the blood-brain barrier, which plays a significant role in shaping the stimulation-evoked [Ca 2 +]i signal and is able to work in reverse mode under pharmacological conditions...|$|E

The chemical fingerprint of SSPHE by high-performance liquid chromatography with diode-array detection and tandem mass spectrometry showed the presence of biflavonoids and high molecular weight phenylpropanoid glycosides. These compounds may have a synergistic action in vivo. Histopathological study revealed that the intralesional treatment with SSPHE induced an intense inflammatory infiltrate, composed mainly of mononuclear cells. The present findings reinforce the potential of this natural product as a source of future drug candidates for American cutaneous leishmaniasis...|$|E
40|$|The {{ion channel}} probe {{phencyclidine}} [1 -(1 -phenylcyclohexyl) piperidine; PCP] selectively inhibited aggregation, secretion and ultrastructural changes in platelets induced by adrenaline, {{but did not}} affect activation induced by other common platelet agonists such as alpha-thrombin, ADP, collagen or ionophore A 23187. [3 H]PCP bound to platelets with high affinity (Kd 134 +/- 33 nM; 3600 +/- 1020 sites/platelet), as did the thienyl analogue [3 H]TCP (1 -[1 -(2 -thienyl) cyclohexyl]piperidine). PCP binding to platelets was increased 3 - 4 -fold in <b>N-methylglucamine</b> buffer {{in the absence of}} Na+ ions. Binding was unaffected by haloperidol and was only weakly inhibited (EC 50 10 - 20 microM), without significant stereoselectivity by the two sets of stereoselective ligands, dexoxadrol/levoxadrol and (+) MK 801 /(-) MK 801. Binding of PCP was not competed for by adrenaline or yohimbine. Only the high-affinity binding of [3 H]PCP to platelets was blocked by prior treatment of the platelets with the covalent affinity probe Metaphit, and these platelets no longer aggregated in response to adrenaline although they responded normally to alpha-thrombin, ADP and collagen. These results suggest that platelets contain high-affinity receptors for PCP that can modulate adrenaline-induced platelet activation...|$|E
40|$|Strophanthidin {{inhibits}} KATP {{channels in}} 2, 4 -dinitrophenol-poisoned heart cells (). The current {{study shows that}} the Na/K pump interacts with KATP current (IK-ATP) via submembrane ATP depletion in isolated giant membrane patches and in nonpoisoned guinea pig cardiac cells in whole-cell configuration. IK-ATP was inhibited by ATP, glibenclamide, or intracellular Cs+. Na/K pump inactivation by substitution of cytoplasmic Na+ for Li+ or <b>N-methylglucamine</b> decreased both IK-ATP by 1 / 3 (1 mM ATP, zero calcium), and IC 50 of ATP for IK-ATP (0. 3 +/- 0. 1 mM) by 2 / 5. The Na+/Li+ replacement {{had no effect on}} IK-ATP at low pump activity ([ATP] </= 0. 1 mM or 100 microM ouabain) or when IK-ATP was completely inhibited by 10 mM ATP. In whole-cell configuration, ouabain inhibited up to 60 % of inwardly rectifying IK-ATP at 1 mM ATP in the pipette but not at 10 mM ATP and 10 mM phosphocreatine when IK-ATP was always blocked. However, mathematical simulation of giant-patch experiments revealed that only 20 % of ATP depletion may be attributed to the ATP concentration gradient in the bulk solution, and the remaining 80 % probably occurs in the submembrane space...|$|E
40|$|Seventeen {{extracts}} {{and seven}} secondary metabolites isolated from basidiomycetes {{were tested in}} medium culture against promastigote forms of #Leishmania$ spp. and bloodstream forms of #Trypanosoma cruzi$. Extracts from the culture filtrate or mycelium were generally inactive against the parasites except the #Zucoagaricus$ genus mycelium extract which reduced by 47 % the number of bloodstream forms. Striatin A, striatin B and podoscyphic acid exhibited in vitro activity at 10, 5 and 100 micrograms/mL, respectively. One compound showed activity against bloodstream forms of #T. cruzi$, the sesquiterpenoid naematolin, lysing the parasites by 79 %. BALB/c mice infected with #L. amazonensis$ were treated three weeks post-infection with striatin A and striatin B by subcutaneous route for 15 days at 10 mg/kg daily. The reference drug, <b>N-methylglucamine</b> antimonate, administered by subcutaneous injections at 28 mg Sbv/kg/day for 15 days reduced the parasite burden by 71, 2 % (p< 0, 05). Subcutaneous administration of striatin A at 10 mg/kg produced a weak decrease of the parasite burdens in the footpad by 17, 6 %. The treatment with striatin B had no effect and showed higher toxicity than striatin A. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Extracellular ATP (ATPo) {{is known}} to be {{cytotoxic}} to many cell types through a mechanism which is largely unknown. Very recently this nucleotide has been shown to cause cell death by apoptosis, probably by interacting with specific cell-surface receptors. In the present study we have investigated the mechanism of ATPo-dependent cytotoxicity in the macrophage-like mouse cell line J 774. It has been previously reported that in this cell type ATPo activates trans-membrane Ca 2 + and Na+ fluxes and a drastic increase in the plasma-membrane permeability to hydrophilic solutes smaller than 900 Da. These changes are followed by cell swelling and lysis. We show in the present study that, although this nucleotide triggers a rise in the cytoplasmic Ca 2 + concentration, neither cell swelling nor lysis is Ca(2 +) -dependent. Furthermore, cell lysis is not dependent on Na+ influx, as it is not prevented by iso-osmotic replacement of extracellular Na+ with choline or <b>N-methylglucamine.</b> On the contrary, ATPo-dependent cytotoxicity, but not the ATPo-dependent increase in plasma-membrane permeability, is completely abrogated in sucrose medium. Under our experimental conditions ATPo does not cause DNA fragmentation in J 774 cells. We conclude from these findings that ATPo does not cause apoptosis of J 774 macrophages and promotes a Ca(2 +) - and Na(+) -independent colloido-osmotic lysis...|$|E
40|$|Extraction {{of boron}} from aqueous {{solutions}} using selective resins {{is important in}} a variety of applications including desalination, ultrapure water production, and nuclear power generation. Today’s commercial boron-selective resins are exclusively prepared by functionalization of styrene-divinylbenzene (STY-DVB) beads with <b>N-methylglucamine</b> to produce resins with boron-chelating groups. However, such boron-selective resins have a limited binding capacity with a maximum free base content of 0. 7 eq/L, which corresponds to a sorption capacity of 1. 16 ± 0. 03 mMol/g in aqueous solutions with equilibrium boron concentration of ~ 70 mM. In this article, we describe the synthesis and characterization of a new resin that can selectively extract boron from aqueous solutions. We show that branched polyethylenimine (PEI) beads obtained from an inverse suspension process can be reacted with glucono- 1, 5 -d-lactone to afford a resin consisting of spherical beads with high density of boron-chelating groups. This resin has a sorption capacity of 1. 93 ± 0. 04 mMol/g in aqueous solution with equilibrium boron concentration of ~ 70 mM, which is 66 % percent larger than that of standard commercial STY-DVB resins. Our new boron-selective resin also shows excellent regeneration efficiency using a standard acid wash with a 1. 0 M HCl solution followed by neutralization with a 0. 1 M NaOH solution...|$|E
40|$|Currents {{activated}} by extracellular ATP were studied in single voltage- clamped bullfrog atrial cells. Rapid application of ATP elicited currents carried through two different conductance pathways: a rapidly desensitizing conductance reversing near - 10 mV, and a maintained, inwardly rectifying conductance reversing near - 85 mV. ATP activated the desensitizing component of current with a K 1 / 2 of approximately 50 microM and the maintained component with a K 1 / 2 of approximately 10 microM. Both types of current were {{activated by}} ATP {{but not by}} adenosine, AMP, or ADP. The desensitizing current was selectively inhibited by alpha, beta-methylene ATP, and the maintained, inwardly rectifying current was selectively suppressed by extracellular Cs. The desensitizing component of current was greatly reduced when extracellular Na was replaced by <b>N-methylglucamine,</b> but was slightly augmented when Na was replaced by Cs. GTP, ITP, and UTP were all ineffective in activating the desensitizing current, and {{of a variety of}} ATP analogues, only ATP-gamma-S was effective. Addition of EGTA or BAPTA to the intracellular solution did not obviously affect the desensitizing current. Fluctuation analysis of currents through the desensitizing conductance suggested that current is carried through ionic channels with a small (less than pS) unitary conductance...|$|E
40|$|To explore {{possible}} pathways for anions {{to enter}} the xylem in the root during the transport of salts to the shoot, we used the patch-clamp method on protoplasts prepared from the xylem parenchyma of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) plants. K+ currents were suppressed by tetraethylammonium or <b>N-methylglucamine</b> in the solutions in the pipette and the bath, and the permeating anions were Cl− or NO 3 −. We recorded the activities of three distinct anion conductances: (a) an inwardly rectifying anion channel (X-IRAC), characterized by activation at hyperpolarization and open times of up to several seconds; (b) a quickly activating anion conductance (X-QUAC), important for anion efflux at voltages between − 50 mV and the equilibrium potential of the prevailing anion; and (c) a slowly activating anion conductance (X-SLAC), activating above − 100 mV. Both X-IRAC and X-QUAC were permeable for Cl− and NO 3 −; X-QUAC was also permeable for malate. The occurrence of X-IRAC became more frequent {{with an increase in}} cytoplasmic Ca 2 +, while the occurrence of X-QUAC decreased. Anion currents through X-SLAC, and particularly through X-QUAC, were estimated to be large enough to account for reported rates of xylem loading, which is in accordance with the notion that xylem loading is a passive process...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The study {{sought to}} analyze {{clinical}} and epidemiological aspects of cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) in Xapuri, Acre, Brazil. Data from 2008 to 2014 registered in the notification records of the disease of the Information System of the Complaints of Notification (SINAN), and the data of the Information Department of the Unified Health System (DATASUS) available from 2007 to 2013 were used and analyzed {{in the light of}} the statistics of the temporal series by the Prais-Winsten method and chi-squared test. A total of 906 cases were registered with 60. 2 % occurring in men and 39. 7 % in women. The groups from 0 to 4 years of age (48. 0 %) and from 5 to 19 years of age (23. 3 %) were the most affected. Regarding the clinical forms, 77. 7 % presented CL and 22. 3 % mucocutaneous leishmaniasis (MCL). Among the 896 cases with information on the diagnostic methods used, Montenegro’s skin test predominated (66. 4 %), with a positive result of 95. 8 % for CL and 99. 3 % for MCL. Treatment with <b>N-methylglucamine</b> antimony was performed in 99. 4 % of the cases, but discontinuously used in the majority of patients. This study presents information which may be used as a tool for the epidemiological surveillance and control of the disease in Xapuri, a region which depends essentially on forest resources and ecological tourism...|$|E
40|$|Protein {{modification}} due to S-glutathio(ny) lation, {{usually a}} reversible process in intact cells, arises interest {{as a possible}} mode of regulatory events that may potentially modify {{a large number of}} cellular processes. However, since less than 1 % of the total protein is S-thiolated in resting cells, high sensitivity methods are required for its evaluation. We set up a new method by CE with LIF detection that allows to measure all forms of intracellular GSH involved in the process. For total and reduced glutathione, cell lysates were rapidly derivatized by 5 -iodoacetoamidofluorescein (5 -IAF), a selective reagent which traps thiol groups, thus minimizing auto-oxidation. Derivatized samples were separated in a 47 cm× 75 μ m id capillary by using 7 mmol/L sodium phosphate at pH 11. 6. For the evaluation of S -glutathio(ny) lation, intracellular proteins from cell lysates were precipitated and washed to eliminate free GSH. After protein resuspension with NaOH and reduction treatment with tri- n -butylphosphine (TBP), the freed GSH was dried in a vacuum concentrator and directly dissolved in the derivatization mixture. GSH-IAF adduct was detected in a 6 mmol/L sodium phosphate, 3 mmol/L boric acid, and 75 mmol/L <b>N-methylglucamine</b> run buffer in less than 5 min. The high sensitivity ensured by 5 -IAF use and sample concentration, allowed to quantify GSH at levels as low as 5 nmol/L, value suitable for the evaluation of protein S-glutathio(ny) lation. The method suitability was checked both in HUVEC and ECV 304 cultured cells...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Leishmaniasis is {{classified}} into three clinical presentations: visceral, coetaneous and mucocutaneous. The latter is usually secondary to hematogenous spread after {{months or years}} of skin infection and can manifest as infiltrative lesions, ulcerated or vegetating in nose, pharynx, larynx and mouth, associated or not with ganglionics infarction. Laryngeal involvement {{is part of the}} differential diagnosis of lesions in this topography as nonspecific chronic laryngitis, granulomatosis and even tumors of the upper aerodigestive tract presenting atypical evolution. Sometimes it is difficult for the correct diagnosis of Leishmaniasis, with description of cases in the literature were conducted improperly. Objective: The objective {{of this study is to}} report a case of laryngeal Leishmaniasis addressing the difficulty of diagnosis, complications and treatment applied. Case Report: A patient with pain throat, dysphagia, odynophagia, dysphonia and weight loss, with no improvement with symptomatic medication. At telelaringoscopy, infiltrative lesion showed nodular supraglottis. He underwent a tracheotomy for airway obstruction and biopsy with immunohistochemical study for a definitive diagnosis of laryngeal Leishmaniasis. The patient was referred to the infectious diseases that initiated treatment with <b>N-methylglucamine</b> antimoniate with satisfactory response to therapy. Final Comments: Faced with a clinical suspicion of granulomatous diseases, it is essential to follow protocol laboratory evaluation associated with histological injury, to get a precise definition etiological without prolonging the time of diagnosis. Medical treatment for mucosal Leishmaniasis, recommended by the World Health Organization, was adequate in the case of laryngeal disorders, with complete resolution of symptoms...|$|E
