50|$|Percutaneous <b>nephrostomy</b> is an interventional radiology/surgical {{procedure}} {{in which the}} renal pelvis is punctured whilst using imaging as guidance.

Breast carcinoma metastatic to the bladder has been reported only sporadically. Most patients were symptomatic breast cancer with evidence of disseminated disease at the time of diagnosis. Metastasis usually occurred many years after diagnosis, and the prognosis was poor. We report a case of breast caricinoma metastasizing to the urinary bladder and retroperitoneum, which presented initially with acute renal failure.

40|$|Purpose We {{compared}} the long-term results of minimally invasive endourological intervention and open surgical revision {{in patients with}} a nonmalignant ureteroileal stricture. Materials and Methods We retrospectively evaluated the records of 74 patients (85 renal units) treated for unilateral or bilateral nonmalignant ureteroileal strictures. Overall, 96 endourological and 35 open surgical procedures were performed. Balloon dilatation and Acucise® or Ho:YAG laser endoureterotomy were used as minimally invasive endourological interventions. Open surgical revision with stricture resection and open ureteroileal end-to-side-reanastomosis was the alternate therapy. Treatment success was defined as radiological normalization or improvement of upper urinary tract morphology combined with absent flank pain, infection, ureteral stents or percutaneous <b>nephrostomies.</b> Results Median followup was 29 months (range 2 to 177).

40|$|Abstract Introduction Hematuria {{has been}} {{described}} following bladder drainage in 2 % to 16 % of high-pressure chronic urinary retention treatments by decompression and is generally self-limiting. We describe a case of significant bilateral upper urinary tract hematuria following drainage of high-pressure chronic retention. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, the only similar case reported in the literature was in 1944. Case presentation An 82 -year-old Caucasian man was referred to our department with nocturnal enuresis and a palpable bladder. He was catheterized, produced a residual volume of 2900 mL, and ended up becoming oliguric. Following investigations, he had bilateral <b>nephrostomies.</b> He was discharged 18 [*]days after presentation. Conclusions Clinicians should keep in mind the presentation discussed in this case report to be able to swiftly manage this extremely rare complication of decompression in patients with high-pressure chronic retention. </p...|$|R
40|$|Ileal conduit {{remains a}} widely used urinary {{diversion}} performed after radical cystectomy. However, complications of ileal conduits remain an important concern in urological surgery. We report a rare {{case of an}} ileal conduit stricture, which can have grim complications if unob-served during the operation. Following an initial operation of radical cystectomy and ileal conduit formation in France in 2011, an 80 -year-old male travelled back to the UK after 4 months of general weakness and limb paralysis. Initial blood test shows life-threatening hyperkalemia and worsened renal function. Subsequent ultrasound KUB scan and loopogram revealed obstructive uropathy. The initial management includes intravenous antibiotics and bilateral <b>nephrostomies</b> were inserted to aid diversion of urine. A thorough surgical ex-ploration revealed a twisted, fibrous mesenteric band adhered to the proximal part of the ileal conduit. Only one case report of ileal conduit stenosis was described many years after the procedure...|$|R
40|$|The {{patient was}} a 49 -year-old male. He {{had a history}} of {{asymptomatic}} hematuria that had occurred 3 years previously. The hematuria and pollakisuria developed again from about March, 1989, and he was hospitalized for bladder tamponade in April. Bilateral percutaneous <b>nephrostomies</b> were performed because a contracted bladder and bilateral hydronephrosis were detected. He was then admitted to our hospital on June 21. The cause of the contracted bladder was not evident, despite extensive examination. A replacement ileocystoplasty constructed by Shishido's method was used to replace the contracted bladder. A U-shape pouch was prepared by detubularization of 25 cm of the ileum and this pouch was anastomosed to the incised end of the bladder neck after subtotal cystectomy. The ureter and ileum were then anastomosed using Coffey's method. The bladder capacity and the maximum urinary flow rate after 1 year were 350 ml and 13 ml/sec, respectively, and residual urine was not noted after urination even following abdominal pressure. Urinary incontinence was not noted either...|$|R

40|$|The case is {{reported}} of a 10 -yr-old girl who developed intractable hematuria from hemorrhagic cystitis following chemotherapy for a malignant lymphoma. Following the intravesical instillation of formalin, which controlled the hematuria, she developed oliguria attributable to ureteric stenosis and fibrotic contraction of the renal pelves. Bilateral <b>nephrostomies</b> were constructed, but recurrent pyelonephritis and further renal pelvic obstruction developed. A series of renal biopsies and ultimately bilateral nephrectomy revealed severe, chronic interstitial nephritis, massive renal interstitial accumulation of deposits probably containing Tamm-Horsfall protein and, {{in the left}} nephrectomy specimen, a florid interstitial chronic granulomatous inflammatory reaction. Although ureterohydronephrosis {{has been described by}} others as a complication of the intravesical instillation of formalin, fibrotic contraction of the upper urinary tract and the florid interstitial nephritis with granulomata as described herein have not previously been reported.

40|$|BACKGROUND: A few {{single case}} reports {{and only one}} {{clinical}} series have been published so far {{about the use of}} N-butyl- 2 -cyanoacrylate in the treatment of urinary fistulas persisting after conventional urinary drainage. CASE PRESENTATION: We treated five patients {{with a mean age of}} 59. 2 years presenting iatrogenic urinary fistulas which persisted following conventional drainage manouvres. There were 3 calyceal fistulas following open, laparoscopic and robotic removal of renal lesions respectively, one pelvic fistula after orthotopic ileal neobladder and a bilateral dehiscence of uretero-sigmoidostomy. We used open-end catheters of different sizes adopting a retrograde endoscopic approach for cyanoacrylate injection in the renal calyces, while a descending percutaneous approach via the pelvic drain tract and bilateral <b>nephrostomies</b> respectively was used for the pelvic fistulas. Fluoroscopic control was always used during the occlusion procedures. The amount of adhesive injected ranged between 2 and 5 cc and in one case the procedure was repeated. With a median follow-up of 11 months we observed clinical and radiological resolution in 4 cases (80...|$|R
40|$|Using a Dornier HM 3 lithotripter, we treated 1, 000 {{patients}} with renal and ureteral stones from April, 1986 to July, 1989. They consisted of 612 solitary stones (pelvic stones, 152; calyceal stones, 167; ureteral stones, 293), 265 multiple stones and 123 staghorn calculi (complete, 48; partial, 75). The overall {{rate of the}} auxiliary procedure was 59. 3 % (pre-operative, 47. 9 %; post-operative, 11. 4 %). Pre-operative procedure included 430 catheterizations, 26 percutaneous <b>nephrostomies</b> (PNSs) and 23 pyelograms. Post-operative procedure included 69 transurethral lithotripsy, 21 PNSs, 26 percutaneous nephrolithotripsy (PNLs), 6 meatotomy, 5 chemolysis and 1 open surgery. 484 (68. 3 %) in 709 good follow-up cases were stone-free {{at the time of}} 3 months since the first extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy (ESWL). Complications were pain (34. 8 %), fever (4. 3 %), pain & fever (8. 5 %), subcapsular hematoma (0. 1 %) and ureteral obstruction (0. 1 %). Thus, ESWL {{is considered to be a}} useful means for renal and ureteral stones and in the case of large stone the combination therapy with PNL is more effective than ESWL-monotherapy...|$|R
5000|$|Pyelonephritis {{presents}} with fever, accelerated heart rate, painful urination, {{abdominal pain}} radiating to the back, nausea, and tenderness at the costovertebral angle on the affected side. Pyelonephritis that has progressed to urosepsis may {{be accompanied by}} signs of septic shock, including rapid breathing, decreased blood pressure, violent shivering, and occasionally delirium. Pyelonephritis requires antibiotic therapy, and sometimes surgical intervention such as ureteroscopy, percutaneous <b>nephrostomy</b> or percutaneous nephrolithotomy, as well as treatment of any underlying causes to prevent its recurrence. Xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis is a rare form of chronic pyelonephritis in which surgical removal of the kidney is usually necessary for definitive treatment. The term is from Greek πύελο|ς pýelo|s, [...] "basin" [...] + νεφρ|ός nepʰrós, [...] "kidney" [...] + suffix -itis suggesting [...] "inflammation".|$|E
50|$|Bowel {{obstruction}} can {{be treated}} with palliative surgery (colostomy, ileostomy, or internal bypass) or medicine, but surgery {{has been shown to}} increase survival time. Palliative surgery may result in short bowel syndrome, enterocutaneous fistula, or re-obstruction; or may not be possible due to the extent of obstruction. Other treatments of complications can include total parenteral nutrition, a low-residue diet, palliative gastrostomy, and adequate pain control. Bowel obstruction can also be treated with octreotide when palliative surgery is not an option. Cancer can also block the ureters, which can be relieved by a <b>nephrostomy</b> or a ureteric stent. Ascites can be relieved by repeated paracentesis or placement of a drain to increase comfort. Pleural effusions {{can be treated}} in a similar manner, with repeated thoracentesis, pleurodesis, or placement of a drain.|$|E
5000|$|Most stones under 5 mm pass spontaneously. Prompt surgery may, nonetheless, be {{required}} in persons {{with only one}} working kidney, bilateral obstructing stones, a urinary tract infection and thus, it is presumed, an infected kidney, or intractable pain. Beginning in the mid-1980s, less invasive treatments such as extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy, ureteroscopy, and percutaneous nephrolithotomy began to replace open surgery as the modalities of choice for the surgical management of urolithiasis. [...] More recently, flexible ureteroscopy has been adapted to facilitate retrograde <b>nephrostomy</b> creation for percutaneous nephrolithotomy. This approach is still under investigation, though early results are favorable. Percutaneous nephrolithotomy or, rarely, anatrophic nephrolithotomy, is the treatment of choice for large or complicated stones (such as calyceal staghorn calculi) or stones that cannot be extracted using less invasive procedures.|$|E
30|$|The {{representative}} of the Inter-American College of Radiology (CIR), M.Á. Pinochet Tejos, spoke about the organisation of IR in Latin America, about education and training, research, about professional status {{and the relationship between}} interventional and general radiology in clinical practice, about turf battles and the percentage of work time spent in IR. The data presented are based on surveys conducted by CIR in almost all Latin American member countries. IR procedures performed in CIR country members are: image-guided biopsies, visceral interventions (drainage of collections, biliary interventions, <b>nephrostomies,</b> etc.), vascular interventions, neuro-interventions and cardiac interventions. These interventional procedures are performed by radiologists as follows: image-guided biopsies, 92 %; visceral interventions, 86 %; vascular interventions, 69 %; neuro-interventions, 52 %; cardiac interventions, 2 %. Only 50 % of IR procedures are available on a 24  h per day and 7  days per week (24 / 7) basis. Regarding the inclusion of IR in the syllabus of radiology residency, the procedures in which the residents are trained are: biopsies, fluid collections drainages, and to a very small proportion biliary drainages, <b>nephrostomies</b> and angiographies. Seventy-eight percent of radiology residency programmes include IR, while 22 % do not include IR at all. Only 10 % of radiology residents choose IR as a main subspecialty for their future professional practice. Seventy-five percent of those surveyed considered residency training in IR and only 25 % considered it adequate. Changes proposed are fellowship training, specialisation and more dedication. There is no regulated research done in IR in Latin America. There are six interventional radiologists per 100 diagnostic radiologists in Latin America with an average of 29 interventional radiologists per country (in a range of 1 – 120). Regarding turf battles, in Latin America there is a constant loss of a space for IR in all areas, mainly {{due to the lack of}} training and interest of radiologists themselves. The total duration of the radiology residency programme is 36 – 48  months, of which 1 – 4  months are dedicated to training in IR. In conclusion, the main problems from the CIR’s point of view are the small number of interventional radiologists, insufficient dedication, radiation risks, higher working stress, limited training, lack of interest among young radiologists and lack of materials. CIR considers that there is a need to promote training in IR in Latin America, using the system of scholarships for radiologists interested in IR in order to facilitate the access to training centres, and to overcome the legal difficulties for the training.|$|R
30|$|G. Slater {{represented}} the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Radiologists (RANZCR) that has about 4, 000 members, including students, trainees and radiation oncologists. All radiologists {{are trained to}} perform simple IR procedures, like biopsies, drainages and <b>nephrostomies,</b> while complex interventions are restricted to members with subspecialty training. RANZCR provides support to two affiliated subspecialist groups, IRSA (Interventional Radiology Society of Australia) with 250 members and ANZSNR (Australian and New Zealand Society of Interventional Neuroradiology) with 60 members, mostly radiologists, but also a few interventional neurosurgeons and neurologists. A major advance has been {{the development of an}} IR Committee, which was established by the RANZCR board in 2016, focusing on the training, certification, subspecialty recognition and practice of IR. After certifying with RANZCR one needs an additional 2  years of training for IR and 3  years for interventional neuroradiology. Regarding IR in medical schools, some universities have a curriculum in clinical radiology and IR may be included, but there is no formal national programme. Australian interventional radiologists are included in several research trials, especially in areas of stroke management and vertebroplasty. Turf battles with vascular surgeons, cardiologists and other specialities are present as elsewhere. Very few Australian and New Zealand radiologists are full-time interventional radiologists or interventional neuroradiologists.|$|R
30|$|B.E. González Ulloa {{spoke on}} behalf of the Mexican Federation of Radiology and Imaging (FMRI). She gave a short {{overview}} of FMRI, which was founded in 1974 and currently counts 29 member societies. She reported on the survey carried out in Mexico already mentioned by M.Á. Pinochet Tejos, and mentioned that the FMRI used the same approach as the Inter-American College of Radiology to present comparable data. In Mexico, all IR procedures are available on a 24 / 7 basis. Regarding the inclusion of IR in the curriculum of radiology fellowship, the procedures in which the fellows are trained are: biopsies (100 %), drainage of fluid collections (100 %), biliary drainage (50 %), <b>nephrostomies</b> (65 %), angiography (80 %), embolisations (50 %), angioplasties/stentings (50 %). All radiology fellowship programmes include IR. However, only 7 % of radiology fellows choose IR as a main subspecialty for their future professional practice. Research is not always regulated. Only 140 interventional radiologists work in Mexico compared to 4, 100 diagnostic radiologists. The percentages of IR procedures that are performed by radiologists in Mexico are as follows: image-guided biopsies, 98 %; visceral-interventions, 90 %; vascular interventions, 80 %; neuro-interventions, 30 %; cardiac interventions, none. As in other Latin American countries, Mexicans think that IR training needs to be enhanced by promoting scholarships for radiologists interested in IR and facilitating the access to training centres.|$|R
