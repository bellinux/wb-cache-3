40|$|With {{the tourism}} sector now a {{significant}} {{contributor to the}} New Zealand economy ($ 5. 9 billion direct tourism value added in the year ended March 2003), and strong growth patterns forecast to continue for the 2003 - 2009 period, concerted attempts to manage <b>natural</b> <b>assets</b> must now not only be made, they must also have a degree of success. It is recognised that unlike the Department of Conservation (DoC), which has {{a high degree of}} 'ownership' of the <b>natural</b> <b>assets</b> that they manage, territorial and regional authorities tend to administer the <b>natural</b> <b>assets</b> within their jurisdiction. Consequently new and different approaches are needed from those used by DoC. This strengthening of focus on tourism represents a turning point for local and territorial authorities which have historically played a less active role in the tourism sector. An initial assessment of a sample of district and regional authority plans revealed that there were references to methods for dealing with a diversity of environmental issues, and this indicates in a very general way, the impacts of tourism on <b>natural</b> <b>assets</b> are being considered. It is recognised that until now territorial and regional authorities have had to work with a statutory framework that does not specifically take tourism into account, leading to a predominantly reactive approach to administering <b>natural</b> <b>assets.</b> The demands of a rapidly growing tourism sector, however, now require a more strategic and proactive approach. A raft of new enabling frameworks and processes is needed to focus resources on the impacts of tourism on <b>natural</b> <b>assets,</b> as well as ensuring that the tourism sector develops in a sustainable way...|$|R

These resources become assets when people have rights to access their benefits. Four strategies for natural asset-building are identified: investment to increase the total stock of natural assets; redistribution to transfer <b>natural</b> <b>assets</b> from others; internalization to increase the ability of the poor to capture benefits generated by their stewardship of natural assets; and appropriation to establish rights for the poor to open-access resources. Building on the democratic principle that all individuals have equal rights to clean air, clean water, and other common heritage resources, these strategies simultaneously can advance the goals of poverty reduction, environmental protection, and environmental justice. ...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to answer a simple question: Are fluctuations, and {{especially}} temporary decline, in frequentation always harmful for the pro�t of a tourism destination? I propose a simple model for a nature-based destination, in which the willingness to pay of a tourist for the destination depends on the stock of <b>natural</b> <b>assets,</b> and I show using simulations that there exists a rational economic incentive to experience a decrease in frequentation for a while in order to let the stock of <b>natural</b> <b>assets</b> regenerates. This is an idea already emphasized by Greiner et al. (2001) and Kort et al. (2002). I show that anyway the optimal behavior of a pro�fit-maximizing representative tourism �firm would generally lead to a monotonic frequentation path. This apparent contradiction is due to the fact that the level of frequentation is not, in the real world, set at its optimal level. Yet it could be good news if at some point, when the stock of <b>natural</b> <b>assets</b> is low, frequentation declines for a while. ...|$|R
