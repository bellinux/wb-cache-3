25|$|This stork may be {{especially}} vulnerable in the llanos of Venezuela. Its population declined strongly there in recent past decades starting from 1977 and less than 5000 individuals were estimated {{to live in this}} region through most of the 1980s. A potentially effective conservation strategy to help protect this stork's natural habitat in the llanos is the expansion and maintenance of cattle ranches in the savanna grassland matrix in preference to crop cultivation; because such ranches are similar in vegetation structure to <b>natural</b> <b>grasslands.</b> Another potentially useful conservation measure is the deployment of artificial nesting platforms to encourage nesting of maguari storks, as has been done for the white stork in Europe. Despite its relatively unthreatened overall status, the maguari stork should deserve closer global population monitoring to better safeguard it from future potential large-scale declines across its entire range.|$|E

According to our results, the distribution in <b>natural</b> <b>grassland</b> vegetation will not change within the next 50 to 60 years. After that, however, the temperature will rise so rapidly and the maximum snow depth will decrease rapidly.

40|$|This study {{assessed}} the biodiversity of soil macrofauna along a chronosequence of abandoned rice paddy fields including situations of 2, 4, 7 and 15 {{years since the}} last rice harvest, compared to a control without agricultural disturbance. The density of soil macrofauna changed dramatically according to the chronosequence. It was maximum in the 2 -year-abandoned rice field (4360 ind m− 2) and minimum in the <b>natural</b> <b>grassland</b> (397. 3 ind m− 2). A total of 133 morphospecies was found, distributed among 20 main families. The highest species richness was observed in the <b>natural</b> <b>grassland</b> and in the 2 -year-fallow with 53 and 59 species, respectively, whereas the lowest richness {{was found in the}} 7 -year-fallow (39 species). The proportion of shared species was minimum (19. 1 %) when comparing the <b>natural</b> <b>grassland</b> and the 2 -year-fallow and remained surprisingly low between the <b>natural</b> <b>grassland</b> and the 15 -year-fallow (23. 4 %). The species diversity as measured by the Shannon index varied strongly along the chronosequence. It was maximum in the <b>natural</b> <b>grassland</b> (1. 98), minimum in the 2 -year-fallow (1. 01) and increased progressively throughout the chronosequence, although, it was still lower in the fallow after 15 years of abandonment as compared to the <b>natural</b> <b>grassland.</b> The same trend was observed using the evenness index. The indicator value index (Indval) was computed for each species and showed that 14 species out of 133 were statistically associated with a given chronosequence stage.

Our objectives were (1) to quantify the dependency of SOC stocks on vegetation type; (2) to identify in which aggregate sizes and chemical forms the SOC was stored; and (3) to determine which vegetation type was the most effective at sequestering SOC. The studied vegetation types were shrubland CK 16 (16 -year-old Caragana korshinskii Kom.), shrubland CK 26 (26 -year-old C. korshinskii Kom.), shrubland AS (Armeniaca sibirica Lam.), <b>natural</b> <b>grassland</b> and artificial pasture.

30|$|The {{relationship}} between vegetation and soil moisture deserves attention {{due to its}} scientific importance and practical applications. However, the effects of soil moisture on vegetation development and succession are poorly documented. Here we study soil water storage in Yanhe watershed at northern Shaanxi on five different land uses, namely shrubland, farmland, <b>natural</b> <b>grassland,</b> woodland, and artificial grassland, and in soil under restoration for 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25. The results show that (1) soil water in soil 0 - 60 cm below ground is the highest in farmland, and lower in shrubland, artificial <b>grassland,</b> <b>natural</b> <b>grassland</b> and woodland; (2) soil water in artificial grassland and woodland decreases rapidly as the soil depth increases; whereas soil water in farmland, <b>natural</b> <b>grassland,</b> shrubland and woodland decreases; (3) soil water storage of farmland is {{greater than that of}} shrubland, artificial <b>grassland,</b> <b>natural</b> <b>grassland</b> and woodland; and (4) the vegetation succession in soil undergo restoration for different years on eroded soil results in a decrease in soil water storage.|$|R
40|$|The {{oxidizability}} of soil {{organic carbon}} (SOC) influences soil quality and carbon sequestration. Four fractions of oxidizable organic carbon (very labile (C 1), labile (C 2), less labile (C 3) and non-labile (C 4)) reflect {{the status and}} composition of SOC and have implications for the change and retention of SOC. Studies of the fractions of oxidizable organic carbon (OC) have been limited to shallow soil depths and agroecosystems. How these fractions respond at deep soil depths and in other types of land-use is not clear. In this study, we evaluated the vertical distributions of the fractions of oxidizable organic carbon to a soil depth of 5. 0 m in 10 land-use types in the Zhifanggou Watershed on the Loess Plateau, China. Along the soil profile, C 1 contents were highly variable in the <b>natural</b> <b>grassland</b> and shrubland I (Caragana microphylla), C 2 and C 4 contents were highly variable in the <b>natural</b> <b>grassland</b> and two terraced croplands, respectively, and C 3 contents varied little.
