40|$|International audienceTo meet 5 G {{networks}} {{challenges in}} terms of high data ratesand spectral efficiency, one solution might be using multicarriermodulations (MCM) s. However, using MCMs issynonymous with low energy efficiency due to their highpeak-to-average power ratio (PAPR). Indeed, high PAPRsignals drive power amplifiers to operate most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>timein</b> <b>the</b> linear zone. This latter corresponds to low power efficiency. This leads to a trade-off between spectral and energyefficiency. For this reason, PAPR reduction techniqueshave been highly addressed in literature.

5000|$|The runners {{from the}} two {{turbines}} in the Cougar powerhouse experienced significant cavitation damage during operation and by the 1980s they were in need of repair {{and had to be}} taken out of service four times a year for inspections and repair. [...] In 1987, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers installed replacement runners that were designed by Voith Siemens Hydro Power Generation. By 2000, the replacement runners were again experiencing cavitation problems and in need of repair. Repair of the runners would prove to be difficult because the runner blades are thin, making them difficult to weld, and the spacing between the blades is small which gives limited access to the damaged area. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers realized that a state-of-the-art runner design was required and devised a turbine-generator rehabilitation program. Due to the technical challenges associated with the program, the Corps chose a best value procurement method for this project. In 2003, the contract was awarded to General Electric Hydro of Montreal, Quebec, Canada and the project was completed in March 2005. The project included physical model testing, new turbine runners, a major turbine overhaul, a generator rewind, and disassembly and reassembly of the units.The problems with the runners for the turbines at Cougar powerhouse are associated with the cycle of large head changes of the Cougar Reservoir. Since Cougar Reservoir is built for flood control, the levels of the reservoir very greatly, causing the units to operate at heads between 400 and 438 ft one third of the time and at heads between 270 and 310 ft one fifth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>time.In</b> 2002, <b>the</b> Corps began lowering the level of the reservoir {{for the construction of a}} temperature control facility.

5000|$|It {{was during}} this period of the {{democratic}} rule by Lepchas that the Tibetans started to migrate to Sikkim. The reason for this migration is attributed mainly to the clash between the followers of the [...] "Yellow Hats" [...] and the [...] "Red Hats" [...] sects of Vajrayana Buddhism in Tibet. This conflict resulted in the Tibetans belonging to the Red Hat sect migrating from Tibet in large numbers seeking refuge in Sikkim. The Tibetan migrants were then called as Bhutias in Sikkim. The Bhutias, who were Buddhists of the Red Hat sect, were also successful in converting many Lepchas to Buddhism. However, Lepchas remained aloof most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>time.In</b> <b>the</b> 17th century, Bhutias, in order to maintain cordial relationship with the Lepchas then decided with the help of three revered lamas from Western Tibet to consecrate a local Sikkimese person from Gangtok as the Chogyal of Sikkim. Thus, the first formal dynasty of the Namgyals in Sikkim came to be established in 1642. However, Phuntsog Namgyal, the first Chogyal or the King was made the temporal and spiritual leader of Sikkim after duly verifying that his antecedents were strongly linked to the 9th-century prince of the Kingdom of Minvang in eastern Tibet. This dynasty had ruled Chumbi and Teesta valley for considerable time. In the 13th century, a prince of this dynasty known by the name Guru Tashi, based on a clairvoyant vision, decided to go south of Tibet to Sikkim, then known as [...] "Denzong-the valley of rice" [...] to seek his fortune. While travelling on this mission with his family, he came to the Sakya Kingdom where a monastery was being built, and they were facing problems in erecting the pillars of the monastery. Then, one of Tashi's five sons, the elder son, erected the pillars of the monastery on his own and was honoured with the epithet [...] "Khye Bumsa" [...] (meaning: superior of ten thousand heroes). Pleased with the achievement of Khye Bumsa, the Sakya King gave his daughter in marriage to him. Bumsa then settled down in Chumbi valley where he met the Lepcha religious leader, Thekong Tek, several times seeking his blessings to beget children. Following the blessings of Thekong Tek, Bhums'a wife gave birth to three sons, and out of gratitude he visited the grand old sage in several times more in Sikkim nurturing an amicable relationship between them. However, Thekong Tek had no children and there was also a prophecy that one of Khye Bumsa's descendent would become the ruler of Sikkim. Thekong Tek then decided that after his death Bhumsa would take over the reins of power in his kingdom. Then a treaty of blood brotherhood was signed at Kabi Lungchok between Thekong Tek and Khye Bumsa to reinforce the bonding between the two communities of Lepchas and Bhutias of Sikkim. The solemn oath taken on the occasion was that Bhumsa [...] "would not discriminate his newly acquired Lepcha subjects". Since then this location has been commemorated as symbol of friendship and brotherhood between the Lepchas and Bhutias of Sikkim and stone pillars have been erected to mark the place symbolically. In 1642, Phuntsog Namgyal, the grandson of Khye Bumsa was crowned the first Chogyal of Sikkim at Yuksom by Rimpoche Lhatsun Chempo, the founder of the Nyingmapa order in Sikkim. This event is also marked by the Statue of Unity installed opposite to Tourist Information Office and close to the Thakur Bari Temple in Gangtok.|$|R
