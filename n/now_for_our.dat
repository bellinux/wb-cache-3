6000|$|... "And <b>now</b> <b>for</b> <b>our</b> Culture!" [...] {{he said in}} {{the same}} sonorous tones, {{demanding}} with a gesture the unveiling of the figure, which stood somewhat apart, muffled in a great sheet.|$|E
6000|$|... "Good gracious! So it is! <b>Now</b> <b>for</b> <b>our</b> little tableau!" [...] Ida {{pushed the}} {{champagne}} bottles obtrusively forward, {{in the direction}} of the door, and scattered oyster shells over the cloth.|$|E
30|$|We are <b>now</b> ready <b>for</b> <b>our</b> first main result. When m = 2, {{then the}} {{conclusion}} also follows from [[21], p. 124].|$|R

6000|$|... "All the same, {{we might}} have had it built and ready <b>now</b> but <b>for</b> <b>our</b> laziness. We might have worked on it nights without their knowing it, and slipped off some morning in the fog." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Slightly. It will do me service. I am {{somewhat}} feverish. A kingdom for a draught of water! And <b>now</b> <b>for</b> <b>our</b> wounded friends. Asriel, do you marshal the camp. It is the Sabbath eve.[62] Time presses.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That will do, boys," [...] he said finally. [...] "It's a queer story; but remember, it's all {{the more}} reason <b>now</b> <b>for</b> <b>our</b> keeping our secret. As for those things, I'll remove them quietly and at once." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It cannot, Tuan! Remember {{there is}} that woman who, being half white, is ungovernable, and would raise a great outcry. Also the {{officers}} are here. They are angry enough already. Dain must escape; he must go. We must help him <b>now</b> <b>for</b> <b>our</b> own safety." ...|$|E
30|$|We are <b>now</b> ready <b>for</b> <b>our</b> second main result, which {{concerns}} convex {{combinations of}} firmly nonexpansive mappings.

6000|$|... "Look here," [...] {{the latter}} said, angrily, [...] "if {{you act like}} this I'll dump you overboard, or shoot, {{whichever}} comes handiest. <b>Now</b> row <b>for</b> <b>our</b> camp, and {{do the best you}} know how, if you don't want to get into a pile of trouble with me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'In one way, it ain't; {{and in one}} way it is. I {{was over}} there last night a bothering of her. She'd a' come round may be, if she'd a' been left alone. She wouldn't a' been off <b>now,</b> only <b>for</b> <b>our</b> going over to Sheep's Acre. But,--oh!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Not materially; {{his pulse}} {{is still very}} high; {{but there was a}} gleam of perfect consciousness; he spoke calmly and clearly, fully {{understanding}} his situation. Come what will, it is a thing to be infinitely thankful for! I am very glad! <b>Now</b> <b>for</b> <b>our</b> morning reading.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, Sam!" [...] he said cordially, [...] "this is great. <b>Now</b> <b>for</b> <b>our</b> {{interesting}} experiment. My idea is {{that you}} can hurt a coon's head with a stick if you hit it hard enough. Keep quite still. Now. What, are you coming up? Sam, I hate to do it, but--" ...|$|E
60|$|I wished heartily <b>now</b> <b>for</b> <b>our</b> Spaniard, and {{the savage}} that was gone with him; or that I had {{any way to}} have come undiscovered within shot of them, that I might have rescued the three men; for I saw no fire-arms they had among them; but it fell out to my mind another way.|$|E
6000|$|<b>Now</b> <b>for</b> sugar,--nay, <b>our</b> plan Tolerates no work of man. Hurry, then, ye golden bees; Fetch your clearest honey, please, Garnered on a Yorkshire moor, While {{the last}} larks sing and soar, From the heather-blossoms sweet Where sea-breeze and {{sunshine}} meet, And the Augusts mask as Junes,-- Eleanor makes macaroons! ...|$|R
30|$|Note that Assumption A 1 b is {{sufficient}} to avoid the IA but not required. On the other hand, dropping A 1 b requires the IA to ensure {{the results of the}} paper hold. To facilitate reading, we will drop the notation x^(k)_l→x_l. With such assumptions, we are <b>now</b> ready <b>for</b> <b>our</b> first general statement.|$|R
60|$|We were <b>now</b> victualled <b>for</b> <b>our</b> voyage; and, as we mattered not purchase, we went merrily on for {{the coast}} of Ceylon, where we {{intended}} to touch, to get fresh water again, and more provisions; and we had nothing material offered {{in this part of}} the voyage, only that we met with contrary winds, and were above a month in the passage.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ah,' said Orestes, {{refusing to}} hear the sigh, or to see the {{bitterness}} of the lip which accompanied the speech--'now Hypatia is herself again; and my counsellor, and giver of deep and celestial reasons for all things at which poor I can only snatch and guess by vulpine cunning. So <b>now</b> <b>for</b> <b>our</b> lighter entertainment. What shall it be?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Cautious, Mr. Jacks, cautious!" [...] the Prince remarked smilingly. [...] "It {{is a great}} quality,--a quality which I, too, {{have learned}} how to appreciate. And <b>now</b> <b>for</b> <b>our</b> five minutes' talk. If I say to you, 'Return home with me,' I think you will {{remember}} that unpleasant room of mine, and you will recollect an important engagement at Scotland Yard. In the clubs one is always overheard. Walk with me a little way, Mr. Jacks, in St. James' Park. We can speak there without fear of interruption. Come!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{said the}} man, [...] "let's take {{one another at}} face value for a while, without digging too deep into the past; and <b>now</b> <b>for</b> <b>our</b> plans. This wood will be searched; but I don't see how we are {{to get out of}} it before dark as the roads are doubtless pretty well patrolled, or at least every farmer is on the lookout for {{suspicious}} strangers. So we might as well make the best of it here for the rest of the day. I think we're reasonably safe for the time being--if we keep Willie with us." ...|$|E
60|$|By this time, I confess, I {{felt almost}} like a criminal. Never in my life had danger loomed so near--not even when we {{returned}} with the Arabs from the oasis. For then we feared <b>for</b> <b>our</b> lives alone; <b>now,</b> we feared <b>for</b> <b>our</b> honour.|$|R
6000|$|Blood {{smiled with}} {{a flash of}} white teeth, and bowed. [...] "I shall be glad of your orders <b>now,</b> General, <b>for</b> {{pursuing}} <b>our</b> advantage. You realize that speed in striking is the first essential." ...|$|R

60|$|Wise. You {{have given}} it a very right description, in calling of it the Father and Mother of a great many other prodigious wickednesses: for it is so venomous and vile a thing, that it puts the whole course of Nature out of order, and makes it fit for nothing but confusion, and a hold for every evil thing. For where envy and strife is, there is confusion, and every evil work. {139c} Wherefore, I say, you have rightly called it, The very Father and Mother of a great many other sins. And <b>now</b> <b>for</b> <b>our</b> further edification, I will reckon {{up some of the}} births of Envy.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hurt! yes, I am hurt--hurt in my {{feelings}}--not in my body, {{thanks to}} my good sword and belt; but my feelings are injured. That villain, that rascal, that pirate--as I verily believe him to be--selected me specially for this service, I am persuaded, just because he knew me to be unfit for it. Bah! but I'll pay him off for it. Come, boys, forward--perhaps, in the circumstances, {{it would be more}} appropriate to say, upward! We must go through with it <b>now</b> <b>for</b> <b>our</b> retreat is cut off. Lead the way, Hugh, your eyes are younger and sharper than mine, and if you chance to fall over a cliff, pray give a yell, like a good fellow, so that I may escape your sad fate." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My God, he's off!" [...] cried Jim. [...] "Here, {{run to the}} burn. Jock, for a hatful of water. Quick, man, or he's gone! I'll loosen {{his things}} the while." [...] Away I tore, and was {{back in a minute}} with as much water as would Stay in my Glengarry. Jim had pulled open the man's coat and shirt, and we doused the water over him, and forced some between his lips. It had a good effect; for after a gasp or two he sat up and rubbed his eyes slowly, like a man who is waking from a deep sleep. But neither Jim nor I were looking at his face <b>now,</b> <b>for</b> <b>our</b> eyes were fixed upon his {{uncovered}} chest.|$|E
60|$|And <b>now</b> <b>for</b> Caroline Waddington, <b>our</b> donna primissima. Her qualities, attributes, and virtues must {{be given}} more in detail than those of her companions at the picnic, seeing that she is destined to fill a {{prominent}} place upon our canvas.|$|R
6000|$|It was <b>now</b> {{sufficiently}} dark <b>for</b> <b>our</b> purposes, and I {{began to}} reflect seriously {{on the best}} mode of proceeding, when, all at once, a heavy splash in the water was heard, and Marble was heard shouting, [...] "Man overboard!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'From {{the dark}} and horrible dungeon of hell, Diabolus with all {{the society of the}} princes of darkness, sends to our trusty ones, in and about the walls of the town of Mansoul, <b>now</b> impatiently waiting <b>for</b> <b>our</b> most devilish answer to their venomous and most {{poisonous}} design against the town of Mansoul.|$|R
6000|$|And <b>now</b> <b>for</b> <b>our</b> march. On {{the finest}} {{possible}} morning (April 9th), {{when the world}} was all ablaze with living light, I walked down the Wady Hamz. It has been abundantly supplied with water; in fact, the whole vein (thalweg) subtending the left bank would respond to tapping. The well El-Kusayr, just below the ruin, though at present closed, yielded till lately a large quantity: {{about half a mile}} to the westward is, or rather was, a saltish pit surrounded by four sweet. Almost all are now dry and filled up with fuel. A sharp trudge of three-quarters of an hour leads to the Bir el-Gurnah (Kurnah), the [...] "Well of the Broad," [...] in a district of the same name, lying between the ruin and the shore. It is a great gash in the sandy bed: the taste of the turbid produce is distinctly sulphurous; and my old white mule, being dainty in her drink, steadfastly refused to touch it. The distinct accents of the Red Sea told us that we were not more than a mile from its marge.|$|E
6000|$|Farewell, O Warbler! till to-morrow eve, [...] And you, my friends! farewell, a short farewell!
