5|$|The {{conservation}} of existing <b>natural</b> <b>enemies</b> {{in an environment}} is the third method of biological pest control.|$|E
5|$|There {{are three}} basic {{strategies}} for biological pest control: classical (importation), where a natural enemy of a pest is {{introduced in the}} hope of achieving control; inductive (augmentation), in which a large population of <b>natural</b> <b>enemies</b> are administered for quick pest control; and inoculative (conservation), in which measures are taken to maintain <b>natural</b> <b>enemies</b> through regular reestablishment.|$|E

40|$|Fortuitous {{biological}} control can be broadly {{defined as the}} unintentional reduction and maintenance of a pest population by a <b>natural</b> <b>enemy</b> wherein either the enemy, pest, or both are nonindigenous. As such, fortuitous {{biological control}} comprises a part of natural biological control. However, fortu-itous biological control also may result when a <b>natural</b> <b>enemy</b> that has been imported to control...|$|R
5|$|Biological {{pest control}} is a method of {{controlling}} pests such as insects and mites by using other organisms. It relies on predation, parasitism, herbivory or other natural mechanisms, but typically also involves an active human management role. Classical biological control involves the introduction of <b>natural</b> <b>enemies</b> of the pest that are bred in the laboratory and released into the environment. An alternative approach is to augment the <b>natural</b> <b>enemies</b> that occur {{in a particular area}} by releasing more, either in small, repeated batches, or in a single large-scale release. Ideally, the released organism will breed and survive, and provide long-term control. Biological control can be an important component of an integrated pest management programme.|$|E
5|$|Birds are {{the primary}} <b>natural</b> <b>enemies</b> of the Sirex woodwasp. The adults are {{frequently}} hunted by swallows (Hirundidae) and swifts (Apodidae), both of which prefer males. The black woodpecker (Dryocopius martius) and great spotted woodpecker (Dendrocopus major) consume some larvae, but do not specialize on the Sirex woodwasp.|$|E
5|$|Damage from Hypera postica, the alfalfa weevil, {{a serious}} {{introduced}} pest of forage, was substantially {{reduced by the}} introduction of <b>natural</b> <b>enemies.</b> 20 years after their introduction the population of weevils in the alfalfa area treated for alfalfa weevil in the Northeastern United States remained 75 percent down.|$|E
40|$|Evaluations of the non-target {{effects of}} {{transgenic}} cotton, modified {{to express the}} insecticidal proteins of Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), have been underway in Arizona since 1999. Here we provide a preliminary report of replicated field studies conducted from 1999 to 2001 to examine comparative affects of Bt cotton on <b>natural</b> <b>enemy</b> abundance, overall arthropod diversity, and <b>natural</b> <b>enemy</b> function. Analyses completed to date indicate that <b>natural</b> <b>enemy</b> abundance and overall arthropod diversity are affected by use of additional insecticides for other pests, but not directly by transgenic cottons in comparison with non-transgenic cottons. Further studies suggest that <b>natural</b> <b>enemy</b> function, measured as rates of predation and parasitism on two key pests (Pectinophora gossypiella (Saunders) and Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius)) of cotton in the western U. S., is unaffected in Bt cotton. Our preliminary results suggest that use of transgenic cotton may not have any unintended effects and represents an extremely selective pest control method that could facilitate the broader use of biological control and IPM in an agricultural system long dominated {{by the use of}} broad-spectrum insecticides...|$|R

Sampling of <b>natural</b> <b>enemy</b> fauna {{was done at}} 3 and 10 days after application. Cartap hydrochloride and endosulfan were safe for the <b>natural</b> <b>enemy</b> fauna among different insecticides tested, while in most of observations chlorpyriphos and methy 1 parathion {{were found to be}} toxic. <b>Natural</b> <b>enemy</b> diversity was maximum in cartap hydrochloride (1. 803 – 1. 943), endosulfan (1. 437 – 1. 833) and imidacloprid (1. 550 – 1. 847) treated plots at all the three phenophases under study. Least diversity was observed in monocrotophos (1. 195 – 1. 335), chlorpyriphos (1. 002 – 1. 429) and methyl parathion (0. 861 – 1. 522) treated plots...|$|R
40|$|Dryocosmus kuriphilus {{is one of}} {{the most}} serious pests of {{chestnut}} trees in Japan which entered from China about 1941. Among 15 species of native parasitoids, Torymus (Syntomaspis) beneficus is the most important <b>natural</b> <b>enemy</b> but it has not been recognized as an effective <b>natural</b> <b>enemy</b> capable of regulating the pest population under an acceptable economic injury level. Recently 10 species of the parasitoids were recorded from China. Among them a promising <b>natural</b> <b>enemy,</b> Torymus (Syntomaspis) sp. was imported into Japan and was released for propagation. The Chinese species is very closely related to the Japanese beneficus but distinguishable by the length of the ovipositor. The emergence period of the Chinese species is more synchronous with the host than is beneficus...|$|R
5|$|Importation or {{classical}} {{biological control}} involves {{the introduction of}} a pest's <b>natural</b> <b>enemies</b> to a new locale where they do not occur naturally. Early instances were often unofficial and not based on research, and some introduced species became serious pests themselves.|$|E
5|$|In 1905 the USDA {{initiated}} {{its first}} large-scale biological control program, sending entomologists to Europe and Japan {{to look for}} <b>natural</b> <b>enemies</b> of the gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar dispar, and brown-tail moth, Euproctis chrysorrhoea, invasive pests of trees and shrubs. As a result, nine parasitoids (solitary wasps) of gypsy moth, seven of brown-tail moth, and two predators of both moths became established in the USA. Although the gypsy moth was not fully controlled by these <b>natural</b> <b>enemies,</b> the frequency, duration, and severity of its outbreaks were reduced and the program was regarded as successful. This program also {{led to the development}} of many concepts, principles, and procedures for the implementation of biological control programs.|$|E
5|$|<b>Natural</b> <b>enemies</b> {{of insect}} pests, {{also known as}} {{biological}} control agents, include predators, parasitoids, pathogens, and competitors. Biological control agents of plant diseases are most {{often referred to as}} antagonists. Biological control agents of weeds include seed predators, herbivores and plant pathogens.|$|E

5|$|Some {{grasshopper}} species, {{like the}} Chinese rice grasshopper, are a pest in rice paddies. Ploughing exposes the eggs {{on the surface}} of the field, to be destroyed by sunshine or eaten by <b>natural</b> <b>enemies.</b> Some eggs may be buried too deeply in the soil for hatching to take place.|$|E
5|$|Cropping {{systems can}} be {{modified}} to favor <b>natural</b> <b>enemies,</b> a practice {{sometimes referred to as}} habitat manipulation. Providing a suitable habitat, such as a shelterbelt, hedgerow, or beetle bank where beneficial insects such as parasitoidal wasps can live and reproduce, can help ensure the survival of populations of <b>natural</b> <b>enemies.</b> Things as simple as leaving a layer of fallen leaves or mulch in place provides a suitable food source for worms and provides a shelter for insects, in turn being a food source for such beneficial mammals as hedgehogs and shrews. Compost piles and stacks of wood can provide shelter for invertebrates and small mammals. Long grass and ponds support amphibians. Not removing dead annuals and non-hardy plants in the autumn allows insects to make use of their hollow stems during winter. In California, prune trees are sometimes planted in grape vineyards to provide an improved overwintering habitat or refuge for a key grape pest parasitoid. The providing of artificial shelters in the form of wooden caskets, boxes or flowerpots is also sometimes undertaken, particularly in gardens, to make a cropped area more attractive to <b>natural</b> <b>enemies.</b> For example, earwigs are natural predators which can be encouraged in gardens by hanging upside-down flowerpots filled with straw or wood wool. Green lacewings can be encouraged by using plastic bottles with an open bottom and a roll of cardboard inside. Birdhouses enable insectivorous birds to nest; the most useful birds can be attracted by choosing an opening just large enough for the desired species.|$|E
5|$|Along the way, {{the story}} was greatly {{modified}} {{to make it more}} suitable as a family film. By the time it was completed in 1981, the film had changed into a chronicle of the unlikely friendship of two creatures, who should be <b>natural</b> <b>enemies</b> and who learn society sometimes tries to determine their roles despite their better impulses. In the original screenplay, Chief was slated to die the same as in the novel, but Stevens did not want to have an on-screen death and modified the film so that he survived.|$|E

5|$|In cotton production, the {{replacement}} of broad-spectrum insecticides with selective control measures such as Bt cotton can create a more favorable environment for <b>natural</b> <b>enemies</b> of cotton pests due to reduced insecticide exposure risk. Such predators or parasitoids can control pests not affected by the Bt protein. Reduced prey quality and abundance associated increased control from Bt cotton can also indirectly decrease natural enemy populations in some cases, but the percentage of pests eaten or parasitized in Bt and non-Bt cotton are often similar.|$|E
5|$|Aphids {{and other}} hemipteran insects secrete a sweet liquid called {{honeydew}}, when they feed on plant sap. The sugars in honeydew are a high-energy food source, which many ant species collect. In some cases, the aphids secrete the honeydew {{in response to}} ants tapping them with their antennae. The ants in turn keep predators away from the aphids and will move them from one feeding location to another. When migrating to a new area, many colonies will take the aphids with them, to ensure a continued supply of honeydew. Ants also tend mealybugs to harvest their honeydew. Mealybugs may become a serious pest of pineapples if ants are present to protect mealybugs from their <b>natural</b> <b>enemies.</b>|$|E
5|$|Augmentation {{involves}} the supplemental release of <b>natural</b> <b>enemies</b> {{that occur in}} a particular area, boosting the naturally occurring populations there. In inoculative release, small numbers of the control agents are released at intervals {{to allow them to}} reproduce, in the hope of setting up longer-term control, and thus keeping the pest down to a low level, constituting prevention rather than cure. In inundative release, in contrast, large numbers are released in the hope of rapidly reducing a damaging pest population, correcting a problem that has already arisen. Augmentation can be effective, but is not guaranteed to work, and depends on the precise details of the interactions between each pest and control agent.|$|E

5|$|Few Myxogastria {{species are}} found in the tropics and subtropics, mainly because of the high {{humidity}} which prevents the necessary dehydration of the fruit bodies to permit spore dispersal and promotes infestation by moulds. Other factors are low light levels under the forest canopy which reduces phototaxis, light winds, poor soils, <b>natural</b> <b>enemies</b> and heavy rainfall which can wash away or destroy cells. Species living in soil or deadwood decrease as humidity increases. In a study from Costa Rica, 73% of the total findings were in the relatively dry Tropical Moist Forest, while 18% were in the very moist Tropical Premontane Wet Forests and only 9% in Lower Premontane Rain Forest.|$|E
5|$|Forest pests {{present a}} {{significant}} problem {{because it is not}} easy to access the canopy and monitor pest populations. In addition, forestry pests such as bark beetles, kept under control by <b>natural</b> <b>enemies</b> in their native range, may be transported large distances in cut timber to places where they have no natural predators, enabling them to cause extensive economic damage. Pheromone traps have been used to monitor pest populations in the canopy. These release volatile chemicals that attract males. Pheromone traps can detect the arrival of pests or alert foresters to outbreaks. For example, spruce budworm has been monitored using pheromone traps in Canadian forests for several decades.|$|E
5|$|<b>Natural</b> <b>enemies</b> {{are already}} {{adapted to the}} habitat and to the target pest, and their {{conservation}} can be simple and cost-effective, as when nectar-producing crop plants are grown in the borders of rice fields. These provide nectar to support parasitoids and predators of planthopper pests and have been demonstrated to be so effective (reducing pest densities by 10- or even 100-fold) that farmers sprayed 70% less insecticides and enjoyed yields boosted by 5%. Predators of aphids were similarly found {{to be present in}} tussock grasses by field boundary hedges in England, but they spread too slowly to reach the centres of fields. Control was improved by planting a metre-wide strip of tussock grasses in field centres, enabling aphid predators to overwinter there.|$|E

From simple modelled food-webs and simulations of <b>natural</b> <b>enemy</b> species loss we derive specific predictions concerning the effect of herbivore life-history traits, such as life-cycle type and concealment, on the shape (reflecting diversity effects) and variance (reflecting species composition effects) of the relationship between <b>natural</b> <b>enemy</b> diversity and pest-control. We show that these predictions are consistent with the emergence of different pest types following intensification of rice production in Asia. We suggest that basic biological insights can help define the structure of ecological processes and allow more accurate predictions of the effect of species loss on the delivery of ecosystem services...|$|R
