40|$|INTRODUCTION Extremes {{of weather}} {{conditions}} and resulting variation in water conditions were noteworthy this spring. The west was very dry, but the Rainwater Basin had ample rains resulting in excellent breeding conditions for various waterbirds, notably Eared Grebe and American Coot. Shorebird numbers were unremarkable, {{although there was}} plenty of variation between species. Indeed, Dunlin, with record numbers, and Ruddy Turnstones were numerous. Arrival dates were pushing early but not record early. Species earlier than average were American Golden-Plover, Mountain Plover, Black-necked Stilt, White-rumped Sandpiper, and Stilt Sandpiper. Increasingly associated with wetlands, albeit unrelated to water levels, Greater Prairie-Chicken continued to use grassy margins of wetlands in the Rainwater Basin for lek sites. Leks were also noted in agricultural fields. Use of these habitats suggests ability to adapt and bodes well for the future of this species in southeast Nebraska, where it is also doing very well in its traditional native grassland habitats. Red-shouldered Hawks are being reported away from the traditional breeding site at Fontenelle Forest, the only site known in the state. Other species continuing range expansions and increasing in numbers are Scissor-tailed Flycatcher, Carolina Wren, Blue-gray Gnatcatcher, and Summer Tanager. It was a fun spring for rarity-seekers, with a putative first state record Zone-tailed Hawk, one of fewer than 5 records on the Great Plains north of the breeding range, a state 7 th record Curve-billed Thrasher, found, appropriately, by the state 2 ̆ 7 s <b>Non-game</b> <b>Bird</b> Program Manager, and a 9 th state record Golden-crowned Sparrow.

40|$|CHAPTER 1 : POPULATION GENETICS OF BALD EAGLES (HALIAEETUS LEUCOCEPHALUS) IN SOUTHERN IDAHO: INTERACTIONS OF LIFE HISTORY WITH REDUCTIONS IN POPULATION SIZE. Historical and {{contemporary}} population bottlenecks and founder events reduce population {{size and shape}} the level and structure of genetic variability within and among populations. When populations have undergone consecutive demographic events, {{it may be difficult}} to disentangle the underlying forces that have influenced their genetic variation. I used molecular data and historical demographic information to infer the roles of demographic events and evolutionary forces on the level and structure of genetic variability within and among populations of Southern Idaho bald eagles. I collected DNA samples and analyzed six polymorphic micro satellite loci from seven breeding bald eagle populations in southern Idaho. Significant gametic phase disequilibrium (GPD) combined with heterozygote excess detected by the program BOTTLENECK indicated that bald eagles in southern Idaho have undergone historic and recent bottlenecks. Differences among levels of GPD, genetic variability and inbreeding among populations also indicated that the genetics of these populations have been impacted by various combinations demographic events (population bottlenecks and founder events) and evolutionary forces (genetic drift, gene flow, non-random mating). Long-established populations showed the highest levels of genetic variability and the most recently discovered populations showed the lowest levels. Estimates of FST, RST and AMOVA also revealed significant genetic differentiation among populations between regions. The current level and structure of genetic variability of Bald eagles in southern Idaho appears to have been shaped by both the number of reductions in population size and the relative recentness of reductions. The presence of population structure among regions suggests that juvenile dispersal is limited among regions and that contemporary levels of gene flow between populations has not been sufficient to overcome the consequences of small populations size. Conservation strategies for similar large, philopatric and slowly maturing raptors should focus on preventing population bottlenecks, as the life-history characteristics of these species appear to limit the rate of recovery of genetic variability. CHAPTER 2 : CHARACTERIZATION OF BALD EAGLE (HALIAEETUS LEUCOCEPHALUS) POPULATION GROWTH IN LONG VALLEY, IDAHO, FROM SMALL POPULATION SIZE. The colonization of recently available habitat can result in founder events and small population size. Small founder populations undergo genetic drift (known as founder effects) which causes alterations and/or reductions in genetic diversity. When populations grow from small sizes, the rate by which genetic variability increases over time is determined by the rate of growth and the nature of recruitment into the populations: internal recruitment, immigration, or a combination of both. In instances where the parameters of population growth are difficult to measure using traditional means, changes in genetic variability over time can provide a reasonable means to infer the relative contributions of internal recruitment and immigration to population expansion from small size. The Long Valley bald eagle population in southern Idaho has grown from one known nest in 1976 to 17 in 2004. I used DNA from feather and blood samples collected in 1987, 2001, 2003, and 2004 to estimate genetic variability and relatedness among assumed unrelated individuals using 6 micro satellite loci. Gametic phase disequilibrium and inbreeding coefficients increased between 1987 and 2004 and indicated high levels of inbreeding apparently due to an increasing contribution of internal recruitment to population growth over time. Increases in allelic diversity between 1987 and 2004 were higher than expected from mutations and indicated that immigration has also contributed to growth in the Long Valley population. The presence of equilibrium conditions during 1987 and low inbreeding coefficients indicated a greater relative contribution of immigration to growth in the early history of this population. Increasing levels of gametic phase disequilibrium, Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, and inbreeding coefficients indicated that inbreeding among individuals hatched into the population made relatively larger contributions to population growth than immigration after 1987. The Long Valley bald eagle population received limited gene flow and displayed inbreeding that appear to have limited it from thus far overcoming the genetic consequences of founder events. Continued genetic monitoring of this population will provide a better understanding of the balance between historical recruitment and immigration as expansion of the Long Valley population proceeds. CHAPTER 3 : EFFECTS OF PREY AVAILABILITY AND FISH REMOVAL ON OSPREY DIET IN WEST-CENTRAL IDAHO. Prey capture in piscivorous birds is often significantly correlated with prey availability. Alterations of fish populations associated with human activities can have adverse impacts on the diets of breeding piscivorous <b>birds.</b> <b>Non-game</b> fish removal appears to impact the diets of piscivorous raptors by reducing the availability of preferred prey. I investigated the diets of ospreys nesting at Lake Cascade in west-central Idaho to document relationships between prey availability and osprey diet in relation to changes in fish abundance caused by non-game fish removal. I collected and identified prey remains from beneath and within 31 breeding osprey nests and characterized osprey diet during 2003 and 2004. Differences in Shannon 2 ̆ 7 s index of diversity, raw biomass estimates by species between years were tested using mixed models and I also determined osprey prey preference by year using multivariate compositional analysis.

40|$|We {{conducted}} {{studies in}} native prairie mixed-grass pastures in south~central North Dakota (U. S. A.) during 1989 - 2003 {{to determine how}} different grazing intensities affected structural characteristics of vegetation, livestock production and the occurrence and density of grassland birds. Generally, as grazing treatment intensity increased from light to extreme, mean vegetation structural values decreased for visual obstruction readings, tallest plants of grasses, forbs, and shrubs, and litter depth. Nineteen species of <b>non-game</b> <b>birds</b> were detected during 2001 and 2002. Overall breeding bird densities were negatively affected by increasing levels of grazing intensity in mixed-grass prairie. Claycolored sparrows (Spizella pallida), grasshopper sparrows (Ammodramus savannarum), and savannah sparrows (Passrculus sandwichensis) reached their highest densities in the light and moderate grazing intensity treatments whereas they occurred at very low densities or were absent from extreme grazing intensity treatments. In contrast, densities of chestnut-collared longspurs (Calcarius omatus), horned larks (Eremophila alpestris), upland sandpipers (Bartramia longicauda), marbled godwits (Limosa fedoa), and willets (Catoptrophorus semipalmatus) were highest in the heavy and extreme grazing treatment plots. Livestock average daily weight gains and body condition scores decreased directly with increasing grazing intensity. In contrast, average red meat production gains per unit of pasture had a quadratic relationship to stocking rates, increasing with increased grazing intensity (more animals per unit of pasture) until it reached a peak and then declined. Results from {{this study suggest that}} management of grassland habitats can be manipulated under specific grazing intensities to provide predictable conditions of nesting habitat for grassland bird species of management concern.

40|$|Grazing {{occurred}} {{naturally in}} the northern Great Plains and influenced many natural processes in grassland ecosystems, including the habitat selection of breeding birds. Grazing, mainly for livestock production, is still an important land use practice and is one that impacts millions of hectares on {{both public and private}} land in the United States. To better understand how long-term grazing treatments affect non-game breeding birds, a study was conducted at the Central Grasslands Research Extension Center (CGREC) in south-central North Dakota during 2001 and 2002 and results were compared to two earlier studies, one in native prairie and the other in Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) grasslands. Season-long and twice-over grazing treatments were in place for 19 years on native prairie sites and 10 years on CRP sites. Bird surveys were conducted along permanent belt transects three times per year and vegetation structure was characterized from measurements taken parallel to each bird survey transect, twice per year for each treatment plot. Non-game bird densities and species richness during this study period were lower for all grazing treatments in native prairie and CRP grazing system grasslands when compared to earlier studies. Among grazing treatments, rotational grazing treatments supported more species and are probably more beneficial because they provide areas of undisturbed habitat during the breeding season.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Twelve ancient {{artifacts}} or fragmented feather samples {{recovered from}} melting alpine ice patches in southern Yukon were analyzed {{in order to}} identify the species of birds associated with the ice patches or used on weapons recovered from these sites. The identification of bird species used by ancient hunters as long ago as 4500 BP enhances our insight into the customs, culture, and sophistication of life at that time. Downy feather barbs were found on two samples and microscopically identified as duck (Anatidae) and falcon (Falconidae). Further examination and comparisons using museum specimens resulted in a total of six identifications: Anatidae, eagle (Aquila or Haliaeetus), gyrfalcon (Falco rusticolus), white-tailed ptarmigan (Lagopus leucurus), short-eared owl (Asio flammeus), and northern flicker (Colaptes auratus luteus). Three of the feather samples were complete enough to show apparent modification, or notching, along the feather shaft. The identification of <b>non-game</b> <b>birds</b> such as gyrfalcon and eagles, together with evidence of possible worked or notched feathers, indicates that as long as 4500 years ago, Subarctic hunters selected feathers not only for their utility in fletching, but also possibly for symbolic or decorative purposes.

Migratory Bird Program Goals Protect, restore, and manage migratory bird populations to: • ensure long-term ecological sustainability of all migratory bird populations, • increase socioeconomic benefits, • promote and enhance hunting, bird watching and other outdoor bird-related experiences, • increase awareness of the value of migratory birds and their habitats for their intrinsic ecological, recreational and economic significance. The Migratory Bird Program seeks to conserve migratory bird populations and associated habitats for future generations, through careful monitoring and effective population and habitat management. Our Work The program is committed to undertaking an unprecedented level of cooperation and coordination to protect and conserve these international treasures, and to working together and with partners to assess, manage and conserve over 1, 000 native migratory bird species and their habitats. The Migratory Bird Program develops and implements survey, monitoring, and assessment activities to determine status of both game and <b>non-game</b> <b>birds.</b> Using this information, the Service provides opportunities, through the issuance of permits and regulations, for organizations and individuals to participate in migratory bird conservation activities, such as scientific research, rehabilitation of injured birds, education, falconry, and taxidermy, and control of overabundant species. Each year, the program compiles proposed and final regulations to authorize migratory bird hunting seasons. The Flyway System provides a solid foundation for a partnership-based approach with the states to establish these annual migratory bird hunting regulations. The program conducts biological planning, project implementation, and evaluation within the framework of regional, national and international bird management plans, treaties, and initiatives - Partners in Flight, the U. S. Shorebird Plan, the North American Water-bird Plan and the North American Waterfowl Management Plan...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1971 The {{impact that}} {{pesticides}} {{may have had}} on the mortality rates and productivity rates of <b>non-game</b> <b>birds</b> during the last 25 years was evaluated by studying the population dynamics of 16 species. A mathematical model showing the relationships between population parameters that yielded stable populations was developed. The information needed for the model included: (1) mortality rate schedule (obtained from recoveries of banded birds), (2) productivity rates, and (3) the age of sexual maturity. Production requirements for a stable population and annual rate of change (increase or decrease) in population levels were estimated. Population parameters were compared to determine if changes had occurred between time periods (i. e, 1925 - 1945 vs. 1946 - 1965). The great horned owl, red-shouldered hawk, sparrow hawk, osprey, barn owl, Cooper's hawk, red-tailed hawk, great blue heron, black-crowned night heron, brown pelican, barn owl, chimney swift, blue jay, black-capped chickadee, cardinal, and robin were subjected to this analysis. No increase in post-fledging mortality rates {{in any of the}} species has occurred since 1945. Therefore, accelerated decline in the species studied must have resulted from lowered reproductive rates. Mortality rates have decreased in the Cooper's hawk, sparrow hawk, great blue heron, and brown pelican. A decrease in shooting pressure was associated with decreased mortality rates. Evidence of declining reproductive rates were found in the brown pelican, osprey, Cooper's hawk, red-shouldered hawk, and sparrow hawk. No changes in reproductive rates were noted in the red-tailed hawk, great horned owl, or barn owl. Information on productivity rates was not available for comparison with the other species although rates of productivity essential for a stable population were estimated. This work will provide the basis for making comparisons in future studies. No change in reproductive rates was apparent among species feeding primarily on mammals. Species exhibiting a lowered reproductive success since 1945 were those whose major food items consisted of fish, reptiles, amphibians, or birds. Lowered reproductive success was accompanied by a decrease in eggshell thickness. Other investigators have reported that sparrow hawks and mallard ducks fed a diet of DDE and dieldrin have produced thin eggshells under laboratory conditions, and exhibited a lower reproductive success. Many bird species which consume food in which chlorinated hydrocarbon pesticides have been concentrated through a series of transfers along food chains have declined. The chlorinated hydrocarbon pesticides are believed responsible...|$|E
