40|$|The {{first phase}} of <b>noise</b> <b>mapping</b> and action {{planning}} in Ireland, in accordance with EU Directive 2002 / 49 /EC, is now complete. In total this included one agglomeration, one airport and approximately 600 km of major roads outside the agglomeration. These <b>noise</b> <b>maps</b> describe the level of noise exposure of approximately 1. 25 million people. The {{first phase of}} <b>noise</b> <b>mapping</b> was dealt with by five <b>noise</b> <b>mapping</b> bodies while 26 action planning authorities {{were involved in the}} development of the associated action plans. The second phase of <b>noise</b> <b>mapping,</b> due to be completed in 2012, sees a reduction in the defined thresholds describing the required agglomerations, roads and railways that have to be mapped. This will have a significant impact on the extent of mapping required. In Ireland this will result in an increased number of local authorities being required to develop strategic <b>noise</b> <b>maps</b> for their area along with the further development of associated action plans.

Noise immission is created by noise sources (noise emission) of various types which are propagating noise into the environment. A single source will create a certain level of immission primarily driven by originating sound power level and distance influenced by e.g. absorption and reflection.

50|$|The main noise {{indicators}} for noise mapping are long-term averaged sound levels, determined {{over all the}} correspondent periods of a year. All of these indicators may be {{defined in terms of}} A-weighted decibels (dBA, dB(A)).The result can be determined by computation or measurement methods. Computation methods are widely preferred, because of the large amount of yearly averaged locations required.Using either approach, a grid of receivers must be defined in order to measure or calculate noise levels. When results are obtained, using GIS tools, spatial interpolation must be applied in order to give a continuous graphical representation of sound levels. According to the END five dBA ranges are used for this contour (isoline) representation.The maps may be useful for planning stages, or for prior evaluation of action plans, determination of most polluted areas.With a strategic <b>noise</b> <b>map,</b> furthermore, an evaluation is possible to show the amount of people exposed within dBA ranges.

One of the main objectives {{is to be able to}} build and to compare <b>noise</b> <b>maps</b> of large cities, related to various mobility plan parameters. Considering the computational time that is required for making classical <b>noise</b> <b>maps</b> a simplified approach of the French standard NMPB 2008 method of sound propagation in urban areas has been proposed. A striking feature of the proposed approach is that the model is implemented within a two-dimensional geographic information system software (OrbisGIS). Incidentally a specific attention has been paid to the optimization of algorithms in order to reduce computational times and memory footprint. The method is then able to produce <b>noise</b> <b>maps</b> in few hours on a personal computer, for very large domains, around several millions of squared meters. A validation is presented by comparing <b>noise</b> <b>maps</b> produced by the proposed approach with regular <b>noise</b> <b>maps</b> of Nantes Métropole using the French standard method.

A stochastic simulation framework and software, namely RW-eNMS, were developed to facilitate the random walk approach in <b>noise</b> <b>mapping</b> prediction. This framework considers the randomness and complexity of machinery operation and noise emission levels. Also, it assesses the impact of noise on the workers and the surrounding environment. For data validation, three case studies were conducted to check the accuracy of the prediction data and to determine the efficiency and effectiveness of this approach. The results showed high accuracy of prediction results together with a majority of absolute differences of less than 2 dBA; also, the predicted noise doses were mostly in the range of measurement. Therefore, the random walk approach was effective in dealing with environmental noises.

A combination of measuring ocean sound using an acoustic sensor network and modelling sources of sound and sound propagation has been proposed as an approach to estimating the acoustic <b>noise</b> <b>map</b> within a region of interest.
