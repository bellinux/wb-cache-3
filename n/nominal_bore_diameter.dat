5000|$|Because the [...]22 long rifle round {{commonly}} uses a heeled lead or lightly plated bullet, {{the nominal}} bullet diameter {{is larger than}} the <b>nominal</b> <b>bore</b> <b>diameter</b> to prevent excessive lead fouling that can occur when shooting lead bullets that are the same or slightly smaller than the groove diameter. SAAMI specifies a nominal bullet diameter of 0.2255 with a tolerance of -0.004, while the specified bore diameter is 0.222.

5000|$|A modern variant {{between the}} Foster slug and the sabot slug is the wad slug, {{sometimes}} called a [...] "drive key slug", {{or just a}} [...] "key slug". This {{is a type of}} shotgun slug designed to be fired through a smoothbore shotgun barrel. Like the traditional Foster slug, a deep hollow is located in the rear of this slug, which serves to retain the center of mass near the front tip of the slug much like the Foster slug. However, unlike the Foster slug, a wad slug additionally has a key or web wall molded across the deep hollow, spanning the hollow, which serves to increase the structural integrity of the slug while also reducing the amount of expansion of the slug when fired, reducing the stress on the shot wad in which it rides down a barrel. Also, unlike Foster slugs that have thin fins {{on the outside of the}} slug, much like those on the Brenneke, the wad slug is shaped with an ogive or bullet shape, with a smooth outer surface. The wad slug is loaded using a standard shotshell wad, which acts like a sabot. The diameter of the wad slug is slightly less than the <b>nominal</b> <b>bore</b> <b>diameter,</b> being around 0.690 inch for a 12-gauge wad slug, and a wad slug is generally cast solely from pure lead, necessary for increasing safety if the slug is ever fired through a choked shotgun. Common 12 gauge wad slug masses include -oz. and 1-oz. wad slugs, and they are loaded in a traditional shotshell wad intended for variously loading among -oz., 1-oz., or 1-oz. shotshells. Depending on the specific stack-up, a card wad is also sometimes located between the slug and the shotshell wad, depending largely on which hull is specified, with the primary intended purpose of improving fold crimps on the loaded wad slug shell that serves to regulate fired shotshell pressures and improve accuracy.|$|E
40|$|Some {{preliminary}} {{brush seal}} leakage results for ambient temperature air are presented. Data for four nominal brush rotor radial clearances of - 0. 09, - 0. 048, - 0. 008, and 0. 035 mm {{were taken by}} using a tapered plug rotor at 0 and 400 rpm with rotor runout of 0. 127 mm peak to peak. The brush seal <b>nominal</b> <b>bore</b> <b>diameter</b> was 38 mm with 0. 05 mm bristles at 200 bristles/mm of circumference and a 0. 61 mm fence height. Leakages were greater than predicted, but agreement was reasonable. Leakage rates were not significantly altered by hysteresis or inlet flow variations. Visualization studies showed that the bristles followed the 400 rpm excitation, and loading studies indicated that bristles slid relative to one another...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{eccentricity}} on brush seal leakage at low rotational speeds were investigated. Included are the leakage results for ambient temperature air and nearly saturated streams at three different rotor eccentricities at both 0 and 400 rpm. A brush seal with a <b>nominal</b> <b>bore</b> <b>diameter</b> of 13. 647 cm. (5. 3730 in.) was used. It had a radial concentric interference of 0. 071 cm (0. 0028 in.) and a fence height of 0. 0927 cm (0. 0365 in.). There were 1060 bristles per centimeter of circumference (2690 bristles per inch of circumference). Rotor eccentricities of 0. 003, 0. 010, 0. 038, and 0. 043 cm (0. 001, 0. 004, 0. 015, and 0. 017 in.) were achieved by using bushings with different offsets. The results {{were compared with}} an annular seal model (FLOWCAL) for air and to a standard labyrinth seal model for steam. The annular seal model was also compared with a bulk flow model of a concentric brush seal in air. Large eccentricities did not damage the brush seals or their Haynes 25 bristles. However, the 304 stainless steel rotor did not show wear, indicating a harder surface is needed. Only the stream data showed hysteresis and were affected by shaft rotation. The brush seal had lower leakage rates than those predicted for comparable annular and labyrinth seals (conventional) {{because of the large}} clearances those seals require to accommodate large shaft excursions...|$|E
