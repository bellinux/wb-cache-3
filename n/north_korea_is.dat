This is despite 31% of North Koreans being malnourished. The best, strongest and most expensive tobacco comes from the north of the country near the border with China.|$|E

5|$|By mid-1950 {{after the}} {{successful}} landing at Inchon by the US X Corps {{and the subsequent}} destruction of the Korean People's Army, the Korean War appeared to be all but over.

5|$|While the CPC is {{probably}} the organization with most access to North Korea, writing about <b>North</b> <b>Korea</b> <b>is</b> tightly circumscribed. The few reports accessible {{to the general public}} are those about North Korean economic reforms. While Chinese analysts of North Korea tend to speak positively of North Korea in public, in official discussions they show much disdain for North Korea's economic system, the cult of personality which pervades society, the Kim family, the idea of hereditary succession in a socialist state, the security state, the use of scarce resources on the Korean People's Army and the general impoverishment of the North Korean people. There are those analysts who compare the current situation of North Korea with that of China during the Cultural Revolution. Over the years, the CPC has tried to persuade the Workers' Party of Korea (or WPK, North Korea's ruling party) to introduce economic reforms by showing them key economic infrastructure in China. For instance, in 2006 the CPC invited the WPK general secretary Kim Jong-il to Guandong province to showcase the success economic reforms have brought China. In general, the CPC considers the WPK and North Korea to be negative examples of a communist ruling party and socialist state.|$|E

On 14 September 2004, a British envoy said that <b>North</b> <b>Korea</b> <b>was</b> still committed to the talks, but on 27 September 2004, the KCNA (<b>North</b> <b>Korea's</b> state news agency) reported that resumption of the talks {{was out of the question}} until the United States made certain concessions.|$|R
