25|$|Registered Nurse: Some jurisdictions use {{specially}} trained nurses for pre-hospital services. These are mostly air-medical personnel or critical care transport providers with specialized {{training and experience}} in pre-hospital care. Such nurses are required by their employers to seek additional certifications beyond basic nursing licensure and are often required to have three years (minimum) of full-time experience in emergency and/or intensive care. Certifications requirements vary but often include advanced cardiac life support (ACLS), basic life support (BLS), pediatric advanced life support (PALS), <b>neonatal</b> <b>resuscitation</b> program (NRP), trauma nursing core course (TNCC), and Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS), in addition to Pre-Hospital Trauma Life Support (PHTLS). Standards also include being board certified in Emergency Nursing (CEN), Critical Care Nursing (CCRN), and Ground Transport (CTRN) or Flight Nursing (CFRN) respectively. These nurses are trained up to and able to operate {{at or above the}} level of a paramedic and in some regions are authorized to operate base station phones for medical command. Some states allow them to operate entirely under standing orders while on a ground ambulance or air medical unit (i.e. offline medical control). Training also includes specific education relevant to the state and its protocols, and often require the nurse to train with paramedics {{for a period of time}} as well as taking an additional exam administered by their medical director before being allowed to operate on a ground ambulance or air medical unit. Many of these nurses hold certifications as Emergency Medical Technicians or Paramedics, and in some states are required to, but it is not the standard of practice.|$|E

40|$|Background and aim: Neonatal {{hypothermia}} is a {{major risk}} factor for mortality after delivery. This study aims to identify the risk factors associated with transition in hypothermia state with new definition of hypothermia states. Methods:  Four hundred and seventy nine (479) neonates hospitalized in NICU of Valiasr in Tehran, Iran in 2005 participated in this study. The rectal temperature of neonatal was measured immediately after delivery and every 30 min afterwards, until neonates became normal. Results: The mean weight of neonatal was 2580 ± 882. 9 g and mean of delivery room temperature was 29. 2 ± 1. 45 °C. Most of the neonatal were mild hypothermia. There were significant associations between weight of <b>neonatal,</b> cardiopulmonary <b>resuscitation</b> (CPR) and Apgar score with hypothermia state (P< 0. 05).   Death of neonatal was related to hypothermia state.

Study design: A prospective cohort of 94 term neonates born between 1994 and 2010 with early postnatal brain magnetic resonance imaging studies were analyzed for regions of brain injury. Neurodevelopmental outcome was assessed at 1 year of age. Results: Hypoglycemia (glucose < 46 mg/dL) in the first 24 hours after birth was detected in 16 % of the cohort. Adjusting for potential confounders of early perinatal distress and need for <b>resuscitation,</b> <b>neonatal</b> hypoglycemia {{was associated with a}} 3. 72 -fold increased odds of corticospinal tract injury (P =. 047).

40|$|Resuscitation {{training}} {{is a vital}} area of education that could {{have a significant impact}} on patient outcome. This is especially true in the newborn period where inexperienced, inadequate or inappropriate resuscitation responses could affect the entire life span of a newborn infant. In addition, neonates are more often subject to asphyxia and are far more likely to be in need of resuscitation than any other age group. The World Health Organization (1995) estimates that every year there are one million neonatal deaths attributable to birth asphyxia. Due to the unique aetiology and pathophysiology of <b>neonatal</b> arrests, successful <b>resuscitation</b> requires the application of knowledge and skills that require special training. The purpose of resuscitation {{training is}} to transfer the science of resuscitation into classroom performance, with the objective of transferring knowledge and skills into clinical practice.

We analyzed its cost-effectiveness at a faith-based Haydom Lutheran Hospital (HLH) in rural Tanzania. Data about early neonatal mortality and fresh stillbirth rates were drawn from a linked observational study during one year before and one year after full implementation of the HBB program. Cost data were provided by the Tanzanian Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (MOHSW), the research department at HLH, and the manufacturer of the training material Lærdal Global Health. Costs per life saved were USD 233, while they were USD 4. 21 per life year gained. Costs for maintaining the program were USD 80 per life saved and USD 1. 44 per life year gained. Costs per disease adjusted life year (DALY) averted ranged from International Dollars (ID; a virtual valuta corrected for purchasing power world-wide) 12 to 23, according to how DALYs were calculated. The HBB program is a low-cost intervention. Implementation in a very rural faith-based hospital like HLH has been highly cost-effective.

40|$|Objectives: The aims of {{this study}} were to assess clinicians’ views and {{experiences}} of providing immediate neonatal care at birth beside the mother, and of using a mobile trolley designed to facilitate this bedside care. Design: Qualitative interview study with semistructured interviews. Results: The results were analysed using thematic analysis. Setting: A large UK maternity unit. Participants: Clinicians (n= 20) from a range of disciplines who were present when the trolley was used to provide neonatal care at birth at the bedside. Five clinicians provided/observed advanced resuscitation by the bedside. Results: Five themes were identified: (1) Parents’ involvement, which included ‘Contact and involvement’, ‘Positive emotions for parents’ and ‘Staff communication’; (2) Reservations about neonatal care at birth beside the mother, which included ‘Impact on clinicians’ and ‘Impact on parents’; (3) Practical challenges in providing neonatal care at the bedside, which included ‘Cord length’ and ‘Caesarean section’; (4) Comparison of the trolley with usual resuscitation equipment and (5) Training and integration of bedside care into clinical routine, which included ‘Teething problems’ and ‘Training’. Conclusions: Overall, most clinicians were positive about providing immediate neonatal care at the maternal bedside, particularly in terms of the clinicians’ perceptions of the parents’ experience. Clinicians also perceived that their close proximity to parents improved communication. However, there was some concern about performing more intensive interventions in front of parents.

40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the feasibility of}} using pulse oximetry (PO) for evaluating infants born in community-based midwifery care. Design: a prospective, observational study of infants born after midwifery supervised (home) births. Setting: 27 midwives from seven practices providing primary care in (home) births used PO at birth or the early puerperal period over a ten-month period. Data were obtained {{on the effect of}} PO on outcome, interventions and decision-making. Midwives were surveyed about applicability and usefulness of PO. Participants: 153 infants born in primary midwifery care. Findings: all births were uncomplicated except for one infant receiving supplemental oxygen and another was mask ventilated. In 138 / 153 (90 %) infants PO was successfully used and 88 % of midwives found PO easy to use. In 148 / 153 (97 %) infants PO did not influence midwives' clinical judgment and referral policy. In 5 / 153 (3 %) infants, midwives were uncertain of the infant's condition, but PO measurements were reassuring. In case of suboptimal <b>neonatal</b> condition or <b>resuscitation,</b> 100 % of midwives declared they would use PO again. Key conclusions: it is feasible to use PO in community based midwifery care, but not considered an important contribution to routine evaluation of infants. Midwives would like to have PO available during suboptimal neonatal condition or when resuscitation is required. Implications for practice: PO can be applied in community based midwifery care; it does not lead to insecurity or extra referral. Further research on a larger group of infants must show the effect of PO on neonatal outcomes. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
40|$|Objective. To {{investigate}} the perinatal adaptive {{response of the}} adrenal blood flow/adrenal fractional moving blood volume (AFMBV) and carotid blood flow (CBF), in sheep fetuses subjected to severe acute intrauterine hypoxia/asphyxia induced by total cord occlusion. Methods. Adrenal blood flow velocity, AFMBV and CBF were measured in 13 exteriorized fetal sheep; eight of them underwent total umbilical cord occlusion to induce severe acute hypoxia/asphyxia. Five lambs were used as sham controls. Middle adrenal artery pulsatility index (MAAPI) and mean velocity (MAAMV) were recorded with pulsed Doppler ultrasound. AFMBV was estimated using power Doppler ultrasound. CBF was recorded with a transonic flowmeter. In the <b>neonatal</b> period, after <b>resuscitation</b> all lambs were followed for a 4 -hour period and AFMBV and CBF were recorded. Mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) and fetal heart rate were recorded continuously. Arterial cortisol levels were measured {{at the beginning and}} at the end of the fetal and neonatal periods. Results. Following the total cord occlusion, there was a significant reduction in the CBF, MABP, and heart rate and adrenal flow/AFMBV after 2, 4 and 5 ?min, respectively. Cortisol levels in the asphyctic lambs at the end of the cord occlusion were significantly lower than those in controls. After resuscitation, the asphyctic lambs showed increased AFMBV and cortisol levels, and reduced MABP as compared to control lambs. No differences were found in CBF, MAAPI and MAAMV. Thereafter, no differences were observed between the two groups in any of the studied parameters. At the end of the cord occlusion period, there was a significant correlation between AFMBV and MABP (r?=? 0. 69), between AFMBV and CBF (r?=? 0. 65) and between CBF and MABP (r?=? 0. 89). Conclusion. During severe acute intrauterine hypoxia, the fetal lamb is able to maintain the blood flow to the brain and the adrenal gland for 3 - 5 ?min. Changes in the AFMBV and the CBF were highly correlated to the changes in MABP. Adrenal FMBV and cortisol levels were higher in lamb neonates exposed to severe intrauterine asphyxia...|$|R

40|$|Background: Although {{nalbuphine}} was studied {{extensively in}} labour analgesia and was {{proved to be}} acceptable analgesics during delivery, its use as premedication before induction of general anesthesia for cesarean section is not studied. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the effect of nalbuphine given before induction of general anesthesia for cesarean section on quality of general anesthesia, maternal stress response, and neonatal outcome. Methods: Sixty full term pregnant women scheduled for elective cesarean section, randomly classified into two equal groups, group N received nalbuphine 0. 2 mg/kg diluted in 10 ml of normal saline (n= 30), and group C placebo (n= 30) received 10 ml of normal saline 1 min before the induction of general anesthesia. Maternal heart rate and blood pressure were measured before, after induction, during surgery, and after recovery. Neonates were assisted by using APGAR 0 scores, time to sustained respiration, and umbilical cord blood gas analysis. Result: Maternal heart rate showed significant increase in control group than nalbuphine group after intubation (88. 2 ± 4. 47 versus 80. 1 ± 4. 23, P< 0. 0001) and during surgery till delivery of baby (90. 8 ± 2. 39 versus 82. 6 ± 2. 60, P< 0. 0001) and no significant changes between both groups after delivery. MABP increased in control group than nalbuphine group after intubation (100. 55 ± 6. 29 versus 88. 75 ± 6. 09, P< 0. 0001) and during surgery till delivery of baby (98. 50 ± 2. 01 versus 90. 50 ± 2. 01, P< 0. 0001) and no significant changes between both groups after delivery. APGAR score was significantly low at one minute in nalbuphine group than control group (6. 75 ± 2. 3, 8. 5 ± 0. 74, respectively, P= 0. 0002) (27 % of nalbuphine group APGAR score ranged between 4 - 6, while 7 % in control group APGAR score ranged between 4 - 6 at one minute). All neonates at five minutes showed APGAR score ranged between 9 - 10. Time to sustained respiration was significantly longer in nalbuphine group than control group (81. 8 ± 51. 4 versus 34. 9 ± 26. 2 seconds, P< 0. 0001). The umbilical cord blood gas was comparable in both groups. None of the neonates need opioid antagonist (naloxone) or endotracheal intubation. Conclusion: Administration of nalbuphine before cesarean section under general anesthesia reduces maternal stress response related to intubation and surgery, but decreases the APGAR score at one minute after delivery.
