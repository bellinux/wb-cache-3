5|$|After the office-building {{boom of the}} 1980s, the 1990s saw {{an office}} glut that {{resulted}} in numerous vacancies and reduced leasing rates throughout Center City. In 1993 IBM, struggling financially, was shrinking its workforce and consolidating its operations <b>nationwide,</b> <b>and</b> its plans included moving some of its local employees out of the city. Though IBM had initially occupied nearly half of One Commerce Square, by 1993 it was using only one-fifth of the building. In 1996, Maguire Thomas Partners split up, leaving the ownership of Commerce Square to Thomas Properties Group Inc. alone. After the split, Thomas Properties renegotiated mortgage financing of the Commerce Square towers. Thomas Properties Group successfully renegotiated the debt for Two Commerce Square with Bank of America, {{but was unable to}} renegotiate the debt with One Commerce Square's prime mortgage holder, Mitsubishi Trust and Banking Corporation. To break the deadlock, Philadelphia Plaza Associates filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Thomas Properties Group was then the parent company of Philadelphia Plaza Associates which owned Commerce Square.|$|E
5|$|Anti-Masonry {{was still}} strong in Western New York {{though it was}} petering out nationally, and when the Anti-Masons did not {{nominate}} him {{for a second term}} in 1834, Fillmore declined the Whig nomination, seeing that the two parties would split the anti-Jackson vote and elect the Democrat. Despite Fillmore's departure from office, he was a rival for state party leadership with Seward, the unsuccessful 1834 Whig gubernatorial candidate. Fillmore spent his time out of office building his law practice and boosting the Whig Party, which gradually absorbed most of the Anti-Masons. By 1836, Fillmore was confident enough of anti-Jackson unity that he accepted the Whig nomination for Congress. Democrats, led by their presidential candidate, Vice President Martin Van Buren, were victorious <b>nationwide</b> <b>and</b> in Van Buren's home state of New York, but Western New York voted Whig and sent Fillmore back to Washington.|$|E
5|$|Destruction was {{heaviest}} in Belize and totaled $250million (2001USD). Because Iris was compact, {{the damage}} was largely confined to 72% of the houses in the Toledo district and 50% of the houses in the Stann Creek district. The hurricane damaged or destroyed 3,718homes <b>nationwide,</b> <b>and</b> wrecked more than 95% of the homes in 35villages in the poorest parts of the country. Iris left about 15,000people homeless, many receiving assistance {{from the government and}} the local Red Cross chapter. High winds also damaged large swaths of forest and crops, mostly affecting the banana industry. Iris killed 24people in Belize, including 20 who died when a scuba diving boat capsized near Big Creek. The storm also killed eight people and damaged about 2,500homes in neighboring Guatemala, and later dropped heavy rainfall in southern Mexico, where two people died.|$|E

5|$|From 1979, keg Stones {{began to}} be {{promoted}} heavily <b>nationwide,</b> <b>and</b> the beer {{was introduced to the}} South of England for the first time. The beer was promoted following the withdrawal of the unpopular Brew Ten, which was itself intended to replace Bass's regional ales. Originally the beer would be produced at the Cannon Brewery and then transported to Bass' Hope & Anchor brewery, also in Sheffield, for pasteurisation and kegging, but eventually demand for Stones Bitter became too great for the Cannon alone, and production was also extended to other Bass breweries. In the early 1980s, it was produced at Bass' Runcorn brewery, although this was quickly halted after drinkers complained of headaches from the poorly manufactured beer. The Runcorn beer had been brewed at a higher temperature, which increased the amount of hangover-inducing fusel oils in the beer.|$|E
5|$|The rapid {{deterioration}} of the economy led to the resignation on 27 March 1930 of the coalition government that had been elected in 1928. A new cabinet was formed, and Paul von Hindenburg used his power as president to govern via emergency decrees. He appointed Heinrich Brüning as chancellor. Goebbels {{took charge of the}} NSDAP's national campaign for Reichstag elections called for 14 September 1930. Campaigning was undertaken on a huge scale, with thousands of meetings and speeches held all over the country. Hitler's speeches focused on blaming the country's economic woes on the Weimar Republic, particularly its adherence to the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, which required war reparations that had proven devastating to the German economy. He proposed a new German society based on race and national unity. The resulting success took even Hitler and Goebbels by surprise: the party received 6.5 million votes <b>nationwide</b> <b>and</b> took 107 seats in the Reichstag, making it the second largest party in the country.|$|E
5|$|On August 29, 2016 (August 29, 1997, {{being the}} date when Skynet becomes self-aware in the films), it was {{announced}} that the film would be digitally remastered in 3D to commemorate its 25th anniversary, with a worldwide re-release planned for summer 2017. The version to be remastered and rereleased in 3D was the original 137 minute theatrical cut, as the extended edition is not James Cameron's preferred version. Only one camera shot from the opening chase sequence was digitally altered to fix a minor continuity error which had bugged Cameron since the 1991 release. DMG Entertainment and Studiocanal worked together with Cameron to convert the film using the StereoD technology. The 3D version premiered on February 17, 2017, at the Berlin International Film Festival, with the theatrical re-release being scheduled for August 25, 2017. Similar to Cameron's Titanic 3D, Lightstorm Entertainment oversaw the work on the 3D version of Terminator 2, which took nearly a year to finish. The film was released by Distrib Films US which typically handles the release of French films. The studio released the film exclusively for one week in AMC Theatres <b>nationwide,</b> <b>and</b> said that it will expand depending on the film's performances in its first week.|$|E

5|$|The ethnic Chinese {{population}} in Indonesia grew {{by an average}} of 4.3 percent annually between 1920 and 1930. It then slowed owing to the effects of the Great Depression and many areas experienced a net emigration. Falling growth rates were also attributed to a significant {{decrease in the number of}} Chinese immigrants admitted into Indonesia since the 1950s. The population is relatively old according to the 2000 census, having the lowest percentage of population under 14 years old <b>nationwide</b> <b>and</b> the second-highest percentage of population over 65. Their population pyramid had a narrow base with a rapid increase until the 15–19 age group, indicating a rapid decline in total fertility rates. This was evidenced by a decline in the absolute number of births since 1980. In Jakarta and West Java the population peak occurred in the 20–24 age group, indicating that the decline in fertility rates began as early as 1975. The upper portion of the pyramid exhibited a smooth decline with increasing population age. It is estimated that 60.7 percent of the Chinese Indonesian {{population in}} 2000 constitute the generation which experienced political and social pressures under the New Order government. With an average life expectancy of 75 years, those who spent their formative years prior to this regime will completely disappear by 2032.|$|E
