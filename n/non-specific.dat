5|$|Irreversible {{inhibition}} {{is different}} from irreversible enzyme inactivation. Irreversible inhibitors are generally specific for one class of enzyme and do not inactivate all proteins; they do not function by destroying protein structure but by specifically altering the active site of their target. For example, extremes of pH or temperature usually cause denaturation of all protein structure, {{but this is a}} <b>non-specific</b> effect. Similarly, some <b>non-specific</b> chemical treatments destroy protein structure: for example, heating in concentrated hydrochloric acid will hydrolyse the peptide bonds holding proteins together, releasing free amino acids.|$|E
5|$|Tentative {{evidence}} supports neuroreflexotherapy (NRT), in which {{small pieces of}} metal are placed just under {{the skin of the}} ear and back, for <b>non-specific</b> low back pain.|$|E
5|$|All the {{functions}} of DNA depend on interactions with proteins. These protein interactions can be <b>non-specific,</b> or the protein can bind specifically to a single DNA sequence. Enzymes can also bind to DNA and of these, the polymerases that copy the DNA base sequence in transcription and DNA replication are particularly important.|$|E
5|$|Approximately 85% of {{individuals}} with this disorder have not been diagnosed and consequently are not receiving lipid-lowering treatments. Physical examination findings can help a physician make the diagnosis of FH. Tendon xanthomas are seen in 20-40% {{of individuals}} with FH and are pathognomonic for the condition. A xanthelasma or corneal arcus may also be seen. These common signs are supportive of the diagnosis, but are <b>non-specific</b> findings.|$|E
5|$|Structural {{proteins}} that bind DNA are well-understood examples of <b>non-specific</b> DNA-protein interactions. Within chromosomes, DNA {{is held in}} complexes with structural proteins. These proteins organize the DNA into a compact structure called chromatin. In eukaryotes, this structure involves DNA binding to a complex of small basic proteins called histones, while in prokaryotes multiple types of proteins are involved. The histones form a disk-shaped complex called a nucleosome, which contains two complete turns of double-stranded DNA wrapped around its surface. These <b>non-specific</b> interactions are formed through basic residues in the histones, making ionic bonds to the acidic sugar-phosphate backbone of the DNA, and are thus largely independent of the base sequence. Chemical modifications of these basic amino acid residues include methylation, phosphorylation, and acetylation. These chemical changes alter {{the strength of the}} interaction between the DNA and the histones, making the DNA more or less accessible to transcription factors and changing the rate of transcription. Other <b>non-specific</b> DNA-binding proteins in chromatin include the high-mobility group proteins, which bind to bent or distorted DNA. These proteins are important in bending arrays of nucleosomes and arranging them into the larger structures that make up chromosomes.|$|E
5|$|The body's {{first line}} of defence against viruses is the innate immune system. This {{comprises}} cells and other mechanisms that defend the host from infection in a <b>non-specific</b> manner. This means that {{the cells of the}} innate system recognise, and respond to, pathogens in a generic way, but, unlike the adaptive immune system, it does not confer long-lasting or protective immunity to the host.|$|E
5|$|With {{other causes}} ruled out, people with <b>non-specific</b> {{low back pain}} are {{typically}} treated symptomatically, without exact determination of the cause. Efforts to uncover factors that might complicate the diagnosis, such as depression, substance abuse, or an agenda concerning insurance payments may be helpful.|$|E
5|$|Antibody and antigen {{interact}} by spatial complementarity (lock and key). The molecular forces {{involved in}} the Fab-epitope interaction are weak and <b>non-specific</b> â€“ for example electrostatic forces, hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic interactions, and van der Waals forces. This means binding between antibody and antigen is reversible, and the antibody's affinity towards an antigen is relative rather than absolute. Relatively weak binding also means {{it is possible for}} an antibody to cross-react with different antigens of different relative affinities.|$|E
5|$|Aware of the {{importance}} of causal structure, Roger Penrose and others developed what is known as global geometry. In global geometry, the object of study is not one particular solution (or family of solutions) to Einstein's equations. Rather, relations that hold true for all geodesics, such as the Raychaudhuri equation, and additional <b>non-specific</b> assumptions about the nature of matter (usually in the form of energy conditions) are used to derive general results.|$|E
5|$|Owing to the <b>non-specific</b> {{nature of}} the {{presentation}} of symptoms, diagnosis of malaria in non-endemic areas requires {{a high degree of}} suspicion, which might be elicited by any of the following: recent travel history, enlarged spleen, fever, low number of platelets in the blood, and higher-than-normal levels of bilirubin in the blood combined with a normal level of white blood cells. Reports in 2016 and 2017 from countries were malaria is common suggest high levels of over diagnosis due to insufficient or inaccurate laboratory testing.|$|E
5|$|Paracetamol poisoning, {{also known}} as {{acetaminophen}} poisoning, is caused by excessive use of the medication paracetamol (acetaminophen). Most people have few or <b>non-specific</b> symptoms in the first 24hours following overdose. This may include feeling tired, abdominal pain, or nausea. This is typically followed {{by a couple of}} days without any symptoms after which yellowish skin, blood clotting problems, and confusion occurs. Additional complications may include kidney failure, pancreatitis, low blood sugar, and lactic acidosis. If death does not occur, people tend to recover fully over a couple of weeks. Without treatment some cases will resolve while others will result in death.|$|E
5|$|People with OCD report activity-related {{pain that}} {{develops}} gradually. Individual complaints usually consist of mechanical symptoms including pain, swelling, catching, locking, popping noises, and buckling / giving way; the primary presenting symptom {{may be a}} restriction {{in the range of}} movement. Symptoms typically present within the initial weeks of stageI; however, the onset of stageII occurs within months and offers little time for diagnosis. The disease progresses rapidly beyond stageII, as OCD lesions quickly move from stable cysts or fissures to unstable fragments. <b>Non-specific</b> symptoms, caused by similar injuries such as sprains and strains, can delay a definitive diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that people with a {{previous}} traumatic brain injury, spontaneous subarachnoid hemorrhage (a type of stroke) or radiation therapy involving the head have a higher risk of hypopituitarism. After traumatic brain injury, as much as a quarter have persistent pituitary hormone deficiencies. Many of these people may have subtle or <b>non-specific</b> symptoms that are not linked to pituitary problems but attributed to their previous condition. It is therefore possible that many cases of hypopituitarism remain undiagnosed, and that the annual incidence would rise to 31 per 100,000 annually if people from these risk groups were to be tested.|$|E
5|$|Recreational diver {{training}} and dive leading are industry regulated in some countries, and only directly regulated by {{government in a}} subset of them. In the UK, HSE legislation includes recreational diver {{training and}} dive leading for reward; in the US and South Africa industry regulation is accepted, though <b>non-specific</b> health and safety legislation still applies. In Israel recreational diving activities are regulated by the Recreational Diving Act, 1979.|$|E
5|$|The only useful ways {{to reduce}} the spread of cold viruses are {{physical}} measures such as hand washing and face masks; in the healthcare environment, gowns and disposable gloves are also used. Isolation or quarantine is not used as the disease is so widespread and symptoms are <b>non-specific.</b> Vaccination has proved difficult as there are many viruses involved and they mutate rapidly. Creation of a broadly effective vaccine is, thus, highly improbable.|$|E
5|$|A {{urinary tract}} {{infection}} (UTI) is an infection that affects part of the urinary tract. When it affects the lower urinary tract it {{is known as a}} bladder infection (cystitis) and when it affects the upper urinary tract it is known as kidney infection (pyelonephritis). Symptoms from a lower urinary tract include pain with urination, frequent urination, and feeling the need to urinate despite having an empty bladder. Symptoms of a kidney infection include fever and flank pain usually in addition to the symptoms of a lower UTI. Rarely the urine may appear bloody. In the very old and the very young, symptoms may be vague or <b>non-specific.</b>|$|E
5|$|Around one {{in three}} {{subjects}} develops systemic symptoms; {{after a number of}} hours, or rarely, delayed for more than 24 hours. Symptoms typically include nausea, vomiting, abdominal or chest pain, agitation, headache, generalised sweating and hypertension. Other <b>non-specific</b> systemic effects such as malaise and lethargy are also common. Rarely, other effects are reported such as neurological manifestations, fever and priapism (uncontrolled erection of the penis). Severe pain usually persists for over 24 hours after being bitten. Symptoms of envenomation may linger for weeks or even months. Rare complications include localised skin infection, seizure, coma, pulmonary edema, or respiratory failure. Children, the elderly, or those with serious medical conditions are at much higher risk of severe effects resulting from a bite. Infants have died within hours of a bite, but adult fatalities have taken up to 30 days.|$|E
5|$|Compounds from T. felleus {{have been}} {{extracted}} and researched for potential medical uses. Tylopilan is a beta-glucan that was {{isolated from the}} fruit bodies in 1988 and shown in laboratory tests to have cytotoxic properties and to stimulate <b>non-specific</b> immunological response. In particular, it enhances phagocytosis, {{the process by which}} macrophages and granulocytes engulf and digest foreign bacteria. In experiments on mice with tumour cells, it appeared to have antitumour effects when administered in combination with a preparation of Propionibacterium acnes in a 1994 Polish study. Researchers in 2004 reported that extracts of the fruit body inhibit the enzyme pancreatic lipase; it was the second most inhibitory of 100 mushrooms they tested. A compound present in the mushroom, N-Î³-glutamyl boletine, has mild antibacterial activity.|$|E
5|$|Excessive {{production}} of the thyroid hormones is called hyperthyroidism, which is most commonly a result of Graves' disease, a toxic multinodular goitre, a solitary thyroid adenoma, or inflammation. Other causes include drug-induced excess of iodine, particularly from amiodarone, an antiarrhythmic medication; an excess caused by the preferential uptake of iodine by the thyroid following iodinated contrast imaging; or from pituitary adenomas which may cause an over{{production of}} thyroid stimulating hormone. Hyperthyroidism often causes a variety of <b>non-specific</b> symptoms including weight loss, increased appetite, insomnia, decreased tolerance of heat, tremor, palpitations, anxiety and nervousness. In some cases it can cause chest pain, diarrhoea, hair loss and muscle weakness. Such symptoms may be managed temporarily with drugs such as beta blockers.|$|E
5|$|In 1966, Cooper again won {{re-election}} over John Y. Brown, Sr., by 217,000 votes, {{breaking his}} own record of largest victory margin for a Kentucky senatorial candidate, and carrying {{the vote of}} 110 of Kentucky's 120 counties. In the lead-up to the 1968 Republican presidential primary, he endorsed New York Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller, saying that Americans would only support a candidate who took a clear position on Vietnam. Rockefeller had laid out a plan for reversing the Americanization of the war, while other Republican candidates tried to remain <b>non-specific</b> about how they would handle it. As Rockefeller's candidacy faded, Cooper encouraged his colleague, Kentucky Senator Thruston B. Morton, to seek the presidency, but Morton declined. The nominationâ€“ and eventually, the presidencyâ€“ went to Republican Richard Nixon.|$|E
5|$|In {{the weeks}} leading up to the September 27, 1962, publication, there was strong {{opposition}} to Silent Spring from the chemical industry. DuPont (a main manufacturer of DDT and 2,4-D) and Velsicol Chemical Company (exclusive manufacturer of chlordane and heptachlor) were among the first to respond. DuPont compiled an extensive report on the book's press coverage and estimated impact on public opinion. Velsicol threatened legal action against Houghton Mifflin as well as The New Yorker and Audubon unless the planned Silent Spring features were canceled. Chemical industry representatives and lobbyists also lodged a range of <b>non-specific</b> complaints, some anonymously. Chemical companies and associated organizations produced a number of their own brochures and articles promoting and defending pesticide use. However, Carson's and the publishers' lawyers were confident in the vetting process Silent Spring had undergone. The magazine and book publications proceeded as planned, as did the large Book-of-the-Month printing (which included a pamphlet endorsing the book by William O. Douglas).|$|E
5|$|Initial {{management}} with nonâ€“medication based treatments is recommended. NSAIDs {{are recommended}} {{if these are}} not sufficiently effective. Normal activity should be continued {{as much as the}} pain allows. Medications are recommended for the duration that they are helpful. A number of other options are available {{for those who do not}} improve with usual treatment. Opioids may be useful if simple pain medications are not enough, but they are not generally recommended due to side effects. Surgery may be beneficial for those with disc-related chronic pain and disability or spinal stenosis. No clear benefit has been found for other cases of <b>non-specific</b> low back pain. Low back pain often affects mood, which may be improved by counseling or antidepressants. Additionally, there are many alternative medicine therapies, including the Alexander technique and herbal remedies, but there is not enough evidence to recommend them confidently. The evidence for chiropractic care and spinal manipulation is mixed.|$|E
5|$|Like other animals, fish {{suffer from}} {{diseases}} and parasites. To prevent disease {{they have a}} variety of defenses. <b>Non-specific</b> defenses include the skin and scales, as well as the mucus layer secreted by the epidermis that traps and inhibits the growth of microorganisms. If pathogens breach these defenses, fish can develop an inflammatory response that increases blood flow to the infected region and delivers white blood cells that attempt to destroy pathogens. Specific defenses respond to particular pathogens recognised by the fish's body, i.e., an immune response. In recent years, vaccines have become widely used in aquaculture and also with ornamental fish, for example furunculosis vaccines in farmed salmon and koi herpes virus in koi.|$|E
5|$|Once {{inside the}} skin, dengue virus binds to Langerhans cells (a {{population}} of dendritic {{cells in the}} skin that identifies pathogens). The virus enters the cells through binding between viral proteins and membrane proteins on the Langerhans cell, specifically the C-type lectins called DC-SIGN, mannose receptor and CLEC5A. DC-SIGN, a <b>non-specific</b> receptor for foreign material on dendritic cells, {{seems to be the}} main point of entry. The dendritic cell moves to the nearest lymph node. Meanwhile, the virus genome is translated in membrane-bound vesicles on the cell's endoplasmic reticulum, where the cell's protein synthesis apparatus produces new viral proteins that replicate the viral RNA and begin to form viral particles. Immature virus particles are transported to the Golgi apparatus, the part of the cell where some of the proteins receive necessary sugar chains (glycoproteins). The now mature new viruses are released by exocytosis. They are then able to enter other white blood cells, such as monocytes and macrophages.|$|E
5|$|The Mana {{series is}} the result of Koichi Ishii's desire to create a fictional world. In Ishii's opinion, Mana is not a series of video games, but rather a world which is {{illustrated}} by and can be explored through video games. When working on the series, Koichi Ishii draws inspiration from abstract images from his memories of childhood, as well as movies and fantasy books that captivated him as a child. Ishii takes care to avoid set conventions, and his influences are correspondingly very wide and <b>non-specific.</b> Nonetheless, among his literary influences, he acknowledges Tove Jansson's Moomin, Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, and J. R. R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings.|$|E
5|$|The {{immune system}} protects organisms from {{infection}} with layered defenses of increasing specificity. In simple terms, physical barriers prevent pathogens such as bacteria and viruses {{from entering the}} organism. If a pathogen breaches these barriers, the innate immune system provides an immediate, but <b>non-specific</b> response. Innate immune systems are found in all plants and animals. If pathogens successfully evade the innate response, vertebrates possess a second layer of protection, the adaptive immune system, which is activated by the innate response. Here, the immune system adapts its response during an infection to improve its recognition of the pathogen. This improved response is then retained after the pathogen has been eliminated, {{in the form of}} an immunological memory, and allows the adaptive immune system to mount faster and stronger attacks each time this pathogen is encountered.|$|E
25|$|The partitiveâ€“indefinite pro-clitic re is {{used when}} the NP {{refers to a}} new, <b>non-specific</b> {{instance}} of a notion. In order to understand this concept, compare the English sentences 'I ate a banana ' with 'I want to eat a banana '. Besides being indefinite in both cases, in the first sentence a banana is specific, because it refers to a specific banana; in the second sentence a banana is <b>non-specific,</b> because it can refer to any banana, not one in particular. Although this semantic difference is not grammaticalized in English, it is in Araki, using re as a marker for <b>non-specific</b> indefinite reference.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two views}} of the {{microbiology}} of periodontitis: the specific plaque hypothesis and the <b>non-specific</b> plaque hypothesis.|$|E
25|$|In <b>non-specific</b> usage, {{the term}} Amesha Spenta denotes all the divinities that furthered or {{strengthened}} creation {{and all that}} are bounteous and holy. It not only includes the ahuras (a term that in the Gathas is also used in the plural but only includes Ahura Mazda by name), but also all the other divinities that are alluded to in these texts. In this <b>non-specific</b> sense of the term, Amesha Spenta is then equivalent to the term yazata.|$|E
25|$|Tests for C-reactive {{protein and}} {{erythrocyte}} sedimentation rate are <b>non-specific</b> tests {{that can be done}} to corroborate the diagnosis of the syndrome.|$|E
25|$|A {{minority}} {{of cases of}} H. pylori infection will eventually lead to an ulcer and {{a larger proportion of}} people will get <b>non-specific</b> discomfort, abdominal pain or gastritis.|$|E
25|$|Plain X-rays {{are often}} normal or show <b>non-specific</b> findings. In {{a series of}} 73 patients, plain {{abdominal}} radiography (56%) showing colic distension in 53% or a pneumoperitoneum in 3%.|$|E
25|$|Elevated LDH can be {{an early}} {{clinical}} sign of a rare malignant cell tumor called a dysgerminoma. Not all dysgerminomas produce LDH, and this is often a <b>non-specific</b> finding.|$|E
25|$|This general, <b>non-specific,</b> {{meaning of}} the term Amesha Spenta also has an {{equivalent}} in the Vedic Sanskrit Vishve Amrtas, which is the collective term for all supernatural beings (lit: 'all immortals').|$|E
25|$|Radioligands {{are used}} to measure the ligand binding to receptors and should ideally have high affinity, low <b>non-{{specific}}</b> binding, high specific activity to detect low receptor densities, and receptor specificity.|$|E
25|$|Those {{opposed to}} dental amalgam suggest that mercury from dental amalgam {{may lead to}} nephrotoxicity, neurobehavioural changes, autoimmunity, {{oxidative}} stress, autism, skin and mucosa alterations, <b>non-specific</b> symptoms and complaints, Alzheimer's disease, and multiple sclerosis.|$|E
