40|$|Error {{correction}} {{and message}} authentication are well {{studied in the}} literature, and various efficient solutions have been suggested and analyzed. This is however {{not the case for}} data streams in which the message is very long, possibly infinite, and not known in advance to the sender. Trivial solutions for error-correcting and authenticating data streams either suffer from a long delay at the receiver’s end or cannot perform well when the communication channel is noisy. In this work we suggest a constant-rate error-correction scheme and an efficient authentication scheme for data streams over a noisy channel (one-way communication, no feedback) in the shared-randomness model. Our first scheme does not assume shared randomness and (non-efficiently) recovers a (1 [*]−[*] 2 c) -fraction prefix of the stream sent so far, assuming the noise level is at most c[*]<[*] 1 / 2. The length of the recovered prefix is tight. To be able to overcome the c[*]=[*] 1 / 2 barrier we relax the model and assume the parties pre-share a secret key. Under this assumption we show that for any given <b>noise</b> <b>rate</b> c[*]<[*] 1, there exists a scheme that correctly decodes a (1 [*]−[*]c) -fraction of the stream sent so far with high probability, and moreover, the scheme is efficient. Furthermore, if the <b>noise</b> <b>rate</b> exceeds c, the scheme aborts with high probability. We also show that no constant-rate authentication scheme recovers more than a (1 [*]−[*]c) -fraction of the stream sent so far with non-negligible probability, thus the relation between the <b>noise</b> <b>rate</b> and recoverable fraction of the stream is tight, and our scheme is optimal. Our techniques also apply to the task of interactive communication (two-way communication) over a noisy channel. In a recent paper, Braverman and Rao [STOC 2011] show that any function of two inputs has a constant-rate interactive protocol for two users that withstands a <b>noise</b> <b>rate</b> up to 1 / 4. By assuming that the parties share a secret random string, we extend this result and construct an interactive protocol that succeeds with overwhelming probability against <b>noise</b> <b>rates</b> up to 1 / 2.

40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effects of noise from building mechanical systems with time-varying fluctuations on human task performance and perception, and to determine how well current indoor <b>noise</b> <b>rating</b> methods account for this performance and perception. Six different noise conditions with varying degrees of time-varying fluctuations, many focused in the low frequency rumble region, were reproduced in an office-like setting. Thirty participants were asked to complete typing, grammatical reasoning, and math tasks plus subjective questionnaires, while being exposed for approximately one hour to each noise condition. Results show that the noise conditions with higher sound levels (greater than 50 dBA) combined with excessive low frequency rumble as well as those with larger timescale fluctuations (i. e., a heat pump cycling on and off every 30 seconds) were generally perceived to be more annoying than the other signals tested, although statistically significant negative relationships to task performance were not found. Other findings are (1) that the noise characteristics most closely correlated to higher annoyance/distraction responses in this study were higher ratings of loudness followed by roar, rumble, and changes in time; and (2) that perception of more low frequency rumble in particular was significantly linked to reduced performance on cognitively demanding tasks. As for the ability of current indoor <b>noise</b> <b>rating</b> systems to match human performance or perception, none of the indoor <b>noise</b> <b>rating</b> methods evaluated were significantly correlated to task performance, but aspects of subjective perception such as loudness ratings were statistically related.

We consider {{a new class of}} non-robust protocols for Interactive Communication, which we call adaptive protocols.

As a result, noise was classified as a non-specific stressor, which could cause an ergotropic activation of the complete organism. In the light of this background research a hypothesis was proposed that long-term noise exposure could have an adverse effect on health. This hypothesis was further supported by animal studies. Since the sixties, the adverse effects of chronic road traffic noise exposure were further examined in humans {{with the help of}} epidemiological studies. More epidemiological aircraft noise studies followed in the 1970 s and thereafter. The sample size was increased, relevant confounding factors were taken into account, and the exposure and health outcomes were investigated objectively and with higher quality measures.

In particular, the newer German noise studies demonstrate a clear association between residential exposure to traffic noise (particularly night noise) and cardiovascular outcomes.

40|$|Opencast and {{underground}} mining operations produce large quantities of dust as well noise due to increased mechanisation to augment production and enhance productivity {{to meet the demands}} of consumer industry. Exposure of miners to high concentrations of dust and noise may cause occupational health hazards like pneumoconiosis and noise induced hearing loss and other allied health risk. Health risk to miners from dust depends on dust size, concentration and duration of exposure whereas noise induced hearing loss depends on sound pressure level, frequency and exposure level of workers. Exposure of workers to dust concentrations and sound pressure levels beyond threshold limit values as prescribed limits by statutory enactments and guidelines may adversely affect the health of mine workers. To assess the status of dust concentrations and noise levels generated by various machines and exposure levels of workers, conduct of systematic dust and noise survey in mines is essential. It will help in assessing the situation vis-a-vis dust and noise standards so that effective dust and noise control strategies can be adopted to minimize their menace. Keeping this in view, this project work was undertaken to carry out dust and noise survey in an iron ore mine of SAIL. From dust and noise survey carried out in Bolani iron ore mines, it was observed that: -> The dust level at the mine site office was minimum (0. 14 mg/m 3) whereas the maximum dust level was found at the crusher plant area (3. 1 mg/m 3). The dust concentration at lump loading station, fine loading station, mine face and mine site office was less than safe working limit(3 mg/m 3) whereas at the washing plant and crusher plant area were found more than the safe working limit. -> The noise level at the secondary cone crusher was maximum (102. 2 dBA) whereas at the control room minimum (76. 2 dBA). The noise level at dumper, drill machine, drum scrubber, double deck screen and dewatering screen was more than 90 dBA which is maximum permissible limit for 8 hrs working period.

For this reason, it {{is concerned with}} ways to further reduce the noise generated by individual motor vehicles. From this aspect, first, <b>noise</b> <b>rating</b> scales {{for the amount of}} noise from individual vehicles, which can be evaluated not only physically (LAE and Lmax [dB]) but also psychologically (annoyance), were composed experimentally with the road vehicle noise simulator proposed in the previous papers [1][2]. Secondly, to attain the above standard values, the safety regulation values were verified in Nagano City. From the <b>noise</b> <b>rating</b> scales obtained, it can be found as follows: (a) In the case of steady running noise, “a little annoying ” corresponds to LAE= 76 dB (Lmax= 74 dB) and “annoying ” to 82 dB (80 dB). (b) In the case of accelerated running noise, “a little annoying” corresponds to 69 dB (65 dB) and “annoying ” to 78 dB (74 dB). Next, from the results (each LAeq, 10 min is from 71. 0 dB to 74. 4 dB at a straight road, and 68. 3 dB to 71. 7 dB at a crossroads) measured at 7. 5 m from a microphone to a traffic line for 24 hours on weekdays, it can be predicted that, to attain the above standard values for all times and anywhere, it is necessary to regulate all of individual motor vehicles under Lmax= 74 dB.

This phenomenon provides a possible explanation to the emergence of classical behavior in such systems.

This is the first efficient algorithm for learning under isotropic log-concave distributions in the presence of malicious noise.

In the adversarial label noise setting (or agnostic model), labels can be noisy, but not example points themselves. Previous results could handle η = Ω(ǫ) but had running time exponential in an unspecified function of 1 /ǫ. Our analysis crucially exploits both concentration and anti-concentration properties of isotropic log-concave distributions.

The results were analyzed to evaluate a number of <b>noise</b> <b>rating</b> procedures, in terms of their ability to accurately estimate both relative and absolute perceived noise levels over a wider dynamic range (84 - 115 dB SPL) than had generally been used in previous experiments. Performances of the different scales were examined in detail for different aircraft categories, and the merits of different band level summation procedures, frequency weighting functions, duration and tone corrections were investigated...|$|E
50|$|Cadrete is a {{small town}} in {{north-east}} Spain, close to Zaragoza. It is notable for its Muslim castle, Mudejar Church and famous Cardoons. More recently, a massive wind-turbine has been installed at less than 300 metres away from the village, producing several landscape damages and high <b>noise</b> <b>rates</b> for town's inhabitants.|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} a simple algorithm that runs in time poly(n, 1 /γ, 1 /ε) and learns an unknown n-dimensional γ-margin halfspace to accuracy 1 − ε {{in the presence}} of malicious noise, when the <b>noise</b> <b>rate</b> is allowed to be as high as Θ(εγ √ log(1 /γ)). Previous efficient algorithms could only learn to accuracy ε {{in the presence of}} malicious <b>noise</b> of <b>rate</b> at most Θ(εγ). Our algorithm does not work by optimizing a convex loss function. We show that no algorithm for learning γ-margin halfspaces that minimizes a convex proxy for misclassification error can tolerate malicious <b>noise</b> at a <b>rate</b> greater than Θ(εγ); this may partially explain why previous algorithms could not achieve the higher noise tolerance of our new algorithm...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} {{one-dimensional}} version of Axelrod's model of cultural transmission {{from the point}} of view of optimization dynamics. We show the existence of a Lyapunov potential for the dynamics. The global minimum of the potential, or optimum state, is the monocultural uniform state, which is reached for an initial diversity of the population below a critical value. Above this value, the dynamics settles in a multicultural or polarized state. These multicultural attractors are not local minima of the potential, so that any small perturbation initiates the search for the optimum state. Cultural drift is modelled by such perturbations acting at a nite <b>rate.</b> If the <b>noise</b> <b>rate</b> is small, the system reaches the optimummonocultural state. However, if the <b>noise</b> <b>rate</b> is above a critical value, that depends on the system size, noise sustains a polarized dynamical state...|$|R
