5|$|The Drexler–Smalley {{debate on}} {{molecular}} nanotechnology {{was a public}} dispute between K. Eric Drexler, the originator of the conceptual basis of molecular nanotechnology, and Richard Smalley, a recipient of the 1996 Nobel prize in Chemistry for {{the discovery of the}} <b>nanomaterial</b> buckminsterfullerene. The dispute was about the feasibility of constructing molecular assemblers, which are molecular machines which could robotically assemble molecular materials and devices by manipulating individual atoms or molecules. The concept of molecular assemblers was central to Drexler's conception of molecular nanotechnology, but Smalley argued that fundamental physical principles would prevent them from ever being possible. The two also traded accusations that the other's conception of nanotechnology was harmful to public perception of the field and threatened continued public support for nanotechnology research.|$|E
5|$|Zinc oxide {{nanoparticles}} {{can enhance}} the antibacterial activity of ciprofloxacin. It {{has been shown that}} nano ZnO which has the average size between 20nm and 45nm {{can enhance the}} antibacterial activity of ciprofloxacin against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli in vitro. The enhancing effect of this <b>nanomaterial</b> is concentration dependent against all test strains. This effect may be due to two reasons. First, zinc oxide nanoparticles can interfere with NorA protein, which is developed for conferring resistance in bacteria and has pumping activity that mediate the effluxing of hydrophilic fluoroquinolones from a cell. Second, zinc oxide nanoparticles can interfere with Omf protein, which is responsible for the permeation of quinolone antibiotics into the cell.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Carbon <b>nanomaterials</b> such as fullerene, carbon {{nanotube}} and graphene are representative <b>nanomaterials</b> and {{widely used in}} various fields. Carbon <b>nanomaterials</b> can be exposed to environments during their production, usage and disposal, spreading to different systems and posing a great threat to various ecological receptors. Researches are conducted {{in order to determine}} the possibility of groundwater exposure to carbon <b>nanomaterials</b> due to their release and passage through soils. If soils can play a significant role in limiting the transport of carbon <b>nanomaterials,</b> the possibility of groundwater exposure to carbon <b>nanomaterials</b> can be reduced greatly. This review paper presented the research works performed for the mobility of carbon <b>nanomaterials</b> in soil media. Also, the paper provided the factors affecting the transport of carbon <b>nanomaterials</b> in soil media along with the DLVO theory/colloid filtration theory/transport model, which are used to describe the transport of carbon <b>nanomaterials</b> in soil media.

Recently, development in nanotechnology has led to the use of <b>nanomaterials</b> in many different fields. On the other hand, increasing use of <b>nanomaterials</b> has resulted in release of these materials to the environment. Therefore, before employing these materials in biological and living systems, they should be evaluated in terms of biocompatibility and distribution. Although the toxic effects of <b>nanomaterials</b> on living organisms, {{human health and the environment}} have been studied by some researchers, there are too much uncertainty regarding the effects and mechanisms of toxicity of <b>nanomaterials.</b> Therefore, understanding the toxicity effects of <b>nanomaterials</b> is highly desirable. Cellular uptake mechanisms and dispersion of <b>nanomaterials</b> in biological environments depend on their physicochemical properties. Therefore, knowledge of the unique characteristics of <b>nanomaterials</b> and the interactions of <b>nanomaterials</b> with biological systems, are important criteria for the safe use of <b>nanomaterials.</b> Properties of <b>nanomaterials</b> such as size, shape, aspect ratio, density, surface and structural defects and dissolving rate are the main causes of cytotoxicity and side effects of these materials in the body.
