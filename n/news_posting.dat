40|$|This paper uses a {{combination}} of quantitative content analysis and in-depth interviews to gain an understanding specifically of the Facebook news feed of Dutch public broadcaster NOS regarding 1) the form and content of news coverage on the Facebook page, 2) what the public does with this news, and 3) whether the editorial staff takes {{the behavior of the}} public and the media logic of the social platform into account. The results show that there is a relatively balanced distribution of the topics and the various news values, which pleases the editors without them intentionally pursuing it. Soft news elicits more ‘likes’, while hard news seems more suitable for comments. In terms of form, {{it is clear that the}} editors as well as news consumers consider Facebook as a visual medium.

40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. November 2011. Major: Communication Studies. Advisor: Ascan Koerner, PH. D., 1 {{computer}} file (PDF) ix, 283 pages, appendices A-C. In {{a study of}} self-disclosure and intimacy on Facebook, research {{in a survey of}} 274 undergraduates found interaction processes generally conformed to those found in face-to-face interactions. However, four findings from this study, in particular, elaborate how self-disclosure operates in a Facebook social media context. First, as in the face-to-face context, self-disclosure and partner disclosure were directly related to greater feelings of intimacy. But in contrast to face-to-face communication, in a test of the interpersonal process model of intimacy (Reis & Shaver, 1988), perceived partner responsiveness fully mediated the effect of self-disclosure on intimacy for a self-disclosure Facebook status update. Second, those who self-disclose on Facebook tend to expect and receive positive responses from Facebook friends, and self-disclosers generally classify this positive feedback as an expression of emotionally supportive caring, respect, and/or liking. Third, when participants receive unexpected responses to status updates, these surprise responses (expectancy violations) are generally viewed as positive. Expectancy violations to a self-disclosure status update on Facebook were significantly positively correlated with perceived partner responsiveness and greater change in intimacy toward those who responded unexpectedly. Fourth, in contrast to face-to-face communication, no gender differences were found in self-disclosure behavior, closeness with Facebook partners, or change in intimacy on Facebook {{as a result of a}} self-disclosure status update. Additionally, associations between attachment, frequent Facebook participation, relationship type, self-monitoring, and intimacy in Facebook interactions involving participant self-disclosures and responses from Facebook friends resulted in weak or inconsistent findings. The survey also explored participants' motivations for posting a status update, finding that sharing <b>news,</b> <b>posting</b> humorous information, and seeking emotional support were common reasons to post a status update. Motivations for responding to someone else's status update included sharing close feelings and humor...|$|E

The factors include journal impact factor, individual collaboration, international collaboration, institution prestige, country prestige, research funding, abstract readability, abstract length, title length, number of cited references, field size, and field type and will be modelled in association with citation counts, Mendeley readers, Twitter posts, Facebook posts, blog <b>posts,</b> and <b>news</b> <b>posts.</b> The results demonstrate that eight factors are important for increased citation counts, seven different factors are important for increased Mendeley readers, eight factors are important for increased Twitter posts, three factors are important for increased Facebook posts, six factors are important for increased blog posts, and five factors are important for increased <b>news</b> <b>posts.</b> Journal impact factor and international collaboration are the two factors that significantly associate with increased citation counts and with all altmetric scores.
