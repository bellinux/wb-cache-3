5|$|As study {{caught up}} to the wealth of new {{material}} from western North America, and venues for depictions proliferated, dinosaurs gained in popularity. The paintings of Charles R.

5|$|There is {{evidence}} that Emanuel Swedenborg first proposed parts of the nebular hypothesis in 1734. Immanuel Kant, familiar with Swedenborg's work, developed the theory further in 1755, publishing his own Universal <b>Natural</b> <b>History</b> <b>and</b> Theory of the Heavens, wherein he argued that gaseous clouds (nebulae) slowly rotate, gradually collapse and flatten due to gravity, eventually forming stars and planets.|$|E
5|$|Back in Uppsala, Linnaeus' {{relations}} with Nils Rosén worsened, and thus he gladly accepted {{an invitation from}} the student Claes Sohlberg to spend the Christmas holiday in Falun with Sohlberg's family. Sohlberg's father was a mining inspector, and let Linnaeus visit the mines near Falun. Sohlberg's father suggested to Linnaeus he should bring Sohlberg to the Dutch Republic and continue to tutor him there for an annual salary. At that time, the Dutch Republic {{was one of the}} most revered places to study <b>natural</b> <b>history</b> <b>and</b> a common place for Swedes to take their doctoral degree; Linnaeus, who was interested in both of these, accepted.|$|E

5|$|Balaenidae {{consists}} of two genera: Eubalaena (right whales) and Balaena (the bowhead whale, B. mysticetus). Balaenidae was thought to have consisted of only one genus until studies done through the early 2000s reported that bowhead whales and right whales are morphologically (different skull shape) and phylogenically different. According to a study done by H. C. Rosenbaum (of the American Museum of <b>Natural</b> <b>History)</b> <b>and</b> colleagues, the North Pacific (E. japonica) and Southern right (E. australis) whales are {{more closely related to}} each other than to the North Atlantic right whale (E. glacialis).|$|E
5|$|Balch became {{interested}} in stratigraphy and cave archaeology after attending a talk by William Boyd Dawkins. Balch led much of the exploration through the caves near Wookey Hole village, discovering and mapping many caves. He also made discoveries of artefacts used {{by the people who}} lived in the caves during the Iron Age. Balch was a founder member of the Wells <b>Natural</b> <b>History</b> <b>and</b> Archaeology Society and through the society he founded the Wells Museum, largely including his own collection of artefacts.|$|E
5|$|Balch was {{a founder}} {{member of the}} Wells <b>Natural</b> <b>History</b> <b>and</b> Archaeological Society, using his {{connections}} at Wells Cathedral to organise lectures. It was through the society and with help of Thomas Jex-Blake, Dean of Wells, that Balch managed {{to set up the}} Wells Museum in 1893, displaying his own artefacts in the cathedral's cloister. The museum had grown significantly by 1928 so Balch persuaded William Wyndham to purchase a property for the museum on the cathedral green. In 1932, the museum was relocated to the cathedral green, eventually becoming the Wells and Mendip Museum. He remained honorary curator of the Wells Museum throughout his life.|$|E

Robert Darwin, himself quietly a freethinker, had baby Charles baptised in November 1809 in the Anglican St Chad's Church, Shrewsbury, but Charles and his siblings attended the Unitarian chapel with their mother. The eight-year-old Charles {{already had a}} taste for <b>natural</b> <b>history</b> <b>and</b> collecting {{when he joined the}} day school run by its preacher in 1817. That July, his mother died. From September 1818, he joined his older brother Erasmus attending the nearby Anglican Shrewsbury School as a boarder.|$|E
