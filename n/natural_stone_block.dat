40|$|This paper {{presents}} the analytical {{study on the}} dynamic response of a <b>natural</b> <b>stone</b> <b>block</b> masonry minaret of a historical mosque located in Istanbul, Turkey. A three-dimensional finite element model of the whole minaret, adjusted with former in situ ambient vibration test results, was used {{in order to get}} probable lateral displacements, stresses, and understanding of failure modes under seismic loading. Particularly, FEM has been used to evaluate the seismic safety of the minaret in present-day condition and after the application of a proposed strengthening method. In this method, by utilizing the fiber reinforced cementitious matrix (FRCM) material, the critical cross-sections were jacketed. The appearing damage for the bare minaret obtained from FEM analyses was located at the boot and transition part of the minaret. After FRCM material was wrapped around these critical cross-sections, the analytical results indicated that such method appears effective in terms of the seismic response. It also appears less invasive in terms of the conservation of historical heritage like minarets without causing aesthetic conflict on the existing structure when compared to other available techniques...|$|E

40|$|The {{possibility}} to use modern information and computer technologies {{to develop an}} integrated methodology for determining the optimum direction of mining works in the extraction of <b>natural</b> <b>stone</b> <b>blocks</b> is studied. The communication of the anisotropic properties with the crystalline structure of <b>natural</b> <b>stone</b> and its genesis as a rock is considered. The method of determining anisotropy mechanical properties of <b>natural</b> <b>stone</b> based on digital video processing and determine the optimum direction of mining works on this basis is proposed. The tasks of the decorative approach are explained, specifically to obtain blocks with predetermined indicators of decorative (which will not always be the maximum; for example, clearly defined, {{for the needs of}} restorers). The obtained results can be used to determine the direction of carrying out mining operations after a comprehensive analysis and for maximize the profits of the enterprise...|$|R
50|$|In the early-1970s Marcello Toncelli, {{founder of}} Breton, started {{developing}} the Bretonstone system, which allows {{to produce a}} solid surface similar to granite, using small stone aggregates and stone-like materials.

40|$|Up to {{the middle}} of this century many coastal {{structures}} were built from blockwork, using either <b>natural</b> <b>stone</b> <b>blocks</b> or concrete blocks. Those blockwork structures subjected to breaking wave impacts often show a particular damage type, whereby individual blocks are shifted out of their position and moved into the sea. Engineers have suspected {{for a long time that}} wave impact pressures can travel into the water filled cracks and joints of such structures, building up pressures inside of the structure and thus destroying the structure from within. In order to verify the damage mechanism, and to investigate the characteristics of impact induced pressure pulses, model tests on the propagation of wave impact pressures into water filled cracks were conducted. It was found that impact generated pressure pulses can enter water filled cracks and that they exhibit wave-like characteristics such as finite propagation speed, reflection, superposition and attenuation. Changes in cross section were found not to affect pressure pulse magnitude or duration. The possibility of wave impact pressures to damage or destroy cracked or fissured structures from within the structure could thus be verified...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Exploitation and {{processing}} of small <b>stone</b> <b>blocks</b> and tombolons {{has a major}} impact on profitability. It is pointed out that the <b>natural</b> <b>stone</b> needs to be rationally used in deposits. Resources of rock mass tend to be greatly increased due to the utilization of different sizes of blocks in deposits or quarries. This approach encourages the application of Lasky's relationship in the deposits of <b>natural</b> <b>stone</b> and quarries. Based on this relationship we can simply say that if the sizes of <b>stone</b> <b>blocks</b> and other <b>stone</b> products decrease arithmetically, then reserves increase geometrically or exponentially. On the presented examples, the utilization of the rock mass was analysed by the application of two different technologies of exploitation. Besides, if the exploitation of <b>stone</b> <b>blocks</b> of different sizes achieves high utilization of the rock mass, then exploitation of aggregates and fillers increases much more. It is necessary to emphasize the existence of the border area based on favourable discontinuity density and spatial discontinuity position. Decision should be made whether to apply I or II variant of the exploitation (making vertical and horizontal cuttings or separation of the blocks along natural discontinuities, or using slanting cuts). The example is shown and analysed as a two-dimensional problem...|$|R

As a result of this awareness, this fortress was built in the 29th year (1703) of the reign of King Sukjong. The inner and the outer walls were mainly built of <b>natural</b> <b>stones,</b> but weak portions were reinforced with artificially worked square <b>stone</b> <b>blocks.</b> The walls are about 17 kilometers in length and from 1.5 meters to 3 meters in height.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a comprehensive approach}} to the evaluation of macroscopic material parameters for <b>natural</b> <b>stone</b> and quarry masonry. To that end, a reliable non-linear material model on a meso-scale is developed to cover the random arrangement of <b>stone</b> <b>blocks</b> and quasi-brittle behaviour of both basic components, {{as well as the}} impaired cohesion and tensile strength on the interface between the blocks and mortar joints. The paper thus interrelates the following three problems: (i) definition of a suitable periodic unit cell (PUC) representing a particular masonry structure; (ii) derivation of material parameters of individual constituents either experimentally or running a mixed numerical-experimental problem; (iii) assessment of the macroscopic material parameters including the tensile and compressive strengths and fracture energy.

40|$|Based on the {{distribution}} of the <b>stone</b> <b>blocks</b> in outwash deposits, the paper present a modeling method for the random structure of outwash deposits, in which the long axis of the <b>stone</b> <b>blocks</b> is supposed obeying a lognormal distribution. Then numerical experiments of biaxial compression using the granular discrete element method are used in the macro- and micro parametric analysis. The influences of strength of the cementation, the sizes of <b>stone</b> <b>blocks,</b> and the content of <b>stone</b> <b>blocks</b> on the peak compressive and shear strength are discussed. The micromechanical parameters of the outwash deposits are also analyzed. The proposed method offers a supplement to the mechanical characterization of outwash deposits and accounts for the limitation that indoor experiments cannot consider large <b>stone</b> <b>blocks...</b>|$|R
50|$|A bronze {{medallion}} of Otto von Bismarck, {{a bronze}} bust of the German emperor Wilhelm I and his popular but short reigning successor Friedrich III {{were signs of}} the patriotism and the Bismarck-cult in the 1880s and the early 1900s. In 1909, the Bismarck pyramid was built up with <b>natural</b> granite <b>stone</b> <b>blocks</b> centrally located in city's park (Stadtpark) and topped by a Prussian eagle. The latter became a victim of vandalism after World War I. In 1942, the bust of the liberal, but among the Nazis unpopular, emperor Friedrich III was melted down. Wilhelm's bust was transferred into the Stadtpark, which had become a haven for unwanted history. The bust is since more than 30 years damaged by vandalism and hard to find, hidden behind bushes. The Bismarck-medallion was removed from its central location and attached to one red granite <b>stone</b> <b>block</b> which was leisurely placed under trees in a distance but still visible from the walkway.The names of the fallen soldiers of World War I from the municipality of Versmold are remembered on a monument {{in front of the}} Protestant St. Petri church, a column crowned by an eagle (see image). The victims of World War II found in September 1961 a place of commemoration in a small park, which is now behind the town hall in the form of six meter high bronze crosses on granite base and a bronze flambeaux. It was designed by the sculptor Bernhard Kleinhans. In difference to the then common memorials, it does not name the victims. This small park with a bronze lectern is staged for official ceremonies. In September 2000, a memorial for the murdered Jewish population was set {{up in the middle of}} the town, very prominently, right in front of the town hall. It lists the names of the local victims of the Holocaust. Most prominent among them figures the family Spiegel. The design was developed by two students and their teacher from the local highschool. The historian Reinhart Koselleck cited the difference in the naming of the murdered Jewish citizens and the anonymity of memory for the fallen soldiers and immediate victims of World War II in Versmold as example of how the Germans deal with their recent history in the collective memory.|$|R
