5|$|Joseph Weizenbaum's ELIZA {{could carry}} out conversations {{that were so}} {{realistic}} that users occasionally were fooled into thinking they were communicating with {{a human being and}} not a program. But in fact, ELIZA had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> she was talking about. She simply gave a canned response or repeated back what was said to her, rephrasing her response with a few grammar rules. ELIZA was the first chatterbot.|$|E
5|$|Agents Scully and Doggett {{arrive at}} the {{operations}} center to investigate. However, they are rudely greeted by Deputy Chief Karras and Lieutenant Bianco of the transit police; the two eagerly want the FBI {{to get the job}} done fast in order that subways can be reopened in five hours, and Karras is also irritated that Scully performed an autopsy on the body. Even after an autopsy, Scully has <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> killed the man, and the CDC is unable to find any biological or chemical agents in the subway.|$|E
5|$|Chadwick's Clerk-Maxwell studentship {{expired in}} 1923, {{and he was}} succeeded by the Russian {{physicist}} Pyotr Kapitza. The Chairman of the Advisory Council of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, Sir William McCormick arranged for Chadwick to become Rutherford's assistant director of research. In this role, Chadwick helped Rutherford select PhD students. Over {{the next few years}} these would include John Cockcroft, Norman Feather and Mark Oliphant, who would become firm friends with Chadwick. As many students had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> they wanted to research, Rutherford and Chadwick would suggest topics. Chadwick edited all the papers produced by the laboratory.|$|E

5|$|During a {{surprise}} {{inspection of the}} Springfield Nuclear Power Plant from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Homer is placed in a test module van that simulates an emergency. He has <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> to do and starts pressing buttons at random, somehow causing a nuclear meltdown {{even though there was}} no nuclear material inside the van. The NRC officials tell Mr. Burns that Homer's job requires college training in nuclear physics, and that he must go back to college to keep his job. Homer is rejected by every college he applies to, but Mr. Burns helps him get into Springfield University.|$|E
5|$|He {{writes that}} these {{positive}} results are achieved {{in a number}} of ways. Sometimes the industry-sponsored studies are flawed by design (for example by comparing the new drug to an existing drug at an inadequate dose), and sometimes patients are selected to make a positive result more likely. In addition, the data is analysed as the trial progresses. If the trial seems to be producing negative data it is stopped prematurely and the results are not published, or if it is producing positive data it may be stopped early so that longer-term effects are not examined. He writes that this publication bias, where negative results remain unpublished, is endemic within medicine and academia. As a consequence, he argues, doctors may have <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> the effects are of the drugs they prescribe.|$|E
5|$|In their {{forty years}} of {{practice}} after leaving medical school, doctors hear about what works through ad hoc oral traditions, from sales reps, colleagues or journals. But those colleagues {{can be in the}} pay of drug companies– often undisclosed– and the journals are too. And so are the patient groups. And finally, academic papers, which everyone thinks of as objective, are often covertly planned and written by people who work directly for the companies, without disclosure. Sometimes whole academic journals are even owned outright by one drug company. Aside from all this, for several of the most important and enduring problems in medicine, we have <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> the best treatment is, because it's not in anyone's financial interest to conduct any trials at all.|$|E

5000|$|While growing up, Marques became {{disturbed}} by the worsening state of his country: “I {{had never heard of}} a lawyer, had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> of <b>what</b> human rights were, <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> of <b>what</b> fighting corruption was”, he later recalled. “I realised that the way of addressing the issues that concerned me was by being a journalist.” ...|$|R
5|$|Meanwhile, Stafford and Cernan, still {{circling}} in {{the clouds}} in the second T-38, had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> had happened to their flight partners. Air traffic controllers were confused by the two planes in flight attempting different abort actions after the initial missed approach, and moreover {{no one on the}} ground knew who was in the crashed plane. After some delay, Stafford and Cernan were asked to identify themselves and given permission to land, but they were not informed of the crash until on the ground. Although personally distraught over the loss of his close colleagues and friends, Stafford acted as NASA's chief contact on the scene until other personnel arrived to relieve him later in the day.|$|E
5|$|At the time, {{very few}} people in Wales had seen an opera, and they had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> it was like. The opera {{programmes}} provided explanations, especially that the singers would wear costumes but would not be acting. Those {{who were members of}} Welsh nonconformist churches needed reassurance {{that this was not a}} theatrical performance, as acting and theatres were held in as much contempt as taverns. Parry was raised in the nonconformist Annibynwyr Chapel and adhered to the tenets of his faith for his entire life. The majority of participants in the first performance of Blodwen were music students of Parry; his two older sons were also part of the production, playing piano and harmonium. Before the performance, Parry spoke to the audience. He repeated what had been printed in the programmes: that the participants were not acting and explained to those gathered what an opera was. Despite this, there were some clergymen who were not pleased.|$|E
5|$|It is a {{new year}} at McKinley High. New Directions glee club {{director}} Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) and guidance counselor Emma Pillsbury (Jayma Mays) are now sharing an apartment and a bed. Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch), coach of the Cheerios cheerleading squad, is running for Congress but doing badly in the polls. Glee club member Mike Chang (Harry Shum, Jr.) is now a senior, while fellow members Tina Cohen-Chang (Jenna Ushkowitz) and Artie Abrams (Kevin McHale) are juniors. Club co-captain Finn Hudson (Cory Monteith), a senior, has <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> to do about his future. Mercedes Jones (Amber Riley) has a new boyfriend (LaMarcus Tinker); her former boyfriend Sam Evans (Chord Overstreet) moved to another state. Three New Directions members have left: Sam, Lauren Zizes (Ashley Fink), who also broke up with Puck (Mark Salling), and Sam's ex-girlfriend Quinn Fabray (Dianna Agron), who has completely reinvented herself with pink hair, a nose ring and a tattoo; she has taken up smoking, and has made friends {{with a group of}} outcast girls called the Skanks. She refuses to rejoin either the Cheerios or New Directions.|$|E

5|$|When he auditioned, Hertzberg had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> Adam {{would look}} like in full costume and make-up. Buffy used a company named Optic Nerve to build the {{materials}} to make Hertzberg look like a demonoid. Almost immediately after Hertzberg got the part, Optic Nerve sketched and sculpted Adam's appearance. They had Hertzberg come in to have molds made for prosthetic parts to fit his head and face, arms, chest, and legs, then he was fitted for contact lenses. They also created separate hands and a chest to film for close-up shots. Adam has a floppy disk drive mounted on his chest which, when used, had to be filmed without Hertzberg behind it. The entire construction of Adam's appearance took about two weeks. Hertzberg's voice was also modified post-production. When he saw the full Adam prosthetic and costume, his biggest concern was being able to show nuanced facial expressions under so much latex. It took hours to get Hertzberg into his full costume, but even after it was fully applied on set, often {{he would have to}} wait even longer before he went in front of the cameras. He spoke of the need to stay focused during all the waiting while sweating underneath everything he wore for the part.|$|E

50|$|Apart {{from this}} {{tendency}} Johnny is almost unnaturally normal. His friend Kirsty often gets exasperated by his tendency to simply accept that strange {{things happen to}} him, rather than doing something about it.

25|$|Shortly after Blue Star, Parmar {{visited the}} auto {{mechanic}} and electrician Inderjit Singh Reyat, {{who lived in}} Duncan, British Columbia, a small community north of Victoria on Vancouver Island. He asked him to construct a bomb; Reyat later claimed he had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> it would be used for. Reyat asked various {{people in the community}} about dynamite, saying he wanted to remove tree stumps on his property. Reyat also discussed explosives with a co-worker, while expressing anger at the Indian government and Indira Gandhi in particular.|$|E
25|$|With the {{decision}} made, the Air Ministry finally allowed window {{to be used}} in July 1943. It was used {{for the first time on}} a raid on Hamburg on the night of 24/25 July 1943. The effects were spectacular; having become accustomed to using radar to guide their defences, window produced so many false targets that the operators had <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> to do. AA guns were seen to fire randomly into the sky while night fighters flew in circles. The attacking force lost only 12 aircraft, 1.5% of the force, about what would be expected from entirely random events.|$|E
