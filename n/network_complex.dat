5000|$|In New South Wales, Australia, train {{controllers}} and the Telephone Train Control System {{have survived}} {{to the present}} under RailCorp, despite the advent of power signal boxes and other improved technical provisions for signalmen. These train controllers have gradually assumed theoretical and actual safe working responsibility, stemming from a process of consolidation and restructure in the 1980s and facilitated by considerable changes to the rules and regulations. The nett result of these changes was far-reaching, with fewer train controller positions, but an expanded train controller duty statement, diminished overall responsibility for signalmen (at least theoretically) and more direct involvement by train controllers in work previously managed by signalmen. It is doubtful that these changes have led to an overall improvement in train working efficiency and, significantly, {{it was not until}} circa 2000 that the train control system was ever properly enforced. With signalmen relieved of the right to make a large proportion of train working decisions themselves, the limitations of the train control system mentioned above became acutely apparent. Furthermore, the additional link in the chain of safety-critical communication has been identified as a risk by industry experts and railwaymen alike. The change, apparently influenced by a revised corporate outlook (since 1988) and a modern management culture with elements of postmodern business ideology, favoured a network overseen by a small number of controllers using a computerized, largely automated signalling system and simplified timetable. The old vertically integrated state-owned railway, which was operated almost solely by blue-collar workers, front-line managers such as station masters, with a small number of managers and engineers above, has fallen out of favour since the 1980s. Today, the railway and workforce generally have a greatly expanded, professionalized white-collar component, and the average railway employee's work is becoming less hands-on and more theoretical. However, owing to the retention of a colonial <b>network,</b> <b>complex</b> timetable and operational environment, real automation of the Sydney rail network and elimination of the traditional signalman role remains impracticable at this juncture. The deregulation and liberalization of the Sydney rail network, which began in the mid 1990s, remains in its preliminary stages. Should the virtual monopoly which CityRail has for passenger services over most of the network be dissolved, the traditional train control system, which evolved under the vertically integrated British railways of the early twentieth century, would probably be dissolved with it. This scenario is becoming increasingly likely, but its impact upon signalling and control remains indeterminate.|$|E

40|$|Bcr-Abl is the {{predominant}} therapeutic target in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), and tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) that inhibit Bcr-Abl {{have been successful}} in treating CML. With progression of CML disease especially in blast crisis stage, cells from CML patients become resistant to imatinib mesylate (IM) and other TKIs, resulting in relapse. Because Bcr-Abl is known to drive multiple signaling pathways, the study of the regulation of stability of Bcr-Abl in IM-resistant CML cells is a critical issue as a possible therapeutic strategy. Here, we report that a new dual-kinase chemical inhibitor, ON 044580, induced apoptosis of Bcr-Abl+ IM-sensitive, IM-resistant cells, including the gatekeeper Bcr-Abl mutant, T 315 I, and also cells from blast crisis patients. In addition, IM-resistant K 562 -R cells, cells from blast crisis CML patients, and all IM-resistant cell lines tested had reduced ability to form colonies in soft agar in the presence of 0. 5 µM ON 044580. In in vitro kinase assays, ON 044580 inhibited the recombinant Jak 2 and Abl kinase activities when the respective Jak 2 and Abl peptides were used as substrates. Incubation of the Bcr-Abl+ cells with ON 044580 rapidly reduced the levels of the Bcr-Abl protein and also reduced the expression of HSP 90 and its client protein levels. Lysates of Bcr-Abl+ cell lines were found to contain a large signaling <b>network</b> <b>complex</b> composed of Bcr-Abl, Jak 2, HSP 90, and its client proteins as detected by a gel filtration column chromatography, which was rapidly disrupted by ON 044580.
