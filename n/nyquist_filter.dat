50|$|In {{order to}} equalise the low {{frequency}} and high frequency {{components of the}} VF signal, a filter named a <b>Nyquist</b> <b>filter</b> is used in receivers. This filter, which is used before demodulation, is actually a low-pass filter with 6 dB suppression at the intermediate frequency (IF) carrier. Thus the level of double sideband portion of the VF signal is suppressed and the original band characteristic is reconstructed at {{the output of the}} demodulator.|$|E
5000|$|... 8VSB is an 8-level vestigial {{sideband}} modulation. In essence, it converts a binary stream into an octal representation by amplitude-shift keying a sinusoidal carrier {{to one of}} eight levels. 8VSB is capable of transmitting three bits (23=8) per symbol; in ATSC, each symbol includes two bits from the MPEG transport stream which are trellis modulated to produce a three-bit figure. The resulting signal is then band-pass filtered with a <b>Nyquist</b> <b>filter</b> to remove redundancies in the side lobes, and then shifted up to the broadcast frequency.|$|E
50|$|A {{significant}} {{advantage of}} 8VSB for broadcasters {{is that it}} requires much less power to cover an area {{comparable to that of}} the earlier NTSC system, and it is reportedly better at this than the most common alternative system, COFDM. Part of the advantage is the lower peak to average power ratio needed compared to COFDM. An 8VSB transmitter needs to have a peak power capability of 6 db (four times) its average power. 8VSB is also more resistant to impulse noise. Some stations can cover the same area while transmitting at an effective radiated power of approximately 25% of analog broadcast power. While NTSC and most other analog television systems also use a vestigial sideband technique, the unwanted sideband is filtered much more effectively in ATSC 8VSB transmissions. 8VSB uses a <b>Nyquist</b> <b>filter</b> to achieve this. Reed-Solomon error correction is the primary system used to retain data integrity.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The use of <b>Nyquist</b> <b>filters</b> in data {{transmission}} systems i important in avoiding intersymbol interference. Moreover, the <b>Nyquist</b> <b>filters</b> should be factorable into Iowpass transmitter/received filter pairs. Here, the design problem is formulated {{so as to}} generate zero-phase FIR lowpass <b>Nyquist</b> <b>filters</b> that can be split into minimum and maximum phase parts. Two factorable minimax design methods are given. These methods use the McClellan-Parks algorithm {{as a first step}} to control the stopband behaviour. The time domain constraints, imposed by solving a linear system of equations, determine the passband response. The final filter exhibits equiripple stopband behaviour. The advantages of these methods are that the minimum and maximum phase parts are obtained without direct factorization and that arbitrary frequency weighting can be easily incorporated toallow for a nonequiripple behaviour. Design examples depict both equiripple and nonequiripple magnitude responses. The new design approach iscompared with other methods in terms of both magnitude and group delay behaviour. Finally, a practical design that conforms to a CCITF voice band modem specification is shown. Zusammenfassung.

For the signal bandwidth exceeding the <b>Nyquist</b> frequency, innumerable <b>filter</b> characteristics should exist [1]. However, {{to the best}} of the present authors' knowledge, there are only two sets of filter frequency responses explicitly defined by their continuous piecewise function definitions [4, 5]. The first one is the well-known raised cosine (RC) filter. In spite of their practical importance there are only few design techniques {{that can be used to}} directly devise a matched combination of digital <b>Nyquist</b> <b>filters.</b> The Matlab software and its Digital Filter Design application [6] provide <b>Nyquist</b> <b>filters</b> based on a truncated version of the (square root) raised cosine filter. Such filters create a single balance between the time- and frequency-domain parameters. Additional weighting window can be used to compromise the out-of-band suppression for the excess bandwidth; however the coefficients of square root filter version cannot be explicitly calculated and for most of the windows, the minimum excess bandwidth is limited by the equivalent noise bandwidth of the window being used [7]. When the same design approach is used to calculate the coefficients of the square root RC filter directly, the residual ISI is increasing rapidly, since the design technique significantly violates the first Nyquist condition. Other techniques for designing the pulse shaping filters that have been reported are based on optimization techniques with a specific objective function such as maximizing the robustness against timing jitter [2, 3, 8 – 10] minimizing the duration of the impulse response [11 – 13] or minimizing the peak to average power ratio (PAPR) at the transmitter filter output [14]. Besides the complex way of calculating the filter coefficients, filters that are obtained by optimization techniques are usually of nonlinear phase [11, 12] or they cannot be directly partitioned into matched filter pairs [2, 3, 8 – 10, 15 – 17] having linear phase characteristic. The same holds true for the IIR <b>Nyquist</b> <b>filters</b> as discussed in [17, 18]. The most recent methods for designing <b>Nyquist</b> <b>filters</b> are based on linear programming technique [8 – 10, 16].

40|$|Abstract Single-carrier (SC) {{transmission}} is a transmission equipped with frequency-domain equalization (FDE) {{is suitable for}} uplink transmission because of its low peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) property. Square-root <b>Nyquist</b> <b>filtering</b> is widely used, where the filter shape {{is controlled by the}} roll-off factor � from 0 to 1. <b>Nyquist</b> <b>filtering</b> with �= 1 occupies twice bandwidth of the original signal. SC signal can be generated by inserting discrete Fourier transform (DFT) block in orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). This realizes an introduction of various frequency-domain signal processing into SC signal transmission. In this paper, we introduce a generalized frequency-domain transmit filtering to SC transmission equipped with FDE (SC-FDE). The transmitted data is initially transformed to the frequency-domain signal and then copied over the available frequency spectrum before applying filtering. Any transfer function can be used and the filtered signal bandwidth can be arbitrary chosen in order to obtain more frequency diversity gain. The transmit filtering with �> 1 is equivalent to spread spectrum technique in the time-domain and frequency-domain. Performance of the proposed generalized filtered SC-FDE is evaluated by computer simulation in aspect of PAPR and bit-error rate (BER), and compared to the time-domain spread spectrum scheme. The advantages and disadvantages of the proposed generalized SC-FDE and the time-domain spread spectrum scheme are also discussed...|$|R
