40|$|Background: Intervention studies {{often use}} unclear {{definitions}} of either morphological or aetiological types of hand eczema, {{or there is}} no classification at all. These studies are not reproducible or difficult to compare. A generally accepted classification system is essential for clinical trials. Only then evidence based advice can be given on the treatment of well defined types of hand eczema. The multifactorial aetiology makes it challenging to classify hand eczema into aetiological types. A clinical description alone seems insufficient. The Danish Contact Dermatitis Group (DCDG) published a classification of hand eczema according to predefined clinical patterns and aetiological diagnosis. Objectives: Tostudy therelationshipbetweencontact sensitization and the different clinical types of hand eczema. Methods: We included 1680 patients with hand eczema, aged= 18 years, which were patch tested from 2002 to 2013 and filed in the ESSCA database of the University Medical Center Groningen. All cases were classified retrospectively into six clinical types according the DCDG: chronic fissured hand eczema, recurrent vesicular hand eczema, hyperkeratotic palmar eczema, pulpitis, interdigital <b>eczema,</b> <b>nummular</b> hand <b>eczema</b> and non-classifiable. Classification was {{based on data from}} medical records and our local ESSCA database. Patch test results were collected from the ESSCA database. The sensitization rate in the different clinical types was determined and the relationship between contact sensitization and the different clinical types was analysed. We investigated whether this relationship was modified by an atopic state. Results: Preliminary data indicate that there is yet no clear association pattern between the clinical type of hand eczema and contact sensitization. Conclusions: Proper application of clinical description of hand eczema is needed to investigate the relationship between clinical types of hand eczema and aetiological factors like contact sensitization and an atopic state...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Allergic contact {{dermatitis}} {{is a well-known}} cause of hand eczema, although the influence of contact allergens on different clinical types of hand eczema remains still unclear. OBJECTIVE: To identify most common positive tested allergens among hand eczema patients and to define the relation between specific contact allergies and clinical types of hand eczema according to the guidelines of the Danish Contact Dermatitis Group (DCDG). METHODS: We included 1571 hand eczema subjects who were patch tested from 1 January 2002 to 31 December 2013. They were retrospectively classified according to the guidelines of the DCDG into six clinical types: recurrent vesicular hand eczema, chronic fissured hand eczema, hyperkeratotic palmar eczema, pulpitis, interdigital <b>eczema</b> and <b>nummular</b> hand <b>eczema</b> according to a newly developed flow chart. The prevalence of sensitizations and association with clinical type, atopic dermatitis, age and gender were studied. RESULTS: A total of 1395 subjects were classified {{into one of the}} six clinical types. The most frequently found clinical types were recurrent vesicular hand eczema (39. 7 %) and chronic fissured hand eczema (35. 5 %). Subjects with recurrent vesicular hand eczema {{were significantly more likely to}} have a contact allergy (OR 1. 55), whereas subjects with hyperkeratotic palmar eczema and pulpitis were less likely to be sensitized (OR 0. 51; OR 0. 44). Overall, metals (nickel sulphate, cobalt chloride), fragrances and preservatives (methylchloroisothiazoline/methylisothiazoline, methyldibromoglutaronitrile) were the most frequent sensitizers in patients with hand eczema. This did not deviate in the different clinical types, although subjects with recurrent vesicular hand eczema were significantly more frequently sensitized to nickel sulphate and other allergens compared to other clinical types of hand eczema. CONCLUSION: In the diagnostic work up of hand eczema subjects with recurrent vesicular hand eczema should be patch tested, especially women of older age, although the need for patch testing in males with hyperkeratotic palmar eczema might be less imperative...|$|R

40|$|Dendritic cells bearing Langerhans cell (OKT 6 +) or interdigitating cell (RFD 1 +) immunophenotype may be {{regularly}} detected {{within the}} dermis of chronic skin diseases {{characterized by a}} lymphohistiocytic (lymphoreticular) infiltrate. These 2 subsets of antigen-presenting cells within the dermis of lesions of exacerbating chronic plaque psoriasis, exacerbating <b>nummular</b> dermatitis (discoid <b>eczema),</b> atopic dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, pityriasis rosea, lichen ruber planus, and cutaneous lupus erythematosus were quantified using computer-assisted morphometry. The mean dendrite length per dermal dendritic cell was significantly higher for RFD 1 than for OKT 6 (74. 4 +/- 0. 98 microns vs 70. 0 +/- 1. 26 microns: p = 0. 0023). The mean dendrite length per dermal dendritic cell was remarkably constant for each marker in the various diagnostic categories studied. Disease-specific patterns of total dendrite length and number (expressed per 100 infiltrating mononuclear cells) of these 2 dendritic cell types within the subepidermal infiltrates were obtained. Pityriasis rosea was characterized by its unique high percentage of OKT 6 + Langerhans cells. Atopic dermatitis and psoriasis had relatively high percentages of both RFD 1 + interdigitating cells and OKT 6 + Langerhans cells. Nummular dermatitis had an intermediate number and total dendrite length for OKT 6, but was relatively low in RFD 1 + cells. Allergic contact dermatitis, lichen planus, and lupus erythematosus had low numbers and dendrite lengths for both dendritic cell subsets. It is suggested that pityriasis rosea is characterized by an abnormal migration pattern of Langerhans cells. Psoriasis and atopic dermatitis may be examples of diseases in which skin-localized antigen-presenting and T-cell-inducing events are continuously taking place.

40|$|Introduction. Lichen spinulosus is a rare, benign {{dermatosis}} representing follicular keratotic disorders. It {{is characterized}} by follicular keratotic papules grouped into large patches. Symmetrical and often asymptomatic lesions affect the limbs, trunk, neck and very rarely the face. The etiopathogenesis of lichen spinulosus is unclear. The disease has been reported predominantly in children in the second decade of life, more frequently in boys. For the treatment keratolytics and emollients are mainly used. Topical corticosteroids, retinoids, tar preparations and vitamin D analogs are also useful. The disease has not been reported in Polish medical literature. Objective. Presentation of child with lichen spinulosus and review of the literature. Case report. An 8 -year-old, generally healthy boy presented {{for a couple of}} years symmetrical, small spinous papules grouped into patches. Lesions affected the knee and shins. Hyperkeratotic lesions on the eyelids and nose were also observed. Histopathology showed dilated hair follicles with keratotic plugs and mild lymphocytic infiltration. According to clinical and histopathological features, the diagnosis of lichen spinulosus was established. The patient was treated with keratolytics and emollients with partial remission. Conclusions. Lichen spinulosus is a rare dermatosis which should be differentiated from other follicular keratotic disorders as well as <b>nummular</b> <b>eczema,</b> lichen planopilaris, frictional childhood eruptions, miliary pustular syphilis and psoriasis...|$|E
40|$|Electron {{microscopy}} {{was used}} to define the ultrastructure of the capillary loops in the dermal papillae of normal, eczematous, and psoriatic skin. Capillary loops were reconstructed from 1 -μm plastic-embedded sections. Ultrathin sections were taken at 4 - to 6 -μm intervals for correlation with the thick sections. The capillary loops of normal forearm and elbow skin could {{be divided into two}} segments: art intrapapillary and extrapapillary portion. The intrapapillary portion had the ultrastructural characteristics of an arterial capillary—homogeneous-appearing basement membrane without bridged fenestrations. The ascending limb in the extrapapillary portion was also an arterial capillary and the descending limb in the same portion had venous characteristics—multilayered basement membrane. The intrapapillary arterial loop developed venous characteristics abruptly after the vessel left the dermal papilla proper. The capillary loops in acute <b>nummular</b> <b>eczema</b> were identical in ultrastructure to those of normal skin. Bridged fenestrations were found in one capillary loop in eczema but not in normal skin. By contrast, the intrapapillary capillary loops in psoriasis were venous capillaries which were characterized by bridged fenestrations and multilayered basement membrane.

Gradual destruction of the nail plates developed and since no regrowth of the nails resumed in six years, the loss of the finger nails is found to be permanent. GIBBS AND LEIDER recently tabulated and illustrated several nail changes due to vari-ous causes. ’Under “eczematous condi-tions, ” the authors state: “Contact dermatitis from primary irritants and from allergic mechanisms, <b>nummular</b> <b>eczema,</b> and sec-ondarily eczematized conditions in, under and around the nails cause transient distor-tion of nail plates. ”This is true, but {{it must be noted that}} occasionally an allergic contact reaction under and around nails produces prolonged distortion of nail plates, 2 - 3 nd on at least one occasion, here reported, caused permanent anonychia.

40|$|Cutaneous T-cell {{lymphoma}} (CTCL) is {{the most}} frequently encountered type of skin lymphoma in humans. CTCL encompasses multiple variants, but the most common types are mycosis fungoides (MF) and Sezary syndrome (SS). While most cases of MF run a mild course {{over a period of}} many years, other subtypes of CTCL are very aggressive. The rapidly expanding fields of proteomics and genomics have not only helped increase knowledge concerning the carcinogenesis and tumor biology of CTCL but also led to the discovery of novel markers for targeted therapy. Although multiple biomarkers linked to CTCL have been known for a relatively long time (e. g., CD 25, CD 45, CD 45 RA, and CD 45 R 0), compared to other cancers (lymphoma, melanoma, colon carcinoma, head and neck cancer, renal cancer, and cutaneous B-cell lymphoma), information about the antigenicity of CTCL remains relatively limited and no dependable protein marker for CTCL has been discovered. Considering the aggressive nature of some types of CTCL, it is necessary to identify circulating molecules that can help in the early diagnosis, differentiation from inflammatory skin diseases (psoriasis, <b>nummular</b> <b>eczema),</b> and aid in predicting the prognosis and evolution of this pathology. This review aims to bring together some of the information concerning protein markers linked to CTCL, in an effort to further the understanding of the convolute processes involved in this complex pathology...|$|E

The condition usually appears appeared on her foot. The patient tried her right shoe on her left foot, {{and after a few}} hours lesions appeared on the foot along with distant lesions on her chest. Patch testing was performed with a standard series and a shoe series, the latter proving positive for 4 -aminoazobenzene; however, there was no cross-reactivity with paraphenylenediamine (Figure 3). The rubber and dyed leather of the shoe were also patch tested and the reaction was positive. The definitive diagnosis was contact dermatitis caused by shoe dye. Since she stopped using the shoes, the patient has not presented further lesions. Therefore, we describe a case of unilateral contact dermatitis caused by footwear. This atypical presentation delayed diagnosis and led us to consider different options, such as factitious dermatitis. Footwear contact dermatitis typically presents bilaterally and commonly affects the dorsa of the feet.
