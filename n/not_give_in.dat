When the British army marched on Pretoria in May 1900, the government was forced to flee the capital. From that moment on, Reitz {{was responsible for the}} continuous relocation of its seat throughout the Transvaal, which occurred sixty-two times until March 1902. In May of that year, Reitz took an active part in the peace negotiations with the British, {{and he was one of}} the signatories of the Treaty of Vereeniging, signed in Pretoria on 31 May 1902.|$|E

Thus Neuchâtel became {{the first and only}} monarchy to join the otherwise entirely republican Swiss cantons. This situation changed in 1848 when a peaceful revolution took place and established a republic, in the same year that the modern Swiss Confederation was transformed into a federation. King Frederick William IV of Prussia did <b>not</b> <b>give</b> <b>in</b> immediately and several attempts at counter-revolution took place, culminating in the Neuchâtel Crisis of 1856–57. In 1857, Frederick William renounced his claims on the area.|$|E
25|$|In July 1711, {{the young}} duchess {{gave birth to}} her first child, an {{stillborn}} girl, at the Palace of Fontainebleau. Her death was blamed on the king who had made her mother travel with the Court to Fontainebleau despite the doctors advising her to stay at Versailles or at the Palais Royal because of her advanced pregnancy. The king did <b>not</b> <b>give</b> <b>in</b> and made Louise Élisabeth travel by barge instead of carriage. During this journey, the barge hit a pier of a bridge at Melun and nearly sank. Louise Élisabeth almost lost her life. According to the doctors, the death of the baby was due to the stress of the journey and the accident. The princess however made a quick recovery.|$|E
25|$|Magnus' rule {{brought about}} a change from the {{somewhat}} aggressive foreign policy of his father. In 1266 he gave up the Hebrides and the Isle of Man to Scotland, {{in return for a}} large sum of silver and a yearly payment, under the Treaty of Perth, by which the Scots at the same time recognised Norwegian rule over Shetland and the Orkney Islands. In 1269 the Treaty of Winchester cemented good relations with the English king HenryIII. Magnus also seems to have had good relations with the Swedish King Valdemar Birgersson, and in the 1260s, the border with Sweden was officially defined for the first time. When Valdemar was deposed by his two brothers and fled to Norway in 1275, this stirred Magnus into gathering a leidang-fleet for the first and only time in his reign. With a large fleet, he met with the new Swedish King Magnus Ladulås to try to bring about a settlement between the two brothers, but without success, Magnus of Sweden would <b>not</b> <b>give</b> <b>in</b> to pressure and the Magnus of Norway retreated without engaging in hostile actions.|$|E

500|$|The South African League, a new uitlander movement, {{prepared}} two petitions, {{each with}} more than 20,000 signatures, that appealed to Queen Victoria for intervention against the Transvaal government, which they called inefficient, corrupt and oppressive. Other uitlanders produced a counter-petition in which about as many affirmed their satisfaction with Kruger's government. Attempting to address the main point of contention raised by Milner and Chamberlain, Kruger spoke of reducing the residency qualification for foreigners to nine years or perhaps less. In May and June 1899 he and Milner met in Bloemfontein, with Steyn taking {{on the role of}} mediator. [...] "You must make concessions on the franchise issue", Steyn counselled. [...] "Franchise after a residence of 14 years is in conflict with the first principles of a republican and democratic government. The Free State expects you to concede... Should you <b>not</b> <b>give</b> <b>in</b> on this issue, you will lose all sympathy and all your friends." [...] Kruger answered that he had already indicated his willingness to lower the franchise and was [...] "prepared to do anything"—"but they must not touch my independence", he said. [...] "They must be reasonable in their demands." ...|$|E
500|$|In any case, {{seeing the}} pillage of their farms, the Athenians were outraged, and they {{soon began to}} {{indirectly}} express their discontent towards their leader, who many of them considered to have drawn them into the war. Even when {{in the face of}} mounting pressure, Pericles did <b>not</b> <b>give</b> <b>in</b> to the demands for immediate action against the enemy or revise his initial strategy. He also avoided convening the ecclesia, fearing that the populace, outraged by the unopposed ravaging of their farms, might rashly decide to challenge the vaunted Spartan army in the field. As meetings of the assembly were called at the discretion of its rotating presidents, the [...] "prytanies", Pericles had no formal control over their scheduling; rather, the respect in which Pericles was held by the prytanies was apparently sufficient to persuade them to do as he wished. While the Spartan army remained in Attica, Pericles sent a fleet of 100 ships to loot the coasts of the Peloponnese and charged the cavalry to guard the ravaged farms close to the walls of the city. When the enemy retired and the pillaging came to an end, Pericles proposed a decree according to which the authorities of the city should put aside 1,000 talents and 100 ships, in case Athens was attacked by naval forces. According to the most stringent provision of the decree, even proposing a different use of the money or ships would entail the penalty of death. During the autumn of 431 BC, Pericles led the Athenian forces that invaded Megara and a few months later (winter of 431–430 BC) he delivered his monumental and emotional Funeral Oration, honoring the Athenians who died for their city.|$|E

[...] Obama said that [...] "the threat from terrorism is real, but we will overcome it" [...] and promised that the United States will [...] "destroy ISIL and any other organization that tries to harm us." [...] Obama also outlined the ongoing fight against ISIL (including U.S. airstrikes, financial sanctions, and targeted special operations) and urged Americans to <b>not</b> <b>give</b> <b>in</b> to fear.

Livingston would <b>not</b> <b>give</b> <b>in,</b> and Cheetham sent him letters explaining his already expansive knowledge of the contents of the letter with Van Ness, threatening [...] "We stand upon the best ground.

2500|$|Lord Russell {{was under}} the {{impression}} that the Cornish had been defeated but news arrived that Arundell's army was re-grouping at Sampford Courtenay. This interrupted his plans to send 1,000 men into Cornwall by ship to cut off his enemy's retreat. Russell's forces were strengthened by the arrival of a force under Provost Marshal Sir Anthony Kingston. His army now numbered more than 8,000, vastly outnumbering what remained of his opposition. Lord Grey and Sir William Herbert led the attack and contemporary Exeter historian John Hooker wrote that 'the Cornish would <b>not</b> <b>give</b> <b>in</b> until most of their number had been slain or captured.' [...] Lord John Russell, reported that his army had killed between five and six hundred and his pursuit of the Cornish retreat killed a further seven hundred.|$|E
2500|$|After his anointing, but {{prior to}} the partaking of Holy Communion, the Tsar recited a {{coronation}} oath, in which he swore to preserve the autocracy intact and to rule his realm with justice and fairness. [...] Russia's last Tsar, Nicholas II, would refer to his coronation oath as one reason he could <b>not</b> <b>give</b> <b>in</b> to demands for a liberal constitution and parliamentary government. The Metropolitan next escorted the Tsar through the Royal Doors (normally permitted only to deacons, priests or bishops) into the altar, where the Tsar partook of the bread and wine separately, in clerical fashion. [...] This {{was the only time}} the Tsar—or any Orthodox layperson—was ever permitted to receive communion in this manner. [...] Unlike the Tsar, the Tsaritsa remained outside the Royal Doors and communicated in standard Orthodox lay fashion, receiving both the bread and the wine together on a spoon.|$|E
2500|$|Regarding the Manchester Arena bombing, Hopkins {{wrote that}} [...] "Britain {{is faced with}} some hard {{questions}} the people charged with protecting {{us are going to}} have to answer sooner or later". [...] Hopkins asserted that the suicide bomber, Salman Abedi, was known to the police, and questioned how he was permitted to re-enter Britain unchallenged after visiting Libya. [...] "Our leaders allow such deeply suspicious characters back into Britain," [...] wrote Hopkins, [...] "and then expect us to swallow their lies that we will <b>not</b> <b>give</b> <b>in</b> to terror?" [...] Hopkins also tweeted about the need for a [...] "final solution", the Nazis' term for the Holocaust, on the morning following the May 2017 Manchester Arena bombing. Although the tweet was soon deleted and reworded as a [...] "true solution", Hopkins claimed the original was only a typographical error (she had also misspelled Manchester). The motive for the attack, and the background of the suicide bomber, was unknown at the time Hopkins made the comment.|$|E

On August 20, 1939, the British chose to turn over the four Chinese fugitives to end the standoff; the Chinese were later executed by the Japanese by public beheadings. The hand-over of the four Chinese to the Japanese sparked much outrage in Britain with MPs being flooded with letter of protests from their constituents, a public relations disaster for the Chamberlain government that the Israeli historian Aron Shai observed would be better remembered today had World War Two not began two weeks later. The Chinese government handed in a note of protest, asking the British to reconsider, saying that the four men were going to be executed by the Japanese, through Chiang was pleased that the British did <b>not</b> <b>give</b> <b>in</b> to the Japanese economic demands.|$|E
2500|$|One of Eliade's {{earliest}} fiction writings, {{the controversial}} first-person narrative Isabel şi apele diavolului, {{focused on the}} figure of a young and brilliant academic, whose self-declared fear is that of [...] "being common". The hero's experience is recorded in [...] "notebooks", which are compiled to form the actual narrative, and which serve to record his unusual, mostly sexual, experiences in British India—the narrator describes himself as dominated by [...] "a devilish indifference" [...] towards [...] "all things having to do with art or metaphysics", focusing instead on eroticism. The guest of a pastor, the scholar ponders sexual adventures with his host's wife, servant girl, and finally with his daughter Isabel. Persuading the pastor's adolescent son to run away from home, becoming the sexual initiator of a twelve-year-old girl and the lover of a much older woman, the character also attempts to seduce Isabel. Although she falls in love, the young woman does <b>not</b> <b>give</b> <b>in</b> to his pressures, but eventually allows herself to be abused and impregnated by another character, letting the object of her affection know that she had thought of him all along.|$|E

He responded to Wallace's enquiry about what Lyell thought of the theory by saying that [...] "I think he is somewhat staggered, but does <b>not</b> <b>give</b> <b>in</b> and speaks with horror [...] what a job it would be for the next edition of [...] "The Principles" [...] if he were [...] "perverted".
