When 5 -aza- 2 '-deoxycytidine (5 -aza-dC) or trichostatin A (TSA) enhanced the development of <b>cloned</b> <b>embryos,</b> the transcripts of DNA methyltransferases (Dnmt 1 and Dnmt 3 a), histone acetyltransferase 1 (Hat 1) and histone deacetylase 1 (Hdac 1) and the methylation and expression patterns of Oct 4 and Thy 1 became similar to those detected in in vitro fertilized counterparts. Further studies showed that Dnmt 1 knockdown in <b>cloned</b> <b>embryos</b> enhanced the methylation reprogramming of Oct 4 and Thy 1 and promoted the activation of Oct 4 and the silence of Thy 1. In conclusion, our results demonstrated that <b>cloned</b> <b>embryos</b> displayed incomplete gene-specific methylation reprogramming and disrupted expression patterns of pluripotency and tissue specific genes, and epigenetic modification agents improved gene-specific methylation reprogramming and expression pattern by regulating epigenetic modification related genes. This work would have important implications in improving cloning efficiency...|$|R
40|$|Epigenetic {{reprogramming}} plays {{a central}} role in the development of <b>cloned</b> <b>embryos</b> generated by somatic cell nuclear transfer, and it is believed that aberrant reprogramming leads to the abnormal development of most <b>cloned</b> <b>embryos.</b> Recent studies show that trimethylation of H 3 K 27 (H 3 K 27 me 3) contributes to the maintenance of embryonic stem cell pluripotency because the differentiation genes are always occupied by nucleosomes trimethylated at H 3 K 27, which represses gene expression. Here, we provide evidence that differential H 3 K 27 me 3 modification exists between normal fertilization-produced blastocysts and somatic cell nuclear transfer cloned blastocysts; H 3 K 27 me 3 was specifically found in cells of the inner cell mass (ICM) of normal blastocysts, whereas there was no modification of H 3 K 27 me 3 in the ICM of cloned blastocysts. Subsequently, we demonstrated that the differentiation-related genes, which are marked by H 3 K 27 me 3 in embryonic stem cells, were expressed at significantly higher levels in <b>cloned</b> <b>embryos</b> than in normal embryos. The polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC 2) component genes (Eed, Ezh 2, and Suz 12), which are responsible for the generation of H 3 K 27 me 3, were expressed at lower levels in the <b>cloned</b> <b>embryos.</b> Our results suggest that reduced expression of PRC 2 component genes in <b>cloned</b> <b>embryos</b> results in defective modification of H 3 K 27 me 3 to the differentiation-related genes in pluripotent ICM cells. This results in premature expression of developmental genes and death of somatic <b>cloned</b> <b>embryos</b> shortly after implantation. Taken together, these studies suggest that H 3 K 27 me 3 might be an important epigenetic marker with which to evaluate the developmental potential of <b>cloned</b> <b>embryos...</b>|$|R

40|$|To clone a pig from somatic cells, {{we first}} {{validated}} an elec-trical activation method {{for use on}} ovulated oocytes. We then evaluated delayed versus simultaneous activation (DA vs. SA) strategies, the use of 2 nuclear donor cells, {{and the use of}} cy-toskeletal inhibitors during nuclear transfer. Using enucleated ovulated oocytes as cytoplasts for fetal fibroblast nuclei and transferring <b>cloned</b> <b>embryos</b> into a recipient within 2 h of acti-vation, a 2 -h delay between electrical fusion and activation yielded blastocysts more reliably and with a higher nuclear count than did SA. Comparable rates of development using DA were obtained following culture of <b>embryos</b> <b>cloned</b> from ovu-lated or in vitro-matured cytoplasts and fibroblast or cumulus nuclei. Treatment of <b>cloned</b> <b>embryos</b> with cytochalasin B (CB) postfusion and for 6 h after DA had no impact on blastocyst development as compared with CB treatment postfusion only. Inclusion of a microtubule inhibitor such as nocodozole with CB before and after DA improved nuclear retention and favored the formation of single pronuclei in experiments using a mem-brane dye to reliably monitor fusion. However, no improvement in blastocyst development was observed. Using fetal fibroblasts as nuclear donor cells, a live cloned piglet was produced in a pregnancy that was maintained by cotransfer of parthenogenetic embryos. developmental biology, early development, embryo, reproductive technolog...|$|R

Unique sets of founder cells generate five territories of gene expression by means of an invariant pattern of complete cleavage. Cell lineage analysis demonstrates that the second embryonic axis, the oral-aboral axis, is specified with reference to the first cleavage plane. In the undisturbed <b>embryo,</b> <b>clones</b> that contribute to one territory or another begin to appear at the third cleavage, and founder cell segregation to all five territories is completed by the sixth cleavage.

This manuscript reviews the impact of reproductive technologies on the underlying components of genetic gain and inbreeding with special reference to the role of female reproductive technology. Evaluation of alternative breeding schemes should be based on genetic gain while constraining inbreeding. Optimum breeding schemes can be characterised by: decreased importance of sib information; increased accuracy at the expense of intensity; and a factorial mating strategy. If large-scale <b>embryo</b> <b>cloning</b> becomes feasible, this will have a small impact on the rate of genetic gain but will have a large impact on the structure of breeding programme...|$|R

40|$|Several {{research}} groups {{have suggested that}} the embryonic-abembryonic (Em-Ab) axis in the mouse can be predicted by the first cleavage plane of the early embryo. Currently, it is not known whether this early patterning occurs in <b>cloned</b> <b>embryos</b> produced by nuclear transfer and whether it affects development to term. In this work, the relationship between the first cleavage plane and the Em-Ab axis was determined by the labeling of one blastomere in <b>cloned</b> mouse <b>embryos</b> at the 2 -cell stage, followed by ex-vivo tracking until the blastocyst stage. The results demonstrate that approximately half of the cloned blastocysts had an Em-Ab axis perpendicular to the initial cleavage plane of the 2 -cell stage. These embryos were classified as "orthogonal" and the remainder as "deviant". Additionally, we report here that <b>cloned</b> <b>embryos</b> were significantly more often orthogonal than their naturally fertilized counterparts and overexpressed Sox 2. Orthogonal <b>cloned</b> <b>embryos</b> demonstrated a higher rate of post-implantation embryonic development than deviant <b>embryos,</b> but <b>cloned</b> pups did not all survive. These results reveal that the angular relationship between the Em-Ab axis and the first cleavage plane can influence later development and they support the hypothesis that proper early patterning of mammalian embryos is required after nuclear transfer...|$|R
40|$|Nuclear {{transfer}} from somatic cells still has limited efficiency {{in terms of}} live calves born due to high fetal loss after transfer. In this study, we addressed the type of donor cells used for clon-ing in in vivo development. We used a combination of repeated ultrasonography and maternal pregnancy serum protein (PSP 60) assays to monitor the evolution of pregnancy after somatic clon-ing in order to detect the occurrence of late-gestation losses and their frequency, compared with <b>embryo</b> <b>cloning</b> or in vitro fer-tilization (IVF). Incidence of loss between Day 90 of gestation and calving was 43. 7 % for adult somatic clones and 33. 3 % for fetal somatic clones, compared with 4. 3 % after <b>embryo</b> <b>cloning</b> and 0 % in the control IVF group. Using PSP 60 levels in maternal blood as a criterion for placental function, we observed that after somatic cloning, recipients that lost their pregnancy before Day 100 showed significantly higher PSP 60 levels by Day 50 than those that maintained pregnancy (7. 77 6 3. 3 ng/ml vs. 2. 45 6 0. 27 ng/ml for normal pregnancies, P, 0. 05). At later stages of gestation, between 4 mo and calving, mean PSP 60 con-centrations were significantly increased in pathologic pregnancy after somatic cloning compared with other groups (P, 0. 05 by Day 150, P, 0. 001 by Day 180, and P, 0. 01 by Day 210). In those situations, and confirmed by ultrasonographic measure-ments, recipients developed severe hydroallantois together with larger placentome size. Our findings suggest that assessing pla-cental development with PSP 60 and ultrasonography will lead to better care of recipient animals in bovine somatic cloning. assisted reproductive technology, conceptus, embryo, placenta, pregnanc...|$|R
