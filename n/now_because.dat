5|$|Before 2000, our factory used {{to produce}} 600 tons of soap annually. Due to the {{physical}} and economic obstacles we face <b>now</b> <b>because</b> of the Israeli occupation – and especially the checkpoints – we produce barely half that amount today.|$|E
5|$|Khal Drogo, delirious from an {{infection}} {{caused by the}} chest wound inflicted by Mago, falls from his saddle, {{a sign of weakness}} among the Dothraki. Daenerys takes Drogo into her tent and sends for Mirri Maz Duur to help him. However, Ser Jorah Mormont advises Daenerys that they should leave <b>now</b> <b>because</b> the Dothraki only respect the physically strong. He explains that, if Drogo dies, Qotho and the other bloodriders will fight amongst themselves to be his successor; whoever wins will kill her and her unborn child to prevent Drogo's son from growing up to be a rival. Daenerys refuses to abandon her husband, even when Mirri tells Daenerys that she cannot save him and instead advises giving Drogo a quick, clean death. In desperation, Daenerys encourages Mirri to use blood magic despite Mirri's warning about the consequences of such a spell, that only death can pay for life. Mirri brings Drogo's horse into the tent, slits its throat, orders everyone to leave, and warns that none must enter during the spell. Qotho, shocked at what Daenerys has done, tries to stop the spell, but Mormont kills him to prevent interference. Daenerys then goes into premature labor, but none of the Dothraki midwives help her, owing to their belief that she is cursed. In desperation, Mormont carries Daenerys into Drogo's tent to seek Mirri's help.|$|E

25|$|This {{used to be}} {{the most}} {{abundant}} large marine mollusk on the west coast of North America, but <b>now,</b> <b>because</b> of overfishing and the Withering Syndrome, it has much declined in population and the IUCN Red List has classed the black abalone as Critically Endangered.|$|E
25|$|In an {{interview}} {{the day after}} the debate, Wurzelbacher said Obama's tax plan wouldn't affect him right <b>now,</b> <b>because</b> he doesn't make $250,000. He also indicated to reporters that he was a conservative, a fan of the military and McCain. He said meeting McCain would be an honor but said he hadn't been contacted by the Republican campaign.|$|E
25|$|The 2003–2004 {{observations}} of methane gas on Mars were made remotely by three teams working with separate data. If the methane is truly {{present in the}} atmosphere of Mars, then something must be producing it on the planet <b>now,</b> <b>because</b> the gas is broken down by radiation on Mars within 300 years, therefore the importance to search for biological potential or habitability of the Martian arctic's soils. Methane could also be {{the product of a}} geochemical process or the result of volcanic or hydrothermal activity.|$|E

25|$|As {{the decisive}} battle approached, {{according}} to Dio, Octavian received intelligence that Antony and Cleopatra planned to break past his naval blockade and escape. At first {{he wished to}} allow the flagships past, arguing that he could overtake them with his lighter vessels and that the other opposing ships would surrender when they saw their leaders' cowardice. Agrippa objected that Antony's ships, although larger, could outrun Octavian's if they hoisted sails, and that Octavian ought to fight <b>now</b> <b>because</b> Antony's fleet had just been struck by storms. Octavian followed his friend's advice.|$|E
25|$|Surplus {{melamine}} {{has been}} an adulterant for feedstock and milk in mainland China for several years <b>now</b> <b>because</b> it can make diluted or poor quality material appear to be higher in protein content by elevating the total nitrogen content detected by some simple protein tests. Actions taken in 2008 by the Government of China have reduced the practice of adulteration, {{with the goal of}} eliminating it. Court trials began in December 2008 for six people linked to the scandal and ended in January 2009 with two of the convicts being sentenced to death and executed.|$|E
25|$|Where {{herbicides}} {{cannot be}} used, mowing may be repeated about every three weeks, as it grows back rapidly. In the past, ragweed was usually cut down, left to dry, and then burned. This method is used less often <b>now,</b> <b>because</b> of the pollution caused by smoke. Manually uprooting ragweed is generally ineffective, and skin contact can cause allergic reaction. If uprooting is {{the method of}} choice, it should be performed before flowering. There is evidence that mechanical and chemical control methods are actually no more effective {{in the long run}} than leaving the weed in place.|$|E

25|$|There {{had been}} a royal mint in Lima briefly, with the king's permission, {{beginning}} in 1565, but it was soon closed. <b>Now</b> <b>because</b> of a shortage of coinage, Enríquez de Guzmán ordered it reopened in December 1658, but without the royal authority to do so. It produced coins of 1/4, 1/2, 1, 2, 4 and 8 reales from January 1659 to April 1660, as well as 1 and 8 escudos from September 1659 to April 1660. These are known today as Estrellas de Lima (Stars of Lima), due to the large star featured in their design. Surviving examples are very rare.|$|E
25|$|The {{fighting}} lasted {{nearly an}} hour. During the foray, Private Tucker attempted {{to rescue the}} captain, but the latter told the former to save himself. Just then, Jones was struck {{in the chest and}} killed. After that, Lujan went to Kirchner and told him that they had unknowingly crossed into Mexico and that they had better leave <b>now</b> <b>because</b> the villagers had sent word to the Mexican Army. Unwilling to leave his captain behind, Kirchner and his men fought it out for the next forty-five minutes before they realized that if the Mexicans were able to flank and surround them then they would all be killed. Accordingly, the Americans fought their way back across the Rio Grande and made it to the small town of Clint, where news of the engagement was relayed to Sheriff Frank B. Simmons in El Paso.|$|E
25|$|Menzies {{heard of}} Chifley's demise while {{attending}} a parliamentary ball at King's Hall in Parliament House {{to celebrate the}} 50th Jubilee of Federation (Chifley was invited but had declined to attend). Menzies was deeply distressed and abandoned his normally impassive demeanour to announce in a halting subdued voice:It is my very sorrowful duty during this celebration tonight {{to tell you that}} Mr Chifley has died. I don't want to try to talk about him <b>now</b> <b>because,</b> although we were political opponents, he was a friend of mine and yours, and a fine Australian. You will all agree that in the circumstances the festivities should end. It doesn't matter about party politics on an occasion such as this. Oddly enough, in Parliament we get on very well. We sometimes find we have the warmest friendships among people whose politics are not ours. Mr Chifley served this country magnificently for years.|$|E

25|$|They used {{spider silk}} fibers {{to create a}} nerve conduit with Schwann cells and acellularized xenogenic veins. The Schwann cells formed columns along the silk fibers in {{a short amount of}} time, and the columns were similar to bands of Bungner that grow in vivo after PNS injury. Spider silk has not been used in tissue {{engineering}} until <b>now</b> <b>because</b> of the predatory nature of spiders and the low yield of silk from individual spiders. It has been discovered that the species Nephila clavipes produces silk that is less immunogenic than silkworm silk; it has a tensile strength of 4 x 109 N/m, which is six times the breaking strength of steel. Because spider silk is proteolytically degraded, there is not a shift in pH from the physiological pH during degradation. Other advantages of spider silk include its resistance to fungal and bacterial decomposition for weeks {{and the fact that it}} does not swell. Also, the silk's structure promotes cell adhesion and migration. However, silk harvest is still a tedious task and the exact composition varies among species and even among individuals of the same species depending on diet and environment. There have been attempts to synthetically manufacture spider silk. Further studies are needed to test the feasibility of using a spider silk nerve conduit in vitro and in vivo.|$|E

500|$|Later law changes, {{under the}} heading of [...] "Intimidatory Short Pitched Bowling", also {{restricted}} the number of [...] "bouncers" [...] which may be bowled in an over. Nevertheless, the tactic of intimidating the batsman is still used to an extent that would have been shocking in 1933, although it is less dangerous <b>now</b> <b>because</b> today's players wear helmets and generally far more protective gear. The West Indies teams of the 1980s, which regularly fielded a bowling attack comprising some of the best fast bowlers in cricket history, were perhaps the most feared exponents.|$|E
500|$|On June 8, 2015, Shumlin {{announced}} that he would not run for a fourth term in 2016.

[...] He said that his decision was [...] "not driven by poll numbers; [...] driven by politics" [...] and that after leaving office in January 2017, he would return to his family business in Putney.|$|E
500|$|During {{the course}} of Gillard's prime ministership, sexism had been a {{contentious}} issue {{for a number of}} Labor and Greens Party figures, as well as some commentators. Former Labor Party advisor Anne Summers said in 2012 that [...] "Gillard is being persecuted both because she is a woman and in ways that would be impossible to apply to a man". In reply, journalist Peter Hartcher wrote, [...] "She was a woman when she was popular; she can't be unpopular <b>now</b> <b>because</b> she's a woman.
