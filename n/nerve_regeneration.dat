25|$|Collagen is {{the major}} {{component}} of the extracellular matrix and has been widely used in <b>nerve</b> <b>regeneration</b> and repair. Due to its smooth microgeometry and permeability, collagen gels are able to allow diffusion of molecules through them. Collagen resorption rates are able {{to be controlled by}} crosslinking collagen with polypoxy compounds. Additionally, collagen type I/III scaffolds have demonstrated good biocompatibility and are able to promote Schwann cell proliferation. However, collagen conduits filled with Schwann cells used to bridge nerve gaps in rats have shown surprisingly unsuccessful <b>nerve</b> <b>regeneration</b> compared to nerve autografts. This is because biocompatibility is not the only factor necessary for successful nerve regeneration; other parameters such as inner diameter, inner microtopography, porosity, wall thickness, and Schwann cell seeding density will need to be examined in future studies in order to improve the results obtained by these collagen I/III gels.|$|E

25|$|Like the chondroitin sulfate {{proteoglycan}}s, keratan sulfate proteoglycan (KSPG) {{production is}} up regulated in reactive astrocytes {{as part of}} glial scar formation. KSPGs have {{also been shown to}} inhibit neurite outgrowth extension, limiting <b>nerve</b> <b>regeneration.</b> Keratan sulfate, also called keratosulfate, is formed from repeating disaccharide galactose units and N-acetylglucosamines. It is also 6-sulfated. This sulfation is crucial to the elongation of the keratan sulfate chain. A study was done using N-acetylglucosamine 6-O-sulfotransferase-1 deficient mice. The wild type mouse showed a significant up regulation of mRNA expressing N-acetylglucosamine 6-O-sulfotransferase-1 at the site of cortical injury. However, in the N-acetylglucosamine 6-O-sulfotransferase-1 deficient mice, the expression of keratan sulfate was significantly decreased when compared to the wild type mice. Similarly, glial scar formation was significantly reduced in the N-acetylglucosamine 6-O-sulfotransferase-1 mice, and as a result, <b>nerve</b> <b>regeneration</b> was less inhibited.|$|E
50|$|Some {{studies have}} {{revealed}} that optic nerve fibers can be regenerated in postnatal rats.

25|$|A nerve {{guidance}} conduit (also {{referred to}} as an artificial nerve conduit or artificial nerve graft, {{as opposed to an}} autograft) is an artificial means of guiding axonal regrowth to facilitate <b>nerve</b> <b>regeneration</b> and is one of several clinical treatments for nerve injuries. When direct suturing of the two stumps of a severed nerve cannot be accomplished without tension, the standard clinical treatment for peripheral nerve injuries is autologous nerve grafting. Due to the limited availability of donor tissue and functional recovery in autologous nerve grafting, neural tissue engineering research has focused on the development of bioartificial nerve guidance conduits as an alternative treatment, especially for large defects. Similar techniques are also being explored for nerve repair in the spinal cord but <b>nerve</b> <b>regeneration</b> in the central nervous system poses a greater challenge because its axons do not regenerate appreciably in their native environment.|$|E
25|$|Because of {{the limited}} {{functionality}} received from autografts, the current gold standard for <b>nerve</b> <b>regeneration</b> and repair, recent neural tissue engineering {{research has focused on}} the development of bioartificial nerve guidance conduits in order to guide axonal regrowth.

The microenvironmental changes around an injuried facial motoneuron, i. e., the aggregation and expression of various types of immune cells and molecules in a dynamic equilibrium, impenetrate from the start {{to the end of the}} repair of an injured facial nerve. The concept of "immune microenvironment for facial nerve repair and regeneration", mainly concerns with the dynamic exchange between expression and regulation networks and a variaty of immune cells and immune molecules in the process of facial <b>nerve</b> repair and <b>regeneration</b> for the maintenance of a immune microenvironment favorable for nerve repair. Investigation on microglial activation and recruitment, T cell behavior, cytokine networks, and immunological cellular and molecular signaling pathways in facial <b>nerve</b> repair and <b>regeneration</b> are the current hot spots in the research on immunobiology of facial nerve injury.

25|$|Spinal {{injuries}} or surgery can cause impairment of motor function, {{which may be}} treated by allowing the dog to exercise in water; it provides support and allows the dog to exercise its muscles while <b>nerve</b> <b>regeneration</b> is taking place.

25|$|In {{experiments}} where nerve {{injury is}} caused but nearby C fibers remain intact, increased spontaneous {{activity in the}} C fibers is observed. This phenomenon supports the theory that damaged nerve fibers may release factors that alter the function of neighboring undamaged fibers. Study of Remak bundles has important implications in <b>nerve</b> <b>regeneration</b> after sustaining injury. Currently, recovery of distal C fiber function takes months and may still only regain incomplete function. This may result in abnormal sensory function or neuropathic pain. Remak bundles are thought to release certain trophic factors that promote the regeneration of the damaged axons.|$|E
25|$|Glial scar {{formation}} is induced following {{damage to the}} nervous system. In the central nervous system, this glial scar formation significantly inhibits <b>nerve</b> <b>regeneration,</b> {{which leads to a}} loss of function. Several families of molecules are released that promote and drive glial scar formation. For instance, transforming growth factors B-1 and -2, interleukins, and cytokines {{play a role in the}} initiation of scar formation. The accumulation of reactive astrocytes at the site of injury and the up regulation of molecules that are inhibitory for neurite outgrowth contribute to the failure of neuroregeneration. The up-regulated molecules alter the composition of the extracellular matrix in a way that has been shown to inhibit neurite outgrowth extension. This scar formation involves several cell types and families of molecules.|$|E

When tested on breast cancer cells, Rhosin inhibited growth and the growth of mammary spheres in a dose dependent manner, functioning as targets for RhoA while simultaneously maintaining the integrity of normal cellular processes and normal breast cells.

40|$|SummaryCompression of the {{peripheral}} nerves (PNs) induces intraneural lesions, which, once surgical decompression has been achieved, requires that {{the peripheral}} scar tissue be as non-adherent as possible. This allows optimal <b>nerve</b> tissue <b>regeneration</b> and the flexibility necessary for longitudinal movements of the PNs. In cases showing a risk for adherence, tissue interposition (with fat, muscle, fascia, etc.) can be proposed.

25|$|A {{synthetic}} polymer may be non-degradable or degradable. For {{the purpose}} of neural tissue engineering degradable materials are preferred whenever possible, because long-term effects such as inflammation and scar could severely damage nerve function. The degradation rate {{is dependent on the}} molecular weight of the polymer, its crystallinity, and the ratio of glycolic acid to lactic acid subunits. Because of a methyl group, lactic acid is more hydrophobic than glycolic acid causing its hydrolysis to be slower. Synthetic polymers have more wieldy mechanical properties and degradation rates that can be controlled over a wide range, and they eliminate the concern for immunogenicity. There are many different synthetic polymers currently being used in neural tissue engineering. However, the drawbacks of many of these polymers include a lack of biocompatibility and bioactivity, which prevents these polymers from promoting cell attachment, proliferation, and differentiation. Synthetic conduits have only been clinically successful for the repair of very short nerve lesion gaps less than 1–2cm. Furthermore, <b>nerve</b> <b>regeneration</b> with these conduits has yet to reach the level of functional recovery seen with nerve autografts.|$|E
25|$|Following {{injury to}} the central nervous system, NG2 expressing {{oligodendrocyte}} precursor cells are seen around the site of injury within 48 hours of the initial injury. The number of NG2 expressing cells continues to increase {{for the next three}} to five days and high levels of NG2 are seen within seven–ten days of the injury. In vitro studies have been done to demonstrate the effect that NG2 levels play on neurite growth inhibition. Notably, neurons would not adhere to substrates made solely of NG2, which hints at its inhibitory effects on <b>nerve</b> <b>regeneration.</b> When grown on substrates containing both NG2 and adhesive molecules, neurite extension was shown to be reduced by 40-45% when compared to neurite extension on substrates only containing the adhesive molecules. Furthermore, cultures were created with striped surfaces that alternated NG2 lanes with lanes only containing adhesive molecules. Neurons and axons placed on these striped regions consistently stayed in the lanes without NG2. It is clear, then, that the accumulation of NG2 expressing cells at the site of injury creates an extracellular barrier that inhibits axon regrowth into the glial scar area.|$|E
25|$|Nervous system {{injuries}} affect over 90,000 {{people every}} year. It {{is estimated that}} spinal cord injuries alone affect 10,000 each year. As {{a result of this}} high incidence of neurological injuries, <b>nerve</b> <b>regeneration</b> and repair, a subfield of neural tissue engineering, is becoming a rapidly growing field dedicated to the discovery of new ways to recover nerve functionality after injury. The nervous system is divided into two parts: the central nervous system, which consists of the brain and spinal cord, and the peripheral nervous system, which consists of cranial and spinal nerves along with their associated ganglia. While the peripheral nervous system has an intrinsic ability for repair and regeneration, the central nervous system is, for the most part, incapable of self-repair and regeneration. There is currently no treatment for recovering human nerve function after injury to the central nervous system. In addition, multiple attempts at nerve re-growth across the PNS-CNS transition have not been successful. There is simply not enough knowledge about regeneration in the central nervous system. In addition, although the peripheral nervous system has the capability for regeneration, much research still {{needs to be done to}} optimize the environment for maximum regrowth potential. Neuroregeneration is important clinically, as it is part of the pathogenesis of many diseases, including multiple sclerosis.|$|E

40|$|The POU domain {{transcription}} factor Oct- 6 {{is a major}} regulator of Schwann cell differentiation and myelination. During <b>nerve</b> development and <b>regeneration,</b> expression of Oct- 6 is {{under the control of}} axonal signals. Identification of the cis-acting elements necessary for Oct- 6 gene regulation is an important step in deciphering the complex signalling between Schwann cells and axons governing myelination. Here we show that a fragment distal to the Oct- 6 gene, containing two DNase I-hypersensitive sites, acts as the Oct- 6 Schwann cell-specific enhancer (SCE). The SCE is sufficient to drive spatially and temporally correct expression, during both normal peripheral <b>nerve</b> development and <b>regeneration.</b> We further demonstrate that a tagged version of Oct- 6, driven by the SCE, rescues the peripheral nerve phenotype of Oct- 6 -deficient mice. Thus, our isolation and characterization of the Oct- 6 SCE provides the first description of a cis-acting genetic element that responds to converging signalling pathways to drive myelination in the peripheral nervous system...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: We {{review the}} {{state-of-the-art}} neurobiology of <b>nerve</b> injury and <b>regeneration,</b> {{especially as it}} relates to return of useful function in patients who have sustained injuries to large nerve trunks such as the brachial plexus. Methods: This review focuses on research conducted in our laboratory at Ochsner and at other laboratories related to the neurobiology of nerve injury with emphasis on how some of the key findings from animal research help us understand the pathophysiology of poor functional recovery after nerve injury. Conclusions: Published research on the neurobiology of <b>nerve</b> injury and <b>regeneration</b> strongly suggests that chronic Schwann cell denervation, chronic neuronal axotomy, and misdirection of regenerating axons into wrong endoneurial tubes are primarily responsible for poor functional recovery. The effect of muscle denervation atrophy is secondary.
