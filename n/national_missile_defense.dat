5|$|Many {{observers}} took {{a moderate}} tone in their reaction, acknowledging that funding {{should be provided}} for further <b>national</b> <b>missile</b> <b>defense</b> tests, but also saying that the US should not rush into developing technology that might prove ineffective and too costly.|$|E
5|$|The {{commission}} is thought by some foreign policy analysts {{to be the}} basis for President George W. Bush's axis of evil line in his 2002 State of the Union Address, in which he accused Iraq, Iran, and North Korea of being state sponsors of terrorism and of pursuing weapons of mass destruction. The Rumsfeld Commission grouped the three countries together because they all were believed to be pursuing ballistic missile programs based on the Scud missile. In the pre-9/11 days of the Bush presidency, the administration had focused heavily on developing a <b>national</b> <b>missile</b> <b>defense</b> system to counter such threats. A month after the address, former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich, who appointed Rumsfeld as head of the commission, mentioned the importance of the commission's findings in relation to the US ability to predict the threat posed by the axis members.|$|E
25|$|As {{a member}} of the Senate Armed Services Committee, he called for early {{implementation}} of President Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative, a <b>national</b> ballistic <b>missile</b> <b>defense</b> system.|$|R
50|$|The U.S. Army {{developed}} it {{and remains}} {{responsible for its}} use by air defense artillery in theater and tactical applications.

25|$|McCain is {{a strong}} {{supporter}} of ballistic <b>national</b> <b>missile</b> <b>defenses.</b> Russia threatened to place short-range nuclear missiles on the Russia’s border with NATO if the United States refuses to abandon plans to deploy 10 interceptor missiles and a radar in Poland and the Czech Republic. In April 2007, Putin warned of a new Cold War if the Americans deployed the shield in the former Eastern Bloc. Putin also said that Russia is prepared to abandon its obligations under a Nuclear Forces Treaty of 1987 with the United States.|$|R

25|$|Whereas {{the current}} United States <b>national</b> <b>missile</b> <b>defense</b> system is {{designed}} around a relatively limited and unsophisticated attack, SDI planned for a massive attack by a sophisticated opponent. This raised significant issues about economic and technical costs associated with defending against anti-ballistic missile defense countermeasures used by the attacking side.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Systems {{analysis}} comprehends {{systems in}} terms of an ontology that relates any system, its elements, and its environment {{in terms of}} their functional, structural, and behavioral relations. At the heart of systems ontology is “design”, the combination of two interactive loops: one loop relating the system to its environment, the other loop relating the system to its parts. For systems analysis, e. g. intelligence analysis of remotely sensed facilities in denied territory, these loops consider structure, function, and process in the context of environment to develop information (what), knowledge (how), and understanding (why) of the system and elements being studied. This exposition presents the interactive loops of design in systems ontology, treating analysis of Soviet <b>national</b> <b>missile</b> <b>defenses</b> as an example of successful application of systems ontology.

50|$|In 2001, the <b>Missile</b> <b>Defense</b> Agency {{assessed}} the programs {{needed for a}} <b>national</b> ballistic <b>missile</b> <b>defense</b> system (BMDS) and found that they were lacking in the relatively new arena of space. The MDA decided to absorb the SBIRS Low constellation in its very early stages of development and renamed the program the Space Tracking and Surveillance System (STSS). This transition changed {{the direction of the}} program somewhat, but the overall mission remained the same—detection and tracking of ballistic missiles through all of its phases of flight.|$|R

He was Los Alamos' representative to the <b>national</b> <b>missile</b> Site <b>Defense</b> Systems Planning Study. He {{served on the}} Los Alamos Weapons Program Review Committee and high-level committees setting the direction of nuclear weapons development (1971-1988). Solem headed the Los Alamos Postdoctoral Research Program (1972-1978) and authored the program's charter, which is still in effect.|$|R
25|$|By 1987, the SDIO had {{developed}} a <b>national</b> <b>missile</b> <b>defense</b> concept called the Strategic Defense System Phase I Architecture. This concept consisted of ground and space based sensors and weapons, {{as well as a}} central battle management system. The ground-based systems operational today trace their roots back to this concept.|$|E
25|$|In 1993, the Clinton {{administration}} further {{shifted the}} focus to ground-based interceptor missiles and theater scale systems, forming the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization (BMDO) and closing the SDIO. The Ballistic Missile Defense Organization was renamed {{again by the}} George W. Bush administration as the Missile Defense Agency and focused onto limited <b>National</b> <b>Missile</b> <b>Defense.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System (Aegis BMD or ABMD) is a United States Department of Defense Missile Defense Agency program {{developed}} to provide missile defense against short to intermediate-range ballistic missiles. It {{is part of}} the United States <b>national</b> <b>missile</b> <b>defense</b> strategy. Aegis BMD (also known as Sea-Based Midcourse) is designed to intercept ballistic missiles post-boost phase and prior to reentry.|$|E
40|$|To deserve serious consideration, a {{strategic}} defense system must pass four tests: (1) {{it must be}} technically feasible. (2) It must preserve the war avoidance stability of mutual deterrence. (3) It cannot be so expensive that an adversary can cheaply overwhelm it. (4) It must be politically feasible. Historically, proposed strategic defenses have failed all four tests. But recent changes could make strategic defense prospectively viable if provided as a global public good. Rather than defense to advance individual <b>national</b> interests, universal <b>missile</b> <b>defense</b> to limit damage globally may pass all four tests. Historically, Mutual Assured Survival has been postulated {{as a substitute for}} MAD deterrence. But a global defensive system would mean we can have both mutual survival and mutual deterrence. <b>Missile</b> <b>defense,</b> BMD, Defense, Security, Conflict, Arms race, Deterrence, Strategy, JEL Codes, D 74, N 4,...|$|R
5000|$|There {{are still}} {{technological}} hurdles to an effective <b>defense</b> against ballistic <b>missile</b> attack. The United States <b>National</b> Ballistic <b>Missile</b> <b>Defense</b> System {{has come under}} scrutiny about its technological feasibility. Intercepting midcourse (rather than launch or reentry stage) ballistic missiles traveling at several miles per second with a [...] "kinetic kill vehicle" [...] has been characterized as trying to hit a bullet with a bullet. Despite this difficulty, {{there have been several}} successful test intercepts and the system was made operational in 2006, while tests and system upgrades continue. Moreover, the warheads or payloads of ballistic missiles can be concealed by a number of different types of decoys. Sensors that track and target warheads aboard the kinetic kill vehicle may have trouble distinguishing the [...] "real" [...] warhead from the decoys, but several tests that have included decoys were successful. Nira Schwartz's and Theodore Postol's criticisms about the technical feasibility of these sensors have led to a continuing investigation of research misconduct and fraud at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimited. The United States is {{embarking on a}} course of designing and fielding a Ballistic <b>Missile</b> <b>Defense</b> System (BMDS) to protect the US and her citizenry against ballistic missile attacks. The BMDS will need a Command and Control, Battle Management, and Communications (C 2 BMC) organization/system to support military and national decision makers in times of crisis. The C 2 BMC must {{also be able to}} react quickly once a missile event has occurred. This thesis will cover the doctrinal issues with merging Theater <b>Missile</b> <b>Defense</b> (TMD) and the <b>National</b> <b>Missile</b> Warning System into one system, how the Unified Command Plan affects <b>missile</b> <b>defense</b> efforts, the lessons learned from Desert Storm, and presents alternative chains of command that might allow the BMDS to engage threat missiles in a timely and efficient manner. Preliminary findings indicate that a 'flattened' chain of command for <b>missile</b> <b>defense</b> forces seems to be a positive starting point for the initial deployment of the BMDS.

25|$|On February 24, 2005, Foreign Affairs Minister Pierre Pettigrew {{told the}} House of Commons that Canada would not {{participate}} in the American <b>National</b> <b>Missile</b> <b>Defense</b> Program, and that he expected to be consulted {{in the case of a}} missile being launched over Canadian air space. Martin's decision came with much praise, but others saw that the government was distancing itself from the U.S. His government continued to cooperate with the United States on border control, refugee claimants, and defense, and he appointed seasoned Liberal politician Frank McKenna as Canada's ambassador to Washington.|$|E
25|$|However, static emplacements remain {{useful in}} both defense against naval attacks and defense against air attacks. Naval mines are still an {{inexpensive}} but {{effective way to}} defend ports and choke off supply lines. Large static air defense systems that combine antiaircraft guns with missile launchers are still {{the best way to}} defend against air attacks. Such systems were used effectively by the North Vietnamese around Hanoi. Also, the United States has invested considerable time and money into the construction of a <b>National</b> <b>Missile</b> <b>Defense</b> system, a static defense grid intended to intercept nuclear intercontinental ballistic missiles.|$|E
25|$|In February 2007, the US started formal {{negotiations}} with Czech Republic and Poland concerning construction of missile shield installations {{in those countries}} for a Ground-Based Midcourse Defense System. Government of the Czech Republic agrees (while 67% Czechs disagree and only about 22% support it) to host a missile defense radar on its territory while a base of missile interceptors {{is supposed to be}} built in Poland. The objective is reportedly to protect another parts of US <b>National</b> <b>Missile</b> <b>Defense</b> from long-range missile strikes from Iran and North Korea, but Czech PM Mirek Topolánek said the main reason is to avoid Russian influence and strengthen ties to US.|$|E

Hagel voted to establish the United States Department of Homeland Security, and supported increasing Defense Department spending, voting in favor of the National Defense Authorization Act every year he served in the Senate.

500|$|The {{argument}} for a <b>national</b> <b>missile</b> <b>defense</b> {{system in the}} United States was traditionally to protect the country from a Soviet missile attack.

50|$|After {{the first}} {{proposal}} {{was shut down}} Wheeler got to work on revising his first attempt and making it better. This second attempt was sent in on January 9, 1958. During {{the early part of}} 1958 the President Eisenhower attempted to make changes in the defense budget allotting more money to the DOD to put toward <b>national</b> security and <b>missile</b> <b>defense.</b> The new budget called for an estimated total of $39.8 billion going toward national defense, an increase of almost $4 million than congress allotted previously for the effort. Wheeler attempted to use this to his advantage, he requested, in his second proposal, that the DOD use that money to model the research and development sector after the Du Pont R&D lab. A version of his proposal made it into the New York Times article written about Eisenhower’s budget change idea, but was eventually denied by President Stern of the IDA. He claimed that {{there was no need for}} so much defense effort during a time of peace.|$|R

500|$|The group {{began work}} in January 1998 and issued their {{unanimous}} final report on July 15, 1998, within the six-month mandate. The report warned {{of a growing}} threat of ballistic missiles and the inability for US intelligence {{to keep track of}} developments. [...] This contrasted with the views of previous US intelligence estimates, which stated that the threat of ballistic missiles was still 10 to 20 years away. The commission further fueled the debate over a <b>national</b> <b>missile</b> <b>defense</b> system, and {{may have contributed to the}} coining of the phrase axis of evil.|$|E
500|$|The second {{review was}} to be {{conducted}} by an outside commission, although it took lawmakers until 1997 to agree upon the commission's membership. [...] The commission eventually began to meet in mid-January 1998 in the Old Executive Office Building and under {{the chairmanship of the}} once and future Secretary of Defense, Donald Rumsfeld. Although the commission was not formed to investigate the feasibility of a <b>national</b> <b>missile</b> <b>defense</b> shield, the reality that their conclusions would influence that debate led many in Washington to doubt that a unanimous conclusion was possible. Rumsfeld still wished to reach a consensus, and instituted a policy whereby any noted objection in the report needed to have the support of at least two commissioners.|$|E
