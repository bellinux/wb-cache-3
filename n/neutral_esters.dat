However, at low substrate concentrations Km values for acetylthiocholine and succinyldithiocholine were 2 - 6 -fold higher for the fluoride- 2 variant. pH rate profiles revealed small differences in pKa that {{could be attributed to}} changes in the active site histidine environment. On the other hand, Arrhenius plot analysis of o-nitrophenylbutyrate hydrolysis at pH 7. 5 showed no difference in activation energy between fluoride- 2 and usual butyrylcholinesterases.

Affinity of the fluoride- 2 variant for sodium fluoride, tacrine, dibucaine, amodiaquin, and succinyldicholine was lower than for usual enzyme. Apparent Ki for succinyldicholine was 125 microM for the fluoride- 2 variant and 20 microM for the usual enzyme.

For {{each of these}} substrates the ratio of Vmax substrate to Vmax benzoylcholine {{was found to be}} similar with atypical and usual cholinesterase sera.

This unique bio-oil fraction was then upgraded with a La-promoted solid acid catalyst. Three washing pretreatments were used to prepare catalysts A, B, and C, {{with the intention of}} reducing the amounts of residual sulfuric acid. Model reactions were used to estimate their catalytic activities and the residual amounts of sulfuric acid. Catalyst B, with washing after calcination, displayed higher catalytic activity (80. 83 %) and lower residual amount of sulfuric acid (50 μmol/g). The catalysts were characterized by techniques such as BET, XRD, and SEM to explain the differences in their catalytic activities. The optimum catalyst B was used in the upgrading of the bio-oil molecular distillation fraction. After upgrading, the corrosivity of the bio-oil fraction declined and its storage stability was improved.

The globuli-filled plastids had a morphology similar to those described in other plant species and tissues. They had an equilibrium density of 1. 02 g/cm 3 and contained <b>neutral</b> <b>esters</b> and unique polypeptides. The lipid particles contained patches of osmiophilic materials situated among densely packed vesicles and did not have an enclosing membrane.

Several of these polypeptides were identified, by their N-terminal sequences or antibody cross-reactivity, as oleosins, proteins known to be associated with seed storage oil bodies. The morphological and biochemical characteristics of the lipid particles indicate that they are novel organelles in eukaryotes that have not been previously isolated and studied. After lysis of the tapetum cells at a late stage of floral development, only the major plastid neutral ester was recovered, whereas the other abundant lipids and proteins of the two tapetum organelles were present in fragmented forms or absent on the pollen surface...|$|E

Immunological studies strongly suggest that hormonesensitive lipase (HSL) is probably responsible for the cholesteryl ester hydrolase activity in macrophages; however, due to the very low level of expression in macrophages, it {{has been difficult to}} determine whether the macrophage cholesteryl ester hydrolase and adipose HSL are, in fact, products of the same gene. We have used the sensitive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique to demonstrate expression of HSL mRNA in resident and thioglycollate-elicited mouse peritoneal macrophages, {{as well as in the}} P 388 D, mouse macrophage cell line. PCR was performed using oligonucleotide primer sequences present on adjacent exons of the mouse HSL gene to allow discrimination between products derived from HSL mRNA or genomic DNA sequences; specificity of the PCR was demonstrated by the absence of a product in liver, which does not express HSL mRNA. Northern blot analysis of poly (A) + RNA from peritoneal macrophages with a mouse adipose HSL cDNA probe demonstrated a low abundance of mRNA of 3. 2 kb, identical in size to HSL mRNA in adipose tissue. a These findings, together with the results of previous studies demonstrating similarities between HSL and macrophage <b>neutral</b> cholesteryl <b>ester</b> hydrolase, strongly support the conclusion that both are products of a single gene.

Even considering that the approach of studying the peptide {{in the presence of a}} co-solvent (TFE/H 2 O, 30 %/ 70 % v/v) has an inherently limited implication, our data strongly support the existence of multiple LA binding sites in the IV/S 4 -S 5 linker, as suggested in the literature. in addition, we consider that LA can bind to the S 4 -S 5 linker with diverse binding modes and strength since this linker is part of the receptor for the inactivation gate particle.

These results suggest the presence of an efficient cholesterol efflux pathway in simultaneous incubation which is not available in sequential incubation. This pathway, which we refer to as the <b>neutral</b> cholesterol <b>ester</b> hydrolase-independent pathway, is characterized by the efflux of lysosome-derived cholesterol without re-esterification...|$|R
40|$|Ultracentrifugal and {{electron}} microscopic {{studies of}} human serum low-density lipoprotein (LDL) {{and several of}} its derivatives led to the formulation of a model in which the 20 protein subunits, probably globular, are arranged in a dodecahedral pattern with icosahedral symmetry. In such a model the LDL surface is occupied by both protein and lipids, predominantly phospholipids, as supported {{by the results of}} the hydrolysis of LDL by phospholipase A and C. <b>Neutral</b> lipids (cholesterol <b>esters</b> and glycerides) would be in the interior of the molecule...|$|R
40|$|<b>Neutral</b> {{cholesterol}} <b>ester</b> hydrolase (NCEH) {{accounts for}} {{a large part of}} the nCEH activity in macrophage foam cells, a hallmark of atherosclerosis, but its subcellular localization and structure-function relationship are unknown. Here, we determined subcellular localization, glycosylation, and nCEH activity of a series of NCEH mutants expressed in macrophages. NCEH is a single-membrane-spanning type II membrane protein comprising three domains: N-terminal, catalytic, and lipid-binding domains. The N-terminal domain serves as a type II signal anchor sequence to recruit NCEH to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) with its catalytic domain within the lumen. All of the putative N-linked glycosylation sites (Asn 270, Asn 367, and Asn 389) of NCEH are glycosylated. Glycosylation at Asn 270, which is located closest to the catalytic serine motif, is important for the enzymatic activity. Cholesterol loading by incubation with acetyl-LDL does not change the ER localization of NCEH. In conclusion, NCEH is targeted to the ER of macrophages, where it hydrolyzes CE to deliver cholesterol for efflux out of the cells...|$|R
