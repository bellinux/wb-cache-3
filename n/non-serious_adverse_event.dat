40|$|ABSTRACT Left atrial {{appendage}} occlusion (LAAO) {{appears as a}} therapeutic option for some atrial fibrillation patients not suitable for oral anticoagulation because an increased hemorrhagic risk or recurrent ischemic events despite anticoagulant treatment. Methods Report of consecutive atrial fibrillation patients treated with LAAO with Amplatzer Cardio Plug because contraindication or failure of oral anticoagulation with acenocumarol. CHA 2 DS 2 VASC, HAS-BLED, NIHSS, mRS, procedural complications and outcome were assessed. Seven patients (73 ± 6 year-old) were treated after intracerebral (n = 5) and gastrointestinal (n = 1) hemorrhages or ischemic stroke recurrence while on acenocumarol (n = 1). Results Mean follow up was 18 months. Baseline CHA 2 DS 2 Vasc y HAS-BLED scores were 5. 6 ± 0. 7 and 4. 1 ± 0. 3 respectively. There were no strokes or deaths. There was only one <b>non-serious</b> <b>adverse</b> <b>event.</b> Conclusion LAAO with ACP appears as a feasible therapeutic option for stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation and failure or contraindication to acenocumarol...|$|E
40|$|The AZURE {{trial is}} an ongoing phase III, academic, multi-centre, {{randomised}} trial designed to evaluate the role of zoledronic acid (ZOL) in the adjuvant therapy of women with stage II/III breast cancer. Here, we report the safety and tolerability profile of ZOL in this setting. Eligible patients received (neo) adjuvant chemotherapy and/or endocrine therapy and were randomised to receive neither additional treatment nor intravenous ZOL 4 mg. ZOL was administered after each chemotherapy cycle to exploit potential sequence-dependent synergy. ZOL was continued for 60 months post-randomisation (six doses in the first 6 months, eight doses in the following 24 months and five doses in the final 30 months). Serious (SAE) and <b>non-serious</b> <b>adverse</b> <b>event</b> (AE) data generated during the first 36 months on study were analysed for the safety population. 3, 360 patients were recruited to the AZURE trial. The safety population comprised 3, 340 patients (ZOL 1, 665; control 1, 675). The addition of ZOL to standard treatment did not significantly impact on chemotherapy delivery. SAE were similar in both treatment arms. No significant safety differences were seen apart from the occurrence of osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) in the ZOL group (11 confirmed cases; 0. 7 %; 95 % confidence interval 0. 3 - 1. 1 %). ZOL in the adjuvant setting is well tolerated, and can be safely administered in addition to adjuvant therapy including chemotherapy.

40|$|Background: Pregnant {{women are}} at {{increased}} risk of morbidity and mortality due to serious influenza related complications. Antenatal vaccinations with seasonal trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV) can reduce morbidity among pregnant women, and the available data suggest a protective effect among infants born to vaccinated mothers. For these reasons, in 2012, the World Health Organisation’s Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization stated that pregnant women are the highest priority for seasonal influenza vaccination. Influenza vaccination coverage rates among pregnant women remain low in a number of countries. One of the reasons for this low coverage may be related to pregnant women’s perceptions of influenza vaccination. Although the safety of influenza vaccination administration during pregnancy has been well established, half of antenatal patients who refuse vaccination cite safety concerns as their primary reason. Ongoing and timely safety surveillance could help reassure pregnant women and promote vaccine uptake. In 2013, the Western Australia Department of Health modified its TIV safety monitoring system FASTMum (Follow-up and Active Surveillance of TIV in Mums) to collect information regarding the safety of TIV in pregnant women using SMS technology. Materials and Methods: In Western Australia, seasonal antenatal influenza vaccinations are reported to the Western Australia Department of Health by vaccination providers. In 2013, SMS technology was introduced as a semi-automated, rapid method to capture adverse events following immunization in a timely manner. Of the 2203 antenatal vaccination reports received between 01 March and 15 May 2013, 1852 (84. 1 %) of these women consented to SMS follow-up and provided a mobile telephone number. One week post vaccination, the Western Australia Department of Health sent a SMS message to these women asking if they had experienced any reactions following the 2013 TIV. Women who responded “yes” to this message were followed-up with a telephone questionnaire. Results: On average, complete information regarding adverse events following TIV was obtained within one month (28 days) of vaccine administration. Of the 1425 women who responded to SMS in the first two months of influenza season, one in ten (10. 8 %) pregnant women reported a <b>non-serious</b> <b>adverse</b> <b>event</b> one week following receipt of the 2013 TIV. Of these women, 52 (3. 6 %) reported a local reaction at the site of injection, 29 (2. 0 %) reported fatigue, 28 (2. 0 %) reported fever, 27 (1. 9 %) reported respiratory symptoms (eg, coughing, congestion, sneezing), and 24 (1. 7 %) reported headache. Of the 427 women who did not respond to SMS, 333 (88. 0 %) were followed-up with a telephone interview. With the exception of injection-site reaction, the rate of adverse events was consistent with that of women who responded to SMS. No serious reactions related to the influenza vaccine were identified. Conclusions: The results from FASTMum 2013 are promising and provide timely evidence of 2013 TIV safety in pregnant women in the early months of influenza vaccination season in the southern hemisphere. These results demonstrate the feasibility of using mobile phone technology to monitor vaccine safety in near real-time. Information resulting from this surveillance effort is important for addressing lingering concerns among providers and antenatal patients about the safety of influenza vaccine for pregnant women...|$|E

The safety of cannabis use for medical purposes has not been systematically evaluated. We conducted a prospective cohort study to describe safety issues among individuals with chronic non-cancer pain. A standardized herbal cannabis product (12. 5 % tetrahydrocannabinol) was dispensed to eligible individuals for a 1 -year period; controls were individuals with chronic pain from the same clinics who were not cannabis users. The primary outcome consisted of serious <b>adverse</b> <b>events</b> and <b>non-serious</b> <b>adverse</b> <b>events.</b> Secondary safety outcomes included pulmonary and neurocognitive function and standard hematology, biochemistry, renal, liver, and endocrine function. Secondary efficacy parameters included pain and other symptoms, mood, and quality of life. Two hundred and fifteen individuals with chronic pain were recruited to the cannabis group (141 current users and 58 ex-users) and 216 controls (chronic pain but no current cannabis use) from 7 clinics across Canada. The median daily cannabis dose was 2. 5  g/d. There was no difference in risk of serious <b>adverse</b> <b>events</b> (adjusted incidence rate ratio =  1. 08, 95 % confidence interval = . 57 – 2. 04) between groups. Medical cannabis users were at increased risk of <b>non-serious</b> <b>adverse</b> <b>events</b> (adjusted incidence rate ratio =  1. 73, 95 % confidence interval =  1. 41 – 2. 13); most were mild to moderate. There were no differences in secondary safety assessments. Quality-controlled herbal cannabis, when used by patients with experience of cannabis use as part of a monitored treatment program over 1 year, appears to have a reasonable safety profile. Longer-term monitoring for functional outcomes is needed. Study registrationThe study was registered with www. controlled-trials. com (ISRCTN 19449752).

40|$|The use of {{stand-by}} {{treatment for}} malaria by travellers {{depends on their}} knowledge, attitudes and behaviour. We examined the behavioural aspects of a cohort of travellers from Switzerland to low-risk malarial areas who, on recruitment, were provided with a kit containing medication for stand-by treatment, guidelines on the diagnosis of malaria, and materials for collection of blood samples for later confirmation of malaria. All subjects were urged to seek medical advice at {{the first signs of}} possible malarial symptoms. Illness (fever as the main indicator) was reported by 123 of the 1187 participants, often accompanied by shivering/chills (36. 6 %), headache (35. 0 %), gastrointestinal symptoms (69. 9 %), and myalgia and/or arthralgia (41. 5 %). Two-thirds of those ill failed to seek medical attention despite their symptoms and pretravel advice. Only 9 (7. 3 %) were actually beyond the reach of medical attention. The stand-by treatment was self-administered by 6 travellers, only one of whom had confirmed malaria. Two <b>non-serious</b> <b>adverse</b> <b>events</b> were reported. All users consulted a physician after administering the presumptive treatment. This stand-by approach is limited by inappropriate behaviour and poor malaria awareness among travellers. These negative factors can be mitigated by development of an improved kit containing a simple test for self-diagnosis...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: We {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the safety, tolerability, and systemic diffusion of a single escalating dose of XG- 102 (a 31 -D-amino-acid peptide inhibiting JNK pathway activation), administered subconjunctivally {{in the treatment of}} post-surgery or post-trauma intraocular inflammation. METHODS: This is a dose-escalating, tolerance Phase Ib study. Twenty patients with post-surgery or post-traumatic intraocular inflammation were assigned to 1 of the 4 dose escalating (45, 90, 450, or 900 μg XG- 102) groups of 5 patients each. Patients were evaluated at 24, 48 h, 8, and 28 days following the administration of XG- 102, including laboratory tests, standard eye examinations, vital signs, and occurrence of <b>adverse</b> <b>events.</b> A single plasma quantification of XG- 102 was performed 30 min after administration, according to previous pharmacokinetics studies performed on volunteers. RESULTS: A total of 17 <b>non-serious</b> <b>adverse</b> <b>events,</b> considered unrelated to the study treatment, were reported for 10 patients. The <b>adverse</b> <b>event</b> incidence was not related to the drug dose. All patients experienced a decrease in intraocular inflammation as of 24 h post-administration and this decrease was sustained up to 28 days thereafter. No patient required local injection or systemic administration of corticoids following the administration of XG- 102. XG- 102 was undetectable in the first 3 dose groups. In the fourth-dose group (900 μg) the XG- 102 plasma levels were above the limit of detection for 3 patients and above the limit of quantification for 1 patient. CONCLUSIONS: In this first clinical trial using XG- 102, administered as a single subconjunctival injection as adjunct therapy, in patients with recent post-surgery or post-trauma intraocular inflammation is safe and well tolerated. Further studies are required to evaluate its efficacy...|$|R
40|$|Goals of the work: This open compassionate-use {{prospective}} registration study {{evaluated the}} tolerability, {{ease of use}} and applied doses of transdermal (TTS) fentanyl in adult patients with cancer-related pain requiring strong opioid analgesia. Elderly patients were particularly focussed on. Patients and methods: Previous pain medication was converted to an appropriate dose of TTS-fentanyl. I m mediate-release morphine rescue medication was allowed as needed for breakthrough pain. Dose adjustments of ITS-fentanyl, rescue morphine requirements, the ease of use and side-effects were assessed monthly, with special emphasis paid to the severity of constipation {{and the use of}} laxatives. Main results: A total of 663 patients with cancer-related pain, including 8 % opioid-naive patients, were enrolled; 661 patients used at least 1 patch of TTS-fentanyl. Of these, 455 subjects were assessed at baseline and at 1 post-baseline visit at least. Individual treatment ranged from a few days to 21 / 2 years; TTS-fentanyl doses ranged from 25 to. 950 mug/h. The major reason for study termination was non-drug-related death (61 %). Approximately 40 % of patients reported constipation. The frequency of constipation depended on the rescue morphine dose used, but no dose-relationship was found for TTS-fentanyl. Patient acceptance of the patches was high; around 85 % of patents rated convenience as good to excellent. The ease of use and tolerability of TTS-fentanyl in the elderly patents were comparable to that in the total population, except for a slight increase of <b>non-serious</b> <b>adverse</b> <b>events.</b> Conclusions: TTS-fentanyl can be applied as long-term therapy to patients with cancer-related pain, including the elderly...|$|R
40|$|Standard {{treatment}} for Glanzmann thrombasthenia is platelet transfusion. Recombinant activated factor VII {{has been shown}} to be successful in patients with Glanzmann thrombasthenia with platelet antibodies or who are refractory to platelet transfusions. The Glanzmann Thrombasthenia Registry prospectively collected worldwide information on the effectiveness and safety of platelet transfusion, recombinant activated factor VII and/or antifibrinolytics for the treatment of bleeds in patients with Glanzmann thrombasthenia. Data relating to 829 non-surgical bleeding episodes were entered into the Glanzmann Thrombasthenia Registry (severe/moderate: 216 / 613; spontaneous/post-traumatic: 630 / 199). Recombinant activated factor VII alone was used in 124 / 829 bleeds, recombinant activated factor VII+antifibrinolytics in 107 / 829, platelets±antifibrinolytics in 312 / 829, antifibrinolytics alone in 219 / 829, and recombinant activated factor VII+platelets±antifibrinolytics in 67 / 829. The proportion of successful treatments to stop bleeding was 91. 0 % in cases treated with recombinant activated factor VII only, 82. 7 % for recombinant activated factor VII+antifibrinolytics, 72. 7 % for treatment with recombinant activated factor VII+platelets±antifibrinolytics, 78. 8 % for platelets±antifibrinolytics and 84. 7 % for antifibrinolytics alone. Treatment failure was documented in 18 bleeding events (2 % of the total treatments), the majority of which were in patients receiving treatment with antifibrinolytics; bleeding re-started in 6 % of bleeds after initial effective treatment. Thirty-five <b>adverse</b> <b>events</b> were reported, none of which was a thromboembolic event. Among treatments that included recombinant activated factor VII, only one patient reported three possibly drug-related <b>non-serious</b> <b>adverse</b> <b>events</b> (nausea, dyspnea and headache). To conclude, non-surgical bleeds were common and often severe in Glanzmann thrombasthenia; both platelets and recombinant activated factor VII appeared to be effective, and with good safety profiles, for the treatment of non-surgical bleeds.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Recent {{data suggest}} that Clostridium difficile-associated {{diarrhea}} is becoming more severe and difficult to treat. Antibody responses to C. difficile toxin A are protective against symptomatic disease and recurrence. We examined the safety and pharmacokinetics (pk) of a novel neutralizing human monoclonal antibody against C. difficile toxin A (CDA 1) in healthy adults. METHODS: Five cohorts with 6 subjects each received a single intravenous infusion of CDA 1 at escalating doses of 0. 3, 1, 5, 10, and 20 mg/kg. Safety evaluations took place on days 1, 2, 3, 7, 14, 28, and 56 post-infusion. Samples for pk analysis were obtained before and after infusion, and at each safety evaluation. Serum CDA 1 antibody concentrations and human anti-human antibody (HAHA) titers were measured with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. A noncompartmental model was used for pk analysis. RESULTS: Thirty subjects were enrolled. The median age was 27. 5 yrs. There were no serious <b>adverse</b> <b>events</b> (AE) related to CDA 1. Twenty-one of the 48 reported <b>non-serious</b> <b>adverse</b> <b>events</b> were possibly related to CDA 1, and included transient blood pressure changes requiring no treatment, nasal congestion, headache, abdominal cramps, nausea, and self-limited diarrhea. Serum CDA 1 concentrations increased with escalating doses: mean C(max) ranged from 6. 82 microg/ml for the 0. 3 mg/kg cohort to 511 microg/ml for the 20 mg/kg cohort. The geometric mean values of the half-life of CDA 1 ranged between 25. 3 and 31. 8 days, and the volume of distribution approximated serum. No subject formed detectable HAHA titers. CONCLUSION: Administration of CDA 1 as a single intravenous infusion was safe and well tolerated. C(max) increased proportionally with increasing doses. A randomized study of CDA 1 in patients with C. difficile associated diarrhea is underway...|$|R
40|$|AbstractUntil 2004, {{docetaxel}} in monotherapy was {{the standard}} for second-line treatment of {{non-small cell lung cancer}} (NSCLC). Pemetrexed (P) has shown similar activity in this setting with a better <b>adverse</b> <b>event</b> profile. In Portugal, it was introduced in October of 2004. We have carried out a retrospective analysis of patients (pts) who received P for second-line NSCLC in Portugal from October 2004 to December 2006. Data were collected from the records of pts with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC and failed first-line chemotherapy enrolled in centers participating in the Portuguese Lung Cancer Study Group (GECP). Objective response (OR; complete [CR] or partial [PR] response) was evaluated using RECIST and safety was assessed using serious or <b>non-serious</b> <b>adverse</b> <b>events</b> (SAEs/AEs). By December 2006, 19 GECP centers had enrolled 244 pts who had received P for ≥ 1 cycle, and were considered evaluable for both objective response and safety. Demography: male/female, 175 / 69; median age, 57. 0 years (range 20 - 81); smoking status, y/ex/n, 116 / 57 / 71; adenocarcinoma / squamous-cell carcinoma/other histology, 141 / 72 / 31; mean time to progression (TTP) 8. 07 months. Disease control in 209 evaluable pts was observed in 116 (55. 5 %) : 2 CR, 45 PR and 69 SD; mean TTP 4. 70 months. The majority of AEs were grade 3 anemia (15 pts) and neutropenia (18 pts). The mean overall survival was 17. 27 months. Our retrospective analysis has observed a similar disease control rate with P in 2 nd line (55. 5 %), and TTP (4. 7 months) in our current unselected population to that published in the literature. P is an option for second-line NSCLC with a good tolerability. Rev Port Pneumol 2008; XIV (Sup. 2) : S 9 -S 2...|$|R

We aimed at describing the maximal benefits and risks associated with SGLT 2 -i for patients with type 2 diabetes. Design Systematic review and meta-analysis. Data Sources and Study Selection We included double-blinded, randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating SGLT 2 -i administered in the highest approved therapeutic doses (canagliflozin 300 mg/day, dapagliflozin 10 mg/day, and empagliflozin 25 mg/day) for ≥ 12 weeks. Comparison groups could receive placebo or oral antidiabetic drugs (OAD) including metformin, sulphonylureas (SU), or dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors (DPP- 4 -i). Trials were identified through electronic databases and extensive manual searches. Primary outcomes were glycated haemoglobin A 1 c (HbA 1 c) levels, serious <b>adverse</b> <b>events,</b> death, severe hypoglycaemia, ketoacidosis and CVD.

Results Meta-analysis of 34 RCTs with 9, 154 patients showed that SGLT 2 -i reduced HbA 1 c compared with placebo (mean difference - 0. 69 %, 95 % confidence interval - 0. 75 to - 0. 62 %). We downgraded the evidence to ‘low quality’ due to variability and evidence of publication bias (P = 0. 015). Canagliflozin was associated with the largest reduction in HbA 1 c (- 0. 85 %, - 0. 99 % to - 0. 71 %).

This large multinational open-label study aimed to better define the incidence of serious <b>adverse</b> <b>events</b> (SAEs) and <b>non-serious</b> <b>adverse</b> <b>events</b> of special interest in patients receiving peginterferon alfa- 2 a/ribavirin. METHODS: Patients were assigned at the investigator's discretion to 24 - or 48 -week treatment with peginterferon alfa- 2 a 180  μg/week and ribavirin 800  mg/day or 1000 / 1200  mg/day. All AEs, defined as SAEs and non-SAEs of special interest, were recorded during treatment and for 12  weeks thereafter. Non-SAEs of special interest included those leading to dose reduction/discontinuation, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, anaemia, ALT elevations leading to dose modification and unknown/unexpected AEs. RESULTS: Of 1675 and 7178 patients assigned to 24 and 48  weeks of treatment, respectively, 87. 6 and 68. 3 % completed therapy, whereas 6. 4 and 10. 3 % prematurely stopped peginterferon alfa- 2 a treatment because of AEs. Among patients assigned to 24 and 48  weeks, 37. 4 and 46. 9 %, respectively, reported any AE (SAE or non-SAE of special interest); 4. 2 and 6. 6 % reported SAEs and 35. 2 and 44. 0 % reported non-SAEs of special interest. Female gender, increasing age and cirrhosis were significantly associated with dose reductions of either drug. Increasing age (and female gender in the case of ribavirin) was significantly associated with treatment discontinuation. CONCLUSION: This study confirmed the safety and tolerability profile of peginterferon alfa- 2 a/ribavirin and identified patient subgroups at higher risk of dose reductions and discontinuations, thus allowing optimum management of AEs.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{prevalence}} of knee osteoarthritis (OA) /degenerative joint disease (DJD) is increasing in the USA. Systematic reviews of treatment efficacy and <b>adverse</b> <b>events</b> (AEs) of hyaluronic acid (HA) injections report conflicting {{evidence about the}} balance of benefits and harms. We review evidence on efficacy and AEs of intraarticular viscosupplementation with HA in older individuals with knee osteoarthritis and account for differences in these conclusions from another systematic review. Methods We searched PubMed and eight other databases and gray literature sources from 1990 to December 12, 2014. Double-blind placebo-controlled randomized controlled trials (RCTs) reporting functional outcomes or quality-of-life; RCTs and observational studies on delay/avoidance of arthroplasty; RCTs, case reports, and large cohort studies and case series assessing safety; and systematic reviews reporting on knee pain were considered for inclusion. A standardized, pre-defined protocol was applied by two independent reviewers to screen titles and abstracts, review full text, and extract details on study design, interventions, outcomes, and quality. We compared our results with those of a prior systematic review and {{found them to be}} discrepant; our analysis of why this discrepancy occurred is the focus of this manuscript. Results Eighteen RCTs reported functional outcomes: pooled analysis of ten placebo-controlled, blinded trials showed a standardized mean difference of − 0. 23 (95 % confidence interval (CI) − 0. 45 to − 0. 01) favoring HA at 6  months. Studies reported few serious <b>adverse</b> <b>events</b> (SAEs) and no significant differences in <b>non-serious</b> <b>adverse</b> <b>events</b> (NSAEs) (relative risk (RR) [95 % CI] 1. 03 [0. 93 – 1. 15] or SAEs (RR [95 % CI] 1. 39 [0. 78 – 2. 47]). A recent prior systematic review reported similar functional outcomes, but significant SAE risk. Differences in SAE inclusion and synthesis accounted for the disparate conclusions. Conclusions Trials show a small but significant effect of HA on function on which recent systematic reviews agree, but lack of AE synthesis standardization leads to opposite conclusions about the balance of benefits and harms. A limitation of the re-analysis of the prior systematic review is that it required imputation of missing data...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background For high-risk {{individuals}} and their healthcare providers, finding the right balance between promoting physical activity and minimizing the risk of <b>adverse</b> <b>events</b> can be difficult. More information on the prevalence and influence of <b>adverse</b> <b>events</b> is needed to improve providers' ability to prescribe effective and safe exercise programs for their patients. Methods This study describes the type and severity of <b>adverse</b> <b>events</b> reported by participants with cardiovascular disease or at-risk for cardiovascular disease that occurred during an unsupervised, home-based walking study. This multi-site, randomized controlled trial tested the feasibility of a diet and lifestyle activity intervention over 1. 5 years. At month 13, 274 eligible participants (male veterans) were recruited who were ambulatory, BMI > 28, and reporting one or more cardiovascular disease risk factors. All participants attended five, face-to-face dietitian-delivered counseling sessions during the six-month intervention. Participants were randomized to three study arms: 1) time-based walking goals, 2) simple pedometer-based walking goals, and 3) enhanced pedometer-based walking goals with Internet-mediated feedback. Two physicians verified <b>adverse</b> <b>event</b> symptom coding. Results Enrolled participants {{had an average of}} five medical comorbidities. During 1110 person months of observation, 87 of 274 participants reported 121 <b>adverse</b> <b>events.</b> One serious study-related <b>adverse</b> <b>event</b> (atrial fibrillation) was reported; the individual resumed study participation within three days. <b>Non-serious,</b> study related <b>adverse</b> <b>events</b> made up 12 % of all symptoms – predominantly minor musculoskeletal events. Serious, non-study related <b>adverse</b> <b>events</b> represented 32 % of all symptoms while <b>non-serious,</b> non-study related <b>adverse</b> <b>events</b> made up 56 % of symptoms. Cardiovascular disease events represented over half of the non-study related <b>adverse</b> <b>event</b> symptoms followed by musculoskeletal complaints. <b>Adverse</b> <b>events</b> caused 50 temporary suspensions averaging 26 days in duration before physician medical clearance was obtained to resume walking. Conclusion Men at high risk for <b>adverse</b> cardiovascular <b>events</b> can safely be advised to start a progressive walking program. Results suggest that minor to serious medical problems unrelated to exercise are a major barrier to walking adherence. Helping individuals with chronic illness return to physical activity quickly but safely after an <b>adverse</b> <b>event</b> is an important component of any physical activity intervention targeting this population. </p...|$|R
