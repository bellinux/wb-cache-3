The so-called dither noise is summed into the lower W+1 bits of the PA output word to linearize the truncation operation. Often the improvement can be achieved without penalty because the DAC <b>noise</b> <b>floor</b> tends to dominate system performance. Amplitude truncation spurs can not be mitigated in this fashion. Introduction of noise into the static values held in the PAC ROMs would not eliminate the cyclicality of the truncation error terms and thus would not achieve the desired effect.|$|E

30|$|An {{idea of how}} a nonnegligible {{adaptive}} {{quantization error}} would affect {{the results can be}} gained by studying the performance differences between different <b>noise</b> <b>floors.</b> The higher <b>noise</b> <b>floors</b> lead to less accurate predictions, and quantization errors would amplify this effect. However, with a fixed quantization granularity, the size of the quantization error would be independent of the channel prediction quality. Then, in the presence of nonnegligible quantization errors, other effects might occur, which are not present in the results presented her. This is a topic of importance, which will be left for future studies.|$|R

Variations of non-linear spectral subtraction (NLSS) are assessed in terms of ASR relevant spectral matching {{in an attempt to}} find optimum conditions invariant across typical car noises. Lockwood [1, 2] reports the benefits of an SNR-dependent scaler in subtracting over-estimates of the noise spectrum.

40|$|Abstract. Since {{recently}} {{almost all}} housing built in Korean have shared walls and floor, diverse problems are unavoidable including <b>noise</b> between <b>floor</b> arising from <b>noise</b> and vibration. Many {{efforts have been}} made by the Korean government, but the number of complaints related with the <b>noise</b> between <b>floors</b> has been gradually increasing. Therefore, through the field measurements by house type, the current state of noise was understood. To do this, the <b>noise</b> between <b>floors</b> was measured in an apartment household and a multiplex house to perform a comparative analysis. As the result, the differences in the noise between the two house types were clarified. The findings of this research are expected to contribute to reduction of the <b>noise</b> between <b>floors</b> in an apartment building in the future...|$|R

25|$|In general, analog {{computers}} {{are limited by}} non-ideal effects. An analog signal is composed of four basic components: DC and AC magnitudes, frequency, and phase. The real limits of range on these characteristics limit analog computers. Some of these limits include the operational amplifier offset, finite gain, and frequency response, <b>noise</b> <b>floor,</b> non-linearities, temperature coefficient, and parasitic effects within semiconductor devices. For commercially available electronic components, ranges of these aspects of input and output signals are always figures of merit.|$|E

To implement an active system, low-noise fluxgate magnetometers are mounted {{at the center of}} each surface and oriented orthogonally to it. This negatively feeds a DC amplifier through a low-pass network with a slow falloff to minimize positive feedback and oscillation. Built into the system are shaking and degaussing wires. Shaking wires increase the magnetic permeability, while the permanent degaussing wires are applied to all surfaces of the inner main layer to degauss the surfaces. Moreover, noise cancellation algorithms can reduce both low-frequency and high-frequency noise. Modern systems have a <b>noise</b> <b>floor</b> of around 2–3fT/Hz0.5 above 1Hz.|$|E

25|$|Stating the {{efficiency}} of wind noise reduction is an inexact science, since the effect varies enormously with frequency, and hence with the bandwidth of the microphone and audio channel. At very low frequencies (10–100Hz) where massive wind energy exists, reductions are important to avoid overloading of the audio chain – particularly the early stages. This can produce the typical “wumping” sound associated with wind, which is often syllabic muting of the audio due to LF peak limiting. At higher frequencies – 200Hz to ~3kHz – the aural sensitivity curve allows us to hear the effect of wind as an addition to the normal <b>noise</b> <b>floor,</b> {{even though it has}} a far lower energy content. Simple shields may allow the wind noise to be 10dB less apparent; better ones can achieve nearer to a 50dB reduction. However the acoustic transparency, particularly at HF, should also be indicated, since a very high level of wind attenuation could be associated with very muffled audio.|$|E
25|$|New spotter {{technologies}} and training techniques have been developing since the 1960s. Prior to the 1960s, {{the vast majority}} of amateur radio communication relied on AM-modulated signals and the use of simplex. It was not uncommon for spotters to hear the distant net control station and not hear other mobile or base stations which were much closer. After 1960, amateurs adopted the use of FM repeaters which operated in the VHF spectrum. The use of FM repeaters was a huge advancement for storm spotters; spotters could now hear each other regularly. The low <b>noise</b> <b>floor</b> and greatly improved audio quality meant much better signal reception for all stations. By the 1970s, nearly all spotter radio activity consisted of half-duplex FM repeater use. The next major technology to aid spotters was the development of the cell phone in the late 1970s and early 1980s. It was then possible for non-amateur radio operators to directly report severe weather.|$|E

40|$|The {{principal}} suppressor {{parameters and}} their relationships {{have been used}} to formulate a suppressor design methodology which has been applied to the design of several full-scale suppressors.

The amount of suppression in several instances seems to have been limited by reaching <b>noise</b> <b>floors</b> that are not clearly at the estimated jet noise level but are not far above it. In addition to identifying <b>noise</b> <b>floors,</b> two other areas are considered.

500|$|The latest {{generation}} Planar 3, released in 2016, is a wholesale improvement on the classic. Rega reports that only 2 part assemblies remain unchanged from the prior RP3 model, the dustcover and dustcover hinges. Significant revisions to plinth, platter, tonearm show net improvements in fit and finish, {{as well as}} performance. The new plinth is an MDF core with a high-pressure acrylic laminate finish, and thicker braces, for improved strength and aesthetics, lowering <b>noise</b> <b>floor</b> and improving response. The main bearing well has been completely redesigned to reduce pressure on the ball bearing and hub, while allowing for a higher tolerance assembly, netting smoother operation and lower noise. A new hub (subplatter) is constructed of polycarbonate, reshaped to improve contact with the platter and lower overall resonance of the main bearing/hub/platter assembly. The 12mm platter is a new glass material, dubbed Optiwhite, is noticeably clearer in appearance and {{is said to be}} machined to higher tolerance which improves rotational stability. The old RB303 tonearm {{has been replaced by a}} new RB330 version of the classic, with patent pending [...] "zero-tolerance" [...] bearings, stiffer vertical bearing housing, redesigned bias (anti-skate) housing, improved three-point plinth mounting, a new arm tube coating, and new arm wiring. The 24V AC synchronous motor has a new control PCB and housing cover for greater consistency during assembly and improved reliability, and the power switch has been relocated under the plinth for better ergonomics. New feet are said to lower noise transfer into the turntable, via a new stiffer, wider, hollow cone design constructed from Santoprene rubber. As always, the Planar 3 is still produced in Rega's UK manufacturing plant located in Southend-on-Sea, Essex UK. Remarkably, the 2016 Planar 3 only rose in price nominally from its predecessor, revealing the benefits of Rega's increased manufacturing capacity and popularity.|$|E
