2500|$|Negative {{interest}} rates have been proposed in the past, notably in the late 19th century by Silvio Gesell. A <b>negative</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> can be described (as by Gesell) as a [...] "tax on holding money"; he proposed it as the Freigeld (free money) component of his Freiwirtschaft (free economy) system. To prevent people from holding cash (and thus earning 0%), Gesell suggested issuing money for a limited duration, after which it must be exchanged for new bills; attempts to hold money thus result in it expiring and becoming worthless. Along similar lines, John Maynard Keynes approvingly cited {{the idea of a}} carrying tax on money, (1936, The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money) but dismissed it due to administrative difficulties. More recently, a carry tax on currency was proposed by a Federal Reserve employee (Marvin Goodfriend) in 1999, to be implemented via magnetic strips on bills, deducting the carry tax upon deposit, the tax being based on how long the bill had been held.|$|E
2500|$|On 18 December 2014, the Swiss {{central bank}} {{introduced}} a <b>negative</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> on bank deposits {{to support its}} CHF ceiling. However, with the euro declining in value over the following weeks, in a move dubbed Francogeddon for its effect on markets, the Swiss National Bank abandoned the ceiling on 15 January 2015, and the franc promptly increased in value compared with the euro by 30%, although this only lasted {{a few minutes before}} part of the increase was reversed. The move was not announced in advance and resulted in [...] "turmoil" [...] in stock and currency markets. By the close of trading that day, the franc was up 23% against the euro and 21% against the US dollar. The full daily range of franc was equal to $31,000 per single futures contract (to the positive if long, to the negative if short), and is more than the market moved collectively in the previous thousand days. [...] The key interest rate was also lowered from −0.25% to −0.75%, meaning investors would be paying an increased fee to keep their funds in a Swiss bank account. This devaluation of the euro against the franc is expected to hurt Switzerland's large export industry. The Swatch Group, for example, saw its shares drop 15% (in Swiss franc terms) with the announcements so that the share price may have increased on that day in terms of other major currencies.|$|E

40|$|The {{introduction}} of <b>negative</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates,</b> {{as an additional}} tool of unconventional monetary policy in recent years, leads to many, yet largely polarized debates {{about the implications of}} the unconventional monetary policy of central banks. The main reason for their introduction in some economies, namely the threat of deflation, is also questioned, as well as the negative side effects of this instrument on financial stability and economic growth, and finally, their limited scope is under scrutiny. Due to the still insufficient research in this field, the aim of the diploma thesis is to evaluate the concerns and the main long-term risks and impacts of the monetary policy using <b>negative</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> in the context of deflation threats. The analysis of available data confirms both the concerns about the negative effects of <b>negative</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> on the banking sector, the recovery process of public finances, the possible rise of a price bubble on the financial markets and real estate markets, or on the possibility of excessive risk taking, {{and on the other hand}} draws attention to the direct dependence between negative impacts and the duration of monetary policy using <b>negative</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates...</b>|$|R

40|$|Bachelor {{thesis is}} focused {{on one of the}} most topical themes in the field of a {{monetary}} policy, the <b>negative</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates.</b> Until recent times the effective lower bound of <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> imposed by central banks was thought to be the strict null but macroeconomic conditions of certain European countries or Japan made policy makers start to experiment with the unexplored tool of a monetary policy.

Additionally, the thesis {{is focused on}} the issue concerning an increase in risks presented by the financial markets arising from this monetary policy.

5000|$|Some {{economists have}} noted that under full-reserve banking, because banks would not earn revenue from lending against demand deposits, depositors {{would have to pay}} fees for the {{services}} associated with checking accounts. This, it is felt, would probably be rejected by the public although with central bank zero and <b>negative</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> policies, some writers have noted depositors are already experiencing paying to put their savings even in fractional reserve banks. [...] Economists Douglas W. Diamond and Philip H. Dybvig have warned that under full-reserve banking, since banks would not be permitted to lend out funds deposited in demand accounts, this function could be expected to be taken over by unregulated institutions. Unregulated institutions (such as high-yield debt issuers) would take over the economically necessary role of financial intermediation and maturity transformation, therefore destabilizing the financial system and leading to more frequent financial crises.|$|E
