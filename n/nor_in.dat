30|$|The {{pattern of}} the NORs {{distribution}} is rather uniform among populations of mole rats with varying chromosomal numbers. The number of the NOR-bearing autosomal pairs varies from two to five; however, their actual localization may involve various autosomal pairs (Ivanitskaya et al. 1997, 2008, Arslan et al. 2011 a, 2013, 2014). Gülkaç and Küçükdumlu (1999) localized <b>NORs</b> <b>in</b> two pairs of subtelocentric autosomes in the 2 n[*]=[*] 52 complement. Ivanitskaya et al. (1997) recorded <b>NORs</b> <b>in</b> the two largest subtelocentric pairs and, additionally, also in the small submetacentric pair possessing the telomeric dark C-band.

40|$|Abstract: In this investigation, {{patterns}} {{of variation in}} the nucleolus organizer regions (<b>NORs)</b> <b>in</b> the chromosomes of Spalax leucodon and Spalax ehrenbergi were studied. The chromosomal location of the Ag-NORs was determined in two mole rat species.

In both mole rat species, the chromosomal locations of Ag-NORs were determined {{to be on the}} terminal of the short arms of the subtelocentrics. The possibilty of Robertsonian translocation and the loss of paracentric <b>NORs</b> <b>in</b> S. ehrenbergi were discussed from an evolutionary point of view...|$|R

30|$|Therefore, {{nucleolus}} and NOR counts play {{an important}} role in determining polyploidy using chromosome counting and flow cytometry in a cytogenetic study. In the chromosome metaphase of Korean rose bitterling, there were 2 <b>NORs</b> <b>in</b> the diploid, while the tetraploids contained 4 (arrows in Fig.  3). The nucleolus in cells had 1 or 2 diploids; however, in the induced tetraploid, 1, 2, 3, and 4 NORs were observed (Fig.  4). Similar to the current results, the triploid induction study of far eastern catfish, Silurus asotus, showed 1, 2, and 3 <b>NORs</b> <b>in</b> the triploid. This was not considered a chromosome aberration, but the exact result directed from triploid (Kim et al. 2001). In addition, the tetraploidy induction study of salmon embryos using hydrostatic pressure shock was reported by inducing polyploid mosaics with 4 or more nucleoli. Therefore, the change <b>in</b> <b>NORs</b> <b>in</b> the induced tetraploid bitterling supported induced tetraploid polyploidization, and not an aneuploid result from chromosome aberration. In addition, the tendency that tetraploid fries of bitterling, appeared small compared with diploid fries, supported a similar result in the study of induced tetraploid mud loach (Fig.  1; Nam et al. 2001 a).|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} the <b>NOR</b> distribution <b>in</b> ten populations of Physalaemus cuvieri from {{different regions of}} Brazil and Argentina. A high variability <b>in</b> <b>NOR</b> pattern was observed and provided a useful tool in grouping several populations. The specimens {{from the state of}} Tocantins, northern Brazil, could easily be distinguished from all the other analyzed populations, since its karyotype presented <b>NORs</b> <b>in</b> the chromosome pairs 1, 3, 4 and 10 (and sometimes also in chromosome 5), and several pericentromeric C-bands. A NOR-site in chromosome 9 characterized three populations from the northeastern region of Brazil. Interestingly, the P. cuvieri populations located in opposite extremes of the geographic distribution had, as a fixed condition, the presence of <b>NORs</b> <b>in</b> 8 q int and 11 p. Besides interpopulational divergences, intrapopulational variability was observed in the number of NORs, except for populations from the states of Bahia and Minas Gerais, which are boundary states respectively in the northeastern and southeastern regions of Brazil. <b>In</b> relation to <b>NOR</b> size, interindividual variations occurred in all Brazilian and Argentinean populations. Additionally, intraindividual variability <b>in</b> <b>NOR</b> size was detected in specimens from Minas Gerais. The data presented herein revealed substantial geographic polytypic variation in P. cuvieri and indicated that a taxonomic reexamination of this species is necessary...|$|R

Its distribution is considered unusual because despite being separated from its closest relative, S.nicholsi in Puerto Rico, another species, the Puerto Rican Crested Toad (Bufo lemur), has a geographic range that includes both islands, yet it has not diverged.|$|E

The omission of Shepseskare, be it between Neferirkare and Neferefre or between Neferefre and Nyuserre, indicates that his reign {{must have been very}} short.

5|$|Compatibility {{tests as}} well as {{molecular}} analysis indicated that A.areolatum separated very early from other Amylostereum fungi. The other three species separated later {{from each other and}} are thus partially compatible to each other. A.ferreum and A.laevigatum produced in 59% of all cases a common mycelium, A.ferreum and A.chailletii only in 44%. There is an undescribed species in Amylostereum; according to DNA analysis, it stands between A.laevigatum and A.ferreum. This is remarkable, as these fungi originated from Mycetangae (storing organs of Platypodinae) of a North American wood wasp, while A.laevigatum has never been seen as symbiont of wood wasps, neither in North American <b>nor</b> <b>in</b> Europe. The fungus possibly represents a separated species or a subtaxon of A.laevigatum. As A.areolatum and A.chailletii mainly reproduce asexually through the symbiosis of wood wasps, the genetic variability within these species is relatively low.|$|E

5|$|Since {{as early}} as 1967, local {{officials}} have discussed building a Manchester bypass, either as a separate project {{or as part of}} a road bypassing both Hampstead and Manchester. However, by the mid-1970s, the town of Manchester decided it did not want the bypass. The bypass was planned to pass to the west of Manchester, but the town allowed a residential subdivision to be built along the bypass route. The planned bypass route was eventually changed to be east of town. After two decades of disagreement by the town and county over the path of the bypass, in 1993 the bypass was placed in the town's master plan. However, state support for the Manchester bypass was scrapped in 1998 by Smart Growth proponent and governor Parris Glendening, who said the bypass would promote suburban sprawl. The Manchester Bypass is neither in the Maryland Department of Transportation's Consolidated Transportation Program for 2012 to 2017 <b>nor</b> <b>in</b> MDSHA's 2011 Highway Needs Inventory for the next 20 years.|$|E

Quantitative DNA analysis was performed on three tumors: a teratocarcinoma (TC) and the Leydig cell tumor, which had provided no analyzable mitoses, and a seminoma which was cytogenetically diploid. In all three cases, the major populations were hyperdiploid.
