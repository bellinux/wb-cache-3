5|$|The steppe {{societies}} of Inner Asia, whose climate favoured a pastoral economy, stood {{in stark contrast}} to the Chinese mode of development. As animal herds are migratory by nature, communities could not afford to be stationary and therefore evolved as <b>nomads.</b> According to the influential Mongolist Owen Lattimore this lifestyle proved to be incompatible with the Chinese economic model. As the steppe population grew, pastoral agriculture alone could not support the population, and tribal alliances needed to be maintained by material rewards. For these needs, the <b>nomads</b> had to turn to the settled societies to get grains, metal tools, and luxury goods, which they could not produce by themselves. If denied trade by the settled peoples, the <b>nomads</b> would resort to raiding or even conquest.|$|E

When Chief Engineer Scott tries to intervene, <b>Nomad</b> simply kills him. Spock rebukes <b>Nomad</b> for harming Uhura; <b>Nomad</b> retorts that she is [...] "a mass of conflicting impulses". Kirk is disgusted over what has just happened, but <b>Nomad</b> offers to [...] "repair the Scott unit", claiming {{that it was only}} acting in self-defense. In a display of its powers, <b>Nomad</b> returns Scott to life. Kirk then orders <b>Nomad</b> to repair Uhura, which it claims it cannot do since it has erased her [...] "knowledge banks". Spock suggests that if there's no damage to her brain, she can be re-educated. There are sufficient tapes in the computer library to do this, and Nurse Chapel is assigned to work with Uhura.|$|R

5|$|The third season, , begins {{two weeks}} later with {{people all over the}} world {{discovering}} airbending powers as a result of the Harmonic Convergence. As Tenzin, Korra, and her friends recruit them to re-establish the extinct Air <b>Nomads,</b> the newly airbending criminal Zaheer escapes his prison, frees his allies Ghazan, Ming-Hua, and P'Li, and attempts to kidnap the Avatar. This fails thanks to the help of Suyin Beifong, Lin's previously estranged sister. Zaheer and his team– members of the Red Lotus, an anarchic secret society– kill the Earth Queen, throwing her kingdom into chaos, and try to force Korra's surrender by taking the Air <b>Nomads</b> hostage, including Suyin's daughter Opal. In the final confrontation, Zaheer's comrades are killed and he is captured by the Air <b>Nomads</b> led by Jinora. Two weeks later, a weakened, wheelchair-bound Korra watches as Jinora is anointed an airbending master, and Tenzin rededicates the Air <b>Nomads</b> to service to the world.|$|E

5|$|Lions are {{the most}} {{socially}} inclined of all wild felids, most of which remain quite solitary in nature, and have two types of social organisation. Some lions are residents, living in groups of related lionesses, their mates, and offspring. Such a group is called a pride. Females form the stable social unit in a pride and do not tolerate outside females. Membership only changes with the births and deaths of lionesses, although some females do leave and become nomadic. Although extremely large prides, consisting of up over 30 individuals, have been observed, the average pride consists of around fifteen lions; including several adult females, up to four males (known as a coalition if more than one) and their cubs of both sexes. The sole exception to this pattern is the Tsavo lion pride which always has just one adult male. Male cubs are excluded from their maternal pride when they reach maturity at around 2–3 years of age. The second organisational behaviour is labeled <b>nomads,</b> who range widely and move about sporadically, either singularly or in pairs. Pairs are more frequent among related males who have been excluded from their birth pride. Note that a lion may switch lifestyles; <b>nomads</b> may become residents and vice versa. Interactions between prides and <b>nomads</b> tend to be hostile, although pride females in estrous may allow nomad males to approach them.|$|E

5|$|Owing to the {{scarcity}} of evidence dating to Unas' reign, we {{know very little about}} his activities. Existing trade relations with foreign countries and cities, in particular Byblos, seem to have continued during Unas' time on the throne. Reliefs from the causeway of his pyramid complex show two large seagoing ships coming back from an expedition to the Levantine coast with Syro-Canaanite men, who were either the boat crews or slaves. Another relief depicts a military campaign, Egyptians armed with bows and daggers attacking Canaanite <b>nomads</b> called the Shasu. Similar reliefs have been found in preceding pyramid complexes, such as that of Sahure, and they may thus be standard themes rather than depictions of actual events. Other sources tend to confirm the accuracy of these depictions; however, for example the autobiography of Weni relates many punitive raids against Canaanite <b>nomads</b> in the early Sixth Dynasty.|$|E

50|$|<b>Nomad</b> was {{released}} before these industry events, and thus, like System R, <b>Nomad</b> drew on earlier academic work by relational database pioneers such as E. F. Codd. Early <b>Nomad</b> development was in particular inspired by Christopher J. Date's influential An Introduction to Database Systems, itself {{first published in}} 1975. This book had technical ideas about the relational database model, and included a brief mention of SEQUEL (later SQL). Later editions of the book included <b>Nomad</b> itself, and Date's approval of <b>Nomad's</b> support of the relational database model.|$|R
5|$|After Palmyra's {{destruction}} in 273, {{it became a}} market for villagers and <b>nomads</b> from the surrounding area. The city regained some of its prosperity during the Umayyad era, indicated by {{the discovery of a}} large Umayyad souq in the colonnaded street. Palmyra was a minor trading center until its {{destruction in}} 1400; according to Sharaf ad-Din Ali Yazdi, Timur's men took 200,000 sheep, and the city was reduced into a settlement on the desert border whose inhabitants herded and cultivated small plots for vegetables and corn.|$|E
5|$|Away {{from the}} urban centre, the tribal people of Chamba are divided into two major groups; the Gujjars and the Gaddis. The Gujjars, mainly <b>nomads,</b> came to Chamba across the state border from Kashmir along the trade routes. They belong to nomadic herdsmen of the Islamic community, and travel to lowland Punjab in the autumn with their {{livestock}} to avoid the harsh winter of the Chamba hills. Their features are Turkic and have a distinct language and culture aloof from the main town.|$|E
5|$|Between 1969 and 1972, as he {{was working}} on The Nomadic Alternative, Chatwin {{travelled}} extensively and pursued other endeavours in an attempt to establish a creative career. He co-curated an exhibit on Nomadic Art of the Asian Steppes, which opened at Asia House Gallery in New York City in 1970. He considered publishing an account of his 1969 trip to Afghanistan with Peter Levi. Levi published his own book about it, The Light Garden of the Angel King: Journeys in Afghanistan (1972). Chatwin contributed two articles on <b>nomads</b> to Vogue and another article to History Today.|$|E

5|$|Chatwin's {{writing was}} shaped by {{his work as a}} {{cataloguer}} at Sotheby's, which provided him with years of practice writing concise yet vivid descriptions of objects with the intention of enticing buyers. In addition, Chatwin's interest in <b>nomads</b> also influenced his writing. One aspect of nomadic culture that interested him was the few possessions they had. Their spartan way of life appealed to his aesthetic sense, and it was something he sought to emulate in both his life and his writing. He strove to strip unnecessary objects from his life and unnecessary words from his prose.|$|E
5|$|Contrary {{to popular}} belief, {{it is not}} only males that are ousted from their pride to become <b>nomads,</b> {{although}} most females certainly do remain with their birth pride. However, when the pride becomes too large, the next generation of female cubs may be forced to leave to eke out their own territory. Furthermore, when a new male lion takes over the pride, adolescent lions, both male and female, may be evicted.|$|E
5|$|During a {{visit with}} his parents, Linnaeus told them about his plan to travel to Lapland; Rudbeck had made the journey in 1695, but the {{detailed}} results of his exploration were lost in a fire seven years afterwards. Linnaeus' hope was to find new plants, animals and possibly valuable minerals. He was also curious about the customs of the native Sami people, reindeer-herding <b>nomads</b> who wandered Scandinavia's vast tundras. In April 1732, Linnaeus was awarded {{a grant from the}} Royal Society of Sciences in Uppsala for his journey.|$|E
5000|$|Kirk again confronts <b>Nomad</b> and {{questions}} its logic of destroying imperfect beings. Kirk tells <b>Nomad</b> that <b>Nomad</b> itself {{has made a}} mistake, something only an imperfect being can do. He tells <b>Nomad</b> that it has committed an error by mistaking Captain Kirk for its creator, Jackson Roykirk, and <b>Nomad's</b> failure to discover its first error is a second error and further evidence of its own imperfection. Finally, Kirk points out that <b>Nomad's</b> delayed immediate-execution {{in light of these}} errors is a third error. Realizing the implications of Kirk's reasoning, <b>Nomad</b> is caught in a logic loop (as a fictional representation of a form of the real-world liar paradox) and begins to execute its primary function on itself. The machine begins self-destruction, shaking about in place instead of steadily hovering, its simulated voice rising in pitch. The ultra-logical Mr. Spock, who has been watching this confrontation, compliments Kirk, saying: [...] "Your logic is impeccable, Captain. We are in grave danger." [...] At the last moment, Kirk has <b>Nomad</b> rushed to the transporter room with anti-gravity carriers and beamed into space. Seconds after transport, an explosion is detected near the Enterprise and <b>Nomad</b> is no more.|$|R

As the U.S. forces continue to the main excavation site, the central mountain on the island begins to fall apart, revealing a huge alien structure inside, which is nearly {{the size of the}} mountain itself. <b>Nomad</b> enters the excavation site at the mountain's base, but is captured by Kyong's men. Kyong deactivates <b>Nomad's</b> Nanosuit, and <b>Nomad</b> watches, helpless, as Kyong shoots one of the hostages in the head and then detonates explosive charges to open the structure.
