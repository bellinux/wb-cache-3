5|$|On February 16, 2004, Fonda led a {{march through}} Ciudad Juárez, with Sally Field, Eve Ensler and other women, urging Mexico to provide {{sufficient}} resources to <b>newly</b> <b>appointed</b> officials helping investigate {{the murders of}} hundreds {{of women in the}} rough border city. That same year, she served as a mentor to the first all-transgender cast of The Vagina Monologues.|$|E
5|$|After the {{successful}} {{defense of the}} city in 1807, the local criollos increased their political power with their higher military role. There was a dispute between the <b>newly</b> <b>appointed</b> Viceroy, Santiago de Liniers, and the Buenos Aires Cabildo, led by Martín de Álzaga. Both attempted {{to take advantage of the}} new situation, and influence the criollos to support them.

5|$|The {{ground was}} first {{constructed}} in 1905, soon before the club moved in. The club rented the ground until 1933, when <b>newly</b> <b>appointed</b> chairman Charles Jeyes organised {{the purchase of}} the stadium. The club retained ownership of the ground until February 1989, when the freehold was sold to Luton Borough Council for £3.25million. The club was granted a seven-year lease at peppercorn rent for its continued use. This arrangement has been extended several times, and as of 2015 is due to end in 2028.|$|E

The final directive for this offensive, issued on 30 April, gave a start date of 18 May.|$|E
5|$|With the {{fighting}} at an end, {{the task of}} bringing home American soldiers began almost immediately.

5|$|Augustus' {{powers were}} now complete. In fact, he dated his 'reign' from the {{completion}} of the Second Settlement, July 1, 23 BC. Almost as importantly, the Principate now had constitutional stability. Later Roman Emperors were generally limited to the powers and titles originally granted to Augustus, though often <b>newly</b> <b>appointed</b> Emperors would decline {{one or more of the}} honorifics given to Augustus in order to display humility. Just as often, as their reign progressed, Emperors would appropriate all of the titles, regardless of whether they had been granted them by the Senate. Later Emperors took to wearing the civic crown, consular insignia, and the purple robes of a Triumphant general (toga picta), which became the imperial insignia well into the Byzantine era.|$|E
5|$|Blount responded {{fairly well}} to the suspension, {{improving}} his attendance in both academic and athletic pursuits. He was reinstated by <b>newly</b> <b>appointed</b> head coach Chip Kelly in March. He attended some, but not all, voluntary workouts during the off-season, but was praised for an improved attitude by fellow members of the football program. He arrived at training camp in better physical shape than in 2008. At , he was somewhat above his optimal weight, but was slimming down, and aiming for a 2,000 yard season. Blount {{was named to the}} watchlists for the Walter Camp Award and the Doak Walker Award for the 2009 season.|$|E
5|$|Burchard du Puiset (died 1196) was {{a medieval}} Anglo-Norman clergyman and {{treasurer}} of the diocese of York. Either the nephew or son of Hugh du Puiset, the Bishop of Durham, Burchard held a number of offices in the dioceses of York and Durham before being appointed treasurer by King Richard I of England in 1189. His appointment was opposed by the <b>newly</b> <b>appointed</b> Archbishop Geoffrey, {{which led to a}} long dispute between Geoffrey and Burchard that was not resolved until the mid 1190s. After the death of Hugh du Puiset, Burchard was a candidate for the Hugh's old bishopric, but lost out in the end to another candidate. Burchard died in 1196.|$|E
5|$|Béla IV died on 3 May 1270, and Ladislaus's {{father was}} crowned king two weeks later; the new monarch, however, could not {{stabilize}} his rule. Béla IV's closest advisors — Duchess Anna, and Béla IV's former palatine, Henry Kőszegi — left Hungary and sought assistance from Anna's son-in-law, King Ottokar II of Bohemia. The <b>newly</b> <b>appointed</b> Ban of Slavonia, Joachim Gutkeled, also turned against Stephen V and kidnapped Ladislaus {{in the summer}} of 1272. Gutkeled held Ladislaus in captivity in the fortress of Koprivnica in Slavonia. Historian Pál Engel suggests that Joachim Gutkeled planned to force Stephen V to divide Hungary with Ladislaus. Stephen V besieged Koprivnica, but could not take it. Stephen fell seriously ill and died on 6 August.|$|E
5|$|Coonley died in 1958; ACS {{had looked}} to Coonley for her {{leadership}} {{over the years}} but even more so for her philanthropy. ACS began charging tuition in 1929, but still relied on Coonley's financial support, and her death caused serious financial hardship. Under the direction of <b>newly</b> <b>appointed</b> headmaster John Malach, a summer program was launched in 1960, open to all children from the surrounding area, to increase revenues and visibility. A swimming pool was added in 1961 to bolster the program. Enrollment had declined {{over the years and}} Malach marketed the program aggressively, personally interviewing prospective students. In 1964 enrollment again reached 200 students, which brought in additional tuition and much needed financial stability.|$|E
5|$|Early in 1819 Congress made {{a voyage}} {{under the command}} of Captain John D. Henley to China, {{becoming}} the first U.S. warship to visit that country. She returned to the United States in May 1821. Shortly afterward, pirates in the West Indies began seizing American merchant ships and in early 1822, she served as the flagship of Commodore James Biddle. She is recorded as collecting prisoners from the captured pirate ship Bandara D'Sangare on 24 July of that year. Her next recorded activity is returning to Norfolk in April 1823 where Biddle immediately prepared for a voyage to Spain and Argentina to deliver the <b>newly</b> <b>appointed</b> Ministers, Hugh Nelson and Caesar A. Rodney respectively.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{integration}} of southern Vietnam into the central administration, <b>newly</b> <b>appointed</b> imperial officials arrived in Saigon. The new mandarins carried out a detailed inquiry into Duyệt's rule and claimed that widespread corruption and abuse of power took place. Bạch Xuân Nguyên, {{the head of the}} inquiry, called for Duyet's posthumous prosecution, which resulted in 100 lashes being applied to his grave. Many of Duyệt's subordinates were arrested and 16 of his family members were executed. This action prompted the Duyệt's officials—fearful of their positions and security under the central system—to launch a revolt under the leadership of his adopted son Lê Văn Khôi. Historical opinion is divided with scholars contesting whether the humiliation of Duyệt or the loss of southern autonomy was the main catalyst.|$|E
5|$|In 1929 Harcourt Williams, <b>newly</b> <b>appointed</b> as {{director}} of productions at the Old Vic, invited Gielgud to join the company for the forthcoming season. The Old Vic, in an unfashionable area of London south of the Thames, was run by Lilian Baylis to offer plays and operas to a mostly working-class audience at low ticket prices. She paid her performers very modest wages, but the theatre was known for its unrivalled repertory of classics, mostly Shakespeare, and Gielgud {{was not the first}} West End star to take a large pay cut to work there. It was, in Morley's words, the place to learn Shakespearean technique and try new ideas.|$|E
5|$|In February 1938, on {{the advice}} of his <b>newly</b> <b>appointed</b> foreign minister, the {{strongly}} pro-Japanese Joachim von Ribbentrop, Hitler ended the Sino-German alliance with the Republic of China to instead enter into an alliance with the more modern and powerful Empire of Japan. Hitler announced German recognition of Manchukuo, the Japanese-occupied state in Manchuria, and renounced German claims to their former colonies in the Pacific held by Japan. Hitler ordered an end to arms shipments to China and recalled all German officers working with the Chinese Army. In retaliation, Chinese General Chiang Kai-shek cancelled all Sino-German economic agreements, depriving the Germans of many Chinese raw materials.|$|E
5|$|In January 1884, the {{distinguished}} conductor Hans von Bülow brought the Meiningen Court Orchestra to Kassel and gave two concerts. Hoping {{to escape from}} his job in the theatre, Mahler unsuccessfully sought a post as Bülow's permanent assistant. However, {{in the following year}} his efforts to find new employment resulted in a six-year contract with the prestigious Leipzig Opera, to begin in August 1886. Unwilling to remain in Kassel for another year, Mahler resigned on 22 June 1885, and applied for, and through good fortune was offered a standby appointment as conductor at the Royal Deutsches Landestheater in Prague by the theatre's <b>newly</b> <b>appointed</b> director, the famous Angelo Neumann.|$|E
5|$|In early 1941, {{she took}} {{a leave of absence}} from Missouri in hopes of finding a {{position}} elsewhere. She accepted a visiting Professorship at Columbia University, where her former Cornell colleague Marcus Rhoades was a professor. Rhoades also offered to share his research field at Cold Spring Harbor on Long Island. In December 1941, she was offered a research position by Milislav Demerec, the <b>newly</b> <b>appointed</b> acting director of the Carnegie Institution of Washington's Department of Genetics Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory; McClintock accepted his invitation despite her qualms and became a permanent member of the faculty.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of Raoul Silva's attack on MI6, a cryptic message sets in motion events that will see James Bond come face-to-face with the sinister organisation known as SPECTRE. As Gareth Mallory, the <b>newly</b> <b>appointed</b> M, continues fighting political pressures that threaten the future of MI6, Bond follows a trail from Mexico to Austria and Morocco as he is drawn into a confrontation with an enemy from his past; one who holds a dangerous secret that will force him to question the value of everything he has fought to protect.|$|E
5|$|Italian armies easily outnumbered {{those of}} the British, who were {{defending}} multiple areas in North Africa with skeleton forces. With Cyrenaica and the Sudan under threat as well as Somaliland, only token units were available to control what was considered a relatively unimportant possession. In fact, until December 1939 British policy had been to abandon Somaliland altogether {{in the face of}} invasion. However, General Archibald Wavell, the <b>newly</b> <b>appointed</b> commander of British armies in Africa, successfully recommended to the British Chiefs of Staff that Somaliland be defended. A multiracial congregation of five battalions, the minimum force that was adjudged capable of defending the region, was assembled by the beginning of August.|$|E
5|$|Nash was {{selected}} as captain of South Melbourne for the 1937 season to replace the retiring Jack Bisset, {{becoming part of the}} first father and son team to captain a VFL/AFL side. It is thought that South Melbourne's <b>newly</b> <b>appointed</b> coach Roy Cazaly influenced the selection of Nash as captain, as Cazaly, Nash's coach in Tasmania, believed Nash to be the best footballer ever. There was some controversy over Nash's selection as captain, as it had been expected that vice-captain Brighton Diggins would be named captain. In response, Diggins quit South.|$|E
5|$|<b>Newly</b> <b>appointed</b> England manager Walter Winterbottom played Lawton in England's first {{official}} match {{in seven years}} on 28 September 1946, a 7–2 win over Ireland. He played the remaining three fixtures of 1946, and scored four goals in a 8–2 victory over the Netherlands at Leeds Road on 27 November. On 10 May 1947, he scored two goals playing for the Great Britain XI in a 6–1 victory over a Rest of Europe XI that was billed as the 'Match of the Century'. Five days later he scored four goals in a 10–0 victory over Portugal at Lisbon's Estádio Nacional. On 21 September, he scored after just 12 seconds in a 5–2 win over Belgium at Heysel Stadium.|$|E
5|$|Purvis {{settled in}} Honolulu around 1879. On August26, 1882, he was created {{a major in}} the Hawaiian {{military}} and appointed as military instructor. He was also appointed as King Kalākaua's Vice-Chamberlain under Chamberlain Charles Hastings Judd. In 1882 he served as acting chamberlain during Judd's trip to Europe and was appointed {{as a member of}} the King's Staff with the rank of colonel on December23, 1884. By the end of August 1886, he had resigned the office of vice chamberlain after his superior Judd was dismissed from his post and asked to resign by the king at the instigation of the <b>newly</b> <b>appointed</b> prime minister, Walter M. Gibson, and the cabinet ministers.|$|E
5|$|The {{authorities}} then {{arranged for}} the body to be hidden at a Capuchin monastery {{in the small town}} of Cerro Maggiore where it remained for the next eleven years. The whereabouts of the body was kept a secret, even from Mussolini's family. This remained the position until May 1957, when the <b>newly</b> <b>appointed</b> Prime Minister, Adone Zoli, agreed to Mussolini's re-interment at his place of birth in Predappio in Romagna. Zoli was reliant on the far right (including Leccisi himself, who was now a neo-fascist party deputy) to support him in Parliament. He also came from Predappio and knew Mussolini's widow, Rachele, well.|$|E
5|$|The {{battle was}} a {{disaster}} for the French. According to unofficial accounts, they lost approximately 900men killed or drowned and at least 300wounded, in addition to the loss of a number of the newly constructed landing craft. In France the <b>newly</b> <b>appointed</b> Minister of Marine Étienne Eustache Bruix ordered a second attempt on the islands soon afterwards but the orders were immediately countermanded by the French Directory, which did not want the embarrassment of a second disastrous attack. Instead, Lacrosse gave orders for most of the surviving ships to be sent to Cherbourg, detachments later reaching Saint Malo and Granville. Muskein was ordered to return to Le Havre with the remainder.|$|E
5|$|The {{giving of}} the first kvitel cements {{the status of a}} <b>newly</b> <b>appointed</b> Hasidic Rebbe. In Belz tradition, the first kvitel to a new Rebbe is proffered by a {{follower}} of the Ropshitz Hasidic dynasty. Thus, when Rabbi Yissachar Dov Rokeach assumed the mantle of leadership in 1894 {{after the death of his}} father, Rabbi Yehoshua Rokeach, he was given his first kvitel by Rabbi Yissachar Dov of Bisk, a follower of the Ropshitz dynasty. Thirty-three years later, following the funeral of Rabbi Yissachar Dov Rokeach, Rokeach's son and successor, Rabbi Aharon Rokeach, received his first kvitelach from Rabbi Yissachar Dov of Bisk and two other followers of the Ropshitz dynasty.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} {{followed up}} on a prisoner amnesty from the previous day, releasing 1,000 more prisoners who had served three-quarters of their sentence; 840 more were released from Sinai province. The Muslim Brotherhood continued to demand for Mubarak's resignation. The offices of state-owned Channel 5 in Alexandria were shut down and evacuated under the order of its chief amid mounting pressure by protesters. The government warned of a military crackdown amid ongoing protests. Foreign Minister Ahmed Aboul Gheit rejected US calls to repeal the emergency law and also accused the US of trying to impose its will on the Egyptian government. The <b>newly</b> <b>appointed</b> Mubarak's Culture Minister Gaber Asfour resigned after one week in office, citing health problems.|$|E
5|$|The gunfight {{was not the}} end of the conflict. On December 28, 1881, Virgil Earp was ambushed and maimed in {{a murder}} attempt by the Cowboys. On March 18, 1882, Cowboys fired from a dark alley through the glass door of a saloon, killing Morgan Earp. The {{suspects}} in both incidents furnished alibis supplied by other Cowboys and were not indicted. Wyatt Earp, <b>newly</b> <b>appointed</b> as Deputy U.S. Marshal in Cochise County, then took matters into his own hands in a personal vendetta. He was pursued by county sheriff Johnny Behan, who had received a warrant from Tucson for Wyatt's shooting of Frank Stilwell.|$|E
5|$|To ensure accuracy, Tayler {{arranged}} sittings {{with each}} member of the Kent team and made an effort to paint each one true to life. He initially planned to include non-striking Lancashire batsman Harry Makepeace, but when Makepeace was unable to attend a sitting, Tayler used another Lancashire player, William Findlay, as the batsman. Findlay had not actually played in that particular match, but he was available to visit Tayler's London studio as he had been <b>newly</b> <b>appointed</b> secretary of the Surrey County Cricket Club after his retirement from active cricket competition at the end of 1906.|$|E
