2500|$|I am <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>we</b> {{handled it}} all correctly. [...] The mass {{intrusion}} of pickets into Notts, not just Yorkshiremen; I accept {{some responsibility for}} that, and so will the left have to. [...] I think if as an executive we had approached Notts without pickets, {{it might have been}} different. [...] Because I reject, I have made this clear since the strike, that 25 or 30,000 Notts miners, their wives and families and communities are scabs and blacklegs. [...] I refuse to accept this. [...] We did alienate them during the strike.|$|E
2500|$|King {{appeared}} on MSNBC's [...] "The Cycle" [...] on May 9, 2014. He {{was asked by}} co-host Touré if he believed that Democratic Party has done {{enough to get the}} overwhelming support from African-Americans it receives. King's answer is said to have shocked the host. “The party does not do enough,” he said. “It's our responsibility to hold the party accountable. And I'm <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>we</b> do that. I think {{we have to find a}} way to hold the parties accountable. He went on to say that he believed there should be communication between African-Americans and the Tea Party Movement, saying [...] "the only way you change is you have to be at least communicating".|$|E

60|$|We {{thought him}} very wicked then, but, looking back, I am <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> that <b>we</b> were <b>not</b> very wicked ourselves.|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{have both}} knocked out Wilkinson, but I'm <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> that <b>we</b> {{have done with}} him. The simple plan's not always {{as easy as it}} looks." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Then {{follow the}} leader,' he cried gaily. 'Mind you, I am <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> that <b>we</b> have a drawing-room, but we pretend we have, and it's all the same. Hoop la!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why <b>not?</b> <b>Sure</b> <b>we</b> can. We'll {{help him}} get married. I tell you it'll save the pennant for us. Look how he pitched today! Nan Brown is our salvation!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{ships are}} burned," [...] said March, [...] "though I'm <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>we</b> alone did it. But here we are, looking for shelter, {{and a little}} anxious about the {{disposition}} of the natives." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The valley would guide us. We {{could do}} {{four hours a}} day before we had to camp. I'm <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>we</b> couldn't try the river. We could drag and carry all our food...." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “I {{have seen}} you {{comparatively}} thankful to get one,” said Appleby. “I’m <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> that <b>we</b> will even have bread and coffee to fall upon in another day or two.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I have {{news and}} a {{proposition}} for you," [...] Kendricks replied. [...] "I am <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> that <b>we</b> do ourselves much good by being seen about Paris together just now. I am <b>not</b> <b>sure,</b> even, {{whether it is}} safe." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Stanley {{regarded}} his neighbor's clean-shaven face almost warily. [...] "I'm <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> whether <b>we</b> don't rather overdo {{all this}} higher education," [...] he said, with {{an effect of}} conveying profound meanings.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's a good post, but I'm <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>we</b> {{have got}} spread enough," [...] he said. [...] "There's {{not much to}} resist the outward thrust a heavy train might cause. Still, I don't see how we could have carried the foot farther back." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "After all, Anneke," [...] put in grandmother, [...] "I am <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>we</b> have {{no right}} to {{complain}} of Miss Bayard's conduct toward us. Had she dropped the remotest hint of her being engaged to this Malbone, I would never have endeavored to lead my grandson to think of her seriously for one moment." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We can't be {{far off the}} land," [...] said Harry. [...] "I don't want {{to come up with}} {{it before}} daylight, but with no after canvas on her I don't suppose we could round her up and wait. If we did, I'm <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>we</b> could get her to fall off again--one of the jibs is torn to ribands and the other's split. We'll have to keep her running." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is {{all very}} well," [...] she answered, [...] "but I am <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> that <b>we</b> {{ought to be in}} the gallery at Covent Garden together, with a {{chaperon}} who will sleep!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then {{afterwards}} we grew intimate, very intimate, {{without knowing}} it, almost--indeed, I am <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> that <b>we</b> should ever {{have known it}} {{had it not been}} for the mischief-making of Eliza Layard----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then {{follow the}} leader," [...] he cried gaily. [...] "Mind you, I am <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> that <b>we</b> have a drawing-room, but we pretend we have, and it's all the same. Hoop la!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I think--if {{it is to}} have an interpretation, though I am <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>we</b> {{ought to}} take it so seriously, it would only mean that in younger days people care for victory and {{distinction}} in this world, like Norman, or as papa most likely did then; but, as they grow older, they care less, and others pass them, and they know it does not signify, for in our race all may win." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Brooke, [...] "I fancy we {{are only}} {{on the edge of}} it, but it would have cost me two or three weeks' work to break out enough of rock to form any very clear opinion alone, and I was {{scarcely}} up to it. It occurred to me that I had better come down and get the necessary men, though I'm <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>we</b> can contrive to feed them or induce them to come." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Walking--riding--yachting--I {{suppose the}} most momentous conversations {{of my life}} took place while perambulating the great court at Trinity. I was at both universities. It was a fad of my father's. He thought it {{broadening}} to the mind. I think I agree with him. I can remember--what an age ago it seems!--settling {{the basis of a}} future state with the present Secretary for India. We thought ourselves very wise. I'm <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>we</b> weren't. We were happy, Miss Vinrace, and we were young--gifts which make for wisdom." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{is a large}} subject," [...] he said, [...] "and I am <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> that <b>we</b> are of one mind. We {{will not}} discuss it. At any rate, I am very sorry for Berenice!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{was a fine}} spirit, that," [...] the Bishop declared. [...] "I am <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> that <b>we</b> are <b>not</b> all of us {{a little}} over-inclined towards compromises. The sapping away of {{conscience}} is so easy." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Tell {{us what to}} do and we'll obey orders," [...] Harry said cheerily. [...] "I'm <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> but <b>we</b> can {{run this}} craft as well as a full crew could, so long as you know enough to be captain." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said, [...] "they'd have {{to serve}} it, and while their man {{was trying to get}} down the gully I'd rip most of the bottom out of this strip of cañon. I'm <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>we</b> haven't gone far enough already to split up the whole ridge that's holding back the river. Still, I'm going on a little. I mean to make sure." [...] He bent over the machine. [...] "You have brought up some letters? The man has, perhaps, been trying to worry me again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Perhaps not. And {{when a man}} checks all a woman's finer sentiments {{towards him}} by marrying her, it is only natural that it should find a vent somewhere. However, she {{probably}} does not know of my downfall since father's death. I hardly {{think she would have}} cared to do it had she known that. (I am assuming that it is Ethelberta--Mrs. Petherwin--who sends it: of course I am <b>not</b> <b>sure.)</b> <b>We</b> must remember that when I knew her I was a gentleman at ease, who had not the least notion that I should have to work for a living, and not only so, but should have first to invent a profession to work at out of my old tastes.' ...|$|E
6000|$|But {{against the}} second {{sentence}} we must protest. The question in hand {{is not whether}} this [...] "witness of the Spirit" [...] "is something more" [...] than, anything else, but whether it exists at all, and what it is. Why was the book written, save to help toward the solution of this very matter? The question all through has been: Can an immediate influence be exercised by the Spirit of God on the spirit of man? Mr. Vaughan assents, and says (we cannot see why) {{that there is no}} mysticism in such a belief. Be that as it may, what that influence is, and how exercised, is all through the de quo agitur of Mysticism. Mr. Vaughan, however, seems here for awhile to be talking realism through an admirable page, well worth perusal (pp. 264, 265). Yet his grasp is <b>not</b> <b>sure.</b> <b>We</b> soon find him saying what More and Fox would alike deny, that [...] "The story of Christ's life and death is our soul's food." [...] No; Christ Himself is--would the Catholic Church and the Mystic alike answer. And here again the whole matter in dispute is (unconsciously to Mr. Vaughan) opened up in one word. And if this sentence does not bear directly on that problem, on what does it bear? It was therefore with extreme disappointment that on reading this, and saying to ourselves: [...] "Now we shall hear at last what Mr. Vaughan himself thinks on the matter," [...] we found that he literally turned the subject off, as if not worth investigation, by making the next speaker answer, apropos of nothing, that [...] "the traditional ascetism of the Friends is their fatal defect as a body." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I came," [...] he went on, [...] "because it {{occurred}} to me that, after all, I had my duties as your guardian, dear Esther. I am <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> that <b>we</b> can permit flirtations, you know. Let me see, how old are you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... § VI. But if <b>we</b> are <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> that <b>we</b> can put weight above it, <b>we</b> are {{perfectly}} <b>sure</b> that <b>we</b> can hang weight under it. You may always thicken your shell inside, {{and put the}} weight upon it as at x x, in d, Plate III. Not much chance of its bursting out at p, now, is there? ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Only over Sunday. He {{is going}} to look over the place to-morrow, and next day there is to be a public meeting about it. I am <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> that <b>we</b> shall <b>not</b> go with him. I do not think the place agrees with Phyllis.' ...|$|R
5000|$|... "We {{set out to}} make {{a little}} movie", {{recalled}} Grant. [...] "I'm <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>we</b> succeeded." [...] He was not the first choice to shoot the video, as Russell Mulcahy, director of many of the band's other videos, was unavailable.|$|E
5000|$|... "I'm <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>we</b> were {{as big a}} part of {{the show}} as we thought. I think the show was really about the city of Sarajevo. And at the end they weren't just applauding us or the UN peace-keepers, they were kind of applauding {{themselves}} for getting through it." [...] —Bono ...|$|E
5000|$|In August 2015, at a Southern Baptist Convention event, Bush {{stated that}} [...] "I'm <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>we</b> need {{half a billion}} dollars for women's health issues." [...] Several hours later, Bush {{released}} a statement saying: [...] "With regards to women's health funding broadly, I misspoke, as there are countless community health centers, rural clinics, and other women's health organizations that need to be fully funded. They provide critical services to all, but particularly low-income women who don’t have the access they need." ...|$|E
5000|$|Applewhite asked a {{colleague}} {{to be her}} book agent, but their attempts to have the book published resulted in strong rejections; Applewhite recalled that her agent was told by Dell Publishing's paperback imprint that [...] "We can't publish this here. I'm <b>not</b> even <b>sure</b> <b>we</b> can Xerox it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "In many ways, my dear Fischer," [...] he said, [...] "one sympathises {{with that}} speech of yours; {{but the truth}} is best, and it is to talk truths that we have met this evening. We are gaining no ground here. I am <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> that <b>we</b> are <b>not</b> losing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I know wealth makes itself wings," [...] {{answered}} the cynical stranger; [...] "but I am <b>not</b> quite <b>sure</b> <b>we</b> have it even now. You {{make a great}} show, indeed, with building and cultivation; but stock is not capital, {{any more than the}} fat of a corpulent man is health or strength." ...|$|R
