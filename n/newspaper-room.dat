60|$|The <b>{{newspaper}}-room</b> at Noirbourg {{is next to}} the roulette-room, {{into which}} the doors are always open; and Lady K. would come, with newspaper in hand, into this play-room, sometimes, and look on at the gamesters. I have mentioned a little Russian boy, a little imp with the most mischievous intelligence and good humor in his face, who was suffered by his parents to play {{as much as he}} chose, and who pulled bonbons out of one pocket and Napoleons out of the other, and seemed to have quite a diabolical luck at the table.|$|E
6000|$|The old {{bucks and}} habitues, who ordinarily stand gaping and {{grinning}} {{out of the}} great front window of the Club, had not arrived at their posts as yet--the <b>newspaper-room</b> was almost empty. One man was present whom Rawdon did not know; another to whom he owed a little score for whist, and whom, in consequence, {{he did not care}} to meet; a third was reading the Royalist (a periodical famous for its scandal and its attachment to Church and King) Sunday paper at the table, and looking up at Crawley with some interest, said, [...] "Crawley, I congratulate you." ...|$|E
6000|$|That {{was a very}} miserable {{time for}} me, even before my last visit to Checkshill. My long {{unemployed}} hours hung heavily on my hands. I kept away from home all day, partly to support a fiction that I was sedulously seeking another situation, and partly to escape the persistent question in my mother's eyes. [...] "Why did you quarrel with Mr. Rawdon? Why DID you? Why do you keep on going about with a sullen face and risk offending IT more?" [...] I {{spent most of the}} morning in the <b>newspaper-room</b> of the public library, writing impossible applications for impossible posts--I remember that among other things of the sort I offered my services to a firm of private detectives, a sinister breed of traders upon base jealousies now happily vanished from the world, and wrote apropos of an advertisement for [...] "stevedores" [...] that I did not know what the duties of a stevedore might be, but that I was apt and willing to learn--and in the afternoons and evenings I wandered through the strange lights and shadows of my native valley and hated all created things. Until my wanderings were checked by the discovery that I was wearing out my boots.|$|E
60|$|Hades {{is not an}} {{unpleasant}} place. Most of the people look rather cheerful. You don't see any frantic gamblers gnashing their teeth or dashing down their last stakes. The winners have the most anxious faces; or the poor shabby fellows who have got systems, and are pricking down the alternations of red and black on cards, and don't seem to be playing at all. On fete days the country people come in, men and women, to gamble; and THEY seem to be excited as they put down their hard-earned florins with trembling rough hands, and watch {{the turn of the}} wheel. But what you call the good company is very quiet and easy. A man loses his mass of gold, and gets up and walks off, without any particular mark of despair. The only gentleman whom I saw at Noirbourg who seemed really affected was a certain Count de Mustacheff, a Russian of enormous wealth, who clenched his fists, beat his breast, cursed his stars, and absolutely cried with grief: not for losing money, but for neglecting to win and play upon a coup de vingt, a series in which the red was turned up twenty times running: which series, had he but played, it is clear that he might have broken M. Lenoir's bank, and shut up the gambling-house, and doubled his own fortune--when he would have been no happier, and all the balls and music, all the <b>newspaper-rooms</b> and parks, all the feasting and pleasure of this delightful Rougetnoirbourg would have been at an end.|$|R
6000|$|Wherever {{he should}} find Barnes, Thomas Newcome was {{determined}} to tell him his mind. Should they meet {{on the steps of}} a church, on the flags of 'Change, or in the <b>newspaper-room</b> at Bays's, at evening-paper time, when men most do congregate, Thomas the Colonel was determined upon exposing and chastising his father's grandson. With Ethel's letter in his pocket, he took his way into the City, penetrated into the unsuspecting back-parlour of Hobson's bank, and was disappointed at first at only finding his half-brother Hobson there engaged over his newspaper. The Colonel signified his wish to see Sir Barnes Newcome. [...] "Sir Barnes was not come in yet. You've heard about the marriage," [...] says Hobson. [...] "Great news for the Barnes's, ain't it? The head of the house is as proud as a peacock about it. Said he was going out to Samuels, the diamond merchants; going to make his sister some uncommon fine present. Jolly to be uncle to a marquis, ain't it, Colonel? I'll have nothing under a duke for my girls. I say, I know whose nose is out of joint. But young fellows get over these things, and Clive won't die this time, I dare say." ...|$|E
