5|$|Israel entered one artistic gymnast {{into the}} Olympic competition. Two-time Olympian Alexander Shatilov {{qualified}} and claimed his Olympic {{spot in the}} men's apparatus and all-around events via the Olympic Test Event in Rio de Janeiro by participation. Shatilov participated in both the London and Beijing Olympics. He did not advance following the qualification round in the floor and horizontal bar events due to not achieving eighth place or higher in either. Shatilov's loss in the qualification rounds makes Rio his worst Olympic finish ever. In regards to the loss, he said “things didn’t go as I planned, but that happens in sport and there’s nothing I can do about it. You <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> to cope with disappointments and life continues. I trained hard and {{wanted to have a}} good competition, but you can’t turn the clock back. I started my floor drill well, but a small mistake cost me and I knew I had no chance after that. I never imagined a scenario like this.” He performed poorly in both the floor and bar routines, scoring 13.5 points in the floor routine, and 14.066 points in the bar routine. The floor exercise was riddled with errors and ended with a landing where it appeared as if he was trying to break a fall.|$|E

Mr. Wade, Brown's band leader, says that Devon does not <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> to read music and will likely get a full scholarship and a good position on the drumline. When Wade wants to know what Dr. Lee is planning for the BET Big Southern Classic (a large competition of college bands), Devon realizes that his heart and honor are still with the A band. He rejects the scholarship offer from the rival band and returns to A Though Devon is still not playing for the band, he cannot give up his drumming. He is sent cassette tapes from his estranged father and gets some ideas for new drum arrangements. He and Sean have a final confrontation, with Sean telling Devon that he is A's best drummer but that the band is bigger than just one person; this clears the air and they begin to work together. The two present their idea for an entrance cadence to Dr. Lee who decides they will be used during the Classic. Devon helps the drumline prepare and patches up his relationship with Laila. Lee also tells Devon that he can guarantee him a full return to the band next year.|$|E

2500|$|Multimodality in the 21st {{century has}} caused {{educational}} institutions to consider changing {{the forms of}} even its traditional aspects of classroom education. According to Hassett and Curwood, authors of Theories and Practices of Multimodal Education, “Print represents only one mode of communication…” and with a rise in digital and Internet literacy, other modes are needed, from visual texts to digital e-books. Other changes occur by integrating music and video with lesson plans during early childhood education; however, such measures are seen as augmenting and increasing literacy for educational communities by introducing new forms, rather than replacing literacy values. In several children’s books released today, written language is no longer the most important factor while producing these books. According to Miller and McVee, authors of Multimodal Composing in Classrooms, “These new literacies do not set aside traditional literacies. Students still <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> to read and write, but new literacies are integrated." [...] The main purpose of early childhood education is still evident but the form that is now being presented to children is different. Some learning outcomes include – {{but are not limited to}} – reading, writing, and language skills. For example, “Multimodal Composing In Classrooms,” written by Miller and McVee, advocates storyboarding as an assignment and says that it “is multimodal in that there is the visual and audio of a film clip, the drawing representation of the film’s images, as well as the written analysis of the scene." [...] According to Roger Essley in his article, [...] "Visual Tools for Differentiating Reading & Writing Instruction," [...] storyboarding is “the origin of all written language. Teachers are able to use storyboards for visual organization to strengthen writing skills and help the writing process. They can be used in brainstorming sessions, problem solving, planning, and much more.|$|E

60|$|It is 1814, {{it is the}} 16th of March, Shelley {{has written}} his letter, {{he has been in}} the Boinville paradise a month, his deserted wife is in her husbandless home.

40|$|The {{control of}} {{nonlinear}} systems with large uncertainty is especially challenging. In spite of this, significant {{progress has been}} made in the area of multi-model supervisory control. The most general results available for nonlinear processes relate to scenarios in which (i) all uncertainty is parametric with a known functional dependence of the state-space model with respect to the unknown parameter, and (ii) there is no measurement noise nor disturbances. Under this admittedly restrictive assumptions the results available are quite general. In [6] and related papers, a general procedure was outlined that allows the design of provably stable supervisory controllers for nonlinear systems. This procedure relies on nonadaptive techniques for control and estimation for which there is a wealth of results in the nonlinear control literature. In particular, one needs the following two ingredients: 1. For each possible value of the parameter, one <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> design a (nonadaptive) controller that would stabilize the process if the parameter value was known.
