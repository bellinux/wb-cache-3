5000|$|The Little Rouge Valley Vine, or [...] "Great Vine", is {{the largest}} <b>natural</b> <b>vine</b> in the Ontario mixed forests. Situated next to the Little Rouge River {{in the heart of}} the valley, the [...] "Great Vine" [...] is over 30 cm in {{diameter}} at the base and is estimated to have runners which, together, stretch over 1 km.|$|E
5000|$|Initially, the Boyces did {{not have}} it mind to restore the scrub. The house was {{constructed}} on higher ground {{on the side of}} Tick Hill (now known as Mt Lofty), looking east down towards what was then around four acres of scrub. Much of the timber had been cut out and stumps from eucalypts remained. Much of the <b>natural</b> <b>vine</b> scrub was heavily infested with lantana, blackberry and trees such as camphor laurel, celtis and Japanese laurel. The Boyces spent time in the mountain and rainforest country of south-east Queensland, including camping in the Canungra Valley and Lamington National Park. Following these visits, the Boyces made the decision to [...] "restore, regenerate and preserve" [...] the remnant rainforest on their property.|$|E
50|$|Marcgraviastrum gigantophyllum is {{a species}} of plant in the Marcgraviaceae family. It is endemic to Ecuador. The <b>vine's</b> <b>natural</b> habitat is {{subtropical}} or tropical moist montane areas of the Andes Ecuadorian ranges.|$|R
50|$|While rare, {{interspecific}} hybrid vines {{can result in}} the wild from cross-pollination. Due to the abundance of American Vitis species one finds such <b>natural</b> hybrid <b>vines</b> on the American continent. The majority of the well-known hybrid vines however, have been artificially created. The earliest named hybrid in America was the Alexander grape, discovered around 1740 near a vineyard planted for William Penn along the Schuylkill.|$|R
50|$|Erosion {{has always}} been a threat to the path, with few cobblestones {{remaining}} {{at the bottom of the}} path. During the 1920s and 1930s, Mrs. Ernest Fulton planted many flowers along the path, and did her best to fight the erosion. As a result, the path has bush honeysuckle, evergreens, jonquils, and a spruce tree. With this and the <b>natural</b> undergrowth, <b>vines,</b> and native hardwoods, the path is essentially a tunnel.|$|R
5000|$|The Lulonga Company was a {{concession}} {{company of the}} Congo Free State. [...] It was, with the Société Anversoise and the Abir Congo Company, {{one of the main}} producers of rubber in the Free State. [...] The company's rubber production declined in the early 20th century as a result of over harvesting of the <b>natural</b> rubber <b>vine</b> (Landolphia owariensis gentili) and the entire concession produced just seven tons of rubber in 1905. [...] Alongside Abir and the Société Anversoise the Lulonga Company handed back control of the concession to the Congo Free State in 1906.|$|R
50|$|Characteristics of Wiinblad's work include {{whimsical}} round-faced people, {{dressed in}} vaguely 19th-century costume. They are often surrounded by <b>natural</b> elements: twining <b>vines,</b> floral wreaths, and fantastical trees. When Wiinblad employed color, {{he did so}} with great assurance. His colors are saturated and strong—sometimes almost psychedelic—and are often supplemented with metallic gold or silver.|$|R
5000|$|A {{house and}} the {{adjoining}} grapevine in 4 Gospodska street are protected by the law. The house is protected as the cultural monument while the vine was protected by the city on 21 September 2014 as the <b>natural</b> monument. The <b>vine</b> is planted c1910 and still bears fruits. It is of the red grape variety, specifically the Rosette, or, {{as it is called}} in Serbia, the [...] "Frenchman".|$|R
50|$|Clarkia imbricata is a {{rare species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the evening primrose family known by the common name Vine Hill clarkia. It is endemic to Sonoma County, California, where it is known from only one remaining <b>natural</b> occurrence near <b>Vine</b> Hill. A second natural population located on private land was extirpated when the owners plowed up the soil crust. The California Native Plant Society has established a third population from cuttings and is tending it in a reserve. This is a federally listed endangered species.|$|R
5000|$|Biological {{management}} {{in the use of}} the <b>vine's</b> <b>natural</b> enemies to stop the spread and diminish the population of Cynanchum louiseae. In the United States, Cynanchum louiseae has no natural enemies, but in its native Europe, certain caterpillars, beetles, and diseases attack the plant. Researchers at Cornell University and the USDA have investigated the use of natural enemies as a way to control the plant. The use of natural enemies is controversial, because the implications of adding more non-native species to threatened areas is unknown. In 2014 Hypena caterpillars were released in Ontario, Canada to help control Cynanchum's spread.|$|R
50|$|The small, thick-skinned berries of Fiano usually produce {{very little}} juice and, given the <b>vines</b> <b>natural</b> {{propensity}} for low yields, can make Fiano an unprofitable variety to grow. It was for reasons {{such as this}} that Fiano saw significant declines {{for most of the}} 19th and 20th century as growers uprooted the grape in favor of varieties like Trebbiano and Sangiovese that could yield larger amounts of wine. However, in recent years, the variety has enjoyed an uptick in interest as southern Italian wine regions see an influx of investment in the modernization of winemaking techniques and equipment, as well as a desire to revitalize indigenous and classical varieties.|$|R
2500|$|In viticulture, growers want {{to avoid}} {{any part of the}} cordon from {{touching}} the ground because of the <b>vine's</b> <b>natural</b> inclination to send out suckers or basal shoots and take root in that area where the cordon is touching the ground. Ever since the phylloxera epidemic of the 19th century, many vines are grafted on phylloxera resistant rootstock. However, the [...] "top part" [...] of the grafted vine is still very susceptible to the phylloxera and should a part of that vine take root both the daughter and the original mother vine will risk being infected by the louse. Additionally this daughter vine will leech resources of water and nutrients from the mother vine which can diminish the quality of both vines' grape production.|$|R
50|$|Light sculptures can {{be either}} flat (most common) or three-dimensional. Flat sculptures are the motifs, and are often on metal frames, but garland can also be {{attached}} to outdoor motifs. Indoor motifs often have a multicolored plastic backing sheet, sometimes holographic. 3D sculptures include deer or reindeer (even moose) in various positions, and with or without antlers, often with a motor to move the head up and down or {{side to side as}} if grazing. These and other 3D displays may be bare-frame, or be covered with garland, looped and woven transparent plastic cord or acrylic, or <b>natural</b> or goldtone-painted <b>vines.</b> Snowflakes are a popular design for municipal displays, {{so as not to be}} misconstrued as a government endorsement of religion, or so they can be left up all winter.|$|R
25|$|Chenin blanc (known also as Pineau de la Loire {{among other}} names) {{is a white}} wine grape variety from the Loire Valley of France. Its high acidity means {{it can be used}} to make {{everything}} from sparkling wines to well-balanced dessert wines, although it can produce very bland, neutral wines if the <b>vine's</b> <b>natural</b> vigor is not controlled. Outside the Loire it is found in most of the New World wine regions; it is the most widely planted variety in South Africa, where it is also known as Steen. The grape may have been one of the first to be grown in South Africa by Jan van Riebeeck in 1655, or it may have come to that country with Huguenots fleeing France after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685. Chenin blanc was often misidentified in Australia as well, so tracing its early history in the country is not easy. It may have been introduced in James Busby's collection of 1832, but C. Waterhouse was growing Steen at Highercombe in Houghton, South Australia by 1862.|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} {{tested the}} natural enemies hypothesis {{in an attempt}} to explain why lower pest densities are observed in some diversified farming systems. The research evaluated the influence of floral resource provisioning (FRP) and chemical ecology strategies on biological control of Erythroneura leafhoppers (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae) and Planococcus mealybug (Hemiptera: Pseudococcidae) in California vineyards. Field and laboratory studies quantified the impacts on crop damage, pest and natural enemy abundance, and natural enemies fitness theorized to be enhanced through floral resource provisioning in agroecosystems. Multiple two-year studies measured the impact of intercropping three flowering ground covers, lacy phacelia (Phacelia tanacetifolia), bishop's weed (Ammi majus), and common carrot (Daucus carota) on biological control of leafhoppers and vine mealybug by the parasitoids Anagrus spp. (Hymenoptera: Mymaridae) and Anagyrus pseudococci (Hymenoptera: Encyrtidae). Using identical intercropping treatments, the research included three large scale and fully replicated research designs located in the central San Joaquin, the northern San Joaquin, and the Napa Valley of California. Laboratory studies quantified the impacts of FRP on the fitness of Anagyrus pseudococci, a key parasitoid <b>natural</b> enemy of <b>vine</b> mealybug. The central San Joaquin Valley field study measured the impact of FRP and pheromone based mating disruption on biological control of vine mealybug. The northern San Joaquin Valley field study measured the impact of FRP and methyl salicylate on biological control of Erythroneura leafhoppers. The Napa Valley field study measured the effect of methyl salicylate alone on biological control of Erythroneura leafhoppers...|$|R
