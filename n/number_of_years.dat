It considers the various factors that affect the second-hand cars residue ratio, borrowed ideas of AHP, and the use of MATLAB software for weight analysis, simplify complex the calculation process, so calculation of residue ratio is both scientific and simple, so that it is widely used. Determining Method of Used Car Residue Ratio Residue ratio is used to reflect index of degree of old and new vehicle, In other words, it indicates that the function of the used car or use the value of the ratio of new vehicle function or use value, therefore should consider the various factors influencing the price of a used car appraisal, so as to determine the scientific and reasonable used the new rate.
