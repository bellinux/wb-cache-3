25|$|By age 3–5, {{children}} can master illocutionary intent, {{knowing what you}} meant to say even though you might <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> it and turnabout, which is turning the conversation over to another person.|$|E
25|$|In the {{canonical}} approach, theological concerns take precedent over historical interests. No attempt {{is made to}} reconstruct a historical portrait of Paul {{in order to prove}} some point or to disprove another. There is no psychologizing based on what Paul could or could <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>said.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Abraham ibn Ezra {{read the}} words “He will send His angel before you” in [...] as a prayer. Ibn Ezra argued {{that if it were}} a prophesy, Abraham would <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> in [...] “And if the woman is not willing to follow you [...] [...] [...] [...]” ...|$|E
60|$|Mr. Jerome {{was obliged}} to rest {{contented}} with this promise, and rode home sorrowfully, reproaching himself with <b>not</b> <b>having</b> <b>said</b> one thing he meant to say when setting out, and with having 'clean forgot' the arguments he had intended to quote from Mr. Stickney.|$|R
50|$|The {{right to}} fix {{reasonable}} charges has been granted, {{but the power}} of declaring what shall be deemed reasonable <b>has</b> <b>not</b> been surrendered. If {{there had been an}} intention of surrendering this power, {{it would have been easy}} to say so. <b>Not</b> <b>having</b> <b>said</b> so, the conclusive presumption is there was no such intention.|$|R
6000|$|I {{feel as if}} I <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>said</b> half, {{and they}} have come to ask me if I <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>said</b> all! My beloved friend, may you be happy in all ways! ...|$|R
2500|$|Clausen {{does not}} answer why Washington could <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> [...] "an {{exceptionally}} reliable source" [...] was involved, with very strong instructions to pay attention. Additionally, Clausen claims military men of Kimmel and Short's seniority and background should have understood {{the significance of the}} warnings, and should have been more vigilant than they were, as for instance in scouting plane flights from Hawaii, which were partial at best in the period just before the attack. All other Pacific commands took appropriate measures for their situations.|$|E
2500|$|Maududi had {{a unique}} {{perspective}} on the transmission of hadith—the doings and sayings of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, that form part of the basis of Islamic law. Rather than basing judgement {{of the quality of}} a hadith on the number and reliability of the chain of transmission (known as isnad, Hadith where passed on orally before being written down) [...] and the judgments of [...] "generations of muhaddithin" [...] (hadith scholars), Maududi believed in his intuition, and that [...] "with extensive study and practice one can develop a power and can intuitively sense the wishes and desires of the Holy Prophet ... Thus ... on seeing a Hadith, I can tell whether the Holy Prophet could or could <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hagel faced sharp {{questioning}} from Republicans. Senator John McCain berated him {{for refusing}} to give {{a yes or no}} {{answer to the question of}} whether the Iraq War troop surge of 2007 was a success. Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina demanded he [...] "name one dumb thing we've been goaded into doing because of the pressure from the Israeli or Jewish lobby." [...] Hagel stated [...] "I've already said I regret referencing the Jewish lobby, I should have said, 'pro-Israel lobby. ... The use of 'intimidation'—I should have used 'influence.' I think that would have been more appropriate. I should <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> 'dumb' or 'stupid,' because I understand or appreciate there are other views on these things.". Senator Ted Cruz played video excerpts from a 2009 Al Jazeera interview, and asserted that Hagel had agreed with a caller who suggested that Israel had committed war crimes. Hagel denied he agreed with that view. After the hearing, Senator Cruz organized a letter from 25 Republican Senators saying they would not vote until Hagel gave them copies of speeches given to organizations and told them the amount he was paid and whether the organizations received money from foreign sources. Lindsey Graham said they wanted to know if he spoke for any [...] "anti-Israel" [...] groups. Senate Committee chair Carl Levin said the demands were unprecedented, asking [...] "for information no prior nominee has been asked for," [...] and expressed confidence Hagel would be approved by the Senate.|$|E
60|$|Oh, I'd give {{everything}} <b>not</b> to <b>have</b> <b>said</b> what I did. I'd {{always held}} myself in before, but yesterday--I couldn't.|$|R
6000|$|... "But, Katharine, you ARE in love!" [...] {{at which}} Katharine flushed, looked startled, {{as if she}} <b>had</b> <b>said</b> {{something}} that she ought <b>not</b> to <b>have</b> <b>said,</b> and shook her head.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{very good}} of you <b>not</b> to <b>have</b> <b>said</b> {{anything}} disagreeable to me, Philip. I thought you might say I didn't know what all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Two pair of horses! It's {{more than}} we ought to keep." [...] He should <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> [...] "we." [...] He felt, when it was too late, that he should <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> [...] "we." ...|$|E
60|$|Almayer shivered slightly. She could <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> a more cruel thing.|$|E
60|$|V. [After much hesitation.] I could <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> this; {{it is an}} absurdity.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{drive me}} to say so, as {{otherwise}} I should be a hypocrite. Of course I ought <b>not</b> to <b>have</b> <b>said</b> it before Mr. Dalrymple." ...|$|R
6000|$|Percy {{put his arm}} round him, and his sigh or {{movement}} surprised Johnnie, who uneasily {{looked at}} his aunt. 'Ought I <b>not</b> to <b>have</b> <b>said</b> it?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{seems so}} odd {{to me to}} be here again," [...] he said. It was odd;--she felt that it was odd. But he ought <b>not</b> to <b>have</b> <b>said</b> so.|$|R
60|$|Stanley nodded. In truth, he {{had noticed}} something, though what he could <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>said.</b>|$|E
60|$|She could <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> why, but {{she felt}} a certain relief on hearing this.|$|E
60|$|Arthur for {{his life}} could <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> with {{confidence}} whether Pancks really thought so or not.|$|E
6000|$|I {{think the}} room swam round with her. When it was steady again, [...] "You {{did not say}} that, did you?" [...] she asked. She was sure he <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>said</b> it. She was smiling again tremulously to show him that he <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>said</b> it.|$|R
5000|$|Folds, Sledge, and Jessee {{were known}} to have fun during {{interviews}} and often give false, misleading or intentionally humorous answers to questions. True or <b>not,</b> Folds <b>has</b> <b>said</b> that Uncle Walter ...|$|R
6000|$|He <b>had</b> <b>not</b> once <b>said</b> that {{he could}} give it up. The words would not pass his lips, though he knew she must be {{conscious}} that he <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>said</b> them, must be longing to hear them. All {{he had been able}} to say was: ...|$|R
60|$|Jolyon {{could only}} shrug his shoulders. His reason agreed, his {{instinct}} rebelled; he could <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> why.|$|E
60|$|He had preached for an hour--longer, perhaps. Alison could <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> how long. She {{had lost}} all sense of time.|$|E
60|$|His voice {{made her}} start. He had spoken quietly, {{but there was}} a new note in it, strange to her. Just as she could <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> what it was that had {{happened}} to her, so now she could <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> what had happened to Tom. He, too, had changed, but how she did not know. Yet the explanation was simple. He also had, in a sense, grown up. He was no longer afraid of her.|$|E
60|$|BRODIE. She <b>has</b> <b>not</b> spoken; I <b>have</b> <b>said</b> nothing; and I believe I {{asked you}} to avoid the subject.|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>said</b> it, I <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>said</b> it; and if Master Cap {{is ready}} to testify to the fact, {{unlikely}} as it seems, I am willing to try to think it true. I think it every man's duty {{to believe in the}} power of God, however difficult it may be." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Certainly we are,' she said, frankly. Ned's manner {{had indeed}} puzzled her; {{he had always}} chatted {{to her as a}} friend: he had, as she <b>had</b> <b>said,</b> never once paid her a {{compliment}} or said a word that might <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been <b>said</b> <b>had</b> there been other men standing beside him at the bar.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, no; I should <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> rank. You cannot lose that;--but your {{station in}} the world, the respect of all around you, the--the--the--" ...|$|E
60|$|It was not that, but {{something}} in the gentleman himself--Florence could <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> what--that made her recoil {{as if she had}} been stung.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{dare say}} not, Mr. Staveley; {{but you need}} <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> so to me," [...] said Sophia, pretending to take him {{literally}} at his word.|$|E
6000|$|... 'You can inform Baron Straubenthal that I {{have come}} eight hundred leagues to see him, and that I {{will not leave}} until I <b>have</b> done so,' <b>said</b> my companion. I could <b>not</b> myself <b>have</b> <b>said</b> it with a better voice and manner.|$|R
6000|$|... "You would <b>not</b> <b>have</b> it <b>said</b> that I gave a {{challenge}} and let another carry it out?" [...] whispered Jim. [...] "This is my one chance. For Heaven's sake don't stand in my way." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Miss Walters, that is {{not quite}} true. I ought <b>not</b> to <b>have</b> <b>said</b> it to friends so kind as you have all shown yourselves to be. No; my real reason was that I {{did not wish to}} grieve you unnecessarily, and even now I would <b>not</b> <b>have</b> done so, only----" ...|$|R
