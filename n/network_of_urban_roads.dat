40|$|AbstractPavements {{are major}} assets of highway infrastructure. Maintenance and {{rehabilitation}} of these pavements {{to the desired}} level of serviceability {{is one of the}} challenging problems faced by pavement engineers and administration in the highway sector. The evaluation of pavement performance using pavement condition indicators is a basic component of any Pavement Management System. Various indicators like Pavement Condition Index (PCI), Present Serviceability Rating (PSR), Roughness Index (RI), etc. have been commonly used to assign a maintenance strategy for the existing pavements. The present paper is an effort in the similar direction, to develop a combined Overall Pavement Condition Index (OPCI) for the selected <b>network</b> <b>of</b> Noida <b>urban</b> <b>roads.</b> The study area consists <b>of</b> 10 <b>urban</b> <b>road</b> sections constituting 29. 92 km of Noida city. The methodology includes identification <b>of</b> <b>urban</b> <b>road</b> sections, pavement distress data collection, development of individual distress index and finally developing a combined OPCI for the network. The four performance indices viz. Pavement Condition Distress Index (PCIDistress), Pavement Condition Roughness Index (PCIRoughness), Pavement Condition Structural Capacity Index (PCIStructure) and Pavement Condition Skid Resistance Index (PCISkid) are developed individually. Then all these indices are combined together to form an OPCI giving importance of each indicator. The proposed index {{is expected to be a}} good indicative of pavement condition and performance.

40|$|In India {{the nature}} of overlay {{treatment}} {{in the name of}} maintenance on flexible pavements is generally Hot Mix Asphalt (HMA) as this technology is in for many years. Lack of interest in selecting different resurfacing alternative is seen in road contractors because of ease in construction of HMA overlay and experience gained by them in construction of HMA overlay. Whitetopping can be a very interesting resurfacing technique for existing asphalt pavements when rutting is the major distress on pavement surface. In the present work an attempt is made to evaluate the structural and functional condition of existing flexible pavements and provide a cost effective rehabilitation solution. A <b>network</b> <b>of</b> six <b>urban</b> <b>roads</b> coming under Tumkur Municipality is selected an extensive field, laboratory investigation, pavement analysis and design of rehabilitation alternative has been carried out. The field work consists of road inventory, traffic studies, MERLIN and BBD studies. PCI is computed based on selected distress parameters (Rut, Patch, Pothole, Cracks). In addition, IRI, BI and characteristics pavement deflections are computed from MERLIN and BBD surveys. Based on PCI, IRI, BI and deflection values pavement rehabilitation measures are considered. The summary of overall condition assessment on functional and structural evaluation in majority of the cases has resulted in ‘resurfacing’. In the present study an attempt has been made to design whitetopping section and asphalt overlay as a minor rehabilitation alternative for the in-service flexible pavements. The whitetopping design has resulted in 5 thin whitetopping sections and 1 ultra-thin whitetopping section. Strengthening by asphalt overlay has resulted in different overlay thicknesses for selected roads. Finally cost comparison between whitetopping and asphal...|$|R
40|$|While most {{motorways}} in Queensland {{are divided}} {{with at least}} two lanes in each direction, a few motorways have been constructed as two lane, two way roads. These "half motorways" have been designed and constructed with the intent of eventual duplication to divided carriageways. This type of roadway is similar to a two lane, two way highway constructed to a high standard. Motorways are critical elements of urban freight networks. There is a growing need from the freight industry to allow multi-combination vehicles to use a larger <b>network</b> <b>of</b> <b>urban</b> <b>roads.</b> This raises concerns regarding the psychological impacts on drivers of surrounding vehicles, and their behaviour around the MCVs. Lennie and Bunker (2004) studied some behavioural characteristics of passenger car drivers surrounding MCVs on a four lane, divided motorway. However, drivers are expected to behave differently while opposing each other on an undivided two lane, two way motorway or highway. That study was extended here to examine driver behaviour on the Port of Brisbane Motorway, which is a "half motorway". Specifically, the following were examined: Lateral position distribution for passenger cars, semi-trailers and B-doubles (23 m or longer); and lateral separation distribution of passenger cars from heavy vehicles and other passenger cars. The study showed that a maximum 7 s time gap between opposing vehicles influenced drivers’ positioning of their vehicles. It was shown that the lateral positions of cars, utility vehicles, and semi-trailers are statistically different when opposed than when unopposed; whereas, the lateral positions of B-doubles were not. This indicates that B-double drivers did not tend to move laterally when opposed by oncoming traffic. On average, passenger car drivers did not position their vehicles appreciably differently when opposed by semi-trailers and B-doubles than other passenger cars, and there was no appreciable difference in passenger car drivers’ positions when faced by oncoming semi-trailers than B-doubles. Average and 95 th percentile envelopes were provided to indicate position in the lane of unopposed and opposed vehicles on this type of roadway section. The off-side edge of the 95 th percentile passenger car straddled the edge line, while both the 95 th percentile semi-trailer and B-double occupied part of the wide, sealed shoulder. The semi-trailer wandered further onto the shoulder. The vehicle envelopes are useful to understand the impacts of heavy vehicles on driver behaviour, and can also inform road design and pavement asset management...|$|E

40|$|Traffic {{characteristics}} of a roadway are influenced by various factors like surface type, shoulder and roadway width, terrain, driver skills, side friction or side activities, road maintenance, etc. However for <b>urban</b> <b>roads,</b> the impact <b>of</b> side frictions i. e. bus stops, encroachments, on-street parking, etc. is much significant than any other factor. The extent of on-street parking and encroachment is generally high in developing countries where many activities often {{take place at the}} edge <b>of</b> <b>urban</b> <b>roads.</b> Their impact on traffic characteristics can be minimized by imposing few restrictions. Conversely bus stops are to be constructed by the authorities at different locations near or at the edge <b>of</b> <b>urban</b> <b>roads.</b> Bus stops are the designated places where passengers board and alight public transport buses. Different types of bus stops like curbside stops, bus bays, queue jumpers and nubs have significant effect on traffic flow.

Therefore, pursuing analysis based {{on the distribution of}} node degrees e.g. scale free aspect could not be accomplished in <b>urban</b> <b>road</b> networks. We have inspected the distribution of degree, betweenness centrality, weighted degree (based on incident link capacities), and alpha weighted degree for eight <b>urban</b> <b>road</b> networks across the world. These networks are abstracted from Philadelphia (USA), Berlin (Germany), Chicago (USA), Anaheim (USA), Gold Coast (Australia), Birmingham (UK), and Isfahan (Iran). Our results show that although the degree (weighted and unweighted) distributions <b>of</b> these <b>networks</b> are totally different, they all show power law distributions in betweenness centrality. Thus, scale free aspect could be observed in the betweenness centrality distribution. We then analyzed the collapse <b>of</b> <b>network</b> as a result of node removals. The collapse patterns suggest that critical nodes <b>of</b> <b>urban</b> <b>road</b> <b>networks</b> could not be detected solely based on betweenness centrality. Therefore, we conclude that the concept of betweenness centrality in <b>urban</b> <b>road</b> <b>networks</b> is more <b>of</b> functional merit than topological merit.
