25|$|Blix's {{statements}} about the Iraq WMD program came to contradict {{the claims of the}} George W.

In an interview on BBC 1 on 8 February 2004, Blix accused the US and British governments of dramatizing the threat <b>of</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> destruction in Iraq, in order to strengthen the case for the 2003 war against the government of Saddam Hussein. Ultimately, <b>no</b> stockpiles <b>of</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> destruction were ever found.|$|R
2500|$|The Iraq war was {{expensive}} {{and continues to}} be a severe drain on U.S. finances. Bacevich thinks the U.S. has a tendency to resort to military means to try to solve diplomatic problems. The U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War was a costly, decade-long military engagement which ended in a military victory but strategic defeat due to the public's loss of support for the war, {{due in large part to}} media sensation. The dollar cost was $111 billion, or $698 billion in 2009 dollars. Similarly, the second Iraq war was viewed by many [...] as being a mistake, since there were <b>no</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> <b>destruction</b> found, the war ended in December 2011.|$|E
2500|$|In March 2003, the U.S. invades Iraq {{and the war}} {{appears to}} be a success, and Bush gives his [...] "Mission Accomplished" [...] speech on an {{aircraft}} carrier. When it becomes clear that there are <b>no</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> <b>destruction</b> within Iraq, Bush learns that the responsibility for finding them had been relegated far down the chain of command. Bush discovers that Saddam gambled his regime and his life on the assumption that Bush was bluffing. Bush is asked in a White House press conference what mistakes he made as President, a question that leaves him flustered and speechless. That night, Bush has a nightmare in which his father accuses him of ruining his family's legacy, which the elder Bush claims was intended for Jeb. Bush dreams of himself [...] playing center field at a baseball game. Bush attempts to catch a pop fly, but it disappears.|$|E

[...] Blair said that British and American attitude towards Saddam Hussein had [...] "changed dramatically" [...] after the 11 September attacks. Blair denied {{that he would have}} supported the invasion of Iraq even if he had thought Saddam had <b>no</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> <b>destruction.</b> He said he believed the world was safer {{as a result of the}} invasion. He said there was [...] "no real difference between wanting regime change and wanting Iraq to disarm: regime change was US policy because Iraq was in breach of its UN obligations." [...] In an October 2015 CNN interview with Fareed Zakaria, Blair apologised for his [...] "mistakes" [...] over Iraq War and admitted there were [...] "elements of truth" [...] to the view that the invasion helped promote the rise of ISIS. The Chilcot Inquiry report of 2016 gave a damning assessment of Blair's role in the Iraq War, though the former prime minister again refused to apologise for his decision to back the US-led invasion.|$|E
5000|$|After fellow {{military}} historian Sir John Keegan {{demanded to}} know why those who opposed the Iraq War wanted Saddam Hussein to remain in power, Barnett replied that [...] "America, Britain, the Middle East and the wider world would be vastly better off in terms of peace and stability if Saddam were still gripping Iraq, and we were still gripping Saddam as we had been from 1991 to 2003". He explained that {{the condition of the}} Iraqi people under Saddam Hussein [...] "is of no relevance" [...] to non-Iraqis; secondly, he argued that Saddam Hussein [...] "had presented no international danger since he was soundly beaten in the 1991 Gulf war. He possessed <b>no</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> destruction...and he was subject to close Anglo-American surveillance of the [...] "no-fly zone""; thirdly, [...] "Saddam had provided a highly competent ally, if a tacit one, in the so-called [...] "war against global terror"" [...] due to his opposition to Al-Qaeda.|$|R
2500|$|When {{you ask the}} question, [...] "Does Iraq possess militarily viable {{biological}} or chemical weapons?" [...] the answer is [...] "NO!" [...] It is a resounding [...] "NO".

5000|$|According to {{political}} scientist John J. Mearsheimer, in Why Leaders Lie, during peaceful times, inter-state communications of deceptions have little traction as {{the level of}} trust between states is usually already very low and therefore being caught in a lie would be ruinous, while on the other hand, leaders in democracies transcend up the ranks largely through employing political deception and thus are not only familiar with deceiving the public for personal gain but who have considerable political capital and trust built up following their election. With this comparatively high level of trust, democratic leaders are the most likely to successfully target the public with deceptions, particularly with fearmongering. Moersheimer uses the following example to convey the abstraction, that of Saddam Hussein who, while a malevolent dictator, had not lied to the world about having <b>no</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> destruction(WMD). Yet western democracies headed by George Bush and Tony Blair had succeeded in instilling enough fear, uncertainty and doubt in the media and general populace to convince most that Hussein was duplicitous and did in fact have these [...] "WMDs". Following this successful deception, the two democratic leaders were effective in launching the Iraq war with little opposition.|$|R

5000|$|Dawkins {{was very}} {{critical}} of the United States government under George W. Bush, especially his Iraq War decisions. He criticized Bush by stating that [...] "George W. Bush says that God told him to invade Iraq (a pity God didn't vouchsafe him a revelation that there were <b>no</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> destruction)." [...] Dawkins has {{also said that he}} thinks American politicians should pay more attention to America's secular crowd. [...] "I think that may be a lesson politicians need to learn, that they don't only need to suck up to the Catholic lobby and the Jewish lobby and Islam, that lobby. Maybe the nonbelievers lobby is a lot more powerful than they realize." [...] Also, Dawkins thinks that U.S. politicians should not invoke religion in their policies. [...] "Politicians shouldn't be promoting religion as part of their government legislation." [...] Dawkins has also expressed his belief that Bush was not actually elected in the controversial 2000 U.S. presidential election through an editorial in The Guardian: September 11 was your golden Pearl Harbor. This was how you'd get elected in 2004 (not re-elected, elected). You would announce a War on Terror. American troops would win. And you would be the victorious warlord, swaggering in a flight suit before a Mission Accomplished banner. It worked in Afghanistan.

It is 'no' across the board. So from a qualitative standpoint, Iraq has been disarmed. Ritter later accused some UNSCOM personnel of spying, and he strongly criticized the Bill Clinton administration for misusing the commission's resources to eavesdrop on the Iraqi military.

25|$|In a January 2003 CBS poll, 64% of Americans had {{approved}} {{of military action}} against Iraq; however, 63% wanted Bush to find a diplomatic solution rather than go to war, and 62% believed {{the threat of terrorism}} directed against the U.S. would increase due to war. The invasion of Iraq was strongly opposed by some long-standing U.S. allies, including the governments of France, Germany, and New Zealand. Their leaders argued that there was <b>no</b> evidence <b>of</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> destruction in Iraq and that invading the country was not justified in the context of UNMOVIC's 12 February 2003 report. On 15 February 2003, a month before the invasion, there were worldwide protests against the Iraq War, including a rally of three million people in Rome, which is listed in the Guinness Book of Records as the largest ever anti-war rally. According to the French academic Dominique Reynié, between 3 January and 12 April 2003, 36 million people across the globe took part in almost 3,000 protests against the Iraq war.|$|R

The book also contends that the Central Intelligence Agency resettled Habbush, paid him $5 million, and forged a document in his name alleging that 9/11 hijacker Mohammad Atta trained in Iraq.|$|E
50|$|At the Beginning of 2006 Drumheller {{claimed the}} CIA had {{credible}} sources discounting some <b>weapon</b> <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> destruction claims {{made during the}} Iraq disarmament crisis before the 2003 Invasion of Iraq. According to Drumheller the Bush administration dismissed CIA information which reported Saddam Hussein had no WMD program and used whatever information it could find to justify an invasion of Iraq. The CIA, brokered by the French intelligence service, recruited Iraqi Foreign Minister Naji Sabri in Europe during the late summer of 2002. Sabri told the CIA in September that Saddam had <b>no</b> major active <b>weapons</b> <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> destruction programs; they had no fissile material and biological weapons were almost non-existent, although he claimed that there were chemical weapons. This information was then transmitted to the White House, but it was ignored {{in favor of the}} information acquired by Germany's intelligence service Bundesnachrichtendienst (BND) coming from a source known as Curveball.|$|R
50|$|In late 2002 Saddam Hussein, in {{a letter}} to Hans Blix, invited UN weapons {{inspectors}} back into the country. Subsequently the Security Council issued resolution 1441 authorizing new inspections in Iraq. The carefully worded UN resolution put the burden on Iraq, not UN inspectors, to prove that they <b>no</b> longer had <b>weapons</b> <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> destruction. The United States claimed that Iraq's latest weapons declaration left materials and munitions unaccounted for; the Iraqis claimed that all such material had been destroyed, something which had been stated years earlier by Iraq's highest ranking defector, Hussein Kamel al-Majid. According to reports from the previous UN inspection agency, UNSCOM, Iraq produced 600 metric tons of chemical agents, including mustard gas, VX and sarin, and nearly 25,000 rockets and 15,000 artillery shells, with chemical agents, that are still unaccounted for.|$|R
5000|$|Following the invasion, <b>no</b> {{stockpiles}} <b>of</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>of</b> <b>mass</b> destruction were found, although about 500 abandoned chemical munitions, mostly degraded, remaining from Iraq's Iran-Iraq war, {{were collected}} from around the country. The Kelly Affair highlighted a possible attempt by the British government to cover-up fabrications in British intelligence, the exposure of which would have undermined the Prime Minister's original rationale for involvement in the war. The U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence found no substantial evidence for reputed links between Iraq and Al-Qaeda. President George W. Bush has since admitted that [...] "much of the intelligence {{turned out to be}} wrong". Although evidence of WMD was searched for by the Iraq Survey Group, their final report of September 2004 stated, [...] "While a small number of old, abandoned chemical munitions have been discovered, ISG judges that Iraq unilaterally destroyed its undeclared chemical weapons stockpile in 1991. There are no credible indications that Baghdad resumed production of chemical munitions thereafter, a policy ISG attributes to Baghdad's desire to see sanctions lifted, or rendered ineffectual, or its fear of force against it should WMD be discovered." [...] In the March 2005 Addendum to the Report, the Special Advisor furthermore went on to state that [...] "ISG assesses that Iraq and Coalition Forces will continue to discover small numbers ofdegraded chemical weapons, which the former Regime mislaid or improperly destroyed prior to 1991. ISG believes the bulk <b>of</b> these <b>weapons</b> were likely abandoned, forgotten and lost during the Iran-Iraq war because tens of thousands of CW munitions were forward deployed along frequently and rapidly shifting battlefronts." [...] (For comparison, the U.S. Department of Defense itself was famously unable in 1998 to report the whereabouts of [...] "56 airplanes, 32 tanks and 36 Javelin command launch units".) ISG also believed that Saddam did not want to verifiably disarm Iraq of WMD, as required by U.N. resolutions, for fear of looking weak to his enemies.|$|R
