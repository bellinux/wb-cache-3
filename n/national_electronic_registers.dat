Statistical analysis was performed using PASW 19.0 (IBM SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). The incidence figures were, thus, the true results concerning the entire adolescent population in Finland, rather than cohort-based estimates during the study period, and, therefore, 95  % confidence intervals were not calculated.|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Monitoring of {{vaccination}} coverage {{is vital for}} the prevention and control of vaccine-preventable diseases. <b>Electronic</b> immunization <b>registers</b> have been increasingly adopted {{to assist with the}} monitoring of vaccine coverage; however, there is limited literature about the use of <b>electronic</b> <b>registers</b> in low- and middle-income countries such as Mongolia. We aimed to determine the accuracy and completeness of the newly introduced <b>electronic</b> immunization <b>register</b> for calculating {{vaccination coverage}} and determining vaccine effectiveness within two districts in Mongolia in comparison to written health provider records. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional record review among children 2 – 23 months of age vaccinated at immunization clinics within the two districts. We linked data from written records with the <b>electronic</b> immunization <b>register</b> using the national identification number to determine the completeness and accuracy of the <b>electronic</b> <b>register.</b> Results: Both completeness (90. 9...|$|R

40|$|Before the 1970 s, {{registers}} {{were primarily}} used for individual reference, for which purpose paper registers are quite adequate. The first <b>electronic</b> <b>registers</b> rationalised {{the collection and}} availability of information and improved the possibilities of collecting statistics. In the 1970 s, advanced statistics and prognoses were prerequisites for centralised social planning. From 1979 onwards, law regulated the use of <b>electronic</b> <b>registers.</b> This prevented the misuse of personal information concerning individuals. In the 1980 s, processes and results {{that had previously been}} viewed as immeasurable, became better defined and were becoming measurable. At the same time as <b>electronic</b> <b>registers</b> were adapting to their new functions, they were still being used for individual references. The study includes four case studies, each illustrating distinctive features in the history of <b>electronic</b> <b>registers.</b> With the registration of university students’ examinations, the Ministry was able to build up a result-orientated basis for the distribution of funds to the university, that is, the new register met new political needs. Establishing the Central Civil Registration meant that every citizen was given his/her own number which was used as an identi­fier in any state register concerning the citizens. Hence, pieces of information in different <b>electronic</b> <b>registers</b> could be combined. The <b>Electronic</b> Aliens <b>Register</b> replaced a huge paper register and made access to the register much easier for regional and state authorities than it had been previously. And finally, municipal autonomy made it difficult to establish the National Patient Registry. Local registers that referred to common guidelines had to be accepted in order for the registry to become functional...|$|R

5000|$|Details of the NCHRH council bill:(0ld 0ne)There {{shall be}} {{established}} seven administrative departments under the Council forregulation of each category of health professionals: [...] a) Department of Medicine; b) Department of Nursing; c) Department of Dentistry; d) Department of Pharmacy; e) Department of Rehabilitation and Physiotherapy; f) Department of Public Health and Hospital Management; and g) Department of Allied Health Sciences The draft bill, which was finalised by the union health ministry, {{for the establishment}} of the NCHRH as an overarching regulatory body for health and allied sectors, has received the approval from the PMO. Now that it has received the PMO approval, it will be put up before the Union Cabinet and will finally be introduced in Parliament for its final nod, sources said. The NCHRH is proposed to be established by the health ministry as an overarching regulatory authority in the country to reform the current regulatory framework in medical education and enhance the supply of skilled personnel to the healthcare sector in the country. Once in place, the NCHRH will be the overarching regulatory body for all the premier medical educational institutions and autonomous regulatory bodies like Medical Council of India (MCI), Pharmacy Council of India (PCI), Nursing Council of India (NCI), Dental Council of India (DCI) and the proposed Central Councils for Paramedical and Allied Medical Sciences Education. It will prescribe standards with a view to have proper planning and co-coordinated development of medical and allied health education throughout the country and maintain <b>national</b> live <b>electronic</b> <b>register</b> of medical and allied health professionals. The expert group of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and the task force of the Ministry of Human Resource Development (HRD) broadly agreed to settle their turf war over the jurisdiction of medical education. The National Commission for Human Resources in Health (NCHRH) will get tolay down the minimum standards of medical education, while all health-related research will comeunder the purview of the National Commission for Higher Education and Research (NCHER), promoted by the HRD Ministry. The NCHRH and the NCHER draft Bills — proposed as regulatory bodies — have been pending for the past several months as the two ministries were involved in a tussle over the jurisdiction of medical education As per the draft bill, the administration of the Council will consist of a Secretariat headed by a Secretary-General who will be appointed by the Council for a fixed term of three years. Under this secretariat, seven departments, each for separate categories like Medicine, Pharmacy, Nursing, Dentistry, Rehabilitation & Physiotherapy, Public Health & Hospital Management and Allied Health Sciences, will be established and headed by a director for regulatory purposes. In every state, there will be separate bodies constituted by the Council for each administrative department which will be known as Registration and Ethics Board with name of the state in front and the department's name in the end. These bodies will replace the existing State Councils. These boards have to maintain a live <b>electronic</b> <b>register</b> of professionals {{in the state of the}} respective Department to be known as 'State Register of (name of the Department) and which will be linked to the National Register of Human Resources in Health maintained by the Council. Each Board will comprise a president, a vice-president and not less than 10 members out of which three will be women candidates. There will be a nominee of the state government also.|$|R
