"Young as he was, the lad found {{a chance}} to ship as master's mate on the sloop Hornet, William Stone commandin', an' in one day, so it's said, he, carryin' a flag an' with a drummer an' two fifers, enlisted a full crew for the Hornet, all from Baltimore, which {{goes to show that}} the people there thought he {{amounted}} to somethin'. Barney sailed in Hopkins' fleet to the Bahamas, where the town of New Providence was taken, an' the commodore scooped in all the ammunition to be found on the island. A little while after that, he shipped on the schooner Wasp, which convoyed off the coast the vessel in which Benjamin Franklin was goin' to Europe to help pull this country through, an' when they came back into the Cape May channel they found the king's ships Roebuck an' Liverpool--one of forty-four guns an' the other of twenty-eight--waitin' for 'em. There was lively times for a spell, until the Wasp contrived to slip into Wilmington creek, where she laid till half a dozen row galleys came down from Philadelphia to attack the British ships. Then the schooner came out, an' while the fightin' was goin' on, captured the brig Tender, one of his majesty's armed vessels what poked her <b>nose</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> help the big fellows. They say Barney fought like a tiger, an' with his captain wounded, brought the little schooner an' her prize through the fog into port.|$|E
6000|$|HER HUSBAND. What is Mrs Bompas to you, I'd like to know. I'll {{tell you}} what Mrs Bompas is. She's the smartest woman in the smartest set in South Kensington, and the handsomest, and the cleverest, and the most {{fetching}} to experienced men who know a good thing when they see it, whatever she may be to conceited penny-a-lining puppies who think nothing good enough for them. It's admitted by the best people; and not to know it argues yourself unknown. Three of our first actor-managers have offered her a hundred a week if she'd go on the stage when they start a repertory theatre; and I think they know what they're {{about as well as}} you. The only member of the present Cabinet that you might call a handsome man has neglected the business of the country to dance with her, though he don't belong to our set as a regular thing. One of the first professional poets in Bedford Park wrote a sonnet to her, worth all your amateur trash. At Ascot last season the eldest son of a duke excused himself from calling on me on the ground that his feelings for Mrs Bompas were not consistent with his duty to me as host; and it did him honor and me too. But [with gathering fury] she isn't good enough for you, it seems. You regard her with coldness, with indifference; and you have the cool cheek to tell me so to my face. For two pins I'd flatten your <b>nose</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> teach you manners. Introducing a fine woman to you is casting pearls before swine [yelling at him] before SWINE! d'ye hear? ...|$|E

It is the only bus station on the island that is completely to this design. Buses enter the station from the eastbound side of the esplanade, and the bus stands are in front of them. On the left are two spaces where buses reverse in to lay over between duties. There are eight stands, lettered A—H. In front of the stands is a sheltered waiting area. On the left, it is large and houses {{the entrance to the}} railway station, with bus information available in racks and displayed on the walls. The roof gets smaller the further along {{to the right of the}} bus station it goes, and there is no roof for the last couple of stands (G and H).|$|E

40|$|We {{have shown}} {{previously}} that oesophageal acid stimulation can reduce coronary blood flow in syndrome X patients suggesting {{the presence of}} a cardio-oesophageal reflex in humans. The presence of such a reflex in patients with coronary artery disease could explain the mechanism of “linked angina”. To investigate this hypothesis we studied the effect of oesophageal acid stimulation on coronary blood flow in 14 patients with angiographically documented significant (> 50 % stenosis) coronary artery disease (CAD) and 18 heart transplant patients (HT). A fine tube was introduced through the patient's <b>nose</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> the distal oesophagus. A 3. 6 F intracoronary Doppler catheter was positioned in the proximal left anterior descending coronary artery. Coronary blood flow was calculated from measurements of coronary flow velocities and arterial cross-sectional area from quantitative angiography. Oesophageal instillation of 0. 1 M hydrochloric acid and 0. 9 % saline was performed in random, double-blind fashion (60 ml over 5 minutes) and the measurements were repeated after each infusion. Nine patients in the CAD group reported their usual chest pain on acid instillation but none experienced any pain after saline infusion. None of the patients in the HT group experienced any chest pain on acid or saline infusion. There were no significant difference in systemic haemodynamics after the infusions in both groups. The coronary blood flow (CBF) was significantly reduced by acid oesophageal stimulation in the CAD group [CBF pre-acid 70. 4 ± 14. 3, CBF post-acid 46. 4 ± 19. 1 ml/min (p < 0. 01) ]. However, {{there was no significant difference}} in the CBF on saline infusion [73. 5 ± 15. 3 versus 72. 5 ± 14 ml/min]. CBF in the HT group was unaffected by acid or saline infusion. In the 9 CAD patients who experienced angina on oesophageal acid infusion there was a significant reduction in CBF from 73. 4 ± 12. 9 to 34. 6 ± 4. 7 ml/min. However, in the 5 CAD patients who did not have any chest pain the CBF was unaffected by acid infusion [65. 1 ± 16. 7 versus 67. 5 ± 16. 7 ml/min]. ConclusionOesophageal acid stimulation can produce angina and significantly reduce coronary blood flow. The lack of any significant effect in the HT group, in whom the heart is denervated, suggests a neural reflex. The presence of such a reflex may be a mechanism for “Linked Angina” in patients with coronary artery disease...|$|E

50|$|The great speed {{required}} for supercavitation to {{work can be}} achieved temporarily by a projectile fired under water or by an airborne projectile impacting the water. Rocket propulsion {{can be used for}} sustained operation, with the possibility of tapping high pressure gas to route <b>to</b> the object's <b>nose</b> <b>in</b> order <b>to</b> enhance the cavitation bubble. An example of rocket propulsion is the Russian VA-111 Shkval supercavitating torpedo. In principle, maneuvering may be achieved by various means such as drag fins that project through the bubble into the surrounding liquid (p. 22), by tilting the nose of the object, by injecting gas asymmetrically near the <b>nose</b> <b>in</b> order <b>to</b> distort the geometry of the cavity, by vectoring rocket thrust through gimbaling for a single nozzle, or by differential thrust for multiple nozzles.|$|R
