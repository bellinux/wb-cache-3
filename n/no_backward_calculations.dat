30|$|To {{validate}} the developed model with experimental data, three test wells from a {{gas condensate reservoir}} mentioned in “Field data” are selected. One of them is chosen as target well that its composition is fed to the model while experimental data of two others are used to {{validate the}} outputs of model. Figure  5 presents a simple schematic of reservoir location. Well no. 1 is target well and Well nos. 2 and 3 are selected for experimental data. Average porosity of 0.03 and average permeability of 15 md are considered for this section of reservoir. Other details are illustrated in schematic figure. Experimental composition of methane is compared with {{the results from the}} two earlier mentioned models, i.e. developed model and Ghorayeb model. All three wells have almost same vertical positions with different horizontal locations to cover both forward and <b>backward</b> directions in <b>calculation.</b> It is indicated that for C 1 mole% in Well <b>no.</b> 2 (for <b>backward</b> <b>calculations),</b> absolute relative error of results from the developed model is about 0.28 % while it is about 0.4 % for Ghorayeb model. It is obvious that the proposed model has more reliable results than Ghorayeb model. These investigations are also repeated for Well no. 3 which covers forward prediction of compositional gradient and absolute relative errors are 0.32 % and 0.56 % for the proposed model and Ghorayeb model, respectively. Good agreement between field data and the results from developed model shows that in addition to having a reliable prediction from this model, the results could use to validate quality and correctness of PVT tests reported for the field of study.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{riparian}} zone, {{the last}} few metres of soil through which water flows before entering a gaining stream, {{has been identified as}} a first order control on key aspects of stream water chemistry dynamics. We propose that the dis-tribution of lateral flow of water across the vertical profile of soil water chemistry in the riparian zone provides a concep-tual explanation of how this control functions in catchments where matrix flow predominates. This paper presents a math-ematical implementation of this concept as well as the model assumptions. We also present an analytical solution, which provides a physical basis for the commonly used power-law flow-load equation. This approach quantifies the concept of riparian control on stream-water chemistry providing a ba-sis for testing the concept of riparian control.

The model is based on estimating the local elastic-plastic stress-strain situation in a notched but uncracked body, at the location point of the hypothetical crack tip. Then, a crack opening stress value is predicted for a crack in an unnotched body under the same stress-strain condition using Newman's prediction formulas. The corresponding opening load level for this crack-stress-strain configuration in the notched body is predicted with a <b>backward</b> <b>calculation,</b> using Neuber's-rule.
