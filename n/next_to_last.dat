5|$|A {{precocious}} student, Durkheim {{entered the}} École Normale Supérieure (ENS) in 1879, at his third attempt. The entering class that year {{was one of}} the most brilliant of the nineteenth century and many of his classmates, such as Jean Jaurès and Henri Bergson, would go on to become major figures in France's intellectual history. At the ENS, Durkheim studied under the direction of Numa Denis Fustel de Coulanges, a classicist with a social scientific outlook, and wrote his Latin dissertation on Montesquieu. At the same time, he read Auguste Comte and Herbert Spencer. Thus Durkheim became interested in a scientific approach to society very early on in his career. This meant the first of many conflicts with the French academic system, which had no social science curriculum at the time. Durkheim found humanistic studies uninteresting, turning his attention from psychology and philosophy to ethics and eventually, sociology. He obtained his agrégation in philosophy in 1882, though finishing <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>last</b> in his graduating class owing to serious illness the year before.|$|E
5|$|The impact Reeves had was immediate. As Bill Parcells {{had done}} before in 1984, Reeves named Phil Simms the {{starting}} quarterback and released Hostetler. They won their first three games, and five of their first six. The defense was back to its Parcells-era levels and allowed more than 20 points once all season. With two games to go, the Giants were 11–3 and battling for an Eastern Division crown and a first round bye. However, they were upset by Phoenix, 17–6, in the <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>last</b> week of the season, setting up a winner–take–all game against the Dallas Cowboys in the season finale. Though the Giants played well, it was Emmitt Smith's memorable performance with a separated shoulder that led the Cowboys to a 16–13 overtime win, giving the Cowboys a sweep of the season series. Despite the loss, the Giants made the playoffs as a Wild Card and won their first round game 17–10 over the Minnesota Vikings. However, they were then defeated by the San Francisco 49ers 44–3, in their worst performance {{of the season in}} the second round.|$|E

25|$|During the 1991–92 college {{basketball}} season, Troy State was playing its <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>last</b> {{year as an}} NCAA Division II school before transitioning to Division I. They were led by head coach Don Maestri, whose unconventional offense-oriented system led to incredibly high-scoring games; that season, Troy State led all of DivisionII with a 121.0 points per game scoring average (while also giving up 107.8 per game). They shot an NCAA-record 1,303 three-pointers in 1991–92 and connected on 444 of them. Maestri's philosophy was to unapologetically attempt steals on an opponent's every possession, and if they missed the steal, they allowed the opponent to score {{as long as they}} scored quickly. He substituted players regularly and knew that his track-meet-style of pressure would eventually wear out the other team. Once tired, his Troy State squads would continue to relentlessly pursue opponents on the defensive end; on offense, no shot was considered a bad shot and the quicker the attempt, the better. The high octane offense used by Troy State was modeled after Paul Westhead's Loyola Marymount teams of the era; Maestri even had Westhead mail him Loyola Marymount game tapes to study the plays and methods used by the successful DivisionI school.|$|E
500|$|As {{a result}} of the Canaanite shift, the Proto-Hebrew vowel system is reconstructed as [...] (and {{possibly}} rare [...] ). Furthermore, stress at this point appears to have shifted so that it was consistently on the penultimate (<b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>last)</b> syllable, and was still non-phonemic.
