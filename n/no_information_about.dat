5|$|After the United States {{declared}} war on Germany in April 1917, El Sol was requisitioned by the United States Shipping Board (USSB) {{on behalf of the}} United States Army, who designated her as an animal transport ship. Although there is <b>no</b> <b>information</b> <b>about</b> the specific conversion of El Sol, for other ships this typically meant that any second- or third-class passenger accommodations had to be ripped out and replaced with ramps and stalls for the horses and mules carried.|$|E
5|$|At {{some point}} after the United States {{declared}} war on Germany in April 1917, the United States Army chartered Kentuckian for transporting animals to Europe {{in support of the}} American Expeditionary Force. Although there is <b>no</b> <b>information</b> <b>about</b> the specific conversion of Kentuckian, for other ships this typically meant that any passenger accommodations had to be ripped out and replaced with ramps and stalls for the horses and mules carried.|$|E

5|$|Despite his rebellion, Salih paid formal {{allegiance}} to the Fatimid Caliphate after conquering Aleppo, and dispatched Ibn Tawq to meet az-Zahir in Cairo; in turn, az-Zahir officially recognized Salih's Mirdasid emirate and sent him numerous honorary robes and presents. There is <b>no</b> <b>information</b> <b>about</b> the Byzantines' relationship with Salih following the conquest of Aleppo, though Emperor Basil II refused to back Salih's rebellion when he appealed for Byzantine support.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to his usual practice elsewhere in the Historia ecclesiastica, Bede provides <b>no</b> <b>information</b> <b>about</b> his sources for the Cædmon story. Since a similar paucity of sources is also characteristic of other stories from Whitby Abbey in his work, this may indicate that his knowledge of Cædmon's life was based on tradition current at his home monastery in (relatively) nearby Wearmouth-Jarrow.|$|E
5|$|Basta's {{soldiers}} accompanied Sigismund to Tokaj. Before long, {{he went to}} Prague to beg for RudolphII's mercy. He {{received the}} incolatus (or the right to own lands in Bohemia) in 1604. After the Diet of Transylvania proclaimed Stephen Bocskai prince in February 1605, Rudolph tried to persuade Sigismund to return to Transylvania, {{but he did not}} accept the offer. The ambassadors of Venice and Spain and the emperor again tried to convince him to lay claim to Transylvania in July 1606, but Sigismund refused, saying that he had <b>no</b> <b>information</b> <b>about</b> the affairs of his former principality. In December he again met Rudolph in Prague, but still resisted the emperor's offer.|$|E

5|$|In July 2009, some of Twitter's {{revenue and}} user growth {{documents}} were published on TechCrunch after being illegally obtained by Hacker Croll. The documents projected 2009 revenues of US$400,000 {{in the third}} quarter and US$4million in the fourth quarter along with 25million users {{by the end of the}} year. The projections for the end of 2013 were US$1.54billion in revenue, US$111million in net earnings, and 1billion users. <b>No</b> <b>information</b> <b>about</b> how Twitter planned to achieve those numbers was published. In response, Twitter co-founder Biz Stone published a blog post suggesting the possibility of legal action against the hacker.|$|E
5|$|Later on, {{being told}} by his brother, Jerome, of some gossip overheard by a waiter between British {{officers}} at lunch at the 'King of Spain' inn in Genappe that the Prussians were to march over from Wavre, Napoleon declared that the Prussians would need at least two days to recover and would {{be dealt with by}} Grouchy. Surprisingly, Jerome's overheard gossip aside, the French commanders present at the pre-battle conference at Le Caillou had <b>no</b> <b>information</b> <b>about</b> the alarming proximity of the Prussians and did not suspect that Blücher's men would start erupting onto the field of battle in great numbers just five hours later.|$|E
5|$|Mating {{has been}} {{observed}} to {{take place at the}} end of the dry season, in early November, and births were inferred between late February and early March. Only one infant is born per season, despite females having two pairs of nipples. Infants are initially parked in unguarded tree holes while the mother forages. Older infants have not been observed clinging to the mother, and as they get older, they are parked in vegetation until they can move independently. Females produce milk for two years following the birth of the young. The offspring may remain under the care of their parents for three years or more, and there is <b>no</b> <b>information</b> <b>about</b> their dispersal at maturity. Females have not been observed giving birth in consecutive years.|$|E

5|$|The Allies {{received}} <b>no</b> <b>information</b> <b>about</b> {{the massacre}} until {{the summer of}} 1943, when Pooley, who {{had spent the last}} three years in a German hospital due to the injuries he had suffered in the massacre, was declared medically unfit and repatriated. British authorities did not believe Pooley's story on his arrival; it was not thought that the German army were capable of such atrocities against British troops. Private O'Callaghan did not return to the United Kingdom until 1945 after the liberation of his prisoner-of-war camp. His confirmation of Pooley's story prompted an official investigation.|$|E
5|$|The Sumatran rhino is {{a mostly}} solitary animal except for {{courtship}} and offspring-rearing. It {{is the most}} vocal rhino species and also communicates through marking soil with its feet, twisting saplings into patterns, and leaving excrement. The species is much better studied than the similarly reclusive Javan rhinoceros, {{in part because of}} a program that brought 40 Sumatran rhinos into captivity with the goal of preserving the species. There was little or <b>no</b> <b>information</b> <b>about</b> procedures that would assist in ex situ breeding. Though a number of rhinos died once at the various destinations and no offspring were produced for nearly 20 years, the rhinos were all doomed in their soon to be logged forest. In March 2016, a Sumatran rhinoceros was spotted in Indonesian Borneo.|$|E
5|$|Thereafter Asser {{seems to}} have divided his time between Wales and Alfred's court. Asser gives <b>no</b> <b>information</b> <b>about</b> his time in Wales, but {{mentions}} various places that he visited in England, including the battlefield at Ashdown, Cynuit (Countisbury), and Athelney. It is evident from Asser's account that he {{spent a good deal}} of time with Alfred: he recounts meeting Alfred's mother-in-law, Eadburh (who is not the same Eadburh who died as a beggar in Pavia), on many occasions; and says that he has often seen Alfred hunting.|$|E

5|$|Tucker {{entered the}} harbor at Espirtu Santo's western entrance, leading the cargo ship SSNira Luckenbach, unaware they had entered a {{minefield}} laid earlier by US Navy minelayers. After striking {{at least one}} mine, the destroyer was almost torn in two at the No.1 stack, killing {{all three of the}} crew in the forward fireroom. The rest of the crew survived but Tucker did not. The destroyer slowly settled in the water and sank. An investigation revealed that Tucker had been given <b>no</b> <b>information</b> <b>about</b> the existence of the minefield.|$|E
5|$|After the {{surprise}} death of Malamir in 836, the Bulgarian throne passed to Presian I (836–852), who too was likely underage. As {{evidenced by the}} Presian Inscription from Philippi, Isbul retained his position as kavhan and his decisive influence in the Bulgarian court. In 837, the Slavic tribe of the Smolyani (Smolenoi), who inhabited the lower Nestos (Mesta) River and Western Thrace near Drama, rose against their Byzantine rulers. The inscription of Philippi mentions large-scale Bulgarian activity in the lands of the Smolyani. The Bulgarian forces were led by Isbul, {{as well as the}} ichirgu-boil (commander of the capital garrison) and the head priest. As the inscription is damaged, it is unclear who Presian and Isbul supported in that conflict. However, during this campaign the Bulgarian army conquered most of Macedonia including Philippi, where the inscription was found. From that point on, Isbul disappears from the sources, and there is <b>no</b> <b>information</b> <b>about</b> the date and circumstances of his death.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} leg of the flight, at about 15:00, Keč, wearing a winter coat, got up from his seat and walked {{to the front of the}} aircraft. A flight {{attendant}} stopped him. After talking for a short while, and another flight attendant came by, he was let into the cockpit. <b>No</b> <b>information</b> <b>about</b> the hijacking was given to the passengers until arrival at Bodø. Bodø Airport was evacuated and the aircraft parked at Bodø Main Air Station, the military section. After landing, by order of the hijacker, the passengers were informed that all women, children under 18 and people over 60 were to leave the aircraft. After this had happened, there were 77 passengers and four crew members left. The aircraft departed Bodø at about 16:00 and headed for Oslo Airport, Gardermoen, which was closed for all other traffic.|$|E

5|$|Embryos {{produced}} {{using in}} vitro fertilization may be genetically tested for HD using preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD). This technique, where one or two cells are extracted from a typically 4- to 8-cell embryo and then tested for the genetic abnormality, can then be used to ensure embryos affected with HD genes are not implanted, and therefore any offspring will not inherit the disease. Some forms of preimplantation genetic diagnosis—non-disclosure or exclusion testing—allow at-risk people to have HD-free offspring without revealing their own parental genotype, giving <b>no</b> <b>information</b> <b>about</b> whether they themselves are destined to develop HD. In exclusion testing, the embryos' DNA is {{compared with that of}} the parents and grandparents to avoid inheritance of the chromosomal region containing the HD gene from the affected grandparent. In non-disclosure testing, only disease-free embryos are replaced in the uterus while the parental genotype and hence parental risk for HD are never disclosed.|$|E
5|$|Judging {{relationships}} {{based on}} shared characters requires care, since plants may resemble one another through convergent evolution in which characters have arisen independently. Some euphorbias have leafless, rounded bodies adapted to water conservation {{similar to those}} of globular cacti, but characters such as the structure of their flowers make it clear that the two groups are not closely related. The cladistic method takes a systematic approach to characters, distinguishing between those that carry <b>no</b> <b>information</b> <b>about</b> shared evolutionary history – such as those evolved separately in different groups (homoplasies) or those left over from ancestors (plesiomorphies) – and derived characters, which have been passed down from innovations in a shared ancestor (apomorphies). Only derived characters, such as the spine-producing areoles of cacti, provide evidence for descent from a common ancestor. The results of cladistic analyses are expressed as cladograms: tree-like diagrams showing the pattern of evolutionary branching and descent.|$|E
5|$|On rivers, actuariae {{could operate}} year-round, except during periods when the rivers were ice-bound or of high water (after heavy rains or thaw), when the river-current was dangerously strong. It {{is likely that}} the {{establishment}} of the empire's frontier on the Rhine-Danube line was dictated by the logistical need for large rivers to accommodate supply ships more than by defensibility. These rivers were dotted with purpose-built military docks (portus exceptionales). The protection of supply convoys on the rivers was the responsibility of the fluvial flotillas (classes) under the command of the riverine duces. The Notitia gives <b>no</b> <b>information</b> <b>about</b> the Rhine flotillas (as the Rhine frontier had collapsed by the time the Western section was compiled), but mentions 4 classes Histricae (Danube flotillas) and 8 other classes in tributaries of the Danube. Each flotilla was commanded by a praefectus classis who reported to the local dux. It appears that each dux on the Danube disposed of at least one flotilla (one, the dux Pannoniae, controlled three).|$|E
