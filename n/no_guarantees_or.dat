Franchise contracts tend to be unilateral and favor of the franchisor, who is generally protected from lawsuits from their franchisees because of the non-negotiable contracts that franchisees are required to acknowledge, in effect, that they are buying the franchise knowing that there is risk, and that they have not been promised success or profits by the franchisor. Contracts are renewable at the sole option of the franchisor. Most franchisors require franchisees to sign agreements that mandate where and under what law any dispute would be litigated.|$|E

5000|$|From 2006 to 2008, Duran {{took out}} 68 {{commercial}} and personal loans from {{a total of}} 39 banks with <b>no</b> <b>guarantees</b> <b>or</b> property as collateral. He {{had no intention of}} repaying the debts, and used the money to finance various anti-capitalist movements. In 2008, Duran released both an online article entitled [...] "I have [...] "robbed" [...] 492,000 euros from those who rob us the most, in order to denounce them and build alternatives for society" [...] (translated), and an online video, each explaining what he had done and that he had left the country to view the reaction and consider his next move. This was also published in the free magazine Crisis, in Catalan, of which 200,000 copies were printed and distributed by volunteers throughout Catalonia. A second newspaper, We can! Live Without Capitalism was distributed on March 17, 2009, and a third, We want! on September 17, 2009.|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} the optimal value of information (VoI) problem, where {{the goal is}} to sequentially select a set of tests with a minimal cost, so that one can efficiently make the best decision based on the observed outcomes. Existing algorithms are either heuristics with <b>no</b> <b>guarantees,</b> <b>or</b> scale poorly (with exponential run time {{in terms of the number}} of available tests). Moreover, these methods assume a known distribution over the test outcomes, which is often not the case in practice. We propose an efficient sampling-based online learning framework to address the above issues. First, assuming the distribution over hypotheses is known, we propose a dynamic hypothesis enumeration strategy, which allows efficient information gathering with strong theoretical guarantees. We show that with sufficient amount of samples, one can identify a near-optimal decision with high probability. Second, when the parameters of the hypotheses distribution are unknown, we propose an algorithm which learns the parameters progressively via posterior sampling in an online fashion. We further establish a rigorous bound on the expected regret. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a real-world interactive troubleshooting application and show that one can efficiently make high-quality decisions with low cost.

Weighted prediction error (WPE) method performs {{well on the}} dereverberation but with limitations.

Second, it relies on a time-consuming iterative process, and there is <b>no</b> <b>guarantee</b> <b>or</b> a widely accepted criterion on its convergence. In this paper, we integrate deep neural network (DNN) into WPE for dereverberation and denoising. DNN is used to suppress the background noise to meet the noise-free assumption of WPE. Meanwhile, DNN is applied to directly predict spectral variance of the target speech to make the WPE work without iteration. The experimental results show that the proposed method has a significant improvement in speech quality and runs fast...|$|R

5000|$|The {{final cost}} of the project is {{uncertain}} when construction begins because design is not complete. [...] With the traditional design-bid-build process, {{a complete set of}} construction documents and specifications describes what the builder agrees to build and serves as the heart of the contract. On Fast-Track projects, the design, construction documents and specifications are incomplete, so setting the final cost presents problems. To deal with this difficultly, owners typically use a cost-reimbursable contract with the builder (a construction manager or a general contractor). The contract may include a cost estimate with <b>no</b> <b>guarantee</b> <b>or</b> there may be a Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP). However, even with a GMP, there can be argument over the scope of work covered by the GMP since the design was incomplete when the contract was executed.|$|R
