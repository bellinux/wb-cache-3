5|$|Persistent carbenes {{can exist}} in the singlet or the triplet states with the singlet state carbenes being more stable. The {{relative}} stability of these compounds is only partly due to steric hindrance by bulky groups. Some singlet carbenes are thermodynamically stable {{in the absence of}} moisture and (in most cases) oxygen, and can be isolated and indefinitely stored. Others dimerise slowly over days. Triplet state carbenes have half-lives measured in seconds, and therefore can be observed but <b>not</b> <b>stored.</b>|$|E
5|$|Humans must consume {{vitamins}} periodically {{but with}} differing schedules, to avoid deficiency. The body's stores for different vitamins vary widely; vitamins A, D, and B12 {{are stored in}} significant amounts, mainly in the liver, and an adult's diet may be deficient in vitamins A and D for many months and B12 in some cases for years, before developing a deficiency condition. However, vitamin B3 (niacin and niacinamide) is <b>not</b> <b>stored</b> in significant amounts, so stores may last {{only a couple of}} weeks. For vitamin C, the first symptoms of scurvy in experimental studies of complete vitamin C deprivation in humans have varied widely, from a month to more than six months, depending on previous dietary history that determined body stores.|$|E
25|$|Unlike other B {{vitamins}} {{which are}} <b>not</b> <b>stored</b> in the body, B12 {{is stored in}} the liver. Because of this, it may take 5–10 years before a sudden dietary B12 deficiency will become apparent in a previously healthy adult. B12 deficiency, also known as hypocobalaminemia, often results from complications involving absorption into the body.|$|E

25|$|The first {{large scale}} {{liquefaction}} {{of natural gas}} in the U.S. was in 1918 when the U.S. government liquefied natural gas {{as a way to}} extract helium, which is a small component of some natural gas. This helium was intended for use in British dirigibles for World War I. The liquid natural gas (LNG) was <b>not</b> <b>stored,</b> but regasified and immediately put into the gas mains.|$|E

25|$|DMT is {{commonly}} handled and stored as a fumarate, as other DMT acid salts are extremely hygroscopic {{and will not}} readily crystallize. Its freebase form, although less stable than DMT fumarate, is favored by recreational users choosing to vaporize the chemical as it has a lower boiling point. In contrast to DMT's base, its salts are water-soluble. DMT in solution degrades relatively quickly if <b>not</b> <b>stored</b> protected from air, light, and heat in a freezer.|$|E
25|$|Once {{agriculture}} started gaining momentum, around 9000 BC, {{human activity}} {{resulted in the}} selective breeding of cereal grasses (beginning with emmer, einkorn and barley), and not simply of those that would favour greater caloric returns through larger seeds. Plants with traits such as small seeds or bitter taste would {{have been seen as}} undesirable. Plants that rapidly shed their seeds on maturity tended not to be gathered at harvest, therefore <b>not</b> <b>stored</b> and not seeded the following season; years of harvesting selected for strains that retained their edible seeds longer.|$|E

If the metadata are <b>not</b> <b>stored</b> in the files themselves, the naming and organization of the music files are important. If the user has a Plex Pass account, the file naming and organization is not as critical as the music will be matched via sonic fingerprinting.|$|E
25|$|During a {{short period}} in 1959, there was a {{squadron}} stationed at Flesland. From 1962 there were regular detachment within NATO that were earmarked for Flesland. Every other year there were larger exercises with about a dozen aircraft and lasting for several weeks. Smaller training sessions were held every six weeks. The air station was upgraded in 1962 and consisted {{of a series of}} mountain halls, which could house more than twenty-five fighter aircraft. These also include barracks and commando facilities. Flesland was by NATO designated as a deployment site for nuclear warheads, which had prior to 1962 been designated to Sola Air Station. Components for nuclear bombs were most probably stored at Flesland, although the warheads were probably <b>not</b> <b>stored</b> there.|$|E

25|$|Another {{less obvious}} error can also occur when heating the dies. After being {{taken out of}} the {{annealing}} furnace, the dies must cool for 24 to 36 hours. They are usually given an oil bath to cool them more quickly, but the dies must still cool for a period of several hours. When the dies are cooling, if they are <b>not</b> <b>stored</b> properly or not allowed to fully cool before being used, the result is a much softer die. When the die is subjected to the hubbing press again and work hardened again, it will be softer and more susceptible to wear. If the die is softer because it was not fully cooled, it will not harden to the same standard as a die which has received proper treatment. However, {{there will not be a}} noticeable difference between a good die and a bad die; the change in the structure of the die does is not apparent until it is used for a period of time.|$|E
25|$|Jehovah's Witnesses reject transfusions {{of whole}} {{allogenic}} blood and its primary components (red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets and plasma), and transfusions of stored autologous blood or its primary components. As a doctrine, Jehovah's Witnesses do not reject transfusion of whole autologous blood {{so long as}} it is <b>not</b> <b>stored</b> prior to surgery (e.g. peri-operative extraction and transfusion of autologous blood). This religious position is due to their belief that blood is sacred and represents life in God's eyes. Jehovah's Witnesses understand scriptures such as Leviticus 17:10-14 (which speaks of not eating blood) and Acts 15:29 ("abstain from blood") to include taking blood into the body via a transfusion. Controversy has stemmed, however, from what critics state are inconsistencies in Witness policies on blood, claims that Witness patients are coerced into refusing blood and that Watch Tower literature distorts facts about transfusions and fails to provide information that would allow Witnesses to make an informed decision on the issue.|$|E
25|$|Eighty {{percent of}} truckers have unhealthful eating {{patterns}} {{as a result}} of poor food choices and food availability at truck stops is partially to blame. The options at truck stops are generally high calorie and high fat foods available through restaurants, fast-food, diners and vending machines. Fresh produce and whole grain items are few and far between. Though 85% of mini-mart items are categorized as extremely unhealthy, 80% of these meals are considered a truck driver’s main meal of the day. Also, most of the foods carried by drivers in their trucks, whether or <b>not</b> <b>stored</b> in a refrigerator, are purchased from truck stops. Research suggests that drivers value quality and taste much more than nutrition when selecting food. Another issue is the pattern of extensive and irregular snacking while on the road and consumption of one large meal at the end of day. The daily meal is often high in calories and may be the highlight of the trucker’s day. Food intake varies during working hours compared to days off and truckers eat meals at the wrong circadian phase during the day.|$|E

500|$|The {{brown pelican}} usually plunge-dives head-first for its prey, from a height {{as great as}} , {{especially}} for anchovies and menhaden. The only other pelican to feed using a similar technique is the Peruvian pelican, but its dives are typically from a lower height than the brown pelican. The Australian and American white pelicans may feed by low plunge-dives landing feet-first and then scooping up the prey with the beak, but they—as well as the remaining pelican species—primarily feed while swimming on the water. Aquatic prey is most commonly taken {{at or near the}} water surface. Although principally a fish eater, the Australian pelican is also an eclectic and opportunistic scavenger and carnivore that forages in landfill sites as well as taking carrion and [...] "anything from insects and small crustaceans to ducks and small dogs".

500|$|In 1997, a {{follow-up}} entitled [...] {{was released in}} Japan. Designed exclusively for the Super Famicom's Satellaview peripheral, the game would make notable use of a voice broadcast system called SoundLink to provide voice-acting for {{several of the characters}} from A Link to the Past. The game takes place six years after the events in A Link to the Past and it is set in Hyrule's Light World. The game notably lacks a Link character, and instead the player character is known as the Hero of Light. The available player-characters are actually the male and female BS-X avatars that also featured in BS Zelda no Densetsu. The game was divided into four weekly episodes. These episodes were played live, and a voice-acted soundtrack simultaneously ran on the satellite network, sometimes containing suggestions, clues, and plot development for the game currently being broadcast. Each week, the player could only access certain portions of the overworld. Areas shrouded in clouds were unreachable. Two dungeons were accessible per week, however the episode ended only when time expired and not when the player had completed all the objectives for that week. The [...] game could only be played during the set hours because the SoundLink content was central to gameplay (and <b>not</b> <b>stored</b> on the base unit or flash-RAM cartridge in any way), and the timer was based on a real-time clock set by the satellite itself.|$|E
