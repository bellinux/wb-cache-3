Ez – rendszertani lényegébÅ‘l eredÅ‘en – maga alÃ¡ gyÅ±rte a fÃ¶ldnek a tÃ¡rsadalmi kÃ¶zÃ¶sséget fenntartÃ³ és ÃºjratermelÅ‘ kÃ¶zfunkciÃ³it. Az Ãºj tÃ¶rténelmi korszakban – amely a civilizÃ¡ciÃ³ Ã¶sszeomlÃ¡sÃ¡val is fenyeget – a fÃ¶ld és a vÃ­z, mint természeti Å‘selemek birtoklÃ¡sa a tÃºlélés feltétele. Ezért létkérdés a haszonelvÅ± birtokpolitikÃ¡nak a kÃ¶zérdekÅ±, értékkÃ¶vetÅ‘ fÃ¶ldpolitikÃ¡val valÃ³ felvÃ¡ltÃ¡sa. Amikor a kÃ¶zérdeknek elkÃ¶telezett agrÃ¡rértelmiség a nemzeti Ã¶nvédelem eszkÃ¶ztÃ¡rÃ¡val keres kitÃ¶rési pontot az értékalapÃº, a kÃ¶zjÃ³t és a fenntarthatÃ³sÃ¡got szolgÃ¡lÃ³ birtokpolitikÃ¡hoz, még a szakmai pÃ¡rbeszéd igényénél is gÃ¡takba Ã¼tkÃ¶zik. Az alapfogalmak tisztÃ¡zÃ¡sra szorulnak, csak ezutÃ¡n épÃ¼lhet fel – tÃ¡rsadalmi kÃ¶zmegegyezéssel – a kÃ¶zérdekÅ± birtokpolitika cél- és intézményrendszere. Jelen Ã­rÃ¡som ehhez prÃ³bÃ¡l szerény adalékot adni, részben néhÃ¡ny fogalom megvilÃ¡gÃ­tÃ¡sÃ¡val, részben az Ã¡ltalam kidolgozott, nemzeti fÃ¶ldprogram felvÃ¡zolÃ¡sÃ¡val. [...] For 20 years, land {{ownership}} in Hungary {{has been dominated}} by neoliberal land policy, which serves the private interests of cross-national capital investment. By its very nature, this policy has suppressed the community functions of land, such as its ability to sustain and recreate societies and communities. In the new era of history – which might even bring about the collapsing of civilisations – ownership of soil and water, these two ancient natural elements, is essential to survival. This is why replacing profit-oriented land policy with a value-oriented land policy serving common interests is indispensable. When agricultural intellectuals desiring to use the means of national self-defence to seek a point of breakthrough that will bring about a value-based land policy in the service of sustainability and the public good, even professional dialogue is hampered. Basic terms need to be clarified before the goals and institutions of a land policy based on our common interests can be set up, based on a <b>nation-wide</b> <b>agreement.</b> This paper intends to offer a humble contribution to this process by clarifying some terms and by outlining a national land scheme I have developed. értékalapÃº birtokpolitika, nemzeti fÃ¶ldprogram, mezÅ‘gazdasÃ¡gi Ã¼zemszabÃ¡lyozÃ¡s, moratÃ³rium, value-based land policy, national land scheme, regulation of agricultural units, moratorium, Agricultural and Food Policy, Land Economics/Use,...|$|E

I 4 autori cercano di sciogliere i principali nodi interpretativi affrontando le due fonti {{normative}} {{da diverse}} angolazioni. The book {{deals with the}} complex problems wich Italian collective labour law has been experiencing since the signature of <b>nation-wide</b> collective <b>agreement</b> of 28 th June 2011 and the enactment of sect. 8 of the decree-law n. 138 / 2011, converted in law n. 148 / 2011.

40|$|The essay explores {{some recent}} law {{reforms in the}} field of {{individual}} and collective labour relations and focuses on the lowering of the level of protectiveness towards workers they seem to foster as well as on their effect on the system of sources of regulation (i. e. the shift from legislative regulation to contractual norms; from <b>nation-wide</b> collective <b>agreements</b> to plant-level agreements). In this perspective, the author focuses on the consistence of these trends with constitutional principles and rules concerning trade union freedom and collective bargaining. To this end, the author offers an analysis of relevant doctrine and case law and suggests re-reading some basic decisions issued by the Constitutional Court over the time, arguing they still deserve due attention. Throughout his analysis, the author warns about the risk of considering obsolete fundamental principles and rights that are rather still of crucial importance in the current constitutional legal framework...|$|R

Ironically, it was announced early July 2014 that nuclear plants would not produce electricity this summer and that no shortages were expected. No one knows how many nuclear plants will be restarted, for how long, and if any will ever be restarted. But what matters is different and reinforces my argument: a <b>nation-wide</b> helix <b>agreement</b> has been reached in Japan. This agreement associates a majority of civil society, politicians and members of the administration at the national and local level, members of the academic community, and a large number of business people, from the media to high technology. This aggregate is a political arrangement between different helixes, like a reshaped DNA in an advanced industrial nation. The message is clear: a new and extended version of the helix theory is potentially, already, at work at the core of our social and economic systems.|$|R
40|$|The article {{investigates the}} {{contribution}} of social partners to active ageing in Italy. Until recent times the country relied upon a system of unemployment benefits and early retirement schemes that allowed old employees to leave the labour market. This {{is the reason why}} neither the Government, nor the social partners are provided with a comprehensive strategy of active ageing. The Monti pension reform (2011) has made nearly impossible to retire before the age of 60 and, {{because of the lack of}} public resources, the Fornero law (2012) has encouraged social partners to build up funds to retrain employees and to accompany to retirement those who are old and unable to find a new job. In recent times <b>nation-wide</b> collective <b>agreements</b> have spontaneously begun to set down provisions that reflect an increasing attention for older workers: flexible time arrangements and partial retirement schemes for older workers should be experimented in the near future, especially if the legislator offers incentives; health and long term care insurances are becoming increasingly widespread. Also at the enterprise level social partners are negotiating welfare and organisational arrangements that are focused upon older workers. Nevertheless, the Italian experience keeps being still underdeveloped in a comparative perspective (some German, French and Swedish examples are briefly taken into account), mainly because of the persistent lack of strategy by the policy makers...|$|R
