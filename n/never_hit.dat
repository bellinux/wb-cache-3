The Browns' Jesse Burkett hit a shallow pop fly in the {{direction}} of right fielder Zaza Harvey. Home plate umpire Bob Caruthers ruled that Harvey did not make a clean catch, so Burkett was credited with a hit. (Harvey and witnesses said the ball <b>never</b> <b>hit</b> the ground.) Joss finished his major league debut with a one-hitter.|$|E

On April 23, 1952, in his third game with the New York Giants, Wilhelm batted {{for the first time}} in the majors. Facing rookie Dick Hoover of the Boston Braves, Wilhelm hit a home run over the short right-field fence at the Polo Grounds. Although he went to bat a total of 432 times in his career, he <b>never</b> <b>hit</b> another home run.|$|E
5|$|A {{home run}} {{is a hit}} in which the player reaches home plate, and scores a run on the same play without being called out. Most often in modern baseball, this occurs when a player hits the ball over the outfield wall in fair territory. However, it can occur on a ball hit to the outfield with a fast runner when the ball does not leave the field of play; this is called an inside-the-park home run. Home-run hitters are often likely to be larger, slower players due to their strength, {{and may not be}} fast enough to {{complete}} the triple. The MLB single-season and all-time leader in home runs is Barry Bonds, who hit 73 home runs in the 2001 season and notched 762 in his 22-season career. Bonds <b>never</b> <b>hit</b> for the cycle. The highest on the list to do so is Alex Rodriguez (fourth all-time; 696 home runs as of January 16, 2017), who hit for the cycle on June 5, 1997.|$|E

After the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, she was deployed as a coastal defense ship in the Baltic, where she saw heavy service against the Russians. She supported the German drive on Libau in AprilMay 1915, and was damaged by mines during the Battle of the Gulf of Riga. She was repeatedly attacked by Allied submarines, though she was <b>never</b> <b>hit.</b> In 1917, Thetis was withdrawn from front-line service {{for use as a}} gunnery training ship. She survived the war and continued on in service with the Reichsmarine through the 1920s. She was stricken from the naval register on 29 March 1929 and broken up for scrap the following year.|$|E
5|$|Youkilis is an on-base machine. He never swings at a bad pitch, and is {{adept at}} working counts and out-thinking the pitcher. Unlike some guys who draw lots of walks, Youkilis seldom strikes out. He makes solid contact against both fastballs and {{breaking}} pitches. Youkilis' swing is tailored for the line drive, {{and he may}} <b>never</b> <b>hit</b> for much home run power. But he hits balls to the gaps effectively, and could develop 10–14 home run power down the road. Youkilis does not have very good speed, though he is a decent baserunner. His defense at third base draws mixed reviews. His arm, range, and hands all rate as adequate/average. He doesn't kill the defense at third base, but he doesn't help it much, either, {{and is likely to}} end up at first base down the road.|$|E

By considering each diffusion as a particle with unit mass, the randomly evolving configuration {{can be thought of as}} a Radon measure valued diffusion. The quasi-sure analysis of Dirichlet forms is used to find exceptional sets of configurations for this Markov process. We consider large scale properties of the configuration and show that, for quite general measures, the process <b>never</b> <b>hits</b> those unusual configurations that violate the law of large numbers.
