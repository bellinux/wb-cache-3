40|$|Previously {{the authors}} {{presented}} a novel duplex method for very high bit-rate digital subscriber lines (VDSL) called Zipper. With this method all VDSL-modems on different wires {{in the same}} bindergroup have to be time-synchronized to avoid <b>near-end</b> <b>cross-talk</b> (<b>NEXT).</b> We describe a method which enables Zipper to run in a time-asynchronous mode. By introducing pulse-shaping in the transmitter and windowing in the receiver the NEXT is almost completely suppressed even though the synchronization between modems on neighboring lines is skipped. The remaining NEXT and efficiency loss due to pulse-shaping and windowing results in only a small bit-rate performance loss, typically less than 10 % compared to the time-synchronized Zipper. However, with the new freedom of optimizing the lengths of the cyclic suffices with asynchronous Zipper, there may even be a small improvement in bit-rate performance for short wire...|$|E
40|$|Presented in {{this paper}} are {{algorithm}} transformation techniques for adaptive signal processing, which allow dynamic alteration of algorithm properties in response to signal nonstationarities. These transformations, referred to as dynamic algorithm transformations (DAT), jointly optimize algorithm and circuit performance measures such as signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) and power dissipation (PD), respectively. A DAT-based signal processing system is composed of a signal monitoring algorithm (SMA) block and a signal processing algorithm (SPA) block. First, computation of the theoretical power-optimum SPA configuration incorporating signal transition activity is presented. Next, practical SMA schemes are developed, which achieved power reduction {{by a combination of}} powering down the filter taps and modifying the coefficients. The DAT-based adaptive filter is then employed as a <b>near-end</b> <b>cross-talk</b> (<b>NEXT)</b> canceller in 155 : 52 Mb=s ATM-LAN over category 3 wiring.

40|$|In this paper, {{a design}} for Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL) /Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line 2 (ADSL 2) Initialization Process is {{presented}} {{which can be}} applied to different telephone network. Such a proposal can face the different types of noise over DSL channels, the most important types are Background and Crosstalk noises and Inter symbol interference (ISI) which is eliminated by using Time Domain Equalizer (TEQ). The Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) algorithm is implemented as TEQ algorithm. The initialization process where tested on American National Standard Institute (ANSI) defines 8 Carrier Serving Area (CSA) test loops for ADSL service. As a result, 9. 02 Mbps and 9. 42 Mbps were achieved over CSA loop- 2 for ADSL and ADSL 2 respectively. The TEQ efficiency for 8 CSA test loop are calculated where it achieved 93. 1 % of zero ISI for CSA loop- 3. A comparison between Near End <b>Cross-Talk</b> (<b>NEXT)</b> and Far End Cross-Talk (FEXT) power shows that NEXT have higher power and narrow band where NEXT powers were (- 45. 593) dBm for all loops and FEXT were ranging from (- 76. 353 to- 68. 261) dBm for the 8 loops. Finally the results show that ADSL 2 outperforms ADSL by about 400 Kbps which about 1. 1 %...|$|R
40|$|The copper pairs {{are used}} in two main areas: {{regional}} access telecommunication networks and local computer networks, e. g. indoor structured cabling. There was a concept of two types of cables: cables dedicated primarily for telephone networks and, on the other hand, cables for LAN computer networks. In fact, in terms of construction they represent an identical transmission medium {{in the form of}} a symmetric pair with parameters influenced namely by material and diameter of the core, insulation, length of twist and shielding. We have created a new workplace for complex analysis of symmetric pairs properties. The basis of the new workplace is the network analyser HP 3589 A equipped with balance transformers. It is possible to measure the following parameters: complex transfer coefficient, complex transmission coefficient, reflection coefficient, complex impedance, phase characteristics, group delay, various types of attenuation and attenuation characteristics for the ports, near end <b>cross-talk</b> (<b>NEXT),</b> far end <b>cross-talk</b> (FEXT), return loss etc. We have produced the attenuation, NEXT and FEXT models of indoor telephone cables with PE insulation manufactured by the Czech producer PRAKAB based on our own measurements. The models were used for simulations and the calculation of the maximum theoretical transmission speed for symmetric pairs transmission systems under different conditions.

40|$|The {{question}} whether multiples are signal or noise is subject of ongoing debate. In this paper we consider correlation and deconvolution imaging methods and analyse {{to what extent}} multiples contribute to the image in these methods. Our starting point {{is the assumption that}} at a specific depth level the full downgoing and upgoing fields (both including all multiples) are available. First we show that by cross correlating the full downgoing and upgoing wave fields, primaries and multiples contribute to the image. This image is not true-amplitude and is contaminated by <b>cross-talk</b> artefacts. <b>Next</b> we show that by deconvolving the full upgoing field by the full downgoing field, multiples do not contribute to the image. We use minimum-phase arguments to explain this somewhat counterintuitive conclusion. The deconvolution image is true-amplitude and not contaminated by cross-talk artefacts. The conclusion that multiples do not contribute to the image applies to the type of deconvolution imaging analysed in this paper, but should not be extrapolated to other imaging methods. On the contrary, much research is dedicated to using multiples for imaging, for example in full wavefield migration, resonant migration and Marchenko imaging.
