A military leader is extremely effective in this area of treatment.

Simple statements from the small-unit leader to the Service member that he is reacting normally to combat stress and is expected back soon have positive impact. Small-unit leaders should tell Service members that their comrades need and expect them to return.

The collective conclusion {{is that there is}} no evidence establishing a causal connection between the implantation of silicone breast implants and either type of disease. The affected women complained of systemic disease manifested as fungal, neurologic, and rheumatologic ailments. The Danish study Long-term Health Status of Danish Women with Silicone Breast Implants (2004) reported that women who had breast implants for an average of 19 years were <b>no</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> report an excessive number of rheumatic disease symptoms than would the women of the control group. The follow-up study Mortality Rates Among Augmentation Mammoplasty Patients: An Update (2006) reported a decreased standardized mortality ratio and an increased risk of lung cancer death among breast implant patients, than among patients for other types of plastic surgery; the mortality rate differences were attributed to tobacco smoking. The study Mortality Among Canadian Women with Cosmetic Breast Implants (2006), about some 25,000 women with breast implants, reported a 43 per cent lower rate of breast cancer among them than among the general populace, and a lower-than-average risk of cancer.|$|E

500|$|The white (W) locus {{was first}} {{recognized}} in mice in 1908. The mutation {{of the same}} name produces a belly spot and interspersed white hairs on the dorsal aspect of the coat in the heterozygote (W/+) and black-eyed white in the homozygote (W/W). While heterozygotes are healthy, homozygous W mice have severe macrocytic anemia and die within days. A mutation which affects multiple systems is [...] "pleiotropic." [...] Following the mapping of the KIT gene to the W locus in 1988, researchers began identifying other mutations as part of an allelic series of W. There are over 90 known W alleles, each representing a unique mutation on the KIT gene, which primarily produce white spotting from tiny head spots to fully white coats, macrocytic anemia from mild to lethal, and sterility. Some alleles, such as sash produce white spotting alone, while others affect the health of the animal even in the heterozygous state. Alleles encoding small amounts of white are <b>no</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> be linked with anemia and sterility than those encoding conspicuous white. Presently, no anecdotal or research evidence has suggested that equine KIT mutations affect health or fertility. A recent study showed that blood parameters in horses with the W1 mutation were normal.|$|E

40|$|There {{have been}} a number of studies linking {{psychological}} distress with the demand for medical care. The importance of these studies lies in the finding that the distressed use of services more frequently than the non-distressed. To the extent that many of the visits of the distressed are for medically trivial reasons, which is the most frequent interpretation of this finding, there may be an argument in favor of cost containment strategies aimed at diverting the distressed away from seeking 'unneeded' medical attention. There are, however, a number of difficulties both with most of the studies that have been done to date and with how the finding of more frequent visits among the distressed is interpreted. The present study examines the reporting of illnesses, disability per illness reported, patient initiated physician visits per illness reported and physicians' judgement regarding the medical necessity of the visits reported for a representative sample of the Los Angeles metropolitan area. The 950 respondents in this analysis were divided into groups by three levels of psychological distress. Illnesses reported both prospectively and retrospectively to the measurement of psychological distress are analyzed. The data indicate that, although the distressed report more illnesses, they are <b>no</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> either <b>to</b> report disability per illness or to initiate medical care per illness. Further, the distressed are <b>no</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> either <b>to</b> initiate unnecessary physician visits or to avoid initiating necessary visits.

40|$|BACKGROUND: When {{consultations}} for all {{reasons are}} combined, women {{are seen to}} consult their general practitioners more than men through most of adult life. It is, therefore, often assumed that women are <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> consult for every condition. OBJECTIVES: To examine whether women report being <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> consult a general practitioner than men when taking account of the underlying condition and {{various aspects of the}} experience of the condition consulted for. METHODS: Home-based nurse-interviews with 852 people in early middle age (39 years) and 858 in late middle age (58 years) sampled from the general population in the West of Scotland. Detailed information about current chronic conditions included general practitioner consultation and reported experience of pain frequency, pain severity, limitation to normal activities and restricted activity in the previous four weeks. RESULTS: Women were <b>no</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> than men <b>to</b> consult a general practitioner in the previous year when experiencing the five most common groups of conditions; in addition, women were <b>no</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> than men <b>to</b> consult at a given level of severity for a given condition type, except in the case of one aspect of reported experience of mental health problems. CONCLUSIONS: The results argue against the most widely accepted explanation for gender differences in consulting, namely, that women are simply <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> consult a general practitioner than men irrespective of underlying morbidity. Reasons for the higher rates of women consulting observed in general practice-based studies are discussed in relation to these dat...|$|R
