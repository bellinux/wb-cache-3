Roosevelt presented it to Bulkeley in a ceremony in the Oval Office on 4 August 1942. Bulkeley wrote a book about his exploits, entitled They Were Expendable. Parts were serialized in Reader's Digest and Life magazines and it became a bestseller in 1942. In 1944, it was adapted as a movie of the same name, with Robert Montgomery playing a character based on Bulkeley, John Wayne one based on Kelly, and Donna Reed in the role of an Army nurse with whom Kelly had a brief liaison. Postwar analysis found that most of the book's claims were exaggerated.|$|E

500|$|On July 11, 2015, Marvin Carr, {{better known}} by his stage name, Capo, a {{longtime}} member of Keef's Glo Gang label, {{was shot and}} killed in a drive-by shooting in Chicago.

Keef later announced via Twitter that he would be holding a free benefit concert to tribute Capo, as well as encourage concertgoers to donate to Harris' family. Additionally, Keef announced the formation of the Stop the Violence Now Foundation, in an attempt to decrease crime in Chicago. Due to outstanding warrants in Illinois, Keef was scheduled to attend the concert via hologram from a sound stage in Beverly Hills. The concert, organized by HologramUSA and FilmOn Music originally intended to be held in Chicago's Redmoon Theater, faced a series of delays after Chicago mayor Rahm Emanuel's office claimed Keef was [...] "an unacceptable role model" [...] and that his music promoted violence. Keef's representatives then worked out an arrangement with promoters of the Craze Fest event, located in Hammond, Indiana, in an attempt to hold the concert there. Keef's hologram was able to plea for peace in Chicago, stating, [...] "Stop the violence, stop nonsense, stop the killing. Let the kids grow up," [...] before performing [...] "I Don't Like". Fearing that the concert was a threat to public safety, Hammond mayor Thomas McDermott, Jr. successfully organized for the city's police to shut down the generators powering Keef's hologram. McDermott was quoted saying, [...] "I know nothing about Chief Keef. All I’d heard was {{he has a lot of}} songs about gangs and shooting people — a history that’s anti-cop, pro-gang and pro-drug use. He’s been basically outlawed in Chicago, and we’re <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> you circumvent Mayor Emanuel by going next door." [...] Chicago Tribune columnist Eric Zorn criticized Emmanuel and Hammond for their decisions, claiming they infringed upon Keef's First Amendment rights.|$|E

5000|$|A {{serious and}} {{discreet}} person, he earned himself {{a reputation as}} an influential orator. Though they had originally been close friends, Octavius became alarmed by Gracchus's populist agenda and, {{at the behest of}} the Roman senate, repeatedly vetoed Gracchus' programmes of land reform. Gracchus responded by ultimately having the Plebeian Assembly deprive him of his office and eject him from the Assembly's meeting place in 133 BC. This action led to a serious escalation in the confrontation between the traditionalists and the reformers. The action was unprecedented and contravened the mos maiorum (Latin phrase meaning [...] "ancestral custom" [...] or [...] "way of the elders") leading to the overall destabilization of the Republic. The reason that the senate called Marcus Octavius to veto Tiberius Gracchus' land bill or programmes of land reform was because it was [...] "going against the books" [...] so to speak; it was a bit of an unorthodox plan that was not in tune with the traditional ways of Rome's political dealings. The senate felt threatened by this and was <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> simply <b>let</b> Tiberius Gracchus violate the traditions that Rome has traditionally valued. The bill's proposed solution was to address the lack of manpower for the empire at that time. Nonetheless, despite it having been well thought through, it still called for the Republic to move past Roman traditions, controversial because keeping old traditions was very important to the political elites of Rome. Still, Tiberius stood his ground and went against tradition because he believed in the potential of his land reform programmes. Because of his opposition, Tiberius decided it would be best to remove Marcus Octavius from office. Now because Tiberius Gracchus' vote to determine whether or not Marcus Octavius should be removed from office was successful in the sense that it was decided in Tiberius' favor, things were able to change. Once Marcus Octavius was removed from office, the Plebeian tribunes came together and reached the decision that the veto of Tiberius' programmes of land reform should be nulled. Marcus Octavius' veto was nulled and voided because he was no longer in office; because of this, his decision was revoked and no longer valid.|$|R

The mapping f {{is said to be}} representable if there exist a groupoid G and a homomorphism h of G onto S such that Ker(h) is the least congruence of G for which the corresponding factor is a semigroup and f(a) = Cardh − 1 (a) for all a ∈ S. The investigation of representable mappings (see the papers [2] and [3]) is closely connected with and originates from the study of the notion of associativity semihypergroup, which was introduced in [4] and further studied e. g. in [1]. The purpose of the present paper is to introduce a new condition (C), necessary for the representability of a mapping f on a semigroup S; our condition, which is a refinement of a similar condition from [3], turns out to be also sufficient on a large class of semigroups. The necessity and the (restricted) sufficiency of (C) will be the two main results of this paper.
