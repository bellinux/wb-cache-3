50|$|The main {{benefit of}} a <b>nominee</b> <b>account</b> {{is the ability to}} keep track of all RRSP {{investments}} within a single account. The main detriment is that nominee accounts often incur annual fees.|$|E
5000|$|In the UK Units can {{be bought}} direct from the fund manager, held through a <b>nominee</b> <b>account</b> or through an ISA (individual savings account).It is also {{possible}} to invest via fund platforms.|$|E
50|$|The main {{benefits}} and detriments of intermediary accounts are identical as those offered by <b>nominee</b> <b>accounts.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{popularity}} of <b>nominee</b> <b>accounts</b> has increased rapidly since {{the introduction of}} Internet share dealing in the late 1990s {{and in some cases}} stocks can only be held electronically, such as exchange-traded funds, but holding shares in this way can have disadvantages compared to other methods.|$|R
25|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the company's collapse, it was alleged that Paul and a corporate officer named Stephan Gordon had illegally tried to support the stock's price by using <b>nominee</b> <b>accounts</b> to buy 1.6 million shares of the company's stock, attempting to pay for the stock with bad checks.|$|R
50|$|As a result, the advisor will {{approach}} {{an intermediary}} company which {{is able to}} offer the investor identical benefits as those offered by a <b>nominee</b> <b>account.</b> The two main Canadian financial institutions that offer intermediary services are B2B Bank and Canadian Western Trust.|$|E
5000|$|The {{majority}} of Eurobonds are now owned in [...] "electronic" [...] rather than physical form. The bonds are held and traded within {{one of the}} clearing systems (Euroclear and Clearstream being the most common). Coupons are paid electronically via the clearing systems to the holder of the Eurobond (or their <b>nominee</b> <b>account).</b>|$|E
50|$|Intermediary {{accounts}} are essentially identical in function to nominee accounts. The reason investors {{would have an}} intermediary account instead of a <b>nominee</b> <b>account</b> {{has to do with}} the investment advisor they deal with, as advisors not aligned with a major bank or investment dealer may not have the logistical ability to offer nominee accounts to their clients.|$|E
5000|$|It is {{not normal}} {{practice}} in the UK for nominees to arrange for copies of accounts and other shareholder communications {{to be sent to}} the beneficial owners of the shares. The UK Shareholders Association has published a list of the disadvantages for UK customers of <b>nominee</b> <b>accounts</b> compared with certificated ownership or direct electronic ownership (CREST). http://www.uksa.org.uk/files/PENALTIES%20OF%20NOMINEE%20ACCOUNTS_1.pdf ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{anonymity}} of <b>nominee</b> <b>accounts</b> does benefit individuals {{who wish to}} hold shares in controversial companies. This has proved useful in situations where investors on share registers have been threatened by animal rights protestors, such as Huntingdon Life Sciences and GlaxoSmithKline. [...] As a consequence, the protestors {{have been known to}} intimidate the employees of the stockbrokers instead {{in order to try to}} force the companies to stop handling the shares.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Nominee</b> <b>accounts</b> are {{so named}} because {{individuals}} {{with this type of}} <b>account</b> nominate a <b>nominee,</b> usually one of Canada's five major banks or a major investment dealer, to hold a number of different investments in a single account. For example, if an individual buys investment # 1 with one company and investment #2 with another, both investments are held in a single RRSP <b>account</b> with the <b>nominee,</b> a chartered bank., ...|$|R
5000|$|In September 2013, CSD.Austria, the Austrian central {{securities}} depository {{operated by}} OeKB, and NSD launched an international direct {{link to the}} Russian securities market. As a result, Austrian and international custodians holding securities accounts with CSD.Austria obtained {{the opportunity to make}} direct settlement of Russian securities and hold them using CSD.Austrias's foreign <b>nominee</b> <b>account</b> opened with NSD.|$|E
5000|$|A [...] "self-directed" [...] RRSP (SDRSP) is {{a special}} kind of <b>nominee</b> <b>account.</b> It is {{essentially}} a trading account at a brokerage that has tax-sheltered status. The holder of a self-directed RRSP instructs the brokerage to buy and sell securities on their behalf as with any brokerage account. The reason that it is described as [...] "self-directed" [...] is that the holder of this kind of RRSP directs all the investment decisions themselves, and does not normally have the service of an investment advisor.|$|E
5000|$|The phrase {{street name}} {{securities}} or [...] "nominee name securities" [...] {{is used in}} the United States to refer to securities of companies which are held electronically in the account of a stockbroker or bank or custodian, similar to a bank account. [...] The entity whose name is recorded as the legal owner of the securities is known as the [...] "nominee owner," [...] and that entity has ownership rights in the security. [...] The nominee owner holds those ownership rights on behalf of the true economic owner who is [...] referred to as the beneficial owner. In the US, Cede & Co., a nominee of Depository Trust Company, is typically the largest stockholder of a company. In the US where Cede & Co. is the street name holder, therefore, all beneficial rights such as voting rights and dividends flow first to the nominee holder Cede, and then are passed onward, and ultimately to the beneficial owners. [...] In the United Kingdom this is known as holding shares in a <b>nominee</b> <b>account.</b>|$|E
50|$|In November and December 2015 Stubb {{got himself}} {{in the middle of}} a scandal when he was accused of lying to Finnish Parliament not just once but {{consistently}} and deliberately. In November Stubb had said to Parliament that 90 percent of the experts who had given a statement, were supporting government's pact to make it possible for Finnish to own publicly listed companies' stock through <b>nominee</b> <b>accounts.</b> The real number was 10 percent, which was the very opposite Stubb had said. One of the many Members of Parliament who criticized Stubb was Eero Heinäluoma, who told that Finance Minister Stubb had lied to Parliament also in other issues in several times, and this was deliberate.|$|R
5000|$|Because {{the shares}} {{are held in}} the name of the {{stockbroker}} or bank the name of the beneficial owner does not appear on the share register. This means that dividends, shareholder perks, company reports, details of corporate actions and other communications are sent to the stockbroker rather than the beneficial owner. The extent and methods for handling this can vary considerably between brokers. Failure of the stockbroker or bank to pass on shareholder rights and communications to the beneficial owner is one of the major complaints against <b>nominee</b> <b>accounts</b> and is a major reason why activist shareholder organisations such as The United Kingdom Shareholders' Association are opposed to their use. [...] During 2006 the UK government passed an amendment to the Companies Act 1985 which gave nominee shareholders more rights.|$|R
50|$|As {{with direct}} {{electronic}} registration, <b>nominee</b> <b>accounts</b> make paperless telephone and internet trading possible with faster settlement periods and lower commissions than certificate deals. They often enable domestic small investors {{to gain access}} to derivatives such as warrants and contracts for difference, to exercise various types of order, and to buy shares on margin. There is no risk of loss or damage to certificates. It is also possible to obtain an instant valuation of a whole portfolio. On the negative side the shareholder is tied into one stockbroker, as opposed to a certificate holder or someone who has direct electronic registration who can pick and choose stockbrokers every time they deal. If the shareholder is unhappy with their nominee service, they have to arrange to transfer the shares out which can be a lengthy process for which there is usually a charge. The lack of a share certificate can also make it difficult to use shares as collateral for a loan.|$|R
40|$|The {{report on}} "Clearing and Settlement in the Nordic {{countries}} and the Giovannini report of November 2001 " was presented by the Nordic Working Group for Securities Market Issues in January 2004. The purpose of the report was to identify potential legal barriers in the five Nordic countries to effective cross-border clearing and settlement as identified in the Giovannini report (European Commission's advisory working group consisting of market participants). The key observations of the report were the following: There are few legal provisions in Nordic countries creating technical barriers. As for taxation, some barriers are identified. However, the main barriers as regards taxation are probably of a more general nature than the barriers discussed in the Giovannini report. Furthermore, relatively few barriers are identified in relation to legal uncertainty. However, general uncertainty in relation to treatment of <b>nominee</b> <b>accounts</b> might be a potential impediment to effective clearing and settlement in the Nordic countries. The report has an English summary. The full text is available is Norwegian...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} various investor groups and stock liquidity for Malaysian public listed firms over the 2002 – 2009 sample period. Using the Amihud illiquidity ratio, we extend the literature by addressing the issues of investor heterogeneity, trading account types and the interactions of competing liquidity channels. The analysis reveals that only local institutions and local individual investors who trade through the direct accounts are significantly associated with the liquidity of domestic firms. In contrast, the significant liquidity effect for foreign investors operates through the <b>nominee</b> <b>accounts.</b> While institutional ownership exhibits a linear negative relationship, our findings on local individuals and foreign nominees differ greatly from previous studies in that their relationship with stock liquidity is non-monotonic. Apart from the widely-researched information asymmetry and trading effects, we find that liquidity is also driven by the largely ignored information competition channel. An important insight from our findings is that the large shareholdings by any particular investor group is detrimental to stock liquidity as they exacerbate information asymmetry, reduce the degree of competition and lower the level of trading activity...|$|R
50|$|Generally, client-held {{accounts}} are for {{mutual funds and}} exempt products only; therefore, if an investor holds stocks and bonds along with mutual funds or exempt products, a <b>Nominee</b> or Intermediary <b>account</b> is most beneficial for ease of tracking all types of investments in one place.|$|R
50|$|According to the Moriarty Tribunal report, {{the next}} day, on 8 May 1990, £206,613.57 was {{withdrawn}} from one NCB account, converted into sterling £200,000 {{and transferred to}} the Aurum <b>Nominees</b> No.6 <b>account</b> at NCB (proxied to an offshore Ansbacher Cayman account) held {{for the benefit of}} then Taoiseach, Charles Haughey. Aurum Nominees Limited was a company established by NCB for the benefit of its clients, and used at the time by several of the beneficiaries to the deal, including JP McManus, Lochlann Quinn and Martin Naughton. Mr Quinn and Mr Naughton were owed money by Mr Desmond and he used the proceeds of the sale to pay off his debt to them, according to the report.|$|R
40|$|This article {{makes some}} {{observations}} on the interaction of UK taxation and portfolio decisions by a personal investor managing his own investments in quoted company shares. Three holding vehicles are considered: two types of tax-advantaged account (ISAs and SIPPs), and taxable holdings registered directly in the investor’s own name or a <b>nominee</b> (personal <b>account).</b> Some observations are made on ways in which portfolio management of a taxable account differs from management of a tax-advantaged account. Simple models are used to illustrate the difﬁculty of producing post-tax out-performance from active management of a taxable account. Guidelines are suggested {{for the type of}} investment to be allocated to each type of account, for turnover in each type of account, and for decisions on switching between investments held in a taxable account...|$|R
