It {{is due to the}} {{influence}} of gravity on the geometry of space and to the contribution of self-energy to a body's gravity (encoded in the <b>nonlinearity</b> of Einstein's equations). Relativistic precession has been observed for all planets that allow for accurate precession measurements (Mercury, Venus, and Earth), as well as in binary pulsar systems, where it is larger by five orders of magnitude.|$|E

From the controller design point of view, accurate yet simple model of input <b>nonlinearities</b> is essential to compensate their effects and to achieve high level control performance. Unfortunately, most input <b>nonlinearities</b> are neither known nor easy to characterize, especially when the input <b>nonlinearities</b> and unknown system parameters are present simultaneously in the system dynamics. Off-board calibration may be possible yet it is very time consuming and requires additional calibration systems. This paper focuses on a class of systems with unknown input <b>nonlinearities</b> and system parameters and proposes an on-board system identification process to model the unknown <b>nonlinearities.</b> The input <b>nonlinearities</b> are decomposed into localized orthogonal basis and then estimated together with the system parameters. The proposed method is applied to model the nonlinear flow mapping of cartridge valves. Simulation and experimental results are obtained to illustrate the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed method...|$|R

30|$|The {{cochlear}} <b>nonlinearity’s</b> rate-of-change, for “recovery” data, follows an angle-shape, whereas for “growth” data it declines as {{a single}} power function; it does so also for re-analyzed probe-tone-detection thresholds of Schairer and colleagues. The equations for rates-of-change were integrated to give the cochlear <b>nonlinearities</b> themselves, each characterized by a single unknown parameter. The parameter’s possible values were implied by comparing the <b>nonlinearity’s</b> inferred rates- of-change in man to those measured in animals. Altogether, then, the human cochlear <b>nonlinearities</b> inferred from “recovery” have a distinct but smooth bend between two branches, a steep low-intensity branch and a shallow high-intensity branch, whereas those inferred from “growth” resemble the smoothly decelerating <b>nonlinearities</b> observed for animals.|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the mixed H 2 /H ∞ control problem for a class of stochastic time-varying systems with <b>nonlinearities.</b> The <b>nonlinearities</b> are described by statistical means and could cover several kinds of well-studied <b>nonlinearities</b> as special cases. The occurrence of the addressed <b>nonlinearities</b> is governed by two sequences of Bernoulli distributed white sequences with known probabilities. Such <b>nonlinearities</b> are named as randomly occurring <b>nonlinearities</b> (RONs) as they appear in a probabilistic way. The purpose of the problem under investigation is to design a controller such that the closed-loop system achieves the expected H 2 performance requirements with a guaranteed H ∞ disturbance attenuation level. A sufficient condition is given for the existence of the desired controller by means of the solvability of certain coupled matrix equations. By resorting to the game theory approach, an algorithm is developed to obtain the controller gain at each sampling instant. A numerical example is presented to show the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed method...|$|R
