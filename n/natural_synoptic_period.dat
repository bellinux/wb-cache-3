In {{the framework of}} the nondivergent (barotropic) model, two stages of the evolution are observed. At the first stage (for about 30 <b>synoptic</b> <b>periods),</b> the parameters and the form of the vortex practically remain constant, whereas at the second stage, vorticity filaments are emitted. Due to the filamentation, the vortex core contracts, the potential vorticity peaks of the vortex pair get closer, and the modon speeds up. In the divergent (equivalent-barotropic) model, nonlocal modons and the Lamb modon (that has no wave field outside the dipolar core) evolve much more slowly, essentially preserving the initial shape and propagation speed until about 100 <b>synoptic</b> <b>periods...</b>|$|R

40|$|Atmospheric {{aerosols}} on Mars {{are critical}} {{in determining the}} nature of its thermal structure, its large-scale circulation, and hence the overall climate of the planet. We conduct multi-annual simulations with the latest version of the NASA Ames Mars global climate model (GCM), gcm 2. 3 +, that includes a modernized radiative-transfer package and complex water-ice cloud microphysics package which permit radiative effects and interactions of suspended atmospheric aerosols (e. g., water ice clouds, water vapor, dust, and mutual interactions) to influence the net diabatic heating. Results indicate that radiatively active water ice clouds profoundly affect the seasonal and annual mean climate. The mean thermal structure and balanced circulation patterns are strongly modified near the surface and aloft. Warming of the subtropical atmosphere at altitude and cooling of the high latitude atmosphere at low levels takes place, which increases the mean pole-to-equator temperature contrast (i. e., "baroclinicity"). With radiatively active water ice clouds (RAC) compared to radiatively inert water ice clouds (nonRAC), significant changes in the intensity of the mean state and forced stationary Rossby modes occur, both of which affect the vigor and intensity of traveling, <b>synoptic</b> <b>period</b> weather systems. Such weather systems not only act as key agents in the transport of heat and momentum beyond the extent of the Hadley circulation, but also the transport of trace species such as water vapor, water ice-clouds, dust and others. The northern hemisphere (NH) forced Rossby waves and resultant wave train are augmented in the RAC case: the modes are more intense and the wave train is shifted equatorward. Significant changes also occur within the subtropics and tropics. The Rossby wave train sets up, combined with the traveling <b>synoptic</b> <b>period</b> weather systems (i. e., cyclones and anticyclones), the geographic extent of storm zones (or storm tracks) within the NH. A variety of circulation features will be presented which indicate contrasts between the RAC and nonRAC cases, and which highlight key effects radiatively-active clouds have on physical and dynamical processes active in the current climate of Mars...|$|R

Excellent spatial and temporal resolution of the sodar data allows for studying a fine-structure of the wind stratification in the atmospheric boundary layer in details. The main tendency of the wind speed annual course is higher values in cold period and comparatively smaller ones in warm period. Separate monthly-averaged values of wind speed in the air layer from 40 to 200 m vary in limits from 4 to 7 m/s of approximately. The maximal-maximorum value of wind speed above Moscow (up to the level of 500 m) averaged for 10 minutes has been found thrice as 31 m/s. The statistical distribution of wind speed is characterized by positive skewness and is close to the logarithmically normal law. A mode of the total wind speed distribution is nearly of 4 m/s.

This reflects uncertainty in the GCM simulations of the regional meteorological variables affecting PM 2. 5. Here we use the CMIP 3 archive of data from fifteen different IPCC AR 4 GCMs to obtain improved statistics of 21 st-century trends in the meteorological modes driving PM 2. 5 variability over the contiguous US. We analyze 1999 – 2010 observations to identify the dominant meteorological modes driving interannual PM 2. 5 variability and their <b>synoptic</b> <b>periods</b> T. We find robust correlations (r > 0. 5) of annual mean PM 2. 5 with T, especially in the eastern US where the dominant modes represent frontal passages. The GCMs all have significant skill in reproducing present-day statistics for T and we show that this reflects their ability to simulate atmospheric baroclinicity. We then use the local PM 2. 5 -to-period sensitivity (dPM 2. 5 /dT) from the 1999 – 2010 observations to project PM 2. 5 changes from the 2000 – 2050 changes in T simulated by the 15 GCMs following the SRES A 1 B greenhouse warming scenario. By weighted-average statistics of GCM results we project a likely 2000 – 2050 increase of ~ 0. 1 μg m − 3 in annual mean PM 2. 5 in the eastern US arising from less frequent frontal ventilation, and a likely decrease albeit with greater inter-GCM variability in the Pacific Northwest due to more frequent maritime inflows. Potentially larger regional effects of 2000 – 2050 climate change on PM 2. 5 may arise from changes in temperature, biogenic emissions, wildfires, and vegetation, but are still unlikely to affect annual PM 2. 5 by more than 0. 5 μg m − 3...|$|R
40|$|A global {{database}} of approximately 1. 7 million {{observations of the}} partial pressure of carbon dioxide in surface ocean waters (pCO 2) collected between 1970 and 2003 is used to estimate its spatial autocorrelation structure. The patterns of the lag distance where the autocorrelation exceeds 0. 8 is similar to patterns in the spatial distribution of the first baroclinic Rossby radius of deformation indicating that ocean circulation processes {{play a significant role}} in determining the spatial variability of pCO 2. For example, the global maximum of the distance at which autocorrelations exceed 0. 8 averages about 140 km in the equatorial Pacific. Also, the lag distance at which the autocorrelation exceed 0. 8 is greater in the vicinity of the Gulf Stream than it is near the Kuroshio, approximately 50 km near the Gulf Stream as opposed to 20 km near the Kuroshio. Separate calculations for times when the sun is north and south of the equator revealed no obvious seasonal dependence of the spatial autocorrelation scales. The pCO 2 measurements at Ocean Weather Station (OWS) 'P', in the eastern subarctic Pacific (50 N, 145 W) is the only fixed location where an uninterrupted time series of sufficient length exists to calculate a meaningful temporal autocorrelation function for lags greater than a few days. The estimated temporal autocorrelation function at OWS 'P', is highly variable. A spectral analysis of the longest four pCO 2 time series indicates a high level of variability occurring over periods from the atmospheric synoptic to the maximum length of the time series, in this case 42 days. It is likely that a relative peak in variability with a period of 3 - 6 days is related to atmospheric <b>synoptic</b> <b>period</b> variability and ocean mixing events due to wind stirring. However, the short length of available time series makes identifying temporal relationships between pCO 2 and atmospheric or ocean processes problematic...|$|R

To achieve this objective patterns and trends of malaria burdens; malaria hospital admissions, morbidity and mortality, climatic elements; and households' characteristics and district health delivery system were investigated. Secondary data on malaria burdens and climatic element were obtained from Kericho district health facilities and Kericho meteorological station respectively for the <b>synoptic</b> <b>period</b> 1988 - 2005.

Useful information on health efficiency delivery system in the district was obtained from key medical professionals respondents to questionnaires in Kericho district health facilities. The data were analysed displayed and interpreted using statistical methods; tables, graphs, means, percentages, ranges, correlation, regression analysis and tests of significance (t-test) and Analysis of Variance (ANOVA).

The buoys drifted in unison {{for most of}} the experimnt and provided 12 - 19 months of hourly ambient noise data between 5 and 4000 Hz while obtaining limited weather data. The drift pattern was neatly divided into five legs of nearly uniform ice velocities in response to major changes in the wind field. The annual median spectra of each buoy were nearly identical at or above 200 Nz but diverged below 200 Hz. The largest differences were recorded between the two closest buoys. The annual spectra wer 10 d 4 greater than the long term]urasian Basin median spectra at all frequencies. The annual median spectra was 6 - 7 dB greater than th,, CZAR= 1988 / 89 median spectra below 100 HN but was quieter than CZARIX above 100 Hz. Persistent extreme noise levels above the 95 " or below the 5 eS percentiles were rare. Sustained 95 • percentile noise levels were caused by the ice field convergence resulting from storms passing near the buoy cluster. Sustained noise levels near the 5 "t percentile occurred during periods of slow, steady winds. Temporal coherency of the year-long record ranged from 12 - 23 hours at all frequencies, comparable to other reported data. Significant energy was found at <b>synoptic</b> <b>periods</b> of 16 - 148 hours and near the tidal/inertial 12 hour period at all three buoys, implying the smem forcing mechanisms were important in spite of buoy separations up to 300 ka.

Three periods of extreme noise levels (two loud, one quiet), each lasting for several days, were investigated in detail to establish the role of wind forcing on ambient noise generation. Periods of loud noise were associated with periods of high wind/ice speed coupled with rapid changes in direction, i. e., loud noise levels are the result of large ice convergence and shearing moment. Quiet periods occur when the buoy drift speed is slow. One of the loud noise events showed that periods of ice convergence on nearby land will increase the noise level, even during times of moderate wind speeds. U. S. Navy (USN) autho...|$|R

A primary {{purpose was to}} test the hypothesis that atmospheric forcing is a cause of horizontal temperature variance on these length scales. Using continuous sea surface temperatures acquired in the Central North Pacific Ocean, spectra were computed for temperature variance. The variability in these spectra on seasonal, <b>synoptic,</b> and diurnal <b>periods</b> was then examined and correlated with changes in atmospheric conditions. Important results found included a seasonal dependence for the patchiness structure, a negative correlation between surface temperature variance and wind speed on a synoptic time scale, and a diurnal variability in patchiness that may be explained by solar insolation and turbulent heat exchange with the atmosphere. In conclusion, a strong atmospherically controlled temporal variability in the small scale horizontal sea surface temperature variance is found and may explain inconsistencies in earlier observational and theoretical studies.

Three one-year data sets were examined using Fourier and rotary spectrum analysis techniques.

These peaks correspond to synoptic variability at low frequency, the inertial response at an intermediate frequency and a nonphysical response at high frequency, due to the finite time differencing procedure employed. This response at high frequency was two orders of magnitude smaller than the peaks at the <b>synoptic</b> and inertial <b>periods.</b> The inertial motion was the same order of magnitude as the synoptic motion near the surface, but much weaker below.

40|$|Final {{published}} versionIn late March 2007 {{an array}} of GPS ice drifters was deployed in the Beaufort Sea {{as part of the}} Sea Ice Experiment: Dynamic Nature of the Arctic (SEDNA). The drifters were deployed in an array designed to resolve four, nested spatial scales of sea-ice deformation, from 10 to 140 km, with the arrays maintaining appropriate shape for strain-rate calculation until mid-June. In this paper, we test whether sea-ice deformation displays fractal properties in the vicinity of SEDNA. We identify that deformation time series have different spectral properties depending on the spatial scale. At the scales around 100 km, deformation is a red-noise process, indicating the importance of the ice-pack surface forcing in determining the deformation rate of sea ice at this scale. At smaller scales, the deformation becomes an increasingly whiter process (it has pink noise properties), which suggests an increasing role of dissipative processes at smaller scales. At spatial scales of 10 - 100 km, and sub-daily scales, there is no deformation coherence across scales; coherence only becomes apparent at longer scales greater than 100 km. The lack of coherence at small scales aids in understanding previous observations where correlation between 10 km regions adjacent to each other varied widely, with correlation coefficients between 0. 3 and 1. This suggests it is not appropriate to think of sea ice as having a decorrelation length scale for deformation. We find that lead scale observations of deformation are required when estimating ice growth in leads and ridging time series. For the two SEDNA arrays, we find coherence between 140 and 20 km scale deformation up to periods of 16 days. This suggests sea-ice deformation displays coherent deformation between 100 km scale and the scale of the Beaufort Sea (of order 1000 km), over <b>synoptic</b> time <b>periods</b> (daily to weekly timescales). Organization of leads at synoptic and larger scales is an emergent feature of the deformation field that is caused by the smooth variation of surface forcing (wind) on the ice pack.

The Dallas / Fort Worth area is in violation of these standards, and to date, no extensive studies on ozone in this area have been published. This study presents a broad overview of the ozone problem in the DFW area. An ozone spatial and temporal climatology was constructed using ozone data at 23 different monitoring sites from 1980 - 1996. Temporally, the high ozone threat was found to extend from 16 Apr-l 5 Oct, a period one month longer than the traditional period used in cities further north. Strong persistence was found over <b>synoptic</b> time <b>periods,</b> consistent with studies in other cities. The spatial study was challenged by the lack of a consistent monitoring network, but in general relatively depressed ozone values are observed in urban areas, with increasing ozone values in rural areas especially downwind. Northern rural areas had the highest ozone averages. Ozone-meteorology relationships were examined using scatterplots and correlation coefficients, Most of the meteorology variables only displayed a rate-limiting role with ozone. Correlation values displayed significant seasonal variation, with temperature having a much lower correlation than expected based on results from other studies. Conditional Climatology Tables were constructed to explore which combination of variables pointed to the highest ozone days. Yesterday's ozone, wind speed, and wind direction were found the most predictive. In general, low wind speeds and wind directions from the E-SE were most favorable for high ozone. Wind direction biases were examined using windroses and by examining upwind vs. downwind behavior at the periphery sites. Evidence suggests that high ozone in the east, south, and west has occurred, but has gone undetected {{due to a lack of}} consistent monitoring there.

The present paper presents results of aircraft measurements aimed at quantitizing the sulfur flux arriving at Israel’s western coast from Europe and the Israeli pollution contribution to the air masses leaving its eastern borders towards Jordan. During the research flights, measurements of sulfur dioxide and sulfate particulates and meteorological data were recorded. Two different legs were performed for each research flight: one over the Mediterranean Sea, west of the coast and the second along the Jordan Valley. All flights were carried out at a height of approximately 300 m above ground level. A total of 14 research flights were performed covering the summer and autumn seasons. The results indicate that the influx of sulfur arriving at the Israeli coast from Europe varied in the range of 1 – 30 mg Syh, depending on the measuring season.

With a nudged version of the coupled aerosol-climate model ECHAM 5 -HAM we simulate aerosol and aerosol optical thickness (AOT) for the campaign <b>period.</b> <b>Synoptic</b> scale meteorology is represented realistically and simulated concentrations of aerosol sulfate and organics at the surface are generally within a factor of two from observed values. The monthly averaged AOT from the model is 0. 33, about 20 % larger than observed. For selected periods of the month with relatively dry and moist conditions discrepancies are approximately - 30 % and + 15 %, respectively. Discrepancies during the dry period are partly caused by inaccurate representation of boundary layer (BL) dynamics by the model affecting the simulated AOT. The model simulates too strong exchange between the BL and the free troposphere, resulting in weaker concentration gradients at the BL top than observed for aerosol and humidity, while upward mixing from the surface layers into the BL appears to be underestimated. The results indicate that beside aerosol sulfate and organics also aerosol ammonium and nitrate significantly contribute to aerosol water uptake. The relation between particle concentration and AOT is rather weak during IMPACT. The simulated day-to-day variability of AOT follows synoptic scale advection of humidity rather than particle concentration. Even for relatively dry conditions AOT appears to be strongly influenced by the diurnal cycle of RH in the lower boundary layer, further enhanced by uptake and release of nitric acid and ammonia by aerosol water...|$|R

Satellite imagery was used to determine the spatial and temporal distribution of wetlands across arid Australia over an 11 -year <b>period.</b> <b>Synoptic</b> climate data were examined to identify the weather systems that caused wetland filling events. Simple threshold models relating rainfall to wetland filling for seven large regions of Australia were developed to examine patterns of wetland filling over the last 100 years. These data were used to examine the climatic processes that drive wetland filling and the likely impacts of climate change on wetland distribution. The strongest climatic influence on wetland filling in the arid zone was tropical weather systems. Their influence extended into southern regions and their effects were often widespread. Variation in wetland area in all regions of the arid zone was high. The Lake Eyre Basin experienced more large flood events than other regions and had the most large, persistent wetlands that remain unregulated by humans. Hindcasting of past filling events indicated that there was a general pattern of frequent wetland filling across inland Australia in the 1910 s, 1950 s and 1970 s, and less frequent wetland filling in the late 1920 s, 1930 s and 1960 s.

With a nudged version of the coupled aerosol-climate model ECHAM 5 -HAM we simulate the size distribution and chemical composition of the aerosol and the associated aerosol optical thickness (AOT) for the campaign <b>period.</b> <b>Synoptic</b> scale meteorology is represented realistically through nudging of the vorticity, the divergence, the temperature and the surface pressure. Simulated concentrations of aerosol sulfate and organics at the surface are generally within a factor of two from observed values. The monthly averaged AOT from the model is 0. 33, about 20 % larger than observed. For selected periods of the month with relatively dry and moist conditions discrepancies are approximately - 30 % and + 15 %, respectively. Discrepancies during the dry period are partly caused by inaccurate representation of boundary layer (BL) dynamics by the model affecting the simulated AOT. The model simulates too strong exchange between the BL and the free troposphere, resulting in weaker concentration gradients at the BL top than observed for aerosol and humidity, while upward mixing from the surface layers into the BL appears to be underestimated. The results indicate that beside aerosol sulfate and organics also aerosol ammonium and nitrate significantly contribute to aerosol water uptake. The simulated day-to-day variability of AOT follows synoptic scale advection of humidity rather than particle concentration. Even for relatively dry conditions AOT appears to be strongly influenced by the diurnal cycle of RH in the lower boundary layer, further enhanced by uptake and release of nitric acid and ammonia by aerosol water...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 68 - 76). This study {{assessed the}} {{spatial and temporal}} patterns of wildfires in the Cape Floristic Region (CFR). It focused on {{the factors that influence}} fire frequency; namely vegetation age, ignition sources and weather conditions. This work was done to aid decisions on fire management in fynbos nature reserves. Fire intervals were extracted from historical fire records in four reserves in the CFR. The study sites were the Cederberg and Hottentots-Holland (western) reserves and the Swartberg and Outeniqua (eastern) reserves, and fire records were used from 1970 to 2007. A non-parametric technique and smoothing methods were used to highlight patterns in the extracted fire intervals. Comparisons of fire frequency were made between the study sites to analyse spatial patterns of burning. The impact of anthropogenic ignitions on fire frequency was analysed to explore the effect of people on fire patterns. The relationship between fuel age and fire size was analysed to determine the influence of vegetation age on fire patterns. Two novel methods were described in this thesis. The first method developed a technique to analyse temporal patterns in fire frequency while avoiding the impacts of temporal autocorrelation. The second method analysed the relationship between weather condition and fire events by utilising self-organising maps of synoptic states. A temporal change in the frequency of these synoptic states was tested for over the recording <b>period.</b> <b>Synoptic</b> states were used to produce two regional fire risk indicators for the CFR. I found that fire intervals in western study areas of CFR were shorter than fire intervals in eastern study areas. The effect of anthropogenic ignition sources shortened fire intervals in all study sites; however, this was relative to the natural fire frequency of each study site. Prescribed burning as a form of fire management contributed relatively little to the total area burned in all study sites. Fuel age has a significant correlation to fire size in only the drier (Swartberg) study site. A decreasing trend in fire return intervals was found in three study sites; Cederberg, Hottentots-Holland and Outeniqua. Synoptic states characteristic of the southern-most extent of a tropical easterly wave low were correlated to frequency fire events in the western study areas. Fires in the eastern study areas were correlated to a synoptic state characteristic of a tropical temperate trough. Easterly wave lows are associated with strong atmospheric convection whereas tropical temperate troughs are associated with pre-frontal conditions and strong, hot and dry winds. The frequencies of these synoptic states were shown to have increased in recent decade. The factors influencing fire frequency in the western CFR are predominantly sources of ignition, while the availability of fuels and suitable weather conditions restrict fires in the eastern CFR. Fire frequency has increased in the study sites where weather exerts the dominant control and {{this is due to the}} increase in synoptic states that promote wildfires. Historical records show that fire management has had little impact on the total area burned, thus fire management under climate change is unlikely to influence fire frequency...|$|R
