40|$|The {{effect of}} {{vehicular}} {{traffic on the}} production of groundnut (Arachis hypogea) was investigated in a sandy loam soil. A randomized complete block design with treatments of 0, 5, 10, 15 and 20 passes <b>of</b> a <b>tractor</b> with 31 kPa contact pressure was used. The gravimetric soil moisture content, soil dry bulk density, penetration resistance and air permeability for each applied load were measured from the soil surface up {{to a depth of}} 10 cm. Seed moisture content, haulms and seed yield were determined at harvest for each treatment. Soil dry bulk density and penetration resistance increased with increase in the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>tractor</b> passes while air permeability decreased with increase in the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>tractor</b> passes. The haulms yield and seed yield increased with increase in the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>tractor</b> passes up to 5 passes, and thereafter decreased with further increases in tractor passes. The soil physical properties and the product <b>of</b> the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>tractor</b> passes and contact pressure were used to generate a groundnut yield model. The yield model that contained the interactions of the product <b>of</b> the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>tractor</b> passes and contact pressure, penetration resistance and air permeability had the greatest influence on the yield of the crop. It can be concluded that in groundnut production in a sandy loam soil in a semi-arid environment, a moderate amount of soil compaction could improve the yield of groundnut...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to investigate the effect of agricultural machinery passes on soil infiltration rate. The experiment was conducted in a large covered area (Soil Hall) with the sandy loam soil type. Four compactions levels were applied: control, one, two and three tractor passes. The infiltration measurements were conducted using two methods: Simplified Falling-Head (SFH) and Mini Disk (MD). The other supporting measurements were disturbed soil samples and cone index measurements. Based on the SFH method it was observed that as the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> passes increased from 0 to 3 the infiltration rate decreased. The MD results also decreased with the increase in the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> passes. The bulk densities (at 0 - 0. 07 m depth) increased with the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>tractor</b> passes, under the conditions of soil gravimetric moisture content ranging between 14 and 18 % vol. The cone index values at the depth of 0 - 0. 05 m increased with the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> passes. When comparing the results obtained using the MD and SFH, a strong relationship was not found. It could be concluded that the SFH method might be more robust and appropriate for determining the effect <b>of</b> the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>tractor</b> passes on the soil water infiltration in these conditions...|$|R

40|$|Soil {{compaction}} is {{a common}} problem of mineral soils under conventional tillage practices. Organic matter addition is an efficient way of reducing the effects of field traffic in soil compaction. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the effects <b>of</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>tractor</b> passes (one, three, and five) on depth-dependent (0 – 10 and 10 – 20  cm) penetration resistance, bulk density, and porosity of clay-textured soil (Typic Xerofluvent) under organic vegetable cultivation practices in the 2010 – 2013 growing seasons. Fields were treated with farmyard manure (FYM, 35  t ha − 1), green manure (GM; common vetch, Vicia sativa L.), and conventional tillage (CT). The <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>tractor</b> passes resulted in increases in bulk density and penetration resistance (CT > GM > FYM), whereas the volume of total and macropores decreased. The maximum penetration resistance (3. 60  MPa) was recorded in the CT treatment with five passes at 0 – 10  cm depth, whereas the minimum (1. 64  MPa) was observed for the FYM treatment with one pass at 10 – 20  cm depth. The highest bulk density was determined as 1. 61  g cm − 3 for the CT treatment with five passes at 10 – 20  cm depth; the smallest value was 1. 25  g cm − 3 in the FYM treatment with only one pass at 0 – 10  cm depth. The highest total and macropore volumes were determined as 0. 53 and 0. 16  cm 3  cm − 3 respectively at 0 – 10  cm depth for the FYM treatment with one pass. The volume of micropores (0. 38  cm 3  cm − 3) was higher at 0 – 10  cm depth for the FYM treatment with three passes. It can be concluded that organic pre-composted organic amendment rather than green manure is likely to be more efficient in mitigating compaction problems in soil...|$|R

50|$|Portugal's overall {{agricultural}} {{performance was}} unfavorable when {{viewed in the}} context of the country's natural resources and climatic conditions. Agricultural productivity (gross farm output per person employed) was well below that of the other West European countries in 1985, at half of the levels in Greece and Spain and a quarter of the EC average. A number of factors contributed to Portugal's poor agricultural performance. First, the level of investment in agriculture was traditionally very low. The <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>tractors</b> and the quantity of fertilizer used per unit area was one-third the European Community average in the mid-1980s. Second, farms in the north were small and fragmented; half of them were less than one hectare in size, and 86 percent less than five hectares. Third, the collective farms set up in the south after the 1974-75 expropriations due to the leftist military coup of 25 April 1974, proved incapable of modernizing, and their efficiency declined. Fourth, poor productivity was associated with the low level of education of farmers. Finally, distribution channels and economic infrastructure were inadequate in parts of the country. According to government estimates, about 9,000 km2 (2,200,000 acres) of agricultural land were occupied between April 1974 and December 1975 in the name of land reform; about 32% of the occupations were ruled illegal.

40|$|Organic {{farming is}} often {{considered}} to be the most environmentally-friendly crop management system, even if integrated production also aims at decreasing the impact of agriculture on the natural environment. In order to establish references for the agro-environmental evaluation of these two production systems in relation to grape growing, INRA carried out an initial study from 2001 to 2004 at the plot scale. This study focused on two grape varieties (Merlot N and Cabernet Sauvignon) in its Couhins vineyard (Graves cru classé), located on two organically-farmed plots and two plots using integrated production, a system based on the implementation of decision rules aimed at limiting the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> pest control treatments. Production means only differed in terms of pest control management (choice of products and application strategy). Each of the parcels covered approximately 0. 30 ha. An agro-environmental evaluation of these two systems was made for 2003, using the INDIGO Vigne method at the plot level. Because of their nature, the choice of parameters for the indicators used determines the interpretation of the results. Nevertheless, it appears that the environmental impact of integrated production is more favourable in this case than that of organic farming, particularly in terms of pest control and energy indicators. One of the reasons for this is the high <b>number</b> <b>of</b> applications of pest control treatments in organic farming and, as a result, higher energy consumption, as well as the use of copper that has a major impact on deep waters, the ground and the air. The two systems can decrease their environmental impact by limiting the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>tractor</b> runs for soil maintenance. Flexibility appears to be greater in the case of integrated production since, contrary to organic farming, it can use herbicides under the row. The calculation of the agro-environmental evaluation on the parcel using integrated protection with chemical weeding under the row leads to a clear improvement of the energy indicator, without significantly decreasing the value of the pest control indicator. Natural sodding of the inter-row, when the vigour of the vineyard allows it, provides an effective solution since the decrease in the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>tractor</b> runs leads to an improvement of erosion and organic matter indicators. This type of evaluation should be carried out at the scale of a group of plots or of an entire wine-farm. Ground maintenance {{is an important factor in}} decreasing the impact of grape growing on the environment. In this respect, organic farming offers some promising prospects...|$|R
