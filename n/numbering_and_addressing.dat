40|$|<b>Numbering</b> <b>and</b> <b>addressing</b> issues arising in the Integrated Broadband Communication Network (IBCN) for {{the support}} of the Universal Mobile Telecommunication System (UMTS) and Personal Telecommunication Service (PTS) are dealt with in this paper. Mobile {{communications}} services will allow a user to roam within a network. Thus there will be a need to identify several types of objects (terminals, network points of attachment, users, Customer Premises Networks, etc.). The mobility properties of these objects will necessitate dynamic bindings between their addresses and names. Moreover, the situation is further complicated since the mobility may be embedded. A mobile user may employ a mobile terminal in a mobile Customer Premises Network (CPN). Therefore, in UMTS and PTS {{there is a need for}} dynamic binding of various identifiers with location information data. The exclusive use of Personal Telecommunication Numbers (PTN's) as Dialing Numbers (DN) is proposed in IBCN for UMTS and PTS. That is, PTN's will be used (during dialing) for making calls to mobile terminals, mobile users, as well as fixed subscribers. When the personal communication service is not provided, the DN corresponds to the terminal number of the equipment (fixed or mobile) of the called subscriber. Also, a proposal for the UMTS and PTS numbering plan is presented...|$|E
40|$|ENUM creates {{many new}} market {{opportunities}} and raises several important policy {{issues related to}} the implementation and administration of the ENUM database and services. Recent World Telecommunications Policy Forum 2001 dealt with the emergence of ENUM as an important numbering issue of IP telephony. This paper prepares some important emerging issues of ENUM administration and policy by taking an empirical research approach from the bottom up. We will identify potential key ENUM services, and estimating the size of the service market opportunities created by the availability of PSTN-IP addressing and mapping mechanisms, particularly in the context of IP telephony. Also, we analyze the possible administrative models and relationship scenarios among different ENUM players such as Registry(ies), Registrars, Telephone Service Providers, ENUM Application Service Providers, etc. Then, we will assess the effects of various administrative model architectures of ENUM service by looking at the market opportunities and motivations of the players. From the empirical findings, we will draw the implications on transactions among different kinds of ENUM service providers. Finally, the results of the model analysis will be used for the discussion of policy related issues around the ENUM and IP telephony services.

40|$|The {{intensive}} {{technological development}} of the last years brought the overall acceptance of an IP based network and services vision based on the NGN. The realization of the NGN vision, the decision on the migration to NGN sets regulatory tasks, especially {{in the area of}} <b>numbering</b> <b>and</b> <b>addressing.</b> The utilization of the opportunities provided by the NGN platform requires the use of IP addresses and names in the core network, the role of the E. 164 numbers is taken over by IP addresses. However in case of voice services the identification of end-user access points will remain by the use of E. 164 numbers. Migration to NGN doesn't require directly the change of the subscribers' phone number; however the NGN enables among others the implementation of national number portability for fixed telephone service. The opportunities can be realized by using uniform domestic number length and dialling method, practically closed numbering. The introduction of a 9 -digit uniform, closed domestic numbering provides a consistent solution for the deficiencies of the present Hungarian numbering plan, too. Recently it can be reached in single step so that the present 9 -digit domestic numbers and the short codes remain unchanged, the 8 -digit domestic numbers are completed to 9 -digit by the insertion of an appropriate digit, as well as the present and new numbering schemes can be in operation simultaneously.

40|$|ENUM {{effectively}} bridges {{the telephone}} and Internet worlds by placing telephone numbers from the ITU Rec. E. 164 public telecommunication numbering plan into the Internet Domain Name System (DNS) as domain names. ENUM potentially presents significant public policy issues at both the domestic and international levels. Ultimately, it should not matter whether ENUM is approached as a telecommunications issue or an Internet issue because: (1) they are becoming the same thing technically, and (2) they engage the same global public interests. For the same reasons as apply to traditional telecommunications, and even to the Internet itself, public oversight of ENUM naming, <b>numbering,</b> <b>and</b> <b>addressing</b> resources is justified both by technical necessity {{and the interests of}} consumer protection (particularly personal privacy) and competition at higher service layers. A single, coordinated global DNS domain for at least Tier 0 (the international level) of the ENUM names hierarchy should be designated by public authorities. Many of the technical characteristics and policy considerations relevant at the ENUM Tier 0 and 1 zones are also directly applicable to the Internet's IP address space and DNS root (or Tier 0) zone - key shared elements of the Internet's logical infrastructure. Despite the fundamentally international nature of the Internet's logical infrastructure layer, and the purported privatization of administration of its IP address space and the DNS, Internet governance is not yet truly international. The ENUM policy debate illustrates the need for authoritative international public oversight of public communications network logical infrastructure, including that of traditional telecommunications, the Internet, and ENUM.
