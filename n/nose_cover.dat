50|$|The Ca.20 {{was derived}} from the Ca.18, an {{observation}} monoplane that had been developed starting in 1913 from the previous models Ca.8 and Ca.16. It used a more powerful engine, the Rhône. It used an unusual rounded <b>nose</b> <b>cover</b> for the wooden propeller which was cowled smoothly to match the fuselage. The cover was pierced to allow cooling of the engine. The improved aerodynamics helped speed and manoeuvrability. Designed as a fighter, a Lewis machine gun was installed above the pilot, placed above the propeller disc, with an eye level sight. The first synchronization devices, which allowed a weapon to shoot with confidence through the blades of a propeller in motion, would not make their appearance until the Fokker Eindecker during 1915, although many experiments had been conducted by the French since 1913.|$|E
5000|$|The M31 HEAT is a fin-stabilized {{anti-tank}} {{rifle grenade}} {{designed in the}} late 1950s to replace the Belgian ENERGA rifle grenade which {{was adopted by the}} US Army and US Marines as an emergency stop-gap measure during the Korean War. Like the ENERGA, it has a nose-initiated, based-detonated HEAT warhead, but unlike the ENERGA, the mechanical impact fuse system is replaced with a less complex and more reliable piezo-electric fuse system which also allows higher angles of impact, up to 65 degrees. On impact, the <b>nose</b> <b>cover</b> collapses, crushing a crystal-like material, which sends an electric current through a separate wire to the warhead's detonator, located in the base of the warhead. A mechanical safety, comprising a set back system located in the warhead's base, grounds the firing circuit and prevents the accidental explosion of the warhead. On firing, the sudden launch acceleration causes the set-back's three disks to rotate 90 degrees, each in succession to the other, with the rotation of the third disk removing the grounding after approximately 10 meters of flight and completing a firing circuit for the current to flow from the nose to the detonator in the base. Compared to the ENERGA, the M31 is slightly lighter in weight and has a smaller-diameter warhead—i.e. 75mm vs 66mm. Penetration for the M31 is estimated to be 200 mm / 8 inches for steel armor plating [...] and twice that estimate for concrete. The warhead technology developed for the M31 was used for the future M72 LAW antitank rocket.|$|E
40|$|In {{patients}} with cleft lip and palate, {{a series of}} treatments have been performed to achieve a normal facial appearance and a good oronasal function. Decisions on timing and the procedure to be performed should always {{be based on the}} patient's growth. Despite successful, well-timed surgery and adequate orthodontic treatment, maxillary hypoplasia appears to be unavoidable in some {{patients with}} cleft lip and palate. Class III malocclusion and the accompanying facial deformity are treated with Le Fort I maxillary osteotomy after facial skeletal growth is completed. Maxillary osteotomy provides dramatic improvement in patient's facial appearance and occlusion; however, there is a possibility of relapse after surgery. In our retrospective evaluation, there are significant correlations between the amount of surgical movement and relapse in all directions. Because the lip and <b>nose</b> <b>cover</b> the maxilla, the movement of the maxilla influences the appearance of the lip and nose. Therefore, definitive revision of the lip and nose in cleft patients should be performed after maxillary osteotomy. At this stage, all procedures that were not done because of their effects on growth can be performed. For definitive management of the nose and lip, all strategies of reconstructive, plastic, and aesthetic surgery should be considered. A series of treatments as the patient grows after the birth is completed by these revisions...|$|E

2500|$|... {{the nasal}} skin – A tight {{envelope}} that proceeds inferiorly from the glabella (the smooth prominence between the eyebrows), which then becomes thinner and progressively inelastic (less distensible). The {{skin of the}} mid-third of the <b>nose</b> <b>covers</b> the cartilaginous dorsum and the upper lateral cartilages and is relatively elastic, but, at the (far) distal-third of the nose, the skin adheres tightly to the alar cartilages, and is little distensible. The skin and the underlying soft tissues of the alar lobule form a semi-rigid anatomic unit that maintains the graceful curve of the alar rim, and the patency (openness) of the nostrils (anterior nares). To preserve this nasal shape and patency, {{the replacement of the}} alar lobule must include a supporting cartilage graft—despite the alar lobule not originally containing cartilage; because of its many sebaceous glands, the nasal skin usually is of a smooth (oiled) texture. Moreover, regarding scarrification, when compared to the skin of other facial areas, the skin of the nose generates fine-line scars that usually are inconspicuous, which allows the surgeon to strategically hide the surgical scars.|$|R

Everywhere, there was as much fresh air as windows, well placed and opened, could possibly admit.
