5|$|In {{addition}} to the compounds where a noble gas atom {{is involved in a}} covalent bond, noble gases also form non-covalent compounds. The clathrates, first described in 1949, consist of a noble gas atom trapped within cavities of crystal lattices of certain organic and inorganic substances. The essential condition for their formation is that the guest (noble gas) atoms must be of appropriate size to fit in the cavities of the host crystal lattice. For instance, argon, krypton, and xenon form clathrates with hydroquinone, but helium and neon do <b>not</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> are too small or insufficiently polarizable to be retained. Neon, argon, krypton, and xenon also form clathrate hydrates, where the noble gas is trapped in ice.|$|E
5|$|The {{country was}} {{historically}} about evenly balanced between Catholic and Protestant, with a complex patchwork of majorities {{over most of}} the country. Geneva converted to Protestantism in 1536, just before John Calvin arrived there. It became known internationally as the Protestant Rome, being base for such reformers as Theodore Beza or William Farel. Zürich became another stronghold around the same time, with Huldrych Zwingli and Heinrich Bullinger, later joined by fleeing Peter Martyr Vermigli, taking the lead there. One canton, Appenzell, was officially divided into Catholic and Protestant sections in 1597. The larger cities and their cantons (Bern, Geneva, Lausanne, Zürich and Basel) used to be predominantly Protestant. Central Switzerland, the Valais, the Ticino, Appenzell Innerrhodes, the Jura, and Fribourg are traditionally Catholic. The Swiss Constitution of 1848, under the recent impression of the clashes of Catholic vs. Protestant cantons that culminated in the Sonderbundskrieg, consciously defines a consociational state, allowing the peaceful co-existence of Catholics and Protestants. A 1980 initiative calling for the complete {{separation of church and state}} was rejected by 78.9% of the voters. Some traditionally Protestant cantons and cities nowadays have a slight Catholic majority, <b>not</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> were growing in members, quite the contrary, but only because since about 1970 a steadily growing minority became not affiliated with any church or other religious body (21.4% in Switzerland, 2012) especially in traditionally Protestant regions, such as Basel-City (42%), canton of Neuchâtel (38%), canton of Geneva (35%), canton of Vaud (26%), or Zürich city (city: >25%; canton: 23%).|$|E

25|$|Further, {{in their}} view idols {{depicted}} persons without substance or reality while icons depicted real persons. Essentially the argument was that idols were idols because they represented false gods, <b>not</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> were images.

This was considered comparable to the Old Testament practice of only offering burnt sacrifices to God, and not to any other gods.|$|E
25|$|In June 1941, German and Italian {{consulates}} were closed, {{and there}} were suggestions Japan's should be closed, as well.

25|$|Ranks are {{assigned}} based on subjective dissimilarity, {{and do not}} fully reflect the gradational nature of variation within nature. In most cases, higher taxonomic groupings arise further back in time: not because the rate of diversification was higher in the past, but because each subsequent diversification event results in an increase of diversity and thus increases the taxonomic rank assigned by present-day taxonomists. Furthermore, some groups have many described species <b>not</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> are more diverse than other species, {{but because they are}} more easily sampled and studied than other group.|$|E

Plutarch does indeed describe Pelopidas leading the Band and catching the Spartans in disorder, but there is nothing in his account that conveys anything other than the Sacred Band being the head of the column, and the Spartans were disordered <b>not</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> were taken in the flank but because they were caught in mid-maneuver, extending their line.|$|E

Piper also believes that all Christians, Jew or Gentile, will inherit the earth, including the land of Israel, when Christ sets up the Millennial Kingdom in the Second Coming.|$|E

25|$|In recent years, women wearing hijab {{have been}} subject of verbal and {{physical}} attacks in Western countries, particularly following terrorist attacks. Louis A.

Some women stop wearing hijab out of fear or following perceived pressure from their acquaintances, but many refuse to stop wearing it out of religious conviction even when they are urged to do so for self-protection.|$|E

25|$|The {{economic}} consequences of guilds {{have led to}} heated debates among economic historians. On the one side, scholars say that since merchant guilds persisted over long periods {{they must have been}} efficient institutions (since inefficient institutions die out). Others say they persisted <b>not</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> benefited the entire economy but because they benefited the owners, who used political power to protect them. Ogilvie (2011) says they regulated trade for their own benefit, were monopolies, distorted markets, fixed prices, and restricted entrance into the guild. Ogilvie (2008) argues that their long apprenticeships were unnecessary to acquire skills, and their conservatism reduced the rate of innovation and made the society poorer. She says their main goal was rent seeking, that is, to shift money to the membership {{at the expense of the}} entire economy.|$|E
25|$|In {{all three}} accounts, after Jesus {{got into the}} ship, the wind ceased and they reached the shore. Only John's account has their ship {{immediately}} reach the shore. Matthew's and Mark's accounts end at this point, but John mentions that the next day some people {{from the other side}} of the sea that looked for Jesus, noted that the disciples left without him, but they didn't know where he went. When they came to Capernaum and asked Jesus how he came there, instead of answering the question, he told the crowd that they followed him, <b>not</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> had seen signs, but because of the free loaves they had eaten the day before, and he advised them not to seek earthly gains, but aim for a life based on higher spiritual values.|$|E
25|$|Males are {{produced}} less frequently and in less quantity than females {{are produced}}. After eclosion males {{remain on the}} nest {{for up to a}} week. Upon leaving, they live nomadically and mate with females of other nests. Males do not assist in any of the colony maintenance activities while they reside in the nest. They are not well suited for foraging or defending the colony because of their weaker mandibles and lack of a stinger. They are dependent on female workers feeding them and are sometimes observed to cannibalize nest larvae. It has been experimentally demonstrated that males of R. marginata have the ability to feed larvae, but they do <b>not</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> lack food access and females do not give them an opportunity to do so in natural populations.|$|E
