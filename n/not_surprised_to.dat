5|$|Tomlinson's {{death was}} {{confirmed}} {{in a statement}} that accused protesters of having hampered police efforts to save his life. His family were not told he had died until nine hours after his death. The police and IPCC told journalists that his family were <b>not</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> hear he had had a heart attack. Journalists who asked whether police had had any contact with Tomlinson were asked not to speculate in case it upset the family. Direct contact with the family was refused. The police issued a statement on behalf of the family instead, which said the police were keeping them informed.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the strangest}} moments in Zakharov's career {{occurred}} in late 1990, when, {{as a member of}} the parliamentary Australian Security Intelligence Organisation committee, she was given access to her own intelligence file. She was <b>not</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> discover that ASIO had shown interest in her membership of the Communist Party while at university; what she was not prepared for was a detailed investigation the organisation had made in 1963, after becoming concerned that John Zakharov was a bigamist. A less-than-impressed Zakharov speculated at the time that the contents of her file may have cost her at least one public service position during the 1970s.|$|E
500|$|Ruck had {{previously}} auditioned for the Bender role in The Breakfast Club which went to Judd Nelson, but Hughes remembered Ruck and cast {{him as the}} 17-year-old Cameron Frye. According to Hughes, the character of Cameron was largely based on {{a friend of his}} in high school. [...] "He was sort of a lost person. His family neglected him, so he took that as license to really pamper himself. When he was legitimately sick, he actually felt good, because it was difficult and tiring to have to invent diseases but when he actually had something, he was relaxed." [...] Ruck said the role of Cameron had originally been offered to Emilio Estevez who turned it down. [...] "Every time I see Emilio, I want to kiss him", said Ruck. [...] "Thank you!" [...] Ruck, then 29, worried about the age difference. [...] "I was worried that I'd be 10 years out of step, and I wouldn't know anything about what was cool, what was hip, all that junk. But when I was going to high school, I didn't know any of that stuff then, either. So I just thought, well, hell—I'll just be me. The character, he's such a loner that he really wouldn't give a damn about that stuff anyway. He'd feel guilty that he didn't know it, but that's it." [...] Ruck was <b>not</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> find himself cast young. [...] "No, because, really, when I was 18, I sort of looked 12", he said. [...] "Maybe it's a genetic imbalance." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{contrast}} to the film's detractors, Boxoffice Magazine journalist Pete Hammond said the film was [...] "brilliantly cast" [...] and labeled it a [...] "crackerjack powerhouse of a movie that shines a light on the financial machinations". He stated that Douglas does not lose any of the substance of Gekko and LaBeouf is firm as Jacob. The writer predicted the Wall Street sequel's box office performance would be brisk, while the prospects were assured on DVD. Andrew O'Hehir's of Salon.com reviewed the film from Cannes, calling it an [...] "ambitious, uneven, surprisingly talky melodrama, which mixes a quasi-documentary approach to the crash of 2008 with the story." [...] O'Hehir's considered the film to express a more [...] "personal, intimate sense of moral hazard". Marshall Fine, writing in the Huffington Post, viewed the film as an [...] "overstuffed blend of agitprop and melodrama" [...] that contains a cautionary story pertaining to unchecked capitalism. He considered Stone to be proclaiming a message of the [...] "cancerous effects of greed". Bill Goodykoontz of Arizona Republic admitted that he was <b>not</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> see that the sequel is not as effective as its predecessor, though it was an engaging film {{at the top of}} its game when it is hostile, and less satisfying during romantic parts. He ended by saying {{that it is not a}} [...] "great movie", but explained that it is an [...] "effective commentary on what greed cost" [...] everyone. CEO of Tullett Prebon, Terry Smith, one of the largest inter-dealer money brokers in the world, reviewed the movie for Today on BBC Radio 4. He gave it three out of five saying that, although it was [...] "a little bit corny in some respects", it puts the events of the credit crunch into context and that [...] "it rings reasonably true," [...] capturing some of the activities, the moods and the individuals quite well." ...|$|E

2500|$|Rick Santorum, who {{was enjoying}} {{a surge in}} the polls {{following}} his narrow second-place finish in the Iowa Caucuses, clashed with Mitt Romney over comments he had made that the country didn't need a CEO or manager as President. Santorum said, [...] "We need a leader... someone who, has the experience {{to go out and}} be the commander-in-chief... The commander-in-chief of this country isn't a CEO. It's someone who has to lead... being the president is not a CEO... You've got to lead and inspire." [...] Romney responded, [...] "I think people who spend their life in Washington don't understand what happens out in the real economy. They think that people who start businesses are just managers. The chance to lead in free enterprise is extraordinarily critical to also being able to lead a state, like I led in Massachusetts and, by the way, lead the Olympics. My experience is in leadership." [...] Newt Gingrich then criticised Romney's record at Bain Capital, saying [...] "I'm very much for free enterprise... I'm not nearly as enamored of a Wall Street model where you can flip companies, you can go in and have leveraged buyouts, you can basically take out all the money, leaving behind the workers." [...] Romney replied, [...] "I'm <b>not</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> have The New York Times try and put free enterprise on trial. I'm <b>not</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> have the Obama administration do that, either. It's a little surprising from my colleagues on this stage." ...|$|E

2500|$|Brian Lowry of Variety {{gave the}} show a {{negative}} review saying, [...] "Like so many former primetime titans, it's perplexing to see Barr reduced to this [...] " [...] and [...] "Why Barr wanted {{to participate in}} this sort of [...] "celebreality" [...] unscripted sitcom—especially if she hates Hollywood as much as she says—is a little less obvious, especially since she professes not to need the money and, given her syndication bounty, shouldn't". David Hinckley of the Daily News gave it two out of five stars. He said, [...] "Roseanne fans will be reassured, though <b>not</b> <b>surprised,</b> <b>to</b> hear that she sounds and acts exactly the same on the plantation as she did on her sitcom set".|$|E
2500|$|On 16 January, it was {{announced}} that the church had had its listing upgraded to Grade 1 status. Announcing the decision, Andrew Derrick stated:"Grade I is the right grade for St. Laurence's Church and it confirms it as a very important building. Only the two per cent most important buildings in the country are Grade I listed so now the church is in the same bracket as the most important buildings. This means that demolishing the church would be unthinkable. Any decision on moving the church will {{have to go through the}} local planning authority, but being Grade I listed will make a difference on how people view the building." [...] On hearing the news, airport director Roger Campbell stated:"The decision was simple – the church has to move if the airport is to survive. Thousands of jobs, which could be created if expansion plans go ahead, will be lost. It is not just a case of expansion. We have to comply with safety standards set down by the Civil Aviation Authority and they must be implemented. The future hinges on these plans." [...] The vicar of the church, Rev. Nigel Ransom, was delighted at the news."I was <b>not</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>to</b> hear from English Heritage that the church has been upgraded to a Grade I listed building. It is a unique and historic place. For more than 1,000 years the church has stood on this site undisturbed. It is shrouded in history and is truly a magnificent example of architecture. The decision by English Heritage will certainly make it more difficult for any plans to move the church. The local community is firmly against any changes and so am I." ...|$|E
