25|$|Wankel engines {{generally}} {{are able to}} reach much higher engine revolutions than reciprocating engines of similar power output. This {{is due to the}} smoothness inherent in circular motion, and the absence of highly stressed parts such as crankshafts, camshafts or connecting rods. Eccentric shafts do not have the stress related contours of crankshafts. The maximum revolutions of a rotary engine is limited by tooth load on the synchronizing gears. Hardened steel gears are used for extended operation above 7000 or 8000rpm. Mazda Wankel engines in auto racing are operated above 10,000rpm. In aircraft they are used conservatively, up to 6500 or 7500rpm. However, as gas pressure participates in seal efficiency, racing a Wankel engine at high rpm under <b>no</b> <b>load</b> conditions can destroy the engine.|$|E

500|$|Rare {{evolved from}} Ultimate Play the Game, {{which was founded}} in Ashby-de-la-Zouch, Leicestershire by former arcade game {{developers}} Tim and Chris Stamper. After multiple critically and commercially successful releases including Jetpac, Atic Atac, Sabre Wulf, and Knight Lore, Ultimate Play The Game was among one of the biggest UK-based video game development companies. The ZX Spectrum home computer, the platform the company usually developed games for, was only popular in the UK, and they believed that working on that platform would not be beneficial to the company's growth as they considered it a [...] "dead end". Meanwhile, the company inspected an imported console from Japan, the Famicom, and believed that it would be an ideal future platform of choice for the company as it was more sophisticated than the Spectrum, had a worldwide market, and its cartridges had <b>no</b> <b>load</b> times. As a result, Rare was established in 1985. Its main goal was to reverse-engineer the console and investigate the codes for Famicom's games {{to learn more about the}} console's programming. With successful results, the company decided to sell the Ultimate brand to U.S. Gold, and ceased games development for the ZX Spectrum in the following year.|$|E

The magazine also felt that while the collecting of supplies added strategy to the action, the limited amount restricted the paths the player might take through the level. Another critic said the [...] "real-time, living battlefield enhances the urgency of the missions and the player's involvement" [...] and also noted [...] "practically <b>no</b> <b>load</b> time." [...] GameFan complained of a high difficulty and a steep curve, long levels which return the player to the beginning should he die, infrequent opportunities to repair armour and the enemies' tendency to attack the player from beyond his limited viewpoint, and was thankful for the Saturn version's optional easier difficulty setting. Next Generation also criticised the player's restricted view, calling it the game's [...] "worst problem". One reviewer said revisiting levels to discover missed set pieces aided the game's longevity; Sega Saturn Magazine had [...] "some reservations" [...] about the game's replay-value, with only 5 missions, but said it was [...] "very playable and enjoyable", while another reviewer called it [...] "a load of fun". Gerstmann criticised the poor scrolling, erratic motion and imprecise control, Great Drakon praised the controls, while GameFan noted they had improved in the Saturn version. The reviewer also enjoyed this version's new weaponry. Another reviewer pointed to some [...] "minor flaws", saying the HUD [...] "smacks of 16-bit era graphics"; The game impressed Great Drakons reviewer, who praised the attention to detail and the reviewer found the story convincing. IGN said: [...] "Everything about this game is great.

500|$|Noise testing during 1996 and 1997 {{found that}} the {{hydrodynamic}} noise signature—the noise made by a submarine passing through the water—was excessive, particularly at high speed. The shape of the hull was the main cause: although a scale model of the design had been tested during the funded study and {{was found to have}} a minimal signature, the hull shape was changed after the contract was signed, primarily by a [...] lengthening of the submarine and a redesign of the bow dome to accommodate the larger-than-expected main sonar and reduce its blind spot (the baffles). The design had not been retested, as who would pay for this could not be agreed on. Propeller cavitation, caused by water flow over control surfaces onto the propeller at certain speeds, was the other main noisemaker. Cavitation had not been a problem with earlier Swedish submarine designs or during early testing of the Type 471 design, but the propeller had to be redesigned late in the process to provide more power, and like the redesigned hull, was not retested. During the years 2000, an unusual meeting took place with a next door neighbor (Francis 'Frank' Smith)of the then HMAS Stirling Naval Base commander. He was an Aircraft Maintenance Engineer (originally trained at Government Aircraft Factories Fisherman's bend) who had been aware of the fluid dynamics issues of the Collins class for some time, purely by interest and observation on television. After a lengthy discussion, he was invited to discuss and demonstrate where possible, his observations at the Stirling Naval Base with Navy and DSTO staff who were there at that time as part of an investigative group. He showed on a white board, the aerofoil issue with the Dorsal – Sail conning tower structure showing that the Cord ratio (Length to Width) was too short and that severe turbulence / cavitation would be generated by such a design. This was demonstrated again on the white board using Aircraft aerofoil wing shapes as a basis for the discussion. That the turbulence / cavitation generated would, by natural rearward flow, move down the rear upper surface deck of the hull and be drawn into the propeller. He was also able to demonstrate that the design of the bow section would not pass a flow test for generated turbulence / cavitation, with the change in shape from circular bow section to long hull, being ill-conceived. He made several recommendations during the lecture that would be cost effective and possible. 1) To lengthen and taper the dorsal fin and create a more streamlined integration of the Dorsal to Flat upper Hull deck section. and 2) To 'fill in' the hollow section of hull aft of the bow curvature. Both these could be achieved with Carbon Fibre or Fibreglass covers as <b>no</b> <b>load</b> bearing strength would be required. Subsequent studies by the Defence Science and Technology Organization showed that the submarine's hull shape, particularly the redesigned sonar dome, the fin, and the rear of the submarine, focused the displaced water into two turbulent streams; when the seven propeller blades hit these streams, the propeller's vibration was increased, causing cavitation. These problems were fixed by modifying the casing of the submarine with fiberglass fairings.|$|E
