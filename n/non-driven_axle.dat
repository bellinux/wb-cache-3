5000|$|One leading idle (<b>non-driven)</b> <b>axle</b> {{mounted in}} a bogie, four driven axles {{mounted in the}} frame and {{connected}} by driving rods or gears, followed one trailing idle axle mounted in a bogie (Whyte notation: 2-8-2).|$|E
50|$|The {{foremost}} axle on the {{tandem axle}} is powered. When fully loaded, the K-44 carries approximately 62% {{of the weight}} lying on the tandem axle. The rear, <b>non-driven</b> <b>axle,</b> {{is linked to the}} driven axle through a simple sub-assembly consisting of 3.5 in wide and 1500 mm long leaf springs and rocker arms. When the torque delivered to the rear axle is increased, the mechanism automatically shifts vehicle weight away from the <b>non-driven</b> <b>axle</b> to the driven axle, improving traction when most needed. Additionally, more of the weight can be moved to the driven axle manually using an electro hydraulic system. In order to reduce fuel consumption and tyre wear the non-driven rear axle can also be raised completely off the road/surface, if a third load-bearing axle is not needed because the vehicle is running empty: running on just two axles also reduces the K-44's turning circle.|$|E
5000|$|The Class ED62 {{locomotives}} {{were created}} between 1974 and 1979 by modifying the 18 earlier JNR Class ED61 Bo-Bo electric locomotives {{with the addition}} of a centre <b>non-driven</b> <b>axle.</b> Rebuilding was carried out at JNR's Nagano Works. The primary aim of rebuilding was to reduce the axle load (from 15 t to 13 t) for use on the Iida Line, where the class displaced vintage [...] (English Electric) and JNR Class ED19 (Westinghouse) locomotives, and later JNR Class EF10 locomotives.|$|E
5000|$|... 1985-2001: {{straight}} <b>non-driven</b> front <b>axle</b> for {{two-wheel drive}} only ...|$|R
50|$|The K-44 was 27% more {{expensive}} than the corresponding Sisu K-34 6×2 with a <b>non-driven</b> front <b>axle</b> and same capacity.|$|R
50|$|Sisu Axles' core {{business}} are planetary reduction <b>axles</b> but also <b>non-driven</b> steering <b>axles</b> are produced. Both {{the front and}} rear axles are for single and multi axle applications. The main segments are heavy-duty trucks for on- and off-road use and also industrial and military applications.|$|R
5000|$|Sesspir - In 1984-85 the CSIR {{developed}} a prototype Casspir with six wheels. An additional <b>non-driven</b> <b>axle</b> was fitted {{in front of}} the front drive axle, this to be sacrificed {{in the event of a}} landmine detonation. It steered along with the regular driven front wheels and was equipped with winch cables to hoist either side of the axle clear off the ground in the event of the loss of a wheel. The theory being the vehicle would remain mobile. The idea was shelved as one of numerous problems was simply a lack of power from the engine to push the undriven axle along through bush and soft sand. Only one prototype was built.|$|E
5000|$|The wheel size is 7.5-20" [...] {{and each}} wheel {{is held in}} place with ten nuts. Both axles on the bogie are fitted with double wheels as {{standard}} other than on the K-44ST, which made do with single wheels on the <b>non-driven</b> rearmost <b>axle.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Sisu K-44 was {{expressly}} {{designed for}} good rough-terrain capability. The vehicle's ability to grip on {{many types of}} terrain and retain traction on steep slopes is further enhanced by a mechanism whereby the <b>non-driven</b> rear <b>axle</b> could be raised, thus maximising the proportion of vehicle weight available to push down on the driven axle {{at the front of}} the tandem axle. On a surface with friction coefficient of μ=0.65 its maximum gradeability is 86%. A corresponding 6×4-model has a 55% and a 6×2-model just a 29% gradeability.|$|R
50|$|The driven truck axles {{are with}} {{planetary}} reduction, single axle capacity being 10-14 tonnes for steering and 10-20.5 tonnes for non-steering axles; the tandem configurations for the steering axles are rated to 20-28 tonnes and non-steering 20-41 tonnes. The non-steering axles {{are also available}} as tridem configurations with 39-61.5 tonnes. The capacities of steering, non driven axles are between 8 and 12 tonnes. Some <b>non-driven,</b> non-steering <b>axles</b> with a capacity of 13 tonnes {{are also in the}} selection. The non-steering axles are with S-cam drum brakes, whereas some of the steering axles are equipped with disc or wedge brakes.|$|R
50|$|Single axle {{semi-trailers}} were {{commonly used}} for log transportation in Finland in the 1960s. The maximum axle load of the existing 4×4 Sisu K-40 was often exceeded in logging work. The solution was a truck incorporating {{the addition of a}} <b>non-driven</b> third <b>axle</b> at the back, paired in a tandem axle with the rear driven axle. The new model, the Sisu K-44, was introduced in 1959, with a choice of engine sizes for both the middle-weight ("Kontio") and the heavy ("Jyry") classes. The K-44's driven front axle and transfer case were borrowed from the existing K-40, while the bogie, of which only the first axle was driven, came from the K-34. This drivetrain layout, called 4×4+2, is seldom seen outside Finland. However, Vanajan Autotehdas, SAT's main domestic competitor, had already introduced a similarly configured vehicle a year earlier.|$|R
