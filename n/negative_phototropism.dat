50|$|Phototropism is {{the growth}} of an {{organism}} which responds to a light stimulus. It is most often observed in plants, but can also occur in other organisms such as fungi. The cells on the plant that are farthest from the light have a chemical called auxin that reacts when phototropism occurs. This causes the plant to have elongated cells on the farthest side from the light. Phototropism {{is one of the}} many plant tropisms or movements which respond to external stimuli. Growth towards a light source is called positive phototropism, while growth away from light is called <b>negative</b> <b>phototropism</b> (skototropism). Most plant shoots exhibit positive phototropism, and rearrange their chloroplasts in the leaves to maximize photosynthetic energy and promote growth. Roots usually exhibit <b>negative</b> <b>phototropism,</b> although gravitropism may play a larger role in root behavior and growth. Some vine shoot tips exhibit <b>negative</b> <b>phototropism,</b> which allows them to grow towards dark, solid objects and climb them. The combination of phototropism and gravitropism allow plants to grow in the correct direction.|$|E
50|$|A vine {{displays}} a growth form based on long stems. This has two purposes. A vine may use rock exposures, other plants, or other supports for growth rather than investing energy {{in a lot}} of supportive tissue, enabling the plant to reach sunlight with a minimum investment of energy. This has been a highly successful growth form for plants such as kudzu and Japanese honeysuckle, both of which are invasive exotics in parts of North America. There are some tropical vines that develop skototropism, and grow away from the light, a type of <b>negative</b> <b>phototropism.</b> Growth away from light allows the vine to reach a tree trunk, which it can then climb to brighter regions.|$|E
50|$|The most {{important}} distinction is their growth pattern, lacking a lateral meristem (cambium) {{that allows for}} continual growth in diameter with height (secondary growth), and therefore this characteristic is a basic limitation in shoot construction. Although largely herbaceous, some arboraceous monocots reach great height, length and mass. The latter include agaves, palms, pandans, and bamboos. This creates challenges in water transport that monocots deal with in various ways. Some, such as species of Yucca, develop anomalous secondary growth, while palm trees utilise an anomalous primary growth form described as establishment growth (see Vascular system). The axis undergoes primary thickening, that progresses from internode to internode, resulting in a typical inverted conical shape of the basal primary axis (see Tillich, Figure 1). The limited conductivity also contributes to limited branching of the stems. Despite these limitations {{a wide variety of}} adaptive growth forms has resulted (Tillich, Figure 2) from epiphytic orchids (Asparagales) and bromeliads (Poales) to submarine Alismatales (including the reduced Lemnoideae) and mycotrophic Burmanniaceae (Dioscreales) and Triuridaceae (Pandanales). Other forms of adaptation include the climbing vines of Araceae (Alismatales) which use <b>negative</b> <b>phototropism</b> (skototropism) to locate host trees (i.e. the darkest area), while some palms such as Calamus manan (Arecales) produce the longest shoots in the plant kingdom, up to 185 m long. Other monocots, particularly Poales, have adopted a therophyte life form.|$|E

40|$|The main {{aim of this}} diploma thesis was {{creation}} of functional experiments and supporting teaching materials {{for high school students}} which would clearly demonstrate the processes of photomorphogenesis in plants. Proposed experiments had to be verified in practice {{on the basis of their}} reliability, repeatability and reproducibility in schools. It was necessary to drew up the educational materials for each experiment focused on observation of photomorphogenesis plant's reactions. These materials give students the basics of scientific work and specifically they increase the interest in experimental plant biology. The first part of the thesis is literary introduction that provides the theoretical background to the topic of photomorphogenesis for teachers. It summarizes the current of the art mechanisms and manifestations of photomorphogenesis processes of plants. The second didactic part of the introduction deals with the framing up teaching of plant physiology into current curricula of education in the Czech Republic.

40|$|Plants can {{be adapted}} to the {{changing}} environments through tropic responses, such as light and gravity. One of them is root <b>negative</b> <b>phototropism,</b> which is needed for root growth and nutrient absorption. Here, we show that the auxin efflux carrier PIN-FORMED (PIN) 1 is involved in asymmetric auxin distribution and root <b>negative</b> <b>phototropism.</b> In darkness, PIN 1 is internalized and localized to intracellular compartments; upon blue light illumination, PIN 1 relocalize to basal plasma membrane in root stele cells. The shift of PIN 1 localization induced by blue light is involved in asymmetric auxin distribution and root negative phototropic response. Both blue-light-induced PIN 1 redistribution and root <b>negative</b> <b>phototropism</b> is mediated by a BFA-sensitive trafficking pathway and the activity of PID/PP 2 A.

All the adventitious roots and their branch roots bent away from light with a maximum curvature of approximately 88. 5 °. Blue-violet light prominently induced <b>negative</b> <b>phototropism</b> while red light had no effect. The root cap was the site of photo perception. Roots with shaded or divested root caps exposed to unilateral light showed no <b>negative</b> <b>phototropism,</b> but resumed their original characteristics when the shade was removed or when new root caps grew. The curvature increased when the light intensity ranged 0 – 110 μmol · m− 2 · s− 1. The <b>negative</b> <b>phototropism</b> curvature could be promoted by exogenous CaCl 2 but was inhibited by exogenous LaCl 3; exogenous CaCl 2 could reduce the inhibitory effect of LaCl 3. Unilateral light induced the horizontal transport of IAA from the irradiated side to the shaded side, resulting in an unequal distribution of IAA in both the sides, leading to <b>negative</b> <b>phototropism.</b> The horizontal transport of IAA was promoted by exogenous Ca 2 + but inhibited by exogenous La 3 +...|$|E
40|$|Gravitropism and {{phototropism}} of {{the primary}} inflorescence stems were examined in a dominant Aux/IAA mutant of Arabidopsis, axr 2 /iaa 7, which did not display either tropism in hypocotyls. axr 2 - 1 stems completely lacked gravitropism in the dark but slowly regained it in light condition. Though wild-type stems showed positive phototropism, axr 2 stems displayed <b>negative</b> <b>phototropism</b> with essentially the same light fluence-response curve as the wild type (WT). Application of 1 -naphthaleneacetic acid-containing lanolin to the stem tips enhanced the positive phototropism of WT, and reduced the <b>negative</b> <b>phototropism</b> of axr 2. Decapitation of stems caused a small <b>negative</b> <b>phototropism</b> in WT, but {{did not affect the}} <b>negative</b> <b>phototropism</b> of axr 2. p-glycoprotein 1 (pgp 1) pgp 19 double mutants showed no phototropism, while decapitated double mutants exhibited <b>negative</b> <b>phototropism.</b> Expression of auxin-responsive IAA 14 /SLR, IAA 19 /MSG 2 and SAUR 50 genes was reduced in axr 2 and pgp 1 pgp 19 stems relative to that of WT. These suggest that the phototropic response of stem is proportional to the auxin supply from the shoot apex, and that <b>negative</b> <b>phototropism</b> may be a basal response to unilateral blue-light irradiation when the levels of auxin or auxin signaling are reduced to the minimal level in the primary stems. In contrast, all of these treatments reduced or did not affect gravitropism in wild-type or axr 2 stems. Tropic responses of the transgenic lines that expressed axr 2 - 1 protein by the endodermis-specific promoter suggest that AXR 2 -dependent auxin response in the endodermis plays a more crucial role in gravitropism than in phototropism in stems but no significant roles in either tropism in hypocotyls...|$|E

40|$|Phototropism {{as well as}} {{gravitropism}} {{plays a role in}} the oriented {{growth of}} roots in flowering plants.

In blue or white light, roots exhibit <b>negative</b> <b>phototropism,</b> but red light induces positive phototropism.

40|$|Light {{promotes}} {{the expression of}} PHYTOCHROME KINASE SUBSTRATE 1 (PKS 1) in the root of Arabidopsis thaliana, but the function of PKS 1 in this organ is unknown. Unilateral blue light induced a negative root phototropic response mediated by phototropin 1 in wild-type seedlings. This response was absent in pks 1 mutants. In the wild type, unilateral blue light enhanced PKS 1 expression in the subapical region of the root several hours before bending was detectable. The <b>negative</b> <b>phototropism</b> and the enhanced PKS 1 expression in response to blue light required phytochrome A (phyA). In addition, the pks 1 mutation enhanced the root gravitropic response when vertically oriented seedlings were placed horizontally. The negative regulation of gravitropism by PKS 1 occurred even in dark-grown seedlings and did not require phyA. Blue light also failed to induce <b>negative</b> <b>phototropism</b> in pks 1 under reduced gravitational stimulation, indicating {{that the effect of}} pks 1 on phototropism is not simply the consequence of the counteracting effect of enhanced gravitropism. We propose a model where the background level of PKS 1 reduces gravitropism. After a phyA-dependent increase in its expression, PKS 1 positively affects root phototropism and both effects contribute to negative curvature in response to unilateral blue light...|$|E

40|$|The {{interaction}} of tropisms {{is important in}} determining the final growth form of the plant body. In roots, gravitropism is the predominant tropistic response, but phototropism also {{plays a role in}} the oriented growth of roots in flowering plants. In blue or white light, roots exhibit <b>negative</b> <b>phototropism</b> that is mediated by the phototropin family of photoreceptors. In contrast, red light induces a positive phototropism in Arabidopsis roots. Because this red-light-induced response is weak relative to both gravitropism and <b>negative</b> <b>phototropism,</b> we used a novel device to study phototropism without the complications of a counteracting gravitational stimulus. This device is based on a computer-controlled system using real-time image analysis of root growth and a feedback-regulated rotatable stage. Our data show that this system is useful to study root phototropism in response to red light, because in wild-type roots, the maximal curvature detected with this apparatus is 30 ° to 40 °, compared with 5 ° to 10 ° without the feedback system. In positive root phototropism, sensing of red light occurs in the root itself and is not dependent on shoot-derived signals resulting from light perception. Phytochrome (Phy) A and phyB were severely impaired in red-light-induced phototropism, whereas the phyD and phyE mutants were normal in this response. Thus, PHYA and PHYB {{play a key role in}} mediating red-light-dependent positive phototropism in roots. Although phytochrome has been shown to mediate phototropism in some lower plant groups, this is one of the few reports indicating a phytochrome-dependent phototropism in flowering plants...|$|E

40|$|Plants are photoautotrophic sessile {{organisms that}} use {{environmental}} cues to optimize multiple facets {{of growth and}} development. A classic example is phototropism - in shoots this is typically positive, leading to growth towards the light, while roots frequently show <b>negative</b> <b>phototropism</b> triggering growth away from the light. Shoot phototropism optimizes light capture of leaves in low light environments and hence increases photosynthetic productivity. Phototropins are plasma-membrane-associated UV-A/blue-light activated kinases that trigger phototropic growth. Light perception liberates their protein kinase domain from the inhibitory action of the amino-terminal photosensory portion of the photoreceptor. Following a series of still poorly understood events, phototropin activation leads {{to the formation of}} a gradient of the growth hormone auxin across the photo-stimulated stem. The greater auxin concentration on the shaded compared with the lit side of the stem enables growth reorientation towards the light.

Therefore, in this study, we report on tropistic responses in lateral roots of Arabidopsis thaliana. Lateral roots initially are plagiogravitropic, but when they reach a length of approximately 10 mm, these roots grow downward and exhibit positive orthogravitropism. Light and electron microscopic studies demonstrate a correlation between positive gravitropism and development of columella cells with large, sedimented amyloplasts in wild-type plants. Lateral roots display <b>negative</b> <b>phototropism</b> in response to white and blue light and positive phototropism in response to red light.

To our knowledge, this is the first report of phototropism of lateral roots in any plant species...|$|E

Phototropic curvature away from the light, on the other hand, developed in the central elongation zone, more basal than the site of initiation of gravitropic curvature. The phototropic curvature saturated at approximately 10 micromoles m- 2 s- 1 blue light with a peak curvature of 29 +/- 4 degrees, in part due to induction of positive gravitropism following displacement of the root tip from vertical during <b>negative</b> <b>phototropism.</b> However, at higher fluence rates, development of phototropic curvature is arrested even if gravitropism is avoided by maintaining the root cap vertically using a rotating feedback system.

40|$|UV-B {{radiation}} {{is an important}} part of the electromagnetic spectrum emitted by the sun. For much of the period of biological evolution organisms have been exposed to UV radiation, and have developed diverse mechanisms to cope with this potential stress factor. Roots are usually shielded from exposure to UV by the surrounding soil, but may nevertheless be exposed to high energy radiationon the soil surface. Due to their high sensitivity to UV-B radiation, plant roots need to respond rapidly in order to minimize exposure on the surface. In addition to root gravitropism, effective light perception by roots has recently been discovered to be essential for triggering negative root phototropism in Arabidopsis. However, it is not fully understood how UV-B affects root growth and phototropism. Here, we report that UV-B induces rapid generation of reactive oxygen species which in turn promotes the formation of BFA-induced compartments in the Arabidopsis root apex. During unilateral UV-B irradiation of roots changes in auxin concentration on the illuminated side have been recorded. In conclusion, UV-B-induced and ROS-mediated stimulation of vesicle recycling promotes root growth and induces <b>negative</b> <b>phototropism...</b>|$|E

40|$|In nature roots grow in {{the dark}} and away from light (<b>negative</b> <b>phototropism).</b> However, most current {{research}} in root biology has been carried out with the root system grown in the presence of light. Here, we have engineered a device, called Dark-Root (D-Root), to grow plants in vitro with the aerial part exposed to the normal light/dark photoperiod while the roots are in the dark or exposed to specific wavelengths or light intensities. D-Root provides an efficient system for cultivating a large number of seedlings and easily characterizing root architecture in the dark. At the morphological level, root illumination shortens root length and promotes early emergence of lateral roots, therefore inducing expansion of the root system. Surprisingly, root illumination also affects shoot development, including flowering time. Our analyses also show that root illumination alters the proper response to hormones or abiotic stress (e. g. salt or osmotic stress) and nutrient starvation, enhancing inhibition of root growth. In conclusion, D-Root provides a growing system closer to the natural one for assaying Arabidopsis plants, and therefore its use will contribute {{to a better understanding of}} the mechanisms involved in root development, hormonal signaling and stress responses...|$|E
40|$|Root {{gravitropism}} in wild-type Arabidopsis {{and in two}} starchless mutants, pgm 1 - 1 and adg 1 - 1, {{was evaluated}} {{as a function of}} light position to determine the relative strengths of <b>negative</b> <b>phototropism</b> and of gravitropism and how much phototropism affects gravitropic measurements. Gravitropism was stronger than phototropism in some but not all light positions in wild-type roots grown for an extended period, indicating that {{the relationship between the two}} tropisms is more complex than previously reported. Root phototropism significantly influenced the time course of gravitropic curvature and the two measures of sensitivity. Light from above during horizontal exposure overestimated all three parameters for all three genotypes except the wild-type perception time. At the irradiance used (80 micromol m(- 2) s(- 1)), the shortest periods of illumination found to exaggerate gravitropism were 45 min of continuous illumination and 2 -min doses of intermittent illumination. By growing roots in circumlateral light or by gravistimulating in the dark, corrected values were obtained for each gravitropic parameter. Roots of both starchless mutants were determined to be about three times less sensitive than prior estimates.

Null mutations in phylogenetically related Arabidopsis thaliana genes MILDEW RESISTANCE LOCUS O 4 (MLO 4) and MLO 11, encoding heptahelical, plasma membrane–localized proteins predominantly expressed in the root tip, result in aberrant root thigmomorphogenesis. mlo 4 and mlo 11 mutant plants show anisotropic, chiral root expansion manifesting as tightly curled root patterns upon contact with solid surfaces. The defect in mlo 4 and mlo 11 mutants is nonadditive and dependent on light and nutrients. Genetic epistasis experiments demonstrate that the mutant phenotype is independently modulated by the Gβ subunit of the heterotrimeric G-protein complex. Analysis of expressed chimeric MLO 4 /MLO 2 proteins revealed that the C-terminal domain of MLO 4 is necessary but not sufficient for MLO 4 action in root thigmomorphogenesis. The expression of the auxin efflux carrier fusion, PIN 1 -green fluorescent protein, the pattern of auxin-induced gene expression, and acropetal as well as basipetal auxin transport are altered at the root tip of mlo 4 mutant seedlings. Moreover, addition of auxin transport inhibitors or the loss of EIR 1 /AGR 1 /PIN 2 function abolishes root curling of mlo 4, mlo 11, and wild-type seedlings. These results demonstrate that the exaggerated root curling phenotypes of the mlo 4 and mlo 11 mutants depend on auxin gradients and suggest that MLO 4 and MLO 11 cofunction as modulators of touch-induced root tropism...|$|E
40|$|Plant organs grow toward or {{away from}} gravity {{as a way to}} orient those organs for {{optimizing}} growth. Starch has long been thought to be important in sensing the direction of the g-vector in gravitropism, but that hypothesis has also evoked controversy. We have previously shown that starch-deficient mutants of Arabidopsis (TC 7) and Nicotiana (NS 458) are impaired in their gravitropism. While this suggests that starch is not necessary for reduced gravitropism, it also indicates that the mass of the starch contributes to sensing when present and thus is necessary for full gravitropic sensitivity. The research supported by this grant focused on three related projects, (1) the effect of light on hypocotyl gravitropism in NS 458, (2) the effects of root phototropism on measurements of gravitropic sensitivity, and (3) the effects of starch overproduction on sedimentation and gravitropism. Collectively, our results provide additional strong support for the importance of starch in gravitropic sensing. First, by accounting for <b>negative</b> <b>phototropism</b> in roots of two starchless mutants of Arabidopsis we have established that these mutants are much less sensitive to gravity than previously thought. This work also demonstrates the importance of designing experimental protocols that remove the influence of root phototropism on measuring root gravitropism. Second, light apparently promotes gravitropism in starch-deficient Nicotiana hypocotyls by increasing the trace amounts of starch in the plastids, by inducing limited plastid sedimentation and thus by presumably increasing the signal provided by plastid mass. And finally, we show that excess starch in Arabidopsis seedlings has little effect on gravitropic sensitivity implying that the sensing system is already saturated. However, in light-grown stems where this mutation results in starch accumulation and where the wild-type practically lacks starch in the sensing cells, the mutant is much more sensitive than the wild-type again showing that the loss of starch depresses gravity sensing...|$|E
