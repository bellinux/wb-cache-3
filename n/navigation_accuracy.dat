40|$|Phase {{perturbations}} due to apparent modal interference make {{a distinctive}} {{contribution to the}} navigation error according to an evaluation of Omega <b>navigation</b> <b>accuracies.</b> In general the North Dakota VLF Omega signal phase has been observed to lag consistently at {{virtually all of the}} receiver sites considered. Attention is given to modal excitation in a spherical waveguide and the sensitivity of receiver phase to parameter variations. It is found that the large phase fluctuations which have occurred at night at ranges from North Dakota could deteriorate <b>navigation</b> <b>accuracies</b> particularly in and near the coastal confluence regions...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{gives an}} {{overview}} on communications system based and global navigation satellite system (GNSS) based navigation. Starting {{from the physical}} layer model of a mobile communications or navigation receiver, we highlight {{similarities and differences between}} the two receivers. We explain navigation principles for timing measurements and present the possible <b>navigation</b> <b>accuracies</b> of different communications systems and GNSSs. Finally, we examine synergies of combined receivers and systems...|$|R
40|$|<b>Navigation</b> <b>accuracies</b> are {{presented}} for a 1985 rendezvous with Halley's Comet using an ion propulsion system. Individual error sources are examined {{to determine their}} relative contributions to final delivery errors. The sensitivity of delivery accuracy to stochastic thrust variations is demonstrated by considering a baseline thrust error model and a more benign alternative model. Also studied are the effects of increased comet ephemeris uncertainties and of operational time delays between the orbit determination process and the guidance implementation...|$|R
50|$|An RNAV {{specification}} is {{designated as}} RNAV X, e.g. RNAV 1. The expression 'X' (where stated) {{refers to the}} lateral <b>navigation</b> <b>accuracy</b> in nautical miles, {{which is expected to}} be achieved at least 95% of the flight time by the population of aircraft operating within the airspace, route or procedure.|$|E
50|$|Specified <b>navigation</b> <b>accuracy</b> for the LN-3 is a 50% circular-error {{probability}} of two nautical miles after one hour's operation, which {{is equivalent to}} a 98% c.e.p. of four nautical miles. Until the -9 version of the LN-3-2A came into service (~1963) results were outside these limits by a fair margin, but since then it has been greatly exceeded {{in a number of}} groups of flights.|$|E

40|$|Developments in {{the area}} of deep space {{tracking}} and navigation during the last decade are briefly reviewed, and advantages offered by wideband differential Very Long Baseline Interferometry (Delta VLBI) are discussed. Delta VLBI data from a spacecraft and an angularly nearby extragalactic radio source promise to provide a factor of five improvement in deep space <b>navigation</b> <b>accuracies</b> as compared with those presently obtained by conventional radiometric tracking. Results of a restricted bandwidth demonstration of wideband Delta VLBI employing the Voyager spacecraft are analyzed...|$|R

Alternate onboard systems configurations using inputs from the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS) and the DOD NAVSTAR Global Positioning System (GPS) are described. Initial simulation {{results indicate that}} TDRSS will provide accuracies of 100 meters or less, and GPS can permit user spacecraft orbit determination to within 10 meters. Specific GPS user equipment developments for Landsat-D and Shuttle are outlined, along with future low-cost versions of these systems...|$|R
40|$|The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter began science {{operations}} in November 2006, with {{a suite of}} seven instruments and investigations, some of which required <b>navigation</b> <b>accuracies</b> much better than previous Mars missions. This paper describes the driving performance requirements levied on Navigation and how well those requirements have been met thus far. Trending analyses that have {{a direct impact on}} the Navigation performance, such as atmospheric bias determination, are covered in detail, as well as dynamic models, estimation strategy, tracking data reduction techniques, and residual noise...|$|R
50|$|The ASP {{is guided}} by a high {{accuracy}} navigation system, which consists of an inertial navigation system and a Doppler navigation system. The velocity drifts of the inertial navigation system are contained by Doppler velocities using a Kalman filter, resulting in good <b>navigation</b> <b>accuracy</b> required for long endurance missions of ASP. Presently, work is in hand to integrate GPS/GLONASS receivers with the inertial navigation system to enhance performance, reliability and robustness.|$|E
50|$|Strategic {{lateral offset}} {{procedure}} (SLOP) {{is a solution}} to a byproduct of increased <b>navigation</b> <b>accuracy</b> in aircraft. Because most now use GPS, aircraft track flight routes with extremely high accuracy. As a result, if an error in height occurs, there is a much higher chance of collision. SLOP allows aircraft to offset the centreline of an airway or flight route by a small amount, normally to the right, so that collision with opposite direction aircraft becomes unlikely.|$|E
50|$|The {{inability}} {{to achieve the}} required lateral <b>navigation</b> <b>accuracy</b> {{may be due to}} navigation errors related to aircraft tracking and positioning. The three main errors are path definition error (PDE), flight technical error (FTE) and navigation system error (NSE). The distribution of these errors is assumed to be independent, zero-mean and Gaussian. Therefore, the distribution of total system error (TSE) is also Gaussian with a standard deviation equal to the root sum square (RSS) of the standard deviations of these three errors.|$|E

It is shown that the combined data yield a solution which is a factor of 3 to 5 better than that obtained from Doppler-only solutions for the node of the orbit relative to the plane perpendicular to the Earth-Mars line. Consequently, these optical data types have a demonstrated potential to significantly improve planetary orbiter <b>navigation</b> <b>accuracies...</b>|$|R
40|$|Multiple {{studies have}} {{concluded}} that Earth-Moon libration point orbits are attractive candidates for staging operations. The Near Rectilinear Halo Orbit (NRHO), {{a member of the}} Earth-Moon halo orbit family, has been singularly demonstrated to meet multi-mission architectural constraints. In this paper, the challenges associated with operating human spacecraft in the NRHO are evaluated. <b>Navigation</b> <b>accuracies</b> and human vehicle process noise effects are applied to various station keeping strategies in order to obtain a reliable orbit maintenance algorithm. Additionally, the ability to absorb missed burns, construct phasing maneuvers to avoid eclipses and conduct rendezvous and proximity operations are examined...|$|R
50|$|The {{definitive}} attack {{version of}} the Intruder with vastly upgraded navigation and attack systems, introduced in 1970 and first deployed on 9 December 1971. The earlier separate search and track (fire control) radars of the A-6A/B/C were replaced by a single Norden AN/APQ-148 multi-mode radar, and onboard computers with a more sophisticated (and generally more reliable) IC based system, {{as opposed to the}} A-6A's DIANE discrete transistor-based technology. A new AN/ASN-92 inertial navigation system was added, along with the CAINS (Carrier Aircraft Inertial Navigation System), for greater <b>navigation</b> <b>accuracy.</b>|$|E
50|$|Approach {{concepts}} {{cover all}} segments of the instrument approach, i.e. initial, intermediate, final, and missed approach. The RNP APCH specifications requiring a standard <b>navigation</b> <b>accuracy</b> of 1.0 NM in the initial, intermediate and missed segments and 0.3 NM in the final segment. Typically, three sorts of RNP applications are characteristic of this phase of flight: new procedures to runways never served by an instrument procedure, procedures either replacing or serving as backup to existing instrument procedures based on different technologies, and procedures developed to enhance airport access in demanding environments (RNP APCH and RNP AR APCH).|$|E
50|$|No 35 Squadron led {{the target}} marking and, {{thanks to the}} clear weather and H2S radar <b>navigation,</b> <b>accuracy</b> was good, with markers falling close to the aiming point. On 24 July, at {{approximately}} 00:57, the first bombing started by the RAF and lasted almost an hour. The confusion caused to German radar kept losses of aircraft low. While some 40,000 firemen were available to tackle fires, control of their resources was damaged when the telephone exchange caught fire and rubble blocked the passage of fire engines through the city streets; fires were still burning three days later.|$|E
40|$|Results are {{presented}} {{for the first}} flight demonstration test of a strapdown laser inertial navigation system in a helicopter environment. It is noted that acceptable <b>navigation</b> <b>accuracies</b> were obtained with system alignment times as short as 5 min or less, and {{that the use of}} all four available sensors in the navigation algorithm did not significantly improve performance over that achievable by means of only three orthogonal sensors. Failure detection by means of the parity residual from four axes proved successful for failure levels far below the noise threshold of flight control sensing requirements. Summing the gyro parity residual for a period of 13 - 20 min can yield step-shifted laser gyro sensor bias error detection comparable to the gyro random shift specification...|$|R
40|$|A {{preliminary}} {{study has been}} made of the navigation performance which might be achieved for the high cross-range space shuttle orbiter during final approach and landing by using an optimally augmented inertial navigation system. Computed <b>navigation</b> <b>accuracies</b> are presented for an on-board inertial navigation system augmented (by means of an optimal filter algorithm) with data from two different ground navigation aids; a precision ranging system and a microwave scanning beam landing guidance system. These results show that augmentation with either type of ground navigation aid is capable of providing a navigation performance at touchdown which should be adequate for the space shuttle. In addition, adequate navigation performance for space shuttle landing is obtainable from the precision ranging system even with a complete dropout of precision range measurements as much as 100 seconds before touchdown...|$|R
40|$|The {{navigation}} and guidance {{process for the}} Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus planetary encounter phases of the 1977 Grand Tour interior mission was simulated. Reference approach <b>navigation</b> <b>accuracies</b> were defined and the relative information content of the various observation types were evaluated. Reference encounter guidance requirements were defined, sensitivities to assumed simulation model parameters were determined and {{the adequacy of the}} linear estimation theory was assessed. A linear sequential estimator was used to provide an estimate of the augmented state vector, consisting of the six state variables of position and velocity plus the three components of a planet position bias. The guidance process was simulated using a nonspherical model of the execution errors. Computation algorithms which simulate the {{navigation and}} guidance process were derived from theory and implemented into two research-oriented computer programs, written in FORTRAN...|$|R
50|$|Existing {{terminal}} airspace concepts, which include arrival and departure, {{are supported by}} RNAV applications. These are currently used in the European (EUR) Region and the United States. The European {{terminal airspace}} RNAV application is known as P-RNAV (Precision RNAV). Although the RNAV 1 specification shares a common <b>navigation</b> <b>accuracy</b> with P-RNAV, this regional navigation specification does not satisfy the full requirements of the RNAV 1 specification. As of 2008, the United States terminal airspace application formerly known as US RNAV Type B has been aligned with the PBN concept and is now called RNAV 1. Basic RNP 1 has been developed primarily for application in non-radar, low density terminal airspace. In future, more RNP applications {{are expected to be}} developed for both en-route and terminal airspace.|$|E
40|$|Computer-aided-surgery in ENT {{surgery is}} mainly used for sinus surgery but <b>navigation</b> <b>accuracy</b> still reaches its limits for skull base procedures. Knowledge of <b>navigation</b> <b>accuracy</b> in {{distinct}} anatomical regions is therefore mandatory. This study examined whether <b>navigation</b> <b>accuracy</b> {{can be improved}} in specific anatomical localizations by using hybrid registration technique. Experimental phantom study. Operating room. The gold standard of screw registration was compared with automatic LED-mask-registration alone, and in combination with additional surface matching. 3 D-printer-based skull models with individual fabricated silicone skin {{were used for the}} experiments. Overall <b>navigation</b> <b>accuracy</b> considering 26 target fiducials distributed over each skull was measured as well as the accuracy on selected anatomic localizations. Overall <b>navigation</b> <b>accuracy</b> was < 1. 0 mm in all cases, showing the significantly lowest values after screw registration (0. 66 ± 0. 08 mm), followed by hybrid registration (0. 83 ± 0. 08 mm), and sole mask registration (0. 92 ± 0. 13 mm). On selected anatomic localizations screw registration was significantly superior on the sphenoid sinus and on the internal auditory canal. However, mask registration showed significantly better accuracy results on the midface. <b>Navigation</b> <b>accuracy</b> on skull base localizations could be significantly improved by the combination of mask registration and additional surface matching. Overall <b>navigation</b> <b>accuracy</b> gives no sufficient information regarding <b>navigation</b> <b>accuracy</b> in a distinct anatomic area. The non-invasive LED-mask-registration proved to be an alternative in clinical routine showing best accuracy results on the midface. For challenging skull base procedures a hybrid registration technique is recommendable which improves <b>navigation</b> <b>accuracy</b> significantly in this operating field. Invasive registration procedures are reserved for selected challenging skull base operations where the required high precision warrants the invasiveness...|$|E

Dynamic and measurement system modelling, data sequence design, measurement extraction, model estimation and orbit determination, as relating optical navigation, are discussed, and the various error sources were analyzed. The methodology developed was applied to the Mariner 9 and the Viking Mars missions. <b>Navigation</b> <b>accuracies</b> were evaluated at the control and knowledge points, with particular emphasis devoted to the combined use of radio and optical data.

40|$|The study {{presents}} an error budget for Delta differential one-way range (Delta-DOR) measurements between two spacecraft. Such observations, made between a planetary orbiter (or lander) and another spacecraft approaching that planet, {{would provide a}} powerful target-relative angular tracking data type for approach <b>navigation.</b> <b>Accuracies</b> of about 5 nrad should be possible {{for a pair of}} X-band spacecraft incorporating 40 -MHz DOR tone spacings, while accuracies approaching 1 nrad will be possible if the spacecraft incorporate Ka-band downlinks with DOR tone spacings of order 250 MHz. Operational advantages of this data type are discussed, and ground system requirements needed to enable S/C-S/C Delta-DOR observations are outlined. A covariance analysis is presented to examine the potential navigation improvement for this scenario. The results show factors of 2 - 3 improvement in spacecraft targeting over conventional Doppler, range, and quasar-relative VLBI, along with reduced sensitivity to ephemeris uncertainty and other systematic errors...|$|R
40|$|The {{navigation}} of the Mariner Mark II spacecraft {{about the}} comet Tempel 2 in the Comet Rendezvous Asteroid Flyby (CRAF) mission is described. This mission {{is the first}} of a series using the Mariner Mark II spacecraft planned for the 1990 's and thereafter. The primary purpose of the mission is to orbit the nucleus of the periodic comet Tempel 2 and study it at close range. A secondary purpose is to fly by and observe one or two asteroids enroute to the comet. During the orbital phase of the mission, a penetrator will be deployed from the spacecraft to impact the surface of the comet and measure the composition and other properties of the nucleus. <b>Navigation</b> <b>accuracies</b> are given in this paper for spacecraft and penetrator trajectory prediction and control. The orbit determination performance in support of science observations while in orbit about the nucleus is also described...|$|R
