It starts off with Jackson stating [...] "There's {{something to be}} said for <b>not</b> <b>saying</b> <b>anything.</b> I've covered a lot in my 20 years. And I've uncovered a lot" [...] in its intro. The opening song, second single [...] "So Excited" [...] featuring rapper Khia, is a hip hop track which samples the drum break and turntable scratches from Herbie Hancock's 1983 song [...] "Rockit". In the song, Jackson promises submission for her lover, singing, [...] "If you like it then I’ll do it/I’ll go head to toe" [...] and [...] "I'm-a keep your body thumping, baby". [...] "Show Me" [...] follows, with Jackson spelling its title throughout the song. The fourth song, [...] "Get It Out Me", is a dance song which was noted to feature Jackson's vocals sounding like her brother Michael's ones. [...] The following song is [...] "Do It 2 Me". It marks a return to Jackson's conversational style; in the song, She is searching for her lover: [...] "My first and only call is to you, time after time, babe, throughout my life". Its music is punctuated by handclaps and by low swoops of a string section. Sixth song [...] "This Body" [...] lyrically is about men who have appreciation with Jackson's appearances in magazines. She addresses her fans in the line [...] "Just had to buy me, had to try me, oooh, you're in love with the hottest girl in the magazine". The song brings sinuous and dark beats incorporating a rhythmic pattern of heavy breathing and the sound of a jet taking off, which was noted to be a metaphor.|$|E
