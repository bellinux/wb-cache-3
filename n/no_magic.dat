5|$|Revelations: Persona is a {{role-playing}} {{video game}} in which the player takes control {{of a group of}} high school students. A mixture of navigation styles are used: navigation round the students' hometown is done using an overhead view, navigation of standard environments such as outside areas and story locations use an angled third-person view, and dungeons and most buildings are navigating in first-person. An icon in the top right-hand corner of the screen displays a lunar phase: this display shows the passage of in-game time, and its status determines the activity patterns and moods of enemy demons. Battles are both triggered by story events and through random encounters around the world map and dungeon environments. If the player attacks an enemy from behind, the party is given a set of attacks costing <b>no</b> <b>magic</b> points or health points.|$|E
5|$|Bullet souls {{are often}} projectiles, and consume a set amount of magic points upon use. Guardian souls provide {{continuous}} effects, including transforming into mythical creatures, defensive abilities, and the summoning of familiars. The movement and attacking of familiars {{can be directly}} controlled with the stylus. Guardian souls continually drain magic points {{so long as they}} are activated. Several Guardian souls can be used in conjunction with Bullet souls to execute special attacks called Tactical Soul combos. Enchant souls offer statistical bonuses and resistance against several forms of attack. They are passive, and require <b>no</b> <b>magic</b> points to remain active. Ability souls give the player new abilities and are required to move into certain areas of the castle. They are always active, and therefore not equipped, nor do they consume magic points. Some examples include the ability to break ice blocks with the stylus, and the ability to double-jump.|$|E
5|$|Anna {{appears in}} the fourth season of Once Upon a Time, with actress Elizabeth Lail portraying the character. Following {{the events of the}} film Frozen, Anna is {{preparing}} to wed Kristoff when Elsa finds a diary from their mother stating their real reason for their parents' fatal trip. Determined to seek answers, Anna postpones her wedding and travels to the Enchanted Forest (known as Misthaven in Arendelle). Anna meets David, a friend of Kristoff's, and trains him in swordsmanship so he can defend his farm from the evil warlord Bo Peep. Following Bo Peep's defeat, David gives Anna his horse and David's mother gives Anna the name of Rumplestiltskin, a powerful wizard who she believes can give her the answers she is looking for. Anna visits Rumplestiltskin (Robert Carlyle) who tells her that the King and Queen of Arendelle came to him, and he will tell her what they said if she administers a potion to an old man. Anna is afraid the potion is poison and pours it into the old man's fire. She returns to Rumplestiltskin's lair and lies, saying she has given the man the potion, and quickly learns it was an antidote, not a poison. In not giving him the drink, Anna has broken her deal with Rumplestiltskin and subjected the man to turn into a mouse. The deal, when broken, meant that Anna had to be Rumplestiltskin's slave—but, alas, Anna gets control of the dagger that controls him, and orders him to never harm her or her sister, and to send her back home with Rumplestiltskin's weapon, a magic-stealing hat. Back in Arendelle, Anna admits to Kristoff that Rumplestiltskin told her that her parents were afraid of Elsa. She does not tell this to Elsa, but is shocked to see that Elsa is learning to control her power—due to a new woman by the name of Ingrid (Elizabeth Mitchell), who claims she is their mother's sister and also has magic snow powers like her sister Elsa. Anna never knew their mother had a sister, so she is immediately skeptical. She goes to meet Grand Pabbie and the rock trolls to find out if this is the truth. While purchasing supplies at Oaken's shop, Anna runs into Belle (Emilie de Ravin) and they become friends. Together, they journey to the rock trolls, where Anna learns that her mother had two sisters named Ingrid and Helga, but Grand Pabbie changed everyone's memory in all of Arendelle. On the return journey back to the castle, Anna and Belle run into Ingrid. Ingrid sees that Anna has Rumplestiltskin's magic-stealing hat and believes she will betray her, so she grabs hold of Anna and imprisons her. Ingrid tells Anna that she has nothing in common with either her or Elsa as she has <b>no</b> <b>magic</b> as they, and now Ingrid must replace her. Eventually, Anna reunites with her sister, helps Ingrid see the errors of her ways, and marries Kristoff.|$|E

25|$|In the mines, Emma {{interrupts}} the dwarves' work {{by taking}} Happy's pickaxe. This infuriated the dwarves, {{causing them to}} take their complaints to David and Mary Margaret. They interrupt David, Mary Margaret and Regina from researching what they were searching for in Camelot: The Crimson Crown. Following the dwarves' complaints, David blames himself for not saving Emma. However, David is interrupted by Arthur, who tells David that key items from his camp, including a magic bean that would take the displaced Camelot residents home, is missing. David and Arthur stop by the pawnshop first to acquire an item, then begin their search at the Arthurians' camp, where David asks the campers to drink from the Chalice of Vengeance. This points him {{in the direction of}} the thief, revealed to be Arthur's squire, Grif, who immediately takes off on horseback, which leads to David and Arthur chasing Grif in David's pickup. David gives Arthur a crash course lesson in driving as he takes a piece of wood, using it as a makeshift joust, and knocks Grif off his horse. Grif later wakes up in the Sheriff's jail and admits that he was tired of how he was being treated, causing him to want to hurt the King. However, there was <b>no</b> <b>magic</b> bean found among the stolen items, but at the camp, David recognized the Crimson Crown on the ground and took it to Regina, who had also seen the question mark that she had handwritten on its illustration back in Camelot.|$|E
500|$|Volume II {{opens in}} 1809 with Strange {{learning}} of Mr Norrell and travelling to London to meet him. They immediately clash over {{the importance of}} John Uskglass (the legendary Raven King) to English magic. Strange argues that [...] "without the Raven King there would be <b>no</b> <b>magic</b> and no magicians" [...] while Norrell retorts that the Raven King abandoned England and should be forgotten. Despite their differing opinions and temperaments, Strange becomes Norrell's pupil. Norrell, however, deliberately keeps some knowledge from Strange.|$|E

It is the first movie that attempts to be realistic and that is actually about human beings grappling with the problems of exploring Mars, as opposed to various movies set on Mars that are essentially either shoot ’em ups or horror films. It does not engage in fantasy: no monsters, <b>no</b> <b>magic,</b> no Nazis. However, {{there are a number of}} technical mistakes." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1890, Congress passed {{legislation}} giving federal sponsorship to an exposition {{to commemorate the}} 400th anniversary of the first voyage of Christopher Columbus to the New World. The act had established a World's Columbian Exposition Commission to oversee the fair. Leading citizens of Chicago established a World's Columbian Exposition Company ("the Company") to organize the construction, and the Company generally emerged as successful in the resulting infighting as to which group would be in charge. Had {{it not been for}} Daniel Burnham, head of the Company's Board of Architects, the fair might never have been built. Burnham, whose favorite saying was, [...] "Make no little plans; they have <b>no</b> <b>magic</b> to stir men's blood", became the czar of the exposition's construction.|$|E
500|$|A unique {{element to}} Secret of Evermore is its system of magic. [...] In order to cast magic, the boy {{must be given}} an [...] "Alchemic Formula" [...] by one of many non-playable {{characters}} called [...] "Alchemists". Some Alchemists make their home in out-of-the-way areas and will dispense rare formulas if the player manages to seek them out. [...] Unlike some role-playing games, there are <b>no</b> <b>magic</b> points needed to cast spells. Alchemy Formulas require pairs of ingredients {{in order to be}} used; Some are available throughout the game, and others are only native to certain environments. In the primitive realms, ingredients appear as such items as wax, limestone, clay, and gunpowder. In the advanced realms, however, the ingredients become more complex, such as ethanol and dry ice.|$|E
500|$|Egypt had run up {{a foreign}} debt of nearly $3 billion, {{and the gap}} between exports and imports had widened to a record $500 million for 1965. On Victory Day in Port Said, Nasser conceded that [...] "We are facing difficulties. We must all work harder [...] and make sacrifices. I have <b>no</b> <b>magic</b> button that I can push to produce the things you want". Premier Zakaria Mohieddin raised Egypt's income tax, added a [...] "defense tax" [...] on all sales, and boosted tariffs on nonessential imports. He also hiked the cost of luxury goods 25% and set low price {{ceilings}} on most foodstuffs. He sent 400 plainclothesmen to Cairo's to arrest 150 shopkeepers for price violations. In March 1966, the Egyptian forces, now numbering almost 60,000, launched their biggest offensive. The royalists counterattacked but the stalemate resumed. Egyptian-supported groups executed sabotage bombings in Saudi Arabia.|$|E

[...] By then he had exhibited a decrease in bodily movement, a sign of how serious his condition had become. His distinctive voice had developed a softer tone and his posture was contorted. Between 1978 and 1980, he spent much time with medical consultants. Despite this he was offered a few engagements and had been voted the most recognisable Englishman among Americans in a poll which also featured Laurence Olivier, Robert Morley and Wilfrid Hyde-White. As a result, he secured a lucrative advertising contract with the Ford Motor Company. Derek Jarman offered Terry-Thomas a role in his 1979 film The Tempest, but the actor was forced to pull out because of his deteriorating health.|$|E
500|$|The Queen rejoices in her victory, but is soon {{discovered}} by the angry Seven Dwarfs, who grab pickaxes and chase her deep into the forest as a great storm begins. She climbs up into the mountains, where she gets trapped upon a precipice that overlooks a seemingly bottomless canyon. She tries to push down a large boulder to crush the approaching Dwarfs. Before she can do so, a lightning bolt strikes {{between her and the}} boulder, destroying the precipice and sending the Queen (along with the boulder) down the cliff to her death, screaming while she falls to the jagged rocks below (this scream was reused in Sleeping Beauty when Maleficent is stabbed in the heart by the Sword of Truth). As the Dwarfs look wide-eyed over the cliff's edge, they cannot see her, but the vultures descend into the chasm. The Queen's dark reign is over, and her castle is then taken over and the revived Snow White and the Prince who broke the spell. (A 1936 pre-release Good Housekeeping novelization by Dorothy Ann Blank, a member of the film's story team, affirms that the Queen in fact dies: [...] "Far below, in a chasm as dark as her own wicked soul, lay the body of the hateful Queen. <b>No</b> <b>magic</b> would ever bring her to life again.") ...|$|E

2500|$|In August 2014, {{when talking}} about the series in {{comparison}} to the 2003 film, Ted Sarandos said, [...] "The series will not be afraid to go darker than the film did. What we love about this particular set of heroes is that they're a little more down to Earth. Costume wise and also in that these are gritty crime stories, more in the streets than in the clouds." [...] Elaborating on this, DeKnight said, [...] "It is a little grittier and edgier than Marvel has gone before, but we're not looking to push it to extreme graphic violence, gratuitous nudity or anything like that. The story does not require that and I think [...] would suffer if you pushed it that far." [...] Marvel Television head and executive producer Loeb later stated that, [...] "There aren't going to be people flying through the sky; there are <b>no</b> <b>magic</b> hammers. We've always approached this as a crime drama first, superhero show second." [...] DeKnight took inspiration from The French Connection, Dog Day Afternoon, and Taxi Driver, and stated that [...] "we would rather lean toward The Wire than what's considered a classic superhero television show." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the 1980s, Latin American novelists had progressed past Magical Realism; yet the McOndo {{literary}} movement did not coalesce as literature, nor {{constitute a}} genre, until the mid-1990s. In 1994, the Chilean novelist Alberto Fuguet {{participated in an}} international writing workshop at the University of Iowa, where he submitted for publication a short story to the Iowa Review magazine; he expected prompt acceptance, translation to English, and publication, because Latin American writers then were an intellectual vogue in trendy U.S. mainstream culture. Yet, upon reading the novelist Fuguet's submitted short story, the Iowa Review editor, {{taken aback by the}} realism and <b>no</b> <b>magic,</b> dismissed it as [...] "not Latin American enough [...] [...] [...] [...] the story could have taken place right here, in [...] America." [...] Two years later, in 1996, in retort to the U.S. editorial rebuffing of realist fiction from and about Latin America, Alberto Fuguet and Sergio Gómez in Spain published McOndo (1996) a short-story anthology of contemporary Latin American literature. The McOndo anthology comprised seventeen stories by Latin American and peninsular Spanish writers, all men whose literary careers had begun in the 1990s; each was of the generation born in the late 1950s. The McOndo writers ideologically distanced themselves from Magical Realism, because it misrepresented contemporary Latin America — which, in the 1990s, comprised [...] "shopping malls, cable television, suburbs, and pollution" [...] — because literature had progressed beyond the banana republic Latin America of the dictator novel and of the Magical Realism genre; the cultures of the 19th and of the 20th centuries.|$|E
