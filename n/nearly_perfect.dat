5|$|Protactinium iodides {{result from}} the oxides and {{aluminium}} iodide or ammonium iodide heated to 600°C. Protactinium(III) iodide was obtained by heating protactinium(V) iodide in vacuum. As with oxides, protactinium forms mixed halides with alkali metals. Among those, most remarkable is Na3PaF8 where protactinium ion is symmetrically surrounded by 8 F− ions which form a <b>nearly</b> <b>perfect</b> cube.|$|E

5|$|Outer {{space is}} a {{convenient}} setting {{for measuring the}} speed of light because of its large scale and <b>nearly</b> <b>perfect</b> vacuum. Typically, one measures the time needed for light to traverse some reference distance in the solar system, such as the radius of the Earth's orbit. Historically, such measurements could be made fairly accurately, compared to how accurately the length of the reference distance is known in Earth-based units. It is customary to express the results in astronomical units (AU) per day.|$|E

5|$|The Almost <b>Nearly</b> <b>Perfect</b> People {{is divided}} into five {{sections}} for Denmark, Iceland, Norway, Finland and Sweden. Beginning with Denmark, Booth explains the Danish concept of hygge ("cosy times"), which he sees as conformism. He criticises the Danish population's environmental footprint and notes that their taxation rate and levels of personal debt are {{among the highest in}} the world. Moving to Iceland, Booth details the banking practices that led to the collapse of the country's largest banks in the 2008 financial crisis, as well as the popular belief among Icelanders in the existence of Huldufólk (elves).|$|E
5|$|The Sun is {{the star}} {{at the center of}} the Solar System. It is a <b>nearly</b> <b>perfect</b> sphere of hot plasma, with {{internal}} convective motion that generates a magnetic field via a dynamo process. It is by far the most important source of energy for life on Earth. Its diameter is about 1.39 million kilometers, i.e. 109 times that of Earth, and its mass is about 330,000 times that of Earth, accounting for about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System.|$|E

5|$|An inflationary phase, an {{additional}} phase of strongly accelerated expansion at cosmic times of around 10−33 seconds, was hypothesized in 1980 {{to account for}} several puzzling observations that were unexplained by classical cosmological models, such as the <b>nearly</b> <b>perfect</b> homogeneity of the cosmic background radiation. Recent measurements of the cosmic background radiation {{have resulted in the}} first evidence for this scenario. However, there is a bewildering variety of possible inflationary scenarios, which cannot be restricted by current observations. An even larger question is the physics of the earliest universe, prior to the inflationary phase and close to where the classical models predict the big bang singularity. An authoritative answer would require a complete theory of quantum gravity, which has not yet been developed (cf. the section on quantum gravity, below).|$|E
5|$|The Almost <b>Nearly</b> <b>Perfect</b> People: The Truth About the Nordic Miracle is a 2014 nonfiction book by the British {{journalist}} Michael Booth. In the book, Booth {{focuses on}} the five Nordic countries—Denmark, Iceland, Norway, Finland and Sweden—dedicating {{a section of the}} book to each one. He began writing the book after migrating from England to Denmark, based on his perceptions of the Nordic region before and after moving. He wanted to present an alternative perspective to the extremely positive depiction of the region in British media. The book received mixed reviews: some critics found it to be overly critical with poor humour, others praised its tone and informativeness.|$|E
5|$|Triton and Nereid are unusual {{irregular}} {{satellites and}} are thus treated separately from the other five irregular Neptunian moons, which are more like the outer irregular satellites of the other outer planets. Firstly, they are the largest two known irregular moons in the Solar System, with Triton being almost {{an order of magnitude}} larger than all other known irregular moons. Secondly, they both have atypically small semi-major axes, with Triton's being over an order of magnitude smaller than those of all other known irregular moons. Thirdly, they both have unusual orbital eccentricities: Nereid {{has one of the most}} eccentric orbits of any known irregular satellite, and Triton's orbit is a <b>nearly</b> <b>perfect</b> circle. Finally, Nereid also has the lowest inclination of any known irregular satellite.|$|E

5000|$|Phacops rana can be {{recognized}} by its large eyes (which remind some observers of a frog's eyes [...] - [...] the specific name rana is {{a reference to a}} common frog), its fairly large size (up to 6 inches long), and its habit of rolling up into a ball like a pill bug. In order to protect themselves from predators, Phacops rana would roll into a ball with its hard exoskeleton on the outside as protection. Many other trilobites possessed the same ability, but Phacops rana <b>nearly</b> <b>perfected</b> it. The slightest amount of sediment would trigger their senses, and Phacops rana would be hidden in a tiny shelter made of its own body. [...] Although this safety feature often helped them to evade predators, occasionally it backfired and the trilobite would be buried under heavy sediment. Their fossils can still be found in balled-up positions 400 million years later.|$|R
5|$|Triton's {{revolution}} around Neptune {{has become}} a <b>nearly</b> <b>perfect</b> circle with an eccentricity of almost zero. Viscoelastic damping from tides alone is not thought {{to be capable of}} circularizing Triton's orbit in the time since the origin of the system, and gas drag from a prograde debris disc is likely to have played a substantial role. Tidal interactions also cause Triton's orbit, which is already closer to Neptune than the Moon's is to Earth, to gradually decay further; predictions are that 3.6billion years from now, Triton will pass within Neptune's Roche limit. This will result in either a collision with Neptune's atmosphere or the breakup of Triton, forming a ring system similar to that found around Saturn.|$|E
5|$|All {{preparations}} for the operation were completed by {{the first week of}} May and on 9 May the weather was <b>nearly</b> <b>perfect</b> for the attack. The British armada had collected at Dunkirk in Allied-held France and departed port shortly after dark. Two minutes after midnight, the force suffered a setback when Sappho suffered a minor boiler explosion and had to return to Dunkirk, unable to complete the journey. Although this accident halved the ability of the force to block Ostend, Lynes decided to continue the operation, and at 01:30, the force closed on the port, making the final {{preparations for}} the assault. Torpedoes fired from motor launches demolished machine gun posts on the ends of the piers marking the canal, beginning the attack. Ten heavy bombers of the newly formed Royal Air Force then dropped incendiary bombs on German positions, but did not cause significant damage. In spite of the fog, air operations continued as planned under the overall direction of Brigadier-General Charles Lambe. At {{the same time as the}} aerial bombardment began, the long range artillery of the Royal Marine Artillery opened fire on Ostend from Allied positions around the Belgian town of Ypres.|$|E

40|$|Hydroelectricity {{started with}} the wooden {{waterwheel}} and various types of waterwheels {{have been used in}} Europe and China for approximately 2000 years (Paish, 2002). The technique to use water to generate electricity was <b>nearly</b> <b>perfected</b> during the Industrial Revolution with efficiencies approaching 70 % in many thousands of waterwheels in use (Paish, 2002).

The golden age of hydropower was during the first half of the 20 th century before oil became the main source of energy for most of the modern world. The development of hydropower in the 20 th century was usually associated with the building of large dams.
