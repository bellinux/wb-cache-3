Firstly, the orbital patterns, spectrum cascade plots of the Power Spectral Density, evolutions of the 2 × amplitudes of rotor with and without an open transverse crack are compared and discussed in the case of low accelerations of the rotor system. Secondly, the non-stationary vibration signals of the rotor with an open transverse crack at high accelerations are investigated. The timefrequency features and a tool based on the Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) to detect open cracks in a rotor system are discussed. It is demonstrated that both the Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) and changes on the 2 × harmonic components are robust indicators for crack detection...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A {{thorough}} investigation {{on the effect}} of a 320 MW steam turbine <b>rotor</b> <b>notch</b> fillet radius on thermal and mechanical stresses during start up is presented. The approach consists of a shape design and analysis procedure which incorporates a finite element model. The finite element model is used to characterize the radius of the <b>rotor</b> <b>notch</b> fillet for ensuring the designed thermal and mechanical stress state/pattern and associated deflection during start-up. The results indicate that the notch fillet radius r has significant impact on the total stress of the rotor, in particular on thermal stress. It is determined that the thermal stress is decreased as the notch fillet radius r increases to a critical value. However, the thermal stress becomes saturated as the radius is increased to values larger than the critical value. The results also indicate that the <b>rotor</b> <b>notch</b> fillet radius has little effect on the deflection of the rotor during start-up. This investigation could be very useful to designers for construction of the design guidelines for steam turbine rotors...|$|R
50|$|Other {{differences}} {{included the}} use of a fixed reflector and the relocation of the stepping <b>notches</b> from the <b>rotor</b> body to the movable letter rings. The machine measured 28 x 34 x 15 cm and weighed around 12 kg.|$|R
5000|$|The Abwehr {{used the}} Enigma G (the Abwehr Enigma). This Enigma variant was a four-wheel unsteckered machine with {{multiple}} <b>notches</b> on the <b>rotors.</b> This model {{was equipped with}} a counter which incremented upon each key press, and so {{is also known as}} the [...] "counter machine" [...] or the Zählwerk Enigma.|$|R
50|$|Whenever a key on the {{keyboard}} was pressed, the stepping motion was actuated, moving the rightmost rotor on one position. Because it advanced with each key pressed it is sometimes called the fast <b>rotor.</b> When a <b>notch</b> on that <b>rotor</b> engaged with a pawl on the middle rotor, that too moved; and similarly with the leftmost ('slow') rotor.|$|R
50|$|The {{first five}} rotors to be {{introduced}} (I-V) contained one notch each, while the additional naval rotors VI, VII and VIII each had two notches. The position of the <b>notch</b> on each <b>rotor</b> {{was determined by the}} letter ring which could be adjusted in relation to the core containing the interconnections. The points on the rings at which they caused the next wheel to move were as follows.|$|R
40|$|A {{magnetic}} bearing control {{system for a}} high-speed flywheel system is described. The flywheel utilizes a five axis active {{magnetic bearing}} system, using eddy current sensors for position feedback to the bearing controller. Magnetic bearing controller features designed to improve flywheel operation and testing are described. Operational improvements include feed forward control to compensate for <b>rotor</b> imbalance, moving <b>notch</b> filtering to compensate for synchronous and harmonic rotational noise, and fixed <b>notching</b> to prevent <b>rotor</b> bending mode excitation. Testing improvements include adding safe gain, bearing current hold, bearing current zero, and excitation input features. Performance and testing improvements provided by these features are measured and discussed...|$|R
50|$|The design also {{included}} a feature known as double-stepping. This occurred when each pawl aligned with both the ratchet of its rotor and the rotating notched ring of the neighbouring rotor. If a pawl engaged with a ratchet through alignment with a notch, as it moved forward it pushed against both the ratchet and the <b>notch,</b> advancing both <b>rotors.</b> In a three-rotor machine, double-stepping affected rotor two only. If in moving forward the ratchet of rotor three was engaged, rotor two would move again on the subsequent keystroke, resulting in two consecutive steps. Rotor two also pushes rotor one forward after 26 steps, but since rotor one moves forward with every keystroke anyway, there is no double-stepping. This double-stepping caused the rotors to deviate from odometer-style regular motion.|$|R
