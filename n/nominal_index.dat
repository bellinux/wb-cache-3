The thesis follows the lives of several residents of the St. Lawrence valley as they learn about the residents of New York and New England through business, marriage, adoption and trade in furs. Using case studies of seventeenth-century native and European individuals, as well as information from folklore, parish registers, letters and legal documents, movement in the border region between settled colonies is examined. A <b>nominal</b> <b>index</b> describes the origins of, and provides capsule biographies for, 694 residents of New France whose roots were neither in France nor in the native communities.

40|$|Abstract:- Mode {{analysis}} and dispersion relations {{are the basic}} characteristics for cylindrical dielectric waveguides. The waveguide configuration is based on geometry and on the index profile. The <b>nominal</b> <b>index</b> profile {{is the basis for}} the calculation of the field profile and the dispersion relations. However, a strong motivation exists for the evaluation of a real index profile. The modern index profile measurement techniques provide with accuracy the index profile in many geometric configurations. Since analytical solutions are non-existent for arbitrary index inhomogeneity, the easily applicable numerical method of equivalent circuits in Fourier space is applied for the evaluation of index profile measurement data. As an example of the application of the method, an arbitrary index profile based on the step index is examined, consisting of a random sequence of index values around the nominal, versus the distance from the center. Very useful results are obtained for dispersion relations and field distribution. Key- Words...|$|E
40|$|Objective. This {{study was}} {{designed}} to ascertain lay knowledge of the anatomical location of major organs within the human body amongst the Asian and non-Asian population in Leicester and to explore the relationships of this knowledge to level of education and social class. Method. The study was based on a cross sectional random sample stratified by from the FHSA <b>Nominal</b> <b>Index</b> Register and data was collected using a personally administered ques-tionnaire in the preferred language of the respondant. Subjects marked the position of the major organs (heart, lungs, kidneys, bladder, liver, brain and stomach) on an image of the human body. The answers were judged against a correct 'response area ' produced from a survey of 20 GPs. Results. The overall response rate to the survey was 88. 5 % with 449 Asians and 447 non-Asians participating. After adjustment for age, sex, education and social class differences, non-Asians {{were significantly more likely to}} correctly identify the position of the lungs {P = 0. 01) and less likely than Asians to correctly identify the position of the stomach (P < 0. 0001). There were no differences found in the knowledge of the position of the other organs. Higher educational attainment was significantly associated with the ability to locate the kidneys (P = 0. 0052) and the liver P = 0. 0001) and higher social class was associated with greater ability to locate the position of the lungs P = 0. 01). Conclusions. Patients show considerable lack of knowledge of the position of major organs within the body. Health professionals will need to address this before embarking upon health promotion...|$|E

The model's parameters are estimated using a maximum likelihood technique based on a Kalman filter. Data on nominal U. S.

40|$|We {{characterize}} the optimal sequential choice of monetary policy in economies with either <b>nominal</b> or <b>indexed</b> debt. In a model where nominal debt {{is the only}} source of time inconsistency, the (Markov-perfect) sequential optimal policy implies the depletion of the outstanding stock of debt progressively, until the time inconsistency disappears. There is a resulting welfare loss if debt is <b>nominal</b> rather than <b>indexed.</b> We analyze the more general case where monetary policy is time inconsistent even when debt is indexed. In this case, with nominal debt, the sequential optimal policy converges to a time consistent steady state with positive –or negative – debt, depending on the value of the intertemporal elasticity of substitution. Welfare can be higher if debt is <b>nominal</b> rather than <b>indexed</b> and the level of debt is not too high...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} the fragmentation dynamics of an atomic chain under tensile stress. We have classified the location, stability type (indices) and energy of all equilibria {{for the general}} n-particle chain, and have highlighted the importance of saddle points with index > 1. We show that for an n= 2 -particle chain under tensile stress the index 2 saddle plays {{a central role in}} organizing the dynamics. We apply normal form theory to analyze phase space structure and dynamics in a neighborhood of the index 2 saddle. We define a phase dividing surface (DS) that enables us to classify trajectories passing through a neighborhood of the saddle point using the values of the integrals associated with the normal form. We also generalize our definition of the dividing surface and define an extended dividing surface (EDS), which is used to sample and classify all trajectories that pass through a phase space neighborhood of the index 2 saddle at total energies less than that of the saddle. Classical trajectory simulations are used to study single versus double bond breakage for the n= 2 chain under tension. Initial conditions for trajectories are obtained by sampling the EDS at constant energy. We sample trajectories at fixed energies both above and below the energy of the saddle. The fate of trajectories (single versus double bond breakage) is explored {{as a function of the}} location of the initial condition on the EDS, and a connection made to the work of Chesnavich on collision-induced dissociation. A significant finding is that we can readily identify trajectories that exhibit bond healing. Such trajectories pass outside the <b>nominal</b> (<b>index</b> 1) transition state for single bond dissociation, but return to the potential well region, possibly several times, before ultimately dissociating.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{relationship}} between the denomination of public debt and the choice of exchange rate regime. Three types of debt (<b>nominal,</b> <b>indexed,</b> and foreign) and two regimes (fixed and flexible) are considered. Indexed debt is insulated against unexpected inflation. The real (domestic-currency) value of foreign debt is subject to valuation effects from real exchange rate shocks. The `fear-of-floating' result, that foreign debt makes pegging more attractive, is shown to hold unambiguously only if the peg is fully credible. If the peg lacks credibility, a critical factor is the perceived likelihood of using the `escape clause' of a switch to a float, which raises the costs of pegging. Foreign debt increases the temptation to resort to the escape clause, so when a peg is not fully credible (as is almost always the case in reality), pegging tends to be less attractive than floating in the presence of foreign debt. ...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{monetary}} policymakers have monitored several {{measures of}} market expectations of future inflation. One {{of these measures}} {{is based on the}} yield differential between <b>nominal</b> and inflation <b>indexed</b> Treasury securities. This yield spread is also called the “breakeven inflation rate. ” An increase in the breakeven rate is sometimes viewed as a sign that market inflation expectations may be on the rise. For example, the FOMC frequently refers to the yield spread as a measure of “inflation compensation” and considers the yield spread an indicator of inflation expectations in policy deliberations.; Accurately inferring market expectations of inflation from yield spreads is difficult. The difficulty lies in the differences in market liquidity conditions between <b>nominal</b> and inflation <b>indexed</b> Treasury securities.; Shen presents evidence that liquidity differences between <b>nominal</b> and inflation <b>indexed</b> Treasuries have been nontrivial. Consequently, simply attributing changes in yield spreads to changes in market inflation expectations and ignoring the liquidity risk premium could lead to inaccurate inflation expectations.
