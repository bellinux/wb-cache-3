40|$|A {{fundamental}} problem with parallel program monitoring tools is the intrusiveness introduced by instrumenting a monitor into the original program for collecting trace data. An <b>intrusive</b> <b>monitor</b> may alter {{the order of}} program events and distort the timing information.

This paper presents an instrumentation approach for monitoring parallel message-passing programs with a minimum intrusiveness. The approach uses virtual clocks to time and control the ordering of communication events during monitoring, and to reflect the real time execution when running without monitoring. Its main improvement over some previous approaches is that it not only preserves the partial ordering of events, but also collecting accurate timing information. It is therefore suitable for both program debugging and performance tuning. The paper describes how the approach collects timing [...] ...|$|R

40|$|While {{cryptographic}} algorithms {{are usually}} strong against mathematical attacks, their practical implementation, both in software and in hardware, {{opens the door}} to side-channel attacks. Without expensive equipment or <b>intrusive</b> <b>monitoring,</b> these attacks bypass the mathematical complexity and find the cryptographic key by observing the power consumption or the execution time variations of the device in normal operation mode. The power traces of 8000 encryptions are for instance sufficient to extract the secret key of an unprotected ASIC AES implementation, which is orders of magnitude smaller than the 2 128 tests required to brute force the algorithm. A careful implementation can address these vulnerabilities, yet the solutions conflict with the common design goals to optimize for area, performance and power consumption.

40|$|Includes bibliography. Electrical {{energy is}} the life line to every nation’s or {{continent}} development and economic progress. Referable to the recent growth in the demand for electricity and shortage in production, it is indispensable to develop strategies for effective energy management and system delivery. Load <b>monitoring</b> such as <b>intrusive</b> load <b>monitoring,</b> non-intrusive load monitoring, and identification of domestic electrical appliances is proposed especially at the residential level {{since it is the}} major energy consumer. The <b>intrusive</b> load <b>monitoring</b> provides accurate results and would allow each individual appliance's energy consumption to be transmitted to a central hub. Nevertheless, there are many practical disadvantages to this method that have motivated the introduction of non-intrusive load monitoring system. The fiscal cost of manufacturing and installing enough monitoring devices to match the number of domestic appliances {{is considered to be a}} disadvantage. In addition, the installation of one meter per household appliances would lead to congestion in the house and thus cause inconvenience to the occupants of the house, therefore, non-intrusive load monitoring technique was developed to alleviate the aforementioned challenges of <b>intrusive</b> load <b>monitoring.</b> Non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) is the process of disaggregating a household’s total energy consumption into its contributing appliances. The total household load is monitored via a single monitoring device such as smart meter (SM). NILM provides cost effective and convenient means of load monitoring and identification. Several nonintrusive load monitoring and identification techniques are reviewed. However, the literature lacks a comprehensive system that can identify appliances with small energy consumption, appliances with overlapping energy consumption and a group of appliance ranges at once. This has been the major setback to most of the adopted techniques. In this dissertation, we propose techniques that overcome these setbacks by combining artificial neural networks (ANN) with a developed algorithm to identify appliances ranges that contribute to the energy consumption within a given period of time usually an hour interval...|$|R

However, with the continuous increase of exposure to gambling stimuli {{it is important to}} investigate the effect of gambling stimuli on the general population.

5000|$|Compared with OHV pushrod {{systems with}} {{the same number of}} valves, the {{reciprocating}} components of the OHC system are fewer and have a lower overall mass. Though the system that drives the camshafts may be more complex, most [...] accept that added complexity as a trade-off for better engine performance and greater design flexibility. The fundamental reason for the OHC valvetrain is that it offers an increase in the engine's ability to exchange induction and exhaust gases. (This exchange is sometimes known as 'engine breathing'. [...] ) Another performance advantage is gained {{as a result of the}} better optimised port configurations made possible with overhead camshaft designs. With <b>no</b> <b>intrusive</b> pushrods, the overhead camshaft cylinder head design can use straighter ports of more advantageous cross-section and length. The OHC design allows for higher engine speeds than comparable cam-in-block designs, as a result of having lower valvetrain mass.
