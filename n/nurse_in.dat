5|$|Screaming mouths {{appears in}} many of Bacon's works from the late 1940s to the early 1950s.

40|$|Aims: To compare moral {{distress}} and burnout experienced by mental health <b>nurses</b> <b>in</b> hospitals both in Japan and England. Methods: This is a cross-national study, and a cross-sectional design was adopted. An anonymous questionnaire containing 43 moral distress items, a 16 item burnout scale, and demographic data {{was administered to}} convenient samples; 391 <b>nurses</b> <b>in</b> Japan, and 460 <b>nurses</b> <b>in</b> England. Among the participants, 289 nurses (73. 9 %) in Japan, and 36 nurses (7. 8 %) in England responded. Results: The moral distress items which were commonly felt by <b>nurses</b> <b>in</b> both countries dealt {{with a lack of}} staff. Several differences, however, existed between the two, which reflected poor conditions such as long term social hospitalization <b>in</b> Japan. The <b>nurses</b> <b>in</b> England felt moral distress in a wider variety of situations, though they confront them less frequently than the <b>nurses</b> <b>in</b> Japan. Only in England was it found that the older nurses became, and the more experience they had accumulated, the less intensely they felt moral distress. The <b>nurses</b> <b>in</b> both countries felt the same levels of exhaustion, and cynicism, but as far as professional efficacy, the scores of the <b>nurses</b> <b>in</b> England were much higher than those of the <b>nurses</b> <b>in</b> Japan. Conclusions: If nurses feel no moral distress, there will be no improvements of care. Nurses should have moral sense, and do their best to improve the situations without being burned out...|$|R

5|$|It is {{uncertain}} how Bruce was employed {{after his return}} from Spitsbergen in autumn 1899. In his whole life he rarely had settled salaried work, and usually relied on patronage or on influential acquaintances to find him temporary posts. Early in 1901 he evidently felt sufficiently confident of his prospects to get married. His bride was Jessie Mackenzie, who {{had worked as a}} <b>nurse</b> <b>in</b> Samuel Bruce's London surgery. Bruce's marriage took place in the United Free Church of Scotland, in Chapelhill within the Parish of Nigg on 20 January 1901, being attended and witnessed by their parents. Perhaps, due to Bruce's secretive nature presenting limited details even among his circle of close friends and colleagues, little information about the wedding has been recorded by his biographers.|$|E

Corkhill was a skilled horsewoman, and was the lead in the centenary Cooma Show. A supper cloth made by Corkhill while on duty has been used as an example of decorative crafts of the era, and a number of photographs she had taken while on duty were donated to the Australian War Memorial.

5|$|From early 1929 Anderson {{lived with}} Annie Burr Jennings, a wealthy Park Avenue {{spinster}} happy to host someone {{she supposed to}} be a daughter of the Tsar. For eighteen months, Anderson was the toast of New York City society. Then a pattern of self-destructive behavior began that culminated in her throwing tantrums, killing her pet parakeet, and on one occasion running around naked on the roof. On 24 July 1930, Judge Peter Schmuck of the New York Supreme Court signed an order committing her to a mental hospital. Before she could be taken away, Anderson locked herself in her room, and the door was broken in with an axe. She was forcibly taken to the Four Winds Sanatorium in Westchester County, New York, where she remained for slightly over a year. In August 1932, Anderson returned to Germany accompanied by a private <b>nurse</b> <b>in</b> a locked cabin on the liner Deutschland. Jennings paid for the voyage, the stay at the Westchester sanatorium, and an additional six months' care in the psychiatric wing of a nursing home at Ilten near Hanover. On arrival at Ilten, Anderson was assessed as sane, but as the room was prepaid, and she had nowhere else to go, she stayed on in a suite in the sanatorium grounds.|$|E
