40|$|The aim of {{the work}} is to develop a {{calculation}} method for slipping parameters of <b>friction</b> <b>clutches</b> (of the slipping work and time) in tractor gearboxes at various gear overlaps and for different <b>friction</b> <b>clutches</b> installation on the shafts. The work has used theoretical and experimental research methods: the former were based on methods of analytical mechanics and motion theory of wheeled and tracked vehicles, while the latter assumed testing full-sized prototypes of <b>friction</b> <b>clutches</b> and <b>friction</b> <b>clutches</b> in gearboxes. The work has brought the following results: a universal acceleration diagram has been offered for a tractor unit at shifting gears with different overlaps, valid for any relation between the gearing time and <b>friction</b> <b>clutch</b> slipping; based on the mathematical models of acceleration of the tractor unit, we have developed a generalized calculation method for parameters of the <b>friction</b> <b>clutch</b> slipping (of the slipping work and time), when shifting gears with different overlaps, at starting off a tractor unit and at bench tests of <b>friction</b> <b>clutches</b> and <b>friction</b> <b>clutches</b> in gearboxes. The scientific novelty {{of the work is}} in development of the following: - A theoretical acceleration diagram of a tractor unit with gear shifting in the gearbox with different overlaps; - A mathematical acceleration model of a tractor unit and <b>friction</b> <b>clutch</b> slipping in the gearbox at gear shifting with different overlaps, and when starting a tractor unit off; - A generalized calculation method for parameters of the <b>friction</b> <b>clutch</b> slipping (of the slipping work and time), when shifting gears in the gearbox with different overlaps, when starting a tractor unit off and at bench tests of <b>friction</b> <b>clutches</b> and <b>friction</b> <b>clutches</b> in the gearbox. Conclusions: The developed universal acceleration mathematical model for a tractor unit at gear shifting in the gearbox with different overlaps, and of its acceleration at starting off, allows defining – at the designing stage of gearboxes with <b>friction</b> <b>clutches</b> – their work and slipping time, and the acceleration time of a tractor unit, which may lead to designing reliable <b>friction</b> <b>clutches</b> and gearboxes with <b>friction</b> <b>clutches.</b> The proposed calculation method of the work of the <b>friction</b> <b>clutch</b> slipping in the gearbox at bench tests allows transferring test results into the operation loading mode, and, therefore, to perform fine-tuning of gearboxes with <b>friction</b> <b>clutches</b> at bench tests. </p...|$|R

In this work, mathematical models of the <b>friction</b> <b>clutch</b> system (single-disc clutch) were built to find the temperature field during the sliding period (single engagement).

40|$|As the {{friction}} material degradation progresses, the normal contact stiffness of wet <b>friction</b> <b>clutches,</b> {{measured in the}} pre-sliding (stiction) regime that corresponds to the post-lockup phase, changes as revealed in our previous study. Consequently, change of the contact stiffness can affect the normal-mode dynamic behavior. If this hypothesis holds, condition of wet <b>friction</b> <b>clutches</b> can also be monitored based on the change of the normal-mode dynamic behavior. In order to verify the hypothesis, in this study, accelerated lifetime tests (ALTs) were carried out on two paper-based wet <b>friction</b> <b>clutches</b> under different operations using an SAE# 2 test setup. The normal-mode vibration signal is measured every 200 duty cycles by using an accelerometer axially mounted on the bearing housing of the clutch. Three parameters that implicitly quantify the overall dynamic behavior, i. e., frequency centre (FC), root mean square frequency (RMSF), and root variance frequency (RVF), are extracted from the vibration signal measured in the post-lockup phase. The plots of these three parameters in function of the duty cycles exhibit clear trends which indicate {{the progress of the}} clutch degradation. These three parameters can therefore be seen as the important ones that may allow us to assess the condition of wet <b>friction</b> <b>clutches.</b> status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Wet <b>friction</b> <b>clutches</b> play a {{critical}} role in vehicles equipped with automatic transmissions. It is unavoidable that they progressively degrade and eventually break down while the vehicles are under operational condition. To avoid unexpected failures, a proper condition monitoring tool extended with a lifetime prediction method should be implemented. In order to achieve this, appropriate parameters delivering any information about the failure modes and levels must be determined. This paper presents an experimental investigation on a set of statistical parameters generated from the zeroth- and first-order derivative of time domain pre-lockup torsional vibration signals, to determine the appropriate parameters, often called relevant features, for condition monitoring of wet <b>friction</b> <b>clutches.</b> The torsional vibrations are measured by using two Ferraris sensors installed on both input and output shaft of the clutch. The determination of the relevant features is based on an evaluation of the historical trends of the parameters. Clearness and fluctuation level of the historical trends are considered as criteria for selecting relevant features from the generated statistical parameters. The trends of the parameters are extracted from lifetime data obtained from an accelerated lifetime test on a paper-based wet clutch, using a SAE# 2 test setup. This study reveals that the RMS value and Shannon entropy extracted from the first-order derivatives of the pre-lockup torsional vibration signals, and the kurtosis extracted from the zeroth-order derivatives of the pre-lockup torsional vibration signals, can be used as relevant features for condition monitoring of wet <b>friction</b> <b>clutches.</b> status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, a {{friction}} model {{appropriate for}} wet <b>friction</b> <b>clutches</b> {{based on the}} extension of the Generalized Maxwell Slip (GMS) friction model is integrated to a four-DOF lumped-mass-spring-damper system which represents a typical SAE# 2 test setup. Degradation models expressing the evolutions of the friction model parameters are also proposed, where the structure of the degradation models is inspired from experimental results obtained in the earlier work. This way, the engagement dynamics of the clutch system during the useful lifetime can be simulated. It appears that the previously developed pre-and post-lockup features extracted from the simulated signals obtained in this study are qualitatively in agreement with the experimental results. Those features show their predictive behaviors that confirm their feasibility to be used for clutch monitoring and prognostics.

40|$|The paper {{proposes a}} {{technique}} for accelerated life benchmark tests of tractor <b>friction</b> <b>clutches,</b> imitating real mode loading. A loading diagram of a tractor unit, constructed by this technique, {{is common for}} all <b>friction</b> <b>clutches</b> of a given class and purpose. However, specific clutch loading is determined not only by a loading diagram, but by the design parameters of a friction unit as well (geometric dimensions, a value of the reserve coefficient  and a moment of inertia Je of the engine shaft, terms of heat sink, the number of friction pairs, an irregularity of their loading, etc.). Therefore, when assessing a durability of <b>friction</b> pairs of <b>clutch,</b> a loading diagram of tractor is reconstructed into the loading diagram of a particular <b>friction</b> <b>clutch.</b> At life benchmark tests a loading mode {{is close to the}} operating mode, and a convenience of the experiment is provided by logging load levels and by using the minimum number of bench changeovers. Thus, each specific clutch, in a common diagram of operating loads of the tractor, will meet an individual loading diagram that determines its durability. The paper presents the model loading diagrams for three types of tractors and clutches, used in their transmissions. Conclusions: The proposed technique for accelerated life benchmark tests of clutches is based on the principle of simulating a mode of loading to be equivalent to that of the operating mode. Thus, benchmark test acceleration is achieved by increasing the cyclic of clutching in comparison with an operating mode. Using the proposed technique allows 6 [...] . 10 times benchmark test acceleration as compared to the operating one, depending on the design, code of friction material and loading conditions under operation. Good convergence (error of 11 % at most) of the results at bench and field tests allows us to recommend the proposed technique to evaluate a resource of tractor clutches. </p...|$|R
