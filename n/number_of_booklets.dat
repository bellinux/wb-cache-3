50|$|Due to its {{inclusion}} as {{a mandatory}} admission requirement into medical and health science courses, {{as well as}} the highly competitive nature of entry into such courses, there has been some controversy regarding the UMAT's relevance, structure and necessity.ACER do not release their marking and scaling procedures.

40|$|Women of the World War II {{home front}} {{adjusted}} to war related fabric shortages and rationing {{through the use}} of ingenious alternatives. While yard goods were subject to war rationing, and ready to wear garments were redesigned to use less fabric, a segment of the American population took advantage of another option. These families continued to create a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> attractive garments and household items throughout the war from a type of cotton percale which was available for free and classified as an unrestricted industrial good. The cotton commodity bag or cotton feed sack, gained popularity as an alternative to traditional yard goods throughout rural communities. This tradition began {{at the turn of the}} 20 th century and continued to grow with the support of grain manufacturers and the Department of Agriculture, which published a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> pattern <b>booklets</b> designed specifically for commodity bags. Three 100 lbs sacks of grain could make an average sized adult dress and packaging companies hired notable fabric designers from Europe and New York City to create colorful dress prints for their cotton packaging. This tradition continued into the 1960 s, bolstered by the annual industry sponsored Cotton Bag Sewing Queen contest. The contest was held at state fairs nationwide throughout the 1950 s and 1960 s to maintain consumer interest in the cotton bag at a time when the paper commodity bag began to grow in popularity with manufacturers...|$|R
