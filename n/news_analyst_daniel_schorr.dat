5000|$|I like {{to think}} of it as the only show on public radio other than [...] "Car Talk" [...] that both <b>Daniel</b> <b>Schorr</b> <b>news</b> <b>analyst</b> and Kurt Cobain singer/guitarist of Nirvana could listen to.

And the fact that public radio never puts a new show on the air or takes any off is definitely to our advantage.|$|R
