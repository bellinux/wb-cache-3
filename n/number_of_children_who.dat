She was raised from the floor hanging on a mirrored cross wearing a red blouse and velvet pants, with a crown of thorns on her head. During the performance, the number 12million flashed above her on the stage's backdrop screens, along with images of African children. This was intended to detail the estimated <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>children</b> <b>who</b> have been orphaned by the AIDS pandemic in Africa.|$|E
5|$|The TRC {{concluded}} {{that it may be}} impossible to ever identify the number of deaths or missing children, {{in part because of the}} habit of burying students in unmarked graves. The work is further complicated by a pattern of poor record keeping by school and government officials, who neglected to keep reliable numbers about the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>children</b> <b>who</b> died or where they were buried. While most schools had cemeteries on site, their location and extent remain difficult to determine as cemeteries that were originally marked were found to have been later razed, intentionally hidden or built over.|$|E

Mulder is a believer in the paranormal, while the skeptical Scully has been {{assigned}} to debunk his work. In this episode, Mulder becomes obsessed with a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>children</b> <b>who</b> have vanished while investigating the bizarre disappearance {{of a young girl}} from her home. In the meanwhile, Scully fears that he is emotionally involved due to his sister's disappearance 27 years earlier. Her fears are heightened when Mulder's mother dies, apparently of suicide.|$|E

They considered that in Ballincollig, a growing town with a population of approximately 10000 people, there would be a sufficient <b>number</b> <b>of</b> rugby players to form a good team. The formation of a club would also be an amenity for large <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>children</b> <b>who</b> would be growing up there.

5|$|The {{government}} rejected most of {{the negative}} criticism. The DfES said that the database would only contain basic information and 'will certainly not be including any information on children's diet or school attainment'. Laming had said that information for every child needs to be kept {{so that they would}} not be at risk. The government denied any possibility of function creep. They rebutted the concerns over privacy, with a spokesman for the DfES saying 'we are conscious of the need to respect personal privacy'. Hodge said that the database would be secure, that it would not undermine child protection and that it would help various agencies share information. Hughes said that the database would be secure and that 'we are confident we are doing all we could to ensure security'. The government said that they were confident that the database complied with the Data Protection Act and the Human Rights Act. Paul Ennals, chief executive of the National Children's Bureau, said, 'the index is a proportionate response to a continuing problem and any action that helps reduce the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>children</b> <b>who</b> slip through the net must be welcome'.|$|E

Having a parent as a donor also has made it a lot easier for children - because both patients are in the same hospital and can help boost each other's morale.|$|E

What has changed is the volume <b>of</b> <b>children</b> <b>who</b> need care, and the resources available for their care. Like other African countries, Botswana is going through a process of rapid social, economic and cultural change. One of the characteristics of this change is the disintegration of the extended family.

25|$|In 2015, {{the country}} of India {{is home to the}} largest <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>children</b> <b>who</b> are working {{illegally}} in various industrial industries. Agriculture in India is the largest sector where many children work at early ages to help support their family. Many of these children are forced to work at young ages due to many family factors such as unemployment, a large number of family members, poverty, and lack of parental education. This is often the major cause of the high rate of child labour in India.|$|E

Perhaps the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>children</b> <b>who</b> committed crimes might have been reduced if the standards of living had been higher. Some of these children were living with their families in these desperate conditions, but there were also numerous homeless, destitute children living on the streets. Many children were turned out of their home and left to fend for themselves at an early age, and many more ran away because of ill treatment.|$|E
25|$|Victoria Day {{celebrations}} were {{marred by}} tragedy twice: In 1881, the passenger ferry Victoria overturned in the Thames River, near London, Ontario. The boat departed {{in the evening}} with 600 to 800 people on board—three times the allowable passenger capacity—and capsized part way across the river, drowning some 182 individuals, including a large <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>children</b> <b>who</b> had been with their families for Victoria Day picnics at Springbank Park. The event {{came to be known}} as the Victoria Day disaster. Then, on May 26, 1896, the Point Ellice Bridge disaster occurred in Victoria, British Columbia, when a bridge collapsed under the weight of a streetcar overloaded with passengers on their way to attend Victoria Day celebrations.|$|E

25|$|Under-reporting {{of deaths}} {{was also a}} problem. The death {{registration}} system, which was inadequate before the famine, was completely overwhelmed by {{the large number of}} deaths during the famine. In addition, many deaths went unreported so that family members of the deceased could continue to draw the deceased's food ration. Counting the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>children</b> <b>who</b> both were born and died between the 1953 and 1964 censuses is problematic. However, Ashton, et al. believe that because the reported number of births during the GLF seems accurate, the reported number of deaths should be accurate as well. Massive internal migration made both population counts and registering deaths problematic, though Yang believes the degree of unofficial internal migration was small and Cao's estimate takes internal migration into account.|$|E

500|$|As {{early as}} 1991 the school {{district}} began to plan for an additional high school. Initial projections were to add 2 new high schools to the then 6 operating by 2000. However a lack of funds allowed the construction of only one high school. The increasing <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>children</b> <b>who</b> attend public rather than non-public schools was attributed to part of the need. In 1974, 53% of children born in St. Paul later entered kindergarten in the city public schools. In 1990, 67% of the city's children attended public schools. Overcrowding was so severe that in 1992 a citizen's group recommended moving 9th grade back into junior high buildings. The overcrowding was blamed on a surge in the birthrate in Saint Paul and a sudden influx of students from the suburbs, an unusual occurrence in an inner city school district.

Some of the education system's problems include: [...] not enough financial resources to operate schools and salaries of the teachers, not enough materials to reconstruct damaged schools, and lack of machinery to print textbooks and provide school supplies. These are caused by the unstable government that cannot offer enough financial support since many schools are either damaged or used for other purposes. Due to warfare and destruction of schools, the education ministry, fortunately, was able to send teams to oversee primary and secondary schools' final exam in order to give students 15-16 school year certificates.
