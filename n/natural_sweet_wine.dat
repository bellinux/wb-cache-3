Previous to 2009 the minimum age to purchase any alcohol from off licensed premises was 16 years.

25|$|White wine is also {{a dessert}} wine. All choices are allowed even if the <b>sweet</b> and {{fortified}} <b>wines</b> {{are more suitable for}} this. Perfumed wines (Gewurztraminer, Muscat), sparkling, and <b>sweet</b> <b>wines</b> accord well with fruit desserts (salad, tart). The fortified and sparkling wines support rich desserts made with cream or butter. Crèmes brûlées or caramel which combine sugar and cream can be eaten with a <b>sweet</b> and lively <b>wine</b> such as Jurançon or a late harvest wine. Chocolate requires a very powerful wine so white wine selection is quite limited: a <b>natural</b> amber <b>sweet</b> <b>wine</b> is the best compromise.|$|R

25|$|For a <b>sweet</b> <b>wine,</b> {{fermentation}} {{is stopped}} before its end {{to keep some}} of the sugar: this is the Mutage (fortification). The fermentation can be stopped by adding Sulphur Dioxide (SO2) (sterilisation of wine), by sudden cooling (anaesthesia of yeasts), by sterile filtration (capturing the yeasts in a very fine mesh filter), {{or a combination of}} several of these methods. A rule of thumb for determining the point of mutage, which allows a good balance of acquired alcohol and residual sugar, is to leave as many potential degrees as the degrees acquired over 10% by volume. For <b>sweeter</b> dessert <b>wines</b> fermentation stops spontaneously by excess sugar and alcohol: Alcohol is waste from the yeast and it is poisonous in large doses. In the case of <b>sweet</b> <b>wines</b> an addition of wine alcohol stops the fermentation. FML is not done for <b>sweet</b> <b>wines</b> as the lactic bacteria preferentially degrades sugar which would give a lactic bite (<b>sweet</b> and sour <b>wine).</b> In addition, the balance of acidity and sugar in the wine supports vivacity.|$|R
