25|$|The {{purpose of}} radio {{resource}} management is {{to satisfy the}} data rates that are requested by the users of a cellular network. The main resources are time intervals, frequency blocks, and transmit powers. Each user has its own objective function that, for example, can represent some combination of the data rate, latency, and energy efficiency. These objectives are conflicting since the frequency resources are very scarce, thus {{there is a need}} for tight spatial frequency reuse which causes immense inter-user interference if not properly controlled. Multi-user MIMO techniques are nowadays used to reduce the interference by adaptive precoding. The network operator would like to both bring great coverage and high data rates, thus the operator would like to find a Pareto optimal solution that balance the total <b>network</b> <b>data</b> throughput and the user fairness in an appropriate subjective manner.|$|E

40|$|With {{the recent}} {{explosion}} of social network applications, active learning has increasingly {{become an important}} paradigm for classifying <b>networked</b> <b>data.</b> While existing re-search has shown promising results by exploiting network properties to improve the active learning performance, they are all based on a static setting where the number {{and the type of}} classes underlying the <b>networked</b> <b>data</b> remain sta-ble and unchanged. For most social network applications, the dynamic change of users and their evolving relation-ships, along with the emergence of new social events, often result in new classes that need to be immediately discov-ered and labeled for classication. This paper proposes a novel approach called ADLNET for active class discovery and learning with <b>networked</b> <b>data.</b> Our proposed method uses the Dirichlet process dened over class distributions to enable active discovery of new classes, and explicitly models label correlations in the utility function of active learning. Experimental results on two real-world <b>networked</b> <b>data</b> sets demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms other state-of-the-art methods...|$|R

2500|$|Triangulation method. In {{developed}} countries {{a high proportion}} of cars contain one or more mobile phones. The phones periodically transmit their presence information to the mobile phone network, even when no voice connection is established. In the mid-2000s, attempts were made to use mobile phones as anonymous traffic probes. As a car moves, so does the signal of any mobile phones that are inside the vehicle. By measuring and analysing <b>network</b> <b>data</b> using triangulation, pattern matching or cell-sector statistics (in an anonymous format), the data was converted into traffic flow information. With more congestion, there are more cars, more phones, and thus, more probes. In metropolitan areas, the distance between antennas is shorter and in theory accuracy increases. An advantage of this method is that no infrastructure needs to be built along the road; only the mobile phone network is leveraged. But in practice the triangulation method can be complicated, especially in areas where the same mobile phone towers serve two or more parallel routes (such as a motorway (freeway) with a frontage road, a motorway [...] (freeway) and a commuter rail line, two or more parallel streets, or a street that is also a bus line). By the early 2010s, the popularity of the triangulation method was declining.|$|E
50|$|In {{computer}} networks, self-similarity is {{a feature}} of <b>network</b> <b>data</b> transfer dynamics. When modeling <b>network</b> <b>data</b> dynamics the traditional time series models, such as an autoregressive moving average model (ARMA(p, q)), are not appropriate. This is because these models only provide {{a finite number of}} parameters in the model and thus interaction in a finite time window, but the <b>network</b> <b>data</b> usually have a long-range dependent temporal structure. A self-similar process is one way of modeling <b>network</b> <b>data</b> dynamics with such a long range correlation. This article defines and describes <b>network</b> <b>data</b> transfer dynamics {{in the context of a}} self-similar process.

Without the ability to communicate efficiently and effectively between disparate groups working on a project, an SHM system can be underused, misunderstood, or even abandoned. For this reason, this work seeks to evaluate visualization techniques in the field, identify flaws in current practices, and devise a new method for visualizing and accessing SHM data and metadata in 3 D. More precisely, the work presented here reflects a method and digital workflow for integrating SHM sensor <b>networks,</b> <b>data,</b> and metadata into a virtual reality environment by combining spherical imaging and informational modeling.
