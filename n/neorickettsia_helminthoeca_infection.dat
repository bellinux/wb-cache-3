40|$|Graduation date: 1973 The {{etiologic}} agent of {{salmon poisoning disease}} {{was found to be}} <b>Neorickettsia</b> <b>helminthoeca,</b> although a second organism, the Elokomin fluke fever agent, may also be involved in other areas. Primary cultures of dog leucocytes were found to support the in vitro cultivation of <b>Neorickettsia</b> <b>helminthoeca</b> as were canine sarcoma 503 cells and mouse lymphoblasts MB III. Quantitative methods were not applied to in vitro studies of multiplication of the rickettsia because it failed to grow sufficiently in laboratory animals or in chicken embryo yolk sacs to do so. By ultrastructural analysis it was learned that <b>Neorickettsia</b> <b>helminthoeca</b> was structurally similar to other rickettsiae. Rickettsial cells were seen as circular profiles or rod-shaped cells 0. 5 μ wide and up to 0. 7 μ. long. They were bounded by a cell wall and an underlying cytoplasmic membrane. Each of the membranes was a trilayered structure and showed the unit membrane structure. Koch's postulates were fulfilled as completely as possible for an organism that is an obligate intracellular parasite. <b>Neorickettsia</b> <b>helminthoeca</b> was found in all cases of salmon poisoning disease. The rickettsia was isolated and grown in culture. The isolated culture was found to reproduce the disease when inoculated into susceptible dogs. The rickettsia was observed in and recovered from the inoculated dog. <b>Neorickettsia</b> <b>helminthoeca</b> in cell systems {{can be used as a}} model to further investigate the host-parasite relationship...|$|R
25|$|Salmon {{poisoning}} {{disease is}} a fatal disease of dogs caused by infection with a type of rickettsia, either <b>Neorickettsia</b> <b>helminthoeca</b> or <b>Neorickettsia</b> elokominica. It results from eating raw salmon and {{is found in the}} Pacific Northwest.|$|R
50|$|None of {{the human}} cases of {{infection}} with either the North American or Siberian subspecies reveal <b>infection</b> by the <b>Neorickettsia</b> <b>helminthoeca</b> carried within the trematode, which was discovered in 1950. Infection by rickettsia helps to explain the more fatal outcome afflicting canids.|$|R
5000|$|The {{parasite}} is most {{known for}} its association with “salmon poisoning disease", which, left untreated, proves to be fatal to dogs and other canids. However, canids {{are affected by the}} <b>Neorickettsia</b> <b>helminthoeca</b> bacteria, for which N. salmincola acts as a vector, and not by the parasite itself.|$|R
40|$|The p 51 {{gene that}} encodes the major {{antigenic}} 51 -kDa protein in Neorickettsia risticii was identified in strains of Neorickettsia sennetsu and the Stellantchasmus falcatus agent {{but not in}} <b>Neorickettsia</b> <b>helminthoeca,</b> suggesting that p 51 -based diagnosis {{would be useful to}} distinguish among them. groESL sequencing results delineated the phylogenic relationships among Neorickettsia spp...|$|R
5000|$|Neorickettsia sennetsu causes Sennetsu ehrlichiosis. Unlike {{other forms}} of ehrlichiosis, Neorickettsia sennetsu is {{transmitted}} by trematodes from fish. [...] Neorickettsia risticii causes Potomac horse fever. <b>Neorickettsia</b> <b>helminthoeca</b> is found {{in association with the}} trematode Nanophyetus salmincola, and causes salmon poisoning disease in dogs and other canids. Neorickettsia elokominica causes a similar disease, Elokomin fluke fever, in canids and other species.|$|R
5000|$|Salmon {{poisoning}} disease (SPD) is a fatal {{disease of}} dogs and other canids {{caused by a}} rickettsial parasite, <b>Neorickettsia</b> <b>helminthoeca.</b> [...] It results from eating raw salmon, trout, or salamander and is common in the Pacific Northwest. These fish and amphibians are infected with the larvae of a fluke, Nanophyetus salmincola through an intermediate host, the snail Oxytrema plicifer. The larvae attaches to the intestine of the dog and the rickettsial parasites are released, causing severe gastrointestinal disease and systemic infection.|$|R
5000|$|Vectors are {{organisms that}} {{transmit}} parasites from one host to another. Juga plicifera stream snails are biological vectors for a larval stage of N. salmincola. Salmonid and some non-salmonid fish are vectors of the metacercariae of N. salmincola. Both fresh and ocean water fish can be parasitic vectors. Fish {{that act as}} second intermediate hosts are different species of the families Salmonidae, Cottidae, and Cyprinidae. Among the thirty-four natural and experimental secondary hosts found in scientific literature are the coastal cutthroat trout, rainbow trout, coho salmon, chum salmon, and kokanee salmon. [...] More infection occurs in salmonid fish, rather than non-salmonid fish. In particular, salmonid fish of the genera Salmo, Oncorhynchus, and Salvelinus {{play a significant role}} in the N. salmincola life cycle.The parasite itself is a vector for <b>Neorickettsia</b> <b>helminthoeca.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Nanophysiasis in dogs is {{much more}} serious than in humans. Scientists noticed almost 200 years ago that dogs that {{consumed}} raw fish sometimes died rather quickly. This “salmon poisoning”, while associated with the trematode Nanophyetus salmincola is not caused by the worm. The sickness is caused by <b>Neorickettsia</b> <b>helminthoeca,</b> a rickettsial bacteria that uses the N. salmincola as a host. Although only canines are susceptible to the disease raccoons show a raised temperature and lymphatic infection after being infected by the rickettsia, but both soon subside. [...] The incubation period in dogs is 5-7 days, although it may {{take as long as}} 33 days. After onset, there is a sharp fever coupled with anorexia, vomiting and dysentery. The rickettsia attacks the canine’s lymph system causing enlarging and eventually hemorrhaging many of the lymphnodes. The disease can spread to other tissues such as leukocytes. Death occurs 10-14 days after signs first appear.|$|R
40|$|Dogs orally {{infected}} with <b>Neorickettsia</b> <b>helminthoeca</b> developed immunoglobulin G titers against Erlichia risticii, Erlichia sennetsu, and Erlichia canis {{similar to those}} against N. helminthoeca antigen, as determined by immunofluorescence. Western immunoblotting showed that the major common antigens shared among the microorganisms were 80 - or 78 -kDa and 64 -kDa polypeptides. In contrast, horse anti-E. risticii and anti-E. sennetsu and dog anti-E. canis sera reacted more weakly to N. helminthoeca antigen than to homologous antigens in both immunofluorescence and Western immunoblotting. Antisera raised in other species of animals, i. e., mouse anti-E. canis and rabbit anti-E. risticii and anti-E. sennetsu sera, however, all reacted with the 64 -kDa antigen of N. helminthoeca. This strong antigenic cross-reactivity and similarity in Western immunoblotting reaction profiles indicate that N. helminthoeca is antigenically closely related to E. risticii and E. sennetsu and less so to E. canis. In both immunofluorescence and Western immunoblotting, E. canis shared fewer common antigens with E. risticii and E. sennetsu than N. helminthoeca did. It is reasonable to conclude that these results may have both diagnostic and taxonomic significance...|$|R
40|$|Salmon {{poisoning}} {{disease in}} dogs {{has previously been}} reported in North America only along the western coast of the U. S. A. This paper presents the findings from eight affected dogs recently diagnosed on Vancouver Island, Canada. The clinical signs shown by these dogs were lethargy, anorexia, pyrexia and lymph node enlargement. The causative agent, <b>Neorickettsia</b> <b>helminthoeca</b> was observed in macrophages obtained from lymph node aspirates. This organism is transmitted to dogs in cysts of the fluke Nanophyetus salmincola salmincola within the tissues of the salmon or trout. The presence of fluke eggs in the feces of dogs showing typical signs is very suggestive of a diagnosis of salmon poisoning disease. Appropriate treatment, including chloramphenicol or oxytetracycline and fluid therapy, resulted in recovery. Prevention of salmon poisoning disease in endemic areas {{can be achieved by}} advising owners against allowing their dogs to eat raw salmon or trout. We suggest, based on the diagnoses made in these eight dogs, that Vancouver Island now be considered an endemic area for salmon poisoning disease...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1968 The {{presence}} of the etiologic agent of "salmon poisoning" disease, <b>Neorickettsia</b> <b>helminthoeca,</b> was demonstrated in eggs of the trematode vector, Nanophyetus salmincola. Three dogs were given 100, 000 and one dog 82, 000 ground fluke eggs by intraperitoneal injection. The four animals developed "salmon poisoning" disease and died. One of these dogs had been given 100, 000 intact eggs previously; this inoculum did not produce the disease. Two dogs that received either intact or ground adult flukes intraperitoneally also died from "salmon poisoning" disease. Noninjected control dogs remained healthy in all instances. Lymph nodes removed from a dog that had been injected with 82, 000 ground eggs and had died from the disease were injected intraperitoneally into a susceptible dog. After this dog developed signs of "salmon poisoning" disease, it was given antibiotic therapy and allowed to recover. This animal was shown to be immune to the disease by challenge with N. salmincola metacercariae from fish. A susceptible control dog given {{the same number of}} metacercariae developed the disease and died. Intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies were seen in stained lymph node cells from all dogs that developed the disease...|$|R
40|$|Ehrlichiae are strict {{intracellular}} bacterial pathogens that parasitize leukocytes {{or other}} blood cells. Only six {{agents of the}} tribe Ehrlichieae, namely, Cowdria ruminantium, <b>Neorickettsia</b> <b>helminthoeca,</b> Ehrlichia risticii, Ehrlichia sennetsu, Ehrlichia canis, and Ehrlichia chaffeensis, have been adapted to growth in continuous cell lines. E. chaffeensis, the agent of human ehrlichiosis, has been cultured only in a cell line of canine origin. We adapted purified cell-free E. chaffeensis for growth in human embryonic lung (HEL) fibroblasts (HEL 299), green monkey kidney cells (Vero), and a human cervical epithelioid carcinoma (HeLa) cell line. We observed a cytopathic effect with both Vero cells and HEL cells and plaque formation with cellular lysis when infected Vero {{cells were cultured in}} agar. Human fibroblasts are already commonly used for the isolation of viruses, coexiellae, and rickettsiae. Furthermore, the capability of these cells to support the growth of ehrlichiae suggests that they may be useful for primary isolation of ehrlichiae as well. The cytopathic effect produced in Vero or HEL cells offers a very helpful indicator of the infection. Plaque formation in Vero cells is a new phenomenon not yet reported for ehrlichiae and will allow the titration of inocula and clonal purification of this bacterium...|$|R
40|$|A partial 16 S rRNA gene was amplified in Ehrlichia canis-infected cells by nested PCR. The assay was {{specific}} {{and did not}} amplify the closely related Ehrlichia chaffeensis, Ehrlichia muris, <b>Neorickettsia</b> <b>helminthoeca,</b> and SF agent 16 S rRNA genes. The assay was as sensitive as Southern hybridization, detecting as little as 0. 2 pg of E. canis DNA. By this method, all blood samples from four dogs experimentally infected with E. canis were positive as early as day 4 postinoculation, which was before or {{at the time of}} seroconversion. One hundred five blood samples from dogs from Arizona and Texas (areas of E. canis endemicity) and 30 blood samples from dogs from Ohio (area of E. canis nonendemicity) were examined by nested PCR and immunofluorescent-antibody (IFA) test. Approximately 84 % of dogs from Arizona and Texas had been treated with doxycycline before submission of blood specimens. Among Arizona and Texas specimens, 46 samples were PCR positive (44 %) and 80 were IFA positive (76 %). Forty-three of 80 IFA-positive samples (54 %) were PCR positive, and 22 of 25 IFA-negative samples (88 %) were negative in the nested PCR. None of the Ohio specimens were IFA positive, but 5 specimens were PCR positive (17 %). Our results indicate that the nested PCR is highly sensitive and specific for detection of E. canis and may be more useful in assessing the clearance of the organisms after antibiotic therapy than IFA, especially in areas in which E. canis is endemic...|$|R
40|$|An {{infectious}} agent was {{isolated from the}} enlarged spleen of a wild mouse, Eothenomys kageus, by intraperitoneal inoculation of the spleen homogenate into laboratory mice. The laboratory mice developed splenomegaly, and the agent was maintained by serial passage of spleen homogenates in laboratory mice. The agent in the spleen homogenate was inactivated after incubation at 37 or 50 degrees C. Tetracyclines were effective in preventing infection of mice with this agent, but penicillin and sulfonamides were ineffective. Cytoplasmic inclusion bodies were observed in the peritoneal macrophages of infected mice. Electron microscopy revealed numerous small pleomorphic cocci within membrane-lined vacuoles in the cytoplasm of splenic macrophages. Morphologically similar to the ehrlichial organisms, each organism {{was surrounded by a}} distinct plasma membrane and rippled outer cell membrane without a distinct peptidoglycan layer. The agent did not grow in chicken embryos, and the Weil-Felix test result was negative. In the indirect fluorescent-antibody test, the agent reciprocally cross-reacted with Ehrlichia canis and cross-reacted somewhat with Ehrlichia sennetsu but did not cross-react with Ehrlichia risticii, <b>Neorickettsia</b> <b>helminthoeca,</b> Rickettsia tsutsugamushi, or Chlamydia spp. The mouse antiserum against this agent reacted with 64 -, 47 -, 46 -, 44 -, and 40 -kDa proteins of E. canis by Western blotting (immunoblotting). Since E. canis and closely related Ehrlichia chaffeensis and Ehrlichia ewingii are not known to proliferate or cause splenomegaly in mice, these results suggest that the agent is a new species within the tribe Ehrlichieae of the family Rickettsiaceae. The finding suggests that wild rodents may serve as reservoirs for pathogenic ehrlichiae...|$|R
40|$|Experimental {{evidence}} is presented supporting {{the development of}} a system for the isolation and propagation of a Neorickettsia sp. in a continuous canine macrophage cell line (DH 82). To isolate a Neorickettsia sp. pathogenic to the canine species, three naive dogs were fed metacercaria-encysted kidneys of salmon caught in a river where infection of metacercariae with <b>Neorickettsia</b> <b>helminthoeca</b> has been circumstantially known for decades. Clinically, the classic course of salmon poisoning disease developed in all of the dogs. Parasitemia began on day 8 to 11 postinfection, when the dogs developed a febrile peak, and continued until euthanasia. At necropsy, characteristic gross and microscopic lesions of the disease were present. A Neorickettsia sp. was also isolated from liver and spleen samples of these animals. The isolates have been continuously propagated and passed in DH 82 cells for more than 6 months. Electron microscopic examination confirmed that the rickettsial organisms multiplied in the membrane-bound compartment of DH 82 cells and that they morphologically closely resembled rickettsia belonging to the genus Ehrlichia. An indirect fluorescent antibody test using Neorickettsia organisms cultured in DH 82 cells showed that all dogs seroconverted 13 to 15 days postinfection. Finally, inoculation of the cell-cultured Neorickettsia organisms into a naive dog reproduced clinically typical salmon poisoning disease which was of greater severity and had a more rapid time course than that in the dogs from which the original isolation was made. On the basis of the clinical and pathologic responses of the dogs in our study, we believe that virulent N. helminthoeca was isolated and cultured in a continuous cell line...|$|R
40|$|The {{sequence}} of the citrate synthase gene (gltA) of 13 ehrlichial species (Ehrlichia chaffeensis, Ehrlichia canis, Ehrlichia muris, an Ehrlichia species recently detected from Ixodes ovatus, Cowdria ruminantium, Ehrlichia phagocytophila, Ehrlichia equi, the human granulocytic ehrlichiosis [HGE] agent, Anaplasma marginale, Anaplasma centrale, Ehrlichia sennetsu, Ehrlichia risticii, and <b>Neorickettsia</b> <b>helminthoeca)</b> have been determined by degenerate PCR and the Genome Walker method. The ehrlichial gltA genes are 1, 197 bp (E. sennetsu and E. risticii) to 1, 254 bp (A. marginale and A. centrale) long, and GC contents of the gene vary from 30. 5 % (Ehrlichia sp. detected from I. ovatus) to 51. 0 % (A. centrale). The percent identities of the gltA nucleotide sequences among ehrlichial species were 49. 7 % (E. risticii versus A. centrale) to 99. 8 % (HGE agent versus E. equi). The percent identities of deduced amino acid sequences were 44. 4 % (E. sennetsu versus E. muris) to 99. 5 % (HGE agent versus E. equi), whereas the homology range of 16 S rRNA genes was 83. 5 % (E. risticii versus the Ehrlichia sp. detected from I. ovatus) to 99. 9 % (HGE agent, E. equi, and E. phagocytophila). The architecture of the phylogenetic trees constructed by gltA nucleotide sequences or amino acid sequences {{was similar to that}} derived from the 16 S rRNA gene sequences but showed more-significant bootstrap values. Based upon the alignment analysis of the ehrlichial gltA sequences, two sets of primers were designed to amplify tick-borne Ehrlichia and Neorickettsia genogroup Ehrlichia (N. helminthoeca, E. sennetsu, and E. risticii), respectively. Tick-borne Ehrlichia species were specifically identified by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) patterns of AcsI and XhoI with the exception of E. muris and the very closely related ehrlichia derived from I. ovatus for which sequence analysis of the PCR product is needed. Similarly, Neorickettsia genogroup Ehrlichia species were specifically identified by RFLP patterns of RcaI digestion. If confirmed this technique will be useful in rapidly identifying Ehrlichia spp...|$|R
