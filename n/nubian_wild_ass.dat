One or both features appear sometimes in the domestic donkey, the domestic descendant of the African wild asses.|$|E
50|$|In 2014/2015, a {{mitochondrial}} DNA {{analysis was}} conducted on a population of feral donkeys on the Caribbean island of Bonaire. The study included DNA samples from the Bonaire animals, museum specimens of <b>Nubian</b> <b>wild</b> <b>asses,</b> sequences from four Somali <b>wild</b> <b>asses,</b> and a sequence from one Domestic donkey, used as a control. The results found that the Bonaire animals were very close to known pure <b>Nubian</b> <b>wild</b> <b>asses</b> and very different from other asses. However, research published in 2010 found that modern donkeys are descended from two lineages of <b>wild</b> <b>ass,</b> one being <b>Nubian</b> and the other being of unknown ancestry. This being the case, {{the fact that only}} one donkey was used in the test suggests that the findings are rather inconclusive. For more conclusive results to be found, more testing must be completed with a larger group of donkeys. Additionally, the analysis was a result of an outcry over the government of Bonaire planning a cull of the feral animals, leading to the possibility of the results being slightly biased towards shutting down the cull.|$|R

40|$|Genetic {{data from}} extant donkeys (Equus asinus) have {{revealed}} two distinct mitochondrial DNA haplogroups, suggestive of two separate domestication events in northeast Africa about 5000 years ago.

Our analysis of ancient archaeological and historic museum samples provides the first genetic information on the historic <b>Nubian</b> <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> (Equus africanus africanus), Somali wild ass (Equus africanus somaliensis) and ancient donkey. The results demonstrate that the <b>Nubian</b> <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> was an ancestor of the first donkey haplogroup.

40|$|Resumen del trabajo presentado al 5 th AGM Working Group meeting, celebrado en Basel (Switzerland) del 4 al 6 de junio de 2012. [...] et al. Domestic donkey (Equus asinus) {{arose in}} Africa 5000 years ago. In modern populations, Equus asinus {{mitochondrial}} diversity displays two main haplogroups (Clades 1 & 2). These clades represent two separate maternal origins from North African wild populations; one of Nubian origin (Equus africanus africanus) and other from relatives to Somali wild asses (Equus africanus somaliensis). It {{has been suggested}} that Phoenicians introduced the domestic donkey to the Iberian Peninsula during 8 th‐ 7 th centuries BC. Thus, the modern Iberian domestic donkeys would be the descendents of these allochthonous animals. In order to test the number of Clades present in Iberia in ancient times, we have analysed Equus asinus mitochondrial DNA from samples associated to the beginning of 4 th century BC and recovered from Cancho Roano sanctuary (Zalamea de la Serena, Badajoz). Four teeth were analysed, with morphological characters indicating an ass‐like equid, and representing, at least, two different individuals. A sample from each individual was 14 C dated, yielding both the same chronology, 2460 ± 40 years BP. We carried out DNA extraction, nucleotide positions 15439 ‐ 15837 from the mitochondrial DNA control region. Haplotypes appeared in Clades 1 & 2, close or identical to historical <b>Nubian</b> <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> (Equus africanus africanus) and different to Somali wild ass (Equus africanus somaliensis). These results show that both clades were already present in early descendants of those domestic donkeys introduced by the Phoenicians to Iberia. Peer Reviewe...|$|E

50|$|The Asiatic <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> {{is larger}} than African <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> at about 290 kg and 2.1 m (head-body length). They are reddish-brown or yellowish-brown in color and have broad dorsal stripe on {{the middle of the}} back. Unlike most horses and donkeys, onagers have never been domesticated. They are among the fastest mammals, as they can run as fast as 64 km/h (40 mph) to 70 km/h (43 mph). The onager is closely related to the African <b>wild</b> <b>ass,</b> as they both shared the same ancestor.

40|$|Long-distance migrations of {{wildlife}} {{have been identified}} as important biological phenomena, but their conservation remains a major challenge. The Mongolian Gobi {{is one of the last}} refuges for the Asiatic <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> (Equus hemionus) and other threatened migratory mammals. Using historic and current distribution ranges, population genetics, and telemetry data we assessed the connectivity of the <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> population in the context of natural and anthropogenic landscape features and the existing network of protected areas. In the Mongolian Gobi mean biomass production is highly correlated with human and livestock density and seems to predict <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> occurrence at the upper level. The current <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> distribution range largely falls into areas below the 250  gC/m 2 /year productivity isoline, suggesting that under the present land use more productive areas have become unavailable for <b>wild</b> <b>asses.</b> Population genetics results identified two subpopulations and delineated a genetic boundary between the Dzungarian and Transaltai Gobi for which the most likely explanation are the mountain ranges separating the two areas. Home ranges and locations of 19 radiomarked <b>wild</b> <b>asses</b> support the assumed restricting effects of more productive habitats and mountain ranges and additionally point towards a barrier effect of fences. Furthermore, telemetry data shows that in the Dzungarian and Transaltai Gobi individual <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> rarely ventured outside of the protected areas, whereas in the southeast Gobi asses only spend a small fraction of their time within the protected area network. Conserving the continuity of the <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> population will need a landscape level approach, also including multi-use landscapes outside of protected areas, particularly in the southeast Gobi. In the southwest Gobi, allowing for openings in the border fence to China and managing the border area as an ecological corridor would connect three large protected areas together covering over 70, 000  km 2 of <b>wild</b> <b>ass</b> habitat...|$|R
