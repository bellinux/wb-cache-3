Generally, methods for determination of SNR are based on using of experimentally defined power of noise level, or some conditional <b>noise</b> <b>criterion</b> which can be specified for signal processing. In the present work we describe method for determination of SNR of chaotic and stochastic signals at unknown power levels of signal and noise.

Our approach is based on sampling space-filling curves mapped onto mesh segments via parametrizations aligned with the tensor field.

The sample distributions are of high quality: they fulfil the blue <b>noise</b> <b>criterion,</b> so have minimal artifacts due to regularity of sampling patterns, and they accurately represent isotropic and anisotropic densities {{on the plane and}} on mesh surfaces.

However, an easily usable screening criteria for assessing the potential for acoustic fatigue for operating installations has not been readily available to industry at large. Based upon theory and empirical measurements, a near-field sound pressure level screening method has been developed for evaluating piping systems. A case history will be presented that will incorporate the use of the near-field <b>noise</b> screening <b>criteria</b> for risk assessment in an existing installation.

40|$|A {{number of}} indoor <b>noise</b> <b>criteria</b> systems {{are used to}} {{quantify}} the background noise in a built environment, including <b>Noise</b> <b>Criteria</b> (NC), Balanced <b>Noise</b> <b>Criteria</b> (NCB), Room Criteria (RC), Room Criteria Mark II (RC Mark II), A-weighted Equivalent Sound Pressure Level (LAeq), and others. An on-going debate exists in the acoustical community over which criterion is the most appropriate {{to use in the}} variety of ambient noise situations encountered. In an effort to quantitatively support the use of individual criterion, this project subjectively correlates these various criteria with human task performance and perception. Eleven subjects participated in a pilot study by completing typing and proofreading tasks, as well as subjective ratings of loudness, annoyance, and spectral quality. Results show that {{there were no significant differences}} in productivity scores among the 12 noise exposures tested; however, significant relationships were found between indoor <b>noise</b> <b>criteria</b> predictions of level and subjective perception of loudness and annoyance. In this study, RC and RC-Mark II were found to be the most correlated with level perception, although NC, NCB, and LAeq were also strongly correlated. Additionally, interesting relationships were found between subjective perceptions of rumble or roar and criteria predictions of such. The authors are in the process of extending the pilot study to more subjects, as well as examining the effects of tonal and fluctuating background noise spectra on criteria predictions...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACTThe indoor {{noise of}} a ship is usually {{determined}} using the A-weighted sound pressure level. However, {{in order to better}} understand this phenomenon, evaluation parameters that more accurately reflect the human sense of hearing are required.

40|$|This {{research}} investigated {{differences in}} task performance and perception under six non-time-varying ventilation-type background noise spectra with differing tonality. The results {{were related to}} five indoor <b>noise</b> <b>criteria</b> systems: <b>Noise</b> <b>Criteria</b> (NC), Balanced <b>Noise</b> <b>Criteria</b> (NCB), Room Criteria (RC), Room Criteria Mark II (RC-Mark II), and the A-weighted equivalent sound pressure level (LAeq). These criteria systems are commonly used in the U. S. building industry, but concerns exist over whether they are appropriate for all noise situations. Thirty test subjects completed three types of performance tasks (typing, reasoning, and math) and answered questions about {{their perception of the}} indoor environment under each noise condition. Results showed that performance scores did not change significantly across the six noise conditions, but there were differences in subjective perception. For example, perception trends for tonality, annoyance, and distraction changed based on the frequency and prominence of discrete tones in noise. However, these perceptual changes were not fully reflected in the criteria level or spectral quality ratings. Additionally, task performance was related to subjective perception but not to criteria level predictions. As a result, the authors suggest that the current criteria should be modified to account for the frequency and prominence of tones in background noise...|$|E
40|$|Background: This Noise control {{case study}} is about problems, {{constraints}} and design solutions for a proposed magnetic resonance imaging system (MRI) installation in an existing medical research facility. This is a companion paper to a structural vibration control case study on the same installation presented by this author at ICSV 10 in 2003. Objective: Manufacturer’s data indicated that airborne sound level emissions over a broad frequency span could exceed permissible <b>noise</b> <b>criteria</b> for nearby occuppied rooms. Previous experience with MRI’s indicated possibility of structure borne vibration induced by airborne sound {{that could result in}} radiated noise in other spaces. Containment design was required for anticipated loud and annoying noises in the magnet room, to prevent excessive or annoying and distracting noise to MRI control room or other adjacent (but unrelated) office spaces. In addition, the structure borne vibration paths needed attenuation or isolation. M e t h o d s: Proposed architectural designs would utilize steel stud framing with gypsum wallboard, and would incorporate continuous sheet copper EMI shielding. The building structure was reinforced concrete. Wall, partition, window, door, air conditioning ducts and other penetration designs were developed to accommodate the required shielding and proposed construction methods. Material selections and decoupled assembly configurations were based on anticipated source sound MRI Room From Control Room levels and receiver room permissible <b>noise</b> <b>criteria.</b> Results: Post-construction airborne sound transmission loss measurements are compared with <b>noise</b> <b>criteria</b> to show quantitative result of the design. Photos of the MRI suite are shown. The final result satisfies acoustical criteria and occupants ' subjective evaluations. Conclusion: This case study demonstrates the advantage of decoupling structure borne vibration paths and matching airborne transmission loss barrier performance to sound source spectra to achieve <b>noise</b> <b>criteria.</b> 59...|$|E

40|$|Overall {{loudness}} is not {{the only}} quality of indoor background noise that affects occupants. The distribution of noise across frequency (pitch), whether or not the noise contains tones, and whether or not the noise changes over time must also be considered. There are several indoor <b>noise</b> <b>criteria</b> systems available to quantify the background noise in rooms, but many of them do not account for these factors. These systems are commonly used by architects and engineers, and often incorporated into manufacturer’s data, design guides, and standards. There is much debate over which of the criteria systems best reflect how occupants will respond to noise. To examine these issues, an extensive study is being completed at the University of Nebraska investigating the effects of various types of air-conditioning noise on occupant productivity and perception. Results from performance tests and questionnaires are used to evaluate a number of these <b>noise</b> <b>criteria</b> systems.

40|$|Several <b>noise</b> <b>criteria</b> methods {{commonly}} used in architectural acoustics have been quantitatively related to human noise perception and task performance {{under a variety of}} heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems-induced background noise conditions. The five criteria examined were: <b>Noise</b> <b>Criteria</b> (NC), Balanced <b>Noise</b> <b>Criteria</b> (NCB), Room Criteria (RC), Room Criteria Mark II (RC Mark II), and A-weighted Equivalent Sound Pressure Level (LAeq). ^ The project was completed over three phases. Phase I included twelve background noise conditions controlled to be non-varying over time and non-tonal, while exhibiting neutral, rumbly, roaring, or hissy characteristics. Phase II was conducted as an intermediate study to examine specifically the effects of exposure time length and types of performance tasks used. Phase III investigated the effects of background noise exposures containing various levels of discrete tones across a frequency range from 120 to 595 Hz. Under each noise condition, subjects completed performance tasks and answered questions about their perception of the acoustic environment. ^ Results show that task performance is significantly affected by occupant perception of noise, but this relationship is not fully demonstrated by the criteria systems analyzed. It was also found that the five criteria analyzed are generally well suited in describing subjective loudness perception, but that some discrepancies in criteria ratings of spectral quality and subjective perception exist. Finally, perception of annoyance and tonality changed based on the frequency and prominence of discrete tones in noise, but these changes were not reflected in the criteria level or spectral quality ratings. Based on the findings of this work, modifications to the existing criteria are recommended. ...|$|E
