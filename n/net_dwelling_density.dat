This article questions its relation with dwelling structure as per the Australian Bureau of Statistics 2 ̆ 7 (ABS 2 ̆ 7) STRD classification. The enquiry uncovers homogenous concentrations of individual classes of dwellings in Australian metropolises from which density measures based on current market acceptance and physical build out are estimated. Speculation attends the highest <b>dwelling</b> <b>density</b> which cities could support, {{as well as a}} concept of climax density based on a contraction of dwelling size. The study concludes that the ABS classification relates in some measure to achieved <b>dwelling</b> <b>density</b> but, adjusted, could offer further guidance. Several broader policy angles emerge from the project, concerning first-mover advantage, planning gain, the national lifestyle and the congruence of visions in strategic planning...|$|R
40|$|<b>Dwelling</b> <b>density</b> {{is a tool}} used to predict, {{describe}} and control land use. Through policy guidance, targets are created that promote efficient use of land, reduce the operation of private transportation and increase mixed use. However, decision makers often are unsure how these targets translate into practice at the site scale and how sustainability is impacted. This paper examines one such site in Lancaster, in the northwest of the UK – Luneside East. Local authority policy on <b>dwelling</b> <b>density,</b> both at the site and local scale, is outlined. A sustainability solution (i. e. an action taken today {{in the name of}} sustainability) and intended benefit are taken from the policy (i. e. high <b>dwelling</b> <b>density</b> to improve efficiency of land use) and analysed using a futures methodology to understand whether the solution is resilient to whatever the future holds. The analysis is discussed alongside other sustainability issues and solutions...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Evidence of {{associations}} between neighborhood built environments and transport-related physical activity (PA) is accumulating, but {{few studies have}} investigated associations with leisure-time PA. OBJECTIVE: We investigated associations of five objectively measured characteristics of the neighborhood built environment-destination access, street connectivity, <b>dwelling</b> <b>density,</b> land-use mix and streetscape quality-with residents' self-reported PA (transport, leisure, and walking) and accelerometer-derived measures of PA. METHODS: Using a multicity stratified cluster sampling design, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of 2, 033 adults who lived in 48 New Zealand neighborhoods. Multilevel regression modeling, which was adjusted for individual-level (sociodemographic and neighborhood preference) and neighborhood-level (deprivation) confounders, was used to estimate associations of built environment with PA. RESULTS: We found that 1 -SD increases in destination access, street connectivity, and <b>dwelling</b> <b>density</b> were associated with any versus no self-reported transport, leisure, or walking PA, with increased odds ranging from 21 % [street connectivity with leisure PA, 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 0 %, 47 %] to 44 % (destination accessibility with walking, 95 % CI: 17 %, 79 %). Among participants who self-reported some PA, a 1 -SD increase in street connectivity {{was associated with a}} 13 % increase in leisure PA (95 % CI: 0, 28 %). SD increases in destination access, street connectivity, and <b>dwelling</b> <b>density</b> were each associated with 7 % increases in accelerometer counts. CONCLUSIONS: Associations of neighborhood destination access, street connectivity, and <b>dwelling</b> <b>density</b> with self-reported and objectively measured PA were moderately strong, indicating the potential to increase PA through changes in neighborhood characteristics.

Urban density patterns were spatially explored using a 1 X 1 kilometre grid that reflects the spatial variability and levels of densification within the urban growth boundary. Two techniques were employed to capture {{the change in}} <b>dwelling</b> <b>density.</b> First, a buffer analysis is used to test the difference in the <b>dwelling</b> <b>density</b> patterns between different buffer zones generated around the Melbourne CBD and the &# 039;activity centres&# 039;. The ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) results for this part indicate that urban densities across the buffer zones around the Melbourne CBD are statistically different; while the degree of densification around the activity centres between the first two zones (i. e. less than 500 metres and 500 metres to 1 kilometre) are statistically insignificant. Second, the densification proposed in the plan to encourage more multi-level/unit developments has been measured using a spatial autocorrelation measure. The results for this part reveal a decline in the Moran&# 039;s I computed for 2001 and 2006. This might suggest that densification is just not restricted to the target areas (e. g. activity centres) as the evidence of higher density housing development can be seen widely across the metropolis...|$|R

40|$|The {{incidence}} of change to existing houses and gardens within England's interwar residential areas is examined, the focus being on sample areas originally developed by private enterprise in Birmingham and London. Larger-scale changes, mostly subject to development control {{by the local}} authority, notably the building of additional houses within existing gardens, subdivisions and amalgamations of houses, changes of use, extensions and other significant structural works, are distinguished from changes initiated by households without planning permission, and often without building permission, such as changes to chimneys, reroofing, and changes to doors, windows, porches, and gardens. Changes subject to development control are negatively correlated, and smaller-scale changes are positively correlated, with the <b>dwelling</b> <b>density</b> at which the sample areas were originally developed. Among the factors responsible for this are the greater susceptibility of the areas of higher <b>dwelling</b> <b>density</b> to the contagious diffusion of minor and cosmetic changes. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{analysis}} of refugee and IDP (internally displaced persons) camps from VHSR (very high spatial resolution) satellite imagery can assist humanitarian relief organisations by providing population estimations and camp structure analysis based on automated dwelling extraction. Since smooth transferability of rulesets {{in a fine}} scale and high complexity environment is limited, we present an approach of developing and transferring master rulesets. The master ruleset aims to automate OBIA (object-based image analysis) tasks which {{can be seen as}} more or less independent from different sensors and geographic areas, such as adapted segmentations based on edge densities to delineate man-made structures or classifications based on shape and context. Only some steps within the classification process which are based on hard-coded values (size constraints, spectral thresholds) have to be adapted. This approach reduces the time required to analyse different IDP camps or the same camp at different times. In previous work, the master ruleset has been developed for the IDP camp Zam Zam in Darfur, Sudan, using QuickBird imagery. In the study presented, the transferability of object-based image analysis rulesets was tested in a demonstrator exercise according to a request posed by the World Food Program (WFP). The aim was to extract dwelling structures and variations in <b>dwelling</b> <b>densities</b> in three IDP camps in West Darfur for estimating population figures using GeoEye- 1 imagery. Results were validated using independent visual interpretation, showing high agreement for all <b>dwelling</b> <b>density</b> classes and absolute numbers of extracted dwellings (15, 349 automated dwelling structures versus 14, 261 visually extracted dwelling structures) for the IDP camp Um Dukhun.

40|$|Urban {{economic}} theory states that transit improvements result in travel time savings and consequently warrant higher rents particularly with proximity to surrounding stations. This research uses the Sheppard subway corridor {{as a case}} study to test the established theories by measuring the changes to residential intensification and property values (1) as a function of time before and after the construction, and (2) as a function of distance to subway stations. Two metrics are established to observe residential intensification and property value: <b>Dwelling</b> <b>Density</b> and Value <b>Density</b> respectively. <b>Dwelling</b> <b>Density</b> is the number of dwellings contained in its property parcel divided by property area; Value Density is total property value of a given property parcel divided by its property area. Using obtained property sales data in four identified analysis years (1991, 1996, 2001, and 2006) and ArcGIS, spatial interpolation surfaces are generated to visualize the changes on a geographical plane through time. <b>Dwelling</b> and Value <b>Density</b> scatterplots are generated by extracting values from the interpolated surfaces and computing its distance to the nearest subway station and to major development nodes. The generated interpolated surfaces show a strong increase in <b>Dwelling</b> and Value <b>Density</b> in North York Centre which suggest that (1) planning policies succeeded in guiding residential growth, (2) a time lag is present of which the full benefits of rapid transit construction are realized, and (3) there may be positive network effects associated with the completion of the Sheppard subway. The scatterplot results demonstrated moderate change in <b>Dwelling</b> and Value <b>Density</b> at the Bayview station area and little change for the remaining stations (Bessarion, Don Mills, and Leslie) based on observations up to December 2006. The results warrant a degree of optimism about Sheppard subway’s ability to attract residential intensification and raise property values, especially given that data was analyzed only up to four years after the subway corridor began revenue service. It is recommended that a similar methodology be performed at a later date when the corridor’s ridership and surrounding development reaches maturity. A preliminary forecasting exercise determined that <b>Dwelling</b> and Value <b>Density</b> will rise, particularly surrounding stations that have since demonstrated little change in residential land use...|$|R
40|$|Built-up {{areas have}} been {{expanding}} throughout the world. Monitoring and prediction of the build-up is not only important for the economic development but also acts as sentinels of environmental decline important for ecologically sustainable development of a region. The aim {{of this paper is}} to model the growth of built-up and residential-commercial dwellings over the recent past and thus predict the near future growth for a popular tourist destination of the Lower Hunter of New South Wales, Australia. The land use and land cover change analysis, based on classification of Landsat imageries from 1985 to 2005 at a 5 -yearly interval, indicates that built-up areas increased steadily; it was 2. 0 % of the total landscape in 1985 but increased to 4. 2 % by the year 2005. If this trend continues, the built-up area will have grown to over 6. 5 % by 2025 —which is equivalent to growth of over 325 % from the 1985 base. In order to further evaluate the residential and commercial growth, orthorectified aerial photographs of nearby periods of 1985, 1995 and 2005 were utilized to manually delineate residential/commercial dwellings, and thereby <b>dwelling</b> <b>densities</b> were derived.

In particular, by applying spatial hedonic models at the census tract level, this study examines the association between house prices and three neighborhood characteristics: crime rates, subway ridership and <b>dwelling</b> <b>density.</b> House prices were first explored by cluster analysis at multiple listing service (MLS) district level and results showed a significant spatial clustering of the prices in Toronto. Spatial hedonic models were then conducted on census tract level to examine the role of neighborhood characteristics in explaining the spatial patterns. The spatial mode was applied both across the entire city and separately in three neighborhoods divided by income level. Findings indicate that on the citywide scale, crime rates and <b>dwelling</b> <b>density</b> do not significantly influence house prices, but subway ridership was positively associated with house prices. In the middle-income neighborhood, six types of crime were found to significantly decrease house prices. Densities of all types of dwelling were found to be positively associated with house prices while apartment density decreases house prices in the middle-income neighborhood. Findings from this research can be applied to inform housing and transportation policies, regarding neighborhood improvement, housing affordability and smart growth. 4 month...|$|R

40|$|International audienceUrban density {{measures}} are broadly used in urban planning as tools for calculating development yields, defining indicative targets, or development controls. A century ago Raymond Unwin argued in the influential pamphlet "Nothing Gained by Overcrowding" that {{limiting the number}} of dwellings per land area would be the simplest and best way to avoid overcrowding of both buildings and people, a measure which became widespread. The same measure was used by Jane Jacobs when describing the minimum density required for a vital neighbourhood. This density measure is however highly problematic as it does not account for the size of dwellings, mix of uses or size of households, factors that vary significantly in time and space.

We will focus on findings from Australia - the Physical Activity in Localities and Community Environments (PLACE) study. PLACE is examining factors that may influence the prevalence and the social and spatial distribution of walking for transport and walking for recreation. A stratified two-stage cluster sampling strategy was used to select 32 urban communities (154 census collection districts), classified as high and low ‘walkable’ using a GISbased walkability index (<b>dwelling</b> <b>density,</b> intersection <b>density,</b> <b>net</b> retail area and land use mix) and matched for socio-economic status.

40|$|Objective: Many {{research}} papers {{examine the relationship}} of the built environment on transport behaviour using only one mode of transport. Yet to inform policy makers, a broader examination of transport mode choice across different transport modes is required. Here, associations between urban design attributes and transport mode choices including transport walking, transport cycling, public transport and private motor vehicle use were explored. Methods Secondary analysis was conducted on 16, 890 participants aged 18 years or older who participated in the Victorian Integrated Survey of Travel Activity 2009 - 2010 (VISTA 09) in metropolitan Melbourne, Australia. Adjusted multilevel logistic regression models were used to explore the relationship between urban design attributes and transport-walking, cycling, public transport and private motor vehicle use. Results Taking transport-walking, cycling or public transport trips was positively associated with the housing diversity score and gross <b>dwelling</b> <b>density.</b> Taking private motor vehicle trips was negatively associated with street connectivity, land use mix, local living score, housing diversity score, gross <b>dwelling</b> <b>density</b> and proximity to supermarkets.

40|$|The {{advocacy}} {{of the notion}} of &# 039;compact city&# 039; as a strategy to reduce urban sprawl, to support greater utilisation of existing infrastructure and services in more established areas and to improve connectivity of employment and transit hubs is vigorously debated in urban research. Using the urban residential density as a surrogate measure for urban compactness, this paper empirically examines the cadastre database that contains details of every property in order to capture changes in urban residential density patterns in Melbourne, Australia using geospatial techniques. The paper discusses the realisation of the density aspect of compact city policy implemented in Melbourne 2030 Plan. The policy of densification in pursuit of a more compact city has produced mixed results. The findings {{of this study indicate that}} urban densities across the buffer zones around Melbourne CBD are significantly different. The dwindling dwelling counts in the inner suburbs and a rapid densification of the inner outer zone is surprising, with urban development following contrasting patterns to what was anticipated to emerge after such a policy change. Contrary, the <b>dwelling</b> <b>density</b> around the designated Activity Centres between the first two zones are statistically insignificant - questioning the fundamental purpose of the compact city model to increase the residential density around significant economic and transit hubs. The &# 039;hollowing effect&# 039; (i. e. a localised reduction in <b>dwelling</b> <b>densities)</b> observed in the analysis around inner suburbs necessitates us to further examine the quality of data input particularly the coding of multi-storey developments and land sub-divisions into the cadastre database...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to assess the {{strengths}} and weaknesses of the municipal ofﬁcial plans to protect provincially evaluated wetlands from activities causing non-point source pollution within the Grand River watershed. An integrated framework for policy analysis involving both an evaluative and normative approach assists in determining the value of wetland protection policies and recommends future actions to guide decision-making on development adjacent to wetlands. Speciﬁcally, the objectives include (a) to locate, identify and measure the total wetland area, class and number of wetlands in the Grand River watershed on an upper- and lower-tier municipal basis; (b) to evaluate the extent of adjacent areas contributing surface water contamination to the wetlands in the Grand River watershed on an upper- and lower- tier municipal basis and by individual municipalities, thus establishing the risk due to degradation from non-point source pollution; (c) to determine the pressures of development by examining the changes in population and <b>dwelling</b> <b>density</b> from 1986 - 1994; (d) to identify the strengths and weaknesses of municipal governments from the viewpoint of the staff to implement municipal policies on wetlands; (e) to review and assess municipal official plans for wetlands, natural areas or hazard land policies to determine whether the municipalities effectively protect wetlands; and (f) to provide insight, based on this research, to guide protection or rehabilitation of wetlands at risk from non-point source pollution. Mapping showed that 7. 2 % of the watershed is covered by 220 named and evaluated wetlands. Seventy-one percent are provincially signiﬁcant and distributed within three-quarters of the lower-tier municipalities, mainly towns townships. Large portions of these natural areas are shared by neighbouring municipalities. All municipalities within the watershed experienced a growth in population and an increase in <b>dwelling</b> <b>density</b> during the period of wetland policy implementation. The largest population and <b>dwelling</b> <b>density</b> increases occurred in cities and villages or their adjacent municipalities. Generally, official plans policies throughout the watershed needs some improvement. Regional municipalities had the most adequate, while villages tended to have the least effective policies, given the lack of wetlands in these municipalities. The Grand River Conservation Authority and the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources are considered to be the agencies with the expertise and strength to protect wetlands. Half of all respondents to the municipal staff survey do not have the resources to effectively protect wetlands due to inadequate finances and a lack of staff expertise in environmental issues. Disinterested landowners and a lack of understanding the value of wetlands are also impediments to wetland protection. Education and awareness programs for the public were considered beneﬁcial. The thesis concludes with several recommendations which may assist the Province and municipalities to develop planning initiatives to effectively and efficiently protect the remaining wetlands in the Grand River watershed...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Previous land use-transportation {{literature}} suggests that higher density, reduced segregation of land uses can reduce auto-dependency levels by making more services available within {{a short distance from}} housing location. Vehicle ownership has been considered as an independent choice modelled within travel demand systems, influenced by socio-economic characteristics of households.

In this paper, using Metropolitan Adelaide travel data, logit based models will be tested to explain vehicle ownership on the basis of household and urban features. The results provide evidence that some features of built environments including <b>dwelling</b> <b>density</b> and land use mix have varying degrees of influence on vehicle-ownership levels, thus they would be useful in addressing auto-dependency concerns in low density urban development through spatial planning...|$|R

One hundred and twenty-four Chinese-speaking adult residents of Hong Kong were recruited from neighbourhoods objectively differing in walkability (<b>dwelling</b> <b>density</b> and street connectivity) and socio-economic status (SES). They completed the interviewer-administered Chinese NEWS-A, and half of them were reassessed 7 - 10 days later. The Chinese NEWS-A had good test-retest-reliability. Residents of high walkable neighbourhoods reported higher residential density, land use mix, street connectivity, infrastructure and safety for walking but lower levels of traffic load, and fewer cul-de-sacs and hilly streets. Residents of higher SES areas reported higher aesthetics but less traffic and crime. Overall, this study lends support for the construct validity and reliability of the Chinese NEWS-A.

This study tested the hypothesis that higher walkability was associated with a lower cardiometabolic risk (CMR) for two administrative spatial units and three road buffers. Data were from the North West Adelaide Health Study first wave of data collected between 2000 and 2003. CMR was expressed as a cumulative sum of six clinical risk markers, selected to reflect components of the metabolic syndrome. Walkability was based on an established methodology and operationalised as <b>dwelling</b> <b>density,</b> intersection density, land-use mix and retail footprint. Walkability was associated with lower CMR for the three road buffer representations of the built environment but not for the two administrative spatial units. This may indicate a limitation in the use of administrative spatial units for analyses of walkability and health outcomes. ...|$|R
40|$|To {{increase}} {{the utility of}} satellite imagery {{as a source of}} cheap and current information for planning and managing cities some problems have to be resolved. One is information overload. As the spatial resolution of imagery increases to allow the identification of the individual components of urban form (street-blocks, buildings, gardens etc.), image interpretation (classifications into land-use categories or estimation of dwelling units) becomes less accurate. One answer is to adopt interpretation methods that use the increased information in a more detailed scene. This paper reports on attempts to measure the morphological patterns in an urban satellite scene and to use these for image interpretation. The interpretation task addressed is the estimation of residential dwelling units from the patterns discernible in high resolution satellite images of cities. The practical results include dwelling estimates that can be aggregated to any geographical unit of analysis, population estimates for cities and a <b>dwelling</b> <b>density</b> surface that can be categorised into any number of residential land-use classes. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Higher <b>dwelling</b> <b>densities</b> in low density {{cities such}} as Adelaide are being widely {{promoted}} by planners, policy-makers and academics to reduce travel time, increase accessibility and consolidate space within the existing urban area. This is largely {{in response to the}} negative impacts of 'urban sprawl' in suburban, car oriented cities in Australia and the United States. Mawson Lakes, in Adelaide, South Australia, has had a lot of marketing hype as the place to 'live, work and play', and the diverse housing options offered come in stark contrast to typical suburban housing developments constructed in the past. This research explored residents‟ level of satisfaction with this new urbanist development style, and drew comparisons to the similarly timed, suburban Blackwood Park development in the suburb of Craigburn Farm, South Australia. This study finds that higher density housing in Mawson Lakes delivered reduced levels of dwelling satisfaction, particularly in the areas of privacy, open space and value for money when compared with larger, detached homes in both developments. However, with respect to neighbourhood factors, this study finds that Mawson Lakes delivers greater levels of neighbourhood satisfaction, particularly in the areas of proximity to work, public transport services, shopping, and restaurants and cafés. This comes despite higher levels of residential dis-satisfaction in Mawson lakes, specifically in relation to concerns surrounding noise, pollution and safety. This project is significant because changes toward a focus of new urbanist development requires adjustments in beliefs and perceptions and will only be sustainable if higher density developments are places where the people of Adelaide want to live. Considering the strong focus toward increasing densities within the 30 Year Plan for Greater Adelaide, this project provides some insight into how changes to development influence subjective perceptions of Residential Satisfaction. In particular, this project demonstrates that while higher <b>dwelling</b> <b>densities</b> are not generally associated with the dream home that the people of Adelaide seek to achieve towards the end of their housing career; the improved accessibility associated with higher density establishes some positive outcomes in relation to neighbourhood satisfaction, despite greater awareness of the sources of dis-satisfaction.

40|$|The overall {{objective}} of this thesis is to compare and contrast alternative measures of wellbeing in New Zealand during the 19 th -early 20 th centuries from a spatial perspective by collecting, collating and analyzing new economic, social and anthropometric data. Provincial data was collected from the Statistics New Zealand Annual Reports and New Zealand Census. Anthropometric data {{was derived from the}} personnel records of New Zealanders serving in WWI, which only became available to the public in 2005. Time-series tests for convergence and causality have been applied to analyze New Zealand’s economic history, where appropriate. The last quarter of the 19 th century in New Zealand was a period of rapid change both in terms of economic and demographic indicators. Prior to the universal convergence of the existing monetary-based measures of wellbeing across Provinces, there were some apparent disparities in the commodity price and real wage series, as well as urban-rural differences in occupation-specific real wages and infant mortality trends. There was also no single pattern of stature decline across provinces during 1871 - 1898, or between urban and rural areas, where disparities were particularly apparent. The traditional view of the healthy and wealthy New Zealand could only be established at an aggregate level, during a certain time period and for a certain ethnic group (New Zealand European only). Using Provincial data for the period 1874 - 1919 I have been able to show that improvements in real wages and a decrease in education inequality (between females and males) corresponded to lower infant deaths and thus better health outcomes, while increased <b>dwelling</b> <b>density</b> created unfavorable conditions for infants’ chances of survival. Anthropometric data was used in conjunction with socio-economic provincial data to establish the relationship between stature, urbanization, real wages and infant mortality. The results showed that <b>dwelling</b> <b>density</b> (overcrowding) and general economic conditions were both important in determining stature outcomes during 1870 - 1900, while the effect of infant mortality on stature was negligible. Most importantly, it has been demonstrated that in New Zealand stature represents a much more robust measure of living standards than real wages or health indicators on their own, at least during the 1870 - 1900 period...|$|R
40|$|A lack of {{understanding}} of the dynamics of housing mobility and its difference across the major cities in Australia can have significant policy ramifications. In particular, a spatial mismatch in the demand and supply of higher density housing will arise if planning for resource allocations continues to be based on urban density targets without a complete understanding of the dynamics of housing mobility patterns. Therefore through the application of a unique 3 -fold longitudinal study this paper examines the housing mobility patterns over time by measuring changes in housing characteristics of housing tenure, dwelling type and location using the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA). It was found that the most typical transition to a higher <b>dwelling</b> <b>density</b> in Australia is from a detached house to multi-storeyed units under 3 storeys. Downsizing moves for retirees are most frequent and a decrease in household income is closely related to downsizing. Also notable is the significantly higher level of downsizing moves found in Melbourne when compared to other cities over the past decade...|$|R
