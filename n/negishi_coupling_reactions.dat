40|$|One of {{the most}} {{attractive}} reactions {{in the field of}} asymmetric synthesis is the aldehydeallylation by using allylic boronates as reagents. Due to their efficiency, non-toxicity as well astheir high predictability concerning the stereochemical outcome, they have been the focus ofthe research of many groups, including Hoffmann et al.,[2, 3] Roush et al.,[4] Corey et al.,[5] andBrown et al. [6] The reaction was explained to proceed via a closed six-membered chair-liketransition state,[7 - 9] resulting in chiral homoallylic alcohols, which are valuable building blocksfor the synthesis of many natural products. Moreover, {{it has been shown that}} reagents presentinga stereogenic centre at the α-position with respect to the boronic ester provide increasedchirality transfer. The resulting absolute configuration has been demonstrated to be dependenton two principle factors: the steric bulk of the boronic esters protecting group and the presenceof a substituent exercising an electronic effect in the molecule. [10] In the past years Pietruszkaet al. have developed a tartrate derived chiral auxiliary[11] diol 1, which was used as a protectivegroup for boronic acids, and allowed the formation of stable α-substituted alkenylboronic esters. Their addition to aldehydes led to the formation of enantiomerically pure Z-homoallylicalcohols, as the reagents possessed an important factor improving the Z selectivity: a stericallydemanding diol covering the boronic acid. [12]Differently substituted diastereomerically pure allylboronic esters were synthesized in thiswork, and their addition to aldehydes was investigated in detail. The resulting enantio-enrichedhomoallylic alcohols were then applied in the attempt towards the synthesis of a natural product. Highly substituted allylboronic esters 2 and 4 were synthesized by two different methods(Scheme 1). Starting from the protected alkyne 3 c, a one-pot hydroboration, oxidation, andtransesterification sequence, followed by deprotection of the silyl group furnished 2 in a goodyield.

A close look to how the catalysis work reveals that palladium aggregates form on the polymer surface after the first catalytic reaction.

The recovered polymer can be reused several times although increased induction and reaction times are observed in consecutive uses from one run to the next.

40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of ChemistryStefan H. BossmannThe {{photochromic}} spirodihydroindolizine/betaine (DHI/B) {{system has}} been reinvestigated applying picosecond, microsecond, stationary absorption measurements, and NMR-kinetics. The first surprise was that the electronic structure of the betaines is quite different than commonly assumed. The photochemical ring-opening of DHIs to betaines is a conrotatory 1, 5 electrocyclic reaction, as picosecond absorption spectroscopy confirms. The (disrotatory) thermal ring-closing occurs from the cisoid betaine. The lifetime of the transoid betaine is 60 s at 300 K, whereas the lifetime of the cisoid isomer is {{of the order of}} 250 microseconds. According to these results, the electrocyclic back reaction of the betaines to the DHI is NOT rate determining, as previously thought, but the cisoid-transoid-isomerization of the betaine. Although the presence of a second nitrogen atom increases the photostability of the spirodihydroindolizine-pyridazine/betaine-system remarkably, the photochemical reaction mechanism appears to be exactly the same for spirodihydroindolizine-pyridazine/betaine-system. A nondestructive photoswitch or an information recording systems has been explored using styryl-quinolyldihydroindolizines. Both isomers DHI and betaine are fluorescent. When the blue betaine is stabilized in a thin polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) matrix, it is stable for several hours even in room temperature and very stable at 77 K. Although irradiation of visible light = 532 nm allows the photo-induced reaction of the Betaine back to the DHI, a nondestructive read-out can be performed at λ = 645 nm upon excitation with λ = 580 nm. Image recording (write) and read-out, as well as information storage (at 77 K) have been demonstrated. Charged and maleimide-functionalized DHI/B systems have beed synthesized for use as photochemical gates of the mycobacterial channel porin MspA. Positively charged and maleimide functionalized DHI groups that were attached to the DHI/B-system permit the binding of the photoswitch to selective positions in the channel proteins due to the presence of a cysteine moiety.
