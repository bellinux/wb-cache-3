5|$|Ezra Pound {{is really}} at heart a very boyish fellow and an incurable provincial. It {{is true that}} he was driven to Europe by a thirst for romance and color that he could {{scarcely}} have satisfied in America, but he took to Europe the simple faith and pure enthusiasm of his native Idaho.... His sophistication is still juvenile, his ironies are still clumsy and obvious, he ridicules Americans in Europe <b>not</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> simpler than himself...|$|E
5|$|Although <b>not</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> {{is known}} about Allen's childhood, the town of Cornwall was {{frontier}} territory in the 1740s. By the time Allen reached his teens, the area, while still a difficult area in which to make a living, began to resemble a town, with wood-frame houses beginning to replace the rough cabins of the early settlers. Joseph Allen died in 1755; {{at the time of}} his death he was one of the wealthier landowners in the area, ran a successful farm, and had previously served as town selectman. Allen had, before his father's death, begun studies under a minister in the nearby town of Salisbury with the goal of gaining admission to Yale College. Allen's brother Ira recalled that, even at a young age, Allen was curious and interested in learning.|$|E

25|$|A slight {{problem with}} {{electrotyping}} of type {{is that the}} new form is slightly smaller than the original - according to Justin Howes, the calculation of the Stephenson Blake type foundry was that the shrinkage was on average 0.0038%. While obviously <b>not</b> <b>very</b> <b>much,</b> this deviance could accumulate if a letterform was repeatedly regenerated. Stephenson Blake's solution was to squash type slightly in a press or file it down to broaden it before putting it into the electrotype bath.|$|E
25|$|Ixerba {{has been}} {{assigned}} to different families over time. Traditionally it was regarded related to Roussea and Brexia and has been combined {{with them in the}} Brexiaceae. These three have been placed in different other famililies, such as the Escalloniaceae, but doubt remained about their proper placement. After genetic analysis showed that Ixerba was <b>not</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> related to either Roussea or Brexia, it was placed in the monogeneric family Ixerbaceae. However, further testing revealed that Ixerba was closely related to the New Caledonian genus Strasburgeria and it was assigned to the Strasburgeriaceae by the APG III in 2009.|$|E
25|$|The {{apparent}} lack {{of airborne}} transmission among humans {{is believed to be}} due to low levels of the virus in the lungs {{and other parts of the}} respiratory system of primates, insufficient to cause new infections. A number of studies examining airborne transmission broadly concluded that transmission from pigs to primates could happen without direct contact because, unlike humans and primates, pigs with EVD get very high ebolavirus concentrations in their lungs, and not their bloodstream. Therefore, pigs with EVD can spread the disease through droplets in the air or on the ground when they sneeze or cough. By contrast, humans and other primates accumulate the virus throughout their body and specifically in their blood, but <b>not</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> in their lungs. It is believed that this is the reason researchers have observed pig to primate transmission without physical contact, but no evidence has been found of primates being infected without actual contact, even in experiments where infected and uninfected primates shared the same air.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the first}} activists in the library {{community}} working toward accessibility for the Deaf was Alice Hagemeyer. When disabled communities began demanding equality in the 1970s, Hagemeyer {{decided to go back}} to school for her master's degree in library science. While she was studying there, she realized that there was <b>not</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> information about the Deaf community at her library or at the libraries of any of her classmates. She soon became an activist for Deaf awareness at her library, and she became the first “Librarian for the Deaf Community” from any public library in the nation. Hagemeyer also constructed a manual of resources for Deaf people and those associated with them called The Red Notebook. This notebook is now an online resource, which is available at the website of the Friends of Libraries for Deaf Action. Hagemeyer was one {{of the first}} library activists to make strides for the Deaf community.|$|E

John Rosselli concluded after writing his biography that [...] "I do <b>not</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> {{like the man}} Verdi, in particular the autocratic -cum-estate owner, part-time composer, and seemingly full-time grumbler and reactionary critic of the later years", yet admits that like other writers, he must [...] "admire him, warts and all...a deep integrity runs beneath his life, and can be felt even when he is being unreasonable or wrong." ...|$|E

[...] The Good Web Guide also {{recommends}} the series, saying that [...] "whether he is bringing you up to date with his recent adventures of just riffing on something that interests him, he is always compelling company." [...] The guide also states, [...] "Stephen Fry is one of those very rare people who are incapable of being boring." ...|$|E

500|$|Anne {{experienced}} {{problems in}} her married life. She was <b>not</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> liked at court and James philandered with younger mistresses such as Arabella Churchill, {{with whom he}} fathered many illegitimate children, including two born during Anne's lifetime; thus he was called [...] "the most unguarded ogler of his time." [...] Anne was not oblivious to this: Pepys wrote that she was jealous and chided James, but he also wrote that Anne and James were notorious for showing their affections publicly, kissing and leaning on each other. Pepys also wrote that when James {{fell in love with}} Lady Chesterfield, Anne complained to King Charles so insistently that Lady Chesterfield had to retreat to the countryside, where she remained until she died.|$|E
500|$|Julian Lennon {{discovered}} that [...] "Hey Jude" [...] {{had been written}} for him almost 20 years after McCartney composed the song. He recalled of his and McCartney's relationship: [...] "Paul and I used to hang about quite a bit – more than Dad and I did. We had a great friendship going {{and there seems to}} be far more pictures of me and Paul playing together at that age than there are pictures of me and my dad." [...] In 1996, Julian paid £25,000 for the recording notes to [...] "Hey Jude" [...] at an auction. He spent a further £35,000 at the auction, buying John Lennon memorabilia. John Cousins, Julian Lennon's manager, stated at the time: [...] "He has a few photographs of his father, but <b>not</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> else. He is collecting for personal reasons; these are family heirlooms if you like." ...|$|E
500|$|Peter Duval Smith, in the Financial Times, was in two {{minds about}} the book, believing {{on the one}} hand that [...] "the {{background}} is excellent... Mr. Fleming has caught the exact 'feel' of Japan", and on the other that You Only Live Twice [...] "is not really a success and it's Bond's fault mainly. He just doesn't add up to a human being". Maggie Ross, in The Listener was also a little dissatisfied, writing that the novel can be read as a thriller and, [...] "if interest flags, as it may do, the book can be treated as a tourist guide to some of the more interesting parts of Japan." [...] She {{went on to say that}} [...] "since <b>not</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> in the way of real excitement happens until the latter half of the book, perhaps it is better to ignore the whole thing".|$|E

500|$|Scribe B {{was a poor}} speller, and scribe A was <b>not</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> better; {{the best}} scribe was D. Metzger states: [...] "scribe A had made some unusually serious mistakes". Scribes A and B more often used nomina sacra in {{contracted}} forms (ΠΝΕΥΜΑ contracted in all occurrences, ΚΥΡΙΟΣ contracted except in 2 occurrences), scribe D more often used forms uncontracted. D distinguished between sacral and nonsacral using of ΚΥΡΙΟΣ. His errors are the substitution of ΕΙ for Ι, and Ι for ΕΙ in medial positions, both equally common. Otherwise substitution of Ι for initial ΕΙ is unknown, and final ΕΙ is only replaced in word ΙΣΧΥΕΙ, confusing of Ε and ΑΙ is very rare. In the Book of Psalms this scribe has 35 times ΔΑΥΕΙΔ instead of ΔΑΥΙΔ, while scribe A normally uses an abbreviated form ΔΑΔ. Scribe A's was a [...] "worse type of phonetic error". Confusion of Ε and ΑΙ occurs in all contexts. Milne and Skeat characterised scribe B as [...] "careless and illiterate". The work of the original scribe is designated by the siglum א*.|$|E
500|$|McCartney later said, [...] "We lived {{backstage}} in the Bambi Kino, {{next to the}} toilets, and {{you could}} always smell them. The room had been an old storeroom, and there were just concrete walls and nothing else. No heat, no wallpaper, not a lick of paint; and two sets of bunk beds, with <b>not</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> covers—Union Jack flags—we were frozen." [...] Lennon remembered: [...] "We were put in this pigsty. We {{were living in a}} toilet, like right next to the ladies' toilet. We'd go to bed late and be woken up next day by the sound of the cinema show and old German fraus [...] pissing next door." [...] After having been awoken in this fashion, the group were then obliged to use cold water from the urinals for washing and shaving. They were paid £2.50 each a day, seven days a week, playing from 8:30-9:30, 10 until 11, 11:30-12:30, and finishing the evening playing from one until two o'clock in the morning. German customers found the group's name comical, as [...] "Beatles" [...] sounded like [...] "Peedles", which meant a small boy's penis.|$|E
500|$|The Moving Picture World gave it minor {{praise and}} short {{summary of the}} film, {{but it does not}} {{evaluate}} or describe the special camera effects used to produce the film. The reviewer states: [...] "To see the doll and the pumpkin suddenly assume life is interesting and naturally causes the little girl to whom they belong surprise. The good times they have with the fairy's help will long remain in her memory, even though it is only a dream." [...] The New York Dramatic Mirror was critical of the production, stating [...] "This sounds as if it ought to be very clever, but aside from the work of the little heroine and the dance of the fairies it is entirely uninspired. It needs a drastic application of imagination. The broad idea is excellent, but the details of the management indicate impoverished resources. When the aid of fairies is invoked it opens up all sorts of avenues of fanciful treatment, but this film doesn't get away from stolid realities. For example, nobody could imagine anything more earthly than the outside of the house from which the little girl escaped with the fairy queen and her comrades. That should have been treated fancifully. The events pictured don't amount to anything; there is a sameness about them, nothing surprising happens, and <b>not</b> <b>very</b> <b>much</b> that is pretty. Worst of all is the poetry(?), which is interpolated to explain the narrative; that is beyond criticism. The Thanhouser Company has missed good opportunities in this film." [...] The strange inclusion of the question mark after poetry is not a note by Bowers, for it was actually written into the review itself in the edition. Though no other review mentions poetry.|$|E
