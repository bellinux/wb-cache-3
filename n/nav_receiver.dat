50|$|Detailed {{examination}} of the NAV, and a letter on 24 August 1984 which related to the NAV switching failure mode, was passed to the investigators by McDonnel Douglas. The examination showed that the NAV mode, during its operation in-flight, {{can lead to a}} completely false LOC or GS indication ('ON' indication). A tiny red flag should have appeared on the indicator when the error occurred, but it didn't appear. This error occurred when the <b>NAV</b> <b>receiver</b> doesn't deliver an output signal. The letter was sent to every operators of DC-8, DC-9, C-9 and MD-80, which was equipped with the faulty <b>NAV</b> <b>receiver.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Alitalia, the {{operator}} {{of the accident}} aircraft, finally added the <b>NAV</b> <b>receiver</b> failure problem to their training and also added the actions that the crew should take in case it happened. Before the accident, the failure was not added to their training.|$|E
50|$|Swiss {{investigative team}} finally {{concluded}} {{that the cause of}} the crash was due to the <b>NAV</b> <b>Receiver</b> failure of the aircraft. A short or an open circuit caused the crew to believe that they were on the right path and thus there were no warning indications given by the aircraft to warn the crew about the error and thus the aircraft slammed into terrain. Swiss authority also blamed the absence of lighting on Stadlerberg Mountain and the Drum Pointer Altimeter of the aircraft.|$|E
30|$|The senders A and B {{of the two}} {{flows in}} this {{category}} (and all subsequent categories) are not within the transmission range of each other. Therefore, the RTS frame transmitted by sender A is not successfully decoded by sender B and vice versa. However, the channel is sensed busy during RTS transmission, preventing the other sender from initiating a transmission. This is different from SIS category proposed by Garetto et al. [5] where senders {{are assumed to be}} outside the sensing range and cannot sense the RTS transmitted by sender of the alternate flow. The receivers of both flows are within the transmission range of the alternate senders, i.e., interference interactions Ab and aB are connected. This means that the receivers can successfully decode the RTS frame transmitted by the alternate senders resulting in setting <b>NAV</b> at alternate <b>receiver.</b> Similarly, senders can successfully decode the CTS packet transmitted by the alternate receivers. Therefore, collision can only occur if one sender starts transmission of RTS during the idle interval between RTS and CTS transmission of the alternate flow.|$|R
50|$|Before using a VOR {{indicator}} for {{the first}} time, it can be tested and calibrated at an airport with a VOR test facility, or VOT. A VOT differs from a VOR in that it replaces the variable directional signal with another omnidirectional signal, in a sense transmitting a 360Â° radial in all directions. The <b>NAV</b> <b>receiver</b> is tuned to the VOT frequency, then the OBS is rotated until the needle is centred. If the indicator reads within four degrees of 000 with the FROM flag visible or 180 with the TO flag visible, it is considered usable for navigation. The FAA requires testing and calibration of a VOR indicator no more than 30 days before any flight under IFR.|$|E
