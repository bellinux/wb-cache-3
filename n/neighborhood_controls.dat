40|$|It {{is widely}} {{believed}} that the prevalence of smoking among hospital patients is {{greater than that of}} the general population because many conditions for which patients are hospitalized are caused by or associated with smoking, and that this increased prevalence may bias results of case-control studies of tobacco-related diseases. For this reason, many authors have suggested excluding from the control series patients hospitalized for tobacco-related illnesses. The present study investigated potential selection bias for hospital compared to <b>neighborhood</b> <b>controls</b> in studying tobacco-related diseases. The 709 cases from six U. S. cities had tobacco-related cancers or myocardial infarction. They were individually matched to one hospital control and to one neighbor. After excluding patients with tobacco-related diseases, hospital controls were less often current smokers and more often former smokers than <b>neighborhood</b> <b>controls.</b> Among male ever smokers, hospital controls tended to smoke more cigarettes per day than <b>neighborhood</b> <b>controls.</b> Compared with the U. S. population, there was an over-representation of smokers in <b>neighborhood</b> <b>controls</b> rather than an under-representation of smokers in hospital controls. Relative risk estimates varied according to type of control. Choosing between hospital and <b>neighborhood</b> <b>controls</b> in case-control studies should be dictated by criteria related to the study hypothesis, participation, or cost. In particular, exclusion of hospital controls with diseases known to be tobacco-related seems to be a successful strategy for reducing selection bias...|$|E
40|$|One {{third of}} the world's {{population}} {{is estimated to be}} latently infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (LTBI). Surveys of LTBI are rarely performed in resource poor TB high endemic countries like Tanzania although low-income countries harbor the largest burden of the worlds LTBI. The primary objective was to estimate the prevalence of LTBI in household contacts of pulmonary TB cases and a group of apparently healthy <b>neighborhood</b> <b>controls</b> in an urban setting of such a country. Secondly we assessed potential impact of LTBI on inflammation by quantitating circulating levels of an acute phase reactant: alpha- 1 -acid glycoprotein (AGP) in <b>neighborhood</b> <b>controls.</b> The study was nested within the framework of two nutrition studies among TB patients in Mwanza, Tanzania. Household contacts- and <b>neighborhood</b> <b>controls</b> were invited to participate. The study involved a questionnaire, BMI determination and blood samples to measure AGP, HIV testing and a Quantiferon Gold In tube (QFN-IT) test to detect signs of LTBI. 245 household contacts and 192 <b>neighborhood</b> <b>controls</b> had available QFN-IT data. Among household contacts, the proportion of QFT-IT positive was 59 % compared to 41 % in the <b>neighborhood</b> <b>controls</b> (p =  0. 001). In a linear regression model adjusted for sex, age, CD 4 and HIV, a QFT-IT positive test was associated with a 10 % higher level of alpha- 1 -acid glycoprotein(AGP) (10 (B) 1. 10, 95 % CI 1. 01; 1. 20, p =  0. 03), compared to individuals with a QFT-IT negative test. LTBI is highly prevalent among apparently healthy urban Tanzanians even without known exposure to TB in the household. LTBI was found to be associated with elevated levels of AGP. The implications of this observation merit further studies...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Control {{selection}} {{is a major}} challenge in epidemiologic case-control studies. The aim of our study was to evaluate using hospital versus neighborhood control groups in studying risk factors of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We compared the results of two different case-control studies of ESCC conducted in the same region by a single research group. Case definition and enrollment were {{the same in the}} two studies, but control selection differed. In the first study, we selected two age- and sex-matched controls from inpatient subjects in hospitals, while for the second we selected two age- and sex-matched controls from each subject's neighborhood of residence. We used the test of heterogeneity to compare the results of the two studies. We found no significant differences in exposure data for tobacco-related variables such as cigarette smoking, chewing Nass (a tobacco product) and hookah (water pipe) usage, but the frequency of opium usage was significantly different between hospital and <b>neighborhood</b> <b>controls.</b> Consequently, the inference drawn for the association between ESCC and tobacco use did not differ between the studies, but it did for opium use. In the study using <b>neighborhood</b> <b>controls,</b> opium use was associated with a significantly increased risk of ESCC (adjusted OR 1. 77, 95 % CI 1. 17 - 2. 68), while in the study using hospital controls, {{this was not the case}} (OR 1. 09, 95 % CI 0. 63 - 1. 87). Comparing the prevalence of opium consumption in the two control groups and a cohort enrolled from the same geographic area suggested that the <b>neighborhood</b> <b>controls</b> were more representative of the study base population for this exposure. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Hospital and <b>neighborhood</b> <b>controls</b> did not lead us to the same conclusion for a major hypothesized risk factor for ESCC in this population.

Objective: To examine association of 1430 candidate gene single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with heroin dependence, reporting here only the 71 SNPs in the chromosome 11 gene cluster (NCAM 1, TTC 12, ANKK 1, DRD 2) that include the strongest observed associations. Design: Case-control genetic association study that included 2 control groups (lacking an established optimal control group). Setting: Semistructured psychiatric interviews. Participants: A total of 1459 Australian cases ascertained from opioid replacement therapy clinics, 531 <b>neighborhood</b> <b>controls</b> ascertained from economically disadvantaged areas near opioid replacement therapy clinics, and 1495 unrelated Australian Twin Registry controls not dependent on alcohol or illicit drugs selected from a twin and family sample. Main Outcome Measure: Lifetime heroin dependence. Results: Comparison of cases with Australian Twin Registry controls found minimal evidence of association for all chromosome 11 cluster SNPs (P≥. 01); a similar comparison with <b>neighborhood</b> <b>controls</b> revealed greater differences (P≥ 1. 8 × 10 - 4). Comparing cases (n= 1459) with the subgroup of <b>neighborhood</b> <b>controls</b> not dependent on illicit drugs (n= 340), 3 SNPs were significantly associated (correcting for multiple testing) : ANKK 1 SNP rs 877138 (most strongly associated; odds ratio= 1. 59; 95 % CI, 1. 32 - 1. 92; P= 9. 7 × 10 - 7), ANKK 1 SNP rs 4938013, and TTC 12 SNP rs 7130431. A similar pattern of association was observed when comparing illicit drug-dependent (n= 191) and nondependent (n= 340) <b>neighborhood</b> <b>controls,</b> suggesting that liability likely extends to nonopioid illicit drug dependence. Aggregate heroin dependence risk associated with 2 SNPs, rs 877138 and rs 4492854 (located in NCAM 1), varied more than 4 -fold (P= 2. 7 × 10 - 9 for the risk-associated linear trend). Conclusions: Our results provide further evidence of association for chromosome 11 gene cluster SNPs with substance dependence, including extension of liability to illicit drug dependence. Our findings highlight the necessity of considering drug exposure history when selecting control groups for genetic investigations of illicit drug dependence...|$|E

Here, we revisit the feasibility and comparability of using {{alternative sources of}} controls, specifically friend and family controls. MethodsWe recruited from a recently completed case-control study of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) among women in Los Angeles County where controls from the parent study were ascertained by neighborhood walk. We calculated participation rates and compared questionnaire responses between the friend/family controls and the original matched controls from the parent study. ResultsOf the 182 NHL case patients contacted, 111 (61 %) {{agreed to participate in}} our feasibility study. 70 (63 %) provided contact information for potential friend and/or family member controls. We were able to successfully contact and recruit a friend/family member for 92 % of the case patients. This represented 46 friend controls and 54 family controls.

DESIGN: A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial. SETTING: Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre, The Netherlands. PARTICIPANTS: Fifty-seven adult patients who fulfilled the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria for CFS. IGF status of 22 CFS patients was compared to that of 22 healthy age- and gender-matched neighborhood control individuals. INTERVENTION: Acclydine or placebo for 14 wk.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the complexity of}} the emptiness problem for various classes of graph languages defined by eNCE (edge label <b>neighborhood</b> <b>controlled</b> embedding) graph grammars. In particular, we show that the emptiness problem is undecidable for general eNCE graph grammars, DEXPTIME-complete for confluent and boundary eNCE graph grammars, PSPACE-complete for linear eNCE graph grammars, NLcomplete for deterministic confluent, deterministic boundary, and deterministic linear eNCE graph grammars. The exponential time algorithm for deciding emptiness of confluent eNCE graph grammars is based on an exponential time transformation of a confluent eNCE graph grammar into a nonblocking confluent eNCE graph grammar generating the same language. 1 Introduction The theory of graph grammars constitutes a well-motivated and well-developed area within theoretical computer science. The area of graph grammars has grown quite impressively in recent years. This growth was motivated by applications in [...] ...|$|R
