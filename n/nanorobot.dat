Assistant Director Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) tells Mulder that he and Scully have been denied reassignment to the division. Mulder goes to his former basement office, {{only to discover that}} Jeffrey Spender (Chris Owens) and Diana Fowley (Mimi Rogers) have been assigned to the X-Files. Going against orders, Mulder and Scully track down an escaped alien in Phoenix, Arizona while Cigarette Smoking Man (William B. Davis) gives chase. Mulder and Scully eventually discover that Cigarette Smoking Man has been using Gibson Praise to locate the creature. Scully brings Gibson to the hospital, where it is determined that he has the alien virus in his blood. Later, Skinner is mysteriously poisoned by a <b>nanorobot</b> infection. The culprit is revealed to be Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea), a rogue FBI agent who formerly worked for the Syndicate, who continues to control the potentially debilitating nanotechnology in Skinner's system in order to achieve his goals.|$|E

After finding her, she informs Mulder and Scully that the aliens are here to destroy all life on Earth and that she is a successful alien-human hybrid. The Smoking Man (William B. Davis) reveals everything to Diana Fowley, who agrees to help him and betray Mulder. Fowley forcibly takes Mulder, Cassandra, and Scully to a Centers for Disease Control facility at Fort Marlene. Meanwhile, the Syndicate rendezvous at a check point, preparing to be taken away by the Colonists, who are prepping for invasion. However, they are met by the alien rebels, who incinerate them all, including Cassandraâ€”save The Smoking Man and Fowley, who escape. Jeffrey Spender is then purportedly killed by The Smoking Man.|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} applications of MNT would be medical nanorobotics or nanomedicine, an area pioneered by Robert Freitas in numerous books and papers. [...] The ability to design, build, and deploy large numbers of medical <b>nanorobots</b> would, at a minimum, make possible the rapid elimination of disease and the reliable and relatively painless recovery from physical trauma.

500|$|Smalley then {{considered}} how realistic was {{the concept}} of a self-replicating <b>nanorobot.</b> He noted that in a chemical reaction, the chemical bonds are all interconnected and that the placement of each atom is sensitive to the position of all the other atoms in the vicinity. He then asserted that a molecular assembler would thus have to control many atoms simultaneously in order to work, and would thus have to have many manipulator arms. This led him to raise two objections to {{the concept of}} molecular assembler, which he calls the [...] "fat fingers problem" [...] and the [...] "sticky fingers problem": ...|$|E
500|$|He then {{agreed that}} {{something}} like an enzyme or ribosome {{would be capable of}} precise chemistry, but asked how the <b>nanorobot</b> would be able to obtain, control, and repair such an enzyme, and noted the incompatibility of many reactions with water-based biological systems, stating that [...] "biology is wonderous in the vast diversity of what it can build, but it can't make a crystal of silicon, or steel, or copper, or aluminum, or titanium, or virtually any of the key materials on which modern technology is built." [...] Smalley asked what kind of [...] "nonaqueous enzymelike chemistry" [...] Drexler would envision for his molecular assemblers to operate upon, calling this [...] "a vast area of chemistry that has eluded us for centuries." ...|$|E
500|$|He {{referenced}} {{the idea}} of a molecular assembler, a <b>nanorobot</b> capable of manipulating individual atoms to build a desired product, posing the question of {{how long it would take}} such an assembler to produce a meaningful amount of material. He estimated that one assembler working alone would take millions of years to produce one mole of material, but self-replicating assemblers could within a minute produce a large enough ensemble of assemblers that would then be capable of producing a mole of product in a fraction of a millisecond. Smalley then discussed the fear that the nanorobots could mutate and reproduce indefinitely, causing a grey goo scenario, or, referring to Bill Joy's previous article [...] "Why the future doesn't need us", that the nanorobots could develop swarm intelligence and become alive in some sense.|$|E

2500|$|MNT nanofacturing is popularly {{linked with}} the idea of swarms of coordinated {{nanoscale}} robots working together, a popularization of an early proposal by K. Eric Drexler in his 1986 discussions of MNT, but [...] In this early proposal, sufficiently capable <b>nanorobots</b> would construct more <b>nanorobots</b> in an artificial environment containing special molecular building blocks.|$|R
2500|$|Critics have doubted {{both the}} {{feasibility}} of self-replicating nanorobots and {{the feasibility of}} control if self-replicating nanorobots could be achieved: they cite the possibility of mutations removing any control and favoring reproduction of mutant pathogenic variations. [...] Advocates address the first doubt {{by pointing out that}} the first macroscale autonomous machine replicator, made of Lego blocks, was built and operated experimentally in 2002. [...] While there are sensory advantages present at the macroscale compared to the limited sensorium available at the nanoscale, proposals for positionally controlled nanoscale mechanosynthetic fabrication systems employ dead reckoning of tooltips combined with reliable reaction sequence design to ensure reliable results, hence a limited sensorium is no handicap; [...] similar considerations apply to the positional assembly of small nanoparts. [...] Advocates address the second doubt by arguing that bacteria are (of necessity) evolved to evolve, while <b>nanorobot</b> mutation could be actively prevented by common error-correcting techniques. Similar ideas are advocated in the Foresight Guidelines on Molecular Nanotechnology, and a map of the 137-dimensional replicator design space recently published by Freitas and Merkle provides numerous proposed methods by which replicators could, in principle, be safely controlled by good design.|$|E
50|$|A method pioneered in Seoul, South Korea uses a {{two-step process}} of 3D {{printing}}, using a 3D printing and laser etched plates. To {{be more precise}} at a nanoscale, the 3D printing process uses a laser etching machine, which etches into each plate the details needed for the segment of <b>nanorobot.</b> The plate is then transferred to the 3D printer, which fills the etched regions with the desired nanoparticle. The 3D printing process is repeated until the <b>nanorobot</b> is built from the bottom up. This 3D printing process has many benefits.

40|$|In {{recent years}} and after {{molecular}} manufacturing {{in the sense of}} nanoscale building blocks, nanotechnology faced a more complex challenge in building bionanoelectronics and molecular machine. Indeed, one important challenge that has become evident in nanotechnology industrial applications is the automation of atomic-scale manipulation. The starting point of nanotechnology to achieve the main goal of building systems at nanoscale is the development of control automation for molecular machine systems. Nanorobotics encompass the design, fabrication and programming of robots with overall dimensions below a few micrometers, and programmable assembly of nanoscale objects. Thus, nanorobotics is concerned with: 1. 	Design and fabrication of <b>nanorobots</b> with overall dimensions at or below the micrometer range and made of nanoscopic components. 2. 	Programming and coordination of large numbers of such <b>nanorobots</b> (swarms). 3. 	Programmable assembly of nanometer scale components either by manipulation with macro or micro devices, or by self-assembly on programmed templates or scaffolds. Therefore, <b>nanorobots</b> require some type of guidance and control to perform their tasks. <b>Nanorobots</b> could either be remotely controlled by a computer or autonomous. It is noted that autonomous robots would require a nanocomputer. This paper describes some different methods proposed recently how to control <b>nanorobots</b> and how to provide speed and energy for motion and activity...|$|R
