5|$|Flower was {{intended}} as a spiritual successor to Flow. Using the PlayStation 3's motion sensitive controller, the player controls wind that blows a flower petal through the air. Flying close to flowers results in the player's petal being followed by other flower petals. Approaching flowers may also have side-effects on the game world, such as bringing vibrant color to previously dead fields or activating stationary windmills. The game features <b>no</b> <b>text</b> or dialogue, forming a narrative arc primarily through visual representation and emotional cues. It was released for the PlayStation 3 on February 12, 2009.|$|E
5|$|Early {{pressings}} of {{the sleeve}} {{were presented in}} a six-panel gatefold cover, with one side displaying the landscape in the daytime, whilst the other shows the same image at night, playing {{with the idea that}} during the day, the countryside is glorious and the city is dull and grey, whereas at nighttime the countryside is dark and the city is illuminated and alive. To prioritize the design, <b>no</b> <b>text</b> was included on the sleeve apart from a promotional sticker shaped like a red balloon featuring the band's name and album title. Later copies of the album came in a standard plastic case with a protective cardboard sleeve.|$|E

5|$|From 1840 to 1844, the Penny Black, {{and other}} stamps issued, were obliterated with the Maltese Cross cancellation. There was <b>no</b> <b>text</b> or numeral to help {{identify}} any of these cancels as Irish, but some Maltese Crosses are uniquely identifiable with certain Irish towns, including Belfast, Eyrecourt, Cork, Hollymount, Limerick and Mullingar. From 1844 on, the cancels used included text or numerals that identified the post town. Cancels of both types are easier to identify if the stamp is still affixed to a cover, since this makes the complete postmark visible, but a stamp no longer affixed to a cover may still permit identification {{of the town of}} use if enough of the postmark can be seen on the stamp itself. Numerals of Irish town cancels were uniquely set in a 4 pointed diamond shape whereas town cancels in England and Wales used an oval shape and Scotland used a rectangular form.|$|E

25|$|The {{earliest}} telling {{would appear}} to be when the story was set out by Eadburg, the third abbess at Thanet. There is <b>no</b> <b>text</b> dating to that time, but Hollis and Rollason both contend that the Caligula A text has a strong claim to representing the 'Thanet' version of the story. Written in Old English, with considerable uncertainty about its author and date, it recounts the foundation of the Abbey in ways that may be much closer to a mid-8th century account than the other surviving texts. The themes, on that basis, are to chronicle a history of the Abbey, to set out its legal claim to the land, to talk up the Mercian links of the founder (Domne Eafe) and the saint (Mildrith), at a time when Kent was under Mercian rule, and to provide a 'Life of Mildrith' to accompany the translation of her remains from St Mary's Church to Eadburg's new church of St Peter and St Paul, Thanet.|$|E
25|$|COCONET, a BBS system made by Coconut Computing, Inc., was {{released}} in 1988 and only supported a GUI (<b>no</b> <b>text</b> interface was initially available but eventually became available around 1990), and worked in EGA/VGA graphics mode, which made it {{stand out from the}} text-based BBS systems. COCONET's bitmap and vector graphics and support for multiple type fonts were inspired by the PLATO system, and the graphics capabilities were based on what was available in the Borland BGI graphics library. A competing approach called Remote Imaging Protocol (RIP) emerged and was promoted by Telegrafix in the early to mid-1990s but it never became widespread. An industry standard technology called NAPLPS was also considered, and although it became the underlying graphics technology behind the Prodigy service, it never gained popularity in the BBS market. There were several GUI-based BBSes on the Apple Macintosh platform, including TeleFinder and FirstClass, but these remained widely used only in the Mac market.|$|E

25|$|Brøns Church, {{located in}} Southern Jutland, south of Ribe, {{contains}} two Lutheran frescos, dating from c. 1530, which are probably Denmark's only examples of church frescos with distinctly Lutheran messages. One shows a heavenly castle under siege. An army led by pope and bishops try {{to gain access}} to it by force, while Christ — guarding its city gate — rejects them. Another image shows the pope and a number of bishops presenting a large papal bull, carrying a total of 11 ecclesiastic seals but <b>no</b> <b>text.</b> It is unknown whether this has always been the case, but the presence of two fools, one of them holding a pair of reading glasses, indicates that this is the intention; the Catholic Church is presented as without content. Below, a monk, standing a front of a group of men holding letters of indulgence is confronted by another group of people holding similar letters. This protest scene against the sale of indulgences is inspired by a contemporary woodcarving by Nuremberg artist, Hans Sebald Beham, who was staunchly anti-Catholic.|$|E
25|$|The {{production}} of badges and emblems changed in 1956 to the rolled edge now in current use, thus eliminating the various colored backgrounds. The outside oval was then changed to red. With {{the introduction of}} the Improved Scouting Program in 1972 came an overhaul of many badges and emblems. The new stylized Eagle Scout badge with <b>no</b> <b>text</b> was a major change that proved to be unpopular. It appears that some Scouters commissioned reproductions of the 1956 badge for issue in place of the 1972 version. In 1975 the badge design partially reverted to the 1956 version. 1985 saw a reversion to the 1956 issue with some minor differences. The border and the eagle were done in silver metalized thread and the Be Prepared text was in blue. In 1986 the metalized eagle changed back to standard thread due to problems with wearing and the scroll and text were enlarged. The metalized border was changed to standard thread in 1989. Later variants increased the thread count of the white stripe to eliminate the visible background.|$|E
25|$|The two gods are {{mentioned}} {{together in a}} dedicatory inscription found {{in the ruins of}} the temple of Hercules at Lanuvium, whose cult was ancient and second in importance only to that of Juno Sospita. In the cults of this temple just like in those at the Ara maxima in Rome women were not allowed. The exclusion of one sex is a characteristic practice in the cults of deities of fertility. Even though <b>no</b> <b>text</b> links the cults of the Ara maxima with Juno Sospita, her temple, founded in 193 BC, was located in the Forum Holitorium near the Porta Carmentalis, one of the sites of the legend of Hercules in Rome. The feria of the goddess coincides with a Natalis Herculis, birthday of Hercules, which was celebrated with ludi circenses, games in the circus. In Bayet's view Juno and Hercules did supersede Pilumnus and Picumnus in the role of tutelary deities of the newborn not only because of their own features of goddess of the deliverers and of apotropaic tutelary god of infants but also because of their common quality of gods of fertility. This was the case in Rome and at Tusculum where a cult of Juno Lucina and Hercules was known. At Lanuvium and perhaps Rome though their most ancient association rests on their common fertility and military characters. The Latin Junos certainly possessed a marked warlike character (at Lanuvium, Falerii, Tibur, Rome). Such character might suggest a comparison with the Greek armed Heras one finds in the South of Italy at Cape Lacinion and at the mouth of river Sele, military goddesses close to the Heras of Elis and Argos known as Argivae. In the cult this Hera received at Cape Lacinion she was associated with Heracles, supposed the founder of the sanctuary. Contacts with Central Italy and similarity would have favoured a certain assimilation between Latin warlike Junos and Argive Heras and the association with Heracles of Latin Junos. Some scholars, mostly Italians, recognize in the Junos of Falerii, Tibur and Lavinium the Greek Hera, rejecting the theory of an indigenous original cult of a military Juno. Renard thinks Dumézil's opposition to such a view is to be upheld: Bayet's words though did not deny the existence of local warlike Junos, but only imply that at a certain time they received the influence of the Heras of Lacinion and Sele, fact that earned them the epithet of Argive and a Greek connotation. However Bayet recognized the quality of mother and of fertility deity as being primitive among the three purported by the epithets of the Juno of Lanuvium (Seispes, Mater, Regina).|$|E

500|$|The {{original}} album cover, {{designed by}} art collective Hipgnosis, shows a Holstein-Friesian cow {{standing in a}} pasture with <b>no</b> <b>text</b> nor any other {{clue as to what}} might be on the record. Some later editions have the title and artist name added to the cover. This concept was the group's reaction to the psychedelic space rock imagery associated with Pink Floyd {{at the time of the}} album's release; the band wanted to explore all sorts of music without being limited to a particular image or style of performance. They thus requested that their new album had [...] "something plain" [...] on the cover, which ended up being the image of a cow. Storm Thorgerson, inspired by Andy Warhol's famous [...] "cow wallpaper", has said that he simply drove out into a rural area near Potters Bar and photographed the first cow he saw. The cow's owner identified her name as [...] "Lulubelle III". More cows appear on the back cover, again with <b>no</b> <b>text</b> or titles, and on the inside gatefold. Also, a pink balloon shaped like a cow udder accompanied the album as part of Capitol's marketing strategy campaign to [...] "break" [...] the band in the US. The liner notes in later CD editions give a recipe for Traditional Bedouin Wedding Feast on a card labelled [...] "Breakfast Tips". Looking back on the artwork, Thorgerson remembered: [...] "I think the cow represents, in terms of the Pink Floyd, part of their humour, which I think is often underestimated or just unwritten about." ...|$|E
