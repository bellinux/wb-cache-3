25|$|Efforts {{to reduce}} {{counterfeiting}} {{in recent years}} have sharply reduced the number of counterfeit <b>notes</b> <b>in</b> <b>circulation.</b> The number of counterfeit notes passed annually in Canada peaked in 2004, when 553,000 counterfeit notes were passed. Counterfeiting has decreased annually since that peak, with only 53,536 notes passed in 2010. The new Frontier Series of banknotes significantly improves security primarily by using a polymer substrate to make up the note instead of the previously used fabric. Even as Canada’s counterfeiting problem escalated, the shift to polymer was viewed as too expensive. A polymer note costs 19 cents to produce, compared to 9 cents for a typical cotton-paper note.|$|E

25|$|Prior to the U.S. {{invasion}} of Afghanistan, warlords, political parties, foreign powers and forgers each {{made their own}} Afghani banknotes, with no regard to standardization or honouring serial numbers. In December 1996, shortly after the Taliban took control of Afghanistan's institutions, Ehsanullah Ehsan, {{the chairman of the}} Taliban's Central Bank, declared most Afghani <b>notes</b> <b>in</b> <b>circulation</b> to be worthless (approximately 100 trillion Afghani) and cancelled the contract with the Russian firm that had been printing the currency since 1992. Ehsan accused the firm of sending new shipments of Afghani notes to ousted president Burhanuddin Rabbani in northern Takhar province. The exchange rate at the time of Ehsan's announcement was 21,000 Afghani to the U.S. dollar The Northern Alliance then had banknotes produced in Russia which were sold on the markets of Kabul at half their value.|$|E
25|$|While the {{printing}} of RM500 and RM1,000 notes had ceased in 1996 {{in response to}} risks of money laundering and capital flight, the underestimated effects {{of the financial crisis}} prompted the central bank to completely discontinue the use of the notes in 1999 by demonitising remaining <b>notes</b> <b>in</b> <b>circulation,</b> thereby ceasing to be of legal tender and being only exchangeable directly at the central bank.At the time of this note's demonetization from circulation in 1999,the RM500 notes worth approx. US$130 and RM1,000 worth of US$260 (according to 1999 exchange rate : US$1 = RM3.80).Despite these measures, some 7.6% of RM500 notes and 0.6% of RM1,000 notes remain in circulation as of 30 January 2011.

25|$|The bank charter had various clauses to {{help prevent}} {{possible}} insolvency and reduce risks. Bank officers were not permitted to receive loans at a rate different from that offered to the public. The bank could not issue securities on its own stock, and any loan over $500 had {{to be approved by}} five-sevenths of banks board members. Any losses were to be paid by the individual shareholders up to an amount equal to their stock value. At it highest point, in 1851, the bank had $4 million of bank <b>notes</b> <b>in</b> <b>circulation</b> and $2 million in specie reserves. The bank was an early success. Many who had purchased the stock on credit found that the dividends paid out exceeded the interest they were charged, {{and by the time the}} bank's charter expired almost all of the public stock had been paid for with investors receiving as much a 650% return on investment when the bank closed.|$|E
