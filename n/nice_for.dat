In the 11 rounds he {{achieved}} four wins, four draws and two losses in the blindfold, and three wins, two losses, and six draws in the rapid. This resulted in a shared fifth place in the blindfold, shared third place in the rapid and a shared second place in the overall tournament.|$|E
5|$|In the episode, Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) {{campaigns for}} her staff's {{right to get}} flu shots from Dr. Leo Spaceman (Parnell), but Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) will not allow it due to a limited supply. Meanwhile, Jack tries to think of {{creative}} ways {{to spend time with}} his girlfriend, Elisa (Hayek), as she works seven days a week. At the same time, Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) and Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) try to do something <b>nice</b> <b>for</b> the crew.|$|E
5|$|Some contemporaries {{alleged that}} Bonaparte was put {{under house arrest}} at <b>Nice</b> <b>for</b> his {{association}} with the Robespierres following their fall in the Thermidorian Reaction in July 1794, but Napoleon's secretary Bourrienne disputed the allegation in his memoirs. According to Bourrienne, jealousy was responsible, between the Army of the Alps and the Army of Italy (with whom Napoleon was seconded at the time). Bonaparte dispatched an impassioned defense {{in a letter to}} the commissar Saliceti, and he was subsequently acquitted of any wrongdoing.|$|E

5|$|Napoleon's divisional commanders were {{immediately}} {{impressed by his}} capacity for hard work, {{from the beginning of}} Italy campaign. Subordinates could never say they would attend to something and then let it slide, and the staff who had been stationary in <b>Nice</b> <b>for</b> four years suddenly felt pulsating effect of Napoleon's energy. In the nine month between arrival in Nice and the end of 1776 he sent more than eight hundred letters and despatches, covering everything from where drummer-boys should stand in parades to the conditions under which the 'Marseillaise' should be played. Augereu was first of his generals to be won over, followed Massena. 'That little bastard of a general actually frightened me!' Augereau would later tell Massena.|$|E

In 1920, he was jailed in <b>Nice</b> <b>for</b> stealing jewels from his American fiancée. After 1925, he was spotted in the Republic of China, a gunrunner for the National Revolutionary Army.|$|E

500|$|Alison Pollard choreographed and {{directed}} the UK adaptation {{and said that the}} episode already had a few songs in it, which helped with the conversion to a musical. She said [...] "The episode chosen for the show already had four or five really catchy tunes in it, and the idea that he wants to fly with jellyfish is <b>nice</b> <b>for</b> the stage as well." [...] The adaptation includes twelve songs of various styles.|$|E

500|$|Clapton, in a {{separate}} interview, was also asked about the meaning and representation of Cersei's crown, saying [...] "I chose {{to make it in}} silver with just wisps of gold to try to show her isolation, her mental disentangling from her family. There is no reference to Baratheon; there is no need anymore. She doesn't have to try and prove a link. The center of the crown is the lion sigil abstracted — its mane represents the Iron Throne, her desire. She has made it her own — she is reborn." [...] Clapton revealed as well that King Tommen Baratheon's costume was intended to show how heavily his responsibilities weigh on him, as he is weighted down with jeweled finery, with Clapton saying [...] "He was a nice boy. Too <b>nice</b> <b>for</b> this." ...|$|E
500|$|Actress Jasika Nicole {{was pleased}} that the writers decided to let her {{character}} discover Walter's secret, commenting [...] "Astrid finds out in a really emotional way because Walter lets it slip to her accidentally. I {{think that it was}} really <b>nice</b> <b>for</b> them to invite Astrid into the importance of that instead of keeping her in the dark. At least she knows that she's a part of this family and this affects her. I think she serves as a really important character in these later episodes because Astrid is kind of the only person that isn't directly involved with everything that is still on his side. She has {{to step up to the}} plate and be that comfort for him because if he doesn't have anyone there, he's basically going to regress and go back to the place, I think mentally, that he was in when he was in the mental institution. And of course we don't want that." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{route of}} the 2016 Paris–Nice was {{announced}} on 17 December 2015. The race began with a [...] prologue individual time trial in Conflans-Sainte-Honorine, near Paris, on Sunday 6 March and continued for the following seven days. The remaining stages were all road stages, with no other time trials. Stage 1 included two dirt tracks in the final part of the stage, with exposed roads made [...] a possibility. Stage 3 was scheduled to finish on Mont Brouilly, a [...] climb at a 7.7% gradient. Stage 5 included part of the climb of Mont Ventoux, but this came towards {{the beginning of the}} stage and was followed by more than [...] of roads to the finish. The crucial stages were expected to be the final two: Stage 6 finished on the Madone d'Utelle, a [...] climb at 5.7%. The final stage included six categorised climbs, with the Col d'Èze the final climb before the descent into <b>Nice</b> <b>for</b> the finish on the Promenade des Anglais.|$|E
500|$|... "Questions for the Angels" [...] {{includes}} {{a reference to}} American rapper Jay-Z, which {{was inspired by a}} billboard featuring him that was present over the Brooklyn Bridge for a time. Simon mentioned that he would pass it {{on his way to the}} Brooklyn Academy of Music when they were holding a month-long celebration of his music in April 2008. Simon included the line to create a sharp transition from angels in Heaven to a downtown Brooklyn street. [...] "So Beautiful or So What" [...] contains what Simon once admitted is [...] "one of [...] favorite Bo Diddley rhythms," [...] and the song’s title references Miles Davis's [...] "So What". The title is a question Simon envisioned when facing the enormity of the infinite. The song almost became a collaboration with Bob Dylan; Simon felt two verses might be <b>nice</b> <b>for</b> him and sent him a message through their mutual manager. Although Dylan said that he liked the song, Simon did not hear back in sufficient time, as the album was on a deadline.|$|E
500|$|In 2003, Hagström {{hinted at}} the {{direction}} of the band's next album by saying, [...] "There's only one thing I really feel that is important. We've never measured our success in terms of sales, because we're quite an extreme band. It's more that people understand where we're coming from. I get more out of a fan coming up and saying that we've totally changed their way of looking on metal music, than having like 200 kids buy it. I mean, it would be <b>nice</b> <b>for</b> the money, but that's not why we're in it. So what I'd like to see is that we keep progressing. Keeping the core of what Meshuggah has always been, but exploring the bar, so to speak. Destroy Erase Improve was like exploring the dynamics of the band, Chaosphere was exploring the aggressiveness, the all-out side, and Nothing is more of a sinister, dark, pretty slow album, actually. So honestly, now I don't know where we're going. It might be a mix of all of them." ...|$|E

500|$|Cleveland {{liked the}} {{graphics}} in the Game Boy Color version of The Demon Slayer, {{and said that}} {{it reminded him of}} the [...] "8-bit wonders of years ago". Nintendo Power said that the graphics in the Game Boy Color version looked good, but that they lack the richness of most new games on the system. They disliked the backgrounds, which they called [...] "very bland". Famitsu thought the graphics in Last Bible III were good, but that the graphics in Another Bible looked cheap. Kalata and Snelgrove called the color palette in the Game Boy Color versions of the first two games awful, but said that the Sega Game Gear version of the first game looked much better, and that it was very <b>nice</b> <b>for</b> a handheld game; they specifically pointed out its cinematic sequences, which they called impressive. They thought the character designs in Another Bible were [...] "overly adorable", and said that there are graphical issues in the game when players move. They appreciated the backgrounds in Last Bible Special, and commented that some monster designs in Last Bible III were strange.|$|E
500|$|Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, {{in their}} book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode three stars out of five. The two were {{critical}} of the storyline, noting that it [...] "doesn't really work as either a Don't Look Now ghost story or as a conspiracy piece", but praised the acting of Pileggi and the dialogue written by Gordon; the two called the former [...] "great" [...] and the latter [...] "so terse and so real". Paula Vitaris of Cinefantastique gave the episode a mixed review and awarded it two stars out of four. She referred to the scenes between Skinner and Sharon as [...] "contrived" [...] and derided Skinner's bedside confession as [...] "simply poor writing". Vitaris was positive of Duchovny and Hetrick's acting, and wrote that Pileggi gave [...] "his best" [...] {{despite the fact that}} there was little chemistry between the characters to make it effective. David Duchovny, on the other hand, was very pleased with the episode and Mitch Pileggi's performance; he later noted, [...] "It was <b>nice</b> <b>for</b> Mitch, and I think he deserved an episode after two years. He did a great job".|$|E
500|$|... "Battle of the Bastards" [...] was {{the final}} episode for actor Iwan Rheon, who had played Ramsay Bolton since Game of Thrones third season. His first {{appearance}} was in [...] "Dark Wings, Dark Words", as a then-unnamed [...] "boy" [...] who helps a captured Theon Greyjoy. Before he was cast as Ramsay, Rheon auditioned {{for the role of}} Jon Snow. In an interview, he described learning about his character's fate: [...] "I had received half the scripts, five episodes, then I got the call. They joked, 'Isn't it great Ramsay ends up on the Iron Throne?' As soon as they said that I said, 'He's dead, isn't he?' It's cool. I've had four lovely seasons here. It's been great to be involved with such an amazing show. I think it's kind of right he goes down. Because what else {{is he going to do}} after this? He's done so many things. It's justified and it's the right thing to do. It's the right path. He's reached his peak. It's <b>nice</b> <b>for</b> the audience that he goes out on this high, if you will." [...] In that interview, Kit Harington talked about Rheon: [...] "I love Iwan's work. He's an incredibly detailed actor who's created a character who's remarkable and despicable." ...|$|E
