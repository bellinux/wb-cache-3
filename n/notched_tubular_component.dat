40|$|Abstract. Weight {{reduction}} and the structural strengthening of frameworks {{have always been}} of great interest for automobile and bicycle manufacturers. In order to achieve this goal, manufacturers have always been looking for new materials and their corresponding processing technology. This paper focuses on investigating the most suitable forming-control path pattern for manufacturing magnesium-based alloy quadrilateral <b>tubular</b> <b>components</b> using the tube-hydroforming (THF) process for framework components. Conventionally, there are three usual patterns of forming-control path. Through numerical simulation, {{it was found that}} forming-control path C provided the best profile results. The simulation results were also verified by physical THF experiments which were carried out at around 270 ºC to fabricate the quadrilateral <b>tubular</b> <b>component.</b> A good agreement between simulation and experimental result was achieved, indicating that employing forming-control path C in the actual THF process provides the best forming results, minimizing the occurrence of wrinkling. The formability of such high value-added hydroformed <b>tubular</b> <b>components</b> can be predicted. Trial-and-error during the design stage can be avoided, which contributes to lower production costs...|$|R

The relationship between fracture toughness and the morphological organization of the keratin hoof tissue was investigated. Fracture toughness was evaluated using the J-integral analysis method which em-ploys the compact tension test geometry. Tensile tests were also conducted to evaluate the effect of the morphological organization on the stress-strain behaviour. Hoof-wall has greatest fracture resistance for cracks running proximally, parallel to the <b>tubular</b> <b>component</b> of the wall keratin. For fully hydrated material tested in this direction the mean critical J-integral value at failure was l- 19 xlO 4 Jm~ 2.
