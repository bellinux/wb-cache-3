25|$|The {{challenge}} {{of managing the}} {{severe acute respiratory syndrome}} (SARS) epidemic (November 2002 to June 2003) is often credited with further motivating the government to take aggressive policy action on HIV-related issues. SARS showed <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>how</b> infectious diseases could threaten economic and social stability but also the effect of China's policies on international health problems. Policymakers announced a change of focus from purely economic goals to increasing the focus on health and social wellbeing and, as a result, increased support for public health agencies. In controlling SARS, contact between the government and international agencies such as WHO, UN, and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was essential and further stimulated stronger international collaboration for HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment. Intervention strategies necessary for SARS control have been translated into HIV/AIDS prevention – e.g., real-time electronic case reporting.|$|E

500|$|Chaplin {{believed}} his first influence {{to be his}} mother, who entertained him as a child by sitting {{at the window and}} mimicking passers-by: [...] "it was through watching her that I learned <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>how</b> to express emotions with my hands and face, but also how to observe and study people." [...] Chaplin's early years in music hall allowed him to see stage comedians at work; he also attended the Christmas pantomimes at Drury Lane, where he studied the art of clowning through performers like Dan Leno. [...] Chaplin's years with the Fred Karno company had a formative effect on him as an actor and filmmaker. Simon Louvish writes that the company was his [...] "training ground", and it was here that Chaplin learned to vary the pace of his comedy. The concept of mixing pathos with slapstick was learnt from Karno, who also used elements of absurdity that became familiar in Chaplin's gags. From the film industry, Chaplin drew upon the work of the French comedian Max Linder, whose films he greatly admired. In developing the Tramp costume and persona, he was likely inspired by the American vaudeville scene, where tramp characters were common.|$|E
500|$|These {{physical}} variations {{create a}} distinctive set of playing conditions at each ballpark. Other local factors, such as altitude and climate, can also significantly affect play. A given stadium may acquire {{a reputation as}} a pitcher's park or a hitter's park, if one or the other discipline notably benefits from its unique mix of elements. The most exceptional park in this regard is Coors Field, home of the Colorado Rockies. Its high altitude— above sea level—is responsible for giving it the strongest hitter's park effect in the major leagues. Wrigley Field, home of the Chicago Cubs, is known for its fickle disposition: a hitter's park when the strong winds off Lake Michigan are blowing out, it becomes more of a pitcher's park when they are blowing in. The absence of a standardized field affects <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>how</b> particular games play out, but the nature of team rosters and players' statistical records. For example, hitting a fly ball [...] into right field might result in an easy catch on the warning track at one park, and a home run at another. A team that plays in a park with a relatively short right field, such as the New York Yankees, will tend to stock its roster with left-handed pull hitters, who can best exploit it. On the individual level, a player who spends most of his career with a team that plays in a hitter's park will gain an advantage in batting statistics over time—even more so if his talents are especially suited to the park.|$|E

He noted that some songs were [...] "very atmospheric" [...] while others maintained [...] "the hard rock and the heavy stuff". Jon Wiederhorn of MTV said that [...] "for every thrash riff there's a tunefully grungy passage, for every flailing guitar line there's a rock-radio hook." [...] When talking about the track [...] "30/30-150", he said parts are [...] "bludgeoning, barbed and heavy" [...] while others are [...] "soaring and triumphant" [...] with the production of Raskulinecz helping to balance the album's heaviness with its radio-accessibility. Come What(ever) Mays lyrics include themes of [...] "pain, pleasure, happiness, and grief". The diversity in subjects is evident throughout the album; songs including [...] "Come What(ever) May" [...] were politically influenced while the track [...] "Socio" [...] is about [...] "social anxiety attacks" [...] that Taylor suffered. [...] "Zzyzx Rd" [...] is a love song written to Taylor's wife for helping him in his struggles against alcoholism and contemplation of suicide. [...] "I've never written anything like that before, but it was very important for me to tell the world <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>how</b> much she saved me, but how much she means to me," [...] said Taylor.

2500|$|... "To {{understand}} and appreciate Fatima is to {{understand and}} appreciate Portuguese Catholicism". Jeffrey S. Bennett takes note of how, starting in the 1930s, the image of Our Lady of Fatima developed into a rallying point for anti-communism, an idea that spread far beyond the Iberian peninsula. Martindale mentions a concept where the fruits of a phenomenon {{are more important than}} its historical origins. Therefore, it is possible to conceive of a vibrant cultus where the strength of the devotion, shrine, or pilgrimage, can outweigh uncertainties regarding its origin. According to Maunder, Fatima demonstrates <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>how</b> seriously Catholics took [...] "the revelations of an enclosed nun remembering visions she had experienced at the age of ten, but also show how difficult it is for the hierarchy to manage a movement of popular piety, despite critics claims of manipulation. Following Fatima, there would be proliferation of apocalyptic manifestations, such as at Necedah.|$|E
