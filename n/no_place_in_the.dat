5|$|Political and {{religious}} differences between old Missourians and newly-arriving Mormon settlers provoked {{tensions between the}} two groups, much as they had years earlier in Jackson County. By this time, Smith's experiences with mob violence led him to believe that his faith's survival required greater militancy against anti-Mormons. Around June 1838, recent convert Sampson Avard formed a covert organization called the Danites to intimidate Mormon dissenters and oppose anti-Mormon militia units. Though {{it is unclear how}} much Smith knew of the Danites' activities, he clearly approved of those of which he did know. After Rigdon delivered a sermon that implied dissenters had <b>no</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Mormon community, the Danites forcibly expelled them from the county.|$|E

Since Muslims had <b>no</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Catholic church, which {{maintained}} great influence over the state, Muslims were often excluded from education and important jobs in the government. As a result, Muslim employment was largely confined to engaging in petty trade, and taking up jobs as drivers.|$|E
25|$|The first {{sentence}} of H.J. Res. 56 {{would provide an}} official definition of legal marriage in the United States. Proponents claim {{that this is a}} reasonable measure, based on established custom, which defends the family and the institution of marriage. To others, it is an unfair means of excluding same-sex couples from receiving benefits from that institution. Civil right activists and supporters of the LGBT (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender) community feel that the Federal Marriage Amendment has <b>no</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States constitution.|$|E
25|$|Makart's {{painting}} The Entry of Charles V into Antwerp {{caused some}} controversy, because Charles V was depicted arriving in a procession surrounded by nude virgins; the offense was the mistaken {{idea that the}} nudes had <b>no</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> modern scene. In the United States, the painting fell under the proscription of Anthony Comstock, which secured Makart's fame there. The American public desired at once to see what Comstock was persecuting, so they could tell whether he was acting correctly or in error.|$|E

25|$|Spironolactone {{has been}} studied at a high dosage in the {{treatment}} of benign prostatic hyperplasia. It was found to be better than placebo in terms of symptom relief following three months of treatment. However, this was not maintained after six months of treatment, by which point the improvements had largely disappeared. Moreover, no difference was observed between spironolactone and placebo with regard to volume of residual urine or prostate size. Gynecomastia was observed in about 5% of people. On the basis of these results, {{it has been said that}} spironolactone has <b>no</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia.|$|E
25|$|For all its success, the Balloon Corps {{was never}} fully {{appreciated}} {{by the military}} community. They were still regarded as carnival showmen. Others had little respect for their break-neck operation. The only ones who found any value in them were the generals whose jobs and reputations were on the line. Lower-ranking administrators looked with disdain on this band of civilians who, as they perceived them, had <b>no</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> military. Furthermore, none of the corps ever received a military commission, leaving them facing the dangers of being captured and treated as spies, summarily punishable by death.|$|E

An early chance for David Wheater was controversially ruled out for a foul, but he converted again in the second half for Boro's first goal of the season. Mido, on as a substitute, converted a cross/shot from fellow substitute Digard to put the home side two goals up, before Robert Huth conceded an own goal late in stoppage time.|$|E

25|$|Futurism is {{a modernist}} avant-garde {{movement}} {{in literature and}} part of the Futurism art movement that originated in Italy in the early 20th century. It made its official literature debut with the publication of Filippo Tommaso Marinetti's Manifesto of Futurism (1909). Futurist poetry is characterised by unexpected combinations of images and by its hyper-concision (in both economy of speech and actual length). Futurist theatre also played an important role within the movement and is distinguished by scenes that are only a few sentences long, an emphasis on nonsensical humour, and attempts to examine and subvert traditions of theatre via parody and other techniques. Longer forms of literature, such as the novel, have <b>no</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Futurist aesthetic of speed and compression. Futurist literature primarily focuses on seven aspects: intuition, analogy, irony, abolition of syntax, metrical reform, onomatopoeia, and essential/synthetic lyricism.|$|E
25|$|For the soundtrack, Zimmer created themes {{for each}} member of the family. Homer's leitmotif was a major focus, and he also {{composed}} smaller themes for Bart and Marge. Zimmer asked arranger Michael A. Levine to turn the Spider-Pig song into a choral piece, which, at the time, had <b>no</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> film. Later, Brooks decided to use it for the scene in which Homer has a psychedelic epiphany and then, again, as the first number in the closing credits. The lyrics of the piece were translated for the 32 dubbed versions of the song when the film was released internationally. The same choir learned to sing the piece for each of the foreign-language dubs. Levine also composed and arranged the music for when Homer and Marge make love with the help of Alaskan wildlife. The piece features soprano Elin Carlson singing all three parts of a vocal trio.|$|E
25|$|The Medinah Athletic Club {{building}} {{was intended to}} combine elements of many architectural styles. At the eighth floor, its Indiana limestone facade was decorated by three large relief carvings in ancient Assyrian style. Each frieze depicted a different scene {{in the order of}} constructing a building, with Contribution on the south wall, Wisdom represented on the west wall and Consecration on the north. (According to an article in the Chicago Tribune from Sept 16, 1928 entitled “Building art inspires panels”:“The friezes were designed by George Unger, in collaboration with Walter Ahlschlager, and carved by Léon Hermant. The figures are costumed in the period of the building, which is that of an old fortress in Mesopotamia in Xerxes time, about 5th century BC. The theme of the panels as explained by Mr. Unger, was inspired by the history of construction of any building. The south panel starts the story. Here a magnificent cortege is displayed. This panel, termed Contribution, signifies the getting together of treasures for the construction of the building. In the west panel, facing Michigan Avenue, a ruler is shown with his counselors and an architect is shown bringing in a model of the building planned. The north panel shows the consecration of the building after it has been built. A priest is sacrificing a white bull whose blood will be mixed with crushed grapes and poured into the earth. A monkey trainer and his animals are shown. Since the animals represented bigotry in the ancient drawings, they are shown here in leash as symbolic belief that bigotry has <b>no</b> <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Masonic order.”) The figures in all three scenes are said to be modeled after the faces of club members {{at the time of its}} design. Three Sumerian warriors were also carved into the facade at the twelfth-floor setback, directly above the Michigan Avenue entrance, and remain visible today.|$|E
