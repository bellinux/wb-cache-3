5000|$|By {{the time}} Wilton North did finally reach {{the air on}} December 11, its own cast and crew would have {{difficulty}} articulating what the show was even trying to do. While the show did feature comedy segments and musical performances (the group Squeeze made one such musical appearance), the {{emphasis was placed on}} interviews and features, among them a visit to an alligator farm, a woman who claimed that her toaster was possessed by demons, and a sit-down interview <b>Nancy</b> <b>Collins</b> conducted with Andrea Hart, the daughter of Presidential candidate Gary Hart. [...] The on-air product was met with general derision from critics; Clifford Terry of the Chicago Tribune said the show took a smug, studious approach to its subject material, while Ken Tucker of the Philadelphia Inquirer thought the [...] "video version of Spy magazine" [...] lacked [...] "genuinely amusing rudeness." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Sword Woman", a story written {{somewhere between}} 1932 and 1934, is {{described}} by Mark Finn as protofeminist. Told in the first person, the story follows a 16th-century French woman [...] "Dark Agnes" [...] de Chastillon who may be based on Novalyne Price. She rejects her place in society, escapes an attempt at forced marriage and becomes a mercenary. There is no record of Howard ever submitting it for publication but he sent copies to correspondents such as Catherine L. Moore. Although Howard often included weaker female characters in his stories, they contain many stronger women as well. These include the several pirates: Helen Tavrel ("The Isle of Pirates' Doom", 1928), Bêlit ("Queen of the Black Coast", 1934), Valeria of the Red Brotherhood ("Red Nails", 1936) {{as well as the}} Ukrainian mercenary Red Sonya of Rogatino ("The Shadow of the Vulture", 1934). [...] Female fantasy writers such as Moore, Leigh Brackett, Jessica Salmonson and <b>Nancy</b> <b>Collins</b> have all expressed admiration for the Dark Agnes character.|$|E

5000|$|As first conceived, The Wilton North Reports opening segment, {{which was}} {{planned to be}} its {{signature}} segment, would review the day's news using actual footage, then have the hosts comment on it in a funny, hard-hitting fashion. (CBC Television's This Hour Has 22 Minutes and Comedy Central's The Daily Show would follow a similar premise later on.) Before the show's debut, however, producer Barry Sand would eliminate the news segment, believing it didn't mesh with the [...] "friendly" [...] approach of the show's co-hosts, Phil Cowan and Paul Robins. What Wilton North did have at its premiere was a newsmagazine-type show, relying {{not so much on}} jokes about current events as on features, interviews, and remote reports (some serious, others not so much), as well as occasional comedy bits and live musical performances. Cowan and Robins would serve as the show's [...] "anchors" [...] and offer their own comments and opinions and segments, with a regular assortment of reporters and commentators alongside them. The cast included interviewers and reporters including <b>Nancy</b> <b>Collins,</b> Greg Jackson, Wayne Satz, and (on health and fitness) Jack LaLanne, along with commentary on the news by staff writer and author/commentator Paul Krassner.|$|E
5000|$|Authors David Agranoff and <b>Nancy</b> <b>Collins</b> and editor/critic Paula Guran cite his intense, expressionistic early horror novels, such as Dracula In Love and Cellars as an {{influence}} on the splatterpunk movement in horror, and the subsequent [...] "bizarro" [...] movement. Appreciation of John Shirley as an author of dark fiction was amplified by a January 2008 The New York Times review, by critic Terrence Rafferty, of Shirleys story-collection Living Shadows which said in part: It’s a greatest-hits album spanning a few decades of astonishingly consistent and rigorously horrifying work[...] [...] Shirley’s great subject is the terrible ease with which we modern Americans have learned to look away from pain and suffering. The opening line of his novel “Demons” states the theme succinctly: “It’s amazing {{what you can get}} used to.” [...] [...] [...]Maybe the best story in this superb collection is a rapt little piece called “Skeeter Junkie,” in which a young heroin addict first begins to enjoy the feeling of the mosquito feeding on his arm, then starts to identify with it and then, as the drugs ooze through his veins, somehow becomes it and finally uses the “exquisite” flying bloodsucker to transport him to the apartment of his comely but standoffish downstairs neighbor. It’s a horror story, I guess, but it’s also funny, weirdly erotic and, in a way that horror almost never is, tragic.|$|E
