5|$|By {{early on}} August 27, the {{tropical}} storm became slightly better organized, although {{the most intense}} winds were still removed from the center. Danny peaked with maximum sustained winds of 60mph (95km/h) and a minimum pressure of 1006 mbar (hPa; 29.71 inHg). It held this strength for about 12 hours before wind shear caused the storm to gradually weaken as it meandered northward. By August 28, Danny further deteriorated, and reconnaissance aircraft {{found that it was}} barely a tropical storm. After stalling during the afternoon, the center resumed a <b>north</b> <b>or</b> north-northwestward drift.|$|E

5|$|During the 1960s the {{installation}} of overhead electrification commenced between London Euston and both Liverpool Lime Street and Manchester Piccadilly. Phase 1 comprised electrification between Crewe and Liverpool and Manchester. Phase 2 involved the extension southwards from Crewe to London. The massive proportions of the Coronation Class resulted in their prohibition from operating under those wires. Camden's allocation was now run down (the remaining locomotives being transferred to nearby Willesden (1A)), whilst Polmadie's was dispensed with entirely. The bulk of the class was situated at either Crewe <b>North</b> <b>or</b> Carlisle, the Kingmoor shed (12A, 68A from 1958) now being used in addition to Upperby.|$|E

For those burials where the funeral service had already been held at either a parish church or the LNC's London terminus the coffins would be taken directly from the train to the grave.|$|E
5|$|Plans for {{the route}} that {{eventually}} became the Victoria line {{date from the}} 1940s. A proposal for a new underground railway line linking north-east London with the centre {{was included in the}} County of London Plan in 1943. Between 1946 and 1954, a series of routes were proposed by different transport authorities to connect various places in south and <b>north</b> <b>or</b> north-east London. Each of these connected the three main line termini at King's Cross, Euston and Victoria. A route was approved in 1955 with future extensions to be decided later, though funding for the construction was not approved by the government until 1962.|$|E
5|$|Red-tailed black {{cockatoos}} are diurnal, raucous and noisy, and {{are often}} seen flying high overhead in small flocks, sometimes mixed with other cockatoos. Flocks of up to 500birds are generally only seen in the <b>north</b> <b>or</b> when the birds are concentrated at some food source. Otherwise, they are generally rather shy of humans. In northern and central Australia, birds may feed on the ground, while the two southern subspecies, graptogyne and naso, are almost exclusively arboreal. They tend to fly rather slowly with intermittent deep flapping wingbeats, markedly different from the shallow wingbeats of the similar glossy black cockatoo. They also often fly at considerable height.|$|E
