Powdered rubber wood (Hevea Brasiliensis) has been cyanoethylated {{in the same way}} as cellulose and the product (CRW) blended with HDPE both without and with maleic anhydride-grafted-HDPE as compatibilizer. Measurement of impact properties reveals that the use of a compatibilizer significantly increases the dispersion of CRW particles in the HDPE matrix and promotes ductile fracture and higher impact strength, while the effects of <b>notrogen</b> content of CRW on these properties are only marginal...|$|E
40|$|Measurements of {{the ratio}} OH/HO 2, NO, O 3, ClO, and BrO were {{obtained}} at altitudes from 15 - 20 km and latitudes from 15 - 60 deg N. A method is presented for interpreting {{the rates of}} chemical transformations that (1) are responsible for over half the ozone removal rate in the lower stratosphere via reactions of HO 2; and (2) control the abundance of HO 2 through coupling to nitrogen and halogen radicals. The results show {{our understanding of the}} chemical reactions controlling the partitioning of OH and HO 2 is complete and accurate and that the potential effects of 'missing chemistry' are strickly constrained in the region of the atmosphere encompassed by the observations. The analysis demonstrates that the sensitivity of the ratio OH/HO 2 to changes in NO is described to within 12 % by current models. This reduces by more than a factor of 2 the effect of uncertainty in the coupling of hydrogen and nitrogen radicals on the analysis of the potential effects of perturbations to odd <b>notrogen</b> in the lower statosphere...|$|E
40|$|The {{bench scale}} {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} with an aim to teat the palm oil mill effluent by utilizing it's physical and chemical characteristics. The raw effluent has a temperature of 80 degree C to 85 degree C, thus by introducing a vacuum of 350 mm Hg, the effluent will evaporate without any addition of heat. The vapour produced was then passed through a bed of adsorbent. Four different types of adsorbents were studied in this part namely activated carbon, natural zeolite and synthetic zeolite of the X and A type. The vapour, (before adsorption) when analysed showed a 99 % removal of most polluting parameters monitored except for pH, COD and BOD. The effluent {{was able to be}} concentrated to as high as 25 % solid content from the initial content of 3 - 5 % solids. This will result in a recovery of 80 % of the water content and also the POME volume will reduce by the same percentage. The concentrated effluent analysis showed a high content of <b>notrogen,</b> phosphorus and pottasium which can be used as feed material for the making of fertiliser. Next, the adsorption process results indicated that the synthetic zeolite gave a better treatment than that of natural adsorbents...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. To {{increase}} the utilization efficiency of LNG cold energy, this paper analyzes LNG regasification process basing on energy-grade analysis. The result shows that comprehensive utilization both of doing work and heat transfer {{is the most}} efficient. Moreover, this paper proposes a chart to select a suitable cold energy utilizaiton way. Instroduction The evolution of global and regional LNGtrande {{over the past twenty}} years has been a story of rapid growth, diversification and increased flexibility in LNG cargo movements[1]. During the last decades the total cost of technology has decreased significantly due to improvements of the liquefaction process. However, the regasfication system has not been considerable improved. It is known that for the regasfication process about 1. 5 % is used[2]. The recovery of the physical exergy of cold available during the regasfication of LNG in Regasfication Plant is of capital interest. The cold contained in LNG has a large environmental impact, usually on the sea near the regasfication site. Some studies[3, 4] have been carried out on the possibility of cold energy recovery in cold technology application facilities (e. g. air liquefaction producing <b>Notrogen,</b> Oxygen, Argon, deep freeze warehouses, cold storage warehouse and the freezing process of foods etc.). Exergy analysis is an important method in energy fields. A previous research made by many researchers deal with the exergy utilization in the process of LNG regasfication[5 - 8]. Exergy analysis can predict the distribution, sources and magnitude of irreversible losses in energy systems, and hence, provide guidelines for efficient energy usage[9]. However, exergy analysis only focuses on the exergy utilization, without the anergy utilization. Although anergy {{can not be used to}} produce power through driving turbine, it can provide thermal energy to heat exchanger. In 1986, Professor Yang...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to provide data on the thermodynamic properties of fluid carbon monoxide (CO). Part I of the thesis describes an apparatus which was built for measuring second virial coefficients, B, of gases at low temperatures and pressures, using the Burnett expansion method. 12 values of B were obtained at temperatures from 100 to 230 K. The presure was measured to #+-# 2 Pa. The error in #beta# is estimated to vary from #+-# 5 cm" 3 mo?" 1 at the lower temperatures to #+-# 3 cm" 3 mo?" 1 at the higher temperatures. A corresponding-states calculation applied to CO and <b>notrogen,</b> based on a reduction with Boyle parameters, showed that these two substances are conformable at higher temperatures but deviate progressively from conformality at lower temperatures. Perturbation theory revealed that the only relevant non spherical symmetric contribution to the values of B for CO and nitrogen is due to quadupole-quadrupole interactions which can account for the deviation conformality observed, both qualitatively and quantitatively. Part II of this describes the measurements of 125 (p,V,T) points of liquid CO at temperature between 81. 64 K (normal boiling temperature) and 125 K (critical temperature= 132. 91), at pressures from the vapor pressure to 140 MPa or the solidification temperature, when lower, using the expansion method, on an existing apparatus. Pressure and temperature were measured with an accuracy of #+-# 0. 01 %MPa and #+-# 10 mK, respectively. The accuracy of the reported molar volumes is estimated to be #+-# 0. 1 %. The Strobridge equation was fitted to the (p,V,T) results. Using the blocked-capillary melting pressure and the molar volume of CO at the melting pressure were determinated at 81. 64 and 90. 24 K. The enthalpies of vaporization of the liquid to give saturated gas was derived with the Clapeyton equation. To the end, an equation was fitted to vapor pressure data for CO from literature and the molar volumes of the orthobaric liquid and gas were calculated. The uncertainty in the enthalpies derived is estimate to be "+-" 0. 5 % at lower temperatures but should be larger at the higher temperatures. The configurational internal energy of the satured liquid was calculated at regular temperatures values. The molar volume, isothermal compressibility and isobaric thermal expansivity of the liquid were calculated at the regular intervals of temperature and pressureAvailable from Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia, Servico de Informacao e Documentacao, Av.
