5|$|The plant {{now known}} as Opuntia ficus-indica, or the Indian fig cactus, {{has long been an}} {{important}} source of food. The original species is thought to have come from central Mexico, although this is now obscure because the indigenous people of southern North America developed and distributed a range of horticultural varieties (cultivars), including forms of the species and hybrids with other opuntias. Both the fruit and pads are eaten, the former often under the Spanish name tuna, the latter under the name <b>nopal.</b> Cultivated forms are often significantly less spiny or even spineless. The <b>nopal</b> industry in Mexico was said to be worth US$150million in 2007. The Indian fig cactus was probably already present in the Caribbean when the Spanish arrived, and was soon after brought to Europe. It spread rapidly in the Mediterranean area, both naturally and by being introduced—so much so, early botanists assumed it was native to the area. Outside the Americas, the Indian fig cactus is an important commercial crop in Sicily, Algeria and other North African countries. Fruits of other opuntias are also eaten, generally under the same name, tuna. Flower buds, particularly of Cylindropuntia species, are also consumed.|$|E
25|$|In 1853, one adobe hut {{stood in}} Nopalera (<b>Nopal</b> field), {{named for the}} Mexican <b>Nopal</b> cactus {{indigenous}} to the area. By 1870, an agricultural community flourished.

25|$|According to tradition, the Templo Mayor {{is located}} on the exact spot where the god Huitzilopochtli gave the Mexica people his sign that they had reached the promised land: an eagle on a <b>nopal</b> cactus with a snake in its mouth.|$|E
50|$|Basic Mexican {{foodstuffs}} is {{the backbone}} of this markets selling Mexican spices such as epazote, chili peppers fresh and dried of just about every variety, <b>nopals</b> (cactus pads), pig skins fried whole, corn, and uncommon items such as wild mushrooms including a variety that look like chantrelle but denser. One {{of the few places}} to find truly authentic Oaxaca cheese in the city. Vendors can be seen tying stacks of banana leaves, cutting spines from <b>nopals,</b> and selling “secret” herbal remedies.|$|R
25|$|Traditional dishes include pipian (both red and green), tamales, {{various types}} of beans and tlacoyos. One local bean is called “ayocote” which is large and dark red. Avocado leaves are used to flavor food and dishes often feature tomatoes, tomatillos, <b>nopals</b> and a plant called huanzontle. Cecina from {{the nearby town of}} Yecapixtla is popular as well.|$|R
25|$|In most areas, {{various species}} of cacti {{can be seen}} such as the organ pipe and <b>nopals,</b> {{as well as the}} yucca. Trees adapted to dry climates include mesquite, willows and cypress, near streams and rivers. Animal life mostly {{consists}} of small mammals, deer, predatory birds and reptiles. In some areas, monarch butterflies can be seen as well. Nature reserves in the municipality include the Peña Colorado, Tángano, Parque Ecologicao Joya-La Barreta and the El Cimatario National Park.|$|R
25|$|There is also {{a number}} of fairs {{dedicated}} to local products. The Feria del <b>Nopal</b> (<b>Nopal</b> Cactus Fair) in San Bernardino Tlaxcalanzingo celebrates the main crop grown in the municipality. It occurs {{during the first week}} of June.

There is an exposition and sale of local cheeses at the main plaza of the municipality on the first weekend of August. There {{is also a}}n annual festival dedicated to bread in which an enormous brick oven is constructed on the main plaza and local bread makers demonstrate traditional techniques. Over 150 types of bread are exhibited and sold during the event.|$|E
25|$|Mexican {{and other}} southwestern {{residents}} eat the young cactus pads (nopales, plural, <b>nopal,</b> singular), usually picked before the spines harden. They are sliced into strips, skinned or unskinned, and fried with eggs and jalapeños, {{served as a}} breakfast treat. They have a texture and flavor like string beans.|$|E
25|$|The {{outlying}} {{communities have}} a number of festivals as well.

50|$|Much of {{the economy}} of the {{municipality}} is based on small-scale farming and livestock raising as well as commerce. Agriculture occupies the majority of the land but only 15% of the people. Crops grown here include fruit trees such as apples, peaches, pears, tejocotes, oranges and limes, grains such as corn and various vegetables such as beans and <b>nopals.</b> Most of the crops are irrigated with groundwater which is found close to the surface. Mining and industries employ 27% while commerce, tourism and services employs about 55%.|$|R
5000|$|The {{climate of}} Zacatecas is cool {{semi-arid}} (BSk, {{according to the}} Köppen climate classification), with an average annual temperature of [...] Freezing temperatures are not uncommon, especially in January and February. [...] Temperatures in winter and during the nights {{most of the year}} require a coat or heavy jacket. Most rain falls between June and October, [...] and there is a defined winter. [...] Principal wild vegetation is that adapted to dry areas such as <b>nopals,</b> mesquite, maguey and grasses, with pines and holm oaks in the higher elevations. Wildlife includes coyotes, grey foxes, bobcats, opossums, rabbits, raccoons, other small mammals was well as variety of small birds and reptiles.|$|R
50|$|Most of the {{municipality}} is flat with another quarter having rolling hills. Altitude varies from 1,500 to 2,000 meters above sea level. The main elevations {{are in the}} Sierra de la Primavera and include Nejahuete, Tajo and El Chapulin. Superficial water flows mostly in arroyos east to the Grande or Santiago River. In the center of {{the municipality}} there are three dams called the Copalita, the Santa Lucia and the San Jose. Winters here are mild and usually are noticeable only in the higher elevations. Average year-round temperature is 22C with highs of 36C and lows of 11C. Rain principally falls from June to October. Vegetation in the municipality varies from pines and holm oaks in the Sierra de la Primavera and species such as jonote (Heliocarpus appendiculatus), strawberry trees and <b>nopals</b> in the lower elevations. While wildlife has nearly disappeared from this area, the Bosque el Nixticuil on the northern edge of the urban sprawl has been designated as a protected natural area and still is home to many mammals, reptiles, amphibians, birds and insects.|$|R
25|$|Zacatecas’s economy used to {{be almost}} {{completely}} centered on mining but has since diversified into cattle raising, agriculture, communications, food processing, tourism and transportation. Zacatecas is Mexico’s main producer of beans, chili peppers, guavas and <b>nopal,</b> along with significant grain, sugar cane, grape and peach crops. It is also a major producer of rum, pulque and mezcal and even produces red wine. These activities account for just over {{ten percent of the}} state’s GDP.|$|E
25|$|The {{climate in}} the area is mostly {{temperate}} and semi-arid, with average temperatures varying between 16 and 22°C. Summers are moderately hot with a rainy season that generally producing sporadic thunderstorms. Winters are moderate. The temperature varies between 16 and 22°C with cool winters. One exception to this is the extreme west of the municipality where the climate is wetter. Ecosystems include shrublands, forests of oak, and areas where <b>nopal</b> cactus and/or grass dominate.|$|E
25|$|The {{discovery}} of the Americas brought {{to the rest of}} the world many widely used food crops and edible plants. Some of Mexico's native culinary ingredients include: chocolate, avocado, tomato, maize, vanilla, guava, chayote, epazote, camote, jícama, <b>nopal,</b> zucchini, tejocote, huitlacoche, sapote, mamey sapote, many varieties of beans, and an even greater variety of chiles, such as the habanero and the jalapeño. Most of these names come from indigenous languages like Nahuatl.|$|E
2500|$|Most of the {{municipality}} {{is covered in}} various types of mostly deciduous forest, with leaves fully or partially fall {{during the dry season}} and the very cold weeks in December and January. Forests of pine, red and white cedar and sweetgum are prominent in the higher elevations. In the hot and dry areas, various cactus and other arid area plants such as cats claw, biznaga cactus, maguey, organ cactus, and <b>nopals</b> can be found. Landa has one of the few mesophile forests in the state of Querétaro, which is mostly found in steep canyon areas between 800 and 2000 masl. Between 600 and 800 meters, the mesophile forest blends with tropical rainforest such as {{in the bottom of the}} Tancuilin Canyon. A study of flora in {{the municipality}} counted 774 species of vascular plants, with the most diversity found in old growth areas where the thick tree canopy traps moisture. These areas have trees that measure thirty to forty meters in height. Most of the plant species are classified as herbs, followed by bushes, then trees, reeds, epiphyte and parasitic plants. Ninety one percent are classified as tropical vegetation. The variety of species here represents about 25% of the plant diversity in Mexico. A recently discovered species, named Physalis queretaroensis, is a rare plant restricted to the municipality. It is related to P. volubilis, [...] which is restricted to Jalisco and Michoacán, but differs in form and insertion of the leaves and vestiture. It is an herb that grows about seventy cm in height in the forest areas of oak, pine and mesophile forests in altitudes between 1700 and 1850 masl.|$|R
6000|$|The best tuneras (cochineal-plantations) lay in Grand Canary, {{where they}} could be most watered. Wherever maize thrives, {{producing}} a good dark leaf and grain in plenty, there cochineal also succeeds. The soil is technically called mina de tosca, a whitish, pumice-like stone, often forming a gravel conglomerate under a rocky stratum: hardening by exposure, it is good for building. Immense labour is required to prepare such ground for the cactus. The earth must be taken from below the surface-rock, as at Malta; spread in terraced beds, and cleared of loose stones, which are built up in walls or in molleras, cubes or pyramids. Such ground sold for $150 per acre; $600 were paid for mètre-deep soil unencumbered by stone. Where the chalk predominates, it must be mixed with the volcanic sand locally called zahorra. In all cases the <b>nopals</b> are set at distances of half a yard, in trenches at least three feet deep. The 'streets,' or intervals, must measure nearly two yards, so that water may flow freely and sunshine may not be arrested. Good ground, if irrigated in winter and kept clear of weeds by the haçada (hoe), produces a cactus capable of being 'seeded' after the second year; if poor, a third is required. The plant lasts, with manure to defend it from exhaustion, a full decade. [Footnote: The compost was formerly natural, dry or liquid as in Switzerland; but for some years the costly guano and chemicals have been introduced. Formerly also potatoes were set between the stems; and well-watered lands gave an annual grain-crop as well as a green crop.] ...|$|R
5000|$|The parish of Santa María de Guadalupe was {{constructed}} in the 17th century in Plateresque style. In the cupola, there is a painting of the Virgin Mary during the Assumption. In {{front of the church}} is the Plaza Arturo Velez Martinez. [...] This church is the seat of the diocese of Atlacomulco. The diocese was established in 1984 by decree of John Paul II, naming Ricardo Guízar Díaz as the first bishop. The current bishop is Constancio Mirada. [...] The Sanctuary of the Señor del Huerto is in Neoclassical style built in the 19th century. It contains three oils that depict the resurrection of Jesus, his flogging and being kissed by Judas. Another notable temple is dedicated to Francis of Assisi and was built in 1984.Public buildings include the municipal palace, (1945), the Venustiano Carranza Sports Center (1944), the Teatro del Pueblo (People’s Theater) (1945), the Lienzo Charro Nicolas Gonzalez Fabela (1951) and the Isidro Fabela Cultural Center, which was built in the 19th century but was remodeled in 1969. [...] In this center there are artistic and cultural workshops. The main festival for the year is the Festival of the Señor del Huerto (Lord of the Grove). This festival contains both Christian and pagan elements, and takes place on the third week of September. This festival has processions, dances, amusement rides and fireworks. Traditional dances that are performed include Las Pastoras, Los Santiagueros, Los Vaquero and Los Arcos. Processions are accompanied by musicians playing violins, chirimias and drums. The Señor del Huerto is an image of Jesus that was supposedly found with an elderly man who had wandered from his home. The man was found dead sometime after he was noticed missing, but the body was perfectly preserved. This was the first miracle attributed to the image.Like much of the State of Mexico, the cuisine here includes barbacoa and carnitas. One dish that is local is called ensalada de juanes, (juanes salad) which combins <b>nopals,</b> tomatoes, cilantro, avocado, pork rinds, cheese and watercress. Pulque is popular here as well.|$|R
25|$|The city of Mexico-Tenochtitlan {{was founded}} by the Mexica people in 1325. The old Mexica city that is now simply {{referred}} to as Tenochtitlan was built on {{an island in the}} center of the inland lake system of the Valley of Mexico, which it shared with a smaller city-state called Tlatelolco. According to legend, the Mexicas' principal god, Huitzilopochtli, indicated the site where they were to build their home by presenting an eagle perched on a <b>nopal</b> cactus with a snake in its beak.|$|E
25|$|The Mezquital Valley has best {{preserved}} the state’s indigenous, especially Otomi, culinary heritage based {{a number of}} traditional native animal and vegetable products. One {{of these is the}} use of a number of edible insects, many of which are considered delicacies such as escamoles (ant eggs) and maguey larvae as well as others such as larvae found on <b>nopal</b> plants, “chacas” (beetles) and “chicharras” (cicadas). Other local animals still used for food include tadpoles (called atepocates), salamanders and their larvae, squirrels and rabbits. Plant species still commonly used include mesquite beans, <b>nopal</b> and other cactus, and various cactus fruit such as “tunas” (cactus pears) and “xoconostle.” These are often prepared in dishes that the state shares with {{most of the rest of}} Mexico such as tacos, tamales, moles and a specialty of central Mexico, mixiote. Another common central Mexican dish popular in the state is barbacoa. This dish has its origins in the pre-Hispanic period, when it was meat cooked in an underground pit. Today, it is most often cooked in pots in more conventional ovens, but the meat, today mostly pork, is still smothered in the alcoholic beverage pulque and wrapped in maguey leaves for flavor. This preparation of barbacoa is considered to be the state dish.|$|E
25|$|Artists of the {{independence}} era in Mexico (1810–21) produced works showing the insurgency's heroes. A portrait of secular cleric José María Morelos in his military uniform was painted by an unknown artist. The portrait is typical of those from the late eighteenth century, with framing elements, a formal caption, and new elements being iconography of the emerging Mexican nationalism, including the eagle atop the <b>nopal</b> cactus, which became the central image for the Mexican flag. Morelos {{was the subject of}} a commissioned statue, with Pedro Patiño Ixtolinque, who trained at the Academy of San Carlos and remained an important sculptor through the era of era independence.|$|E
50|$|The {{mayor of}} each borough, called delegado, is {{appointed}} by {{the mayor of the}} city, although there have been attempts to make these posts popularly elected.The municipality has rolling hills, mountain ranges and flatlands. Most of the rolling hills cross the territory from south to north, paralleling the Querétaro-San Luis Potosí highway. Most plains are located in the north, and are of sedimentary soil with some protrusions of volcanic rock. Altitude varies from 1,900 to 2,460 meters above sea level with the highest elevations at mountains called El Buey, Pie de Gallo, El Patol, El Nabo, and El Paisano. The city proper is on a plain at 1,900 meters. There is only one river, the Querétaro River, which carved the La Cañada. There are numerous streams, many of them seasonal, and fresh water springs near the mountain areas. The climate is temperate and semi-dry in which the summers can be hot, with high up to 36C in May and June. Freezing temperatures are possible in the winter.In most areas, various species of cacti can be seen such as the organ pipe and <b>nopals,</b> as well as the yucca. Trees adapted to dry climates include mesquite, willows and cypress, near streams and rivers. Animal life mostly consists of small mammals, deer, predatory birds and reptiles.

Nature reserves in the municipality include the Peña Colorado, Tángano, Parque Ecologicao Joya-La Barreta and the El Cimatario National Park.Near the city is the Sierra Gorda de Querétaro, part of the Sierra Madre Oriental, was declared by UNESCO as a Biosphere Reserve. This protected area is very rugged terrain, filled with canyons, steep mountains, waterfalls and deep abysses with a total expansion of 24,803 hectares. The area contains 360 species of birds, 130 species of mammals, 71 of reptiles and twenty-three of amphibians. It also contains about thirty percent of the country's butterfly species including the endangered Humboldt, the Jaguar the Oso Negro and the Guacamaya. Plant species include 1,710 different species including endangered species and is considered {{to be one of the}} best-preserved forested areas in Mexico. The Missionary Route of Friar Junípero Serra passes through here as caves such as the Sótano del Barro are located here.The territory contains deposits of gold, silver, manganese, tin, mercury, lead, zinc, opal, quartz, cantera stone (for building) among other minerals.|$|R
25|$|The main deity in the Mexica {{religion}} was the sun god and war god, Huitzilopochtli. He directed the Mexicas {{to found a}} city on the site where they would see an eagle, devouring (not all chronicles agree on what the eagle was devouring, one {{says it was a}} precious bird, and though Father Duran says it was a snake, this is not mentioned in any pre-Hispanic source) perched on a fruit bearing <b>nopal</b> cactus. According to legend, Huitzilopochtli had to kill his nephew, Cópil, and throw his heart on the lake. But, since Cópil was his relative, Huitzilopochtli decided to honor him, and caused cactus to grow over Cópil's heart which became a sacred place.|$|E
25|$|There {{are about}} 20,000 {{hectares}} of forest {{which can be}} cut and include species such as pine, oyamel, juniper, white cedar and red cedar, oak, poplar, strawberry trees, mesquite and more. In areas without logging, {{there are a number}} of species of plants with medicinal properties, including wild oregano, cat´s claws and more, which produce a harvest of about 500 tons per year. Wild foodstuffs include maguey, <b>nopal</b> cactus, pitayo fruit, yuccas and more, which usually give a more abundant harvest once every four years. Wild herbs area generally harvested between August and November. Another product is the production of willow branches, which is supplied as raw material to communities such as Tequisquiapan for crafts.|$|E
25|$|The Tequesta {{gathered}} many plant foods, including {{saw palmetto}} (Serenoa repens) berries, cocoplums (Chrysobalanus icaco), sea grapes (Coccoloba uvifera), prickly pear (<b>nopal)</b> fruits (Opuntia spp.), gopher apples (Licania micbauxii), pigeon plums (Cocoloba diversifolia), palm nuts, false mastic seeds, cabbage palm (Sabal palmetto), and hog plum (Ximenia americana). The roots of certain plants, such as Smilax spp. and coontie (Zamia integrifolia), were edible when ground into flour, processed to remove toxins (in {{the case of}} coontie), and made into a type of unleavened bread. (Archaeologists have commented, however, {{on the lack of}} evidence for coontie use in excavated sites.) Briton Hammond, the sole survivor of an English sloop that was attacked by Tequestas after grounding off Key Biscayne in 1748, reported that the Tequestas fed him boil'd corn.|$|E
25|$|The {{ecological}} system here {{is considered to}} be recently evolved with a number of endemic species. The lower elevations are dominated by desert and arid condition plants. This includes the world’s largest species of cactus, the cardón cactus, which can reach heights of 15m. Other plant species include mesquite, chironola, lechuguilla, <b>nopal</b> and barrel cactus, choyas, paloadan and pitahaya. The higher elevations have forests of pine and holm oak with some deciduous forests, with leaves falling in the dry season, generally no taller than fifteen meters. Wildlife in the desert areas is restricted to birds, reptiles and small to medium mammals such as rabbits and coyotes. Upper elevations with more vegetation can have wild rams, pumas, other wild cats, raccoons, deer, foxes and wild cats. Marine species include whales, seals, dolphins, gray whales, manta rays and sea turtles.|$|E
25|$|A <b>nopal</b> cactus {{farm for}} the {{production}} of cochineal is traditionally known as a nopalry. The two methods of farming cochineal are traditional and controlled. Cochineals are farmed in the traditional method by planting infected cactus pads or infesting existing cacti with cochineals and harvesting the insects by hand. The controlled method uses small baskets called Zapotec nests placed on host cacti. The baskets contain clean, fertile females that leave the nests and settle on the cactus to await fertilization by the males. In both cases, the cochineals must be protected from predation, cold, and rain. The complete cycle lasts three months, during which time the cacti are kept at a constant temperature of 27°C (81°F). At the end of the cycle, the new cochineals are left to reproduce or are collected and dried for dye production.|$|E
25|$|The {{building}} {{consists of}} a single large nave mostly constructed of metal. Inside, {{there are a number}} of narrow aisles containing stalls owned or rented by individual merchants. Most merchants are grouped by the type of merchandise they sell, such as party supplies, dishes, and pets. What little parking lot is left is filled by street vendors. On Saturday, when the market is busiest, these vendors overflow from the parking lot onto the surrounding narrow streets. These and various trucks and other vehicles block traffic, effectively closing the streets. The scene is noisy, filled with shouts of vendors and music blaring from stands selling CDs. However, this is also the time to find the widest variety of merchandise, such as <b>nopal</b> cactus and fresh corn from Milpa Alta, flower pots and soil from Xochimilco, and medicinal herbs from Puebla, Morelos and the State of Mexico.|$|E
25|$|Guanajuato has {{the fourth}} lowest {{number of people}} who can speak an {{indigenous}} language. However, the ethnically indigenous population is about 10,347 (2005) or 2.6% of the population over the age of five. The languages spoken are Chichimeca Jonaz, Otomi and Nahuatl. The two most important indigenous groups are the Chichimeca Jonaz and the Otomi, both of which are concentrated in the Valles de Sur area. Culturally, both groups show significant Purépecha influence. Both live in arid regions, where rainfall is precious and the diet includes foods such as pitayas, Myrtillocactus geometrizans (garambullo), cactus pear, <b>nopal</b> and agave. Hunting was an important source of protein but the scarcity of game has all but extinguished this practice. Subsistence agriculture forms the basis of the economy and provides much of the current diet. However, these peoples are extremely poor, and many migrate to other places to find work.|$|E
25|$|Most of the San Pedro {{municipality}} {{is dedicated}} to agriculture, much of which is irrigated and represents most of the irrigated farmland in the Cholula area. Agriculture employs about 30% {{of the population of}} San Andrés, while it employs 17.4% of the population of San Pedro. Principal crops include corn, beans, alfalfa, animal feed, <b>nopal</b> cactus, onions, cilantro, radishes, cauliflower, cabbage, lettuce and cucumbers. There are also various fruits such as pears, plums, apricots, peaches, apples and capulins. There is also extensive floriculture. Livestock includes cattle, goats, pigs, and domestic fowl. In the San Andrés area, much of the livestock is produced for autoconsumption. There are small areas of pasture and some forest on the Tecajetes Mountain, with pine, oyamel and white cedar. Its production is second in important in the Valley of Puebla. Fishing is limited to a small pond called Zerezotla, which is stocked with carp and catfish.|$|E
25|$|The main plaza has a 1950s era kiosk and {{contains}} two small stores in its base selling regional candies. The upper portion has a jukebox. The plaza also contains monuments to Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla and Benito Juárez {{as well as}} a ring from a Mesoamerican ball court of the 13th century. The pavement of the plaza was replaced in 1999 from paving stone to patterned concrete. In 2003, a hemicycle dedicated to Benito Juárez was added. While it {{is considered to be a}} park, the plaza is often filled with stands on market days and during festivals, but most cultural events take place at the esplanade of the municipal palace. The green areas of the plaza contain sculptures of lions made of iron, but unlike real lions, these are shown with <b>nopal</b> plants, with a boa constrictor and other poses and were donated by the former owners of the Hacienda of Chapingo. For this reason the plaza is also called the Jardin de Leones (Lion Garden).|$|E
25|$|San Pedro's {{traditional}} {{economic activity}} is agriculture and {{the raising of}} livestock. Most farming is irrigated and San Pedro has most of the irrigated farmland in the Cholula area. The main economic activities of the city are still commerce and agriculture. Its production is second in importance in the Valley of Puebla. However, the economy is shifting away from agriculture towards small industry, with only 17.4% of the population employed in this area. Residential areas are taking up more land as well. Principle crops include corn, beans, alfalfa, <b>nopal</b> cactus, onions, cilantro, radishes, cauliflower, cabbage, lettuce and cucumbers. There are also various fruits such as pears, plums, apricots, peaches, apples and capulin. There is also extensive floriculture. Livestock includes cattle, goats and pigs.

25|$|The Aztecs {{were one}} of the last of the Nahuatl-speaking peoples who {{migrated}} to this part of the Valley of Mexico {{after the fall of the}} Toltec Empire. Their presence was resisted by the peoples who were already there, but the Aztecs were able to establish a city on a small island on the western side of Lake Texcoco. The Aztecs themselves had a story about how their city was founded after being led to the island by their principal god, Huitzilopochtli. According to the story, the god indicated their new home with a sign, an eagle perched on a <b>nopal</b> cactus with a snake in its beak. This image appears in Codex Mendoza, an early post-conquest manuscript, one of many Aztec codices, pictorial texts, and since Mexico's independence from Spain in 1821, the image is in the center of the Mexican flag. Between 1325 and 1521, Tenochtitlan grew in size and strength, eventually dominating the other city-states or altepetl around Lake Texcoco, and in the Valley of Mexico. When the Spaniards arrived, the Aztec Empire reached much of Mesoamerica, touching both the Gulf of Mexico and the Pacific Ocean.|$|E
25|$|The {{rest of the}} {{municipality}} is basically flat, {{with a number of}} small ponds and lakes such as Santa Elena, San Clemente, Hierbabuena, La Soledad, El Toril, Los Árboles, San Jacinto, Cuendo, La Redonda, La Gorupa and Pasteje. There are also fresh water springs such as Las Fuentes, which supplies the municipal seat with its potable water. In areas without springs or ponds, there are wells, the largest of which is called Mavaro at the Lic. Andres Molina Enriquez Technical School. The climate is classified as temperate and semi humid with rains in the summer. The average annual temperature is 13.2°C, with high reaching about 31°C and lows to 4°C. There can be frosts in late December and early January with the occasional snow, especially on the volcano. Tree species in the area include pine, oyamel, holm oak, cedar, eucalyptus and willow, but most trees are located on the volcano. The valley area is mostly farmland with some areas of grass, <b>nopal</b> cactus and other arid area plants. There are a large number of wild herbs, many of which are used for cooking and medicine. Most flowers in the area are cultivated. Wildlife includes rabbits, coyotes, bobcats, skunks, opossum, armadillos, squirrels, bats and foxes. Bodies of water often contains carp.|$|E
25|$|The Feria Nacional del Dulce Cristalizado (National Crystallized Candy Fair) {{takes place}} {{each year in}} the Santa Cruz Acalpixca {{community}} at the Plaza Civica. This fair is dedicated to a traditional sweet of various fruits and sometimes plants, which are conserved in a sugar solution until they crystallize. These include squash, pineapple, <b>nopal</b> cactus, tomatoes, chili peppers, figs and more. These traditional sweets are often sold alongside others such as coconut confections, palanquetas de cacahuate (similar to peanut brittle), and nuez con leche (a nut-milk confection). These candies are the result of a blending of pre-Hispanic and European sweet traditions. The main European contributions are sugar and milk products, which are often mixed with native or other introduced ingredients. Originally, fruits and other foods were crystallized this way for conservation. Many in the community of Santa Cruz Acalpixca specialize in the making of {{one or more of these}} sweets, which began in 1927 with two shops belonging to Santiago Ramírez Olvera and Aurelio Mendoza in the Tepetitla neighborhood. In the 1980s, the town decided to hold an annual fair to promote their products, which originally was held in conjunction with the festival to the local patron saint. The event includes prizes for the best confections in several categories and the introduction of new types of candies.|$|E
25|$|Climates in {{the state}} are grouped by {{precipitation}} and average temperatures into three major groups. The semi-arid climate {{is characterized by the}} fact that evaporation often exceeds precipitation. Most of the vegetation in these areas is arid grassland with desert plants such as <b>nopal.</b> These climates cover about forty percent of the state, mostly in the north. Semi-arid temperate regions are found in the municipalities of San Felipe, San Diego de la Unión, San Luis de la Paz, part of Dolores Hidalgo and San José de Iturbide, where precipitation varies between 400 and 500mm and the average temperature is between 16 and 18°C.
