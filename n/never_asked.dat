5|$|Bevin {{said that}} in 2011, Mitch McConnell {{recruited}} him to challenge incumbent Democrat John Yarmuth to represent Kentucky's 3rd congressional district in 2012. McConnell's chief of staff said Bevin requested the meeting and McConnell <b>never</b> <b>asked</b> Bevin to enter the race. Ultimately, Bevin and his advisors decided that legislative redistricting had made Yarmuth's district unwinnable for a Republican, and Bevin chose not to run.|$|E
5|$|Bertie's and Lionel's {{relationship}} {{comes to}} be known to the King's advisors when there are preparations for his coronation in Westminster Abbey. It comes to light that George <b>never</b> <b>asked</b> for advice from his advisors about his speech defect treatment and that Lionel never had formal training to be a medical doctor. Lionel explained {{that at the time}} he started with speech defects there was no formal training and that the only known help that was available for returning Great War shell-shocked Australian soldiers was from personal experience.|$|E
5|$|In an {{interview}} with Aphrodite Jones, Patrick Treacy, a cosmetic surgeon who treated Jackson between July 2006 and early 2007, as well as shortly before his death, stated {{that he would have}} known if Jackson would have been also treated by another physician and that he never saw any drugs in the house. He also said that Jackson did not have insomnia and <b>never</b> <b>asked</b> him for narcotics. Treacy stated Jackson was in good physical health; he said Jackson always insisted on the presence of an anesthetist when Propofol was administered.|$|E

5|$|Adam (Peter Krause) is {{stressed}} {{about work}} because his boss Gordon (William Baldwin) feels {{he is too}} distracted by family issues. Sarah (Lauren Graham), frustrated with her children for losing their shoes, off-handedly remarks to Adam about her desire for a LoJack to help locate missing shoes. Put on the spot for new ideas at work, Adam pitches the LoJack idea and Gordon loves it, insisting Adam start developing it. When Sarah learns this later she is excited, but feels upset she is not given credit. When Zeek (Craig T. Nelson) encouraged her {{to stand up for}} herself, Sarah confronts Adam, but claims he has made many sacrifices for Sarah in the past and <b>never</b> <b>asked</b> for anything in return. Later, however, Adam tells Gordon it was Sarah's idea. That night, Adam apologizes to Sarah and offers her an internship at the company's design department, which she happily accepts.|$|E
5|$|Prior to Jefferson's presidency, the United States {{had paid}} tribute {{to a number of}} Arab states in the Mediterranean to prevent attacks on its shipping. By the time Jefferson assumed office, the United States Navy had been {{developed}} {{to the point where it}} might adequately defend American shipping interests. Jefferson consequently refused to pay tribute in 1801 to Yusuf Karamanli, the ruler of Tripoli, after which the Tripolitans began attacking and seizing American merchant vessels. In a cabinet discussion held in early 1801 to formulate a response, it was suggested that the President declare war on Tripoli. Lincoln pointed out that only Congress had the authority to declare war, but the rest of the cabinet was intent on taking some sort of action. The matter was tabled until May 1801, when the cabinet voted to send a naval squadron to the area to defend the country's merchant interests. Jefferson <b>never</b> <b>asked</b> for or received from Congress a formal war declaration against the Barbary states.|$|E

The publishers <b>never</b> <b>asked</b> him to make more, and due to problems with receiving the payment, he did not care.|$|E

DiMaggio, Hank Greenberg, and Ted Williams, {{who had just}} retired, had been paid over $100,000 in a season, and Ruth had a peak salary of $80,000. Mantle became the highest-paid active player of his time. Mantle's top salary was $100,000, which {{he reached for the}} 1963 season.

25|$|Apple has {{publicly}} asserted that NBC would only renew their contract if Apple {{agreed to a}} price increase of US$4.99 per episode, which they did not. NBC disputes that claim, claiming that Apple balked at NBC's request to package shows together and make wholesale pricing more flexible. NBC claims that they <b>never</b> <b>asked</b> to double the wholesale price and insisted that their shows would be sold by iTunes Store through early December. Other networks who sell their shows via iTunes did not follow suit. On December 1, 2007, NBC shows were pulled from iTunes Store.|$|E
25|$|At {{the onset}} of puberty, Chikatilo {{discovered}} that he suffered from chronic impotence, worsening his social awkwardness and self-hatred.

The same year, Chikatilo jumped upon an 11-year-old friend of his younger sister and wrestled her to the ground, ejaculating as the girl struggled in his grasp.|$|E

25|$|Danger Mouse created The Grey Album as an {{experimental}} project intended {{for a limited}} 3,000-copy release in February 2004. While Danger Mouse <b>never</b> <b>asked</b> {{permission to use the}} Beatles' material, Jay-Z's a cappella recordings, though copyrighted, were released commercially for the purpose of encouraging mashups and remixes. A buzz around the album resulted in wider Internet distribution and media attention garnering a glowing review in the February 9, 2004 issue of The New Yorker. The Grey Album was named the best album of 2004 by Entertainment Weekly and ranked #10 in The Village Voice's annual Pazz and Jop critics poll.|$|E
25|$|A {{few days}} after Comey's dismissal, the FBI {{reportedly}} widened its investigation to examine whether President Trump attempted to obstruct justice. Many FBI insiders believed the real reason Comey was fired was because he had refused to end the investigation into Russian connections to the election. In his June testimony Comey said that Trump <b>never</b> <b>asked</b> him to stop the Russia investigation. The special counsel's office took over the investigation. ABC News later clarified that the special counsel is gathering preliminary information about possible obstruction of justice, but a full-scale investigation {{has not yet been}} launched.|$|E
25|$|Tokyo Global Engineering Corporation is an education-services {{organization}} that provides capstone education programs {{free of charge}} to engineering students and other stakeholders.

25|$|After Paramount {{purchased}} {{the rights to}} the novella for Wilder, the next step was a screenplay. The material was widely regarded around Hollywood as unfilmable due to its iniquitous characters and the restrictions imposed by the Motion Picture Production Code. Although he had worked on the treatment, Charles Brackett decided it was too sordid and bowed out of the project, leaving Wilder to find another collaborator. His first choice, James M. Cain himself, was already working for another studio and unavailable (although Cain claimed he was <b>never</b> <b>asked).</b> Producer Joseph Sistrom, an avid reader and an admirer of The Big Sleep, then suggested Raymond Chandler.|$|E
25|$|The other janitor, Shawna Ornt, who {{witnessed}} the two men fleeing the parking lot eventually testified under oath that she had told the prosecutor that the man she saw {{the night of the}} murder was not Ferguson. She claims Crane repeatedly tried to get her to implicate him and that he became threatening during his last conversation with her. Despite being the sole witness who reported that she could identify the men at the scene, Shawna Ornt was <b>never</b> <b>asked</b> in court if she could identify Ferguson. Zellner alleged that the prosecution did not ask her to identify Ferguson because they knew her answer would hurt their case.|$|E

A political rival, Alexander Lowther, would replace Oates as regimental commander in July 1864 after allegedly engineering Oates' removal from command. It was Oates, however, who led the 15th Alabama into its most noted engagement of the war, at Little Round Top on July 2, 1863, during {{the second day of the}} Battle of Gettysburg.|$|E
