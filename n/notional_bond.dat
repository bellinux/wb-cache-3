50|$|At its launch OMF {{exchange}} members {{included the}} large European, Japanese and American banks which also traded the <b>notional</b> <b>bond</b> contract on the MATIF. Market makers on the EFX 50 future contracts included SocGen and BNP. OMF also provided clearing of the contracts and {{acted as a}} clearing house. It was granted a bank charter by the Bank of France. OMF was thus able to guarantee the trades. In July 1988, OMF was acquired by a consortium of French banks. OMF was later merged into MATIF SA which launched the CAC 40 futures contract.|$|E
50|$|Euronext Paris calculates {{a family}} of indices. The CAC 40 is the exchange's benchmark, desseminated in real time. Its {{components}} {{are included in the}} broader SBF 120 Index, a benchmark for investment funds. The SBF 250 index, a benchmark for the long-term performance of equity portfolios, includes all of the SBF 120; it is structured by sector. The MIDCAC index includes 100 of the most liquid medium-size stocks on the Premier Marché and Nouveau Marché calculated on the basis of opening and closing prices, while the Second Marché index focuses on that market. Both indices are benchmarks for funds. The Nouveau Marché Index represents stocks in the growth market. The SBF-FCI index is based on a selection of convertible bonds that represent at least 70% of the total capitalization of this market, calculated twice daily. For derivatives, MONEP trades short-term and long-term stock options and futures and options on {{a family of}} Dow Jones indices. MATIF's products include commodity future and options on European rapeseed and futures on rapeseed meal, European rapeseed oil, milling wheat, corn and sunflower seeds; interest rate futures and options on the Euro <b>notional</b> <b>bond,</b> five-year Euro and three-month PIBOR (Paris Interbank Offered Rate), and futures on the 30-year Eurobond and two-year E-note, and index futures on the CAC 40.|$|E
50|$|A Luxembourg Depository Receipt (LDR) is a {{certificate}} {{which represents the}} purchase, or ownership, of foreign assets which are deposited in a Luxembourg-based account. An LDR functions {{in much the same}} way as a global depository receipt (GDR). LDRs may represent ownership of either an underlying number of shares or a <b>notional</b> amount of <b>bonds.</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{show that}} the price of a Treasury bond and an inflation-swapped TIPS issue exactly replicating the cash flows of the Treasury bond can differ by more than $ 20 per $ 100 <b>notional.</b> Treasury <b>bonds</b> are almost always overvalued {{relative}} to TIPS. Total TIPS–Treasury mispricing has exceeded $ 56 billion, representing nearly eight percent of the total amount of TIPS outstanding. TIPS–Treasury mispricing is strongly related to supply factors such as Treasury debt issuance and the availability of collateral in the financial markets, and is correlated with other types of fixed-income arbitrages, These results pose a major puzzle to classical asset pricing theory. In addition, they raise the issue of why the Treasury issues TIPS, since in so doing it both gives up a valuable fiscal hedging option and leaves large amounts of money on the table. ...|$|R
40|$|The options {{premiums}} {{are frequently}} {{used to obtain}} probability density functions (pdfs) for the prices of the underlying assets. When these assets are bank deposits or <b>notional</b> Government <b>bonds</b> {{it is possible to}} compute probability measures of future interest rates. Recently, in the literature there have been many papers presenting methods of how to estimate pdfs from options premiums. Nevertheless, as far as we know, the estimation of probabilities of forward interest rate functions is an issue that has not been analysed before. In this paper, we propose such a method, {{that can be used to}} study the evolution of the expectations about interest rate convergence. We look at the cases of Spain and Italy against Germany, before the adoption of a single currency, and conclude that the expectations on the short-term interest rates convergence of Spain and Italy vis-a-vis Germany had a somewhat different trajectory, with higher expectations of convergence for Spain. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this paper is to apply the True <b>Notional</b> <b>Bond</b> System (TNBS) {{proposed}} by Oviedo (2006) for the theoretical pricing of the Chicago Board of Trade Treasury-bond futures, one of the most traded derivatives in the world. This system is proposed as an alterna-tive to the current conversion factor system (CFS), whose imperfections are well known. In this paper, we price the CBOT T-bond futures as well as all its embedded delivery options under the CFS and the TNBS in a stochastic interest rate framework. Our pricing procedure is an adaptation of the Dynamic Programming algorithm described in Ben-Abdallah et al. (2007), giving the value of the futures contract under the TNBS as a function of time and current short-term interest rate. Numerical illustrations, provided under the Vacisek and CIR models, show that the TNBS reduces dramatically the value of all the delivery options embedded in the CBOT T-bond futures...|$|E
40|$|The {{conversion}} factor system (CFS) {{is used in}} the determination of the invoice price of the Chicago Board of Trade Treasury-bond futures. As an alternative to the CFS, Oviedo [Oviedo, R. A., 2006. Improving the design of Treasury-Bond futures contracts. The Journal of Business 79, 1293 - 1315] proposed the True <b>Notional</b> <b>Bond</b> System (TNBS), and showed that it outperforms the CFS when interest rates are deterministic. The main {{purpose of this paper is}} to compare the effectiveness of the two systems in a stochastic environment. In order to do so, we price the CBOT T-bond futures as well as all its embedded delivery options under both the CFS and the TNBS. Our pricing procedure is an adaptation of the Dynamic Programming algorithm described in Ben-Abdallah et al. [Ben-Abdallah, R., Ben-Ameur, H., Breton, M., 2007. Pricing CBOT Treasury Bond futures. Les Cahiers du GERAD G- 2006 - 77]. Numerical illustrations show that, in a stochastic framework, TNBS does not always outperform the CFS. However, as the long-term mean moves away from the level of the notional rate, the TNBS performs increasingly better than the CFS. Futures Asset pricing Dynamic programming Delivery options...|$|E
50|$|George Burley's {{first full}} season in charge brought little joy as Derby {{recorded}} a 20th-placed {{finish in the}} 2003-04 season, just 1 point clear of relegation with safety not confirmed until the penultimate {{game of the season}} with a 2-0 win over Millwall. With no money for players and the need to slash the club's wage bill, big names such as Fabrizio Ravanelli, Georgi Kinkladze and Craig Burley left the club with the gaps of their departure shored up by free signings; Candido Costa was taken on a season long loan whilst seven others - including Mathias Svensson and Leon Osman - were recruited on short term loans, as Derby used a club record 36 different players {{in the course of the}} season. There was also the continued introduction of academy players to the side, with Tom Huddlestone and Marcus Tudgay making significant contributions alongside players such as Lee Grant and Lee Holmes. Burley achieved safety against a background of boardroom uncertainty - Chairman Lionel Pickering, after putting temporary faith in former Coventry City chairman Bryan Richardson and a <b>notional</b> £30m <b>bond,</b> was removed from the chair after the club temporarily entered receivership by The Co-operative Bank, who instantly installed a new board composed of John Sleightholme, Jeremy Keith and Steve Harding, for the cost of £1 each.|$|R
