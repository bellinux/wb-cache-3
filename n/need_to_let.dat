He condemned the New Deal as socialist and attacked deficit spending, high farm subsidies, governmental bureaucracy, the National Labor Relations Board, and nationalized health insurance. However, he did not always follow conservative ideology; for instance, after investigating the lack of adequate housing in the nation, he supported public housing programs. He also supported federal aid {{to the states to}} fund public schools.|$|E

500|$|Age of Empires IIIs {{multiplayer}} was {{the first}} in the series to be integrated into the game interface and was highly lauded, as was the Home City concept. The topic of multiplayer was touched by GameZone, who said [...] "this game demands multiplayer mode, and Ensemble Studios provided this for the players," [...] while at 1UP, the reviewer commented similarly, stating, [...] "Multiplayer support has been significantly upgraded with a slick interface, support for clans {{and a number of other}} useful features." [...] GameSpy commented on the Home City as well, saying, [...] "the 'home city' system creates long-term depth and strategy." [...] EuroGamer, however, stated: [...] "Stop with the gifts!...You do not <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> me flick to a home city screen every few minutes so that I can select a free unit or resource windfall.

2500|$|On September 18, 2011, Netflix {{announced}} that it would split out and rebrand its DVD-by-mail service as Qwikster. CEO Reed Hastings justified the decision, stating that [...] "we realized that streaming and DVD by mail are becoming two quite different businesses, with very different cost structures, different benefits that need to be marketed differently, and we <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> each grow and operate independently." [...] It was also {{announced that}} the re-branded service would add video game rentals. The decision to split the services was widely criticized; it was noted that the two websites would have been autonomous from each other (with ratings, reviews, and queues not carrying over between them), and would have required separate user accounts. Additionally, the two websites would require separate subscriptions, meaning that a bundle of DVD-by-mail and streaming service now cost US$16 per-month rather than $10.|$|E

2500|$|The Maoist {{vision of}} modernity never [...] "enjoyed entire hegemony" [...] within the Party, {{and was always}} contested even {{at the height of}} Mao's power. Zhou Enlai's {{launching}} of the Four Modernizations in 1965 (and again 1975) are an example of this. When Mao died, the Four Modernizations replaced class struggle as the Party's key objective. This vision eventually led to the enfranchisement of the private market economy and the establishment of new institutions, and became Deng Xiaoping's [...] "socialism with Chinese characteristics". This in turn led to the adoption of alternative visions of modernity popular in the Western world. Ideological change led to factional strife, with many leading members of the party calling for a return to the classical socialist model of development. From the outside world these changes may seem odd: a society which looks more capitalist by the day is still ruled by a Party that claims [...] "fidelity to socialism". However, there is [...] "less understanding of how this looks from within". A break with the basic tenets of Maoist thought came in the 1990s, when Jiang Zemin talked of the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> private entrepreneurs join the Party. This decision had a stronger connection to realpolitik then to ideological conviction. By the 16th National Congress, the private sector {{was one of the most}} dominant forces in society, a constituency the party could not ignore if it wished to hold on to power.|$|E

60|$|But I {{have said}} {{enough to show}} {{that the time has come}} when novelists, if they do not wish to be left behind in the race, must adapt {{themselves}} to modern conditions. One does not wish to threaten, but, as I say, we astigmatics are in a large minority and can, if we get together, make our presence felt. Roused by this article to a sense of the injustice of their treatment, the great army of glass-wearing citizens could very easily make novelists see reason. A boycott of non-spectacled heroes would soon achieve the necessary reform. Perhaps there will be no <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> matters go as far as that. I hope not. But, if this warning should be neglected, if we have any more of these novels about men with keen gray eyes or snapping black eyes or cheerful blue eyes--any sort of eyes, in fact, lacking some muscular affliction, we shall know what to do.|$|E

60|$|We {{had decided}} to visit London, where the season, or winter, would soon commence. The {{necessary}} arrangements were made, and we sent round our cards of p.p.c. and obtained passports. On the very day we were to quit Paris, an American friend wrote me a note {{to say that a}} young connexion of his was desirous of going to London, and begged a place for her in my carriage. It is, I believe, a peculiar and a respectable trait in the national character, that we so seldom hesitate about asking, or acceding to, favours of this sort. Whenever woman is concerned, our own sex yield, and usually without murmuring. At all events, it was so with W----, who cheerfully gave up his seat in the carriage to Miss ----, in order to take one in the coupé of the diligence. The notice was so short, and the hour so late, that {{there was no time to}} get a passport for him, and, as he was included in mine, I was compelled to run the risk of sending him to the frontiers without one. I was a consul at the time,--a titular one as to duties, but in reality as much of a consul as if I had ever visited my consulate.[34] The only official paper I possessed, in connexion with the office, the commission and exequatur excepted, was a letter from the Préfet of the Rhône, acknowledging the receipt of the latter. As this was strictly a French document, I gave it to W---- as proof of my identity, accompanied by a brief statement of the reasons why he was without a passport, begging the authorities at <b>Need</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> him pass as far as the frontier, where I should be in season to prove his character. This statement I signed as consul, instructing W---- to show it, if applied to for a passport; and if the gendarmes disavowed me, to show the letter, by way of proving who I was. The expedient was clumsy enough, but it was the best that offered.|$|E
