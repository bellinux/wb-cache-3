Only when the <b>industrial</b> <b>sectors</b> in these areas develop, the demand for human capital increases, and the gains from human capital increase, do residents have the desire to invest more in human capital.

30|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a new perspective}} {{that there is a}} double-threshold effect in terms of the technology gap existing in the foreign direct investment (FDI) technology spillover process in different regional Chinese <b>industrial</b> <b>sectors.</b> In this paper, a double-threshold regression model was established to examine the relation between the threshold effect of the technology gap and technology spillover. Based on the provincial panel data of Chinese <b>industrial</b> <b>sectors</b> from 2000 to 2011, the empirical results reveal that there are two threshold values, which are 1.254 and 2.163, in terms of the technology gap in the <b>industrial</b> <b>sector</b> in eastern China. There are also two threshold values in both the central and western <b>industrial</b> <b>sector,</b> which are 1.516, 2.694 and 1.635, 2.714, respectively. The technology spillover is a decreasing function of the technology gap in both the eastern and western <b>industrial</b> <b>sectors,</b> but a concave curve function of the technology gap is in the central <b>industrial</b> <b>sectors.</b> Furthermore, the FDI technology spillover has increased gradually in recent years. Based on the empirical results, suggestions were proposed to elucidate the introduction of the FDI and the improvement in the industrial added value in different regions of China.|$|R
50|$|Observe point Y, {{somewhere to}} the left of P on the graph. If a section of the {{redundant}} agricultural labor force (PQ) is removed from the total agricultural labor force (OP) and absorbed into the <b>industrial</b> <b>sector,</b> then the labor force remaining in the <b>industrial</b> <b>sector</b> is represented by the point Y. Now, the output produced by the remaining labor force is represented by YZ and the real income of this labor force is given by XY. The difference of the two terms yields the total agricultural surplus of the economy. It is important to understand that this surplus is produced by the reallocation of labor such that it is absorbed by the <b>industrial</b> <b>sector.</b> This can be seen as deployment of hidden rural savings for the expansion of the <b>industrial</b> <b>sector.</b> Hence, we can understand the contribution of the agricultural sector to the expansion of <b>industrial</b> <b>sector</b> by this allocation of redundant labor force and the agricultural surplus that results from it.|$|R
