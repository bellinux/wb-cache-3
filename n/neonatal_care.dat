40|$|<b>Neonatal</b> {{intensive}} <b>care</b> unit {{survival rates}} have improved significantly {{over the past}} decade. This improvement primarily reflects declining mortality rates among preterm infants. Neurologic morbidity increases with prematurity and is the major predictor of long-term disability. Accordingly, concern has been expressed that the burden of neurologic dysfunction among contemporary <b>neonatal</b> intensive <b>care</b> unit survivors may be increasing. To define the trends of neurologic disorders in the contemporary <b>neonatal</b> intensive <b>care</b> unit, all 4164 admissions between 1986 and 1995 to a tertiary <b>neonatal</b> intensive <b>care</b> unit were examined. <b>Neonatal</b> intensive <b>care</b> unit admissions (413 &plusmn; 49 per year), proportion of births at less than 37 weeks (70 &plusmn; 3 % per year), and referral patterns were stable between 1986 and 1995.

40|$|Aims and objectives: To {{systematically}} {{review the}} experience of fathers of preterm infants hospitalised in the <b>Neonatal</b> Intensive <b>Care</b> Unit. Background: Family-centred care {{is more and more}} acknowledged in <b>Neonatal</b> Intensive <b>Care</b> Units, advocating for active engagement of both parents in the care journey. Nonetheless, fathers' <b>Neonatal</b> Intensive <b>Care</b> Unit experience has received limited research attention. Design: Systematic review of qualitative studies. Methods: Four electronic databases (CINHAL, ISI Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus) were explored and studies published between 2000 – 2014 were included. Preferred Reporting Item for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) and Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Critical Appraisal Tool for Qualitative Studies guidelines were adopted. Key themes were extracted and synthesised. Results: Five main themes resuming fathers' experience of preterm birth and <b>Neonatal</b> Intensive <b>Care</b> Unit stay were identified from 14 studies. Themes were: emotional roller-coaster, paternal needs, coping strategies, self-representation and caregiving engagement. These dimensions were found to be dynamically shaped across three critical turning points: preterm birth, <b>Neonatal</b> Intensive <b>Care</b> Unit stay and at home. Conclusions: <b>Neonatal</b> Intensive <b>Care</b> Unit fathers of preterm infants experience ambivalence, a set of different needs and coping strategies. They modify their self-representations along the <b>Neonatal</b> Intensive <b>Care</b> Unit journey and needs specific nursing support and intervention to sustain caregiving engagement and transition to parenthood.

In New York, after attending a conference on abortion at Barnard College in 1970, she focused on reproductive rights of women and became an advocate for women's reproductive rights, campaigning for change at a policy level. In 1970, Rodriguez-Trias was a founding member of Committee to End Sterilization Abuse and in 1971, {{a founding member of the}} Women's Caucus of the American Public Health Association. Rodriguez-Trias supported abortion rights, fought for the abolishment of enforced sterilization, and sought that <b>neonatal</b> <b>care</b> to underserved people be provided. In 1979, Rodriguez-Trias became a founding member of the Committee for Abortion Rights and Against Sterilization Abuse and testified before the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare for passage of federal sterilization guidelines. The guidelines, which she drafted, require a woman's written consent to sterilization, offered in a language they can understand, and set a waiting period between the consent and the sterilization procedure. She is credited with helping to expand the range of public health services for women and children in minority and low-income populations in the United States, Central and South America, Africa, Asia, and the Middle East.|$|E

40|$|AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To {{explore the}} nurses' views {{of their role}} both in the <b>neonatal</b> {{intensive}} <b>care</b> unit and {{in the provision of}} interacting with, and emotionally supporting, families. BACKGROUND: The <b>neonatal</b> intensive <b>care</b> nurse has a large and complex clinical role and also a role of emotional supporter for parents in the <b>neonatal</b> intensive <b>care</b> unit. Identifying components of their role and recognising the elements within the nursery that obstruct or encourage this role can allow for modification of nurse education and peer support. DESIGN: Qualitative study based on semistructured interviews. METHODS: Nine neonatal nurses from a single <b>neonatal</b> intensive <b>care</b> unit were interviewed and the data analysed thematically using nvivo version 10. RESULTS: Participants viewed their role as an enjoyable yet difficult one, requiring seniority, training and experience. They provided support to parents by communicating, listening, providing individualised support and by encouraging parental involvement with their baby. Constructive elements that contributed to the provision of support included a positive <b>neonatal</b> intensive <b>care</b> unit environment and providing a parent support group. More obstructive elements were a lack of physical <b>neonatal</b> intensive <b>care</b> unit space, little time available for nurse-to-parent conversation and language and cultural barriers between nurses and parents. CONCLUSION: The role of the neonatal nurse in providing emotional support is complex and requires a high level of ongoing support and education for staff, and minimisation of physical and staff-related obstructions. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: The modern <b>neonatal</b> intensive <b>care</b> unit offers complex medical and nursing services and with this care comes higher needs from both babies and their parents. <b>Neonatal</b> intensive <b>care</b> unit nurses should be supported in their roles by having peer support available in the <b>neonatal</b> intensive <b>care</b> unit and education and training in emotional support and counselling skills. The nursing staff also require a comfortable and practical physical working space in which to assist parents to be with their baby. Melanie Turner, Anna Chur-Hansen and Helen Winefiel...|$|R

The organization has also voiced concerns about <b>neonatal</b> <b>care</b> post-crisis as many women who delivered their babies in hospitals during the crisis were sent home as early as 30 minutes after giving birth. The World Health Organization warns of the risk of an outbreak of epidemic disease due to unrecovered bodies, many severely decomposed, and due to the sewage flowing in Beit Hanoun and Beit Lahya. With the help of the Unicef, two therapy centers are working at full capacity to provide services for 120 malnutritioned, a medical condition of inadequate diet, children per day. Injured patients needing referral outside Gaza for specialized care were evacuated exclusively through the Egyptian Rafah border crossing. Gaza Ministry of Health reported that between 29 December and 22 January 608 injured were evacuated through Rafah.

The project was organized into three phases of activity: I. Development, implementation {{and analysis of the}} needs assessment questionnaire, II. Development of the curriculum, and Ill. Validation of the curriculum. A survey was conducted by the Investigator to determine the needs of potential learners in the new field of <b>neonatal</b> respiratory <b>care.</b> The curriculum guide was validated by subjecting it to scrutiny by established leaders in the <b>neonatal</b> respiratory <b>care</b> field. The results of the needs assessment, a literature review, and the validation process were utilized in the development and refinement of the curriculum guide. In the developmental process, the job description and responsibilities of a neonatal respiratory therapist were delineated, an overall format was evolved and one topic, "Neonatal Airway Management", was chosen to be presented in detail {{on the basis of its}} importance in <b>neonatal</b> respiratory <b>care.</b> After validation, the curriculum guide was refined to reflect modifications and improvements suggested by the validators. Based on analysis of the data, the following conclusions were reached: 1. There is a definite need for the development of a <b>neonatal</b> respiratory <b>care</b> curriculum guide for instruction at community colleges in Southern California. 2. The overall reaction to the guide by the <b>neonatal</b> respiratory <b>care</b> experts was positive. A comprehensive teaching guide of this type had never been developed before. The experts validated its appropriateness and usefulness. Recommendations made by the Investigator included a plan to coordinate efforts among Southern California community colleges to develop an effective <b>neonatal</b> respiratory <b>care</b> curriculum that could be utilized by two-year respiratory therapy schools at California community colleges...|$|R
