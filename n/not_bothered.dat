Upon returning to town, he stopped by his former residence, Wildwind, only to find that the place was empty. Brooke explained that after its last occupant, Caleb Cortlandt, had moved out, Sam and Maddie, Edmund's children, had <b>not</b> <b>bothered</b> to rent the mansion out again.

25|$|The rumor {{once again}} spread in October 1998, {{when a new}} fax, this time {{claiming}} to originate with a Drug Abuse Resistance Education (DARE) officer in Texas. The rumor spread further when officials in the San Diego government circulated the fax among city agencies; {{this version of the}} fax, though quickly dismissed within city government when {{it was found that the}} Sheriff's office had no real connection to it, now appeared to be a legitimate government-issued document. Also in the fall of 1998, the Sheriff's office of Nassau County, Florida sent a warning about such gang initiation to the county fire department, who subsequently spread the fax to all county agencies. Police dispatcher Ann Johnson had thought the message urgent enough to send, but had <b>not</b> <b>bothered</b> to check its legitimacy.|$|E
25|$|Acting {{as if he}} is <b>not</b> <b>bothered</b> by Dr. Lee exiling him, Devon {{contacts}} A's rival school Morris Brown College, {{to discuss}} playing for their marching band next season. Mr. Wade, Brown's band leader, says that Devon does not {{need to know how to}} read music and will likely get a full scholarship and a good position on the drumline. When Wade wants to know what Dr. Lee is planning for the BET Big Southern Classic (a large competition of college bands), Devon realizes that his heart and honor are still with the A band. He rejects the scholarship offer from the rival band and returns to A Though Devon is still not playing for the band, he cannot give up his drumming. He is sent cassette tapes from his estranged father and gets some ideas for new drum arrangements. He and Sean have a final confrontation, with Sean telling Devon that he is A's best drummer but that the band is bigger than just one person; this clears the air and they begin to work together. The two present their idea for an entrance cadence to Dr. Lee who decides they will be used during the Classic. Devon helps the drumline prepare and patches up his relationship with Laila. Lee also tells Devon that he can guarantee him a full return to the band next year.|$|E

[...] Shiban was inspired by the film The Men and realizing that the main character, who had been injured in war and lost his legs, wanted to walk more than anything. He stated that the paranormal concept of astral projection [...] "just sort of fit". Some members of the writing staff were concerned about killing Callahan's young son, Trevor, but Shiban was <b>not</b> <b>bothered</b> by it and felt that Rappo wanted to take everything from Callahan, and the worst blow would be to kill his son.|$|E
500|$|The {{financial}} security and social prosperity that the Vonneguts once enjoyed were destroyed {{in a matter}} of years. The Liebers's brewery was closed in 1921 after the advent of Prohibition in the United States. When the Great Depression hit, few people could afford to build, causing clients at Kurt Sr.'s architectural firm to become scarce. Vonnegut's brother and sister had finished their primary and secondary educations in private schools, but Vonnegut was placed in a public school, called Public School No. 43, now known as the James Whitcomb Riley School. He was <b>not</b> <b>bothered</b> by this, but both his parents were affected deeply by their economic misfortune. His father withdrew from normal life and became what Vonnegut called a [...] "dreamy artist". His mother became depressed, withdrawn, bitter, and abusive. She labored to regain the family's wealth and status, and Vonnegut said she expressed hatred [...] "as corrosive as hydrochloric acid" [...] for her husband. Edith Vonnegut forayed into writing and tried to sell short stories to magazines like Collier's and The Saturday Evening Post with no success.|$|E
500|$|Thomas {{liked the}} visuals, {{saying that the}} game was capable of {{conveying}} characters' moods instantly despite being limited to only a few frames of animation, and that the backgrounds were nice and fitting in well with the ones from returning locations; he did however dislike how {{a lot of the}} artwork was reused from previous Ace Attorney games. Cole and Moriarty were <b>not</b> <b>bothered</b> by the limited character sprites and animation or static backgrounds; Cole called the character designs [...] "memorable and hilariously animated", while Moriarty, who liked both, said that the characters looked [...] "awesome". Thomas called the game's music outstanding, saying that the intense music that plays at high-stakes moments during trials, as well as the character themes, all fit well. Cole said that the courtroom and character themes were memorable and fitting; he called them improvements over their counterparts in Justice for All, and [...] "at least on par with" [...] those in Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney. Moriarty said that the music [...] "set the mood perfectly" [...] for each scene.|$|E

500|$|Li Xianhui was a {{daughter}} of the Emperor Zhongzong of Tang and Empress Wei. She was probably killed {{at the age of}} 19 by her grandmother Wu Zetian, along with her husband. [...] After Wu Zetian's death, when her father again came to the throne, she was reburied in a grand tomb in the Qianling Mausoleum in 705. [...] Her tomb was discovered in 1960, and excavated from 1964. [...] It had been robbed in the past, probably soon after the burial, and items in precious materials taken, but the thieves had <b>not</b> <b>bothered</b> with the over 800 pottery tomb figures, and the extensive frescos were untouched. [...] The robbers had left in a hurry, leaving silver items scattered around, and the corpse of one of their number. [...] The tomb had a flattened pyramid rising 12 metres above ground, and a long sloping entrance tunnel lined with frescos, leading to an ante-chamber and the tomb chamber itself, 12 metres below ground level with a high domed roof. [...] Most of the contents, including the frescos, are now in the Shaanxi History Museum.|$|E

500|$|Some {{commentators}} {{were less}} {{enthusiastic about the}} episode than the general consensus. Although Josh Wigler of MTV declared [...] "TS-19" [...] a [...] "compelling hour", he professed that it was lacking for a season finale. [...] "While there was a massive fireball and a decent amount of zombie action," [...] explained Wigler, [...] "not to mention some concrete information regarding the outbreak, there are still several plot threads that haven't come close to resolution." [...] Vanity Fair Mike Ryan argued that {{in contrast to a}} [...] "great season", the episode was a mediocre conclusion to The Walking Dead first season, writing that [...] "this might have been the silliest hour of television that I've ever watched". Leonard Pierce of The A.V. Club issued [...] "TS-19" [...] a B– grade: despite proclaiming that [...] "there was some good stuff" [...] in the episode, Pierce opined that it fell below his expectations. He denounced many scenes in the episode—notably the explosion sequence—as he felt it was a waste of cinematography. [...] "The fact that almost all the scenes played out in dark, closed quarters wasted The Walking Dead gorgeous cinematography; the pacing was again off beat, with far too much padded scenes of people looking at one another in shock; and, though I'm usually <b>not</b> <b>bothered</b> by plot contrivances, there's no way anyone in a vehicle that close to such a huge explosion would have lived through it." [...] Writing for Cinema Blend, Nick Venable said that it was an interesting episode, although it could have been executed in a better manner.|$|E
