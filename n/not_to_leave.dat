5|$|A {{significant}} number of non-Jewish Poles also did not trust the Germans and decided <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> the city. Many wounded Home Army soldiers became stranded during the uprising and were simply not able to evacuate in time. For others, the choice to remain resulted from feelings of despair and hopelessness brought {{by the fall of}} the uprising; at least initially, they simply did not have the motivation to leave.|$|E

Mayil, believing that Sathyajith is the man for her, falls in love with him, to the point of refusing an opportunity to attend a teacher-training course in Madras to remain with him. Despite loving Sathyajith, she does not allow him to exploit her sexually, which disappoints him. Never intending a serious relationship with Mayil, he proceeds to his native place to get married to another woman. When Mayil begs Sathyajith <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> her, he says he befriended her for pleasure—not marriage.|$|E

5|$|Cynthia {{knew her}} husband took drugs like Preludin, and {{regularly}} smoked cannabis but {{thought of them}} as not being very dangerous. On 27 March 1965, {{at a dinner party}} given by a dentist, John Riley, the Lennons, Harrison, and Boyd were given LSD without their knowledge. Although told <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> the house, Harrison drove them to various nightclubs, with Riley following them by taxi. At the Ad Lib club, they thought the lift up to the club was on fire and started screaming, before finally crawling out of the lift for which Mick Jagger, Marianne Faithfull, and Starr were waiting. Harrison later drove them back home in Boyd's Mini Cooper at no more than 10mph, as he was also feeling the effects of the drug. They stayed up all night at Kenwood, experiencing the full effects of their first LSD trip.|$|E
5|$|In La Paz, the Municipal Direction of Civil defense {{informed}} that the first of 13temporary shelters would be opened and anticipated the evacuation of more than 2000people that lived in high-risk zones. In some areas, the local police recommended to the population, mostly those living in areas of high risk, that they should take care <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> their homes unless necessary and to find evacuation routes and temporary shelters. Both Manuel Márquez de León International Airport in La Paz and Los Cabos International Airport in San José del Cabo were shut down, stranding 7,500–8,500 tourists. Henriette also forced the ports in Los Cabos to close completely, and the port in La Paz to close to small craft.|$|E
5|$|In his five-volume {{analysis}} of the French Revolutionary Wars, Ramsay Weston Phipps speculated on why Moreau gained renown by the supposed skill of his retreat. Phipps suggested {{that it was not}} skillful for Moreau to allow the inferior columns of Latour, Nauendorf and Fröhlich to herd him back to France. Even during his advance Moreau was irresolute. Jean-de-Dieu Soult, who participated in the campaign as an infantry brigadier, noted that Jourdan made many errors but the French government's errors were worse. The French were unable to pay for supplies because their currency was worthless, so the soldiers stole everything. This ruined discipline and turned the local populations against the French. Jourdan seemed to have an unwarranted faith in Moreau's promise to follow Charles. His decision to give battle at Würzburg was partly done so as <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> Moreau in the lurch.|$|E

Sidney Freund, the superintendent, said that the district was responsible for students while they were in school, so they needed to stay in school. Ninth graders, who came in from the eighth grade, were <b>not</b> allowed <b>to</b> <b>leave.</b> Then each subsequent grade would be <b>not</b> allowed <b>to</b> <b>leave.</b> Therefore [...] "open campus" [...] was being grandfathered out. Freund said that, in this manner, the new students did not feel that they had lost a privilege, since they never had it.|$|R
5|$|Malekith, {{awakened by}} the Aether's release, turns Algrim into a Kursed and attacks Asgard. During the battle, Malekith and Algrim search for Jane, sensing that she {{contains}} the Aether.

Despite Odin's orders <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> Asgard, Thor reluctantly enlists the help of Loki, who knows of a secret portal to Svartalfheim, where they will use Jane to lure and confront Malekith, away from Asgard. In return, Thor promises Loki vengeance on Malekith for killing their mother. With Volstagg and Sif stalling Asgardian soldiers and Fandral assisting their escape, Thor, Loki, and Jane head to Svartalfheim.|$|E

5|$|After the storm, {{there were}} 1,000fishermen missing at sea, despite {{warnings}} <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> port. After being presumed lost, 162boats returned to port {{four days after}} the storm, and additional fishermen returned over the succeeding days. However, there were 569fishermen killed or left missing due to lost boats at sea. Many of these fishermen had departed days before the storm, and those that survived had transistors in their boats. Lacking advanced warning, many shrimp farmers in remote villages were swept away by waves. Hundreds of dead bodies were discovered along the shore; after they were identified, the corpses were cremated instead of bringing the bodies into local villages. Most of the fatalities on land were the result of buildings collapsing on people who stayed inside. A ferry crossing the Godavari River sank amid rough waves, killing all 42people on board. Overall, the cyclone killed at least 978people in Andhra Pradesh, with 1,375people listed as missing in January 1997. However, the Red Cross did not expect to find all of the missing bodies, as some were likely washed into the Bay of Bengal. A later report to the Food and Agriculture Organization indicated there were 1,077confirmed deaths, with an unconfirmed death toll as high as 2,760.|$|E

While saying her farewell to her colleagues of the last seven years, there is a possible act of terrorism in Seattle, which later turns out to be just a gas main explosion. Cristina has a quick but emotional goodbye hug with Derek, Bailey, and Webber, leaves her shares of the hospital to Alex, and dances it out with Meredith one last time to an old favorite song. Owen, however, is busy saving a patient in the O.R., so they share a silent goodbye through the gallery's glass.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} storm reached its peak {{intensity}} on November20, the NHC issued a hurricane watch from Grand Isle, Louisiana, to Cedar Key, Florida. Later that day, {{a portion of the}} watch area was upgraded to a warning from Bay St. Louis, Mississippi to St. Marks, Florida. About 20,000employees on oil platforms in the Gulf of Mexico were evacuated, many by helicopter. The USS Lexington left port from Naval Air Station Pensacola to ride out the storm in open waters, and aircraft in the region were flown inland. About 100,000people along the Florida Panhandle were told to leave their houses after Governor Bob Graham issued evacuation orders in 13counties. About 2,000people stayed in 34shelters in Panama City. Roads in the region suffered traffic jams from the large volume of evacuees. Portions of the Florida Gulf Coast had been threatened by Hurricane Elena earlier in the season, and some evacuees of that storm intended <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> during Kate due to the poor shelter conditions that they had experienced. Governor Graham activated 300members of the Florida National Guard to prevent looting and to assist in evacuations. One person died from a stress-induced heart attack in Chipley after evacuating. Outside of Florida, about 2,200people fled Grand Isle, Louisiana.|$|E
5|$|The {{low that}} {{eventually}} became Arlene prompted wind warnings and small craft advisories for both coasts in southern Florida on May 27. The small craft advisory was significantly expanded {{the next day}} when the low was upgraded to Tropical Storm Arlene. The new warnings stretched from Sabine Pass, Texas to Saint Marks, Florida. Gale warnings were also issued upon the upgrade from Morgan City, Louisiana to Pascagoula, Mississippi. Rough seas and tides of two to four feet (0.6 to 1.2 metres)—also known as storm surge—were expected in the areas under the gale warning. By May29, all craft were advised <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> port in Louisiana. Memories of Hurricane Audrey led to numerous residents evacuating coastal areas upon hearing about Arlene. In Pierre, 50 families evacuated to higher grounds. Officials reported that 25 families were also evacuated from low-lying areas in Vermilion Parish. As Arlene neared landfall, the small craft advisory was canceled from Pensacola, Florida southward. The new warnings extended from Pensacola to Galveston, Texas. The gale warnings shifted more towards the west, now extending from Galveston, Texas to Grand Isle, Louisiana.|$|E
