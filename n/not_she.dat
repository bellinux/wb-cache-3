5|$|Final Fantasy XIII: Episode I, a short novel set {{immediately}} after XIII, shows Lightning uneasy about whether her battle is over or <b>not.</b> <b>She</b> leaves to save Fang and Vanille, but first gives her blessing to Snow and Serah's marriage. Eventually, Lightning finds herself {{caught in a}} dark void, but she decides to keep moving forward.|$|E
5|$|Her {{marriage}} {{into the}} aristocracy, while controversial at the time, {{gave her the}} social cachet in an antisemitic society that her vast fortune could <b>not.</b> <b>She</b> subsequently became a political hostess and philanthropist. Her charitable work was principally {{in the sphere of}} public health and causes associated with the welfare of working-class Jewish women living in the poorer districts of London.|$|E
5|$|Many fans of {{the show}} were outraged when Mercedes was {{supposedly}} murdered by Freddie Roscoe in November 2014, just a week after her sister Carmel died in a train crash. However, Jennifer Metcalfe stated that: 'Mercedes's departure is totally shrouded in mystery. Running up to the week where she exits, she has really annoyed pretty much everyone in the village, so it's 'who's done it?'. The story line was billed as a complete mystery, as the viewers don't completely know what happened between Mercedes and her killer on {{the night at the}} McQueen house, or whether or <b>not</b> <b>she</b> was actually dead.|$|E
6000|$|... 'To {{tell the}} truth, mother, I have thought {{very little about}} her. <b>She</b> is <b>not</b> pretty, <b>she</b> is <b>not</b> plain; <b>she</b> is <b>not</b> clever, <b>she</b> is <b>not</b> stupid; <b>she</b> is neither saint nor sinner.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And now," [...] said Miss Frazier, delightedly, to the captain, [...] "she's a real ship, is <b>n't</b> <b>she?</b> It {{seems only}} {{the other day}} father gave the order for her, and now--and now--is <b>n't</b> <b>she</b> a beauty!" [...] The girl was proud of the firm, and talked {{as though she were}} the {{controlling}} partner.|$|R
6000|$|... "Av' she's no beauty, <b>she's</b> <b>not</b> downright ugly, {{like many}} a girl that gets a good husband; and av' <b>she's</b> <b>not</b> over young, <b>she's</b> <b>not</b> over old. <b>She's</b> <b>not</b> so {{much older than}} myself, after all. It's only because her own people have always made nothing of her; that's what has made {{everybody}} else do the same." ...|$|R
5|$|The {{episode was}} based on actual reports of {{conflict}} between the two nations. Hermione Norris made her final appearance as Ros Myers; the producers intended to leave her fate open {{in order for the}} audience to debate whether or <b>not</b> <b>she</b> survived the hotel explosion {{at the end of the}} episode. It was viewed by under six million viewers after its original broadcast, and received overwhelmingly positive reviews, particularly due to the reveal of Nightingale's plot and the cliffhanger, questioning whether or not Ros survived the hotel explosion.|$|E
5|$|Heureuse Réunion {{responded to}} the cannonade in kind. During the engagement, Gaspard {{repeatedly}} attempted to board Southampton, where his vastly superior numbers could overwhelm the British crew. Yeo was aware of his enemy's intentions, and repeatedly manoeuvered out of the way, his more disciplined and agile vessel easily able to remain out of contact with the overloaded Haitian ship. Within half an hour the highly efficient gunners on Southampton had knocked down the main and mizen masts on Heureuse Réunion, leaving her unable to manoeuvre and vulnerable to repeated pounding at close range. Despite the severe damage the Haitian ship suffered, her crew continued to fire cannon at irregular intervals for 45 minutes, each shot prompting a broadside from the British ship. The two smaller Haitian vessels {{did not support the}} frigate, fleeing towards Maraguana near Petit Goâve to shelter under the batteries there. By 07:45, after over an hour of heavy fire, Yeo hailed Heureuse Réunion to discover whether or <b>not</b> <b>she</b> had surrendered. Somebody aboard replied that they had, although Gaspard had been seriously wounded and was no longer in command, so the identity of the person who gave the surrender is not known.|$|E
5|$|Keith {{questions}} Veronica {{about whether}} or <b>not</b> <b>she</b> broke into the house, despite knowing her guilt. Jake and a county prosecutor tell Keith that they will get a judge's order and will return to prosecute Veronica. The supercomputer processes {{the names of all}} the Castle members just as Keith hands over the surveillance tape to the county prosecutor. Logan tries to apologize to Veronica. One of the Castle members comes up and tells her that the organization videotaped her, and Logan assaults him. Veronica returns the tape to Jake Kane on the condition that he does not tell Keith about it. She sees in the newspaper that charges have been filed against Keith for tampering with evidence relating to Veronica's break-in, likely meaning that he will lose the votes needed to win the sheriff's election. She goes into a voting booth and votes for Keith as sheriff, walking away in pouring rain.|$|E

5|$|The most {{prominent}} {{member of the}} new ensemble was Laura Peverara, followed by Livia d'Arco and Anna Guarini, daughter of the prolific poet Giovanni Battista Guarini. Giovanni wrote poems for many of the madrigals which were set for the ensemble, and choreographed scenes for the balletto delle donne. Judith Tick believes Tarquinia Molza sang with the group, but Anthony Newcomb says she was involved solely as an advisor and instructor. Whether Tarquinia Molza ever performed with them or <b>not,</b> <b>she</b> was ousted from any role in the group after her affair with the composer Giaches de Wert came to light in 1589. Luzzasco Luzzaschi directed and composed music to showcase the ensemble, and accompanied them on the harpsichord. Ippolito Fiorini was the maestro di capella, in charge of the entire court's musical activities. In addition to his duties to the overall court, he accompanied the concerto on the lute. Vittorio Baldini was brought to the court as ducal music printer in 1582.|$|E
5|$|The {{second season}} begins {{six weeks after}} the end of the first, where Magnus works hard to defeat the Cabal and save Ashley, whom the Cabal {{transformed}} to a vampire-hybrid superabnormal, one of six tasked to destroy the Sanctuary Network. When the superabnormals arrive at the Old City Sanctuary, Magnus is able to get through to Ashley, who recognises her in time to save her from another superabnormal, and then teleports. Because an electromagnetic field is active, it would mean whoever teleports inside would be vaporized. Despite this, Magnus believes Ashley's life energy may be in the electromagnetic field's buffer. When it does <b>not,</b> <b>she</b> is forced to accept that Ashley has died. Because of her death, and other loved ones because of her longevity, she tried to find a way to age at a normal rate again. She finds an elixir used by the Mayans in Honduras, but it has the side effect of turning humans into zombie-like creatures. After being shown the potential consequences of the elixir's release by an incorporeal guardian, she decides to leave it behind.|$|E
5|$|The series {{opens with}} Jerry Seinfeld (Jerry Seinfeld) and George Costanza (Jason Alexander) seated at Pete's Luncheonette, debating the {{placement}} of one of George's shirt buttons. Jerry tells George about a woman he met in Lansing, Michigan, Laura (Pamela Brull), who is coming to New York, and the two discuss whether or <b>not</b> <b>she</b> has romantic intentions. The next evening, Jerry tells his neighbor Kessler (Michael Richards) that he thinks he misunderstood the situation with Laura. However, he then receives {{a telephone call from}} Laura, who asks if she can stay overnight at his apartment. Though Jerry agrees, he is still unsure whether or not her visit is intended to be romantic. George and Jerry continue to debate the issue, with Jerry determined to find the true nature of her visit.|$|E

60|$|She {{is still}} {{reaching}} for the Dollar, she will continue to reach for it; but <b>not</b> that <b>she</b> may spend it upon herself; <b>not</b> that <b>she</b> may spend it upon charities; <b>not</b> that <b>she</b> may indemnify an early deprivation and clothe herself {{in a blaze of}} North Adams gauds; <b>not</b> that <b>she</b> may have nine breeds of pie for breakfast, as only the rich New-Englander can; <b>not</b> that <b>she</b> may indulge any petty material vanity or appetite that once was hers and prized and nursed, but that she may apply that Dollar to statelier uses, and place it where it may cast the metallic sheen of her glory farthest across the receding expanses of the globe.|$|R

5|$|When Nick returns after {{a seven-year}} absence, he tells Dot {{he has changed}} {{and is now a}} plumber, {{introducing}} her to his six-year-old daughter Dotty Cotton (Molly Conlin). However, Dot discovers that Nick is only there for her money. She refuses to pay him, so he tells her if she does <b>not,</b> <b>she</b> cannot see Dotty. Dot gives Nick the money and looks after Dotty. It is revealed Dotty and Nick are planning to kill Dot for her life insurance. They convince her that she has symptoms of dementia, but their plan backfires when Dotty exposes the plot. In a rage, Nick holds various members of the community hostage, resulting in an explosion in Kathy's café. Nick survives and after being disowned again by Dot, he informs her that Dotty had masterminded the murder plot before fleeing. Dotty is retrieved by her mother, Sandy (Caroline Pegg), following various devious deeds, such as accusing Dot of beating her, which leads to Dot being questioned by the police for child abuse. Nevertheless, Dot is sorry to see Dotty go.|$|E
5|$|Torres, {{who was in}} a coma {{the entire}} time, is resuscitated by Paris and the Doctor; she had almost died from the {{accident}} in the ion storm. Chakotay believes that Torres' encounter with her mother was a hallucination prompted from her near-death experience, but she believes that it was real. Torres believes that her mother is being punished because of her daughter's dishonor, stating that she must return to the Barge of the Dead to rescue her. Captain Kathryn Janeway permits Torres to put herself in an induced coma, with the Doctor monitoring the procedure. After being placed in a coma, Torres successfully returns to the barge. She reunites with her mother, but they argue about whether or <b>not</b> <b>she</b> has truly embraced Klingon spirituality. Miral responds by telling her that she does not understand what it truly means to be a Klingon. After their conversation, Torres decides to take her mother's place on the barge; even though Miral resists the transference, she is allowed to move on Sto-vo-kor (a version of the afterlife similar to the Norse Valhalla) while Torres is escorted into Gre'thor. She discovers that Voyager is her version of Gre'thor, and is confronted by alternate versions of the crew. Miral returns to explain that she cannot fully be released into Sto-vo-kor until Torres completes her journey. Tuvok attacks Torres again with a bat'leth, but she surrenders rather than fighting back. Miral identifies this as the first step in her path. She informs Torres that they will reunite either in Sto-vo-kor or when Torres returns home. Torres is resuscitated and embraced by Janeway.|$|E

25|$|On 18 January 2013, Tymoshenko was {{notified}} {{that she is}} a suspect in the murder of Scherban, his wife and two other people in 1996. Tymoshenko denied the charges and according to Tymoshenko <b>not</b> <b>she,</b> but President Yanukovych had benefited most of the murder of Shcherban.|$|E
25|$|Within a {{month after}} Genie's {{admission}} to Children's Hospital, Jay Shurley, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the University of Oklahoma and a specialist in extreme social isolation, {{took an interest in}} her case. Shurley noted that Genie's was the most severe case of isolation he had ever studied or heard about, which he maintained more than 20 years later. Over the next year and a half he came on three three-day visits to conduct daily observations and to carry out a sleep study, hoping to determine if Genie was autistic, whether or <b>not</b> <b>she</b> had sustained any brain damage, and whether or <b>not</b> <b>she</b> was born mentally disabled. Shurley concluded she was not autistic, with which later researchers concurred; he noted that she had a high level of emotional disturbance, but wrote that her eagerness for new stimuli and lack of behavioral defense mechanisms were uncharacteristic of autism.|$|E
25|$|Heseltine {{believed}} {{that he would have}} defeated Thatcher if she had contested the second ballot. It has been suggested that he should have withdrawn after weakening her on the first ballot, and that he would have been restored to the Cabinet whether or <b>not</b> <b>she</b> continued as Prime Minister; he writes that this was never seriously suggested at the time.|$|E

5000|$|Musgrave, when giving {{insight into}} the character's sexual identity, stated, [...] "I think that Ashley has always been known for being unpredictable. One of her famous lines is, 'I'm <b>not</b> into labels.' <b>She</b> doesn't have one, so <b>she's</b> <b>not</b> gay, <b>she's</b> <b>not</b> straight." [...] Musgrave added, [...] "But whoever she sees love in, she falls for that person. <b>She's</b> <b>not</b> going for a {{physical}} package; she's going for the inner characteristics. I think that's important, and I wish that more humans could be like that. I think that <b>she's</b> <b>not</b> worried about finding her sexual identity; it's found. And she is the 'no label girl.'" ...|$|R
25|$|One of {{the most}} notable storylines Lofty was {{involved}} with was his marriage to the teenage mother, Michelle Fowler (Susan Tully). Michelle and Lofty's church wedding was a massive target of press speculation before the episodes aired. They wanted to know two things, firstly the design of Michelle's dress, and secondly whether or <b>not</b> <b>she</b> would jilt Lofty at the altar.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to her European language skills, Alexandra speaks a bit of Cantonese. At {{a press conference in}} 1995, when asked whether or <b>not</b> <b>she</b> is able to communicate with Prince Henrik in Chinese, she stated that she believes that his Chinese is better than hers. She then clarified that Henrik speaks Mandarin Chinese while she speaks a little bit of Cantonese, which is the dominant language in Hong Kong.|$|E
