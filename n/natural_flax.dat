The effect of z-pinning using <b>natural</b> <b>flax</b> yarn on the critical buckling load and post-buckling behaviour of multi-delaminated composite beams was investigated. Laminated composite beams were pinned through their thickness using <b>natural</b> <b>flax</b> yarns to control delamination failure during the post-buckling process. A multiple delamination with a triangular shape was inserted into each of the beams to simulate {{the damage caused by}} a low velocity impact e. g. ice, on composite wind turbine blades. For a laminate design of [C 90 /G 90] 4, global collapse caused no delamination failure during the post-buckling test while delamination failure occurred for a laminate design of [C 0 /G 0] 4. In this case, z-pinning can significantly increase the failure resistance within a composite structure and it can then postpone the failure process. The buckling process of a multi-delaminated composite beam was also simulated by finite element software ANSYS and the results were substantially verified by relevant experimental results...|$|E

40|$|This paper reports an {{investigation}} {{on the use}} of <b>natural</b> <b>flax</b> fabric reinforced polymer (FFRP) composite plates as external strengthening material of reinforced concrete (RC) beams. The flexural behaviour of 2 m-long RC beams with and without FFRP plates are evaluated under four-point bending. The test variables include FFRP thickness (4 and 6 layer), the amount of internal steel reinforcement ratio (0. 223 % and 0. 503 %) and a pre-cracking of RC beams (i. e. by applying 80 % yielding load of the control RC beam before the bond of FFRP plates to the RC beams). The test results indicated that FFRP plates enhance the ultimate load, deflection and ductility of the beams significantly. The increase in load and ductility is more effective for RC beams with a lower steel ratio. The strengthened beams show a similar failure mode, i. e. steel yielding and then rupture of the FFRP plate. Pre-cracking of the RC beams has no obvious effect on the ultimate load and energy absorption capacity of the FFRP strengthened beams, indicating that FFRP will be effectively to retrofit damaged RC beams (e. g. after earthquake-attack). In addition, the experimental results are compared with the predictions based on the equations given in ACI 440. 2 R- 08 for RC beams strengthened with synthetic FRP composites.

40|$|Advance Composite Materials {{have found}} various {{applications}} {{due to their}} unique properties over the past years. Properties such as high specific strength and stiffness, corrosion resistance and fatigue resistance that can be adjusted to specific requirements have made these materials {{as one of the}} main candidate considered during design process. The high energy absorbing capabilities of FRP composite materials {{is one of the main}} factors in their application in automotive and aerospace structures. They also provide other functional and economic benefits such as enhanced strength, durability, weight reduction and hence lower fuel consumption. The brittle nature of most composites accompanying other forms of energy absorption mechanisms such as fibre breakage, matrix cracking, deboning at the fibre-matrix interface and especially plies delaminations which play important roles on progressive failure mode and energy absorption capability of composite structures. Delamination which is known as principle mode of failure of layered composites due to separation along the interfaces of layers is one of the main concerns in designing of composite structures. This factor plays an important role on progressive failure mode and energy absorption capability of composite structures. Delamination can occur due to various reasons such as impact, imperfection in manufacturing, high stress concentration, environmental effects and post-processing. In this project an advanced manufacturing methods will be applied to stitch carbon-fibre composite testing specimens using sustainable <b>natural</b> <b>flax</b> fibres. The natural fibres running through the thickness of laminated composite structures will increase the resistance to crack propagation and consequently the energy absorption capability of composite absorbers. <b>Natural</b> <b>flax</b> fibres have the main advantage over the synthetic fibres (e. g. carbon and glass) of providing both resistance and progressive failure (effective crack growth resistance) in the wall of composite box absorbers.

Furthermore, positive effect of fibres can be reversed when the dosage in fibres is too high (difficulties to extrude and drainage phenomenon which led to a stiffening of the mix). VMA caused an important loss of workability and time gap which influenced the passing ability of the mix through the extruder.
