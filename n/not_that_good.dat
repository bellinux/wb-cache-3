5|$|At the Boels Rental Hills Classic Van Dijk {{was part}} of front group that {{consisted}} of six riders which fell apart into {{a group of three}} riders. With an uphill finish, Van Dijk lost the sprint from Johansson (Orica-AIS) and finished second ahead of Amy Pieters (Rabo Liv). Van Dijk won the mountain classification of the race. In June, Van Dijk started as the main favourite at the Dutch National Time Trial Championships, but did not win her fourth time trial title. She finished second, with a margin of only 0.02 seconds, behind Annemiek van Vleuten (Rabo Liv). Van Dijk was disappointed and responded that she was <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>good</b> as in 2013 without having a real explanation for it.|$|E
5|$|When Bart {{finds out}} her secret and reveals {{it to the}} school, her social ranking plummets to a new low until a psychic force tells Lady Gaga that Lisa needs her help immediately. After much soul searching and yelling at Lady Gaga for trying to help, Lisa realizes that her {{outburst}} helped her because she is finally expressing her anger instead of bottling it up inside her, in effect making Lady Gaga's mission successful. Lisa catches Lady Gaga just before she leaves town to apologize, and after being forgiven she and Lady Gaga perform a duet together. With Lady Gaga's assistance, Lisa and the entire town of Springfield realize that being oneself is better than being like anyone else. Just as Lady Gaga's train begins to leave again, Moe runs {{up to her and}} asks if she can help him as well, but Lady Gaga declines, stating that she's <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>good.</b> As Moe turns and walks across the train track, a second train hits him.|$|E

Hillenburg {{had no problem with}} candy and ice cream tie-ins, Pistor said (because of the treats' simplicity), but he had issues with fast food tie-ins; according to him, the latter was [...] "full of hidden additives." [...] Pistor said, [...] "The trouble is that you can't go out with animated films without a fast-food tie-in People don't take you seriously." [...] Hillenburg replied, [...] "Yeah, well, my take on that is that we shouldn't do that We didn't want to suddenly become the people serving up food that's <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>good</b> for you - especially kids. We work with Burger King, and they make toys and watches. But to actually take the step of pushing the food, that's crossing the line. I don't want to be the Pied Piper of fast food." ...|$|E

500|$|The 2012 Summer Games marked Sherab Zam's Olympic debut. She was {{the flag}} bearer {{at both the}} opening and closing ceremonies. She {{qualified}} for the individual archery competition after receiving a wildcard from the Tripartite Commission. In an interview with Reuters before the games Zam said that [...] "Participation {{is more important than}} winning a medal." [...] Zam spent time in South Korea and India preparing for the games. The archery events at the 2012 games were held at the Lord's Cricket Ground. Zam competed on 27 July in the ranking round, finishing 61st out of 64 competitors with 589 points. She scored 82 points less than the leading competitor, Ki Bo-bae of South Korea. Zam competed against American Khatuna Lorig, the fourth ranking athlete in the ranking round, in the round of 64. Lorig beat Zam three sets to none in about six minutes. This meant Zam was eliminated from the competition. After the games Zam said: [...] "I am <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>good</b> at archery but I love it. It was so good to meet world ranking archers who are famous and to watch how they do it. I have learnt a lot from them," [...] and that, [...] "When I grew up I never dreamt I would come to London, let alone compete in an Olympics. This just shows that anything is possible. The Olympics is great for that." ...|$|E
500|$|American critic Robert Christgau {{gave the}} album a [...] "neither" [...] rating, {{indicating}} an album that [...] "may impress {{once or twice}} with consistent craft or an arresting track or two. Then it won't". A negative review came from Rolling Stone, who gave the album two stars out of five, labelling the album [...] "utterly disappointing" [...] and blaming producer Nellee Hooper, suggesting he [...] "sabotaged a ferociously iconoclastic talent with a phalanx of cheap electronic gimmickry." [...] Michele Romero of Entertainment Weekly gave the album a C, saying, [...] "On a few songs, [...] breathy mewl is a pleasant contrast to the mechanical drone of Sugarcube-like techno-tunes. But most of Debut sounds annoyingly like the monotonous plinking of a deranged music box. Wind it up if you like -- eventually it will stop." [...] Debut rated highly in British end of year polls. The NME ranked Debut at number one on their list of [...] "Top 50 LPs of 1993". Melody Maker placed the album at number six on their list of [...] "Albums of the Year for 1993" [...] calling it [...] "a fantastic debut". In 1994, Q included the album on their list for top fifty albums of 1993. Björk reacted to the positive reviews hesitantly, stating that if she'd [...] "delivered exactly the same album and I came from Nottingham, I'd have got completely different reviews, normal down-to-earth ones" [...] and that Debut [...] "was {{a bit of a}} rehearsal and it's really <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>good.</b> I can do much better." ...|$|E

But her presence disturbed him; he cared not for her books; the two nurses whom he loved faithfully watched him; {{and my wife and}} I were admitted to him sometimes, both of whom he honoured with regard and recognition.
