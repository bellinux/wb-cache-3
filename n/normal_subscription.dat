50|$|A Game Time Card (also called Game Time Code) {{generally}} {{refers to}} any one-time use code {{that allows you}} subscription time to a certain game, usually a Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game (MMORPG). These are a quite popular alternative to <b>normal</b> <b>subscription</b> method of cyclical billing that most games offer because the GTC is usually comparable in cost and can be given as a gift or used on any account for that game.|$|E
50|$|The term GTC, {{originally}} {{an acronym}} for Game Time Card or Game Time Code, now often simply refers to any one-use code for an online game. Some other uses include upgraded subscription cards, new account codes, and even codes you can redeem for in-game money. Many popular online games offer this great substitution for <b>normal</b> <b>subscription</b> methods; others, such as NCSoft, allow you to add this game time across all of their games you currently have an account for.

40|$|E-mail is a {{means by}} which {{information}} can be exchanged between computers. Using a personal computer, a modem and a telephone, data is sent in a form that is ready to use with the receiving computer for as little as one-tenth the cost of fax or telex. E-mail can be used to link libraries which are part of the same electronic mail network. In Nairobi, for instance, the Kengele Network connects users on the African Regional Office for Standardization (ARSO) and the Environmental Liaison Centre International (ELCI) 'store and forward' nodes. Libraries can use e-mail to send inter-library search requests to a list of participating libraries who are 'on line'. This is done by creating a cc: list and referencing it in a message. Copies of the request are automatically generated to listed users. Since they are all local users, no additional charges are incurred in addition to the <b>normal</b> monthly <b>subscription</b> which is currently US$ 10. If a node offers a 'mail in/mail out' service, libraries without e-mail facilities can also participate by sending a letter to the node or using the 'drop in centre' at the node office to prepare a request message. Responses received electronically will be printed out and sent by ordinary mail. The service is operated on a cost recovery basis at US$ 1. 00 for each batch of sent/received messages. Currently this service is being offered by the ARSO node. Because electronic mail can be used to send and receive messages and data to or from distant colleagues in a computer ready form, it is an ideal way of exchanging information and undertaking collaborative research world-wide.
