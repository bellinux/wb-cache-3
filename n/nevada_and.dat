5|$|After {{the death}} of one of the children, the family turned to Spiritualism in 1855. Gordon toured the Northeast of the United States giving public speeches, {{starting}} as young as 15, including a speech in Boston at age 18. During one such event, she met a Scottish physician named Charles H. Gordon, and married him in 1862.

5|$|Although more {{abundant}} in montane and northern coniferous woodlands {{such as the}} Sierra <b>Nevada</b> <b>and</b> the Cascade Range in northwestern North America, Gyromitra esculenta is found widely across the continent, {{as far south as}} Mexico. It is also common in Central Europe, less abundant in the east, and more in montane areas than lowlands. It has been recorded from Northern Ireland, from Uşak Province in Western Turkey, and from the vicinity of Kaş in the Antalya Province of Turkey's southern coast.|$|E
5|$|Apeomyoides savagei is {{from the}} Eastgate local fauna in the Monarch Mill Formation of Churchill County, Nevada. This fauna dates to the early Barstovian land mammal age, around 15–16 mya. This makes Apeomyoides the {{youngest}} known apeomyine, and its occurrence helps close {{a gap in the}} known geographic range of North American apeomyines between Megapeomys bobwilsoni elsewhere in <b>Nevada</b> <b>and</b> Arikareeomys in Nebraska. Other eomyids found at Eastgate include species of Leptodontomys and Pseudotheridomys.|$|E
5|$|As {{the area}} boomed {{following}} {{the discovery of the}} Comstock Lode, the Bowers claim proved to hold one of the richest seams of silver ore in what would become <b>Nevada,</b> <b>and</b> because their claim was close to the surface, it was easily extracted without initial capital investment.

5|$|Four {{hundred million}} years ago, California lay {{at the bottom of}} a large sea; {{underwater}} volcanoes deposited lava and minerals (including gold) onto the sea floor. By tectonic forces these minerals and rocks came to the surface of the Sierra <b>Nevada,</b> <b>and</b> eroded. Water carried the exposed gold downstream and deposited it in quiet gravel beds along the sides of old rivers and streams. The forty-niners first focused their efforts on these deposits of gold.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, Bowers {{returned}} to Nevada. Her hearing had diminished significantly, {{and she was}} forced to give up the scrying business as she was unable to hear the requests of her clients. She launched a claim against the government asking for financial assistance in return for the $14,000 she and Sandy Bowers had donated to support the Union cause in the Civil War and to finance the 1860 Paiute War, but was ignored. Destitute, she was placed in the Washoe County poorhouse, and became the subject of a protracted legal dispute between the governments of <b>Nevada</b> <b>and</b> California over who was to pay for her care. In August 1901 it was agreed that California would take responsibility for her welfare, and she was summarily put on a San Francisco-bound train by Reno officials with $30 cash. For {{the last two years of}} her life she lived at the King's Daughters Home in Oakland, dying on October 27, 1903. Her ashes were returned to <b>Nevada</b> <b>and</b> buried alongside Sandy and Margaret at the Bowers Mansion.|$|E

5|$|<b>Nevada</b> <b>and</b> Maryland then {{exchanged}} punts three times, and the Wolf Pack punted it away {{a fourth}} time. In {{the span of}} two series, Kaepernick was sacked three times, once each by linebackers Dave Philistin, Alex Wujciak, and Adrian Moten. As a result, Kaepernick suffered an ankle sprain and played {{the rest of the}} game, but he noticeably favored his uninjured side. The Terps took over on their 47-yard line with 0:29 remaining in the half. Turner completed an eight-yard pass to Ronnie Tyler, and a Nevada hit out-of-bounds resulted in a 15-yard penalty against <b>Nevada</b> <b>and</b> a first down for Maryland. After two incomplete passes, Turner then converted on third down again with a toss to Tyler for 16yards and then once more for 14yards and a touchdown to bring the score to 26–14 in Maryland's favor. The Terps elected to attempt a two-point conversion, and Turner completed a pass to a wide-open Meggett in {{the right side of the}} end zone. With six seconds remaining in the first half, Maryland had a 28–14 lead. Nevada received Maryland's kickoff, but elected to run out the clock and head into halftime.|$|E
