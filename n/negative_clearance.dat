40|$|Summary]. The aim of {{this article}} is to discuss whether the timing for the Commission’s Proposal for {{reforming}} the implementation of Articles 81 and 82 of the EC Treaty is appropriate based on legal certainty considerations. The Proposal suggests to decentralise the day-to-day application of the EC antitrust rules further than is the case today and to abolish the present notification system whereby undertakings can apply for exemptions pursuant to Article 81 (3) and <b>negative</b> <b>clearances.</b> The article provides examples showing that presently, the answers to certain legal questions of EC competition rules are vague or contradictory, and that if the proposed reform were to be implemented in its present form, the undertakings would have to carry the full risk for compliance with the competition rules but without a simple or straightforward way of obtaining guidance or legally binding exemptions or <b>negative</b> <b>clearances.</b> While recognising the need for a reform of the implementation system of the EC competition rules, the article argues that consistency and coherence in the understanding and application of the competition rules are a prerequisite to ensure legal certainty which, in turn, is a prerequisite for the implementation of the Commission’s plans to decentralise EC competition law application. It is therefore suggested that the time is not yet ripe for the type of reform proposed by the Commission and that efforts should instead focus on creating the basis for such a reform by adopting clear guidelines and/or binding legislation that secure the legal certainty of the undertakings that have to operate under the EC competition law framework...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Fine-{{blanking}} with <b>negative</b> <b>clearance</b> {{is a kind}} of {{fine blanking}} processes. The punch size of fine-blanking with <b>negative</b> <b>clearance</b> is larger than the die size. The paper does lots of simulations for the changes of blanking force in fine-blanking with <b>negative</b> <b>clearance</b> and common blanking by DEFORM software, and the blanking force curves are gained by these experiments. The changing principle of blanking force and internal material is obtained through the simulation and experiments. The result shows that simulation blanking force of AISI- 1045 is lager than the actual blanking force. According to the curves derived from experiments, we can see that the maximum blanking force of fine-blanking with <b>negative</b> <b>clearance</b> is higher than common blanking force. Compared with fine-blanking with <b>negative</b> <b>clearance,</b> the common blanking force reduces faster after the blanking force reaches maximum value. The experiment result shows that the force of fine-blanking with <b>negative</b> <b>clearance</b> under a smaller blanking clearance is a bit bigger than the force of common blanking force, and the blanking quality of fine-blanking with <b>negative</b> <b>clearance</b> is much better than that of common blanking. Cracks can be closed effectively by the special squeeze forming in fine blanking with <b>negative</b> <b>clearance.</b> Then, the crack can not expand continuously, and the bonding force is enhanced. The squeeze forming can restrain intergranular deformation and reduce the damage. However, the stretch forming easily leads to the inner crack and defect of materials. By means of the analysis on experimental curves, the paper further studies the changing law of fine-blanking with <b>negative</b> <b>clearance</b> blanking force...|$|E

This paper studied the common blanking of 60 Mn and the fine blanking with <b>negative</b> <b>clearance</b> of 60 Mn blanking work piece metallographic structure by using scanning electron microscope. The {{results show that the}} fine blanking with <b>negative</b> <b>clearance</b> process can increase the work-hardening degree and further thin the punching surface tissue, inhibit the crack, and make the blanking surface smooth. The tensile and tear result in the generation of cracks and burrs, and the extrusion forming of fine blanking with <b>negative</b> <b>clearance</b> inhibit the generation of cracks, and eliminate the conditions of the burrs. As the extrusion process, the degree of work hardening in fine blanking with <b>negative</b> <b>clearance</b> is higher than the common blanking, the organizations are more closed. The mechanism of fine blanking with <b>negative</b> <b>clearance</b> The fine-blanking with <b>negative</b> <b>clearance</b> can be summarized as follows: Punch drop and contact sheets. The sheets produced elastic compression, tension and bending. As the punch dropping, the pattern edge pressed into the sheet metal.

Studying on the blanking force size of fine-blanking with <b>negative</b> <b>clearance</b> in different blanking stages is a very important significance for studying die wear and analyzing the state of material stress-strain. Firstly, numerical simulation and stress state analysis of the fine-blanking with <b>negative</b> <b>clearance</b> are carried out, with DEFORM-metal forming finite element analysis software. Afterward the relationship curve of blanking force and stroke are measured, and the blanking force with different blanking stages of fine-blanking with <b>negative</b> <b>clearance</b> is analyzed by the simulation and the experiment. The analysis result shows that the simulation blanking force is bigger than the experimental result (error about 15 %), but the blanking force variation tendency is accordant. while the punch pushes down within 0. 1 mm, the blanking force changes quickly. The metal sheet will enter into the state of plastic deformation after the blanking force reaching maximum value. Along with the punch continues to move down, the area of shear zone is decrescent so that the blanking force inches down, and the blanking force reaches a certain value in the place of blanking allowance value finally. With punch pushing the metal sheet to enter the plastic state and punch downward the place of the allowance value, the metal sheet sustained the big blanking force all the time as well as the deformation zone material keeps the plastic deformation.

Being an {{important}} blanking parameter, the blanking allowance of fine-blanking with <b>negative</b> <b>clearance</b> {{has a direct}} relationship {{with the quality of}} work piece and ejector force. The full process of fine-blanking with <b>negative</b> <b>clearance</b> for ASTM- 1022 in different blanking allowances is simulated through the finite element analysis software DEFORM- 2 D, then the ejector force under different blanking allowances is measured through the experiment of fine-blanking with <b>negative</b> <b>clearance.</b> Based on the analysis of the ejector force, the proportion of burnish band and the work piece fracture, the following conclusions are summarized. The size of blanking allowance is not related with the blanking force with the sheet entering plastic state and the maximum blanking force, and is only related with the ejector force. When the value of the blanking allowance is between 0. 1 mm and 0. 3 mm, the friction force between the punch-die and the sheet affects ejector force, and the ejector force is not related with the mechanical properties of material. When the value of the blanking allowance is between 0. 5 mm and 0. 8 mm, with the blanking allowance increasing, the ejector force increases rapidly...|$|E
5000|$|Generally, {{hydraulic}} tappets {{are more}} sensitive to engine oil quality and frequency of oil changes, as carbon sludge and residues may easily lock up the tappets or block oil channels, making the clearance setting ineffective. This has negative impact especially on the engine camshaft and valves due to excessive wear if the clearance setting is not working correctly. As mentioned, one may avoid this by using the manufacturer-recommended grade of engine oil, and by not exceeding the prescribed oil change interval. It is a myth that in certain circumstances, a lifter can [...] "pump up" [...] and create <b>negative</b> valve <b>clearance.</b> The engine oil pump cannot generate enough pressure to cause [...] "pump-up". The problem is due to weak valve springs which permit float at high engine speeds. The followers attempt to take up {{what they see as}} extra clearance. As this speed is maintained, the lifter will continue to expand until the valve is held off its seat when it should be closed. Maintenance of the valve springs at the correct strength is therefore very important to avoid engine damage.|$|R

40|$|Aspects of the renal {{function}} {{were assessed}} in rats {{treated with the}} pentavalent antimonials Glucantime (Meglumine Antimoniate, Rhodia) or Pentostam (Sodium Stibogluconate, Wellcome). In dose of 30 mg of Sb v (Glucantime or Pentostam) by 100 mg of weight by day for 30 days, renal functional changes were observed consisting of disturbances in urine concentrating capacity. Such disturbances were expressed by significantly low values of urine osmolality {{as compared to the}} basal values previous to the drugs. The decrease in urine osmolality was associated to a significant increase in urinary flow and in <b>negative</b> free-water <b>clearance.</b> There was no alteration in osmolar clearance and in fractional excretion of sodium. These observations suggest an interference of the drugs in the action of the antidiuretic hormone. The disturbance in urine concentration was reversible after a seven days period without the drugs administration. No significant histopathological alterations were observed in the kidneys of the rats treated with the drugs. On the other hand, the rats treated with a high dose of Pentostam (200 mg/ 100 grams of weight/day) showed the functional and the histopathological alterations of the acute tubular necrosis. Estudou-se a função renal de ratos tratados com Glucantime (Antimoniato de Meglumine, Rhodia) e Pentostam (Estibogluconato de Sódio, Wellcome) na dose de 30 mg de Sb v por 100 g de peso por dia, durante 30 dias. Observou-se um distúrio na concentração urinária, que foi reversível 7 dias após cessada a administração das drogas. O estudo histopatológico do rim, por meio da microscopia óptica, não evidenciou alterações significativas. Por outro lado, ratos tratados com altas doses dos antimoniais (200 mg de Sb v por 100 g de peso por dia) mostraram alterações funcionais e histopatológicas renais compatíveis com necrose tubular aguda...|$|R
