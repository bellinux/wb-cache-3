40|$|There is {{currently}} a need for large diameter flanges for the supply of water in South Africa. These large diameter pipe flanges are required to accommodate pipes with <b>nominal</b> <b>bores</b> of up to 4 m and should successfully withstand internal pressures of up to 8 MPa. No current relevant standard / code contains prescribed design values for flanges which either operate at such high pressures or have such large diameters. Due to this an alternative method of design, by means of non-linear finite element modelling, is proposed. Three types of integral flange designs are considered, namely: flat face, raised face, and a modified raised face with an O-ring groove. The effects of creep-relaxation, flange rotation, and the bolting sequence are considered. For each of these designs a finite element model was created and compared to a small scale experiment which included strain and contact pressure measurements. The proposed non-linear finite element models were capable of accurately predicting the strains in the flanges {{as well as the}} contact pressures between the faces of the flange and the surfaces of the packing material. Finally, a comparison between the ASME design method and the proposed non-linear finite element modelling design method was done for the large diameter flanges. It was found that the ASME design code did not have the ability to accurately predict the stresses in the flanges. It was also found that by using the maximum equivalent Von Mises stress as failure criteria for the flanges and fasteners, and contact pressure for the sealing ability, circular bolted flange connections which are lighter, safer, and leak tight could be designed by means of the proposed non-linear finite element models.

50|$|In the DSM process, {{cyclohexane}} was {{heated to}} about 155 °C (311 °F) before passing {{into a series}} of six reactors. The reactors were constructed from mild steel with a stainless steel lining; when operating they held in total about 145 tonnes of flammable liquid at a working pressure of 8.8 kg/cm2 gauge (0.86 MPa gauge; 125 psig). In each of the reactors, compressed air was passed through the cyclohexane, causing {{a small percentage of the}} cyclohexane to oxidise and produce cyclohexanone, some cyclohexanol also being produced. Each reactor was slightly (approximately 14 inches, 350 mm) lower than the previous one, so that the reaction mixture flowed from one to the next by gravity through <b>nominal</b> 28-inch <b>bore</b> (DN 700 mm) stub pipes with inset bellows. The inlet to each reactor was baffled so that liquid entered the reactors at a low level; the exiting liquid flowed over a weir whose crest was somewhat higher than the top of the outlet pipe. The mixture exiting reactor 6 was processed to remove reaction products, and the unreacted cyclohexane (only about 6% was reacted in each pass) then returned to the start of the reactor loop.|$|R

50|$|Two {{months prior}} to the explosion, the number 5 reactor was {{discovered}} to be leaking. When lagging was stripped from it, a crack extending about 6 ft was visible in the mild steel shell of the reactor. It was decided to install a temporary pipe to bypass the leaking reactor to allow continued operation of the plant while repairs were made. In the absence of 28-inch <b>nominal</b> <b>bore</b> pipe (DN 700 mm), 20-inch <b>nominal</b> <b>bore</b> pipe (DN 500 mm) was used to fabricate the bypass pipe for linking reactor 4 outlet to reactor 6 inlet. The new configuration was tested for leak-tightness at working pressure by pressurisation with nitrogen. For two months after fitting the bypass was operated continuously at temperature and pressure and gave no trouble. At the end of May (by which time the bypass had been lagged) the reactors had to be depressurised and allowed to cool {{in order to deal with}} leaks elsewhere. The leaks having been dealt with, early on 1 June attempts began to bring the plant back up to pressure and temperature.|$|E
40|$|Anecdotal {{evidence}} suggests that birds have smaller intestines than mammals. In the present analysis, we show that small birds and bats have significantly shorter small intestines and less small intestine <b>nominal</b> (smooth <b>bore</b> tube) surface area than similarly sized nonflying mammals. The corresponding > 50 % reduction in intestinal volume and hence mass of digesta carried is advantageous because the energetic costs of flight increase with load carried. But, a central dilemma is how birds and bats satisfy relatively high energy needs with less absorptive surface area. Here, we further show that an enhanced paracellular pathway for intestinal absorption of water-soluble nutrients such as glucose and amino acids may compensate for reduced small intestines in volant vertebrates. The evidence is that l-rhamnose and other similarly sized, metabolically inert, nonactively transported monosaccharides are absorbed significantly more in small birds and bats than in nonflying mammals. To broaden our comparison and test the veracity of our finding we surveyed the literature for other similar studies of paracellular absorption. The patterns found in our focal species held up when we included other species surveyed in our analysis. Significantly greater amplification of digestive surface area by villi in small birds, also uncovered by our analysis, may provide one mechanistic explanation for the observation of higher paracellular absorption relative to nonflying mammals. It appears that reduced intestinal size and relatively enhanced intestinal paracellular absorption {{can be added to}} the suite of adaptations that have evolved in actively flying vertebrates...|$|R

5000|$|Nominal Pipe Size (NPS) is a North American set of {{standard}} sizes for pipes used for {{high or low}} pressures and temperatures.

Specific pipe is identified by pipe diameter and another non-dimensional number for wall thickness referred to as the Schedule (Sched. or Sch., for example - [...] "2 inch diameter pipe, Schedule 40"). NPS is often incorrectly called National Pipe Size, due to confusion with national pipe thread (NPT). The European and international designation equivalent to NPS is DN (diamètre nominal/nominal diameter/Durchmesser nach Norm), in which sizes are measured in millimetres, see ISO 6708.

5000|$|A modern variant {{between the}} Foster slug and the sabot slug is the wad slug, {{sometimes}} called a [...] "drive key slug", {{or just a}} [...] "key slug". This {{is a type of}} shotgun slug designed to be fired through a smoothbore shotgun barrel. Like the traditional Foster slug, a deep hollow is located in the rear of this slug, which serves to retain the center of mass near the front tip of the slug much like the Foster slug. However, unlike the Foster slug, a wad slug additionally has a key or web wall molded across the deep hollow, spanning the hollow, which serves to increase the structural integrity of the slug while also reducing the amount of expansion of the slug when fired, reducing the stress on the shot wad in which it rides down a barrel. Also, unlike Foster slugs that have thin fins {{on the outside of the}} slug, much like those on the Brenneke, the wad slug is shaped with an ogive or bullet shape, with a smooth outer surface. The wad slug is loaded using a standard shotshell wad, which acts like a sabot. The diameter of the wad slug is slightly less than the <b>nominal</b> <b>bore</b> diameter, being around 0.690 inch for a 12-gauge wad slug, and a wad slug is generally cast solely from pure lead, necessary for increasing safety if the slug is ever fired through a choked shotgun. Common 12 gauge wad slug masses include -oz. and 1-oz. wad slugs, and they are loaded in a traditional shotshell wad intended for variously loading among -oz., 1-oz., or 1-oz. shotshells. Depending on the specific stack-up, a card wad is also sometimes located between the slug and the shotshell wad, depending largely on which hull is specified, with the primary intended purpose of improving fold crimps on the loaded wad slug shell that serves to regulate fired shotshell pressures and improve accuracy.|$|E

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{of the flow of}} suspensions of solids particles in gases at high flow velocities has been carried out. A literature survey into gas-solids flow at both low and high speeds has revealed that most of the existing work on high speed flows is of a theoretical nature and has been stimulated {{as a result of the}} presence of solids particles in the exhaust gases of solid-fuelled rocket engines. In this project theoretical approaches are presented for both idealised flows where the solids and gas are in equilibrium or maintaining constant fractional lag and also for the more realistic case of variable gas-solids velocity and temperature ratios where solutions require numerical integration by a digital computer. The experimental approach has been limited to the flow of polystyrene solids particles in air through a long 1 in. <b>nominal</b> <b>bore</b> pipe at flows ranging from almost incompressible to choked flows. Measurements of air and solids mass flow rates, air velocity profiles and solids velocities have been obtained.

40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{results obtained}} from an experimental programme {{to determine the}} explosion development characteristics of mixtures of vinyl chloride monomer (VCM) and carbon monoxide in oxygen plus nitrogen atmospheres. The main complex experimental pipe configuration and mixtures studied reproduced, as accurately as possible, a process configuration identical to that used in a real operational process plant. A commercial flame arrester device (nominal channel size 0. 475 mm) was also tested on occasions. The test pipe configurations used 300 mm <b>nominal</b> <b>bore</b> steel pipe. The main test series were conducted in a configuration that included three standard 1. 5 D bends, as part of on overall pipe length of ca. 20 m. In certain tests the flame arrester was placed after the third bend, furthest from the spark ignition source. Some initial commissioning tests were made using a single straight section, 4 m long. This allowed some overpressure development measurements of VCM mixtures to be compared with those for ethylene mixtures. In addition the flame acceleration characteristics of VCM/CO/O 2 /N 2 mixture in the full 20 m geometry have been quantified and compared to the behaviour observed with propane/O 2 /N 2 mixtures. For both fuels a distinct change in flame acceleration characteristics with reduced nitrogen content was observed.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{eccentricity}} on brush seal leakage at low rotational speeds were investigated. Included are the leakage results for ambient temperature air and nearly saturated streams at three different rotor eccentricities at both 0 and 400 rpm. A brush seal with a <b>nominal</b> <b>bore</b> diameter of 13. 647 cm. (5. 3730 in.) was used. It had a radial concentric interference of 0. 071 cm (0. 0028 in.) and a fence height of 0. 0927 cm (0. 0365 in.). There were 1060 bristles per centimeter of circumference (2690 bristles per inch of circumference). Rotor eccentricities of 0. 003, 0. 010, 0. 038, and 0. 043 cm (0. 001, 0. 004, 0. 015, and 0. 017 in.) were achieved by using bushings with different offsets. The results {{were compared with}} an annular seal model (FLOWCAL) for air and to a standard labyrinth seal model for steam. The annular seal model was also compared with a bulk flow model of a concentric brush seal in air. Large eccentricities did not damage the brush seals or their Haynes 25 bristles. However, the 304 stainless steel rotor did not show wear, indicating a harder surface is needed. Only the stream data showed hysteresis and were affected by shaft rotation. The brush seal had lower leakage rates than those predicted for comparable annular and labyrinth seals (conventional) {{because of the large}} clearances those seals require to accommodate large shaft excursions...|$|E
40|$|Successful {{rheological}} {{characterization of}} mineral slurries {{is fraught with}} many problems {{and the need to}} pump higher concentrations, especially in tailings disposal, has meant that more and more slurries exhibit non-Newtonian behaviour. Capillary tube viscometry is the preferred method of testing and apparently credible results obtained from stable &# 039;homogeneous&# 039; suspensions, containing particles with diameters of 10 s and 100 s of microns, are the rule rather than the exception. Settleable solids suspended in visco-plastic fluids may be stable in the un-sheared condition, but will stratify when the fluid is sheared. This behaviour results in an unobserved stratified flow within the conveying line. For small pipes, such as those used for rheological characterization, the stratified bed flow effect is small and is masked by the viscous nature of the suspending medium. Unfortunately, the stratified bed flow dominates the transport pressure gradients in larger pipes, resulting in often gross under-prediction of full size behaviour. To illustrate this effect, tests conducted with a non-Newtonian carrier fluid in 12 and 25 NB (<b>nominal</b> <b>bore)</b> pipes were found to be insensitive to the addition of large (- 1 mm) particles at concentrations up to 20 % w/w. Conversely, transport characteristics for these suspensions are a strong function of solids concentration in larger pipes, e. g 100 NB. Analysis presented in the paper shows that such behaviour is consistent with the behaviour of high viscosity stratified flows. In practice, tests would not be attempted with such large particles, which make the results obtained even more surprising. The behaviour casts doubts upon the validity of much of the capillary tube data obtained with &# 039;normal&# 039; slurry size distributions. This phenomenon needs to be understood, if the design of high concentration pumping systems for industrial slurries and pastes is to be performed with any certainty...|$|E
40|$|Two models {{recently}} {{developed at the}} University of Cape Town are intended to model the flow of high concentration backfill slurries. These models are the Cooke model for dense phase flow of cyclone classified tailings and the Paterson model for stabilised flow of high concentration full plant tailings. These two materials (cyclone classified tailings and full plant tailings) form the extremes, in terms of particle size distribution, of tailings materials used as backfill in South African gold mines. The purpose of this dissertation is to investigate the possibility of applying these models in the region, in terms of particle size distribution, between full plant tailings and cyclone classified tailings. Measured pressure gradient data has been collected for materials with particle size distributions ranging from full plant tailings to cyclone classified tailings. The calculated model predictions are then compared with the measured data {{in order to determine}} the range of applicability of the models. Three intermediate materials were made up by mixing full plant tailings and cyclone classified tailings in ratios of 1 to 2, 1 to 1 and 2 to 1. These, together with the cyclone classified tailings and two full plant tailings materials, provided the range of materials in terms of particle size distribution. The six materials are characterised in terms of relevant solid and particle properties. Measured pressure gradient data is then presented covering two pipe diameters (40 mm and 80 mm <b>nominal</b> <b>bore),</b> a range of solids concentrations (35 % to 52 % by volume) and a range of flow velocities (0. 5 to 4. 5 m/s). The models of Cooke and Paterson are reviewed. Model predictions are then calculated for comparison with the measured data. The range, in terms of solids concentration and particle size distribution, over which each model is in acceptable agreement with the measured data is then presented and reported as the range of applicability of the model...|$|E
