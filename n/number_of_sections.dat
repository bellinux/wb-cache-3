Simms' book was published {{a few months after}} Stowe's novel, and it contains a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>sections</b> and discussions disputing Stowe's book and her view of slavery. Hentz's 1854 novel, widely read at the time but now largely forgotten, offers a defense of slavery as seen {{through the eyes of a}} northern woman—the daughter of an abolitionist, no less—who marries a southern slave owner.|$|E
5|$|The walls never proved very {{successful}} as defensive structures, and were easily breached {{on more than}} one occasion. They served more as a means of controlling trade and taxing goods, and as a deterrent to smugglers. Throughout their history, the town walls of Edinburgh have served better in their role as a trade barrier than as a defensive one. By the mid 18th century, the walls had outlived both their defensive and trade purposes, and demolition of sections of the wall began. The Netherbow Port was pulled down in 1764, and demolition continued into the 19th century. Today, a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>sections</b> of the three successive walls survive, although none of the ports remain.|$|E

Additionally, an unknown editor produced the revised text {{at some point during}} the third stage.

25|$|George Bentham {{published}} his {{arrangement of the}} Banksia in his landmark 1870 publication Flora Australiensis. The number of recognised Banksia species was reduced to 46, and Meissner's four heterogeneous series were replaced by four sections based on leaf, style and pollen-presenter characters, taking the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>sections</b> to five. Three of these sections were fairly well-defined and homogeneous, while another, Orthostylis, was somewhat heterogeneous. The fourth, Cyrtostylis, was erected to contain the species that did not belong in the other sections, and was therefore highly heterogeneous. Despite these shortcomings, this arrangement would stand for over 100 years.|$|E
25|$|By 1989, {{there were}} 529 {{concrete}} towers {{along the length}} of the inner German border and a further 155 towers of steel and wood construction, as well as various little-used observation platforms in trees. The concrete towers were prefabricated from sections that could be assembled within a few days. Their height could be varied by reducing the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>sections</b> as required. They were connected to an electricity supply and telephone line and were equipped with a powerful 1,000-watt searchlight (Suchscheinwerfer) on the roof that could be directed at targets in any position around the watchtower. The windows could be opened to enable the guards to open fire without leaving the tower. In addition, the towers had firing ports emplaced in the side walls below the guard compartment.|$|E

25|$|Initially, the AFC {{raised its}} ground staff from {{volunteer}} soldiers and civilians who had previous experience or who were trade trained, {{and when the}} first AFC squadron was formed these personnel were provided with very limited training that was focused mainly upon basic military skills. As the war progressed, a comprehensive training program was established in which mechanics were trained in nine different trades: welders, blacksmiths, coppersmiths, engine fitters, general fitters, riggers, electricians, magneto-repairers, and machinists. Training was delivered by eight technical sections at Halton Camp. The length of training within each section varied, but was generally between eight to 12 weeks; the more complex trades such as engine fitter required trainees to undertake multiple training courses across a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>sections.</b> General fitters had the longest training requirements, receiving 32 weeks of instruction.|$|E
25|$|The reliefs {{were used}} as friezes {{at the top of}} a wall below the roof, and in other {{exterior}} locations, such as ridge tiles and antefixes, but also as decoration of interiors, typically with a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>sections</b> forming a horizontal frieze. They were produced in unknown quantities of copies from moulds and served as decoration for temples as well as public and private buildings, as cheaper imitations of carved stone friezes. They originated in the terracotta tiled roofs of the Etruscan temples. A wide variety of motifs from mythology and religion featured on the reliefs as well as images of everyday Roman life, landscapes and ornamental themes. Originally they were painted in colour, of which only traces of this occasionally remain. They were mainly produced in the region of Latium around the city of Rome, and their use was also largely limited to this area. Five distinct types were produced. Today examples are found in almost all major museums of Roman art worldwide.|$|E
25|$|The {{catalyst}} for the USA PATRIOT Act occurred on September 11, 2001 when terrorists attacked and destroyed the World Trade Center in New York City and {{the western side of}} the Pentagon near Washington D.C. Within a few weeks of the September 11 attacks, a number of bills attempting to make changes to anti-terrorism laws were introduced into Congress. After the USA PATRIOT Act was passed it remained controversial, and began to be questioned by some members of Congress. A <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>sections</b> were struck by the courts. Some provisions were challenged by the ACLU, who filed a lawsuit on April 9, 2004. In April 2005, a Senate Judicial Hearing on the Patriot Act was held. The Act was as controversial as ever, {{and more than a few}} groups were campaigning against it. Aside from the EFF, the ACLU, the CDT and the EPIC, the Act had raised the ire of the American Library Association (ALA) and the American Booksellers Foundation for Freedom of Expression, who were all extremely concerned about the provisions of the Patriot Act.|$|E

25|$|In {{order to}} develop the {{technique}} essential for creating designs that utilize an assortment of materials, the artist must first practice standardized styles. The classic standard Banmi Shofu Ryu designs are Moribana, Nageire, Chabana, Oseika and Gendaika. Ric Bansho also introduced a modern designed called Hashibana which comes in three expressions. These expressions are Maru (Global or spherical), Uate (tall and narrow) and Saba (low and narrow). Technical points that an artist needs to focus on when creating a design are: {{the length of the}} stems, degrees of slant, intentional space to be used, <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>sections</b> in the container, and whether the arrangement will be right or left-sided. Moribana, Nageire Keishatai, Oseika, and Banmi Shofu Chabana are only a few of such designs. Each design has its own characteristics, using particular flowers and specific arrangements styles, which may be appropriate for a certain environment such as a tearoom. The balance of the plants and flowers, combined with the appropriate container and spirit of the materials, creates a beautiful composition, which incorporates the naturalness of each design.|$|E
25|$|The Luftwaffe persisted with {{raids on}} the {{north-east}} coast of England. On 3 February it committed 24 He 111s from KG 26 {{and a pair}} of Junkers Ju 88s from Kampfgeschwader 30. Carey took off with a section of 43 Squadron—a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>sections</b> from the squadron had already scrambled— at 11:15. They intercepted He 111s bombing ships 15 miles off Tynemouth. Carey and his wingman, Sergeant Peter Ottewill engaged and downed a He 111, although it took the combined ammunition of both Hurricanes to do so. Ottewill headed off the He 111 while Carey attacked. When the German pilot attempted to climb for cloud cover, Ottewill joined the attack. The Heinkel landed on the sea with both engines stopped and sank. The pilot. Oberfeldwebel Fritz Wiemer, was later rescued and became a prisoner of war. The remainder died in a field hospital. The German attack sank three ships—Alexandria of unknown size and nationality, the Norwegian Tempo (629 tons) and the Greek Nicolau Zografia near the Farne Islands. Three He 111s were lost according to a German radio broadcast.|$|E
