40|$|Abstract — Dynamic Thermal Management (DTM) {{acts as a}} {{necessary}} tool for safe operation of systems and increases their lifetime; however, application of DTM affects system performance, and can significantly impact the quality of results of complex real-time applications such as real-time video encoders. In this paper, we propose a dynamic adaptation algorithm {{that can be used}} with an H. 264 encoder to change its complexity in real time, and hence adapt its computational needs to the dynamic changes in system performance due to DTM, while minimizing the impact on the quality and <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> of the encoded video. We formulate our dynamic adaptation approach as a multi-dimensional optimization problem that maximizes video quality and minimizes <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> while ensuring that the video encoder can run in real-time in spite of the DTM effects. We have implemented our adaptation algorithm with x 264, a very efficient and commonly used H. 264 encoder. We evaluated the adaptive encoder on a computing platform with Intel ® 1. 8 GHz Core TM 2 Duo processor, which employs DTM based on DVFS. Our measurements with several video clips reveal that because of the dynamic effects of DTM, the quality of videos encoded by x 264 are affected significantly- an average 10 dB reduction. However, with the aid of our dynamic adaptation algorithm, the x 264 encoder can encode all the streams in real-time, with an average video quality degradation of only 2. 4 dB, and with only a <b>nominal</b> increase in <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> of the encoded streams...|$|R

Secondly, the <b>nominal</b> <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> information is provided to all nodes in the same contention domain by considering the bandwidth sharing mechanism of 802. 11. Like ETX, our metric also calculates link delivery ratios that directly affect throughput and selects those routes that bypass dense regions in the network. Simulation results by NS- 2 show that IBETX gives 19 % higher throughput than ETX and 10 % higher than Expected Throughput (ETP).

40|$|International audience—It {{has been}} known that the {{throughput}} of the 802. 11 WLAN is {{much smaller than the}} <b>nominal</b> <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> offered when attempting to connect to an access point. A user may discover the quality of service offered by an access point only after taking the decision of which of the access points to connect to. In fact, the actual throughput of a user is a function of not only his channel state but also of that of the other connected users. This could likely lead to congestion and overload conditions in the Access Point (AP) in question (which offers the best signal strength) and all users would lose. The information available to users attempting to connect to an AP is thus misleading. In this paper, we develop a Nash-Bayesian game framework where users compete to maximize their throughput by picking the best locally serving radio access network (RAN) with respect to their own measurement, their demand and a partial statistical channel state information (CSI) of other users. We derive analytically the utilities perceived by users to obtain the equilibria. In particular, it is shown that equilibria strongly depend on the channel quality indicator...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{focus of}} this project will be on {{studying}} the behaviour of throughput changes of the cell when nodes send their data in different bit rate. The main goal of this thesis was to develop techniques and tools that can cope with multiple data rate, behaviour. The project involved the following goals: ·	Gain {{a deeper understanding of}} how 802. 11 / 802. 11 b works both at the PHY and MAC Layer. ·	Implementation of 802. 11 b extension in NS- 2. ·	Simulate maximum achievable throughput for one single UDP session ·	Analyse throughput, delay and jitter of a station with mobility. ·	Analyse throughput, delay and jitter of a station with mobility and pause time. ·	Analyse throughput, delay and jitter of one-hop behaviour where stations in a cell send their data with different bit rate. ·	Analyse throughput, delay and jitter of two-hop and three-hop behaviour where stations in a cell send their data with different bit rate. After conducting throughput analysis on simulation it is found that the throughput obtained by wireless node is much smaller then the <b>nominal</b> <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> of 11 Mbps. Co-existence between the fast and slow host in the radio channel decreases the performance of fast host considerably. The main reason for this is the basic CSMA/CA protocol. This access method guarantees that the long-term probability for accessing the channel is equal for all hosts, so when a slow host takes control of the medium for long time it penalizes the fast transmitting host. Furthermore if RTS-CTS mechanism is used it imposes additional delay as these packets are exchanged before any data packets are sent. In the case when there are flows with multi-hop, additional delay will be imposed and the packet drops in the intermediate nodes. This can stem from packet collisions or buffer overflows. However when there are multi-hop flows concurrently with on-hop flows sending at same data rate considerable decrease in throughput for one-hop flow will happen. In the case when there is different and lower data rate for multi-hop flow, it happens that in period the fast host captures the channel leading to starvation for the slower-flows...|$|E

In other words, the FDASH client has to wait 136  s (34 [*]×[*]D) to view the video at 1500  kbps. The SARA increases the client buffer level quickly by requesting many low <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> segments and requests a high <b>bit</b> <b>rate</b> segment {{when there is a}} sufficient buffer level.
