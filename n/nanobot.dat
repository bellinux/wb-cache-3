5|$|The season {{centers on}} Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) special agents Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{and her new}} partner John Doggett (Robert Patrick)—following the alien {{abduction}} and death of her former partner, Fox Mulder (Duchovny)—who work on cases linked to the paranormal, known as X-Files. In this episode, agent Mulder is buried. After the body of alien abductee Billy Miles (Zachary Ansley) revives before an autopsy, assistant director Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) orders Mulder's body to be exhumed. When Mulder's body is uncovered, weak vital signs are discovered. Meanwhile, rogue FBI agent Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea) uses a <b>nanobot</b> infection in Skinner's blood as leverage to make him kill Scully's unborn child. Eventually, Mulder is revived and reunites with Scully.|$|E
500|$|Shiban began {{crafting}} {{his story}} by borrowing a <b>nanobot</b> plot {{that had been}} considered by various writers for several seasons. Shiban {{and the rest of}} the writers made it a point to give Alex Krycek control over Skinner. In this manner, Skinner once again became a mysterious character, one whose true loyalties were being tested. Shiban noted that, [...] " [...] gives Skinner an agenda that Mulder doesn't know about [...] Which was something we ultimately used again in the seasonender , and will carry us into next year".|$|E
500|$|The video {{channels}} [...] "Nano of the North", {{an episode}} {{from the fourth}} season of The Powerpuff Girls, in which each Sugababes member portrays a Powerpuff Girl. The video opens with a clip of Professor Utonium driving in his car. Meanwhile, a dark cloud hovers over Townsville and it soon begins to rain and dissolves the town. When Professor Utonium arrives home, The Powerpuff Girls are shown watching the Sugababes on television, although the clip is interrupted with a News Flash that reads [...] "Robot Rain Terrorises Townsville". Professor Utonium manages to retrieve the Sugababes and infuses them with Chemical X. He shrinks them to a microscopic size, places them in a glass jar and drives off {{in the car with}} them. He exits the car but trips over, causing the jar to drop and break. The Sugababes, playing the roles of The Powerpuff Girls, fight off the Nanobots with their superpowers. However, a gigantic <b>Nanobot</b> soon appears, and subsequently defeats the Sugababes through superior strength. Professor Utonium witnesses the incident and crushes the <b>Nanobot</b> with his foot. The rain subsequently stops and the sun appears, in which the people of the town start to celebrate. When the Sugababes were questioned about their reaction to the video and its animation, group member Keisha Buchanan responded: [...] "It was so funny seeing us like that and the Powerpuff Girls cartoon itself. The video so much resembled our personalities with these three characters so it was very funny to watch actually." ...|$|E

Carl asked {{who was at the}} door and the <b>Nanobots</b> replied he had a telegram. Carl responded by saying that he wasn't falling for it, whereupon the <b>Nanobots</b> changed their offer to a llamagram (for which Carl proceed to open the door, only to get deleted by the <b>Nanobots).</b>|$|R

50|$|On the {{television}} show Red Dwarf, <b>nanobots</b> played a notable role in series VII to IX. <b>Nanobots</b> are nanotechnology created to be a self-repair system for androids like Kryten as they can also change anything into anything else. Kryten's <b>nanobots</b> grow bored of their duties and take over the ship Red Dwarf, leaving the crew to try and recapture it aboard the smaller Starbug. In the end the ship they are chasing is actually a smaller Red Dwarf built by the <b>nanobots</b> (which evaded their scanners in the end by coming aboard Starbug), with the rest being changed into a planet. Once the crew discover this and find the <b>nanobots,</b> they force them to rebuild Red Dwarf (as well as Dave Lister's then-missing arm). In the end the <b>nanobots</b> build an enhanced Red Dwarf based on the original design plans. They also resurrect the original full crew killed in the first episode.|$|R
500|$|Pileggi had {{to endure}} long bouts of make-up application. To create the {{principal}} illusion of monstrous veins, long black faux-veins were glued onto his face, arms, and torso. Pileggi, who had {{had to endure}} little to no make-up during the early seasons, noted that, [...] "They did a beautiful job and [...] looked awesome, but man, I hated it! I really don't know how those guys on Star Trek or Babylon 5 can stand having that done to them every day. I just wouldn't work if that's what it took". To show the <b>nanobot</b> infection progressing, special effects makeup supervisor John Vulich used two different make-up sets. The two sets were then mixed together electronically in post-production to give the effect of disease progression. The nanobots in the blood sample were designed on a computer and then cloned with an animation program. Composer Mark Snow's score for the episode was inspired by Daniel Sackheim's [...] "big-time feature-like action".|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} met with mixed to {{positive}} reviews from critics. Tom Kessenich, in his book Examination: An Unauthorized Look at Seasons 6–9 of the X-Files wrote positively of the episode, saying, [...] "'S.R. 819' re-established some wonderful conspiracy overtones and perhaps {{set the stage for}} more interesting developments in the future. It touched base with the very roots The X-Files sprung out of and did so in strong fashion." [...] Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club gave the episode a moderately positive review and awarded it a [...] "B". He enjoyed the plot, calling it [...] "fun", praised the twist ending, and called the <b>nanobot</b> makeup effects [...] "legitimately terrifying". He did, however, write critically of Skinner's role in the episode, noting that his lack of presence made the entry a [...] "disappointing one". In addition, VanDerWerff criticized the fact that the teaser shows Skinner dying; he wrote that [...] "here’s very little gas in the idea of Skinner dying" [...] and that most of the viewers knew he would not die.|$|E

50|$|Stephen embarks on {{a series}} of tests {{to find out exactly what}} the <b>nanobots</b> are capable of. Andy is {{submerged}} in water and unable to breathe, but the <b>nanobots</b> keep him alive. Things begin to go wrong when Andy wakes up the following day to find that the <b>nanobots</b> have responded to the tests by giving him gills, allowing him to breathe underwater in the future. After telling Stephen of this, they both agree that the <b>nanobots</b> must be deactivated immediately. Stephen is unsuccessful—he takes measure after measure to stop them, but he is never able to eradicate all of them.|$|R
50|$|Andy tells Stephen {{about the}} success of his machines. Stephen becomes {{concerned}} about what impact the <b>nanobots</b> may have on Andy's health—and about the possibility that he may go to prison for using an untested drug on another person. Stephen wants to deactivate the <b>nanobots,</b> but Andy tells him not to worry because Andy injected himself and Stephen is not responsible. Andy convinces him to leave the <b>nanobots</b> alone.|$|R
50|$|Stephen is {{ultimately}} unable to deactivate the <b>nanobots,</b> and Andy wants to die {{to keep his}} fiancée from seeing the monster he has become. Stephen kills Andy with electrocution and burns his laboratory, destroying any remaining <b>nanobots</b> and his research. The episode ends with Andy's grieving fiancée having cut her finger on a shattered photograph of him. The wound heals immediately, implying that the <b>nanobots</b> have spread to her as well.|$|R
2500|$|He {{appears in}} World War III. He tries {{to steal a}} missile, but leaves after realizing that he {{appeared}} before it was launched. Booster later appears before Steel and Natasha Irons, stealing the <b>nanobot</b> missile {{they were about to}} use on Black Adam, saying he needs it more than they and that it would not have worked for its original purpose anyway; Booster promptly disappears. During his time-hopping mission, he briefly stops in the far future, robbing the Dominators of an experimental weapon designed to deal with time travelers. Trying to explain his situation to the alien warlords, he makes them suspicious as they mistake his rant of [...] "having to save 52 worlds" [...] as a warning that the Earth and 52 unnamed worlds are going to invade them after Booster's raid.|$|E
2500|$|Nanorobotics is the {{emerging}} technology field of creating machines or robots whose components are at {{or close to}} the microscopic scale of a nanometer (10−9 meters). Also known as [...] "nanobots" [...] or [...] "nanites", they would be constructed from molecular machines. So far, researchers have mostly produced only parts of these complex systems, such as bearings, sensors, and synthetic molecular motors, but functioning robots have also been made such as the entrants to the <b>Nanobot</b> Robocup contest. Researchers also {{hope to be able}} to create entire robots as small as viruses or bacteria, which could perform tasks on a tiny scale. Possible applications include micro surgery (on the level of individual cells), utility fog, manufacturing, weaponry and cleaning. [...] Some people have suggested that if there were nanobots which could reproduce, the earth would turn into [...] "grey goo", while others argue that this hypothetical outcome is nonsense.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the heart}} of the series is a complex and cryptic storyline, which spawned {{numerous}} questions and discussions among viewers. Encouraged by Losts writers and stars, who often interacted with fans online, viewers and TV critics alike took to widespread theorizing in an attempt to unravel the mysteries. Theories mainly concerned the nature of the island, the origins of the [...] "Monster" [...] and the [...] "Others", the meaning of the numbers, and the reasons for both the crash and the survival of some passengers. Several of the more common fan theories were discussed and rejected by the show's creators, the most common being that the survivors of Oceanic flight 815 are dead and in purgatory. Lindelof rejected speculation that spaceships or aliens influenced the events on the island or that everything seen was a fictional reality taking place in someone's mind. Carlton Cuse dismissed the theory that the island was a reality TV show and the castaways unwitting housemates, and Lindelof many times refuted the theory that the [...] "Monster" [...] was a <b>nanobot</b> cloud similar to the one featured in Michael Crichton's novel Prey (which happened to share the protagonist's name, Jack).|$|E

To create these <b>nanobots,</b> Edwin needs a molecular assembler, which he steals. With the help of Kendrick James (LeVar Burton), Ginny (Mylène Dinh-Robic) and Ingrid Jensen (Patricia Richardson), Matt and Claire use chemical traces of gold and silicon to track down the location of the assembler. They are misled, but Brody (Justin Kelly), and his new friend from the Project, Samantha (Alyssa Diaz), manage to trace Edwin through a voice tracker and retrieve the molecular assembler. Brody is caught and implanted with <b>nanobots.</b> Edwin threatens to kill Brody with the <b>nanobots</b> if the molecular assembler is not returned to him.
