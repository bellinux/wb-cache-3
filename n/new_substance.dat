Priestley visited Lavoisier in October 1774 and told him about his experiment and how he liberated the new gas. Scheele also posted a letter to Lavoisier on September 30, 1774 that described his discovery of the previously unknown substance, but Lavoisier never acknowledged receiving it (a copy of the letter was found in Scheele's belongings after his death).|$|E
5|$|As well as copper, a <b>new</b> <b>substance</b> was found, {{extracted}} and exploited: {{this was}} variously called wad, black lead, plumbago or black cauke, {{and is now}} known as graphite. Many uses were quickly discovered for the mineral: it reduced friction in machinery, made a heat-resistant glaze for crucibles, and when used to line moulds for cannonballs, resulted in rounder, smoother balls that could be fired further by English naval cannon. Later, from {{the second half of the}} 18th century, it was used to make pencils, for which Keswick became famous.|$|E
5|$|Command & Conquer {{is set in}} an {{alternate}} timeline, after a meteorite crashed near the river Tiber in Italy in 1995. The meteorite brings with it an extremely toxic alien substance called Tiberium, which becomes extremely valuable because {{of its ability to}} absorb and crystallize precious metals from the surrounding soil. An ancient, cultic secret society called the Brotherhood of Nod claims to have foreseen the potentials of this <b>new</b> <b>substance,</b> investing in the development of technology to harvest and refine Tiberium crystals ahead of the scientific community.

40|$|The {{increasing}} number of <b>new</b> psychoactive <b>substances</b> made available for recreational drug use has created a challenge for clinical toxicology and drug testing laboratories. As a consequence, the routine immunoassay drug testing may become less effective due to an increased occurrence of false negative and false positive screening results. This work aimed to extend the knowledge about analytical cross-reactivity of <b>new</b> <b>substances</b> in selected CEDIA, EMIT, and KIMS immunoassays for drugs-of-abuse screening. Urine standards were prepared by spiking blank urine with 45 <b>new</b> <b>substances.</b> Authentic urine samples from intoxication cases identified by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) were also studied. Several <b>new</b> psychoactive <b>substances</b> were demonstrated to display cross-reactivity in the immunoassays. CEDIA Amphetamine/Ecstasy and EMIT d. a. u. Amphetamine Class tests showed the highest reactivity towards the new drugs, which was expected since many have amphetamine-like structure and activity. In the samples from authentic cases, five <b>new</b> <b>substances</b> displayed 100 % detection rate in the CEDIA Amphetamine/Ecstasy test. In conclusion, cross-reactivity data in routine urine drug screening immunoassays {{for a number of}} <b>new</b> psychoactive <b>substances</b> not studied before were reported. In both spiked and authentic urine samples, some <b>new</b> <b>substances</b> showed significant cross-reactivity and are thus detectable in the routine screening methods.

5|$|The American Medical Association (AMA) {{opposed the}} act because the tax was imposed on {{physicians}} prescribing cannabis, retail pharmacists selling cannabis, and medical cannabis cultivation and manufacturing; instead of enacting the Marihuana Tax Act the AMA proposed cannabis {{be added to}} the Harrison Narcotics Tax Act. This approach was unappealing to some legislators who feared that adding a <b>new</b> <b>substance</b> to the Harrison Act would subject that act to new legal scrutiny. Since the federal government had no authority under the 10th Amendment to regulate medicines, that power being reserved by individual states in 1937, a tax was the only viable way to legislate marijuana.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} {{compound}} of chlorine, sodium chloride, {{has been known}} since ancient times; archaeologists have found evidence that rock salt was used as early as 3000 BC and brine as early as 6000 BC. Its importance in food was very well known in classical antiquity and was sometimes used as payment for services for Roman generals and military tribunes. Elemental chlorine was probably first isolated around 1200 {{with the discovery of}} aqua regia and its ability to dissolve gold, since chlorine gas is one of the products of this reaction: it was however not recognised as a <b>new</b> <b>substance.</b> Around 1630, chlorine was recognized as a gas by the Flemish chemist and physician Jan Baptist van Helmont.|$|E

On the basis of an evaluation of recent research in this area, the present report proposes what is considered to be an improvement of the RIVM Assessment System for <b>New</b> <b>Substances.</b> Being aware of a persisting high degree of uncertainty in the model estimate, it is recommended to use the biotransfer factor correlations with Kow as determined by Travis & Arms (1988) to estimate the concentration of a substance in meat and dairyproducts. Concerning the uptake of chemicals in plants from soil, it is suggested to estimate the stem concentration factor from the Kow using the extrapolation method based on the experimental work of Briggs et al.
