50|$|The <b>Nursing</b> <b>Interventions</b> <b>Classification</b> (NIC) is a care {{classification}} system which describes {{the activities that}} nurses perform {{as a part of}} the planning phase of the nursing process associated with the creation of a nursing care plan.|$|E
5000|$|Once {{a patient}} and nurse agree of the diagnoses, {{a plan of}} action can be developed. If {{multiple}} diagnoses need to be addressed, the head nurse will prioritise each assessment and devote attention to severe symptoms and high risk patients. Each problem is assigned a clear, measurable goal for the expected beneficial outcome. For this phase, nurses generally refer to the evidence-based Nursing Outcome Classification, which is a set of standardised terms and measurements for tracking patient wellness. The <b>Nursing</b> <b>Interventions</b> <b>Classification</b> may also be used as a resource for planning.|$|E
40|$|Objective: {{to analyze}} the {{distribution}} of nursing professionals' workloads, according to the <b>Nursing</b> <b>Intervention</b> <b>Classification</b> (NIC), during the transoperative period at a surgical center specializing in oncology. Methods: this was an observational and descriptive cross-sectional study. The sample consisted of 11 nurses, 25 nursing technicians who performed a variety of roles within the operating room, 16 nursing technicians who worked with the surgical instrumentation and two nursing technicians from patient reception {{who worked in the}} surgical center during the transoperative period. An instrument was developed to collect data and the interventions were validated according to NIC taxonomy. Results: a total of 266 activities were identified and mapped into 49 <b>nursing</b> <b>interventions,</b> seven domains and 20 classes of the NIC. The most representative domains were Physiological-Complex (61. 68 %) and Health System (22. 12 %), while the most frequent interventions were Surgical Care (30. 62 %) and Documentation (11. 47 %), respectively. The productivity of the nursing team reached 95. 34 %. Conclusions: use of the <b>Nursing</b> <b>Intervention</b> <b>Classification</b> contributes towards the discussion regarding adequate, professional nursing staffing levels, because it shows the distribution of the work load...|$|R
40|$|Our {{premise is}} that from the {{perspective}} of maximum flexibility of data usage by computer-based record (CPR) systems, existing nursing classification systems are necessary, but not sufficient, for representing important aspects of “what nurses do. ” In particular, we have focused our attention on those classification systems that represent nurses' clinical activities through the abstraction of activities into categories of <b>nursing</b> <b>interventions.</b> In this theoretical paper, we argue that taxonomic, combinatorial vocabularies capable of coding atomic-level nursing activities are required to effectively capture in a reproducible and reversible manner the clinical decisions and actions of nurses, and that, without such vocabularies and associated grammars, potentially important clinical process data is lost during the encoding process. Existing <b>nursing</b> <b>intervention</b> <b>classification</b> systems do not fulfill these criteria. As background to our argument, we first present an overview of the content, methods, and evaluation criteria used in previous studies whose focus has been {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} existing coding and classification systems. Next, using the Ingenerf typology of taxonomic vocabularies, we categorize the formal type and structure of three existing <b>nursing</b> <b>intervention</b> <b>classification</b> systems—Nursing <b>Interventions</b> <b>Classification,</b> Omaha System, and Home Health Care Classification. Third, we use records from home care patients to show examples of lossy data transformation, the loss of potentially significant atomic data, resulting from encoding using each of the three systems. Last, we provide an example of the application of a formal representation methodology (conceptual graphs) which we believe could be used as a model to build the required combinatorial, taxonomic vocabulary for representing <b>nursing</b> <b>interventions...</b>|$|R
50|$|It is {{endorsed}} by the American Clinical Laboratory Association and the College of American Pathologists. Since its inception, the database has expanded to include not just medical laboratory code names but also <b>nursing</b> diagnosis, <b>nursing</b> <b>interventions,</b> outcomes <b>classification,</b> and patient care data sets.|$|R
50|$|In {{agreement}} with the client, the nurse addresses each of the problems identified in the diagnosing phase. When there are multiple nursing diagnoses to be addressed, the nurse prioritizes which diagnoses will receive the most attention first according to their severity and potential for causing more serious harm. For each problem a measurable goal/outcome is set. For each goal/outcome, the nurse selects nursing interventions that will help achieve the goal/outcome. A common method of formulating the expected outcomes {{is to use the}} evidence-based Nursing Outcomes Classification to allow for the use of standardized language which improves consistency of terminology, definition and outcome measures. The interventions used in the <b>Nursing</b> <b>Interventions</b> <b>Classification</b> again allow for the use of standardized language which improves consistency of terminology, definition and ability to identify nursing activities, which can also be linked to nursing workload and staffing indices. The result of this phase is a nursing care plan.|$|E

Method: a documentary research study to perform cross mapping. A probabilistic, simple random sample composed of 67 records of patients with Parkinson's disease who participated in a rehabilitation program, between March of 2009 and April of 2013. The research was conducted in three stages, in which the nursing terms were mapped to natural language and crossed with the <b>Nursing</b> <b>Interventions</b> <b>Classification.</b> Results: a total of 1, 077 standard interventions that, after crossing with the taxonomy and refinement performed by the experts, resulted in 32 interventions equivalent to the <b>Nursing</b> <b>Interventions</b> <b>Classification</b> (NIC) system. The NICs, "Education: The process of the disease. ", "Contract with the patient", and "Facilitation of Learning" were present in 100 % of the records.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Nursing {{interventions}} are any care based on nurses' judgment and clinical knowledge, {{based on a}} scientifically supported action, carried out and planned for patients' benefit. These {{are very important to}} control pain since pain, when inadequately treated, affects {{the quality of life of}} patients and caregivers in physical, psychological, social and spiritual dimensions. So, this study aimed at identifying nursing interventions to handle pain and whether they relate to those proposed by the <b>Nursing</b> <b>Interventions</b> <b>Classification.</b> CONTENTS: This is an integrative literature review, carried out in LILACS, Scielo and Medline databases. Nine articles published between 2001 and 2011 were selected. These articles describe nursing interventions to handle pain in different contexts.

40|$|ABSTRACT Sharon Ann Milligan USING THE <b>NURSING</b> <b>INTERVENTIONS</b> <b>CLASSIFICATION</b> (NIC) TO CODIFY THE NURSING ACTIVITIES OF ADVANCED BEGINNER, COMPETENT/PROFICIENT, AND EXPERT NURSES There is an {{increasing}} {{awareness of the need}} to achieve interoperability, the capability of different clinical documentation systems to communicate with each other. This sharing of data can only be achieved by the implementation of structured terminologies, such as the <b>Nursing</b> <b>Interventions</b> <b>Classification</b> (NIC). The classification of nursing data will enable nursing practice to be measured consistently. A nursing research study on the complexity of nursing provided a unique opportunity for the secondary analysis of actual observed nursing activities. An evaluation of these activities was conducted to determine if the NIC could be used to code the data. Observational data from two advanced beginner nurses, two competent/proficient nurses, and two expert nurses were coded with the NIC by two health informatics graduate students. The agreement between coders in the identification of a nursing intervention, unitizing inter-rater reliability, was calculated as 91. 55 %. The consistency of coding between coders, interpretive inter-rater reliability, was calculated as 75. 60 %. The results of this study show that the flexibility inherent {{in the design of the}} NIC can pose issues in the consistent assignment of interventions to the observed nursing activities.

40|$|The Association des Infirmières et Infirmiers du Canada (AIIC) (2008), defines Advanced Practice Nursing (APN), as “an {{advanced}} level of nursing practice that maximizes {{the use of}} specialized skills and nursing knowledge in order {{to respond to the}} customers’ needs in health’s sphere". APNs’ programs, were initially introduced in the 1960 s to fulfil gaps both in services traditionally carried by physicians, in order to improve access to care particularly in under-served services and contexts by doctors (Delamaire & Lafortune 2010), and also as a consequence to the reduction of physicians’ and resident doctors hours internationally (Dowling et al. 2013; Olson & Chioffi 2005; Por 2008). Despite that, advanced practice is still being unclear due to the differences related to health settings and policies (Gardner et al. 2007). In the recent years, it has been introduced the concept of ‘complex chronic disease’, which is linked to the concept of aging and frailty, and determined by the presence of multiple and complex chronic conditions. The most differential characteristics of this group of people are the presence of several chronic diseases concurrently, multiple admissions in hospital emergency services in the same year, the presence of certain diseases such as heart failure or Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), polypharmacy and reduced personal autonomy. In addition, there are additional factors such as older age, living alone or not having enough family support and being in risk of falling, among others (Contel et al. 2012). In this sense, the APN is in an ideal position to cover the necessities of this population group. Case management and telemonitoring could be essential to the success in the developing of individualized care plans to improve chronic patients’ health status (Contel et al. 2012; Carroll et al. 2007; Clark et al. 2010). Moreover, several models of APN attention have been developed {{in a wide variety of}} heath contexts in the elderly population (Oeseburg et al. 2009; Low et al. 2011), with remarkable outcomes in terms of effectiveness. Examples of those models could be those in transitional care (Brand et al. 2004), case management (Leung et al. 2004) or heart diseases (Blaha et al. 2000; Duffy et al. 2010) to improve quality of life or reduce rehospitalizations. Also, APN carried out interventions in patients that suffered dementia (Callahan et al. 2006), with older people with low incomes and acute health problems (Counsell et al. 2007), or in the community, giving support to families and patients to manage resources (Thompson et al. 2008). However, there is a deficit of conceptual frameworks to characterize and describe the range of interventions and services by APNs in the older population (Morales Asencio 2010). In this sense, the availability of a standardized language to describe <b>nursing</b> <b>interventions</b> (<b>Nursing</b> <b>Intervention</b> <b>Classification,</b> NIC) (Bulecheck GM et al. 2008; Thoroddsen 2005) can provide an additional resource to classify the components of different APN models and could facilitate the description of APN in a universal language, available in a vast majority of health care record systems around the world. Aims: The aims of this thesis are: 1. To identify, assess and summarise available scientific evidence about the effect of interventions deployed by APNs when providing care to older people in different settings (hospital, home, outpatient, residential). 2. To describe the roles and components of the interventions developed by APNs in the contexts mentioned before. 3. To identify the interventions provided by APNs to older people in different contexts (acute and long-term care) with a Standardized Nursing Language, in the studies included in the Systematic Review. Design: The present study was divided in two parts: firstly, a systematic review, and secondly, a qualitative with mixed methods study. Methods: Systematic review: Data Sources: Sixteen electronic databases were consulted (1990 - 2010). The research also included reviews, papers, reports and evaluations from research health services centres and Health Technology Agencies. Review Methods: Studies that met inclusion criteria were reviewed for quality, using RevMan 5 application’s checklist of bias, together with the methodological quality criteria of the Cochrane COPD group. Qualitative study Quotes of the interventions carried out by advanced practice nurses were codified by experts into the <b>Nursing</b> <b>Intervention</b> <b>Classification.</b> A content analysis was carried out, followed by a Delphi technique Results: Systematic review: Eleven studies were included. They were classified depending on the follow-up period, and also on the scope of the advanced practice nursing services. In both cases, integrative, multi-component and continuous advanced practice nursing care, reduced readmissions, improved patients’ self-care and quality of life, as well as increased patients’ and caregivers’ satisfaction. Qualitative study: In total 73 different interventions codified in the <b>Nursing</b> <b>Intervention</b> <b>Classification</b> were extracted from the studies in different care contexts, with a clear predominance of interventions related to the Behavioural and Health care system domains, which could be explained due to the need of improving the psychosocial functioning and self-care of these patients to lead them to preserve their quality of life. Conclusion: Advanced practice nurses seems to be crucial to improve the health status of elderly people, which main characteristic is to bear with chronic diseases, in almost every care context. Moreover, Advanced Practice Nurses’ interventions could be considered as complex but with the use of standardized nursing languages as the <b>Nursing</b> <b>Intervention</b> <b>Classification,</b> they can be better described, reported and analysed along different contexts. Moreover, core elements of the APNs’ roles can be identified and they could be used for delineating or remodelling services.
