5|$|Command & Conquer {{features}} two sub-plots {{based on}} the two playable factions of the game. Commanding the Global Defense Initiative's troops, the player becomes instrumental in eliminating Nod's European forces. Under the command of General Mark Jamison Sheppard, the player completes missions that range from securing a beach, to rescuing civilians and scientists, to defending GDI bases from <b>Nod</b> assaults. Combat occurs in countries of Central and Eastern Europe. A major plot element is an international scandal caused by a <b>Nod</b> media manipulation, which convinces {{the world that the}} GDI deliberately attacked and massacred the Polish city of Białystok. This leads to a cut in GDI funding, forcing the player to play several missions with limited forces. Finally, the player besieges the Temple of <b>Nod</b> in Sarajevo, Bosnia, which Kane uses as his main base of operations.|$|E
5|$|Command & Conquer {{requires}} the player {{to construct a}} base and to gather resources in order to fund the production of buildings, technologies, and combat units to attack and conquer an opponent's base. The game contains two playable factions: the Global Defense Initiative (GDI) and the Brotherhood of <b>Nod.</b> GDI units are sturdy and powerful, but expensive. Meanwhile, <b>Nod</b> armies {{are made up of}} a mix of cheap and numerous units, mixed in with unusual units such as rocket bikes and stealth tanks. As a result, GDI focuses on large-scale strategic attacks, while <b>Nod</b> creates bigger armies and uses unconventional tactics. There are roughly fifty units and structures in total. Tiberium, the game's sole resource, is gathered by harvester units that carry it to a refinery structure for processing. When the player constructs buildings, additional units and structures become available for purchase. Command & Conquer features two single-player campaigns, one each for the GDI and <b>Nod</b> factions. The objective of most campaign missions is to destroy or take control of enemy buildings. The missions begin with live-action full motion video (FMV) cutscenes.|$|E
5|$|Following {{a series}} of {{international}} terrorist bombings that culminate {{in the destruction of}} the fictional Grain Trade Center in Vienna – attacks which are quickly attributed to the Brotherhood of <b>Nod</b> - the United Nations Security Council realizes that Kane and <b>Nod</b> are commencing a global campaign of terrorism, and authorises the Global Defense Initiative to intervene on its behalf,setting a conflict in motion that escalates into a world war.|$|E
40|$|<b>Nodding</b> syndrome, a {{so called}} new and mysterious illness, is {{affecting}} children {{in parts of}} South-Sudan, Uganda, and Tanzania. During the past decade more and more attention went out to this unknown illness from international media and scientists. Despite the growing amount of literature on <b>nodding</b> syndrome, {{little is known about}} how <b>nodding</b> syndrome is affecting Tanzania. This anthropological study into <b>nodding</b> syndrome therefore focused on <b>nodding</b> syndrome in Tanzania, using a social constructionist approach. The construction of <b>nodding</b> syndrome in Tanzania is a complex process in which many different actors, discourses, and practices interact. This thesis shows how <b>nodding</b> syndrome in Tanzania is constructed through the friction that arises in the encounters between these different actors, discourses, and practices. Friction leads to continuous shifts in meaning of <b>nodding</b> syndrome in Tanzania, particularly visible in the encounters between actors constructing <b>nodding</b> syndrome internationally and the specific context of <b>nodding</b> syndrome in Tanzania...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we examine the}} {{relationship}} between specific head movement events – head <b>nods,</b> often treated as prosodic boundary markers – and syntactic units in Finnish (FinSL) and Swedish Sign Language (SSL). In the study we investigated the alignment of head <b>nods</b> with syntactic units {{on the basis of a}} total of 20 (10 + 10) FinSL and SSL narratives. The results of the study show that in both languages head <b>nods</b> appeared similarly on syntactic boundaries and that the tendency was to align <b>nods</b> sentence-finally. However, not all head <b>nods</b> behaved this way: for example, a relatively large number of head <b>nods</b> were also found to occur sentence-initially or elsewhere in the sentence. Furthermore, head <b>nods</b> occurring on syntactic boundaries also had non-boundary marking functions, and not all syntactic boundaries occurred with head <b>nods...</b>|$|R

5|$|Command & Conquer {{is set in}} an {{alternate}} timeline, after a meteorite crashed near the river Tiber in Italy in 1995. The meteorite brings with it an extremely toxic alien substance called Tiberium, which becomes extremely valuable because {{of its ability to}} absorb and crystallize precious metals from the surrounding soil. An ancient, cultic secret society called the Brotherhood of <b>Nod</b> claims to have foreseen the potentials of this new substance, investing in the development of technology to harvest and refine Tiberium crystals ahead of the scientific community. <b>Nod</b> soon controls nearly half of the supply and uses these assets to sustain a rapidly growing army of followers worldwide. The group is led by a self-proclaimed messianic figure known only as Kane.|$|E

5|$|As a new recruit in the Brotherhood of <b>Nod,</b> {{the player}} {{initially}} performs tasks for the Brotherhood's second-in-command, a man known as Seth. After Seth attempts to deploy the player in an operation against the United States military without Kane's approval, Kane kills him and thereafter issues commands to the player directly. The player's {{goal is to}} drive GDI forces out of North Africa {{through the use of}} both conventional and unconventional warfare. In a ploy to secure victory for <b>Nod,</b> the player is assigned to gain control of GDI's space-based ion cannon, and to establish Nod's Temple in South Africa. The campaign ends with the entire African continent under Nod's control, and with the Brotherhood planning to achieve the same in Europe. The conclusion of the campaign allows the player to choose a historical landmark to destroy with GDI's hijacked ion cannon, in order to shatter GDI's public image. Potential targets include the White House, the British Houses of Parliament, the Eiffel Tower and the Brandenburg Gate.|$|E

Stars Henriksen and Brittany Tiplady were nominated for several acting awards for their work on the season—a Golden Globe Award <b>nod</b> for Henriksen and two Young Artist Award nominations for Tiplady. In addition, series cinematographer Robert McLachlan was nominated for two American Society of Cinematographers awards during the season. Ultimately none of these nominations proved successful.|$|E
