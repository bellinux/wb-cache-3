5|$|Regarding A. p. piscivorus, {{an early}} account by Stejneger (1895) {{described}} a pair in the Berlin Zoological Garden that mated on January 21, 1873, after which eight <b>neonates</b> {{were discovered in}} the cage on July 16 of that year. The young were each 26cm in length and 1.5cm thick. They shed {{for the first time}} within two weeks, after which they accepted small frogs, but not fish.|$|E
5|$|SFTPA2 genetic variants, SNPs, haplotypes, {{and other}} genetic {{variations}} {{have been associated}} with acute and chronic lung disease in several populations of <b>neonates,</b> children, and adults. Mutations in the SFTPA2 gene are found in patients with interstitial lung disease and lung cancer. SFTPA2 mutations also associated with pulmonary fibrosis via mechanisms that involve protein instability and endoplasmic reticulum stress.|$|E
5|$|A few {{accounts}} {{exist that}} describe females defending their newborn litters. Wharten (1960, 1966) reported several cases where females found near their young stood their ground and considered these to be examples of guarding behavior. Another case {{was described by}} Walters and Card (1996) in which a female was found {{at the entrance of}} a chamber with seven <b>neonates</b> crawling on or around her. When one of the young was moved a short distance from the chamber, she seemed to be agitated and faced the intruder. Eventually, all of her offspring retreated into the chamber, but the female remained at the entrance, ready to strike.|$|E
40|$|To assess growth, {{health and}} {{behaviour}} of the <b>neonate.</b> To confirm neonatal maturity.

KEY POINTS 1. Skin to skin contact and breastfeeding are the priority in the first hour of the well <b>neonate.</b> As soon as possible after this, providing the temperature is stable, the examination should be performed. 2. The examination must be delayed if the <b>neonate</b> is cold or unwell. 3.

40|$|We {{report a}} 13 -day-old {{exclusively}} breastfed <b>neonate,</b> admitted {{with a history}} of fever, poor feeding, lethargy and decreased urine output. The mother had history of lactation failure. The <b>neonate</b> had severe hypernatremia, acute renal failure and metabolic acidosis. Renal ultrasound was normal, but the sodium level in mother′s milk was 96 mEq/L (normal 7 ± 2 mEq/L). The <b>neonate</b> required peritoneal dialysis {{on the second day of}} admission. The biochemical investigations gradually returned to normal and the <b>neonate</b> was discharged on day 12 of admission.

40|$|AbstractEsophageal {{perforation}} in the <b>neonate</b> is uncommon but {{requires a}} prompt diagnosis {{in order to}} prevent further complications. We describe a case of a premature <b>neonate</b> presenting with bloody oropharynx aspirate after orogastic tube placement. Findings on plain film radiograph were consistent with esophageal perforation. Due to the patient's hemodynamic stability, the patient was treated non-operatively with favorable results.

5|$|A {{persistent}} thyroglossal duct is {{the most}} common clinically significant congenital disorder of the thyroid gland. A persistent sinus tract may remain as a vestigial remnant of the tubular development of the thyroid gland. Parts of this tube may be obliterated, leaving small segments to form thyroglossal cysts. Preterm <b>neonates</b> are at risk of hypothyroidism as their thyroid glands are insufficiently developed to meet their postnatal needs. In order to detect hypothyroidism in newborn babies, to prevent growth and development abnormalities in later life, many countries have newborn screening programs at birth.|$|E
5|$|Gestational period varies among bovids - while duiker {{gestation}} {{ranges from}} 120 to 150 days, gestation in African buffalo ranges from 300 to 330 days. Usually, a single offspring is born (twins are less frequent), {{and it is}} able to stand and run by itself within an hour of birth. In monogamous species, males assist in defending their young, {{but that is not the}} case in polygynous species. Most newborn calves remain hidden for a week to two months, regularly nursed by their mothers. In some bovid species the <b>neonates</b> start following about their mothers immediately or within a few days, as in the impala. Different bovids have different strategies for defence of juveniles. For instance, while wildebeest mothers solely defend their young, buffaloes exhibit collective defence. Weaning might occur as early as two months (as in royal antelope) or as late as a year (as in muskox).|$|E
5|$|In 1975, it was {{reported}} that during the excavation of a medieval cemetery in Kings Worthy, England, fetal remains appeared to lie within the birth canal of the skeleton of a young woman, with the fetal cranium external to the pelvic outlet and between the two femora (thigh bones) and the fetal leg bones clearly within the pelvic cavity. Other cases of coffin birth at archaeological sites have been described, such as in 1978 at a Neolithic site in Germany, at a medieval site in Denmark in 1982, and in 2009 at an Early Christian period site at Fingal, Ireland. A coffin birth was also described in a 2011 episode of the BBC show History Cold Case, featuring the Roman era remains of a woman and three <b>neonates</b> discovered near Baldock, Hertfordshire. Another was identified in 2006 in a 14th-century Black Death cemetery in Genoa, Italy.|$|E
40|$|Despite {{improved}} diagnositc {{and therapeutic}} measures, neonatal septicemia {{continues to be}} a major clinical problem. Improvement in the management of the septic <b>neonate</b> should result from application of the increasing information being learned of the neonatal host defense mechanisms. The earlier concept that the <b>neonate</b> was “immunologically null” can now be discarded. Evidence summarized in this review has established that the <b>neonate</b> can marshal an immune response to most antigens and infectious agents...|$|R
40|$|Junctional ectopic {{tachycardia}} (JET) is {{a common}} arrhythmia in postoperative pediatric patients after open-heart surgery for congenital heart defects. This arrhythmia is life-threatening and mechanisms of this arrhythmia are not yet clear. Isolated working hearts from <b>neonate</b> rabbits were administered P-adrenergic agonists alone or with antagonists under normal or ischemia-reperfusion stunned conditions. The effect of the sodium hydrogen exchanger inhibitor HOE 642 on the recovery of ischemia-reperfusion stunned leA ventricle was tested, the potential for P-adrenergic agonist-induced arrhythmogenesis on the stunned <b>neonate</b> hearts was examined as well. We found that dopamine has a positive chronotropic, and a negative inotropic effect on the isolated <b>neonate</b> rabbit heart. Furthermore, dopamine has an arrhythmogenic effect on the ischemia-reperfusion stunned <b>neonate</b> myocardium. Finally, it was shown that HOE 642 has a significant protective effect on contractile function in the <b>neonate</b> myocardium on recovery from ischemia-reperfusion stunning, but was not robust in its antiarrhythmic effect...|$|R
40|$|Paper {{presented}} to the 7 th Annual Symposium on Graduate Research and Scholarly Projects (GRASP) held at the Marcus Welcome Center, Wichita State University, May 4, 2011. Research completed at the Department of Communication Sciences and Disorders and School of NursingThe {{purpose of this study}} was to assess the reliability of coding mother-neonate interactions. Two coders independently examined videos of two mother-neonate dyads and coded five interactions: mother looking at <b>neonate's</b> face, mother smiling at <b>neonate,</b> mother joggling <b>neonate,</b> mother talking to <b>neonate,</b> and mother touching <b>neonate.</b> High inter-rater reliability was predicted for the first three interactions, which were presumed easy to identify and measure. Reliability analysis of 1, 427 interactions revealed that the two coders agreed less than would be expected by chance alone. This suggests that the process was highly dependent on the individual coders. Reevaluating current coding methods will be essential to develop meaningful standards for reliable coding, which in turn should help us better understand mother-neonate bonding...|$|R
5|$|Most bovids are diurnal. Social {{activity}} and feeding usually peak during dawn and dusk. Bovids typically rest before dawn, during midday, and after dark. They have various methods of social organisation and social behaviour, which are classified into solitary and gregarious behaviour. Bovids use {{different forms of}} vocal, olfactory, and tangible communication. Most species alternately feed and ruminate throughout the day. While small bovids forage in dense and closed habitat, larger species feed on high-fiber vegetation in open grasslands. Most bovids are polygynous. Mature bovids mate {{at least once a}} year and smaller species may even mate twice. In some species, neonate bovids remain hidden for a week to two months, regularly nursed by their mothers; in other species, <b>neonates</b> are followers, accompanying their dams, rather than tending to remain hidden.|$|E
5|$|The {{circumcision}} procedure causes pain, and for <b>neonates</b> {{this pain}} {{may interfere with}} mother-infant interaction or cause other behavioral changes, so the use of analgesia is advocated. Ordinary procedural pain may be managed in pharmacological and non-pharmacological ways. Pharmacological methods, such as localized or regional pain-blocking injections and topical analgesic creams, are safe and effective. The ring block and dorsal penile nerve block (DPNB) are the most effective at reducing pain, and the ring block {{may be more effective}} than the DPNB. They are more effective than EMLA (eutectic mixture of local anesthetics) cream, which is more effective than a placebo. Topical creams have been found to irritate the skin of low birth weight infants, so penile nerve block techniques are recommended in this group.|$|E
5|$|The {{giant otter}} is an {{especially}} noisy animal, with a complex repertoire of vocalizations. All otters produce vocalizations, but by frequency and volume, the giant otter {{may be the most}} vocal. Duplaix identified nine distinct sounds, with further subdivisions possible, depending on context. Quick hah barks or explosive snorts suggest immediate interest and possible danger. A wavering scream may be used in bluff charges against intruders, while a low growl is used for aggressive warning. Hums and coos are more reassuring within the group. Whistles may be used as advance warning of nonhostile intent between groups, although evidence is limited. Newborn pups squeak to elicit attention, while older young whine and wail when they begin to participate in group activities. An analysis published in 2014 cataloged 22 distinct types of vocalization in adults and 11 in <b>neonates.</b>|$|E
30|$|When {{we operate}} total laparoscopic hysterectomy, we couldn’t adapt the {{traditional}} colpotomizer system because of bicervical anomaly. To accomplish these difficulties, {{we used a}} <b>neonate</b> sucker instead of traditional colpotomizer designed for single cervical uterus. The <b>neonate</b> rubber sucker make us to be done successfully laparoscopic colpotomy. The entire procedure was done laparoscopically and the uterus was removed vaginally. From our own experience, laparoscopic hysterectomy with rubber <b>neonate</b> sucker to facilitate anatomic delineation of vagina fornix is a worthwhile measure.|$|R
40|$|The immune {{response}} of the <b>neonate</b> is poor and is dependent on passive immunity provided by maternal Ig. However, here we show that exposure of the <b>neonate</b> to environmental antigens induces a germinal center (GC) reaction.

These data suggest that restrictions in the repertoire rather than immaturity {{of the immune system}} is responsible for the poor {{immune response}}s of the <b>neonate...</b>|$|R

5|$|This {{species is}} ovoviviparous, with females {{giving birth to}} one to 16 live young and {{possibly}} as many as 20. However, litters of six to eight are the most common. <b>Neonates</b> are 22–35cm in length (excluding runts), with the largest being A. p. conanti and A. p. leucostoma the smallest. If weather conditions are favorable and food is readily available, growth is rapid and females may reproduce at {{less than three years}} of age and a total length of as little as 60cm. The young are born in August or September, while mating may occur during any of the warmer months of the year, at least in certain parts of its range.|$|E

40|$|During development, {{the cardiac}} «i-adrenergic chronotropic {{response}} changes from positive in the <b>neonate</b> to negative {{in the adult}}. The negative chronotropic effect of a,-adrenergic stimulation in the adult depends on maturation of sympathetic innervation {{and the presence of}} a pertussis toxin (PT) -sensitive guanine nucleotide-binding (G) protein. To examine the possibility of a developmental change in coupling of a PT-sensitive G protein to the <*,-adrenergic receptor, radioligand binding experiments with the iodinated ^-selective radioli-gand [l 25 I]-I- 2 -[/ 3 -(4 -hydroxyphenyl) ethylaminomethyl]tetralone ([I 25 I]-IBE 2254) were per-formed on membranes prepared from control and PT-treated neonatal and adult rat hearts. Scatchard analysis showed fewer aradrenergic receptors in the adult than in the <b>neonate</b> (168 ± 10 fmol/mg protein in the <b>neonate</b> vs. 124 ± 13 fmol/mg protein in the adult), but similar affinities (equilibrium dissociation constant 124 ± 29 pM in the <b>neonate</b> vs. 140 ± 34 pM in the adult).

25|$|Inhaled {{nitric oxide}} is {{contraindicated}} {{in the treatment}} of <b>neonates</b> known to be dependent on right-to-left shunting of blood. This is as the nitric oxide decreases the pulmonary circulation's resistance by dilating pulmonary blood vessels. The increased pulmonary return increases pressure in the left atrium, causing closure of the foramen ovale and reducing the blood flow through the ductus arteriosus. Closing these shunts can kill <b>neonates</b> with heart malformations that rely on the right-to-left shunting of blood.|$|E

25|$|Neonatal sidewinders {{engage in}} a {{remarkable}} behavioral homeothermy {{that has not been}} observed in any other type of snake. Following birth, the <b>neonates</b> mass together in their natal burrow. Most often, gravid females select an east-facing, small-diameter rodent burrow for giving birth. For the first week or so of their lives, neonatal sidewinders literally plug the entrance to this burrow during daylight hours, forming a dynamic multiple-individual mass that takes advantage of the hot exterior environment and the cool interior of the burrow to maintain an average aggregate temperature of 32°C (the optimal temperature for shedding). The dynamic mass of <b>neonates</b> modifies the thermal environment at the burrow entrance such that the young can occupy a location that would ordinarily become lethally hot for an individual neonate (or even an adult). Because of the constant movements of the <b>neonates,</b> the aggregate assumes stable temperature properties reminiscent of a homeothermic organism (i.e., maintains tight temperature tolerance ± 2°C).|$|E
