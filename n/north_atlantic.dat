5|$|The <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> {{oscillation}} is an atmospheric phenomenon {{affecting the}} weather in Western Europe. When the atmospheric pressure variations in the <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> are large, the springs in Europe are warmer. This brings forward the northward migration of those bird species (including the goldcrest) that winter mainly within western or southern Europe. A general climatic change resulting in more frequent positive <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> oscillation events has led to earlier spring migration of these short-distance migrants since the 1980s. The warmer spring weather brings on plant growth, thus preparing the habitat for returning migrants. The effect is greatest in western and central Europe.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not known}} for certain why the {{albatrosses}} became extinct in the <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic,</b> although rising sea levels due to an interglacial warming period {{are thought to have}} submerged the site of a short-tailed albatross colony that has been excavated in Bermuda. Some southern species have occasionally turned up as vagrants in the <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> and can become exiled, remaining there for decades. One of these exiles, a black-browed albatross, returned to gannet colonies in Scotland for many years in an attempt to breed.|$|E

5|$|This petrel is only {{present in}} Madeiran waters during the {{breeding}} season. Its distribution at sea {{during the rest}} of the year is poorly known due to the rarity of the species and the difficulty of separating it from other Pterodroma petrels at sea. Birds identified as either Zino's or Fea's have been recorded from both sides of the <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic,</b> and in Ireland and Britain there has been a large increase in the number of reports, perhaps because global warming brings increasing numbers of tropical species into temperate waters. The timing of the reports, mainly in late spring and summer in the western <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic,</b> and in late summer and early autumn in the east, has suggested that birds follow a clockwise route around the <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> after leaving their breeding sites. However, the few birds that have been identified with certainty have all been Fea's. Zino's petrel may have a similar strategy, since preliminary results from geolocation studies indicate widespread dispersal over the <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> central ridge during the breeding season, and migration towards the Brazilian coast in the non-breeding period. Pterodroma petrels have been recorded in the Canary Islands and the Azores on surprisingly few occasions; a claim of possible Zino's from South Africa is now thought to be erroneous.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To detect single {{nucleotide}} polymorphisms (SNPs) in the cod transferrin gene by comparing the sequences from Norwegian (<b>North</b> East <b>Atlantic</b> Ocean) and Canadian (<b>North</b> West <b>Atlantic</b> Ocean) specimen, and to quantify the genetic variation and differentiation in East and West Atlantic cod populations. Methods: cDNA sequences between individuals of Canadian (<b>North</b> West <b>Atlantic</b> Ocean) and Norwegian (<b>North</b> East <b>Atlantic</b> Ocean) origin were aligned. Allele frequencies of the SNPs were used to discriminate the different Atlantic cod populations in West/East Atlantic Ocean, and the Baltic Sea. Results: The sequence alignment detected 19 SNPs, of which 18 of them resulted in amino acid changes in the transferrin protein. Nonsynonymous to synonymous site substitution ratio (dn/ ds) was by far greater than 1 providing an evidence {{for the existence of}} positive selection. The West Atlantic cod populations showed high values of heterozygosity and the Baltic populations were found to be inbred. Conclusions: This study identified and indicated transferrin gene polymorphisms {{that can be used for}} population differentiations...|$|R
