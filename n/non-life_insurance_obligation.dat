40|$|The {{impact of}} {{insurance}} market activity within financial development is gaining more attention in academia, as the sector experiences growth within emerging markets. This paper aims to understand which macro-economic and social variables impact the growth or {{decline of the}} <b>non-life</b> <b>insurance</b> sector broadly across Africa, {{with a view to}} provide recommendations to drive increased penetration across the region. The study examines the explanatory factors of <b>non-life</b> <b>insurance</b> demand in Africa, using annual data from 1990 to 2013 on 28 countries. Using Fixed Effects Panel Data Regression, the study finds that: levels of income, and unemployment rates have a significant negative impact on <b>non-life</b> <b>insurance</b> demand; whilst population growth rates, and the level of private sector credit (to GDP) positively impacted <b>non-life</b> <b>insurance</b> demand. Urbanisation rates, and levels of merchandise trade had statistically insignificant effects on <b>non-life</b> <b>insurance</b> demand. Since these variables only explained about 11 % of the variation in the dependent variable, the study suggests that further research into the cultural and institutional (ie. Legal / regulatory) dynamics is required to improve our understanding of what conditions would stimulate <b>non-life</b> <b>insurance</b> demand in future...|$|R

40|$|This paper investigates market {{structure}} of life <b>insurance</b> and <b>non-life</b> <b>insurance</b> industry in Thailand. This paper uses the Concentration Ratio and the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index {{to measure the}} degree of market concentration. The paper also analyzes various data from all type of insurance premium, balance sheet and income statement to measure the concentration and competition trend. An analysis of life insurance premium, group market is unconcentrated where as ordinary and industry markets are concentrated. As for the life insurance balance sheet and income statement are concentrated market. An analysis of <b>non-life</b> <b>insurance</b> premium, fire, marine and transportation and automobile markets are unconcentrated. As for the <b>non-life</b> <b>insurance</b> balance sheet and income statement are unconcentrated market. In terms of the same sub-categorized product, personal accident and health insurance have difference concentrate degree. Personal accident in life insurance is near monopoly and highly concentrated market while personal accident in <b>non-life</b> <b>insurance</b> is loose oligopoly and moderate concentrated market. Health insurance in life and <b>non-life</b> <b>insurance</b> are tight oligopoly and concentrated market. The results conclude that the life insurance industry is more concentrated than the <b>non-life</b> <b>insurance</b> industry. In both segments of the insurance market, {{as well as in}} the overall insurance sector, there is a downward trend in market concentration, which indicates the success of the competition promoting process which allows a greater and better choice for customers...|$|R

40|$|An optimal asset {{allocation}} {{is crucial for}} <b>non-life</b> <b>insurance</b> companies. The most previous studies focused on this topic use a mono-objective technique optimization. This technique usually allows the maximization of shareholders’ expected utility. As <b>non-life</b> <b>insurance</b> company is a complex system, it has many stakeholders other than shareholders. So, the satisfaction of the shareholders’ expected utility cannot lead usually {{to the satisfaction of}} other stakeholders’ objectives. Therefore, the focus on utility maximization can be a destruction source of other objectives such as productivity, competitiveness and solvency. Our developed model integrates simulation approach with a Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm. This model insures an optimal {{asset allocation}} that maximizes, simultaneously, shareholders expected utility and technical efficiency of European <b>non-life</b> <b>insurance</b> companies. The empirical application conducts a comparison between the attained results with multi-objective optimization technique and mono-objective technique to search the optimal asset allocation for <b>non-life</b> <b>insurance</b> companies. Our results show that the investment portfolio will be more diversified between most available investment assets. In addition, any decision maker should take account of different stakeholders’ objectives. Accordingly multi-objective optimization allows us to find the best asset allocation that maximizes simultaneously expected utility and technical efficiency of <b>non-life</b> <b>insurance</b> companies. ...|$|R

40|$|Insurance {{is defined}} as an {{economic}} device to reduce or eliminate risks, by transferring the risks from individuals to insurance companies. The development of the insurance market {{is important for the}} economy through protecting assets, capital mobilisation and promoting trade. Knowledge of consumer behavior in the insurance market is important in understanding customer needs and wants. Demand for insurance is driven by many factors across the world, chief among them demographic, social, cultural and institutional factors. While several studies have been conducted to explain demand for life insurance, very little has been done for <b>non-life</b> <b>insurance.</b> Nevertheless, most of the studies to date have been concentrated in developed countries. This research investigates the demand for <b>non-life</b> <b>insurance</b> in Harare, the latter being a developing country set up. The aim of the study is to examine the determinants of demand for <b>non-life</b> <b>insurance.</b> To achieve this, a cross-sectional survey was conducted on 120 respondents drawn from buyers of <b>non-life</b> <b>insurance</b> products from six insurance companies in Harare. The data were collected through questionnaires and analysed using descriptive statistics, ANOVA and Pearsonâ€™s correlation coefficient and t-tests using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS). The major findings of the study indicate that income, age, education and legal compulsion variables are positively related to demand for <b>non-life</b> <b>insurance.</b> Income was found to be the strongest predictor of the demand for <b>non-life</b> <b>insurance.</b> There is no evidence from the survey on the positive influence of personal and cultural variables.

40|$|In old {{accounting}} tradition, <b>non-life</b> <b>insurance</b> {{companies have}} estimated nominal claims reserves for their outstanding loss liabilities.

As a consequence <b>non-life</b> <b>insurance</b> companies need to consider discounted claims reserves {{and they need to}} yearly adjust these claims reserves for the outstanding loss liabilities according to the latest information available.

40|$|The authors {{study the}} {{relationship}} between the development of insurance, and contractual savings, (the assets and portfolio composition of pension funds, and life and <b>non-life</b> <b>insurance</b> companies) and the development of stock markets (market capitalization and value traded). Their contribution lies in providing cross-country, and time-series on a hypothesis that is very popular - but had not been substantiated - among supporters of funded pension systems, and insurance in which reserves are largely invested in tradable securities (equities and bonds). The authors presenta three-assets model (money, quasi money, and shares) to study the effects of the development of contractual savings (pension funds and life <b>insurance</b> companies) and <b>non-life</b> <b>insurance</b> companies on assets market equilibrium, and on stock market development. They use an unbalanced panel of 21 OECD, and 5 developing countries, and an error components two-stage least squares (EC 2 SLS) estimator, including a test for endogeneity of these institutional investors. The results support the hypothesis that contractual savings, and <b>non-life</b> <b>insurance</b> companies can be treated as exogenous to the development of stock markets; that contractual savings and <b>non-life</b> <b>insurance</b> companies, as well as their portfolio policies, promote stock market development as measured by stock market capitalization, and value traded as a share of GDP. The results show that stock market capitalization is positively correlated with the return on stocks, the assets of contractual savings and <b>non-life</b> <b>insurance</b> companies, the shares of stocks in the portfolios of contractual savings and <b>non-life</b> <b>insurance</b> companies, and the value traded stocks. Stock market capitalization is negatively correlated with the real interest rate, the real return on money (measured by the inverse of inflation), and stock market volatility. Stock market value traded is positively correlated with the shares of stocks in the portfolios of contractual savings and <b>non-life</b> <b>insurance</b> companies, and the real return on money. It is negatively correlated with the real interest rate. The authors conclude that insurance and contractual savings are powerful instruments for developing stock markets, providing depth and liquidity. Higher liquidity, in turn, further promotes market capitalization. Economic Theory&Research,Insurance&Risk Mitigation,Contractual Savings,Financial Intermediation,Banks&Banking Reform...|$|R
