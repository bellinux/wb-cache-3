"Heartbreak Hotel" [...] was {{the second}} song Presley {{recorded}} at RCA Victor, following [...] "I Got a Woman", during his debut session at 1525 McGavock Street in Nashville on January 10, 1956. Presley arrived at the studio with the song ready to record without seeking RCA's approval, and although producer Steve Sholes was <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> would be a success, he recorded [...] "Heartbreak Hotel" [...] believing that Presley {{knew what he was}} doing. Recording at RCA Victor was a different experience for Presley and his band, who were used to a more relaxed atmosphere at Sun Studio. Guitar player Scotty Moore later commented, [...] "It was a larger studio than Sun's and more regimented - they called everything by a tape number. We would sit around at Sun, eat hamburgers and then somebody would say, 'Let's try something.'" ...|$|E

Senator John Kerry said a [...] "long suspension" [...] would be [...] "appropriate {{to pay a price}} on the airwaves but I'm <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was appropriate to say you're off forever." ...|$|E

2500|$|The final document, engrossed by Jacob Shallus, {{was taken}} up on Monday, September 17, at the Convention's final session. Several of the delegates were {{disappointed}} in the result, a makeshift series of unfortunate compromises. Some delegates left before the ceremony, and three others refused to sign. Of the thirty-nine signers, Benjamin Franklin summed up, addressing the Convention: [...] "There are several parts of this Constitution which I do not at present approve, but I am not sure I shall never approve them." [...] He would accept the Constitution, [...] "because I expect no better and because I am <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is not the best".|$|E

6000|$|... "Thanks," [...] said Denham, as if {{he meant}} it. [...] "You were not very extravagant, Jimmy, as young men go, and we have hitherto, at least, always stood by each other. Still, I'm <b>not</b> <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>it's</b> my son I can count on now." ...|$|R
