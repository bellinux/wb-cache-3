5|$|On December 31, 1840 the pre-fabricated {{pendulum}} {{house was}} assembled. Axes and chisels cut away the rock surface for the pendulum's base. It took another {{three days to}} adjust the clock {{to the point where}} the experiments could begin. However, the high winds made so much <b>noise</b> <b>that</b> the ticks could often not be heard, and varied the temperature to make measurements inaccurate. Grass had to be painstakingly brought from the lowest elevations for insulation to get accurate measurements.|$|E
5|$|Soldiers at {{the base}} noticed warning signs, {{including}} groups of men watching the construction from the nearby village, which was set at a higher elevation than the outpost, and other groups of men moving through nearby mountains. At a dinner meeting in the village, a villager told the Americans that they should shoot any men seen in the mountains, and asked them if U.S. UAVs were keeping watch nearby. The day before the attack, the militants began flowing water through an irrigation ditch feeding an unused field, creating background <b>noise</b> <b>that</b> masked {{the sounds of the}} advancing fighters.|$|E
5|$|Communications signals {{can be sent}} {{either by}} analog signals or digital signals. There are analog {{communication}} systems and digital communication systems. For an analog signal, the signal is varied continuously {{with respect to the}} information. In a digital signal, the information is encoded as a set of discrete values (for example, a set of ones and zeros). During the propagation and reception, the information contained in analog signals will inevitably be degraded by undesirable physical noise. (The output of a transmitter is noise-free for all practical purposes.) Commonly, the noise in a communication system can be expressed as adding or subtracting from the desirable signal in a completely random way. This form of noise is called additive noise, with the understanding that the noise can be negative or positive at different instants of time. <b>Noise</b> <b>that</b> is not additive noise is a much more difficult situation to describe or analyze, and these other kinds of noise will be omitted here.|$|E

5|$|In a B plot, Andy (Chris Pratt) {{is doing}} well in his new job as the Pawnee shoeshiner, and Ron pays for a shine. Ron is {{impressed}} when Andy actually eases the pain from his bunion, and he later purposely scuffs his shoe {{so he can get}} a second shine. Andy is initially flattered, but starts to grow uncomfortable when Ron returns for a third shoeshine. This time, Ron makes an involuntary <b>noise</b> <b>that</b> sounds like a sexual moan, seriously embarrassing both men. After a day of avoiding each other, Ron and Andy discuss the noise and decide {{it would be best to}} simply pretend it never happened.|$|E
5|$|Singing also occurs {{outside the}} {{breeding}} season, taking place {{throughout the year}} apart from the moulting period. The songsters are more commonly male although females also sing on occasion. The function of such out-of-season song is poorly understood. Eleven other types of call have been described including a flock call, threat call, attack call, snarl call and copulation call. The alarm call is a harsh scream, and while foraging together common starlings squabble incessantly. They chatter while roosting and bathing, making {{a great deal of}} <b>noise</b> <b>that</b> can cause irritation to people living nearby. When a flock of common starlings is flying together, the synchronised movements of the birds' wings make a distinctive whooshing sound that can be heard hundreds of metres (yards) away.|$|E
5|$|From 1920 John Carson, {{also working}} for AT, {{began to develop}} a new way of looking at signals using the {{operational}} calculus of Heaviside which in essence is working in the frequency domain. This gave the AT engineers a new insight into the way their filters were working and led Otto Zobel to invent many improved forms. Carson and Zobel steadily demolished many of the old ideas. For instance the old telegraph engineers thought of the signal as being a single frequency and this idea persisted into the age of radio with some still believing that frequency modulation (FM) transmission could be achieved with a smaller bandwidth than the baseband signal right up until the publication of Carson's 1922 paper. Another advance concerned the nature of noise, Carson and Zobel (1923) treated noise as a random process with a continuous bandwidth, an idea that was well ahead of its time, and thus limited the amount of <b>noise</b> <b>that</b> it was possible to remove by filtering to that part of the noise spectrum which fell outside the passband. This too, was not generally accepted at first, notably being opposed by Edwin Armstrong (who ironically, actually succeeded in reducing noise with wide-band FM) and was only finally settled with the work of Harry Nyquist whose thermal noise power formula is well known today.|$|E

5|$|Rolling {{stock on}} the New York City Subway {{produces}} {{high levels of}} <b>noise</b> <b>that</b> exceed guidelines set by the World Health Organization and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. In 2006, Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health found noise levels averaged 95 decibel (dB) inside subway cars and 94dB on platforms. Daily exposure to noise at such levels {{for as little as}} 30 minutes can lead to hearing loss. Noise on one in 10 platforms exceeded 100dB. Under WHO and EPA guidelines, noise exposure at that level is limited to 1.5 minutes. A subsequent study by Columbia and the University of Washington found higher average noise levels in the subway (80.4dB) than on commuter trains including Port Authority Trans-Hudson (PATH) (79.4dB), Metro-North (75.1dB) and Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) (74.9dB). Since the decibel scale is a logarithmic scale, sound at 95dB is 10 times more intense than at 85dB, 100 times more intense than at 75dB, and so forth. In the second study, peak subway noise registered at 102.1dB.|$|E

25|$|Normally, the {{benefits}} of noise reduction far outweigh aesthetic impacts for residents protected from unwanted sound. These benefits include lessened sleep disturbance, improved ability to enjoy outdoor life, reduced speech interference, stress reduction, reduced risk of hearing impairment, {{and a reduction in}} the elevated blood pressure created by <b>noise</b> (<b>that</b> improves cardiovascular health).|$|E
