40|$|Gray mold neck rot was {{observed}} on onion bulbs (Allium cepa L.) in low–temperature warehouses in Changnyeong–gun, Korea. The causative pathogen was isolated from rotted onion bulb lesions and identified as Botrytis aclada based on morphological and culture characteristics, the sequences of three nuclear genes (G 3 PDH, HSP 60, and RPB 2), and polymerase chain reaction–restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR–RFLP) for Botrytis spp. identification.

The bulbs may be affected by splitting, white <b>rot,</b> and <b>neck</b> <b>rot.</b> Shanking is a condition in which the central leaves turn yellow and the inner part of the bulb collapses into an unpleasant-smelling slime. Most of these disorders are best treated by removing and burning affected plants. The larvae of the onion leaf miner or leek moth (Acrolepiopsis assectella) sometimes attack the foliage and may burrow down into the bulb.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A {{number of}} Botrytis species are {{pathogens}} of bulb crops. Botrytis squamosa (teleomorph= Botrytotinia squamosa) causal agent of botrytis leaf blight and B. allii the causal agent of botrytis <b>neck</b> <b>rot</b> {{are two of}} the most important fungal diseases of onion. The taxonomics of several of the <b>neck</b> <b>rot</b> pathogens of onion have been revised on the basis of recent molecular sequence analysis studies. B. allii, B. aclada, and B. byssoidea are now recognized as distinct species causing <b>neck</b> <b>rot</b> <b>diseases</b> of onion. B. cinerea is also pathogenic on onion, primarily causing botrytis brown stain on onion bulbs. B. tulipae, B. elliptica, and B. gladiolorum are important pathogens of flower bulbs and are the causal agents of leaf blight in tulip, lily, and gladiolus, respectively. Leaf blight in the major flower bulb crops is called ‘fire’ referring to the fire-like symptoms occurring on the leaves of flower bulb plants when epidemics occur in production fields. In both the onion and flower bulb production systems chemicals are still heavily relied upon to control the major diseases, however, alternative disease management systems also are used and undoubtedly will become increasingly important in controlling the diseases. Infected plants and colonized plant debris are considered important sources of inoculum for B. squamosa, B. tulipae, and B. elliptica, particularly when sclerotia are formed. Sclerotia of B. squamosa serve as the source of conidia, as well as apothecia producing ascospores, in onion production areas in New York. The primary inoculum sources of B. allii and B. gladiolorum are believed to be infested seed and infected corms, respectively...|$|R

40|$|Aims: To {{determine}} {{the role of}} phenazines (PHZ) and lipopeptide surfactants (LPs) produced by Pseudomonas in suppression of stem <b>rot</b> <b>disease</b> of groundnut, caused by the fungal pathogen Sclerotium rolfsii. Methods and Results: In vitro assays showed that PHZ-producing Pseudomonas chlororaphis strain Phz 24 significantly inhibited hyphal growth of S. rolfsii and suppressed stem <b>rot</b> <b>disease</b> of groundnut under field conditions. Biosynthesis and regulatory mutants of Phz 24 deficient in PHZ production were less effective in pathogen suppression. Pseudomonas strains SS 101, SBW 25, and 267, producing viscosin or putisolvin-like LPs, only marginally inhibited hyphal growth of S. rolfsii and did not suppress stem <b>rot</b> <b>disease.</b> In contrast, Pseudomonas strain SH-C 52, producing the chlorinated LP thanamycin, inhibited hyphal growth of S. rolfsii and significantly reduced stem <b>rot</b> <b>disease</b> of groundnut in nethouse and field experiments, whereas its thanamycin-deficient mutant was less effective. Conclusions: Phenazines and specific lipopeptides {{play an important role}} in suppression of stem <b>rot</b> <b>disease</b> of groundnut by root-colonizing Pseudomonas strains.

Few methods have been applied in leaf <b>rot</b> <b>disease</b> detection for betel vine leaf (Piper Betel L.).
