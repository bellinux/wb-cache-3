40|$|Maritime {{transportation}} involves shipping {{goods and}} people across water bodies in vessels. It {{serves as a}} crucial social and economic function. Currently more than 80 % {{of the world trade}} is transported by sea. Among the waterways of the world maritime transportation, Baltic Sea {{is one of the major}} maritime highways despite the ice conditions of the area in winters. Winter navigation in the Baltic Sea has become more common in the past few decades in both ship independent navigation and with icebreaker assistance. However, for reasons ranging from harsh ice conditions to human error, a significant number of accidents has occurred in Baltic Sea winter navigation. Consequently, these accidents have caused environmental as well as property damages. The Baltic Sea is prone to critical ecological disasters in case of accidents. As a result, the need for careful risk management is very high. This thesis focused on certain accidents types related to oil spills in the winter periods in Northern Baltic Sea. In this thesis the conditions under which accidents occur were identified by detecting accident locations, operation types of navigational assistance during the occurrence of the accident, environmental conditions and traffic volume in the area. Moreover, correlations between variables in accident occurrences were identified. The data quality and effects it has on results of the data mining was evaluated. The thesis utilized AIS data, accident database and navigational, sea ice and environmental conditions data. Animation video was used to identify accidents and related condition. Visual data mining was used to discover dependencies between the variables. Common visual data mining techniques such as parallel coordinate plot, scatter plot, scatter plot matrix, Cell plots and maps were used to test their suitability in mining of maritime accident data. The quality of the data was evaluated using data quality measures such as accuracy, consistency, completeness and reliability. This thesis revealed that linking AIS data with accident data and other data to understand the <b>navigational</b> <b>condition</b> the vessels had at the time of the accident can only be successful when there is complete and accurate data. Animation video is a useful tool for recreating the situation the accidents occurred in using accident data, AIS data as well as sea ice condition data but the process of watching videos and recording findings is cumbersome and time consuming. Low data volume and poor data quality lead to weak accident analysis results...|$|R
40|$|This report summarises visual {{shipboard}} ice observations {{carried out}} during leg ARK 17 / 2 of RV Polarstern in August and September 2001, operating along the Gakkel Ridge {{and at the}} North Pole. Data on general ice <b>conditions,</b> <b>navigational</b> information as well as photographs taken from the ships bridge are presented. Although most data are subject to large uncertainties due to the different experience of observers, they provide a general and quite representative overview of recent summer conditions in the Transpolar Drift, as seen from a ship. The data and photographs might be of interest as background information for discussions of recent changes of Arctic sea ice, and for comparisons with observations performed in other years. For {{those who have not}} seen a sea ice landscape so far, this report might yield first impressions of what the Arctic sea ice cover looks like. For scientists working on remote sensing, modelling, or other aspects of sea ice, the report provides some ground-truth and boundary conditions for their work in the summer of 2001. Ice conditions were characterised by very easily penetrable ice {{in the first half of}} the cruise, west of 30 °E. There were many large leads with ice concentrations ranging between only 60 and 90 %. Only from late August onwards, and east of 30 °E, narrower leads and ice concentrations above 90 % were observed. At that time, also new ice started to form on the leads. In the late period, sometimes the ship became beset in convergent ice conditions. Initially, melt ponds were observed to cover 10 to 30 % of the ice surface. The ponds were ice covered already when we entered the ice in early August. However, the pond ice cover was thick enough to step on (> 0. 05 m) only after about August 20. Melt ponds became snow covered for some period, before they were visible again. Only after mid-September air temperatures permanently dropped below 0 °C, and no snow or surface melting was observed any more...|$|R
50|$|The {{conclusion}} of the report {{indicated that there was}} a lack of rigour in maintaining the prescribed safe altitude, inaccurate dead reckoning, lack of cross-checking the information of the radio altimeter and barometric altimeter, and improper use of airborne weather radar as an additional ease of navigation, all of which contributed to the disaster. The bad meteorological conditions on the day (which included clouds, moderate to heavy winds, with turbulence) and the lack of autonomous navigational aids aboard the aircraft (such as GPS), that could have determined their position, were also factors that contributed to the accident. In regards to the aircraft, the report determined that the ATP was operating within the <b>navigational</b> <b>conditions</b> correspondent to the regulations and approved procedures outlined by aeronautical authorities.|$|E

50|$|On May 6, 1987, the Tae Woong #603, a 210 ft, 1,500-ton South Korean fishing boat, ran aground on {{the east}} side of the island. Although the crew of 49 was quickly rescued by the United States Coast Guard, the ship was too far {{grounded}} to be salvageable. Officials worried about the effect the 120000 gal of diesel fuel on the ship, which was leaking from a ruptured fuel tank at a rate of more than 1300 gal per hour, could have on the wildlife in the area (Uliaga and the entire Islands of Four Mountains group are protected as part of the Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge). By the morning of May 8, the ship had leaked well over 16000 gal of oil and a slick spread more than 1.9 mi around the vessel, which had acquired a 15-degree list to starboard. Fortunately, the shipwreck had occurred a few weeks before the horned puffin population had returned to the island for the summer, though the leaking fuel could potentially affect the 500,000 to 1 million migratory birds that resided on Chagulak Island, 40 mi to the west, if not cleaned up quickly. On May 11, the US Office of Response and Restoration and the ship's South Korean owners declared the vessel a total loss and decided to eliminate the oil slick and the remaining fuel on board by blowing it up with high explosives. They concluded that the other option of transferring the remaining fuel on the ship to another vessel would be impossible due to the hazardous <b>navigational</b> <b>conditions</b> around the island and the time that would be required to implement the plan. The ship was detonated on May 13 and the slick and remaining fuel were successfully eliminated. The wreck was determined to be the result of navigational error.|$|E

A typical search engine results page layout suffers from a hierarchical bias with higher fixations on the top and lower fixations on the bottom areas of interest (Granka et al., 2004; Joachims et al., 2005; Dumais et al., 2010; Curtell et al., 2007; Guan et al., 2007). This study compared the usability and eye movement data of participants searching a traditional SERP layout and two alternative layouts, grid and tabular. Results showed that while participants indicated a higher preference for the traditional layout, no differences in success, satisfaction, mental workload, or perceived difficulty were found across the 3 layouts for either informational or navigational tasks. Participants were found to look at the page more times and for longer when completing informational tasks compared to navigational tasks regardless of the layout presented to them. Participants looked at the top portion of the page more than the bottom when presented with the traditional or the tabular layout in both the task conditions. For the informational task condition, the top portion of the page was viewed for longer and for the <b>navigational</b> task <b>condition,</b> the bottom portion of the page was view for longer for both the traditional and the tabular layouts. When presented with the grid layout, participants were found to view the content vertically by column starting on the left column, then to the right: the left column was viewed more than the right column but the right column was viewed for longer than the left column regardless of the task condition. Moreover, it was found that participants fixated on the right column of the grid layout {{more than twice as much}} as they fixated on the bottom portion of the traditional layout. Compared to the bottom portion of the tabular layout, participants fixated 50 % more on the right column of the grid layout. This, along with its scroll-less interface, shows the advantage of the grid layout over both the traditional and the tabular layouts. In terms of layout preference, participants equally preferred the traditional and the grid layout. It was found that the tabular layout was the easiest for the participants to parse out what element of the search results they wanted to fixate to effectively complete the given task: this meant that participants could fixate on the title and the text snippet portion of the search result and ignore the URL portion while completing informational tasks and in the same manner participants could fixate on the URL and the title and ignore the text snippet more effectively than on the traditional or the grid layouts when completing navigational tasks. This shows the advantage of the tabular layout when the user is interested in a specific type of information. The advantage of the uniqueness of their layouts may have potential with their application in proper contexts...|$|R

40|$|One of the {{significant}} limitations of inland waterway transport on the Oder River is the water level. Its variability determines the minimum clearance under the bridges and thus the maximum drought of moving vessels. An important factor affecting the water level in the Oder River is the phenomenon of wind backwater. Certain pressure field distribution situations may affect in an increase of water level on the coast and thereby block the outflow of river waters. In this paper {{an example of the}} limitations of inland navigation in the estuarine part of the Lower Oder under the weather conditions on the southern Baltic Sea in autumn 2016 is presented. For the analysis area of Szczecin Waterway Node and section of Oder River from Szczecin to Gryfino was chosen. Based on data the weather and <b>navigational</b> <b>conditions</b> of the area of the Lower Oder were assessed. Occurring winds, currents and changes in water level has been analyzed. In the situations of unfavorable raise of the water level in the river, inland navigation is redirected to the section of Regalica River, and a section of the port of Szczecin region is closed. This causes obvious difficulties and results in prolonged ships routes. Additional obstacle that take place here is an arbitrarily determined time of railway bridge span lifting in Szczecin Podjuchy...|$|E

40|$|New Barrages are {{currently}} under construction at Naga Hammadi {{in order to}} replace the Old Naga Hammadi Barrages located at 359 Km downstream Aswan High Dam. The new barrages provide hydropower generation in addition to enhancing the irrigation and <b>navigational</b> <b>conditions</b> already provided by the old barrages. The new Barrages are located downstream the old ones at El Dom island in a curved river reach. A flood flow of 7000 m 3 /s (about 605 Million m 3 /day) is considered as the maximum flood flow at the New Naga Hammdi Barrages and the maximum flood level upstream of the New Barrages is designated as (67. 05) m while the normal water level is (65. 9) m. The bed levels may reach a minimum value of (52. 0) m which may lead to bank heights {{in the order of}} 15. 0 m. Indeed such high bank height needs special considerations in order to ensure full bank stability. Therefore, utilization is made to the WAVES two-dimensional (2 D) numerical model, Hafez 2004, for predicting the velocity, water depth and extracting the conditions needed for bank stability analyses. The hydrodynamic analysis of the curved river reach between the Old and New Naga Hammadi Barrages using the WAVES- 2 D Model revealed that critical water depths up to 17. 0 m and velocities up to 1. 55 m/s exist at the vicinity of the left bank...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2008 The {{mouth of}} the Columbia River (MCR) has a longstanding {{reputation}} of hazardous <b>navigational</b> <b>conditions.</b> This reputation has been developing since the first ship, the Columbia, traversed through the inlet in 1792. The hazardous conditions {{are related to the}} large waves and strong tidal currents that are common in the area. Tidal currents often reach 2 m/s. As large waves interact with strong tidal currents waves can steepen and break. This study investigates on the importance of wave-current interaction at the MCR. To model these conditions a two dimensional spectral model, SWAN (Simulating WAves Nearshore) (Booij, 1999), was used. SWAN simulations were completed neglecting as well as including current to make comparisons. Wave height and length were found to be influenced considerably by wave-current interaction. The SWAN simulations were also compared to both radar and insitu observations. Radar [...] estimated and SWAN [...] predicted wave direction and wave breaking were compared. SWAN-predicted wave direction and radar-observed wave direction compared well; however, poor agreement between observations and predictions occurred over a shoal in the region used to make comparisons. The source of this disagreement is unknown. Radar [...] observed wave breaking compared well with SWAN-predicted wave breaking in depth-limited cases; however, radar-observations indicate current induced wave breaking that SWAN does not predict. Insitu observations of wave direction and wave height both demonstrated good agreement with SWAN-predicted wave direction and wave height. Overall SWAN-predictions demonstrate good agreement with observations from both radar and insitu measurements...|$|E

Twenty million tons of it was oil products, which {{can be defined as}} a dangerous cargo. It has been estimated that the maritime traffic will increase two-fold in 2010 - 2015. In addition to vessels visiting Estonian ports, a large number of tankers visiting new Russian ports sail along the Estonian coastline. The risk of accidents is high due to the high concentration of traffic, the number of substandard vessels and the difficult <b>navigational</b> <b>conditions,</b> especially in winter.

40|$|The Tamar estuary, {{located on}} the south coast of the UK, is under the {{influence}} of a macrotidal regime. This induces strong tidal streams which can create a hindrance to navigation within the estuary water ways. The Mayflower Marina which is situated at the entrance of the estuary is thus subjected to strong tidal dynamics which induce problems for local mariners. The aim {{of this study was to}} supply a better understanding of the surface water dynamics within and around the marina. ADCP (Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler) was chosen as the method for gathering the data and proved to be suitable for fulfilling the objectives of the research. The data were gathered with reliable accuracy over large areas within a short time span which is a significant parameter in regard to the tide cycle. This study exemplified the presence of the dynamic tidal streams within the Mayflower Marina and its surroundings by expanding on previous knowledge of these dynamics within the main entrance of the estuary. It appears that a quasi constant anticlockwise gyre developing over most of Stonehouse Creek may be the main tidal dynamic that influences <b>navigational</b> <b>conditions</b> vwthin the eastern side of the marina. The flows heading South East in the surroundings of the storm pontoon were postulated to represent another hindrance for local mariners.

40|$|Over {{the last}} 30 years {{the extent of}} sea-ice {{covering}} the North Pole has declined about 15 ∼ 20 % on average, and {{it is expected that}} by the end of the 21 st century, vast areas of the Arctic Ocean will be ice-free during the summer season, thus, increasing the possibility of ship navigation across the Arctic Ocean. In this paper, we have developed a model of shipping for the Northwest Passage (hereinafter NWP) in northern Canada to determine whether ice thinning will make this route more economically viable when compared with the Panama Canal. Among the 7 routes of the NWP, Route 2 and Route 3 offer better <b>navigational</b> <b>conditions</b> than the others. However, Route 3 has a depth limit of only 10 m, so here we use Route 2 which is suitable for deep draft navigation to carry on our analysis. Container ships of 4, 500 ∼ 15, 000 TEU under Hub and spoke mode, container shipping between Busan port and New York port is simulated for the Panama Canal and the NWP. This paper considers Canada's sovereignty in matters of navigation over the waters at the Arctic Archipelago, in the form of a toll fee for passage usage. We concluded that the NWP has an advantage over the Panama Canal if it is open for free international passage, regardless of ship size. However, if it is not free, its advantages depend on its toll fee. The lower the toll fee is, the more advantages the NWP will boast...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the basic flow structures {{in a river}} bend in a physical model with and without a submerged weir. The CCHE 2 D model and the CCHE 3 D model for free surface and turbulent flows, which have been extensively validated and verified in recent years, are combined to study the flow in the channel in both the presence and absence of a submerged weir, where the water surface elevations and velocities are measured for certain flow conditions and in certain ranges. A 2 D model is {{used to determine the}} water edge and to calibrate the bed roughness for the 3 D model. A 3 D model, after calibration and validation with the physical model data, is used to investigate the flow structure in the channel both in the presence and absence of a submerged weir. The agreement between the measured velocities (surface elevations) and the simulated velocities is reasonably good, which indicates that the CCHE 3 D model is capable of investigating the flow structure of such a channel. It is found that the submerged weir has a significant effect on the flow in the channel, and that the largest influence appears {{in the vicinity of the}} weir. Secondary flows, which are key to <b>navigational</b> <b>conditions,</b> undergo a process of break up when the flow approaches the weir, and develop into single, two, and three secondary flow zones downstream of the weir and then decay from three to two secondary flow zones and finally revert to a single secondary flow zone.

40|$|This is an Accepted Manuscript of {{an article}} {{published}} by Taylor & Francis in Al-Masāq on 18 June 2012, available online: [URL] demise of the Canopic and Pelusiac branches of the Nile in the ninth-tenth centuries AD left the Nile with only two major Delta branches – the Dumyāt (Damietta) and Rashīd (Rosetta) – debouching directly into the Mediterranean Sea. <b>Navigational</b> <b>conditions</b> at the mouths (sing. būghāz) of these remaining branches were treacherous. The encounter of river and sea brought about a clash of fluvial and marine currents, wave fields and winds, all {{in an environment of}} perennially shifting sandbanks. The result was a navigational tumult that threatened shipping, and indeed often wrecked vessels, as a broad spread of historical and traveller accounts attest. These problematic conditions had a formative effect on the navigational landscape of the Nile-Mediterranean interface. On the western fringe of the Delta, Alexandria remained the port par excellance of Egypt. Not only did the city have a superior maritime port, but its connection with the Nile hinterlands via the seasonal and state-maintained Alexandria canal, as well as via Lakes Abū Qīr and Idkū, allowed vessels to avoid the hazards of the Rashīd mouth. The treacherous mouth also meant that the eponymous city of Rashīd failed to gain prominence as a port until the Alexandria canal fell out of use in the Ottoman period. In the eastern Delta, similar conditions at the Dumyāt branch prompted navigators to take an alternative route to the sea via Tinnīs, an island city in modern Lake Manzalah that connected to the Dumyāt branch through the physically smaller Tinnīs branch, and which linked to the sea through relatively calmer lake mouths. It was only in response to Crusader attack that Tinnīs yielded to Dumyāt as the premier port of the eastern Delta. This paper brings together historical, archaeological, meteorological and hydrological data to offer a new understanding of the navigational context of Egypt’s medieval Mediterranaean ports...|$|E
