5|$|An NBA player {{playing in}} Europe could earn {{as little as}} $50,000–$75,000 per month, while the average NBA annual salary was $5.8 million with the minimum around $500,000.

Johnson led the West to a 153–113win and was crowned All-Star MVP after recording 25points, 9assists, and 5rebounds.

5|$|Although the 2012 Olympic men's {{basketball}} tournament was then {{more than a}} year away, qualifying tournaments in all five of FIBA's continental zones were to be held in the Northern Hemisphere summer of 2011 (the traditional basketball offseason throughout the world). The lockout resulted in the suspension of an agreement between the NBA and FIBA by which the NBA would take on most of the costs for insuring the value of its players' contracts in the event they were injured during international competition. As a result, national federations that wish to have <b>NBA</b> <b>players</b> on their squads must now provide full coverage instead of supplemental insurance.|$|E
