40|$|Interaction Object Graphs (IOGs) are an executable, {{graphical}} specification notation. They are {{an extension}} of statecharts, an extended transition diagram. IOGs are designed to specify the details of user-interface widgets. However, they provide all of the expressiveness required to specify entire user interfaces. This is accomplished by specifying the widgets, specifying the relationships between widget attributes, and adding inter-widget dialog states and transitions to complete the user interface. Communication with application code can be through constraints on widget attributes or through designer-specified events. IOGs also provide a hierarchical structure that allows details to be selectively hidden and exposed. This paper describes the IOG diagram and their properties. It then presents a detailed example of how to use IOGs - the partial specification of a <b>net</b> <b>browser.</b> Two properties of widget dialogs are defined, dialog completion and state invariance. Demonstrating these properties in i IOG specification is explained. Godkänd; 1997; 20080325 (ysko...|$|E
40|$|Correction magnet power {{supplies}} {{are used to}} supply currents with a 17 bit precision to the superconducting correction magnets inside the TESLA linear accelerator. The required magnet current of up to 100 A is achieved by a parallel connection of boards in EURO card size with an output current of 25 A each. Additional cards provide redundancy in case of failures. By means of a 50 kHz transformer the 325 V DC input voltage is galvanically isolated to the ± 10 V output voltage on each board. The compact design includes a new polarity changing MOSFET output rectifier with a high efficiency free wheeling path and a new frequency PWM (FPWM) steered by an ALTERA chip to minimize switching losses at low output voltages. The ALTERA FPGA includes a digital regulation. Regulation parameters, reference values, temperatures and status signals are exchanged via RS 232 port with a PC which provides the power supply data to the Internet. All data will be accessible by normal <b>net</b> <b>browsers...</b>|$|R
40|$|This short paper, in {{its early}} version, {{describes}} one of our current activities around consistency of information via the nets. Consistency is a well known issue in distributed systems and we have many flavors of it. The aim of this project is to transpose some of the algorithms and approaches designed for shared memories to Web documents. Our main concern is to deal with multiple copies of a document and to offer a certain quality {{of service to the}} user of one of the copies. Keywords: Web - Consistency - Intranet - Internet - QoS - Security 1 Introduction To improve performance and to increase availability of the information, we copy it with one of the ftp commands or with one of the <b>net</b> <b>browsers.</b> These operations This work has been approved by Conseil Regional de Bretagne under the program ITR (Informatique Telecommunication et Reseaux) y Alberto is a student at Facultad de Informatica, Universidad Politecnica de Madrid and candidates for the diploma of engineer of UPM and [...] ...|$|R

This technology by providing necessary fundamentals runs applications as services on the <b>net</b> via web <b>browsers.</b> E-learning can utilize cloud computing {{in order to fulfill}} the required infrastructures and also to provide the improved performance, scalability, and increased availability. This study in addition to representation of concepts such as e-learning and cloud computing by utilizing descriptive-analytical approach investigates usage of cloud computing in e-learning. Also by introducing the advantages indicates the significance and the necessity of using e-learning based upon cloud computing. Ultimately, the challenges of this model and their solutions have been represented as wel...|$|R
50|$|Net Applications {{is known}} for being a {{provider}} of usage share statistics for web browsers and operating systems. It provides these services through its product Market Share. The statistics are available on a month-to-month basis for free {{but they are also}} available down to hourly statistics as a paid service. The freely available statistics stretch back to November 2007 though their data stretches back to at least Q4 2004. In August 2009, Net Applications began weighting its raw data {{based on the number of}} internet users in the countries concerned, using data from the CIA; the changes were applied retroactively to older data. <b>Net</b> Applications measures <b>browser</b> usage by tracking the machines that visit the 40,000 sites it monitors for clients, which results in a pool of about 160 million unique visitors per month.|$|R
40|$|We {{present the}} control system for the light source ANKA, which builds on the three-tier {{standard}} model architecture. Modern products based on standards in distributed objects and networking are applied in addition to low-cost hardware including PCs. The LonWorks field bus network with intelligent nodes and standard I/O modules connect the individual devices directly to PCs. Those PCs act as Web servers for data transmission, application distribution and documentation retrieval. Other PCs on the <b>net</b> run Web <b>browsers</b> with Java clients. The communication with {{the control system}} data servers is done through CORBA. CORBA objects are wrapped into JavaBeans, which are connected with commercial data-manipulation and visualisation Beans using visual tools or programmatically. The CORBA objects and JavaBeans are generic models of controlled data {{that can be used}} at any other control system. The Java applications are based on those objects only and can thus be run on any other accelerator. ...|$|R
