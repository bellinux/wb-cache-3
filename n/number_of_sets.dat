5|$|Hybridization may be {{important}} in speciation in some plant groups. However, homoploid hybrid speciation (not increasing the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>sets</b> of chromosomes) may be rare: by 1997, only 8 natural examples had been fully described. Experimental studies suggest that hybridization offers a rapid route to speciation, a prediction confirmed {{by the fact that}} early generation hybrids and ancient hybrid species have matching genomes, meaning that once hybridization has occurred, the new genome can remain stable.|$|E
5|$|Other {{developmental}} and reproductive variations include haplodiploidy, polymorphism, paedomorphosis or peramorphosis, sexual dimorphism, parthenogenesis and more rarely hermaphroditism. In haplodiploidy, {{which is a}} type of sex-determination system, the offspring's sex is determined by the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>sets</b> of chromosomes an individual receives. This system is typical in bees and wasps. Polymorphism is where a species may have different morphs or forms, as in the oblong winged katydid, which has four different varieties: green, pink and yellow or tan. Some insects may retain phenotypes that are normally only seen in juveniles; this is called paedomorphosis. In peramorphosis, an opposite sort of phenomenon, insects take on previously unseen traits after they have matured into adults. Many insects display sexual dimorphism, in which males and females have notably different appearances, such as the moth Orgyia recens as an exemplar of sexual dimorphism in insects.|$|E
5|$|Stern shot Changeling in {{anamorphic}} format on {{35mm film}} using Kodak Vision 500T 5279 film stock. The film was shot on Panavision cameras and C-Series lenses. Due {{to the large}} <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>sets,</b> the lighting rigs were more extensive than on other Eastwood productions. The crew made several ceilings from bleached muslin tiles. Stern lit the tiles from above to produce a soft, warm light that was intended to evoke the period through tones close to antique and sepia. The crew segregated the tiles using fire safety fabric Duvatyn to prevent light spilling onto neighboring clusters. The key light was generally softer to match the warm tones given off by the toplights. Stern used stronger skypans—more intense than is commonly used for key lighting—to reduce contrasts when applying daytime rain effects, as a single light source tended to produce harder shadows.|$|E

5|$|The {{budget of}} the series is {{estimated}} to be £15 million. Filming began in February 2013 and concluded in August 2013, with location shooting largely taken place in Kent and northern France. Filming in Kent was based in Discovery Park in Sandwich and was supported by the Kent Film Office. A former Pfizer facility was used as a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>sets,</b> including the Calais police station and Elise's apartment. The series was filmed throughout five districts: Canterbury, Dover, Shepway, Swale and Thanet. Several prominent locales were featured, including Folkestone Harbour; The Turner Contemporary art gallery; Westwood Cross shopping centre; and the towns of Dover, Folkestone and Margate. Production also made use of the Kent Film Office's legal powers to close certain roads for uninterrupted filming. An estimated £2.5 million of the budget was spent on, among other services, accommodation, locations, parking and catering, providing a boost for the Kent economy. The filming in France was supported by the Nord-Pas de Calais Film Commission and benefited from the Tax Rebate International. Shooting took place over 31 days across Boulogne-sur-Mer, Calais and Dunkerque.|$|E

Players can also engage in Shows which {{are a series of}} songs broken up into a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>sets.</b> Some songs in these Shows are predetermined, but others are left to be voted on during a short period between songs by the band members; individual members also have the opportunity to select a song from a limited list during periods of the current song when their musical part is inactive. The available options are based on what songs the collective band members have in their library and the band's chosen theme, and voting options may include specific songs (including one selected mid-song), or broad classifications such as by genre type, release year, or song length. To aid in the cooperative nature of the game, any scoring multipliers and remaining Overdrive are carried over between songs in Gig lists as well as between sets in the Career mode.|$|E

25|$|Interval {{and quality}} of {{exercise}} also affect hormonal response. Sessions of moderate to high intensity with multiple sets and short time intervals, during which energy is derived from glycolytic lactate metabolism, {{appear to be the}} greatest stimulus for steroid hormone response. Hormonal response in young men varies with the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>sets</b> in the exercise session. However, when the number increased from 4 to 6, anabolic levels stabilized and cortisol continued to rise, suggesting that alterations in anaerobic volume could alter anabolic and catabolic hormonal balance. When sets are performed at maximum repetitions, interval has no influence at a certain intensity range, with no acute hormone response difference between protocols at 10 maximum reps with 2- and 5-minute intervals. There is a higher total testosterone response in hypertrophy protocols compared to those for strength and power, despite equalization of total work load (defined as load x sets x repetitions). There is a 27% greater testosterone response using protocols with simultaneous use of all four limbs. Androgenic response was also noted in protocols using upper and lower limbs separately to a lesser degree.|$|E
500|$|In 1903, the Royal Mint {{made its}} first effort {{to cut back on}} the number of pieces distributed, {{eliminating}} 200Mint workers (principally charwomen and labourers) from the distribution list. [...] Until 1908 Maundy sets could be ordered through banks. [...] Beginning in 1909, however, distribution of the pieces was restricted to Maundy recipients and certain officials. [...] Mintage of sets of Maundy money dropped from 9,929 in 1908 to 2,428 the following year. [...] By 1932, Maundy recipients were routinely selling the coins to dealers at a premium. [...] There was little official response to this until the 1960s, when questions were asked in the House of Lords after the press reported that recipients were being approached by dealers after the service and being offered cash for their gifts. [...] In response, the Royal Mint decreased the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>sets</b> available to officials, though Royal Mint employees of long service are offered the opportunity, every few years, to purchase a set. [...] A <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>sets</b> are used as prizes for students at Westminster School, a practice said to have begun with Elizabeth I, though this now occurs only in years when the service is held at Westminster Abbey.

40|$|The study <b>of</b> the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> {{independent}} <b>sets</b> in a graph has a rich history. Recently, Kahn {{proved that}} disjoint unions of Kr,r’s have the maximum <b>number</b> <b>of</b> independent <b>sets</b> amongst r-regular bipartite graphs.

If we instead restrict {{the class of}} graphs to those on a fixed <b>number</b> <b>of</b> vertices and edges, then the Kruskal-Katona theorem implies that the graph with the maximum <b>number</b> <b>of</b> independent <b>sets</b> is the lex graph, where edges form an initial segment of the lexicographic ordering. In this paper, we study three related questions. Firstly, we prove that the lex graph has the maximum <b>number</b> <b>of</b> weighted independent <b>sets</b> for any appropriate weighting. Secondly, we solve the problem <b>of</b> maximizing the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> independents <b>sets</b> in graphs with specified independence number or clique number.

500|$|Both Linda Park and {{executive}} producer Rick Berman saw [...] "Exile" [...] as a play on the [...] "Beauty and the Beast" [...] story.
