The species is closely related to Latrodectus hesperus (western black widow) and Latrodectus variolus (<b>northern</b> <b>black</b> <b>widow).</b> Members of the three species are often confused with the genus Steatoda, the false widows. Prior to 1970, when the current taxonomic divisions for North American black widows were set forth by Kaston, all three varieties were classified as a single species, L. mactans.

Other Latrodectus that cause latrodectism are the Australian redback spider (L. hasselti), and the New Zealand katipo spider (L. katipo).

40|$|Adult {{females have}} a body length (cephalothorax and abdomen combined) of {{approximately}} 1 / 2 inch (~ 1. 25 cm) and a total leg span of approximately 1 - 1 / 2 inches (~ 4 cm) (Figure 2). However, there is much variation in female size, particularly gravid (egg-carrying) females. The abdomen of a gravid female can be greater than 1 / 2 inch (~ 1. 25 cm) in diameter. Males are much smaller, often having a body length less than 1 / 4 inch (< 0. 75 cm) and a leg span of approximately 1 / 2 inch (~ 1. 25 cm). Description Like all spiders, the widow spiders have two main body parts, the cephalothorax and abdomen. The cephalothorax bears the head and legs (Figure 2). The abdomen is {{much larger than the}} cephalothorax. The spinnerets, or silk and web making appendages, are attached to the rear end of the abdomen. On widow spiders, the spinnerets look like a cluster of small cones (Figure 6). Figure 1. <b>Northern</b> <b>black</b> <b>widow</b> with egg sac.

25|$|As of 2012, {{researchers}} at the University of California, Riverside, suggested that the brown widow spider, newly established in Southern California, {{may in fact be}} displacing <b>black</b> <b>widow</b> spiders from the region, competing and/or fighting for territory. While certainly not definitive, this evidence does suggest that the brown widow is likely to be more hostile and aggressive towards its relative, the <b>black</b> <b>widow,</b> than the <b>black</b> <b>widow</b> is towards it. If that proves to be true, humans may be positively affected because, over time, brown widows will aggressively eradicate and replace the <b>black</b> <b>widows</b> from the areas they inhabit, and since brown widows are less venomous than <b>black</b> <b>widows,</b> this may have the effect of making those areas safer.|$|R
