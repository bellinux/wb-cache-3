There are many stories of automatons used in the Tang, including general Yang Wulian's wooden statue of a monk who stretched his hands out to collect contributions; when the amount of coins reached a certain weight, the mechanical figure moved his arms to deposit them in a satchel. This weight-and-lever mechanism was exactly like Heron's penny slot machine.

Legend has it that he also created a giant mirror (see Heat ray) that was used to deflect the powerful Mediterranean sun onto the ships' sails, setting fire to them. These measures, along with the fire from ballistas and onagers mounted on the city walls, frustrated the Romans and forced them to attempt costly direct assaults.|$|R

Lines two, three and six rhyme together while lines four and five constitute an independent rhyming group. The first verse of the poem illustrates this structure of six eight-syllable lines.

5000|$|The kestros is {{mentioned}} {{in the writings of}} Livy and Polybius.

The description is quite confusing: The so-called cestrus was a <b>novel</b> <b>invention</b> {{at the time of the}} war with Perseus. The form of the missile was as follows. It was two cubits long, the tube being of the same length as the point. Into the former was fitted a wooden shaft a span in length and a finger's breadth in thickness, and to the middle of this were firmly attached three quite short wing-shaped sticks. The thongs of the sling from which the missile was discharged were of unequal length, and it was so inserted into the loop between them that it was easily freed. There it remained fixed while the thongs were whirled round and taut, but when at the moment of discharge one of the thongs was loosened, it left the loop and was shot like a leaden bullet from the sling, and striking with great force inflicted severe injury on those who were hit by it.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{describe}} a computer-supported cooperative learning system {{in education and}} the results of its deployment. The system, called I-MINDS, consists of a set of teacher agents, group agents, and student agents. While the agents possess individual intelligent capabilities, the <b>novel</b> <b>invention</b> of I-MINDS lies in multiagent intelligence and coalition formation. I-MINDS supports student participation and collaboration and helps the instructor manage large, distance classrooms. Specifically, it uses a Vickrey auction-based and learning-enabled algorithm called VALCAM to form student groups in a structured cooperative learning setting. We have deployed I-MINDS in an introductory computer science course (CS 1) and conducted experiments in the Spring and Fall semesters of 2005 to study how I-MINDS-supported collaboration fares against traditional, face-to-face collaboration. Results showed that students using I-MINDS performed (and outperformed in some aspects) as well as students in traditional settings...|$|E

The paper discusses {{the significance of the}} ritual in context of ‘invented tradition ’ as posited by Hobsbawm and in light of Foucault’s ‘governmentality ’ to generate alternative understanding of the ritual, and explore its role in the founding of first Bhutanese state in the 17 th century. It argues that the ritual is not a <b>novel</b> <b>invention</b> but rather a reinvented tradition with antecedent in monastic institution, which was then modified, ritualised, and institutionalised to establish and legitimise a new Bhutanese state.
