50|$|<b>Netupitant</b> is a {{selective}} NK1 receptor antagonist.|$|E
50|$|Bioavailability is {{estimated}} to be over 60% for orally taken <b>netupitant.</b> Highest blood plasma concentrations are reached five hours after application. Availability is moderately (10-20%) increased when taken after a fatty meal. <b>Netupitant</b> and its main metabolites (called M1 and M3) are bound to plasma proteins to more than 99%, and M2 protein binding is 97%.|$|E
50|$|Side {{effects of}} the {{combination}} netupitant/palonosetron are similar to palonosetron alone, so that no common side effects {{can be attributed to}} <b>netupitant.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Netupitant</b> {{blood plasma}} levels are {{expected}} to increase when combined with inhibitors of the liver enzyme CYP3A4 and lowered when combined with inductors of this enzyme.|$|E
50|$|The {{substance}} is mainly metabolized by CYP3A4, {{and to a}} lesser extent by CYP2D6 and CYP2C9. The main metabolites are desmethyl-netupitant (M1), <b>netupitant</b> N-oxide (M2), and hydroxy-netupitant (M3); all three are pharmacologically active.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} side effects are {{headache}} and constipation. The overall profile of adverse effects {{is comparable to}} that of palonosetron (see Palonosetron#Adverse effects); no common adverse effects can be attributed to <b>netupitant.</b>|$|E

In the United States, the {{combination}} drug netupitant/palonosetron (trade name Akynzeo) is {{approved by the}} Food and Drug Administration for prevention of acute and delayed chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, including highly emetogenic chemotherapy such as with cisplatin. In Europe, it is approved by the European Medicines Agency for the same indication.|$|E
50|$|Befetupitant (Ro67-5930) {{is a drug}} {{developed}} by Hoffmann-La Roche which acts as a potent and selective antagonist for the NK1 receptor. It was originally developed as a potential antiemetic drug, though development was ultimately discontinued after a related drug <b>netupitant</b> was deemed to be more suitable for clinical development. Befetupitant has however continued to be researched for other possible applications such as treatment of corneal neovascularization.|$|E
50|$|An {{example of}} a drug in this class is aprepitant. Chemotherapy-induced emesis appears to consist of acute and delayed phases. So far, the acute phase emesis {{responds}} to 5-HT3 antagonists while the delayed phase remains difficult to control. The discovery and development of NK1 receptor antagonists have elicited antiemetic effect in both acute and especially in delayed phases of emesis. Casopitant, <b>netupitant</b> and rolapitant are some newer additions in this group. Rolapitant has a significantly long half life of 160 hours and got approval by the USFDA in 2015.|$|E
5000|$|A newer {{class of}} drugs {{known as the}} NK1 antagonists are a {{recently}} developed class of very efficacious drugs for controlling CINV. These drugs are often used alongside 5HT3 inhibitors and corticosteroids to form a very potent cocktail of antiemetics that verge on achieving a nearly complete patient response (that is, completely stopping CINV). [...] The substance P inhibitor aprepitant (Emend), which became available in 2005, is highly effective in controlling nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy. Aprepitant {{has been shown to}} inhibit both the acute and delayed emesis induced by cytotoxic chemotherapeutic drugs by blocking substance P landing on receptors in the brains neurons. This has been proven by Positron Emission Tomography (PET) studies, which have demonstrated that aprepitant can penetrate the brain and NK1 receptors in the brain. It has also been shown to increase the activity of the 5-HT3 receptor antagonists ondansetron and the corticosteroid dexamethasone, which are also used to prevent nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy. <b>Netupitant</b> has recently been approved by USFDA. It has also been marketed in combination with palonosetron. Rolapitant is the newest addition in the approved NK1 antagonist list. It has advantage of a very long half life, duration of action is around 150 hours. Rolapitant got its approval by USFDA in 2015.|$|E
40|$|The novel NK(1) {{receptor}} ligand <b>Netupitant</b> {{has been}} characterized in vitro and in vivo. In calcium mobilization studies CHO cells expressing the human NK receptors responded to a panel of agonists with the expected order of potency. In CHO NK(1) cells <b>Netupitant</b> concentration-dependently antagonized the stimulatory effects of substance P (SP) showing insurmountable antagonism (pK(B) 8. 87). In cells expressing NK(2) or NK(3) receptors <b>Netupitant</b> was inactive. In the guinea pig ileum <b>Netupitant</b> concentration-dependently depressed the maximal response to SP (pK(B) 7. 85) and, in functional washout experiments, displayed persistent (up to 5 h) antagonist effects. In mice the intrathecal injection of SP elicited the typical scratching, biting and licking response that was dose-dependently inhibited by <b>Netupitant</b> given intraperitoneally in the 1 - 10 mg/kg dose range. In gerbils, foot tapping behavior evoked by the intracerebroventricular injection of a NK(1) agonist was dose-dependently counteracted by <b>Netupitant</b> given intraperitoneally (ID(50) 1. 5 mg/kg) or orally (ID(50) 0. 5 mg/kg). In time course experiments in gerbils <b>Netupitant</b> displayed long lasting effects. In all the assays Aprepitant elicited similar effects as <b>Netupitant.</b> These results suggest that <b>Netupitant</b> behaves as a brain penetrant, orally active, potent and selective NK(1) antagonist. Thus this molecule can be useful for investigating the NK(1) receptor role in the control of central and peripheral functions. <b>Netupitant</b> has clinical potential in conditions such as chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting, in which the blockade of NK(1) receptors has been demonstrated valuable for patients...|$|E
40|$|<b>Netupitant</b> is a new, {{selective}} NK 1 receptor antagonist {{under development}} {{for the prevention of}} chemotherapy‐induced nausea and vomiting. Two studies were conducted to evaluate the brain receptor occupancy (RO) and disposition (ADME) of <b>netupitant</b> in humans. Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging with the NK 1 receptor‐binding–selective tracer [11 C]‐GR 205171 was used to evaluate the brain penetration of different doses of <b>netupitant</b> (100, 300, and 450 mg) and to determine theNK 1 ‐ROduration. ANK 1 ‐ROof 90 % or higher was achievedwith all doses in the majority of the tested brain regions at Cmax, with a long duration of RO. The <b>netupitant</b> minimal plasma concentration predicted to achieve a NK 1 ‐RO of 90 %, C 90 %, in the striatum was 225 ng/mL; after administration of <b>netupitant</b> 300 mg, concentrations exceeded the C 90 %. In the ADME study, a single nominal dose of [14 C]‐netupitant 300 mg was used to assess its disposition. Absorption was rapid and <b>netupitant</b> was extensively metabolized via Phase I and II hepatic metabolism. Elimination of> 90 % was predicted at day 29 and was principally via hepatic/biliary route (> 85 %) with a minor contribution of the renal route (< 5 %).

In addition, <b>netupitant</b> is extensively metabolized and is mainly eliminated through the hepatic/biliary route {{and to a lesser extent}} via the kidneys...|$|E
40|$|Introduction. Tachykinins {{potently}} contract {{the isolated}} urinary bladder {{from a number}} of animal species and {{play an important role in}} the regulation of the micturition reflex. On the guinea-pig isolated urinary bladder we examined the effects of a new potent and selective NK 1 receptor antagonist (<b>netupitant)</b> on the contractions induced by a selective NK 1 receptor agonist, SP-methylester (SP-OMe). Moreover, the effects of <b>netupitant</b> and another selective NK 1 antagonist (L- 733, 060) were studied in anesthetized guinea-pigs using two experimental models, the isovolumetric bladder contractions and a model of bladder overactivity induced by intravesical administration of acetic acid (AA). Methods and Results. Detrusor muscle strips were mounted in 5 mL organ baths and isometric contractions to cumulative concentrations of SP-OME were recorded before and after incubation with increasing concentrations of <b>netupitant.</b> In anesthetized female guinea-pigs, reflex bladder activity was examined under isovolumetric conditions with the bladder distended with saline or during cystometry using intravesical infusion of acetic acid (AA). After a 30 min stabilization period, <b>netupitant</b> (0. 1 - 3 mg/kg, i. v.) or L- 733, 060 (3 - 10 mg/kg, i. v.) were administered. In the detrusor muscle, <b>netupitant</b> produced a concentration-dependent inhibition (mean pKB = 9. 24) of the responses to SP-OMe. Under isovolumetric conditions, <b>netupitant</b> or L- 733, 060 reduced bladder contraction frequency in a dose-dependent manner, but neither drug changed bladder contraction amplitude. In the AA model, <b>netupitant</b> dose-dependently increased intercontraction interval (ICI) but had no effect on the amplitude of micturition (AM). L- 733, 060 dose-dependently increased ICI also but this effect was paralleled by a significant reduction of AM. Conclusion. <b>Netupitant</b> decreases the frequency of reflex bladder contractions without altering their amplitude, suggesting that this drug targets the afferent limb of the micturition reflex circuit and therefore may be useful clinically in treating bladder overactivity symptoms...|$|E
40|$|Background and Aims: Chemotherapy-induced {{acute and}} delayed emesis {{involves}} the activation of multiple pathways, with 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT; serotonin) playing {{a major role}} in the initial response. Substance P tachykinin NK 1 receptor antagonists can reduce emesis induced by disparate emetic challenges and therefore have a clinical utility as broad inhibitory anti-emetic drugs. In the present studies, we investigate the broad inhibitory anti-emetic profile of a relatively new NK 1 receptor antagonist, <b>netupitant,</b> alone or in combination with the long acting 5 -HT 3 receptor antagonist, palonosetron, for a potential to reduce emesis in ferrets and shrews. Materials and Methods: Ferrets were pretreated with <b>netupitant</b> and/or palonosetron, or their combination, and then administered apomorphine (0. 125 mg/kg, s. c.), morphine (0. 5 mg/kg, s. c.), ipecacuanha (1. 2 mg/kg, p. o.), copper sulphate (100 mg/kg, intragastric), or cisplatin (5 - 10 mg/kg, i. p.); in other studies <b>netupitant</b> was administered to Suncus murinus before motion (4 cm horizontal displacement, 2 Hz for 10 min). Results: <b>Netupitant</b> (3 mg/kg, p. o.) abolished apomorphine-, morphine-, ipecacuanha- and copper sulphate-induced emesis. Lower doses of <b>netupitant</b> (0. 03 - 0. 3 mg/kg, p. o.) dose-dependently reduced cisplatin (10 mg/kg, i. p.) -induced emesis in an acute (8 h) model, and motion-induced emesis in Suncus murinus. In a ferret cisplatin (5 mg/kg, i. p.) -induced acute and delayed emesis model, <b>netupitant</b> administered once at 3 mg/kg, p. o., abolished the first 24 h response and reduced the 24 - 72 h response by 94. 6 %; the reduction was markedly superior to the effect of a three times per day administration of ondansetron (1 mg/kg, i. p.). A single administration of <b>netupitant</b> (1 mg/kg, p. o.) plus palonosetron (0. 1 mg/kg, p. o.) combined with dexamethasone (1 mg/kg, i. p., once per day), also significantly antagonized cisplatin-induced acute and delayed emesis and was comparable with a once-daily regimen of ondansetron (1 mg/kg, p. o.) plus aprepitant (1 mg/kg, p. o.) in combination with dexamethasone (1 mg/kg, i. p.). Conclusion: <b>Netupitant</b> has potent and long lasting anti-emetic activity against a number of emetic challenges indicating broad inhibitory properties. The convenience of protection afforded by the single dosing of <b>netupitant</b> together with palonosetron was demonstrated and also is known to provide an advantage over other therapeutic strategies to control emesis in man...|$|E

The emetogenicity of the chemotherapeutic agents, repeated chemotherapy cycles, and patient risk factors significantly influence CINV. The use of a combination of a 5 -hydroxytryptamine- 3 (5 -HT 3) receptor antagonists, dexamethasone, and a neurokinin- 1 (NK- 1) receptor antagonist has significantly improved the control of acute and delayed emesis in single-day chemotherapy. Palonosetron, a second generation 5 -HT 3 receptor antagonist with a different half-life, different binding capacity, and a different mechanism of action than the first generation 5 -HT 3 receptor antagonists, appears to be the most effective agent in its class. <b>Netupitant,</b> is a new NK- 1 receptor antagonist with a high binding affinity, a long half-life of 90  hours, is metabolized by CYP 3 A 4, and is an inhibitor of CYP 3 A 4. NEPA is an oral fixed-dose combination of <b>netupitant</b> and palonosetron which has recently been employed in Phase II and Phase III clinical trials for the prevention of CINV in patients receiving moderately and highly emetogenic chemotherapy (MEC and HEC). The clinical trials demonstrated that NEPA (300 mg of <b>netupitant</b> plus 0. 50 mg of palonosetron) significantly improved the prevention of CINV compared to the use of palonosetron alone in patients receiving either HEC or MEC. The clinical efficacy was maintained over multiple cycles of chemotherapy.

The NK- 1 RA rolapitant, recently approved in oral formulation, has nanomolar affinity for the NK- 1 receptor, as do the other commercially available NK- 1 RAs, aprepitant and <b>netupitant.</b> Rolapitant is rapidly absorbed and has a long half-life in comparison to aprepitant and <b>netupitant.</b> All three NK- 1 RAs undergo metabolism by cytochrome P 450 (CYP) 3 A 4, necessitating caution with the concomitant use of CYP 3 A 4 inhibitors, but in contrast to aprepitant and <b>netupitant,</b> rolapitant does not inhibit or induce CYP 3 A 4. However, rolapitant is a moderate inhibitor of CYP 2 D 6, and concomitant use with CYP 2 D 6 substrates with narrow therapeutic indices should be avoided. Aprepitant, <b>netupitant,</b> and rolapitant have all demonstrated efficacy in the control of delayed CINV in patients receiving moderately and highly emetogenic chemotherapy in randomized controlled trials, including over multiple cycles of chemotherapy. We reviewed recent post hoc analyses of clinical trial data demonstrating that rolapitant is efficacious in the control of CINV in patient populations with specific tumor types, namely, breast cancers, gastrointestinal/colorectal cancers, and lung cancers. In addition, we show that rolapitant has efficacy in the control of CINV in specific age groups of patients receiving chemotherapy (< 65 and ≥ 65 years of age). Overall, the safety profile of rolapitant in these specific patient populations was consistent with that observed in primary analyses of phase 3 trials.

40|$|Piotr K JanickiDepartment of Anesthesiology and Perioperative Medicine, Milton S Hershey Medical Center, Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine, Hershey, PA, USAPurpose: The {{purpose of}} this review is to {{summarize}} and discuss the recently published data (both original studies and reviews) on the oral medication NEPA, consisting of <b>netupitant</b> (a neurokinin- 1 receptor antagonist [NK 1 RA], 300  mg dose) and palonosetron (5 -hydroxytryptamine [serotonin or 5 HT] type 3 receptor antagonist [5 HT 3 RA], 0. 5  mg dose), {{in the prevention of}} the acute and delayed nausea and vomiting in patients receiving highly or moderately emetogenic chemotherapy. Methods: This review was based on the very limited number of available published trials consisting of two Phase III studies and one Phase II dose-selecting trial. Results: These studies demonstrated some therapeutic benefits of NEPA over related chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) prophylaxis management, as well as its beneficial safety profile. In particular, compared with single-dose 0. 5  mg palonosetron, the complete response rates for all phases of CINV for the first cycle of highly emetogenic chemotherapy (with cisplatin), as well as anthracycline–cyclophosphamide-based moderately emetogenic chemotherapy, were significantly higher for single-dose NEPA. The high efficacy of NEPA in terms of prevention of CINV continued throughout repeated cycles of highly and moderately emetogenic therapies. Conclusion: It is currently recommended that patients who are administered highly emetogenic chemotherapy regimens should obtain a three-drug combination consisting of NK 1 RA, 5 HT 3 RA, and dexamethasone. The recently available oral combination of NEPA plus dexa­methasone provides an additional pharmacological management option that could be considered in this scenario.

40|$|Vito Lorusso National Cancer Research Centre, Istituto Tumori Giovanni Paolo II, Bari, Italy Abstract: As {{recommended}} by most recent antiemetic guidelines, the optimal prophylaxis of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) requires {{the combination of}} 5 -HT 3 receptor antagonist (RA) with an NK 1 -RA. Moreover, the major predictors of acute and delayed CINV include: young age, female sex, platinum- or anthracycline-based chemotherapy, nondrinker status, emesis in the earlier cycles of chemotherapy, and previous history of motion/morning sickness. Despite improved knowledge of the pathophysiology of CINV and advances in the availability of active antiemetics, an inconsistent compliance with their use has been reported, thereby resulting in suboptimal control of CINV in several cases. In this scenario, a new antiemetic drug is now available, {{which seems to be}} able to guarantee better prophylaxis of CINV and improvement of adherence to guidelines. In fact, netupitant/palonosetron (NEPA) is a ready-to-use single oral capsule, combining an NK 1 -RA (<b>netupitant)</b> and a 5 -HT 3 -RA (palonosetron), which is to be taken 1  hour before the administration of chemotherapy, ensuring the coverage from CINV for 5  days. We reviewed the role of NEPA in patients at high risk of CINV receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy. In these patients, NEPA plus dexamethasone, as compared to standard treatments, achieved superior efficacy in all primary and secondary end points during the acute, delayed, and overall phases, including nausea assessment. Moreover, these results were also achieved in female patients receiving anthracycline plus cyclophosphamide-based chemotherapy. NEPA represents a real step forward in the prophylaxis of CINV.

40|$|Michelle Zhou, Marko Popovic, Mark Pasetka, Natalie Pulenzas, Soha Ahrari, Edward Chow, Carlo DeAngelis Department of Pharmacy, Odette Cancer Center, Sunnybrook Health Sciences Center, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada Purpose: Nausea and {{vomiting}} are major {{adverse effects of}} chemotherapy and can greatly impact patients’ quality of life. Although chemotherapy-induced nausea {{and vomiting}} (CINV) prevalence is high, treatment remains difficult. Palonosetron is a 5 -hydroxytryptamine receptor antagonist (5 -HT 3 RA) approved for treatment of CINV. The purpose of this review is to discuss existing and emerging therapeutic options, and examine studies focusing on palonosetron with regards to efficacy, pharmacology, tolerability, safety, and patient-derived outcomes. Methods: A literature search was conducted using Ovid MEDLINE and EMBASE to identify relevant studies using palonosetron alone or {{in combination with other}} antiemetics. Studies were extracted if they included complete response (CR), complete control (CC), no nausea, no vomiting, and no rescue medications as an endpoint. Studies were also included if safety endpoints were examined. Results: Palonosetron alone has been shown to improve CR and CC rates for patients receiving low, moderate, or high emetogenic chemotherapy. Rates were further improved with the addition of dexamethasone, a corticosteroid. Furthermore, the addition of neurokinin- 1 receptor antagonists, such as <b>netupitant</b> markedly improved efficacy profiles compared to palonosetron alone. Aprepitant is an antiemetic that has exhibited positive results in combination with palonosetron. Recently, a new drug consisting of <b>netupitant</b> and palonosetron (NEPA) has demonstrated significantly more efficacious prevention of CINV. Regardless of the combination, palonosetron has been well tolerated. The most common adverse events were constipation, headache, fatigue, and dizziness, with the majority of patients describing them as only mild or moderate. Conclusion: Palonosetron, alone or with other antiemetics, has improved CINV treatment due to its ability to significantly reduce delayed phases of CINV, compared to similar 5 -HT 3 RAs. Palonosetron is both more effective than first generation 5 -HT 3 RAs and safer, as it results in a smaller prolongation of the QTc interval, compared to other 5 -HT 3 RAs.

40|$|Combination {{antiemetic}} regimens targeting multiple molecular pathways {{associated with}} emesis {{have become the}} standard of care for prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) related to highly and moderately emetogenic chemotherapies. Antiemetic consensus guidelines from several professional societies are widely available and updated regularly as new data emerges. Unfortunately, despite substantial research supporting the notion that guideline conformity improves CINV control, adherence to antiemetic guidelines is unsatisfactory. While {{studies are needed to}} identify specific barriers to guideline use and explore measures to enhance adherence, a novel approach has been taken to improve clinician adherence and patient compliance, with {{the development of a new}} combination antiemetic. NEPA is an oral fixed combination of a new highly selective NK 1 receptor antagonist (RA), <b>netupitant,</b> and the pharmacologically and clinically distinct 5 -HT 3 RA, palonosetron. This convenient antiemetic combination offers guideline-consistent prophylaxis by targeting two critical pathways associated with CINV in a single oral dose administered only once per cycle.

40|$|Background: The {{objective}} was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of NEPA, an oral fixed combination <b>netupitant</b> (NETU, 300 mg) and palonosetron (PA, 0. 5 mg) compared with aprepitant and palonosetron (APPA) or palonosetron (PA) alone, to prevent chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) in patients undergoing treatment with highly or moderately emetogenic chemotherapy (HEC or MEC) in the UK. Scope: A systematic literature review and meta-analysis were undertaken to compare NEPA with currently recommended anti-emetics. Relative effectiveness was estimated over the acute (day 1) and overall treatment (days 1 – 5) phases, taking complete response (CR, no emesis and no rescue medication) and complete protection (CP, CR {{and no more than}} mild nausea [VAS scale < 25 mm]) as primary efficacy outcomes. A three-health-state Markov cohort model, including CP, CR and incomplete response (no CR) for HEC and MEC, was constructed. A five-day time horizon and UK NHS perspective were adopted. Transition probabilities were obtained by combining the response rates of CR and CP from NEPA trials and odds ratios from the meta-analysis. Utilities of 0. 90, 0. 70 and 0. 24 were defined for CP, CR and incomplete response, respectively. Costs included medications and management of CINV-related events and were obtained from the British National Formulary and NHS Reference Costs. The expected budgetary impact of NEPA was also evaluated. Findings: In HEC patients, the NEPA strategy was more effective than APPA (quality-adjusted life days [QALDs] of 4. 263 versus 4. 053; incremental emesis-free and CINV-free days of + 0. 354 and + 0. 237, respectively) and was less costly (£ 80 versus £ 124), resulting in NEPA being the dominant strategy. In MEC patients, NEPA was cost effective, cumulating in an estimated 0. 182 extra QALDs at an incremental cost of £ 6. 65 compared with PA. Conclusion: Despite study limitations (study setting, time horizon, utility measure), the results suggest NEPA is cost effective for preventing CINV associated with HEC and MEC in the UK...|$|E
