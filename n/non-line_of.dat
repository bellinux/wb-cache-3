The calculation speed, stability {{and accuracy of}} this algorithm are analyzed. The practical application verifies that Newton iterative calculation can meet the requirement <b>of</b> <b>non-line</b> calculation <b>of</b> process control of cold rolling.

Deformation resistance would affect the basic calculation of rolling force. Therefore, the calculation of deformation resistance directly determines {{the accuracy of the}} calculation of rolling force and affects the accuracy of strip thickness control. Many factors affect the deformation resistance. It is impossible to consider all these factors for the deformation resistance’s calculation model online. Therefore, in the actual process control of the production of cold rolling strip, we can use adaptive learning method of deformation resistance to improve the calculation accuracy of the deformation resistance model...|$|R

40|$|We present new {{spectra of}} {{dominant}} galaxies in X-ray selected clusters, which combine with our previously published spectra {{to form a}} sample of 256 dominant galaxies in 215 clusters; 177 of these {{are members of the}} ROSAT Brightest Cluster Sample. 27 % of the central dominant galaxies have emission-line spectra, all but 5 with line intensity ratios typical of cooling flow nebulae. A further 6 % show only [NII] with H-alpha in absorption. We find no evidence for an increase in the frequency of line emission with X-ray luminosity. Purely X-ray selected clusters at low redshift have a higher probability of containing line emission. The more H-alpha luminous galaxies have larger emission-line regions and show a higher ratio of Balmer to forbidden line emission, although there is a continuous trend of ionization behaviour across four decades in H-alpha luminosity. Galaxies with the more luminous line emission show a significantly bluer continuum, whereas lower-luminosity and [NII]-only line emitters have continua that differ little from those <b>of</b> <b>non-line</b> emitting dominant galaxies. Values of the Balmer decrement in the more luminous systems commonly imply intrinsic reddening of E(B-V) ~ 0. 3, and when this is corrected for, the excess blue light can be characterized by a population of massive young stars, which can also provide sufficient photoionization to produce the observed H-alpha luminosity. The lower H-alpha luminosity systems show a higher ionization state and few massive stars, requiring instead the introduction of a harder source of photoionization.

The signal fingerprint positioning algorithm [4, 18] is based on the mapping relationship between some parameters obtained from the received signal and the position information of the target node. The range-based positioning algorithm with round-trip-time (RTT) measurements [19] is often used to meet the requirement of high-precision positioning because of its high time delay resolution.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{cooperative}} localization {{of mobile}} nodes in <b>non-line</b> <b>of</b> sight (NLOS) situation is considered using a constrained square root unscented Kalman filter (CSRUKF). The NLOS measurements {{are used as}} quadratic constraints, which form a convex feasible region inside which {{the positions of the}} mobile nodes are supposed to be. The CSRUKF consists of two main stages: square root unscented Kalman filter (SRUKF) and sigma point projection. In the former, a conventional SRUKF is used to estimate the state vector and the Cholesky factor of the error covariance matrix. In the latter, a new set of sigma points are generated, and the ones violating the constraints are projected onto the feasible region by solving a set of convex quadratically constrained quadratic programs (QCQP). Each QCQP can be solved independently and in parallel for each sigma point violating the constraint, thus the algorithm is suitable for distributed processing.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, a {{two-stage}} robust distributed algo-rithm {{is proposed}} for cooperative sensor network localization using {{time of arrival}} (TOA) data without prior identification of <b>non-line</b> <b>of</b> sight (NLOS) links. In the first stage, to overcome the effect of outliers, a convex relaxation of the Huber loss function is applied so that by using iterative optimization techniques, good estimates of the true sensor locations can be obtained. In the second stage, the original (non-relaxed) Huber cost function is further optimized to obtain refined location estimates based on those obtained in the first stage. In both stages, a simple gradient descent technique is used {{to carry out the}} optimization. Through simulations and real data analysis, it is shown that the proposed convex relaxation generally achieves a lower root mean squared error (RMSE) compared to other convex relaxation techniques in the literature. Also by doing position refinement, the position estimates are improved and we can achieve an RMSE close to that of the other distributed algorithms which know a priori which links are in NLOS.

Although this approach {{can be used in}} any dispersive FSO system, in this paper we focus on <b>non-line</b> <b>of</b> sight (NLOS) ultraviolet (UV) systems relying on atmospheric scattering. Spectral amplitude encoding is applied on a broadband UV source using the same code families for the M-ary alphabet as used previously in SAC optical code division multiple access (OCDMA) systems. A differential struc-ture using two photomultiplier tubes is utilized in conjunction with various demodulation algorithms to decode the received signal. Intersymbol interference (ISI), received beam divergence and shot noise are considered as the main factors limiting the system performance. An upper bound on the bit error probability is presented and compared with simulation results for various geometries and for different code parameters. The maximum bit rate for a fixed bit error probability is calculated in terms of the link length, and results for different alphabet sizes are shown. By sacrificing spectral efficiency without becoming more susceptible to ISI, the proposed system can support higher rates and longer distances for the same performance compared with on-off keying systems.
