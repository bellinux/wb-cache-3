25|$|Nintendo Switch offers {{integration}} with third-party social networking services to provide social and sharing features. Unlike the Nintendo 3DS and Wii U, Nintendo does {{not plan to}} offer first-party social networking services, such as Miiverse or StreetPass, the latter owing to Nintendo's promotion of Switch as primarily being a home console. Players can register friends through Friend Codes as with previous Nintendo systems, searching for friends in the local network, through past multiplayer interactions, or via friends already registered on Nintendo mobile apps such as Miitomo and Super Mario Run linked to the corresponding Nintendo Account profile. Nintendo said it plans to provide other methods for registering friends, including through third-party social media and via Nintendo Network IDs. The Switch has no native support for Nintendo Network IDs, but users can link their Nintendo <b>Network</b> <b>ID</b> credentials on a Switch to a Nintendo Account profile, allowing them to link the system to their account, and accessing benefits such as shared eShop balances between the Switch and the Nintendo 3DS and/or Wii U.|$|E
2500|$|In the process, Espuelas became iconic as the [...] "poster boy" [...] of the Latin Internet, {{appearing}} {{on the cover of}} magazines, in television shows and even in CNN's own promotions: [...] a brief image of Espuelas was included, amongst other renowned politicians and celebrities, within the 15 second top-of-hour CNN on-air <b>network</b> <b>ID.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Miiverse (portmanteau of [...] "Mii" [...] and [...] "Universe") is an {{integrated}} social networking service, which allows players to interact {{and share their}} gaming experiences through their personal Mii characters. It was originally launched on Wii U and was launched on the Nintendo 3DS on December 11, 2013 via a firmware update. Its functionality {{is similar to the}} Wii U version albeit without the private messaging feature, and requires a Nintendo <b>Network</b> <b>ID.</b>|$|E
2500|$|PlayStation 3 console protects {{certain types}} of data and uses digital rights {{management}} to limit the data's use. Purchased games and content from the PlayStation Network store are governed by PlayStation's Network Digital Rights Management (NDRM). The NDRM allows users to access the data from up to 2 different PlayStation 3's that have been activated using a user's PlayStation <b>Network</b> <b>ID.</b> PlayStation 3 also limits the transfer of copy protected videos downloaded from its store to other machines and states that copy protected video [...] "may not restore correctly" [...] following certain actions after making a backup such as downloading a new copy protected movie.|$|E
2500|$|MTV {{launched}} on August 1, 1981, with an extended <b>network</b> <b>ID</b> featuring the first {{landing on the}} moon (with still images acquired directly from NASA), which was a concept of Seibert's executed by Buzz Potamkin and Perpetual Motion Pictures. The ID then cut to the American flag planted on the moon's surface changed to show the MTV logo on it, which rapidly changed into different colors and patterns several times per second as the network's original guitar-driven jingle was played for the first time. After MTV's launch, the [...] "moon landing" [...] ID was edited to show only its ending, and was shown {{at the top of}} every hour until early 1986, when the ID was scrapped in light of the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster. The ID ran [...] "more than 15,000 times each year" [...] according to Seibert.|$|E

50|$|The maps {{of known}} <b>network</b> <b>IDs</b> {{can then be}} used as a {{geolocation}} system—an alternative to GPS—by triangulating the current position from the signal strengths of known <b>network</b> <b>IDs.</b> Examples include Place Lab by Intel, Skyhook, Navizon by Cyril Houri, SeekerLocate from Seeker Wireless, openBmap and Geomena. Navizon and openBmap combines information from Wi-Fi and cell phone tower maps contributed by users from Wi-Fi-equipped cell phones. In addition to location finding, this provides navigation information, and allows for the tracking of the position of friends, and geotagging.|$|R
2500|$|The current logo was {{introduced}} in April 2008, with lowercase [...] "starz" [...] typing featuring a asteroid-shaped star inserted between the [...] "a" [...] and [...] "r"; the coloring of the logo was modified to an orange/gold rendering in April 2011. The channel replaced the opaque on-screen logos with a bright white logo bug on all channels and a bright orange bug for Starz HD as of April 7, 2008 and Starz Kids & Family's HD simulcast feed in July 2011. After the 2011 logo rebrand, the bright white version of the 2008 logo for Starz channels stayed on screen {{for the second time}} until September 2012 that it will reverted to two-minute version, along with Encore channels. After the current logo's introduction, the [...] "InfoBar" [...] began to once again serve only to promote programming on the main Starz channel, while it serves mainly as a <b>network</b> <b>ID</b> on some of its multiplex channels.|$|E
2500|$|Nintendo eShop is the Nintendo 3DS's online {{software}} distribution service. The eShop provides downloadable retail and download-only Nintendo 3DS titles, Virtual Console titles, and various applications and videos. It also {{allows users to}} purchase downloadable content (DLC) and automatically download patches for both physical and downloadable games. All content obtained from Nintendo eShop {{is attached to a}} Nintendo <b>Network</b> <b>ID</b> but can only be used in one system. Background downloading is possible via SpotPass, while playing games or in sleep mode. Up to ten downloads can be queued at a time and their status can be checked on the Home Menu. The Nintendo eShop supports simple user software reviews. Users can submit a review with [...] "stars" [...] ranging from one to five, representing its quality in a crescent order, and categorize software by whether it is suitable for hardcore or more casual players. User reviews can only be submitted after using the software for at least one hour.|$|E
2500|$|Starz's logo has {{incorporated}} {{a star in}} some form since its launch. In the original logo that was used from its launch in February 1994 until March 2005, the star was composed of a two silhouettes (one star being embedded within a larger one), and a [...] "STARZ!" [...] logotype styled after 1930s-era movie poster typography. The original accompanying graphics were set around a CGI movie theater, with the main <b>network</b> <b>ID</b> featuring seats that opened by themselves, various theater imagery and even images resembling the Caduceus, while feature presentation bumpers also heavily used the movie theater themes (using spotlights and film canisters) and the [...] "Encore 8" [...] branding. The [...] "theater" [...] look {{that had been used}} since the network's launch was ultimately abandoned in May 2002, when it switched to a package based around natural themes (particularly water); a seven-note fanfare was also introduced as a musical motif; the new look did not carry over to the multiplex channels. Starz! also introduced the [...] "InfoBar", a lower-third banner graphic that appears on-screen during promotional breaks and during the end credits of films seen on the channel, originally purposed to promote upcoming programs.|$|E
25|$|In 2005 the Southern Cross Ten Star {{arrived on}} screen {{differentiating}} the regional stations more clearly from metropolitan Network Ten. Southern Cross Ten continued to largely use <b>Network</b> Ten <b>IDs</b> and promos unchanged, but mixed in Southern Cross Ten versions of <b>network</b> <b>IDs.</b> Community Service Announcements and local news updates were branded with the Southern Cross Ten Star.|$|R
5000|$|... "I Love L.A." [...] was {{the first}} (and the last) music video aired on Cable Music Channel. The song was also used {{in some of the}} <b>network's</b> <b>IDs</b> and {{commercial}} promos.|$|R

2500|$|Over the years, TMC {{has used}} {{a myriad of}} unique, and {{sometimes}} bizarre logos and promotional concepts. The channel's original logo under the [...] "Movie Channel" [...] name incorporated a star outline made up of film strips with folded sides, indirectly referencing its previous identity as Star Channel. In 1981, the text for the network's name changed from the Broadway typeface to a stylized all-uppercase font (with a slightly enlarged letter [...] "M") augmented {{to the left and}} underside of the star. Beginning in 1983, the network alternately used a script logo (which varied slightly in style, depending on the promo or <b>network</b> <b>ID</b> it was displayed in), sometimes more often than its [...] "star" [...] logo. Promos using the [...] "script" [...] logo were aired on the network as late as 1986, although they were used less frequently from the summer of 1985 as the [...] "star" [...] logo was phased back to universal use within TMC's on-air imaging. Between 1985 and 1988, TMC began airing somewhat clever graphics for their time such as a [...] "tour of Hollywood" [...] introduction for its film presentations, which closed with a shot of the Hollywood skyline with a faint heart outline {{in the middle of the}} sky.|$|E
5000|$|The column Network Destination and Netmask {{together}} {{describe the}} <b>Network</b> <b>id</b> as mentioned earlier. For example, destination 192.168.0.0 and netmask 255.255.255.0 {{can be written}} as <b>network</b> <b>id</b> 192.168.0.0/24.|$|E
50|$|Nintendo {{originally}} {{planned for the}} Nintendo <b>Network</b> <b>ID</b> to become a prominent account system standard for all future Nintendo hardware releases, {{as well as any}} Nintendo-published apps released for non-Nintendo devices. However, in March 2016, Nintendo introduced Nintendo Account for non-Nintendo devices and the Nintendo Switch, although the new account service compliments Nintendo <b>Network</b> <b>ID</b> if users have one. For example, if users link their Nintendo <b>Network</b> <b>ID</b> to their Nintendo Account, they can share eShop funds between their Nintendo Switch and their Wii U/Nintendo 3DS.|$|E
5000|$|On December 9, 2013, {{the service}} was {{launched}} for the 3DS, along {{with the implementation of}} Nintendo <b>Network</b> <b>IDs.</b> In its current state, players are unable to submit and manage friend requests or send private messages.|$|R

5000|$|Each Z-Wave {{network is}} {{identified}} by a <b>Network</b> <b>ID,</b> and each device is further identified by a Node ID. The <b>Network</b> <b>ID</b> (also called Home ID) {{is the common}} identification of all nodes belonging to one logical Z-Wave network. The <b>Network</b> <b>ID</b> has a length of 4 bytes (32 bits) and is assigned to each device, by the primary controller, when the device is [...] "included" [...] into the Network. Nodes with different Network IDs cannot communicate with each other. The Node ID is the address of a single node in the network. The Node ID has a length of 1 byte (8 bits) and must be unique in its network.|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} {{problems that}} can be characterized by large dynamic graphs. Communication networks provide the prototypical example of such problems where nodes in the graph are <b>network</b> <b>IDs</b> and the edges represent communication between pairs of <b>network</b> <b>IDs.</b> In such graphs, nodes and edges appear and disappear through time so that methods that apply to static graphs are not sufficient. We introduce a data structure that captures, in an approximate sense, the graph and its evolution through time. The data structure arises from a bottom-up representation of the large graph as the union of small subgraphs, called Communities of Interest (COI), centered on every node. These subgraphs are interesting {{in their own right}} and we discuss two applications in the area of telecommunications fraud detection to help motivate the ideas...|$|R
