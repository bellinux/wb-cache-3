5|$|Van Gogh painted {{several groups}} of still lifes in 1885. During his two-year stay in Nuenen, he {{completed}} numerous drawings and watercolours, and nearly 200 oil paintings. His palette consisted mainly of sombre earth tones, particularly dark brown, and showed <b>no</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vivid colours that distinguish his later work.|$|E
5|$|Nutrients are transported {{throughout}} the coelom, including the mantle lobes, by cilia. The wastes produced by metabolism are broken into ammonia, which is eliminated by diffusion through the mantle and lophophore. Brachiopods have metanephridia, {{used by many}} phyla to excrete ammonia and other dissolved wastes. However, brachiopods have <b>no</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> podocytes, which perform {{the first phase of}} excretion in this process, and brachiopod metanephridia appear to be used only to emit sperm and ova.|$|E
5|$|On October 14, 1868, {{two weeks}} after Carpenter had {{returned}} to Fort Wallace with the survivors of Forsyth’s command, he was ordered out once again. Troops H and I of the 10th Cavalry sallied forth to escort Major Carr of the 5th Cavalry to his new command with supplies to Beaver Creek. Near there Carpenter's supply train and command was attacked by a force of about 500 Indians with <b>no</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 5th Cavalry present.|$|E
60|$|The day passed, and {{the second}} night, but there were <b>no</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> help from Rome.|$|R
60|$|But {{there were}} <b>no</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Indian. Strain their eyes {{as they might}} he did not appear.|$|R

5|$|When Quatermass and {{his team}} reach the crash area and succeed in opening the rocket, they {{discover}} that {{only one of the}} three crewmen, Victor Carroon, remains inside. Quatermass and his chief assistant Paterson (Hugh Kelly) investigate the interior of the rocket, and are baffled by what they find: the space suits of the others are present, and the instruments on board indicate that the door was never opened in flight, but there is <b>no</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other two crewmen.|$|E
5|$|As {{the weeks}} {{extended}} well beyond his initial optimistic forecast, Wild established and maintained routines and activities {{to relieve the}} tedium. A permanent lookout was kept {{for the arrival of}} the rescue ship, cooking and housekeeping rotas were established, and there were hunting trips for seal and penguin. Concerts were held on Saturdays, and anniversaries celebrated, but there were growing feelings of despondency as time passed with <b>no</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ship. The toes on Blackborow's left foot became gangrenous from frostbite, and on 15 June had to be amputated by the surgeons Macklin and James McIlroy in the candle-lit hut. Using the very last of the chloroform that had survived in the medical supplies, the whole procedure took 55minutes, and was a complete success.|$|E
5|$|During the night, {{the four}} boats became separated. Bulkeley spent time {{looking for the}} other three boats, {{but was unable to}} find them in the darkness. At dawn he gave up, and headed for one of the {{alternative}} hiding places. Kelly's PT-34 was the first to reach the rendezvous point, a cove on Tagauayan Island, two hours late at 09:30. There was <b>no</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other boats, and Rockwell, in the same boat with Kelly, was far from convinced that Kelly had found the correct island. Some repairs were made, and the boat was refueled by hand pumps from the drums. Two men were posted atop the island's tallest hill to watch out for the Japanese and the other boats.|$|E

5|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath of their disappearance, an international search was launched to find Nungesser and Coli. Aviation Digest sponsored a well-known pilot, Floyd Bennett, to search the area between New York and Newfoundland for nine days. The Canadian government search and rescue organizations also sent out two search aircraft (one of which crashed). Searchers including the French Navy, the U.S. Navy, and the Royal Canadian Navy that scoured the route, including Labrador, the northeast coast of the U.S. and the area around the St. Lawrence River. With <b>no</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> aircraft, further search efforts were abandoned.|$|E
5|$|On 9 September, the WSB's {{spokesman}} {{stated that}} the remaining six members of the patrol, who had now been held for over a fortnight, would only be released after a new government was formed in Sierra Leone, leading negotiators {{to conclude that the}} increasingly unrealistic demands were stalling tactics rather than a serious attempt to conclude the crisis. At around the same time, teams that had been observing the West Side Boys' base for four days reported that they had seen <b>no</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> captive soldiers in that time. There were also concerns that an assault would become more dangerous if the West Side Boys moved the hostages. The combination of these factors led COBRA to order an extraction mission.|$|E
5|$|She {{was next}} seen by Navy divers, the same year, lying upside {{down with her}} bow {{on the rim of}} the {{underwater}} bomb crater and stern angled toward the center. There was <b>no</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> superstructure or the big guns. The first diver to reach Arkansas sank up to his armpits in radioactive mud. When National Park Service divers returned in 1989 and 1990, the bottom was again firm-packed sand, and the mud was gone. They were able to see the barrels of the forward guns, which had not been visible in 1946.|$|E

60|$|They had already, {{for some}} time, made out <b>the</b> outline <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Rock; and Bob gazed anxiously seaward but could, as yet, see <b>no</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> enemy's cruisers.|$|R
5|$|Sydneys {{failure to}} reach Fremantle on 20 November was not {{initially}} cause for concern, as several factors might have delayed the cruiser, {{none of which}} were sufficient reason to break the order to maintain wireless silence. However, with <b>no</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cruiser by 23 November, shore-based wireless stations began transmitting orders for Sydney to break silence and report in. A raft of German survivors was recovered by a British tanker on 24 November, at which point a large-scale air and sea search began. During this search, which lasted until the evening of 29 November, 318 survivors from Kormorans 399 personnel were found, but apart from a carley float and a lifebelt, nothing from Sydney or the 645 aboard was recovered.|$|E
5|$|A {{farmer and}} his son were {{ploughing}} a field on the Isle of Mull using a team of four horses beside Loch Freisa, but work stalled {{after one of the}} horses lost a shoe and was unable to continue. Noticing a horse grazing nearby they decided to try using it as a replacement. Once harnessed to the wooden plough the horse appeared to be familiar with the task, and initially worked steadily. As it began to work towards an area closest to the loch, it became restless and the farmer gently used a whip to encourage the animal to continue. It reacted by immediately transforming into a gigantic boobrie, giving out a loud bellow and diving into the loch, pulling the plough and the other three horses with it. The frightened farmer {{and his son}} watched as the creature swam to the centre of the loch then dived underwater, taking the other horses and plough with it. Seven hours later there was still <b>no</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> three horses.|$|E
5|$|Around {{ten days}} later, the Persian army arrived at Thermopylae, and the Allies at Chalcis were {{informed}} by a ship, captained by Abronichus, {{which had been}} appointed to liaise between {{the army and the}} fleet. However, there was still <b>no</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Persian fleet, and the first day the Persians spent at Thermopylae passed without them launching an attack. The next day, the Persian fleet finally drew near to Artemisium, heading for the Gap of Skiathos (between the coast of Magnesia and Skiathos), when a summer gale (a 'Hellesponter' - probably a north-easterly storm) broke, driving the Persian fleet onto the mountainous coast. The storm lasted two days, wrecking approximately one third of the Persian ships. Meanwhile, at Thermopylae, the Persians had continued to wait for the Greeks to disperse, also choosing not to attack during the storm.|$|E
60|$|For {{another six}} weeks they worked hard. The wall was broken through in several places, but <b>no</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{existence}} <b>of</b> any other cavern or hiding-place was discovered.|$|R

5|$|However, in Berlin Meyerbeer faced many problems, {{including}} the enmity of the jealous Gaspare Spontini, who since 1820 had been Court Kapellmeister {{and director of}} the Berlin Hofoper. Complaints were made in the Berlin press about the delay of the Berlin premiere of Robert le diable (which finally took place in June 1832), and Meyerbeer's music was decried by the critic and poet Ludwig Rellstab. There was <b>no</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> German opera expected from Meyerbeer. Moreover, reactionary censorship laws prevented production of Les Huguenots in Berlin, (and indeed in many other cities of Germany). Nevertheless, Meyerbeer, who (as he wrote to a friend) 'years ago...swore to myself never to respond personally to attacks on my work, and never under any circumstances to cause or respond to personal polemics', refused to be drawn on any of these matters.|$|E
5|$|In {{southern}} Palestine the wet {{season was}} approaching with another thunderstorm and heavy {{rain on the}} night of 11 November. The dark cotton soil over which the Egyptian Expeditionary Force was now advancing would not need much more rain to turn it into impassable mud. But 12 November had been fine and the roads had dried out. The rolling maritime plain was dotted with villages on low hill tops surrounded by groves and orchards. These were in turn surrounded by hedges of prickly pear or cactus, making them strong natural places of defence. In the distance to the right the spurs and valleys of the Judean Hills were visible even to the invading British Empire troops near the Mediterranean coast. On 13 November the weather was clear and fine with at first <b>no</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ottoman Army.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, a young {{traveller}} named Bartz, {{resting in}} the woods near Tycoon, witnesses a meteorite plunge to the planet's surface just outside the castle. Bartz promptly investigates, discovering Lenna lying unconscious from attack. After rescuing her, they discover {{an old man in}} the debris with partial amnesia named Galuf. Lenna explains that she had been {{on her way to the}} Wind Shrine after her father. Galuf suddenly recalls that it was his original destination as well, opting to accompany her. Though the trio part ways, Bartz soon encounters Lenna and Galuf again assaulted by monsters in a quaking valley. The three travel together, finding all land routes blockaded by the upheavals caused by the meteorite's fall. Exploring an underground cavern, they encounter a den of pirates and their leader, Faris. With the help of the pirate captain, the group makes its way to the Wind Shrine to discover the shattered Crystal, but <b>no</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> missing king. The shards react to their presence, however, and an image of Tycoon appears, explaining to them that they must protect those Crystals that yet remain.|$|E
60|$|The {{sounds from}} below soon died away. Then Wolf Larsen came alone on deck. There {{was a slight}} flush under his bronze, but {{otherwise}} he bore <b>no</b> <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> battle.|$|R
40|$|Malassezia pachydermatis is a {{commensal}} yeast {{that can}} be found on the skin or mucosal membranes of dogs and other mammalians. M. pachydermatis is the only lipid-independent malassezia.

5|$|Nelson {{passed through}} the Straits of Gibraltar and took up {{position}} off Toulon by 17 May, but his squadron was dispersed and blown southwards by a strong gale that struck the area on 20 May. While the British were battling the storm, Napoleon had sailed with his invasion fleet {{under the command of}} Vice Admiral François-Paul Brueys d'Aigalliers. Nelson, having been reinforced with a number of ships from St Vincent, went in pursuit. He began searching the Italian coast for Napoleon's fleet, but was hampered by a lack of frigates that could operate as fast scouts. Napoleon had already arrived at Malta and, after a show of force, secured the island's surrender. Nelson followed him there, but the French had already left. After a conference with his captains, he decided Egypt was Napoleon's most likely destination and headed for Alexandria. On his arrival on 28 June, though, he found <b>no</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> French; dismayed, he withdrew and began searching to the east of the port. While he was absent, Napoleon's fleet arrived on 1 July and landed their forces unopposed.|$|E
5|$|The {{possibility}} that stellar evolution of either Sirius A or Sirius B could {{be responsible for}} this discrepancy has been rejected by astronomers {{on the grounds that}} the timescale of thousands of years is too short and that there is <b>no</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nebulosity in the system that would be expected had such a change taken place. An interaction with a third star, to date undiscovered, has also been proposed as a possibility for a red appearance. Alternative explanations are either that the description as red is a poetic metaphor for ill fortune, or that the dramatic scintillations of the star when rising left the viewer with the impression that it was red. To the naked eye, it often appears to be flashing with red, white and blue hues when near the horizon.|$|E
5|$|The villa {{was soon}} cleared of enemy troops once more, and when Frost {{returned}} to the beach, {{he found that the}} machine-gun nest had been destroyed by the mis-dropped troops of 'Nelson'; avoiding other enemy positions, they had reached the beach and attacked the machine-gun post from the flank. By this time it was 02:15 but there was <b>no</b> <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> naval force that was to evacuate the airborne troops. Frost ordered 'Nelson' to guard the inland approaches to the beach and then fired off an emergency signal flare; soon after that the naval force was seen approaching. The original plan for the operation had called for two landing craft at a time to land on the beach, but this had never been satisfactorily achieved during training; instead, all six landing craft landed at the same time, with the covering troops in the landing craft opening fire on German soldiers gathering {{at the top of the}} cliff.|$|E
