5000|$|In most breech loading guns it is {{essential}} to stop the erosion of the metal of the vent by preventing the escape of gas through it when the gun is fired. For this purpose the charges in such guns are ignited by [...] "vent-sealing tubes." [...] For muzzle loaded guns and small breech loading guns radially vented, especially those using black powder, the amount of erosion in the vent is not so serious. The charge is fired by ordinary friction tubes, which are blown away by the escape of gas through the vent. In all guns axially vented, vent-sealing tubes, which are <b>not</b> <b>blown</b> <b>out,</b> must be employed to protect the gunners from injury. This 'vent sealing' name remained part of British nomenclature, rather than a clearer name of 'primer' or 'firing' tubes, as used elesewhere.|$|E

Our chosen paths, journeys and distances that we took have been different, but the destination seems to be the same; of wanting to gaze toward a future that would not have to be through a crystal ball. If we searched through each chapter the emerging keywords that we all seem to have grappled with are Strengths-based practice, coping and resilience, and hope and wellbeing social work. Therefore we ask the following questions and attempt to answer these in this last chapter. Is there a methodology that allows us to talk about how things could be? When no one previously contemplated about these things? How can our social work practice be strengthened by the difficult situations that we encounter, 'just as a bonfire in a strong wind <b>not</b> <b>blown</b> <b>out,</b> but blazes even brighter?'

40|$|We {{present a}} {{detailed}} study of the star formation history (SFH) of the Tucana dwarf spheroidal galaxy. High quality, deep HST/ACS data, allowed us to obtain the deepest color-magnitude diagram to date, reaching the old main sequence turnoff (F 814 ~ 29) with good photometric accuracy. Our analysis, based on three different SFH codes, shows that Tucana is an old and metal-poor stellar system, which experienced a strong initial burst of star formation {{at a very early}} epoch (~ 13 Gyr ago) which lasted a maximum of 1 Gyr (sigma value). We are not able to unambiguously answer the question of whether most star formation in Tucana occurred before or {{after the end of the}} reionization era, and we analyze alternative scenarios that may explain the transformation of Tucana from a gas-rich galaxy into a dSph. Current measurements of its radial velocity do not preclude that Tucana may have crossed the inner regions of the Local Group once, and so gas stripping by ram pressure and tides due to a close interaction cannot be ruled out. On the other hand, the high star formation rate measured at early times may have injected enough energy into the interstellar medium to blow out a significant fraction of the initial gas content. Gas that is heated but <b>not</b> <b>blown</b> <b>out</b> would also be more easily stripped via ram pressure. We compare the SFH inferred for Tucana with that of Cetus, the other isolated LG dSph galaxy in the LCID sample. We show that the formation time of the bulk of star formation in Cetus is clearly delayed with respect to that of Tucana. This reinforces the conclusion of Monelli et al. (2010) that Cetus formed the vast majority of its stars after the end of the reionization era implying, therefore, that small dwarf galaxies are not necessarily strongly affected by reionization, in agreement with many state-of-the-art cosmological models.

30|$|Table  2 shows {{results of}} {{successful}} and not successful board manufacture, and lists the manufacture conditions of boards with a reduced resin content of 2.5  % {{to decrease the}} bonding strength. Board no. 5 and board no. 6 were compared to investigate {{the effects of the}} frame using an ordinary hot press. Board no. 5 was successfully manufactured without a frame in 4  min like board no. 1. Due to blowouts, board no. 6 was not manufactured with a frame in 4, 6, and 8  min. Table  1 shows that board no. 2 was successfully manufactured in 4 and 6  min. The only difference between board no. 6 and board no. 2 was the resin content of 2.5 and 5  %, respectively. All other conditions were the same. Board no. 6 had low resin content and thus had low bonding strength [13]; consequently, it could not resist the vapor pressure and <b>blew</b> <b>out,</b> irrespective of the pressing time.

30|$|Blowouts of particleboards were artificially {{induced by}} {{increasing}} the vapor pressure inside the boards.

Boards with a high resin content of 5  % showed high bonding strength and did <b>not</b> <b>blow</b> <b>out</b> when pressed at 190  °C, but <b>blew</b> <b>out</b> at a raised temperature of 210  °C to increase vapor pressure inside the boards, thereby showing that blowout occurred when vapor pressure inside the boards exceeded the bonding strength of isocyanate resin. Boards with a low resin content of 2.5  % had low bonding strength and <b>blew</b> <b>out</b> when manufactured without air injection, but were successfully manufactured with air injection that prevents blowouts. However, the injection of high-pressure air reduced the strength properties {{of the board and}} increased the coefficient of variation, likely due to the discharge of isocyanate resin from the boards. Therefore, very small local blowouts occurred inside the boards, which lowered the strength properties of some specimens and led to a large coefficient of variation. When the pressure of injected air was lowered, the strength properties increased and the coefficient of variation decreased. This was possibly because the low-pressure air allowed isocyanate resin to remain in the boards, resulting in virtually no parts showing very low-strength properties.|$|R

30|$|Although phreatic {{eruption}} does <b>not</b> <b>blow</b> <b>out</b> juvenile magma, it {{is a highly}} explosive phenomenon and thus wreaks severe damages to the adjacent areas of the crater by strong blasts, volcanic bombs, and heavy ash falls. To reduce the risks of volcanic disaster, in addition to gaining {{a better understanding of}} the physical processes of {{phreatic eruption}}, elucidation of the preparatory processes of eruption is required. Barberi et al. (1992) compiled the precursory activities of phreatic eruptions reported in scientific papers and found that almost two thirds of the compiled events accompanied some sort of precursory variation in seismicity and in the chemical components of underground water. Although they concluded that phreatic eruptions have precursory phenomena, they also indicated the difficulties in singling out specific precursors of eruptions based on the available data. Even if an adequate number of instruments for physical monitoring were used on and around the intended volcano, it would be generally difficult to evaluate future activities from the observed data up to a given time. Therefore, acquiring a sufficient number of experiences at many volcanoes is indispensable for extracting the common features of phreatic eruption to effectively understand its preparatory processes.|$|R

This perilous privilege, so dear to their age and species, had never been granted them before. Their excitement had no bounds. They could talk of nothing but this epoch-making adventure, now. But misfortune overtook Susy on the very morning of the important day. In a sudden outbreak of passion, she corrected Clara--with a shovel, or stick, or something of the sort. At any rate, the offence committed was of a gravity clearly beyond the limit allowed in the nursery. In accordance with the rule and custom of the house, Susy went to her mother to confess, and to help decide upon the size and character of the punishment due.

30|$|Blowouts are bursts {{caused by}} vapor {{inadvertently}} trapped inside a board during hot pressing when the hot press is opened. Therefore, blowouts should not occur if the bonding strength among particles exceeds {{the pressure of}} trapped vapor [10, 11]. Boards of high bonding strength were manufactured with a high resin content of 5  %. Table  1 shows results of successful and not successful board manufacture. S (successful) denotes successful board manufacture; NS (not successful) denotes unsuccessful manufacture due to no curing {{at the center of}} the board or blowout. Board no. 1 and board no. 2 were compared to determine the effects of the frame. Blowouts hardly occur in small boards (300  ×  300  mm) manufactured from even high-moisture particles using isocyanate resin [8]. This is possibly because small boards allow vapor to discharge from the board. In order to examine the effects of the air-injection press on preventing blowouts, a condition that induces blowouts needs to be created. Boards were manufactured with the frame. The frame inhibited vapor from escaping from the board, and the board <b>blew</b> <b>out</b> (Fig.  1 b). Board no. 1 was manufactured without a frame, thereby allowing vapor to escape from the edges. Board no. 1 was successfully manufactured in 4  min although the particles had moisture content as high as 25  %. However, board no. 1 was not manufactured in 2  min, since the center of the board was not cured due to short pressing time. In a previous study [1], urea–formaldehyde resin required 10  min for the manufacture of boards from high-moisture particles, but isocyanate resin required much less time. Board no. 2 was manufactured with a frame, and was predicted to <b>blow</b> <b>out.</b> However, blowout did not occur, and so the board was successfully manufactured in 4 and 6  min, showing no difference from board no. 1 in terms of pressing time. This was likely due to the high bonding strength of isocyanate resin producing (even among high-moisture particles) [6]. It presumably exceeded the vapor pressure in the board [11]. Table  1 lists the properties of the boards. The IB of board no. 1 was about 0.8  MPa, respectively, irrespective of pressing time. When considering atmospheric pressure of 0.1  MPa, the pressure inside the board must exceed vapor pressure of 0.9  MPa [0.8  MPa (IB) +  0.1  MPa (atmospheric pressure)] to induce blowout. On the other hand, the saturated temperature at saturated vapor pressure of 0.9  MPa is 171  °C. The temperature at the core of the board was likely to have been lower than the set pressing temperature of 190  °C and probably lower than the saturated temperature of 171  °C; thus, vapor pressure inside the board was lower than the sum (0.9  MPa) of IB and atmospheric pressure, and so the board presumably did <b>not</b> <b>blow</b> <b>out.</b>|$|R
