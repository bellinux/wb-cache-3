5|$|In November 2008, Qualcomm {{announced}} it would also compete against Intel in the <b>netbook</b> processor market with dual-core Snapdragon system-on-chips planned for late 2009. It demonstrated a Snapdragon processor that consumed less power than Intel chips announced {{around the same time}} and claimed it would also cost less when released. That same month, Qualcomm introduced a Snapdragon-based prototype <b>netbook</b> called Kayak that used 1.5GHz processors and was intended for developing markets.|$|E
5|$|Combining the <b>netbook</b> and desktop line, Norton Internet Security {{integrates}} Bandwidth metering, {{which controls}} the product's traffic usage and takes {{it down to}} minimum if necessary.

5000|$|Microsoft and Intel {{have tried}} to [...] "cement" [...] <b>netbooks</b> in {{the low end of}} the market to protect {{mainstream}} notebook PC sales, because they get lower margins on low-cost models. The companies have limited the specifications of <b>netbooks,</b> but despite this original equipment manufacturers have announced higher-end <b>netbooks</b> models as of March 2009.|$|R
50|$|<b>Netbooks</b> offer several {{distinct}} {{advantages in}} educational settings. First, their compact {{size and weight}} make for an easy fit in student work areas. Similarly, the small size make <b>netbooks</b> easier to transport than heavier, larger sized traditional laptops. In addition, prices ranging from $200-$600 mean the affordability of <b>netbooks</b> can be a relief to school budget makers. Despite the small size and price, <b>netbooks</b> are fully capable of accomplishing most school-related tasks, including word processing, presentations, access to the Internet, multimedia playback, and photo management.|$|R
50|$|ARM Holdings {{designs and}} {{licenses}} microprocessor technology with relatively low power requirements and low cost which would constitute an ideal basis for <b>netbooks.</b> In particular, the recent ARM Cortex-A9 MPCore series of processor cores have been touted by ARM {{as an alternative}} platform to x86 for <b>netbooks.</b> In June 2009, Nvidia announced a dozen mobile Internet devices running ARM-based Tegra SoC's, some {{of which will be}} <b>netbooks.</b>|$|R

On June 26, 2009, Microsoft started taking pre-orders at a discounted price for Windows 7 which was launched on October 22, 2009. Windows 7 has several editions, which acknowledge the rise of <b>netbook</b> computers with reduced processing power. On May 10, 2011, the conpany acquired Skype Technologies for US $8.5 billion.|$|E

50|$|It {{seems only}} a matter of time before the <b>netbooks</b> also be {{equipped}} with a touchscreen. The device will then be much more suitable as a newspaper reader. Many of the current <b>netbooks</b> which use Linux or Windows XP are not optimized for use with touchscreens. The successor of Windows Vista, Windows 7, will have touchscreen functionality. Microsoft will provide a special edition of Windows 7 for <b>netbooks.</b>|$|R

50|$|<b>Netbooks</b> {{typically}} have less powerful hardware than larger laptop computers {{and do not}} include an optical disc drive that larger laptops often have. Some <b>netbooks</b> do not even have a conventional hard drive. Such <b>netbooks</b> use solid-state storage devices instead, as these require less power, are faster, lighter, and generally more shock-resistant, but with much less storage capacity (such as 32, 64, or 128 GB compared to the 100 GB to 2 TB mechanical hard drives typical of many notebooks/laptop computers).|$|R

5000|$|Special [...] "children's" [...] {{editions of}} <b>netbooks</b> have been {{released}} under Disney branding; their low cost (less at risk), lack of DVD player (less to break) and smaller keyboards (closer to children's hand sizes) are viewed as significant advantages for that target market. The principal objection to <b>netbooks</b> {{in this context is}} the lack of good video performance for streaming online video in current <b>netbooks</b> and a lack of speed with even simple games. Adults browsing for text content are less dependent on video content than small children who cannot read.|$|R

25|$|One of the government's main {{policies}} was the Plano Tecnológico (Technological Plan), {{aimed at}} increasing Portugal's competitivity through {{the modernization of}} its economy.

A low-cost Intel-based <b>netbook</b> for use by children announced by Sócrates's government cabinet, named Magalhães (after Fernão de Magalhães) and packaged and assembled for the Portuguese school-age children and the low-to-middle income economy export market by the Portuguese company J.P. Sá Couto, headquartered in Matosinhos, Norte region, was among the government's innovations under the Technological Plan. Governmental efforts in the technological domain also included state support of a Portuguese factory that was owned by the German-based semiconductor company Qimonda AG, in Vila do Conde, Norte region, when the parent company filed a bankruptcy petition with the local court in Munich, Germany, in early 2009.

2500|$|Since 2011, the MacBook Air and iPad have supplanted the <b>netbook</b> as a {{computing}} device of choice between a smartphone and a full-fledged laptop. The 11" [...] MacBook Air carried the desirable essential attributes of a <b>netbook,</b> {{but without the}} drawbacks of a slower processor and less capable operating system, albeit at a higher price. At {{the high end of}} the performance spectrum of Apple's compact {{computing device}}s, the 11.6" [...] MacBook Air has revolutionized ultra-light portables with a traditional keyboard and display, which made fewer performance sacrifices albeit at considerably higher production cost. At the low end, Apple introduced the iPad—a different form factor than the <b>netbook,</b> but with improved computing capabilities and lower production cost. Both of these led to a decline in <b>netbook</b> sales, and most PC manufacturers have consequently discontinued their <b>netbook</b> lines in response. Capitalizing on the success of the MacBook Air, Intel promoted Ultrabook as a new high-mobility standard, which has been hailed by some analysts as succeeding where netbooks failed.|$|E
