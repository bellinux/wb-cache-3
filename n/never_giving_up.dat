500|$|Spielberg {{accepted}} the script after finding it had several similarities {{to his personal}} life, including the divorce of his parents (Ray and Mary Ann's divorce), and because {{the plight of the}} fictional survivors reflects his own uncertainty after the devastation of the September 11 attacks. For Spielberg, the characters' stories of survival needed to be the main focus, as they featured the American mindset of <b>never</b> <b>giving</b> <b>up.</b> Spielberg described War of the Worlds as [...] "a polar opposite" [...] to Close Encounters, with that movie featuring a man leaving family to travel with aliens, while War of the Worlds focused on keeping the family together. At the same time, the aliens and their motivations would not be much explored, as [...] "we just experience the results of these nefarious plans to replace us with themselves".|$|E
500|$|Mulan is {{the eighth}} {{official}} member the Disney Princess franchise, a media franchise marketed towards young girls. As children, the characters such as Mulan demonstrates {{the positive aspects}} of <b>never</b> <b>giving</b> <b>up,</b> not being restricted to gender roles and the importance of family and honor. These aspects of the film are more in keeping with a traditional Chinese perspective on cultural value, such as the importance of family and honor. Featured on the official Disney Princess website, the character's brief biography reads, [...] "Mulan is a loving girl who is always brave and bold. When her country needs it most, she disguises herself as a man and goes off to fight. She uses courage and determination to win the day." [...] Interestingly, Mulan is currently the only official member of the Disney Princess franchise who is technically not a legitimate princess [...] "in the traditional sense," [...] as she was neither born the daughter of a king or queen nor does she become princess consort by marrying a prince. Additionally, she is also the franchise's first and currently only East Asian member.|$|E

2500|$|The revived {{programme}} establishes that Time Lords invent {{their own}} names. In [...] "The Sound of Drums" [...] (2007), the Tenth Doctor remarks to the Master {{that they both}} chose their names, with the Master calling him sanctimonious for identifying himself as [...] "the man who makes people better." [...] "The Name of the Doctor" [...] and [...] "The Day of the Doctor" [...] elaborate that the Doctor chose the name as a promise {{for the sort of}} man he wants to be: [...] "Never cruel or cowardly. <b>Never</b> <b>giving</b> <b>up</b> and never giving in." [...] By contrast, the Eleventh Doctor spoke of the War Doctor (John Hurt) as being the man who broke that promise, being the one to fight in the Time War before learning the actual fate of the Time Lords. Since contradicted by the television series, the 2003 Telos novella Frayed by Tara Samms, set prior to the programme's first episode in 1963, presents the alternative explanation that the Doctor was given that name by medical staff on a foreign planet and liked it.|$|E
2500|$|The opening lines vaguely mention [...] "foreigners", but {{the portion}} may {{refer to the}} {{situation}} in Eminescu's own Bukovina, specifically to relatively recent presence there of Germans, Ukrainians, and especially Bukovina Jews. According to scholar Petru Zugun, there is nothing specifically xenophobic or antisemitic about Doina, whose introductory portion is simply a critique of [...] "unproductive foreigners", some of whom happened to be Jews, into Bukovina. Zugun further argues that Eminescu was even more critical of his co-nationals, when these were unproductive. Manolescu acknowledges that background is xenophobic, targeting Russians, Jews and Hungarians. However, he argues that the poem, unlike Eminescu's articles, can be appreciated without such [...] "sociological" [...] hints. Critic Alex. Ștefănescu explains Doina as [...] "sentimental, not ideological", to be understood as a declaration of love to Romania. He also notes that Eminescu was writing after [...] "century-long dramas" [...] provoked by [...] "foreign occupations or by foreigners peacefully infiltrated, but never really integrated, into Romanian society, <b>never</b> <b>giving</b> <b>up</b> on their ethnic solidarity." [...] As noted by culture critic Garabet Ibrăileanu, Eminescu was a xenophobe who, overall, preferred the Jews to the Romanian liberals, viewing the former as more honest and reliable.|$|E

60|$|Minas Geraes, {{the diamond}} district, {{is one of}} the richest provinces of Brazil. The {{inhabitants}} are almost entirely occupied in mining or in supplying the miners with the necessaries of life. Diggers and shopkeepers are the two principal classes, and of these the latter are best off; for their trade is steady and lucrative, while the success of the miners is very uncertain. Frequently a large sum of money and much time are expended in mining without any adequate result; but the merchants always find a ready sale for their merchandise, and, as they take diamonds and gold-dust in exchange, they generally realise large profits and soon become rich. The poor miner is like the gambler. He digs on in hope; sometimes finding barely enough to supply his wants,-- at other times making a fortune suddenly; but <b>never</b> <b>giving</b> <b>up</b> in despair, because he knows that at every handful of earth he turns up he may perhaps find a diamond worth hundreds, or, it may be, thousands of pounds.|$|E
