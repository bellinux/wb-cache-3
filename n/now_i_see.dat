500|$|Boycott's slow scoring led to {{increasing}} media pressure, and owing to his perceived selfish attitude, he was {{dropped from the}} team after the match. He remembered in 1987 that [...] "the decision stunned me at the time, though looking back <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>see</b> that it had become inevitable. I was mortified with embarrassment and filled with an angry, burning sense of injustice which I can remember clearly and painfully to this day." [...] A combination of low confidence and a throat infection limited Boycott to two further Test appearances, playing once more against India and once against Pakistan, {{for the rest of}} the year. He nevertheless again topped the domestic averages with 1260 at 48.46. In 1967, Boycott toured the West Indies with England, where he hit a rich seam of form. He scored 463 runs at 66.14 in a series England won 1–0.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile [...] Mitford had {{completed}} her latest book, [...] Voltaire in Love, {{an account of}} the love affair between Voltaire and the Marquise du Châtelet. [...] She considered it her first truly grown-up work, and her best. Published in 1957, it sold well, was taken seriously by the critics and [...] was warmly praised by Mitford's friends. Its writing had been hampered by painful headaches arising from her apparently failing eyesight and [...] worries that she might be going blind. The problem was resolved after a visit to the ophthalmic surgeon Patrick Trevor-Roper, who gave her new spectacles: [...] "It is heavenly {{to be able to read}} for a long time on end & <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>see</b> how handicapped I was when doing Voltaire". She then returned to writing [...] fiction, with Don't Tell Alfred, in which she revived Fanny Wincham, the narrator of The Pursuit of Love and Love in a Cold Climate, and placed her in a Paris setting as wife of the British ambassador. Several characters familiar from the earlier novels appear in minor roles. The book, published in October 1960, was popular with the public, but received indifferent reviews. Some of Mitford's friends disliked it, and she decided she would write no more fiction.|$|E
500|$|On {{the other}} hand, Stephen Hawking's {{appearance}} in the episode was acclaimed by critics. Although they generally disliked the episode, Martyn and Wood wrote that Hawking's cameo [...] "saves [...] from being very boring". Plath called the performance [...] "very funny", while Jane described it as [...] "great". Hawking reached seventh place in UGO's list of The Simpsonss [...] "Top 11 Guest Stars", and finished in fourteenth place in [...] "The Simpsons 20 best guest voices of all time" [...] by Ryan Stewart of The Boston Phoenix. Stewart wrote that Hawking's line [...] ""Your theory of a doughnut-shaped universe intrigues me, Homer. I may have to steal it" [...] was a [...] "memorable" [...] quote from the episode. Ethan Alter of The Morning Call described Hawking's cameo {{as one of the}} series' ten best, and wrote that Hawking's best line in the episode was [...] "I wanted to see your Utopia, but <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>see</b> it is more of a Fruitopia." [...] Writing for IGN, Eric Goldman, Dan Iverson and Brian Zoromski placed Hawking at number sixteen on their list [...] "Top 25 Simpsons Guest Appearances". They wrote that he had a [...] "fairly major" [...] role in the episode, and that he had [...] "several great lines".|$|E

2500|$|On {{the current}} state of cinema, Korine comments, [...] "When I {{look at the history of}} film – the early {{commercial}} narrative movies directed by D.W.

2500|$|Lunn {{was the son}} of a Methodist lay preacher, but in {{his book}} <b>Now</b> <b>I</b> <b>See</b> (1933) he writes that the {{religious}} instruction he received at school was so [...] "woolly" [...] that [...] "I was never a Methodist, nor, for that matter, an Anglican, in any proper sense of the term." [...] As a result, when he read Leslie Stephen's An Agnostic's Apology, [...] "I found myself defenceless — thanks to the miserable deficiency of Anglican education — against his onslaughts." [...] Lunn became an agnostic.|$|E

2500|$|About {{this time}} Burgess {{collapsed}} in a Brunei classroom while teaching history and {{was diagnosed as}} having an inoperable brain tumour. Burgess was given just a year to live, prompting him to write several novels to get money to provide for his widow. He gave a different account, however, [...] to Jeremy Isaacs in a Face to Face interview on the BBC The Late Show (21 March 1989). He said [...] "Looking back <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>see</b> that I was driven out of the Colonial Service. I think possibly for political reasons that were disguised as clinical reasons." [...] He alluded to this {{in an interview with}} Don Swaim, explaining that his wife Lynne had said something [...] "obscene" [...] to the British Queen's consort, the Duke of Edinburgh, during an official visit, and the colonial authorities turned against him. He had already earned their displeasure, he told Swaim, by writing articles in the newspaper in support of the revolutionary opposition party the Parti Rakyat Brunei, and for his friendship with its leader Dr. Azahari. Burgess' biographers attribute the incident to the author's notorious mythomania. Geoffrey Grigson writes, He was, however, suffering from the effects of prolonged heavy drinking (and associated poor nutrition), of the often oppressive south-east Asian climate, of chronic constipation, and of overwork and professional disappointment. As he put it, the scions of the sultans and of the élite in Brunei [...] "did not wish to be taught", because the free-flowing abundance of oil guaranteed their income and privileged status. He may also have wished for a pretext to abandon teaching and get going full-time as a writer, having made a late start.|$|E
