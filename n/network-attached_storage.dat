5|$|Encrypting {{ransomware}} {{returned to}} prominence in late 2013 with {{the propagation of}} CryptoLocker—using the Bitcoin digital currency platform to collect ransom money. In December 2013, ZDNet estimated based on Bitcoin transaction information that between 15 October and 18 December, the operators of CryptoLocker had procured about US$27 million from infected users. The CryptoLocker technique was widely copied in the months following, including CryptoLocker 2.0 (though not {{to be related to}} CryptoLocker), CryptoDefense (which initially contained a major design flaw that stored the private key on the infected system in a user-retrievable location, due to its use of Windows' built-in encryption APIs), and the August 2014 discovery of a Trojan specifically targeting <b>network-attached</b> <b>storage</b> devices produced by Synology. In January 2015, it was reported that ransomware-styled attacks have occurred against individual websites via hacking, and through ransomware designed to target Linux-based web servers.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} Slice, a new {{storage system}} architecture for highspeed LANs incorporating <b>network-attached</b> block <b>storage.</b> Slice interposes a request switching filter [...] called a /proxy [...] along the network path between {{the client and}} the network storage system (e. g., in a network adapter or switch). The purpose of the/proxy is to route requests among a server ensemble that implements the file service. We present a prototype that uses this approach to virtualize the standard NFS file protocol to provide scalable, high-bandwidth file service to ordinary NFS clients. The paper presents and justifies the architecture, proposes and evaluates several request routing policies realizable within the architecture, and explores {{the effects of these}} policies on service structur...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a recovery protocol for block I/O operations in Slice, a storage system architecture for highspeed LANs incorporating <b>network-attached</b> block <b>storage.</b> The {{goal of the}} Slice architecture {{is to provide a}} network file service with scalable bandwidth and capacity while preserving compatibility with off-the-shelf clients and file server appliances. The Slice prototype “virtualizes ” the Network File System (NFS) protocol by interposing a request switching filter at the client’s interface to the network storage system (e. g., in a network adapter or switch). The distributed Slice architecture separates functions typically combined in central file servers, introducing new challenges for failure atomicity. This paper {{presents a}} protocol for atomic file operations and recovery in the Slice architecture, and related support for reliable file storage using mirrored striping. Experimental results from the Slice prototype show that the protocol has low cost in the common case, allowing the system to deliver client file access bandwidths approaching gigabit-per-second network speeds. ...|$|R
40|$|Modern storage {{systems are}} sophisticated. Simple directattached storage devices are {{giving way to}} storage systems that are shared, flexible, virtualized and <b>network-attached.</b> Today, <b>storage</b> systems have their own administrators, who use {{specialized}} tools and expertise to configure and manage storage resources. Although the separation of storage management and database management has many advantages, it also introduces problems. Database physical design and storage configuration are closely related tasks, and the separation {{makes it more difficult}} to achieve a good end-toend design. In this paper, we attempt to close this gap by addressing the problem of predicting the storage workload that will be generated by a database management system. Specifically, we show how to translate a database workload description, together with a database physical design, into a characterization of the storage workload that will result. Such a characterization can be used by a storage administrator to guide storage configuration. The ultimate goal of this work is to enable effective end-to-end design and configuration spanning both the database and storage system tiers. We present an empirical assessment of the cost of workload prediction as well as the accuracy of the result...|$|R
40|$|<b>Network-attached</b> object-based <b>storage</b> {{separates}} data-path from control-path and enables direct {{interaction between}} clients and the storage devices. Clients {{interact with the}} file manager only to acquire the meta-data information and some cryptographic primitives, for example, access keys. Most of the current schemes rely on a centralized file manager to support these activities. This paper presents security mechanisms for decentralized authentication for object-based storage. The schemes are novel in several ways. First of all, they reduce the load on the file manager and free the system from central point of failure and denial of service attacks. We exploit Role-based Access Control (RBAC) to provide scalability and design authentication schemes that efficiently utilize RBAC. In most of the cases, the client needs to acquire only one access key from the file manager, {{which can be used}} by the client to further derive role-keys for the roles that he/she is permitted to play within an organization. Further, the number of cryptographic keys required for the purpose of authentication in these schemes is less as compared to the existing schemes. Finally, we also present two simple schemes that enable the clients to access objects stored on any device on the network using a single identity key. 1...|$|R
