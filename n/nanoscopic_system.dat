40|$|We {{overview}} the EDABI method developed {{recently and}} combining the exact diagonalization and ab initio aspects of electron states in correlated systems {{and apply it}} to <b>nanoscopic</b> <b>systems.</b> In particular, we discuss the localization-delocalization transition for the electrons that corresponds to the Mott-Hubbard transition in bulk systems. We show, that, the statistical distribution function for electrons in a nanochain evolves from the Fermi-Dirac-like to the Luttinger-liquid-like with the increasing interatomic distance. The concept of Hubbard subbands is introduced to nanoclusters, and corresponds to the HOMO-LUMO splitting in the molecular and organic solid states. Also, the nanochains exhibit magnetic splitting (Slater-like), even without the symmetry breaking, since the spin-spin correlations extend over the whole system. Thus, the correlated <b>nanoscopic</b> <b>systems</b> exhibit unique and universal features, which differ from those of molecular and infinite systems. These features define unique properties reflecting "the Mott physics" on the nanoscale. We also employ the EDABI method to the transport properties in <b>nanoscopic</b> <b>systems.</b> For example, we show that the particle-hole symmetry is broken when the tunneling conduction through H 2 molecule is calculated.

It was also proposed that linear arrangements of quantum dots {{could be used as}} quantum cascade laser. In this work we study the impact of electron-electron interactions on transport in a spinful serial triple quantum dot system weakly coupled to two leads. We find that due to electron-electron scattering processes the transport is enabled beyond the common single-particle transmission channels. This shows that the scenario in the serial quantum dots intrinsically deviates from layered structures such as quantum cascade lasers, where the presence of well-defined single-particle resonances between neighboring levels are crucial for device operation. Additionally, we check the validity of the Pauli master equation by comparing it with the first-order von Neumann approach.

40|$|Conventional and spin-related {{thermoelectric}} {{effects in}} electronic transport through a <b>nanoscopic</b> <b>system</b> exhibiting magnetic anisotropy $-$with both uniaxial and transverse components$-$ are studied theoretically in the linear response regime. In particular, a magnetic tunnel junction with a large-spin impurity $-$either a magnetic atom or a magnetic molecule$-$ {{embedded in the}} barrier is considered as an example. Owing to magnetic interaction with the impurity, conduction electrons traversing the junction can scatter on the impurity, which effectively can lead to angular momentum and energy exchange between the electrons and the impurity. As we show, such processes {{have a profound effect}} on the thermoelectric response of the system. Specifically, we present a detailed analysis of charge, spin and thermal conductance, together with the Seebeck and spin Seebeck coefficients (thermopowers). Since the scattering mechanism also involves processes when electrons are inelastically scattered back to the same electrode, one can expect the flow of spin and energy also in the absence of charge transport through the junction. This, in turn, results in a finite spin thermopower, and the magnetic anisotropy plays a key role for this effect to occur. Comment: 23 pages with 16 figures; version as publishe...|$|E

Finite element simulations should include modeling of complete production steps, having impact on final stress profiles. Realistically, this approach cannot be realized for complex devices.

Each side constitutes a unique sequence of 10 bases, i. e. 3. 4 nm in length, {{and can be}} considered the smallest practical unit of DNA in a nanotechnological context. Working with units of this length scale ensures a system fit for non-mundane molecular nanotechnology. The thesis features a progressive growth of the nanostructure, from {{the formation of the}} single-ringed hexagonal unit-cell to an asymmetric four-ring network of 17 nodes. Each structure is formed in a one-step self-assembly reaction. Alongside construction of the DNA-based nanostructural template, the thesis also illustrates three different aspects of functionalization. Firstly, a fixation strategy infusing stability in the delicate network by chemical ligation. The click chemistry based strategy will pave the way for modular build-up of larger nanostructures. Results show that multiple site-specific click reactions can perform simultaneously and independently of each other on a hybridized DNA template. Fixated modules are resistant to denaturing agent and can be freeze-dried. The second important aspect is incorporation of these DNA nanoconstructs onto lipid bilayers, for development of soft-surface nanotechnology. This creates controllable new interfaces in an aspiration towards membrane-integrated applications, e. g. mimicking a photosynthetic reaction centre. This thesis features two different molecular anchors: a multi-functional porphyrin moiety and a more universal lipid anchor. Both anchors are shown to align a DNA nanostructure with the membrane surface, a conformational arrangement that also depends on position of anchoring points. The last theme of this thesis is triplex recognition as a method for site-specific functionalization of preformed DNA nanostructures.
