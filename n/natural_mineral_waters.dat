2500|$|From {{early in}} the 19th century the {{existence}} of <b>natural</b> <b>mineral</b> <b>waters</b> was noted here and exploited. A local businessman Thomas Potter built, in 1831, the famous Ilkeston Bath {{at the bottom of}} Town Street attached to the Rutland Hotel. For over 60 years the baths helped tourism to the town at a time when spa towns like Bath and Harrogate enjoyed popularity. [...] 'If you're doubled in pain and thin as a lath, Come at once then and try, the famed Ilkeston Bath,' was a well known advertising slogan. A mixture of a general decline in the popularity of spa bathing and, reportable, contamination of the waters from mining activities led to the eventual closure of the baths just before 1900. The baths and the adjacent Rutland Hotel, which also enjoyed a revenue from tourism, no longer exist though they are remembered in the name of 'Bath Street'.|$|E

5000|$|Broadly speaking, [...] "mineral water" [...] is {{groundwater}} {{that has}} emerged {{from the ground and}} flowed over rock. Treatment of <b>mineral</b> <b>water</b> is restricted to removal of unstable elements such as iron and sulfur compounds. Treatment for such minerals may extend only to filtration or decanting with oxygenation. Free carbon dioxide may be removed only by physical methods, and the regulations for introduction (or reintroduction) of CO2 are strictly defined. Disinfection of <b>natural</b> <b>mineral</b> <b>water</b> is completely prohibited, including the addition of any element that is likely to change bacterial colony counts. If <b>natural</b> <b>mineral</b> <b>water</b> is effervescent, it must be labelled accordingly, depending on the origin of the carbon dioxide: naturally carbonated <b>natural</b> <b>mineral</b> <b>water</b> (no introduction of CO2); <b>natural</b> <b>mineral</b> <b>water</b> fortified with gas from the spring (reintroduction of CO2); carbonated <b>natural</b> <b>mineral</b> <b>water</b> (CO2 added following strict guidelines).|$|R

All Aeromonas caviae isolates from the <b>natural</b> <b>mineral</b> <b>water</b> belonged to the same clone, and an analogous clonal identity was found among Aeromonas hydrophila isolates. These two clones expressed no hemolytic or cytotoxic activities. Aeromonas isolates from surface waters showed high molecular heterogeneity and were not related to the clones found in the <b>natural</b> <b>mineral</b> <b>water.</b> The presence of aeromonads chronically found in the <b>natural</b> <b>mineral</b> <b>water</b> was a likely consequence of a localized development of a biofilm, with no exogenous contamination of the aquifer. Molecular fingerprinting of drinking water isolates is a useful tool in explaining possible reasons for bacterial occurrences. The health consequences of the presence of motile species of the genus Aeromonas in drinking water are the subject of much debate (7, 11, 12, 20, 25).
