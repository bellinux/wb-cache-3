The HESS consists of Batteries (BT) and Supercapacitors (SC), which are integrated {{to each other}} through the traction inverter, namely a Three-level Neutral-Point Clamped Converter (NPC). The proposed management strategy consists of exploiting SC over the low-speed operating range, thus coping with <b>vehicle</b> <b>acceleration</b> and deceleration needs for urban mobility mostly. Consequently, BT is preserved successfully from excessive cycling, it being also supported over the mid speed range.

Acceleration control using {{fuzzy logic}} is {{investigated}} {{in this paper}} for a plug-in series hybrid electric vehicle {{in order to improve}} the vehicle response to driver’s demand. The transient process of acceleration is mainly considered in this research. Fuzzy logic is used for motor transient torque control according to driver’s input and vehicle velocity, outputting a regulatory factor to increase motor torque transiently when driver’s acceleration pedal is pushed down deeply and to reduce the torque increment when acceleration process is close to over. Performance of fuzzy control is tested by MATLAB simulation. Simulation results indicate that the presented fuzzy algorithm is feasible and effective for improving <b>vehicle</b> <b>acceleration</b> ability without damaging stable velocity control characteristic; in simulation, <b>vehicle</b> <b>acceleration</b> time of 0 - 100 km/h has been reduced by 2. 4 seconds...|$|R
