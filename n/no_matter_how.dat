5|$|According {{to their}} Confucian ethics, elite and cultured scholar-officials viewed {{themselves}} as the pinnacle members of society (second only to the imperial family). Rural farmers were seen as the essential pillars that provided food for all of society; they were given more respect than the local or regional merchant, <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> <b>how</b> rich and powerful. The Confucian-taught scholar-official elite who ran China's vast bureaucracy viewed their society's growing interest in commercialism {{as a sign of}} moral decay. Nonetheless, Song Chinese urban society was teeming with wholesalers, shippers, storage keepers, brokers, traveling salesmen, retail shopkeepers, peddlers, and many other lowly commercial-based vocations.|$|E

5|$|Because the feats the Baron {{describes}} are overtly implausible, {{they are}} easily recognizable as fiction, {{with a strong}} implication that the Baron is a liar. Whether he expects his audience to believe him varies from version to version; in Raspe's original 1785 text, he simply narrates his stories without further comment, but in the later extended versions he is insistent that he is telling the truth. In any case, the Baron appears to believe every word of his own stories, <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> <b>how</b> internally inconsistent they become, and he usually appears tolerantly indifferent to any disbelief he encounters in others.|$|E

However, due to Kmart filing for bankruptcy in January 2002, Kmart wasn't able to open any more newly-built from the ground-up Super Kmart Center stores, and any Super Kmart Center stores that were under construction during Kmart's 2002 bankruptcy, construction had been halted <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> at <b>how</b> much the store was close to being completed.|$|R

5|$|Many unpitched {{percussion}} instruments, {{such as the}} snare drum or maracas, {{make use}} of the presence of random sounds or noise to produce a sound without any perceived pitch.

Within the orchestra unpitched percussion is termed auxiliary percussion, and this subsection of the percussion section includes all unpitched instruments of the orchestra <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> <b>how</b> they are played, for example the pea whistle and siren.|$|E

5000|$|Although {{the cause}} of writer's cramp is not well known, it was {{historically}} {{believed to be the}} result of excessive fine motor activity, possibly complicated by a tense or otherwise inappropriate writing technique. [...] More recently, Karin Rosenkranz et al. have suggested that this is not necessarily the case. [...] Musician's cramp (a similar focal dystonia which affects some 1% of instrumentalists) has historically been grouped together with writer's cramp because of this and their common task-specificity. Rosenkranz et al. have more recently identified significant differences between the two populations, however. [...] <b>No</b> <b>matter</b> exactly <b>how</b> it arises, researchers generally agree that these types of focal dystonia are the result of a basal ganglia and/or sensorimotor cortex malfunction in the brain.|$|R
5|$|The {{explanation}} of this instability {{begins with the}} existence of tiny perturbations in the stream. These are always present, <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> <b>how</b> smooth the stream is. If the perturbations are resolved into sinusoidal components, we find that some components grow with time while others decay with time. Among those that grow with time, some grow at faster rates than others. Whether a component decays or grows, and how fast it grows is entirely a function of its wave number (a measure of how many peaks and troughs per centimeter) and the radii of the original cylindrical stream.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{his travels}} Marlborough {{remained}} {{in close contact}} with the Electoral court of Hanover, determined to ensure a bloodless Hanoverian succession on Anne's death. He also maintained correspondence with the Jacobites. The spirit of the age saw little wrong in Marlborough's continuing friendship with his nephew, the Duke of Berwick, James II's illegitimate son with Arabella. But these assurances against a Jacobite restoration (which he had been taking out since the early years of WilliamIII, <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> <b>how</b> insincere), stirred Hanoverian suspicions, and perhaps prevented him from holding the first place in the counsels of the future GeorgeI.|$|E
5|$|When {{the price}} {{elasticity}} {{of demand for}} a good is perfectly elastic (Ed is − ∞), any increase in the price, <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> <b>how</b> small, will cause the quantity demanded for the good to drop to zero. Hence, when the price is raised, the total revenue falls to zero. This situation is typical for goods that have their value defined by law (such as fiat currency); if a 5 dollar bill were sold for anything more than 5 dollars, nobody would buy it, so demand is zero.|$|E

5000|$|... "Girls Chase Boys" [...] {{started out}} as a {{break-up}} song but took on a deeper meaning as I continued writing. More than just being about my experience, its focus shifted to include the idea that, <b>no</b> <b>matter</b> who or <b>how</b> we love, we are all the same. The video takes that idea one step further, and attempts to turn stereotypical gender roles on their head. Girls don't exclusively chase boys. We all know this. We all chase each other and in the end we are all chasing after the same thing: love.|$|R
