40|$|A Thesis {{submitted}} to the Department of Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering for the MSc in TelecommunicationsOptical solitons are attractive at very high bit rates as linear systems are impossible at such high bit rates due to dispersion effect. In a solitor propagation system no dispersion compensation fibers are used. The pulses propagate partly as a soliton between repeaters, and at the latter part as the power decreases the system exhibits linear properties. As the system exhibits quasi -soliton propagation effects the system cannot be evaluated by soliton equations. Such a system can only be evaluated using modeling. // As the optical soliton is of the envelope of light waves whose fundamental properties are described by the Nonlinear Schrc dinger Equation (NLSE), the NLSE {{can be used to}} present the soliton concept for application to communications.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} experimentally {{options for}} {{optical fibre transmission}} over oceanic distances. Its format follows the chronological evolution of ultra-long haul optical systems, commencing with opto-electronic regenerators as repeaters, progressing to optically amplified NRZ systems and finally solitonic propagation. In each case recirculating loop techniques are deployed to simplify the transmission experiments. Advances in high speed electronics have allowed regenerators operating at 10 Gbit/s to become a practical reality. By augmenting such devices with optical amplifiers {{it is possible to}} greatly enhance the <b>repeater</b> <b>spacing.</b> Work detailed in this thesis has culminated in the propagation of 10 Gbit/s data over 400, 000 km with a <b>repeater</b> <b>spacing</b> of 160 km. System reliability and robustness are enhanced by the use of a directly modulated DFB laser transmitter and total insensitivity of the system to the signal state of polarisation. Optically amplified ultra-long haul NRZ systems have taken on particular importance with the impending deployment of TAT 12 / 13 and TPC 5. The performance of these systems is demonstrated to be primarily limited by analogue impairments such as the accumulation of amplifier noise, polarisation effects and optical non-linearities. These degradations may be reduced by the use of appropriate dispersion maps and by scrambling the transmitted state of signal polarisation. A novel high speed optically passive polarisation scrambler is detailed for the first time. At bit rates in excess of 10 Gbit/s it is shown that these systems are severely limited and do not offer the advantages that might be expected over regenerated links. Propagation using solitons as the data bits appears particularly attractive since the dispersive and non-linear effects of the fibre allow distortion free transmission. However, the generation of pure solitons is difficult but must be achieved if the uncontrolled transmission distance is to be maximised. This thesis presents a new technique for the stabilisation of an erbium fibre ring laser that has aUowed propagation of 2. 5 Gbit/s solitons to the theoretical limit of ~ 18, 000 km. At higher bit rates temporal jitter becomes a significant impairment and to aUow an increase in the aggregate line rate multiplexing in both time and polarisation domains has been proposed. These techniques are shown to be of only limited benefit in practical systems and ultimately some form of soliton transmission control is required. The thesis demonstrates synchronous retiming by amplitude modulation that has allowed 20 Gbit/s data to propagate 125, 000 km error free with an amplifier spacing approaching the soliton period. Ultimately the speed of operation of such systems is limited by the electronics used and, thus, a new form of soliton control is demonstrated using all optical techniques to achieve synchronous phase modulation...|$|R

In our scheme, imperfect noisy entangled pairs of two qudits, i. e., two discrete-variable $d$-level systems, each of, in principle, arbitrary dimension $d$, are initially shared between the intermediate {{stations of the}} channel. This is achieved via local, sufficiently strong light-matter interactions, involving optical coherent states and their transmission after these interactions, and optical measurements on the transmitted field modes, especially (but not restricted to) efficient continuous-variable homodyne detections ("hybrid" here refers to the simultaneous exploitation of discrete and continuous variable degrees of freedom for the local processing and storage of entangled {{states as well as}} their non-local distribution, respectively). For qutrits we quantify the light-matter entanglement that can be effectively shared through an elementary lossy channel, and for a <b>repeater</b> <b>spacing</b> of up to 10 km we show that the realistic (lossy) qutrit entanglement is even larger than any ideal (loss-free) qubit entanglement.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{practical}} yet accurate approach {{for dealing with}} the problem of inserting repeaters along on-chip interconnect lines to meet delay and transition time requirements. This approach is {{based on the fact that}} the transition time and the delay at the far end of an interconnect segment are, respectively, independent and linearly dependent on the driving repeater's input transition time, as long as the ratio of the output to input transition time does not exceed a pre-defined value. In this context, we first derive simple closed form expressions for the optimal <b>repeater</b> <b>spacing</b> and sizing. Then, we propose a bottom-up "pseudo" hierarchical quadratic programming method for inserting and sizing repeaters in RC interconnects. This method, unlike Van Ginneken's [30], although largely based on it, is able to account for transition times at every potential repeater insertion point along the RC line of interest. The resulting technique can be readily incorporated in a more general RC network optimization scheme (through repeater insertion) where, eventually, wire sizing can be formulated either as an objective or a constraint. Accurate moment matching techniques for computing the RC delays and transition times are used in addition to an accurate CMOS inverter/repeater delay model that takes into account short channel effects that are prevalent in deep submicron (DSM) technologies.

Attenuations close to the intrinsic limits of the materials available have been reached in laboratory fibres and losses in optical cables installed under normal working conditions are below 5 dB/km. Bandwidths available range from 20 MHz km, in step-index multimode fibres with light emitting diode sources, to 10 GHz km with single-mode fibres and semiconductor lasers. If a truly monochromatic laser source operating in the region of minimum material dispersion becomes available then individual fibre capacities up to, or beyond, 100 GHz km are feasible. The major problems in cabling have already been largely overcome but further improvements in fibre strength, homogeneity and reproducibility are awaited. The difficulties are technological rather than fundamental and will succumb to good innovative engineering within the next few years. The same may be said of the requirements for such mundane, but vitally important, components as splices, connectors, couplers and even the lowly jack plug. Excellent and encouraging progress is being made with all of these items. Of the major hurdles remaining, that of a suitable optical source {{is by far the most}} difficult. The lifetime and reliability of existing semiconductor lasers are improving only slowly and need to be increased by at least an order of magnitude.
