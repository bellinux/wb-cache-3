5|$|In the {{beginning}} of the twentieth century the fraternity system continued to expand at such a rapid pace that university newspapers questioned if the increase in the number of fraternities would ever end.

Other chapters that are still active were founded at this time as well, such as Theta Chi and Phi Sigma Kappa.|$|E

5|$|The various {{historically}} driven {{changes have}} had a very significant influence on the architectural space of the city.

Very few historic buildings of the city have been preserved – the sights are merely an echo of the old historical shape of Białystok.|$|E

5|$|In 1901 Gaudí {{decorated}} {{the house of}} Isabel Güell López, Marchioness of Castelldosrius, and daughter of Eusebi Güell. Situated at 19 Carrer Junta de Comerç, {{the house had been}} built in 1885 and renovated between 1901 and 1904; it was destroyed by a bomb during the Civil War. The following year Gaudí took part in the decoration of the Bar Torino, property of Flaminio Mezzalana, located at 18 Passeig de Gràcia; Gaudí designed the ornamentation of el Salón Árabe of that establishment, made with varnished Arabian-style cardboard tiles (which <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>exist).</b>|$|E

5|$|San José, on the {{northwest}} shore of lake Petén Itzá, {{is the home of}} the last surviving speakers of the Itza language. The surname Kowoj still survives, but the Kowoj and Itza have fully merged and <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>exist</b> as separate ethnicities. In modern times there is a history of conflict between San José (the former Itza town of Chakok'ot) and neighbouring San Andrés (the former Kowoj-allied town of Chak'an), and this mutual hostility probably represents ancient hostility between the Itza and the Kowoj.|$|E
5|$|Support for {{establishing}} a republic {{instead of a}} monarchy was around 18 per cent in the United Kingdom in 2006, while a majority thinks that {{there will still be}} a monarchy in the United Kingdom in ten years' time, public opinion is rather uncertain about a monarchy still existing in fifty years and a clear majority believes that the monarchy will <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>exist</b> a century after the poll. Public opinion is, however, certain that the monarchy will still exist in thirty years. About 30 per cent are in favour of discontinuing the monarchy after Elizabeth's death.|$|E
5|$|The Lapidary is {{an open-air}} museum of {{primarily}} stone artworks, both originals and copies, which formerly decorated buildings that <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>exist.</b> Some are {{set into the}} walls around a 1969 terrace, while others are freestanding at various locations in the park. For example, in {{the walls of the}} terrace there are fragments of five carved heads from the keystones over windows, supposed to be from the Old City Hall of Berlin in Spandauer Straße and attributed to Georg Gottfried Weiyhenmeyer; two allegorical reliefs; 17th- and 18th-century building signs; a late Gothic vault keystone; and a 16th-century sandstone relief from the Stadtschloß.|$|E

5|$|Until recently, giant lemurs {{existed on}} Madagascar. Now {{represented}} only by recent or subfossil remains, they were modern forms {{that were once}} part of the rich lemur diversity that has evolved in isolation. Some of their adaptations were unlike those seen in their living relatives. All 17extinct lemurs were larger than the extant (living) forms, some weighing as much as 200kg (440lb), and {{are thought to have}} been active during the day. Not only were they unlike the living lemurs in both size and appearance, they also filled ecological niches that either <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>exist</b> or are now left unoccupied. Large parts of Madagascar, which are now devoid of forests and lemurs, once hosted diverse primate communities that included more than 20lemur species covering the full range of lemur sizes.|$|E
5|$|The {{historical}} {{range of}} the bobcat was from southern Canada, throughout the United States, and {{as far south as}} the Mexican state of Oaxaca, and it still persists across much of this area. In the 20th century, it was thought to have lost territory in the US Midwest and parts of the Northeast, including southern Minnesota, eastern South Dakota, and much of Missouri, mostly due to habitat changes from modern agricultural practices. While thought to <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>exist</b> in western New York and Pennsylvania, multiple confirmed sightings of bobcats (including dead specimens) have been recently reported in New York's Southern Tier and in central New York. In addition, bobcat sightings have been confirmed in northern Indiana, and one was recently killed near Albion, Michigan. In early March, 2010, a bobcat was sighted (and later captured by animal control authorities) in a parking garage in downtown Houston. By 2010, bobcats appear to have recolonized many states, occurring in every state except Delaware.|$|E
5|$|The {{introduction}} of deer to New Zealand {{began in the}} middle of the 19th century, and current populations are primarily European red deer, with only 15 percent being elk. There is significant hybridization of elk with the more numerous red deer to the extent that pure elk may <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>exist</b> in the wild in New Zealand. These deer have had an adverse impact on forest regeneration of some plant species, as they consume more palatable species which are replaced with those that are less favored by the elk. The long-term impact will be an alteration of the types of plants and trees found, and in other animal and plant species dependent upon them. As in Chile and Argentina, the IUCN has declared that red deer and elk populations in New Zealand are an invasive species.|$|E
