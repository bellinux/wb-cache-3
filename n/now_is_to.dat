25|$|Local level At {{the local}} level, in {{municipalities}} {{with more than}} 10,000 inhabitants Consultative Commissions for Local Public Services assist municipalities in regulating service providers. The Commissions were created through the 1992 water law. After the commissions initially met with little success, they were strengthened through another law in 2002. Their purpose <b>now</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> provide better information on public services through the review of annual reports by the service providers and to be consulted on key decisions such as the delegation of service provision {{to the private sector}} or the creation of a municipal enterprise. The consultative commissions are usually chaired by the mayor and their members are members of the municipal council or are nominated by the municipal council.

The series was renewed for that third season on May 7, 2015. By April 2015, Marvel had been developing a spinoff series to accompany the season, starring Adrianne Palicki and Nick Blood, but ABC opted not to go ahead with it, with entertainment president Paul Lee saying, [...] "We thought the right thing <b>now</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> leave [...] on S.H.I.E.L.D., because S.H.I.E.L.D. is so strong [...] the moment".|$|E

500|$|As Morrison began live {{performances}} of the 40-year-old album Astral Weeks in 2008, there were comparisons to his youthful voice of 1968. His early voice was described as [...] "flinty and tender, beseeching and plaintive". Forty years later, the difference in his vocal range and power were noticeable but reviewers and critic's comments were favourable: [...] "Morrison's voice has expanded to fill his frame; a deeper, louder roar than the blue-eyed soul voice of his youth – softer on the diction – but none the less impressively powerful." [...] Morrison also commented on the changes in his approach to singing: [...] "The approach <b>now</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> sing from lower down [...] so I do not ruin my voice. Before, I sang in the upper area of my throat, which tends to wreck the vocal cords over time. Singing from lower in the belly allows my resonance to carry far. I can stand four feet from a mic and be heard quite resonantly." ...|$|E

Following the All Blacks win over Wallabies to claim their 3rd World Cup, All Blacks Coach Steve Hansen praised McCaw's and Dan Carter's career efforts, distinguishing McCaw from Carter:“Richie is the best All Black we have ever had and Dan is a close second,” said Hansen. “The only thing that separates them is Richie has played 148 matches at flanker, which is unheard of - you put your body on the line every time you go there.

In August 2014, Adrianne Palicki was cast as Morse in a guest role, and later promoted to series regular with the season two episode [...] "Aftershocks". By April 2015, Marvel was developing a spin-off series focused on those characters with Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. showrunner Jeffrey Bell and writer Paul Zbyszewski. The spin-off would be based on storylines occurring {{at the end of the}} second season of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., and would receive its own pilot rather than a backdoor pilot. Palicki and Blood were in final discussions to headline the potential new series, but ABC passed on the project by May 7, 2015, when they announced their series renewals, cancellations, and pickups.

[...] However, some critics have argued that the quality of the show has declined in recent years during Jean's tenure. Jean has responded to this criticism by saying: [...] "Well, it's possible that we've declined. But honestly, I've been here the whole time and I do remember in season two people saying, 'It's gone downhill.' If we'd listened to that then we would have stopped after episode 13.

500|$|Halo 5 shows Halsey {{explaining}} that Cortana has recovered from Rampancy and attained meta-stability by {{gaining access to}} The Domain, a Forerunner database {{thought to have been}} destroyed with the firing of the Halo Array. How the UNSC and Halsey are aware that Cortana gained access to The Domain is unknown. She explains to Master Chief on Genesis that she survived by falling through slipspace, and likens the Domain to the [...] "Water Of Life for AI's". Her goal <b>now</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> preserve an ever lasting peace by subjugating all biological life. Whether this is a direct reaction to her link with The Domain, influence from The Didact (as their goals are now extremely similar) or some other external influence is yet to be known. With all Promethean troops and most Forerunner tech now under her command, and believing she cannot trust the Chief, who tries to reason with her, she converts most, if not all of the UNSC's AI constructs to her cause and begins her assault by plunging Humanity into a new Dark Age, using the Guardian's EMP abilities to shut off most UNSC technology, except The Infinity which barely escapes with Roland, the ship's AI, still intact and seemingly loyal. In the Legendary Ending, a Halo ring can be seen activating accompanied by Cortana humming. Whether she found it or built it is unknown although, considering she has access to the Domain, the Guardians, Forerunner tech and a multitude of different AI constructs at her disposal, building her own ring is not out of the realms of possibility.|$|E
500|$|The {{performance}} sparked criticisms {{from some}} parents {{on social media}} who believed the performance was [...] "provocative" [...] and [...] "inappropriate" [...] due to its risqué nature; Melissa Henson, {{a representative of the}} Parents Television Council {{said in a statement that}} the performance was [...] "suggestive" [...] before adding, [...] "We have seen pretty consistently enough inappropriate material , that a lot of parents have written these off." [...] Contrastingly, writing for ThinkProgress, Alyssa Rosenberg said of the controversy: [...] "This may not be the vision of marriage conservatives intended to try to promote [...] if marriage is a product that conservatives desperately want to sell, the smartest thing they could do right <b>now</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> hire Beyoncé and Jay-Z as a product spokescouple... they made marriage look fun, and sexy, and a source of mutual professional fulfillment." [...] On public reaction to the sexual performance, Lavanya Ramanathan of The Washington Post wrote: [...] "The Internet exploded, and it's not surprising. This is a couple who sat separately at awards ceremonies when they were dating several years ago." [...] On February 1, 2014, the couple performed the song again during Jay Z's performance at the DirecTv pre-Super Bowl party. Christopher R. Weingarten of Rolling Stone referred to the pair's chemistry as the highlight of the event and said the performance was [...] "smiles and hugs and laughs, with one of the most famous rappers in the world gladly playing hypeman" [...] in contrast to the Grammy performance. Nekesa Mumbi Moody writing for the Associated Press felt that it was the set's highlight. At the 2014 MTV Video Music Awards on August 25, 2014, Beyoncé performed [...] "Drunk in Love" [...] live during a medley consisting of songs from her self-titled album. The performance featured the singer dressed in a bejeweled bodysuit and a singalong from the audience. She started the performance on a set of steps, with numerous dancers in headstands around her and went to the stage afterwards. Nadeska Alexis from MTV News commented that when the song opened, [...] "the crowd really started to lose their composure".
