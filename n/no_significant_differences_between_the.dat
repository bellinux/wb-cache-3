25|$|Although Linus Pauling {{is known}} for highly respectable {{research}} in chemistry and biochemistry, he is also known for promoting the consumption of vitamin C in large doses. Pauling wrote multiple books endorsing vitamin C megadosing. Although he claimed and stood firm in his claim that consuming over 1,000mg is helpful for one’s immune system when fighting a head cold, the results of empirical research do not align with this view. Researchers Vitetta, Sali, Paspaliaris, and Reavley (2002) completed a double blind randomized control study with 400 healthy participants. Throughout the 18 month experiment, there were 189 reported cases of head colds. Researchers {{found that there were}} <b>no</b> <b>significant</b> <b>differences</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> medication groups, and taking 1,000mg of vitamin C at the first signs of a head cold did not help (Vitetta et al., 2002). There are also some minor yet unwanted ailments associated with vitamin C megadosing. These ailments were first noted in 1981 by Dr. Fong, who said that large doses of vitamin C can cause diarrhea and urethritis for limited amounts of time (Fong, 1981).|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the {{academic}} achievement and social adjustment of mentally retarded students who have had five years of special education with mentally retarded students who have had no special education. This comparison was made to determine if there is a <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> the two groups. The present study was not undertaken to defend or attack special education classes. The study was designed to determine to what extent academic and social <b>differences</b> existed <b>between</b> the two groups. It is hoped the results of this study can be used in planning programs for the educable mentally retarded children in the Weber County Schools. The writer proposes the following hypotheses: 1. There will be <b>no</b> <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> the two groups in reading. 2. There will be <b>no</b> <b>significant</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> the two groups in arithmetic. 3.

50|$|Even {{four days}} of {{mindfulness}} meditation training can significantly improve visuo-spatial processing, working memory and executive functioning.

These tasks were done before and after an 8-week mindfulness based stress reduction course (MBSR), and were compared to a control group. There were <b>no</b> <b>significant</b> <b>differences</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> groups, meaning that the MBSR course did not affect attentional control.

50|$|In {{some studies}} zinc {{lozenges}} caused acute adverse effects, such as bad taste, {{but none of}} the studies reported long term harm. Furthermore, many of the adverse effects, in particular regarding taste, may be caused by the specific lozenge composition and probably do not reflect the effects of zinc ions themselves. For example, zinc gluconate with dextrose or sugar becomes extremely vile in taste several weeks after manufacture, while zinc acetate dihydrate in a 1:100 mixture with dextrose by weight is permanently pleasant tasting. The most recent trial on zinc acetate found <b>no</b> <b>significant</b> <b>differences</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> zinc and placebo groups in the recorded adverse effects with a 92 mg daily dose of zinc.|$|E
