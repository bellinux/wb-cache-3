500|$|Shatner {{referred}} to The Original Series as [...] "cartoonish" [...] in Mind Meld, but later, upon questioning by a reporter, said, [...] "I <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> was a cartoon ... I <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> was beneath me." [...] In a February 2002 interview on Larry King Live, Shatner said Mind Meld {{was similar to}} My Dinner with Andre, and indicated that he and Nimoy were hoping to produce more films of a similar nature. Nimoy said of the film, [...] "This is the most personal insight the fans will get into our relationship and into aspects of Bill and myself they've never heard before." [...] In April 2002, Mind Meld was screened at the Newport Beach Film Festival. Two years later, Mind Meld {{was included in the}} bonus material when the first six Star Trek films were re-released as a special edition box set.|$|E
500|$|Reagan's {{ability to}} connect with Americans earned him the laudatory moniker [...] "The Great Communicator." [...] Of it, Reagan said, [...] "I won the {{nickname}} the great communicator. But I <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> was my style that made a difference—it was the content. I wasn't a great communicator, but I communicated great things." [...] His age and soft-spoken speech gave him a warm grandfatherly image.|$|E
500|$|A similar {{problem of}} {{interpretation}} has also plagued Narihira's last poem (quoted above). The fourth line, , is most normally read as [...] "(I never thought) {{that it might}} be yesterday or today", but has been occasionally interpreted by scholars to mean [...] "until yesterday I <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> might be today"; others take it as simply meaning [...] "right about now". But the emotion behind the poem is nonetheless clear: Narihira, who died in his fifties, always knew he must die someday, but is nonetheless shocked that his time has come so soon.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's pretty clear," [...] he said. [...] "I <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> of <b>it</b> before. But it don't {{mean they}} must have helped somebody, does it? Seems to me that 'never helped nobody' just {{naturally}} fails to say {{whether or not they}} helped somebody. I <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> of <b>it</b> before, and I'll never say it again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Dear me! {{all this}} may be true, but I <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> of <b>it</b> before. I <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> that these {{hard-working}} people had any ideas of taste!" ...|$|R

500|$|Bieber {{begins his}} verse {{approximately}} {{one minute and}} forty-five seconds in, singing the new lyrics [...] "It’s like every time you call me/ You know I can’t leave you lonely/ 'Cause I was always there when you need/ You said that you'd be there 'til the end/ What must I say/ I <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> would happen this way oh/ But I can tell if you're gone again/ got my number… things til the end.” Followed by another chorus and a verse by T.I., the song ends with a fade. A reviewer for the Inquisitor praised the collaboration, however Idolator's Christina Lee was critical of the remix, writing [...] "Two of them don’t sound like grown men — and they get the longer verses. French’s loopy rapping and off-key warbling is incoherent. Justin’s attempts to sound pained just sounds whiny." [...] It {{is the second time}} that Carey and Bieber have collaborated, the first being when the two re-recorded Carey's 1994 song [...] "All I Want for Christmas Is You" [...] for Bieber's 2011 Christmas album Under the Mistletoe.|$|E
2500|$|Dupas {{was again}} {{released}} from prison in February 1985. Approximately one month later, he raped a 21-year-old woman on a beach at Blairgowrie. After alighting from his car, Dupas followed the woman and attacked her, holding {{her to the ground}} at knifepoint before raping her. He later told police: [...] "I'm sorry for what happened. Everyone was telling me I'm OK now. I <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> was going to happen again. I only wanted to live a normal life." ...|$|E
2500|$|There {{was also}} an {{unofficial}} punishment: the blacklisting and social banishment of Aristides de Sousa Mendes and his family. [...] "My grandfather ... {{knew there would be}} some retribution, but to lose everything and have the family disgraced, he <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> would go that far," [...] said the hero's grandson, also named Aristides. The family took meals at the soup kitchen of the Jewish community of Lisbon. When told that the soup kitchen was intended for refugees, Sousa Mendes replied, [...] "But we too are refugees." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{top three}} {{finishers}} {{appeared on the}} podium and in the subsequent press conference, where Hamilton appeared relaxed, despite the tough physical conditions that the race was held in, and was already {{looking forward to the}} Malaysian Grand Prix: [...] "I felt fantastic. I <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> would have been as physically a breeze as it was. It is great preparation for Malaysia so bring it on, I am really looking forward to it." [...] He also commended the work of his McLaren team on both his scheduled stops, on laps 18 and 43 respectively: ...|$|E
2500|$|When it {{was time}} to choose the first single from the album The Final Countdown, Tempest {{suggested}} the song [...] "The Final Countdown". The band had not originally planned to release the song as a single, and some members wanted [...] "Rock the Night" [...] to be the first single. [...] "The Final Countdown" [...] was written to be an opening song for concerts, and they <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> would be a hit. When their record company Epic Records suggested, however, that it should be the first single, the band decided to release it.|$|E
2500|$|Signed by the French {{branch of}} {{recording}} label PolyGram (now Universal Music) after the single [...] "Şımarık" [...] {{was released in}} Europe in 1999, Tarkan reached number three in places like Switzerland, the Netherlands, France, and Germany. The song also reached number one in Belgium. He was awarded a gold disc at the Cannes Midem Awards. As the first artist of Turkish origin to sell 500,000 albums in France, in an interview for CNN he said: [...] "It feels wild, you know, because in the beginning I <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> was going to really happen. It's all in Turkish, you know, and nobody understands a word. But I think it's a groove. It's the kisses that are universal." ...|$|E

2500|$|More than 350,000 Pac-Man arcade {{cabinets}} {{were sold}} worldwide (retailing at around $2400 each) for $1billion within 18 months of release (inflation adjusted: $2.4billion in 2011). By 1982, the game had sold 400,000 arcade machines worldwide {{and an estimated}} 7 billion coins had been inserted into Pac-Man machines. In addition, United States revenues from Pac-Man licensed products (games, T-shirts, pop songs, wastepaper baskets, etc.) exceeded $1 billion (inflation adjusted: $2.33 billion in 2011). The game was estimated to have had 30 million active players across the United States in 1982. Nakamura said in a 1983 interview that though he did expect Pac-Man to be successful, [...] "I <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> would be this big".|$|E
2500|$|Oberman {{described}} her time on EastEnders as [...] "hectic", leading her to depart the show during December 2005. However, {{the role of}} Chrissie has remained a defining point of her career. In a recent interview, Oberman remarked: [...] "Chrissie was such a wonderful character and the show was watched by so many people, especially the murder of Den, that it opened up doors that I <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> would. I had some fantastic offers when I left, there was film and theatre... it was wonderful for me; EastEnders {{is a very good}} calling card." [...] Oberman has also recently declared her willingness to return to the part of Chrissie and EastEnders, even if only to provide a resolution for the character.|$|E
2500|$|An {{anonymous}} {{review in}} the September 1815 Christian Observer stated, [...] "To the poem of Roderick, Mr. Southey has annexed a voluminous collection of notes. The taste of our elder authors in this respect is now entirely obsolete. Our Shakespeares and Miltons <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> necessary to ballast their poetry with a mass of prose, and perhaps felt secure that, if they found the text, posterity would not fail to find the commentary." [...] The review concluded, [...] "Those productions, in the mean time, have a far more than compensating merit. On the present occasion, if the commentator of Roderick appears scarcely worthy of the poet, yet {{he must be a}} very fastidious, or a very dull reader, who does not find the evil of possessing the commentary, infinitely overpaid by the gratification of reading the poem." ...|$|E

2500|$|In January 2008, it was {{announced}} that Lords had been cast in Kevin Smith's comedy Zack and Miri Make a Porno (2008). She said that at first she wanted to refuse but changed her mind after reading the script. [...] "It was really great that in taking the movie, because I didn't plan on going back to work right away, but I was dying to work with Kevin. I <b>never</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> would be on something called Zack and Miri Make a Porno. What? So I went and I read the script at his house and I was prepared to say no. I thought I have the perfect out. I just had a kid. No one is going to blame me if I say I just can't do this right now. But it made me laugh out loud and it made me just literally cry. It was just funny." [...] Initially, Lords had a topless scene in the movie, but refused since she would breastfeed in between the takes. Katie Morgan, another former pornographic actress, also appeared in the film.|$|E
2500|$|When it {{was time}} to choose the first single from the album, Tempest {{suggested}} [...] "The Final Countdown".

It became a worldwide success, peaking at number 1 in 25 countries, including the United Kingdom, France, West Germany, and Italy. In the USA, it peaked at number 8 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number 18 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. The song has been a regular in Europe concerts ever since its live debut on the premiere of the band's Final Countdown Tour on 29 April 1986 in Gävle, Sweden and arguably became the band's most recognizable and popular song. One of the most memorable performances of the song took place in Stockholm, Sweden on 31 December 1999, as part of the Millennium celebrations.|$|E
