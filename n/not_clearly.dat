5|$|In 1961, Ghiorso et al. {{obtained}} the first isotope of lawrencium by irradiating californium (mostly californium-252) with boron-10 and boron-11 ions. The mass number of this isotope was <b>not</b> <b>clearly</b> established (possibly 258 or 259) at the time. In 1965, 256Lr was synthesized by Flyorov et al. from 243Am and 18O. Thus IUPAC recognized the nuclear physics teams at Dubna and Berkeley as the co-discoverers of lawrencium.|$|E
5|$|Adjuvant {{chemotherapy}} {{refers to}} the use of chemotherapy after apparently curative surgery to improve the outcome. In NSCLC, samples are taken of nearby lymph nodes during surgery to assist staging. If stage II or III disease is confirmed, adjuvant chemotherapy improves survival by 5% at five years. The combination of vinorelbine and cisplatin is more effective than older regimens. Adjuvant chemotherapy for people with stage IB cancer is controversial, as clinical trials have <b>not</b> <b>clearly</b> demonstrated a survival benefit. Chemotherapy before surgery in NSCLC that can be removed surgically also appears to improve outcomes.|$|E
5|$|Adopting the {{theories}} of academic historian Patricia Crone as a basis, Holland asserted {{that there was little}} hard evidence for the origins of Islam and asked why it took several decades after the death of Muhammad for his name to appear on surviving documents or artifacts.

5|$|Congenital liver abnormalities, such as Caroli's {{syndrome}} (a {{specific type}} of five recognized choledochal cysts), {{have been associated with}} an approximately 15% lifetime risk of developing cholangiocarcinoma. The rare inherited disorders Lynch syndrome II and biliary papillomatosis have also been found to be associated with cholangiocarcinoma. The presence of gallstones (cholelithiasis) is <b>not</b> <b>clearly</b> associated with cholangiocarcinoma. However, intrahepatic stones (called hepatolithiasis), which are rare in the West but common in parts of Asia, have been strongly associated with cholangiocarcinoma. Exposure to Thorotrast, a form of thorium dioxide which was used as a radiologic contrast medium, has been linked to the development of cholangiocarcinoma as late as 30–40 years after exposure; Thorotrast was banned in the United States in the 1950s due to its carcinogenicity.|$|E
5|$|George Washington {{was born}} in Kortrijk, Belgium to Jean Guillaume Washington (John William Washington) of England and Marie Louise Tant of Belgium, on May 20, 1871.Following then-current {{nationality}} law, which considered fatherhood primary, Washington was a British subject until he was naturalized as an American in May 1918.

5|$|On 13 November 1962, Tsarapkin {{indicated}} that the Soviet Union would accept a proposal drafted by US and Soviet experts involving automated test detection stations ("black boxes") and {{a limited number of}} on-site inspections. The two sides disagreed over the number of black boxes, however, as the US sought 12–20 such stations and the Soviet Union rejected any more than three. On 28 December 1962, Kennedy lowered the US demand to 8–10 stations. On 19 February 1963, the number was lowered further to seven, as Khrushchev continued to insist on no more than three. Kennedy was willing to reduce the number to six, though this was <b>not</b> <b>clearly</b> communicated to the Soviet Union. On 20 April 1963, Khrushchev withdrew support for three inspections entirely.|$|E
5|$|The Marshall Court possessed {{jurisdiction}} {{in criminal cases}} only via writs of error from state courts, original writs of habeas corpus, and certificates of division from the circuit courts. In three cases involving certificates of division, the Marshall Court decided issues of double jeopardy, but did <b>not</b> <b>clearly</b> rely on the Double Jeopardy Clause. Similarly, the Marshall Court discussed the level of detail required for a sufficient indictment without explicitly citing the Information Clause of the Sixth Amendment.|$|E
5|$|The {{cylinder}} is inspected externally for dents, cracks, gouges, cuts, bulges, laminations {{and excessive}} wear, heat damage, torch or electric arc burns, corrosion damage, illegible, incorrect or unauthorised permanent stamp markings, and unauthorised additions or modifications.

If the inner surface is <b>not</b> <b>clearly</b> visible it should first be cleaned by an approved method which does not remove {{a significant amount of}} wall material. When there is uncertainty whether a defect found during visual inspection meets the rejection criteria, additional tests may be applied, such as ultrasonic measurement of pitting wall thickness, or weight checks to establish total weight lost to corrosion.|$|E

The source of their dopamine input is <b>not</b> <b>clearly</b> established—it may come from dopamine that circulates in the bloodstream and derives from the sympathetic nervous system, or it may be synthesized locally by other types of pancreatic cells.|$|E
5|$|The {{phylogeny}} of Anthozoans is <b>not</b> <b>clearly</b> {{understood and}} a number of different models have been proposed. Within the Hexacorallia, the sea anemones, coral anemones and stony corals may constitute a monophyletic grouping united by their six-fold symmetry and cnidocyte trait. The Octocorallia appears to be monophyletic, and primitive members of this group may have been stolonate. The cladogram presented here comes from a 2014 study by Stampar et al. which was based on the divergence of mitochondrial DNA within the group and on nuclear markers.|$|E

5|$|The species inhabits a {{strip of}} 25 {{equatorial}} African countries, very nearly ranging from the east to west coasts of the continent. The exact boundaries of this strip are <b>not</b> <b>clearly</b> defined, as the species' territory overlaps with that of other baboon species. In many places, this has resulted in cross-breeding between species. For example, considerable hybridization has occurred between the olive baboon and the hamadryas baboon in Ethiopia. Cross-breeding with the yellow baboon and the Guinea baboon has also been observed. Although this has been noted, the hybrids have not as yet been well studied.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} North American auto market, by 2007 Canada had {{available}} 51 {{models of}} E85 flex-vehicles, most from Chrysler, Ford and General Motors, including automobiles, pickup trucks, and SUVs. The country had around 1.6million capable flex fuel E85s on the roads by 2014. However, most users are not aware they own an E85, as vehicles are <b>not</b> <b>clearly</b> labeled as such, {{and even though the}} newer models have a yellow cap in the fuel tank informing that the vehicle can handle E85, most users are still not aware because there are hardly any gas stations offering E85. Another major restriction for greater E85 fuel use is the fact that by June 2008 Canada had only three public E85 pumps, all located in Ontario, in the cities of Guelph, Chatham, and Woodstock. E85 fueling is available primarily for fleet vehicles, including 20 government refueling stations not available for the public. The main feedstocks for E85 production in Canada are corn and wheat, and there were several proposals being discussed to increase the actual use of E85 fuel in FFVs, such as creating an ethanol-friendly highway or ethanol corridor.|$|E
5|$|Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy {{wrote the}} {{majority}} opinion for the Court, which declined to overturn the state court's decision because fair-minded jurists could disagree over whether Alvarado was in custody. Kennedy noted that there were facts for and against the claim that Alvarado was in custody. Facts pointing towards custody included that the interview took place at a police station, the interview lasted for two hours, Alvarado was not told {{he was free to}} leave, and Alvarado's parents were not allowed to be present during the interview. Facts weighing against custody included that Alvarado was not transported to the police station by police, Alvarado was not threatened or told he would be placed under arrest, and the interview focused on the crimes of Alvarado's friend, not Alvarado's crimes. The Court was not tasked with conducting a separate inquiry into the issue of custody, rather, the Court was tasked with granting relief only if the lower court's decision is objectively unreasonable. Kennedy wrote that, given this standard, the state court's decision was reasonable because it was <b>not</b> <b>clearly</b> unreasonable.|$|E
