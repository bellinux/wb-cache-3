5|$|Tina (McShera) {{arrives at}} a Victorian villa for a séance. Hives (Shearsmith) settles Tina before {{retrieving}} Talbot (Steadman), who arrives shrouded in black and carrying a doll. Talbot, an elderly woman with heavy cataracts, speaks in a high-pitched voice, unnerving Tina. When the séance begins, objects fly around the room, Talbot's voice becomes demonic and ectoplasm seeps from her mouth. Hives encourages Tina <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> the circle, but she does so when a blue-faced demon (Starkey) appears behind her. She is terrified until Hives reveals himself to be Terry, {{the host of a}} hidden camera programme called Scaredy Cam.|$|E
5|$|Hector and Tabitha leave. Katy is spooked by the house, {{especially}} when she finds a stuffed cat on the sofa. She sees an old photograph of Hector, Tabitha and Andras as children, but Andras does not look disabled. Katy's friend Shell arrives and plays with Hector's stairlift, sending it upstairs. Katy warns Shell <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> anything, and is startled to see the now-live cat. Katy tries to call her father so she can leave, but the house has no mobile phone signal and the house phone's party line is tied up. As she prepares to leave, the stairlift returns downstairs and Andras's bell rings. Katy is scared of going upstairs, but, at Shell's insistence, the two go to check on him.|$|E

After recovering from her suicide attempt, Edie discovers that Carlos has $10 million in an offshore bank account. She promises he can trust her with the secret, just as she can trust him <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> her heart.

5|$|This forced Tiridates {{to confront}} the Romans with his army, as they {{approached}} Artaxata. The Roman force, reinforced by a vexillatio of X Fretensis, marched in a hollow square, with the legions supported by auxiliary horsemen and foot archers. The Roman soldiers were under strict orders <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> formation, and despite repeated probing attacks and feigned retreats by the Parthian horse archers, they held together until nightfall. During the night, Tiridates withdrew his army, abandoning his capital; its inhabitants promptly surrendered and were allowed to leave unmolested, but the city was torched, since the Romans could not spare sufficient men for garrisoning it.|$|E

25|$|In {{many places}} {{throughout}} the Hebrew Scriptures – particularly the Book of Hosea – Israel is figured as Yahweh's wife or bride. Malachi's discussion of divorce {{may also be}} understood to conform to this metaphor. Malachi {{could very well be}} urging his audience <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> faith with Yahweh (the God of Israel) by adopting new gods or idols. It is quite likely that, since the people of Judah were questioning Yahweh's love and justice (1:2, 2:17), they might be tempted to adopt foreign gods. William LaSor suggests that, because the restoration to the land of Judah had not resulted in anything like the prophesied splendor of the messianic age which had been prophesied, the people were becoming quite disillusioned with their religion.|$|E
25|$|In chapter 44, Third reluctantly relates a tale where Thor and Loki {{are riding}} in Thor's chariot, which is pulled by his two goats. Loki and Thor {{stop at the}} house of a peasant farmer, and there they are given lodging for a night. Thor slaughters his goats, prepares them, puts them in a pot, and Loki and Thor sit down for their evening meal. Thor invites the peasant family who own the farm to share with him the meal he has prepared, but warns them <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> the bones. Afterward, at the {{suggestion}} of Loki, the peasant child Þjálfi sucks the bone marrow from one of the goat bones, and when Thor goes to resurrect the goats, he finds one of the goats to be lame. In their terror, the family atones to Thor by giving Thor their son Þjálfi and their daughter Röskva.|$|E
500|$|Sanger's {{trial began}} in January 1917. She was {{supported}} by a large number of wealthy and influential women who came together to form the Committee of One Hundred, which was devoted to raising funds for Sanger and the NBCL. The committee also started publishing the monthly journal Birth Control Review, and established a network of connections to powerful politicians, activists, and press figures. Despite the strong support, Sanger was convicted; the judge offered a lenient sentence if she promised <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> the law again, but Sanger replied [...] "I cannot respect the law as it exists today."Engelman, p. 91. She served a sentence of 30 days in jail.|$|E

500|$|Antestor {{are one of}} the few {{bands in}} the Christian metal scene who use corpse paint in their {{appearances}} and on photos. One example is the booklet photos in the album The Return of the Black Death, depicting Antestor in Norsemen outfits and black and white face paints at a snowy Norwegian mountain location. Sometimes the group uses art blood, as known for the session bassist Ravn Furfjord's (Frosthardr) appearance at the Bobfest 2004 concert. The band explains that corpse paint [...] "is the same for us as masking is for actors or mimes; One way to express certain feelings in the battle we are in. The main purpose is to concentrate on God and <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> a lance in side issues like these." ...|$|E

I didn’t follow any models—not even my own". The more rules he broke, the more pleased Groening and Jean were with the result. Contrary to Banksy, who lives a life in secrecy, Kricfalusi was involved in every detail and even oversaw the dubbing of the final soundtrack. While Kricfalusi animated the 2D parts, he had John Kedzie to help him with the computer graphics and Sarah Harkey and Tommy Tanner to do the assistant animation.|$|E

500|$|In January 1999, Richard Evans {{was working}} out how the game judge the {{morality}} of the player's behaviour. Mark Webley (who had programmed the creature's artificial intelligence on a testbed version) had become project manager, ensuring routines were listed on task schedules. He stated that this was [...] "a hundred times more difficult" [...] than similar tasks at Bullfrog Productions. By March, the team had expanded to 17 people including five artists, five game programmers, two engine programmers, and a sound programmer. Lionhead wanted a maximum of 25 people so as <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> the [...] "team spirit" [...] atmosphere. Black & White was shown at E3 1999 where it was judged the most original game. At this time, Lionhead were considering 15 cover designs provided by Electronic Arts.|$|E

Only now, she and Homer get brought back before Judge Harm and have their heads and hands locked up in old-fashioned wooden stocks. Not being able to bare the punishment any longer, they break free and decide to get back at the judge. When the plan goes awry, they accidentally sink the judge's houseboat and are once again brought into court. Just as Judge Harm is ready to bang her gavel, Judge Snyder comes back from his fishing trip and declares a verdict of [...] "Boys will be boys," [...] dismissing the case. While driving home afterwards, Marge makes the entire family promise <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> the law again for a whole year, which Homer instantly breaks when he runs over Hans Moleman.|$|E
500|$|The band {{returned}} to the studio in February 1990 to record Tyr, the follow-up to Headless Cross. While not technically a concept album, some of the album's lyrical themes are loosely based on Norse mythology. Tyr was released on 6 August 1990, reaching number 24 on the UK albums chart, but was the first Black Sabbath release <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> the Billboard 200 in the US. The album would receive mixed internet-era reviews, with Allmusic noting that the band [...] "mix myth with metal in a crushing display of musical synthesis", while Blender gave the album just one star, claiming that [...] "Iommi continues to besmirch the Sabbath name with this unremarkable collection". The band toured in support of Tyr with Circus of Power in Europe, but the final seven UK dates were cancelled because of poor ticket sales. For {{the first time in}} their career, the band's touring cycle did not include US dates.|$|E

500|$|Chiptune artist Luke Esquivel ("A_Rival") {{composed}} {{the music for}} the game. Esquivel became involved when he approached Zong Hui via YouTube and requested to being full-time musician for the game in 2009/2010 after comparing his music with Zong Hui's previous musician. When composing the music for Street Fighter X Mega Man, Esquivel combined Mega Man themes with Street Fighter themes on certain songs. In other songs, he would use elements from various Mega Man songs in order <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> the cohesion of the original soundtrack. Esquivel based most of the sounds {{on the first two}} Mega Man games, but had also used sounds from Mega Man 3, 4, and 5. Esquivel also added original compositions within several songs including two completely original compositions: [...] "Willy Map Theme" [...] {{and the beginning of the}} [...] "Ending" [...] theme. The soundtrack blends popular themes from both franchises together (such as mixing Snake Man's theme from Mega Man 3 with Dhalsim's theme from Street Fighter II). The official soundtrack titled Street Fighter X Mega Man OST was released for free on Esquivel's website on December 18, 2012. An EP with a total of four tracks titled Street Fighter X Mega Man X-tended Vol. 1 was released on February 8, 2013.|$|E
500|$|Lynch as Sue {{received}} {{high praise}} for her acting. Canning wrote that she [...] "stole the episode" [...] and [...] "perfectly portrayed a woman [...] hard heart was trying terribly <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>break,</b> but {{not being able}} to stop it." [...] BuddyTV John Kubicek stated, [...] "it's impossible for me to say that Lynch wasn't exceptional, because her slow breakdown and attempt to cover-up her emotions was well done and fit perfectly with the character." [...] Respers France commented that [...] "we got to see the range and complexity of Sue Sylvester", and Sandra Gonzalez of Entertainment Weekly said that Lynch did an [...] "outstanding job of delivering even the funniest quips with an underlying sense of sadness". Sue's characterization in the series was criticized by several reviewers, however. Amy Reiter of The Los Angeles Times stated that the [...] "consistent inconsistency of Sue's character is wearing thin", and that [...] "our sense of her fails to advance, wandering endlessly between pure evil and pure love for her sister." [...] Futterman called the episode a [...] "too-little-too late attempt at redemption for Sue's poor characterization this season." [...] VanDerWerff wrote that the episode [...] "feels very self-consciously like a way to just remove her character from the table for the season finale", that [...] "it feels very self-consciously like an attempt by the show to address the fact that the character doesn't make any sense", and criticized the death of Jean: [...] "killing her solely to right a wayward character arc is lazy writing, and no amount of actor commitment can wholly save it." [...] Fallon described the funeral plot line as [...] "pure, classic Glee: Egregiously random, emotionally manipulative, wholly unnecessary to plot development, and, in the end, deeply moving." ...|$|E
