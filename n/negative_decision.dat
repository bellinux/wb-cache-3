40|$|The {{work was}} carried out to {{investigate}} differences in visual search characteristics between groups of observers with different levels {{of experience in the}} task of pulmonary nodule detection in chest radiology and we report here on these differences in respect of time related decisions. Volunteer observers were divided into three groups depending on their level of expertise. There were eight radiologists, eight radiographers and eight novices. Their task was to detect pulmonary nodules in a test bank of 120 digitized posteroanterior (PA) chest radiographs. Five of the eight radiographers were tested twice: once before and once after a 6 -month training programme in interpretation of the adult chest radiograph. During each test session the observers' eye movements were tracked. Data on the observers' decisions through Alternate Free Response Operating Characteristic (AFROC) methodology were correlated to their eye-movement and fixation patterns.

40|$|The {{wealth of}} general {{knowledge}} {{resulting from the}} Human Genome Project will provide the opportunity for individualized health information to be obtained through simple medical tests. The conclusiveness that might be associated with this new type of health information could have serious deleterious consequences if misused. Employers have used a range of techniques varying in intrusiveness to evaluate potential employees (e. g., personality tests, drug tests). Survey data, anecdotal evidence, and case law (e. g., Norman-Bloodsaw v. Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, 1998) suggest that genetic discrimination has occurred under some circumstances. The legal debate over whether genetic discrimination is adequately remedied by existing legislation (Nance, Miller, 2 ̆ 6 Rothstein, 2002) raises a fundamental question that is being examined {{for the first time}} by this dissertation: would employers use genetic test information to make differential hiring recommendations? ^ Three studies examined whether health information affects hiring recommendations by manipulating genetic test and family history information for a mental and physical disorder. Generalizability of the findings was tested by using different samples (students v. community) and by adding variables (job-relatedness of disorder, work experience, severity of diagnosis). ^ Findings consistently demonstrated that health information does affect hiring recommendations, as well as other employment-related decisions. A positive test or family history of a disorder (and a more severe diagnosis) predicted more <b>negative</b> <b>decisions.</b> Mental disorder presence consistently predicted more <b>negative</b> <b>decisions.</b> While effect sizes suggest that family history and genetic test information have equal impact, the effects for family history varied more. Students and community members made similar patterns of decisions; the only difference between them was the community sample 2 ̆ 7 s tendency to give higher negative ratings to candidates with a positive test or family history for a disorder. The additionally manipulated variables of work experience or job relatedness of disorder had no significant effects. Future research should examine whether these findings generalize to disorders other than those used here. Nevertheless, the findings suggest that health-based information may be used when employment-related decisions are made. ...|$|R

40|$|This study {{set out to}} {{establish}} the type and nature of decision-making that managers displayed at work, and ways in which those decisions {{may be related to}} managers’ stereotyping of their colleagues. Ninety nine managers, drawn from six age-gender categories, made 594 employment decisions on six different age-gender categories of workplace colleagues. Managers’ employment decisions were found to vary according to differences in the managers’ own age-gender category with younger female managers more negative in their decision-making and younger male, older male and older female managers more positive in their decisions. The study made innovative use of a Personal Construct Theory-based (PCT) methodology (Kelly, 1955), to gain insights into managers’ decision-making. A process of measuring manager-colleague social proximity determined managers’ perceived differences from colleagues, and provided a means of comparing social distance measures with managers’ employment decisions. Research aimed {{to establish}} whether managers’ perceived social proximity with colleagues could vary according to differences in managers’ or colleagues’ age-gender categories, and if colleagues perceived more socially proximate would be assigned positive decisions by managers and those colleagues more distant, <b>negative</b> <b>decisions.</b> Study results confirmed managers’ perceived social proximity with colleagues varied according to differences in managers’ and colleagues’ age-gender categories and managers were positive in their decisions on socially proximate, younger colleagues and negative in their decision-making, on more socially distant older ones. Stereotype research in the study sought to determine levels of abstraction with which managers held information in their stereotypes, and uses to which managers put that information in making employment choices between colleagues. A PCT-based methodology helped identify managers’ workplace stereotypes and established relations between managers’ stereotypes and their employment decisions. The managers’ more meaningful interpretation of colleagues, expressed through superordinacy of constructs and commonality of usage of salient constructs, helped describe managers’ stereotyping processes and identified those stereotypes managers were most likely to act on in their decision-making. The managers’ stereotypes were found to hold both positive and negative prejudicial perceptions of the same person and to vary according to colleagues’ age-gender category. Stereotype research results showed positive superordinate constructs associated with managers’ stereotypes on younger age-gender categories as significantly related to managers’ positive decisions on younger male and female colleagues. On the other hand, negative superordinate constructs associated with stereotypes on older female colleagues were significantly related to managers’ <b>negative</b> <b>decisions</b> on the older female category. Positive stereotypes on younger colleagues, describing them as helpful and hardworking, were related to more positive employment decisions on younger males and females while negative stereotypes describing older females as traditional in approach and not being a good training investment were related to more <b>negative</b> <b>decisions</b> made on their category. Stereotype and decision research carried out in the study established the nature of managers’ discriminatory decision-making and relation to managers’ stereotyping of colleagues. Research results proved particularly useful in describing the nexus between managers’ decision-making and stereotyping processes. Such results make an important contribution to current stereotype and decision research and practice. The methodology employed in this study is capable of being readily applied and can provide improved transparency of stereotypes thus facilitating changes to stereotyping and discriminatory employment practices operating in managers’ workplaces...|$|R

40|$|According to {{the life}} mission theory, the essence of man is his purpose of life, which comes into {{existence}} at conception. This first purpose is always positive and in support of life. This is not {{in accordance with the}} everyday experience that man also engages in evil enterprises born out of destructive intentions. This paper presents a theory about the evil side of man, called the �anti-self� (the shadow), because it mirrors the self and its purpose of life. The core of the anti-self is an evil and destructive intention opposite to the intention behind the life mission. The evil side of man arises when, as the life mission theory proclaims, man is denying his good, basic intention to avoid existential pain. The present theory of the anti-self claims that all the <b>negative</b> <b>decisions</b> accumulated throughout the personal history, sum up to a negative or dark anti-self, as complex, multifaceted, and complete as the self. All the <b>negative</b> <b>decisions</b> taken through personal history build this solid, negative, existential structure. The anti-self, or shadow as Carl Gustav Jung used to call it, is a precise reflection of man�s basically good and constructive nature. When mapped, it seems that for most or even for all the many fine talents of man, there is a corresponding evil intention and talent in the person�s anti-self. As man is as evil as he is good, he can only realize his good nature and constructive talents by making ethical choices. Ethics therefore seem to be of major importance to every patient or person engaged in the noble project of personal growth. Understanding the nature and structure of the evil side of man seems mandatory to every physician or therapist offering existential therapy to his patient. The theory of anti-self makes it possible to treat patients with destructive behavioral patterns, who want to be good deep in their heart, by helping them let go of their evil intentions. The anti-self also seems to explain the enigma of why human beings often commit suicide. Integrating the shadow often leads to dramatic, subjective experiences of ubiquitous light in an �unpersonal� form, of enlightenment, or of meeting light and consciousness in a personal, universal form, known as G-d...|$|R
