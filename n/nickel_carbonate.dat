The MnCO 3 QDs/NiH-Mn-CO 3 composite electrode exhibited a remarkable maximum specific capacitance of 2641. 3 F g(- 1) at 3 A g(- 1) and 1493. 3 F g(- 1) at 15 A g(- 1). Moreover, the asymmetric supercapacitor with MnCO 3 QDs/NiH-Mn-CO 3 composites as the positive electrode and graphene as the negative electrode showed an energy density of 58. 1 W h kg(- 1) at a power density of 900 W kg(- 1) as well as excellent cycling stability with 91. 3 % retention after 10 000 cycles, which exceeded the energy densities of most previously reported nickel or manganese oxide/hydroxide-based asymmetric supercapacitors. The ultrahigh capacitive performance is attributed {{to the presence of}} the high surface area core-shell nanostructure, the well dispersed MnCO 3 quantum dots, and the high conductivity of MnCO 3 quantum dots as well as the synergetic effect between multiple transition metal ions.
