5|$|At {{the onset}} of war in Korea, No.77 Squadron was self-supporting, the largest flying unit in the RAAF. It {{comprised}} 299 officers and men, 40 Mustangs, 3 CAC Wirraways, 2 Douglas C-47 Dakotas and 2 Austers. The added burden of combat operations made this situation untenable after the squadron went into action in Korea, leading {{to the formation of}} No.391 (Base) Squadron at Iwakuni, {{at the same time as}} No.91 Wing headquarters. RAAF base squadrons were responsible for administrative, logistical, medical, communications and security functions. Staffed mainly by former No.77 Squadron members, in the first year of its existence No.391 Squadron had to try to overcome severe shortages of winter clothing and equipment. Further problems arose when No.77 Squadron converted to Gloster Meteors between April and July 1951, as spares for the British-made jet were harder to obtain than for the American Mustang. <b>No</b> <b>longer</b> <b>could</b> No.391 Squadron source parts from the US Fifth Air Force as it had up till this point. Disposal of the Mustangs and their spares also caused headaches; the process took two years, causing storage issues. The base squadron faced another challenge in January 1952, following a controversial change in role for the Meteors, from air-to-air combat to ground attack, which necessitated obtaining supplies of rockets and modification of the aircraft to carry them.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, {{controversy}} {{between the}} local organisation Galleri Texas and the state-owned corporation Follo Futura arose, regarding the hiring contract {{of the station}} building, and which of them were to operate the cultural meeting place. Follo Futura, which together with the Norwegian National Rail Administration and Rom Eiendom officially owned the station building wanted {{to take over the}} café business. They argued that they were better fit to operate it, since Galleri Texas did not have the economical capacity to run the café with the art exhibition and gift shop the whole week. The local community wanted Galleri Texas to operate the café, arguing that replacing a local company for a governmental one would weaken the local and patriotic spirit of the café. On 1 January 2010, the operation of the café and the cultural meeting place was transferred from Galleri Texas to Follo Futura, since Galleri Texas <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>could</b> pay the rental costs. In 2010, smoke was tumbling out of the station, but it turned out that it was only a cigarette that had not been quenched, and had been laying overnight in a flower basket.|$|E
5|$|A {{high-level}} {{delegation of}} the Soviet Central Committee flew to Poland {{in an attempt}} to block removing pro-Soviet members of Politburo mainly Soviet and Polish Marshal Konstantin Rokossovsky. Soviet delegation was led by Nikita Khrushchev and included Anastas Mikoyan, Nikolai Bulganin, Vyacheslav Molotov, Lazar Kaganovich, Ivan Konev, and others. The negotiations were tense; both Polish and Soviet troops were put on alert, engaged in 'manoeuvres', and were used as thinly veiled threats. The Polish leadership {{made it clear that the}} face of communism had to become more nationalized; <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>could</b> the Soviet Union directly control the Polish people. Here, Khrushchev's speech worked against him. During Stalinism, the Soviet Union had placed Moscow-friendly Poles, or Russians themselves, in important political positions in Poland. After denouncing Stalinism so vehemently in his speech, Khrushchev could not regress to the Stalinist position by forcing more Russians into the Polish leadership. The Poles, in recognizing the cries of the public, needed to keep the Soviets from direct control but could not raise their demands to a point that endangered their relationships in the bloc. Gomułka demanded increased autonomy and permission to carry out some reforms but also reassured the Soviets that the reforms were internal matters and that Poland had no intention of abandoning communism or its treaties with the Soviet Union. The Soviets were also pressured by the Chinese to accommodate the Polish demands and were increasingly distracted by the events in Hungary. Eventually, when Khrushchev was reassured that Gomułka would not alter the basic foundations of Polish communism, he withdrew the invasion threat and agreed to compromise, and Gomułka was confirmed in his new position.|$|E

When General Phoumi Nosavan was forced into exile in February 1965, he <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>could</b> use his influence to shield the subordinates in his faction. Brigadier General Thao Ma, commander of the Royal Lao Air Force (RLAF), was one of them.|$|E
25|$|The Fourth International {{suffered}} {{repression and}} disruption through the Second World War. Isolated from each other, and faced with political developments quite unlike those anticipated by Trotsky, some Trotskyist organizations {{decided that the}} Soviet Union <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>could</b> be called a degenerated workers state and withdrew from the Fourth International. After 1945 Trotskyism was smashed as a mass movement in Vietnam and marginalised {{in a number of}} other countries.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} that Foster sent {{organizers}} into that area several months later, however, the influenza epidemic had led the authorities to bar all public meetings; {{the announcement of the}} armistice soon led to widespread layoffs in the mills. The union <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>could</b> rely on a tight labor market or a federal government interested in labor peace. The union faced other problems: the rivalries spurred by the constituent unions' self-interest and the omnipresent power of the industry, which had turned the Valley into a large version of a company town.|$|E

25|$|But in 1935, Pathé went bankrupt. In {{order to}} finance the company's {{continued}} expansion, Pathé's board of directors (which still included Charles Pathé) voted in 1930 to issue shares worth 105 million francs. But with the depression deepening, only 50 percent of the shares were purchased. One of the investor banks collapsed due to financial difficulties unrelated to Pathé's problems, and Pathé was forced {{to follow through with}} the purchase of several movie theater chains it <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>could</b> afford to buy. Although the company continued to make a profit (as noted above) for a time, it soon began to lose more money than it could bring it.|$|E
25|$|The Minnie A. Caine was a four-masted wooden {{schooner}} {{built by}} Seattle shipbuilder the Moran Brothers in 1900. One of the schooner's initial short-term co-owners, Elmer Caine, named her {{after his wife}} Minnie. From 1900 to 1926, the schooner was operated out of San Francisco by Charles Nelson Co., {{one of the largest}} transporter of lumber in United States at the time. The schooner transported lumber across the Pacific Ocean from the Pacific Northwest to ports of Australia and Americas, but after 1920 her scope of operations became limited to West Coast lumber trade. By 1926, the company <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>could</b> run a sailing ship with profit, and the Minnie A. Caine was moored in boneyard in California.|$|E
25|$|The {{changing}} {{economy in}} the Soviet Union led to {{the conclusion of a}} trade treaty between the USSR and the United States, signed by presidents Gorbachev and Bush on June 1, 1990. In this treaty, the U.S. imposed a number of measures in the field of intellectual property in exchange for granting the USSR most-favoured-nation status. The treaty obliged the USSR to accede to the Berne Convention and to implement in its law a neighbouring rights scheme similar to what the Rome Convention laid down. The USSR agreed in the treaty to take substantive steps to amend its legislation in that sense by 1991. The treaty was ratified by the U.S. on December 23, 1991. The Soviet side <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>could</b> do so, but the Russian Federation did so on June 12, 1992.|$|E

25|$|Deke Slayton was the Director of Flight Crew Operations and {{effectively}} chose the crews for the flights. He {{did not intend}} to give astronauts two lunar landing commands but, according to historian Michael Cassutt, as late as the summer of 1969when 10 landings were still scheduledSlayton planned to give Lunar Module Pilots Fred Haise, Edgar Mitchell, and James Irwin the opportunity to walk again on the Moon as Commanders. During the early Apollo missions he used a rotation system of assigning a crew as backup and then, three missions later, as the prime crew; however, by the later Apollo flights, this system was used less frequently as astronauts left the program, Slayton wanted to give rookies a chance, and astronauts did not want to take backup positions that <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>could</b> lead to prime-crew spots.|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{economic}} calamity facing {{the nation and}} his dim hopes for re-election, Hoover faced little opposition for re-nomination at the 1932 Republican National Convention. Some Republicans talked of nominating Coolidge, former Vice President Charles Dawes, or Senator Hiram Johnson, but all passed on the opportunity to challenge Hoover. Curtis was re-nominated as Hoover's running mate. Franklin D. Roosevelt won the presidential nomination on the third ballot of the 1932 Democratic National Convention, defeating the 1928 Democratic nominee, Al Smith. Speaker of the House John Nance Garner was nominated as Roosevelt's running mate. By 1932, the radio was in 12 million homes, changing the nature of presidential campaigns. <b>No</b> <b>longer</b> <b>could</b> presidents change {{the content of their}} speeches for each audience; anyone with a radio could listen to every major speech.|$|E

The Phoenix beat Perth by penalty shootout (4–2) after it was 1–1 after 120 minutes (90 plus 30 extra time). Phoenix then hosted a home game against Newcastle Jets on 7 March after the Jets won its away game against Gold Coast United by way of penalty shootout (5–6). The Phoenix won in extra time 3–1 after it was 1–1 after 90 minutes.|$|E

500|$|Medieval Mediterranean naval warfare was {{therefore}} essentially coastal and amphibious in nature, {{carried out to}} seize coastal territory or islands, and not to exercise [...] "sea control" [...] as it is understood today. Furthermore, following the abandonment of the ram, the only truly [...] "ship-killing" [...] weapon available prior to the advent of gunpowder and explosive shells, sea combat became, {{in the words of}} John Pryor, [...] "more unpredictable. <b>No</b> <b>longer</b> <b>could</b> any power hope to have such an advantage in weaponry or the skill of crews that success could be expected." [...] It is no surprise therefore that the Byzantine and Arab manuals emphasize cautious tactics, with the priority given to the preservation of one's own fleet, and the acquisition of accurate intelligence, often through the use of spies posing as merchants. Emphasis was placed on achieving tactical surprise and, conversely, on avoiding being caught unprepared by the enemy. Ideally, battle was to be given only when assured of superiority by virtue of numbers or tactical disposition. Importance is also laid on matching one's forces and tactics to the prospective enemy: Leo VI, for instance, contrasted (Tactica, XIX.74–77) the Arabs with their heavy and slow ships (koumbaria), to the small and fast craft (akatia, chiefly monoxyla), of the Slavs and Rus'.|$|E

2500|$|After {{the arrival}} of the 1703 reinforcements, the Danish corps {{consisted}} of a cavalry regiment, a dragoon regiment, and four infantry regiments. It remained in Linz until the spring of 1704 when it marched to Hungary where it took part in the suppression of Rákóczys's Hungarian insurgency. The winter of 1704-1705 was spent living off the land in hostile Bavaria, where its maintenance did not burden the Habsburg treasury. In 1705, the corps returned to Hungary and renewed heavy fighting. The following year, the corps combat value fell significantly when the Habsburg emperor <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>could</b> afford to pay it. The king of Denmark therefore began diplomatic overturns to regain his troops. After long and tedious negotiations this was achieved, {{but it was not until}} the summer of 1709 that the Danish corps could leave Hungary. The Danish king, who planned to resume the war with Sweden, provided the corps with ample enlistment bounties, so that on their return to Denmark its full complement of soldiers were almost restored. The majority of the soldiery were now Germans and Hungarians.|$|E
2500|$|In 2003, the Public Road Administration took {{initiative}} for the Askøy Bridge {{to use the}} Autopass electronic toll collection system. The national standard was planned implemented simultaneously in the Bergen Toll Ring, the Askøy Bridge and the Osterøy Bridge. This eliminated {{the need for a}} manned booth and allowed cars to pass without stopping. The cost-saving would allow the toll collection period to end one month early. Autopass would allow for an annual saving of NOK6 million. [...] The proposal resulted in opposition from a group of locals, who collected 9,000 signatures in a petition to keep the manual collection system. The old system allowed people to purchase discounted tickets for NOK60. While people who signed an agreement with Askøybrua AS were granted the same discount, this would not be true for people who had an agreement with other toll companies, and did not sign an additional agreement to receive the discount. The petitioners were concerned that they <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>could</b> purchase tickets for friends visiting them from the mainland, as these would only receive the discount if they signed an agreement with Askøybrua. On 22 December, the toll company voted to introduce a dual system which would both allow Autopass and the old tickets, although it would be a more costly system to operate. On 23 January 2004, the Public Roads Administration announced that they would allow all cars with an Autopass chip to receive the 30 percent discount, even if they had an agreement with a different toll company. Autopass was introduced on 2 February.|$|E
