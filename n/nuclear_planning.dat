25|$|The {{military}} {{continued to}} push for development in the nuclear sector. It was the government's ambition to acquire all phases of the nuclear cycle through international cooperation. With this in mind, in 1974 the Brazilian Company for Nuclear Technology (Companhia Brasileira de Tecnologia Nuclear – CBTN) was enhanced and became the Brazilian Nuclear Enterprises (Nuclebrás). Headed by Paulo Nogueira Batista, a career diplomat, Nuclebrás was charged with implementing the nuclear program by promoting the creation of indigenous companies to build parts and offer services for the nuclear plants on the pipeline. While Nuclebrás dealt with implementation and funding, CNEN retained the responsibilities of <b>nuclear</b> <b>planning,</b> regulation and inspection. Additionally, CNEN continued to be the Ministry of Mines and Energy’s advisory body for domestic and international nuclear policy.|$|E
25|$|As {{had been}} feared, the President of France, Charles de Gaulle, vetoed Britain's {{application}} for admission to the EEC on 14 January 1963, citing the Nassau Agreement {{as one of the}} main reasons. He argued that Britain's dependence on United States through the purchase of Polaris rendered it unfit {{to be a member of}} the EEC. The US policy of attempting to force Britain into their Multilateral Force proved to be a failure in light of this decision, and there was a lack of enthusiasm for it from the NATO allies, particularly Britain. By 1965, the Multilateral Force began fading away. The NATO <b>Nuclear</b> <b>Planning</b> Group gave NATO members a voice in the planning process without full access to nuclear weapons.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} {{a model of}} performance indicators applied to nuclear emergency exercises {{for the assessment of}} a <b>nuclear</b> energy <b>plan.</b> The model was designed from the relationship between the actions forecasted in a <b>nuclear</b> emergency <b>plan</b> and the objectives challenged in emergency exercises. The <b>nuclear</b> emergency <b>plan</b> comprises a protocol that addresses structures, actions and procedures aimed at controlling and minimizing the effects of a nuclear emergency. The emergency plan is the last level of defense in depth used to ensure nuclear safety. Thus, the emergency plan must be efficient in preparing and organizing current means in order to ensure and assure an adequate protection of the population in the case of accidents in nuclear power plants. The model of performance indicators developed is based on the functional dependence observed in several different <b>nuclear</b> emergency <b>plans,</b> which facilitates the analysis of the state of preparedness of nuclear emergency response organizations. The model allows comparing different stages of preparedness of a <b>nuclear</b> emergency <b>plan</b> as well as <b>nuclear</b> emergency <b>plans</b> for different facilities...|$|R
