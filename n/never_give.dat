5|$|After Mussolini {{had made}} clear in 1922 {{that he would}} <b>never</b> <b>give</b> up the region of South Tyrol from being in Italy, Hitler adopted this position. Hitler in Mein Kampf had {{declared}} that concerns over the rights of Germans in South Tyrol under Italian sovereignty was a non-issue considering the advantages that would be gained from a German-Italian alliance with Mussolini's Fascist regime. In Mein Kampf Hitler also made {{clear that he was}} opposed to having a war with Italy for the sake of obtaining South Tyrol. This position by Hitler of abandoning German land claims to South Tyrol produced aggravation among some NSDAP members who up to the late 1920s found it difficult to accept the position.|$|E

25|$|Media and terrorism: {{later the}} same month Panarin {{proposed}} imposition of severe limits on the media on showing violence acts and during terrorist acts, when {{the media and the}} authorities must cooperate. He said that the media must <b>never</b> <b>give</b> the terrorists a tribune or help them acquire operational information, and double media standards are intolerable. He proposed a contract on anti-terror between the authorities and the media with a behavioural codex of the journalists {{and the creation of a}} special state body for informational counteraction organisation and coordination of the information activities of all state structures operating to counter terror. In his view, the media are to a certain degree a catalyst for terrorism because terrorist acts of such a volume would be impossible without them; also, the press induces panic in the organs of state authority and affects the public negatively.|$|E
25|$|Late on 21 February, ISIL forces {{launched}} a counterattack, {{in an attempt}} to recapture the city, re-entering Al-Shaddadi's western and southern suburbs, and recapturing the town of Sabaa.

Early on 22 February, ISIL {{launched a}}nother counterattack on Al-Shaddadi's southern outskirts, resulting in additional clashes, before they were repelled by the SDF once again. Early on 23 February, SDF forces recaptured the Jabisah oil field, following an earlier ISIL counterattack. Clashes also erupted to the south of Al-Shaddadi.|$|E
