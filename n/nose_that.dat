5|$|Of the subspecies, the black-faced impala is {{significantly}} larger and {{darker than the}} common impala; melanism {{is responsible for the}} black colouration. Distinctive of the black-faced impala is a dark stripe, {{on either side of the}} <b>nose,</b> <b>that</b> runs upward to the eyes and thins as it reaches the forehead. Other differences include the larger black tip on the ear, and a bushier and nearly 30% longer tail in the black-faced impala.|$|E
5|$|The prototypes {{performed}} well; however, several design failings led to {{the loss}} of WB771 on 14 July 1954, when the tailplane detached whilst making a low-level pass over the runway at Cranfield, causing the aircraft to crash with the loss of the crew. Attached to the fin using three bolts, the tailplane was subject to considerably more stress than had been anticipated, and the three bolts failed due to metal fatigue. Additionally, the prototypes were considerably tail heavy {{due to the lack of}} equipment in the nose; this was remedied by large ballast weights being fitted upon the prototypes. Production Victors had a lengthened <b>nose</b> <b>that</b> also served to move the crew escape door further from the engine intakes. The fin was shortened to eliminate the potential for flutter while the tailplane attachment was changed to a stronger four-bolt fixing.|$|E

25|$|The {{first six}} {{aircraft}} produced were designated Series 1, {{indicating that they}} were prototype aircraft. The initial production run consisted of Series 100 aircraft, serial numbers seven to 115 inclusive. In 1968, Series 200 production began with serial number 116. Changes made {{at the beginning of}} Series 200 production included improving the STOL performance, adding a longer <b>nose</b> <b>that</b> was equipped with a larger baggage compartment (except for aircraft fitted with floats), and fitting a larger door to the rear baggage compartment. All Series 1, 100, and 200 aircraft and their variants (110, 210) were fitted with the 550-shaft-horsepower PT6A-20 engines.|$|E
25|$|Testing of {{the first}} B-25 Mitchell armed with 75mm cannon was {{completed}} by the Air Proving Ground Command on 26 March 1943. It had first flown 2 October 1942. B-25C-1, 41-13296, c/n 82-5931, the final airframe of the -1 production block, was modified as the XB-25G prototype, fitted with a 75-mm M4 cannon which was 9 feet 6 inches long. The transparent nose was replaced with a shortened armored solid <b>nose</b> <b>that</b> reduced overall length to 51 feet. The cannon was mounted in a cradle in the lower left-hand side of the nose, which extended underneath the pilot's seat with a spring mechanism forming part of the gun mount {{to take up the}} 21-inch recoil. The cannon-armed Mitchell would enjoy success in the Southwest Pacific theatre.|$|E

25|$|Controversial {{results from}} one study {{suggested}} that traumatic experiences might produce an epigenetic signal that {{is capable of}} being passed to future generations. Mice were trained, using foot shocks, to fear a cherry blossom odor. The investigators reported that the mouse offspring had an increased aversion to this specific odor. They suggested epigenetic changes that increase gene expression, rather than in DNA itself, in a gene, M71, that governs the functioning of an odor receptor in the <b>nose</b> <b>that</b> responds specifically to this cherry blossom smell. There were physical changes that correlated with olfactory (smell) function in the brains of the trained mice and their descendants. Several criticisms were reported, including the study's low statistical power as evidence of some irregularity such as bias in reporting results. Due to limits of sample size, there is a probability that an effect will not be demonstrated to within statistical significance even if it exists. The criticism suggested that the probability that all the experiments reported would show positive results if an identical protocol was followed, assuming the claimed effects exist, is merely 0.4%. The authors also did not indicate which mice were siblings, and treated all of the mice as statistically independent. The original researchers pointed out negative results in the paper's appendix that the criticism omitted in its calculations, and undertook to track which mice were siblings in the future.|$|E
25|$|The scene {{featuring}} Diesel smashing his car {{through the}} nose of a Soviet-era cargo aircraft during takeoff was conceived by Lin while producing Fast & Furious in 2009. At the time, the stunt was too expensive to film and did not fit into that film's story, but Lin commissioned digital pre-visualization artists to develop a mock-up of the idea. He attempted to revive the concept for Fast Five but the technology available proved insufficient and it still did not organically fit into the story. Filming the climactic scene practically was considered unfeasible as it involved throwing tanks {{through the air and}} having cars race alongside the moving aeroplane at 100 miles per hour. Lin opted to build various plane sets instead: a thirty foot high, seventy five foot long, fifty foot wide replica of the fuselage complete with wheels; the tail of the plane with a ramp allowing the cars to drive in and out; and a full scale build of the central fuselage, with wings, engines and the <b>nose,</b> <b>that</b> could be set on fire. For Dom's car to explode through the plane's nose, a Dodge Charger was placed on a pneumatic cannon mounted inside a ramp which was then towed by a 4x4 truck, all concealed behind the plane's nose replica. This was then clad in material soaked in flammable materials. The cannon fired the Charger {{through the nose}} as the material is ignited for the practical effect. The stunt driver had a burning 40-ton plane rig chasing them down the runway afterwards. The scene involved more than 200 crew members, and over 350 visual effects (VFX) artists at VFX studio Double Negative to complete. A typical shot of the craft's destruction could take over 100 man days to complete. The VFX team combined the filmed explosions and smoke with digital augmentations to place the plane into the scene.|$|E
500|$|All {{characters}} in Phineas and Ferb were drawn in a design borrowed from Tex Avery's style, with geometric shapes being included in their structure; Phineas {{in particular is}} that of a triangle. The triangle face has been stated in the series as being just his <b>nose</b> <b>that</b> covers the entire head. The goal while drawing characters was to make them simple enough to be drawn by child viewers and be recognized by silhouette. Phineas's eyes lie {{on the top of his}} head and are of oval shape. For his hair, three [...] "tufts" [...] are put in the back and front, while three freckles lie underneath. For the ear, a small 3 is used to represent the ear lobe.

500|$|Dustin Hoffman {{says that}} the play {{was the first one}} he ever read and predated his {{interest}} in becoming an [...] actor. He noted that the play resonated with him because his father was a travelling salesman and he had an older brother. Hoffman eventually played the role in a high-school production. In 1965, Hoffman served as the assistant director in an off-Broadway revival of A View from the Bridge at the Sheridan Square Playhouse with a cast that included Robert Duvall and Jon Voight. The show's director Ulu Grosbard suggested to Miller that Hoffman had the potential to make a great Willy Loman. Miller was unimpressed and later wrote that [...] "My estimate of Grosbard all but collapsed as, observing Dustin Hoffman's awkwardness and his big <b>nose</b> <b>that</b> never seemed to get unstuffy, I wondered how the poor fellow imagined himself a candidate for any kind of acting career." ...|$|E
500|$|Before {{the program}} was canceled, two {{variants}} had been studied by Ilyushin. The first was an artillery-spotting version known as the Il-40K. This model added a third crewman in a redesigned forward fuselage. The air intakes were reverted to their original position as the guns {{had been placed in}} the small wing bomb bays and there was no danger of the engines ingesting blast gasses from the guns. The spotter-navigator was given an extensively glazed position {{at the tip of the}} <b>nose</b> <b>that</b> was well-protected with armor and bulletproof glass. [...] The first fuselage was nearing completion when the order came to cancel the entire program. The second variant was a torpedo-carrying version called the Il-40T which was based on the fuselage of the Il-40K, but the navigator-bombardier's position had optically flat glass panels to facilitate aiming. Not much effort was devoted to this model and it was canceled at an early stage.|$|E
500|$|The {{game was}} {{directed}} by Satoru Okada (credited as S. Okada), and produced by {{the general manager of}} the R division, Gunpei Yokoi (credited as G. Yokoi). Hirokazu Tanaka (credited as Hip Tanaka) composed the music for Myth of Light: The Mirror of Palutena. Yoshio Sakamoto (credited as Shikao.S) joined the team as soon as he had returned from his vacation after the completion of Metroid. He streamlined the development process, and made many decisions that affected the game design of Myth of Light: The Mirror of Palutena. Several out-of-place elements were included in the game, such as credit cards, a wizard turning player character Pit into an eggplant, and a large, moving <b>nose</b> <b>that</b> was meant to resemble composer Tanaka. Sakamoto attributed this unrestrained humor to the former personnel of the R division, which he referred to as [...] "strange". Osawa said that he had originally tried to make Myth of Light: The Mirror of Palutena completely serious, but opted for a more humorous approach after objections from the team.|$|E

500|$|During a 1900 {{challenge}} {{series against}} the Montreal Shamrocks Bain scored four goals in three games, but Winnipeg again lost the title. The Victorias challenged the Shamrocks again in 1901 in a best-of-three series. Winnipeg won the series in two games after Bain scored the clinching goal in overtime. It {{was the first time}} in Stanley Cup history that the winning goal was scored in extra time. Bain did so while playing with a broken <b>nose</b> <b>that</b> required him to wear a wooden face mask, earning the nickname [...] "the masked man" [...] as a result. When the Victorias defended their title in a {{series against the}} Toronto Wellingtons in January 1902, Bain did not play in the series. The team lost their next challenge, against the Montreal Hockey Club, in March of that year, which marked the end of Bain's hockey playing career.

500|$|The Lavochkin OKB {{was ordered}} to design a fighter using a single Junkers Jumo 004B axial-flow {{turbojet}} in February 1945. Much like their rivals at the Mikoyan-Gurevich OKB with their MiG-9, the OKB chose a [...] "pod-and-boom" [...] layout for their new fighter, based on advice from the Central Aerohydrodynamic Institute (TsAGI), although their design had a shoulder-mounted wing. The wings of the all-metal aircraft had fixed leading edges and slotted flaps. The cockpit was well forward, giving the pilot good visibility, and he was protected by an armored headrest. The windscreen of the teardrop-shaped canopy was also armored. Two [...] Nudelman-Suranov NS-23 autocannon were mounted on the lower side of the fuselage with 75 rounds per gun. The tricycle landing gear retracted into the fuselage which gave the 150 a very narrow track. The Soviet derivative of the Jumo engine, the RD-10, was rated at [...] and was mounted behind the cockpit. A steel heat shield protected {{the bottom of the}} rear fuselage from the engine's exhaust.
