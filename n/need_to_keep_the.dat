5|$|A {{memorial}} {{ceremony was}} held for the victims on July 31, 1944, at Port Chicago. Admiral Carleton H. Wright, Commander, 12th Naval District, spoke of the unfortunate deaths and the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> base operating {{during a time of}} war. He gave Navy and Marine Corps Medals for bravery to four officers and men who had successfully fought a fire in a rail car parked within a revetment near the pier. The remains of 44 of the victims were interred at Golden Gate National Cemetery.|$|E
5|$|Construction of {{the station}} was {{complicated}} by the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> line open: trains ferrying materials were unable to stay on-site for long, and frequently had to switch from one track to the other, necessitating trips to nearby Montpelier railway station, where the nearest crossover points were located. The station finally opened on 12 April 1897. The first train was the 7am service: 94 tickets were issued to Clifton Down, and an estimated 550 passengers bought tickets from the station the same day. Some local writers were sceptical, claiming {{that many of those}} first day passengers were not new passengers, but would previously have travelled from Montpelier or Clifton Down. Construction took nine months, and cost £2,000.|$|E
5|$|Nights: Journey of Dreams {{was first}} conceptualised in November 2005 {{after the release}} of Sonic Team's Shadow the Hedgehog. Game design was {{primarily}} prepared by Takashi Iizuka and took around six months to reach the development process. Iizuka wanted to ensure that the next Nights game would stay faithful to the original, and felt the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> game's concept fundamentally the same while incorporating a variety of new mechanics. Despite the cancellation of Air Nights, Iizuka stressed that he had always wanted to make a sequel and asserted that Sega's exit from hardware manufacturing had no effect on the delay. Iizuka felt that it was the appropriate time to release a Nights game—he felt that the industry was dominated by violence and was keen to release a more family-friendly title. The team realised that Nintendo's upcoming Wii was marketed as a family-orientated console, and factored in its online features and user-friendly design.|$|E

During the Monday night jam sessions, a young trumpeter named Chet Baker began sitting in with Mulligan.

Around that time, vibraphonist Red Norvo's trio began headlining at The Haig, thus leaving no <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> grand piano that had been brought in for Erroll Garner's stay at the club.|$|E
25|$|By {{taking part}} in the 1995 {{ceremony}} to commemorate the liberation of the Auschwitz concentration camp, the President of the ICRC, Cornelio Sommaruga, sought to show that the organization was fully aware of the gravity of The Holocaust and the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> memory of it alive, so as to prevent any repetition of it. He paid tribute to all those who had suffered or lost their lives during the war and publicly regretted the past mistakes and shortcomings of the Red Cross with regard to the victims of the concentration camps.|$|E
25|$|Several routes were {{considered}} for the Loenga–Alnabru Line. The <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> gradient at bay meant that the tracks were placed at a lower elevation than the Trunk Line, with the two not reaching the same height until Bryn Station. At {{the same time the}} company needed {{to stay away from the}} Alna River. Meanwhile, the Gjøvik Line was built with a branch, the Alna Line, which connected to Alnabru. Just northeast of the Trunk Line was placed in a culvert under the Trunk Line so it would meet up with the Alna Line. The Loenga–Alnabru Line was completed between Bryn and Alnabru in May 1904. with this work being carried out at the same time as the doubling of the Trunk Line. The section from Loenga to Bryn opened on 1 May 1907.|$|E

25|$|Therapsids {{and earlier}} mammaliaforms had their jaw joints very {{far back in}} the skull, partly because the ear was at the rear end of the jaw but also had {{to be close to}} the brain. This {{arrangement}} limited the size of the braincase, because it forced the jaw muscles to run round and over it. Hadrocodium's braincase and jaws were no longer bound to each other by the need to support the ear, and its jaw joint was further forward. In its descendants or those of animals with a similar arrangement, the brain case was free to expand without being constrained by the jaw and the jaw was free to change without being constrained by the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> ear near the brain — in other words it now became possible for mammaliaforms both to develop large brains and to adapt their jaws and teeth in ways that were purely specialized for eating.|$|E
25|$|Historians credit Britain with {{a highly}} {{successful}} record of mobilizing the home front for the war effort, in terms of mobilizing the greatest proportion of potential workers, maximizing output, assigning the right skills to the right task, and maintaining the morale and spirit of the people. Much of this success {{was due to the}} systematic planned mobilization of women, as workers, soldiers and housewives, enforced after December 1941 by conscription. The women supported the war effort, and made the rationing of consumer goods a success. In some ways, the government over planned, evacuating too many children in the first days of the war, closing cinemas as frivolous then reopening them when the need for cheap entertainment was clear, sacrificing cats and dogs to save a little space on shipping pet food, only to discover an urgent <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> rats and mice under control. In the balance between compulsion and voluntarism, the British relied successfully on voluntarism. The success of the government in providing new services, such as hospitals, and school lunches, as well as the equalitarian spirit of the People's war, contributed to widespread support for an enlarged welfare state. Munitions production rose dramatically, and the quality remained high. Food production was emphasized, in large part to open up shipping for munitions. Farmers increased the number of acres under cultivation from 12,000,000 to 18,000,000, and the farm labor force was expanded by a fifth, thanks especially to the Women's Land Army.|$|E

500|$|Following {{his rise}} to the throne, al-Mu'tadid {{continued}} his father's policies, and restored caliphal authority in the Jazira, northern Syria, and parts of western Iran. He established an effective administration, but the incessant campaigning, and the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> soldiery satisfied, meant {{that it was almost}} totally geared towards providing the funds necessary to maintain the army. Nevertheless, al-Mu'tadid managed to accumulate a considerable surplus in his ten-year reign. At the same time the bureaucracy grew in power, it also saw a growth in factionalism, with two rival [...] "clans" [...] emerging, the Banu'l-Furat and the Banu'l-Jarrah. The two groups represented primarily different factions in a struggle for office and power, but there are indications of [...] "ideological" [...] differences as well: many of the Banu'l-Jarrah families hailed from converted Nestorian families and employed Christians in the bureaucracy, in addition to maintaining closer ties with the military, while the Banu'l-Furat tried to impose firm civilian control of the army and (not quite openly) favoured Shi'ism.|$|E
500|$|The delay enabled Spain to take {{advantage}} of experience gained by Britain with the world's first commissioned all-big-gun battleship, , and by the United States with its own new battleship, [...] The Spanish Navy was principally concerned with defending its three main naval bases: Ferrol, Cádiz, and Cartagena. Of secondary importance was the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>the</b> new battleship design tightly constrained due to the frail Spanish economy and industrial sector. A third constraint was the need to build ships small enough to fit in existing dockyard facilities, since there were insufficient funds to both build larger battleships and to enlarge the navy's dockyards. As a result, the design requirements called for relatively heavy offensive power with minimal range and armor protection. The Navy began discussing the design requirements with Armstrong Whitworth and Vickers in 1907 well before the law was actually passed. On 5 September 1907, Vickers provided a proposed design for a 15,000-ton battleship armed with eight 12-inch guns. This design was the basis for the requirements for the design competition, which was issued on 21 April 1908.|$|E

[...] He was also unsure whether Liverpool would be able to challenge for the Premier League: [...] "It's difficult to assess Liverpool at the moment.
