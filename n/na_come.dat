40|$|Project (M. S. W., Social Work) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2015. This {{research}} study attempts to identify cultural attitudes that impact the help-seeking behavior of Filipinos in the U. S. with a substance use disorder (SUD). Data was collected from self-identified service providers, family members, and former users who all {{reported to be}} knowledgeable about this issue. The findings show that the cultural attitude ???bahala <b>na???</b> (<b>come</b> what may) likely removes a user???s sense of responsibility to seek help, and likely hinders the ability of support persons to provide the help that a user may need. These findings indicate that repurposing ???bahala na??? as a cultural concept may be a critical step to facilitate the help-seeking behavior of Filipino substance users. The data also implicates a potential role for social work in developing a culture-specific and multi-systemic approach to promote such repurposing in the Filipino community. Social Wor...|$|E

The change in name to Avogadro constant (<b>NA)</b> <b>came</b> with the introduction of the mole as a base unit in the International System of Units (SI) in 1971, which regarded amount of substance as an independent dimension of measurement. With this recognition, the Avogadro constant was no longer a pure number, but had a unit of measurement, the reciprocal mole (mol−1).|$|R

They both were yelling out that the Rakhine Buddhist couple and their children were trying to rob their gold shop. As their Muslim relatives from other Rohingya gold shops nearby joined the attack the bystanders started shouting at them to stop such and then called the police.|$|R

40|$|The recent {{discovery}} of a tenuous sodium (Na) atmosphere on the Moon and Mercury has renewed interest in studying the lunar atmosphere since the physics involved for the two bodies {{is thought to be}} of similar nature. <b>Na</b> <b>came</b> as a surprise because it had been missed by in situ UV measurements made during the Apollo program. The new lunar observations involve the visible D 1 (5896) and D 2 (5890) wavelengths which are highly efficient at scattering sunlight. Although its lunar source and morphology is still not completely understood, Na is present as a collisionless exosphere - apparently {{in the form of a}} cometary-type coma with a tail that can extend hundreds of lunar radii during Leonid showers. The global shape of the atmosphere, in particular for the shaded antisolar side, has been modelled by Smyth. Since planetary atmospheres can be used as cosmic-ray (CR) spectrometers by means of their fluorescence excited by CR-induced air shower particles, the subject of the Moon s atmosphere as a CR detector will be discussed here...|$|R
