5|$|All of the {{alkali metals}} except lithium and caesium {{have at least}} one {{naturally}} occurring radioisotope: sodium-22 and sodium-24 are trace radioisotopes produced cosmogenically, potassium-40 and rubidium-87 have very long half-lives and thus occur naturally, and all isotopes of francium are radioactive. Caesium was also thought to be radioactive in the early 20th century, although it has no naturally occurring radioisotopes. (Francium had not been discovered yet at that time.) The <b>natural</b> long-lived radioisotope of potassium, potassium-40, makes up about 0.012% of <b>natural</b> potassium, and thus <b>natural</b> potassium is weakly radioactive. This <b>natural</b> radioactivity became a basis for a mistaken claim of the discovery for element 87 (the next alkali metal after caesium) in 1925. <b>Natural</b> rubidium is similarly slightly radioactive, with 27.83% being the long-lived radioisotope rubidium-87.|$|E
5|$|Among all of these, {{the only}} {{isotopes}} {{that occur in}} sufficient quantities in nature to be detected in anything more than traces and have a measurable contribution to the atomic weights of the actinides are the primordial 232Th, 235U, and 238U, and three long-lived decay products of <b>natural</b> uranium, 230Th, 231Pa, and 234U. <b>Natural</b> thorium consists of 0.02(2)% 230Th and 99.98(2)% 232Th; <b>natural</b> protactinium consists of 100% 231Pa; and <b>natural</b> uranium consists of 0.0054(5)% 234U, 0.7204(6)% 235U, and 99.2742(10)% 238U.|$|E
5|$|Another {{factor in}} Wallace's {{thinking}} was his belief that, {{because of the}} action of <b>natural</b> selection, organisms were {{in a state of}} balance with their environment, and that everything in nature, even disease-causing organisms, served a useful purpose in the <b>natural</b> order of things; he feared vaccination might upset that <b>natural</b> balance with unfortunate results.
