Both RS-232, via the 8 port CXY08 Q-Bus communication option card, and EIA-423-A, via the 16 port CXA16 communication option card and EIA-422 16 port CXB16 communication option card could be mixed together in any combination {{from two to}} eight cards in one server. The DECserver 510 and 550 would also support CXM04 IBM 3270 Terminal option cards, but on VMS only. The DECserver 500 series server provided a convenient method to connect logically up to 128 Digital asynchronous terminals {{to one or more}} service nodes (hosts) on an Ethernet. The DECserver 500 series server also allowed for ULTRIX host-initiated connections to asynchronous printers. The DECserver 500 series server implemented the LAT protocol for communication with service nodes that implemented this protocol on the same Ethernet. The 500 series differed from other DECservers in that the configuration was not stored in <b>nonvolatile</b> <b>storage</b> locally on the server itself, but rather downline loaded from a file on a MOP host. Configuration changes which needed to remain permanently had to be changed locally on the DECserver and also updated on the MOP host using the OpenVMS Terminal Server Configurator utility (SYS$COMMON:DECSERVERDS5CFG on VMS or /usr/lib/dnet/tsc on Ultrix) so that it would return the next reboot. The 500 and 550 models are based on the PDP-11/53 chipset with 512kb or 1.5mb of on-board ram and can be reverted to a full PDP-11/53 system with a PROM swap and console port re-wire.|$|E
