The project was abandoned in June 1948. The final prototype was adapted for use in the OKB-1 140 programme. The other principal project of Baade's team of involuntary expatriates was the OKB-1 150, a jet bomber jet bomber on which serious work began in 1948. The design incorporated innovative ideas on materials and design. As with the earlier project, progress was hampered by the inconsistent <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> from the Soviets when it came to obtaining materials and permitting the German expatriates the freedom necessary to develop and test the aircraft effectively. By 1951 the OKB-1 150 had been developed into a heavy bomber with a range of approximately 1,500 km and a bomb capacity of around 600 kg, but in 1952 this project, too, was abandoned as resources were again reprioritized.|$|E

The paper begins by considering the <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> in relation to housing and suggests a typology to provide a framework for discussing the relationship between the accommodation and care perspectives involved in supporting a person to live independently in the community. There follows a consideration of the <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> in housing which examines the different approaches to the provision of support and housing in Europe. This section examines the development and form of provision of support in housing in different welfare systems.

The role is examined in greater detail by examination of the use of supported housing for people with a mental illness. Supported Housing Independent Living European Union Welfare Systems,...|$|E

40|$|The role of {{education}} districts {{is central to}} the success of schools as they are mandated to work collaboratively with school principals, giving guidance and professional support. In this paper, we investigate school principals’ perspectives regarding the <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> provided by their districts to effectively conduct their work and how that support can be enhanced. Using semi-structured interviews, 18 principals from five districts were interviewed. Findings show school principals’ dissatisfaction with their districts’ low levels of support caused by the lack of district support on provision of resources, lack of consultation in key decisions involving their schools; district offcials’ lack of visibility in schools and responsiveness to change. We conclude that the success of principals and their schools partly depends on the <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> received from their districts, and argue for improved collaboration between schools and the districts...|$|E

The {{focus of}} this {{research}} study is on learning support to learners in rural schools as experienced by learning support professionals and teachers {{in order to identify}} best-practices and the obstacles experienced in this regard. It was envisaged that continuous exploration of current practices could assist in identifying ways to <b>support</b> the development <b>of</b> inclusive education. The research questions to address this aspect were: What is the <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> learning <b>support</b> in rural schools as experienced by teachers? and What is the <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> learning <b>support</b> in rural schools as experienced by learning support professionals? The aim of this study was therefore to explore and describe the <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> learning <b>support</b> in rural schools, in order to make some recommendations to learning support professionals, teachers and education authorities to ensure the effective development and implementation <b>of</b> learning <b>support</b> strategies in rural schools.

40|$|Objectives: To {{explore the}} {{influence}} <b>of</b> social <b>support</b> on parental physical activity (PA). Methods: Forty parents (21 mothers, 19 fathers) participated in semistructured {{individual or group}} interviews. Data were analyzed using thematic content analysis. [...] Results: Instrumental (eg, providing child care, taking over chores), emotional (eg, encouragement, companionship), and informational support (eg, ideas and advice) as well as reciprocal support (eg, giving as well as receiving support) and autonomy support (eg, respecting one’s choices) are important for parents’ PA behavior. However, having support for being active is not straightforward in that many parents discussed issues that inhibited the facilitative <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> social <b>support</b> for PA performance (eg, guilt in getting help). Conclusions: Results highlight the complex <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> social <b>support</b> in facilitating parental PA...|$|R
