25|$|For {{profitable}} hemp farming, particularly deep, humus-rich, nutrient-rich {{soil with}} controlled water flow is preferable. Waterlogged acidic, compressed or extremely light (sandy) soils primarily affect the early development of plants. Steep and high altitudes {{of more than}} 400m above sea level are best avoided. Hemp is relatively insensitive to cold temperatures and can withstand frost down to −5°C. Seeds can germinate down to 1–3°C. Hemp <b>needs</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> heat, so earlier varieties come to maturation. The water requirement is 300–500l/kg dry matter. Up to 3 feet growing roots into the soil can also use water supplies from deeper soil layers. Worth noting is that the water requirement of hemp is at least 14 times {{lower than that of}} cotton, which takes between 7,000 and 29,000l/kg, according to WWF.|$|E
2500|$|An early {{script was}} leaked onto the {{internet}} in March 2008, leading to a review by Ain't It Cool News which called it [...] " [...] just a good adaptation of a difficult book [...] a genre-defining piece of work that could well see us all arguing {{about whether or not}} a zombie movie qualifies as 'Best Picture' material". The review also noted the film appears stylistically similar to Children of Men, following Gerry Lane as he travels the post-war world and interviews survivors of the zombie war who are [...] "starting to wonder if survival is a victory of any kind." [...] Straczynski had hoped that the film would begin production by the start of 2009. In March 2009, Forster said that the script was still in development and he was not sure if World War Z would be his next film. Later in March, rumors surfaced that production offices were set up and the film was in early pre-production. In June 2009, Marc Forster told an interviewer that the film would be delayed, stating that the film's script still <b>needs</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> development and is [...] "still far from realization".|$|E

2500|$|Andreas Hackel, art {{director}} at Candygun Games described {{the inspiration for}} the game's visuals. [...] "I was inspired by games like Team Fortress 2 and classic B-movies of the 1950's", stated Hackel. When asked about the reason for choosing to set it in the 1950s, Hackel replied, [...] "not many games are set in this period and there are a whole slew of very typical and interesting design elements from this time period. Elements like the cars, milk bars, chrome, juke boxes, fashion and hairstyles are all instantly recognisable as coming from the 50's." [...] Hackel commented that Candygun wanted the characters to be [...] "people from the street", and not superheroes. Roger Joswig explained their choice of using Unreal Engine 3 instead of a proprietary technology. [...] "If you're looking to release your game on , Xbox 360 and PC as we were, developing your own engine is a lot more expensive, takes a long time if you start from scratch and <b>needs</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> QA support – so it wasn't really a feasible option for us as a small, start-up developer". He also noted that the engine is built to run on the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and Microsoft Windows natively and that the team was familiar with the Unreal Engine tools. The in-game music was provided by the band Vampire State Building. The narrator's voice and in-game sound effects were outsourced to Periscope Studios.|$|E

6000|$|But before I {{begin to}} {{describe}} Vissarion I shall throw a sop to you [...] as a chatelaine; that may give you patience {{to read the}} rest. The [...] Castle <b>needs</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> things to make it comfortable--as you would [...] consider it. In fact, it is absolutely destitute of everything of a [...] domestic nature. Uncle Roger had it vetted on the defence side, and [...] so far it could stand a siege.

I think Uncle Roger must have been [...] a collector, and gathered {{a lot of good things}} in all sorts of [...] places, stored them for years, and then sent them here. But as to [...] glass, china, delft, all sorts of crockery, linen, household [...] appliances and machinery, cooking utensils--except of the [...] simplest--there are none. I don't think Uncle Roger could have lived [...] here more than on a temporary picnic. So far as I only am concerned, [...] I am all right; a gridiron and a saucepan are all I want--and I can [...] use them myself. But, dear Aunt Janet, I don't want you to pig it. [...] I would like you to have everything you can imagine, and all of the [...] very best. Cost doesn't count now for us, thanks to Uncle Roger; and [...] so I want you to order all. I know you, dear--being a woman--won't [...] object to shopping. But it will have to be wholesale. This is an [...] enormous place, and will swallow up all you can buy--like a [...] quicksand. Do as you like about choosing, but get all the help you [...] can. Don't be afraid of getting too much. You can't, or of being [...] idle when you are here. I assure you that when you come there will [...] be so much to do and so many things to think of that you will want to [...] get away from it all. And, besides, Aunt Janet, I hope you won't be [...] too long. Indeed, I don't wish to be selfish, but your boy is [...] lonely, and wants you. And when you get here you will be an EMPRESS.
