The objective of this work was to characterize distributions of emissions and concentrations of a few important urban air toxics at high spatiotemporal resolution in order to assess exposure and inequality. Benzene, 1, 3 -butadiene, formaldehyde, and acetaldehyde were the focus pollutants, with oxides of nitrogen (<b>NOx)</b> <b>estimated</b> for comparisons. Primary pollutant emissions were estimated for the full spectrum of source types in the Tampa area using a hybrid approach that is most detailed for major roadways and includes hourly variations in vehicle speed. Resultant pollutant concentrations were calculated using the CALPUFF dispersion model, and combined with CMAQ model output to account for secondary formation of formaldehyde and acetaldehyde. Census demographic data were applied to estimate residential pollution exposures and inequality among population subgroups. Estimated concentrations of benzene, 1, 3 -butadiene, and NOx were generally higher in urban areas and lower in rural areas. Exposures to these pollutants were disproportionately high for subgroups characterized as black, Hispanic and low income (annual household income less than $ 20, 000). For formaldehyde and acetaldehyde, the patterns of concentration and exposure were largely reversed. Results suggest that disparities in exposure depend on pollutant type...|$|R

The MAPSS (Maternal Air Pollution in Southern Sweden) cohort consists of linked registry data for around 48, 000 pregnancies from an ultrasound database, birth registry and exposure data based on residential addresses. Measures of air pollution exposure were obtained through dispersion modelling with input data from an emissions database (NOx) with high resolution (100 – 500 m grids). Air pollution effects were assessed with linear regressions for the following endpoints; biparietal diameter, femur length, abdominal diameter and estimated fetal weight measured in late pregnancy and birth weight and head circumference measured at birth. We estimated negative effects for NOx; in the adjusted analyses the decrease of abdominal diameter and femur length were − 0. 10 (− 0. 17, − 0. 03) and − 0. 13 (− 0. 17, − 0. 01) mm, respectively, per 10 µg/m 3 increment of <b>NOx.</b> We also <b>estimated</b> an effect of NOx-exposures on birth weight by reducing birth weight by 9 g per 10 µg/m 3 increment of <b>NOx.</b> We <b>estimated</b> small but statistically significant effects of air pollution on late fetal and birth size and reduced fetal growth late in pregnancy in a geographic area with levels below current WHO air quality guidelines...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular {{disease is}} the leading cause of death in the United States. Short-term {{exposures}} to air pollution have been associated with acute increases in cardiovascular hospitalization and mortality. However, the causative chemical components and underlying pathophysiological mechanisms remain to be clarified. METHODS: We conducted a cohort panel study involving 97 elderly subjects living in the Los Angeles metropolitan area. Weekly, we measured microvascular function, represented by reactive hyperemia index (RHI), and airway and circulating biomarkers of oxidative stress and inflammation, including exhaled breath condensate malondialdehyde (EBC MDA), fractional exhaled nitric oxide, oxidized low-density lipoprotein, and plasma interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) over 12 weeks. Exposures included 7 -day personal nitrogen oxides (NOX), daily ambient pollutants, including particulate matter size < 0. 25 µm in aerodynamic diameter (PM 2. 5), ozone, carbon monoxide (CO), black carbon (BC), and NOx, five-day average PM measured in three size-fractions and characterized by chemical components including transition metals, PM oxidative potential, and electrophilic potential. CAlifornia LINE Source Dispersion Model, version 4 (CALINE 4) was used to estimate individual exposure to local traffic-generated NOx. Associations between clinical outcomes and pollutants were assessed using linear mixed effects regression models. Potential effect modification by demographic characteristics and CALINE 4 -modeled NOx was assessed by adding interaction terms to these models. RESULTS: RHI was inversely associated with daily ambient traffic-related air pollutants (BC, NOX, and CO), other mobile-source components/tracers (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, elemental carbon, and hopanes), PM oxidative potential, and transition metals, and was positively associated electrophilic potential. We found significant positive associations of airway oxidative stress (EBC MDA), and inflammation (IL- 6) with traffic-related air pollutants, ultrafine particles, and transition metals. The observed associations were generally stronger among subjects at higher local traffic-generated <b>NOx</b> (<b>estimated</b> by CALINE 4). Associations between systemic oxidative stress and inflammation biomarkers and air pollutants were mostly non-significant, expect for positive associations that observed for IL- 6 and traffic-related air pollutants at 1 -day averages. CONCLUSIONS: Short-term exposure to pollutants with high oxidative potential (traffic-related pollutants, ultrafine particles, and transition metals) was associated with impaired microvascular function and increased airway oxidative stress and inflammation in elderly adults. Chronic exposure to residential NOx may further strengthen the observed associations...|$|R
40|$|Surface ozone is a {{persistent}} problem in U. S. A. and Europe {{as well as}} developing countries. A key prerequisite to identifying effective approaches to meeting an ozone air quality standard is to {{understand the relationship between}} VOC and NOx, the significance of biogenic emissions, and the contribution of long-range transport. The Baltimore/Washington area is an EPA-designated severe ozone non-attainment area. In this study, the characteristics of ozone events over this area were investigated to develop a possible control strategy. Both observational and computational modeling approaches were employed, and it was divided into three parts. The first part was to investigate sources of VOC emissions in the Baltimore area using highly time resolved measurements, and to investigate possible relationships between each VOC source category and episodes of elevated ozone concentrations. The results showed that biogenic emissions contribute significantly to local ozone production in this area. The second part was emissions inventory evaluation, focused on VOC emissions inventory because VOC estimates are commonly assumed to be more uncertain than <b>NOx</b> <b>estimates.</b> The results indicated a possibility of overestimation of solvent VOC emissions. Photochemical simulations with reduction of solvent VOC emissions did not affect ozone prediction, but affected significantly secondary organic aerosol prediction. Lastly, photochemical ozone simulations were performed to find an effective control strategy for this area. The simulation results showed that long-range transport of ozone was responsible for 20 - 90 ppb of ozone concentration in the state of Maryland, Northern Virginia, and D. C. area, displaying a decreasing contribution as it approached to the Baltimore/Washington area. Local emissions contributed considerably to high ozone occurrences in this area. Moreover, the contribution of biogenic VOC emissions in this region was responsible for much of the local ozone production, which was a consistent result from the part one. Accordingly, the results indicated that NOx emissions reductions would probably mitigate high ozone occurrences in this area, and this was confirmed through several simulations with emissions reductions. However, our results suggested that control of only local NOx emissions might not be sufficient to comply with the 8 hr ozone standard because of the importance of long-range transported ozone...|$|R

40|$|The {{question}} of whether children's exposure to traffic-related air pollution (TRAP) contributes to their development of asthma is unresolved. We conducted a systematic review and performed meta-analyses to analyze the association between TRAP and asthma development in childhood. Data sources: We systematically reviewed epidemiological studies published until 8 September 2016 and available in the Embase, Ovid MEDLINE (R), and Transport databases. Study eligibility criteria, participants, and interventions: We included studies that examined the association between children's exposure to TRAP metrics and their risk of ‘asthma’ incidence or lifetime prevalence, from birth to age 18 years old. Study appraisal and synthesis methods: We extracted key characteristics of each included study using a predefined data items template and these were tabulated. We used the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme checklists to assess the validity of each included study. Where four or more independent risk estimates were available for a continuous pollutant exposure, we conducted overall and age-specific meta-analyses, and four sensitivity analyses for each summary meta-analytic exposure-outcome association. Results: Forty-one studies met our eligibility criteria. There was notable variability in asthma definitions, TRAP exposure assessment methods and confounder adjustment. The overall random-effects risk estimates (95 % CI) were 1. 08 (1. 03, 1. 14) per 0. 5 × 10 ¯⁵ m¯¹ black carbon (BC), 1. 05 (1. 02, 1. 07) per 4 μg/m³ nitrogen dioxide (NO²), 1. 48 (0. 89, 2. 45) per 30 μg/m³ nitrogen oxides (NOₓ), 1. 03 (1. 01, 1. 05) per 1 μg/m³ Particulate Matter < 2. 5 μm in diameter (PM 2. 5), and 1. 05 (1. 02, 1. 08) per 2 μg/m³ Particulate Matter < 10 μm in diameter (PM 10). Sensitivity analyses supported these findings. Across the main analysis and age-specific analysis, the least heterogeneity was seen for the BC estimates, some heterogeneity for the PM 2. 5 and PM 10 estimates and the most heterogeneity for the NO₂ and <b>NOₓ</b> <b>estimates.</b> Limitations, conclusions and implication of key findings: The overall risk estimates from the meta-analyses showed statistically significant associations for BC, NO₂, PM 2. 5, PM 10 exposures and risk of asthma development.

Anthropogenic NOx (NO and NO 2) emissions have a range of health and environmental impacts. Reliable measurements of NOx are used to inform a range of science and policy goals.

The overall objective of this research was to improve the NOₓ emission inventories by integrating observations from different platforms and regional air quality modeling. Specific objectives were: 1) Comparison of satellite NO₂ retrievals with simulated NO₂ by the regional air quality model. Comparison of simulated tropospheric gas concentrations simulated by the regional air quality model, with aircraft and ground-based observations; 3) Assessment of the uncertainties in comparing satellite NO₂ retrievals with <b>NOₓ</b> emissions <b>estimates</b> and model simulations; 4) Identification of biases in emission inventories by data assimilation of satellite NO₂ retrievals, and ground-based NO, NO₂ and O₃ observations with an iterative inverse method using the regional air quality model coupled with sensitivity calculations; 5) Improvement of our understanding of NOₓ emissions, and the interaction between regional and global air pollution by an integrated analysis of satellite NO₂ retrievals with the regional air quality model. Along with these objectives, a lightning NOₓ emission inventory was prepared for two months of summer 2004 to account for a significant upper level NOₓ source. Spatially-resolved weekly NO₂ variations from satellite retrievals were compared with <b>estimated</b> <b>NOₓ</b> emissions for different region types. Data assimilation of satellite NO₂ retrievals, and ground-based NO, NO₂ and O₃ observations were performed to evaluate the NOₓ emission inventory.

The two sites, Binbrook and Hastings, are located 60 km SSW and 140 km NE of Metropolitan Toronto, respectively. The analysis of 5 -min average concentrations in relation with local wind directions-suggests {{that a strong}} contrast exists between conditions of northerly clean air and polluted southwesterly flows at both locations.

It is revealed that at low NO(x) levels NO(x) is photochemically converted to HNO 3 by either wet or dry deposition; however, at high NO(x) levels formation of HNO 3 is inhibited due to the disappearance of tropospheric ozone and OH, and the NO(x) is removed by rainout of N 2 O 4 and N 2 O 5, surface deposition of NO and NO 2, and direct dissolution of NO and NO 2 in rainwater. The effects of NO(x) mixing ratios greater than 10 to the - 7 th on the ozone and climate are investigated...|$|R

We use a modeling approach for Antarctica in summer, calculating the actinic flux in snowpack, and <b>estimating</b> <b>NOX</b> production from nitrate photolysis. Assuming nitrate photolysis is about as efficient for ice as for aqueous solution, and that all nitrate in the ice is available for photolysis, we find good agreement with measured fluxes of NOX from the snow surface at Neumayer Station, Antarctica. We estimate fluxes for other sites, and confirm that they could significantly affect boundary layer chemistry, especially where an atmospheric surface temperature inversion is present. We find that there is considerably more NOX production in the upper snowpack than in the entire tropospheric column above it. Photolysis explains a proportion of the nitrate loss observed from snow at some sites, but other processes (sorption/desorption) are necessary to explain the magnitude and depth profiles observed. ...|$|R
40|$|Presentation {{summarizing}} the phase I {{study of the}} NASA N 3 -X turboelectric distributed propulsion power aircraft to the IMechE Disruptive Green Propulsion Technologies conference in London, UK November 16 th and 17 th, 2014. This presentation contains {{the results of a}} NASA internal study funded by the NASA Fixed Wing program to look at the application of turboelectric distributed propulsion to a long-range 300 seat aircraft. The reference aircraft is the Boeing 777 - 200 LR. The N 3 -X reduced energy consumption by 70 compared to the 777 - 200 LR, LTO NOx by 85 compared to the CAEP 6 limits, and noise by 32 - 64 EPNdB depending on engine placement compared to the stage 4 noise standards. This exceeded the N+ 3 metrics of reducing energy by 60, LTO NOx by 80, and noise by 52 EPNdB. Cruise <b>NOx</b> was not <b>estimated,</b> but likely meet the 80 reduction goal as well...|$|R
40|$|To meet current Diesel engine {{pollutant}} legislation, it {{is important}} to manage after-treatment devices. The paper describes the development of Neural Network based virtual sensors used to <b>estimate</b> <b>NOx</b> emissions at the exhaust of automotive Diesel engines. Suitable identification methodologies and experimental tests were developed with the aim of meeting the conflicting needs of feasible on-board implementation and satisfactory prediction accuracy. In addition, since the prediction of control-oriented models is typically affected by engine aging and production spread as well as components drift, least square technique features were exploited in order to overcome these issues by adapting the virtual sensor output. The NOx adaptive virtual sensor was tested via comparison with experimental data, measured at the engine test bench on a turbocharged common-rail automotive Diesel engine. Furthermore, besides model validation, the experimental measurements were modified to simulate a sensor drift in order to enable full assessment of the proposed LS-based algorithm adaptation capabilities...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the scenario pollution implication of globalization process such as trade liberalization in the Bangladeshi economy toward a developing nation by 2015. In this paper globalization (trade liberalization) related air emissions such as CO 2, SO 2, and <b>NOx</b> have been <b>estimated</b> {{for the year}} 2000 and 2015. In the first part, the quantitative assessment of this paper reveals that the selected emissions are quite high in 2015 compared to 2000, which indicate an alarming rate to unseating for sustainable economy by 2015. And, {{in the second part}} this paper thrashes out Bangladeshi motivation of the environmental implication as a developing nation. In this globalization era however one important factor which can not be ignored off is trade liberalization for economic development and the use of energy for power generation. So, this paper suggests that to achieve sustainability emphasis must be given utilization of clean technology with environmental rules and regulations and environmental taxation policy so that negative impact on the environment could be reduced...|$|R

Results show that for the power sector SO 2 emissions will be very low for scenarios that include large scale implementation of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS).

40|$|In this paper, {{starting}} from previous works, further analyses on districtheating cogeneration systems are proposed and particular attention {{is given to}} the NOx pollutant. In addition to the mean yearly concentrations, the hourly limit values for the protection of human health are also taken into account: the 18 th maximum hourly concentration is considered. The main steps necessary to characterize a districtheating plant are shown and twocase-studies are discussed. As far as the energetic aspects are concerned, these new plants always offer a primary energy saving, and the globalenvironmentaleffects are improved due to a reduction in CO 2. Local NOx emissions of a future plant do not decrease with respect to the existing emissions, and this aspect is closely connected to the type of CHP unit that is adopted (in this paper, natural gas fuelled engines). The localenvironmentaleffects due to <b>NOx</b> are <b>estimated</b> using a dispersion model, and the NOx concentrations (annual mean value and maximum hourly value) introduced by the new plant and those avoided through the non-use of existing domestic boilers are compared. For one of the case-studies emerges that some zones do not satisfy ambient air quality limits. For these reasons, a higher stack has been assumed for this critical case and the new results show that a reduction in the frequency of the overcomings, which is in agreement with expectations, can thus be obtained. The analysed case-studies have shown that even a small CHP districtheating plant can produce critical aspects and a pollutant concentration analysis is a useful tool to check localenvironmental aspect...|$|R
