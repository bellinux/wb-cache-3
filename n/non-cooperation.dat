5|$|The {{march was}} the most {{significant}} organised challenge to British authority since the <b>Non-cooperation</b> movement of 1920–22, and directly followed the Purna Swaraj declaration of sovereignty and self-rule by the Indian National Congress on 26 January 1930.|$|E
5|$|During the 1930 s, {{reform was}} {{gradually}} legislated by the British; Congress won {{victories in the}} resulting elections. The next decade was beset with political turmoil: Indian participation in World War II, the Congress' final push for <b>non-cooperation,</b> and an upsurge of Muslim nationalism led by the All-India Muslim League. The escalating political tension was capped by Independence in 1947. The jubilation was tempered by the bloody partition of the subcontinent into India and Pakistan.|$|E
5|$|In 1922, Sastri {{resigned}} his {{membership of}} the Indian National Congress after disagreeing with its leadership {{on the issue of}} <b>non-cooperation</b> and established the Indian Liberal Party along with Tej Bahadur Sapru. He consequently served as a President of the Indian Liberal Federation. In 1924, he accompanied Annie Besant on a visit to England demanding Home Rule for India. He also participated in the first and second round table conferences.|$|E
5|$|Officials in Texas, Florida, Alabama, Wyoming, Arizona, Oklahoma and Missouri opposed those {{elements}} of ACA over {{which they had}} discretion. For example, Missouri declined to expand Medicaid or establish a health insurance marketplace engaging in active <b>non-cooperation,</b> enacting a statute forbidding any state or local official to render any aid not specifically required by federal law. Other Republican politicians discouraged efforts to advertise {{the benefits of the}} law. Some conservative political groups launched ad campaigns to discourage enrollment.|$|E
5|$|Rama Raghoba Rane {{was born}} on 26 June 1918 {{in the village of}} Haveri in the Dharwar {{district}} of Karnataka. He was the son of R. P. Rane, a police constable from Chendia village of North Kanara district in Karnataka. Rane's early education, mostly in district school, was chaotic due to his father's frequent transfers. In 1930, he became influenced by the <b>Non-Cooperation</b> Movement, which agitated for Indian independence from Great Britain. His involvement with the movement alarmed his father, who moved the family back to their ancestral village at Chendia.|$|E
5|$|The {{increasing}} Muslim {{support for}} Gandhi, after he championed the Caliph's cause, temporarily stopped the Hindu-Muslim communal violence. It offered evidence of inter-communal harmony in joint Rowlatt satyagraha demonstration rallies, raising Gandhi's stature {{as the political}} leader to the British. His support for the Khilafat movement also helped him sideline Muhammad Ali Jinnah, who had announced {{his opposition to the}} satyagraha <b>non-cooperation</b> movement approach of Gandhi. Jinnah began creating his independent support, and later went on to lead the demand for West and East Pakistan.|$|E
5|$|European traders had {{established}} outposts in the Indian subcontinent by the 17th century. Through overwhelming military strength, the British East India company subdued local kingdoms and established {{themselves as the}} dominant force by the 18th century. Following the First War of Independence of 1857, the Government of India Act 1858 led the British Crown to assume direct control of India. In the decades following, civic society gradually emerged across India, most notably the Indian National Congress Party, formed in 1885. The period after World War I was marked by British reforms such as the Montague–Chelmsford Reforms, but it also witnessed {{the enactment of the}} repressive Rowlatt Act and calls for self-rule by Indian activists. The discontent of this period crystallised into nationwide non-violent movements of <b>non-cooperation</b> and civil disobedience, led by Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi.|$|E
5|$|Adams {{was born}} in Boston, {{brought up in a}} {{religious}} and politically active family. A graduate of Harvard College, he was an unsuccessful businessman and tax collector before concentrating on politics. He was an influential official of the Massachusetts House of Representatives and the Boston Town Meeting in the 1760s, and he became a part of a movement opposed to the British Parliament's efforts to tax the British American colonies without their consent. His 1768 Massachusetts Circular Letter calling for colonial <b>non-cooperation</b> prompted the occupation of Boston by British soldiers, eventually resulting in the Boston Massacre of 1770. Adams and his colleagues devised a committee of correspondence system in 1772 to help coordinate resistance to what he saw as the British government's attempts to violate the British Constitution {{at the expense of the}} colonies, which linked like-minded Patriots throughout the Thirteen Colonies. Continued resistance to British policy resulted in the 1773 Boston Tea Party and the coming of the American Revolution.|$|E
5|$|E.V. Ramasamy {{joined the}} Indian National Congress in 1919 after quitting his {{business}} and resigning from public posts. He held the chairmanship of Erode Municipality and wholeheartedly undertook constructive programs spreading the use of Khadi, picketing toddy shops, boycotting shops selling foreign cloth, and eradicating untouchability. In 1921, Periyar courted imprisonment for picketing toddy shops in Erode. When his wife {{as well as his}} sister joined the agitation, it gained momentum, and the administration was forced to come to a compromise. He was again arrested during the <b>Non-Cooperation</b> movement and the Temperance movement. In 1922, Periyar was elected the President of the Madras Presidency Congress Committee during the Tirupur session, where he advocated strongly for reservation in government jobs and education. His attempts were defeated in the Congress party due to a strong presence of discrimination and indifference, which led to his leaving the party in 1925.|$|E
25|$|Civil disobedience and <b>non-cooperation</b> as practised under Satyagraha {{are based}} on the “law of suffering”, a {{doctrine}} that the endurance of suffering is a means to an end. This end usually implies a moral upliftment or progress of an individual or society. Therefore, <b>non-cooperation</b> in Satyagraha is in fact a means to secure the cooperation of the opponent consistently with truth and justice.|$|E
25|$|In 1920, {{after the}} British {{government}} refused to back down, Gandhi began his campaign of <b>non-cooperation,</b> prompting many Indians to return British awards and honours, {{to resign from}} civil service, and to again boycott British goods. In addition, Gandhi reorganised the Congress, transforming it into a mass movement and opening its membership to even the poorest Indians. Although Gandhi halted the <b>non-cooperation</b> movement in 1922 after the violent incident at Chauri Chaura, the movement revived again, in the mid-1920s.|$|E
25|$|As Assam got {{sucked into}} the <b>Non-Cooperation</b> Movement, the Assam Association slowly {{transformed}} itself into the Assam Pradesh Congress Committee (with 5 seats in AICC) in 1920–21.|$|E
25|$|Tamil cinema {{first became}} politicized during the <b>Non-cooperation</b> movement. With {{the advent of}} sound in films, large numbers of theater {{personnel}} were attracted, {{many of whom were}} already active in politics.|$|E
25|$|Movements {{most often}} {{associated}} with nonviolence are the <b>non-cooperation</b> campaign for Indian independence led by Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, the Civil Rights Movement in the United States, and the People Power Revolution in the Philippines.|$|E
25|$|The party {{under the}} {{leadership}} of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the founding father of Bangladesh, led the struggle for independence, first through massive populist and civil disobedience movements, such as the Six Point Movement and 1971 <b>Non-Cooperation</b> Movement, and then during the Bangladesh Liberation War.|$|E
25|$|At Frongoch {{he was one}} of the organisers of {{a program}} of protest and <b>non-cooperation</b> with authorities, similar to that later carried on by IRA internees in Northern Ireland in the 1970s and 1980s. The camp proved an {{excellent}} opportunity for networking with physical-force republicans from all over the country, of which he became a key organiser.|$|E
25|$|In 1920, Srinivasa Iyengar {{resigned}} as the Advocate-General of Madras {{and from the}} Governor's executive council protesting the Jallianwalla Bagh massacre. In February 1921, he also returned his C.I.E in protest. He joined the Indian National Congress and participated in the <b>Non-Cooperation</b> Movement. In 1927, Srinivasa Iyengar chaired the reception committee of the 29th session of the Indian National Congress which met in Madras.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{returning}} to India in 1916 Giri {{enrolled at the}} Madras High Court. He also {{became a member of}} the Congress party, attended its Lucknow session and joined the Home Rule Movement of Annie Beasant. Giri abandoned a flourishing legal career in response to Mahatma Gandhi's call for a <b>Non-Cooperation</b> Movement in 1920. In 1922, he was arrested for the first time for demonstrating against the sale of liquor shops.|$|E
25|$|In 1922 Congress was boycotting {{the visit}} of the Prince of Wales {{as part of the}} <b>Non-Cooperation</b> Movement. He came to Madras and took part in this event. In 1923–25 Kamaraj participated in the Nagpur Flag Satyagraha. In 1927, Kamaraj started the Sword Satyagraha in Madras and was chosen to lead the Neil Statue Satyagraha, but this was given up later in view of the Simon Commission boycott.|$|E
25|$|Third President Mr. K.Ramanathan, {{realising}} the ineffectiveness and {{futility of}} <b>non-cooperation</b> with the Government {{when the other}} major communities represented by UMNO and MCA cooperated, the MIC contested in 1952 Kuala Lumpur Municipal Elections in alliance with the IMP under Dato' Onn bin Jaafar and other non-communal organizations. However the 1952 elections proved the MIC's attempt to preach and practise non-communalism would not prevail in Malayan politics when communalism was the winning factor.|$|E
25|$|A truce was {{declared}} on 12 March 1930, after another child {{was killed by}} New Zealand marines who were now suffering heat exhaustion and tropical infections. The male Mau members returned to their homes, {{on the condition that}} they retain their right to engage in <b>non-cooperation.</b> Meanwhile, Nelson and other exiled leaders continued to lobby the New Zealand Government and communicate their progress to the Mau. In 1931, news of the growing resistance to the British rule of India reached many Samoan villages.|$|E
25|$|The {{first big}} {{national}} involvement of Nehru {{came at the}} onset of the <b>Non-cooperation</b> movement in 1920. He led the movement in the United Provinces (now Uttar Pradesh). Nehru was arrested on charges of anti-governmental activities in 1921, and was released a few months later. In the rift that formed within the Congress following the sudden closure of the non-co-operation movement after the Chauri Chaura incident, Nehru remained loyal to Gandhi and did not join the Swaraj Party formed by his father Motilal Nehru and CR Das.|$|E
25|$|Gandhi did {{not support}} the violent actions, and {{consequently}} suspended the <b>Non-cooperation</b> movement at its peak. British officials hoped to suppress the civil disobedience by arresting Gandhi, and on 10 March 1922, Lord Reading ordered Gandhi's arrest. The initial discussion that Conrad witnessed was now a reality, Gandhi had been arrested, tried and jailed, but the results were not as the British intended. Conrad experienced firsthand the transformative influence of one man as he peacefully expressed true character, and soon the control of the British Raj gave way to India's leadership.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} year, the Governor {{found himself}} {{dealing with a}} series of communal riots that in August 1921 broke out in the Malabar District. Following a number of cases of arson, looting, and assaults, Willingdon declared martial law just before the government of India sent in a large force to quell the riots. At around the same time, over 10,000 workers in the Buckingham and Carnatic Mills of Madras city organised for six months a general strike contemporaneous with the <b>non-cooperation</b> movement, which also sparked riots between pro- and anti-strike workers that were again only put down with police intervention.|$|E
25|$|Of course these {{movements}} exercised tremendous {{pressure on the}} British Government and shook the government machinery. But the real importance, to my mind, lay in the effect they had on our own people, and especially the village masses.... <b>Non-cooperation</b> dragged {{them out of the}} mire and gave them self-respect and self-reliance.... They acted courageously and did not submit so easily to unjust oppression; their outlook widened and they began to think a little in terms of India as a whole.... It was a remarkable transformation and the Congress, under Gandhi's leadership, must have the credit for it.|$|E
25|$|On August 21, 1983, after {{a three-year}} exile in the United States, Aquino was assassinated as he disembarked from a Taiwanese {{commercial}} flight at the Manila International Airport (which was later renamed in Aquino's honor). His assassination shocked and outraged many Filipinos, {{most of whom}} had lost confidence in the Marcos administration. The event led to more suspicions about the government, triggering <b>non-cooperation</b> among Filipinos that eventually led to outright civil disobedience. It also shook the Marcos government, which was by then deteriorating due, in part, to Marcos' worsening health and ultimately fatal illness (lupus erythematosus).|$|E
25|$|A {{tendency}} towards reciprocity {{implies that}} people will feel obligated to respond if someone helps them. This {{has been used by}} charities that give small gifts to potential donors hoping thereby to induce reciprocity. Another method is to announce publicly that someone has given a large donation. The tendency to reciprocate can even generalize so people become more helpful toward others in general after being helped. On the other hand, people will avoid or even retaliate against those perceived not to be cooperating. People sometimes mistakenly fail to help when they intended to, or their helping may not be noticed, which may cause unintended conflicts. As such, it may be an optimal strategy to be slightly forgiving of and have a slightly generous interpretation of <b>non-cooperation.</b>|$|E
25|$|There were {{immediate}} {{protests and}} revolts against the British occupation. In 1828, {{two years after}} the Treaty of Yandaboo, Gomdhar Konwar rose in revolt against the British, but he was easily suppressed. In 1830 Dhananjoy Burhagohain, Piyali Phukan and Jiuram Medhi rose in revolt, and they were sentenced to death. In the Indian rebellion of 1857, rebels supporters offered resistance in the form of <b>non-cooperation,</b> and Maniram Dewan and Piyali Baruah were executed for their roles. In 1861 peasants of Nagaon gathered at Phulaguri for a raiz mel (peoples' assembly) to protest against taxes on betel-nut and paan. Lt. Singer, a British officer got into a fracas with the peasants and was killed, after which the protests were violently suppressed.|$|E
25|$|Willingdon {{returned}} to the United Kingdom from Bombay only briefly before he was appointed on 10 April 1919 as the Governor of Madras. This posting came shortly after the Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms of 1918 were formalised by the Government of India Act, which distributed power in India between the executive and legislative bodies. Thus, in November 1920, Willingdon dropped the writs of election for the first election for the Madras Legislative Council; however, due to their adherence to Gandhi's <b>non-cooperation</b> movement, the Indian National Congress party refused to run any candidates and the Justice Party was subsequently swept into power. Willingdon appointed A. Subbarayalu Reddiar as his premier and Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn (a former Governor General of Canada) opened {{the first meeting of}} the Legislative Assembly.|$|E
25|$|When {{democracy}} was restored in 1982, Lechín {{and the other}} leaders of the FSTMB and COB returned to the political arena. In his restored position as top labor leader in the country, he strongly criticized the economic policies of president Hernán Siles Zuazo (1982–85), coming close to toppling his beleaguered regime with crippling strikes and other <b>non-cooperation</b> measures. Lechín also vigorously opposed the neoliberal administration of Víctor Paz Estenssoro, who served his fourth term from 1985 to 1989. The closure {{of most of the}} country's tin mines by Paz Estenssoro (due to declining production and the collapse of world prices) led to considerable in-fighting in the unions. In 1987, Lechín—now aged 73—retired from the leadership of the FSTMB and was voted out as head of the COB. He was replaced in the FSTMB by Filemón Escobar and by Genaro Flores in the COB.|$|E
25|$|Though one of {{the most}} {{politically}} experienced of Sinn Féin's TDs, Cosgrave was not among the major leadership of the party. Nevertheless, after Cathal Brugha, the first President of Dáil Éireann, resigned and Éamon de Valera, who with the help of Michael Collins had just escaped from prison with a key made from a candle, took over, he was appointed to de Valera's cabinet as Minister for Local Government, his close friendship with de Valera being {{one of the}} reasons he was chosen. Another reason was his long experience on Dublin Corporation, most recently as Chairman of its Finance Committee. His chief task as minister was the job of organising the <b>non-cooperation</b> of the people with the British authorities and establishing an alternative system of government. Cosgrave was very successful in his role at the Department of Local Government.|$|E
25|$|In {{his early}} days, C. P. was {{an admirer of}} Gopal Krishna Gokhale and desired to join the Servants of India society in Poona. In 1912, he fought on behalf of Jiddu Narayaniah against Annie Besant for the custody of his sons J. Krishnamurti and Nityananda in the famous Besant Narayaniah trial and won. Besant, however, later got the verdict annulled by {{appealing}} to the Privy Council in England. However, {{as a result of}} this case, C. P. developed an admiration for Annie Besant and collaborated with her in organising the Home Rule League and served as its vice-president. In 1917, he became the Secretary of the Indian National Congress. C. P. also edited Annie Besant's newspaper New India during her incarceration. at the same time, campaigning vigorously for her release. C. P., later, distanced himself from the Indian Independence after disagreeing with Mahatma Gandhi over the Swadeshi and <b>Non-Cooperation</b> movements.|$|E
25|$|Shripad Amrutpant Dange {{was born}} in the village of Karanjgaon in Niphad Taluka of Nashik District, Maharashtra. His father worked in Mumbai as {{government}} officer and was major landowner of the area and lived in one palace like house in Karanjgaon. Dange was sent to study in Pune. He was expelled from college for organising a movement against compulsory teaching of the Bible. While in work, Dange was exposed to conditions of workers when he undertook voluntary work in the textile mill areas of Mumbai. Dange was drawn into active politics by the fervour of nationalist movement against the British rule in India. Bal Gangadhar Tilak, a veteran leader of Indian National Congress from Maharashtra, the earliest proponent of swaraj (complete independence) greatly inspired young Dange. Later, when Mahatma Gandhi launched the <b>Non-Cooperation</b> Movement in 1920, Dange gave up his studies and joined the Independence movement.|$|E
25|$|Released in 1920, {{sensing that}} Gandhi rode the revolutionary tide, as a {{mouthpiece}} of the Jugantar, Bhupen wanted to expedite the tempo of the <b>non-cooperation</b> movement and met Mohandas K. Gandhi at the Nagpur {{session of the}} Congress Party. Having the latter’s promise that, if the people responded well, he would convert the Party into free India’s Republican Parliament, Bhupen went to Pondicherry to consult Sri Aurobindo {{about the future of}} the Jugantar. Diffident about Gandhi’s expectation to win freedom within one year, Sri Aurobindo recognised that Gandhi represented a tremendous force and it would be unwise to resist him; the former advised the revolutionaries to collaborate without, however, making of non-violence a fetish, sticking to their own ethics. After Gandhi’s failure, the Jugantar sided Deshabandhu Chittaranjan Das in his Swarajya programme as an antidote: by observing overtly, all over India, the eighth anniversary of Bagha Jatin’s death, on 9 September 1923, they intimated their intention to follow their own conviction. Deshabandhu proposed to visit the spot where Bagha Jatin fought and to raise there a memorial.|$|E
25|$|Srinivasa Iyengar {{was born}} in the Ramanathapuram {{district}} of Madras Presidency. He graduated in law and practised as a lawyer in the Madras High Court rising to become Advocate-General in 1916. He also served {{as a member of the}} bar council and was nominated as the law member of the Governor's executive council. He resigned his Advocate-General post, his seat in the Governor's executive council and returned his C. I. E. in 1920 in protest against the Jallianwala Bagh massacre and joined the Indian National Congress. He participated in the <b>Non-Cooperation</b> Movement. However, in 1923, he broke away along with other leaders as Motilal Nehru and Chittaranjan Das due to differences with Mahatma Gandhi over participating in elections. The breakaway faction later formed the Swarajya Party. Iyengar served as the President of the Tamil Nadu Congress Committee and later, the Madras Province Swarajya Party and was the leader of the party when it refused to form the government in the province despite winning a majority in the 1926 elections. In later life, he established the Independence of India league and organised protests against the Simon Commission. He retired from politics due to differences with other Congress politicians over the goal of Dominion status. He briefly returned to politics in 1938. On 19 May 1941, Iyengar died in his house in Madras.|$|E
25|$|Patel {{supported}} Gandhi's <b>Non-Cooperation</b> {{movement and}} toured {{the state to}} recruit more than 300,000 members and raise over Rs.1.5million in funds. Helping organise bonfires of British goods in Ahmedabad, Patel threw in all his English-style clothes. Along with his daughter Mani and son Dahya, he switched completely to wearing khadi. Patel also supported Gandhi's controversial suspension of resistance {{in the wake of}} the Chauri Chaura incident. In Gujarat he worked extensively in the following years against alcoholism, untouchability, and caste discrimination, as well as for the empowerment of women. In the Congress, he was a resolute supporter of Gandhi against his Swarajist critics. Patel was elected Ahmedabad's municipal president in 1922, 1924, and 1927; during his terms, he oversaw improvements in infrastructure: the supply of electricity was increased, and drainage and sanitation systems were extended throughout the city. The school system underwent major reforms. He fought for the recognition and payment of teachers employed in schools established by nationalists (out of British control) and even took on sensitive Hindu–Muslim issues. Patel personally led relief efforts in the aftermath of the intense torrential rainfall of 1927 that caused major floods in the city and in the Kheda district, and great destruction of life and property. He established refuge centres across the district, raised volunteers, and arranged for supplies of food, medicines, and clothing, as well as emergency funds from the government and the public.|$|E
