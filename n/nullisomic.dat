By coupling <b>nullisomic</b> deletion mapping with meiotic linkage mapping, loci known to be located on a particular chromosome or chromosome arm can be tested for recombination. This approach {{has been used to}} map three isozyme loci, EstA (Esterase A), EstB (Esterase B), and AcpA (Acid Phosphatase A), with respect to the ChxA locus (cycloheximide resistance) and 11 RAPDs (randomly amplified polymorphic DNAs). To assign isozyme loci to chromosomes, clones of inbred strains C 3 or C 2 were crossed to inbred strain B nullisomics. EstA, EstB and AcpA were mapped to chromosomes 1 R, 3 L and 3 R, respectively. To test EstA and AcpA for linkage to known RAPD loci on their respective chromosomes, a panel of Round II (genomic exclusion) segregants from a B/C 3 heterozygote was used. Using the MAPMAKER program, EstA was assigned to the ChxA linkage group on chromosome 1 R, and a detailed map was constructed that includes 10 RAPDs.

Of 14 putative chromosome 5 mutations obtained by these two methods, seven are shown by genetic analysis to be recessive mutations on chromosome 5; one mapped elsewhere in the genome; six were infertile or failed to yield progeny in some of the diagnostic crosses and, thus, their genetic nature could not be determined with certainty...|$|E
40|$|Deficient 1 aneuploids {{are proving}} {{of great value}} in the {{systematic}} genetic analysis of Triticum aestiyum L. emend. Fiori et Paoletti (=T. vulgare) (2 n = 42). More and more wheat breeders and geneticists are utilizing the monosomic (20 " + 1 ') and <b>nullisomic</b> (20 ") lines developed by Dr. E. R. Sears in the variety Chinese Spring. These aneuploids, by providing a means of associating genes with cerrain chromosomes, have simplified inheritance studies in the hexaploid wheats. Moreover they make possible the controlled synthesis of new varieties since specific chromosomes from other varieties, species or even genera may be substituted for the deficient one. The development of a monosomic or <b>nullisomic</b> series in the emmer wheats would aid greatly in the genetic study of that group. A program is underway at the University of Saskatchewan to develop such a series in T. durum Desf. var.

The material for the present paper was obtained from the aforementioned program. Information is presented showing that it may be very difficult, if not impossible, to obtain deficient lines in Golden Ball. 1 Monosomic and <b>nullisomic</b> plants having respectively one or both members of a single chromosome pair missing are referred to as deficient aneuploids.

Conjugants fail to complete pair separation, to eliminate one new micronucleus, and to amplify anlage DNA, and they eventually die. Some deficiencies block resorption of the pycnotic parental macronucleus, but we find no evidence for its regeneration. Some deficiencies cause aberrant anlage DNA loss. Those that do not cause DNA loss are epistatic to those that do, indicating that normal anlage development requires the dependent function of at least two types of genes. The possibility that these genes are involved in developmentally regulated anlage DNA rearrangements is discussed. Each observed conjugation defect indicates insufficiency of the parental macronucleus to direct postzygotic development and {{can be explained by the}} deficiency of essential conjugation genes that are expressed from the anlage.

"Xiaoyan 6 ") and rye (Secale cereale L. cv. "German White"). The chromosomal constitution of 2 n= 42 = 21 in WR 02 - 145 lines was confirmed by cytological and molecular cytogenetic methods. Using genomic in situ hybridization on root tip chromosome preparations, a pair of intact rye chromosomes was detected in the WR 02 - 145 lines. PCR using chromosome-specific primers confirmed the presence of 2 R chromosomes of rye in these wheat-rye lines, indicating that WR 02 - 145 lines are disomic chromosome substitution lines 2 R (213). The WR 02 - 145 lines are resistant to the powdery mildew (Erysiphe graminis DC. f. sp. tritici E.

40|$|The Lr 62 /Yr 42 {{translocation}} comprises mostly allen chromatin and retains {{only the}} very distal end of wheat chromosome arm 6 AL, including the telomere. The {{large amount of}} foreign chromatin prohibits commercial use of the resistance and an attempt was therefore made to exchange some of the introgressed chromatin for wheat chromatin. Plants heterozygous for the translocation, but lacking the Ph 1 locus were testcrossed with Chinese Spring <b>nullisomic</b> 6 A tetrasomic 6 B or <b>nullisomic</b> 6 A tetrasomic 6 D plants. Resistant (Lr 62) testcross F 1 progeny were evaluated {{for the presence of}} three marker loci and the data used to do a three-point genetic mapping analysis. Forty one recombinants were identified and characterised with further markers. The data revealed that Lr 62 /Yr 42 occurs towards the distal end of 6 AS and that the 6 AS telomeres of the wheat and translocation chromosomes were homoeologous. While the wheat (Chinese Spring ph 1 b mutant) and translocated chromosomes 6 A shared sufficient homoeology to allow for regular allosyndetic recombination, there were also major structural differences between them, including a duplication (marked by Xgwm 334) and translocation (marked by XsopwT). The duplicated region occurred on chromosome 6 A of the CS ph 1 b mutant and probably resulted from its inherent genomic instability. The structural differences caused irregular meiotic pairing and complex segregation data that were difficult to interpret. It was, however, possible to explain the majority of recombination products in keeping with the expected low frequency of allosyndetic recombination, and to identify the most promising recombinants. These retained both Lr 62 and Yr 42 within a comparatively small region of foreign DNA at the 6 AS telomere. Articl...|$|E

Oocytes with unreduced chromosome number were 13. 3 % and 6. 4 % in the two breeds, respectively, averaging 10. 2 %. In the PO, out of 100 MII oocytes I pb analyzed, two oocytes were <b>nullisomic</b> for chromosome 5 (2. 0 %) and one disomic for the same chromosome (1. 0 %). In the MA, out of 100 MII oocytes I pb, one oocyte was found <b>nullisomic</b> for chromosome 5 (1. 0 %) and one was disomic for the X chromosome (1. 0 %). Out of 200 MII oocytes I pb, the mean rate of aneuploidy (nullisomy disomy) for the two chromosomes scored was 2. 5 %, of which 1. 5 % was due to nullisomy and 1. 0 % due to disomy. By averaging these data with those previously reported on dairy cattle, the overall incidence of aneuploidy in cattle, as a species, was 2. 25 %, of which 1. 25 % was due to nullisomy and 1. 0 % due to disomy. The results so far achieved indicate similar rates of aneuploidy among the four cattle breeds investigated. Interspecific comparison between cattle (Xcen- 5 probes) and pig (Sus scrofa domestica) (1 – 10 probes) also reveal similar rates. Further studies are needed that use more probes to investigate the interchromosomal effect.

A total of 10 polymorphisms linked to the mat-Pmr segment of the left arm of micronuclear chromosome 2 have been identified. This constitutes the largest linkage group described in T. thermophila. We also provide here the first crude estimate of the frequency of meiotic recombination in the mat region, 20 kb/cM. This frequency is much higher than that observed in most other eukaryotes. Special features of Tetrahymena genetics enhanced the power of the RAPD method: the ability to obtain in a single step meiotic segregants that are whole-genome homozygotes and the availability of <b>nullisomic</b> strains permitting quick deletion mapping of polymorphisms to micronuclear chromosomes or chromosome segments.

Further restriction enzyme digestion and hybridization studies suggest that the clone also contains sequences that are not present in the somatic macronucleus. The flanking sequences of the C 4 A 2 repeats in this clone were separated into four restriction fragments, one from one side and three from the other. These fragments were used as probes for Southern hybridization to study the organizations of similar sequences in the macronucleus and micronucleus. All four fragments hybridized to many fragments of restriction enzyme digested micronuclear DNA. However, none of these hybridizations were detected in the macronucleus. Thus, these families of repetitive DNA are completely eliminated from the macronucleus. Further analysis suggested that the four different sequences may be linked at other locations of the genome.

In this study, the monosomic and <b>nullisomic</b> plants losing {{one or two}} copies of C 2 chromosome from allotetraploid Brassica napus L. (2 n= 38, AACC) were produced and compared for their transcriptome. By the comparative analyses on the global transcript profiles with the euploid donor, genome-wide alterations in gene expression were revealed in two aneuploids, and their majority of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) resulted from the trans-acting effects of the zero and one copy of C 2 chromosome. The higher number of up-regulated genes than down-regulated genes on other chromosomes suggested that the genome responded to the C 2 loss via enhancing the expression of certain genes. Particularly, more DEGs were detected in the monosomics than nullisomics, contrasting with their phenotypes. The gene expression of the other chromosomes was differently affected, and several dysregulated domains in which up- or downregulated genes obviously clustered were identifiable.

40|$|AbstractDuringTetrahymena thermophilaconjugation, new somatic macronuclei develop from {{a common}} zygotic nucleus derived from meiotic {{products}} of the germline, and the old parental somatic nucleus is destroyed. The transcription inhibitor actinomycin D disrupts many events of postzygotic conjugation (cycloheximide causes indistinguishable effects). Early treatment causes a block of all postzygotic development, suggesting a transcription requirement for conjugants to pass a checkpoint, allowing entry into postzygotic development. Thereafter, pair separation, resorption of the old macronucleus, and elimination {{of one of the}} new micronuclei are blocked if actinomycin D is added at least 1. 5 hr before each of these events normally occurs. Treatment just before DNA rearrangements in the developing macronuclei (anlagen) causes aberrant anlage DNA loss, suggesting that this DNA loss may be caused by inhibition of gene expression involved in genome rearrangements. DNA loss, and correlated lethality, appear to require previous gene expression, since actinomycin D added earlier causes cells to arrest in development without anlage DNA loss, and these conjugants can (at some frequency) complete conjugation and make viable progeny once actinomycin D is removed. The old macronucleus already had been inactivated before most actinomycin D treatments were initiated, indicating that the various induced defects we observed are the result of inhibition of postzygotic gene expression, presumably in anlagen. The defects induced by actinomycin D are similar to defects previously observed in conjugants harboring <b>nullisomic</b> germline deficiencies but proficient old macronuclei...|$|E

Rye chromosomes involved in aneuploidy greatly outnumbered wheat chromosomes; in C 0 rye chromosomes 2 R and 5 R were most frequently involved. While the frequency of nullisomy 2 R was fairly constant in most cross combinations, nullisomy 5 R was more frequent in the most recalcitrant combination, and its frequency increased with time spent in culture with up to 70 % of green plants recovered late being <b>nullisomic</b> 5 R. Given that 5 R {{was not involved in}} meiotic aberrations with an above-average frequency, it is possible that its absence promotes androgenesis or green plant regeneration. Overall, aneuploidy among tested combinations reduced the average efficiency of double haploid production by 35 % and by 69 % in one recalcitrant combination, seriously reducing the yield of useful lines...|$|E
40|$|The {{most common}} type of {{karyotype}} abnormality detected in infertile subjects is represented by Klinefelter's syndrome, and the most frequent non-chromosomal alteration is represented by Y chromosome long arm microdeletions. Here we report our experience and {{a review of the literature}} on sperm sex chromosome aneuploidies in these two conditions. Non mosaic 47,XXY Klinefelter patients (12 subjects) show a significantly lower percentage of normal Y-bearing sperm and slightly higher percentage of normal X-bearing sperm. Consistent with the hypothesis that 47,XXY germ cells may undergo and complete meiosis, aneuploidy rate for XX- and XY-disomies is also increased with respect to controls, whereas the percentage of YY-disomies is normal. Aneuploidy rates in men with mosaic 47,XXY/ 46,XY (11 subjects) are lower than those observed in men with non-mosaic Klinefelter's syndrome, and only the frequency of XY-disomic sperm is significantly higher with respect to controls. Although the great majority of children born by intracytoplasmic sperm injection from Klinefelter subjects are chromosomally normal, the risk of producing offspring with chromosome aneuploidies is significant. Men with Y chromosome microdeletions (14 subjects) showed a reduction of normal Y-bearing sperm, and an increase in <b>nullisomic</b> and XY-disomic sperm, suggesting an instability of the deleted Y chromosome causing its loss in germ cells, and meiotic alterations leading to XY non-disjunction. Intracytoplasmic injection of sperm from Y-deleted men will therefore transmit the deletion to male children, and therefore the spermatogenic impairment, but raises also concerns of generating 45,X and 47,XXY embryos...|$|E
40|$|Tetrahymena micronuclear DNA {{fragments}} {{have been}} cloned in the plasmid pBR 322. One clone, pTt 2512, {{has been found}} to contain the C-C-C-C-A-A hexanucleotide repeat which is also present in the macronuclear rDNA. Further restriction enzyme digestion and hybridization studies suggest that the clone also contains sequences that are not present in the somatic macronucleus. The flanking sequences of the C 4 A 2 repeats in this clone were separated into four restriction fragments, one from one side and three from the other. These fragments were used as probes for Southern hybridization to study the organizations of similar sequences in the macronucleus and micronucleus. All four fragments hybridized to many fragments of restriction enzyme digested micronuclear DNA. However, none of these hybridizations were detected in the macronucleus. Thus, these families of repetitive DNA are completely eliminated from the macronucleus. Further analysis suggested that the four different sequences may be linked at other locations of the genome. Using <b>nullisomic</b> strains of Tetrahymena, it is found {{that at least one of}} these sequences is present in more than one chromosome. Studies of various normal and star strains of Tetrahymena suggest that these sequences are stable in the normal micronucleus but are altered drastically in the defective micronuclei of the star strains. Eliminated DNA of similar nature has also been found in at least five other randomly selected clones of micronuclear DNA and may be present widely in the genome...|$|E
40|$|The {{organization}} of the 5 S genes in the genome of Tetrahymena thermophila was examined in various strains, with germinal ageing, and the 5 S gene clusters were mapped to the MIC chromosomes. When MIC or MAC DNA is cut with the restriction enzyme Eco RI, electrophoresed, blotted, and probed with a 5 S rDNA probe, the banding patterns represent the clusters of the 5 S rRNA genes as well as flanking regions. The use of long gels and 60 h of electrophoresis at 10 mA permitted resolution of some 30 – 35 5 S gene clusters on fragments {{ranging in size from}} 30 - 2 kb (bottom of gel). The majority of the 5 S gene clusters were found in both MIC and MAC genomes, a few being MIC limited and a few MAC limited. The relative copy number of 5 S genes in each cluster was determined by integrating densitometric tracings made from autoradiograms. The total number of copies in the MAC was found to be 33 % greater than in the MIC. When different inbred strains were examined, the majority of the 5 S gene clusters were found to be conserved, with a few strain-specific clusters observed. Nine <b>nullisomic</b> strains missing both copies of one or more MIC chromosomes were used to map the 5 S gene clusters. The clusters were distributed non-randomly to four of the five MIC chromosomes, with 17 of them localized to chromosome 1. A deletion map of chromosome 1 was constructed using various deletion strains. Some of these deletion strains included B strain clones which had been in continuous culture for 15 years. Losses of 5 S gene clusters in these ageing MIC could be attributed to deletions of particular chromosomes. The chromosomal distribution of the 5 S gene clusters in Tetrahymena is unlike that found for the well-studied eukaryotes, Drosophila and Xenopus. ...|$|E
40|$|DNA {{sequence}} elimination and rearrangement {{occurs during}} the development of somatic cell lineages of eukaryotes and was first discovered over a century ago. However, the significance and mechanism of chromatin elimination are not understood. DNA elimination also occurs {{during the development}} of the somatic macronucleus from the germinal micronucleus in unicellular ciliated protozoa such as Tetrahymena thermophila. In this study foldback DNA from the micronucleus was used as a probe to isolate ten clones. All of those tested (4 / 4) contained sequences that were repetitive in the micronucleus and rearranged in the macronucleus. The presence of inverted repeated sequences was clearly demonstrated in one of them by electron microscopy. DNA sequence analysis showed that the left portion of this clone contains three tandem, directly repeated copies of a 340 -bp sequence, a 120 -bp portion of which appears in inverted orientation at a 1. 6 -kb distance. This clone, pTtFB 1, was subjected to a detailed analysis of its developmental fate. Subregions were subcloned and used as probes against Southern blots of micronuclear and macronuclear DNA. We found that all subregions defined repeated sequence families in the micronuclear genome. A minimum of four different families was defined, two of which are retained in the macronucleus and two of which are completely eliminated. The inverted repeat family is retained with little rearrangement. Two of the families, defined by subregions that do not contain parts of the inverted repeat, one in the "loop" and one in the "right flanking region," are totally eliminated during macronuclear development—and contain open reading frames. A fourth family occurs in the "loop" region and is rearranged extensively during development. The two gene families that are eliminated are stable in the micronuclear genome but are not clustered together as evidenced by experiments in which DNAs from <b>nullisomic</b> strains are used to map family members to specific micronuclear chromosomes. The inverted repeat family is also stable in the micronuclear genome and is dispersed among several chromosomes. The significance of retained inverted repeats to the process of elimination is discussed...|$|E
