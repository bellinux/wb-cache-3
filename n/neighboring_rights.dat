40|$|We {{consider}} a stochastic interacting particle system, the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP) on Z in continuous time. At {{any given time}} t, every site j ∈ Z can be occupied at most by one particle. Thus a configuration of the TASEP can be described by η = {ηj, j ∈ Z|ηj ∈ { 0, 1 }}. ηj is called the occupation variable of site j, which is defined by ηj = 1 if site j is occupied and ηj = 0 if site j is empty. The dynamics of the TASEP is defined as follows. Particles jumps on the <b>neighboring</b> <b>right</b> site with rate 1 provided that the site is empty. This means that jumps are independent {{of each other and}} occur after an exponential wait-ing time with mean 1, which is counted from the time instant when the right neighbor site is empty. On a macroscopic scale the density of particles u(x, t) evolves deterministi-cally according to the Burger’s equation ∂tu+ ∂x(u(1 − u)) = 0 [15]. Therefore it is natural to focus on fluctuations properties and large deviations, which have some interesting and unexpected features. The observables analyzed in our re...|$|R
40|$|The {{parietal cortex}} {{is central to}} {{numerical}} cognition. The right par-ietal region is primarily involved in basic quantity processing, while the left parietal region is additionally involved in precise number processing and numerical operations. Little is known about how the 2 regions interact during numerical cognition. We hypothesized that functional connectivity between {{the right and left}} parietal cortex is critical for numerical processing that engages both basic number representation and learned numerical operations. To test this hypothesis, we estimated neural activity using functional mag-netic resonance imaging in participants performing numerical and arithmetic processing on dot arrays. We first found task-based func-tional connectivity between a right parietal seed and the left sen-sorimotor cortex in all task conditions. As we hypothesized, we found enhanced functional connectivity between this right parietal seed and both the left parietal cortex and <b>neighboring</b> <b>right</b> parietal cortex, particularly during subtraction. The degree of functional connectivity also correlated with behavioral performance across individual participants, while activity within each region did not. These results highlight the role of parietal functional connectivity in numerical processing. They suggest that arithmetic processing depends on crosstalk between and within the parietal cortex and that this crosstalk contributes to one’s numerical competence...|$|R

40|$|Slowing of {{the heart}} {{was among the first}} effects of ATP (adenosine triphosphate) ob-served by Drury and Szent-Gy#{ 246 }rgyi (1929 - 30) in early studies with crude forms of this corn-pound. Drury (1936) later {{discussed}} the at-tractive simplicity of experiments in which changes in heart rate were a major component of the biologic action of any test substance. Many others since then have documented the negative chronotropic action of ATP, but in the intact experimental animal there are a num-ber of equally powerful concomitant actions, such as systemic vasodilatation, pulmonary vasoconstriction and depression of cardiac con-tractiiity, making it difficult to distinguish the primary from the secondary actions on heart rate. In some species there is furthermore a vagal component to the bradycardia from ATP, while in others there is not (Green and Stoner, 1950). With the availability of a technic for direct perfusion of the canine sinus node through its nutrient artery in vivo (James and Nadeau, 1962) it was decided to examine the actions of ATP directly on the sinus node. Special advan-tages of the technic include the preservation of normal innervation and blood supply of the sinus node in situ, the utilization of sufficiently small volumes so no significant concentration of recirculated test substance occurs to stimu-late extracardiac neuroreceptors, and the local perfusion of only sinus node and a small area of <b>neighboring</b> <b>right</b> atrial myocardium, thus avoiding any associated ventricular inotropic action.
