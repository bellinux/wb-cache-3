25|$|Baron Sir Ferdinand Jacob Heinrich von Mueller, KCMG (German: Müller) (30 June 1825 – 10 October 1896) was a German-Australian physician, geographer, {{and most}} notably, a botanist. He was {{appointed}} government botanist for the then colony of Victoria by Governor Charles La Trobe in 1853, and later {{director of the}} Royal Botanic Gardens, Melbourne. He also founded the <b>National</b> <b>Herbarium</b> of Victoria. He named many Australian plants.|$|E
25|$|It was {{initially}} described as Hygrophorus lewelliniae by Hungarian mycologist Károly Kalchbrenner in 1882, {{and later as}} Hygrocybe lewelliniae by Brittlebank in 1940, before being placed in the genus Humidicutis by Australian mycologist Tony Young in 1997. A molecular phylogenetics study {{found it to be}} more closely related to the type species of the genus Porpolomopsis, Porpolomopsis calyptriformis so it was transferred to Porpolomopsis. The original holotype specimen had been collected on 14 June 1880 in the vicinity of Western Port in Victoria by a Miss M.R.Lewellin and sent by Ferdinand von Mueller to Kalchbrenner in Budapest. It was likely destroyed in the First World War, although a watercolour of it by the collector survives and is located in the <b>National</b> <b>Herbarium</b> of Victoria. It has been compared with collections made by E. J. H. Corner of a Mycena rimosacuta in Borneo and found to be the same species. It may be that Humidicutis mavis is merely a white-coloured form of this species.|$|E
25|$|As far as known, the tumble thistle {{was first}} {{collected}} during an expedition by Leonhard Rauwolf (1573–1575), and this specimen {{can now be}} found in the <b>National</b> <b>Herbarium</b> in Leiden, the Netherlands. Tournefort, Von Gundelsheimer and Claude Aubriet also collected this plant while traveling through Greece, Turkey, former Armenia and Persia (1700–1702). Since Von Gundelsheimer was the first to have sighted the plant, his companions began to call it Gundelia. Tournefort already observed the remarkable morphology of the compounded flowerheads. Carl Linnaeus in 1753 adopted and published this name, providing the correct name. Henri Cassini in 1821 suggested to assign this species to the tribe Vernonieae. In 1828 he specified this assignment to the Vernonieae-Rolandreae, a group formalized by Christian Friedrich Lessing as subtribe Rolandrinae in 1831. Following a change in the interpretation of the complex inflorescence, Cassini rejected the interpretation by Linnaeus, and erected the genus Gundelsheimera, which is illegitimate as {{it is based on the}} same type specimen. Next, George Bentham and Joseph Dalton Hooker in 1873 placed the species in the tribe Arctotideae, subtribe Gundelieae (corrected name Gundelinae). Pierre Edmond Boissier in 1875 thought this taxon sufficiently divergent to erect the tribe Gundelieae. Karl August Otto Hoffmann misspelled the genus name as Grundelia, while remarking that Gundelsheimera is a synonym. Other authors hesitantly considered a position for Gundelia in the Cardueae sensu lato. It recently has also been combined with Warionia in the tribe Gundelieae by C. Jeffrey.|$|E
50|$|Professor Thomas Johnson {{retired in}} 1923, {{allowing}} Knowles {{to take over}} curatorship, working with Margaret Buchanan. As she became older Knowles' hearing began to fail such {{that she had to}} rely on an ear trumpet. Despite her deafness she would still attend meetings but she would signal when she thought that had been sufficient talk by putting down her hearing device. Knowles cared for and added to the <b>National</b> Museum <b>Herbarium</b> collection although never got the credit she deserved. In 1923 she planned to retire but pneumonia ended her life before she ended her career. Knowles died in Dublin on 27 April 1933.|$|R

25|$|Willian Henry Harvey (1811–1866), Keeper of the Herbarium and Professor in Botany at Trinity College, Dublin, {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{distinguished}} algologists of his time (Papenfuss, 1976 p.26). Apart from Ireland he visited South Africa, the Atlantic seaboard of America as far south as the Florida Keys on the east coast of North America and Australia (1854–1856). Between 1853 and 1856 he visited Ceylon, Australia and New Zealand and various parts of the South Pacific (Huisman, 2000 & Papenfuss, 1976). His collection in Australia resulted in one of the most extensive collections of marine plants and it inspired others (Huisman, 2000). He published: Nereis Australis Or Algae of the Southern Ocean in 1847–1849 and in 1846–51 his Phycologia Britannica appeared. His Nereis Boreali-Americana was published in three parts (1852–1858) this was the first, and still is (1976) is the only marine algal flora of North America as it includes taxa from the Pacific coast (Papenfuss, 1976 p.27). His five-volume Phycologia Australica was published in 1858 to 1863. These volumes remain to this day a most important reference to Australian algae (Huisman, 2000). His primary herbarium is in Trinity College, Dublin (TCD). However large collections of Harvey material are to be found in the Ulster Museum (BEL) (Morton, 1977; Morton, 1981); University of St Andrews (STA) and <b>National</b> <b>Herbarium</b> of Victoria (MEL), Melbourne, Australia (May, 1977). Many of the collectors of this period sent, and exchanged, specimens freely one to another, as a result Harvey's books show a remarkable knowledge of the distribution of algae elsewhere in the world. His Phycologia Britannica lists species recorded and collected from various parts of the British Isles. For example, he notes William Thompson (1805–1852), William McCalla (c.1814–1849), John Templeton (1766–1825) and D. Landsborough (1779–1854) who collected, as he did, from distinct sites in Ireland. The collections of these botanists, and many others, are represented separately by collections in the Ulster Museum (BEL).|$|E
500|$|His private zoological {{collections}} {{were incorporated}} into the collections at the USNM. [...] Lyon created two herbariums, the first containing plant specimens from Oregon and the second from the Indiana Dunes and lower Michigan.

500|$|The gorge {{is also an}} {{important}} site for whitebeams and in 2009 a survey was carried out by botanists from the Welsh <b>National</b> <b>Herbarium</b> as part of a nationwide survey of whitebeams. Among the eight species identified were three new species previously unknown to science. Nineteen specimens with oval-shaped leaves, were named the [...] "Cheddar whitebeam", Sorbus cheddarensis, [...] fifteen specimens with roundish leaves and greyish brown bark were named the [...] "Twin Cliffs whitebeam", Sorbus eminentoides, and thirteen with long, narrow leaves were named [...] "Gough’s Rock whitebeam", Sorbus rupicoloides. The Cheddar whitebeam, which has evolved as a cross between the common whitebeam and the grey-leaved whitebeam, is unique to the gorge, but its survival is threatened by the goats that were introduced specifically to keep down the growth of new trees and encourage the proliferation of rare plant species such as the Cheddar pink. Cuttings have been taken from the trees to be grafted and grown on at the Welsh <b>National</b> <b>Herbarium.</b>|$|E
50|$|Additionally in 1920, Fyles {{became the}} first artist {{employed}} by the Horticulture division, where she worked under William Tyrrell Macoun. Her paintings were intended to provide illustration of true colour and technical data of individual specimens. This was especially {{important in terms of}} experimenting with and documenting different varieties of fruit, vegetation and seeds. Her watercolours illustrate publications such as Cultivation of the Apple in Canada and The Raspberry and its Cultivation in Canada. Fyles assisted with the fight against the wheat rust epidemic of 1916 by beautifully illustrating in colour the disease, both microscopically and symptomatically on both wheat and barberry for a March 1917 widely distributed poster and pamphlet, “Black or Stem-Rust of Wheat”. She was indirectly mentioned as the artist for the poster by the Minister of Agriculture in his report and the original water colour is housed in the <b>National</b> Mycological <b>Herbarium</b> for Canada.|$|R
50|$|Originally from New Brunswick, Harrison {{graduated}} from Nova Scotia Agricultural College in 1922, and, in 1924, from the Ontario Agricultural College with a B.Sc. in agriculture. He earned an MSc in plant pathology from Macdonald Campus of McGill University a year later. A doctoral degree he {{started at the}} University of Toronto in 1929 was abandoned due to the Great Depression. He established a herbarium of mycological specimens where he was employed for many years at the Kentville Research Station (now the Atlantic Food and Horticulture Research Centre); most of his collections are now housed at the Canadian <b>National</b> Mycological <b>Herbarium.</b> His early research concerned the fungal infestation of plants, {{such as that of}} Colletotrichum lindemuthianum on beans (Phaseolus). Working with John Frederick DeWitt Hockey, they made many contributions to the control and prevention of diseases of horticultural crops. They {{were among the first to}} use the sticky slide spore trap to estimate the densities of fungal spores.|$|R
50|$|His {{studies on}} {{taxonomy}} and floristic yielded {{a substantial number}} of new taxa and a better knowledge about many plants and its nomenclature. He organized the Estação Agronómica Nacional's (<b>National</b> Agronomic Station) <b>herbarium,</b> which he rose from 3000 to almost 100,000 entries. He was a pioneer on ethnobotany studies in Portugal and published several contributions on vernacular nomenclature of Portuguese flora, cultivated plants and popular use of wild plants as food. For half a century he helped archaeologists, having published numerous works on paleoethnobotany, among more than 300 articles, notes and communications published throughout his life both in Portuguese and foreign publications.|$|R
500|$|The type {{specimen}} of common heath was collected in 1793 by French botanist Jacques Labillardière in Van Diemen's Land (now Tasmania) during a voyage with Antoine Bruni d'Entrecasteaux. Labillardière described {{it in his}} 1805 work Novae Hollandiae Plantarum Specimen, giving it its current name Epacris impressa. The Latin specific epithet impressa (meaning [...] "impressed" [...] or [...] "indented") alludes to the indentations on the floral tube.

500|$|The {{species was}} first {{described}} scientifically, by German botanist Franz Wilhelm Junghuhn, as Geaster triplex in 1840. The earlier genus name Geaster, introduced by Italian botanist Pier Antonio Micheli in 1727 in Nova Plantarum Genera, {{is considered an}} orthographical variant of Geastrum. Junghuhn, who was living in Indonesia and extensively surveyed its fungal flora, discovered the type specimen on Mount Panggerangi on the island Java, at an elevation between [...] Today, the type specimen is kept at the <b>National</b> <b>Herbarium</b> of the Netherlands in Leiden. The morphological feature used by Junghuhn to differentiate G.triplex from other similar earthstars was the collar-like structure of the inner layer of the exoperidium. American mycologist Curtis Gates Lloyd would later erroneously suggest that the species was a [...] "giant form" [...] of Geastrum saccatum.|$|E
500|$|Persoonia terminalis {{was first}} {{reported}} by Lawrie Johnson of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Sydney, in the 1981 edition of Flora of New South Wales. He {{viewed it as}} a distinctive subspecies of Persoonia nutans, a broadly defined species [...] that included many forms since classified as distinct. Queensland botanists Trevor Donald Stanley and Estelle M. Ross classed P.terminalis as part of Persoonia oxycoccoides in their 1983 work Flora of South-eastern Queensland. They considered it more likely a species in its own right, as they believed {{the description of the}} Queensland populations did not match the P. oxycoccoides from central New South Wales. Upon re-examining Persoonia nutans and Persoonia oxycoccoides, Johnson and Peter Weston concluded that there were in fact several distinct species, and that Persoonia terminalis was described as such in 1991. The type specimen was collected [...] south of the Torrington pub on the Emmaville–Torrington road by Weston and ecologist Peter Richards, and is now housed in the <b>National</b> <b>Herbarium</b> of New South Wales, {{which is part of the}} Royal Botanic Gardens and Domain Trust Sydney and Office of Environment and Heritage. The Herbarium houses over 1.2million other specimens. The generic name Persoonia is derived from the name of South African botanist Christiaan Hendrik Persoon. The specific name terminalis refers to the inflorescences (clusters of flowers) that are in this species at the ends of the branchlets. Its common name is the Torrington geebung.|$|E

The {{long-term}} {{conservation of}} viable ecosystems requires a broader {{understanding of the}} ecological processes involved. Because ecosystems react differently to different management practices, {{it is important to}} have a description and classification of the vegetation of an area available. As part of a vegetation survey programme for the newly acquired farms to be incorporated into the Mountain Zebra National Park, the vegetation of the Ebenhaezer section was investigated. Ahierarchical classification, vegetation map, description and ecological interpretation of the plant communities of the study area are presented. ATWINSPAN classification, refined by Braun-Blanquet procedures revealed eight distinct plant communities. Habitat factors associated with differences in vegetation include topography, soil form and grazing. Descriptions of the plant communities include diagnostic species as well as prominent and less conspicuous species of the tree, shrub and herbaceous layers.
