500|$|Despite her largely demure {{public persona}} as a {{traditional}} wife and homemaker, Nixon was not as self-effacing and timid as her critics often claimed. When a <b>news</b> <b>photographer</b> wanted her to strike yet another pose while wearing an apron, she firmly responded, [...] "I think we've had enough of this kitchen thing, don't you?" [...] Some journalists, such as columnist and White House Correspondent Robert Thompson felt that Pat was an ideal balance for the 1970s; Thompson wrote that she proved that [...] "women can {{play a vital role}} in world affairs" [...] while still retaining a [...] "feminine manner." [...] Other journalists felt that Pat represented the failings of the feminine mystique, and portrayed her as being out of step with her times. Those who opposed the Vietnam War identified her with the Nixon administration's policies, and, as a result, occasionally picketed her speaking events. After she had spoken to some of them, though, one student told the press that [...] "she wanted to listen. I felt like this is a woman who really cares about what we are doing. I was surprised." [...] Veteran CBS correspondent Mike Wallace expressed regret that the one major interview he was never able to conduct was that of Pat Nixon.|$|E
500|$|As the new {{constitution}} allowed re-election a single time, the PJ started an internal discussion over {{the leadership of the}} party after the presidency of Menem. Duhalde announced his intentions to run for president in 1999 shortly after the 1995 elections, leading to a fierce dispute with Menem. The president promoted an advertisement campaign [...] "Menem '99", despite of the term limit, to avoid being considered a lame duck. He also encouraged the governor of Tucumán, Palito Ortega, to run for the presidency as well. The political image of Duhalde was tarnished by a number of scandals that took place, and issues revealed by investigative journalists. Some of the scandals were related to the national government, such as the scandal over Argentine arms sales to Ecuador and Croatia, and harmed the reputation of the entire PJ. Other scandals involved Duhalde more directly, such as the corruption cases in the Buenos Aires provincial police and the murder of the <b>news</b> <b>photographer</b> José Luis Cabezas. The PJ lost the 1997 midterm elections, and Menem renewed the [...] "Menem '99" [...] campaign. Eventually, the Supreme Court ruled that his attempt to run for another presidential term was unconstitutional. Ortega run for vice president under Duhalde's ticket, but Duhalde was defeated by the radical Fernando de la Rúa.|$|E

The judge ruled dismissal with prejudice, meaning the defendants could not face the same charges in future.|$|E
50|$|Metinides’ {{aesthetics}} {{are derived}} from popular film of his era, especially black-and-white actions movies related to police and gangsters.

This movie influence {{can be seen in the}} sequence of photos, from environment to details, common for setting scenes in films. Even his use of wide-angle lenses and daylight flash is from seeing images of <b>news</b> <b>photographers</b> he saw in the movies.|$|R

One home that was swept away sustained total collapse of a poured concrete walk-out basement wall. A <b>news</b> <b>photographer</b> reported that the tornado [...] "left no grass" [...] as it crossed Kentucky Route 79 in this area, and canceled checks from near Irvington were later found in Ohio.

A curtain rod was found speared deeply into the trunk of one tree in town. Several tombstones in the Cap Anderson cemetery were toppled and broken, and some were displaced a small distance.
