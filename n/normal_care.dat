In implementing <b>Normal</b> Child-Birth <b>Care,</b> midwives must have a strong reason and evidence if they will perform intervention towards the process of natural child-birth. The procedure of standard must be obeyed at the Public Hospital of Sorong District because maternal mortality rate, infant mortality rate, and the occurrence of child-birth trauma (Caput Succedaneum and Chepalic Haematom) are higher than other hospitals in Indonesia.

Aim of this research was to obtain information about the factors related to <b>Normal</b> Child-Birth <b>Care</b> Standard by midwives at the Public Hospital of Sorong District. This was observational research using qualitative method.

40|$|Introduction.  Over {{the past}} few decades there has been a growing {{interest}} in the use of music, which has seen it used to achieve a diverse range of outcomes. While music as an intervention for hospital patients has subject to considerable evaluation, many of these studies are small and findings are therefore often contradictory. This systematic review was conducted to investigate the effectiveness of music as an intervention for hospital patients. Method.  A comprehensive search was undertaken involving all major health care databases. For studies {{to be included in the}} review they must have investigated the effect of music, involved adult hospital patients and used a randomized controlled trial design. These studies must also have used outcome measures such as anxiety, satisfaction, pain, mood and vital signs. Identified studies were critically appraised, and then categorized according to whether music was evaluated during <b>normal</b> <b>care</b> delivery or during invasive and unpleasant procedures. When appropriate, studies were combined in a meta-analysis. Results.  A total of 29 studies were identified that fulfilled the inclusion criteria, of which 10 were subsequently excluded following critical appraisal. Music played via headphones reduces anxiety of patients during <b>normal</b> <b>care</b> deliver, but it has no impact on the anxiety of patients undergoing procedures such as bronchoscopy, sigmoidoscopy or surgery with a spinal anaesthetic. Music produces a small reduction in respiratory rate during <b>normal</b> <b>care</b> delivery, but appears to have little effect on other vital sign parameters. It has no impact on the vital signs of patients undergoing procedures. Although the evidence is limited, music also appears improve the mood and tolerance of patients. Conclusion.  This review demonstrates the effectiveness of music for the reduction of anxiety during <b>normal</b> <b>care</b> deliver. Given the inexpensive nature of this intervention, and the lack of adverse events, it is recommended as an adjunct to <b>normal</b> <b>care</b> practices. This review also highlights the need for further research into many aspect of this intervention. David Evan...|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the efficacy of}} a delayed home exercise programme compared with <b>normal</b> <b>care</b> after primary total knee arthroplasty. Design: Single-blind, prospective, randomized, controlled trial. Participants: A total of 108 participants (61 % females, mean age 69 years [standard deviation 8. 7]), were randomized to a home-based exercise group (EG, n= 53) or to a control group (CG, n= 55). Methods: Two months post-operatively, the EG received a home exercise programme, while the CG received no additional guidance. The outcome measurements were: pain and disability, measured using the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC); healthrelated quality of life (HRQoL), measured using the Short Form- 36 questionnaire (SF- 36); maximal walking speed; isometric knee muscle strength; and the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test. Measurements were made at baseline and at 12 months thereafter. Results: At the 12 -month follow-up, maximal walking speed (p< 0. 001) and knee flexion strength (p= 0. 009) were significantly greater in the EG.

After one year reported cigarette consumption in the intervention group (714 men) was one-quarter that of the "normal care" group (731 men); over 10 years the net reported reduction averaged 53 %. The intervention group experienced less nasal obstruction, cough, dyspnoea, and loss of ventilatory function. Over 10 years their mortality from coronary heart disease was 18 % lower than controls (49 and 62 deaths), and that for lung cancer was 23 % lower (18 and 24 deaths). Deaths from non-lung cancers were higher in the intervention group (28 v 12 deaths).
