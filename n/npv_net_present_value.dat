The military facilities located in three regions (i. e., Gimpo (northern part), Deajeon (middle part), and Pohang (southern part)) in South Korea were selected for the case studies. The results of this study are as follows. First, in terms of <b>NPV</b> 25 (<b>net</b> <b>present</b> <b>value</b> in 25 years), for the roofs with a lower orientation, ToI- 2 (opt), was selected as the optimal rooftop PV system, and for the roofs with a higher orientation, ToI- 2 (ext). or ToI- 3 (Opt), was selected as the optimal rooftop PV system. Second, in terms of SIR 25 (savings-to-investment ratio in 25 years), for the roofs with a lower orientation, ToI-(ext), was selected as the optimal rooftop PV system, and for the roofs with a higher orientation, ToI- 3 (Opt). was selected as the optimal rooftop PV system. The simplified estimation model may be useful for decision makers, including experts and non-experts (i. e., architects, owners, construction managers, etc.), or policymakers in determining the optimal rooftop PV system for a gable roof.

40|$|It is {{expected}} that the rooftop photovoltaic (PV) systems can realize net-zero energy solar buildings (nZESBs), {{but it is not}} enough by itself. To realize 100 % of nZESBs, the smart photovoltaic system blind (SPSB) was proposed to generate electricity in the PV system and to reduce indoor cooling demands through the shading effect in the blind system. Before its implementation, this study aims to investigate the impact of the proposed SPSB on nZESBs, which is conducted in three ways (i. e., technical, economic, and political analyses). The detailed results can be summarized as follows: (i) technical analysis: when applying the SPSBCIGS& 2 -axis (which represents the SPSB with the copper-indium-gallium-selenide (CIGS) PV panel and the two-axis tracking system), its energy self-sufficiency rate was determined to be 1. 25 - 2. 31 times superior to other alternatives; (ii) economic analysis: in terms of the <b>NPV</b> 25 (<b>net</b> <b>present</b> <b>value</b> at year 25), SPSBCIGS& 2 -axis was determined to be 1. 41 - 2. 97 times superior to others; in terms of the SIR 25 (savings-to-investment ratio at year 25), 1. 14 - 1. 26 times; {{and in terms of the}} break-even point, 1. 4 - 3. 0 years; and (iii) political analysis: the grid-connected utilization plan including solar renewable energy certificates (GC(incl.

The integration of a solar thermal system combined with a borehole thermal energy storage (BTES) for covering the space heating demand of the buildings as well as the application of CO 2 heat pumps and water storage tanks for domestic hot water (DHW) production were investigated in order to apply more renewable energy sources. The energy analysis included several measures, such as modeling the energy demand of the buildings, finding a reasonable number of solar collectors to be installed and dimensioning a ground source heat pump (with the use of CoolPack and Engineering Equation Solver EES) and a geothermal storage (Earth Energy Designer Software EED) as well as CO 2 heat pumps (CoolPack/EES). An economic analysis of all proposed measures {{has been carried out}} based on the <b>Net</b> <b>Present</b> <b>Value</b> (<b>NPV)</b> and <b>Net</b> <b>Present</b> <b>Value</b> Quotient (NPVQ). Initial costs, annual costs, annual savings as well as the payback time of the energy systems have been calculated. It is found that it is not feasible to invest in the proposed energy system for space heating because the payback time (28 years) of the system is longer than the lifetime of the solar thermal system. Furthermore, the solar gain from the solar collectors is not sufficient for recovering the ground temperature of the BTES with solar energy only which is why external sources would be needed for supplying the remaining energy needed to recover the ground temperature. Results show that an integration of CO 2 heat pumps and water storage tanks for DHW production is very promising as the payback time for the investigated system is only 4 years which is why this part should be investigated further...|$|R

In this completion knowing e-customer and predicting his behavior is very important. In this paper we describe e-customer behavior in B 2 C relationships and then according to this behavior a new model for evaluating e-customer in B 2 C e-commerce relationships will be described. The most important thing in our e-CLV (Electronic Customer Lifetime Value) model is considering market's risks that are affecting customer cash flow in future. A lot of CLV models are based on simple <b>NPV</b> (simple <b>net</b> <b>present</b> <b>value).</b> However simple <b>NPV</b> can assess a good value for CLV, but simple NPV ignores two important aspects of B 2 C e-relationship which are market risks and big amount of customer data in e-commerce context. Therefore, simple NPV isn't enough for assessing e-CLV in high risk B 2 C markets. Instead of NPV, real option analyses could lead us to a better estimation for future cash flow of customers. With real option analyses, we predict all the future states with probability of each of them. And then calculate the more accurate of future customer cash flow. In this paper after a brief history of CLV, we explain customer behavior in B 2 C markets especially for e-retailers. Then with using real option analyses, we introduce our CLV model.

The breakeven value indicates the maximum amount that could be paid for the robots given the costs of alternative milking equipment and other important factors (e. g., milk yields, prices, length of useful life of technologies). The analysis simulates several scenarios under three herd sizes, 60, 120, and 180 cows. The base-case {{results indicate that the}} mean breakeven values are $ 192, 056, $ 374, 538, and $ 553, 671 {{for each of the three}} progressively larger herd sizes. These must be compared to the per-unit RMS cost (about $ 125, 000 to $ 150, 000) and the cost of any construction or installation of other equipment that accompanies the RMS. Sensitivity analysis shows that each additional dollar spent on milking labor in the parlor increases the breakeven value by $ 4. 10 to $ 4. 30. Each dollar increase in parlor costs increases the breakeven value by $ 0. 45 to $ 0. 56. Also, each additional kilogram of initial milk production (under a 2 × system in the parlor) decreases the breakeven by $ 9. 91 to $ 10. 64. Finally, each additional year of useful life for the RMS increases the per-unit breakeven by about $ 16, 000 while increasing the life of the parlor by 1 yr decreases the breakeven value by between $ 5, 000 and $ 6, 000.

30|$|Carbon dioxide {{flooding}} {{is considered}} one of the most commonly used miscible gas injections to improve oil recovery, and its applicability has grown significantly due to its availability, greenhouse effect and easy achievement of miscibility relative to other gases. Therefore, miscible CO 2 -injection {{is considered one}} of the most feasible methods worldwide. For long-term strategies in Iraq and the Middle East, most oilfields will need to improve oil recovery as oil reserves are falling. This paper presents a study of the effect of various CO 2 -injection modes on miscible flood performance of the highly heterogeneous clastic reservoir. An integrated field-scale reservoir simulation model of miscible flooding is accomplished for this purpose. The compositional simulator, Eclipse compositional, has been used to investigate the feasibility of applying different miscible CO 2 -injection modes. The process of the CO 2 -injection was optimized to start in January 2056 as an improved oil recovery method after natural depletion and waterflooding processes have been performed, and it will continue to January 2072. The minimum miscibility pressure was determined using empirical correlations as a function of reservoir crude oil composition and its properties. Four miscible CO 2 -injection modes were undertaken to investigate the reservoir performance. These modes were, namely the continuous CO 2 -injection (CCO 2), water-alternating-CO 2 -injection (CO 2 -WAG), hybrid CO 2 -WAG injection, and simultaneous water and CO 2 -injection (CO 2 -SWAG) processes. All injection modes were analyzed in respect to the <b>net</b> <b>present</b> <b>value</b> (<b>NPV)</b> and <b>net</b> <b>present</b> <b>value</b> index (NPVI) calculations to confirm the more feasible CO 2 development strategy. The results indicated that the application of CO 2 -SWAG injection mode of 2 : 1 SWAG ratio attained the highest oil recovery, NPV and NPVI, among the other modes. The achieved incremental oil recovery by this process was 9.174  %, that is 189 MM STB of the oil produced higher than the waterflooding case, 1.113  % (23 MMSTB of oil) in comparison with the CCO 2 -flooding case, 1.176  % (24.3 MMSTB of oil) in comparison with the hybrid CO 2 -WAG case and almost 0.987  % (204 MMSTB of oil) when compared with the CO 2 -WAG case. The results indicated that the application of CO 2 -WAG injection mode of 1.5 : 1 WAG ratio attained the highest oil recovery after the SWAG process.|$|R
40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Animal Sciences and IndustryRobert L. WeaberThe dynamic environments, varying {{production}} practices, {{and general}} biological uncertainty associated with bovine reproduction makes informed, strategic decision making regarding {{the implementation of}} bovine reproductive technology a great challenge for producers. One might also argue that traditionally, ET’s primary focus of genetic improvement has greatly overshadowed any consideration of short to mid-term financial gain. To accomplish the objective of creating an economic risk analysis tool for user-defined embryo transfer (ET) programs, a circumstantial, stochastic prediction model utilizing @Risk© software to generate comparable economic values as an aid in the ET decision making process has been created. More realistic than the use of means in deterministic models, distributions defining the biological uncertainty for a multitude of reproductive outcomes are estimated through extensive literature review and limited industry sources. Applying the Latin Hypercube variation of Monte Carlo simulation, a sample value from the descriptive distribution associated with each stochastic variable is included in an iteration of the simulation. Through large numbers of iterations with dynamic combinations of variables, the process culminates in a distribution of possible <b>values</b> for the <b>net</b> <b>present</b> <b>value</b> (<b>NPV),</b> annuity equivalent <b>net</b> <b>present</b> <b>value</b> (ANPV), and return on investment (ROI) associated with the model described scenario of in-vivo derived (IVD) or in-vitro produced (IVP). Finally, using the distributions of NPV, ANPV, and ROI a decision maker can assess the economic risk linked to a user-defined ET program. To further complicate matters, cattle producers are now presented with a choice between two primary methods of ET. IVD ET describes the traditional method of ET that involves follicular stimulation and insemination of a donor female followed by the collection of fertilized embryos from the uterus. IVP commonly refers to the method of generating transferable embryos by collecting oocytes by ovarian aspiration; in-vitro fertilization of the collected oocytes; and incubated maturation of the fertilized oocytes. Encompassed within the two methods of ET exist several different sub-techniques, principally regarding the exception or inclusion of follicular synchronization and/or stimulation before ovum pick-up (OPU) in IVP procedures. Ultimately, operators must decide whether ET programs, of any type, serve as an economically viable means to increase rate of genetic improvement or take advantage of marketing opportunities. Although several economic value predictors for ET programs already exist (Beltrame et al. 2010), the opportunity remains to create more applicable models for Bos taurus beef production and varying marketing avenues in the U. S. This circumstantial, stochastic simulation model can serve as an aid in the ET decision making process by generating output that allows for the financial risk and sensitivity analysis of a user-defined ET program...|$|R

The city however generates a large amount of waste on a daily basis and a large amount of this is dumped or landfilled. Landfilling of the organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW), contributes to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and circa 80 % of the OFMSW is landfilled in Abu Dhabi. However, Abu Dhabi has shown its commitment to reducing GHG emissions by aiming to generate 7 % renewable energy by 2030, improving waste management, and developing a strategy for green economy. In this study the approach evaluated is the waste-to-biogas system which utilizes anaerobic digestion of the OFMSW. Modules based on the Aikan® and REnescience® plant designs were simulated using SuperPro Designer® where energy and economic values were obtained and used for the evaluations. Excel was used to make a cash-flow analysis for both modules. A SWOT analysis was conducted to compare the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats between both modules. Energy Returned on Investment is an approach that calculates the efficiency of a fuel by dividing the energy acquired by the energy required in a process. Both modules give an energy returned on investment (EROI) ratio for biogas of slightly below 2 : 1, in regards to electricity which is considered relatively low when compared to other fuels. Three methods were used for calculating the profitability of the modules, internal rate of return, pay-back period and <b>net</b> <b>present</b> <b>value</b> (<b>NPV).</b> However the <b>net</b> <b>present</b> <b>value</b> (<b>NPV)</b> was found most reliable and showed an NPV of $ 500 000 and $ 3 000 000 for module one and two respectively and calculations show that module one has more risks while module two could result in a bigger risk monetarily. The results show that implementing such a system will have a minimal contribution to the city’s aim of 7 % renewable energy generation. However, it will contribute to the city’s target of reducing GHG emission, improve waste management, and lead to a green economy.  Abu Dhabi, huvudstaden för Förenade Arab Emiraten, är kända för deras snabba utveckling under en kort period.

We study an actual investment case in the Spanish mobile telephony industry, the entrant in the market of a new operator, Yoigo. We analyze the option to abandon in order to show the relevance of the possibility of selling the company in an oligopolistic market where competitors are not allowed free entrance. The <b>NPV</b> (<b>net</b> <b>present</b> <b>value)</b> of the new entrant is calculated as a starting point. Then, based on the general approach proposed by Copeland and Antikarov (2001), a binomial tree is used to model managerial flexibility in discrete time periods, and value the option to abandon. The strike price of the option is calculated based on incremental EBITDA margins due to selling customers or merging with a competitor...|$|E
