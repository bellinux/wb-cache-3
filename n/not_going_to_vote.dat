Oglesby transcribed a letter in response for the illiterate Hanks, stating {{that he would be}} voting for Lincoln and why. The letter was condemned by Hanks' brother Charles and the Democrats, who were suspicions that the written by someone else, some [...] "smart Republican", on Hanks' behalf. Charles stated that he thought Hanks [...] "even yet does not know what is in it, much less did he ever write it". It was decided that no more open letters by Hanks should be published, and instead Hanks took to making personal appearances in support of Lincoln on the campaign trail.|$|R

50|$|On September 29, 1939, McMillan {{died and}} Rivers {{immediately}} {{made plans to}} run for Congress. He quit his federal job in February 1940 and opened a law practice in Charleston to provide a base for his campaign. His opponent in the Democratic primary was Alfred von Kolnitz, who had {{the backing of the}} Charleston political establishment and Thomas McMillan's widow, Clara. Rivers knew that he was <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> win the <b>vote</b> in Charleston, so he tried <b>to</b> maximize his <b>vote</b> outside of Charleston by making the theme of his campaign about the chicanery of the city. Furthermore, with World War II raging in Europe, Rivers played up von Kolnitz's German name to make him appear as if a Nazi sympathizer. On August 27, Rivers won the Democratic primary election by running up a huge margin in the counties outside of Charleston, which offset his loss in Charleston County. In those days, victory in the Democratic primary was tantamount to election in South Carolina, and Rivers took office on January 3, 1941.|$|R
30|$|Political {{efficacy}} {{refers to}} the faith citizens have on their influence in the government, {{is a kind of}} feeling “feeling that political and social change is possible and that the individual citizen can play a part in bringing about this change” (et al. 1954, p. 187). In the study of political efficacy, political scholars usually divided it into two kinds of efficacy: internal efficiency and external efficacy. Internal efficacy refers to an individual’s belief on his or her knowledge and ability to influence the system (Sullivan and Riedel 2001). Such efficacy often shows the possibility of individual participating in voting or becoming political activists. The external efficacy refers to individual believing in the possibility and the extent of the government’s response to his or her demands. External efficiency relates to the extent of government concerned about the needs of individuals. Low external efficacy often performs as political apathy, meaning citizens could not recognize the government as representative of their opinions. Political efficacy may predict participation of election voting but also reflecting publics’ attitude towards government and the degree of acceptance of anti system movement (Sullivan and Riedel 2001). Voters with low political efficacy tend to support pro-reform candidates, although they are <b>not</b> necessarily <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>vote,</b> because they do not believe their actions are of significance in the political process. Individual with higher political efficacy are more likely <b>to</b> <b>vote,</b> because they believe in their influence on the government, and they tend to support the incumbent, because they think the government is able to represent them well (Sullivan and Riedel 2001). The current research indicates political efficacy will be influenced by various factors, such as political participation (Finkel 1985, 1987), political education degree (Pasek et al. 2008), the degree of contact with media (Kenski and Stroud 2006), race, health, age, gender, the degree of education and social and economic status (Schur et al. 2003; Michelson 2000; Huo 2005; Kahne and Westheimer 2002), and political socialization of young people (Easton and Dennis 1967; Hess and Torney 1967; Hahn 1998).|$|R
40|$|Unique events often {{give rise}} to other unique events. Such {{was the case of}} Hurricane Katrina—the costliest and most {{destructive}} natural disaster in U. S. history. The resulting casualties and staggering dam-age estimates from the savage storm in late August 2005, led the U. S. Senate <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> overwhelmingly (92 <b>to</b> 6) against a Senate pay raise. Most senators apparently felt that voters would not look kindly on a Senate pay raise given the devastation caused by Katrina. The Senate vote was largely symbolic because the House of Rep-resentatives was <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> take a <b>vote</b> on rescinding a pay raise for members of Congress. Thus, senators voting against the raise knew their votes would resonate well with voters but have no impact on the annual congressional pay raise sanctioned by law. Of the six senators who did vote for the pay raise, five—James Jeffords (I-Vt.), Daniel Inouye (D-Hawaii), Jeff Bingaman (D-N. M.), Richard Lugar (R-Ind.), and Kit Bond (R-Mo.) —were long-time incumbents whose seats were not threatened, and one—Paul Sarbanes (D-Md.) —was about <b>to</b> retire. Typically, <b>votes</b> cast by members of Congress are relatively easy to predict. The empirical analysis of congressional voting patterns sug-gests that measures of ideology and party affiliation play a decisive role in explaining overall voting behavior. A vote on congressional pay, however, is not typical. It creates a dilemma for lawmakers by pitting two margins of self-interest against each other: pecuniary gains and reelection. Senators are clearly made better off by not opposing an...|$|R

500|$|Alberta's women, {{especially}} those of the UFA-affiliated United Farm Women of Alberta, were active in the province's moral reform movement. [...] They were also active in seeking the vote: in 1913 a delegation of them arrived at the legislature demanding the vote; Sifton asked them [...] "did you ladies wash up your luncheon dishes before you came down here to ask me for the vote? [...] If you haven't you'd better go home because you're <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> get any <b>votes</b> from me." [...] In October 1914 another delegation arrived, bearing the signatures of 40,000 people. [...] At that time, the Premier agreed that most traditional objections to extension of the franchise were [...] "played out", but expressed concern at the increases that would result {{to the cost of}} elections and uncertainty at whether most of the province's women actually wanted suffrage. [...] In February 1915 a larger delegation arrived at the legislature and occupied the MLAs' seats, demanding that the franchise be extended quickly enough to allow women <b>to</b> <b>vote</b> in the upcoming prohibition referendum; an angry Sifton refused and suggested to the women that if they wanted the vote, they should contact their MLAs and promise that they would use their <b>votes</b> <b>to</b> re-elect them, [...] "which is after all one of the strongest way in which you can appeal to male human nature, as represented in the legislature." [...] Even so, he committed to raising the issue in the legislature after the referendum.

[...] True to his word, he introduced legislation in the spring of 1916 giving women the vote in all provincial and municipal elections.

5000|$|After Montreal {{failed to}} sustain its track cycling venue from the 1976 Summer Olympics, some Milton {{residents}} and town councillors {{have questioned the}} long-term viability of such a facility in Milton after the 2015 Pan Am Games. “There’s a lot of suppositions,” said Councillor Rick Malboeuf. “This could happen, that could happen. The business plan doesn’t make sense.” Malboeuf is convinced history will repeat itself in Milton. Communities such as Hamilton and Vaughan passed on the Pan Am velodrome, he pointed out. “They had a good reason. It’s such a highly specialized sport. Where are the regular participants and events {{going to come from}} after the games are over? Just like the other venues like Montreal, this one will sit empty.” As to his constituents, he said, “Twenty to one, they’re against it.

I just don't believe it.I think when the Constitution and the founders said no religious test shall ever be required for qualification for office or public trust in these United States that the founders meant just that. And I don't believe for a minute that Republicans, or Americans for that matter, are going to impose a religious test when the founders said it's as un-American as anything you can think of.And so I believe that I'll ultimately get the nomination. I can't be sure of that, but I'm, I'm, pretty confident. And I believe in a head-to-head with Hillary Clinton the differences in our perspectives on how to get America going again and how to get us on the right track are as different as night and day. She takes her inspiration from the Europe of old, Big Brother, big government and big taxes. I take mine from Republican ideals: small government, small taxes, individual freedom.
