40|$|AbstractSpatial {{organisation}} of {{the genome}} within the nucleus {{can play a role}} in maintaining the expressed or silent state of some genes [1]. There are distinct addresses for specific chromosomes, which have different functional characteristics, within the <b>nuclei</b> <b>of</b> dividing <b>populations</b> <b>of</b> human cells [2]. Here, we demonstrate that this level of nuclear architecture is altered in cells that have become either quiescent or senescent. Upon cell cycle exit, a gene-poor human chromosome moves from a location at the nuclear periphery to a more internal site in the nucleus, and changes its associations with nuclear substructures. The chromosome moves back toward the edge <b>of</b> the <b>nucleus</b> at a distinctive time after re-entry into the cell cycle. There is a 2 – 4 hour period at the beginning of G 1 when the spatial organisation of these human chromosomes is established. Lastly, these experiments provide evidence that temporal control of DNA replication can be independent of spatial chromosome organisation. We conclude that the sub-nuclear organisation of chromosomes in quiescent or senescent mammalian somatic cells is fundamentally different from that in proliferating cells and that the spatial organisation {{of the genome}} is plastic...|$|R

To give {{biological}} {{assessment of}} the commercial stock of tulka Clupeonella cultriventris (Nordmann, 1840) of the Dnieper-Bug estuary system in {{the conditions of the}} reduced Dnieper flow. Methodology. Analysis of the biological state of the tulka stock of the Dnieper-Bug estuary system was performed based on the data on the dynamics of its age structure, linear-weight growth and condition factor.

40|$|The Escherichia coli mazEF module {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{thoroughly}} studied toxin-antitoxin systems. mazF encodes a stable toxin, MazF, and mazE encodes a labile antitoxin, MazE, which prevents the lethal effect of MazF. MazF is an endoribonuclease that leads to the inhibition of protein synthesis by cleaving mRNAs at ACA sequences. Here, using 2 D-gels, we show that in E. coli, although MazF induction leads to the inhibition of the synthesis of most proteins, the synthesis of an exclusive group of proteins, mostly smaller than about 20 kDa, is still permitted. We identified some of those small proteins by mass spectrometry. By deleting the genes encoding those proteins from the E. coli chromosome, we showed that they were required for the death of most <b>of</b> the cellular <b>population.</b> Under the same experimental conditions, which induce mazEF-mediated cell death, other such proteins were found to be required for the survival of a small sub-population of cells.

40|$|AbstractOvarian {{germ cell}} {{survival}} {{is dependent upon}} the formation of primordial follicles, which occurs during fetal life in the human. Activin contributes to germ cell proliferation and survival at this time. SMADs 2 and 3 are central elements in the activin signalling pathway and thus indicate sites of activin action. We have investigated the expression and localisation of SMADs 2 and 3 in the fetal ovary between 14 and 20  weeks gestation, i. e. preceding and during primordial follicle formation. SMAD 3 mRNA expression increased 1. 9 fold (P= 0. 02). SMAD 2 and 3 proteins were localised by immunofluorescence to the <b>nuclei</b> <b>of</b> three distinct <b>populations</b> <b>of</b> somatic cells: (a) stromal cells between clusters of germ cells; (b) some somatic cells intermingled with activin βA-expressing germ cells; (c) pre-granulosa cells surrounding primordial follicles. Germ cells did not express SMAD 2 or 3. Activin A increased and follistatin decreased phosphorylation of SMAD 2 / 3 in vitro, and activin increased SMAD 2 and decreased KITLG mRNA expression. It therefore appears that somatic cells are the targets for activin signalling in the developing ovary. The effects of activin on germ cells are indirect and include mediation by the kit ligand/c-Kit pathway, rather than being an autocrine germ cell effect...|$|R

We show with a set of experimental case studies that this theory explains disparate quantitative results from classical and modern experimental and computational research on heteroplasmy variance in different species. We demonstrate that our general model provides a host of specific insights, including a modification of the often-used but hard-to-interpret Wright formula to correspond directly to biological observables, the ability to quantify selective and mutational pressure in mtDNA <b>populations,</b> and characterization <b>of</b> the pronounced variability inevitably arising from the action of possible mtDNA quality-control mechanisms.
