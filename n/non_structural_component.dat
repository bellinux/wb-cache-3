40|$|The {{earthquake}} {{can cause}} serious problems to the functional reliability and continuity of supply of electrical power systems. The paper discusses {{the need to}} study the requirements for the design and installation of electrical power systems in buildings subject to seismic hazard. Therefore, {{it is necessary to}} recommend mechanical and electrical criteria for the design and the installation, to be graduated according to building occupancy categories (as hospitals, strategic buildings). At least three levels of performances are definable for equipment: -the resistance to the seismic stress, - the guarantee of duty after the earthquake, - the guarantee of duty during and after the earthquake. Basically, the criteria relative to the installation of the electrical equipment are an appropriate extension of those general static ones for <b>non</b> <b>structural</b> <b>components.</b> Their consideration is essential for the settlement of the design criteria, which, as far as the configuration {{and the size of the}} electrical power system are concerned, aim at limiting the same installation problems. A special power distribution, "brush-distribution", is suitable for the strategic buildings whit higher risk for seismic event This distribution suggests locating, as much as possible, in ground or underground floors the most heavy equipments (transformers, generator sets, motors, panel boards). The electrical loads of building upper floors (inclusive lighting and appliances) has to be subdivided in areas not horizontally in the same level of each floor, but in vertical sectors of the whole building, as "towers". Other general design criteria, aimed as a guarantee for the supply continuity, the system reliability and the system protection, have a particular use in these appliances. The paper deals comparing the brush distribution on the basis of the recommendations for the <b>non</b> <b>structural</b> <b>components</b> issued by the National Earthquake Hazard Reduction Program (NEHRP) (edition 2000) ...|$|R

Some hospitals were evacuated after the Ml= 5. 8 May 20 seismic event due to damage to <b>non</b> <b>structural</b> <b>components</b> and minor <b>structural</b> damage. A short description of the damage suffered and characteristics of the healthcare system as a whole is offered initially, followed by {{a detailed description of the}} effects which took place at the Santa Maria Bianca hospital of Mirandola. The focus has been on damage to <b>non</b> <b>structural</b> elements and content, whose integrity is of primary importance for healthcare structures performance during and after a seismic event. Some instruments for the acquisition of accelerometric data were installed after the May 20 event both outside and inside a building which is part of the hospital complex. The seismic behavior of this building has also been analysed by means of a purposely made finite element model and on the basis of the recorded data.

40|$|The {{earthquake}} causes {{serious problems}} to the functional reliability and continuity of supply of electrical power systems particularly in exposed and sensitive structures as hospitals and strategic buildings. The paper discusses {{the need to}} study the requirements for the design and installation of electrical power systems in buildings subject to seismic hazard. Mechanical and electrical criteria for the design and the installation are recommended to be graduated according to building occupancy categories (as hospitals, strategic buildings). At least three levels of performance are identified for equipment. An important goal is to coordinate the <b>non</b> <b>structural</b> designing criteria with a layout of the system architecture that avoids or confines as possible intrinsically in a "duty-free" zone the seismic exposition and limits the same installation problems. A special power distribution, "brush- distribution", has a laid structure suitably for the strategic buildings that {{are at risk for}} seismic event. Other general design criteria, such as a guarantee for the supply continuity, the system reliability and the system protection, have a special use in these appliances.

40|$|Non-structural {{components}} in most types of commercial building represent {{a major portion}} of the total cost of the building and, as such, will represent {{a large portion of the}} potential losses to owners, occupants, and insurance companies. <b>Non</b> <b>structural</b> <b>components</b> may be classified in three broad categories: architectural components, mechanical and electrical equipment, and contents. Non-structural components play a fundamental role about safety of human lives during seismic events: in fact the collapse of suspended light fixtures, hung ceilings or partition walls; the plunging onto the ground of failed cladding panels, parapets, signboards, ornaments, or glass panels; the overturning of heavy equipment, book-shelves, storage racks, or pieces of furniture; and the rupture of pipes or containers with toxic materials are all capable of causing serious injury or death. In this work seismic performance of suspended ceiling systems has been analyzed by plotting fragility curves obtained through real scale tests. In particular seismic assessment of suspended ceiling systems is carried out by performing shake table tests: in fact being ceilings elements not amenable to structural analysis, full-scale testing is the only feasible possibility to develop fragility curves. In particular single and double frame ceilings are tested on simulator platform (a 3 m × 3 m square table and two orthogonal horizontal degree of freedom system). The input to the table is provided through artificial time histories accelerations representative of expected/target ground motion and acting simultaneously along the two orthogonal directions of the platform simulator; these time histories are selected with the aim of matching the target or required response spectrum of <b>non</b> <b>structural</b> <b>components.</b> Three limit states are used in this study to characterize the seismic response of suspended ceiling systems, both single frame and double frame, and in particular: occupancy limit state (10 % damage), damage limit state (30 % damage) and safety limit state (50 % damage). From the first to the third one limit state considered, the damage in the ceiling increases: in fact when performing a damage analysis with fragility curves, the response is characterized as function of a damage state. Limit states are considered to be reached starting from visual detection of post-test condition of the specimen; indeed, at the end of shaking of each step in a test cycle, research team investigates accurately the physical conditions of components of ceilings in order to identify which limit state has been reached...|$|R

Each is formed by an organic carrier surface-coated with a binder and metallic powder. The surfaces {{to be connected}} are moistened locally or over the entire area, using a solvent. They are brought into contact under applied pressure. Heat treatment drives off the hydrocarbon compounds and completes bonding by sintering, joining the components and forming a supportive structure DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The solvent is water and/or an organic liquid. The metallic powder is in suspended form, in a solvent. Pressure forces are applied using an elastic organic carrier material {{of at least one}} <b>structural</b> <b>component.</b> The <b>structural</b> <b>components</b> connected, have open- and closed-pore structures. At least one <b>structural</b> <b>component</b> {{in the form of an}} elastic, deformable carrier, is caused to match the surface configuration of the other <b>structural</b> <b>component</b> during formation of the materially-bonded connection between the <b>structural</b> <b>components.</b> A <b>structural</b> <b>component</b> formed by organic, thread-like connected elements is used for bonding. <b>Structural</b> <b>components</b> made from differing metals are bonded. The joint region forms an alloy, intermetallic phase and/or mixed crystals. Locally, porosity and/or pore size differ. Locally the structure has open- or closed cells.
