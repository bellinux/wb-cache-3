50|$|Nationale-Nederlanden {{was formed}} in a merger in 1963 between the De Nederlanden van 1845 (Non-life {{insurance}} Company The Netherlands) and the <b>Nationale</b> <b>Levensverzekeringsbank</b> (National Life Insurance Bank). The result of the merger, because of the strong domestic position of Nationale and the international experience of De Nederlanden, was to set the company up for the future. Emerging computerisation was embraced, and other innovation costs were jointly borne by the combined companies. Cooperation strengthened the companiesâ€™ experience in group insurance and allowed Nnationale-Nederlanden to expand its territory. In 1991 NN merged, this time, with the NMB Postbank Groep, to form the ING Group. Aside from insurance and asset management, the company also offers some banking products such as mortgages.|$|E
