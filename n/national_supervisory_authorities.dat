50|$|The process, which {{resulted}} in the 2004 version of the EU Transparency Directive, passed several years, consultations and revisions.The first step towards the EU Transparency Directive of 2004 took place in July 2001 when the Commission of the European Union announced the first consultation regarding the transparency on publicly traded companies. This first consultation period lasted from 17 July 2001 until 30 September 2001. During that time interested parties were able to contribute comments on the proposals, which the Commission drafted in its own consultation paper, regarding the new regime on disclosure requirements. Interested parties could be the issuers themselves, national agencies and associations, state authorities and European authorities, such as CESR. The consultation paper of the Commission suggested a division of disclosure duties, in periodic and ongoing obligations, for example for financial reports (periodical) and ad hoc notifications (ongoing), and a focus on the publications of those information through a medium on a Europe-wide basis as well as the control of these duties by the <b>national</b> <b>supervisory</b> <b>authorities.</b> Until the end of the consultation period the Commission received 90 contributions from market participants all over Europe, whereas most of the answers came from British and German interest groups.

Sale of nicotine cartridges is currently prohibited, as nicotine is considered a prescription drug requiring an authorization that such cartridges do not yet have. However, the Finnish authorities have decided that nicotine cartridges containing less than 10 mg nicotine, and e-liquid containing less than 0.42 g nicotine per bottle, may be legally brought in from other countries for private use. If the nicotine content is higher, a prescription from a Finnish physician is required. From a country within the European Economic Area a maximum of one year's supply may be brought in for private use when returning to Finland, while three months' supply may be brought in from outside the EEA.

40|$|This article {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} selected competencies of the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA), namely the power to resolve disputes between <b>national</b> <b>supervisory</b> <b>authorities</b> i n the framework of a binding mediation and to issue non-binding guidelines, and the impact which exercising those powers by the EIOPA has on the competences of the Polish Financial Supervision Authority (KNF), a public authority responsible for {{the supervision of the}} Polish ﬁ nancial market. In the ﬁ rst part of the article the powers of the EIOPA to resolve disputes in a binding mediation process are described, and the limited possibilities that the EIOPA has to initiate this procedure are emphasized, since as a consequence of that the current mediation procedure encourages <b>national</b> <b>supervisory</b> <b>authorities</b> to resolve their disputes themselves. Next the principles of taking decisions by the EIOPA Board of Supervisors in the mediation process are described and attention is drawn to the discriminatory nature of those rules where the dispute relates to decisions of the group supervisor. The article also highlights potential consequences of decisions taken by the EIOPA within the binding mediation and their impact on administrative decisions taken by <b>national</b> <b>supervisory</b> <b>authorities.</b> The second part of the article provides an analysis of EIOPA’s powers to issue guidelines. The non-binding nature of the guidelines, which are described as soft law, has been reviewed. It is pointed that the European Union law provides for certain mechanisms which enable the EIOPA to enforce implementation of the guidelines by national competent authorities. As a next step, EIOPA guidelines on preparing for the implementation of Solvency II and the powers of the KNF to apply those guidelines have been reviewed. In addition to that, justiﬁ cation for vesting the KNF with the power to issue recommendations or guidelines addressed to insurance and reinsurance undertakings, in the context of analogous competences possessed by the EIOPA have been discussed. 191251525 Studia Prawa Publiczneg...|$|E

5000|$|According to law {{approval}} for an abortion requires {{the signature of}} at least one physician (and in some cases two), and in some cases additional permission from Valvira (the <b>National</b> <b>Supervisory</b> <b>Authority</b> for Welfare and Health). The period of the pregnancy also affects the granting of permission. The key periods are 0-12 weeks, 13-20 weeks, and over 20 weeks. One doctor's signature is enough in the case of terminations 0-12 weeks when the applicant is under 17 years old or has passed her 40th birthday, or if the applicant has already given birth to 4 or more children regardless of age. Otherwise two doctors' signatures are required. Reasons for approval are the potential physical or mental distress if the pregnancy runs to term; or if the pregnancy arises from a serious crime (e.g. rape or incest) or if an illness of either parent would make it difficult to provide a normal upbringing for the child. Reference to Valvira for review and decision is needed in all cases between 13-20 weeks; or when there are grounds that the fetus is abnormal (in which case the 20 weeks is extended to 24 weeks); or in any case where the doctor has given a negative decision. Above 20 weeks, a threat to the physical life of the mother is the only valid reason for terminating a pregnancy.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{analyzes}} the EU {{experience with the}} cross-border banking failures during the crisis and evaluates the post-crisis reform proposals {{in the light of}} this experience. It shows that the Commission considered substantive reforms that would shift the cross-border bank resolution regime to the EU level to match the operational presence of pan-European banks. However, the political compromises on the European System of Financial Supervisors in the Council, led the Commission to withdraw from more ambitious proposals in favor of gradual improvements of the pre-crisis status quo. The reformed structures are still too complex to be functional in real-time under the pressure of a financial crisis and they leave too many crucial issues such as sharing of information and of fiscal burdens in the domain of non-binding soft law agreements yet to be prepared by supervisory colleges. The new framework does not change the exclusively <b>national</b> accountability of <b>supervisory</b> <b>authorities,</b> thus the new regime is unlikely to prevent non-cooperative resolution strategies. The first round of post-crisis regulatory reforms brings in more Europe to the cross-border bank resolution regime, but just barely so...|$|R

40|$|The {{divergence}} between increasingly supranational financial markets {{on the one}} hand and still largely <b>national</b> <b>supervisory</b> structures on the other gives rise to tensions which reduce the effectiveness of the supervision. It lies in the interests of both the public and the private sector that the supervisory structures are commensurate with the risks in a global capital market. An extension of the framework of common minimum standards (at a high level!) and joint definitions and data standards are just as essential as an intensification of cooperation among the <b>supervisory</b> <b>authorities.</b> Self-regulation, market discipline and the inclusion of the financial industry in the shaping of the rules should be obvious elements of a modern supervisory regime. Banks which operate internationally see themselves caught between national regulation and cross-border activity every day. The combination of different sets of rules and <b>supervisory</b> <b>authorities</b> is a major cost factor and hinders the integration of the markets. The co-existence of national authorities operating in parallel risks violates the principle of competitive neutrality of supervision in a single market. This certainly applies in the EU, where not only internationalisation, but supranationalisation of supervision is called for. [...] ...|$|R

The proposal also aims at paying close attention to the economics of public administration and international relations in allocating competences among <b>national</b> and supranational <b>supervisory</b> bodies. Before detailing the own proposition, this paper looks into the relationship between sovereign debt and banking crises that drive regulatory reactions to the financial turmoil in the Euro area. These initiatives inter alia affirm effective prudential supervision as a pivotal element of crisis prevention. In order to arrive at a more informed idea, which determinants apart from a perceived appetite for regulatory arbitrage drive banks 2 ̆ 019 organizational choices, this paper scrutinizes the merits of either a branch or subsidiary structure for the cross-border business of financial institutions. In doing so, it also considers the policy-makers perspective. The analysis shows that no one size fits all organizational structure is available and concludes that banks 2 ̆ 019 choices should generally not be second-guessed, particularly because they are subject to (some) market discipline. The analysis proceeds with describing and evaluating how competences in prudential supervision are currently allocated among <b>national</b> and supranational <b>supervisory</b> <b>authorities.</b> In order to assess the findings the appraisal adopts insights form the economics of public administration and international relations.
