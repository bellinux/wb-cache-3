The contrasting results observed in vitro and in vivo, together with the observed low encapsulation capacity for cyclopentolate of the vesicle formulations, led the authors to formulate the provisional hypothesis that <b>non-ionic</b> <b>surfactant</b> vesicles may promote absorption of cyclopentolate by preferentially modifying the permeability characteristics of the conjunctival and scleral membranes...|$|E
40|$|We are {{grateful}} to Pierre Lanteri and Yohann Clement for their help with the statistical analyses. We {{would also like to}} thank Helene Wong and Jose Serrano for their collaboration to this project. International audienceThe skin toxicity of four ionic <b>surfactants</b> and fourteen <b>non-ionic</b> <b>surfactants</b> was investigated so as to disclose structure/toxicity relationships. The skin toxicity was assessed by means of four in vitro assays, MU and LDH test of cell viability, and detection of the inflammation markers IL- 1 alpha. and IL- 8. Several descriptors of the physicochemical properties of the surfactants were measured in order to find out those molecular descriptors that correlate with the toxicity measured on skin. Principal component analysis and analysis of the matrix of Pearson's correlation coefficients were used for the search of the molecular descriptors having the highest relevance. There was a definite difference between ionic and <b>non-ionic</b> <b>surfactants.</b> Ionic surfactants are the most toxic if they are soluble in water. Crystalline ionic surfactants of low solubility show low toxicity. The sign of the charge, anionic or cationic, does not matter. The value of the CMC that has been put forward as a highly relevant parameter does not account for the full skin toxicities observed; the CMC of <b>non-ionic</b> <b>surfactants</b> is not a parameter of relevance. For <b>non-ionic</b> <b>surfactants,</b> the nature of the chemical bond linking the polar head group and the alkyl chain has a significant impact on skin toxicity; PEG ethers appear more toxic than PEG esters. The results revealed the mildness of polyoxyethylene sorbitan esters whatever be their alkyl chain length. On the other hand, for sucrose ester surfactants, C 12 alkyl length resulted in the greatest skin toxicity. Since the molecular parameters of ionic, non-ionic, water-soluble and crystalline surfactants are different, a universal parameter was introduced, the order parameter describing the orientation ordering of surfactant molecules at interfaces. The highly ordered organization of crystalline surfactants associated with their low solubility in water makes them very low-irritant surfactants...|$|R

The thin layer evaporation method followed by sonication was used to prepare small <b>non-ionic</b> <b>surfactant</b> vesicles containing beclomethasone dipropionate.

The colloidal and storage stability were evaluated by Turbiscan Lab (R) Expert, which evidenced the good stability of BDP-loaded <b>non-ionic</b> <b>surfactant</b> vesicles, thus showing no significant variations of mean size and no colloidal phase segregation. Primary human lung fibroblast (HLF) cells were used for in vitro investigation of vesicle tolerability, carrier-cell interaction, intracellular drug uptake and drug-loaded vesicle anti-inflammatory activity. The investigated NSVs did not show a significant cytotoxic activity at all incubation times for concentrations ranging from 0. 01 to 1 mu M. Confocal laser scanning microscopy showed vesicular carrier localization at the level of the cytoplasm compartment, where the glucocorticoid receptor (target site) is localized. BDP-loaded <b>non-ionic</b> <b>surfactant</b> vesicles elicited a significant improvement of the HLF intracellular uptake of the drug with respect to the free drug solution, drug/surfactant mixtures and empty vesicles used as references. The treatment of HLF cells with BDP-loaded <b>non-ionic</b> <b>surfactant</b> vesicles determined a noticeable increase of the drug anti-inflammatory activity by reducing the secretion of both constitutive and interleukin- 1 beta-stimulated nerve growth factor (as inflammatory index) of 68 % and 85 %, respectively.
