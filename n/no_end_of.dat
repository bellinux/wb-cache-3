While the French colonists—most of whom were farmers who {{seasonally}} engaged in fur trade—had always been relatively few, there seemed to be <b>no</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> settlers in the British colonies, who wanted to clear the land of trees and occupy it. Shawnees and Delawares in the Ohio Country had been displaced by British colonists in the east, and this motivated their involvement in the war. On the other hand, Native Americans in the Great Lakes region and the Illinois Country had not been greatly affected by white settlement, although they were aware of the experiences of tribes in the east. Historian Gregory Dowd argues that most Native Americans involved in Pontiac's Rebellion were not immediately threatened with displacement by white settlers, and that historians have therefore overemphasized British colonial expansion as a cause of the war. Dowd believes that the presence, attitude, and policies of the British Army, which the Native Americans found threatening and insulting, were more important factors.|$|E

Now his only real concern is getting a new body, but Lady Samsin knows what he wants is impossible and should just get married.

The king abducts Charon, who realized his plan to acquire a new body, and changes him into a form of a nine-tailed fox. He then holds a hunting competition for catching Charon in his fox form, then soon loses conscience as he has not married and reincarnated for too long.|$|E

It is not a writ whereby convicts may attack or relitigate just any judgment on a criminal charge merely because the unfortunate person may become displeased with his confinement or with any other result of the judgment under attack.|$|E

25|$|In sharp contrast, Congress and the American {{states had}} <b>no</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> {{difficulty}} financing the war. In 1775, {{there was at}} most 12 million dollars in gold in the colonies, not nearly enough to cover current transactions, let alone finance a major war. The British made the situation much worse by imposing a tight blockade on every American port, which cut off almost all imports and exports. One partial solution was to rely on volunteer support from militiamen and donations from patriotic citizens. Another was to delay actual payments, pay soldiers and suppliers in depreciated currency, and promise {{that it would be}} made good after the war. Indeed, the soldiers and officers were given land grants in 1783 to cover the wages that they had earned but had not been paid during the war. Not until 1781 did the national government have a strong leader in financial matters, when Robert Morris was named Superintendent of Finance of the United States.|$|E
