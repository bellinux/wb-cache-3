40|$|We {{examine the}} effect of <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> on interstate conflict. Using more {{appropriate}} methodologies than have previously been used, we find that dyads in which both states possess <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> are not significantly less likely to fight wars, nor are they significantly more or less belligerent at low levels of conflict. This stands in contrast to previous work, which suggests nuclear dyads are some 2. 7 million times less likely to fight wars. We additionally find that dyads in which one state possesses <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> are more prone to low-level conflict (but not more prone to war). This appears to be because nuclear-armed states expand their inter-ests after nuclear acquisition rather than because <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> provide a shield behind which states can aggress against more powerful conventional-armed states.

50|$|In {{the wake}} of the {{full-scale}} tests and signing of the test ban treaty, the Air Force Weapons Laboratory (AFWL) was created from elements of the Special Weapons Center. The AFWL was responsible for researching <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> and the vulnerability of U.S. <b>weapons</b> systems to <b>nuclear</b> attack. Because atmospheric testing had been prohibited in 1963, weapons vulnerability testing now focused on <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> effects simulations. AFWL’s original mission was to explore the military uses of <b>nuclear</b> power, <b>weapons,</b> andsupport equipment, and to reduce the vulnerability of U.S. systems to <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> effects. This involved studying <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> effects through testing, ensuring the compatibility of <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> with USAF delivery systems, providing advanced <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> delivery techniques, and investigating nuclear power concepts.|$|R

5|$|Although {{all of its}} {{components}} had been tested, no full test of a gun-type <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapon</b> occurred before the Little Boy was dropped over Hiroshima. The only test explosion of a <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapon</b> concept had been of an implosion-type device employing plutonium as its fissile material, and took place on 16 July 1945 at the Trinity nuclear test. There were several reasons for not testing a Little Boy type of device. Primarily, there was little uranium-235 {{as compared with the}} relatively large amount of plutonium which, it was expected, could be produced by the Hanford Site reactors. Additionally, the weapon design was simple enough that it was only deemed necessary to do laboratory tests with the gun-type assembly. Unlike the implosion design, which required sophisticated coordination of shaped explosive charges, the gun-type design was considered almost certain to work.|$|E
