5|$|In {{many cases}} {{constant}} supervision is required because, for various reasons, such as changes in manufacturing processes, products that once were kosher may {{cease to be}} so. For example, a kosher lubricating oil may be replaced by one containing tallow, which many rabbinic authorities view as non-kosher. Such changes are often co-ordinated with the supervising rabbi, or supervising organisation, to ensure that new packaging does not suggest any hechsher or kashrut. In some cases, however, existing stocks of pre-printed labels with the hechsher may continue to be used on the now non-kosher product. An active grapevine among the Jewish community discusses which products are now questionable, as well as products which have become kosher but whose labels have yet to carry the hechsher. Some <b>newspapers</b> <b>and</b> <b>periodicals</b> also discuss kashrut products.|$|E
