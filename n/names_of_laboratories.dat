50|$|In 1970 the lab was {{required}} to leave its quarters at 43rd St. Cooper and Provasoli went to Yale University, but Hutner preferred to remain in New York and moved {{his part of the}} lab to Pace University in Lower Manhattan, where he became a professor. At Yale, Cooper developed an institute for the study of speech and linguistics which remains today under the <b>name</b> <b>of</b> Haskins <b>Laboratory.</b> In New York, Hutner's component, focussed on microbiological research, has become a department of Pace University and is named Haskins Laboratories, but the two similarly named laboratories no longer have formal ties. At Pace the lab became a center for metabolic studies of protistan parasites, as well as studies of behavioral ecology and sensory physiology of free-living protists. Under the leadership of Hutner's student, Cyrus Bacchi, the former led to development of the antiparasitic drug eflornithine (alpha-difluoromethylornithine), widely used today against African sleeping sickness (trypanosomiasis). Work on antiparasitic drugs continues today under the direction of Nigel Yarlett.|$|R
50|$|On 25 September 2015 the Task Force on Excessive Lead in Drinking Water {{set up by}} the {{government}} released a preliminary finding that solder joints were the cause of the lead contamination, as previously asserted by the Water Supplies Department.

Elemental analysis of solder from Kai Ching Estate found it comprises up to 41 per cent lead, or 585 times the British Standard of 0.07 per cent. Helena Wong revealed in early November that Chief Secretary Carrie Lam and a Health Department official had separately asked Wong in July, shortly after she made her revelations, for the <b>name</b> <b>of</b> the <b>laboratory</b> that conducted the tests. Wong herself refused to identify the laboratory she mandated, and added that laboratories had received queries from {{the government}}, leading to fears that the government was attempting end the affair by putting pressure on laboratories not to perform any further tests.|$|R
