An American making a corner in wheat is absorbed and no doubt happy, yet he is an enemy of mankind, for his activity is destructive. We should seek to give our minds to creation, to activities good for others {{as well as for}} ourselves, to simplicity, pride in work, and forgetfulness of self in every walk of life. We should do things for the sheer pleasure of doing them, and not for what they may or may <b>not</b> be <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> us in, and be taught always to give our whole minds to it; in this way only will the edge of our appetite for existence remain as keen as a razor which is stropped every morning by one who knows how. On the negative side we should be brought up to be kind, to be clean, to be moderate, and to love good music, exercise, and fresh air." ...|$|R

You're just coming to stop with me for a bit till you see your way, and I'm <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have you <b>bring</b> things in here.

50|$|In {{the sixth}} match El Mesías took on TNA wrestler A.J. Styles {{in an attempt}} to earn a shot at the AAA Mega Championship. Towards the end of the match, Styles set up for his {{finishing}} maneuver, Styles Clash, but El Mesías got out of it and hit a spear. Styles then came back with a Pelé, but when he went for the Superman, El Mesías blocked it with his knees. After a double knee backbreaker and a Mesías Splash, El Mesías scored the three count to become the number one contender to the title held by Jeff Jarrett. After the match, Dorian Roldán and Konnan appeared and informed the exhausted El Mesías that he had been booked in another match, which led to TNA wrestler Rob Terry making his entrance to start the match. With help from a steel chair, Terry dominated the match early on, but eventually El Mesías managed to turn the tables and sent Terry onto a steel chair placed in the corner. This was followed by El Mesías pinning Terry with a schoolboy for his second victory of the night. After the match, Terry attacked El Mesías, but was quickly taken down by Dark Cuervo and Dark Ozz, who made their return from a tour of All Japan Pro Wrestling (AJPW). However, Cuervo and Ozz were then themselves overpowered by DAngelo Dinero and Gunner, which led to El Vampiro Canadiense making his first AAA appearance in a year and chasing them out of the ring. Vampiro took the house microphone and proclaimed his hate for Konnan and his loyalty to AAA, while also apologizing to Joaquín Roldán for his past behaviour. Roldan made an appearance to accept the apology and welcome Vampiro back to the promotion. The segment ended with El Mesías announcing that he whether Jarrett liked it or <b>not,</b> he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> the AAA Mega Championship back to Mexico sooner or later.|$|R

5000|$|The U.S. {{abandonment}} of the 1991 revolution was cited by many analysts as {{an explanation for the}} fact that the skeptical Iraqi Shia population did not welcome the U.S.-led coalition forces during the 2003 invasion of Iraq the way some officials of George W. Bush administration had predicted before the war began, remaining reluctant to rise up against Saddam until Baghdad fell. In 2011, the U.S. ambassador to Iraq, James F. Jeffrey, officially apologized to Iraqi politicians and southern tribal leaders for the U.S. inaction in 1991. Adel Abdul Mahdi, a top Iraqi Shia political leader, commented: [...] "At the least, from what we are facing now, this would have been a much better solution than the solution of 2003. The role of Iraq’s people would have been fundamental, not like in 2003."

5000|$|After {{a chance}} meeting between Daniel Barenboim and Edward Said in a London hotel lobby in 1992, an {{intellectual}} exchange about music, literature, {{society and the}} Middle Eastern conflict {{as well as a}} deep personal friendship ensued until Edward Said's untimely death in 2003. The spirit of this extraordinary relationship was captured in their joint publication Parallels and Paradoxes. This exchange gave rise to the idea of creating an orchestra in which musicians from Israel, Palestine, the Middle East and North Africa would play music together - harmonize in music - and thus create a foundation for discussion with the possibility of mutual understanding. Barenboim has spoken of the ensemble as follows:"The Divan is not a love story, and it is not a peace story. It has very flatteringly been described as a project for peace. It isn't.

5000|$|The main feud {{heading into}} WrestleMania on the SmackDown brand was between John [...] "Bradshaw" [...] Layfield and John Cena, {{with the two}} battling over the WWE Championship. At No Way Out, Cena {{defeated}} Kurt Angle to earn {{a spot in the}} SmackDown main event at WrestleMania. During the latter event, JBL successfully defended the WWE title against The Big Show in a Barbed Wire Steel Cage Match. As a result of Cena's win, he began a feud with John [...] "Bradshaw" [...] Layfield and his Cabinet. On the February 25 edition of SmackDown, Cena and The Big Show defeated JBL and Orlando Jordan. The following week, JBL cut a promo on Cena, and insulted him, while Cena defended his United States title against Jordan. Jordan won the match after the Basham Brothers distracted the referee, and JBL hit Cena with the WWE Championship belt. They then blew up Cena's customized design of the United States Championship, and replaced it with the original one. Later that night, Cena brought a steel lead pipe to the ring with him and ordered JBL to come out to the ring and fight him, only to have the SmackDown General Manager, Theodore Long make his way to the ring and inform Cena that he had to wait until WrestleMania to get his hands on JBL. Cena then gave the ultimatum for Long {{to be part of a}} solution or part of the problem. Cena then stated [...] "Since you're <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> JBL out here, then you're part of the problem." [...] Cena then nailed Teddy Long with an FU and was thrown out of the arena. During JBL's match that night, Cena returned and attacked The Cabinet. The next week, Long announced that if Cena laid a hand on JBL, apart from in matches, he would lose his WrestleMania match. In a Six-Man Tag Team match that night, John Cena and the WWE Tag Team Champions, Eddie Guerrero and Rey Mysterio defeated JBL and the Basham Brothers, but Cena had to stop himself from attacking JBL after the bell had rung. On a later edition of SmackDown!, Long clarified that if JBL physically provoked Cena, then Cena could retaliate. Cena then attempted to provoke JBL, by vandalising his limousine, and spray painting [...] "FU" [...] on JBL's shirt. On the last SmackDown! before WrestleMania, however, JBL interrupted Cena's match against Carlito and had Cena arrested for vandalism and, once Cena was handcuffed, JBL nailed him with a low blow and ended the show by leaving Cena laying defenseless.|$|E
