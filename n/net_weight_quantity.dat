40|$|Abstract — <b>Net</b> <b>weighting</b> {{is a key}} {{technique}} in timing driven placement (TDP), which {{plays a crucial role}} for deep submiron VLSI physical synthesis and timing closure. A popular way to assign <b>net</b> <b>weight</b> is based on its slack, such that the worst negative slack (WNS) of the entire circuit may be minimized. While WNS is an important optimization metric, another figure of merit (FOM), defined as the total slack difference compared to a certain slack threshold for all timing end points, is of equivalent importance to measure the overall timing closure result for highly complex modern ASIC and microprocessor designs. Moreover, to optimally assign <b>net</b> <b>weight</b> for timing closure, the effect of <b>net</b> <b>weighting</b> on timing should be carefully studied. In this paper, we perform a comprehensive analysis of the wire length, slack and FOM sensitivities to the <b>net</b> <b>weight,</b> and propose a new <b>net</b> <b>weighting</b> scheme based on those sensitivities. Such sensitivity analysis implicitly takes potential physical synthesis effect into consideration.

40|$|<b>Net</b> <b>weighting</b> for timing-driven {{placement}} {{has been}} very popular in industry and academia. It has various advantages such as low complexity, high flexibility and ease of implementation. Existing <b>net</b> <b>weighting</b> algorithms, however, are often ad-hoc. There is generally no known good <b>net</b> <b>weighting</b> algorithms. In this paper, we present a novel <b>net</b> <b>weighting</b> algorithm based {{on the concept of}} path-counting, and apply it in timing-driven FPGA placement application. Theoretically this is the first ever known accurate, all-path counting algorithm. Experimental data shows that compared with the weighting algorithm used in state-of-the-art FPGA placement package VPR[1], this new algorithm can achieve the longest path delay reduction of up to 38. 8 %, 15. 6 % on average with no runtime overhead and only a 4. 1 % increase in total wirelength. ...|$|R

40|$|In this study, we {{investigated}} {{the effects of}} precooling and not precooling lettuce types Lital and Yedikule to + 2 and + 4 °C and fresh bean types Aysekadin and Rodop to + 8 °C in a vacuum cooler on the <b>weight</b> loss and <b>net</b> <b>weight</b> of the products {{at the end of}} storage. No statistical difference in poststorage weight loss was found between vacuum precooling treatments in the lettuce trials; however, there was a significant (p< 0. 01) effect of vacuum precooling on poststorage weight loss in beans. Packaging of precooled products affected weight loss of lettuces and beans (p< 0. 01) and (p< 0. 05) significance, respectively. The weight loss in packaged products {{at the end of the}} vacuum cooling process was 1. 82 and 0. 74 % in lettuces and beans, respectively, whereas in unpackaged products it was 5. 05 and 2. 41 %. Plant types and packages affected the <b>net</b> <b>weight</b> of lettuces significance (p< 0. 01). Lital was the best product type with 42. 34 % <b>net</b> <b>weight</b> and packaging products was the best method with 44. 95 % <b>net</b> <b>weight.</b> No change in <b>net</b> <b>weight</b> was observed in the beans because there was no spoilage after storage...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{rigorous}} framework that defines {{a class of}} <b>net</b> <b>weighting</b> schemes in which unconstrained minimization is successively performed on a weighted objective. We show that, provided certain goals are met in the unconstrained minimization, these <b>net</b> <b>weighting</b> schemes are guaranteed to converge to the optimal solution of the original timing-constrained placement problem. These are the first results that provide conditions under which a <b>net</b> <b>weighting</b> scheme will converge to a timing optimal placement. We then identify several weighting schemes that satisfy the given convergence properties and implement them, with promising results: a modification of the weighting scheme given in [11]results in consistently improved delay over the original, 4 % on average, without increase in computation time...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} sequential retiming with delay budgeting and interconnect lengths prediction. The quality of sequential retiming {{depends upon the}} estimated interconnect delays. We derive the interconnect delays from the average net-lengths predictions and the newly proposed mutual contraction measure [9]. We transform the predicted net lengths into <b>net</b> <b>weights</b> and use them in our sequential budgeting. The results show that sequential retiming with the new <b>net</b> <b>weighting</b> and budgeting to estimate the net delays can improve circuit speeds by 12. 29 % on the average, compared to timing-driven placement. The new <b>net</b> <b>weighting</b> method {{is better than the}} uniform weighting. Retiming with estimated net delays is better than retiming at the logic level only...|$|R

In the first section, a rigorous mathematical framework is developed under which <b>net</b> <b>weighting</b> methods, common in VLSI physical design, may be proven to converge, given that they satisfy several natural properties defined in the work. Several <b>net</b> <b>weighting</b> techniques from industry are analyzed within this framework and adapted so to form a class of schemes that satisfy the convergent properties. These are implemented and experimentally tested within the analytical placer mPL. In the second section, the <b>net</b> <b>weighting</b> framework is extended to statistical timing-aware placement in a novel algorithm, termed STAP, with promising experimental results. In the third section, a new approach to statistical timing-aware gate sizing, termed ProSize, is developed from current research in convex optimization...|$|R

40|$|Filtering rate, length-specific weight, and {{fecundity}} {{were used}} as measures of short, medium and long-term responses of individual Daphnia catawba to manipulation of the natural food supply and to seasonal fluctuations in water temperature. Natural lake seston concentration was manipulated to encompass a realistic range of food concentrations in in situ enclosures and six, four or eight day experiments were conducted over a two month period {{to take advantage of}} seasonal variability in lake water temperature. Based on prior laboratory studies, both filtering rate and length-specific weight were expected to respond to changes in food supply and water temperature and a threshold food concentration was expected above which weight gain would occur. The results of this study are in general agreement with predictions from earlier laboratory studies. The general seston components (chl a, POC, PON) were not significantly correlated with filtering rate and <b>net</b> <b>weight</b> change in Daphnia catawba. Only the plankton biomass component and water temperature variables explained significant levels of variation in filtering rate and <b>net</b> <b>weight</b> change. Filtering rates were weakly, negatively correlated with an edible (5 - 10 μm) plankton biomass and positively correlated with an edible (5 - 10 μm) plankton biomass component. Multiple linear regression analysis indicated that these variables explained 14, 20 and 13 % of the variance in filtering rate of small, medium and large animals respectively. <b>Net</b> <b>weight</b> change; calculated as the difference between the final and initial dry body weights, was found to be significantly positively correlated with the smallest plankton component (< 2 μm) and significantly negatively correlated with water temperature, with multiple regression models explaining 35, 37 and 58 % of the variance in <b>net</b> <b>weight</b> change for small, medium and large animals respectively. <b>Net</b> <b>weight</b> change in large animals was also significantly negatively correlated with initial animal weight (r==-. 782).
