The interior was noted by the Strand Magazine to contain predominantly Sheraton style furniture with [...] "Venetian and Flemish black-framed mirrors, Hispano-Moresque pottery, Venetian brass and copper-ware... blue-and-white Nankin and Delft (porcelain)".|$|E

Why, <b>nothing</b> <b>comes</b> amiss, so money comes withal" [...] (1.2.77–80). Furthermore, Petruchio is encouraged to woo Katherina by Gremio, Tranio (as Lucentio), and Hortensio, who vow to pay him if he wins her, on top of Baptista's dowry ("After my death, the one half of my lands, and in possession, twenty thousand crowns").

2500|$|Nothing is {{the mythical}} {{substance}} {{used in the}} series. From it the entire Universe formed through a concentration-based process. It appears as oily black smoke, or a black liquid, and contains the properties {{of being able to}} dissolve (with the exception of Immaterial objects) or create anything. [...] When enough <b>Nothing</b> <b>comes</b> together, it can form a Nithling. Nithlings are creatures not created by the Architect, but self-made from uncontained or uncontrolled Nothing. The Nithlings have this autonomy in common with both the Architect and the Old One, but apparently lack the power and creative impulses demonstrated by those elder beings. Nothing is likely based on Aether.|$|E
2500|$|Shaw also {{embarked}} on a successful legal battle to establish ownership of her entire recording catalogue, and began working with contemporary acts and producers, reworking much of her 1960s and 1980s material.

2500|$|From mid-2001 the band's {{momentum}} {{was reduced}} when a cyst {{was found on}} Ella's vocal cords and she underwent throat surgery late that year. Her voice was slow to recover, which [...] "destroyed any confidence she had in her voice." [...] In November of the following year she said, [...] "I have a rule – no singing before 10am. <b>Nothing</b> <b>comes</b> out, even if I wanted it to. If I'm on at 10am I have to be up by 8.30am, because {{it takes a while}} for my voice to sound human. It's like a croaky 80-year-old lady." [...] The group's official website announced in August 2001 that Wah Wah Music had joined with Sony Music Entertainment Australia for their releases. The band continued to work on its second studio album, Present (October 2002), which peaked at No.12. It was co-produced by Kosky and Robinson with Andy Baldwyn and issued on Wah Wah Music/Sony Music Australia. It was certified gold for shipment of 35,000 units in December.|$|E
