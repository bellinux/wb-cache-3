5|$|In 2004, Trenyce {{began to}} focus on theatre, playing roles in the plays <b>Not</b> <b>a</b> <b>Day</b> Goes By, The Vagina Monologues, Soul Kittens Cabaret and Mama's Sweet Potato Pie. In 2006, she played the lead role of Deena Jones in an Indianapolis {{production}} of the musical Dreamgirls. She made her film debut in 2008 and became the first American Idol contestant to headline a show in Las Vegas. She originated the role of Portia in David E. Talbert's play Love in the Nick of Tyme. Trenyce performed in a 2009 North American tour of the musical Ain't Misbehavin'.|$|E

25|$|Day One (12 March): Greig won the toss and gambled {{by putting}} Australia in to bat first. After Australian opener Ian Davis had fallen cheaply to the left-armer John Lever, the score {{advanced}} to thirteen. Bob Willis, working up some good pace with his ungainly style, bounced Australia's Rick McCosker, {{who decided to}} take on the delivery and play the hook shot. Realising too late that he had been beaten for pace, McCosker was struck flush on the jaw by the ball, which then fell on the stumps. England's joy at capturing the wicket quickly turned to concern when McCosker collapsed to the ground, holding his broken jaw. The plucky opener was helped from the ground, but looked unlikely to take further part in the game. The Australian batsmen appeared tentative and the England bowlers pressed home their advantage, taking the wickets of Gary Cosier, David Hookes and Doug Walters to leave Australia at 5 for 51 mid-afternoon. Hookes played a brief cameo of 17 runs from 19 balls, but it was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> for fast scoring. Wicketkeeper Rod Marsh joined his captain Greg Chappell for the only substantial partnership of the innings (51), but when Marsh was dismissed for 28 after {{an hour and a half}} of batting, the wickets began to fall again. Chappell was the ninth man out after almost four hours of batting – to illustrate the difficulty of the Australians' struggle, the aggressive Chappell failed to hit a boundary, while he scored his runs at a strike rate of just 28.7. All out 138 in only 44 overs, Australia had left England one hour's batting time before stumps. The English negotiated the period reasonably well, losing only Bob Woolmer for 9 in a total of 1 for 29. The visitors were clearly in the ascendancy at this point.|$|E

25|$|In 1955, Ganpal Lal Batto died {{suddenly}} in a road accident. His death left Shamshad very distraught, {{because her husband}} had been the focus of her life and they had both been extremely devoted to each other. He had handled many aspects of her career and contracts and had been a major positive energy behind her career progression. After his death, Shamshad became listless and lost the fighting spirit to pursue her career, which registered a sharp decline thereafter. Indeed, while Shamshad Begum was both an outstanding singer and a successful famous one, she was at some deeper level always a wife and mother first, someone who instinctively prioritised her family over her career. By nature, she preferred to keep away from the public glare and from business dealings, taking the view that it was rather unseemly for a lady to be involved in such things. After her husband's death, Shamshad Begum began living with her daughter and son-in-law in Mumbai, first in south Mumbai and later at Hiranandani Gardens in the Powai neighbourhood. She gradually became a recluse and devoted herself entirely to her grandchildren, {{to the point that the}} general public was unaware of whether she was alive or dead. In 2004, a controversy erupted in the media, when several publications wrongly reported that Shamshad Begum had died a few years previously. Shamshad's family clarified in a press release that this was not so; and it later emerged that the Shamshad Begum who had died in 1998 was Saira Banu's maternal grandmother. Her self-imposed seclusion is remarkable, because during all those decades away from the public eye, her old songs remained popular with the public and <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> passed without at least a couple of songs being played on Vividh Bharati and All India Radio.|$|E

500|$|The {{slaughter}} in Paris {{lasted for}} almost a week. It spread to many parts of France, where it persisted into the autumn. In the words of historian Jules Michelet, [...] "St Bartholomew was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>day,</b> but a season". On 29 September, when Navarre knelt before the altar as a Roman Catholic, having converted to avoid being killed, Catherine turned to the ambassadors and laughed. From this time dates {{the legend of the}} wicked Italian queen. Huguenot writers branded Catherine a scheming Italian, who had acted on Machiavelli's principles to kill all enemies in one blow.|$|E

500|$|Trenyce's work in theatre {{has mostly}} focused on [...] "various {{entertainment}} aspects of African-American interest". In 2004, {{she made her}} theatre debut as Yancey in a North American tour of <b>Not</b> <b>a</b> <b>Day</b> Goes By, a play with songs adapted from the E. Lynn Harris' 2000 novel of the same name. The tour ran from January to May 2004. Jet magazine wrote that Trenyce [...] "breathes life and voice into Yancey", describing her {{as one of the}} show's [...] "rich vocal talents". The Chicago Defender felt that Trenyce displayed a [...] "theatrical perception as she interprets a character". She soon performed in the play The Vagina Monologues. In 2005, she played in two Nicci Gillbert stage productions: Soul Kittens Cabaret and Mama's Sweet Potato Pie, participating in a North American tour of the latter. Trenyce's performance as the wife in Mama's Sweet Potato Pie was praised by Call and Post's Chris Bournea. The same year, she made a cameo appearance in the comedy film Beauty Shop, and performed on the BET reality television series College Hill.|$|E
500|$|Mantle is {{best known}} for his long stint as general surgeon Dr Mike Barratt in 85 episodes of the TV series Casualty from October 1992 to November 1996, and 32 episodes of Holby City between 1999 and 2001. He {{previously}} appeared in Casualty as the brother of a patient in 1988. Mantle received much acclaim for his role and was one of the show's most popular characters. He was praised for being entirely convincing as a hospital consultant and very dominant and authoritative in his role, [...] "shouting orders in incomprehensible hospital-speak." [...] Daily Mirror described him as a [...] "heart-throb consultant" [...] and said that the role brought him [...] "an army of female fans". A 2001 poll by the Scottish Sunday Mail voted him 7th on a list of Top [...] "10 heart-throb docs on the box" [...] in a list which included the likes of George Clooney and Goran Višnjić. Mantle has said that during his role as the doctor he received a lot of fan mail, some of which were medically related and asking for his advice, believing him to be a real doctor, but professed that he couldn't even stand the sight of real blood. He has said, [...] "It's funny because people always treat me like a doctor. <b>Not</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> goes by without someone coming up to me and asking me for advice." [...] In 1996, he turned down an offer of £250,000 to continue playing the character, and last appeared in Casualty in November 1996. He said of his departure: ...|$|E
500|$|Filming of Nefarious {{was started}} in 2007, marking Nolot's film debut. The initial plan {{was to create a}} short film, but the project was {{expanded}} when Exodus Cry realized the scope of the issue they were documenting. Nolot, a leader in Mike Bickle's International House of Prayer, travelled to 19 countries to collect material for the film. These filming locations included countries in the Middle East, Europe, North America, and Asia. Nolot attested to having found it difficult to produce the film due to the subject matter; he stated that [...] "there is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> that goes by that I am not mindful of the horrific tragedies we uncovered." [...] He further said that he did not make the film for money or for fame but did so in order to rouse people to action against human trafficking, an issue that he feels to be of great importance. Nolot said {{that the purpose of the}} film is [...] "to draw people's attention to the issue, but also to inspire them in terms of what they can be doing … to take a stand against this injustice." [...] Steve Willis and Matthew Dickey were the film's cinematographers. Willis, founder of Underpin Photography, also served as photographer while Dickey filled the roles of associate producer and editor, also directing the re-enactment scenes. Actors in these re-enactment scenes included Bill Oberst Jr., Christian Simpson (as Christian J. Simpson), Allison Weissman, Sarah Agor, and Jess Allen. John Samuel Hanson composed the film score for Nefarious after having worked on such other projects as 16 Blocks, Constantine, The Book of Eli, and Lost. As of January 2012, Nolot was producing two sequels to Nefarious.|$|E

2500|$|Paul Cernat argues that, {{with fellow}} critic-novelist N. D. Cocea, Aderca {{was among those}} Contimporanul men who {{remained}} outside the avant-garde movement, while making only few concessions to avant-garde aesthetics. Aderca's conflicting allegiances were even approached with severity by Vinea. In a 1927 editorial for Contimporanul, where he compared Lovinescu's review to [...] "a menagerie", Vinea stated: [...] " [...] only F. Aderca simulates controversy, shouting through his cage: 'I am independent... <b>Not</b> <b>a</b> <b>day</b> passes that I don't quarrel with Lovinescu...' And, at the same time, the insensitive tamer [...] makes his elephants play the piano".|$|E

2500|$|The Catholic Church regards Good Friday and Holy Saturday as the Paschal fast, {{in accord}} with Article 110 of Sacrosanctum Concilium. [...] In the Latin Church, a fast day is {{understood}} as having only one full meal and two collations (a smaller repast, the two of which together do not equal the one full meal) – although this may be observed less stringently on Holy Saturday than on Good Friday – and on which the faithful abstain from eating meat. This is why many places have the typical 'Fish Friday'.

A lot has happened since 1995; a lot has happened in our lives and we've never talked about it or discussed it publicly. So some of that is what's addressed here. That's the way we operate, it's about what really happened in life. We're not really the fast cars and chicks songs. It's basically what's happened in life, but a lot has happened since the last record. And it's on this record." [...] The title track, [...] "Black Gives Way to Blue", was written as a tribute to Staley. Regarding the lyrics to other specific songs, Cantrell said the first single from the album, [...] "A Looking in View", [...] "basically speaks to any number of things that keep you balled up inside." [...] The second single, [...] "Check My Brain", features lyrics dealing with Cantrell's move from Seattle to Los Angeles in 2003. The third single, [...] "Your Decision", contains lyrics about [...] "surviving pain and choosing to live." [...] Cantrell also denied a popular misconception that the song [...] "Private Hell" [...] is about Layne Staley. He stated that the song is in fact about himself breaking up with a girl that he loved a lot and he [...] "wasn't man enough to go through with it". But Cantrell also pointed out that there's {{a lot of things in}} the song that aren't specifically about that and other people can relate to.|$|E
