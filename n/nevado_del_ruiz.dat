5|$|<b>Nevado</b> <b>del</b> <b>Ruiz</b> {{lies within}} the Pacific Ring of Fire, {{a region that}} encircles the Pacific Ocean and {{contains}} some of the world's most active volcanoes. It is the third most northerly of the volcanoes lying in the North Volcanic Zone of the Andean Volcanic Belt, which contains 75 of the 204 Holocene-age volcanoes in South America. The Andean Volcanic Belt is produced by the eastward subduction of the oceanic Nazca Plate beneath the South American continental plate. As {{is the case for}} many subduction-zone volcanoes, <b>Nevado</b> <b>del</b> <b>Ruiz</b> can generate explosive Plinian eruptions with associated pyroclastic flows that can melt snow and glaciers near the summit, producing large and sometimes devastating lahars (mud and debris flows).|$|E
5|$|Further hazards {{exist in}} the form of snowpack on about half of the volcanoes; under the {{influence}} of pyroclastic flows, the snowpack can melt, generating dangerous lahars such as the one generated by the 1985 eruption of <b>Nevado</b> <b>del</b> <b>Ruiz</b> volcano in Colombia. This eruption claimed 23,000 fatalities, and lahars are a major cause of volcanic eruption associated fatalities.|$|E
5|$|In September 1985, as {{earthquakes}} and phreatic eruptions rocked the area, local officials began planning for an evacuation. In October, a hazard map was finalized {{for the area}} around <b>Nevado</b> <b>del</b> <b>Ruiz.</b> This map highlighted the danger from falling material—including ash and rock—near Murillo, Santa Isabel, and Libano, {{as well as the}} threat of lahars in Mariquita, Guayabal, Chinchiná and Armero.|$|E
5|$|In late 1984, geologists {{noticed that}} seismic {{activity}} in the area had begun to increase. Increased fumarole activity, deposition of sulfur on {{the summit of the}} volcano, and phreatic eruptions also alerted geologists to the possibility of an eruption. Phreatic events, when rising magma encounters water, continued well into September 1985 (one major event took place on September 11, 1985), shooting steam high into the air. Activity began to decline in October, probably because the new magma had finished ascending into <b>Nevado</b> <b>del</b> <b>Ruiz's</b> volcanic edifice.|$|R

On clear days is {{possible}} to see the snow-covered <b>Nevado</b> <b>del</b> Tolima and <b>Ruiz</b> volcanoes. The Santa Isabel snow hills, located to the west and the Magdalena River opposite the Central Mountain Range can also be seen.|$|R
40|$|As a {{consequence}} of ongoing atmospheric temperature rise, tropical glaciers belong to the unique and threatened ecosystems on Earth, {{as defined by the}} Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (Houghton and others, 2001). Worldwide glacier monitoring, especially as part of the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS), includes the systematic collection of data on such perennial surface ice masses. Several peaks in the sierras of Colombia have lost their glacier cover during recent decades. Today, high-altitude glaciers still exist in Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, in Sierra Nevada del Cocuy and on the volcanoes of <b>Nevados</b> <b>del</b> <b>Ruiz,</b> de Santa Isabel, del Tolima and del Huila. Comparison of reconstructions of maximum glacier area extent during the Little Ice Age with more recent information from aerial photographs and satellite images clearly documents a fast-shrinking tendency and potential disappearance of the remaining glaciers within the next few decades. In the past 50 years, Colombian glaciers have lost 50 % or more of their area. Glacier shrinkage has continued to be strong in the last 15 years, with a loss of 10 - 50 % of the glacier area. The relationship between fast glacier retreat and local, regional and global climate change is now being investigated. Preliminary analyses indicate that the temperature rise of roughly 1 ° C in the last 30 years recorded at high-altitude meteorological stations exerts a primary control on glacier retreat. The investigations on the Colombian glaciers thus corroborate earlier findings concerning the high sensitivity of glaciers in the wet inner tropics to temperature rise. To improve understanding of fast glacier retreat in Colombia, a modern monitoring network has been established according to the multilevel strategy of the Global Terrestrial Network for Glaciers (GTN-G) within GCOS. The observations are also contributions to continued assessments of hazards from the glacier-covered volcanoes and to integrated global change research in mountain biosphere reserves...|$|R
5|$|Volcanic {{activity}} increased {{again in}} November 1985 as magma neared the surface. Increasing quantities of gases rich in sulfur dioxide and elemental sulfur {{began to appear}} in the volcano. The water content of the fumaroles' gases decreased, and water springs in the vicinity of <b>Nevado</b> <b>del</b> <b>Ruiz</b> became enriched with magnesium, calcium and potassium, leached from the magma.|$|E
5|$|<b>Nevado</b> <b>del</b> <b>Ruiz</b> is one {{of several}} stratovolcanoes within Los Nevados National Natural Park, a {{national}} park located west of Bogotá in the centre of the Colombian Andes. The park is a popular tourist destination and contains several tourist shelters. The slopes of the volcano are used for winter sports, and nearby Lake Otún offers trout fishing. A number of commercially operated spas can be found nearby.|$|E

5|$|Beginning November 1984, geologists {{observed}} {{an increasing}} level of seismic activity near <b>Nevado</b> <b>del</b> <b>Ruiz.</b> Other {{signs of a}} forthcoming eruption included increased fumarole activity, deposition of sulfur on {{the summit of the}} volcano, and small phreatic eruptions. In the latter, hot magma came in contact with water, resulting in explosions as the water was almost instantly turned into steam. The most notable of these events was an ash ejection on September 11, 1985. The activity of the volcano decreased in October 1985. The most likely explanation of the events is that new magma rose into the volcanic edifice before September 1985.|$|E
5|$|The volcano {{continues}} {{to pose a}} serious threat to nearby towns and villages. Of the threats, the one with the most potential for danger is that of small-volume eruptions, which can destabilize glaciers and trigger lahars. Although much of the volcano's glacier mass has retreated, a significant volume of ice still sits atop <b>Nevado</b> <b>del</b> <b>Ruiz</b> and other volcanoes in the Ruiz–Tolima massif. Melting just 10 percent of the ice would produce lahars with a volume of up to 200million cubic meterssimilar to the lahar that destroyed Armero in 1985. In just hours, these lahars can travel up to 100km along river valleys.|$|E
5|$|During September and October 2010, INGEOMINAS (Colombian Institute of Mining and Geology) noted gradual {{increases}} in seismic activity near the Arenas crater. Sulfurous odors and phreatic eruptions reported at <b>Nevado</b> <b>del</b> <b>Ruiz</b> prompted an alert level of Yellow on October 1. Chemical {{analysis of the}} volcano demonstrated deformative changes and geochemical alterations. Over the next four months a smattering of long-period earthquakes, considered pseudo-Tornillo events, raised worries that the volcano might erupt. In 2010, tilt increased, and on average 890 volcanic tremors were recorded monthly, roughly eight {{times as many as}} had been recorded from 2009–2010. 2010 marked the beginning of {{increases in}} sulfur dioxide emissions accompanying small eruptions at the volcano, which both peaked in February 2012 correspondent to a dramatic increase in earthquakes.|$|E

5|$|The first eruptions of <b>Nevado</b> <b>del</b> <b>Ruiz</b> {{occurred}} about 1.8 {{million years}} ago {{at the beginning of the}} Pleistocene epoch. Three primary eruption periods in the history of the massif have been identified: ancestral, older and present. During the ancestral period between one million to two {{million years ago}}, a complex of large stratovolcanoes was created. Between 1.0 million and 0.8 million years ago, they partially collapsed, forming large (5–10km wide) calderas. During the older period, which lasted from 0.8 million to 0.2 million years ago, a new complex of large stratovolcanoes developed (including Older Ruiz, Tolima, Quindio, and Santa Isabel). Once again explosive summit calderas formed from 0.2 million to 0.15 million years ago.|$|E
5|$|The present period began about 150,000years ago and {{involved}} {{the development of}} the present volcanic edifice through the emplacement of lava domes made of andesite and dacite (igneous rocks) inside older calderas. During the past 11,000years, <b>Nevado</b> <b>del</b> <b>Ruiz</b> passed through at least 12 eruption stages, which included multiple slope failures (rock avalanches), pyroclastic flows and lahars leading to partial destruction of the summit domes. During the past several thousand years, eruptions of the volcanoes in the Ruiz–Tolima massif have mostly been small, and the pyroclastic flow deposits have been much less voluminous than during the Pleistocene. Since the volcano's earlier eruptions are not recorded, volcanologists have used tephrochronology to date them.|$|E
5|$|<b>Nevado</b> <b>del</b> <b>Ruiz</b> has {{undergone}} three distinct eruptive periods, the first beginning 1.8million years ago. During the present period (beginning 11,000years ago), it has erupted at least twelve times, producing ashfalls, pyroclastic flows, and lahars. The historically recorded eruptions have primarily involved a central vent eruption (in the caldera) {{followed by an}} explosive eruption, then the formation of lahars. Ruiz's earliest identified Holocene eruption was in about 6660BC, and further eruptions occurred around 1245, 850, 200BC and in about 350, 675, in 1350, 1541 (perhaps), 1570, 1595, 1623, 1805, 1826, 1828 (perhaps), 1829, 1831, 1833 (perhaps), 1845, 1916, December 1984 through March 1985, 1987 through July 1991, and possibly in April 1994. Many of these eruptions involved a central vent eruption, a flank vent eruption, and a phreatic (steam) explosion. Ruiz is the second-most active volcano in Colombia after Galeras.|$|E

5|$|In April 1980, Voight's {{publications}} on landslides and avalanches {{and other}} mass movements {{attracted the attention}} of Rocky Crandell of the United States Geological Survey (USGS), who asked him to look at a growing bulge on the Mount St. Helens volcano in the state of Washington. Voight foresaw the collapse of the mountain's north flank as well as a powerful eruption. His predictions came true when St. Helens erupted in May 1980; Voight was then hired by the USGS to investigate the debris avalanche that initiated the eruption. After his work at St. Helens brought him international recognition, Voight continued researching and guiding monitoring efforts at several active volcanoes throughout his career, including <b>Nevado</b> <b>del</b> <b>Ruiz</b> in Colombia, Mount Merapi in Indonesia, and Soufrière Hills, a volcano on the Caribbean island of Montserrat. For his research, publications, and disaster prevention work as a volcanologist and engineer, Voight has been honored with numerous awards, appointments, and medals.|$|E
5|$|In April 1989, Voight {{returned}} to Colombia to the volcano Galeras after being {{contacted by the}} United Nations Disaster Relief Organization. People in Pasto, located {{at the foot of}} the volcano, had become alarmed by noises and shaking from Galeras. While Galeras proved far easier to climb than <b>Nevado</b> <b>del</b> <b>Ruiz,</b> land mines planted to hinder guerrilla forces dotted the slopes of the mountain. With USGS geologist Dick Janda, Voight drew a hazard map that included several populated areas within the danger zone. Before Voight left Galeras, the volcano underwent an unexpected phreatic eruption, which Voight and his team failed to predict. Although Pasto was unaffected, six scientists attending a United Nations workshop for natural disaster relief were killed. After reviewing deformation data from the day before the eruption, Voight discovered that no acceleration in the deformation process had occurred. He surmised that phreatic eruptions do not exhibit an acceleration in deformation before taking place and left after confirming that the volcano's monitoring system functioned properly.|$|E

25|$|Galeras is {{considered}} the most active volcano in Colombia, followed by <b>Nevado</b> <b>del</b> <b>Ruiz.</b> Its earliest activity during the Holocene has been dated at 7050 BC ± 1000 years through radiocarbon dating. Other eruptions similar to this event include those in 3150BC ± 200 years, 2580BC ± 500 years, 1160BC ± 300 years, 490BC ± 100 years, and in 890 AD ± 200 years. Typically these eruptions consist of a central vent explosion, conducive to an explosive eruption causing pyroclastic flows and/or lahars. Eruptions in more recent times, which have been recorded consist of those in 1535, December 1580, July 1616, 1641, 1670, 1754, November 1796, June 1823, October 1828, 1834, October 1865, July 1889, 1891, December 1923, October 1924, October 1932, February 1936, July 1947, January 1950, 1974, February 1989, January 1990, January 1993, March 2000, June 2002, July 2004, November 2005, and October 2007.
