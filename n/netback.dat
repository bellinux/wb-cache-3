40|$|DLNR {{staff has}} {{recommended}} {{a modified version}} of the current federal <b>netback</b> method used to calculate geothermal royalties. The principal differences between the DLNR staff method and the Minerals Management Service (MMS) <b>Netback</b> Method is that the staff method reduces the allowable rate of return on invested capital by 25 %, and limits the amount of generation and transmission deductions allowed. Assuming that no minimum royalty payment is established by the Board of Land and Natural Resources (Board), the current MMS method when applied to the PGV project results in zero royalty payments for the first 11 years, as opposed to the staff method which forecasts initial royalty payments on the order of $ 450, 000 per year. It would appear that, without any provision for a minimum payment, DLNR staff may have chosen to modify the federal method on the basis that zero royalty payments would be unacceptable.

40|$|About 50 % {{of natural}} gas in Indonesia is {{exported}} to other countries despite of the demand {{of natural gas}} is relatively high, which may cause supply shortage in future. One {{of the reasons is}} that the export price of natural gas is higher than the domestic price. Indonesia has become an energy exporter for a long time, and has subsidized the cost of its domestic energy supply. Natural gas is one of the fuels which have been supported by the government. Many of the crude oil importing countries set the domestic natural gas price with references to the prices of crude oil mix, of which Japanese crude cocktail (JCC) method is commonly used to determine the natural gas price in the country. However, JCC is heavily dependent on crude oil prices and excludes the other substitution fuels. In this paper, the determination of natural gas price for domestic consumption in Indonesia using <b>netback</b> market value is investigated. The method takes into account prices of all competitive fuels with proper weightings of their shares in each consumer sector, by which the natural gas price does not depend only on crude oil prices, but also on other substitution fuel prices. <b>Netback</b> market value method will provide the relative prices of the natural gas for the consumers to other fuels. Information of all types of fuel including prices and consumption amounts in the past will be used to calculate natural gas price and analyzed in comparison with the actual price. The result will be useful for the policy makers to set the price of natural gas and the country’s energy plan in order to secure continuous supply of natural gas...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{looks into}} various models that address {{strategic}} {{behavior in the}} supply of gas by the Mexican monopoly Pemex. The paper has three very strong technical results. First, the <b>netback</b> pricing rule {{for the price of}} domestic natural gas (based on a Houston benchmark price) leads to discontinuities in Pemex's revenue function. Second, having Pemex pay for the gas it uses and the gas it flares increases the value of the Lagrange multiplier associated with the gas processing constraint. Third, if the gas processing constraint is binding, having Pemex pay for the gas it uses and flares does not change the short run optimal solution for the optimization problem, so it will have no impact on short-run behavior. These results imply three clear policy recommendations. The first is that the arbitrage point be fixed by the amount of gas Pemex has the potential to supply in the absence of processing and gathering constraints. The second is that Pemex be charged for the gas it uses in production and the gas it flares. The third is that investment in gas processing and pipeline should be in a separate account from other Pemex investment.

40|$|Process {{to process}} {{material}} and heat integration strategies for bio-oil integrated gasification and methanol synthesis (BOIG-MeOH) systems {{were developed to}} assess their technological and economic feasibility. Distributed bio-oil generations and centralised processing enhance resource flexibility and technological feasibility. Economic performance depends on the integration of centralised BOIG-MeOH processes, investigated for cryogenic air separation unit (ASU) and water electrolyser configurations. Design and operating variables of gasification, heat recovery from gases, water and carbon dioxide removal units, water-gas shift and methanol synthesis reactors and CHP network were analysed to improve the overall efficiency and economics. The efficiency of BOIG-MeOH system using bio-oil from various feedstocks was investigated. The system efficiency primarily attributed by the moisture content of the raw material decreases from oilseed rape through miscanthus to poplar wood. Increasing capacity and recycle enhances feasibility, e. g. 1350 MWBOIG-MeOH with ASU and 90 % recycle configuration achieves an efficiency of 61. 5 % (methanol, low grade heat and electricity contributions by 89 %, 7. 9 % and 3 % respectively) based on poplar wood {{and the cost of}} production (COP) of methanol of 318. 1 Euro/t for the prices of bio-oil of 75 Euro/t and electricity of 80. 12 Euro/MWh, respectively.

40|$|Peru {{is one of}} {{the fastest}} growing {{countries}} in Latin America, thanks in part to industry fueled by generous endowments of hydro power capacity and natural gas reserves. However, investment in electricity generation capacity has not kept pace with the rapid increase in demand and threatens to stymie future economic growth. A flawed regulatory environment is to blame, and specific roadblocks to increased generation investments include a dysfunctional capacity payment system, low administratively determined gas prices, and structural barriers to investment in hydro. This thesis provides an overview of the design, functioning and historical context for energy regulation in Peru; identifies the key barriers to generation investment; analyzes two potential regulatory reforms; and recommends the specific reform that has the most promise for reigniting investment in hydro. Two reforms strike at the root of the current problem: The first, increasing the price of natural gas for power generators up to the economic <b>netback</b> value of LNG exports, would make hydro a viable investment but would hit consumers with very large increases in their electricity bills. An alternative approach, a reform to the capacity payment mechanism, could provide the same benefits in terms of drawing new generator investment but at a much lower cost to consumers. It would also offer benefits for regulatory discretion in the future evolution of the grid. by Alex Cade Breckel. Thesis: S.

40|$|In the mid- 2000 s the Russian {{authorities}} were firmly {{in control of}} the countryâs gas sector; their influence was primarily reflected in their right to set the regulated price for gas sold by the dominant producer, Gazprom. This regulated price was on an upward trajectory, growing at around 15 per cent per annum, as the government attempted to balance Gazpromâs needs for more funds with the desire of domestic industry and the population for low gas prices. However, demand was rising across all the markets for Russian gas at that time, with increasing exports to Europe and the FSU, mainly for use in power generation. Meanwhile, economic growth at home was catalysing annual gas demand growth of 2 â 3 per cent per annum as gas retained its position as the most important fuel in the energy economy by far, accounting for 50 per cent of primary consumption. The key issue, therefore, appeared to be the need to incentivize the development of Gazpromâs new Yamal fields, in order to secure sufficient supply to meet anticipated demand. With this in mind, President Putin stated in 2006 that domestic gas prices should reach export <b>netback</b> parity by 2011; this meant a doubling of the tariff to reach a level of approximately $ 120 â 130 /mcm, given the prevailing oil price of $ 50 per barrel at the time he spoke.
