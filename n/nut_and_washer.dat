50|$|An {{anchor bolt}} is a {{fastener}} used to attach objects or structures to concrete. There are {{many types of}} anchor bolts, consisting of designs that are mostly proprietary to the manufacturing companies. All consist of a threaded end, to which a <b>nut</b> <b>and</b> <b>washer</b> can be attached for the external load. Anchor bolts are extensively used on all types of projects, from standard buildings to dams and nuclear power plants.

50|$|In {{the last}} few years of wooden boat construction, glue and screws took over, but until the 1950s, the keel, hog, stem, apron, deadwoods, sternpost, and perhaps transom would be {{fastened}} together by bolts set in white lead and grease. There are three kinds of bolt, of which, nowadays, the screw bolt, with its <b>nut</b> <b>and</b> <b>washer,</b> {{is by far the most}} common. The second type of bolt is the pin bolt or cotter bolt, which, instead of a thread, has a tapered hole forged through the end away from the head, into which a tapered pin or cotter is knocked. The taper is in effect a straight thread. In conjunction with a washer, this draws the bolt tight, as a nut does on a screw bolt. The third type of bolt is the clench bolt. It has some of the features of a rivet but was usually much longer than the normal rivet; in a wooden ship, perhaps a metre or more. For a shipwright's use, it is of copper. A head is formed by upsetting one end using a swage. It is then knocked through a hole bored through the work to be fastened, and through a washer. The head is held up with a dolly and the other end is upset over the washer in the same way as the head. Until well into the nineteenth century, this is what held the great ships of the world together, though some may have used iron. Until the late 1950s, the centre-line assembly of British Admiralty twenty-five foot motor cutters were fastened this way.|$|E

50|$|The tornado {{continued}} generally northeast at EF4 strength, completely debarking {{trees and}} leveling entire neighborhoods.

More than a dozen homes in a subdivision just to the south of Plaza Towers Elementary were swept cleanly away, though they were revealed to have been nailed rather than bolted to their foundations. Damage in that area was rated EF4 because of this. Most of the fatalities occurred in the Plaza Towers area.

50|$|At 7:06 p.m. on April 27 (0006 UTC on April 28), a weak tornado {{touched down}} in extreme western Pulaski County, Arkansas, roughly 6 mi east of Paron, and tracked north-northeast.

One {{of the homes}} was built with bolts along the foundation perimeter and {{was reduced to a}} bare slab, normally indicative of EF5 strength; however, {{it was found that the}} anchor bolts were not secured with <b>nuts</b> <b>and</b> <b>washers,</b> <b>and</b> nearby vehicles were not moved, which indicated a lesser intensity. Three people were killed in that area. The storm weakened as it turned more northeasterly and moved through a forested area. Damage to trees and homes in this area was rated EF1. At 7:14 p.m. (0014 UTC), it struck Northpoint as an EF2, causing severe damage to several homes. Roofs were removed entirely from homes, though the walls on these structures remained mostly intact. After briefly crossing Lake Maumelle, the tornado caused significant tree damage between Roland and Natural Steps with some trees being stripped of their foliage and debarked. Moving through an unpopulated area, the tornado intensified before crossing the Arkansas River and entering Faulkner County around 7:26 p.m. (0026 UTC).|$|R

The resulting relationship between torque – tension for the bolt – nut – washer assembly is used to explain its behavior as the length and location of treatment surface are varied. Tests were performed upon one hundred sixty four bolts; eighty A 325 of three inches in length, fifty-two A 325 of six inches in length, twenty A 490 of three inches in length, and twelve A 490 of six inches in length. One hundred sixty four <b>nuts</b> <b>and</b> <b>washers</b> were tested, one hundred nuts type 2 H, <b>and</b> fifty six <b>nuts</b> type C <b>and</b> eight <b>nuts</b> type D to determine the effect of the variables (nut type, bolt length, bolt type and Control Fluid) on the torque-tension relationship of the bolt-nut-washer assembly. Hundreds of experiments using replicate samples for statistical reli-ability were conducted to establish the effect of the variables on the tension-torque relationship of the bolt-nut-washer assemblage. The principal relationship in turn-of-nut installation is that between elongation and bolt pretension, the tension-torque relationship is the factor that reflects the bolt pretension in an installation to be expected in a properly tightened connection. Control Fluid was found to decrease the coefficient of friction on coated parts and to control the tension obtained with a given torque upon assembly...|$|R

40|$|The {{collaborative}} reuse {{of engineering}} data {{is one way}} that e-commerce can significantly reduce the development costs of new products. However the proliferation of Web-based catalogs for standard components (such as brochure-ware for <b>nuts</b> <b>and</b> <b>washers)</b> only hints at the possible productivity gains. The research reported here is motivated by the belief that shape matching technology {{is the key to}} enabling a much deeper form of Internet-based collaborative commerce. This article describes the coarse "shape filters" that support a 3 D, Internet-based search engine, known as ShapeSifter, which aims to locate parts, already in production, that have a shape similar to a desired 'newly designed' part. The research vision is that once component models are on the Web, and indexed by, say, the ShapeSifter (or some similar system), a designer could query the search engine by uploading a 3 D model of the part required. The search engine would then analyse the shape characteristics of the target model and perform a similarity match on the contents of its database. The challenge of the research is to identify shape metrics that produce effective characterizations of 3 D models for similarity comparison purposes. In this context, the work reported focuses on the use of three novel convex-hull-based indices to carry out a preliminary coarse filtering of candidates prior to more detailed analysis (such as the construction of multidimensional feature vectors).

40|$|The {{existing}} {{design code}} for torque limit of bolted joints for composites at Marshall Space Flight Center is MSFC-STD- 486 B, which was originally developed in 1960 s for metallic materials. The theoretical {{basis for this}} code was a simplified mechanics analysis, which takes into account only the bolt, <b>nut</b> <b>and</b> <b>washers,</b> but not the structural members to be connected. The assumption was that metallic materials would not fail due to the bearing stress at the contact area between <b>washer</b> <b>and</b> the mechanical member. This is true for metallic materials; but for composite materials the results could be completely different. Unlike most metallic materials, laminated composite materials have superior mechanical properties (such as modulus and strength) in the in-plane direction, {{but not in the}} out-of-plane, or through-the-thickness (TTT) direction. During the torquing, TTT properties (particularly compressive modulus and compressive strength) play a dominant role in composite failure. Because of this concern, structural design engineers at Marshall are currently using a compromised empirical approach: using 50 % of the torque value for composite members. Companies like Boeing is using a similar approach. An initial study was conducted last summer on this topic to develop theoretical model(s) that takes into consideration of composite members. Two simplified models were developed based on stress failure criterion and strain failure criterion, respective. However, these models could not be used to predict the torque limit because of the unavailability of material data, specifically, through-the-thickness compression (TTTC) modulus and strength. Therefore, the task for this summer is to experimentally determine the TTTC properties. Due to the time limitation, only one material has been tested: IM 7 / 8552 with [0 degrees,plus or minus 45 degrees, 90 degree] configuration.

The methodology also includes hardware in the form of a testing board and the small parts that can be installed onto the board during a test. The usability of new hand tools was determined based on efficiency and the number of dropped parts.
