Use of nitrate contaminated drinking water is well known risk factor for infant methemoglobinemia and various types of human cancer. There is a possibility of contamination of <b>nitrate</b> <b>nitrogen</b> in agro wells due to intensive use of inorganic fertilizer in permeable soil with shallow ground water. Objective {{of the study was}} to measure the <b>nitrate</b> <b>nitrogen</b> in selected agro wells and observe the temporal variation. Twenty wells were selected randomly from the Kanthapuram areas who have been cultivating vegetable crops for long period of time. Monthly water samples were collected from December 2008 to February 2010 to analysis <b>Nitrate</b> <b>Nitrogen.</b> Samples were drawn from the wells approximately at the levels of 30 cm depth below the free water surface. <b>Nitrate</b> <b>nitrogen</b> was determined by colorimetric method (Brucine method). Mean <b>Nitrate</b> <b>nitrogen</b> in the study area was 12. 2 mg/l from December 2008 to June 2009 and 95 % of the wells were above WHO permissible limit of 10 mg/l. The depth of the well varied from 6 m to 12 m and around 70 % of the farmers apply the inorganic fertilizer above the recommended level.

30|$|The {{combination}} of Langmuir isotherm of ammonium nitrogen and Freundlich isotherm of <b>nitrate</b> <b>nitrogen</b> {{is identified as}} a best {{combination of}} isotherm scenario, which mitigates the <b>nitrate</b> <b>nitrogen</b> contamination in groundwater resources in greater depth.|$|E
30|$|It is also {{observed}} from Fig.  6 that the ammonium nitrogen concentration reaches 0  mg/l at {{the depth of}} 18  cm {{in the presence of}} Langmuir isotherm. This is the least depth of penetration by ammonium nitrogen as compared with linear and Freundlich isotherms, which shows that Langmuir isotherm plays a predominant role on ammonium sorption between aqueous and solid phase. The complex interplay between the aqueous and solid phase of ammonium nitrogen shows the associate reduction in nitrite nitrogen and <b>nitrate</b> <b>nitrogen</b> concentration. This can be confirmed by penetration of <b>nitrate</b> <b>nitrogen</b> up to the depth of 25  cm in the presence of Langmuir isotherm. Further, it is noticed that a drastic deduction in depth (30  cm) of movement on <b>nitrate</b> <b>nitrogen</b> is {{also observed}} in the presence of Langmuir isotherm. It can be concluded from Fig.  6 that the peak concentration of <b>nitrate</b> <b>nitrogen</b> has reduced to 36 % for Freundlich isotherm as compared with linear isotherm and 54 % has been observed for Langmuir as compared with linear isotherm. This reduction indicates that the Langmuir isotherm is performing well on <b>nitrate</b> <b>nitrogen</b> reduction at deeper depths and the groundwater contamination by <b>nitrate</b> <b>nitrogen</b> is averted. Moreover, it is keenly observed from Fig.  6 that the ammonium nitrogen becomes zero after the depth of 40, 25 and 18  cm for linear, Freundlich and Langmuir isotherms and the peak values of <b>nitrate</b> <b>nitrogen</b> concentration are observed at the depth of 50, 53 and 25  cm. Additionally, it is observed that the ammonium nitrogen reduction and <b>nitrate</b> <b>nitrogen</b> increase are directly influenced by the nitrification process and the depth of penetration is directly correlated by the linear adsorption rate on ammonium nitrogen and the reduction in <b>nitrate</b> <b>nitrogen</b> concentration with depth is relatively fast in the case of Freundlich isotherm as compared with linear isotherm.|$|E
