5|$|The Triangle Link is {{partially}} financed with tolls, with toll collection {{taking place at}} Føyno. It is constructed as a grade-separated intersection, such that any car passes through the plaza once. Cars driving along the E39 drive straight ahead through the plaza, while cars to or from Bømlo <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> interchange. The toll station uses the Autopass toll collection, which allows passage without stopping, in addition to manual collection. Passengers, pedestrians, bicycles, motorcyclists and mopeds are free. As of 2011, the fees are NOK85 for cars and NOK270 for trucks. Frequent travelers can prepay for at least 40 passings to the toll company, and receive a 40 percent discount. It is estimated that the tunnel will be paid off and the tolls removed in 2012 or 2013.|$|E
5|$|The {{gameplay}} in Super Punch-Out!! {{is similar}} to that of its arcade and NES/FC predecessors. The player controls a nameable boxer as he fights his way to become W.V.B.A. Champion. The player controls the boxer from a third-person perspective, with him being translucent on the screen. Players can attack their opponents with jabs to the face or with body blows from either hand. The opponent can deflect punches, so players must aim at the opponent's open spot (where the gloves are not) to connect. Depending on the opponents' stances, they will guard themselves differently, so players <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> correct punches.|$|E

5|$|In {{conjunction}} with {{the reconstruction of the}} main line station above, a new ticket hall was excavated below the concourse with two sets of escalators replacing the lifts. The escalators provide access to and from an intermediate passenger circulation level, which, in turn, gives access to the Northern line Charing Cross branch platforms and two further sets of escalators; one set each serving the northbound and southbound Victoria and Northern line Bank branch platforms. Interchanges between the northbound and southbound Victoria and Northern Bank Line platforms are made via a passageway at the lower level so as to avoid the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> escalators. An emergency stair to the intermediate interchange level is located midway along the passageway. The Victoria line platforms opened on 1 December 1968 when the second section of the line was opened between Highbury & Islington and Warren Street. Disused passages remain with tiling and posters from the 1960s.|$|E
5|$|Mr. Burns sends hired goons to the Simpson {{house in}} order to take Homer back to Mr. Burns' Manor to negotiate. While Mr. Burns is setting the agenda for the discussion, Homer is struck by the urgent <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> rest room. Homer asks Mr. Burns where the rest room is and {{immediately}} leaves, leading Mr. Burns to conclude that Homer is a tough negotiator who is unwilling to even hear him out. At a later union meeting, Homer tries to resign, tired of meeting with Mr. Burns. The union misunderstands his frustration, and the members nearly unanimously decide to strike. Mr. Burns is undeterred by the strike and tries several methods of breaking it up, but fails. On an edition of Kent Brockman's talk show Smartline, Mr. Burns is allowed an opening tirade and he threatens dire events if the strike is not concluded.|$|E
5|$|The small burns {{that are}} tributaries to the East Burn {{contributed to the}} {{draining}} of the lands of Dunnikier Estate. The burn emerges from a deep-set culvert to flow under the Victoria Viaduct, down a deep gorge, through the site of Hutchison's Flour Mills before running parallel to the harbour wall and into the sea. From the mid-19th century, the Hutchison's buildings became a significant landmark adjacent to the burn. The flour millers chose this area for its railway connection which linked the main station to the harbour, rather than for the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> burn to power the mills. The West (or Tiel) Burn, was also important, providing power for textile mills. This burn flowed out of the Raith Estate lands where scenically and recreationally {{it was used to}} create Raith Lake (with its tributary, the Dronachy Burn). The mill owners in Linktown also made use of the burn.|$|E

5|$|The tolls are {{collected}} at a toll plaza located on Føyno. The plaza is constructed as a grade-separated intersection, {{so that any}} car passes through the plaza once.

Cars driving along E39 drive straight ahead through the plaza, while cars to or from Bømlo <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> interchange. There is also an intersection allowing access to the island. The plaza has six lanes, of which two in each direction have a toll booth and one in each direction has an automatic collection.

25|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} the discontinuation of PSP, the Chinese electronics company Lenkeng released a PSP to HDMI converter called the LKV-8000. The device {{is compatible with the}} PSP-2000, PSP-3000 and PSP GO, but the AV cable packaged with it requires an adapter to plug into the PSP GO's port. Instead of component RCA plugs, the PSP's YPbPr AV signal is carried through a D-sub 9 cable that screws into the converter box, which then converts the signal from analog to digital and upscales it to 720p through HDMI. Lenkeng also released a variant of the LKV-8000 with a button allowing the user to toggle between 720p and 1080p. To overcome the problems of PSP games being displayed in a small window surrounded by a black boarder, the LKV-8000 featured a Zoom button on the connector itself. This allowed players to fill screen natively, without any <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> television's zoom function. A few other Chinese companies have also released clones of this upscaler under different names, like the Pyle PSPHD42. The LKV-8000 and its variants have become popular among players and reviewers as the only means of playing and recording PSP gameplay in full screen.|$|E

More significantly, it was often based on different weight standards.|$|E
