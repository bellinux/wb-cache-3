5|$|Despite Nelson's {{fondness for}} the ship, she was {{frequently}} in <b>need</b> <b>of</b> <b>repair</b> and refitting, and {{would likely have}} been hulked or scrapped in 1802 had war with France not recommenced. She fought at the Battle of Trafalgar on 21 October 1805, as part of Nelson's weather column, where she forced the surrender of the Spanish four-decker Santísima Trinidad. Agamemnons later career was served in South American waters off Brazil.|$|E
5|$|According to an Iranian {{radio station}} report, 200 villages {{sustained}} severe damage or were totally destroyed. The United States Geological Survey estimated that 10,533houses were destroyed; an additional 5,474 homes sustained {{varying degrees of}} damage. Fifty thousand people were left homeless. Local officials initially estimated {{the cost of the}} damage at $67million 1997 US$ (roughly 89.5million 2008 USD). The estimate was later raised to 100million 1997 USD (roughly 133.6million 2008 USD). One hundred schools and many health centers in the stricken areas were discovered to be in <b>need</b> <b>of</b> <b>repair</b> work.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, the {{invasion}} threat from France had passed and a lasting peace {{was made in}} 1558; government concerns shifted away from the south coast towards the Spanish threat to the south-west of England. By 1569, when Thomas Carew was serving as Hurst's captain, there were less than ten guns but the same size of garrison to that seven years before. His son, Sir Thomas Gorges, became captain in turn, and in 1593 he reported that the castle's gun platforms were in serious <b>need</b> <b>of</b> <b>repair.</b>|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} World War II, Cedar Point {{was in need of}} {{financial}} help. The wood of the Cyclone roller coaster was rotting, the boardwalk was cracked in many places, and the fishing dock was in <b>need</b> <b>of</b> <b>repair.</b> In 1946, Cedar Point's oldest still-existing ride, the Midway Carousel, was installed. By 1951, the Cyclone coaster was razed because of its poor condition, leaving the resort without a roller coaster. As the Cyclone was being removed, the Laff-in-the-Dark, Rocket Ships, and Loop-A-Plane attractions were installed. Cedar Point Causeway was built in 1957, and is still in use. The president of Cedar Point, Bernie Zeiher, was replaced by George Roose around 1958, and Emile Legros was elected chairman that same year.|$|E
5|$|Convinced {{they would}} be killed if the Malagasy {{discovered}} the truth while still on board ship, the crew sealed their messages in bottles and dropped them into the onshore current. The VOC authorities in Cape Town had sent their chief ship's carpenter, Philip van den Berg, with two other ship's carpenters, two pilots, a quartermaster and 20 sailors overland. Carpenters were needed since neither of Meermin boats, now onshore, could be used: one {{was buried in the}} sand, and the other was in <b>need</b> <b>of</b> <b>repair.</b> The party from Cape Town had arrived by 6March, and, while Johannes Le Sueur was overseeing the carpenters' examination of Meermins boats, he was handed a bottle containing a message signed by Jan de Leeuw. A second bottle, containing a message signed by Olof Leij, was also found and handed to Le Sueur, and the fires were lit on 7March. One of the messages is preserved in the Cape Archives Repository.|$|E

5|$|In early February 1945, Admiral Scheer stood off Samland {{with several}} torpedo boats {{in support of}} German forces {{fighting}} Soviet advances. On 9 February, the ships began shelling Soviet positions. Between 18 and 24 February, German forces launched a local counterattack; Admiral Scheer and the torpedo boats provided artillery support, targeting Soviet positions near Peyse and Gross-Heydekrug. The German attack temporarily restored the land connection to Königsberg. The ship's guns were badly worn out by March and in <b>need</b> <b>of</b> <b>repair.</b> On 8 March, Admiral Scheer departed the eastern Baltic to have her guns relined in Kiel; she carried 800 civilian refugees and 200 wounded soldiers. An uncleared minefield prevented her from reaching Kiel, and so she unloaded her passengers in Swinemünde. Despite her worn-out gun barrels, the ship then shelled Soviet forces outside Kolberg until she used up her remaining ammunition.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the minor}} French squadrons that participated in the {{campaign}} was the force under Contre-Admiral Linois, who had sailed for the Indian Ocean with a ship {{of the line and}} four frigates in March 1803 during the Peace of Amiens. After brief stops at Puducherry and Île de France, Linois sailed on a raiding cruise to the South China Sea only to be driven off by a British merchant convoy at the Battle of Pulo Aura. Despite subsequent minor success against merchant ships, including the Battle of Vizagapatam, Linois's failure to inflict significant damage to British trade in the Far East enraged Napoleon, and in late 1805, with supplies running low and his ships in <b>need</b> <b>of</b> <b>repair,</b> Linois began the return journey to Europe with just his flagship and a single frigate remaining.|$|E
5|$|The Museum House is cast in Classical Revival {{style and}} was the last {{outbuilding}} constructed for Isaac Ellwood on the property. Today the Museum House's exterior appears {{much the same as}} it did when it was newly constructed but for many years the structure was badly deteriorated. After Harriet Ellwood died in 1910 the objects remained inside the building while it began to decline. By 1934 the building was in serious <b>need</b> <b>of</b> <b>repair</b> and by the 1970s both porches were gone and the only way into the building was through the north door. The museum house restoration was undertaken more than ten years later. Prior to the addition of the Visitors Center to the Carriage House, the Museum House served as the visitors center and housed staff offices.|$|E

5|$|Arguments soon {{broke out}} between the Crown and the {{corporation}} over the deal. The Crown argued that the corporation was not adequately maintaining the castle and blockhouses. The Earl of Sussex complained in 1569 {{that they were in}} <b>need</b> <b>of</b> <b>repair,</b> and a 1576 survey stated that their gun platforms were in poor condition and that the ditches had become clogged with earth, while coastal erosion had undermined the South Blockhouse. Queen Elizabeth I provided 300 trees to help the repair work and a new jetty was built to protect {{the southern end of the}} defences from the sea. The Crown gave 60 trees to the town to help with further repairs in 1581. Fears of a Spanish invasion resulted in fresh repairs being carried out, and the threat of the Armada in 1588 resulted in proposals to build additional earthworks around the blockhouses, but nothing appear to have actually been carried out. The dispute over maintenance between the Crown and the town finally came to court in 1588; the corporation argued that green timber had been used in the original construction work and claimed that they had spent £2,893 between 1552 and 1587 on the defences: the Crown's case failed.|$|E
5|$|Diarist Samuel Pepys {{commented on}} the {{condition}} of Rochester Castle, and as early as the 17thcentury the castle may have acted as a tourist attraction. By this time many castles were in a state of ruin, and Rochester was amongst those in <b>need</b> <b>of</b> <b>repair,</b> although still in use. In 1610 JamesI granted Sir Anthony Weldon control of the castle. During the English Civil War, Weldon declared for the Parliamentarian cause. The castle did not see fighting during the war, even though the city was captured by Royalists in 1648; this may indicate that the castle was not a serviceable fortification by this point. Weldon's support for the Parliamentarians may have spared the castle from slighting (demolition) in the aftermath, a fate shared by many other castles. Walker Weldon inherited the castle and carried out the destruction of part of the outer wall in the 18thcentury to sell off the building material; he had originally intended to dismantle more of the castle, but the plans were abandoned. A drawing from around this time suggests that the cross wall had been removed by this point. While other parts of the castle were dismantled, the two towers in the south-east wall were still being used for accommodation. In 1743 prisoners were held at the castle, probably in huts. Rochester Castle descended through the Weldon family until it was bequeathed to Thomas Blechynden in the 18thcentury. By 1774 Robert Child was in possession of the castle, and it remained in the possession of his family until 1884. There were unsuccessful plans in 1780 to reuse Rochester Castle as an army barracks, after the commander of the Royal Engineers for Chatham, Colonel Hugh Debbieg, asked the Child family for permission. The castle ruins inspired a painting by artist J. M. W. Turner in the late 18thcentury, one of his first oil paintings. Turner was renowned for his love of nature and was {{at the forefront of the}} picturesque movement, during which such ruins became fashionable.|$|E
5|$|The city soon {{experienced}} {{its most}} dire fiscal crisis yet, {{due to the}} stagnant economy of the early 1970s, combined with the massive outflow of city residents to the suburbs. The system was already in decline; the subway had seen a 40% decrease in ridership since 1947, and a $200 million subsidy for the MTA {{as well as a}} 1952 fare increase had not been enough to pay for basic upkeep for the subway system, let alone fund massive expansion projects like the Second Avenue Subway. When plans were finalized in 1971, the subway had been proposed for completion by 1980, but two years later, its completion date was forecast as 2000. In October 1974, the MTA chairman, David Yunich, announced that the completion of the line north of 42nd Street was pushed back to 1983 and the portion to the south in 1988. On December 13, 1974, New York City mayor Abraham Beame proposed a six-year transit construction program that would reallocate $5.1 billion of funding from the Second Avenue Line to complete new lines in Queens and to modernize the existing infrastructure, which was rapidly deteriorating and in dire <b>need</b> <b>of</b> <b>repair.</b> Beame issued a stop-work order for the line in September 1975, whereupon construction of the section between Second and Ninth Streets was halted, and no other funding was allocated to the line's construction. Besides the Chrystie Street Connection, only three sections of tunnel had been completed; these tunnels were sealed.|$|E
