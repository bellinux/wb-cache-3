5|$|In mid-1945, {{after the}} end of World War II in Europe, he was in Germany with the U. S. Strategic Bombing Survey, {{studying}} the effects of Allied bombing on German morale, an experience that affected his postwar work as his visit to Spain had affected him earlier. On his return, he settled in Manhattan, working as a freelance writer, a lecturer at The New School for Social Research, and a visiting professor at Bennington, Smith, and other American colleges. In 1946 he became a <b>naturalised</b> <b>citizen</b> of the US.|$|E
5|$|Born in Ningbo in 1964, Gui {{graduated}} from Peking University with a bachelor's degree in history in 1985. Gui served as editor to the People's Education Press until 1988, when he departed for Sweden, and {{enrolled in a}} doctoral program at the University of Gothenburg. After the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, he obtained Swedish residency, and later became a <b>naturalised</b> <b>citizen</b> of Sweden, upon which he renounced his Chinese citizenship. According to his daughter, he was attracted to the beauty of his adopted country and the freedom he felt living there. Gui obtained his PhD in 1996. Gui's wife is also a naturalised Swedish citizen; the couple's daughter was born in 1994.|$|E

5|$|The first {{recipients}} of the Bharat Ratna were politician C. Rajagopalachari, philosopher Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan, and scientist C. V. Raman, who were honoured in 1954. Since then, the award has been bestowed upon 45 individuals, including 12 who were awarded posthumously. The original statutes did not provide for posthumous awards but were amended in January 1955 to permit them. The former Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri became the first individual to be honoured posthumously. In 2014, cricketer Sachin Tendulkar, then aged 40, became the youngest recipient; while social reformer Dhondo Keshav Karve was awarded on his 100th birthday. Though usually conferred on India-born citizens, the Bharat Ratna has been awarded to one <b>naturalised</b> <b>citizen,</b> Mother Teresa, and to two non-Indians, Pakistan national Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan and former South African President Nelson Mandela. On 24 December 2014, the Indian government announced the award to independence activist Madan Mohan Malaviya (posthumously) and former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee.|$|E
25|$|In 1785, Catherine {{declared}} Jews to be officially foreigners, with foreigners’ rights.

Catherine’s decree also denied Jews {{the rights of}} an Orthodox or <b>naturalised</b> <b>citizen</b> of Russia. Taxes doubled again for those of Jewish descent in 1794, and Catherine officially declared that Jews bore no relation to Russians.|$|E
25|$|Benjamin {{spent the}} 1980 English season playing for Bedfordshire in the Minor Counties Championship, a spell which {{included}} two half-centuries (against Buckinghamshire and Shropshire). His best {{figures in the}} competition, 6/85, came against Suffolk in both teams' last match of the season, which {{was not enough to}} prevent a one-wicket loss after Suffolk's final three batsmen put on 89 runs (including 53 not out from Colin Rutterford). During the 1981–82 Sheffield Shield season, Benjamin played a single match for Tasmania, bowling 23 overs without taking a wicket. Remaining in Australia, he had a long career for the Ulverstone Cricket Club at grade cricket level, and became a <b>naturalised</b> <b>citizen</b> of Australia in 1991. A resident of Leith (near Ulverstone), Benjamin unsuccessfully contested the Division of Braddon for the Tasmanian branch of the National Party at the 2014 state election. He received 0.79% of first preference votes, while the party's candidates collectively received 2.16% on first preferences.|$|E

25|$|The leading {{figure in}} British {{music of the}} early 18th century was a {{naturalized}} Briton, George Frideric Handel (1685–1759). Although {{he was born in}} Germany, he first visited England in 1710, later moving there and becoming a <b>naturalised</b> <b>citizen,</b> playing a defining role in the music of the British Isles. Handel drew heavily on the continental, particularly Italian, Baroque style, but was also highly influenced by English composers such as Purcell. He was a prolific composer, producing major orchestral works such as the Water Music, and the Music for the Royal Fireworks. His opera, including Rinaldo (1711, 1731), Orlando (1733), Ariodante (1735), Alcina (1735) and Serse (1738, also known as Xerxes), helped make Britain second only to Italy as a centre of operatic production. His sacred drama and choral music, particularly the coronation anthem Zadok the Priest (written for the inauguration of George II in 1727) which has remained part of the ceremony for British monarchs, and above all, the Messiah, helped set the British taste in music for the next 200 years. He was a major influence on future classical composers including Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven.|$|E

60|$|And again, {{the whole}} {{argument}} {{is based upon}} the narrow racial supposition that every <b>naturalised</b> <b>citizen</b> not of Boer extraction must necessarily be unpatriotic. This is not borne out by the examples of history. The new-comer soon becomes as proud of his country and as jealous of her liberty as the old. Had President Kruger given the franchise generously to the Uitlander, his pyramid would have been firm upon its base and not balanced upon its apex. It is true that the corrupt oligarchy would have vanished, and the spirit of a broader, more tolerant freedom influenced the counsels of the State. But the republic would have become stronger and more permanent with a population who, if they differed in details, were united in essentials. Whether such a solution would have been to the advantage of British interests in South Africa is quite another question. In more ways than one President Kruger has been a good friend to the Empire.|$|E
