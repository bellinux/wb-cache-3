Representational systems were significantly correlated with developmental processes, but drawing developed faster than letters or numbers with respect to both their production and their classification. Three-year-old children were able to recognize each system correctly in a sample-matching task, but the recognition of each system was not correlated with representational activity. These findings indicate that only after children engaged in graphic production did they begin to make representational distinctions among systems by drawing on their domain-specific knowledge, although alternative explanations can be suggested...|$|E

This study examined young children’s (4 - to 6 -yearolds, N = 172) understanding of place value prior to explicit schooling by asking them write spoken numbers (e. g., “six hundred and forty-two”). Children’s attempts often consisted of “expansions ” in which the proper digits were written in order but with 0 s or other insertions marking place (e. g., “ 600402 ” or “ 610042 ”). This partial knowledge increased with age. Gender differences were also observed with older boys more likely than older girls to produce the conventional form (e. g., 642).

40|$|Reading and {{spelling}} performance {{have a significant}} correlation with number transcoding, which {{is the ability to}} establish a relationship between the verbal and Arabic representations of numbers, when a conversion of numerical symbols from one notation to the other is necessary. The aim of the present study is to reveal shared and specific mechanisms involved in reading and writing words and Arabic numerals in Brazilian school-aged children. One hundred and seventy two children from 2 nd to 4 th grades were evaluated. All of them had normal intelligence. We conducted a series of hierarchical regression models using scores on word spelling and reading single words and Arabic numerals, as dependent variables. As predictor variables we investigated intelligence, the phonological and visuospatial components of working memory and phonemic awareness. All of the writing and reading tasks (single word spelling and reading as well as number reading and <b>number</b> <b>writing)</b> were significantly correlated to each other. In the regressions models, phonological working memory was specifically associated to word reading. Phonemic awareness was the only cognitive variables that systematically predicted all of the school skills investigated, both numerical and word tasks. This suggests that phonemic awareness is a modular cognitive ability shared by several school tasks and might be an important factor associated to the comorbidity between dyslexia and dyscalculia...|$|E
40|$|The {{current study}} {{reports on the}} {{validation}} of the Cantonese version of the Oxford Cognitive Screen (HK-OCS). Seventy native Cantonese-speaking neurologically healthy individuals were recruited to establish the normative data. Forty six native Cantonese-speaking stroke survivors were assessed on the Cantonese version of the HK-OCS, the Cantonese version of the Western Aphasia Battery, the Cantonese version of Mini-Mental State Examination, the Hong Kong Montreal Cognitive Assessment, the short test of gestural production, the Albert’s Test of Visual Neglect, the Chinese version of the Modified Barthel Index, and the Hong Kong Chinese version of Lawton Instrumental Activities of Daily Living scale. Validity of the HK-OCS was appraised by {{the difference between the}} two groups and relationship of these tasks. Paired-sample t-tests showed that neurologically healthy individuals performed significantly better than stroke survivors on the HK-OCS. Positive and significant correlations across related cognitive subtests in other tests were found, suggesting good concurrent validity. Excellent intra-rater and inter-rater reliabilities, fair test-retest reliability, and acceptable internal consistency indicated that the HK-OCS had good reliability. Regarding the predictive values of the HK-OCS, semantics, episodic memory, <b>number</b> <b>writing</b> and orientation best predicted survivors’ functional outcomes.

40|$|The pr~blem. Inaccurate {{diagnosis}} of brain damaged and non-braln-damaged subjects when utilizing sensory perceptual examinations {{may be due}} to a lack of standard-ized administration procedures. The purpose of this study is to provide validation data for the Reitan-Klove Examination and evaluate an alternative standardized testing procedure which is based on subtests similar to the Reitan-Klove Examination. Procedure. Von Frey hairs, tuning forks, calipers, wire numbers, and raised designs were used for standardiza-tion. The control group consisted of 11 male and 23 female hospital staff members with a mean age of 40 years. The experimental group consisted of one female and 33 male brain-damaged patients with a mean age of 49 years. Findings. The procedures were compared on the occurrence of false positives and false negatives. Both procedures yielded no false positives and a small incidence (6 %) of false negatives; both procedures were valid. Sub-tests involving the same variables were then compared.

30|$|Inter-rater {{agreement}} was analyzed {{based on the}} frequency of each answer. Agreement mean rates ranged from 95 (items of first through fifth year) to 100  % (sixth through ninth year) on the first question, 91 (1 – 5  years) to 97  % (6 – 9  years) in the second, and 67 to 81  % in the third question (among judges responsible for grades 1 through 5 and 6 through 9, respectively). The lowest rates of agreement were observed {{in the assessment of}} item difficulty. This may be explained by a lack of standardized teaching practices, especially {{in the first years of}} primary education. We analyzed inter-rater agreement based on the content validity index (Alexander and Coluci, 2011). We chose to maintain items with 100  % inter-rater agreement on the first two questions. In relation to item difficulty, we selected items that obtained inter-rater agreement from at least two judges on the level of difficulty (66  %), since difficulty level would be also assessed empirically though the item response theory (IRT) in the second study. The maintained 133 items were evaluated by a graduate professor of mathematics education with 30  years of professional experience. This procedure aimed to assess the importance and frequency of the contents, as recommended by the Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing (2014 edition) (American Education Research Association et al. 2014). The expert reanalyzed the items to confirm their relevance to the contents covered between grades 1 and 9. Based on redundancy criterion, he excluded 29 items that assess the same content and level of difficulty and suggested two new items to address any gaps in skill level. Items were placed in theoretical ascending order of difficulty. This version included Arabic <b>number</b> <b>writing</b> to the exponentiation and radicals operations, mean of nine items for each school year, yielding a preliminary version of the Arithmetic Subtest of the TDE-II containing a total of 102 items.|$|E
40|$|Background Stroke-induced {{cognitive}} impairments are critical predictors of poor functional outcomes. They adversely affect recovery and reduce independent performance of basic {{activities of daily}} living (ADL) and instrumental ADL (Zinn et al., 2004). Choices of cognitive assessment tools specific to the Cantonese speaking stroke population in Hong Kong are limited. The Cantonese version of the Western Aphasia Battery (Cantonese-WAB) was specifically developed for examining language impairments. The Cantonese version of MMSE (Cantonese-MMSE) and Hong Kong Montreal Cognitive Assessment (HK-MoCA), designed to detect cognitive deficits associated with dementia, lacked important measures of writing, neglect, and praxis where impairments were commonly found in stroke. More critically, most tasks in these two screeners required relatively intact auditory comprehension and verbal responses from participants. Presence of aphasia can, therefore, lead to underestimation of cognitive abilities. Aims Extending Chan et al. ’s (2013) development of a Cantonese version of the Birmingham Cognitive Screen (BCoS) to be used in Hong Kong, our first aim was to validate the Oxford Cognitive Screen (OCS), built on similar principles to the BCoS test but is shorter (15 minutes) and can be used in acute settings, for Cantonese-speaking stroke survivors. This tool, including assessment of aphasia, apraxia, attention, memory, and spatial neglect, was designed to be neglect- and aphasia-friendly by using multi-modal presentation, forced-choice testing procedures, and vertical layouts. The second aim was to determine which cognitive domain(s) in HK-OCS would best predict functional outcomes. Procedures Seventy normal individuals were recruited to establish the normative data of HK-OCS. Norm was developed for three age groups (59 years). Direct percentile conversions for each sub-test scores were used and cut-off scores were set at the top 5 th percentile. Forty six native Cantonese-speaking stroke participants (aged 21 - 83 years; 72 % left hemispheric stroke) participated and received a short test of gestural production (Goldenberg, 1996), Albert’s test of visual neglect, Chinese version of the Modified Barthel Index, and Hong Kong Chinese version of Lawton Instrumental Activities of Daily Living scale, Cantonese-WAB, Cantonese-MMSE, HK-MoCA, and HK-OCS. Results Cut-off scores for most HK-OCS sections were comparable across the three age groups. Paired-sample t-tests revealed the stroke group achieved significantly lower scores across most sections than matched controls. The tool demonstrated strong concurrent validity with positive and significant correlations across related cognitive subtests in other batteries (Table 1). The HK-OCS also had excellent intra-rater and inter-rater, good test-retest reliability, and acceptable internal consistency. Regarding its predictive values on functional outcomes, while semantics and episodic memory best predicted basic ADL, <b>number</b> <b>writing</b> and orientation best predicted complex ADL. <br/...|$|E
