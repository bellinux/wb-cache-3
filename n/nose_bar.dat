5000|$|After Neo knocks Smith {{into the}} crater {{in the level}} [...] "Aerial Battle", Smith is sent flying through the ground and up through the street. As Neo relaxes, the {{surrounding}} Smiths {{walk away from the}} crater. Neo gets out of the crater, and dodges a car which flies through the air and lands in a pile of debris. Neo looks on as Smiths tear up chunks of the road and throw cars into this pile. A truck then speeds into a building and blows it up. Smiths can be seen holding the debris together as it takes on a thirty-story tall humanoid form which is then struck by lightning, powering it up. Neo flies up to watch as the giant humanoid lowers its head onto its shoulders. The giant Smith then pulls a pair of giant Smith Shades from a billboard and puts them on. As an interesting aside, the glasses on the billboard are the same ones Agent Smith wore in the first Matrix film, with the curved <b>nose</b> <b>bar,</b> but when the MegaSmith actually puts them on, they become the ones Agent Smith wears in The Matrix Reloaded and in Revolutions.|$|E
30|$|It {{is worth}} noting that the log {{preheating}} and peeling settings in this study were optimised for radiata pine. Acevedo et al. (2012) reported that better quality veneers were obtained from E. nitens by adjusting <b>nose</b> <b>bar</b> pressure and peeling knife angle.|$|E
40|$|The 6 -hydroxydopamine (6 -OHDA) lesion is {{the most}} widely used rat model of Parkinson's disease. A single {{unilateral}} injection of 6 -OHDA into the median forebrain bundle (MFB) selectively destroys dopamine neurons in the ipsilateral substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) and ventral tegmental area (VTA), removing more than 95 % of the dopamine innervation from target areas. The stereotaxic coordinates used to deliver 6 -OHDA to the MFB have been used in our laboratory successfully for more than 25 years. However, in recent years we have observed a decline in the success rate of this lesion. Previously regular success rates of > 80 % of rats lesioned, have become progressively more variable, with rates as low as 20 % recorded in some experiments. Having excluded variability of the neurotoxin and operator errors, we hypothesized that the change seen might be due to the use of smaller rats at the time of first surgery. An attempt to proportionally adjust the lesion coordinates base on head size did not increase lesion efficacy. However, in support of the small rat hypothesis it was observed that, using the standard coordinates, rat's heads had a “nose-up” position in the stereotaxic fame. Adjustment of the <b>nose</b> <b>bar</b> to obtain a flat head position during surgery improved lesion success, and subsequent adjustments of the lesion coordinates to account for smaller head size led to a greatly increased lesion efficacy (> 90 %) as assessed by amphetamine induced rotation...|$|E

50|$|These {{bars are}} solid steel bars {{intended}} for professional use. They have commonly an exchangeable nose since the sprocket at the <b>bar</b> <b>nose</b> wears out {{faster than the}} bar.|$|R
5|$|Some teams made {{technical}} {{changes to}} their cars for the Grand Prix. McLaren introduced a revised aerodynamic for their MP4/15 chassis, aimed at {{increasing the amount}} of downforce, and therefore grip, produced by the bodywork. They also brought revised <b>nose</b> wings. <b>BAR</b> fitted their cars with one-off components that were produced to help optimise the performance of the monocoque's cooling systems. Ferrari introduced an aerodynamic set-up similar to that used at the Monaco Grand Prix, and the team debuted {{a modified version of the}} F1-2000's chimneys. Minardi arrived with new radiator intakes and exits to rectify temperature issues with their Fondmetal V10 engines.|$|R
50|$|When {{turning the}} screw, a hook {{in a bar}} hole moves the bar either out (tensioning) or in, making the chain loose. Tension is right when it can be moved easily by hand and not hanging loose from the bar. When tensioning, hold the <b>bar</b> <b>nose</b> up and pull the bar nuts tight. Otherwise the chain might derail.|$|R
50|$|The oil {{is pumped}} {{from a small}} pump to {{a hole in the}} bar. From here the lower ends of each chain drive link take a portion of the oil into the gauge towards the <b>bar</b> <b>nose.</b> Pump outlet and bar hole must be aligned. Since the bar is moving out and inwards {{depending}} on the chain length, the oil outlet on the saw side has a banana style long shape.|$|R
60|$|As if the {{repetition}} of his name settled his own doubts, he leaped toward the gate and thrust a pink <b>nose</b> between the <b>bars,</b> with a howl of recognition as Betty's face was more clearly seen. The boys tumbled precipitately from their perches, {{and the little girl}} fell back alarmed, yet could not bear to run away and leave those imploring eyes pleading to her through the bars so eloquently.|$|R
50|$|On August 17, 2005, Tynes {{turned himself}} into Pierce County, Wisconsin jail after {{punching}} a bar patron and breaking a bouncer's <b>nose</b> in a <b>bar</b> fight the previous weekend (the Chiefs' training camp {{at the time}} was based out of River Falls). Tynes was charged with one felony count of substantial battery and one count of misdemeanor battery. He was released on a $15,000 signature bond. Tynes paid a $397 fine for the incident.|$|R
6000|$|Daisy pinched his <b>nose</b> {{through the}} <b>bars,</b> and {{the meeting was}} rather tumultuous for a moment, for Emil called: 'Avast, avast, here's a squall to wind'ard'; Tom applauded wildly; Dan looked up as if the {{prospect}} of a fight, even with words, pleased him, and Nat went to support Demi, as his position seemed to be a good one. At this crisis, when everyone laughed and talked at once, Bess came floating through the upper hall and looked down like an angel of peace upon the noisy group below, as she asked, with wondering eyes and smiling lips: ...|$|R
30|$|Mice were anaesthetized using Chloral hydrate {{and placed}} into a {{stereotactic}} frame with <b>nose</b> and ear <b>bars</b> specially adapted for mice. 6 -OHDA was dissolved at {{a concentration of}} 3  μg/μL saline in 0.1 % ascorbic acid and injected at final dosages 5.4  μg. The lesion was performed using a Hamilton syringe at the following coordinates: AP: − 2.9  mm; ML: + 1.3  mm; DV: − 4.6  mm. The injection was conducted {{at a rate of}} 0.2  μL/min and the needle was left in place for another 5  min after the injection before it was slowly drawn back. Wound healing and recovery were monitored after the injection was done.|$|R
60|$|The chauffeur {{started the}} car off again. What with the shock I had had and the luxury of riding in a motor-car, I was a little distrait, and I could not say how far we went. But {{it must have been}} miles and miles, for it seemed a long time {{afterwards}} that we stopped at the biggest house I have ever seen. There were smooth lawns and flower-beds, and men in overalls, and fountains and trees, and, away to the right, kennels with about a million dogs in them, all pushing their <b>noses</b> through the <b>bars</b> and shouting. They all wanted to know who I was and what prizes I had won, and then I realized that I was moving in high society.|$|R
60|$|And, after all, that warming glow is {{more suited}} to our cold little back parlor of a world than is the burning spirit love. Love should be the vestal fire of some mighty temple--some vast dim fane whose organ music is the rolling of the spheres. Affection will burn cheerily when the white flame of love is flickered out. Affection is a fire that can be fed {{from day to day}} and be piled up ever higher as the wintry years draw nigh. Old men and women can sit by it with their thin hands clasped, the little {{children}} can nestle down in front, the friend and neighbor has his welcome corner by its side, and even shaggy Fido and sleek Titty can toast their <b>noses</b> at the <b>bars.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The Royal Australian Air Force {{purchased}} 57 F/A-18A {{fighters and}} 18 F/A-18B two-seat trainers to replace its Dassault Mirage IIIOs. [...] Numerous options were {{considered for the}} replacement, notably the F-15A Eagle, the F-16 Falcon, and the then new F/A-18 Hornet. The F-15 was discounted because the version offered had no ground-attack capability. The F-16 was considered unsuitable largely due to having only one engine. [...] Australia selected the F/A-18 in October 1981. [...] Original differences between the Australian and US Navy's standard F/A-18 were the removed <b>nose</b> wheel tie <b>bar</b> for catapult launch (later re-fitted with a dummy version to remove nose wheel shimmy), addition of a high frequency radio, an Australian fatigue data analysis system, an improved video and voice recorder, {{and the use of}} ILS/VOR (Instrument Landing System/Very High Frequency Omnidirectional Range) instead of the carrier landing system.|$|R
5000|$|One {{letter to}} the then dean {{of the law school}} read: [...] "I have no problem with naming the law school in honor of an {{appropriate}} person, as other colleges have done, but naming our college after Fred Levin does no honor to him, to the institution, or its constituency, and demeans the efforts of the many deans, faculty, and alumni who have worked for so many years to achieve the vision of making our college one of the top twenty law schools[...] [...] [...] You degraded the image and prestige of the University of Florida College of Law by selling its good name to Fred Levin, a lawyer who has been castigated by the courts for abusing the rules, and is notorious for commercializing the practice, thumbing his <b>nose</b> at the <b>bar,</b> and otherwise manipulating the system." [...] In response, Levin told the press: [...] "Two hundred years from now the great, great, great grandchildren (of my critics) will be getting their law degrees from a school with my name on it. It's a good feeling." [...] "It makes me feel great, when their great-grandchildren go up to that stage to get the law degree, they'll know that, dadgum it, that Jew's name is up there on the damn diploma. It's just gotta eat at them." ...|$|R
60|$|Well, you know, {{when you}} perspire that way, in rivers, {{there comes a}} time when you--when you--well, when you itch. You are inside, your hands are outside; so there you are; nothing but iron between. It is not a light thing, let it sound as it may. First it is one place; then another; then some more; and it goes on {{spreading}} and spreading, and at last the territory is all occupied, and nobody can imagine what you feel like, nor how unpleasant it is. And when it had got to the worst, and it seemed to me that I could not stand anything more, a fly got in through the bars and settled on my <b>nose,</b> and the <b>bars</b> were stuck and wouldn't work, and I couldn't get the visor up; and I could only shake my head, which was baking hot by this time, and the fly--well, you know how a fly acts when he has got a certainty--he only minded the shaking enough to change from nose to lip, and lip to ear, and buzz and buzz all around in there, and keep on lighting and biting, in a way that a person, already so distressed as I was, simply could not stand. So I gave in, and got Alisande to unship the helmet and relieve me of it. Then she emptied the conveniences out of it and fetched it full of water, and I drank and then stood up, and she poured the rest down inside the armor. One cannot think how refreshing it was. She continued to fetch and pour until I was well soaked and thoroughly comfortable.|$|R
