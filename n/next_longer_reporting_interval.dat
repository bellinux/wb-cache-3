30|$|This LCS {{modification}} for CIoT affects {{both the}} real-time and non-real-time forensic localization. In {{the case of}} immediate localization, the LEA has {{no option but to}} accommodate to this delay. In the case of periodic localization, the LEA might need to use a larger reporting granularity (fewer <b>reports</b> and a <b>longer</b> <b>report</b> <b>interval)</b> to be able to track the location of a CIoT device over a prolonged period of time. For the enhanced location for IRI localization, the LEA also needs to expect delayed and out-of-order reports, given that many of the target identities will respond to the localization requests in a prolonged and uncoordinated manner.|$|R
40|$|The <b>reporting</b> <b>interval</b> of {{infectious}} diseases is often determined as a time unit in the calendar regardless of the epidemiological characteristics of the disease. No guidelines have been proposed to choose the <b>reporting</b> <b>interval</b> {{of infectious}} diseases. The present study aims at translating coarsely reported epidemic data into the reproduction number and clarifying the ideal <b>reporting</b> <b>interval</b> to offer detailed insights into {{the time course of}} an epidemic. We briefly revisit the dispersibility ratio, i. e. ratio of cases in successive <b>reporting</b> <b>intervals,</b> proposed by Clare Oswald Stallybrass, detecting technical flaws in the historical studies. We derive a corrected expression for this quantity and propose simple algorithms to estimate the effective reproduction number as a function of time, adjusting the <b>reporting</b> <b>interval</b> to the generation time of a disease and demonstrating a clear relationship among the generation-time distribution, <b>reporting</b> <b>interval</b> and growth rate of an epidemic. Our exercise suggests that an ideal <b>reporting</b> <b>interval</b> is the mean generation time, so that the ratio of cases in successive intervals can yield the reproduction number. When it is impractical to report observations every mean generation time, we also present an alternative method that enables us to obtain straightforward estimates of the reproduction number for any <b>reporting</b> <b>interval</b> that suits the practical purpose of infection control. © 2009 The Royal Society. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|To {{study the}} effects of parental HLA sharing on {{pregnancy}} outcome, we initiated population-based studies in the Hutterites. We previously <b>reported</b> <b>longer</b> <b>intervals</b> from marriage to each birth among couples sharing HLA, particularly HLA-DR. In the present report, we present the results of a prospective, 5 -year study of fecundability and fetal loss rates in this population. Between April 1986 and April 1991, 154 pregnancies were observed in 104 couples. The median number of months of unprotected intercourse to a positive pregnancy test was significantly longer among couples sharing HLA-DR who stopped nursing prior to the first menses as compared with couples not sharing HLA-DR who stopped nursing prior to the first menses (5. 1 vs. 2. 0 mo, respectively; P =. 016). Fetal loss rates were increased among couples sharing HLA-B as compared with couples not sharing HLA-B (. 23 vs.. 12, respectively; P =. 041, adjusted for age, gravidity, and kinship). These data suggest that our earlier observations of increased birth interval lengths among Hutterite couples sharing HLA were predominantly due to longer intervals until a clinical pregnancy among couples sharing HLA-DR and, to a lesser degree, were due to increased fetal loss rates among couples sharing HLA-B...|$|R

30|$|Part b of Fig.  14 {{shows the}} {{expected}} battery lifetime for different <b>report</b> <b>intervals</b> {{and for a}} different number of days in Secure Transport Mode (STP). The STP-mode is most energy-consuming because the <b>reporting</b> <b>interval</b> will be highest and also the door sensor needs to be monitored. We can conclude that in case a battery lifetime of 1 – 3 years is desired, either the <b>report</b> <b>interval</b> {{or the number of}} days in STP must be limited. Since the number of days in STP is dependent on the usage of the container, the only possibility is to let the <b>report</b> <b>interval</b> vary based on the value of the cargo and the days already spent in STP. Considering the same example as above, the number of days in STP could almost double when two tracking devices share their UMTS/GPRS/GPS.|$|R

40|$|Background: Measurement {{uncertainty}} (MU) estimates {{can be used}} by clinicians in result interpretation for {{diagnosis and}} monitoring and by laboratories in assessing assay fitness for use and analytical troubleshooting. However, MU is not routinely used to assess the appropriateness of the analyte <b>reporting</b> <b>interval.</b> We describe the relationship between MU and the analyte <b>reporting</b> <b>interval.</b> Methods and results: The <b>reporting</b> <b>interval</b> R is the smallest unit of measurement chosen for clinical reporting. When choosing the appropriate value for R, it is necessary that the reference change values and expanded MU values can be meaningfully calculated. Expanded MU provides the tighter criterion for defining an upper limit for R. This limit can be determined as R 4 k SDa/ 1. 9, where SDa is the analytical standard deviation and k is the coverage factor (usually 2). Conclusion: Using MU estimates to determine the <b>reporting</b> <b>interval</b> for quantitative laboratory results ensures that reporting practices match local analytical performance and recognizes the inherent error of the measurement process...|$|R

We present a model for the estimation of the maximum number of specimens for reference interval studies based on setting the 90 % confidence interval of the reference limits to be equal to the analyte <b>reporting</b> <b>interval.</b> Methods: Equations describing the bounds on the upper and lower 90 % confidence intervals for logarithmically transformed and untransformed data were derived and applied to determine the maximum number of specimens required to calculate a reference interval for 12 common chemistry and hematology analytes.
