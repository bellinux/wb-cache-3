40|$|The use {{of trade}} {{measures}} to combat illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) {{fishing in the}} Northeast Atlantic has evolved from unilateral denial of the landing of fish taken outside international quota arrangements to a multilateral Scheme of Control and Enforcement under the North-East Atlantic Fisheries Commission (<b>NEAFC).</b> International trade rules have not constrained this development, mostly due to successful management of the interplay between international resource management and trade regimes. States protect resource management objectives from such constraint by inserting clauses that establish a normative hierarchy, or they employ various means for adapting IUU measures to the 'environmental window' of the global trade regime. The fact that regional states have introduced trade restrictions only when non-restrictive or less restrictive measures have failed enhances such compatibility, as do the gradual shift from unilateral to multilateral measures and the rise in transparency, openness and target-state involvement.

40|$|The European Union (EU) and Faroe Islands, a small self-governing {{archipelago}} {{under the}} sovereignty of Denmark, both belong to the North-East Atlantic Fisheries Commission (<b>NEAFC).</b> <b>NEAFC</b> is a regional fisheries management organisation (RFMO) {{which is responsible for}} the management of, inter alia, Atlanto-Scandian herring. <b>NEAFC</b> parties have a long-term management plan in place for Atlanto-Scandian herring. Based on recommendations from the International Council for the Exploration of Seas (ICES) the parties set a total allowable catch (TAC) for the herring and divide this among the contracting parties each year. At the 2012 consultations between the <b>NEAFC</b> parties the Faroe Islands requested a larger share of the TAC. The Faroe Islands left the consultations after the other parties repeatedly refused this request. It was granted a share of the TAC by the other four states in its absence. It then set its own catch quota far above this allocated share. In response the EU put in place port state measures to prevent Atlanto-Scandian herring from entering the EU. This included an import ban and a ban on the use of EU ports by Faroese vessels. The EU took this action under Council Regulation (EC) No. 1026 / 2012 (Shared Stocks Regulation) which allows measures to be imposed against third countries that allow non-sustainable fishing of common or straddling stocks. This includes measures taken against RFMO partners for non-compliance with RMFO laws, as RFMOs are generally set up to conserve straddling fish stocks. This Regulation was promulgated in line with a number of multilateral environmental agreements (MEAs) such as UNCLOS and the United Nations Fish Stocks Agreement (UNFSA). The Faroe Islands challenged the Shared Stocks Regulation and the specific Implementing Regulation imposing the port state measures in both the World Trade Organisation (WTO) and a Tribunal constituted under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). However the matter was settled before either of these tribunals could hear the case. The dissertation interrogates whether the EU Regulations are consistent with WTO law, specifically the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), using the facts of the Atlanto-Scandian herring dispute. Chapter I sets out the background to the dispute, and explains the concepts of illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing, and port state measures. Chapters II and III of the dissertation consider the consistency of the EU Regulations with the GATT. Chapter II finds that the EU Regulations contravene one or more of Articles I, V and XI of the GATT (the substantive provisions). Chapter III considers whether these measures, having contravened one of the GATT substantive provisions, may be justified under Article XX of the GATT (the exceptions provision). Chapter III concludes that, although well-crafted, the EU Regulations may still not be justifiable under the Article XX Chapeau in the particular circumstances of the herring dispute, based on principles in previous WTO cases. Chapter IV considers the relationship between multilateral environmental agreements (MEAs) relevant to IUU fishing and WTO agreements, to determine whether the EU Regulations could be considered GATT-consistent by reference to these MEAs or whether the MEAs could override WTO law.

In order to trace the distribution and migration of winter herring R. V. "Johan Hjort" (6 January— 2 February and 2 — 13 March) and M. S. «Havdrøn» (10 — 20 January) were used.

The purse seiners were allowed to fish for biological sampling according to instruction given by the Director of fisheries. However, no herring were recorded with sonar and echo sounder, and the purse seiners did not catch any herring. It was concluded that only insignificant number of adult herring approached the Norwegian coast for spawning in 1972.

Therefore, this paper presents the ECOVUL/ARPA Interdisciplinary Approach, {{a case study of}} methodology for the identification of VME/Hs in order to advise on conservation measures such as marine protected areas (MPAs). By means of an interactive process involving Conventional Fisheries Science, Geomorphology, Sedimentology and Benthic Ecology, the methodology developed under the ECOVUL/ARPA project, has been useful in order to contribute to define practical criteria to the identification of VME/Hs, to improve the knowledge about VME/Hs distribution and the adverse impacts of bottom trawl fisheries and to produce high quality advice on habitat protection. Applying an interdisciplinary approach, the project identified the deep-water bottom trawl fishery footprint on the Hatton Bank Western slope (<b>NEAFC</b> Regulatory Area), mapped the main fishing grounds and related seabed habitats and studied the interactions between fishing and cold-water corals.

40|$|While most {{commercial}} fisheries in the North Atlantic are strictly regulated through total allowable quotas, licenses and vessel quotas {{to limit the}} catch rates, the fishing for blue whiting represents an exception. Today, the blue whiting fishery is out of control; catch rates far exceed what the management authorities propose for a sustainable fishery {{and there is a}} real danger for collapse of the stock. The driving force in this development refers {{to the fact that the}} coastal states that are involved in the blue whiting fisheries, are not able to agree on the distribution of the migrating blue whiting stock. In Norway, the strong increase in both catch capacity and catch rates, also refers to a liberalization of the institutional framework for the renewal and design of new vessels, but also to structural politics concerning the ocean-going fishing vessels. This article presents the management conflict within the international fisheries for blue whiting and the driving forces behind the capacity increase in the Norwegian blue whiting fleet. However, a future agreement among the coastal nations within the framework of a sustainable fishery, inefficient overcapacity emerges when total quotas and allocation are put on the agenda. This results in allocation conflicts at different management levels that prevent a future solution.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{fisheries}} management is to provide the conditions for long-term, high and sustainable fishing. Most of the fish stocks in the North-East Atlantic's are transboundary and straddling, and some international agreements {{in the field of}} regulation of their fishing are required for effective management. Achieving multilateral international agreements in the field of fisheries is very difficult and long-term process, because it affects the economic and political interests of the contracting parties. The paper considers results of the analysis of stock dynamics of the most important fishery resources in the North-East Atlantic – herring, blue whiting and mackerel – in different historical periods. As in the past few decades, we have seen periods of both managed and unmanaged fisheries and in relation to the value of stocks of pelagic fish there have been significant fluctuations, in this paper the authors have attempted to estimate the value of concerted international fisheries management to maintain a stable state of stocks of pelagic fish. Implementation of scientific recommendations agreed by the participating countries of ICES and the joint management of the herring stock management contribute to the preservation of stock stable and optimal levels of withdrawal of the object. The historical experience of the international fishing of blue whiting has shown that compliance by states involved in the fishery advice of ICES and its reserve management activities and promotes the good stock condition. To save the mackerel stock within safe biological boundaries it is necessary to achieve the agreed long-term plan for managing its fisheries between all participants in the fishery. In the long term for the conservation of stocks of herring, blue whiting and North East mackerel in the safe biological boundaries, the international regulation of their fisheries based on the scientific recommendations of ICES in the framework of <b>NEAFC</b> and the Consultations of Coastal States is necessary...|$|E
40|$|Since 2005, {{by-catch}} of vulnerable invertebrates, such as cold-water corals {{and large}} sponges, {{has been studied}} with special attention in the Spanish/EU bottom trawl groundfish surveys in Northwest Atlantic (NAFO Divs. 3 LMNO). Based on this research, twenty-nine different taxa of cold-water corals have been preliminarily identified in the study area: five alcyonaceans, ten gorgonaceans, ten pennatulaceans, three solitary scleractinians and one antipatharian. No colonial scleractinians were recorded during these surveys and reef structures are unlikely {{to occur in the}} study area. The main large sponges found belong to the family Geodiidae. The volume of cold-water corals and large sponges in the by-catches was generally low in the regularly-used fishing grounds studied. Most of the by-catches were recorded in hauls carried out in areas outside of regular fishing grounds for the bottom trawlers. By-catches of large gorgonians were recorded in three small areas located in Divs. 3 LM (two in Div. 3 L and one in Div. 3 M), indicating that Vulnerable Marine Ecosystems (VMEs) could occur there. Pennatulaceans, solitary scleractinians, alcyonaceans and antipatharians were also observed as part of bycatch in some hauls carried out in Divs. 3 LMO, {{but it is not clear}} if these by-catches indicate presence of VMEs in the area sampled. Highest diversity of coral species was found in Div. 3 M. Large sponges occurred in deep waters, in a narrow band along Northern slope of the Grand Banks (Div. 3 N) and Southern Flemish Pass (Div. 3 L) as well as in several patches located in North-eastern and Eastern Flemish Cap. The preliminary information presented here, derived solely from bottom trawl survey by-catch records, it is not enough for identification of VMEs accurately, but it is very valuable to give a general view of where VMEs like to occur or not occur. Previous experience from other North Atlantic high-seas fishing grounds (e. g. <b>NEAFC</b> Regulatory Area) suggests that additional geohabitat mapping and information on fishery footprint will be needed for the accurate delineation of VMEs and for the subsequent adoption of suitable habitat conservation measures such as Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) to preserve cold-water corals and large sponges in NAFO Area...|$|E

Terms of Reference of the Working Group {{are given in}} Section 2. WGDEEP gives advice {{according}} to an advice schedule where, in short, half of the stocks advice is given in year y {{and the other half}} has advice in year y+ 1. The excep-tion from this schedule is stocks from Va (Iceland) that have advice annually. Availa-ble time-series for international landings and discards, fishing effort, survey indices and biological information were updated and for all stocks and are presented in Sec-tions 4 to 14 of the report. Significant discrepancies found in previous years for some fisheries between official landings data supplied to ICES and scientific estimates of landings were lesser for 2014 landings. In order to maintain the consistency of time-series (which previously used only scientific estimates), some landings have been included in the data tables as “unallocated landing” (see Section 2. 2). The assessment of ling in VA using GADGET, developed as exploratory assessment in recent years, is now benchmark as a fully analytical model. The spawning stock of ling in Va is estimated to have reached in 2013 a highest observed level in 30 years, three times above the 1982 – 2002 average. The state of other ling stocks is diverse and overall less favourable. Blue ling stocks also showed different status amongst stock units with strong varia-tions in catch, recruitment and biomass in Va, a sustained increased in biomass in relation to a decrease fishing mortality in Vb, VI and VII, and a persistent low level in other areas. The updated assessment for areas Vb, VI and VII suggested that the stock has recovered to BMSY level and the exploitation rate in 2014 was well below FMSY. There is no directed fishery for blue ling in other areas. The landings are now only bycatches. All Subareas within the assessment unit other areas show a declining trend in landings and the stock seems to be depleted in ICES Subarea II. Assessment of tusk was carried out as described in the stock annex, the main pro-gress being made is the standardization of cpue series for many of the stock units and a new estimate of FMSY for tusk in Va. Estimates of biomass for tusk in Va from the GADGET model were revised downward the main reason being a significant drop in the tuning series in 2014 (Icelandic March survey). Until 2014, ICES advised on two stock units of greater silver smelt, in Va and other areas. Following proposal form the group to split the other areas GSS into three advi-sory units; Area I and II, Vb and VIa and finally other areas, assessment were carried out and advice will be delivered for these three units. In areas I and II, data from Norwegian fisheries do not show any negative trends in recent years. Larger and older fish are caught from Norwegian surveys than from the fisheries in the same area. Acoustic biomass estimates in 2012 show some reduction compared to 2009, but marked upward trend again in 2014. Trawl cpue series show an upward trend since 2004. The advice for greater silver smelt in Vb and VIa is based on trends in cpue (kg/hour) from the Faroese summer survey on the Faroe Plateau, which show a slight decrease in the latest years. In 2014, the Faroese authorities set a law of species-specific management of greater silver smelt for Faroese waters. The TAC in 2014 was 16 000 tons and the TAC for 2015 was 14 400 tons. Six trawlers have licences to direct fishery of greater silver smelt.

In order to maintain the consistency of time-series (which previously used only scientific estimates), some landings have been included in the data tables as “unallocated landing” (see Section 2. 2). The assessment of ling in VA using GADGET, developed as exploratory assessment in recent years, is now benchmark as a fully analytical model. The spawning stock of ling in Va is estimated to have reached in 2013 a highest observed level in 30 years, three times above the 1982 – 2002 average. The state of other ling stocks is diverse and overall less favourable. Blue ling stocks also showed different status amongst stock units with strong varia-tions in catch, recruitment and biomass in Va, a sustained increased in biomass in relation to a decrease fishing mortality in Vb, VI and VII, and a persistent low level in other areas. The updated assessment for areas Vb, VI and VII suggested that the stock has recovered to BMSY level and the exploitation rate in 2014 was well below FMSY. There is no directed fishery for blue ling in other areas. The landings are now only bycatches. All Subareas within the assessment unit other areas show a declining trend in landings and the stock seems to be depleted in ICES Subarea II. Assessment of tusk was carried out as described in the stock annex, the main pro-gress being made is the standardization of cpue series for many of the stock units and a new estimate of FMSY for tusk in Va. Estimates of biomass for tusk in Va from the GADGET model were revised downward the main reason being a significant drop in the tuning series in 2014 (Icelandic March survey). Until 2014, ICES advised on two stock units of greater silver smelt, in Va and other areas. Following proposal form the group to split the other areas GSS into three advi-sory units; Area I and II, Vb and VIa and finally other areas, assessment were carried out and advice will be delivered for these three units. In areas I and II, data from Norwegian fisheries do not show any negative trends in recent years. Larger and older fish are caught from Norwegian surveys than from the fisheries in the same area. Acoustic biomass estimates in 2012 show some reduction compared to 2009, but marked upward trend again in 2014. Trawl cpue series show an upward trend since 2004. The advice for greater silver smelt in Vb and VIa is based on trends in cpue (kg/hour) from the Faroese summer survey on the Faroe Plateau, which show a slight decrease in the latest years. In 2014, the Faroese authorities set a law of species-specific management of greater silver smelt for Faroese waters. The TAC in 2014 was 16 000 tons and the TAC for 2015 was 14 400 tons. Six trawlers have licences to direct fishery of greater silver smelt. The regulation also includes limitations in e. g. bycatch,WGDEEP met at ICES Headquarters in Copenhagen, Denmark on 20 – 27 March 2015. The group was chaired by Pascal Lorance from France and Gudmundur Thordarson from Iceland. Terms of Reference of the Working Group are given in Section 2. WGDEEP gives advice according to an advice schedule where, in short, half of the stocks advice is given in year y and the other half has advice in year y+ 1. The excep-tion from this schedule is stocks from Va (Iceland) that have advice annually. Availa-ble time-series for international landings and discards, fishing effort, survey indices and biological information were updated and for all stocks and are presented in Sec-tions 4 to 14 of the report.

Six trawlers have licences to direct fishery of greater silver smelt. The regulation also includes limitations in e. g. bycatch, mesh size and fishing area. The EU introduced TAC management in 2003. For 2013 the EU TAC was set to 4316 tons in area V, VI, VII. For 2014 and 2016 the EU TAC was set to the same as in 2013 (V, VI, VII = 4316 tons). Most, if not all, of theEU TAC is caught in ICES Division VIa, therefore from the Vb–VIa stock unit. The fishery is smaller in other areas where the species is also discarded by various fisheries in quantities that could not be estimated. Little new data and no new assessment were presented for orange roughy in 2015. The species appears is very small amount in discards of some fleets in EU waters. There is a Faroese fishery on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. For this particularly long-lived species, the results Productivity Susceptibility Analysis (PSA) presented in 2013 re-main appropriate and do no need yearly updating. The status of the roundnose grenadier stocks are varied. Roundnose grenadier in Vb, VI, VII and XIIb is assessed using a Bayesian surplus production model since 2010. The fishing pressure in recent years is estimated low, the biomass is slowly rebuild-ing after two decades of overexploitation. No advice is required in 2015. Exploratory assessments were carried out using the abundance indices from the Marine Scotland Deepwater Science Survey instead of the usual French tallybook indices (which was also run for comparison between models). Estimated trends in stock biomass using the survey of the tallybook indices are consistent. However, the stock biomass in re-cent years is estimated to increase at a substantially higher rate when the model is fit to the survey index. The survey covers the main distribution range of thee stock and the main fishing grounds. It is therefore most likely to provide a realistic index of the stock abundance. It may further be conservative as it does not cover the fully area of distribution part of which has not been fished in recent years. WGDEEP proposed the stock for benchmarking in 2017, in order to review the use of biomass indices and investigate alternative to the current assessment model. The fishery for roundnose grenadier in Division IIIa has been stopped since 2006 and landings are now insignificant. The bycatch from other fisheries is also low. The only information to assess this stock is now a Norwegian survey index from the same area. This index has shown a declining trend since 2006 and is now at the lowest level rec-orded during the time-series from 1984. The state of roundnose grenadier stocks on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge is unclear owing to limited data. This stock was intensively exploited in the 1970 s and 1980 s, the fishery declined in the 1990 s and was insignifi-cant in the 2000 s and resumed in 2011. In other areas, roundnose grenadier is only a bycatch and catch are insignificant. An assessment and advice was requested for the roughhead grenadier (Macrourus berglax) in the Northeast Atlantic owing to landings reported in previous years. Data were compiled and a catch based advice was prepared. This species is caught and subject to TAC management in the NAFO area. In the ICES area, it occurs at a much lower level, it is however known to occur at east Greenland (Division XIVb, Iceland (Va), Faroe Islands (Vb), Northern North Sea (IVa), Norwegian and Barents Sea (I and II). The landings level reported in some previous years were not plausible as high densities are not known to occur in reported catch areas. An advice reflecting possi-ble level of sustainable catch was prepared. Similarly, an assessment and advice was requested for the roundsnout grenadier (Trachyrincus scabrus) in the Northeast Atlantic (see chapter 15). This species is con-sidered to have none or only minor commercial interest. The request for an advice came from landings reported in previous years. These landings were considered to be either minor bycatch or species misreporting. The advice is that the possible small landings of the species are counted against existing roundnose and roughhead gren-adiers TACs. The assessment of black scabbardfish was benchmarked at WKDEEP 2014. This spe-cies was formerly assessed in three units in the ICES area. Although no final conclu-sion is reached all available evidence suggest that a single stock does a large clockwise migrations in the Northeast Atlantic and further south in the CECAF areas where spawning occurs. Whether fish in Azorean waters and on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (ICES Subareas X and XII) belongs to the same widely distributed stock is un-certain and the picture in Subarea X is further blurred by the mixing with the closely related intermediate scabbardfish (Aphanopus intermedius). Greater forkbeard is caught mostly as a bycatch. Adults are a landed bycatch in slope fisheries for hake, monkfish, megrims and deep-water species and juveniles are a discarded bycatch in numerous fisheries. The assessment is based upon indices from four surveys. The increasing trend in abundance and biomass in recent years seems to be reverting. Time-series of survey indices display pluri-annual fluctuations, prob-ably related to recruitment variability. Alfonsinos are a mixture of two species (Beryx splendens and Beryx decadactylus. These species are oceanic demersal species occurring at the top of seamounts and along slopes, where they form local aggregations. They are widespread in the Northeast Atlantic from Iceland to the Azores and along the continental slope, in particular to the west of Iberia and Bay of Biscay. The stock structure is uncertain and data very limited. Although a longline survey is carried out in the Azores, where most of the catch occur, the reliably of survey indices is uncertain for these species owing to their large and patchy spatial distributions. As a consequence, the perception of the status of these stocks relies primarily on catch trends. Three stocks of blackspot sea bream are assessed by WGDEEP. In ICES Subarea IX Target fishery only take places in the Strait of Gibraltar, while the species is taken as a bycatch of artisanal fleets which uses mainly longlines. In 2014, landings and lpue from the Spanish “voracera” target fishery seemed increasing and the mean length in the catchwas slightly larger. However, the VMS-based lpue developed in recent years could not be updated and the assessment this stock is undermined by the lack of data from the Mediterranean and CECAF area as the same stockstraddles over ICES, CE-CAF and GFCM areas, where management regimes are different. Although no advice is given in 2015 for blackspot sea bream stocks, the WGDEEP report reminds that a recovery plan involving all parties is necessary for this stock. The stock of the same species in the Azores (ICES Subarea X) also showed signs of overexploitation. Ex-ploratory analyses of the natural and fishing mortalities were conducted using catch curves in order to investigate optimal exploitation reference points (yield-per-recruit analysis). Results show that modelling the fraction of population that change sex is a key issue to better estimating the trajectory of the spawning biomass. Data collection on sex ratio, maturity and sex change has been updated and analysed. Traditional models should be extended to incorporate the sex change issue. The third blackspot sea bream stock in ICES Subareas VI, VII and VIII remains at a low level, since it col-lapsed in the 1980 s. In response to a request from the <b>NEAFC,</b> the working group update descriptions of deep-water fisheries in the <b>NEAFC</b> and ICES areas by compiling data on catch/landings, fishing effort and known spawning areas and areas of local deple-tionat the finest spatial resolution possible by ICES subarea and division (Chapter 15) ...|$|E
