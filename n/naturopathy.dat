25|$|The Swiss Federal Constitution {{defines the}} Swiss Confederation and the Cantons of Switzerland {{within the scope}} of their powers to oversee {{complementary}} medicine. In particular, the Federal authorities must set up diplomas for the practice of non-scientific medicine. The first of such diplomas has been validated in April 2015 for the practice of <b>naturopathy.</b> There is a long tradition for <b>naturopathy</b> and traditional medicine in Switzerland. The Cantons of Switzerland make their own public health regulations. Although the law in certain cantons is typically monopolistic, the authorities are relatively tolerant with regard to alternative practitioners.|$|E

25|$|Naturopaths {{represent}} {{a diverse group}} of practitioners. In general, they can be categorized into three groups: 1) those with a government issued license; 2) those who practice outside of an official status ("traditional naturopaths"); 3) those who are primarily another kind of health professional who also practices <b>naturopathy.</b>|$|E
25|$|Several {{surveys have}} shown that some {{practitioners}} of homeopathy, particularly homeopaths without any medical training, advise patients against vaccination. For example, a survey of registered homeopaths in Austria found that only 28% considered immunization an important preventive measure, and 83% of homeopaths surveyed in Sydney, Australia, did not recommend vaccination. Many practitioners of <b>naturopathy</b> also oppose vaccination.|$|E
25|$|Hydrotherapy, {{formerly}} called hydropathy {{and also}} called water cure, {{is a part}} of medicine and alternative medicine, in particular of <b>naturopathy,</b> occupational therapy and physiotherapy, that involves the use of water for pain relief and treatment. The term encompasses a broad range of approaches and therapeutic methods that take advantage of the physical properties of water, such as temperature and pressure, for therapeutic purposes, to stimulate blood circulation and treat the symptoms of certain diseases.|$|E
25|$|The Indian {{government}} recognizes homeopathy {{as one of}} {{its national}} systems of medicine; it has established AYUSH or the Department of Ayurveda, Yoga and <b>Naturopathy,</b> Unani, Siddha and Homoeopathy under the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare. The south Indian state of Kerala also has a cabinet-level AYUSH department. The Central Council of Homoeopathy was established in 1973 to monitor higher education in homeopathy, and National Institute of Homoeopathy in 1975. A minimum of a recognized diploma in homeopathy and registration on a state register or the Central Register of Homoeopathy is required to practise homeopathy in India.|$|E
25|$|In 1977, a {{committee}} reviewed all colleges of <b>naturopathy</b> in Australia and found that, although the syllabuses of many colleges were reasonable in their coverage of basic biomedical sciences on paper, the actual instruction bore little {{relationship to the}} documented course. In no case was any practical work of consequence available. The lectures which were attended by the committee varied from the dictation of textbook material to a slow, but reasonably methodical, exposition of the terminology of medical sciences, {{at a level of}} dictionary definitions, without the benefit of depth or the understanding of mechanisms or the broader significance of the concepts. The committee did not see any significant teaching of the various therapeutic approaches favoured by naturopaths. People reported to be particularly interested in homoeopathy, Bach's floral remedies or mineral salts were interviewed, but no systematic courses in the choice and use of these therapies were seen in the various colleges. The committee were left with the impression that the choice of therapeutic regime was based on the general whim of the naturopath and, since the suggested applications in the various textbooks and dispensations overlapped to an enormous extent, no specific indications were or could be taught.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Naturopathy</b> {{practitioners}} {{voice their}} opposition to vaccination. The reasons for this opposition are based, in part, on the early views which shaped the foundation of this profession. [...] A <b>naturopathy</b> textbook, co-authored by Joseph Pizzorno, recalls anti-vaccine beliefs associated with the founding of <b>naturopathy</b> in the United States: [...] "a return to nature in regulating the diet, breathing, exercising, bathing and the employment of various forces" [...] {{in lieu of the}} smallpox vaccine.|$|E
2500|$|After {{a period}} of rapid growth, <b>naturopathy</b> went into decline for several decades after the 1930s. In 1910, the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching {{published}} the Flexner Report, which criticized many aspects of medical education, especially quality and lack of scientific rigour. The advent of penicillin and other [...] "miracle drugs" [...] and the consequent popularity of modern medicine also contributed to naturopathy's decline. In the 1940s and 1950s, a broadening in scope of practice laws led many chiropractic schools to drop their ND degrees, though many chiropractors continued to practice <b>naturopathy.</b> From 1940 to 1963, the American Medical Association campaigned against heterodox medical systems. By 1958, practice of <b>naturopathy</b> was licensed in only five states. In 1968 the United States Department of Health, Education, and Welfare issued a report on <b>naturopathy</b> concluding that <b>naturopathy</b> was not grounded in medical science and that naturopathic education was inadequate to prepare graduates to make appropriate diagnosis and provide treatment; the report recommends against expanding Medicare coverage to include naturopathic treatments. In 1977 an Australian committee of inquiry reached similar conclusions; it did not recommend licensure for naturopaths.|$|E

2500|$|From 1901, Lust {{founded the}} American School of <b>Naturopathy</b> in New York. In 1902, the {{original}} North American Kneipp Societies were discontinued and renamed [...] "Naturopathic Societies". In September 1919, the Naturopathic Society of America was dissolved and Benedict Lust founded the American Naturopathic Association to supplant it. Naturopaths became licensed under naturopathic or drugless practitioner laws in 25 {{states in the}} first three decades of the twentieth century. <b>Naturopathy</b> was adopted by many chiropractors, and several schools offered both Doctor of <b>Naturopathy</b> (ND) and Doctor of Chiropractic (DC) degrees. Estimates of the number of naturopathic schools active in the United States during this period vary from about one to two dozen.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Naturopathy</b> lacks an {{adequate}} scientific basis, {{and it is}} rejected by the medical community. Some methods rely on immaterial [...] "vital energy fields", the existence of {{which has not been}} proven, and there is concern that <b>naturopathy</b> as a field tends towards isolation from general scientific discourse. <b>Naturopathy</b> is criticized for its reliance on and its association with unproven, disproven, and other controversial alternative medical treatments, and for its vitalistic underpinnings. Natural substances known as nutraceuticals show little promise in treating diseases, especially cancer, as laboratory experiments have shown limited therapeutic effect on biochemical pathways, while clinical trials demonstrate poor bioavailability. According to the American Cancer Society, [...] "scientific evidence does not support claims that naturopathic medicine can cure cancer or any other disease.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Naturopathy</b> or naturopathic {{medicine}} {{is a form}} of alternative medicine that employs an array of pseudoscientific practices branded as [...] "natural", [...] "non-invasive", and as promoting [...] "self-healing". The ideology and methods of <b>naturopathy</b> are based on vitalism and folk medicine, rather than evidence-based medicine. Naturopathic practitioners generally recommend against modern medical practices, including but not limited to medical testing, drugs, vaccinations, and surgery. Instead, naturopathic study and practice rely on unscientific notions, often leading naturopathic doctors to diagnoses and treatments that have no factual merit.|$|E
2500|$|Appeals to holism {{as opposed}} to reductionism: proponents of pseudoscientific claims, {{especially}} in organic medicine, alternative medicine, <b>naturopathy</b> and mental health, often resort to the [...] "mantra of holism" [...] to dismiss negative findings.|$|E
2500|$|Instead of [...] "hard sciences", where {{competence}} {{is easier to}} verify, the subjects offered by a diploma mill are often esoteric and may {{be based on a}} pseudoscience like astrology or <b>naturopathy.</b> Such subjects are only vaguely defined, making external verification of educational standards difficult.|$|E
2500|$|The term <b>naturopathy</b> {{was coined}} in 1895 by John Scheel, and {{purchased}} by Benedict Lust, whom naturopaths {{consider to be}} the [...] "Father of U.S. Naturopathy". Lust had been schooled in hydrotherapy and other natural health practices in Germany by Father Sebastian Kneipp; Kneipp sent Lust to the United States to spread his drugless methods. Lust defined <b>naturopathy</b> as a broad discipline rather than a particular method, and included such techniques as hydrotherapy, herbal medicine, and homeopathy, as well as eliminating overeating, tea, coffee, and alcohol. He described the body in spiritual and vitalistic terms with [...] "absolute reliance upon the cosmic forces of man's nature". According to the Merriam-Webster Dictionary, the first known use of [...] "naturopathy" [...] in print is from 1901.|$|E

2500|$|Beginning in the 1970s, {{there was}} a revival of {{interest}} in the United States and Canada, in conjunction with the [...] "holistic health" [...] movement. As of 2009, fifteen U.S. states, Puerto Rico, the US Virgin Islands and the District of Columbia licensed naturopathic doctors, and the State of Washington requires insurance companies to offer reimbursement for services provided by naturopathic physicians. On the other hand, some states such as South Carolina and Tennessee prohibit the practice of <b>naturopathy.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In general, {{evidence}} about associations between <b>naturopathy</b> and pediatric vaccination is sparse, but [...] "published reports suggest {{that only a}} minority of naturopathic physicians actively support full vaccination". In Washington state from 2000 to 2003, children were significantly less likely to receive immunizations if they had seen a naturopath. A survey of naturopathic students published in 2004 found that students at the Canadian College of Naturopathic Medicine became less likely to recommend vaccinations to their patients and became more distrustful of public health and conventional medicine as they advanced in the program.|$|E
2500|$|Certain naturopathic {{treatments}} {{offered by}} naturopaths, such as homeopathy, rolfing, and iridology, are widely considered pseudoscience or quackery. Stephen Barrett of QuackWatch and the National Council Against Health Fraud {{has stated that}} <b>naturopathy</b> is [...] "simplistic and that its practices are riddled with quackery". [...] "Non-scientific health care practitioners, including naturopaths, use unscientific methods and deception on a public who, lacking in-depth health care knowledge, must rely upon the assurance of providers. Quackery not only harms people, it undermines the ability to conduct scientific research and should be opposed by scientists", says William T. Jarvis.|$|E
2500|$|The term [...] "naturopathy" [...] {{was created}} from [...] "natura" [...] (Latin root for birth) and [...] "pathos" [...] (the Greek root for suffering) to suggest [...] "natural healing". Naturopaths claim the ancient Greek [...] "Father of Medicine", Hippocrates, {{as the first}} {{advocate}} of naturopathic medicine, before the term existed. <b>Naturopathy</b> {{has its roots in}} the 19th-century Natural Cure movement of Europe. In Scotland, Thomas Allinson started advocating his [...] "Hygienic Medicine" [...] in the 1880s, promoting a natural diet and exercise with avoidance of tobacco and overwork.|$|E
