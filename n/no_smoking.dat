Kashyap's followup, <b>No</b> <b>Smoking</b> (2007) met with negative reviews and performed poorly at the box-office.

25|$|After the {{box office}} {{disaster}} of Kashyap's <b>No</b> <b>Smoking,</b> it was rumoured that United Television (UTV) had {{backed out of the}} director's next project, Dev.D, starring Abhay Deol.

When Dev.D hit initial snags and was stalled, it was rumoured that UTV had backed out. At that time, the director denied these rumours. He explained the delay by saying that he was still looking out for his Chandramukhi and had locked in Abhay and newcomer Mahi Gill.
