5|$|Coke iron was {{initially}} only used for foundry work, making pots and other cast iron goods. Foundry work {{was a minor}} branch of the industry, but Darby's son built a <b>new</b> <b>furnace</b> at nearby Horsehay, and began to supply the owners of finery forges with coke pig iron {{for the production of}} bar iron. Coke pig iron was by this time cheaper to produce than charcoal pig iron. The use of a coal-derived fuel in the iron industry was a key factor in the British Industrial Revolution. Darby's original blast furnace has been archaeologically excavated and can be seen in situ at Coalbrookdale, part of the Ironbridge Gorge Museums. Cast iron from the furnace was used to make girders for the world's first iron bridge in 1779. The Iron Bridge crosses the River Severn at Coalbrookdale and remains in use for pedestrians.|$|E
25|$|A U.S. {{shipbuilding}} boom {{beginning in}} 1880 encouraged many American shipyards {{to upgrade their}} facilities, and John Roach & Sons was no exception. In 1880, Roach expanded the facilities of the Chester Rolling Mill by adding a new blast furnace. The <b>new</b> <b>furnace</b> eventually allowed the production of 300 tons of steel weekly, {{in addition to the}} 700 tons of pig iron and 300 tons of iron plate the mill was already producing. Roach also added machinery to the mill for the rolling of steel plates.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{shutdown}} of Bellefonte Furnace, President Frazer {{had been trying}} to reach a rate agreement with John Reilly of the furnace company. They came to terms in July 1892, and Reilly began making arrangements to restart ore mining and put the furnace back in blast. It resumed ironmaking in March 1893, and the Bellefonte Central acquired additional ore cars to serve the traffic. At the end of April, Tom Shoemaker resigned as superintendent to tend to his expanding duties supervising Bellefonte Furnace and ore mining at Graysdale. He was replaced by Francis H. Thomas, a long-time Reading employee. Unfortunately, the <b>new</b> <b>furnace</b> traffic would prove ephemeral. The Panic of 1893 forced Bellefonte Furnace to shut down again in July, after only four months of operation. While the railroad was still shipping ore to the McCoy and Linn Iron Works, Shoemaker could find few other customers for Graysdale ore and its importance to the railroad again declined.|$|E

25|$|Surrey's cloth {{industry}} {{declined in}} the 16th century and collapsed in the 17th, harmed by falling standards and competition from more effective producers {{in other parts of}} England. The introduction of <b>new</b> <b>furnace</b> technology in the early 17th century led to an expansion of the iron industry in the Weald, whose rich deposits had been exploited since prehistoric times, but this hastened the extinction of the business as the mines were worked out. However, this period also saw the emergence of important new industries, centred on the valley of the Tillingbourne, south-east of Guildford, which often adapted watermills originally built for the now moribund cloth industry. The production of brass goods and wire in this area was relatively short-lived, but the manufacture of paper and gunpowder proved more enduring. For a time in the mid-17th century the Surrey mills were the main producers of gunpowder in England. A glass industry also developed in the 16th century on the south-western borders of Surrey. The Wey Navigation, opened in 1653, was one of England's first canal systems.|$|E
500|$|The company {{reached its}} peak {{production}} in 1890, smelting [...] of iron. However, half the company's resources were dedicated to making charcoal from wood. The availability of cheaper imported coke-fired iron, the overall reduction in demand for iron as railroad expansion slowed, and the economic effects of the Panic of 1893, all combined to hasten the final closure of the furnace in 1894. The company continued to operate a pipe foundry {{on the site of}} the <b>new</b> <b>furnace</b> until 1928.|$|E

60|$|For {{the first}} few days {{politicians}} were much adrift. They had moments of compunction. Whether friends or foes of the Irish, they were perplexed by the curious double aspect of the measure. Mr. Parnell himself began to feel misgivings, as he came to realise the magnitude of the inquiry, its vast expense, its interminable length, its unfathomable uncertainties. On the day appointed for the second reading of the bill appointing the commission (July 23), some other subject kept the business back until seven o’clock. Towards six, Mr. Parnell who was to open the debate on his own side, came to an English friend, to ask whether there would be time for him to go away for an hour; he wished to examine some <b>new</b> <b>furnace</b> for assaying purposes, the existence of gold in Wicklow being one of his fixed ideas. So steady was the composure of this extraordinary man. The English friend grimly remarked to him that it would perhaps be rather safer not to lose sight of the furnace in which at any moment his own assaying might begin. His speech on this critical occasion was not one of his best. Indifference to his audience often made him meagre, though he was scarcely ever other than clear, and in this debate there was only one effective point which it was necessary for him to press. The real issue was whether the reference to the judges should be limited or unlimited; should be a fishing inquiry at large into the history of an agrarian agitation ten years old, or an examination into definite and specified charges against named members of parliament. The minister, in moving the second reading, no longer left it to the Irish members to accept or reject; it now rested, he said, with the House to decide. It became evident that the acuter members of the majority, fully awakened to the opportunities for destroying the Irishmen which an unlimited inquisition might furnish, had made up their minds that no limit should be set to the scope of the inquisition. Boldly they tramped through a thick jungle of fallacy and inconsistency. They had never ceased to insist, and they insisted now, that Mr. Parnell ought to have gone into a court of law. Yet they fought as hard as they could against every proposal for making the procedure of the commission like the procedure of a law court. In a court {{there would have been a}} specific indictment. Here a specific indictment was what they most positively refused, and for it they substituted a roving inquiry, which is exactly what a court never undertakes. They first argued that nothing but a commission was available to test the charges against members of parliament. Then, when they had bethought themselves of further objects, they argued round that it was unheard of and inconceivable to institute a royal commission for members of parliament alone.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the early}} 1950s the company {{expanded}} {{two of its}} blast furnaces to 25 ft diameter (named [...] "Queen Mary", No.9; and [...] "Queen Bess"), and in 1951 took the decision to start the construction of two further <b>new</b> <b>furnaces</b> to a similar diameter. The <b>new</b> <b>furnaces</b> together with addition sinter plant were constructed on former ironstone quarry land. The new 27 and 28.5 ft furnaces were official opened in mid 1954, and older plant abandoned, with total capacity increased from 900,000 to 1,250,000 tons pa. The blast furnaces were named [...] "Queen Anne" [...] (No.3, 27 ft) and [...] "Queen Victoria" [...] (No.4, 28.5 ft). In addition to the new plant new sinter equipment was constructed, allowing the works to operate on near 100% sinter use in the blast furnaces - part of the rational for the sinter investment was {{the deterioration of the}} quality of the locally mined ore, resulting in increasing quantities of fines in the ore. The expansion led to the closure of the iron works at Frodingham and the North Lincs works; the last blast furnace in operation at Frodingham, No.1, was shut down in May 1954.|$|R
