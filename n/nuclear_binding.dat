5|$|Uranium-235 was {{the first}} isotope that {{was found to be}} fissile. Other {{naturally}} occurring isotopes are fissionable, but not fissile. On bombardment with slow neutrons, its uranium-235 isotope will most of the time divide into two smaller nuclei, releasing <b>nuclear</b> <b>binding</b> energy and more neutrons. If too many of these neutrons are absorbed by other uranium-235 nuclei, a nuclear chain reaction occurs that results in a burst of heat or (in special circumstances) an explosion. In a nuclear reactor, such a chain reaction is slowed and controlled by a neutron poison, absorbing some of the free neutrons. Such neutron absorbent materials are often part of reactor control rods (see nuclear reactor physics for a description of this process of reactor control).|$|E
5|$|After hydrogen, helium is {{the second}} lightest and second most {{abundant}} element in the observable universe, being present at about 24% of the total elemental mass, {{which is more than}} 12 times the mass of all the heavier elements combined. Its abundance is similar to this figure in the Sun and in Jupiter. This is due to the very high <b>nuclear</b> <b>binding</b> energy (per nucleon) of helium-4 with respect to the next three elements after helium. This helium-4 binding energy also accounts for why it is a product of both nuclear fusion and radioactive decay. Most helium in the universe is helium-4, the vast majority of which was formed during the Big Bang. Large amounts of new helium are being created by nuclear fusion of hydrogen in stars.|$|E

40|$|The murine {{adenosine}} deaminase gene has a structurally archetypal TATAA-box-deficient G+C-rich promoter. The three Sp 1 binding {{sites of the}} promoter are neither necessary nor sufficient for promoter function. Minimal basal promoter activity resides within a 48 -bp element downstream of the Sp 1 binding sites. This element shows an imperfect dyad symmetry around the promoter's major transcriptional initiation site and contains at least two <b>nuclear</b> protein <b>binding</b> sites. The distinctive sequence characteristics and <b>nuclear</b> protein <b>binding</b> locations of this element led us to propose a model for how such promoters may function...|$|R

5|$|Naturally {{occurring}} lithium {{is composed}} of two stable isotopes, 6Li and 7Li, the latter being the more abundant (92.5% natural abundance). Both natural isotopes have anomalously low <b>nuclear</b> <b>binding</b> energy per nucleon (compared to the neighboring elements on the periodic table, helium and beryllium); lithium is the only low numbered element that can produce net energy through nuclear fission. The two lithium nuclei have lower binding energies per nucleon than any other stable nuclides other than deuterium and helium-3. As a result of this, though very light in atomic weight, lithium is less common in the Solar System than 25 of the first 32 chemical elements. Seven radioisotopes have been characterized, the most stable being 8Li with a half-life of 838 ms and 9Li with a half-life of 178ms. All of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half-lives that are shorter than 8.6ms. The shortest-lived isotope of lithium is 4Li, which decays through proton emission and has a half-life of 7.6 × 10−23 s.|$|E
5|$|The {{nucleus of}} the helium-4 atom is {{identical}} with an alpha particle. High-energy electron-scattering experiments show its charge to decrease exponentially from a maximum at a central point, exactly as does the charge density of helium's own electron cloud. This symmetry reflects similar underlying physics: the pair of neutrons and the pair of protons in helium's nucleus obey the same quantum mechanical rules as do helium's pair of electrons (although the nuclear particles are subject to a different <b>nuclear</b> <b>binding</b> potential), so that all these fermions fully occupy 1s orbitals in pairs, none of them possessing orbital angular momentum, and each cancelling the other's intrinsic spin. Adding another {{of any of these}} particles would require angular momentum and would release substantially less energy (in fact, no nucleus with five nucleons is stable). This arrangement is thus energetically extremely stable for all these particles, and this stability accounts for many crucial facts regarding helium in nature.|$|E
25|$|Weizsäcker's special {{interests}} {{as a young}} researcher were the nuclear processes in stars and the binding energy of atomic nuclei. Together with Hans Bethe he found a mechanism or pathway for the cyclic process of fusion in stars (Bethe–Weizsäcker process, published 1937-1939). This discovery {{should not be confused}} with his later development of the Bethe–Weizsäcker formula, or Semi-Empirical Mass Formula (SEMF), which was a theoretical formula relating the curve of <b>nuclear</b> <b>binding</b> energy, nuclear masses, and certain other nuclear properties.|$|E

40|$|In {{this study}} we analyse {{the effects of the}} anti-tumor {{compound}} distamycin on the <b>binding</b> of <b>nuclear</b> factor(s) to a synthetic oligonucleotide (GTATA/IFN-gamma) mimicking a putative regulatory region of the human HLA-DR alpha gene. This region contains the sequence (GTATA), that is required for <b>nuclear</b> protein <b>binding</b> and is likely to interact with distamycin. The present results, by showing that distamycin inhibits the interaction between nuclear factors and the GTATA/IFN-gamma oligonucleotide, suggest that distamycin might alter the binding of transacting factors to cis-elements containing AT/TA sequences.

40|$|Progressive {{immunodeficiency}} in HIV {{infection is}} paralleled by {{a decrease in}} IL- 12 production, a cytokine crucial for cellular immune function. Here we examine the molecular mechanisms by which HIV infection suppresses IL- 12 p 40 expression. HIV infection of THP- 1 myeloid cells resulted in decreased LPS-induced <b>nuclear</b> factor <b>binding</b> to the NF-κB, AP- 1, and Sp 1 sites of the IL- 12 p 40 promoter. By site-directed mutagenesis we determined {{that each of these}} sites was necessary for transcriptional activation of the IL- 12 p 40 promoter. Binding of NF-κB p 50, c-Rel, p 65, Sp 1, Sp 3, c-Fos, and c-Jun proteins to their cognate <b>nuclear</b> factor <b>binding</b> sites was somewhat impaired by HV infection, although a role for other as yet unidentified factors cannot be dismissed. The cellular levels of these transcription factors were unaffected by HIV infection, {{with the exception of a}} decrease in expression of NF-κB p 65, consistent with the observed decrease in its binding to the IL- 12 p 40 promoter following HIV infection. Analysis of regulation of upstream LPS-induced MAP kinases demonstrated impaired phosphorylation of JNK and p 38 MAPK, and suppressed phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα following HIV infection. These results suggest that alterations in <b>nuclear</b> factor <b>binding</b> to numerous sites in the IL- 12 p 40 promoter, together may contribute to the suppression in IL- 12 p 40 transcription previously reported. These effects on <b>nuclear</b> factor <b>binding</b> may be a direct effect of HIV infection on the IL- 12 p 40 promoter, or may occur indirectly as a consequence of altered MAP kinase activation...|$|R
25|$|Building {{from work}} by J. J. Thomson on the {{deflection}} of positively charged atoms by electric and magnetic fields, Francis Aston {{built the first}} mass spectrograph at the Cavendish Laboratory in 1919. His aim {{was to try to}} separate the two isotopes of neon, which he was able to easily do. Aston discovered that the masses of all the particles are whole numbers, called the whole number rule, that is, the masses of all the isotopes are whole number multiples of the mass of the hydrogen atom. Aston arbitrarily computed his masses relative to oxygen-16, which he took to have a mass of exactly 16. (Today the atomic mass unit (amu) is relative to carbon-12.) Ironically, the one exception to this rule was hydrogen itself, which had a mass value 1.008. The excess mass was small, but well outside experimental uncertainty. Aston and others quickly realized that the discrepancy was on account of the binding energy of atoms, that is, the mass of a number of hydrogen atoms bound into a single atom must be less than the sum of the masses of the separate hydrogen atoms. Additional work determined the nuclide binding energies. Aston's work on isotopes garnered him the 1922 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the discovery of isotopes in a large number of non-radioactive elements, and for his enunciation of the whole-number rule. Noting Aston's recent discovery of <b>nuclear</b> <b>binding</b> energy, in 1920 Arthur Eddington suggested that stars may obtain their energy by fusing hydrogen (protons) into helium and that the heavier elements may form in stars.|$|E

40|$|In {{this study}} we {{investigated}} the activation of nuclear factor-kappaB in the carrageenin-induced rat pleurisy. We found that <b>nuclear</b> factor-kappaB DNA <b>binding</b> activity, measured in inflammatory cells which migrated into the pleural cavity, was detectable at 3 and 6 h, markedly increased at 24 h and decreased at 48 h after induction of the inflammation. The increase in <b>nuclear</b> factor-kappaB DNA <b>binding</b> activity paralleled both exudate formation and leukocyte infiltration. Treatment of animals with pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate, an inhibitor of nuclear factor-kappaB activation, inhibited the <b>nuclear</b> factor-kappaB DNA <b>binding</b> activity as well as exudate formation and leukocyte infiltration. These results indicate that nuclear factor-kappaB is activated in the carrageenin-induced pleurisy and suggest that its inhibition may represent a novel strategy for the modulation of inflammatory response...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{studies in}} our {{laboratory}} identified a negative regulatory domain in the 5 '-flanking {{region of the}} human CYP 1 A 1 gene containing two negative regulatory elements (NRE). Characterization {{of one of these}} elements revealed three <b>nuclear</b> protein <b>binding</b> regions: a 21 -bp palindrome with a point of symmetry at - 784 and two guanine- and cytosine-rich elements that flank the palindrome. Functional studies suggested the palindrome is critical for transcriptional repression, whereas the guanine- and cytosine-rich sequences play a secondary role. In this study, the interaction between nuclear proteins and the CYP 1 A 1 NRE was further defined. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) indicated that the NRE - 784 palindrome alone, but not the guanine- and cytosine-rich sequences minus the palindrome, was capable of specific <b>nuclear</b> protein <b>binding.</b> Competitive cotransfection experiments confirmed this observation in intact cells. Specific residues important for DNA-protein interactions were identified by site-directed mutagenesis and competitive EMSA. The loss of specific protein binding was also correlated with the loss of negative regulatory activity in a transient-expression assay. Finally, competitive EMSA was performed with consensus oligonucleotides for known transcription factors. An NF-Y consensus sequence efficiently competed with the NRE probe for specific <b>nuclear</b> protein <b>binding.</b> EMSA supershift analyses indicate that a protein immunologically related to NF-YB is part of the specific <b>nuclear</b> protein complex <b>binding</b> the human CYP 1 A 1 NRE. These studies have refined our understanding of the sequences critical for the transcriptional repression of human CYP 1 A 1. To our knowledge, this is also the first report implicating a member of the NF-Y transcription factor family in negative gene regulation...|$|R
40|$|A double {{mutation}} which converts nucleotide 1765 from A to T and nucleotide 1767 from G to A {{is frequently}} {{found in the}} hepatitis B virus (HBV) genome isolated from HBV patients with chronic hepatitis symptoms. This double mutation {{is located in the}} core promoter that controls the transcription of the precore RNA and the core RNA. In addition, this double mutation also resides in the X protein coding sequence, converting codon 130 from Lys to Met and codon 131 from Val to Ile. Previous studies indicate that this double mutation removes a <b>nuclear</b> receptor <b>binding</b> site in the core promoter, suppresses specifically precore RNA transcription, and enhances viral replication. In this study, we further investigated how this double mutation suppresses precore RNA transcription. We found that this double mutation not only removed the <b>nuclear</b> receptor <b>binding</b> site but also created an HNF 1 transcription factor binding site. Further transfection studies using Huh 7 hepatoma cells indicate that the removal of the <b>nuclear</b> receptor <b>binding</b> site has no effect on the transcription of HBV RNAs, the two-codon change in the X protein sequence suppresses the transcription of both precore and core RNAs, and the creation of the HNF 1 binding site restores the core RNA level. Hence, the specific suppression of precore RNA transcription by this frequent double-nucleotide mutation is the combined result of multiple factors...|$|R
500|$|The unusual {{stability}} of the helium-4 nucleus is also important cosmologically: it explains {{the fact that in}} the first few minutes after the Big Bang, as the [...] "soup" [...] of free protons and neutrons which had initially been created in about 6:1 ratio cooled to the point that <b>nuclear</b> <b>binding</b> was possible, almost all first compound atomic nuclei to form were helium-4 nuclei. So tight was helium-4 binding that helium-4 production consumed nearly all of the free neutrons in a few minutes, before they could beta-decay, and also leaving few to form heavier atoms such as lithium, beryllium, or boron. Helium-4 <b>nuclear</b> <b>binding</b> per nucleon is stronger than in any of these elements (see nucleogenesis and binding energy) and thus, once helium had been formed, no energetic drive was available to make elements 3, 4 and 5. It was barely energetically favorable for helium to fuse into the next element with a lower energy per nucleon, carbon. However, due to lack of intermediate elements, this process requires three helium nuclei striking each other nearly simultaneously (see triple alpha process). There was thus no time for significant carbon to be formed in the few minutes after the Big Bang, before the early expanding universe cooled to the temperature and pressure point where helium fusion to carbon was no longer possible. This left the early universe with a very similar ratio of hydrogen/helium as is observed today (3 parts hydrogen to 1 part helium-4 by mass), with nearly all the neutrons in the universe trapped in helium-4.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Timothy E. Breen Ph. D. A DATABASE FOR <b>NUCLEAR</b> RECEPTOR DNA <b>BINDING</b> SITES A {{database}} {{has been}} developed for <b>nuclear</b> receptor DNA <b>binding</b> sites and the corresponding <b>nuclear</b> receptor DNA <b>binding</b> domain (DBD) amino acid sequences. This database contains three main tables nuclear receptor DNA footprints, <b>nuclear</b> receptor DNA <b>binding</b> sites and the corresponding nuclear receptor DBD. The ultimate goal of this database {{is to provide a}} repository for all experimentally derived <b>nuclear</b> receptor DNA <b>binding</b> sites. Finite DNA binding sites and footprints are obtained from original peer reviewed research that used selected experimental methods to identify <b>nuclear</b> receptor DNA <b>binding</b> sites. Acceptable methods for the identification of DNA binding sites and/or footprints include reporter genes and DNA deletion analysis, DNAase I footprinting, exonuclease III footprinting, methylation protection, methylation interference, nuclear receptor protein mutagenesis and the electrophoretic mobility shift assay. With respect to this database, a nuclear receptor footprint is a DNA sequence less than 50 nucleotides in length identified by one of the methods listed above. A binding site is a DNA sequence identified within one of the footprints that is less than 15 nucleotides in length and corresponds to a previously identified half site, response element or consensus sequence. The five prime and three prime location of each footprint with respect to the transcription initiation site is noted in the database. The corresponding nuclear receptor DBD amino acid sequence is obtained from the Swiss-Prot database. The nuclear receptor data is annotated with the literature reference, DNA source, DNA binding site identification method, the nuclear receptor Swiss-Prot primary accession number, and inter halfsite spacing if specified. The tables are related by the literature reference, DNA source, experimental method and nuclear receptor ID. Sixty one publications have been identified from 1983 through 1994 that contain <b>nuclear</b> receptor <b>binding</b> sequences identified with one of the methods listed above. These publications were identified by selected review articles, cited references, citation index and PubMed searches. Currently, the database contains 21 DNA binding sites and 30 DNA footprints from 14 publications between 1983 and 1987. As the database expands, the literature citations will be used to design new search strategies for the nuclear receptor literature. After the current literature has been surveyed and the database is up to date, submissions will be accepted from past and future research. This database will eventually become publicly accessible. In order to interpret the experimentally derived DNA footprints, the specific DNA base - NR protein interactions are summarized from six X ray crystallographic studies...|$|R
