40|$|The {{predominant}} type {{of firms}} {{in developing countries}} is small family firms and the self-employed in the informal sector. Very few family firms {{make the transition to}} larger firms employing <b>non-family</b> <b>labour.</b> In this paper, we examine the reasons for the low presence of firms employing <b>non-family</b> <b>labour</b> in the informal sector, using a firm-level data set drawn from nationally representative repeated cross-sectional surveys of the Indian informal manufacturing sector. We find that the key constraint to firm transition is firm capabilities, followed by the level of urbanisation, access to electricity and roads, and human capital, with financial constraints playing a lesser role...|$|E
40|$|Smallholder soybean {{production}} is investigated using an econometric analysis {{otherwise known as}} stochastic frontier analysis through transcendental logarithmic (translog) production function, which incorporates an inefficiency effects model. Ninety-six farmers were randomly selected through multistage techniques in Benue State, Nigeria. Factors (socio-economic and institutional) considered in the inefficiency effects model include household size, sex, age, years of schooling, farming experience in soybean production, health status, off-farm employment, <b>non-family</b> <b>labour,</b> credit accessibility, land fragmentation and extension contact. The parameters of the stochastic frontier translog production function are estimated contemporaneously with {{those involved in the}} inefficiency effects model. The results indicate that household size, age, <b>non-family</b> <b>labour</b> were significant and negatively related to the technical inefficiency while farming experience, off-farm employment, credit accessibility, land fragmentation, and extension contact were statistically significant and positively related to the inefficiency. The mean technical efficiency of the farmers is 0. 84. This means that the farmers can still improve their efficiency level by 16 %...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to investigate how sustainable agriculture is being conceptualized and implemented in Saskatchewan. Zero tillage, organic farming, and the discourses surrounding them were examined as theoretical and practical responses to sustainable agriculture. Characteristics of 33 organic and 33 zero tillage farming systems located throughout the soil climatic zones of southern Saskatchewan were compared, as well as farmers' perceptions of sustainable agriculture and factors influencing their management decisions. The analysis was extended beyond the local level by examining the links between major socio-political forces shaping agriculture and farmers' perceptions and choices. Central to this analysis is an examination of the role of informal and formal knowledge systems in the development of sustainable agriculture, and how relations of power affect the knowledge that is being produced and ultimately the direction of change in agriculture. Interdisciplinary and exploratory approaches were used to identify and examine a range of emergent issues. The data gathered was analyzed both quantitatively and qualitatively. This study revealed commonalities between zero tillage and organic farmers' basic views on sustainable agriculture, and important differences in the ways these two groups of farmers translated these ideas into practice. Most farmers defined sustainability at the farm-level, focusing on land stewardship and the preservation of the family farm. Farmers adopted zero tillage because of specific environmental, economic and labour advantages, whereas organic farming was adopted for a combination of environmental, health, economic, philosophical/spiritual and labour factors. In general, zero tillage and organic farming systems differed in size, in production and management operations, in land tenure, and in the use of purchased inputs and labour. Zero tillage farms tended to be large, capital-intensive, specialized cropping operations, with a significant proportion of rented land and <b>non-family</b> hired <b>labour.</b> Organic farms were moderate-sized, diversified crop and livestock operations that substituted biological and cultural practices for purchased (agrochemical) inputs, had a high degree of ownership, and relied more upon labour exchange. These characteristics create distinct environmental, economic and social advantages and disadvantages. Zero tillage, compatible with the dominant agricultural paradigm and the industrial model, continues to be promoted by agricultural institutions and agribusiness as the best solution to farm-level sustainability. Interest in organic agriculture and the alternative agricultural paradigm is increasing, however, due to the current crisis in the farm economy and changes in consumers' perceptions and choices...|$|R
40|$|This article evaluates {{a hybrid}} seed {{contract}} between Indonesian smallholders and Pioneer Hybrid International. A transaction cost approach {{was used to}} analyse contract participation, total farm gross margins and labour and chemical use. The empirical results suggest: (a) the contract favours farmers with more irrigated land; (b) the contract improved returns to farm capital and was welfare improving; (c) the contract increased the demand for <b>non-family</b> <b>labour,</b> particularly female labour; and (d) the contract increased the intensity of chemical use. The success of the contract was attributed {{to the nature of}} the contracting process, which was between Pioneer and grower groups and not individual smallholders. ...|$|E
40|$|A {{survey of}} farms and farm {{households}} {{in three different}} areas of Sweden {{makes it possible to}} study the position of family farms, as compared to other farm types. Based on patterns of labour use and sources of income, a theoretically grounded farm typology is suggested. Such a typology is offered as an alternative to arbitrary criteria in terms of acreage, turnover or total labour, which can never be generalized, nor used in longitudinal or comparative studies. The sample illustrates the striking similarities in social set-up between the intensive agriculture in the plains of southern Sweden and that in the northern parts of the country. The role of family and <b>non-family</b> <b>labour,</b> as well as the role of non-farm work and sources of income in the three study areas are analysed...|$|E
40|$|The study {{attempts}} {{to highlight the}} interrelation between three central points in the ongoing debate on {{the political economy of}} development: viability, surplus, and class-formation. A case study of the develop¬ment of rural labour systems in Northern Nigeria is meant to provide both a better qualitative and quantitative idea of this interrelation. After an analysis of the socio-economic effects of forced and bonded labour during colonial times, the articulation of different systems of family and <b>non-family</b> <b>labour</b> has been investigated. Class-specific effects of labour and capital input do even result in an increasing use of communal labour by rich and middle peasants after the Nigerian Civil War: its form remains, but its content changes fundamentally. The socio-economic and material base for small-scale peasant subsistence production has been gradually destroyed. ...|$|E
40|$|Small-farmer {{types in}} {{southern}} Africa differ significantly {{in terms of}} factor-input patterns and support structures. On peasant family farms (PFF) cash input costs are very low, non-household labour is sourced largely from communal work groups through kinship ties, and support services needed to sustain production are minimal. By contrast, on commercial family farms (CFF) cash input costs are high, little <b>non-family</b> <b>labour</b> is used and strong support services are necessary. The first objective {{of this article is}} to point out and emphasise the different situations which exist in these two small-family farm types, based on data from farm studies in Northern Namibia. The second objective is to extract the implications of these differences in relation to development paths under land reform. This is based on experiences of the outcome of land reform in Latin America. It is concluded that the agrarian situation in post-land reform South Africa will comprise a mix of large-scale commercial farms and small-scale farms of both the PFF and CFF types. It will be necessary to recognise the existence of each of these types and their interrelationships, to monitor their development, to understand their different production situations and to cater for their different needs. ...|$|E
40|$|EAGESTAD INRASeveral public {{policies}} {{have been set up}} at the regional, national and European levels to reduce the negative impacts of intensive agriculture. Here, we wonder what are the determinants – social, economic, etc. - of the reduction of herbicide use? We focus the determinants of farmers' adoption of agri-environmental schemes (AES). Many factors influence farmers’ adoption. First, the importance of farm incomes in total incomes {{have been shown to be}} negatively correlated to AES adoption. The same conclusion was observed with the total family time spent at work. A determinant which is important for the probability to contract is the total farm labour supply per year (family and <b>non-family</b> <b>labour)</b> : the more workforce farmers already have, the more they contract. However, although several studies have investigated the determinant of AES adoption, others determinants such as the level of debts remain to be investigated. Moreover, determinants have generally been investigated independently without looking at social, economic and environmental motivations altogether. After conducting a literature review, we will therefore carry out an econometric analysis to evaluate the influence of a wide range of determinants based on survey questionnaire sent to farmers. In this presentation, we will present first results...|$|E
40|$|From {{insecurity}} to hate - the crofter question's moral {{economy in}} {{turn of the}} century Finland By Matti Peltonen Finnish peasant farming was not very commercially oriented {{at the beginning of the}} 20 th century and only some third of the total value of all agricultural and forestry produce was sold on the market. The use of <b>non-family</b> <b>labour</b> was quite common in peasant farming, the most important part of this being the work that was carried out by agricultural labourers who were hired on an annual basis. Another important category of work was that done by the numerous, small tenant-farmers ("torppari" and "mäkitupalainen") and members of their families on the landowners' land in return for the tenantfarmers' right to use some of the arable land and/or pasture land owned by the landowner. Many peasant farms were, however, difficult to run on a profitable basis, as was reflected in the rising level of the land rents. The majority of landowners in Finland at that time were peasants and the problems of tenant-farming were therefore experienced as a conflict between two strata of peasant farmers - the landowners and the tenantfarmers. Ineffective land lease legislation reforms led to a crisis at the beginning of the 20 th century which could only be solved by allowing all tenantfarmers to become landowners themselves. This reform in land ownership relations began a more distinct development towards the family-farm model which was already common in industrialized countries...|$|E
