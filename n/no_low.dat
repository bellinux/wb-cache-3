500|$|Typical of sealed-box {{speakers}} of similar size, the 3/5A {{has little or}} <b>no</b> <b>low</b> bass, but the design reinforced its lower register by a boost at around 160Hz, giving the subjective impression that the speaker is more bass-rich. It has a gently rising frequency response above 5kHz, leading reviewers to notice the sound being a little bright at the treble registers, or that the speakers [...] "reproduce the high-end roughness of solid-state amplifiers mercilessly" [...] thus suggested partnering with valve amplification would be advantageous. A slight nasal quality in the midrange has also been noted in the earlier versions. The accuracy and stability of its stereo imaging and its clean midrange reproduction are also appreciated qualities. J. Gordon Holt suggests that the quality was [...] "comparable to that from Quad Electrostatics, at far lower cost and with added bonuses of slightly smoother high end, better stereo imaging, a broader listening area". John Atkinson suggests in Stereophile that the LS3/5A is ideally suited to the reproduction of program having a limited dynamic-range requirement, for example chamber music; {{he said that the}} LS3/5A [...] "has never boogied and never will; it's just too polite ever to cut the mustard on rock, or even straightahead jazz".|$|E

2500|$|The Eagle's thick {{viscous fluid}} center {{differential}} provided quiet and smooth {{transfer of power}} that was directed proportionally to the axle with the greatest traction. This was a true full-time system operating only in four-wheel drive without undue wear on suspension or driveline components. There was <b>no</b> <b>low</b> range in the transfer case. This became the forerunner of the designs that followed from other manufacturers. The automobile press at the time tested the traction of the Eagles and described it as far superior to the Subaru's {{and that it could}} beat many so-called off-road vehicles. Four Wheeler magazine concluded that the AMC Eagle was [...] "The beginning {{of a new generation of}} cars." ...|$|E

6000|$|It will be {{seen from}} his tone that Mr. Gladstone, in all the embarrassments arising from this source, showed {{complete}} freedom from personal irritation. Like the lofty-minded man he was, he imputed <b>no</b> <b>low</b> motives to a colleague because the colleague gave him trouble. He recognised by now that in his cabinet the battle was being fought between old time and new.

He had, moreover, quite enough to do with (M68) the demands of the present, apart from signs that were ominous for the future. A year before, in a letter to Lord Granville (March 24, 1884), he had attempted a definition that will, perhaps, be of general interest to politicians of either party complexion.

While few of us enter into the exultation of successful vulgarity, as it rejoices in its too often random prosperity, it is in nature to sympathize with a downward progress, and with the sentiments it leaves, when it is connected with the fates of the innocent, the virtuous, and the educated. That set of silver was all that remained to Ursula Malbone of a physical character, and which marked the former condition of her family; and doubtless she cherished it with <b>no</b> <b>low</b> feeling of morbid pride, but as a melancholy monument of a condition to which all her opinions, tastes, and early habits constantly reminded her she properly belonged. In this last point of view, the sentiment was as respectable, and as much entitled to reverence, as in the other case {{it would have been}} unworthy, and meriting contempt.|$|E

He had <b>no</b> <b>low</b> tastes, and was perfectly to be relied on for all essential points; but Mr. Dobbs owned {{that he should be}} relieved by parting with him, as he was not liked by his fellows, and was thought by the foremen to give himself airs. Quarrels and misunderstandings had arisen so often, that he himself had been obliged to exert an influence on his behalf, which he feared might make him obnoxious to the accusation of partiality. He considered that the lad had worth, substance, and promise far beyond his fellows; but his blunt, haughty manners, impatience of rough jokes, and rude avoidance of the unrefined, made him the object of their dislike, so that it was probable that he would thrive much better abroad and in authority; and at his age, he was more likely to adapt himself to circumstances, and learn a new language, than an older man, more used to routine.|$|E
