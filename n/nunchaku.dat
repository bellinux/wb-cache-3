5|$|The {{rise in the}} {{popularity}} of the bat'leth has {{led to the formation of}} martial arts teams aiming to develop a martial art distinct from the one Curry initially developed. Such teams have incorporated moves from ju-jitsu, kendo, kinjitsu and <b>nunchaku.</b> Bat'leth competitions have been held at conventions such as MileHiCon and StarCon.|$|E
5|$|As a {{character}} introduced in Soul Edge, Li Long's weapon, {{a pair of}} <b>nunchaku</b> with mounted blades, were selected before {{other elements of the}} character. One of several weapons initially considered for the character Hwang early in development, they were designed to be unique amongst the other weapons in the game. Li Long's design and concept were built to revolve around them, starting with gender, then physical measurements, and lastly background details. After his appearance and movement were fleshed out by a concept artist, his character was rendered as a 3D model by a design team that worked solely on him, and then animated by a motion designer using motion capture to create his in-game movements. During development, many ideas were considered for Li Long's appearance, including several younger drafts. Another idea considered was for him to fight using kung fu, instead of solely with his <b>nunchaku.</b>|$|E
5|$|Selphie was {{the second}} {{character}} that Nomura drew, after Squall, intentionally giving her an impractical hairstyle. When he first designed Selphie, Nomura drew her in overalls; however, he realized {{that none of the}} characters would be wearing a skirt. In the end, he gave Selphie a mini-skirt and let Quistis have pants. In the Kingdom Hearts series, Nomura included a younger version of Selphie as a resident of Destiny Islands, and uses a jump rope instead of <b>nunchaku.</b> She is voiced by Mayuko Aoki in the Japanese version, and by Molly Marlette in the English version.|$|E
5|$|Due to a ban of <b>nunchaku</b> {{weapons in}} the United Kingdom, his weapon was changed to a three-section staff for European {{releases}} of Soul Blade, with a section of staff replacing the chain in terms of appearance. Li Long was initially considered for inclusion for Soulcalibur, however the developers instead decided to focus on creating a new character using the same weapon for the title, resulting in Maxi. Later, due to the character's popularity, Li Long was selected {{to be included in}} home and arcade versions of Soulcalibur III. In an interview, Soulcalibur IV director Katsutoshi Sasaki stated many fans had requested for the character to reappear in the series, though added no plans had been made to release the character as downloadable content for the title.|$|E

Weapons include bo, jo, eiku, tan bo, tonfa, <b>nunchaku,</b> chizikun bo, sai, nunte bo, manji sai, kama, and suruchin.|$|E
25|$|Like its predecessor, {{the second}} Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles {{installment}} was censored in the UK due to usage of forbidden weapons (the <b>nunchaku),</b> most notably {{during the opening}} credits sequence where Michelangelo imitates their use by swinging a pair of sausages. The edits were waived for the DVD release in 2002. The German version was not censored visually; however, funny cartoon sound effects to soften the violence {{were added to the}} fight scenes (as with the first film).|$|E
500|$|In Soulcalibur III, Li Long {{represents}} the game's [...] "nunchaku" [...] fighting style available to player-created characters through the game's character creation mode. Though the style utilized several elements from Maxi, many elements were altered, including attack commands, stance, {{and a separate}} series of weapons. With the character's inclusion in the arcade edition of Soulcalibur III, alterations were made to further define Li Long's fighting style as unique, modifying several attacks to utilize two <b>nunchaku</b> simultaneously as a result.|$|E

In addition to battle, she pilots the Ragnarok starship.|$|E
500|$|In a 2002 poll by Namco {{prior to}} the release of Soulcalibur II {{regarding}} their favorite character from the series, Li Long placed last, part of a three-way tie with 1% of the poll's results. MAXIMUM, on the other hand, described him as [...] "one of the most dramatic characters in the game", citing visible similarity to actor Bruce Lee's use of <b>nunchaku.</b> Retronauts in their retrospective of the series cited Li Long as an aspect of Soul Edge not included in later titles they missed. Comparisons have been drawn between the character and later series character Maxi, with sources such as 1UP.com stating preference for the former. GameDaily staff writer Eugene Huang shared the sentiment while naming him as one of his favorite characters, describing his attacks as [...] "focused around efficacy and efficiency" [...] and praising the character as having a compelling backstory.|$|E

[...] The case involved a state ban on <b>Nunchaku</b> sticks (a martial arts weapon) in New York. In a memorandum opinion dated June 29, 2010, the Supreme Court vacated the Second Circuit decision in Maloney and remanded for further consideration in light of the holding in McDonald v. City of Chicago that the Second Amendment does apply to the states. [...] The Second Circuit has remanded the case to the trial court.|$|E
2500|$|Members of the Okinawan {{upper classes}} {{were sent to}} China {{regularly}} to study various political and practical disciplines. The incorporation of empty-handed Chinese Kung Fu into Okinawan martial arts occurred partly because of these exchanges {{and partly because of}} growing legal restrictions on the use of weaponry. Traditional karate kata bear a strong resemblance to the forms found in Fujian martial arts such as Fujian White Crane, Tai Zu Quan or Grand Ancestors Fist, Five Ancestors, and Gangrou-quan (Hard Soft Fist; pronounced [...] "Gōjūken" [...] in Japanese). Many Okinawan weapons such as the sai, tonfa, and <b>nunchaku</b> may have originated in and around Southeast Asia.|$|E
2500|$|The Nunchuk (model number RVL-004) is {{the first}} {{attachment}} Nintendo revealed for the Wii Remote at the 2005 Tokyo Game Show.

[...] It also resembles the middle handle of the Nintendo 64 controller. It features an analog stick {{similar to the one}} found on the GameCube controller and two trigger buttons (a last-minute modification changed the two triggers to one trigger and a [...] button, as described below).

Chinese <b>nunchaku</b> tend to be rounded, whereas Okinawan ones are octagonal, and they were originally linked by horse hair. There are many variations on the <b>nunchaku,</b> ranging from the three sectional staff (san-setsu-kon, mentioned later in this article), to smaller multi-section <b>nunchaku.</b> The <b>nunchaku</b> was popularized by Bruce Lee {{in a number of}} films, made in both Hollywood and Hong Kong.
