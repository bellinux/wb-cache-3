25|$|<b>Nimesulide</b> {{undergoes}} extensive biotransformation, {{mainly to}} 4-hydroxynimesulide (which {{also appears to}} be biologically active).|$|E
25|$|Several {{reports have}} been made of adverse drug {{reactions}} in India. On February 12, 2011, Indian Express reported that the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare finally had decided to suspend the pediatric use of the analgesic, <b>Nimesulide</b> suspension. From 10 March 2011 onward <b>Nimesulide</b> formulations are not indicated for human use in children below 12 years of age.|$|E
25|$|On September 13, 2011 Madras High Court revoked a {{suspension}} on manufacture {{and sale of}} paediatric drugs <b>nimesulide</b> and phenylpropanolamine (PPA).|$|E
25|$|It is {{sold under}} many trade names {{worldwide}} and in combinations with cefixime, <b>nimesulide,</b> ambroxol, and with both tinidazole and fluconazole.|$|E
25|$|Moderate renal {{impairment}} does not necessitate dosage adjustment, while {{in patients with}} severe {{renal impairment}} or hepatic impairment, <b>Nimesulide</b> is contraindicated.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} therapeutic {{drugs were}} {{withdrawn from the}} market primarily because of hepatotoxicity: Troglitazone, bromfenac, trovafloxacin, ebrotidine, <b>nimesulide,</b> nefazodone, ximelagatran and pemoline.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{concerns}} {{about the risk of}} hepatotoxicity, <b>nimesulide</b> has been withdrawn from market in several countries (Spain, Finland, Belgium, and Ireland).|$|E
25|$|<b>Nimesulide</b> has a {{relatively}} rapid onset of action, with meaningful reductions {{in pain and}} inflammation observed within 15 minutes from drug intake.|$|E
25|$|On September 21, 2007 the EMA {{released}} {{a press release}} on their review on the liver-related safety of <b>nimesulide.</b> The EMA has concluded {{that the benefits of}} these medicines outweigh their risks, but {{that there is a need}} to limit the duration of use to ensure that the risk of patients developing liver problems is kept to a minimum. Therefore, the EMA has limited the use of systemic formulations (tablets, solutions, suppositories) of <b>nimesulide</b> to 15 days.|$|E
25|$|It is {{also sold}} as a {{combination}} drug with <b>nimesulide</b> as Zitroflam; in a combination with tinidazole and fluconazole as Trivafluc, and in a combination with ambroxol as Zathrin-AX, Laz-AX and Azro-AM.|$|E
25|$|A recent {{evaluation}} {{from the}} European Medicines Agency (EMA) {{concluded that the}} overall benefit/risk profile of <b>nimesulide</b> is favourable and in line {{with that of the}} other NSAIDs such as diclofenac, ibuprofen, and naproxen.|$|E
25|$|The {{therapeutic}} {{effects of}} <b>Nimesulide</b> {{are the result}} of its complex mode of action, which targets a number of key mediators of the inflammatory process such as: COX-2 mediated prostaglandins, free radicals, proteolytic enzymes, and histamine.|$|E
25|$|It may {{be taken}} through {{prescription}} {{in the treatment of}} acute (short term) pain, and primary dysmenorrhea (period pains). <b>Nimesulide</b> should never be taken long-term, as for chronic conditions such as arthritis. This is due to its association with an increased risk of liver toxicity, including fulminant hepatic failure.|$|E
25|$|<b>Nimesulide</b> is a nonsteroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drug (NSAID) {{with pain}} medication and fever reducing properties. Its approved indications are {{the treatment of}} acute pain, the symptomatic treatment of osteoarthritis, and primary dysmenorrhoea in adolescents and adults above 12 years old. It has a multifactorial mode of action and {{is characterized by a}} fast onset of action.|$|E
25|$|It was {{launched}} in Italy {{for the first time}} as Aulin and Mesulid in 1985 and is available in more than 50 countries worldwide, including among others France, Portugal, Greece, Switzerland, Belgium, Russia, Thailand, and Brazil. <b>Nimesulide</b> has never been filed for Food and Drug Administration (FDA) evaluation in the United States, where it is not marketed.|$|E
25|$|The Irish Medicines Board (IMB) {{has decided}} to suspend <b>Nimesulide</b> from the Irish market and refer it to the EU Committee for Human Medicinal Products (CHMP) {{for a review of}} its benefit/risk profile. The {{decision}} is due to the reporting of six (6) cases of potentially-related liver failures to the IMB by the National Liver Transplant Unit, St. Vincent Hospital. These cases occurred in the period from 1999 to 2006.|$|E

2500|$|In May 2008, Italy's leading daily paper Corriere della Sera {{and other}} media outlets {{reported}} that a top-ranking official at Italy's medicines agency AIFA had been filmed by police while accepting bribes from employees of pharmaceutical companies. [...] The money allegedly was being paid to ensure that certain drugs would be spared scrutiny from the drugs watchdog. The investigation had started in 2005 following suspicions that some AIFA drug tests had been faked. Eight arrests were made. <b>Nimesulide</b> can be bought carrying a prescription from a physician that is kept as a receipt at the chemist shop, nominally allowing strong control over selling.|$|E
