Foreign {{nationals}} working in Iran are also {{subject to the same}} income tax based on their salary. Non-resident individuals are liable to pay tax only on their Iranian-sourced income. Foreign employees cannot obtain an exit visa from Iran unless they provide proof that they have paid their due taxes, and since they need to obtain an exit permit when their presence in Iran is based on a work permit, the government can easily enforce this rule. The government assumes a certain salary for employees depending on their position and country of origin. The assumed minimum monthly salaries in 2004 range from US$2,500 for unskilled European workers to US$7,000 for European managing directors.|$|E

Purpose The link between the nutritional habits of pregnant women both of Italian and foreign <b>nationality</b> <b>resident</b> <b>in</b> Italy and the presence of ochratoxin A in cord blood and in maternal milk was investigated. Methods The study involved 130 pregnant women. Food consumption during pregnancy was evaluated by means of the EPIC questionnaire; OTA content was determined in cord serum and maternal milk by HPLC.

The incidence of positive milk samples was 73. 0 and 85. 0 % among the Italian and non-Italian mothers, respectively. Pork meat, soft drinks, sweets and red wine showed a significant relationship with OTA level in serum. As far as milk is concerned, a positive relationship resulted for pork meat, sweets, soft drinks and seed oils. A positive relationship between serum OTA level and the ratio serum/milk OTA was found. The intake of OTA had no effect on the cord blood creatinine level. Conclusions This study confirms that OTA is widely present in human milk and therefore could pose a risk for the newborn...|$|E
50|$|Tsai's {{interactive}} sculpture {{marked a}} major step {{in the development of}} kinetic art:A major portion of luminist and kinetic art originated in Europe, beginning with the formation in 1960 of GRAV (Groupe de Recherche d’Art Visuel) by eleven artists of different <b>nationalities,</b> all <b>resident</b> <b>in</b> Paris. Wen-Ying Tsai is an American associate who showed with that group at the Galerie Denise Rene, which made its reputation on technology art. Tsai is a Chinese-born sculptor now living in New York. The slender, stainless steel “cybernetic” rods of his sculpture vibrate in different patterns in response to electronic impulses, to the clapping of human hands, or to the flashes of a strobe light. In the artist’s words, they are designed to simulate “the intensity of a living creature.” While the contemporary interest in light and kinetic sculpture is in a sense traditional, and dates back at least to Naum Gabo, to Marcel Duchamp, Moholy-Nagy and the Bauhaus, only in the postwar era has the artist tried consciously to use available computer and electronic technology to create robot works of art which can be activated environmentally.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The rapid {{socio-economic}} {{development in}} Qatar {{in the last}} two decades has encouraged a mass influx of immigrant workers, the majority of whom originate from countries with low socio-economic levels, inadequate medical care and many are known to carry patent intestinal helminth and protozoan infections on arrival in Qatar. Some eventually acquire residency status but little is known about whether they continue to harbour infections. Methods We examined 9208 hospital records of stool samples that had been analysed for the presence of intestinal helminth and protozoan ova/cysts, over the period 2005 - 2008, of subjects from 28 <b>nationalities,</b> but <b>resident</b> <b>in</b> Qatar and therefore not recent arrivals in the country. Results Overall 10. 2 % of subjects were infected with at least one species, 2. 6 % with helminths and 8. 0 % with protozoan species. Although hookworms, Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichuris trichiura and Hymenolepis nana were observed, the majority of helminth infections (69 %) were caused by hookworms, and these were largely aggregated among 20. 0 - 39. 9 year-old male subjects from Nepal. The remaining cases of helminth infection were mostly among Asian immigrants. Protozoan infections were more uniformly spread across immigrants from different regions when prevalence was calculated on combined data, but this disguised three quite contrasting underlying patterns for 3 taxa of intestinal protozoa. Blastocystis hominis, Giardia duodenalis and non-pathogenic amoebae were all acquired in childhood, but whereas prevalence of B. hominis rose to a plateau and then even further among the elderly, prevalence of G. duodenalis fell markedly in children aged 10 and older, and stayed low (Entamoeba coli, E. hartmanni, Endolimax nana and Iodamoeba buetschlii) peaked in the 30. 0 - 39. 9 age group and only then dropped to very low values among the oldest subjects examined. A worrying trend in respect of both helminth and protozoan parasites was the increase in prevalence over the period 2005 - 2008, in helminth infections prevalence increasing 2 - 3 fold by 2008, and in protozoan infections by 1. 5 - 2. 0 fold. Conclusions We suggest that helminth infections are probably acquired abroad when immigrants visit their home villages, whilst protozoan infections are reinforced by transmission in Qatar, possibly in the poorer areas of the state where immigrant workers live. We discuss the significance of these findings and emphasize that they have clear implications for the health authorities. </p...|$|R
