50|$|Although {{there is}} not {{international}} data available on worldwide infection rates per year, there are roughly 500-1000 documented cases of <b>nocardiosis</b> a year. Most of these cases occur in men, {{as there is a}} 3:1 ratio of male of female cases a year; however, this difference may be based on exposure frequency rather than susceptibility differences. From an age perspective, it is not highly more prevalent in one age group than another. Cutaneous <b>Nocardiosis</b> is slightly more common in middle aged men, but as a whole, all ages are susceptible. Additionally, there is no racial basis when it comes to becoming infected with <b>Nocardiosis.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{prognosis}} of <b>nocardiosis</b> {{is highly}} variable. The {{state of the}} host's health, site, duration, and severity of the infection all play parts in determining the prognosis. As of now, skin and soft tissue infections have a 100% cure rate, and pleuropulmonary infections have a 90% cure rate with appropriate therapy. The cure rate falls to 63% with those infected with dissemented <b>nocardiosis,</b> with only half of those surviving infections that cause brain abscess. Additionally, 44% {{of people who are}} infected in the spinal cord/brain die, increasing to 85% if that person has an already weakened immune system. Unfortunately, there is not a preventative to <b>nocardiosis.</b> The only recommendation is to protect open wounds to limit access.|$|E
50|$|Nocardia asteroides is {{a species}} of Nocardia. It can cause <b>nocardiosis,</b> a severe {{pulmonary}} infection in immunocompromised hosts.|$|E
50|$|It is one {{of several}} {{conditions}} that have been called the great imitator. Cutaneous <b>nocardiosis</b> commonly occurs in immunocompetent hosts.|$|E
50|$|A {{weakened}} {{immune system}} is a general indicator {{of someone who is}} more susceptible to <b>nocardiosis,</b> such as someone who already has a disease that weakens their immune system. Additionally, those with low T-cell counts or other complications involving T-cells can expect to have a higher chance of becoming infected. Besides those with weak immune systems, a local traumatic inoculation can cause <b>nocardiosis,</b> specifically the cutaneous, lymphocutaneous, and subcutaneous forms of the disease.|$|E
50|$|N. farcinica {{may be a}} causative {{agent of}} <b>nocardiosis</b> or of {{secondary}} infections in immunocompromised patients. Strains of this species have been isolated from human brain abscesses.|$|E
50|$|A {{pulmonary}} infiltrate is {{a substance}} denser than air, such as pus, blood, or protein, which lingers within the parenchyma of the lungs. Pulmonary infiltrates {{are associated with}} pneumonia, tuberculosis, and <b>nocardiosis.</b>|$|E
50|$|Diagnosis of <b>nocardiosis</b> {{can be done}} by {{a doctor}} using various {{techniques}}. These techniques include, but are not limited to: a chest x-rays of the lung, a bronchoscopy, a brain/lung/skin biopsy, or a sputum culture.|$|E
50|$|<b>Nocardiosis</b> {{requires}} {{at least}} 6 months of treatment, preferably with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole or {{high doses of}} sulfonamides. In patients who {{do not respond to}} sulfonamide treatment, other drugs, such as ampicillin, erythromycin, or minocycline, may be added.|$|E
5000|$|Nocard’s main {{contribution}} to medicine {{has been the}} discovery of the genre of bacteria which was named in his honor, Nocardia. It causes <b>nocardiosis,</b> a disease which manifests itself mainly in animals of economic importance, such as bovine farcy, for which he discovered the first Nocardia, named by him initially as Streptothrix farcinica. The Nocardia may also cause disease in humans, particularly in immunocompromised patients, such as those with AIDS.|$|E
50|$|Nocardia is a genus of weakly {{staining}} Gram-positive, catalase-positive, rod-shaped bacteria. It forms partially acid-fast beaded branching filaments (acting as fungi, {{but being}} truly bacteria). It contains {{a total of}} 85 species. Some species are nonpathogenic, while others are responsible for <b>nocardiosis.</b> Nocardia species are found worldwide in soil rich in organic matter. In addition, they are oral microflora found in healthy gingiva, as well as periodontal pockets. Most Nocardia infections are acquired by inhalation of the bacteria or through traumatic introduction.|$|E
40|$|<b>Nocardiosis</b> is an acute, {{subacute}} {{or chronic}} bacterial infection caused by {{several species of}} geophilic aerobic bacteria of the genus Nocardia. Cutaneous <b>nocardiosis</b> is an uncommon infectious disease that presents as primary cutaneous infection or as a sequale of disseminated pulmonary <b>nocardiosis.</b> Its rarity and as <b>nocardiosis</b> is not an AIDS defined disease it is often underreported. The global incidence of cutaneous <b>nocardiosis</b> is not exactly known. The frequency of <b>nocardiosis</b> in HIV patients has increased from 0. 3 to 1. 85 %. In Immunocompetent persons Primary Cutaneous <b>Nocardiosis</b> is more commonly seen among gardeners and agriculturists. We report a case of extensive primary facial cutaneous <b>nocardiosis</b> due to Nocardia asteroides, in an adult immunocompromised lady who had no pulmonary focus.

We also performed a literature review of previous reports on <b>nocardiosis.</b> Results: Totally 5 patients with <b>nocardiosis</b> was recruited as the subjects of our study with a median age of 46 years old (range, 41 – 52 years old). All the patients had underlying disease that could compromise the immune system. Among them, we identified 4 patients with pulmonary <b>nocardiosis,</b> 2 patients with brain <b>nocardiosis</b> and 2 patients with leg <b>nocardiosis.</b> Our study demonstrated that common computed tomography findings of pulmonary <b>nocardiosis</b> included nodule, mass, consolidation and cavitation.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundPulmonary <b>nocardiosis</b> {{is a rare}} but severe {{infection}} {{caused by}} Nocardia species. This study aimed at describing the clinical characteristics and prognosis of pulmonary <b>nocardiosis.</b> MethodsAn observational, retrospective study was undertaken of patients diagnosed with pulmonary <b>nocardiosis</b> over a 13 -year period at the Kinki-Chuo Chest Medical Center, Osaka, Japan. ResultsSeven patients with airway nocardial colonization and 59 patients with pulmonary <b>nocardiosis</b> were identified, one of whom had disseminated <b>nocardiosis.</b> Patients with pulmonary <b>nocardiosis</b> were predominantly male patients (73 %), {{with a mean age}} of 66 (range, 15 – 88) years. New-onset cough and dyspnea were the most common manifestations (76 %). Although 52 (88 %) patients had at least one underlying pulmonary disease, most patients did not appear to be systemically immunocompromised. The predominant abnormality on chest computed tomography in pulmonary <b>nocardiosis</b> was airspace consolidation (52 %), sometimes associated with cavitation. Multivariate Cox proportional-hazards analysis revealed the following significant and independent risk factors for overall mortality: age > 68 years (hazard ratio [HR], 4. 7; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 1. 6 – 14; p= 0. 05), pulmonary aspergillosis (HR, 8. 8; 95 % CI, 2. 4 – 33; p= 0. 01), and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMZ) resistance (HR, 4. 3; 95 % CI, 1. 6 – 11; p= 0. 04). ConclusionsClinicians should be aware that pulmonary <b>nocardiosis</b> can occur even in immunocompetent patients, especially those with an underlying pulmonary disease. In pulmonary <b>nocardiosis,</b> older age, pulmonary aspergillosis, and TMP-SMZ resistance are associated with increased risk of mortality...|$|E
40|$|Diagnosis of <b>nocardiosis</b> {{is often}} delayed {{because of the}} {{frequently}} nonspecific nature of the illness {{and because of the}} long incubation period required to isolate the organism in the microbiology laboratory. Past experience with serological methods for diagnosing <b>nocardiosis</b> have met with little success, primarily because there was no suitable antigen. Using a previously identified Nocardia asteroides-specific protein, we developed an en-zyme immunoassay for the rapid diagnosis of <b>nocardiosis.</b> We evaluated sera from 22 patients with <b>nocardiosis,</b> 83 hospitalized controls, and 21 patients with tuberculosis. Twenty (91070) of the sera from patients with <b>nocardiosis</b> had titers of antibody ~ 1 : 256, whereas all of the sera from controls and from patients with tuberculosis had titers < 1 : 256. This assay represents a highly sensitive and specific serodiagnostic tool for evaluating patients with possible <b>nocardiosis.</b> Disease caused by the bacterium Nocardia asteroides occurs in patients with and without immunological abnormalities. The spectrum of illness in patients infected with this species of Nocardia varies fro...|$|E
40|$|Background: <b>Nocardiosis</b> is an {{uncommon}} bacterial infection that {{is caused by}} aerobic actinomycetes of the genus Nocardia. This pathogen has emerged as an important cause of mortality and morbidity among both immunocompetent and (more commonly) immunocompromised hosts. The prevalence of <b>nocardiosis</b> is unknown in Saudi Arabia. Only sporadic cases of cutaneous <b>nocardiosis</b> have been reported. In this study, we performed a 10 -year retrospective review of all cases of <b>nocardiosis</b> identified at the King Fahad National Guard Hospital in Riyadh. Clinical presentation, risk factors, site of disease involvement, radiological features, and outcomes of 30 patients with pulmonary and disseminated <b>nocardiosis</b> are presented. Materials and Methods: A retrospective chart review of all cases of <b>nocardiosis</b> over the last ten years. Results: Thirty cases of <b>nocardiosis</b> were identified. The disease was more common in males. Fever and cough {{was the most common}} presentation. Most of the patients had an underlying pulmonary disease. Consolidation was the most prevalent radiological feature. Pleural effusion was common. Unfortunately, none of the isolates were sub-speciated. Cure was possible in 40 % of the cases. Ten percent of patients died, while follow-up {{on the rest of the}} patients was lost. Conclusion: <b>Nocardiosis</b> is not uncommon in Saudi Arabia. Cases are not restricted to the classical immunocompromised host. A database is urgently needed to better evaluate the prevalence of the illness among the Saudi population...|$|E

40|$|Background. <b>Nocardiosis</b> is a rare, {{life-threatening}} opportunistic infection, affecting 0. 04 % to 3. 5 % {{of patients}} after solid organ transplant (SOT). The {{aim of this}} study was to identify risk factors for Nocardia infection after SOT and to describe the presentation of <b>nocardiosis</b> in these patients. Methods. We performed a retrospective case-control study of adult patients diagnosed with <b>nocardiosis</b> after SOT between 2000 and 2014 in 36 European (France, Belgium, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Spain) centers. Two control subjects per case were matched by institution, transplant date, and transplanted organ. A multivariable analysis was performed using conditional logistic regression to identify risk factors for <b>nocardiosis.</b> Results. One hundred and seventeen cases of <b>nocardiosis</b> and 234 control patients were included. <b>Nocardiosis</b> occurred at a median of 17. 5 (range, 2 - 244) months after transplant. In multivariable analysis, high calcineurin inhibitor trough levels in the month before diagnosis (odds ratio [OR], 6. 11; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 2. 58 - 14. 51), use of tacrolimus (OR, 2. 65; 95 % CI, 1. 17 - 6. 00) and corticosteroid dose (OR, 1. 12; 95 % CI, 1. 03 - 1. 22) at the time of diagnosis, patient age (OR, 1. 04; 95 % CI, 1. 02 - 1. 07), and length of stay in the intensive care unit after SOT (OR, 1. 04; 95 % CI, 1. 00 - 1. 09) were independently associated with development of nocardiosis; low-dose cotrimoxazole prophylaxis was not found to prevent <b>nocardiosis.</b> Nocardia farcinica was more frequently associated with brain, skin, and subcutaneous tissue infections than were other Nocardia species. Among the 30 cases with central nervous system <b>nocardiosis,</b> 13 (43. 3 %) had no neurological symptoms. Conclusions. We identified 5 risk factors for <b>nocardiosis</b> after SOT.

40|$|<b>Nocardiosis</b> is {{increasingly}} being diagnosed {{because of a}} growing population of immunocompromised hosts and improvements in the detection of Nocardia species in clinical laboratories. Historically, sulphonamides have been the first-line therapy {{for the treatment of}} <b>nocardiosis,</b> but sulphonamides tend to have a high rate of drug allergy in clinical settings. In this report, we described a disseminated Nocardia farcinica infection that occurred in a patient with myasthenia gravis who suffered from multiple drug allergies and was successfully treated using linezolid. We undertook {{a review of the literature}} of previously reported cases of <b>nocardiosis</b> treated with linezolid. To date, only 15 cases of <b>nocardiosis</b> treated with linezolid have been published. All cases exhibited long-term tolerance of linezolid, and 14 of 15 cases showed either an improvement in or complete clearance of the infection.
