40|$|In my brief remarks, I {{consider}} {{what it means}} to return and rebind—that is to say, the significance of the re for Kristeva’s thought.   Kristeva does <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> binding or birth, or unbinding or death, but rather rebinding and rebirth, suggesting that it is a retrospective return rather than an original moment that is crucial.   The most significant moment, then, is not the moment of imaginary plenitude, nor the moment of originary loss, but rather the moment of rebirth that comes through rebinding after the loss of plenitude.  Indeed, Kristeva’s insistence on re-turning suggests that there is no originary moment of plenitude nor of castration or loss, but rather a constant movement of compensation for a recurrent loss.   By emphasizing rebinding and rebirth, she underscores not the loss as cutting wound but rather the healing power of signification, always already inherent within loss.   The flip-side of separation is reattachment.   And rather than just focus on the separation or cut, Kristeva looks to that which allows us to rebind and reattach in order to create relations that sustain us.   Both unbinding and binding are necessary for rebinding.   Thus, by focusing on rebinding, Kristeva insists on the process of unbinding and binding, and the oscillation between them. </p...|$|R

The CEC seeks to preserve and transmit Yup'ik values and traditions through a five-fold plan that includes youth culture camps.

The CEC pushed for this camp because of the decline in welfare services and the need for youth to know how to live as people did in the past, without relying on the cash economy. During the day, campers learned traditional subsistence activities. Evenings were reserved for "elder time. " The culture camp provided a modern means for the traditional training of young people to be good listeners and, in their turn, become speakers of truth. The emphasis on talk reflects the indigenous view of how young people should learn and elders teach.

Their long descriptions contained vivid metaphors to help young people retain what they said. Instead of individual qualities, the elders emphasized the importance of ongoing relationships.

40|$|Slow Tourism, a {{new type}} of tourism that {{originated}} in Italy, has the potential to change how we travel and how we embed sustainable practices in our destinations. This chapter traces its evolution, provides a critical interpretive critique of existing definitions, and develops a conceptual model that locates Slow Tourism within the context of sustainable practices. Slow Tourism and Slow Travel are treated as separate and potentially connected paradigms. Political will, corporate social responsibility, responsible communities, and political consumption are essential components of Slow Tourism and all are necessary for its successful implementation. In order to fully grasp the ‘attitude’ exemplified by Slow Tourism, it needs to be viewed {{in the context of a}} socio-political, grassroots movement that takes a firm stand (through mindful consumption, production, and lifestyle choices), draws a hard line (holds everyone responsible and accountable for its success), and that keeps a gentle hand (remains inextricably connected to both the pleasures of living a life – being human – as well as the protection of resources, both environmental and social, that make this good-life possible – being humane). Slow Tourism continues to evolve in unique and meaningful ways as more people and communities across the globe consider the consequences of their actions and take control over their time and responsibility for their choice. As a change agent, Slow Tourism is both an example of political consumption (i. e. mindful traveler choices with regards to time, meaningful engagement, purchases, and carbon footprint) as well as sustainable patterns of production, policies and practices (i. e. local-based tourism development that benefits the community and protects its uniqueness of place, culture and the environment).

The people of Mandar are usually {{practicing}} kuliwa ritual before going to fishing or venturing to a journey through the sea. It is an obliged ritual, which is done for inaugurating or welcoming something as in object or through ceremonial acts. For instance, to inaugurate the use and first voyage of a ship, or to acquire machine or other tools used for fishing (jala and gae’), {{and for the first}} time for fishing.

5000|$|Of the song, Cee Lo told MTV News: [...] "This song, I think, {{just has}} a broader appeal, because it's <b>just</b> <b>not</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> me, it's <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> us. It's {{a song about}} the nightlife and just kinda being out and living for the weekend. It's kinda got that 'working-class hero' quality too; I reference, you know, songs like Johnny Kemp's [...] "Just Got Paid". So it's a story that's been told before, and it's so true to life. ... We all work pretty hard {{throughout}} the week, and Friday and Saturday, you know, will always be special, so {{this is just a}} song to commemorate that." [...] In late January 2011, Cee Lo rescheduled his UK tour dates, with the five-show run now ending on March 31, 2011. [...] "Bright Lights Bigger City" [...] was released four days before the tour concluded, on March 27, 2011.|$|R
5000|$|The album's title {{reflects}} the band's [...] "just go for it" [...] mentality during the recording sessions. Part of {{the inspiration for}} this approach were the difficult Everything You Want sessions, where band members stressed out over every little detail of the album." [...] The band resolved to go with their instinct rather that worrying excessively, something they felt they had honed through {{two and a half}} years of touring since the last time they had recorded in the studio." [...] Scannell stated that, while none of the tracks overtly reference the September 11 attacks, the event did influence this mentality as well, having an important effect on his inspiration and emotions during the creation of the album.""A lot of the themes in these songs are about taking control of your life and living it the way you want to live it, and acting and doing and <b>not</b> <b>just</b> <b>talking</b> and thinking <b>about</b> it. It's really important in the big sense in a post 9/11 world to make sure we all live our life in a way where we feel good about it. There are certainly messages within some of the songs at certain points on the album that deal with feelings of loss and those types of emotions, and also some feelings of, 'Hey, I want to get up and dust myself off and get on with my life. Both of those could be seen as viable and relevant reactions to 9/11." ...|$|R
40|$|We {{have been}} invited to {{consider}} the relationship between Scripture and Theology with special reference to wisdom. The significance of wisdom in relation to biblical study can be conceived in at least two quite different ways. On the one hand, there is the familiar agenda of wisdom as an aspect of biblical religion, to be studied like any aspect of biblical religion. Familiar issues here include: the history and development of wisdom within Israel; {{the nature and extent of}} wisdom literature; the relationship between wisdom in Israel and wisdom in the ancient Near East; Jewish and early Christian developments and reworkings of wisdom, especially, in a Christian context, in relation to Christ; and so on. On the other hand, there is wisdom as an existential reality, less the object which one studies than that light and enablement whereby one's study is (one hopes) carried out. Here, of course, the familiar debates are those about the relationship between faith and biblical study, where the context is set by the fact that it was only by disentangling the Bible from certain kinds of faith-defined contexts and assumptions in the 18 th and 19 th centuries that biblical study could become a subject in its own right. Thankfully, the intense hermeneutical debates of recent decades have put an end (at least in principle) to the kinds of implicit positivism that could sometimes characterize biblical study in formal detachment from faith and theology. I hope that an emphasis on wisdom, rather than faith as such, may be one way of helping us to rethink what is, and is not, appropriate to our continuing responsibility to relate Scripture and Theology in imaginative, faithful, searching, and life-enhancing ways. Although all these issues could usefully be discussed as issues of principle, my preference is to work with the text of Scripture itself. For I take it that one element in the renewal of interaction between Scripture and theology is to show how theological thinking can be enhanced by attention to scriptural exegesis and interpretation; and if that is so, then it is more fruitful <b>not</b> <b>just</b> to <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> it but to try to do it. ...|$|R
