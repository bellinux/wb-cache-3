5|$|Academic {{criticism}} of Inseminoid has {{concentrated on the}} film's treatment of the female sex and female sexualities {{in the context of}} corruption by an alien source. In addition to its depiction of the abject Sandy, who is rendered a distorted Other in the aftermath of her unnatural impregnation, the film has been seen to incorporate a clash between the patriarchal and the maternal towards its climax, as the <b>new</b> <b>mother</b> kills her former friends one by one. Complementing the film's successful VHS run, a novelisation of Inseminoid was written by Larry Miller.|$|E
5|$|The {{project was}} reannounced {{three years later}} as Mother 3 for the Game Boy Advance {{alongside}} a combined Mother 1 + 2 cartridge for the same handheld console. Itoi {{had been working on}} porting Mother and Mother 2 to the Game Boy Advance, and based on encouragement what he predicted to be further pressure, decided to release Mother 3. The <b>new</b> <b>Mother</b> 3 abandoned the Nintendo 64 version's 3D graphics, but kept its plot. The game was developed by Brownie Brown and HAL Laboratory, published by Nintendo, and released in Japan on April 20, 2006, whereupon it became a bestseller. It did not receive a North American release on the basis that it would not sell.|$|E
5|$|Very {{little is}} known about the life span of right whales. One of the few {{well-documented}} cases is of a female North Atlantic right whale that was photographed with a baby in 1935, then photographed again in 1959, 1980, 1985, and 1992. Consistent callosity patterns ensured it was the same animal. She was last photographed in 1995 with a seemingly fatal head wound, presumably from a ship strike. By conservative estimates (e.g. she was a <b>new</b> <b>mother</b> who had just reached sexual maturity in 1935), she was nearly 70 years to more than 100 years of age, if not older. Research on the closely related bowhead whale exceeding 210 years or more suggests this lifespan is not uncommon and may even be exceeded.|$|E

After three months of being on baby duty 24 hours a day, every woman I've ever come across has, ordinary guilt aside, all but wept with joy at the prospect of a bowl of pasta and a glass of wine consumed somewhere other than Babyville. None of which would matter a jot, of course, had Cold Feet not been feted for reflecting the lives of its target audience.|$|E
5|$|While visiting Nintendo {{for other}} business, Itoi {{approached}} Shigeru Miyamoto about making Mother. When approved for a sequel, Itoi increased his involvement {{as a designer}} in the five-year development of EarthBound. When the project began to flounder, producer and later Nintendo president Satoru Iwata rescued the game. EarthBound English localizers were given great liberties when translating the Japanese game's cultural allusions. The American version sold poorly despite a multimillion-dollar marketing budget. Mother 3 was originally slated for release on the Nintendo 64 and its 64DD disk drive accessory, but was cancelled in 2000. Three years later, the project was reannounced for the Game Boy Advance alongside a rerelease of Mother and Mother 2 in a combined cartridge: Mother 1 + 2, released in 2003. The <b>new</b> <b>Mother</b> 3 abandoned the 3D graphics progress for a 2D style, and became a bestseller upon its release. EarthBound was rereleased for the Wii U Virtual Console in 2013, and Mother received its English-language debut in 2015 for the same platform, retitled EarthBound Beginnings.|$|E

Findings indicate the women were unprepared for the difficulties of new motherhood which was isolating and lacking in support. <b>New</b> <b>mothers</b> found little help from the health care professionals such as GPs, CHN and Midwives due to professional time constraints and inability to develop a relationship. In addition <b>new</b> <b>mothers</b> were uncertain how unwell they needed to be before seeking help.

Her research name, given to her by the Kalahari Meerkat Project researchers, is actually Baddiel. In the first episode, Tosca showed signs of pregnancy. When the pups were born two episodes later, Flower declined to exercise her right to kill them and allowed them to be accepted into the family. [...] Three episodes later, while the pups were only seven weeks old, Flower evicted Tosca from the Whiskers, forcing the <b>new</b> <b>mother</b> to leave her pups behind. When the Whiskers were temporarily split into two groups in the next episode, Tosca found the splinter group and took over leadership from her sister Daisy. Believing the split would be permanent, Tosca was then fitted with a radio collar by the project researchers. However, the two groups reunited, and after Flower resumed her role as dominate female of the group, she permanently and viciously evicted Tosca.|$|E

500|$|After Mother 3, Shigesato Itoi {{declared}} that he {{was done with the}} series. In response to Nintendo's seeming indifference to another Mother sequel, fans began to develop their own entry, Mother 4, in October 2010. As of September 2016, the Mother 4 development team had not received a cease and desist letter from Nintendo. In a preview of the game, Jason Schreier of Kotaku said Mother 4 looked [...] "stunning", as [...] "everything you could possibly want out of a <b>new</b> <b>Mother</b> game", from the music to the environment design. The fan-made game was planned for release in 2014 but has been delayed twice. No future release date has been set. Mother 4 will be playable as a standalone game, without need for an emulator. In March 2017, however, the team announced that as a preventative measure from getting taken down, the game would be rebranded, with 'Mother 4' no longer being the title of the game, and all direct references to the Mother series, like Mr. Saturn, removed. The decision came after many recent fan games received a DMCA notice.|$|E

500|$|Wollstonecraft {{soon became}} {{pregnant}} by Imlay, and on 14 May 1794 {{she gave birth}} to her first child, Fanny, naming her after perhaps her closest friend. Wollstonecraft was overjoyed; she wrote to a friend: [...] "My little Girl begins to suck so MANFULLY that her father reckons saucily on her writing {{the second part of the}} Rts of Woman" [...] (emphasis hers). She continued to write avidly, despite not only her pregnancy and the burdens of being a <b>new</b> <b>mother</b> alone in a foreign country, but also the growing tumult of the French Revolution. While at Le Havre in northern France, she wrote a history of the early revolution, An Historical and Moral View of the French Revolution, which was published in London in December 1794. Imlay, unhappy with the domestic-minded and maternal Wollstonecraft, eventually left her. He promised that he would return to Le Havre where she went to give birth to her child, but his delays in writing to her and his long absences convinced Wollstonecraft that he had found another woman. Her letters to him are full of needy expostulations, explained by most critics as the expressions of a deeply depressed woman but by some as a result of her circumstances—alone with an infant in the middle of a revolution.|$|E
