Since no distress message had been sent, <b>nobody</b> <b>even</b> knew that they had crashed. McGruder received a head injury in the crash, and went into a life-threatening coma. Even though Dredd was a prisoner he assumed command, since none of the ship crew (who now all technically outranked him) were competent or experienced {{enough to keep the}} survivors alive.|$|E

His remarks were formally criticised by Nicholas Burns, the US Under-Secretary of State, who said: [...] "We {{are not going to}} agree to accept limited enrichment." [...] ElBaradei later criticized the US position and said, [...] "I have seen the Iranians ready to accept putting a cap on their enrichment [...] in terms of tens of centrifuges, and then in terms of hundreds of centrifuges. But <b>nobody</b> <b>even</b> tried to engage them on these offers. Now Iran has 5,000 centrifuges. The line was, 'Iran will buckle under pressure.'

When the coffin was put down into the tomb, Maria Feodorovna stood next to Xenia, holding her arm-in-arm and suddenly, looking at her daughter with widely open, unseeing eyes, she loudly said, [...] "Let's go home.

When a board was laid down for leaving the tomb, she went away so quickly that it was difficult for others to keep pace with her. <b>Nobody</b> <b>even</b> had enough time to throw flowers on to the tomb.

Here suspicion has become a monomania. Anglo-Indians see Russian spies even in their own shoes, and this drives them to madness… They watch every new arrival from one province to another, even should he be an Englishman. People have been deprived not only of every weapon, but of all knives and axes. The peasant can hardly chop his wood, or protect himself from a tiger. But the English are still afraid. It is true that here there are but 60,000 of them, while the native population numbers 245 million. And their system which they took over from successful animal-tamers, is good only until the animal senses his tamer is fearful in his turn… Then his hour has come! At all events, such a manifestation of chronic fear merely admits a recognition of one's own weakness." ...|$|E

She said that she had not mourned the deaths of either of her parents because she had no emotional bond to them.|$|E

They added for those who needed the knowledge that the name was pronounced Yahhy-Bahhy, and that the doctrine taught by Mr. Yahi-Bahi was Boohooism. This latter, if anyone inquired further, was explained to be a form of Shoodooism, only rather more intense. In fact, it was esoteric--on receipt of which information everybody remarked at once how infinitely superior the Oriental peoples are to ourselves.|$|E

First, they expressed this resentment by staring indignantly at him, then by laughing at him, then by making sarcastic remarks on him. He bore their ridicule with the most perfect and provoking coolness. He did not expostulate, or retort, or look angry, or grow red in the face, or fidget in his seat, or get up to go away.

When they struggle so far as to be allowed to try to read a piece of Greek prose, they are only like the Marchioness in her experience of beer: she once had a sip of it.

Brown held both his skinny hands together behind his back in the grip of one vast fist, and now and then impelled him forward with a fierce push. Cornelius remained as mute as a fish, abject but faithful to his purpose, whose accomplishment loomed before him dimly. At the edge of the patch of forest Brown's men spread themselves out in cover and waited.
