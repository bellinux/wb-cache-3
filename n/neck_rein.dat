25|$|Western riding is a {{style of}} horseback riding which evolved from the {{ranching}} and warfare traditions brought to the Americas by the Spanish Conquistadors, and both equipment and riding style evolved to meet the working needs of the cowboy in the American West. American cowboys needed to work long hours in the saddle over rough terrain, sometimes needing to rope cattle with a lariat (or lasso). Because of the necessity to control the horse {{with one hand and}} use a lariat with the other, western horses were trained to <b>neck</b> <b>rein,</b> that is, to change direction with light pressure of a rein against the horse's neck. Horses were also trained to exercise a certain degree of independence in using their natural instincts to follow the movements of a cow, thus a riding style developed that emphasized a deep, secure seat, and training methods encouraged a horse to be responsive on very light rein contact.|$|E
50|$|A <b>neck</b> <b>rein</b> {{is a type}} of {{indirect}} rein aid. The horse responds to a <b>neck</b> <b>rein</b> when it has learned that a light pressure of the right rein against its neck on that side means for the horse to turn left, and vice versa.|$|E

50|$|In polo, a pelham bit {{is one of}} the two bits most {{commonly}} used (the other being a gag bit). Double reins are held in one hand. <b>Neck</b> <b>reining</b> is used almost exclusively, and riders have little or no need to adjust the reins while riding. Draw reins are commonly used, on the snaffle ring. The rein lengths are adjusted so that the rein used normally is the snaffle rein, with the curb rein only coming into effect when needed. Such techniques are not legal in show disciplines and are exclusive to polo.|$|R
5000|$|A {{finished}} reining horse {{could be}} controlled and directed with minute movements of the fingers of the left hand, which hovered above the saddle horn. (Compare to the grazing-bit style of Western riding developed in Texas, where reins are split between the fingers and the hand moves {{in front of the}} saddle, controlling the horse by <b>neck</b> <b>reining.)</b> Because of the potential severity of the spade bit, chains added {{to the ends of the}} reins to balance the bit in the horse's mouth, and knotted and braided rawhide reins which prevented the reins from swinging unnecessarily, even at a lope, the [...] "made" [...] reining horse seemed to run, stop, spin and handle a cow on its own, with little communication from its rider.|$|R
50|$|The <b>neck</b> <b>rein</b> {{is used in}} both English {{riding and}} in Western riding, though the style differs between the disciplines.|$|E
5000|$|In English {{riding and}} other systems where {{the primary means}} of {{communication}} is light pressure between the rider's hands and the horse's mouth, light pressure is always maintained on the bit. The <b>neck</b> <b>rein</b> in English riding is used {{in addition to a}} direct rein and reinforces certain riding aids, particularly turns that require the horse to set back on its haunches, such as turns at high speeds when show jumping in a timed jump-off, or in events such as Dressage when performing a Pirouette. It is interesting to note, however, how many well-trained English horses seem to already know how to <b>neck</b> <b>rein</b> without being formally taught [...] - [...] further proof that the skill is primarily an outcome of encouraging responsiveness to the legs, weight and a light hand.|$|E
50|$|Western-style riding {{employs the}} use of the <b>neck</b> <b>rein.</b> The rider, holding the reins in one hand, moves that hand {{one way or the other}} so that the reins put {{pressure}} on the neck of the horse to ask it to turn. The bit does not come into play. This technique is also used occasionally by English-style riders.|$|E
500|$|Varian {{departed}} {{slightly from}} tradition. She started young horses under saddle {{at the age}} of three, beginning with a bridle and a snaffle bit because it sends clearer signals to a young horse, particularly one of sensitive disposition. [...] She then introduced the traditional hackamore, and, after a couple of months to transition between the hackamore and the snaffle, began teaching <b>neck</b> <b>reining,</b> which allows a horse to be ridden one-handed. After a year or two, when the horse became light in the hackamore, she introduced the young horse to the two-rein, using a light bosal with either a [...] "half-breed" [...] or a low-port curb bit. Once the horse understood the bit, the bosal was removed and the horse was ridden in just the curb bit for a while until ready to go into the full spade bit, at which point the horse went back into the two-rein when the spade is first introduced. She introduced horses to the spade bit {{at the age of}} seven or eight, if they had suitable conformation and temperament to carry it. When she selected and fully trained a spade bit horse for her own personal use, that particular horse stayed with her for life and was never sold.|$|R
5000|$|Indirect rein or bearing rein: {{pulls back}} inward in the {{direction}} of the horse's outside hip, without crossing over the <b>neck,</b> though the <b>rein</b> may touch the inside of the neck. This is usually used to correct straightness problems in the horse's neck and shoulders, as well as for lateral movements such as haunches-in.|$|R
60|$|She {{gave the}} animal his head, and he leaped cleanly and {{accurately}} to the ledge, striking with feet close {{together on the}} narrow space. On the instant he struck, Lute lightly touched his <b>neck</b> with the <b>rein,</b> impelling him to the left; and in that instant, tottering on the insecure footing, with front feet slipping over into the pool beyond, he lifted on his hind legs, with a half turn, sprang to the left, and dropped squarely down to the tiny gravel bed. An easy jump brought him across the stream, and Lute angled him up the bank and halted before her lover.|$|R

5000|$|In both disciplines, {{the horse}} should {{look in the}} {{direction}} it is going. Head tossing and turning the head {{to the outside of}} the turn are clear signs of bad training and/or faulty rider technique. Moving the hand slightly to the left brings the rein into contact {{on the right side of}} the horse's neck, and the horse learns to turn left, away from the pressure. Likewise, moving the hand to the right means for the horse to turn right. A horse that has been well trained to <b>neck</b> <b>rein</b> becomes so responsive to legs and seat that it is possible to take the bridle off completely [...] - [...] a move sometime seen in non-competitive exhibitions.|$|E
5000|$|Young {{horses are}} first taught {{to respond to}} a direct rein, with reins held in both of the rider's hands, turning the horse's head by {{tightening}} the rein {{on the side of the}} desired turn. The correct way to teach neck reining relies on perfecting the horse's responses to weight and leg aids while slowly using less direct rein pressure and introducing the feel of the rein against the neck as a cue. A young horse in training needs a reminder from time to time to look where it is going, but horses learn to <b>neck</b> <b>rein</b> fairly quickly, if trained properly. Occasionally trainers will use sloppy and incorrect methods such as crossing the reins under the neck or using reins with tacks or pins in them, but this poor level of horsemanship is thankfully not seen as often in western riding today as it was in years past.|$|E
50|$|In {{the version}} of the myth told by Ovid in the Metamorphoses, Phaethon ascends into heaven, {{the home of his}} {{suspected}} father. His mother Clymene had boasted that his father was the Sun-God or Phoebus. Phaethon went to his father who swore by the river Styx to give Phaethon anything he would ask for in order to prove his divine sonship. Phaethon wanted to drive the chariot of the sun for a day. Phoebus tried {{to talk him out of}} it by telling him that not even Jupiter (the king of the gods) would dare to drive it, as the chariot was fiery hot and the horses breathed out flames. He said:"The first part of the track is steep, and one that my fresh horses at dawn can hardly climb. In mid-heaven it is highest, where to look down on earth and sea often alarms even me, and makes my heart tremble with awesome fear. The last part of the track is downwards and needs sure control. Then even Tethys herself, who receives me in her submissive waves, is accustomed to fear that I might dive headlong. Moreover the rushing sky is constantly turning, and drags along the remote stars, and whirls them in rapid orbits. I move the opposite way, and its momentum does not overcome me as it does all other things, and I ride contrary to its swift rotation. Suppose you are given the chariot. What will you do? Will you be able to counter the turning poles so that the swiftness of the skies does not carry you away? Perhaps you conceive in imagination that there are groves there and cities of the gods and temples with rich gifts. The way runs through ambush, and apparitions of wild beasts! Even if you keep your course, and do not steer awry, you must still avoid the horns of Taurus the Bull, Sagittarius the Haemonian Archer, raging Leo and the Lion's jaw, Scorpio's cruel pincers sweeping out to encircle you from one side, and Cancer's crab-claws reaching out from the other. You will not easily rule those proud horses, breathing out through mouth and nostrils the fires burning in their chests. They scarcely tolerate my control when their fierce spirits are hot, and their <b>necks</b> resist the <b>reins.</b> Beware my boy, that I am not the source of a gift fatal to you, while something can still be done to set right your request!"Phaethon was adamant. When the day came, the fierce horses that drew the chariot felt that it was empty because of the lack of the sun-god's weight and went out of control. Terrified, Phaethon dropped the reins. The horses veered from their course, scorching the earth, burning the vegetation, bringing the blood of the Ethiopians to the surface of their skin and so turning it black, changing much of Africa into desert, drying up rivers and lakes and shrinking the sea. Earth cried out to Jupiter who was forced to intervene by striking Phaethon with a lightning bolt. Like a falling star, Phaethon plunged blazing into the river Eridanos.|$|R
