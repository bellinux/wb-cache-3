5|$|In an {{analysis}} of its components, IHS's iSuppli estimated that the production cost of the 16GB model of the Nexus7 is $159.25 per unit, $19 more per unit than Amazon.com's competing tablet, the Kindle Fire. The Nexus7's higher production costs were attributed to its use of a higher-quality display, a quad-core processor (instead of the Fire's dual-core), and its inclusion of a camera and <b>near</b> <b>field</b> communications (NFC) functionality. The firm's senior analyst Andrew Rassweiler suggested {{that the success of}} the HP TouchPad's fire sale helped increase the commercial viability of low-cost tablets from major brands, and the failures of other high-end tablets helped reduce the cost of parts, making tablets like the Kindle Fire and Nexus7 possible. However, he also noted that both tablets were being sold at thin profit margins, primarily due to their respective ties to content services.|$|E

5|$|The HTC One uses a unibody {{aluminum}} frame sourced from custom-grade aluminum; {{the choice of}} material was intended to give the device a solid, premium feel in comparison to smartphones made with a plastic shell. The frame is etched with channels in which the polycarbonate is inset using zero-gap injection molding. The polycarbonate forms a band {{around the edge of}} the device, covers the top and bottom ends, and bisects the back with two lines, one of which flows around the camera below. The two polycarbonate bands across the back are used to insulate its antennas, while the ring around the camera is used as a loop antenna for the One's <b>near</b> <b>field</b> communication (NFC) functionality. Alongside its display are two aluminum endpieces with a tight grid of laser-cut holes forming the speaker grilles behind which sit two stereo sound speakers; the metal volume keys are smoothly inlaid on the left side of the frame. The unibody frame itself takes at least 200 minutes of precision CNC cutting to machine, and the final result is a solid slate of anodized aluminum, white polycarbonate, and tempered glass with chamfered, polished edges.|$|E
40|$|We {{show that}} in a source-free subwavelength region of {{microwave}} fields there can exist the field structures with local coupling between the time-varying electric and magnetic fields differing from the electric-magnetic coupling in regular-propagating free-space electromagnetic waves. To distinguish such field structures from regular electromagnetic (EM) field structures, we term them as magnetoelectric (ME) fields. We study a structure and conservation laws of microwave ME <b>near</b> <b>fields.</b> We show that there exist sources of microwave ME <b>near</b> <b>fields</b> - the ME particles. These particles are represented by small quasi- 2 D ferrite disks with the magnetic-dipolar-oscillation spectra. The <b>near</b> <b>fields</b> originated from such particles are characterized by topologically distinctive power-flow vortices, non-zero helicity, and a torsion degree of freedom. Our studies of the microwave ME <b>near</b> <b>fields</b> are combined in two successive papers. In this paper we give a theoretical background of properties of the electric and magnetic fields {{inside and outside of}} a ferrite particle with magnetic-dipolar-oscillation spectra resulting in appearance of the microwave ME <b>near</b> <b>fields.</b> Based on the obtained structures of the ME <b>near</b> <b>fields,</b> we discuss effects of so-called ME interactions observed in artificial electromagnetic materials. In the next paper, we represent numerical and experimental studies of the microwave ME <b>near</b> <b>fields</b> and their interactions with matter. Comment: Submitted to Phys. Rev. ...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Changes in {{the spatial}} {{arrangement}} or identity of objects inside a familiar environment induce reexploration. The present study looks at modifi-cations of place cell activity during such renewed exploration. Hungry rats foraged for {{food in a}} cylinder with a salient cue card attached {{to the wall and}} with two distinct objects at fixed positions on the floor relative {{to each other and to}} the cue card. Once a set of CA 1 place cells was recorded in this standard configuration, additional sessions were done after two kinds of manipulation. In the first, the two objects were rotated as a rigid set 90 de-grees counterclockwise around the cylinder center while leaving the cue card in place; this was considered a spatial change. The effects of rotating the objects were different for <b>fields</b> <b>near</b> the objects (<b>near</b> <b>fields)</b> and fields far from the objects (far fields). Object rotation altered most <b>near</b> <b>fields</b> in complex ways, including remapping and cessation of firing. <b>Near</b> <b>fields</b> that remained intact after object rotation underwent unpredictable rotations that frequently departed considerably from the expected value of 90 degree...|$|R

The second is that blade motion creates a steady, but rotating, pressure field at each blade.

At UHF and higher frequencies, the tag is more than one radio wavelength away from the reader, requiring a different approach. The tag can backscatter a signal. Active tags may contain functionally separated transmitters and receivers, and the tag need not respond on a frequency related to the reader's interrogation signal.|$|E
