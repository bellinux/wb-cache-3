40|$|The {{charging}} of batteries of plug-in hybrid {{electric vehicles}} at home at standard outlets {{has an impact on}} the distribution grid which may require serious investments in grid expansion. The coordination of the charging gives an improvement of the grid exploitation in terms of reduced power losses and voltage deviations with respect to uncoordinated charging. The vehicles must be dispatchable to achieve the most efficient solution. As the exact forecasting of household loads is not possible, stochastic programming is introduced. Two main techniques are analyzed in this paper: quadratic and dynamic programming. Both techniques are compared in results and storage requirements. The charging can be coordinated directly or indirectly by the grid utility or an aggregator who will sell the aggregated demand of PHEVs at the utility. PHEVs can also discharge and so inject energy in the grid to restrict voltage drops. The amount of energy that is injected in the grid depends on the price tariffs, the charging and discharging efficiencies and the battery energy content. The impact of a voltage controller embedded in a PHEV charger is regarded in this paper. A day and <b>night</b> <b>tariff</b> are applied. The charging and discharging of vehicles can respond to real-time pricing or on a price-schedule as well. Voltage control {{is the first step in}} the utilization of distributed resources like PHEVs for ancillary services. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to provide insight into the {{variations}} in dairy farm electricity costs across five electricity tariffs. The effect of four milk cooling scenarios is also simulated to illustrate the effect of technologies on the electricity consumption, related costs and CO 2 emissions of a dairy farm. Helping dairy farmers to make informed business decisions when confronted with future options in the sphere of electricity tariffs and energy efficient cooling systems will contribute to optimum farm profitability and will help to improve the profitability and sustainability of the industry. A previously developed model capable of simulating electricity consumption, related costs and CO 2 emissions of dairy farms was used to simulate five electricity tariffs (Flat, Day&Night, Time of Use Tariff 1 (TOU 1), TOU 2 and Real Time Pricing (RTP)) on a dairy farm with 195 milking cows. The Flat tariff consisted on one electricity price for all time periods, the Day&Night tariff consisted of two electricity prices, a high rate from 09 : 00 to 00 : 00 h and a low rate thereafter. The TOU tariff structure was similar to that of the Day&Night tariff except that a third peak price band was introduced between 17 : 00 and 19 : 00 h. The RTP tariff varied dynamically according to the electricity demand on the national grid. The model used in these simulations is a mechanistic mathematical representation of the electricity consumption that simulates farm equipment under the following headings; milk cooling system, water heating system, milking machine system, lighting systems, water pump systems and the winter housing facilities. Direct expansion, ice bank and pre-cooling milk cooling systems were simulated to determine how dairy farm electricity consumption, related costs and CO 2 emissions vary according to the milk cooling system installed on the farm. Annual simulated electricity consumption of the farm was 32, 670 kWh when a direct expansion milk cooling system without pre-cooling of milk was included in the model. The annual electricity consumption of the farm on the day & <b>night</b> <b>tariff</b> was € 4, 571. Adding precooling with ground water to the direct expansion milk cooling system reduced annual electricity consumption by 28 % to 23, 660 kWh and reduced annual electricity costs by 38 % to € 2, 875. The addition of a pre-cooling system to the direct expansion milk cooling system saved 3, 973 kg of CO 2. Simulation of an ice bank milk cooling system without pre-cooling resulted in annual simulated electricity consumption of 34, 777 kWh. The annual electricity consumption on the day & <b>night</b> <b>tariff</b> was € 3, 793. Adding pre-cooling with ground water to the ice bank milk cooling system reduced annual electricity consumption by 30 % to 24, 181 kWh and reduced annual electricity costs by 33 % to € 2, 527.

This paper determines the electrical power required for charging a fleet of PHEVs in Belgium. A stochastic model based on the driving be- havior of Western European drivers, determines {{the availability of the}} PHEVs for grid charging. Three scenarios are defined to generate charging profiles based on the driving profiles. The first two scenarios, defined as uncoordinated charging, are based on a continuation of the current tariff schemes available to residential users, i. e. a single electricity tariff or a double electricity tariff including a day and <b>night</b> <b>tariff.</b> In the third scenario, coordinated charging is proposed. When coordinated charging is applied, the time of charging is shifted to a more appropriate moment of the night where total electrical load is minimal. The charging energy when coordinated charging is applied for each PHEV is defined to be equal to that of the single tariff scenario. The extra load caused by charging PHEVs is added to the residential and industrial electricity consumption of Belgium in 2008. Based on this data, a year load duration diagram can be determined to quantify demand for both power and energy in base load, variable load and peak load. Uncoordinated charging for residential users will cause difficulties for the electricity production system because peak load will rise substantially while base load stays the same. Coordinated charging is essential to minimize the impact on the electricity production system and could be implemented using smart meter technology. status: publishe...|$|E

This paper investigates energy reduction in houses by using an innovative solar thermal collector combined with a heat pump system. The dynamic lumped parameter model for a small house is derived and the combined heating system is used to provide the typical hot water and heating requirement. The goal is to maintain thermal comfort inside the house and reduce the amount of electricity consumption used for heating and hot water. This is achieved by reducing the electricity costs through optimising the operation of the heat pump, integrating the available solar energy, and by shifting electricity consumption to the cheaper <b>night</b> time <b>tariff.</b> Models of conventional controller on–off and a multi-variable model predictive control (MPC) are developed and used for several different climatic conditions. The results showed that the model predictive controller performed best by providing better comfort, consuming less electric energy and better use of cheap night time electricity by load shifting and storing heat energy in the heating tank...|$|R

The idea of grid friendly charging is to use electricity from the grid to charge batteries when electricity is available in surplus and cheap. There are several ways of achieving this, for example using droop control, using <b>night</b> time electricity <b>tariffs,</b> or using smart metering. The goal is twofold: to avoid putting additional load on the electricity grid and power generation, and {{to reduce the cost}} to the consumer. This paper looks at the saving potential when charging an electric car using real time tariffs provided by a smart meter, using the Ameren tariffs in Illinois as an example. If prices are known in advance (day-ahead pricing), the optimization only requires picking the cheapest time slots for charging the battery. Further savings can be made by using real time prices that are not known in advance, but the optimization problem then depends on price prediction models, and it becomes much more difficult to solve. This paper presents a simple suboptimal approach, and it quantifies the potential improvements that could be made using more sophisticated price predictions. The result is that cost savings in the order of about 50 USD (1 / 3 of the electricity costs) are feasible if a fast charger is used using real time pricing. The scale of the savings is such that complex optimization strategies are not worthwhile, and for the foreseeable future simple solutions are expected to be more cost effective...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to assess how, and to what extent, do {{managerial}} and technology changes affect electricity consumption, associated costs and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of dairy farms. Dairy farms in Ireland are expected to expand in the future, due to policy incentives and the abolishment of European Union milk quotas in 2015, which will result in an increased use of resources such as land, water, and energy, and increased emissions to the environment. In order to develop strategies to reduce electricity consumption associated costs and GHG emissions, {{it was necessary to}} understand the consumption trends and the hot-spots of electricity consumption within the farm. Therefore, we performed a life cycle assessment by quantifying the energy use on 22 commercial Irish dairy farms, from cradle-to-farm-gate. This analysis demonstrated that a total of 31. 7 MJ of energy was required to produce one kg of milk solids, of which 20 % was direct and 80 % was indirect energy use. Electricity consumption was found to represent 12 % of total cradle-to-farm-gate energy use or 60 % of direct energy, and was centered on milk harvesting. Following this analysis we devised two main groups of strategies, i. e. ‘cost strategies’ and ‘energy strategies’. ‘Cost strategies’ consisted of measures that could save on-farm costs but no energy or related emissions, such as, moving to a new electricity tariff or decoupling large electricity users, such as water heating, from milking times and shifting them to off-peak periods when electricity price is lower. Examples of ‘energy strategies’ are; the use of variable speed vacuum pumps on the milking machine, pre-cooling of milk and solar thermal technologies to provide hot water for cleaning purposes. A mechanistic model of electricity consumption that simulates farm equipment on an hourly and monthly basis was developed to further evaluate the ‘cost’ and ‘energy’ strategies. We used this model to show that a Day & <b>Night</b> electricity <b>tariff</b> minimised annual electricity costs, while a Flat tariff would increase the electricity costs by between 16 % and 34 %, depending on farm size. We also discovered that milking earlier in the morning and later in the evening reduced the simulated annual electricity consumption and related GHG emissions by between 5 % and 7 %, depending on farm size.   An analysis of ‘energy strategies’ was carried out which revealed that that the ideal blend of technologies to maximise farm profitability while also reducing electricity consumption and GHG emissions, consisted of a direct expansion milk tank with pre-cooling of milk with well water to 15 °C, electrical water heating and standard vacuum pumps. An individual farmer can also choose to increase his or her use of renewable energy by adding solar thermal water heating with the trade-off of reduced profitability and negative return on investment figures. This analysis highlighted the need for an investment appraisal approach to technology investments on dairy farms...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a preliminary economic {{study on the}} feasibility of using electric vehicles (EVs) to provide demand response, carried out {{as part of the}} GREEN Grid project. A mathematical model is developed to track the charge cycle of an EV battery, and this in turn provides estimates of the cost associated with battery life degradation under different scenarios. Three case studies are presented in this paper: the first investigates the potential cost saving for the EV owner by confining the charging of an EV battery to the <b>night</b> <b>tariff</b> period; the second investigates the financial gain associated with regulating the charging of an EV battery based on spot prices; and the third investigates the possible economic benefit for the EV owner of participating in the electricity market by buying energy at low prices and selling at high prices. The first case also includes the situation of just a battery being used to store energy during the night to run a household during the day. Results show that it is most economical to charge an EV during the night (Case 1), but that it varies considerably depending on the region in New Zealand. Regulating the charging rate depending on the spot price (Case 2) provides a small benefit. Using the EV to trade energy (Case 3) is, in most cases, uneconomic given the degradation of battery life. The variation of Case 1 also shows that at current battery costs, it is not economic to store energy during the night for use during the day. Given that there will be other costs associated with these activities, such as the charger equipment capable of both importing and exporting energy from the grid, the economics do not appear to favour use of EVs for demand response provision, except for the case of simply adjusting the time of charging to suit the tariff...|$|E
40|$|Our {{objective}} was to define and demonstrate a mechanistic model that enables dairy farmers to explore {{the impact of a}} technical or managerial innovation on electricity consumption, associated CO 2 emissions, and electricity costs. We, therefore, (1) defined a model for electricity consumption on dairy farms (MECD) capable of simulating total electricity consumption along with related CO 2 emissions and electricity costs on dairy farms on a monthly basis; (2) validated the MECD using empirical data of 1 yr on commercial spring calving, grass-based dairy farms with 45, 88, and 195 milking cows; and (3) demonstrated the functionality of the model by applying 2 electricity tariffs to the electricity consumption data and examining the effect on total dairy farm electricity costs. The MECD was developed using a mechanistic modeling approach and required the key inputs of milk production, cow number, and details relating to the milk-cooling system, milking machine system, water-heating system, lighting systems, water pump systems, and the winter housing facilities as well as details relating to the management of the farm (e. g., season of calving). Model validation showed an overall relative prediction error (RPE) of less than 10 % for total electricity consumption. More than 87 % of the mean square prediction error of total electricity consumption was accounted for by random variation. The RPE values of the milk-cooling systems, water-heating systems, and milking machine systems were less than 20 %. The RPE values for automatic scraper systems, lighting systems, and water pump systems varied from 18 to 113 %, indicating a poor prediction for these metrics. However, automatic scrapers, lighting, and water pumps made up only 14 % of total electricity consumption across all farms, reducing the overall impact of these poor predictions. Demonstration of the model showed that total farm electricity costs increased by between 29 and 38 % by moving from a day and <b>night</b> <b>tariff</b> to a flat tariff...|$|E
