25|$|NOR and NAND flash {{get their}} names from the {{structure}} of the interconnections between memory cells. In NORflash, cells are connected in parallel to the bit lines, allowing cells to be read and programmed individually. The parallel connection of cells resembles the parallel connection of transistors in a CMOS NOR gate. In NANDflash, cells are connected in series, resembling a <b>NAND</b> <b>gate.</b> The series connections consume less space than parallel ones, reducing the cost of NANDflash. It does not, by itself, prevent NAND cells from being read and programmed individually.|$|E
50|$|A NOT gate is made {{by joining}} the inputs of a <b>NAND</b> <b>gate</b> together. Since a <b>NAND</b> <b>gate</b> is {{equivalent}} to an AND gate followed by a NOT gate, joining the inputs of a <b>NAND</b> <b>gate</b> leaves only the NOT gate.|$|E

50|$|The logical {{effort of}} a two-input <b>NAND</b> <b>gate</b> is {{calculated}} to be g = 4/3 because a <b>NAND</b> <b>gate</b> with input capacitance 4 can drive the same current as the inverter can, with input capacitance 3.

40|$|Abstract. We {{describe}} how {{nuclear magnetic resonance}} (NMR) spectroscopy {{can serve as a}} substrate for the implementation of classical logic gates. The approach exploits the inherently continuous nature of the NMR parameter space. We show how simple continuous <b>NAND</b> <b>gates</b> with sin/sin and sin/sinc characteristics arise from the NMR parameter space. We use these simple continuous <b>NAND</b> <b>gates</b> as starting points to obtain optimised target NAND circuits with robust, error-tolerant properties. We use Cartesian Genetic Programming (CGP) as our optimisation tool. The various evolved circuits display patterns relating to the symmetry properties of the initial simple continuous gates. Other circuits, such as a robust XOR circuit built from simple <b>NAND</b> <b>gates,</b> are obtained using similar strategies. We briefly mention the possibility to include other target objective functions, for example other continuous functions. SimplecontinuousNANDgateswithsin/sincharacteristicsare a good starting point for the creation of error-tolerant circuits wherea...|$|R

The electron radiation within two planetary radii of Jupiter {{is estimated to be}} of the order of 5 X 10 ⁷ electrons per square centimeter per second. The "Grand Tour" outer planets space probe was to spend about ten hours in this environment thus receiving an exposure of about 2 X 10 ¹² eˉ/cm². Exposures of about 10 ¹⁵ eˉ/cm² for TTL <b>NAND</b> <b>Gates</b> and 10 ¹⁴eˉ/cm² for the MOSFETS were required before failure or serious degradation of performance occurred. Therefore, in the electron environment near Jupiter, satisfactory operation should be expected for about 500 hours for the MOSFETS and 5000 hours for the TTL <b>NAND</b> <b>Gates.</b> [URL] United States Nav...|$|R

The current level of the transistors may be increased by a factor 40 for supply voltages below 0. 3 V. Simple <b>NAND</b> <b>gates</b> are presented using different topologies.

5000|$|A decade counter is {{one that}} counts in decimal digits, rather than binary. A decade counter may have each (that is, it may count in binary-coded decimal, as the 7490 {{integrated}} circuit did) or other binary encodings. [...] "A decade counter is a binary counter {{that is designed to}} count to 1010b (decimal 10). An ordinary four-stage counter can be easily modified to a decade counter by adding a <b>NAND</b> <b>gate</b> as in the schematic to the right. Notice that FF2 and FF4 provide the inputs to the <b>NAND</b> <b>gate.</b> The <b>NAND</b> <b>gate</b> outputs are connected to the CLR input of each of the FFs." [...] A decade counter {{is one that}} counts in decimal digits, rather than binary. It counts from 0 to 9 and then resets to zero. The counter output can be set to zero by pulsing the reset line low. The count then increments on each clock pulse until it reaches 1001 (decimal 9). When it increments to 1010 (decimal 10) both inputs of the <b>NAND</b> <b>gate</b> go high. The result is that the NAND output goes low, and resets the counter to zero. D going low can be a CARRY OUT signal, indicating {{that there has been a}} count of ten.|$|E
