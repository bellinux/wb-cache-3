40|$|The {{occurrence}} of <b>nocturnal</b> secondary <b>ozone</b> maxima was investigated by ground-level meteorological and air quality measurements {{in an urban}} park in Essen, Germany, during 29 individual summer measurement campaigns between May 1995 and September 1997. In addition, during an intensive measurement campaign in May 1997, SODAR measurements of wind and turbulence were made. The spatial and temporal distribution of <b>nocturnal</b> <b>ozone</b> maxima within the measurement network of the Environmental Protection Office of North Rhine-Westphalia was also analysed. Two case studies of <b>nocturnal</b> secondary <b>ozone</b> maxima are discussed in more detail. They represent {{two different types of}} this phenomenon, associated with a nocturnal low-level jet (LLJ) and the passage of a front, respectively. In both cases, the <b>nocturnal</b> increase in <b>ozone</b> concentration was accompanied by {{a significant increase in the}} standard deviation of the vertical wind speed sigma sub w across the lower stable boundary layer, indicating enhanced vertical mixing. During the LLJ case, ozone maxima were observed at 33 % of the stations of the Environmental Protection Office network at approximately the same time. In the case of the front, the time of the ozone concentration rise could be allocated to the time of the passage of the front, moving from northwest to southeast across the study area. For the first time, the measurements presented here document turbulent mixing induced by shear forces in the whole layer between the core of the LLJ and the ground surface during secondary <b>nocturnal</b> <b>ozone</b> maxima...|$|R

40|$|Concurrent {{measurements}} were taken using the Brewer spectrometer no. 30, the filter ozonometer M 124 no. 200 and the Dobson spectrophotometer no. 71 from September 1987 to December 1988 at Potsdam. The {{performance of the}} instrument types and the compatibility of ozone data was checked under the conditions of a field measuring station. Total <b>ozone</b> <b>values</b> derived from Dobson AD direct sun {{measurements were}} considered as standard. The Dobson instrument had been calibrated at intercomparisons with the World Standard Dobson instrument no. 83 (Boulder) and with the Regional Standard instrument no. 64 (Potsdam), while the Brewer instrument was calibrated several times with the Travelling Standard Brewer no. 17 (Canada). The differences between individual Brewer DS (direct sun) ozone data and Dobson ADDS are within plus or minus 3 percent with half of all differences within plus or minus 1 percent. Less than 0. 7 percent of the systematic difference can be due to atmospheric SO 2.

40|$|A {{study has}} been made of the {{recently}} re-evaluated time series of daily total <b>ozone</b> <b>values</b> for the period 1979 to 1992 for southern England. The series consists of measurements made at two stations, Bracknell and Camborne. The series shows a steady decline in <b>ozone</b> <b>values</b> in the spring months over the period, and this is consistent with data from an earlier decade that has been published but not re-evaluated. Of exceptional note is the monthly mean for January 1992 which was very significantly reduced from the normal value, and was the lowest so far measured for this month. This winter was also noteworthy for a prolonged period during which a blocking anticyclone dominated the region, and the possibility existed that this was related to the ozone anomaly. It was possible to determine whether the origin of the low <b>ozone</b> <b>value</b> lay in ascending stratospheric motions. A linear regression analysis of <b>ozone</b> <b>value</b> deviation against 100 hPa temperature deviations was used to reduce <b>ozone</b> <b>values</b> to those expected in the absence of high pressure. The assumption was made that the normal regression relation was not affected by atmospheric anomalies during the winter. This showed that vertical motions in the stratosphere only accounted for part of the ozone anomaly and that the main cause of the ozone deficit lay either in a reduced stratospheric circulation to which the anticyclone may be related or in chemical effects in the reduced stratospheric temperatures above the high pressure area. A study of the ozone time series adjusted to remove variations correlated with meteorological quantities, showed that during the period since 1979, one other winter, that of 1982 / 3, showed a similar although less well defined deficit in total <b>ozone</b> <b>values...</b>|$|R

In addition, the effects of several variables, such as cloudiness, solar zenith angle (SZA), effective temperature and total <b>ozone</b> <b>values</b> in Brewer-GOME differences are analyzed. The results indicate that clouds induce a minor dependence of GOME values on the SZA.

40|$|Ozone {{trends for}} 1979 - 1991, {{determined}} from Dobson spectrophotometer observations made at eight {{stations in the}} United States, are augmented with trend data from four foreign cooperative stations operated by NOAA/CMDL. Results are based on provisional data archived routinely throughout the years at the World Ozone Data Center in Toronto, Canada, with calibration corrections applied {{to some of the}} data. Trends through 1990 exhibit values of minus 0. 3 percent to minus 0. 5 percent yr(exp - 1) at mid-to-high latitudes in the northern hemisphere. With the addition of 1991 data, however, the trends become less negative, indicating that ozone increased {{in many parts of the}} world during 1991. Stations located within the plus or minus 20 deg N-S latitude band exhibit no ozone trends. Early 1992 data show decreased <b>ozone</b> <b>values</b> at some of the stations. At South Pole, Antarctica, October <b>ozone</b> <b>values</b> have remained low during the past 3 years...|$|R
40|$|The {{source of}} the {{background}} current in the usual operation of the electrochemical concentration cell ozonesonde is the reduction of tri-iodide normally present in the cathode solution. The time variations in the background current {{can be explained by}} the slow rates of solution mass transport and of heterogeneous electron transfer for tri-iodide. Oxygen does not contribute to the background current through reaction with iodide to produce tri-iodide. Direct reduction of oxygen at the cathode is negligible once the electrodes have been exposed to iodide for 24 hours. The present background current correction is altitude-dependent, since it is based on an assumed sensitivity of the electrochemical concentration cell to oxygen. If the background current is independent of altitude and of oxygen, a constant, uncorrected, background current of 0. 1 microamp would produce an error of + 5. 5 % for the total <b>ozone</b> <b>value</b> of the electrochemical concentration cell for a typical midlatitude total <b>ozone</b> <b>value</b> of 0. 345 atm-cm...|$|R
40|$|Results are {{presented}} on ozone measurements {{in the upper}} troposphere/lower stratosphere over Antarctica, obtained by NASA DC- 8 aircraft during the August/September 1987 Airborne Antarctic Ozone Experiment. The ozone mixing ratios as high as several hundred ppbv were measured, but in all cases these ratios were observed in pockets of upper atmospheric air, both {{in the vicinity of}} and away from the location of the ozone hole. The background <b>ozone</b> <b>values</b> in the surrounding troposphere were typically in the range of 20 - 50 ppbv. Correlation of tropospheric ozone observations with the boundaries of the ozone hole differed {{in the course of the}} experiment. During the August 28 - September 2 flights, encounters with ozone-rich air were limited, and the background tropospheric ozone appeared to decrease beneath the hole. For the later flights, and as the ozone hole deepened, the ozone-rich air was frequently observed in the vicinity of the hole, and the average <b>ozone</b> <b>values</b> at the flight altitude were frequently higher than the background values...|$|R
