In 1897 an outbreak of bubonic plague killed <b>nearly</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> population of the city.

The invasion of Iraq was completed about 48 hours later. The Battle of Khafji served as a modern example of the ability of air power to serve a supporting role to ground forces. It offered the Coalition an indication of the manner in which Operation Desert Storm would be fought, but also hinted at future friendly-fire casualties which accounted for <b>nearly</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> American dead.|$|E

The Red Cross reported that about 2,300 people evacuated Cape Cod, Massachusetts, and thousands of tourists left the area. About 70flights to and from Boston's Logan International Airport were canceled. Flood warnings were raised across western portions of the state.|$|E
5|$|Hyperuricemia is {{a classic}} feature of gout, but <b>nearly</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> time gout occurs without hyperuricemia and most people with raised uric acid levels never develop gout. Thus, the {{diagnostic}} utility of measuring uric acid levels is limited. Hyperuricemia {{is defined as a}} plasma urate level greater than 420 μmol/l (7.0mg/dl) in males and 360 μmol/l (6.0mg/dl) in females. Other blood tests commonly performed are white blood cell count, electrolytes, kidney function and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). However, both the white blood cells and ESR may be elevated due to gout in the absence of infection. A white blood cell count as high as 40.0×109/l (40,000/mm3) has been documented.|$|E

5|$|The 1973 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season {{was the first}} season to use the Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale, a scale developed in 1971 by Herbert Saffir and Robert Simpson to rate the intensity of tropical cyclones. The season produced 24 tropical and subtropical cyclones, of which only 8 reached storm intensity, 4 became hurricanes, and only 1 reached major hurricane status. Although more active than the 1972 season, 1973 brought few storms of note. <b>Nearly</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> season's storms affected land, one of which resulted in severe damage.|$|E
5|$|The Chinese Indonesian {{population}} of Sumatra accounts for <b>nearly</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> group's national population. Although {{they are generally}} more urbanized than Indonesia's indigenous population, significant rural and agricultural communities exist throughout the country. Declining fertility rates have resulted in an upward shift in the population pyramid, as the median age increases. Emigration has contributed to a shrinking population, and communities have emerged in more industrialized nations {{in the second half}} of the 20th century. Some have participated in repatriation programs to the People's Republic of China, while others emigrated to Western countries to escape anti-Chinese sentiment. Among the overseas residents, their identities are noticeably more Indonesian than Chinese.|$|E
5|$|The main German {{striking}} force was the XLVII Panzer Corps, with {{one and a}} half SS Panzer Divisions and two Heer Panzer Divisions. Although they made initial gains against the defending U.S. VII Corps, they were soon halted and Allied aircraft inflicted severe losses on the attacking troops, eventually destroying <b>nearly</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> German tanks involved in the attack. Although fighting continued around Mortain for six days, the American forces had regained the initiative within a day of the opening of the German attack.|$|E

In 2013, he had his worst season, posting a 4–14 win–loss record and 5.19 earned run average, a performance that led to him being removed from the rotation. The following year, Hughes had a turnaround season with the Twins, where he went 16-10 with an ERA of 3.52 that resulted in him placing 7th in American League Cy Young Award voting.|$|E
5|$|Command & Conquer {{is set in}} an {{alternate}} timeline, after a meteorite crashed near the river Tiber in Italy in 1995. The meteorite brings with it an extremely toxic alien substance called Tiberium, which becomes extremely valuable because {{of its ability to}} absorb and crystallize precious metals from the surrounding soil. An ancient, cultic secret society called the Brotherhood of Nod claims to have foreseen the potentials of this new substance, investing in the development of technology to harvest and refine Tiberium crystals ahead of the scientific community. Nod soon controls <b>nearly</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> supply and uses these assets to sustain a rapidly growing army of followers worldwide. The group is led by a self-proclaimed messianic figure known only as Kane.|$|E
5|$|Complicating {{matters for}} the studios, {{the advent of}} sound film in 1927 {{required}} an immense expenditure in sound stages, recording booths, cameras, and movie-theater sound systems, {{not to mention the}} new-found artistic complications of producing in a radically altered medium. The studios were in a difficult financial position even before the market crash as the sound conversion process and some risky purchases of theater chains had pushed their finances near the breaking point. These economic circumstances led to a loss of <b>nearly</b> <b>half</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> weekly attendance numbers and closure of almost a third of the country's theaters in {{the first few years of}} the depression.
