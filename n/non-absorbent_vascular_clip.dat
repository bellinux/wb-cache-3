40|$|SUMMARY A {{synopsis}} {{of the types}} of <b>vascular</b> <b>clips</b> (malleable clips, screw clips, and spring clips) used by neurosurgeons during this century is presented. A review of the pertinent literature is in-cluded. THE INCREASING IMPORTANCE of small <b>vascular</b> <b>clips</b> in the surgical treatment of stroke is apparent from the large numbers of such clips used by neurosurgeons in this century. 1 " There are more than 40 types used for vascular occlusion, obliteration of aneurysms and arteriovenous mal-formations, and temporary occlusion of vessels during sur-gery of vascular anomalies or microvascular anastomoses. More recently there has been a particular interest in types of microvascular clips which are too weak to effectively clip an aneurysm but satisfactory for nontraumatic, temporary occlusion of 1 -mm vessels...|$|R

40|$|ObjectivesWe {{created a}} new <b>vascular</b> <b>clip</b> {{designed}} for aortic surgery. The purposes of this investigation were to examine surgical applicability in a clinically relevant aortic replacement model and to assess biomechanical strength of the clipped anastomosis and serial histologic changes in the clipped anastomotic site. MethodsTwenty-one beagles underwent descending thoracic aortic replacement. Distal anastomosis was performed with the new clips, mimicking the cuffed anastomosis technique, and proximal anastomosis {{was carried out by}} conventional suture anastomosis. Tissue specimens of the anastomotic sites were harvested at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively for examination. ResultsThere {{was no significant difference in}} the time required to carry out clip anastomosis (12. 2 ± 1. 3 minutes) and suture anastomosis (13. 7 ± 0. 9 minutes; P =. 38). Neither type of anastomotic site was disrupted by raising the intraluminal pressure to 280 mm Hg. Microscopically, the areas of aortic wall compressed by <b>vascular</b> <b>clips</b> appeared as hyalinized areas adjacent to surrounding collagen fibers, with no significant infiltration of inflammatory cells. Identical histologic changes were observed at the site of the sutured anastomosis. The media at the clipped anastomosis site was significantly thinner than that at the sutured anastomosis site at 1 month after the operation. However, there was no significant difference in the thickness of the media at 3 months. ConclusionsThe new <b>vascular</b> <b>clips</b> were effective in this clinically relevant model, with appropriate biomechanical strength, and the anastomotic sites underwent similar histologic changes to those observed after suture anastomosis...|$|R

In order to minimize blood loss, temporary bilateral occlusion of the uterine arteries was performed using <b>vascular</b> <b>clips,</b> prior to cornual resection. The uterine cornua were infiltrated with dilute vasopressin to further minimize blood loss.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To assess {{risk factors}} and {{predictors}} of failure of the Hem-o-lok(TM) <b>vascular</b> <b>clip</b> (Weck Closure Systems, Research Triangle Park, NC, USA) using vessels harvested from a porcine model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Vessels of various diameters were harvested from a porcine model, clipped at 90 degrees or 45 degrees using the Hem-o-lok clip and then cut either flush or with a 1 -mm cuff. The vessels were then connected to a burst-pressure device and pressures required to burst the clip or to cause it to leak were measured. RESULTS: The Hem-o-lok clip leaked or burst when the vessel to which it was applied was cut flush. The clip became even more likely to fail if the angle of application of the clip was not at 90 degrees to the vessel surface. CONCLUSION: The Hem-o-lok <b>vascular</b> <b>clip</b> is safe if it is applied at 90 degrees to the vessel surface and, more importantly, if a 1 -mm cuff is left between the clip and {{the point at which}} the vessel is divided. We would therefore discourage the practice of not leaving this cuff of tissue, in an attempt to maximize vessel length during laparoscopic donor nephrectomy...|$|R

Ilio-caval thrombosis and lower limb chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) are well known long-term complications of IVC interruption, where subsequent treatments may carry significant morbidity and mortality. PRESENTATION OF CASEWe present here a case of chronic venous insufficiency resulting from IVC interruption with a <b>vascular</b> <b>clip</b> placed forty years previously. A novel approach utilising endovascular stents was used to reconstruct the iliocaval confluence and interrupted distal IVC {{without the need for}} laparotomy to remove the plicating clip. This procedure was associated with minimal morbidity and resulted with a quick resolution of the patient's CVI symptoms. DISCUSSIONEndovascular angioplasty and stenting is an alternative to open reconstruction of the interrupted inferior vena cava. We have demonstrated successful opening of a plication <b>vascular</b> <b>clip</b> using only endovascular utilities. Advantages include a shorter hospital stay, and reduced morbidity and mortality when compared to a re-do laparotomy.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundTo {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} <b>vascular</b> <b>clips</b> and endovascular coils placed for intracranial aneurysms and arteriovenous malformations on whole-brain computed tomography (CT) angiography and perfusion. MethodsA 320 -detector row dynamic volume CT system imaged 11 patients following surgical placement of <b>vascular</b> <b>clips</b> or endovascular coils. The extent of clip and coil subtraction by automated software was evaluated using CT digital subtraction angiography and CT perfusion. Impact on CT perfusion values by retained intracranial devices was compared to age- and gender-matched controls. ResultsClip and coil subtraction on CT angiography was graded as good in 8 and moderate in 3 cases. A residual neck and additional aneurysm were noted in 1 of 11 patients. Post-procedural axial slice level CT perfusion values decreased in reliability with increasing proximity to the metallic devices secondary to beam hardening. However, the intracranial devices did not affect axial slice level CTP values of cerebral blood volume, cerebral blood flow and mean transit time outside {{of the level of}} the device. Time to peak values was globally decreased outside of the immediate vascular intervention region. ConclusionsAdvances in CT technology have provided clinically useful subtraction of intracranial clips and coils. While CT perfusion values were altered in device subtraction areas and within beam hardening artifact areas; they can provide valuable postoperative information on whole-brain hemodynamics. In selected cases, the combination of CT angiography and whole-brain CT perfusion can offer an alternative to conventional angiography that is a more invasive option...|$|R

The spinal cord trauma was induced by the application of <b>vascular</b> <b>clips</b> to the dura via a four-level T 5 -T 8 laminectomy. Results Spinal cord injury in mice resulted in severe trauma characterized by edema, neutrophil infiltration and apoptosis. In this study we clearly demonstrated that administration of MK 801 attenuated all inflammatory parameters. In fact 24 hours after injury, the degree of spinal cord inflammation and tissue injury (evaluated as histological score), infiltration of neutrophils, NF-κB activation, iNOS, cytokines levels (TNF-α and IL- 1 β), neurotrophin expression were markedly reduced by MK 801 treatment. Moreover, in a separate set of experiments, we have demonstrated that MK 801 treatment significantly improved the recovery of locomotory function.

Nuclear factor erythroid 2 -related factor 2 (Nrf 2) is a key transcription factor that plays a crucial role in cytoprotection against inflammation. The present study investigated the role of Nrf 2 in upregulating of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) activity, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and MMP- 9 after SCI. Wild-type Nrf 2 (+/+) and Nrf 2 -deficient (Nrf (−/−)) mice were subjected to an SCI model induced by the application of <b>vascular</b> <b>clips</b> (force of 10 [*]g) to the dura after a three-level T 8 -T 10 laminectomy.

The aim {{of the present study was}} to evaluate the effect of the PEA on secondary damage induced by experimental spinal cord injury (SCI) in mice. SCI was induced by application of <b>vascular</b> <b>clips</b> to the dura mater via a four-level T 5 -T 8 laminectomy.

Neuronal regeneration is restricted after spinal cord injury, but can be stimulated by experimental intervention. Previously we demonstrated that treatment co-ultramicronized palmitoylethanolamide and luteolin, namely co-ultraPEALut, reduced inflammation. The present {{study was designed to}} explore the neuroregenerative properties of co-ultra PEALut in an estabished murine model of SCI. A <b>vascular</b> <b>clip</b> was applied to the spinal cord dura at T 5 to T 8 to provoke injury. Mice were treated with co-ultraPEALut (1 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) daily for 72 h after SCI. Co-ultraPEALut increased the numbers of both bromodeoxyuridine-positive nuclei and doublecortin-immunoreactive cells in the spinal cord of injured mice. To correlate neuronal development with synaptic plasticity a Golgi method was employed to analyze dendritic spine density. Co-ultraPEALut administration stimulated expression of the neurotrophic factors brain-derived neurotrophic factor, glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor, nerve growth factor and neurotrophin- 3.

40|$|Abstract. Inflammation {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the pathogenesis of secondary damage after spinal cord injury (SCI). The present study explored the effect of sulforaphane (SFN), a potent anti-inflammatory extract of cruciferous vegetables, on the expression of two inflammatory mediators, metalloproteinase (MMP) - 9 and TNF-α, in a murine model of SCI. Murine spinal cord injury was induced by the application of <b>vascular</b> <b>clips</b> (force of 10 g) to the dura after a three-level T 8 -T 10 laminectomy. The wet/dry weight ratio was used to reflect the percentage of water content of impaired spinal cord tissue at 48 hr after SCI. The mRNA levels of MMP- 9 were determined using the reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and protein levels of TNF-α and MMP- 9 were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) at 24 hr after SCI. Gelatin zymography was used to determine MMP- 9 activity of spinal cord tissue at 24 hr after SCI. Mice treated with SFN at 1 hr after SCI had lower expression and activity of MMP- 9 compared to mice with SCI. The decrease of MMP- 9 in mice treated with SFN was associated with decreased levels of spinal cord water content and TNF-α. In summary, suforaphane decreases MMP- 9 and TNF-α expression and vascular permeability changes following spinal cord injury in mice...|$|R

The system uses nonpenetrating clips to approximate everted vessel walls. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the effects of nonpenetrating <b>vascular</b> <b>clips</b> on endothelial wound healing. Aortic end-to-end anastomoses were performed in male Wistar rats. A comparison was made between clipped (n = 12) and conventional hand-sewn (n = 6) anastomoses. Patency rates were verified at different time intervals (after 1, 4, and 8 weeks), after which the anastomotic sites were removed. Morphological evaluation was carried out using scanning electron microscopy, All rats survived the procedure. Closure with clips took less time than closure with conventional sutures, with decreasing aortic clamping times for the clipped procedures during the course of the experiments. Patency rates were 100 % in both the "clipped" and "sutured" groups. Microscopic examination showed favorable endothelial healing at the clipped anastomotic sites, with less inflammatory reaction at 1 week, and a more complete endothelial regeneration at 4 and 8 weeks follow-up, as compared with the sutured anastomoses. The clip applier holds the promise of a useful device in anastomosing small-caliber vessels, since clip closure takes less time than suturing, while patency rates are identical, and morphological results are favorable. Training is mandatory to obtain technical skills and to achieve optimal results. (C) 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc...|$|R

The laparoscopic stapling device is commonly used for division of the renal vessels. Malfunction of the stapling device can occur, and is often due to interference from previously placed clips. We report our experience with a clipless technique in which no <b>vascular</b> <b>clips</b> are placed on tributaries of the renal vein {{at or near the}} renal hilum in order to avoid laparoscopic stapling device misfires. Methods From December 20, 2002 to April 12, 2005, 50 patients underwent hand-assisted laparoscopic left donor nephrectomy (LDN) at our institution. Clipless management of the renal vein tributaries was used in all patients, and these vessels were divided using either a laparoscopic stapling device or the LigaSureTM device (Valleylab, Boulder, CO). The medical and operative records of the donors and recipients were reviewed to evaluate patient outcomes. Results The mean follow-up time was 14 months. Of the 50 LDN procedures, there were no laparoscopic stapling device malfunctions and no vascular complications. All renal allografts were functioning at the time of follow-up. Conclusion Laparoscopic stapling device failure due to deployment across previously placed surgical clips during laparoscopic live donor nephrectomy can be prevented by not placing clips on the tributaries of the renal vein. In our series, there were no vascular complications and no device misfires. We believe this clipless technique improves the safety of laparoscopic donor nephrectomy. </p...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{compare the}} {{physical}} characteristics of detrusor overactivity (DO) induced by intravesical infusion of saline in awake, sham rats and rats with chronic {{spinal cord injury}} (SCI), by simultaneous registrations of intravesical and intraabdominal pressures. Methods: Male Sprague-Dawley rats, normal or with a spinal <b>vascular</b> <b>clip</b> {{at the level of}} Th 9, were investigated cystometrically 1 and 4 weeks after SCI. Intravesical pressure (IVP) and intraabdominal pressure (IAP) were recorded simultaneously to evaluate true DO. During the filling phase, the event of IVP rises, defined as increments that exceeded 2 cmH 2 O from baseline, were determined as DO according to the absence of simultaneous changes in IAP. Results: All SCI rats exhibited DO during the filling phase, which was not shown in sham rats. The frequency and pressure of DO had a tendency to decrease with time. The DO frequency of SCI rats after 4 weeks (0. 9 ± 0. 2 min- 1) was decreased compared with that after 1 week (2. 1 ± 0. 4 min- 1; P 0. 05). Conclusions: Cystometric studies in awake male SCI rats showed some significant changes in bladder function after SCI. All SCI rats exhibited DO during the filling phase, and showed different physical characteristics of DO over the course of time. The neurological basis of these time-related changes remains poorly understood, but may provide important prognostic information about long-term urological management in SCI patients...|$|R
40|$|Background: Primary {{traumatic}} {{mechanical injury}} to the spinal cord (SCI) causes {{the death of a}} number of neurons that to date can neither be recovered nor regenerated. During the last years our group has been involved in the design, synthesis and evaluation of PDE 7 inhibitors as new innovative drugs for several neurological disorders. Our working hypothesis is based on two different facts. Firstly, neuroinflammation is modulated by cAMP levels, thus the key role for phosphodiesterases (PDEs), which hydrolyze cAMP, is undoubtedly demonstrated. On the other hand, PDE 7 is expressed simultaneously on leukocytes and on the brain, highlighting the potential crucial role of PDE 7 as drug target for neuroinflammation. Methodology/Principal Findings: Here we present two chemically diverse families of PDE 7 inhibitors, designed using computational techniques such as virtual screening and neuronal networks.

DSA within a 3 days interval. Qualitative and quantitative comparison of the arterial and venous supply, the parenchyma and urinary collecting system was made. Both ce-MRA and i. a. DSA showed good results in the detection of arterial stenoses. However, ce-MRA falsely suggested stenoses if <b>vascular</b> <b>clips</b> were used; on the other hand, i. a. DSA was less informative if the graft arteries were very tortuous. Ce-MRA was superior in depicting the venous anatomy (p < 0. 001) and the parenchymal enhancement of the pancreatic grafts. For the assessment of the contrast excretion, the pyelocalyceal system and the ureter of the renal graft ce-MRA-MRI was superior (p < 0. 001), for small caliber arteries in the renal grafts i. a.

Clival dura was exposed from the sella to the foramen magnum between the paraclival segments of the internal carotid arteries (ICA) laterally. An inverted dural "U" flap was reflected inferiorly to expose the basilar artery. The maximal dimensions from operative measurements were recorded. Surgical manoeuvrability of multiple instruments and the proficiency to place proximal and distal <b>vascular</b> <b>clips</b> were evaluated. The mean operative depth (± standard deviation), measured from the anterior choanae to the basilar artery, was 110 ± 6 mm. The lateral corridors were limited distally by the medial pterygoids (mean width 21 ± 2 mm) and paraclival ICA (mean width 20 ± 2 mm). The mean transclival craniectomy dimensions were 19 ± 2 mm (width) and 23 ± 4 mm (height). Exposure of the basilar-anterior inferior cerebellar artery junction, superior cerebellar artery, and the basilar caput were possible in 100 %, 91 %, and 64 % of instances, respectively. Placements of proximal and distal aneurysm clips were achieved in all instances. Based on our findings, the transclival endoscopic endonasal surgery approach provides excellent visualisation of the basilar artery. Clip application and manoeuvrability of instruments was considered adequate for basilar aneurysm surgery.

Pathology in sciatic, tibial and peroneal nerves at the lower thigh level was examined at 7 d after reperfusion. All reperfused nerves developed demyelinated nerve fibres, particularly in perivascular regions. Although 3 h of ischaemia followed by reperfusion caused demyelination, perivascular demyelination was more prominent after a longer period of ischaemia with reperfusion. Two types of nerve oedema were observed; endoneurial oedema especially in perivascular and subperineurial spaces, and intramyelinic oedema. Nerve fibres with intramyelinic oedema were not confined to the perivascular region. Swollen endothelial cells in endoneurial vessels were also invariably observed. Nerve ischaemia per se, without reperfusion, did not induce these pathological changes. Because myelin appears to be particularly susceptible to activated free radicals, oxidative stress, activated neutrophils, and cytokine formation seem to be important underlying mechanisms in the development of perivascular demyelination and intramyelinic oedema in ischaemic/reperfused nerves.

40|$|Background and purpose: 5 -lipoxygenase (5 -LO) is the {{key enzyme}} in {{leukotriene}} (LT) biosynthesis from arachidonic acid (AA). Here, we examined {{the role of the}} 5 -LO-product, cysteinyl-LT (Cys-LT), with a 5 -LO inhibitor (zileuton) and a Cys-LT, receptor antagonist (montelukast), in the inflammatory response and tissue injury associated with spinal cord injury (SCI). Experimental approach: SCI was induced in mice by the application of <b>vascular</b> <b>clips</b> to the dura via a two-level T 6 to T 7 laminectomy for 1 min. Cord inflammation was assessed histologically and by measuring inflammatory mediators (ELISA) and apoptosis by annexin V, TUNEL, Fas ligand staining and Bax and Bcl- 2 expression (immunohistochemistry and western blots). Motor function in hindlimbs was assessed by a locomotor rating scale, for 10 days after cord injury. Key results: SCI in mice resulted in tissue damage, oedema, neutrophil infiltration, apoptosis, tumour necrosis-α (TNF-α) and cyclooxygenase- 2 (COX- 2) expression, prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) and leukotriene B 4 (LTB 4) production, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 / 2 (ERK 1 / 2) phosphorylation in injured tissue. Treatment of the mice with zileuton or montelukast reduced the spinal cord inflammation and tissue injury, neutrophil infiltration, TNF-α, COX- 2 and pERK 1 / 2 expression, PGE 2 and LTB 4 production, and apoptosis. In separate experiments, zileuton or montelukast significantly improved the recovery of limb function over 10 days. Conclusions and implications: Zileuton and montelukast produced a substantial reduction of inflammatory events associated with experimental SCI. Our data underline the important role of 5 -LO and Cys-LT in neurotrauma...|$|R
40|$|Case Description-A 9 -year-old {{spayed female}} green iguana (Iguana iguana) was {{evaluated}} {{because of a}} distended coelom and weight loss. History included a single episode of egg binding and subsequent bilateral ovariosalpingectomy.;Clinical Findings-Physical examination revealed a mass within the coelomic cavity. Ultrasonography revealed a large, irregular mass with hypoechoic regions and coelomic effusion. Clinicopathologic derangements included heterophilia, monocytosis, lymphopenia, basophilia, hypocholesterolemia, hypoproteinemia, and hypercalcemia. Results of cytologic evaluation of the mass were suggestive of malignant epithelial neoplasia, but neoplastic cells were {{not found in the}} effusion. An ovarian tumor was suspected on the basis of clinical signs, clinicopathologic findings, and results of cytologic evaluation of the mass.;Treatment and Outcome-Surgical exploration revealed a large left ovary, a normal-appearing contralateral ovary, and a mass in the fat body, all of which were removed and submitted for histologic examination. The histologic diagnosis was granulosa cell tumor with metastasis to the fat body. The patient died 11 months after evaluation, and disseminated granulosa cell tumor was confirmed at necropsy; histologic examination at that time also identified systemic mastocytosis.;Clinical Relevance-Granulosa cell tumors are uncommon in reptiles, and this was the first granulosa cell tumor described antemortem cytologically, histologically, and ultrastructurally in an iguana. Findings in this iguana underscored concerns associated with incomplete oophorectomy of iguanas; cytologic and histopathologic findings were similar to those observed in other domestic animals. Oophorectomy should be considered as an alternative to standard ovariosalpingectomy to avoid potential complications in pet reptiles, and use of microsurgical instruments and <b>vascular</b> <b>clips</b> is advised.

40|$|Strategies {{aimed at}} {{improving}} spinal cord regeneration after trauma are still challenging neurologists and neuroscientists throughout the world. Many cell-based therapies have been tested, with limited success in terms of functional outcome. In this study, we investigated the effects of human dental pulp cells (HDPCs) in a mouse model of compressive spinal cord injury (SCI). These cells present some advantages, such as the ease of the extraction process, and expression of trophic factors and embryonic markers from both ecto-mesenchymal and mesenchymal components. Young adult female C 57 /BL 6 mice were subjected to laminectomy at T 9 and compression of the spinal cord with a <b>vascular</b> <b>clip</b> for 1 min. The cells were transplanted 7 days or 28 days after the lesion, in order to compare the recovery when treatment is applied in a subacute or chronic phase. We performed quantitative analyses of white-matter preservation, trophic-factor expression and quantification, and ultrastructural and functional analysis. Our results for the HDPC-transplanted animals showed better white-matter preservation than the DMEM groups, higher levels of trophic-factor expression in the tissue, better tissue organization, {{and the presence of}} many axons being myelinated by either Schwann cells or oligodendrocytes, in addition to the presence of some healthy-appearing intact neurons with synapse contacts on their cell bodies. We also demonstrated that HDPCs were able to express some glial markers such as GFAP and S- 100. The functional analysis also showed locomotor improvement in these animals. Based on these findings, we propose that HDPCs may be feasible candidates for therapeutic intervention after SCI and central nervous system disorders in humans...|$|R
30|$|Thirteen male Sprague-Dawley rats (body weight 327 to 376 g) were anesthetized with an {{intraperitoneal}} injection of pentobarbital sodium (5 mg/ 100 g body weight). Each animal {{was allowed to}} breathe spontaneously, without mechanical ventilation. The right carotid artery was cannulated with a catheter and the arterial pressure was measured with a blood pressure amplifier as stated above. The right femoral vein was cannulated with a catheter for infusion of lactated Ringer's (LR) solution or ANP. The bilateral renal pedicles were clamped with <b>vascular</b> <b>clips</b> for 30 min and released. The rats were randomized to three groups: 1) IRI + LR group (n = 5), 2) IRI + ANP group (n = 5), and 3) sham + LR group (n = 3). From 30 min after clamping, the IRI + LR and sham + LR groups were infused with LR for 3 h {{at a rate of}} 6 ml/kg/h. The ANP infusion in the IRI + ANP group was started at the same time point and administered at the same rate and for the same duration (0.2 μg/kg/min for 3 h) using LR mixed with ANP dissolved in 2 -ml portions of distilled water. The heart rate, mean arterial pressure, arterial blood gases, and plasma concentrations of lactate, creatinine, and potassium were measured at baseline and at 1, 2, and 3 h after declamping. The plasma concentrations of TNF-α, IL- 1 β, and IL- 6 were determined at baseline and at 3 h using the rat ELISA kit (Quantikinetm TM, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) following the manufacturer's instruction. The samples were tested in duplicate.|$|R
40|$|Background. Secondary lesion (SL) is {{an early}} {{phenomenon}} of cellular death following spinal cord injury (SCI). Nitric oxide (NO) could be involved in its pathogenesis. NO is a gaseous metabolite produced by 2 constitutive isoforms of NO synthase (cNOS), constantly active, and by 1 inducible isoform (iNOS), synthesized during inflammation and able to produce large amount of NO. High concentrated NO is toxic for cells; therefore, NO concentration is strictly and finely regulated. We suppose that major inhibitory effect on the iNOS expression {{is represented by the}} same physiological concentration of NO, synthesized by cNOS. The aim {{of this study is to}} assess the role of the 2 cNOS in pathogenesis of SL after SCI in rat. Methods. A dorsal SCI has been performed on rats (n= 5) by a <b>vascular</b> <b>clip</b> (50 g/mm 2 for 15 "). Fifteen minutes after trauma, activity of nNOS and eNOS has been measured (U/mg) in the cervical, dorsal and lumbar segments of spinal cord. Uninjured rats (n= 5) served as control group. m-RNA for iNOS in untreated rats (n= 2) has been also investigated by Northern blotting. Results. In injured rats nNOS activity has shown a reduction in dorsal and lumbar segments, compared to the control group. eNOS activity, highly variable in the control group, has not been detectable in injured spinal cord. i-NOS mRNA has not been found in spinal cord of uninjured rats. Conclusions. These results would be in line with our hypothesis and provide the bases for other investigations. New therapeutic strategies for SL prevention, based on the modulation of cNOS, will be evaluated...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{effects of}} {{moclobemide}} on damaged ovarian tissue induced by ischemia-reperfusion and damaged contralateral ovarian tissue were investigated in rats,biochemically and histologically. Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, 40 rats were equally divided intofour groups: 10 mg/kg moclobemide, 20 mg/kg moclobemide, ischemia/reperfusion control,and intact control groups. A 2 - 2. 5 -cm-long vertical incision {{was made in}} the lowerabdomen of each rat in order to reach the ovaries, after which a <b>vascular</b> <b>clip</b> was placedon the lower side of the right ovary of each animal in the two treatment groups and theischemia-reperfusion control group, but not in the healthy (intact control) animal group. The purpose of this procedure was to create ischemia over the course of three hours, thenthe clips were unclamped to provide reperfusion for the next two hours. At the end ofthe two hours of reperfusion, all the animals were killed by high-dose anaesthesia andtheir ovaries were taken and subjected to histological and biochemical (malondialdehyde,nitric oxide, glutathione) studies. Results: The obtained results showed that moclobemide suppressed nitric oxide andmalondialdehyde production in the ischemia - reperfusion damage area, and preventedthe decrease in endogenous antioxidant levels (glutathione) in the rat ovariantissue. Moclobemide also prevented infiltration of leukocytes to the ovarian tissue. These results showed that moclobemide protected ovarian tissue against ischemiareperfusioninjury. Conclusion: This study shows that moclobemide represses malondialdehyde and nitricoxide production in the rat ovarian tissue subjected to ischemia-reperfusion injury andkeeps the endogenous antioxidant glutathione level from decreasing. Moclobemide alsoinhibits leukocytic migration into ovarian tissue following ischemia-reperfusion injury. From these results, it is suggested that moclobemide can be used in the treatment of ovarianischemia-reperfusion injury...|$|R
40|$|Spinal {{cord injury}} (SCI) causes motor and sensory deficits that impair {{functional}} performance, and significantly impacts life expectancy and quality. Animal models {{provide a good}} opportunity to test therapeutic strategies in vivo. C 57 BL/ 6 mice were subjected to laminectomy at T 9 and compression with a <b>vascular</b> <b>clip</b> (30 g force, 1 min). Two groups were analyzed: injured group (SCI, n = 33) and laminectomy only (Sham, n = 15). Locomotor behavior (Basso mouse scale-BMS and global mobility) was assessed weekly. Morphological analyses were performed by LM and EM. The Sham group did not show any morphofunctional alteration. All SCI animals showed flaccid paralysis 24 h after injury. with subsequent improvement. The BMS score of the SCI group improved until the intermediate phase (2. 037 +/- 1. 198) : the Sham animals maintained the highest BMS score (8. 981 +/- 0. 056). p < 0. 001 during the entire time. The locomotor speed was slower in the SCI animals (5. 581 +/- 0. 871) than in the Sham animals (15. 80 +/- 1. 166), p < 0. 001. Morphological analysis of the SCI group showed, in the acute phase, edema, hemorrhage, multiple cavities, fiber degeneration, cell death and demyelination. In the chronic phase we observed glial scarring, neuron death, and remyelination of spared axons by oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells. In conclusion, we established a simple, reliable, and inexpensive clip compression model in mice, with functional and morphological reproducibility and good validity. The availability of producing reliable injuries with appropriate outcome measures represents great potential for studies involving cellular mechanisms of primary injury and repair after traumatic SCI.
