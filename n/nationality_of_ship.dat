40|$|According to the {{maritime}} norm, the <b>nationality</b> <b>of</b> <b>ship</b> is authorized with the registration of ship {{by the state}} concerned, and the ship registered is allowed to fly {{the flag of the}} state. The Japanese legislation for the registration of ship requires that the nationality of the ship shall be genuinely linked with the nationality of owner(s) of the ship, and does not allow a bareboat chartered-out vessel to the foreign state to temporarily terminate the registration of the ship in Japan. Under the regime of EEZ, many Japanese far seas fishing vessels(FSFVs) were decommissioned or forced to transfer of ownership to the coastal state if they wanted continuation of fishing operation in the EEZ of coastal states concerned, which led drastic reduction of Japanese FSFVs. The UN Convention of the Law of the Sea(1982) which stipulates the status of ships in Article 92 does not regulate the linkage between nationality and ownership of ship, and the United Nations Convention on Conditions for Registration of Ships(1986), while not in force, clearly recognizes the case of registration of the bareboat chartered-in ship. Some States(Canada, New Zealand, England, etc.) allow the bareboat chartered-in vessel to register it with their registration of ship. As the shortterm bareboat chartered-out would be one of breakthroughs for the plight of Japanese FSFVs loosing opportunity in the high seas, it is keenly requested that Japanese policy of ship registration allows temporary termination of the registration of Japanese ship for bareboat chartered-out...|$|E
40|$|This paper compares and {{contrasts}} {{the international}} legal regime which regulates the <b>nationality</b> <b>of</b> both a physical and a legal person. The authors discuss the juridical nature <b>of</b> <b>nationality,</b> <b>nationality</b> <b>of</b> a res and of humans, and reflect upon the recent sale by states <b>of</b> their <b>nationality</b> to non-citizens thereby shifting human nationality {{closer to the}} commodification <b>of</b> <b>nationality</b> <b>of</b> which <b>ships</b> are a traditional instance.

50|$|One of {{the best}} remembered watchmen was named Luis Castro. Nearly 200 years ago, Luis would sit atop a huge wooden cross on this hill. On the lookout for ocean vessels, it was his {{responsibility}} to determine the <b>nationality</b> <b>of</b> approaching <b>ships.</b> If he recognized the vessel he would raise a flag, but if a ship {{was thought to be}} carrying contraband then no flag was raised and the Spanish military would investigate. The Cruceta was built in honor of Mr. Castro and all the other watchmen who so faithfully helped protect the city during its younger years.|$|R
60|$|Kidd {{waited a}} good {{while for the}} Mocha fleet, {{but it did not}} arrive, and then he made his first venture in actual piracy. He {{overhauled}} a Moorish vessel which was commanded by an English captain, and as England was not at war with Morocco, and as the <b>nationality</b> <b>of</b> the <b>ship's</b> commander should have protected him, Kidd thus boldly broke the marine laws which governed the civilized world and stamped himself an out-and-out pirate. After the exercise of considerable cruelty he extorted from his first prize a small amount of money; and although he and his men did not gain very much booty, they had whetted their appetites for more, and Kidd cruised savagely over the eastern seas in search of other spoils.|$|R
40|$|Oil spills {{cause damage}} to the marine environment. Such oil spills {{originate}} from land-based or sea-based sources. Sea-based sources are discharges coming from ships or offshore platforms. The origin of the pollution can be accidental or deliberate (defined also as operational). The international legislation {{in the field of}} monitoring and response to marine oil pollution is mainly based on the International Convention for the Prevention <b>of</b> Pollution from <b>Ships,</b> 1973, as amended by the Protocol of 1978 thereto (MARPOL 73 / 78) and the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). To complete the international framework, and with specific reference for European Countries, also the recent European legislation is presented. Special attention is given to the prosecution of polluting vessels. The main legal problem is the coordination and integration of the two principles on jurisdiction which co-exist: the <b>nationality</b> <b>of</b> the <b>ship</b> and the geographical position <b>of</b> the <b>ship.</b> JRC.

5000|$|The {{idea of a}} flag to {{represent}} New Zealand first arose when the New Zealand-built trading ship Sir George Murray was seized in Sydney for sailing without a flag or register in 1830. British navigation laws applied in Australia and ruled that every ship must carry an official certificate that included the <b>nationality</b> <b>of</b> the <b>ship.</b> New Zealand was not yet a British colony, so could not sail under a British flag or register. With no flag {{to represent}} the islands, trading ships and their cargoes could be confiscated. While a temporary licence was granted for the Sir George Murray by New South Wales authorities, {{it was clear that}} a more permanent solution was needed. Busby was approached by Maori chiefs in 1833 about the matter of a flag. Busby asked Reverend Williams and the Colonial Secretary Richard Bourke in New South Wales for assistance, and, with additional consultation with tribal leaders, three designs were drawn up.|$|R

[...] The helicopters arrived near the ship at about 1303Z: [...] "I see a big vessel, near it are three small vessels..." [...] At 1308Z, Hatzor air control indicated concern about the <b>nationality</b> <b>of</b> the <b>ship's</b> crew: [...] "The first matter to clarify {{is to find out}} what their nationality is." [...] At 1310Z, one of the helicopter pilots asked the nearby torpedo boats' Division Commander about the meaning <b>of</b> the <b>ship's</b> hull number: [...] "GTR5 is written on it. Does this mean something?" [...] The response was: [...] "Negative, it doesn't mean anything." [...] At 1312Z, one of the helicopter pilots was asked by air control: [...] "Did you clearly identify an American flag?" [...] No answer appears in the transcript, but the air controller then says: [...] "We request that you make another pass and check once more if this is really an American flag." [...] Again, no response appears in the transcript. At about 1314Z, the helicopters were directed to return home.|$|R

Ships are the most important means of transporting goods on such routes: ninety-five per cent, by weight, of all international trade is seaborne. On the military side is it same important battle field. While almost all costal States and some landlocked (right now without Czech Republic) ones have a merchant navy of some description, one of the remarkable features <b>of</b> the international <b>shipping</b> industry is the degree to which ships are concentrated under the flags of relatively few States. This does not necessarily indicate a similar distribution of ownership. We are talking about "flags of convenience" and it is one of the topics of this thesis. This thesis deals transformation from customary international law to current codified regulation of {{the registration}} of vessels. The ascription <b>of</b> <b>nationality</b> to <b>ships</b> is one <b>of</b> the most important means by which public order is maintained at sea. As well as indicating what rights a ship enjoys and to what obligations it is subjects, the <b>nationality</b> <b>of</b> a [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The European Union (EU) is {{actively}} campaigning {{for the global}} regulation of carbon emissions generated by maritime bunker fuels because these emissions are presently barely regulated and are projected to increase significantly in the coming decades. However, since a global regulation has not been reached yet, the EU is seeking ways to include the shipping sector in its greenhouse gas reduction commitment for 2020. In this paper, {{we look at the}} effect <b>of</b> including the <b>shipping</b> sector’s emissions in the EU reduction commitment that is based on the <b>nationality</b> <b>of</b> a <b>ship.</b> Emissions that are generated by ships owned, operated or flagged by the 27 EU countries are allocated to the EU total GHG emissions. We first analyse the effects on the reduction commitment caused by the three allocations. We then use marginal abatement cost curves (MACCs) in order to determine how much the <b>shipping</b> sector <b>of</b> the 27 EU countries, defined by the three allocations, could contribute efficiently to a total given emission reduction target for all sectors in the EU. Moreover, we use MACCs in order to determine if some country fleets could reduce emissions in the shipping sector relatively more efficiently than other countries under a given emission reduction target for all sectors. Our findings indicate that the shipping sector could contribute efficiently to the EU’s emission reductions by up to 8. 5 %. Since the composition of the individual country fleets and applied measures are similar across countries, their individual reductions relative to their fleet-specific business-as-usual (BAU) emissions are on average the same...|$|R

50|$|Article 4d {{provides}} that neither marriage nor {{dissolution of marriage}} shall automatically affect the <b>nationality</b> <b>of</b> either spouse, nor shall a change <b>of</b> <b>nationality</b> by one spouse during marriage automatically affect the <b>nationality</b> <b>of</b> their spouse. Common practice among states {{at the beginning of}} the 20th century was that a woman was to have the <b>nationality</b> <b>of</b> her husband; i.e., upon marrying a foreigner the wife would automatically acquire the <b>nationality</b> <b>of</b> her husband, and lose her previous nationality. Even after the <b>nationality</b> <b>of</b> a married woman was no longer dependent on the <b>nationality</b> <b>of</b> her husband, legal provisions were still retained which automatically naturalised married women, and sometimes married men as well. This led to a number of problems, such as loss of the spouses' original nationality, the spouse losing the right to consular assistance (since consular assistance cannot be provided to nationals under the jurisdiction of a foreign state of which they are also nationals), and becoming subject to military service obligations. Article 4d addresses this situation.|$|R
