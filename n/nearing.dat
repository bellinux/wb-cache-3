5|$|Although The Landlord's Game was patented, {{and some}} hand-made boards were made, {{it was not}} {{actually}} manufactured and published until 1906. Magie and two other Georgists established the Economic Game Company of New York, which began publishing her game. Magie submitted an edition published by the Economic Game Company to Parker Brothers around 1910, which George Parker declined to publish. In the UK, {{it was published in}} 1913 by the Newbie Game Company under the title Brer Fox an' Brer Rabbit. Shortly after the game's formal publication, Scott <b>Nearing,</b> a professor in what was then known as the Wharton School of Finance and Commerce at the University of Pennsylvania, began using the game as a teaching tool in his classes. His students made their own boards, and taught the game to others. After <b>Nearing</b> was dismissed from the Wharton School, he began teaching at the University of Toledo. A former student of <b>Nearing,</b> Rexford Guy Tugwell, also taught The Landlord's Game at Wharton, and took it with him to Columbia University. Apart from commercial distribution, it spread by word of mouth and was played in slightly variant homemade versions over the years by Quakers, Georgists, university students (including students at Smith College, Princeton, and MIT), and others who became aware of it.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} the new concept of {{relative}} <b>near</b> PS-compactness in L-fuzzy topological spaces is introduced. The relative <b>near</b> PS-compactness is described with a-net, r-ps-cover, r-finite intersection property. The relationship between relative <b>near</b> PS-compactness and <b>near</b> PS-compactness is in vestigated. It is found that <b>near</b> PS-compactness implies relative <b>near</b> PS-compactness and every LF-set of <b>near</b> PS-compact space is relative <b>near</b> PS-compact. The relative <b>near</b> PS-compactness possess the following properties:the union of two arbirtrary relative <b>near</b> PS-compact sets is relative <b>near</b> PS-compact;the intersection {{of a family}} relative <b>near</b> PS-compact sets is also relative <b>near</b> PS-compact. Finally, it is proved that the relative <b>near</b> PS-compactness is invariant under the PS-continuous maps. This relative <b>near</b> PS-compactness is defined for arbitrary L-fuzzy subsets, and it preserves many good properties of compactness in general topological spaces...|$|R
