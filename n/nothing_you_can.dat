500|$|On January 27, 1991, at a music {{industry}} {{party at the}} Po Na Na Souk club in Hollywood, Dr. Dre assaulted television host Dee Barnes of the Fox television program Pump it Up, because he felt dissatisfied with her news report about the feud between the remaining N.W.A members and Ice Cube. Barnes filed a $22.7 million lawsuit {{in response to the}} incident. Subsequently, Dr. Dre was fined $2,500, given two years' probation, ordered to undergo 240 hours of community service, and given a spot on an anti-violence public service announcement on television. The civil suit was settled out of court. Barnes stated that Young [...] "began slamming her face and the right side of her body repeatedly against a wall near the stairway." [...] Dr. Dre later commented [...] "People talk all this shit, but you know, somebody fucks with me, I'm gonna fuck with them. I just did it, you know. Ain't <b>nothing</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> do now by talking about it. Besides, it ain't no big thing – I just threw her through a door." ...|$|E

2500|$|AMPAS {{executive}} director Bruce Davis noted that Fawcett had been recognized for her [...] "remarkable television work" [...] at the 61st Primetime Emmy Awards in September 2009. On the exclusion, he said: [...] "There's <b>nothing</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> say to people, particularly to family members, {{within a day}} or two of the show that helps at all. They tend to be surprised and hurt, and we understand that and we're sorry for it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Gardiner would {{continue}} his work inside the PC {{party for the}} rest of the 1940s, chairing the resolution and policy committee himself at the 1948 federal leadership convention. Gardiner turned down several chances to run provincially and federally. Gardiner chose instead to concentrate on his own career in business. [...] "There is <b>nothing</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> do in politics that makes the cash register ring." [...] Gardiner was even considered to run for the leadership of the Ontario Progressive Conservative Party (and therefore provincial premier) in 1948, but chose to support Leslie Frost instead. Gardiner would become one of Frost's closest political confidantes and advisers.|$|E
2500|$|US President Theodore Roosevelt was an honored guest. Mark Twain and Henry H. Rogers {{also paid}} a visit, in the latter's yacht [...] "Kanawha". Twain's humorous talk was partly an {{introduction}} of Rear Admiral Purnell F. Harrington, former Commandant of the Norfolk Navy Yard. Said Twain, [...] "In my remarks of welcome of Admiral Harrington, I {{am not going}} to give him compliments. Compliments always embarrass a man. You do not know what to say. It does not inspire you with words. There is <b>nothing</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> say in answer to a compliment. I have been complimented myself a great many times, and they always embarrass me. I always feel they have not said enough." ...|$|E
2500|$|Halladay {{was named}} the starter for Games One and Five during the National League Division Series against the St. Louis Cardinals. He won Game One 11–6, but lost the Game Five 1–0, which was a duel with former Blue Jays {{teammate}} Chris Carpenter. This loss eliminated the Phillies from the playoffs, a disappointment as they were touted as heavy favorites for the World Series, and {{it would turn out}} to be Halladay's final postseason appearance. Reflecting on that series at his retirement, Halladay said [...] "I think the one thing I took away from that is you can have the best team on paper, you can have the guys who want it the most. But when the squirrel runs across home plate while your team is trying to pitch, there is <b>nothing</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> do about that." ...|$|E

2500|$|When {{asked how}} he beat his addictions, Cornell stated, [...] "It was {{a long period of}} coming to the {{realization}} that this way (sober) is better. Going through rehab, honestly, did help... it got me away from just the daily drudgery of depression and either trying to not drink or do drugs or doing them and you know, they give you such a simple message that any idiot can get and it's just over and over, {{but the bottom line is}} really, and this is the part that is scary for everyone, the individual kinda has to want it... not kinda, you have to want it and to not do that crap anymore or you will never stop and it will just kill you. There’s <b>nothing</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> do...if your best friend has a problem and it's very serious, there's nothing you're going to be able to do about it and it was sad for me and the people around me. Sad for me when friends of mine died because of it." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{mixture of}} songs that {{inspired}} his own musical development, together {{with some of}} his own compositions, allied to a [...] backing band and orchestra (The Caledonia Soul Orchestra) and several performances (as noted in the album's liner notes) that were recorded in concerts at The Troubadour in Los Angeles, California (24–27 May 1973), the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium (29 June 1973) and The Rainbow (23–24 July 1973) in London. These performance result in what Myles Palmer of the Times reviewed as demolishing [...] "all barriers between the soul, blues, jazz and rock genres". The songs chosen went back to [...] his days with Them with versions of [...] "Gloria" [...] and [...] "Here Comes the Night". His first solo hit [...] "Brown Eyed Girl" [...] was performed but not included on the album until the reissue in 2008. M. Mark called the album [...] "an intelligent selection of songs that draws on six of Morrison's records and five of the musicians he learned from." [...] These musicians were Bobby Bland, ("Ain't <b>Nothing</b> <b>You</b> <b>Can</b> Do"), Ray Charles, ("I Believe to My Soul"), Sam Cooke ("Bring It On Home to Me"), [...] two songs by Sonny Boy Williamson II ("Help Me" [...] and [...] "Take Your Hands Out of My Pocket") [...] and a cover of a Willie Dixon song, [...] "I Just Want to Make Love to You" [...] that was popularized by Muddy Waters.|$|E
2500|$|The buildup to Steven's exit {{involved}} in a bisexual love triangle storyline between him, Stacey and Christian Clarke (John Partridge), who is the gay brother of Jane. On-screen, Steven and Stacey's friendship progressed into something more serious in March 2008, when they shared a kiss. Steven later decided {{he was ready to}} lose his virginity to Stacey, and took Ian's advice [...] "to try to name the England football team and substitutes as a technique for pacing himself," [...] which Sidwell has described as, [...] "a really funny scene to film [...] my favourite comedy moment since joining the show." [...] Speaking of the character's impending exit, he added: [...] "Steven loves Stacey as a friend, and would do anything for her. He misreads loving someone as being 'in love', though. Things aren't right between them, and he can't put his finger on the reason why. That's what's going to lead him to question his sexuality..." [...] On-screen, Steven was unable to consummate his love for Stacey, and after an emotional rant, he kissed Christian. The filming of the storyline posed difficulties for Aaron Sidwell; {{in an interview with the}} Daily Star he explained, [...] " [...] a really good friend of mine, so kissing her was weird, but we just got on with it! But I found it really challenging to kiss [...] because I'm not gay [...] I saw the conflict teenagers go through when they're struggling to come to terms with their sexuality. [...] is a cracking scene and I'm really pleased with it." [...] The storyline progressed with Steven denying his homosexual tendencies, leading Christian to continuously try and [...] "out" [...] him. John Partridge, has commented, [...] "Christian knew Steven was gay from the outset. He noticed Steven had tendencies that he himself had as a young man – and his gaydar is very good [...] Christian didn't ask to be kissed by Steven but now that it's happened he wants the boy to admit that he's gay. He basically wants to help him. Steven doesn't want to be gay and Christian knows how he feels. Coming out is hard for any young man [...] Christian's worried that Stacey is going to get hurt. He knows that when you're gay, you're gay. That's it. There's <b>nothing</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> do about it and if you try to hide it, people get hurt." [...] After the truth was revealed to Stacey, Steven falsely claimed to Ian that Christian had attempted to seduce him – a means of revenge for Christian's rejection. The following episode, Christian was banished from the Beales lives by Ian, although the truth eventually came out and Ian, despite initial concerns, was shown to be supportive of Steven's sexuality. The plot has been described as [...] "controversial" [...] and gay actor John Partridge has confessed that he had worries about it initially: [...] "A gay man having any sort of relationship with an 18-year-old boy is a bit contentious. However, I think it has been handled really well." ...|$|E
