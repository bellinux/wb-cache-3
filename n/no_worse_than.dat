5|$|While World War I {{affected}} all NHA teams, Ottawa {{was able}} to retain players and be competitive. The club finished <b>no</b> <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> second during the wartime seasons of 1914–15 to 1917–18.|$|E
5|$|Coates {{reached his}} peak at the 1976 games in Innsbruck. He competed in five events, {{and apart from}} a 25th-place finish in the 500m event, did <b>no</b> <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> 11th in the {{remaining}} four. He came sixth in the 10,000m, eighth in the 1,500m and tenth in the 5,000m. It was {{only the second time}} that an Australian had placed in the top 10, and remained Australia's best result until 1994. His five skiing compatriots were less productive; they registered in 13 races between them and completed only seven due to crashes and disqualifications, with only one top 30 result.|$|E
5|$|Bosanquet {{was one of}} the few bowlers in the MCC team not to {{have some}} success in the opening two matches of the tour, {{although}} he impressed Warner. In addition, he scored 79 runs with the bat in the second game. The third match of the tour was against New South Wales; Bosanquet took four for 60, and his googly caused many problems, particularly for Australia's opening batsman Reggie Duff. He continuously defeated the batsmen, maintaining his length effectively through the innings. By this stage of the tour, Warner believed that Bosanquet was potentially the best bowler in a strong attack if he could bowl a good length, particularly on hard, fast pitches which normally would favour the batsmen. However, Bosnaquet's bowling form remained erratic; in a minor match against a weak side, the opposing captain made a joke about his team's bowling being <b>no</b> <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> Bosanquet's.|$|E

5|$|Lewis (Clark Johnson) and Crosetti (Jon Polito) {{investigate}} the fatal shooting of a man, who was apparently killed for a $1.49 pen. Lewis believes {{there must be}} more to the story, refusing to believe a pen is worth killing for. When they search suspect Mitchell Forman's (Sal S. Koussa) apartment, they find thousands of pens, many of which line the walls like bizarre decorations. Lewis later finds Forman at the police station, where he originally planned to turn himself in, but instead {{went up to the}} roof to commit suicide. Lewis lures Forman away from the ledge by enticing him with a beautiful golden pen, which belonged to Lewis' deceased grandmother. Forman is taken into custody. Later, Lewis still cannot believe someone would kill over a pen, but Gee (Yaphet Kotto) suggests it is <b>no</b> <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> killing over a car or woman. Lewis, determined not to develop such a strong attachment to a material item, gives his grandmother's pen to Felton (Daniel Baldwin).|$|E
5|$|The {{sinking of}} the {{hospital}} ship AHSCentaur on 14May1943 with heavy loss of life led the Advisory War Council to seek information from the RAN and RAAF on the actions being taken to protect shipping. While the RAN acknowledged that the Bathurst-class corvettes that made up most of its escort force were too slow, it argued that the losses suffered by escorted convoys were <b>no</b> <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> those {{in other parts of}} the world. Despite the Navy's assurances, Australia's anti-submarine forces were constrained by a shortage of training opportunities and poor coordination between the RAN, RAAF and the United States Navy. The Australian military had also not kept pace with improvements to British and United States ASW doctrine by fully implementing the tactics that had proven most successful in other theatres of the war.|$|E
5|$|Two Angels first-round picks, outfielder Darin Erstad (1995) {{and third}} basemen Troy Glaus (1997), {{played with the}} 2002 World Series {{championship}} team. Outfielder Mike Trout, who was chosen in 2009 and has spent his entire MLB career to date with the Angels, was named American League Rookie of the Year in 2012, and has finished <b>no</b> <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> second in voting for American League Most Valuable Player {{in each of his}} first five full seasons with the Angels, winning that award in 2014 and 2016. Pitcher Jim Abbott (1988), born without a right hand, won the 1987 Golden Spikes Award while playing at the University of Michigan, and the 1992 Tony Conigliaro Award and the 1995 Hutch Award while with the Angels. Danny Goodwin (1975), who was picked first overall in 1971 by the Chicago White Sox but opted for four years of college, is the only player to be selected first in the draft on two separate occasions.|$|E

Regardless of the Waikato-Harbour result, Auckland was assured of <b>no</b> <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> the second seed they eventually received. Harbour received the third seed.|$|E
25|$|Starting from 1987, the NBA {{modified}} the lottery {{system so that}} only the first three picks were determined by the lottery. After the three envelopes were drawn, the remaining non-playoff teams would select in reverse order of their win-loss record. This meant that {{the team with the}} worst record could receive <b>no</b> <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> the fourth selection, and the second-worst team could pick no lower than fifth, and so on.|$|E
25|$|While the {{admissibility}} criterion guarantees {{an optimal}} solution path, {{it also means}} that A* must examine all equally meritorious paths to find the optimal path. To compute approximate shortest paths, it is possible to speed up the search at the expense of optimality by relaxing the admissibility criterion. Oftentimes we want to bound this relaxation, so that we can guarantee that the solution path is <b>no</b> <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> (1 + ε) times the optimal solution path. This new guarantee is referred to as ε-admissible.|$|E

25|$|The {{entire process}} was {{undertaken}} {{with the utmost}} secrecy, {{as much for the}} public as for the accused, who were not informed about the accusations that were levied against them. Months or even years could pass without the accused being informed about why they were imprisoned. The prisoners remained isolated, and, during this time, the prisoners were not allowed to attend Mass nor receive the sacraments. The jails of the Inquisition were <b>no</b> <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> those of secular authorities, and there are even certain testimonies that occasionally they were much better.|$|E
25|$|Injuries in rock {{climbing}} are mainly sports injuries that occur due to falls or overuse. Injuries due to falls are relatively uncommon; {{the vast majority}} of injuries result from overuse, most often occurring in the fingers, elbows, and shoulders. Such injuries are often <b>no</b> <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> torn calluses, cuts, burns and bruises. There are a number of skincare products specifically for climbers available in the market. However, overuse symptoms, if ignored, may lead to permanent damage especially to tendons, tendon sheaths, ligaments, and capsules. Injuries from lead climbing are common.|$|E
25|$|Jeffery {{comments}} {{that for all}} Wilson’s reputation for intrigue he was mainly an inveterate gossip (a feature which endeared him to some politicians), whose closeness to the French alienated Robertson, and whose behaviour was <b>no</b> <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> the intrigues of Robertson, Haig, Rawlinson and Gough to remove Sir John French. His reputation for political intrigue was acquired for {{his involvement in the}} arguments over conscription and Ireland in 1912–14. Esher (in his life of Kitchener) later blamed Wilson’s “Irish blood, exuberant with combative malice” for having drawn him into the latter quarrel, which had earned him the reputation of “a pestilential fellow”.|$|E

25|$|During the Arameans' {{siege of}} Samaria, four leprous {{men at the}} gate asked each other why they should die there of starvation, when they might go to the Arameans, who would either save them or leave them <b>no</b> <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> they were. When at twilight, {{they went to the}} Arameans' camp, there was no one there, for God had made the Arameans hear chariots, horses, and a great army, and fearing the Hittites and the Egyptians, they fled, leaving their tents, their horses, their donkeys, and their camp. The lepers went into a tent, ate and drank, and carried away silver, gold, and {{clothing}} from the tents and hid it.|$|E
25|$|He {{was also}} in deep trouble at the time. Accusations of his having persuaded others to atheism were coming to the Privy Council thick and fast and, whether true or not, he was {{certainly}} suspected of having written an atheistic book which was being used for subversive purposes. For such crimes, trial and execution would have been almost guaranteed. Within the past two months, at least three people, Henry Barrow, John Greenwood and John Penry, {{had gone to the}} scaffold for offences <b>no</b> <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> this. Marlovians therefore contend that Marlowe would have had a strong motive for either being complicit in or agreeing to some means of escape.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, {{advisory}} {{panels in}} both the U.S. and Canada encouraged the return of rofecoxib to the market, stating that rofecoxib's benefits outweighed the risks for some patients. The FDA advisory panel voted 17-15 to allow the drug {{to return to the}} market despite being found to increase heart risk. The vote in Canada was 12-1, and the Canadian panel noted that the cardiovascular risks from rofecoxib seemed to be <b>no</b> <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> those from ibuprofenthough the panel stated that further study was needed for all NSAIDs to fully understand their risk profiles. Notwithstanding these recommendations, Merck has not returned rofecoxib to the market.|$|E

25|$|Since {{its formal}} {{founding}} in 1839, {{the city of}} Galveston had weathered numerous storms, all of which the city survived with ease. Residents believed any future storms would be <b>no</b> <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> previous events. In order to provide an official meteorological statement on the threat of hurricanes, Galveston Weather Bureau section director Isaac Cline wrote an 1891 article in the Galveston Daily News in which he argued not only that a seawall was not needed to protect the city, but also {{that it would be}} impossible for a hurricane of significant strength to strike the island. The seawall was not built, and development activities on the island actively increased its vulnerability to storms. Sand dunes along the shore were cut down to fill low areas in the city, removing what little barrier there was to the Gulf of Mexico.|$|E
25|$|With {{their return}} to Frankfurt a new epoch {{in the history of}} the Jews of that city begins. They were still {{debarred}} from acquiring real estate, but they loaned money, even accepting manuscripts as pledges. The rate of interest, formerly as high as 24 percent, was now reduced to 8 percent. As the unredeemed pledges were sold, traffic in second-hand goods arose, which was further stimulated by the fact that the Jews were not permitted to sell new goods. They were also forbidden to deal in spices, provisions, weapons, cloth, and (from 1634 on) grain. But in spite of these interdictions, their commerce gradually increased. During the Thirty Years' War the Jews fared <b>no</b> <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> their neighbors. In 1694 there were 415 Jewish families; of these, 109 persons were engaged as moneylenders and dealers in second-hand goods; 106 dealt in dry goods, clothes, and trimmings; 24 in spices and provisions; 9 retailed wine and beer; 3 were innkeepers; and 2 had restaurants. Besides these there were the communal officials.|$|E
25|$|In the Netherlands, {{a playoff}} was {{introduced}} in season 2005–2006. It is used to determine which teams from the Eredivisie qualify for European football. The playoff system has been criticized by clubs, players and fans {{as the number of}} matches will increase. Under the original playoff format, it was possible, though thoroughly unlikely, that the runner-up would not qualify for Europe; the following year, the format was changed so that the second-place team was assured of <b>no</b> <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> a UEFA Cup berth. Starting in 2008–09, the format was changed yet again. The champion goes directly to the Champions League; the runner-up enters the second qualification round of the CL; the number three enters the fourth (and last) qualification round of the UEFA Europa League (EL; the new name of the UEFA Cup from 2009–10 onward) and the number four goes to the third qualification round of the EL. The only play-off will be for the clubs placed 5th through 8th. The winner of that play-off receives a ticket for the second qualification round of the EL.|$|E
