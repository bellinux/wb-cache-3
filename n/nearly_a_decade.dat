5|$|Libia had a {{relatively}} uneventful career. Before Italy's entry into World War I, {{she was involved}} in the evacuation of Prince William, the ruler of Albania, from Durazzo in late 1914. Following Italy's declaration of war in May 1915, Libia patrolled the Otranto Barrage but did not see action. In 192122, she went on a world tour, during which she was featured in a short documentary produced by the then-unknown Frank Capra.

5|$|<b>Nearly</b> <b>a</b> <b>decade</b> {{after the}} Tagora had ceased production, {{the view of}} the car in the {{automotive}} press was that it was merely average though there was little actively wrong with the car. The view was that the Tagora had the advantage of refinement, good manners and, in V6 form, good performance. Rust was identified as the single biggest problem for the surviving cars, usually around the rear suspension mountings. Buckley suggested that the car might attain collectible status by 2003.|$|E
5|$|Once air-to-air combat began over North Vietnam, the Air Force {{was again}} found lacking. The {{mainstay}} missiles {{of the air}} war {{turned out to be}} the Navy-developed AIM-9 Sidewinder and AIM-7 Sparrow, not its own AIM-4 Falcon. The Air Force continuously opposed adapting to the war in Southeast Asia, since its leadership believed that it was an aberration that would be quickly resolved. It could then turn its attention (and its more modern weapons) against the greater threat posed by the Soviet Union. None in the Air Force high command foresaw that the war would drag on for <b>nearly</b> <b>a</b> <b>decade.</b>|$|E
50|$|After the 1989-1990 season, Jon Lovitz {{left the}} show {{amicably}} {{with the intent}} of focusing on a film career. These departures marked the first incidents of turnover on the show in <b>nearly</b> half <b>a</b> <b>decade.</b> While Lovitz's departure happened more quietly and without controversy, the Dunn/Clay incident seemed to be a sad forerunner for the turmoil which would dominate the show for much of the 1990s.|$|R
50|$|Cycles of {{administrative}} upheaval accompanied these dramatic changes at PHS. The {{first of two}} major reorganizations reflected <b>nearly</b> <b>a</b> <b>decade’s</b> worth of planning, articulated in terms of operations research and functionally oriented management theory (known as program planning and budgeting). In contrast, the second was a dramatic reshuffling of the organizational deck by Acting Secretary of DHEW and Medicare program architect Wilbur Cohen. When Stewart became Surgeon General, he inherited an agency over which he, a career officer in PHS’s Commissioned Corps, exerted line authority. PHS enjoyed strong relationships with state health departments, the American Medical Association, and budgetary largesse for the National Institutes of Health. As {{a result of the}} two reorganizations, his successor would report as a senior advisor to the Assistant Secretary for Health and Scientific Affairs, a political appointee, and would not even be appointed until well into President Nixon’s first term.|$|R
50|$|Reinforced by {{new stars}} Ezequiel Lavezzi, Zlatan Ibrahimović and Thiago Silva, PSG warmed {{up for the}} 2012-13 season {{with the aim of}} winning the league crown that {{dramatically}} eluded the club the previous year. Paris began at home to Lorient at the Parc des Princes. Les Merlus caused Paris plenty of problems and the match ended 2-2 thanks to Ibrahimović's first brace of the season. The PSG squad took a little time to get going and after three consecutive draws, Les Parisiens recorded their first victory in Week 4. It was in the north of France that Paris finally launched their campaign against Lille and a 2-1 victory featuring another double from Ibrahimović. Another three points followed against Toulouse (2-0), before {{it was time for the}} UEFA Champions League. After <b>nearly</b> <b>a</b> <b>decade's</b> absence, PSG marked their return to Europe's premier club competition with a resounding 4-1 victory over Dynamo Kyiv.|$|R
5|$|The British and Germans {{had been}} {{competing}} in radar technology for <b>nearly</b> <b>a</b> <b>decade</b> at this point, with the German technology {{often at the}} same level as the British or surpassing them due to heavy investment in the fledgling technology. By the beginning of World War II, Britain had devised effective radar systems, primarily through the work of Robert Watson-Watt, although much of the technology was still rudimentary in nature and Watson-Watt and other scientists had failed to devise an effective night-defence system in time for the German nighttime bombing of Britain during 1940.|$|E
5|$|When Ian Fleming {{sold the}} film {{rights to the}} James Bond novels to Harry Saltzman and Albert R. Broccoli, he gave {{permission}} only for the title The Spy Who Loved Me to be used.

This would also be the first regular Bond novel published since Colonel Sun <b>nearly</b> <b>a</b> <b>decade</b> earlier. Christopher Wood, who co-authored the screenplay, was commissioned to write the book titled James Bond, The Spy Who Loved Me.|$|E
5|$|After Burebista's death, {{the empire}} {{he had created}} {{dissolved}} into smaller kingdoms. From the reign of Tiberius to Domitian, Dacian activity was reduced into a defensive state. The Romans abandoned plans of mounting an invasion against Dacia. In 86 AD, however, the king Decebalus successfully re-united the Dacian kingdom under his control. Domitian attempted a hasty invasion against the Dacians which ended in disaster. A second invasion later brought peace between Rome and Dacia for <b>nearly</b> <b>a</b> <b>decade,</b> until in 98 AD Trajan became emperor. Trajan also pursued two conquests of Dacia, the first in 101–102 AD which concluded in a Roman victory. Decebalus was forced to agree to harsh terms of peace, but did not honour them. This sparked a second invasion of Dacia in 106 AD which ended {{the independence of the}} Dacian kingdom, and brought about its break-up.|$|E
