His father had founded Epoca newspaper in 1885, and in September 1918, the son decided to revive the moribund outfit, buying the trademark from its <b>nominal</b> <b>owner,</b> Timoleon Pisani. Filipescu and Constantin Argetoianu identified two financiers, Aristide Blank and Jean Chrissoveloni. In exchange for backing from the latter two, the newspaper owners joined the administration of Marmorosch Blank Bank, alongside Duca, Toma Stelian, and Alexandru Vaida-Voevod. Blank's involvement would fuel the suspicions of antisemitic groups that the newspaper was a tool of the Jews. While Blank's influence was exaggerated, he did have a say in the editorial policy. For instance, when an article critical of Liviu Rebreanu was slated to appear, the financier convinced Filipescu not to run the story. Instead, in 1919 Epoca published a dossier on Marghiloman's wartime stances.|$|E

50|$|Media {{ownership}} is regulated by national laws {{in line with}} international standards and with clear limitations in terms of shares of ownership that a person can hold in different media outlets.

A broadcast regulatory body keeps an official registry which lists {{the names of the}} <b>nominal</b> <b>owners.</b> However, this is not able to preventing hidden ownership through proxies and the real owners of many broadcasting media are unknown by the public. One the main problem affecting Macedonian media system in terms of {{ownership is}} that companies and business people having a very diverse portfolios own most of the influential national television networks and cable television stations, but broadcast is not their main activity. Indeed, owners use their broadcast media primarily to support their other business activities and often influence the editorial policies in accordance with their business interests. Also, especially for traditional media which are nominally transparent, in many cases <b>nominal</b> <b>owners</b> only act as proxies for de facto owners that are often high-ranking officials of political parties.|$|R

50|$|According {{to a study}} {{carried out}} within the South East European Media Observatory, the lack of {{transparency}} in media ownership and in the financial flows for the media {{is one of the}} major problem affecting the media system in Kosovo. In the 2016 progress report, the European Commission (EC) expressed worries about the lack of transparency regarding media ownership in Kosovo. The implementation of measures to provide for transparent information on media ownership is among one of the recommendation made by the EC for the years to come. This situation is a consequence of the existing legal vacuum in the field. The scarce available data on media ownership and finances are badly reliable. Current legislation does not address the issue of media ownership transparency and concentration. These issues were not dealt with by the first provisional media regulations adopted by UNMIK in 2000, so that de facto the issue was left to the authority of the Temporary Media Commissioner. The Independent Media Commission database usually contains the names of media owners. In some cases, only the names of contact persons are disclosed. Private media are registered to the Kosovo Business Registration Agency according to the law regulating businesses transparency. If in the case of print media, the owners are de facto largely known due to the fact that they publish information about ownership and editorial staff, and to the small size of the market and social interaction, this does not apply to electronic media which sector lacks proper regulation resulting in the complete lack of registration and of information on ownership, finances and human resources. The problem of lack of transparency of online media has further augmented with the explosion of digital media market. A 2014 study that examined ownership transparency of eight news portals found out that none of them made publicly available information on ownership, only two published the names of the editors-in-chief, two provided information on the staff working in the media, and six offered information on the address of the outlet. According to some experts, this has contributed to an environment enabling fictive online portals to be established as political propaganda tools and to exert pressure on professional media outlets. The television and broadcast sector also remains heavily problematic in terms of media ownership transparency. Media analysts have thus raised concern on who exactly owns and controls the media in Kosovo, behind the <b>nominal</b> <b>owners.</b> This situation makes possible to identify a specific ownership pattern in Kosovo media system, which takes the shape of hidden ownership and <b>nominal</b> <b>owners</b> as a cover for actual owners. Experts find this fact suspicious and alarming.|$|R

Second, the findings also suggest that economic context has a substantial impact on the public's economic objectives in a way broadly consistent with the specification of utility/loss functions in the theoretical political economy literature. Third, {{the results suggest that}} there is significant cross-country variation in inflation aversion, controlling for economic context and individual attributes, and that some of this variation can be accounted for by national-level factors affecting the aggregate costs of inflation and unemployment. Cross-country variation in inflation aversion, controlling for economic context has significant implications for both optimal monetary policy making and for models of alternative institutional frameworks for policy-making. ...|$|R

The conflicts did not stop however, as there were clans that had ownership of lands now inhabited by Turkic peoples, meaning that if they did not retake the lands, they would lack their own territory and be forever reliant on the laws of hospitality of other clans (doing great damage to their honor). Conflicts between Vainakh and Turkic peoples originating from the Mongol Invasion when Chechens were driven out of the Terek and Sunzha rivers by Turco-Mongolian invaders continued as late as the 1750s and 1770s.

40|$|Motiviran stihovima fra Andrije Kačića Miošića, autor je pronašao niz biografskih podataka o nekoliko osoba iz Dalmatinske zagore koje su se svojim junaštvom istakle u Morejskom ratu 1684. – 1699. Iz navedenog su dobivene dodatne potvrde mletačke politike prema stanovništvu oslobođenih područja. U drugom dijelu rada rekonstruirana su migracijska kretanja i učinak islamizacije na tom prostoru u razdoblju od kraja 15. do kraja 17. stoljeća. When friar Andrija Kačić Miošić {{put into}} verse Razgovor ugodni (“Pleasant Conversation”) he stated {{as one of}} the motivations for his writing “to keep alive for many centuries the famous names of the knights, to {{preserve}} these and to keep the memory of their heroism. ” The work was very popular because Kačić dedicated his verses not only to individuals from aristocratic circles but also to heroes from the people – free peasantswarriors. The first person whose war deeds during the prolonged conflicts with the Turks made him deserving of being mentioned by the poet was Petar Radić Šare from Suhi Dolac, a village {{in the western part of}} the Dalmatian hinterland. In battle Petar killed five foes in duels while two others he captured – all of these were named. The second prominent warrior was Ilija Radić also from Suhi Dolac, the third was Ivan Valižić, probably from Ljubitovica, and the fourth was Martin Despotović Čolak (“One-armed”). For him it is stated that he overcame fifteen foes – but unnamed. All of them participated in the war between the Holy League and the Ottoman Empire (1684 – 1699) under the command of the commanders Janković and Nakić, during which war the Ottomans were driven back from the greater part of today’s Dalmatia. On the basis of facts from Venetian cadastres one is able to establish the size of their land holdings and the number of animals (horses, cows, etc.) in their possession. They were either the wealthiest or amongst the wealthiest farmers in their villages. Besides this, additional data pertaining to Petar Radić show that he was in the top ranks of the army hierarchy even before the beginning of the war. Owing to the fact that all of Petar’s foes were individually named it was possible to approximately identify almost each one of them. Ahmed was a well-know violent person, Mehmed-aga was also a member of the feudal, administrative layer of the Ottoman state while Tursulović and Ahmed Čolak can also be connected to the usurpation group which made the moves that brought about the war. It has to be emphasized that duels were valued by both sides and that engagement in them separated a person from the anonymous soldiers. Further research has uncovered that Petar’s ancestors had also engaged in a series of former conflicts with the Ottomans either directly or as “uskok” soldiers (frontier soldiers) either clandestinely or as their supporters. The Vlachs began to settle the area between Velebit and Biokovo in the 14 th century. Organized into shepherd’s settlements they became vassals of the Croatian duke, that is, the king or the lords of the Šubić and Nelipić family and afterwards of the Kurjaković family. During the seasonal movements of their flock they used the winter pastures in the south of the Dalmatian hinterland while during the summer they went to the pastures on Dinara and the surrounding mountains. Although initially the coastal cities were fiercely against their presence on their territory, in the 15 th century a mutual so-existence gradually came into being. However, the incursion of the Ottomans disturbed this state of things because the Vlachs, due to the war, lost their winter pastures. Because of this a segment of the Vlachs temporarily moved to today’s western Herzegovina where the Ottomans incorporated them into the military-economic system of the Ottoman empire. After the fall of Sinj and Knin in 1522, the Vlachs returned to the Dalmatian hinterland where they continued their biseasonal way of cattle raising. From that time shepherd settlements named Vojnići, Popovići and Vratkovići find mention within the hinterland area of Trogir and Šibenik county and in the Cetina river area. As Ottoman subjects they were engaged as mercenaries in the military system so that the “uskoks” treated them as the targets of their diversions in the Klis Ottoman area. On the other hand, some of the inhabitants of these shepherd settlements openly joined the “uskoks” or clandestinely aided the efforts to liberate Klis at the end of the 16 th century. The problem of the status of these Vlachs became aggravated because of the unsolved questions of the Venetian-Turkish border on the hinterland part of Trogir district. Namely, they worked the land whose <b>nominal</b> <b>owners</b> were Trogir patricians but the local Turkish lords did not recognize this referring to the factual state of things. When the Candian war broke out, the Vlachs allied themselves with the Venetian Republic but because their removal was improperly organized only a smaller part of them fled to the liberated territory around Klis. Only the favorable outcome of the war between the Holy League and the Ottoman Empire enabled a solution of their status but because of the establishment of the border they lost the greater part of their summer pastures. The division of the shepherd settlements which was in place all the time up to this period, disappeared because of the arrival of new displaced persons from the region of western Herzegovina and southwestern Bosnia but also because of the administrative reorganization carried out by the Venetian Republic. Islamization within the area of the western Dalmatian hinterland had almost no success. Three factors can account for this. The first is the distance of the area from the main fortresses and cities with a Muslim population and administrative apparatus. The second was the activity of the Franciscans on Visovac and the third was the official status of the Vlachs which the inhabitants of the shepherd settlements had within the larger part of the area under Otoman government. When the Turkish rulers started implementing outright violence, during the Candian war and the war between the Holy League and the Ottoman Empire, the Vlachs joined the Venetian Republic and directly contributed to the liberation of a large part of today’s Dalmatia...|$|R
