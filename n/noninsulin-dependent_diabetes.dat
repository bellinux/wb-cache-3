40|$|White {{diabetic}} {{patients are}} at high risk of developing coronary artery disease (CAD). The natural history of CAD in insulin-dependent (ID) and <b>noninsulin-dependent</b> (NID) <b>diabetes</b> mellitus (DM) is reviewed to gain insight into the mechanisms responsible for the development of premature or accelerated atherosclerosis in diabetic patients. In both IDDM and NIDDM, the risk of CAD increases with lengthening duration of diabetes; the risk, however, does not grow as a constant multiple of the nondiabetic risk of CAD, suggesting that the cumulative exposure to diabetes plays a significant role as a risk factor for CAD only in a subset of patients. This is consistent with the hypothesis that the diabetic milieu has an impact on the progression of atherosclerotic lesions but not on their initiation. This hypothesis is corroborated further by the observation that CAD does not occur in diabetic patients in populations with a low risk of CAD among nondiabetic patients. The component of the diabetic milieu responsible for promotion of atherosclerotic lesions is unknown. There is evidence, however, of a direct or indirect role of hyperinsulinemia in this process...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES. <b>Noninsulin-dependent</b> <b>diabetes</b> mellitus, a {{major risk}} factor for {{cardiovascular}} disease, is prevalent in more than 12 million Americans. A voluminous amount of data demonstrates that cigarette smoking is an important cause of cancer and coronary heart disease. However, the association between cigarette smoking {{and the risk of}} diabetes is virtually unexplored, especially in women. METHODS. We examined the association between smoking and the incidence of <b>noninsulin-dependent</b> <b>diabetes</b> mellitus among 114, 247 female nurses who were free of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer in 1976. We collected exposure information and disease status prospectively for 12 years from biennially self-administered questionnaires. RESULTS. Current smokers had an increased risk of diabetes, and we observed a significant dose-response trend for higher risk among heavier smokers. During 1, 277, 589 person-years of follow-up, 2333 women were clinically diagnosed with diabetes. The relative risk of diabetes, adjusted for obesity and other risk factors, was 1. 42 among women who smoked 25 or more cigarettes per day compared with nonsmokers. CONCLUSIONS.

Significant univariate correlations were observed between PA-inhibitor activity and age (r = 0. 32, p less than 0. 05), diastolic blood pressure (r = 0. 42, p less than 0. 01) and euglobulin fibrinolytic activity (r = - 0. 40, p less than 0. 01).

40|$|ObjectivesIn this study, {{the impact}} of <b>noninsulin-dependent</b> type 2 <b>diabetes</b> {{mellitus}} on carotid wall 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake in patients with documented or suspected cardiovascular disease was evaluated. BackgroundInflammation is a pivotal process in the progression of atherosclerosis, which can be noninvasively imaged by FDG positron emission tomography (FDG-PET). MethodsCarotid artery wall FDG uptake was quantified in 134 patients (age 60. 2 ± 9. 7 years; diabetic subjects, n = 43). The pre-scan glucose (gluc) level corrected mean of the maximum standardized uptake value (SUV) values (meanSUVgluc), mean of the maximum target-to-background ratio (meanTBRgluc), and single hottest segment (SHSgluc) of FDG uptake in the artery wall were calculated. Associations between FDG uptake, the presence of risk factors for atherosclerosis, and diabetes were then assessed by multiple regression analysis with backward elimination. ResultsThe study demonstrated a significant association between diabetes and FDG uptake in the arterial wall (diabetes meanSUVgluc β = 0. 324, meanTBRgluc β = 0. 317, and SHSgluc β = 0. 298; for all, p < 0. 0001).

40|$|AbstractObjectives. This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the role of insulin-dependent and <b>noninsulin-dependent</b> <b>diabetes</b> in the prognosis of patients after myocardial infarction and treatment with fibrinolytic agents. Background. Several studies have shown that diabetic patients have a high mortality rate after acute myocardial infarction. However, the impact of diabetes on survival in patients treated with fibrinolytic agents is still undefined. It is also not known whether the type of diabetes or gender affects prognosis. Methods. We analyzed prevalence and prognostic significance of a history of diabetes in patients enrolled in the GISSI- 2 study, all of whom received fibrinolytic agents. The incidence of deaths in the hospital and at 6 months after study entry was computed for patients without diabetes and for insulin-dependent and noninsulin-dependent diabetic patients; relative risks were evaluated by univariate and multivariate analysis. Results. Information on diabetic status was available for 11, 667 patients, 94. 2 % of those randomized in the GISSI- 2 study. The prevalence of diabetes was higher in women than in men (8. 75 % vs. 1. 85 %, p < 0. 01 for insulin-dependent and 23. 7 % vs. 13. 8 %, p < 0. 01 for noninsulin-dependent diabetic patients). The type of fibrinolytic agent did not affect mortality rates; the increase in in-hospital mortality of diabetic patients was moderate and similar for men with insulin- and <b>noninsulin-dependent</b> <b>diabetes</b> (8. 7 % and 10. 1 %, respectively, vs. 5. 8 % in nondiabetic patients); in women, mortality was markedly higher for insulin-dependent and only slightly higher for noninsulin-dependent diabetic patients (24. 0 % and 15. 8 %, respectively, vs. 13. 9 % for nondiabetic patients). The adjusted relative risks were 1. 9 (95 % confidence interval 1. 2 to 2. 9) for insulin-dependent diabetic women and 1. 4 (95 % confidence interval 1. 1 to 1. 8) for noninsulin-dependent diabetic men. The mortality rate after discharge showed a similar gender difference, and in insulin-dependent diabetic women, prognosis was ominous {{even in the absence of}} left ventricular damage before discharge. Conclusion. A history of diabetes is associated with a worse prognosis after myocardial infarction, even in patients treated with fibrinolytic agents. Gender and type of diabetes appear to be critical in affecting survival. In men, both insulin-dependent and <b>noninsulin-dependent</b> <b>diabetes</b> are associated with a moderately higher mortality rate; in women, insulin-dependent diabetes is, in itself, a strong risk factor for death after myocardial infarction...|$|E

Comparisons of lipoprotein (a) concentrations were made between a normal control group, a group of diabetic patients with glycated hemoglobin (HbA 1 c) less than 8. 0 %, and a group of diabetic patients with HbA 1 c of 8. 0 % or higher. • Patients: Ninety-five normal controls and 93 diabetic subjects (49 with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and 44 with <b>noninsulin-dependent</b> <b>diabetes</b> mellitus). • Results: Sixty diabetic subjects with HbA 1 c levels of 8. 0 % or higher had higher (25 mg/dL) median levels of lipoprotein (a) when compared with either 93 normal controls (8. 8 mg/dL) or 33 diabetic patients with HbA 1 c less than 8. 0 % (7. 5 mg/dL) (P = 0. 008 and P = 0. 012, respectively). A similar pattern of distribution of lipopro-tein (a) levels according to degree of metabolic control was seen in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and <b>noninsulin-dependent</b> <b>diabetes</b> mellitus.

Measurements: Participants were classified as having non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus if they were receiving antidiabetic medication or {{if they had a}} serum glucose level of 11. 1 mmol/L or more after a nonfasting oral glucose tolerance test. Bone mineral density, measured at the lumbar spine and proximal femur using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry and the frequency of nonvertebral fractures during the preceding 5 years were compared between persons with and without non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Results: 243 men and 335 women had non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Both men and women with this condition had substantially higher mean bone mineral density values at all four sites measured than those with normal glucose tolerance. The increase could not be explained by age; obesity; use of estrogens, thiazides, or loop diuretics; impairment in abilities of daily living; smoking; or osteoarthritis. Women with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus reported having had fewer fractures in the 5 preceding years than women without this condition (adjusted odds ratio, 0. 63; 95 % CI, 0. 44 to 0. 90).

The majority of these infections have occurred in locations where infection-control precautions either had not been instituted or had been instituted but were not followed. Recommended infection-control precautions include the use of negative-pressure isolation rooms where available; N 95 or higher level of respiratory protection; gloves, gowns, and eye protection; and careful hand hygiene. This report summarizes a cluster of SARS cases among HCWs in a hospital that occurred despite apparent compliance with recommended infection-control precautions (1). The index patient was a Canadian family physician aged 54 years with a history of hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and <b>noninsulin-dependent</b> <b>diabetes</b> controlled on oral medications...|$|E
40|$|Diabetes {{mellitus}} {{is characterized}} by recurrent metabolic abnormalities which postmortem studies suggest might be associated with degenerative changes in the central nervous system. Acute hypoglycemia does indeed lead to cognitive impairment, whereas acute hyperglycemia {{in the absence of}} ketoacidosis or hyperosmolarity does not. Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus is associated with cognitive deficits that tend to be relatively slight, inconsistent between different studies, and unrelated to clinical indicators; they can be ascribed as plausibly to psychogenic factors as to degenerative disease. In contrast, cognitive impairment in <b>noninsulin-dependent</b> <b>diabetes</b> mellitus is more conspicuous in tests of learning and memory, consistently associated with a patient's level of glycemic control, and more plausibly to be ascribed to structural neuropathology. Nevertheless, in both cases the deficits in question are unlikely to interfere significantly with patients' everyday functioning...|$|E
40|$|The {{consequences}} of obesity in adulthood are well known. Obesity {{has a direct}} influence on mortality and acts as {{a risk factor for}} various diseases and health problems. It is associated with nonfatal but debilitating illnesses, such as respiratory difficulties, musculoskeletal disorders, skin problems and infertility. The association with fatal chronic diseases includes cardiovascular diseases, conditions related to insulin resistance and <b>noninsulin-dependent</b> <b>diabetes.</b> There has been a marked {{increase in the number of}} obese children coming for treatment to dentists, thus it is the moral responsibility of the dentists to educate both the patient and the parents of the problems of obesity and its control. A dentist may actually be the first person to inform the patient about this problem thus, a basic knowledge about it is important...|$|E
