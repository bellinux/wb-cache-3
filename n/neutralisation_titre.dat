40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{follow the}} change in {{streptokinase}} neutralisation titres {{in a group of}} patients after treatment with streptokinase for acute myocardial infarction. DESIGN [...] Venous blood samples suitable for analysis were obtained up to 866 days after treatment with 1. 5 million units of streptokinase in 189 patients. The ability of the patient's plasma to inhibit lysis of a thrombin clot by streptokinase was assessed. SETTING [...] A coronary care unit in a district general hospital. PATIENTS [...] A retrospective review of coronary care records and the district health authority computer showed that 329 patients who had received streptokinase were alive. All were invited for venepuncture and 220 (67 %) attended. Satisfactory samples were obtained from 189 patients. RESULTS [...] Raised titres of antibody sufficient to neutralise a standard dose of 1. 5 million units of streptokinase were found in 90 % of patients. There was a fall in streptokinase <b>neutralisation</b> <b>titre</b> with increasing time after administration of streptokinase (r = - 0. 35, P < 0. 0001) and though there was considerable variation among the group the <b>neutralisation</b> <b>titre</b> was higher than in the general population in all patients, even those who had received streptokinase at least two years previously. CONCLUSION [...] The ability of streptokinase to lyse a thrombin clot was appreciably inhibited in vitro by the plasma from patients who had received 1. 5 million units of streptokinase. High streptokinase neutralisation titres persisted {{for a long time after}} the use of streptokinase as thrombolytic treatment for acute myocardial infarction. Readministration of streptokinase may not be efficacious for considerably longer than the one year currently advocated. Until the in vivo effects of streptokinase readministration are known a non-antigenic thrombolytic agent should be used instead...|$|E
40|$|Three {{groups of}} three pigs were vaccinated either with vac-cine VAC-SLY, {{containing}} purified suilysin derived from Streptococcus suis strain P 1 / 7 (serotype 2), or with vaccine VAC-SCF, containing {{most of the other}} extracellular antigens produced by strain P 1 / 7 (but essentially free from suilysin), or with a placebo vaccine. The pigs were vaccinated twice at four weeks and six weeks of age and were challenged intravenously with S suis strain P 1 / 7 at eight weeks of age. On the day of challenge, only the VAC-SLY vaccinated pigs showed an increase in haemolysin <b>neutralisation</b> <b>titre.</b> After challenge the placebo vaccinated pigs developed severe clinical signs charac-terised by lameness involving several joints, a depressed appearance, high temperatures and/or neurological signs. The VAC-SCF vaccinated pigs showed the same clinical signs but less severely. The VAC-SLY vaccinated pigs were the leas...|$|E
40|$|Local {{infiltration}} of antiserum into sites inoculated with B virus protected rabbits from an otherwise fatal encephalomyelitis. Treatment was effective when delayed {{for six hours}} but not after 24 hours. Homologous rabbit antisera were more effective than heterologous monkey antisera, and protection was unrelated to <b>neutralisation</b> <b>titres.</b> Protection apparently depended not on neutralisation of inoculated virus but on destruction of infected cells before they produced progeny virus. Normal human immunoglobulin able to neutralise B virus did not protect. Intravenously administered antibody was effective only if large doses were given. The findings suggest that persons bitten or scratched by monkeys latently infected with B virus may be treated successfully by immunoprophylaxis with specific antibody. Stocks of human or of more readily available simian antisera should be held in laboratories where such animals are used...|$|R
40|$|A {{collaborative}} study was undertdken {{to assess the}} suitability of a polyvalent mti-dengue virus 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 s ew and 4 monovalent prepaations, mti-dengue virus types l, 2, 3 and 4, to serve as International Standads. Thirteen participants in 6 countries {{took part in the}} study which was divided into two phase: In the first phase participants were sent coded samples which incIuded a duplicate sample of the candidate standad and a negative control. They also received Vero cells and 4 dengue virus serotypes. In the second phase, participants assayed uncoded smples using the method, cells and viruses in routine use in their laboratory. Data from a total of 32 assays on each of the 4 dengue virus serotypes were analysed. 50 % Plaque reduction <b>neutralisation</b> <b>titres</b> were calculated for each smple when assayed against each virus and potencies relative to the candidate standard for results which were expected to be reactive...|$|R
40|$|Fifty {{patients}} with congestive cardiomyopathy {{have been studied}} for evidence of previous Coxsackie B virus infection and compared with age- and sex-matched controls who had been admitted to hospital for investigation of other cardiac diseases. High <b>neutralisation</b> <b>titres</b> (greater {{than or equal to}} 1024) to Coxsackie B viruses were more common among the controls. On subdividing the patients according to their length of symptomatic history before study, high titres were more common only in those with a short history (less than or equal to 1 year). High titres were more common when there had been a febrile illness at the onset of symptoms. Endomyocardial biopsies of 18 patients disclosed no evidence of myocarditis, or, in 12 cases, of viral involvement. Although the evidence remains circumstantial, these results support the theory that Coxsackie B viruses may cause congestive cardiomyopathy and encourage further research into the mechanisms of myocardial cell damage by these visuses...|$|R
40|$|Foot-and-mouth disease {{remains a}} major plague of {{livestock}} and outbreaks are often economically catastrophic. Current inactivated virus vaccines require expensive high containment facilities for their production {{and maintenance of}} a cold-chain for their activity. We have addressed both of these major drawbacks. Firstly we have developed methods to efficiently express recombinant empty capsids. Expression constructs aimed at lowering the levels and activity of the viral protease required for the cleavage of the capsid protein precursor were used; this enabled the synthesis of empty A-serotype capsids in eukaryotic cells at levels potentially attractive to industry using both vaccinia virus and baculovirus driven expression. Secondly we have enhanced capsid stability by incorporating a rationally designed mutation, and shown by X-ray crystallography that stabilised and wild-type empty capsids have essentially the same structure as intact virus. Cattle vaccinated with recombinant capsids showed sustained virus <b>neutralisation</b> <b>titres</b> and protection from challenge 34 weeks after immunization. This approach to vaccine antigen production has several potential advantages over current technologies by reducing production costs, eliminating the risk of infectivity and enhancing the temperature stability of the product. Similar strategies that will optimize host cell viability during expression of a foreign toxic gene and/or improv...|$|R
40|$|We have {{developed}} retroviral vectors {{that can be}} used in neutralisation assays to determine antibody titres for biohazard level 3 / 4 pathogens. This assay has two advantages over existing methods: (1) Retroviral pseudotypes can be handled in biohazard level 2 laboratories; (2) The use of either green fluorescent protein, luciferase or ?-galactosidase as a reporter allows the assay to be used at low cost in laboratories throughout the world. G-protein sequences from CVS- 11, EBLV- 1, EBLV- 2 and a human street genotype- 1 virus (RV 61) cDNA were cloned and co-expressed along with HIV/MLV gag-pol and a GFP or luciferase in human 293 T cells. The resulting pseudotyped viruses were able to infect a number of target cells and, with the exception of RV 61, produced viral titres similar to the well characterised Vesicular Stomatitis Virus pseudotype. Using blinded sera, <b>neutralisation</b> <b>titres</b> were comparable to those using OIEâ€™s gold standard fluorescent antibody virus neutralisation test and assays also revealed cross-neutralisation of EBLV- 1, EBLV- 2 and CVS- 11. This development of an inexpensive and robust high-throughput microassay for the measurement of rabies virus neutralising antibodies in animal and human serum samples will be widely applicable for use in wildlife vaccine campaigns and in human post-vaccination antibody monitoring...|$|R
40|$|Dengue virus (DENV) {{infection}} {{is a major}} emerging disease widely distributed throughout the tropical and subtropical {{regions of the world}} affecting several millions of people. Despite constants efforts, no specific treatment or effective vaccine is yet available. Here we show a novel design of a DNA immunisation strategy that resulted in the induction of strong antibody responses with high <b>neutralisation</b> <b>titres</b> in mice against all four viral serotypes. The immunogenic molecule is an engineered version of the domain III (DIII) of the virus E protein fused to the dimerising CH 3 domain of the IgG immunoglobulin H chain. The DIII sequences were also codon-optimised for expression in mammalian cells. While DIII alone is very poorly secreted, the codon-optimised fusion protein is rightly expressed, folded and secreted at high levels, thus inducing strong antibody responses. Mice were immunised using gene-gun technology, an efficient way of intradermal delivery of the plasmid DNA, and the vaccine was able to induce neutralising titres against all serotypes. Additionally, all sera showed reactivity to a recombinant DIII version and the recombinant E protein produced and secreted from mammalian cells in a mono-biotinylated form when tested in a conformational ELISA. Sera were also highly reactive to infective viral particles in a virus-capture ELISA and specific for each serotype as revealed by the low cross-reactive and cross-neutralising activities. The serotype specific sera did not induce antibody dependent enhancement of infection (ADE) in non-homologous virus serotypes. A tetravalent immunisation protocol in mice showed induction of neutralising antibodies against all four dengue serotypes as well...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, {{evolutionary}} {{models are}} developed for protein coding sequences {{of the human}} immunodeficiency virus (HIV). These models are applied to predict the epitopes targeted by the cell-mediated and humoral arms of the immune response, and to study the natural selection of escape variants. The first phylogenetic model that allows the codon substitution rates to depend on an arbitrary environmental variable is developed. The model is used to identify sequence positions in HIV Gag that correlate with the human leukocyte antigen genotype of the host across a phylogeny. This model is integrated with a hidden Markov model to accurately predict T cell epitopes using both evolutionary and sequence-based information. The evolutionary model is subsequently extended to identify sites in the HIV envelope that are targeted by broadly neutralising antibodies. In particular, the model is adapted to allow the distribution of amino acids at each site to depend on <b>neutralisation</b> <b>titres</b> measured for a panel of viruses. Conformational B cell epitopes are successfully identified with a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm that searches the tertiary envelope structure for three-dimensional clusters of sites that collectively influence neutralisation sensitivity. After considering HIV adaptation at the host population level, the focus then shifts to viral evolution within a host. The characteristics of transmitted viral variants are examined by analysing the breakthrough sequences from 96 monkeys experimentally infected with the simian immunodeficiency virus. Sieve analyses are performed to determine whether certain viral variants {{were more likely to}} establish infection in monkeys that received a vaccine compared to those that did not. Finally, a maximum likelihood method is developed to estimate the population genetics parameters of HIV escape mutants from longitudinal sequence data. In contrast to previous approaches, this method permits strong selection and frequent mutation, as might be expected of intra-host HIV populations...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: US {{government}} organisations {{have identified}} {{the need for a}} new smallpox vaccine to replenish limited stocks of the approved, calf-lymph derived vaccine, the manufacture of which is no longer acceptable. We aimed to compare the safety and immunogenicity of the new cell-cultured smallpox vaccine (CCSV) to that of the calf-lymph derived vaccine (as a positive control) in 350 healthy, adult volunteers. METHODS: We did a randomised controlled study at the University of Kentucky Medical Center. We randomised 150 vaccinia-naive volunteers, aged 18 - 30 years, and 100 vaccinia-non-naive people, aged 32 - 65 years, to equivalent doses of either CCSV or test vaccine (2. 5 x 10 (5) plaque-forming units) by 15 puncture scarification in double-blind fashion. Immunogenicity was assessed by pock formation (take rate), humoral immune response by plaque-reduction <b>neutralisation</b> <b>titres,</b> and cellular immune response by vaccinia-specific, interferon-gamma T-cell quantification, cytotoxicity, and T-cell proliferation response. A further 100 vaccine-naive individuals, aged 18 - 30 years, received one of five doses of CCSV (undiluted, diluted 1 in 5, 1 in 10, 1 in 25, and 1 in 50) in single-blind fashion. Routine laboratory assessments, physical examinations, and recording of adverse events were done to assess vaccine safety. The primary endpoints were safety and reactogenicity (take rate) of CCSV. FINDINGS: 349 (99. 7 %) of 350 volunteers developed pock lesions; one vaccinia-naive individual who received a 1 in 25 dilution of CCSV did not. The rate of adverse events related to vaccine and the extent of humoral and cellular immune responses did not differ between the vaccine groups in vaccinia-naive or non-naive people. CCSV was immunogenic in vaccine-naive volunteers at a dose 50 times lower than that approved for Dryvax. INTERPRETATION: CCSV seems to be a safe and immunogenic alternative to calf-lymph derived vaccine for both vaccinia-naive and non-naive people...|$|R
40|$|The {{immunity}} {{of a host}} population against specific influenza A strains {{can influence}} {{a number of important}} biological processes, from the emergence of new virus strains to the effectiveness of vaccination programmes. However, the development of an individual's long-lived antibody response to influenza A {{over the course of a}} lifetime remains poorly understood. Accurately describing this immunological process requires a fundamental understanding of how the mechanisms of boosting and cross-reactivity respond to repeated infections. Establishing the contribution of such mechanisms to antibody titres remains challenging because the aggregate effect of immune responses over a lifetime are rarely observed directly. To uncover the aggregate effect of multiple influenza infections, we developed a mechanistic model capturing both past infections and subsequent antibody responses. We estimated parameters of the model using cross-sectional antibody titres to nine different strains spanning 40 years of circulation of influenza A(H 3 N 2) in southern China. We found that "antigenic seniority" and quickly decaying cross-reactivity were important components of the immune response, suggesting that the order in which individuals were infected with influenza strains shaped observed <b>neutralisation</b> <b>titres</b> to a particular virus. We also obtained estimates of the frequency and age distribution of influenza infection, which indicate that although infections became less frequent as individuals progressed through childhood and young adulthood, they occurred at similar rates for individuals above age 30 y. By establishing what are likely to be important mechanisms driving epochal trends in population immunity, we also identified key directions for future studies. In particular, our results highlight the need for longitudinal samples that are tested against multiple historical strains. This could lead to a better understanding of how, over the course of a lifetime, fast, transient antibody dynamics combine with the longer-term immune responses considered here. published_or_final_versio...|$|R
40|$|Background: Severe {{respiratory}} syncytial virus (RSV) disease occurs predominantly {{in children}} under 6 months of age. There is no licensed RSV vaccine. Protection of young infants could be achieved by a maternal vaccine to boost titres of passively transferred protective antibodies. Data on the level and kinetics of functional RSV-specific antibody at birth and over the early infant period would inform vaccine product design. Methods: From a birth cohort study (2002 â€“ 2007) in Kilifi, Kenya, 100 participants were randomly selected for whom cord blood and 2 subsequent 3 -monthly blood samples within {{the first year of}} life, were available. RSV antibodies against the A 2 strain of RSV were assayed and recorded as the logarithm (base 2) plaque reduction <b>neutralisation</b> test (PRNT) <b>titre.</b> Analysis by linear regression accounted for within-person clustering. Results: The geometric mean <b>neutralisation</b> antibody <b>titre</b> was 10. 6 (SD: 1. 13) at birth with a log-linear decay over the first 6 months of life. The estimated rate of decay was âˆ’ 0. 58 (SD: 0. 20) log 2 PRNT titre per month and a half-life of 36 days. There was no significant interaction between cord titre and rate of decay with age. Mean cord titres rose and fell in a pattern temporally tracking community virus transmission. Conclusions: In this study population, RSV neutralising antibody titres decay approximately two-fold every one month. The rate of decay varies widely by individual but is not related to titre at birth. RSV specific cord titres vary seasonally, presumably due to maternal boosting...|$|R
40|$|SummaryBackgroundIdentification of {{mechanisms}} that limit poliovirus replication {{is crucial for}} informing decisions aimed at global polio eradication. Studies of mucosal immunity induced by oral poliovirus (OPV) or inactivated poliovirus (IPV) vaccines and mixed schedules thereof will determine the effectiveness of different vaccine strategies to block virus shedding. We used samples from a clinical trial of different vaccination schedules to measure intestinal immunity as judged by neutralisation of virus and virus-specific IgA in stools. MethodsIn the FIDEC trial, Latin American infants {{were randomly assigned to}} nine groups to assess the efficacy of two schedules of bivalent OPV (bOPV) and IPV and challenge with monovalent type 2 OPV, and stools samples were collected. We selected three groups of particular interestâ€”the bOPV control group (serotypes 1 and 3 at 6, 10, and 14 weeks), the trivalent attenuated OPV (tOPV) control group (tOPV at 6, 10, and 14 weeks), and the bOPVâ€“IPV group (bOPV at 6, 10, and 14 weeks plus IPV at 14 weeks). Neutralising activity and poliovirus type-specific IgA were measured in stool after a monovalent OPV type 2 challenge at 18 weeks of age. Mucosal immunity was measured by in-vitro neutralisation of a type 2 polio pseudovirus (PV 2). <b>Neutralisation</b> <b>titres</b> and total and poliovirus-type-specific IgG and IgA concentrations in stools were assessed in samples collected before challenge and 2 weeks after challenge from all participants. Findings 210 infants from Guatemala and Dominican Republic were included in this analysis. Of 38 infants tested for mucosal antibody in the tOPV group, two were shedding virus 1 week after challenge, compared with 59 of 85 infants receiving bOPV (p< 0 Â· 0001) and 53 of 87 infants receiving bOPVâ€“IPV (p< 0 Â· 0001). Mucosal type 2 neutralisation and type-specific IgA were noted primarily in response to tOPV. An inverse correlation was noted between virus shedding and both serum type 2 neutralisation at challenge (p< 0 Â· 0001) and mucosal type 2 neutralisation at challenge (p< 0 Â· 0001). InterpretationMucosal type- 2 -specific antibodies can be measured in stool and develop in response to receipt of OPV type 2 either in the primary vaccine series or at challenge. These mucosal antibodies influence the amount of virus that is shed in an established infection. FundingBill & Melinda Gates Foundation...|$|R
40|$|Enveloped viruses {{have a great}} {{advantage}} comparedto the non-enveloped viruses due to theirability to acquire not only a host membrane butalso host-specific glycosylation of their surfaceglycoproteins. These carbohydrate structures,mainly of the N-linked glycan class, have a lowimmunogenicity and this feature enables envelopedviruses to {{keep a low profile}} towards theimmune system by shielding crucial epitopesfrom antibody recognition. This phenomenonconstitutes hurdles for development of vaccinesand therapies targeting highly glycosylated virusesincluding HIV and Hantaan virus. The aimsof the present work were to identify specific Nlinkedglycans that are especially active in thisvirus-shielding process and develop DNA vaccinesand therapeutic vectors to the two virusesmentioned. An N-linked glycan attached to N 306 in the V 3 loop of the HIV- 1 gp 120 is involved in protectingthe virus from antibodies. A DNA vaccinewas created, where this particular glycosylationsite was eliminated using site-directed mutagenesis. Mice were immunised intranasally withthe mutant and a wild type vaccine, and theimmune responses were analysed. The protocolincluded an analysis of animals immunised withDNA only and also those given a protein boost. The mutant DNA followed by protein boostinduced a significantly higher IgG response togp 120 as measured by ELISA. Both DNA vaccinesinduced similar levels of HIV-neutralisingantibodies in serum. The IgA response was analysedboth for BAL and faeces specimens. SecretedIgA was induced by both DNA vaccinesbut protein boost was required to obtain virusneutralisingantibodies. Attempts were made to construct an adenovirusvector, with receptor specificity retargeted togp 120 of the HIV-infected cell surface. To obtaina suitable affinity module for gp 120 a combinatorialprotein library of 108 members, based onthe 58 amino acid residue staphylococcal proteinA (Affibody), was screened against gp 120. The selected affibody (zg 120) and its bivalentform had Kd- values of 100 nM and 10 nM,respectively, towards gp 120. The affibody constructswere introduced to the adenovirus 5 fibregene, and the recombinant fibres bound selectivelyto gp 120 in a biosensor analysis and togp 160, transiently expressed in GMK cells. Thesuccessful selection of a gp 120 -binding affibodyligand indicates that future affibody-basedstrategies might evolve to complement antibodybasedefforts for HIV- 1 therapy. The same strategy as described above for HIV- 1 was also applied to develop a DNA vaccine toHantaan virus glycoproteins. All six potentialglycosylation sites (N 1 -N 6) of the two Hantaanvirus glycoproteins G 1 and G 2 were eliminatedand expressed as single mutations in a DNAvaccine. Mice were immunized by Gene Gunwith these constructs. One mutated DNA vaccineconstruct, N 6, was found to induce equallyhigh <b>neutralisation</b> <b>titres</b> as did the wild typeDNA vaccine. However, the mutant but not thewild type DNA vaccine was able to induce partialprotection against Hantaan virus challenge. In conclusion, manipulation of glycosylationsites of viral glycoprotein genes is still open as aroad to an improved DNA vaccine capable ofeliciting high titres of broadly neutralising antibodies,but it is clear that there are still obstaclesto be overcome...|$|R
