5|$|A. V. M. Rajan portrayed Shanmugasundaram's brother Thangarathnam. According to playwright Crazy Mohan, Gopulu's {{caricature}} {{of the character}} Vaithi in Subbu's novel was similar to Nagesh, who portrayed Vaithi in the film. Manorama played the wildly expressive, loud-talking but tender-hearted folk dancer Karuppayi, who has to contend with living under the shadows of landlords; she changes her identity every <b>now</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>to</b> escape from them. In an interview with Maalai Malar, Manorama stated that she was initially nervous acting in front of Ganesan and Balaiah, but Nagarajan assured her that whenever her character appeared {{she would be the}} centre of attention, which gave her the confidence to play her role. Serial and theatre artist M. L. Bhanumathi played the nurse who treats Shanmugasundaram. Other supporting actors included K. Sarangkapani, S. Ramarao, M. K. Murthy, Balusundaram, T. N. Sivadhanu, S. R. Dasarathan, Sivasooriyan, Senthamarai, Kallapart Natarajan, Gundu Karuppaiah, Chandranbabu, S. V. Rajagopal, A. M. Maruthappa, Udayachandrika, Ambika and Kalpalatha.|$|E

25|$|Although mostly nocturnal, {{they are}} {{occasionally}} active during the day. However, like deer, bongos may exhibit crepuscular behaviour. Bongos are both timid and easily frightened; after a scare, a bongo moves away at considerable speed, even through dense undergrowth. Once they find cover, they stay alert and face {{away from the}} disturbance, but peek every <b>now</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>to</b> check the situation. The bongo's hindquarters are less conspicuous than the forequarters, and from this position the animal can quickly flee.|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} co-written by co-showrunners J.H. Wyman and Jeff Pinkner, and {{consulting}} producer Akiva Goldsman. Executive producer Joe Chappelle directed. Pinkner and Wyman approached the episode [...] "like a new pilot" [...] {{to draw in}} viewers who wanted to watch the show but did not know when to start. They used Lincoln Lee {{as a tool to}} acquaint viewers with the new changes. Former guest actor Seth Gabel, who played Lee, joined the cast as a series regular for the fourth season. He believed his character allowed the audience to see Fringe Division from a new perspective. He explained, [...] "You need a layman's perspective from time to time. The show has gotten so deep into this crazy, surreal scientific world that you need someone to enter every <b>now</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>to</b> remind you this is not the common experience. You need someone to show you how far down the rabbit hole youâ€™ve gone, so you don't become desensitized to it. I think Lincoln serves that for a while." ...|$|E

He wrote {{that it had}} the same problems that Bart vs. the Space Mutants had, such as [...] "lousy jumping physics", and that it [...] "also manages to strip away the novelty that made the original Simpsons NES game worth checking {{out in the first}} place. The sequel is a straight-up, cookie-cutter platformer without any real Simpson-y touches to satisfy fans of the show; Bart finds himself wandering through generic side-scrolling levels, with a Simpsons character showing up every <b>now</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>to</b> remind you that this is an actual licensed product and not just a ROM hack." ...|$|E
2500|$|Philip Stewart Robinson was a {{traveling}} journalist for the Telegraph of London. [...] In his [...] "Sinners and Saints", he notes [...] "I {{had expected to}} see men with long whips, sitting on fences, swearing at their gangs of wives {{at work in the}} fields. I expected every <b>now</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>to</b> hear of druniken saints beating seven or eight wives all at once," [...] but found no such thing. [...] While continuing to disagree with the practice of polygamy, he found that Utah-born girls, the offspring of plural wives, have figures that would make Paris envious; and they carry themselves with almost oriental dignity. There is nothing, so far as I have seen, in the manners of Salt Lake City to make me suspect the existence of that licentiousness of which so much has been written. He believed that the negative representations of Mormons came universally [...] "rom anti-Mormons only".|$|E

The episode then flashes back to the guerilla concert held by the top 22 girls, where they performed their songs from the concept evaluation and eliminated trainee, Show Works' Hwang In-sun, acted as the MC.
