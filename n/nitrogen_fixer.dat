40|$|Nitrogen {{fixation}} is {{no longer}} {{considered to be a}} minor factor of the nitrogen cycle in oceanic ecosystems. Recent geochemical and biological efforts have led to {{a significant increase in the}} estimated input of nitrogen to marine ecosystems by biological fixation, while molecular studies have increased our knowledge of the number and diversity of <b>nitrogen</b> <b>fixers</b> known to be active in the ocean. Although Trichodesmium spp. have long been viewed as the primary marine <b>nitrogen</b> <b>fixers,</b> recent efforts have shown that various members of the picoplankton community are also actively involved in nitrogen fixation. The relative abundance of different <b>nitrogen</b> <b>fixers</b> is an important ecosystem parameter since <b>nitrogen</b> <b>fixers</b> may differ significantly in their physiology, life history and ecology. Here we combine rate measurements and stable isotope natural abundance measurements to constrain the impact of N 2 fixation in the waters north of Australia. Samples were collected in the Coral, Arafura, and East Timor Seas, thus spanning three distinct hydrographic regions. Our data show that Trichodesmium has a significant influence on the stable nitrogen isotope ratios of particulate and zooplankton biomass and suggest that Trichodesmium is a significant source of nitrogen for the pelagic ecosystem. Based on stable carbon isotope ratios, it is also likely that the pathways are indirect and nitrogen fixed by Trichodesmium enters the higher trophic levels via decomposition as dissolved organic and inorganic nitrogen. Picocyanobacteria showed high diazotrophic activity at some stations, but unlike Trichodesmium, their N 2 fixation rate was not reflected in the stable N isotope ratios of particulate and zooplankton biomass. Our results suggest an important N contribution to biomass by diazotrophs in the Coral Sea, Arafura Sea and East Timor Sea. M. S.

50|$|Scotch broom out-competes {{the host}} plants of this {{butterfly}} species {{and as a}} <b>nitrogen</b> <b>fixer</b> it alters the natural nutrient balance in the soils. Because many prairie species, such as their host plant, the lupine (Lupinus lepidus), have adapted to thrive on much lower nutrient levels the increased nutrient loading greatly inhibits the lupines ability to thrive. The subalpine populations have increased as logging activities have cleared land allowing the expansion of their host plant the lupine. The biggest threat to the subalpine populations is climate change, while the prairie populations are most threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation. Land management techniques used to maintain prairies such as controlled burns, can either help or hurt populations of native butterflies. If timed correctly controlled burns can greatly increase that year's lupine crop, giving the Puget blue {{a better chance of}} success.|$|E
50|$|The {{leaves are}} {{opposite}} or in whorls, simple, 2-9 cm long, without stipules. The flowers are borne in racemes 2-30 cm long, each flower small, greenish, with five small petals. The fruit {{is a small}} and shiny black (occasionally yellow or red) berry-like swollen corolla, highly poisonous in several species, though those of C. terminalis are edible. At least {{a few members of}} this genus are non-legume <b>nitrogen</b> <b>fixers.</b>|$|R
50|$|Many {{mechanistic}} {{aspects of}} catalysis remain unknown. No crystallographic analysis {{has been reported}} on substrate bound to nitrogenase. One {{problem is that the}} enzyme is generally obtained as a mixture of states. Nitrogenase is able to reduce acetylene, but is inhibited by carbon monoxide, which binds to the enzyme and thereby prevents binding of dinitrogen. Dinitrogen prevent acetylene binding, but acetylene does not inhibit binding of dinitrogen and requires only one electron for reduction to ethylene. Due to the oxidative properties of oxygen, most nitrogenases are irreversibly inhibited by dioxygen, which degradatively oxidizes the Fe-S cofactors. This requires mechanisms for <b>nitrogen</b> <b>fixers</b> to protect nitrogenase from oxygen in vivo. Despite this problem, many use oxygen as a terminal electron acceptor for respiration. Although the ability of some <b>nitrogen</b> <b>fixers</b> such as Azotobacteraceae to employ an oxygen-labile nitrogenase under aerobic conditions has been attributed to a high metabolic rate, allowing oxygen reduction at the cell membrane, the effectiveness of such a mechanism has been questioned at oxygen concentrations above 70 µM (ambient concentration is 230 µM O2), as well as during additional nutrient limitations.|$|R
50|$|II) The N:P in {{seawater}} “must tend {{to approach}} that characteristic of protoplasm in general” (Redfield 1934). Furthermore, Redfield proposed thermostat like {{scenario in which}} the activities of <b>nitrogen</b> <b>fixers</b> and denitrifies keep the nitrate to phosphate ratio in the seawater near the requirements in the protoplasm. Considering {{that at the time}} little was known about the composition of “protoplasm,” Redfield did not attempt to explain why its N:P ratio should be approximately 16:1.|$|R
50|$|One of the {{essential}} limiting nutrients in a healthy forest is Nitrogen. Nitrogen is a limiting resource in a forest because not all plants can utilize the Nitrogen that is floating in the air around them. Nitrogen is originally a gas in its elemental form {{making it impossible for}} many plant species to absorb the key benefits of nitrogen. Feather moss such as Lanky Moss is not a <b>nitrogen</b> <b>fixer,</b> which means it does not have the capabilities to absorb and retain the nitrogen that is in the air. Even though Rhytidiadelphus loreaus is not a <b>nitrogen</b> <b>fixer</b> it still helps keep the forest healthy and in balance. Lanky Moss can serve as an insulator, nutrition sponge and a water filtration system that circulates throughout the forest. As an insulator it can protect the possibly weak or shallow root systems of trees by insulating them from extreme changes in temperature. It there was no insulation then many of the trees growing at colder latitude could not survive the harsh winter months. The insulation of Lanky Moss prevents the roots from freezing if there is an unexpected drop in temperature. They can also help retain moisture in the soil so if there is a dry season in the forest they can help keep the trees and other plant species hydrated. Aside from water retention they can also hold large levels of nutrients. As rain percolates through the forest’s canopy, nutrients such as nitrogen flows off with the water and is immediately absorbed by the Lanky Moss that is growing on the forest floor. Moss such as Lanky Moss is a crucial component in primary successional success. After a major disturbance such as a fire or glacial advancement, moss and lichen are initial species in the regrowth of vegetation. Since other feather mosses unlike Rhytidiadelphus loreaus are capable of nitrogen fixation they are able to facilitate growth of other species because they can introduce a crucial nutrient into the growing forest.|$|E
50|$|In {{most cases}} {{trellising}} net {{made out of}} stretched polypropylene is re-usable, and will last many crop cycles. The ideal technique to fully maximize the investment in the agricultural implements from the first cycle, and to amortize this cost over many crops (mulching, irrigation, posts, cables, filters, netting), is to alternate a cycle of solanaceae or cucurbitaceae with one of leguminous or some other <b>nitrogen</b> <b>fixer.</b> Giving for granted that during the previous cycle {{there had been a}} good phytosanitary management, and that there are no harmful colonies of pests to the next crop, once may proceed—after the last fruits are harvested—with cutting the old plant still on the tutor net, and while the old plant dries up one may place the seed of the next crop (or wait a few days and transplant directly what comes from the nursery once the old plant matter is removed from the trellis). In a few days the old plant can be easily removed and re-incorporated into the soil.|$|E
5000|$|A {{change of}} {{emphasis}} in the research remit of MRE led to his resignation and in 1963 he was Appointed Assistant Director of the Agricultural Research Council's newly formed multidisciplinary Unit of Nitrogen Fixation (UNF), with the chemist Professor Joseph Chatt FRS as Director. Postgate's job was to plan and direct its biological research programme. The Unit settled at the University of Sussex in late 1964, and in 1965 the University appointed Postgate Professor of Microbiology {{in addition to his}} UNF position, with only postgraduate teaching duties. [...] The Unit's biological research was restricted to free-living nitrogen fixers, chosen as more amenable material for its research than those requiring a plant symbiosis. Its approach ranged from biochemical enzymology to microbial physiology and general microbiology, and in due course it introduced the genetics, and was genuinely collaborative, with everyone, including Postgate, working at the bench. Almost all its research publications were multi-authored and Postgate's name appeared only on those original papers to which he had actively contributed - though he prescribed and oversaw all his staff's research directions. Outstanding papers were: a series deducing mode of action of nitrogenase, the enzyme responsible for the initial attack of nitrogen, which is an oxygen-sensitive complex of two proteins, iron and molybdenum, which requires energy in the form of Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to function and which releases hydrogen from water while fixing nitrogen; the elucidation of oxygen-screening processes in an oxygen-tolerant species of <b>nitrogen</b> <b>fixer</b> and the discovery in that microbe of a second nitrogenase containing vanadium in place of molybdenum alongside the regular one; the elucidation of a cluster of some 21 genes which code for the whole nitrogen-fixing system, the creation of mobile genetic elements carrying that cluster and the transfer therewith of the ability to fix nitrogen to wholly new bacteria by genetic manipulation. [...] One of the Unit's plasmids came into worldwide use to study the genetics of nitrogen fixation. The Unit's reputation prospered as a world centre for basic research on the subject.|$|E

40|$|In the {{oligotrophic}} {{waters to}} the east of Madagascar a large phytoplankton bloom is found to occur in late austral summer. This bloom is composed of <b>nitrogen</b> <b>fixers</b> and can cover up to ? 1 % of the world's ocean surface area. Satellite observations show that its spatial structure is closely tied to the underlying mesoscale eddy field in the region. The causes of the bloom and its temporal behavior (timing of its initiation and termination) and spatial variability are poorly understood, in part {{due to a lack of}} in situ observations. Here an eddy resolving 1 / 12 ? resolution ocean general circulation model and Lagrangian particle tracking are used to examine the hypothesis that iron from sediments around Madagascar could be advected east by the mesoscale eddy field to fertilize the bloom, and that variability in advection could explain the significant interannual variability in the spatial extent of the bloom. The model results suggest that this is indeed possible and furthermore imply that the bloom could be triggered by warming of the mixed layer, leading to optimal conditions for <b>nitrogen</b> <b>fixers</b> to grow, while its termination could be due to iron exhaustion. It is found that advection of Madagascan iron could re-supply the bloom region with this micronutrient in the period between the termination of one bloom and the initiation of the next in the following year...|$|R
40|$|Six {{laboratory}} experiments {{were carried out}} to investigate {{the effect of the}} fungicide Benomyl on pure cultures of some plant growth promoting bacteria (PGPB) and some fungi. The highest LD 50 was recorded for Bacillus circulans and proved to be the most resistant to the fungicide, followed by Azospirillum braziliense, while Penicillium sp. was the most affected microorganism. LD 50 values for the affected microorganisms were in 21 - 240 orders of magnitude lower in comparison with the LD 50 value for Azospirillum braziliense. The results indicate a strong selectivity for Benomyl against Rhizobium meliloti and Penicillium sp. when compared to other microorganisms tested. The highest safety coefficient was recorded for Bacillus circulans followed by Azospirillum braziliense, while Rhizobium meliloti, showed the lowest safety coefficient value compared to other bacteria. The lowest toxicity index was recorded for Bacillus circulans and Azospirillum braziliense. The slope of the curves for Bacillus sp. and Rhizobium meliloti was steeper than that of the other curves, suggesting that even a slight increase of the dose of the fungicide can cause a very strong negative effect. In conclusion, Benomyl could be applied without restriction when using inocula based on growth promoting bacteria such as symbiotic <b>nitrogen</b> <b>fixers</b> (Rhizobium meliloti), non-symbiotic <b>nitrogen</b> <b>fixers</b> (Azospirillum braziliense) or potassium solibilizers (Bacillus circulans), given that the fungicide is applied within the range of the recommended field dose...|$|R
