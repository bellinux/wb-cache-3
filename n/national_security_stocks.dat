40|$|South Sudan faces serious {{problems}} of food insecurity due to low per capita levels of domestic food production, periodic droughts, widespread poverty, political unrest, and since late 2013, renewed armed conflict. Agricultural productivity is low, {{and the country}} is highly dependent on private-sector imports of cereals (maize, sorghum, wheat, and rice) from Uganda to supply domestic markets. National household survey data indicate substantial diversity in consumption of cereals across households, and our econometric estimates suggest highly price- and income-inelastic demand for the two major cereals, sorghum and maize. Drawing on a review of international experience and the constraints facing South Sudan, we conclude that a <b>national</b> food <b>security</b> reserve (NFSR) system with a small <b>national</b> food <b>security</b> <b>stock</b> is feasible for South Sudan. Cereal stocks would be kept mainly for targeted safety nets and emergency distribution, and market interventions would be limited in scope, in keeping with a long-run goal of market development. Nonetheless, even with a functioning NFSR, promotion of private-sector domestic and import trade will remain crucial for ensuring adequate supplies of grain and food securityDiscussion paperNon-PRIFPRI 1; E Building Resilience; C Improving markets and trade; CRP 2; Strategic Food ReserveDSGD; MTID; PIMCGIAR Research Program on Policies, Institutions, and Markets (PIM...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{outlines}} {{the development of}} a new science and technology (S&T) policy for <b>national</b> <b>security,</b> and invites submissions. Introduction The Hon Stuart Robert MP, Assistant Minister for Defence is championing {{the development of a}} new framework for achieving a whole-of-government approach to <b>national</b> <b>security</b> science and technology (S&T). The framework will comprise a <b>national</b> <b>security</b> S&T policy statement and supporting Program. The intention is to transition from poorly coordinated and under-resourced S&T effort to a collaborative co-investment approach between government, academia and industry that effectively and efficiently delivers innovative S&T solutions in priority <b>national</b> <b>security</b> areas for Australia. The Defence Science and Technology Organisation (DSTO) is responsible for leading and coordinating <b>national</b> <b>security</b> S&T, a role transferred from the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet to the Department of Defence in February 2012. As part of that role, DSTO is leading {{the development of a new}} policy and supporting program in consultation with the <b>national</b> <b>security</b> S&T communities, for consideration and endorsement by Government in 2014. The <b>national</b> <b>security</b> S&T policy will: 	enunciate the Government’s priorities for <b>national</b> <b>security</b> S&T, 	provide a means by which S&T investment can be balanced to support short-term <b>national</b> <b>security</b> operational needs in addition to enduring security challenges, 	establish an efficient management and governance framework that delivers S&T outcomes to <b>national</b> <b>security</b> agencies, and 	encourage shared public and private investment in <b>national</b> <b>security</b> S&T, and facilitate commercialisation of research outcomes for national benefit. The policy will be delivered through a coherent and coordinated <b>national</b> <b>security</b> S&T program that address <b>national</b> <b>security</b> S&T priorities and delivers real tangible outcomes for <b>national</b> <b>security</b> users. The <b>national</b> <b>security</b> S&T policy and supporting program will harness S&T providers, including publicly funded research agencies (PFRAs), universities and industry to benefit <b>national</b> <b>security</b> ‘user’ agencies, including policy agencies, regulators, emergency response agencies, policing and law enforcement agencies, border protection agencies and the intelligence community. This paper aims to promote discussion and elicit input from government agencies and the S&T community that will assist in developing a <b>national</b> <b>security</b> S&T policy and program that will improve the delivery and application of S&T to address Australia’s <b>national</b> <b>security</b> challenges now and into the future.   Find out more about making a submission her...|$|R
