At the same time Vitellius and his armies in Germania had risen in revolt and prepared to march on Rome, intent on overthrowing Otho. <b>Not</b> <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> risk being taken hostage by {{one side or the}} other, Titus abandoned the journey to Rome and rejoined his father in Judaea.|$|E
5|$|In the United Kingdom, The Scout Association {{had been}} criticised for its {{insistence on the}} use of a {{religious}} promise, leading to the introduction of an alternative in January 2014 for those <b>not</b> <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> mention a god in their promise.

5|$|Not all Texans favored secession initially, {{although}} many of the same would later support the Southern cause. Texas's most notable Unionist was the state Governor, Sam Houston. <b>Not</b> <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> aggravate the situation, Houston refused two offers from President Lincoln for Union troops to keep him in office. After refusing to swear an oath of allegiance to the Confederacy, Houston was deposed as governor.|$|E

5|$|The British were {{welcomed by}} the {{remaining}} New York City population, pulling down the Continental Army flag {{and raising the}} Union Flag.

5|$|When casting for {{the role}} of Dorothy, Warner Bros. {{declined}} to audition any actresses younger than the age of 30; Jennifer O'Neill's agent, who had developed a fondness for the script, convinced the studio to audition his client, who was only 22 at the time. O'Neill auditioned {{for the role}}, albeit hesitantly, <b>not</b> <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> perform any nude scenes.

However, after the Franco-Spanish defeat in the Battle of Trafalgar, John grew bold and officially resumed diplomatic and trade relations with Britain.|$|E
5|$|Although Dark Horse had {{approved}} 36 issues, {{there was still}} a chance the book could sell poorly and receive an early cancellation. The decision would be made after receiving the final sales number for the third issue, meaning Kindt was only guaranteed six issues. <b>Not</b> <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> risk the series being cut off {{in the middle of a}} story, he designed the first six issues to stand alone if necessary. Kindt pencilled two endings for the last page of issue six so he would be prepared either way.|$|E
5|$|As Jesus vs. Santa {{became more}} popular, Parker and Stone began talks of {{developing}} the short into a television series.

The two then entered negotiations with both MTV and Comedy Central. Parker preferred the show be produced by Comedy Central, fearing that MTV would turn it into a kids show.

5|$|In the meantime, Miller {{earned the}} further ire of his CO by flying {{unauthorised}} leisure flights. <b>Not</b> <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> fly tour flights over Germany, Miller lodged bogus reports {{saying that the}} Mosquitoes were malfunctioning, causing unnecessary maintenance work.
