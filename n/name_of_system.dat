The tool is accessible through THESEUS, a web-based antifraud resource developed by the JRC to disseminate patterns and fair prices detected or estimated using international trade data. THESEUS is accessible only by authorized users in the Commission and Member States (customs and low enforcement services). On the other hand the user community of HERMES is potentially wider, pointing to international traders and other economic operators. For this reason, HERMES may be moved to the public area of THESEUS. JRC. I. 3 -Text and Data Minin...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we develop}} {{a system of}} typed lambda-calculus for the Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory, in the {{framework}} of classical logic. The first, and the simplest system of typed lambda-calculus is the system of simple types, which uses the intuitionistic propositional calculus, with the only connective #. It is very important, because the well known Curry-Howard correspondence between proofs and programs was originally discovered with it, and because it enjoys the normalization property : every typed term is strongly normalizable. It was extended to second order intuitionistic logic, in 1970, by J. -Y. Girard[4], under the <b>name</b> <b>of</b> <b>system</b> F, still with the normalization property. More recently, in 1990, the Curry-Howard correspondence was extended to classical logic, following Felleisen and Griffin [6] who discovered that the law of Peirce corresponds to control instructions in functional programmin...|$|E
40|$|AbstractTurkey held various {{examinations}} {{with different}} names under the <b>name</b> <b>of</b> <b>system</b> of transition to secondary {{education in the}} last 30 years. However, each examination method was found inadequate and Turkish education system could not reach the desired success in PISA examination in which student levels of countries that are members of OECD are assessed. For this reason, it was embarked on new quests. TEOG examination was prepared according to semester curriculum, unlike antecedents which are consisted of single day and sessions. Thus, subjective error was minimized in the assessment by reducing the negative effect of the anxiety level factor in assessment of the student. Also, influence degree of school success points was increased. Hence, creation of a process-oriented education model was targeted not result-oriented. In this study; it was started to be searched whether TEOG examination is different from Institutions’ Examination, LGS, OKS, SBS, OGES examinations used in transition to the secondary education in the previous years or not. The essential point in the research is to present success performances of schools. As measurement means, TOPSIS which is Multi-Criteria Decision-Making Technique (MCDM) was used and course were weighted by this method. Successes of 18 secondary schools operating at education-training in Pasinler country which {{was selected as the}} p 8 ilot region in Erzurum were examined in order to show difference of TEOG examination from the other examinations. 6 courses taught in pilot schools within the scope of TEOG central examination were selected. Success averages of courses selected were weighted and pointed with TOPSIS method. Points were mixed and a ranking was formed. Significant {{differences were found between the}} ranking obtained as a result of the study and ranking published by Ministry of National Education. While there is no change in lower and upper ranks in the both rankings, great ranking differences were found in mid-ranks...|$|E
