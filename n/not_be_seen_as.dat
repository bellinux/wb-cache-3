5|$|Abd al-Rahman at {{this time}} was a {{flamboyant}} figure with broad popular support. His stature served to diminish that of the politicians, who were seen as his followers rather than as leaders. Abd al-Rahman could not afford a sudden British withdrawal, since that would {{open the door for}} an Egyptian take-over and the loss of his power. The British also were against an Egyptian take-over, but for different reasons. Yet Abd al-Rahman could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> supporting an indefinite colonial status, and continued to promote independence. Abd al-Rahman and the British were engaged in delicate and unstable arrangements characterized by mutual distrust.|$|E
5|$|Kriegseisen {{notes that}} the {{institution}} of the sejmik gained a negative reputation following the partitions of Poland, and it has been described as one of the dysfunctional elements of the Polish political system that contributed to the fall of the Commonwealth. He cautions against such simplistic assessments, and traces them to 18th century publications whose negative views of the sejmiks have been rarely challenged since. The stereotype of a group of drunken, fighting nobility, found in some literature, should <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> representative, particularly outside the period of the sejmik's decline in the 18th century. He argues that while many sensationalist descriptions of debauchery, brawling or outright bloody violence at sejmiks have survived, they did so because they were just that—sensationalist—and should be seen as exceptions to the long, uneventful, but usually constructive proceedings that were much more common.|$|E
5|$|Scholars of {{the late}} army {{have to contend with}} a {{dramatic}} diminution of the epigraphic record in the 3rd and 4th centuries, compared with the 1st and 2nd centuries. diplomas were no longer issued to retiring auxiliaries after 203 (most likely because almost all were already Roman citizens by then). In addition, there was a huge {{reduction in the number of}} tombstones, altars and other dedications by Roman servicemen. Official stamps of military units on building materials (e.g. tiles) are much rarer. But this trend should probably <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> indicating a decline in the army's administrative sophistication. Papyrus evidence from Egypt shows that military units continued to keep detailed written records in the 4th century (the vast bulk of which are lost due to organic decomposition). Most likely, the decline in inscriptions is due to changing fashion, in part influenced by the increase in barbarian recruits and the rise of Christianity. The dearth of inscriptions leaves major gaps in our understanding {{of the late}} army and renders many conclusions tentative.|$|E

5|$|In {{his paper}} The Schizophrenia of Modern Ethical Theories, philosopher Michael Stocker {{challenges}} Kantian ethics (and all modern ethical theories) {{by arguing that}} actions from duty lack certain moral value. He gives the example of Smith, who visits his friend in hospital out of duty, rather than because of the friendship; he argues that this visit seems morally lacking because it is motivated by the wrong thing. Marcia Baron has attempted to defend Kantian ethics on this point. After presenting {{a number of reasons}} that we might find acting out of duty objectionable, she argues that these problems only arise when people misconstrue what their duty is. Acting out of duty is not intrinsically wrong, but immoral consequences can occur when people misunderstand what they are duty-bound to do. Duty need <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> cold and impersonal: one may have a duty to cultivate their character or improve their personal relationships. Baron further argues that duty should be construed as a secondary motive—that is, a motive that regulates and sets conditions on what may be done, rather than prompt specific actions. She argues that, seen this way, duty neither reveals a deficiency in one's natural inclinations to act, nor undermines the motives and feelings that are essential to friendship. For Baron, being governed by duty does not mean that duty is always the primary motivation to act; rather, it entails that considerations of duty are always action-guiding. A responsible moral agent should take an interest in moral questions, such as questions of character. These should guide moral agents to act from duty.|$|E

25|$|This was {{of great}} {{relevance}} to Gregory {{himself as he}} presided over the important see of Tours, where extensive use {{was made of the}} cult of St. Martin in establishing the authority of the bishopric with the congregation and {{in the context of the}} Frankish church. Gregory's hagiography was an essential component of this. However, this should <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> a selfish grab for power on behalf of the bishops who emerge so triumphantly from the Life of the Fathers, but rather as a bid for hegemony of doctrine and control over the practice of worship, which they believed to be in the best interests of their congregation and the wider church.|$|E
25|$|Like any archaeological monument, the Züschen tomb should <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> isolated. It is {{in a close}} {{relationship}} with its landscape and with other sites in the area. Two further tombs, Züschen II and Züschen III are known to have existed in the area. Züschen II was 150m northwest of the main tomb, it was generally comparable, but smaller and undecorated. A third tomb, Züschen III, is located further east. Less than 1km from the Züschen tomb lies the Hasenberg, a prominent basalt dome, the top of which contains an important Wartberg settlement. Intriguingly, the Züschen tomb also appears to be designed {{in such a way that}} its main axis point directly at the Wartberg itself, 4km to the east.|$|E
25|$|Among {{the many}} groups and organisations that Roberts helped to {{establish}} during his 34 years in Canada is the St. Vincent and Grenadines Association of Montreal. In fact, despite his many international commitments, he remained committed {{to his native}} St. Vincent and the Grenadines and it was he who, {{on the eve of}} the country's independence, submitted a detailed policy statement to the government of St. Vincent outlining why the Grenadines should be included as an integral part of the country's name. The crux of his argument was that the Grenadines should <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> mere appendages of the island of St. Vincent, and that the integrity of all of the smaller islands should be respected. His submission was adopted by the government, hence the name St. Vincent and the Grenadines.|$|E

25|$|This United Order was {{an attempt}} to {{eradicate}} poverty and promote a sense of unity and brotherhood within Latter Day Saint communities. In this expectation they indulge no vague dream of communism, encouraging individual irresponsibility and giving the idler an excuse for hoping to live {{at the expense of the}} thrifty; but rather, a calm trust that in the promised social order, such as God can approve, every man will be a steward in the full enjoyment of liberty to do as he will with the talents committed to his care; but with the sure knowledge that an account of his stewardship shall be required at his hands.}} The LDS Church's view is that the doctrine and the various attempts at practicing it should <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> part of the 19th-century utopian movement in the United States, and is distinct from both Marxist communism and capitalism.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} of personal coping strategies (including self-management or self-help) {{is said to}} be an important element. This can involve making use of medication or psychotherapy if the consumer is fully informed and listened to, including about adverse effects and about which methods fit with the consumer's life and their journey of recovery. Developing coping and problem solving skills to manage individual traits and problem issues (which may or may <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> symptoms of mental disorder) may require a person becoming their own expert, in order to identify key stress points and possible crisis points, and to understand and develop personal ways of responding and coping. Developing a sense of meaning and overall purpose {{is said to be}} important for sustaining the recovery process. This may involve recovering or developing a social or work role. It may also involve renewing, finding or developing a guiding philosophy, religion, politics or culture. From a postmodern perspective, this can be seen as developing a narrative.|$|E
25|$|After the {{formation}} of the Confederate States of America in early February, there was some debate among the secessionists whether the capture of the fort was rightly a matter for South Carolina or for the newly declared national government in Montgomery, Alabama. South Carolina governor Pickens was among the states' rights advocates who thought that all property in Charleston harbor had reverted to South Carolina upon that state's secession as an independent commonwealth. This debate ran alongside another discussion about how aggressively the installationsincluding Forts Sumter and Pickensshould be obtained. President Davis, like his counterpart in Washington, preferred that his side <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> the aggressor. Both sides believed that the first side to use force would lose precious political support in the border states, whose allegiance was undetermined; before Lincoln's inauguration on March 4, five states had voted against secession, including Virginia, and Lincoln openly offered to evacuate Fort Sumter if it would guarantee Virginia's loyalty.|$|E

25|$|Except for the {{preponderance}} of firearms, these reforms remained in place {{throughout the history of}} the mercenary troops, first of the States of Holland, and later of the States-General (though they are often ascribed to Orange's son Maurice of Nassau). In the interim between 1576 and 1588, however, {{the preponderance}} of the forces fighting for the States-General, either in its own pay, or in the pay of foreign allies, like the duke of Anjou and the Earl of Leicester, did not follow this organisational model. These forces can, however, <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> predecessors of the States Army. That army only took shape after the Union of Utrecht was formed in 1579 and the influence of the States of Brabant and the States of Flanders in the States-General was eliminated due to the territorial gains of the duke of Parma who conquered their territories. The core of that new army were the troops raised by Holland on the model introduced after 1572.|$|E
25|$|The cycle's second painting, The Birth of the Princess, {{represents}} Medici's April 26, 1573 birth. Symbols and allegory appear {{throughout the}} painting. On the left, two putti {{play with a}} shield on which the Medici crest appears, suggesting that Heaven favored the young Medici {{from the moment of}} her birth. The river god in the picture's right corner is likely an allusion to the Arno River that passes through Florence, Marie's city of birth. The cornucopia above the infant's head can be interpreted as a harbinger of Marie's future glory and fortune; the lion may be seen as symbolic of power and strength. The glowing halo around the infant's head should <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> a reference to Christian imagery; rather, it should be read according to imperial iconography which uses the halo as an indication of the Queen's divine nature and of her future reign. Though Marie was born under the Taurus sign, Sagittarius appears in the painting; it may be seen as a guardian of imperial power.|$|E
25|$|Since {{one might}} not travel faster than light, one might {{conclude}} that a human can never travel further from the Earth than 40 light-years if the traveler is active between the age of 20 and 60. A traveler would then {{never be able to}} reach more than the very few star systems which exist within the limit of 20–40 light-years from the Earth. This is a mistaken conclusion: because of time dilation, the traveler can travel thousands of light-years during their 40 active years. If the spaceship accelerates at a constant 1g (in its own changing frame of reference), it will, after 354 days, reach speeds a little under the speed of light (for an observer on Earth), and time dilation will increase their lifespan to thousands of Earth years, seen from the reference system of the Solar System, but the traveler's subjective lifespan will not thereby change. If the traveler returns to the Earth, she or he will land thousands of years into the Earth's future. Their speed will <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> higher than the speed of light by observers on Earth, and the traveler will not measure their speed as being higher than the speed of light, but will see a length contraction of the universe in their direction of travel. And as the traveler turns around to return, the Earth will seem to experience much more time than the traveler does. So, while their (ordinary) coordinate speed cannot exceed c, their proper speed (distance as seen by Earth divided by their proper time) can be much greater than c. This is seen in statistical studies of muons traveling much further than c times their half-life (at rest), if traveling close to c.|$|E
