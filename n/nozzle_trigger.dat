5000|$|Many {{gas station}} pumps (at Petro Canada for example) are {{equipped}} with a velocity fuse to limit gasoline flow. The fuse can be heard to engage with a [...] "click" [...] on some pumps if the <b>nozzle</b> <b>trigger</b> is depressed fully. A slight reduction in fuel flow can be observed. The fuse resets instantly upon releasing the trigger.|$|E

25|$|A {{welding torch}} head {{is used to}} weld metals. It can be {{identified}} by having {{only one or two}} pipes running to the <b>nozzle,</b> no oxygen-blast <b>trigger,</b> and two valve knobs {{at the bottom of the}} handle letting the operator adjust the oxygen and fuel flow respectively.|$|R
5000|$|Spider-Man's web-shooters {{are perhaps}} his most {{distinguishing}} trait, after his costume. Peter had reasoned that a spider (even a human one) needed a web. Since the radioactive spider-bite did not initially grant him {{the power to}} spin webs, he had instead {{found a way to}} produce them artificially. The wrist-mounted devices fire an adhesive [...] "webbing" [...] (see below) through a threaded adjustable <b>nozzle.</b> The <b>trigger</b> rests high in the palm and requires a double tap from the middle two fingers to activate, eliminating the chance of accidental discharge when forming a fist. In order to fire the webbing, Spider-Man's fingers must hit the sensor precisely.|$|R
5000|$|A bidet shower (bidet spray, bidet sprayer, {{or health}} faucet, {{sometimes}} colloquially called a Muslim shower (because it is customary {{for them to}} clean themselves), or a [...] "bum gun", is a hand-held <b>triggered</b> <b>nozzle,</b> similar to that on a kitchen sink sprayer, that delivers a spray of water to assist in anal cleansing and cleaning the genitals after defecation and urination.|$|R
5000|$|A bidet shower (also {{known as}} [...] "bidet spray", [...] "bidet sprayer", or [...] "health faucet") is a {{hand-held}} <b>triggered</b> <b>nozzle,</b> {{similar to that}} on a kitchen sink sprayer, that delivers a spray of water to assist in anal cleansing and cleaning the genitals after defecation and urination. In contrast to a bidet that is integrated with the toilet, a bidet shower has to be held by the hands, and cleaning does not take place automatically. Bidet showers are common in countries where water is considered essential for anal cleansing.|$|R
5000|$|Common {{garden hose}} <b>trigger</b> <b>nozzles</b> are a simple {{example of the}} plug nozzle and its method of operation. In this example the nozzle {{consists}} of a conical or bell shaped opening with a plug on a movable rod positioned {{in front of the}} nozzle. The plug looks similar to a poppet valve. The stem of the valve runs back through the body of the nozzle body to a [...] "trigger", normally a long lever running down the back of the nozzle assembly. A spring keeps the valve pressed against the opening under normal use, thereby providing a failsafe cut-off that stops the flow of water when the nozzle is dropped.|$|R
