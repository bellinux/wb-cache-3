5|$|The {{strength}} or durability of heavy metals such as chromium, iron, nickel, copper, zinc, molybdenum, tin, tungsten, and lead, {{as well as}} their alloys, makes them useful for the manufacture of artefacts such as tools, machinery, appliances, utensils, pipes, railroad tracks, buildings and bridges, automobiles, locks, furniture, ships, planes, coinage and jewellery. They are also used as alloying additives for enhancing the properties of other metals. Of the two dozen elements that have been used in the world's monetised coinage only two, carbon and aluminium, are not heavy metals. Gold, silver, and platinum are used in jewellery as are (for example) nickel, copper, indium, and cobalt in coloured gold. Low-cost jewellery and children's toys may be made, to a significant degree, of heavy metals such as chromium, <b>nickel,</b> <b>cadmium,</b> or lead.|$|E

2500|$|The {{water quality}} of the lake varies widely during various seasons [...] summer, premonsoon, monsoon and postmonsoon [...] as the depth and width of the lake mouth varies causing a dynamic {{situation}} of mixing and circulation of waters. The resultant salinity variation and DO (dissolved oxygen) affects the primary production, plankton, biodiversity and fisheries in this lake. Salinity values vary from zero during the monsoon to about 52,000 ppm (hyper saline) during post and premonsoon seasons. Adjustment to this wide variation is difficult for sessile and sedentary species in the lake. However, euryhaline species still dwell in the lake. The benthic or the bottom habitat of this lagoon is classified into three zones. The southern zone, the first zone, is dominated by sand with some admixture of mud. The second zone at the northern region is wholly muddy. The third zone with sand and mud in equal parts is overgrown with patches of weeds and {{is reported to be}} rich in benthic biodiversity.

40|$|Aims The primary aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the impact of active <b>nickel</b> and <b>cadmium</b> transport, transpiration and shoot biomass production on Ni and Cd accumulation in the leaves of the Ni-hyperaccumulator Leptoplax emarginata. A secondary objective was to observe the effects of various concentrations of <b>nickel</b> and <b>cadmium</b> in solutions on the plant growth and ecophysiological characteristics of these plants. Finally, the study sought to identify possible <b>nickel</b> and <b>cadmium</b> concentration gradients in solution as a function of the root distance. Methods The Intact Plant Transpiration Stream Concentration Factor (TSCF=xylem/solution solute concentration ratio) was determined for both Ni and Cd and for the selected intact transpiring Ni-hyperaccumulator Leptoplax emarginata, cultivated on two contrasting fertilized and Ni-Cd-contaminated sandy porous media (rhizotrons with central root compartments, linked to Mariotte tubes operated at - 1 kPa). IPTSCF(Ni) and IPTSCF(Cd) were calculated as the ratios between the hyperaccumulator plant's <b>nickel</b> or <b>cadmium</b> mass in the leaves and the <b>nickel</b> or <b>cadmium</b> concentration in solution by the volume of water transpired during the period of culture. Plant growth characteristics and gas exchanges were also recorded. Results IPTSCF values were much greater than 1 (IPTSCF(Ni) = 5. 2 +/- 0. 9 and IPTSCF(Cd) = 4. 4 +/- 0. 6) whatever the amount of available Ni and Cd. This characterized a predominantly active plant metal uptake. Moreover, biological regulation was reported: plant growth and transpiration were significantly lower for hyperaccumulator plants cultivated in sand which was rich in available Ni and Cd, than for hyperaccumulator plants cultivated in topsoil, poor in available Ni and Cd. In the soil rhizosphere, capillary flow was related to transpiration and a depletion pattern was developed for Ni and sometimes for Cd. Conclusions Overall, the Intact Plant Transpiration Stream Concentration Factor appeared to be a relevant metal bioconcentration factor taking into account the predominant type of metal transport from roots to leaves, plant growth and transpiration coupling and metal availability. IPTSCF(Ni) and IPTSCF(Cd) values were much greater than 1 and similar whatever the amount of available Ni and Cd. This characterized a predominantly active plant combining Ni and Cd uptake and biological regulations dependent of the Ni and Cd concentrations in solution...|$|R

The optimum pH for <b>nickel</b> and <b>cadmium</b> adsorption by the dried cells of E. agglomerans SM 38 were found to be 7. 0 (25. 5 % removal) and 8. 0 (32 % removal), respectively. For B. subtilis WD 90 and B. subtilis SM 29, the optimum pH at 8. 0 exhibited the nickel removal of 27 % and 25 %, respectively, and cadmium removal of 28 % and 28. 5 %, respectively. The heavy metal adsorption by the dried cells and wet cells of E. agglomerans SM 38 were slightly increased with increasing initial concentrations of <b>nickel</b> and <b>cadmium</b> up to 60 and 30 ppm, respectively. The bioflocculant of B. subtilis WD 90 and B. subtilis SM 29 showed the highest nickel removal of 90. 7 % and 87. 0 % respectively, while the cadmium removal was 90. 9 and 91. 4 %, respectively. The optimum pH for adsorption of both <b>nickel</b> and <b>cadmium</b> by the bioflocculant of E. agglomerans SM 38 was 7. 0 with the removal of 92. 8 and 84. 2 %, respectively.

40|$|AbstractFourteen Trichoderma {{isolates}} {{were evaluated}} for their tolerance to two heavy metals, <b>nickel</b> and <b>cadmium.</b> Three isolates, MT- 4, UBT- 18, and IBT-I, showed {{high levels of}} nickel tolerance, whereas MT- 4, UBT- 18, and IBT-II showed better tolerance of cadmium than the other isolates. Under nickel stress, biomass production increased up to a Ni concentration of 60 ppm in all strains but then decreased as the concentrations of nickel were further increased. Among the nickel-tolerant isolates, UBT- 18 produced significantly higher biomass upon exposure to nickel (up to 150 ppm); however, the minimum concentration of nickel required to inhibit 50 % of growth (MIC 50) was highest in IBT-I. Among the cadmium-tolerant isolates, IBT-II showed both maximum biomass production and a maximum MIC 50 value in cadmium stress. As the biomass of the Trichoderma isolates increased, {{a higher percentage of}} nickel removal was observed up to a concentration of 40 ppm, followed by an increase in residual nickel and a decrease in biomass production at higher nickel concentrations in the medium. The increase in cadmium concentrations resulted in a decrease in biomass production and positively correlated with an increase in residual cadmium in the culture broth. <b>Nickel</b> and <b>cadmium</b> stress also influenced the sensitivity of the Trichoderma isolates to soil fungistasis.
