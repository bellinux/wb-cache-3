5|$|Olfactory cues may be {{important}} in salmon, which are known {{to return to the}} exact river where they hatched. Lockley reports experimental evidence that fish such as minnows can accurately tell the difference between the waters of different rivers. Salmon may use their magnetic sense to <b>navigate</b> <b>to</b> within reach of their river, and then use olfaction to identify the river at close range.|$|E
5|$|Artificial {{lighting}} discourages nesting and {{interferes with}} the hatchlings' ability to <b>navigate</b> <b>to</b> the water's edge. Females prefer nesting on beaches free of artificial lighting. On developed beaches, nests are often clustered around tall buildings, perhaps because they block out the man-made light sources. Loggerhead hatchlings are drawn toward the brighter area over the water which is the consequence of the reflection of moon and star light. Confused by the brighter artificial light, they navigate inland, away from the protective waters, which exposes them to dehydration and predation as the sun rises. Artificial lighting causes {{tens of thousands of}} hatchling deaths per year.|$|E
5|$|Born in Akaroa, New Zealand, on 22 February 1872, Worsley {{joined the}} New Zealand Shipping Company in 1888. He served aboard several vessels running trade routes between New Zealand, England and the South Pacific. While on South Pacific service, he became renowned {{for his ability}} to <b>navigate</b> <b>to</b> tiny, remote islands. He joined the Royal Navy Reserve in 1902 and served on HMS Swiftsure for a year before {{returning}} to the Merchant Navy. In 1914, he joined the Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition, which aimed to cross the Antarctic continent.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} {{each school}} day, the player will be given the option to <b>navigate</b> <b>to</b> various {{locations}} within the game's setting. Each choosable location is accompanied by an image of a heroine in order to allow the choices to be easier to make. Throughout gameplay, the player is given multiple options to choose from. Text progression pauses at these points, and depending on the choices that the player makes, the affection rate of the heroine associated with the event will either increase, decrease, or remain the same. This mechanism determines which direction of the plot the player will progress into, but influences the story only during Konomi's and Karin's plot lines.|$|E
5|$|On 15 January 1942, II./NJG1 {{transferred}} to Sint-Truiden—Saint-Trond in the French pronunciation—in Belgium. Schnaufer entered front-line service {{at a time}} when the RAF was reassessing the air offensive against Germany. The effectiveness of British Bomber Command to accurately hit German targets had been questioned by the War Cabinet Secretary David Bensusan-Butt who published the Butt Report in August 1941. The report in parts concluded that the British crews failed to <b>navigate</b> <b>to,</b> identify, and bomb their targets. Although the report was not widely accepted by senior RAF commanders, Prime Minister Winston Churchill, instructed Commander-in-Chief Richard Peirse that during the winter months only limited operations were to be conducted. Flight operations were also hindered by bad weather in the first months of 1942, so II./NJG1 only saw very limited action during that period.|$|E

5|$|San Martín left O'Higgins {{in charge}} of the Army, and {{returned}} to Buenos Aires to request resources for the campaign to Peru. He did not have a good reception this time. Pueyrredón thought that Chile should compensate Buenos Aires for the money invested in their liberation, as the support to San Martín reduced the support to Belgrano, and the Portuguese-Brazilian invasion of the Eastern Bank menaced Buenos Aires. Incapable of financial support, Buenos Aires sent lawyer Manuel Aguirre to the United States, to request aid and acknowledge the declaration of independence. However, the mission failed, as the United States stayed neutral in the conflict because they negotiated the purchase of Florida with Spain. The Chilean José Miguel Carrera had obtained ships on his own after the disaster of Rancagua, which he intended to use to liberate Chile; but as San Martín had already done that, he refused to place his fleet under the Army of the Andes. Carrera was an enemy of O'Higgins and sought to <b>navigate</b> <b>to</b> Chile and depose him, so Pueyrredón imprisoned him, and confiscated his ships.|$|E

25|$|In 1888, Zug let the River Rouge Improvement Company cut a small canal {{through the}} south section of his {{property}} to connect the Rouge River and the Detroit River (this Short Cut Canal, as {{it came to be}} known, was enlarged in the early 1920s by Henry Ford to allow large ships to more easily <b>navigate</b> <b>to</b> and from his famous Ford River Rouge Complex). Three years later Zug pulled off the largest real estate transaction of the decade: he sold his island for $300,000 to industries that wanted it as a dumping ground.|$|E
25|$|However, the boats' {{presence}} poses {{a threat}} to the animals, as it distracts them from important activities such as feeding, social interaction and reproduction. In addition, the noise produced by the motors has an adverse effect on their auditory function and reduces their ability to detect their prey, communicate, and <b>navigate.</b> <b>To</b> protect these marine animals during whale-watching activities, the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has published a “Guide for observing marine life”. The guide recommends boats carrying the whale watchers keep their distance from the cetaceans and it expressly prohibits chasing, harassing, obstructing, touching, or feeding them.|$|E

25|$|After {{a period}} of decline, {{navigation}} rights along the river were confirmed by a clause in the Stour and Salwarpe Navigation Act of 1662. Further improvements {{were made to the}} river above Evesham from 1664 by a syndicate led by Andrew Yarranton. He was working for Lord Windsor and others, and the work included the construction of three navigation weirs, which were a type of flash lock with a single barrier. These were used to enable boats to pass over shoals, and {{with the exception of the}} one at Pensham, were not built adjacent to mills. The Pensham watergate did at times hinder the proper operation of the mill, when the water levels rose above the gate. Once Yarranton's work was completed, barges of 30 tonnes could <b>navigate</b> <b>to</b> Stratford.|$|E
25|$|Visual memory {{describes}} {{the relationship between}} perceptual processing and the encoding, storage and retrieval of the resulting neural representations. Visual memory occurs over a broad time range spanning from eye movements to years in order to visually <b>navigate</b> <b>to</b> a previously visited location. Visual memory {{is a form of}} memory which preserves some characteristics of our senses pertaining to visual experience. We are able to place in memory visual information which resembles objects, places, animals or people in a mental image. The experience of visual memory is also referred to as the mind's eye through which we can retrieve from our memory a mental image of original objects, places, animals or people. Visual memory is one of several cognitive systems, which are all interconnected parts that combine to form the human memory. Types of palinopsia, the persistence or recurrence of a visual image after the stimulus has been removed, is a dysfunction of visual memory.|$|E
