25|$|Reflecting on {{her work}} in musical films, Powell said: People are always fascinated by the {{so-called}} golden age of musicals, but it wasn’t all that great. Everything was glazed. Those movies didn’t reflect reality. I was at MGM for 11 years and nobody ever let me play anything but teenagers. I was 25 years old with kids of my own and it was getting ridiculous. Publicity was froth. Everything you said was monitored. With me, they didn’t have to worry. I <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>anything</b> to say, anyway. It was hard work, I had no friends, no social interaction with people my age and the isolation was tough. But I had to support my family, so I did what I was told and had no other choice.|$|E
500|$|In a 1994 interview, Gabe Pressman asked Shabazz whether Farrakhan [...] "had {{anything}} to do" [...] with MalcolmX's death. She replied: [...] "Of course, yes. Nobody kept it a secret. It was {{a badge of}} honor. Everybody talked about it, yes." [...] Farrakhan denied the allegations, stating [...] "I <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>anything</b> to do with Malcolm's death", although {{he said he had}} [...] "created an atmosphere that allowed Malcolm to be assassinated." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to Univers, a Century, Times Roman, and later an [...] "Aldine" [...] font (Bembo) were available, as was a Symbols font. However, the Composer, with its relatively small market, <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>anything</b> like {{the variety of}} typeballs available as there were for the Selectric (see below). Each font required separate typeballs for italic and bold versions, and a separate set of roman/italic/bold balls was required for each size of type. (Not all fonts were available in bold and italic in every size.) The need to change typeballs frequently, sometimes multiple times in the same sentence, slowed work down and {{was a source of}} owner dissatisfaction. (In typical use, Selectric typeballs were changed infrequently.) The balls themselves were somewhat fragile and not designed to resist frequent handling.|$|E

2500|$|In 1990, a British Prisoner {{fan club}} {{arranged}} for Florance {{to visit the}} United Kingdom to appear in their 'On the Outside' tour. Florance arrived with fellow cast member Amanda Muggleton, and the pair were extremely well received. They were mobbed at the airport; Florance said, [...] "Oh my goodness me. I didn't dream of it. I've <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>anything</b> like that in my whole life". Florance and Val Lehman were given a civic reception by the Mayor of Derby on 22 August, an occasion that was poignant for Florance because her first husband {{had been in the}} Derbyshire Yeomanry. At this time Florance was already unwell, and while on the tour had to have a large tumour removed. Despite this setback, she was back on tour within days.|$|E
2500|$|As Hoveyda {{garnered}} more experience, opportunities within Iran's governmental apparatus {{were becoming}} available to him. In August 1944, for instance, he accepted {{a position to}} accompany Zein ol-Abedin Rahnema, Iran's minister plenipotentiary, to France. Being an avid Francophile, Hoveyda would enjoy his time as an embassy official, but he would soon be entangled in an international scandal that would taint him {{for the rest of}} his life. The [...] "Paris Story" [...] recounts the illegal importation of financial assets, stored in Swiss banks during the war for security purposes, from Switzerland into the coffers of wealthy French businessmen in 1945. To avoid border taxes, diplomatic personnel were persuaded to act as the intermediary, simply because embassy vehicles were, by law, unable to be searched. Although Hoveida <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>anything</b> to do with the illegal transfers, his mere association with some of those indicted was enough for him to be used as a scapegoat in the affair.|$|E
2500|$|With {{the band}} assembled, {{recording}} for the album began in January 2003. The band worked with music producer Don Gilmore, {{who had previously}} worked with Linkin Park and Pearl Jam. The band recorded {{for the first half}} of the year, and then released Lo-Pro on September 30, 2003. It peaked at no. 9 on the Billboard Top Heatseekers chart, and stayed on the chart for two weeks. One single was released, [...] "Sunday", which peaked at no. 20 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Tracks and no. 27 on Modern Rock Tracks. The track also appeared in the 989 Studios game MLB 2004 for the PlayStation 2. Murray said of the single [...] "It's definitely not about watching football or going to church. It's really about how I've <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>anything</b> to look forward to on Sunday. I never liked going to school or going to a job, and when Sunday comes, you just know things are gonna hit the wringer the following day." [...] The band had planned on releasing a second single, [...] bassist Jonathan Fahnestock had even asked the internet community to vote for which track it would be, but it never surfaced. However, the track [...] "Ignition" [...] was featured in the 2004 PC game The Ultimate Dodge Garage.|$|E

6000|$|... "I don't know," [...] said Marian, quickly; [...] "only I hope I shall <b>never</b> <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> to do {{with such}} people; I can't judge for them; I had rather not think about them; it is of no use." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Snake skins! Snake skins!" [...] shrieked Jenny Wren. [...] "What are {{you talking}} about, Peter Rabbit? I <b>never</b> <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> to do with Snake skins and don't want to. Ugh! It makes me shiver just to think of it." ...|$|R
50|$|Darkwing <b>never</b> <b>has</b> <b>anything</b> nice to say, {{but says}} it anyway. He {{believes}} life is pain, and it's his goal {{to make sure}} others suffer it more than he does. Darkwing combines with Dreadwind to form the super jet Dreadwing.|$|R
6000|$|... "Anyway, it's {{not quite}} what I mean. The cuts will heal. What made me turn dizzy and {{fall off the}} binder? I've <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>anything</b> of that kind happen to me before." ...|$|E
60|$|Philip reddened {{and looked}} away. The anguish of her tone {{made him feel}} strangely uneasy. He wished with all his heart that he had <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>anything</b> to do with Miss Wilkinson.|$|E

6000|$|... "That is {{the worst}} of it. Congress did pass a law, {{two or three years}} since, to build some frigates, but they <b>have</b> <b>never</b> been launched. Now Washington has gone out of office, I suppose we shall <b>never</b> <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> good in the country." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear boy, {{no woman}} is a genius. Women are a {{decorative}} sex. They <b>never</b> <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> to say, but they say it charmingly. Women represent the triumph of matter over mind, just as men represent the triumph of mind over morals." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, {{it is no}} trouble. I {{have nothing}} to do. I <b>never</b> <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> to do. I don't suppose I could do it if I had. I should be delighted to come with you, sir, if I can be of any use." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Well, I will do my best, Mrs. Harcourt," [...] Bob said, meekly; [...] "but I have <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>anything</b> {{to do with}} girls, {{except my}} sister; and she gives the advice, always, and not me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "With this peon {{watching}} here I'm {{not likely}} to be surprised," [...] said Naab. [...] "That strip of sand protects me at night from approach, and I've <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>anything</b> to fear from across the river." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That Bradley <b>never</b> <b>has</b> <b>anything</b> good," [...] said Miss Thorne, who {{had just}} caught the name during her whisperings with Eleanor.

60|$|She {{is always}} in trouble--and don't she let you know it, too! Her life is undeniably a hard one. Nothing goes right with her.

6000|$|... "I don't {{doubt she}} is right," [...] said I.
