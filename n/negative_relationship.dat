The outcome variables in study 1 were job satisfaction, communication, apprehension, nonverbal immediacy, assertiveness, and responsiveness. For ambivalents the result showed that they had a <b>negative</b> strong <b>relationship</b> for job satisfaction, positive weak relationship for communication apprehension, <b>negative</b> moderate <b>relationship</b> for nonverbal immediacy, no relationship for assertiveness, and <b>negative</b> weak <b>relationship</b> for responsiveness. For the indifferents it showed that they had a <b>negative</b> moderate <b>relationship</b> for job satisfaction, no relationship for communication apprehension, no relationship for nonverbal immediacy, a <b>negative</b> weak <b>relationship</b> for assertiveness and no relationship for responsiveness. For the upward mobile it showed that there was a positive weak relationship for job satisfaction, <b>negative</b> weak <b>relationship</b> for communication apprehension, positive moderate relationship for nonverbal immediacy, positive moderate relationship for assertiveness, and a positive moderate relationship for responsiveness(Pruden).For study 2 the outcome variables were job satisfaction, competence, caring, trustworthiness, extraversion, neuroticism and psychoticism. For the ambivalent it showed a <b>negative</b> moderate <b>relationship</b> for job satisfaction, <b>negative</b> moderate <b>relationship</b> for competence, <b>negative</b> strong <b>relationship</b> for caring, <b>negative</b> moderate <b>relationship</b> for trustworthiness, <b>negative</b> weak <b>relationship</b> for extraversion, positive weak relationship for neuroticism, and positive moderate relationship for psychoticism.

They found a negative correlation between EI and managerial work demands; while under low levels of managerial work demands, they found a <b>negative</b> <b>relationship</b> between EI and teamwork effectiveness. An explanation for this may suggest gender differences in EI, as women tend to score higher levels than men. This furthers the idea that job context plays a role in the relationships between EI, teamwork effectiveness, and job performance. Another interesting find was discussed in a study that assessed a possible link between EI and entrepreneurial behaviors and success.|$|E
40|$|AbstractFamily {{relationships}} {{account for}} much of the support available to individuals with mental illness. Although some studies have acknowledged the importance of family support, and while others have underlined the harmful effects of <b>negative</b> <b>relationships,</b> research has seldom empirically considered the complex web of positive and <b>negative</b> <b>relationships</b> in family networks. This research hypothesised that social capital has distinct consequences for psychological health depending on {{the presence or absence of}} <b>negative</b> family <b>relationships.</b> Through a five-wave follow-up of 60 individuals undergoing psychotherapy in a private practice, the study explored the structural features of positive and <b>negative</b> <b>relationships,</b> considered jointly, in the family networks of adults with mental illness. Four patterns of relationships were found: bonding social capital, bridging social capital, overload and ego-centred conflict. Compared to individuals within a bonding or bridging social capital pattern, those experiencing overload and ego-centred conflict patterns showed higher levels of psychological distress. These results highlight the importance of considering the structural dimensions of positive and <b>negative</b> <b>relationships</b> together to understand the lasting connection between family networks and the psychological health of individuals with mental illness...|$|R

In this study, arguments are developed on the conditions within neighbourhoods and on individual characteristics that facilitate negative relations amongst neighbours. The arguments are divided according to three perspectives: diversity, uncertainty and social influence. In the Dutch context, most support is found for the social influence perspective, and both the neighbourhood and the individual level seem important in explaining <b>negative</b> <b>relationships.</b> Important factors that explain the likelihood for <b>negative</b> <b>relationships</b> are the willingness of residents to intervene on behalf of the neighbourhood, religious diversity and individually perceived conflicts in the neighbourhood.

Aiming to expand on Stoeber’s findings, the present study examined 229 university students investigating the unique relationships of the three forms of perfectionism with humor styles, callous-unemotional-uncaring traits, social value orientations, self- and other-interest, and positive self-evaluations (positive self-regard, feeling superior to others). When multiple regressions were conducted controlling for the overlap between the three forms of perfectionism, OOP showed unique positive relationships with aggressive humor, uncaring traits, an individualistic orientation, and positive self-regard and unique <b>negative</b> <b>relationships</b> with a prosocial orientation and other-interest. In contrast, SOP showed unique positive relationships with affiliative humor and other-interest and unique <b>negative</b> <b>relationships</b> with aggressive humor, callous-uncaring traits, and a competitive orientation whereas SPP showed unique positive relationships with self-depreciating humor and unemotional traits and unique <b>negative</b> <b>relationships</b> with both forms of positive self-evaluations. The findings provide further evidence that OOP is a “dark” form of perfectionism positively associated with narcissistic, antisocial, and uncaring personality characteristics...|$|R

25|$|Debt {{levels may}} affect {{economic}} growth rates. In 2010, economists Kenneth Rogoff and Carmen Reinhart reported {{that among the}} 20 developed countries studied, average annual GDP growth was 3–4% when debt was relatively moderate or low (i.e. under 60% of GDP), but it dips to just 1.6% when debt was high (i.e., above 90% of GDP). In April 2013, the conclusions of Rogoff and Reinhart's study came into question when a coding error in their original paper was discovered by Herndon, Ash and Pollin of the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. Herndon, Ash and Pollin found that after correcting for errors and unorthodox methods used, {{there was no evidence}} that debt above a specific threshold reduces growth. Reinhart and Rogoff maintain that after correcting for errors, a <b>negative</b> <b>relationship</b> between high debt and growth remains. However, other economists, including Paul Krugman, have argued that it is low growth which causes national debt to increase, rather than the other way around.|$|E
25|$|The Canucks {{began the}} {{campaign}} overseas in a two-game {{series against the}} Mighty Ducks of Anaheim in Tokyo, Japan. It {{marked the first time}} in NHL history that a regular season game was held outside of North America – an effort from the league to attract attention to the sport in anticipation of the 1998 Winter Olympics, which were held in Nagano, Japan. As the team's performance continued to worsen, starting the 1997–98 season with three wins in the first 16 games, Quinn was fired as general manager after ten years with the team. Soon thereafter, Renney was fired and replaced as coach by Mike Keenan, reuniting him with Messier, another central figure from the Rangers' 1994 team. Keenan's hiring reportedly exacerbated tensions between groups of Canucks players and his <b>negative</b> <b>relationship</b> with Linden was given ample media attention. Two months into his tenure with the team, his role was expanded and he was made de facto general manager. With control of player personnel, Keenan overhauled the roster, making ten trades within two months, most notably dealing Linden to the New York Islanders. Although the trade was unpopular with fans, the Canucks received winger Todd Bertuzzi in return, who would later {{become an integral part of}} the team's return to success in the next decade. Defenceman Bryan McCabe was also part of the deal, who would eventually be involved in a key transaction in the 1999 NHL Entry Draft. After the Canucks finished the 1997–98 season last in the Western Conference, former NHL Vice-President Brian Burke was named general manager in the summer.|$|E
500|$|Proponents {{state the}} FairTax {{would reduce the}} number of tax filers by about 86% (from 100 million to 14 million) and reduce the filing {{complexity}} to a simplified state sales tax form. The Government Accountability Office (GAO), among others, have specifically identified the <b>negative</b> <b>relationship</b> between compliance costs and the number of focal points for collection.

Retailers would receive an administrative fee equal to the greater of $200 or 0.25% of the remitted tax as compensation for compliance costs. In addition, supporters state that the overwhelming majority of purchases occur in major retail outlets, which are very unlikely to evade the FairTax and risk losing their business licenses. Economic Census figures for 2002 show that 48.5% of merchandise sales are made by just 688 businesses ("Big-Box" [...] retailers). 85.7% of all retail sales are made by 92,334 businesses, which is 3.6% of American companies.
