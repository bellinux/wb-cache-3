25|$|I {{never did}} {{know exactly what}} was meant by the term 'The Beats', but let's say that the {{original}} meeting, association, comradeship of Allen , myself, Michael , Lawrence , Philip Whalen, who's not here, Lew Welch, who's dead, Gregory , for me, to a somewhat lesser extent (I never knew Gregory {{as well as the}} others) did embody a criticism and a vision which we shared in various ways, and then went our own ways for many years. Where we began to come really close together again, in the late '60s, and gradually working toward this point, it seems to me, was when Allen began to take a deep interest in Oriental thought and then in Buddhism which added another dimension to our levels of agreement; and later through Allen's influence, Lawrence began to draw toward that; and from another angle, Michael and I after the lapse of some years of contact, found our heads very much in the same place, and it's very curious and interesting now; and Lawrence went off in a very political direction for a while, which <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>had</b> any objection with, except that wasn't my main focus. It's very interesting that we find ourselves so much on the same ground again, after having explored divergent paths; and find ourselves united on this position of powerful environmental concern, critique of the future of the individual state, and an essentially shared poetics, and only half-stated but in the background very powerfully there, a basic agreement on some Buddhist type psychological views of human nature and human possibilities.|$|E

[...] This {{came on the}} heels of a well-publicized trip to North Korea where his agent, Darren Prince, reported he had been drinking heavily and to an extent [...] "that <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>had</b> seen before." ...|$|E
500|$|An early {{difficulty}} was {{the implementation}} of texture mapping. Neurath had experimented unsuccessfully with the concept on an Apple II computer in the late 1980s, but {{he believed that the}} more powerful IBM PCs of the time might be able to process it. He contacted Lerner Research programmer Chris Green—an acquaintance from his past work with Ned Lerner—who created a working algorithm. Using the Space Rogue engine, Green's algorithm, assembly code from Lerner Research's Car and Driver and original programming, the Blue Sky team completed a prototype of Underworld after roughly a month of work. Neurath described the prototype as [...] "fast, smooth, and [...] true texture mapped walls, though the ceiling and floor were flat shaded and the corridors and rooms were all 10' [...] high—it looked a lot like Wolfenstein-3D in fact." [...] The team demonstrated it at the June 1990 Consumer Electronics Show (CES) and impressed Origin Systems. Origin producer Warren Spector later said, [...] "I remember Paul showing me that demo [...] at CES and being totally floored by it. <b>None</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>had</b> ever seen anything like it." [...] The two companies reached a publishing agreement that summer, and Origin suggested that the game be reworked to fit into the Ultima universe. The team agreed, and the game was renamed Ultima Underworld. While Spector had hoped to produce the game, he was not assigned to the role; and he later said that he [...] "sort of watched [...] jealously from the sidelines." ...|$|E

2500|$|The serialists {{were all}} there. And {{so were the}} Americanists, both Aaron Copland's group and Virgil 's. And here was {{something}} that {{had come out of}} Boston that <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>had</b> ever heard of and was completely different from either. There was nearly a riot in the foyer [...] — everybody shouting. A real whoop-dee-doo.|$|E
2500|$|Upon {{receiving}} orders, General Scott {{traveled all}} the way from his post in Virginia City to Bluff, in order to negotiate an end to the war. Scott was genuinely uninterested in fighting the hostile Utes and Paiutes, so on March 10, 1915 he left Bluff, unarmed, with just a few of his men, to meet Polk and Posey at a place called Mexican Hat, near Navajo Mountain. General Scott described the journey; [...] "We reached Bluff on March 10 and learned that the Indians had gone to the Navajo Mountains, 125 miles southwest of Bluff. We stayed a day in Bluff and then went on to Mexican Hat. Some friendly Navajos met me at Mexican Hat and went ahead of me to tell Poke's [...] band of my coming. Among them was Bzoshe, the old Navajo chief with whom the government had so much trouble with a year ago and who is now our fast friend. I had sent for him to meet me at Bluff. Mr. Jenkins, Indian agent at Navajo Springs, Mr. Creel, Colonel Michie, and my orderly accompanied me to Mexican Hat. <b>None</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>had</b> a gun. Jim Boy, a friendly Paiute, was sent out to tell the Paiutes that I wanted to see them. Some of them came near where I was camped, but it wasn't until the third day that anyone dared to come to the camp. Posey and four other Indians then came in. We talked a little through a Navajo interpreter. It was in the evening, and I just asked them how they were. I told them I did not feel very well {{and did not want to}} talk to them until the next day. They helped us kill a beef and we gave them a good meal, the first they'd had in weeks. We also gave them some blankets. Posey and his men didn't have any weapons, but I have reason to suspect that they had hidden them nearby. The next day, Poke and Hatch [...] and about 25 others came to see me. I asked them to tell me their troubles. I said that I didn't think they would like to have their children chased by soldiers and cowboys all over the mountains and killed and that I wanted to help them. I didn't try to push the matter with them, but asked them what they wanted to do. After they had talked among themselves, they said they would do anything I wanted them to do." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{think it}} would be nice," [...] said Cecily timidly, [...] "and <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>have</b> any {{experience}} <b>of</b> being editors, any more than Bev, so that wouldn't matter." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That isn't important," [...] replied Louise. [...] "It is {{probably}} a mere coincidence. <b>None</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>have</b> ever seen the real Lucy, and she may not resemble her mother at all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We have drilled one hole, Maria, and <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>have</b> got {{our fingers}} smashed, so I {{think we have}} every reason to be {{satisfied}} with our first experience at the work." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ah! yes,' said Cadurcis, mournfully. 'When I was in Greece, I used {{often to}} wish that <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>had</b> ever left dear Cherbury; but I do not now.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{was always}} fond of my {{brothers}} and sisters," [...] answered the doctor; [...] "and we couldn't well rob each other, for <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>had</b> a penny to lose." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Thank heavens, it's {{all over}} now. We've <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>had</b> any sleep for three days, and when I once get off I don't mean {{to wake up}} for a week.' ...|$|E

6000|$|That made me and Jim catch our breath, too. Then we {{all stood}} petrified but happy, for <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>had</b> ever seen an ocean, or ever {{expected}} to. Tom kept muttering: ...|$|E
60|$|Then it {{came out}} as we sat over breakfast, that, with the {{exception}} of Arnott and Pirolo, <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>had</b> ever seen a corpse, or knew in what manner the spirit passes.|$|E

6000|$|... "The truth is," [...] replied her uncle, with {{a cheerful}} smile, [...] "that <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>has</b> an idea where we're going, or what that farm of mine looks like. We're explorers, like Stanley in mid-Africa. That's {{the beauty of}} this excursion." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And what a pile {{of things}} have {{happened}} since that time!" [...] was Sam's comment. [...] "By the way, it is strange that <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>have</b> heard from any of those girls lately. They ought to be coming east from California by this time." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{not much}} of an item so far as size goes," [...] said Gif.

6000|$|Savello refused! They insisted; {{they asked}} for the {{messenger}} who had brought it. Savello {{said he had been}} sent back. <b>None</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>had</b> seen letter or messenger; the suspicion seized us too, and Checco asked,-- ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>None</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>had,</b> and {{we waited}} rather restively for {{the passing of}} the musing fit which he fell into. After a while he resumed at a point whose {{relation}} to the matter in hand we could trace: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Probably {{because he}} knows very well that I shall not break my heart over it.

6000|$|... "It means, sir," [...] Ned Sankey said, rising also, [...] "that we are determined, all <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> that we {{will learn}} no more extra tasks. <b>None</b> <b>of</b> <b>us,</b> {{so far as we}} know, ever touched your cat, and {{we are not going to}} submit to be punished any longer for a fault which <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>have</b> committed." ...|$|R

60|$|<b>None</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>had</b> {{heard of}} it then; {{but it was not}} long before it was the best known name in Scotland, and many a time we thought of how he speered his way of us {{on the night of the}} terror.|$|E
6000|$|RUFIO (emphatically--anticipating the question). Whoever did {{it was a}} {{wise man}} {{and a friend of}} yours (Cleopatra is qreatly emboldened); but <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>US</b> <b>had</b> a hand in it. So it is no use to frown at me. (Caesar turns and looks at Cleopatra.) ...|$|E
60|$|COLLINS. I {{think it}} would be as well, my lord, to go on with the {{contract}} while we're waiting. The truth is, we shall <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>have</b> much <b>of</b> a look-in when Mrs George comes; so we had better finish the writing part of the business before she arrives.|$|R
25|$|The film {{suggests}} Scotland {{had been}} under English occupation for some time, at least during Wallace’s childhood, and {{in the run-up to}} the Battle of Falkirk Wallace says to the younger Bruce, “e'll <b>have</b> what <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>have</b> ever had before, a country of our own.” In fact Scotland had been invaded by England only the year before Wallace's rebellion; prior to the death of King Alexander III it had been a fully separate kingdom.|$|R

"He {{will like}} that, and know who sent it, for <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>have</b> pretty pink paper but you, or write such an elegant hand," [...] said Molly, admiring the {{delicate}} white basket {{shaped like a}} lily, with the flowers inside and the note hidden among them, all daintily tied up with the palest blush-colored ribbon.|$|R
