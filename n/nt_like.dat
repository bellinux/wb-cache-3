Importantly, the slight loss in coding gain is negligible compared to the advantage it offers in terms of lowering the ML-decoding complexity. For higher number of transmit antennas, the best known codes are the Perfect codes, which are full-rate, full-diversity, information lossless codes (for n(r) >= n(t)) but have a high ML-decoding complexity of the order of M(ntnmin) (for n(r) = <b>n(t),</b> <b>like</b> the Perfect codes, and allow higher mutual information than the comparable punctured Perfect codes for n(r) < n(t).

The resultant truncated N-terminal fragments of GluR 1, termed NT 1, NT 2, and NT 3 respectively were expressed in Cos- 7 cells and their cellular distribution and cell-surface expression analysed using an N-terminal antibody to GluR 1. All of the fragments were fully glycosylated and were found to be associated with cell membranes but none was secreted. Differential extraction of the cell membranes indicated that both NT 1 and NT 2 behave as peripheral membrane proteins. In contrast <b>NT</b> 3, <b>like</b> the full subunit, has integral membrane protein properties. Furthermore only NT 3 is expressed at the cell surface as determined by immunofluorescence and cell-surface biotinylation. Protease protection assays indicated that only NT 3 had a cytoplasmic tail. Binding studies using the selective ligand [(3) H]alpha-amino- 3 -hydroxy- 5 -methyl- 4 -isoxazolepropionate ([(3) H]AMPA) demonstrated that NT 3 does not bind ligand.

40|$|International audienceAngular phase mixing {{in rapidly}} {{rotating}} or in strongly stratified flows is quantified for single-time single-point energy components, using linear theory. In addition to potential energy, turbulent kinetic energy is more easily analyzed {{in terms of}} its toroidal and poloidal components, and then in terms of vertical and horizontal components. Since the axial symmetry around the direction n (which bears both the system angular velocity and the mean density gradient) is consistent with basic dynamical equations, the input of initial anisotropy is investigated in the axisymmetric case. A general way to construct axisymmetric initial data is used, with a classical expansion in terms of scalar spherical harmonics for the 3 D spectral density of kinetic energy e, and a modified expansion for the polarization anisotropy Z, which reflects the unbalance in terms of poloidal and toroidal energy components. The expansion involves Legendre polynomials of arbitrary order, P 2 n 0 (cos[*]θ), (n = 0, 1, 2, [...] .,N 0), in which the term [cos[*]θ = (k∙n) /∣k∣] characterizes the anisotropy in k-wavespace; two sets of parameters, β 2 n(e) and β 2 n(z), separately generate the directional anisotropy and the polarization anisotropy. In the rotating case, the phase mixing results in damping the polarization anisotropy, so that toroidal and poloidal energy components asymptotically equilibrate after transient oscillations. Complete analytical solutions are found in terms of Bessel functions. The envelope of these oscillations decay with time like (ft) − 2 (f being the Coriolis parameter), whereas those for the vertical and horizontal components decay like (ft) − 3. The long-time limit of the ratio of horizontal component to vertical one depends only on β 2 (e), which is eventually related to a classical component in structure-based modeling, independently of the degree of the expansion of the initial data. For the stratified case, both the degree of initial anisotropy and the initial unbalance in terms of potential and poloidal (or kinetic gravity wave) energy are investigated. The latter unbalance is characterized by a ratio χ/ 2, assuming initial proportionality between the kinetic energy spectrum and the potential energy one. The phase mixing yields asymptotic equipartition in terms of poloidal and potential energy components, and analytical solutions are found in terms of Weber functions. At large time, the damped oscillations for poloidal, potential and vertical components decay with time <b>like</b> (<b>Nt)</b> − 1 / 2 (N is the buoyancy frequency), while the oscillations for the horizontal component decay with time <b>like</b> (<b>Nt)</b> − 3 / 2.

40|$|The {{history of}} early Christian {{architecture}} {{has been presented}} as a gradual, typological transformation from undifferentiated residential buildings {{in the first two}} centuries, to modified residential buildings in the third, culminating in the monumental Constantinian structures of the fourth century. To rationalize this transformation, a great deal of scholarship has focused on identifying formal, cultural, and programmatic characteristics that might link the domus to the basilica. However, along held view is that the basilica, along with all monumental church architecture, is a Roman deviation in the evolution of Christianity. To support this argument, proponents read <b>NT</b> passages <b>like</b> the body/temple metaphor of 1 Cor. 3. 16 - 17 and John 2. 19 - 22 as indicative of a Christian rejection of Roman and Jewish material culture. These contrary aspects of early Christianity, the construction of monumental churches and the tacit rebuke of Roman architecture in Christian texts, have been characterized by Paul Corby Finney as iconic and aniconic. In an effort to better understand early Christian architecture, recent studies employ models from cultural theory and sociology to reveal the broader context of church building, demonstrating similar patterns of architectural development among other cultural groups living within the Empire. Richard Krautheimer and L. Michael White are foremost in this field and they have provided a solid foundation for re-evaluating the evidence. While these seminal archaeological and architectural studies have provided us with a chronology of formal and programmatic developments for the beginnings of Christian architecture, they have done little to help us understand how early Christians came to reconcile the conflicting ontological demands of being the temple in Christ (NT) with building the temple for Christ (Constantine). In this dissertation, I argue that a reconciliation between NT body/temple metaphor and Imperial Architecture, between the aniconic and iconic characteristics of Christianity, is achieved, in part, through a shift in the tenor of the metaphor that occurs through the second, third, and fourth centuries. The trajectory of this shift is traced from sources in the Gospels and Epistles through the Epistle of Barnabas, Clement of Alexandria, and Origen to the panegyric written by Eusebius for the commemoration of Paulinus' church at Tyre in 317. I conclude that the metaphorical vehicle of the body/temple, first used rhetorically to unify and segregate the Christian community, has a hermeneutic function that reveals an architectural model in Christ Logos...|$|R
40|$|Trypanosoma brucei {{subspecies}} undergo {{establishment and}} maturation in tsetse flies mid-gut and salivary glands, respectively. Successful establishment of trypanosomes in tsetse mid-gut {{as well as}} their migration to saliva gland depends on the ability of these parasites to adapt rapidly to new environmental conditions and to negotiate the physical barriers. To identify subspecies specific genes which are differentially regulated during the establishment of T. brucei subspecies in tsetse flies mid-gut, a comparative genomic analysis between different T. brucei subspecies was performed using microarrays containing about 23 040 T. brucei shotgun fragments. The whole genome analyses of RNA expression profiles revealed about 274 significantly differentially expressed genes between T. brucei subspecies. About 7 % of the differentially regulated clones did not match to any T. brucei predicted genes. Most of the differentially regulated transcripts are involved in transport across cell membrane and also in the purines metabolism. The genes selectively up regulated in T. brucei gambiense and T. brucei rhodesiense (human infective T. brucei) like snoRNA and HSP 70 are expressed in response to stress. The high failure rate in the process of establishment and maturation of T. brucei gambiense during cyclical transmission in tsetse flies may result from the incapacity of this parasite to regulate its growth due to the expression of a variety of chaperones or heat shock proteins. Genes selectively up regulated in T. brucei brucei <b>like</b> <b>NT</b> 8. 1 nucleoside/nucleobase transporters and S-adenosylmethionine synthetase may favour the establishment of this subspecies in tsetse mid-gut.

We argue that this mediation can be represented at three levels by thesauri. At the first level, thesauri are sets of indexes apparently coordinating the possible searches by means of term to term relations <b>like</b> <b>NT</b> (narrower term) and RT (related term). At an higher level, persons to terms relations are consequent {{to the use of}} thesauri for indexing and retrieval, while person to person relations are embodied into a thesaurus via the implicit representation of the organisation it serves. In this way, thesauri constitute a network of mediation having historical, social and - because of the scientific community served - scientific and technological perspectives. These three perspectives are embedded in time, since changes in organisation change the person to person relations, change in retrieval and indexing needs change the person to term relations and changes in document types, aims of the organization and progress in science change term to term relations. In particular, we want to analyse the network originally proposed by the EURATOM thesaurus [EUR] and the network of relations ¿ in the three perspectives above - it assumed. Subsequently, we compare the results of this analysis with a more recent thesaurus designed for a community very close to the one originating the EURATOM thesaurus.

40|$|UPPER GASTROINTESTINAL MOTILITY, GUT HORMONES AND FOOD INTAKE A {{study in}} normal weight and obese humans Erik Näslund Division of Surgery, Danderyd Hospital and the Section of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Department of Intemal Medicine, Karolinska Hospital, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden The {{regulation}} of food intake in man {{is complex and}} poorly understood. The main aim {{of the present study}} was to investigate how a rapid stimulation of the distal small bowel with nutrients influences upper gastrointestinal motility, some gut peptides and food intake in man. Therefore, fasting small bowel motility, gastric emptying, plasma and intraduodenal levels of some neuropeptides, plasma levels of cholecystokinin (CCK), motilin (MOT), neurotensin (<b>NT),</b> glucagon <b>like</b> peptide- I (GLP- 1) and peptide YY (PYY) were studied in lean, obese, and obese subjects nine months and 20 years after jejunoileal bypass (JIB). Plasma levels of MOT, but not the studied neuropeptides showed a cyclic variation in synchrony with the different phases of the migrating motor complex (MMC). In contrast, intraduodenal levels of somatostatin, vasoactive intestinal peptide, substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide showed a peak immediately before or at phase III of the MMC. No difference was found in fasting motility between obese and lean subjects. After JIB, there were fewer phase III recorded during 5 hours than before surgery. Of the gut peptides studied only fasting levels of PYY were elevated suggesting that PYY may be involved in the regulation of fasting motility in man after JIB. The rate of gastric emptying was faster in obese subjects than in lean controls. The obese subjects also had a decreased postprandial response of plasma CCK and GLP- I. Whether the faster rate of gastric emptying and weaker GLP- 1 and CCK response in the obese subjects is a cause or consequence of the obese state is not clear. After JIB the rate of gastric emptying was slower than before surgery and similar to that in lean controls. Plasma levels of GLP-l, NT and PYY were elevated after surgery suggesting that an ileal brake on upper gut motility is in effect after JIB. ln subjects operated with JIB a mean of twenty years earlier, both fasting and postprandial plasma levels of all the gut peptides studied were higher than in lean subjects and in subjects nine months after JIB. However, no difference was seen in the rate of gastric emptying between non-operated obese and obese subjects 20 years after JIB. This suggests that a down-regulation of the ileal brake occurs after long time stimulation of the distal ileum with nutrients. All the obese subjects lost weight after surgery and showed a decreased energy intake, diminished desire to eat, and diminished preference for high carbohydrate foods. Thus, it is likely that a rapid stimulation of the ileum influences food intake by elevating gut peptide levels and by inhibiting upper gastrointestinal motility. The fewer phase III of the MMC and slower rate of gastric emptying may contribute to increased satiety by a stronger and longer activation of mechano- and chemoreceptors in the stomach and upper small intestine. In addition, the postprandial elevated distal gut peptide concentrations may directly inhibit the feeding centers in the brain and decrease food intake.
