40|$|It is in {{the area}} of the {{regulation}} of a company's share capital and distributions to shareholders that the inherent conflict between creditors and shareholders, and the fragile balance among shareholders internally, intersect. The share capital of a company underlies its corporate structure and represents not only its initial own funds from which creditors can be paid, but also the relative equity interests of the shareholders. The balance between shareholders can be disturbed by capital reorganisations through increase, reduction or variation of share capital or through disproportionate contributions by, or distributions to, shareholders. Share repurchases are particularly risky in this regard. Creditor interests are affected when their prior right to payment is endangered by distributions to shareholders. This study analyses the South African Law relating to share capital and distributions against the background of a comparative study of the laws of England, New Zealand, Delaware and California, as well as the provisions of the American Model Business Corporations Act. Two main approaches to creditor protection are evident. The capital maintenance doctrine, which is followed in England and Delaware, protects creditors by emphasising the <b>notional</b> <b>share</b> capital of the company as a limit on distributions. In contrast, the solvency and liquidity approach focuses on the net assets of the company and on its ability to pay its debts. New Zealand, California and the Model Business Corporations Act represent this approach. Regulatory responses to shareholder protection range from insistence on compliance with procedural requirements to minimal statutory intervention in the internal affairs of companies, instead relying on general principles of fairness and good faith. There is little correlation between a particular system's approach to creditor protection on the one hand, and to shareholder protection on the other. England, New Zealand and South Africa prescribe specific formalities, while the American approach is more relaxed. South Africa is a hybrid system. Its transition from capital maintenance to solvency and liquidity has been incomplete and its protection of equity interests is relatively unsophisticated. A number of recommendations are made for an effective and coherent approach that will safeguard the interests of creditors and shareholders alike. School: LawLL. D...|$|E
50|$|Malayness (Kemelayuan Jawi: كملايوان) is a {{term used}} to {{describe}} the state of being Malay, or of embodying Malay characteristics, and is used to refer to that which binds and distinguishes the Malay people and forms the basis of their unity and identity. People who call themselves Malay are found in many countries in Southeast Asia, united by a <b>notional</b> <b>shared</b> identity but divided by political boundaries, divergent histories, variant dialects and peculiarities of local experience. While the term 'Malay' is widely used and readily understood in the region, it remains open to varying interpretations due to its varied and fluid characteristics. 'Malay' as an identity, or nationality, is considered {{as one of the most}} challenging and perplexing concepts in the multi-ethnic world of Southeast Asia.|$|R

The research is primarily focused on particular representatives of architecture, on their work and subsequently on responses to them abroad. The development of architecture is seen in the context of a historical framework which consists of the critical milestones of our history. Social, ecological, political and cultural determinants, which are presented on the basis of the historical framework, affect architecture as a material expression and a tangible artefact of a particular society. The research is represented by two seemingly self-contained evolutionary lines of Czechoslovak and Dutch achitectures. The evolutionary lines are connected by the personages of Czech or Dutch architecture or by the leaders of European avant-garde. Description of the avant-garde art associations and societies, which are the prime movers and innovators, constitute a significant part of this work. A <b>notional</b> <b>shared</b> peak of Czechoslovak and [...] ...|$|R
50|$|Ordinary shares entitle {{the owner}} to {{a share in}} the company's net profit. It is {{calculated}} in the following way: the net profit is divided {{by the total number of}} owned <b>shares,</b> producing a <b>notional</b> value per <b>share,</b> known as a dividend. An individual's share of the profit is thus the dividend multiplied by the number of shares owned.|$|R
50|$|A {{dividend}} swap is an over-the-counter financial {{derivative contract}} (in particular {{a form of}} swap). It consists {{of a series of}} payments made between two parties at defined intervals over a fixed term (e.g., annually over 5 years). One party - the holder of the fixed leg - will pay its counterparty a pre-designated fixed payment at each interval. The other party - the holder of the floating leg - will pay its counterparty the total dividends that were paid out by a selected underlying, which can be a single company, a basket of companies, or all the members of an index. The payments are multiplied by a <b>notional</b> number of <b>shares.</b>|$|R
40|$|In this paper, I {{will discuss}} the usage of {{personal}} affixes in the so-called wa an construction in the Ainu language. All my data in this paper is from the Saru and Chitose dialects of Hokkaido Ainu. The wa an construction is used to express the resultative aspect with various verbs, regardless of their transitivity, describing a change of state or location of any kind. It is placed after the predicate of a sentence. The wa an construction consists of a clausal conjunction wa ‘and’ and existential verb an ‘to be(come) /to exist’. The subject of the an verb can be coreferential either with the subject or object of the first (=notional) verb. In {{the case of an}} intransitive notional verb, the subject of the an verb is coreferential with the subject of the <b>notional</b> verb and <b>shares</b> with it the same subject marking, but if the notional verb is transitive, there are two possible patterns of agreement to follow. The subject of an can be coreferential with the object of the notional verb and then it does not share the same subject marking with the notional verb (the first verb’s object is the second verb’s subject). The criteria of determining which pattern is to be applied is semantic, namely the affectedness of the subject. If the subject is affected by the change of state or location expressed by the verb, the an verb of wa an will take the same subject agreement as that of the first verb, otherwise the subject agreement will be {{different from that of the}} first verb. Nakagawa (1981) stated that certain transitive verbs which can be used with the wa an construction allow only the subject agreement pattern. However, while investigating examples of the wa an construction from data collected by Tamura (1984 - 1989), I managed to find a few examples of transitive verbs that Nakagawa (1981) described as allowing only the subject agreement pattern, and found out that most of the examples in fact followed the object agreement pattern. In addition to this, I also found an extraordinary example of an intransitive verb that does not agree with its subject. In this paper, I examine these examples in detail and discuss their possible implications for interpreting the wa an construction. I also point out the possibility that the non-agreeing example of an intransitive verb could be explained by the concept of inalienable possession...|$|R
