50|$|Although MCA cards cost {{nearly double}} the price of {{comparable}} non-MCA cards, the marketing stressed that it was simple for any user to upgrade or add more cards to their PC, thus saving the considerable expense of a technician. In this critical area, Micro Channel architecture's biggest advantage was also its greatest disadvantage, {{and one of the}} major reasons for its demise. To add a new card (video, printer, memory, <b>network,</b> <b>modem,</b> etc.) the user simply plugged in the MCA card and inserted a customized floppy disk (that came with the PC) to blend the new card into the original hardware automatically, rather than bringing in an expensive trained technician who could manually make all the needed changes. All choices for interrupts (an often perplexing problem) and other changes were accomplished automatically by the PC reading the old configuration from the floppy disk, which made necessary changes in software, then wrote the new configuration to the floppy disk. In practice, however, this meant that the user must keep that same floppy disk matched to that PC. For a small company with a few PCs, this was annoying, but practical. But for large organizations with hundreds or even thousands of PCs, permanently matching each PC with its own floppy disk was logistically unlikely or impossible. Without the original, updated floppy disk, no changes could be made to the PC's cards. After this experience repeated itself thousands of times, business leaders realized their dream scenario for upgrade simplicity did not work in the corporate world, and they sought a better process.|$|E

40|$|The {{relevance}} {{of this study}} is determined by the rapid development in the portable computer and wireless data transmission technologies. Modern working and living environments have become abundant in radiofrequency electromagnetic fields. This article investigates the effectiveness of intervention measures to reduce laptop computer user’s exposure to the radiofrequency electromagnetic field from wireless networking. Different exposure reduction solutions using 2 G, 3 G, 4 G wireless network modems are studied. Intervention measures include: 1) selecting an area with better wireless network reception and 2) placing the <b>network</b> <b>modem</b> away from the user at different distances. The results show the greatest reduction in exposure when the wireless modem was placed outside the workplace, away from the line of sight. The reception quality also played a determining role in the output power of the computer’s wireless modem.

40|$|Recent {{underwater}} {{sensor network}} {{research has focused}} on developing physical, medium access control, and network layer protocols to enable high data rate, energy-efficient and reliable acoustic communications. However, it is now essen-tial to design and standardize architectures that will enhance the usability and interoperability of underwater networks. This paper proposes a networking architecture to effi-ciently provide interoperability with traditional TCP/IP pro-tocol stacks for commercial underwater modems. The pro-posal is based on an adaptation layer located between the data link layer and the network layer, such that the origi-nal TCP/IP network and transport layers are preserved un-altered to the maximum extent. The adaptation layer per-forms header compression and data fragmentation to guar-antee energy efficiency. Furthermore, the proposed archi-tecture includes mechanisms for auto-configuration based on router proxies that can avoid human-in-the-loop and save en-ergy when broadcast is needed. The proposed architectural framework was implemented as a Linux device driver for a commercial underwater <b>network</b> <b>modem</b> SM- 75 by Teledyne Benthos. Testing and simulation results illustrate that the ar-chitecture efficiently provides interoperability with TCP/IP. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper investigates a {{multi-mode}} MAC {{protocol suite}} {{for use in}} a heterogeneous underwater <b>network.</b> <b>Modems</b> from different manufacturers may employ different physical layers and MAC protocols. If multiple modems operating in the same or overlapping frequency bands are deployed in the same geographic area, they cannot function correctly due to interference. We propose a mechanism to achieve co-existence and communication among such heterogeneous assets. Co-existence is defined as the state where modems of the same type can communicate with each other while minimizing interference with other types. The Communications state is when all modems in one area can communicate with each other. Alien signals are defined as non-decipherable communication signals for any one modem type. The Co-existence mode requires all modems to implement an alien signal detection feature. In this mode, a CSMA based scheme will be used to communicate among modems of the same type, if alien signals are detected, and to allow non-interfering co-existence among different modem types. In order to achieve Communications mode, modems will be required to implement a standardized Physical Layer (along with their proprietary Physical Layer or as the only system and o...|$|R
