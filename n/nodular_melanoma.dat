40|$|To {{assess the}} {{clinical}} value of two comparatively new properties (DNA content and MHC class II antigen expression (HLA-DR, DP, DQ) of melanoma cells) {{which have been}} independently reported to reflect the outlook for patients with malignant melanoma, we investigated retrospectively 50 stage I <b>nodular</b> <b>melanomas</b> in two comparably homogeneous groups of 23 and 27 patients, the course of whose disease differed at five years.

A close association was found between class II antigen expression, detected by monoclonal antibody CR 3 / 43 (antimonomorphic DR, DP, DQ) present in 23 of 50 (46 %) melanomas and unfavourable clinical course (p less than 0. 005, by log rank test), but no such association was found for DNA ploidy. It is suggested that immunohistology for MHC class II antigen expression may help to predict the behaviour of <b>nodular</b> <b>melanomas</b> whereas the prognostic value of DNA ploidy is more limited.

40|$|Objective: To {{examine the}} {{relationship}} between melanoma thickness and reported time from first recognition and from first physician contact to the diagnosis of invasive melanoma. Design: Telephone survey of patients recently diagnosed as having melanoma, combined with relevant pathological data (including melanoma thickness and morphologic structure) from the population-based Queensland Cancer Registry. A test-retest study (n= 176) was also conducted. Setting: Population-based study in Queensland. Participants: Residents of Queensland (n= 3772) who had been diagnosed as having invasive melanoma between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2003. Main Outcome Measures: Prepresentation time (time between first noticing a suspicious spot and the first physician visit), postpresentation time (time between the first physician visit and diagnosis), and total time to diagnosis (time from initial detection of the melanoma to diagnosis). Results: With 1 exception, we found no significant association between melanoma thickness and reported time to diagnosis for all melanomas combined, superficial spreading <b>melanomas,</b> or <b>nodular</b> <b>melanomas.</b> The exception was a positive association between melanoma thickness and postpresentation delay of physiciandetected <b>nodular</b> <b>melanomas.</b> The reliability study gave intraclass correlation coefficients of 0. 85 to 0. 90 for the measures of intervals. Conclusions: This large study demonstrates no clear relationship between the melanoma thickness when diagnosed and the time from first recognition of changes or from first physician examination to diagnosis. This may be because of varying biological characteristics of melanomas, as well as methodological limitations of retrospective studies when trying to measure this complex association. © 2006 American Medical Association.

5000|$|<b>Nodular</b> <b>melanoma</b> (NM) is {{the most}} {{aggressive}} form of melanoma. It tends to grow more rapidly in thickness (penetrate the skin) than in diameter.

NM is most often darkly pigmented; however, some NM lesions can be light brown, multicolored or even colorless (non-pigmented).

40|$|Dermoscopy is a {{non-invasive}} procedure {{that allows the}} evaluation of cutaneous lesions, and {{is considered to be}} a useful tool that improves the diagnostic accuracy of melanoma. Many dermoscopic criteria of melanoma have been established and several algorithms have been created for melanoma detection. However, the recognition of some melanomas remains challenging. Melanomas on specific body sites, melanomas in patients with multiple atypical moles, and <b>nodular</b> <b>melanomas</b> represent the most difficult-to-recognize melanoma subtypes, since they typically lack the “classic” melanoma-specific criteria.

40|$|Melanosomes {{without the}} {{characteristic}} structure of normal melanocytes {{have been found}} in experimental <b>melanomas</b> and human <b>nodular</b> <b>melanomas</b> (1 - 3). They are associated with a unique type of premelanosome, the granular body (1, 2, 4, 5). Melanosomes and premelanosomes in melanomas are tyrosinase positive, but {{it has been shown that}} they also contain lysosomal enzymes (6 - 8). Novikoff et al. (6) proposed that melanosomes are modified lysosomes which tend to break down melanin in "melanosome-complexes " (5, 9) and become large autophagosomes, supporting an earlier view based on Drochman's observations (10), but no physiochemical evidence of melanin degradation has been reported. In order to investigate the unusual pigmentation system, we examined the ultrastructure of four cell lines established from a transplantable hamster melanoma associated with a R-type virus (1, 11). These clones differ in degree of melanogenesis and virus formation. One clone (MB line) closely resembled the most predominant cell found in the tumor in vivo (1).

Whichever method we used, a significant difference was found between the pooled mean AgNOR numbers for benign and malignant lesions. We found an overlap, however, between benign, in particular Spitz and dysplastic nevi, and malignant lesions when considering individual counts of AgNOR using both methods. We conclude that studying AgNOR does not seem to be a useful technique to differentiate Spitz and dysplastic nevi from malignant melanomas...|$|R

50|$|Often, {{this disease}} evolves from a {{precursor}} lesion, usually a dysplastic nevus. Otherwise it arises in previously normal skin.

40|$|<b>Nodular</b> <b>melanoma</b> is {{the most}} {{aggressive}} subtype of melanoma, with rapid growth rate and metastatic potential.

Missing the diagnosis of <b>nodular</b> <b>melanoma</b> is a dermatologist’s worst nightmare, especially since nodular melanomas can have a non-alarming clinical appearance and imitate {{a wide range of}} benign lesions. All evolving nodular lesions, despite their size, symmetry, and color, which cannot be confidently diagnosed as benign, should be excised in order to rule out <b>nodular</b> <b>melanoma.</b> Almost all melanoma-specific dermoscopic criteria are described in context of superficial spreading melanoma.

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown {{frequent}} mutations in the BRAF (V-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B 1) or NRAS (neuroblastoma RAS viral [V-ras] oncogene homolog) genes in cutaneous melanoma, but {{the relationship between these}} alterations and tumor cell proliferation has not been examined in human melanoma. In our study of 51 primary <b>nodular</b> <b>melanomas</b> and 18 paired metastases, we found mutations in BRAF (codon 600, previously denoted 599) in 15 primary tumors (29 %) and eight metastases (44 %). The figures for NRAS mutations were 27 % and 22 %, respectively. Mutations in BRAF and NRAS genes were mutually exclusive in all but one case, and were maintained from primary tumors through their metastases. Mutations, however, were not associated with tumor cell proliferation by Ki- 67 expression, tumor thickness, microvessel density, or vascular invasion, and there were no differences in patient survival. Although BRAF and NRAS mutations are likely to be important for the initiation and maintenance of some melanomas, other factors might be more significant for proliferation and prognosis in subgroups of aggressive melanoma...|$|R
