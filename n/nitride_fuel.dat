50|$|According to Hyperion, {{the uranium}} <b>nitride</b> <b>fuel</b> {{incorporated}} in the design is generally similar in physical characteristics and neutronics to the standard ceramic uranium oxide fuel that is used at present in modern light water nuclear reactors. However, it has certain beneficial traits - higher thermal conductivity - and thus less retained heat energy - that make it preferable over oxide fuels when used at temperature regimes that are greater than the 250 to 300 C temperatures found in light water reactors. By operating at higher temperatures, steam plants can operate at a higher thermal efficiency. The presentation by Hyperion at the ANS 2009 conference mentions {{the use of the}} Doppler inherent negative temperature coefficient of reactivity in this reactor as a means of control. Nuclear scientist Alexander Sesonske avers that nitride fuels have both received very little development (as of 1973) and seem to have a very favorable combination of physical properties - especially in fast reactors. Whether this carries over to lead-bismuth cooled reactors is a question not answered in the reviewed literature, though the Soviet Union has worked with this type of reactor before in naval service; in particular, the Alfa class submarine - well known in the West for its high speed operation - was driven by such a lead-bismuth reactor which is known to have worked very effectively.|$|E

40|$|This study {{assesses the}} neutronic, thermal-hydraulic, and fuel {{performance}} aspects of using <b>nitride</b> <b>fuel</b> {{in place of}} oxides in Pu-based high conversion light water reactor designs. Using the higher density <b>nitride</b> <b>fuel</b> hardens the neutron energy spectrum and results in higher breeding ratios. The state-of-the-art high conversion light water reactor, the Resource-renewable Boiling Water Reactor (RBWR), served as the template core upon which comparative studies between nitride and oxide fuels were performed. A 1 / 3 core reactor physics model was developed for the RBWR using the stochastic transport code MCNP. The code was coupled with a lumped channel thermal-hydraulics 5 -channel model for steady-state analyses. The depletion code MCODE, which links MCNP with ORIGEN, was used for all burnup calculations. Select physics parameters were calculated and {{with the exception of}} the void coefficients, agreed with reported data. The void coefficients of the coupled core were calculated to be slightly positive using two different methods (10 % power increase and 5 % flow reduction). The standard RBWR assembly designs, which use tight lattice hexagonal fuel rod arrays, with oxide fuel were then replaced with various <b>nitride</b> <b>fuel</b> assembly designs to determine the potential increase in breeding ratio, the potential to breed with pressurized water, and the potential to improve the critical power ratio with a wider pin pitch. Without changing the assembly geometry or discharge burnup, using <b>nitride</b> <b>fuel</b> resulted in a breeding ratio of 1. 14. Using single-phase liquid water, the <b>nitride</b> <b>fuel</b> RBWR assembly resulted in a conversion ratio of 1. 00. Another <b>nitride</b> <b>fuel</b> assembly design with boiling water maintained a 1. 04 breeding ratio while increasing the pitch-to-diameter ratio from 1. 13 to 1. 20. This modification increased the hot assembly critical power ratio from 1. 22 to 1. 36, as calculated using the Liu- 2007 correlation. A high-porosity <b>nitride</b> <b>fuel</b> is recommended for high burnup conditions, to accommodate the nitride fuel’s higher swelling and less favorable mechanical properties compared to the oxide fuel. The high porosity allows additional volume for pressure-induced densification, alleviating swelling and subsequent cladding strain. To predict the performance of high-porosity <b>nitride</b> <b>fuel,</b> fission gas and fuel behavior mechanistic models were developed for high burnup and low-temperature conditions. These models were validated with reported irradiation data and implemented, along with fuel material properties, into the steady-state fuel behavior code FRAPCON-EP. Under simulated RBWR conditions, a fuel density no more than 85 % of theoretical density is recommended to maintain satisfactory fuel performance.

40|$|The US National Energy Policy of 2001 {{advocated}} {{the development of}} advanced fuel and fuel cycle technologies that are cleaner, more efficient, less waste-intensive, and more proliferation resistant. The need for advanced fuel development is emphasized in on-going DOE-supported programs, e. g., Global Nuclear Energy Initiative (GNEI), Advanced Fuel Cycle Initiative (AFCI), and GEN-IV Technology Development. The Directorates of Energy & Environment (E&E) and Chemistry & Material Sciences (C&MS) at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) are interested in advanced fuel research and manufacturing using its multi-disciplinary capability and facilities to support a design concept of a small, secure, transportable, and autonomous reactor (SSTAR). The E&E and C&MS Directorates co-sponsored this Laboratory Directed Research & Development (LDRD) Project on Mono-Uranium <b>Nitride</b> <b>Fuel</b> Development for SSTAR and Space Applications. In fact, three out of the six GEN-IV reactor concepts consider using the nitride-based fuel, as shown in Table 1. SSTAR is a liquid-metal cooled, fast reactor. It uses <b>nitride</b> <b>fuel</b> in a sealed reactor vessel that could be shipped to the user {{and returned to the}} supplier having never been opened in its long operating lifetime. This sealed reactor concept envisions no fuel refueling nor on-site storage of spent fuel, and as a result, can greatly enhance proliferation resistance. However, the requirement for a sealed, long-life core imposes great challenges to research and development of the <b>nitride</b> <b>fuel</b> and its cladding. Cladding is an important interface between the fuel and coolant and a barrier to prevent fission gas release during normal and accidental conditions. In fabricating the <b>nitride</b> <b>fuel</b> rods and assemblies, the cladding material should be selected based on its the coolant-side corrosion properties, the chemical/physical interaction with the <b>nitride</b> <b>fuel,</b> as well as their thermal and neutronic properties. The US NASA space reactor, the SP- 100 was designed to use mono-uranium <b>nitride</b> <b>fuel.</b> Although the SP- 100 reactor was not commissioned, tens of thousand of <b>nitride</b> <b>fuel</b> pellets were manufactured and lots of them, cladded in Nb- 1 -Zr had been irradiated in fast test reactors (FFTF and EBR-II) with good irradiation results. The Russian Naval submarines also use <b>nitride</b> <b>fuel</b> with stainless steel cladding (HT- 9) in Pb-Bi coolant. Although the operating experience of the Russian submarine is not readily available, such combination of fuel, cladding and coolant has been proposed for a commercial-size liquid-metal cooled fast reactor (BREST- 300). Uranium mono-nitride fuel is studied in this LDRD Project due to its favorable properties such as its high actinide density and high thermal conductivity. The thermal conductivity of mono-nitride is 10 times higher than that of oxide (23 W/m-K for UN vs. 2. 3 W/m-K for UO{sub 2 } at 1000 K) and its melting temperature is much higher than that of metal fuel (2630 C for UN vs. 1132 C for U metal). It also has relatively high actinide density, (13. 51 gU/cm{sup 3 } in UN vs. 9. 66 gU/cm{sup 3 } in UO{sub 2 }) which is essential for a compact reactor core design. The objective of this LDRD Project is to: (1) Establish a manufacturing capability for uranium-based ceramic nuclear fuel, (2) Develop a computational capability to analyze nuclear fuel performance, (3) Develop a modified UN-based fuel that can support a compact long-life reactor core, and (4) Collaborate with the Nuclear Engineering Department of UC Berkeley on <b>nitride</b> <b>fuel</b> reprocessing and disposal in a geologic repository...|$|E

40|$|Abstract During {{operation}} of a fourth generation reactor system it is necessarily not desirable to utilize an oxide fuel matrix as in light water reactor systems. One type of chemical compounds that has been suggested is nitride based nuclear fuel. Nitride fuels possess several characteristics that make them interesting for reactor operation such as high melting point, high thermal conductivity and better chemical compatibility compared to oxides with liquid metal coolants such as sodium or lead. <b>Nitride</b> <b>fuel</b> can be produced either as pure actinide <b>nitride</b> <b>fuel</b> such as UN or as fuel where the fissile material is diluted in an inert matrix such as (Zr, Pu) N. A problem with <b>nitride</b> <b>fuel</b> is the production process. Nitrides are not stable in air and production must thus be performed under inert atmosphere to reduce oxygen uptake in the material. Also residual oxygen and carbon content from production and processing {{is an issue that}} needs to be addressed. Spontaneous oxidation in air together with radiological safety concern regarding handling fine powders of actinide nitrides such as PuN for example provides an incitement for evaluating potential dust free processes for <b>nitride</b> <b>fuel</b> production. Work has been performed on production of ZrN as an inert fuel matrix by the internal sol gel process and subsequent carbothermal reduction. Elemental carbon suspension sols have been produced and gelled into microspheres. Heat treatments of the produced microspheres in N 2 + 5 % H 2 gas mixture was performed during nitridation. Elemental investigation of the produced microspheres suggested an approximate composition of Zr(N 0. 7 0. 8 C 0. 2 0. 3).

In this time several key obstacles have been identied as impeding the implementation of these fuels for commercial applications; namely chemical interactions with air and steam, the noted diculty in sintering of the material, and the high costs associated with the enrichment of 15 N. The combination of these limitations, historically, led to the well founded conclusion that the most appropriate use of <b>nitride</b> <b>fuels</b> was in the fast reactor fuel cycle, where the cost burdens associated with them is substantially less. Indeed, it is within this context that the vast majority of work on nitrides has been and continues to be done. Nevertheless, following the 2011 Fukushima-Daiichi nuclear accident, a concerted governmental-industrial eort was embarked upon to explore the alternatives of so-called tolerant" and performance" fuels.

Application of ADS allows to safely transmute large fractions of minor actinides (MA) per reactor core, while the fraction in critical reactors {{is limited to}} a few percent due to the safety constraints. Additional imposed costs of ADS introduction into the nuclear fuel cycle can be decreased by improving their effciency, particularly the external source effciency. Design of the European Facility for Industrial Transmutation (EFIT) with transuranium (TRU) oxide fuel has been recently developed in the frame of  the EUROTRANS project.

In these concepts, not beingcompatible with water is not a significant problem. However, in recent years,nitride fuels started to raise an interest for application in thermal reactors,as accident tolerant or high performance fuels. However, oxide fuels havebenefited from decades of intensive research, and thousands of reactor-years. As such, a large effort has to be made on qualifying the fuel and developingtools to help assess their performances. In this thesis, the modeling side of this task is chosen. The effort istwo-fold: determining fundamental properties using atomistic models andputting together all the properties to predict the performances under irradi-ation using a fuel performance code. The first part is done combining manyframeworks. The density functional theory is the basis to compute the elec-tronic structure of the materials, to which a Hubbard correction is added tohandle the strong correlation effects. Negative side effects of the Hubbardcorrection are tackled using the so-called occupation matrix control method. This combined framework is first tested, and then used to find electronic andmechanic properties of the bulk material as well as the thermomechanicalbehavior of foreign atoms. Then, another method, the self-consistent meanfield (SCMF) one, is used to reach the dynamics properties of these foreignatoms. In the SCMF theory, the data that were obtained performing the abinitio simulations are treated to provide diffusion and kinetic flux couplingproperties. In the second step of the work, the fuel performance code TRANSURA-NUS is used to model complete fuel pins.

40|$|The project uses an {{exothermic}} combustion synthesis reaction, termed self-propagating high-temperature synthesis (SHS), {{to produce}} high quality, reproducible <b>nitride</b> <b>fuels</b> and other ceramic type nuclear fuels (cercers and cermets, etc.) {{in conjunction with}} the fabrication of transmutation fuels. The major research objective of the project is determining the fundamental SHS processing parameters by first using manganese as a surrogate for americium to produce dense Zr-Mn-N ceramic compounds. These fundamental principles will then be transferred to the production of dense Zr-Am-N ceramic materials. A further research objective in the research program is generating fundamental SHS processing data to the synthesis of (i) Pu-Am-Zr-N and (ii) U-Pu-Am-N ceramic fuels. In this case, Ce will be used as the surrogate for Pu, Mn as the surrogate for Am, and depleted uranium as the surrogate for U. Once sufficient fundamental data has been determined for these surrogate systems, the information will be transferred to Idaho National Laboratory (INL) for synthesis of Zr-Am-N, Pu-Am-Zr-N and U-Pu-Am-N ceramic fuels. The high vapor pressures of americium (Am) and americium nitride (AmN) are cause for concern in producing <b>nitride</b> ceramic nuclear <b>fuel</b> that contains Am. Along with the problem of Am retention during the sintering phases of current processing methods, are additional concerns of producing a consistent product of desirable homogeneity, density and porosity. Similar difficulties have been experienced during the laboratory scale process development stage of producing metal alloys containing Am wherein compact powder sintering methods had to be abandoned. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop a low-temperature or low–heat fuel fabrication process for the synthesis of Am-containing ceramic fuels. Self-propagating high temperature synthesis (SHS), also called combustion synthesis, offers such an alternative process for the synthesis of Am <b>nitride</b> <b>fuels.</b> Although SHS takes thermodynamic advantage of the high combustion temperatures of these exothermic SHS reactions to synthesize the required compounds, the very fast heating, reaction and cooling rates can kinetically generate extremely fast reaction rates and facilitate the retention of volatile species within the rapidly propagating SHS reaction front. The initial objective of the research program is to use Mn as the surrogate for Am to synthesize a reproducible, dense, high quality Zr-Mn-N ceramic compound. Having determined the fundamental SHS reaction parameters and optimized SHS processing steps using Mn as the surrogate for Am, the technology will be transferred to Idaho National Laboratory to successfully synthesize a high quality Zr-Am-N ceramic fuel...|$|R
