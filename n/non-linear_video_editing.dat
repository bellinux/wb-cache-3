For example, Phil South inserted single, completely white frames into his work No Licence to enhance the visual impact of explosions. In the post-production of , Rooster Teeth Productions added letterboxing with Adobe Premiere Pro to hide the camera player's head-up display.|$|E

50|$|The Fanimatrix {{was filmed}} in New Zealand. With an {{estimated}} budget of $800NZ ($500US), {{most of which}} spent on wardrobe and props, the fan film was shot on a single CCD Sony camcorder on DV tape.

The fight sequences were choreographed using the same Wushu martial arts system used in the feature films. Several members of the local stunt industry assisted in the fight sequences and wire-work.

50|$|Many <b>video</b> <b>non-linear</b> <b>editing</b> systems use {{stabilization}} filters {{that can}} correct a non-stabilized image by tracking {{the movement of}} pixels in the image and correcting the image by moving the frame. The process is similar to digital image stabilization but {{since there is no}} larger image to work with the filter either crops the image down to hide the motion of the frame or attempts to recreate the lost image at the edge through spatial or temporal extrapolation.|$|R

We present methods for keyframe selection based on two criteria: capturing the similarity to the represented segment, and preserving the differences from other segment keyframes, so that different segments will have visually distinct representations. We present two discriminative keyframe selection methods, and an example of experimental results. 1...|$|R

50|$|Avid Media Composer is a {{film and}} <b>video</b> <b>non-linear</b> <b>editing</b> system (NLE) and is the {{flagship}} product of Avid Technology. Initially released in 1989 on the Macintosh II as an offline editing system, the application has since evolved to allow for both offline and online film editing, including uncompressed standard definition (SD) video, high definition (HD), 2K and 4K editing and finishing. Since the early 1990s, Media Composer has been the dominant non-linear editing system in the film and television industry, first on Mac and then also on Windows. The Avid Newscutter, aimed at newsrooms, Avid Symphony, aimed at finishing, are all Avid products that were derived from Media Composer and share similar interfacing, as were Avid Xpress Pro (discontinued in 2008) and its predecessor Avid Xpress DV, which were aimed {{at the lower end}} of the market.|$|R
5000|$|... iMovie '08 (Version 7.0) was {{released}} in August 2007 {{as a part of}} the iLife '08 suite. iMovie '08 was a complete redesign and rewrite of iMovie. It had much better HD output, and more formats to convert to. This was limited, however, by an undocumented restriction on supported codecs. iPhoto uses the QuickTime library and can create thumbnails for all QuickTime supported formats, but most of these cannot be used by iMovie '08. Some of the formats that iMovie '08 is able to import will not be recognized when they are added to an iPhoto library. Though Motion JPEG-encoded AVI files do appear to be recognized, this was the most common format used by digital cameras. The tile-based editing interface was also promoted as something unique and groundbreaking, even though it is functionally identical to the interface of the Toaster Flyer <b>non-linear</b> digital <b>video</b> <b>editing</b> systems released for Amiga computers by NewTek, Inc. in 1993. A new feature called [...] "skimming" [...] for quickly previewing video in the library at a user controlled speed was added, and so was a feature that allows the user to highlight parts of video clips just like highlighting text. iMovie 08 also had the ability to add more than two layers of background sound, including multiple music, narration and sound effects; previous versions could play multiple tracks but could display only two extra audio tracks. It included more exportation formats, including iPhone-sized video. It also supported non-tape-based HD video, such as AVCHD and footage from DVD and HDD camcorders. iMovie '08 also has the ability to export movies to the YouTube video sharing website.|$|R

Modern web-based editing systems can take video directly from a camera phone over a GPRS or 3G mobile connection, and editing can take place through a web browser interface, so, strictly speaking, a computer for <b>video</b> <b>editing</b> does not require any installed hardware or software beyond a web browser and an internet connection.|$|R
50|$|Automatic <b>video</b> <b>editing</b> {{products}} have emerged {{over the past}} decade in order to make <b>video</b> <b>editing</b> accessible to a broader consumer market.

Muvee Technologies introduced autoProducer, the first PC-based automatic <b>video</b> <b>editing</b> platform, in 2001. Other solutions, including Sony’s MovieShaker and Roxio Cinematic, followed in 2002. As smartphones and consumer video recording devices become more prevalent the need for an easier video solution has led to a renewed interest in automatic <b>video</b> <b>editing.</b>|$|R

50|$|Long-time Amiga {{developer}} MacroSystem {{entered the}} Amiga-clone market with their DraCo <b>non-linear</b> <b>video</b> <b>editing</b> system. It appears in two versions, initially a tower model {{and later a}} cube. DraCo expanded upon and combined a number of earlier expansion cards developed for Amiga (VLabMotion, Toccata, WarpEngine, RetinaIII) into a true Amiga-clone powered by the Motorola 68060 processor. The DraCo can run AmigaOS 3.1 up through AmigaOS 3.9. It is the only Amiga-based system to support FireWire for video I/O. DraCo also offers an Amiga-compatible Zorro-II expansion bus and introduced a faster custom DraCoBus, capable of 30 MB/sec transfer rates (faster than Commodore's Zorro-III). The technology was later used in the Casablanca system, a set-top-box also designed for <b>non-linear</b> <b>video</b> <b>editing.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Video</b> <b>editing</b> is {{the process}} of editing {{segments}} of motion video production footage, special effects and sound recordings in the post-production process.

Using video, a director can communicate non-fictional and fictional events. The goals of editing is to manipulate these events to bring the communication closer to the original goal or target.

We aim the Tangible Video Editor for use in educational and community settings. Hence, we designed it to engage users in a collaborative editing experience and to encourage the exploration of narrative ideas. We evaluated our design using a comparative study that involved 36 participants using the Tangible Video Editor and a standard GUI-based, <b>non-linear</b> <b>video</b> editor.
