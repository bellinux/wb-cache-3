25|$|Although {{antiretroviral}} {{therapy has}} helped {{to improve the quality}} of life of people living with HIV, there is still a <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>explore</b> other ways to further address the disease burden. One such potential strategy that was investigated was to add interleukin 2 as an adjunct to antiretroviral therapy for adults with HIV. A Cochrane review included 25 randomized controlled trials that were conducted across six countries. The researchers found that interleukin 2 increases the CD4 immune cells, but does not make a difference in terms of death and incidence of other infections. Furthermore, there is probably an increase in side-effects with interleukin 2. The findings of this review do not support the use of interleukin 2 as an add-on treatment to antiretroviral therapy for adults with HIV.|$|E
25|$|One way of {{administering}} resveratrol {{in humans}} may be buccal delivery, that is without swallowing, by direct absorption through tissues {{on the inside}} of the mouth. When one milligram of resveratrol in 50 ml 50% alcohol/ water solution was retained in the mouth for one minute before swallowing, 37nbsp&ng/ml of free resveratrol was measured in plasma two minutes later. This level of unchanged resveratrol in blood can only be achieved with 250nbsp&mg of resveratrol taken in a pill form. However, the viability of a buccal delivery method is called into question due to the low aqueous solubility of the molecule. For a drug to be absorbed transmucosally it must be in free-form or dissolved. Resveratrol fits the criteria for oral transmucosal dosing, except for this caveat. The low aqueous solubility greatly limits the amount that can be absorbed through the buccal mucosa. Resveratrol that is attempted to be taken buccally was expected to pass through the mucous membrane of the mouth and be absorbed as an oral dose, however, the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>explore</b> buccal delivery in future pharmaceutical formulations was expressed.|$|E

Knowles stressed that no animosity was involved in the decision and acknowledged that Rowland will always be a part of the Knowles family. Then two months later, Rowland announced that she left Columbia Records, adding that she [...] "felt the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>explore</b> new directions, new challenges, and new freedoms outside my comfort zone." [...] In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Rowland stated that the label ended her contract because Ms. Kelly was not commercially successful. She later signed with Universal Motown Records.|$|E
500|$|Strapping Young Lad {{began working}} on their next album, Alien, in March 2004. Feeling that the band's {{previous}} album did {{not live up to}} expectations, Townsend decided to take his music to a new extreme. To prepare for the new album, Townsend stopped taking the medication prescribed to treat his bipolar disorder. [...] "I think that as an artist, in order for me to get to the next plateau, I kind of feel the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>explore</b> things and sometimes that exploration leads you to places that are a little crazy," [...] he explains. [...] "And Alien was no exception with that." [...] Although Townsend considered the album an [...] "impenetrable mass of technicality", it was well received on its release, selling 3,697 copies in its first week and appearing on several Billboard charts. Around this time, Townsend also contributed to the soundtrack of the video game [...]|$|E
500|$|Directors {{and writers}} Ron Clements and John Musker {{eventually}} disregarded Woolverton's script {{in favor of}} developing something more similar to Ashman's version albeit making several changes to his treatment, among them approaching the character of Jasmine [...] "a little differently" [...] while maintaining Woolverton's vision of [...] "a princess that Aladdin could woo." [...] Following the elimination of Aladdin's mother from the script, Jasmine and Aladdin's relationship was expanded upon {{to the point of}} which it became a focal point of the film, ultimately allowing more screen time for the princess. Thus, Jasmine was developed into a more prominent character. Unlike Disney's previous adaptations of fairy tales, the princess is not the film's main character, and therefore the story does not revolve around her. Despite the presence of a prominent princess character, the directors decided to treat Aladdin more-so like [...] "an Arabian adventure" [...] as opposed to a traditional Disney fairy tale or princess film in the vein of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) or Beauty and the Beast, making Jasmine the first Disney Princess to not star in the film in which she appears. The decision to make Aladdin a high comedy ultimately eliminated the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>explore</b> some of Jasmine's deeper storylines.|$|E

I want to thank everyone at Columbia for the love and support they've shown and I will never forget how many good times we've had over the years." [...] It was also announced in March that Guetta was releasing [...] "When Love Takes Over", his collaboration with Rowland. The song went on to be a worldwide success for the duo. Jason Lipshutz of Billboard said [...] "the success comes at an intriguing time in Rowland's career", having noted that she had landed a hosting job on Bravo's The Fashion Show and was in between labels.|$|E

2500|$|In 2012, NASA {{researchers}} Metzger, Muscatello, Mueller, and Mantovani {{argued for}} a bootstrapping approach to start self-replicating factories in space. They developed this concept {{on the basis of}} In Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU) technologies that NASA has been developing to [...] "live off the land" [...] on the Moon or Mars. Their modeling showed that in just 20 to 40 years this industry could become self-sufficient then grow to large size, enabling greater exploration in space as well as providing benefits back to Earth. In 2014, Thomas Kalil of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy published on the White House blog an interview with Metzger on bootstrapping solar system civilization through self-replicating space industry. Kalil requested the public submit ideas for how [...] "the Administration, the private sector, philanthropists, the research community, and storytellers can further these goals." [...] Kalil connected this concept to what former NASA Chief technologist Mason Peck has dubbed [...] "Massless Exploration", the ability to make everything in space so that you do not need to launch it from Earth. Peck has said, [...] "...all the mass we <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>explore</b> the solar system is already in space. It's just in the wrong shape." [...] In 2016, Metzger argued that fully self-replicating industry can be started over several decades by astronauts at a lunar outpost for a total cost (outpost plus starting the industry) of {{about a third of the}} space budgets of the International Space Station partner nations, and that this industry would solve Earth's energy and environmental problems in addition to providing massless exploration.|$|E
