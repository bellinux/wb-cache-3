5|$|Unlike in England, {{where the}} <b>nucleated</b> <b>village</b> existed {{relatively}} early, {{most of the}} early modern population of Scotland, in both the Lowlands and Highlands, was housed in small clachans or townships and isolated dwellings. These were unstructured groups of houses, often belonging to between four and six tenants, who were often engaged in common agriculture. As the population expanded, some of these settlements were subdivided to create new clachans and more marginal land was settled, with sheilings (clusters of huts occupied while summer pasture was being used for grazing) becoming permanent settlements.|$|E

2500|$|The manor of Hollington (also spelt Horintune, Holintun, Horintone, Halinton and Halyngtone {{early in}} its existence) {{existed at the}} time of the Domesday survey in 1086: before the Norman conquest of England the land was held by Godwin, Earl of Wessex and another lord, Alstan, and {{amounted}} to 4½ hides. [...] Afterwards it passed to Robert, Count of Eu. [...] The manor house and village (a scattered, mostly rural settlement rather than a <b>nucleated</b> <b>village)</b> were [...] northwest of Hastings and a similar distance north of St Leonards-on-Sea on a ridge of high land.|$|E

25|$|Settlement {{patterns}} {{as well as}} village {{plans in}} England fall into two great categories: scattered farms and homesteads in upland and woodland Britain, <b>nucleated</b> <b>villages</b> across a swathe of central England. The chronology of <b>nucleated</b> <b>villages</b> is much debated and not yet clear. Yet there is strong {{evidence to support the}} view that nucleation occurred in the tenth century or perhaps the ninth, and was a development parallel to the growth of towns.|$|R
2500|$|The {{settlement}} is 21 miles south east of London, {{partly on the}} A246 between Leatherhead and Guildford. As such it forms {{a cross between a}} <b>nucleated</b> <b>village</b> and dispersed settlement directly north of this road, with a wide array of medium-sized individual home plots typically of [...] Horsley and Effingham Junction railway stations are on the New Guildford Line in the parish (connected to London Waterloo and both have a line direct to Leatherhead, Epsom and Sutton). [...] The village has the parade of shops and businesses of the two Horsleys (see West Horsley), Otherwise the two-halves of ancient Horsley are similar in having substantial woodland and some chalky lower slopes, in the south, of the North Downs.|$|E
2500|$|Chertsey Abbey, whose {{ownership}} of the main manor of Ebbisham was confirmed by King Æthelstan [...] in 933, asserted during its Middle Ages existence that Frithwald and Bishop Erkenwald granted it 20 mansas of land in Epsom in 727. [...] Epsom appears in Domesday Book of 1086 as Evesham, held by Chertsey Abbey. Its domesday assets were: 11 hides; 2 churches, 2 mills worth 10 shillings, 18 ploughs, [...] of meadow, woodland worth 20 hogs; altogether it rendered £17 per year to its overlords. The town {{at the time of}} Domesday Book had 38 households (and 6 serfs noteworthy enough to be recorded as assets), some of them in a <b>nucleated</b> <b>village</b> near the parish church of which there were two. At various dates in the Middle Ages, manors were founded by subinfeudation at Epsom Court, Horton, Woodcote, Brettgrave and Langley Vale.|$|E
2500|$|The site of Anglo-Saxon and Domesday Birmingham is not known. The {{traditional}} view – {{that it was}} {{a village}} based around the crossing of the River Rea at Deritend, with a village green on the site that became the Bull Ring – has now largely been discredited, and not a single piece of Anglo-Saxon material was found during the extensive archeological excavations that preceded the redevelopment of the Bull Ring in 2000. Other locations have been suggested including the Broad Street area; Hockley in the Jewellery Quarter; or the site of the Priory of St Thomas of Canterbury, now occupied by Old Square. Alternatively early Birmingham may have been an area of scattered farmsteads with no central <b>nucleated</b> <b>village,</b> or the name may originally have referred to the wider area of the Beormingas' tribal homeland, much larger than the later manor and parish and including many surrounding settlements. [...] Analysis of the pre-Norman linkages between parishes suggests that such an area could have extended from West Bromwich to Castle Bromwich, and from the southern boundaries of Northfield and King's Norton to the northern boundaries of Sutton Coldfield.|$|E
50|$|In central Europe, <b>nucleated</b> <b>villages</b> {{have also}} emerged from smaller {{settlements}} and many farmsteads (equivalent to many hamlets) also grew into societal communities with growth in population.

40|$|Geo-spatial data on village locations, their size, {{population}} and other parameters is scarcely available to decision makers {{in many developing}} countries. In this paper, we demonstrate an automatic ?crawler? which can segment <b>nucleated</b> <b>villages</b> from satellite imagery freely available in public domain geographic information systems such as Google EarthTM. Our approach is to use frequency and color features to generate a number of weak classifiers, which are then combined through Adaboost to produce the final classifier. We use a total of 69 features in the generation of the weak classifiers, including phase gradients, cornerness measures and color features. Our primary dataset consists of 60 images having more than 345 million pixels and covering more than 100 km 2 of area, containing <b>nucleated</b> <b>villages</b> in fifteen countries, spread over four continents and captured by different sensors. Using six manual annotations for ground-truth, we perform five-fold cross validation, using 25 % of data for testing. Our results show an Equal Error Rate (EER) of around 3. 4 %. Using the trained classifier, we detect villages on a 50 km 2 image (close to 184 million pixels) from a different site than the images used in training, and demonstrate highly accurate extraction of villages with 2. 3 % false positives and 0. 01 % false negatives...|$|R
50|$|Many of the {{earliest}} colonial documents about pre-Columbian Nicoya {{appear to have been}} lost in a fire that burned the town's archives in 1783. In the resulting documentary vacuum, a number of interpretations regarding pre-Hispanic Nicoya have emerged. Foremost among them is the belief that as the southernmost representatives of Mesoamerican culture, Nicoyans lived in <b>nucleated</b> <b>villages,</b> and that Cereceda's accounting of 6,063 souls merely represented the number of inhabitants of one village under chief Nicoya's control. The modern city of Nicoya is generally believed to be on the site of that village.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe hyper-fast {{urbanization}} process in China {{has led to}} the mixes of traditional and contemporary neighborhoods, especially in the aspects of residential districts. The aim {{of this paper is to}} explore the interrelationship between urban form and energy efficiency of the residential neighborhoods on Chongming Eco-Island, which is a leading example in China's urbanization towards low-carbon and sustainability. By the empirical study and simulation on six most dominant neighborhood typologies, it is found that the annual building energy consumption of them vary significantly largely due to the various occupant behaviors. Moreover, the calculation of solar potential and energy trade-offs between production and consumption indicates that the <b>nucleated</b> <b>villages</b> and slab buildings have the greatest retrofitting potentials, which lead to the policy implications for Chongming’ s low energy and low carbon urban management...|$|R

The <b>nucleated</b> <b>villages</b> of this region lying within their open fields were originally designed to use the land to its maximum, but {{by the turn of the}} nineteenth century the inflationary effects of bad harvests, wars. industrialisation and population growth had resulted in an enormous, increase in the demand for food. The introduction of new crops and new methods of cultivation, mainly the Norfolk four course rotation, resulted in the more enlightened landowners demanding enclosure. But this desire to plough every available piece of land ignored the destruction of the valuable and distinctive habitats that existed, particularly in the heaths and moors of the area.
