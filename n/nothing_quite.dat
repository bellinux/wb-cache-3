500|$|Critics {{were also}} divided about the game's {{graphics}} and pacing. Destructoid stated that [...] "while detailed, most environments alternate between concrete gray and brick red." [...] GameSpot echoed {{criticism of the}} [...] "lack of visual variety." [...] IGN added that [...] "the world map and dungeons are crying for more detail." [...] Despite this, Destructoid allowed that [...] "the colorful clothing helps offset the game's otherwise limited palette." [...] IGN disliked the fact that [...] "large difficulty spikes are interjected every now and then" [...] and [...] "Resonance of Fate is built for those that enjoy the grind." [...] In contrast, the GameSpot reviewer liked {{this aspect of the}} game, [...] "You need to use every trick you have learned, and a few you may not have even realized yet, to tackle these treacherous monsters, but there is <b>nothing</b> <b>quite</b> as sweet as toppling something that has tormented you for so long." ...|$|E
500|$|Niandra LaDes and Usually Just a T-Shirt was {{not widely}} reviewed, but yielded a {{generally}} positive response from critics. Steve Huey of AllMusic, who rated the album {{four out of}} five stars, said that [...] " [...] an intriguing and unexpected departure from Frusciante's work with the Chili Peppers", and that [...] "the sparse arrangements of the first half help {{set the stage for the}} gossamer guitar work later on." [...] He went on to say that Usually Just a T-Shirt—the latter half of the album—contained [...] "pleasant psychedelic instrumentals with plenty of backward-guitar effects." [...] Ned Raggett, also of AllMusic, noted that [...] "there's <b>nothing</b> <b>quite</b> so stunning as [...] magnificent remake of Bad Brains' 'The Big Takeover'." [...] Adam Williams of PopMatters said the album [...] "fall somewhere between madness and brilliance". He went on to compare Frusciante to Syd Barrett, and felt it was a [...] "hint at a deeply cerebral artist looking within for inspiration and creativity." [...] High Times Tim Kenneally saw the record as [...] "a revelation, both disturbingly intimate and cryptically veiled. Ladeled straight out of the guitarist's stream of consciousness, it's worlds away from the up-front, balls-out funk assault of his former band," [...] with [...] "an ethereal, otherworldly quality." [...] The album received its share of negative criticism as well. Rolling Stone's Christian Hoard felt [...] "Frusciante's eccentricities run seriously amok", and that [...] " [...] sounds like a string of four-track demos. The first part of the album is slightly more tuneful than the more ambient, experimental second section Mostly what you get are Frusciante's acoustic-guitar scratchings and stream-of-conscious ramblings." [...] The first Rolling Stone review of the record, however, was positive: [...] "All in all, [...] a mess—but definitely a fascinating, often lovely mess. As one might expect of an album titled Niandra Lades and Usually Just a T-shirt this is twisted, cool stuff." [...] The Boston Herald said that while the album was [...] "a stark display of Frusciante's acoustic guitar virtuosity" [...] and [...] "eerily beautiful", the singing was [...] "terrible; his high notes will drive the neighborhood dogs into a frenzy." ...|$|E
500|$|Other Western {{publications}} {{reacted to}} The Final Fantasy Legend more favorably. Author Jeff Rovin heavily praised the {{title in the}} book How to Win at Game Boy Games, citing the thorough manual and considering the game a [...] "masterful achievement for the Game Boy unit, and a superlative game of [...] kind", though not as complex as The Legend of Zelda. Spencer Yip of Siliconera named it as a game he was thankful for playing, citing it as opening his mind to story-based games more so than titles like Dragon Quest, and in part {{led to the creation}} of the website. In May 1991, Nintendo Power named the game the third all-around best Game Boy game of the previous year, and in September 1997 they ranked it 70th on their list of the [...] "Top 100" [...] games to appear on a Nintendo system, stating that it had [...] "stayed true to the Square Soft tradition". TechnoBuffalo's Ron Duwell acknowledged while it was regarded less favorably than its sequels, its flaws could be worked around and added [...] "There is <b>nothing</b> <b>quite</b> like The Final Fantasy Legend. Not before it, [...] and only a single sequel to follow up on its ideas.". 1UP.com's Jeremy Parish called it one of the [...] "essential" [...] games for the Game Boy as well as one of the best of 1989, noting its introduction of new ideas that contrasted the Final Fantasy series and calling it [...] "a pretty decent portable RPG in its own right". GameDaily named it a definite game for Game Boy alongside the related Final Fantasy titles, describing it as providing [...] "hours of role-playing excitement, whether you were waiting in a dentist's office or on the way to Grandma's house." [...] Andrew Vanden Bossche described the game as [...] "unusual" [...] amongst Japanese roleplaying games, describing its narrative as [...] "loosely connected experiences rather than the sort of epic narrative the RPG genre is commonly thought of". As a result, the off-screen deaths of non-player characters felt more [...] "poignant" [...] and an example of memento mori. However, he also felt the monster class system as counter-intuitive, as frequently said classes emphasized the point of enemies as [...] "designed to pose challenges, not overcome them". Electronic Gaming Monthly, Game Informer, Pocket Games, and GameSpot shared this sentiment; the latter three named it one of the top fifty games for the Game Boy.|$|E

[...] "Pearly has such an unmistakable character that we felt it was necessary to find another instrument with a similar sound to use as a spare guitar.

2500|$|The {{instrumental}} break, {{is played}} by Harrison on a Rickenbacker 12-string guitar, [...] with Martin doubling on a piano recorded to tape at half-speed and then sped up to normal. [...] Recording this solo was the most challenging aspect of the session; a take that surfaced on a bootleg in the 1980s reveals Harrison fumbling over his strings, losing his timing and missing notes. But {{by the time the}} session ended at 10 p.m. that night, he had sculpted one of his most memorable solos – an upward run played twice and capped with a circular flourish - in illustration of an observation made by engineer Geoff Emerick: [...] "George would {{spend a lot of time}} working out solos.

2500|$|Anderson {{soon became}} notorious for causing controversy, {{such as his}} infamous quote that resurfaced in {{interviews}} and articles in the following years, that he was [...] "a bisexual man who never had a homosexual experience". In February 1993, Suede went from highly touted indie band to major chart contenders with their third single, [...] "Animal Nitrate", which went into the UK top ten. The single earned them a last-minute invitation to play at that year's Brit Awards ceremony. Impressed by the band's charged sexuality, Suede's first sequence of singles and first album shocked audiences and critics alike. Suede's sexual lyrics made them a rallying point for the alienated, {{one of the few}} British bands since the Smiths who united as much as they divided. Comparisons were being made with David Bowie, though Suede sounded <b>nothing</b> <b>quite</b> like anybody else around at the time, and soon they fell upon what critics quickly deemed was a new movement. Anderson recalls, [...] "I had always been fascinated by suburbia, and I liked to throw these twisted references to small-town British life into songs. This was before we had that horrible term Britpop." ...|$|E
2500|$|... 1957 was, {{in her own}} words, [...] "Althea Gibson's year". [...] In July she won Wimbledon—considered, at the time, the [...] "world {{championship}} of tennis". She was {{the first}} black champion in the tournament's 80-year history, and the first champion to receive the trophy personally from Queen Elizabeth II. [...] "Shaking hands with the queen of England," [...] she said, [...] "was a long way from being forced to sit in the colored section of the bus." [...] She won the doubles championship as well, for the second year. Upon her return home Gibson became only the second black American, after Jesse Owens, to be honored with a ticker tape parade in New York City, and Mayor Robert F. Wagner, Jr. presented her with the Bronze Medallion, the city's highest civilian award. A month later she defeated Brough in straight sets to win her first U.S. National championship. [...] "Winning Wimbledon was wonderful," [...] she wrote, [...] "and it meant a lot to me. [...] But there is <b>nothing</b> <b>quite</b> like winning the championship of your own country." [...] In all she reached the finals of eight Grand Slam events in 1957, winning the Wimbledon and U.S. National singles titles, the Wimbledon and Australian doubles championships, and the U.S. mixed doubles crown, and finishing second in Australian singles, U.S. doubles, and Wimbledon mixed doubles. At season's end she broke yet another barrier as the first black player on the U.S. Wightman Cup team, which defeated Great Britain 6–1.|$|E
2500|$|Heavy Rain was {{critically}} acclaimed. The UK Official PlayStation Magazine reviewer Tim Clark wrote, [...] "I'm convinced it's {{one of the}} freshest, most exciting, {{and even}} important games on PS3 so far." [...] Clark praised the effective controls of the game, {{as well as the}} pacing of the story, which the reviewer described as key, and perfectly designed to create an [...] "exhausting, exhilarating, and, crucially, involving" [...] experience. He concluded by saying that, [...] "Certainly there's <b>nothing</b> <b>quite</b> like it on PS3, or indeed any other system. Put gaming conventions aside, go in with no expectations other than this is something new and massively good-looking, and you'll be rewarded with a unique experience that lurches between genius and madness, manages to be genuinely emotional, and that you'll be bursting to talk about with your friends." [...] GamesMaster complimented Heavy Rain for being [...] "incredibly original and compelling", as [...] "the atmosphere is incredible – full of driving rain (which becomes central to the plot), fizzing neon lights, dark apartments and warehouses. It's a dark noir game, not a bright adventure." [...] The game was given a GamesMaster Gold Award. IGN's Chris Roper praised the game's [...] "fantastic story that's {{one of the best in}} gaming." [...] However, he pointed out that the game's beginning is very slow, and might turn off some players. GameZone's Michael Lafferty wrote, [...] "There are some flaws, but taken as a package, Heavy Rain is a remarkable achievement in gaming that creates an interactive experience that goes beyond the pages of a good novel or film noir. This is a game that needs to be experienced." [...] Winda Benedetti wrote about the maturity of Heavy Rain as well as Remedy Entertainment's psychological action thriller Alan Wake for MSNBC, praising both titles for being [...] "emotionally powerful" [...] as well as having [...] "said goodbye to the tired alien invasions and over-the-top fantasy stories so often found in video games. Instead, they peer into the dark reaches of the very real human heart to deliver stories that are thrilling, chilling and utterly absorbing." ...|$|E
