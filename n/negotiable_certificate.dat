40|$|This paper {{reports on}} an econometric {{model of the}} {{aggregate}} behaviour of the Australian trading banks, using monthly data from January 1974 to June 1980. There are two reasons for this study. First, {{there have been several}} changes in the institutional environment in which banks operate as a consequence of some deregulation and attempts by the financial sector to circumvent some regulation. Hence, {{there is a need to}} focus attention on a period in which government regulation is relatively homogeneous. Second, by using monthly data of reatively recent vintage some better idea of the dynamics of portfolio adjustment by the banks will be obtained. Previous studies have frequently made use of relatively long runs of quarterly data and, for the most part, have found lengthy adjustment lags. The estimated model comprises ten behavioural equations and one identity. There are equations for demand deposits, fixed deposits, <b>negotiable</b> <b>certificates</b> of deposit, overdraft advances and commercial bill acceptances, all of which have been modelled as being determined by the non-bank public. In turn, the banks are assumed to determine the supply of <b>negotiable</b> <b>certificates</b> of deposit, fully drawn loans, overdraft limits, bill acceptance limits and the stock of excess liquid assets (determined residually). There is also an equation for the interest rate on commercial bills. The dynamic simulation properties of the model are also reported, as are the results of three counterfactual experiments. Broadly speaking, the results support the theoretical model that is presented in an appendix. Adjustment by both the banks and the non-bank public is rapid, with most average lages being less than four months. ...|$|R

For {{the part}} of the GEA in Manhattan south of 110th Street, the owner had to provide {{affordable}} housing in order to get any 421-a tax benefits. For such projects, a ten-year tax abatement could be obtained through building affordable units offsite, via a [...] "negotiable certificate" [...] from the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development. However, a 20-year tax benefit could only be obtained by building affordable units on-site. In the rest of the GEA, certificates meant a 15-year exemption and on-site affordable units meant a 25-year exemption. Outside of the GEA, <b>negotiable</b> <b>certificates</b> were prohibited. A 15-year abatement was always allowed for any construction project, with a 25-year abatement being permitted if affordable housing units were built in the apartment building.|$|R
40|$|The article {{presents}} {{a detailed description}} of the money markets in the U. S. In recent years, new markets such as bankers’ acceptances, commercial paper, <b>Negotiable</b> <b>Certificates</b> of Deposit and the external extension of the New York market into Euro-dollars have have been established. Despite the growth in some of these markets, however, the main markets in the U. S. remain those in Government securities and Federal funds. It is through these markets that idle money in the U. S. is mobilised and distributed across the country as a whole. In this context, full use is made of correspondent relationships and both the banks and the dealers attempt to tap every possible source of funds. The intensity of this search for new sources of money has had the effect of binding together much more closely the various parts of the financial mechanism and has made it much more sensitive to Federal Reserve action.   JEL: E 44, E 58 </p...|$|R

Rather, credit risk premiums seem to have disappeared in the money market. We also discuss possible relationships between this result and the Bank of Japan's monetary policy. ...|$|E
40|$|New York City's tax {{expenditures}} {{relate to}} real property tax totaled $ 4. 5 billion {{in fiscal year}} 2012. The largest expenditure relates to the " 421 -a" tax exemption program for new multi-family residential real estate development, which costs the New Yorkers nearly $ 1 billion in foregone tax revenue (Office of Tax Policy, FY 2012). The 421 -a program was originally established in the 1970 s to spur new multi-family developments. Initially, developers received full tax exemption on the assessed value of the new construction, which then decreased by a phase-out schedule where their property taxes were payable in full {{at the end of}} benefit period. As the private development market recovered, the city calibrated the program to (i) exclude certain neighborhoods from receiving benefits for strictly market-rate development and (ii) to spur affordable housing development by offering benefits of the program if a certain percentage of the total units constructed were affordable. Despite the success of the strategy in delivering 142, 044 residential units in 2012 (Office of Tax Policy, FY 2012), the program has been subjected to increasing scrutiny as New York City's need for real estate tax revenue has increased. It is unclear how many of these units would have been built without the exemption. Many opponents have argued for the termination of the program because it has not produced benefits commensurate with the huge tax expenditures New York City has made, and that the beneficiaries had been landowners who captured the value of the abatements through higher land prices. As the program approaches its potential renewal in June 15, 2015, it is worthwhile to conduct a detailed analysis of the efficacy and cost of the current program. The thesis offers a thorough yet intelligible case study of a co-op building in Chelsea of how the property taxes would be calculated and the program's impact on the financial feasibility of the development. Different scenarios are created that follows each of the program reforms to understand the actual value of the property tax exemptions to developers {{and the ways in which}} such value is distributed. In the current environment where many New Yorkers find themselves facing a daunting housing market with decreased production and increased demand for affordable units, the program should strengthen its benefits to steer more developers towards creating affordable housing. Alternative financial models based on the case study suggest that the return of an improved <b>negotiable</b> <b>certificate</b> program can make the 421 -a program a more effective affordable housing incentive without additional cost to the city. by Jenny Chiani Wu.

50|$|Banks are {{key players}} in several {{segments}} of the money market. To meet reserve requirements and manage day-to-day liquidity needs, banks buy and sell short-term uncollateralized loans in the federal funds market. For longer maturity loans, banks can tap the Eurodollar market. Eurodollars are dollar-denominated deposit liabilities of banks located outside the United States (or of International Banking Facilities in the United States). US banks can raise funds in the Eurodollar market through their overseas branches and subsidiaries. A second option is to issue large <b>negotiable</b> <b>certificates</b> of deposit (CDs). These are certificates issued by banks which state that a specified amount of money has been deposited {{for a period of}} time and will be redeemed with interest at maturity. Repurchase agreements (repos) are yet another source of funding. Repos and reverse repos are transactions in which a borrower agrees to sell securities to a lender and then to repurchase the same or similar securities after a specified time, at a given price, and including interest at an agreed-upon rate. Repos are collateralized or secured loans in contrast to federal funds loans which are unsecured.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{financial}} market functioning under the zero interest rate policy (ZIRP) {{and the subsequent}} quantitative monetary easing policy (QMEP) conducted by the Bank of Japan (BOJ). First, the estimation results of the Japanese government bond yield curve using the Black-Gorovoi-Linetsky (BGL) model show that (1) the shadow interest rate has been negative since the late 1990 s, turned upward in 2003, and has been on an uptrend since then, and (2) the first-hitting time until the negative shadow interest rate hits zero again under the risk-neutral probability {{is estimated to be}} about three months as of the end of February 2006. Second, under the ZIRP and QMEP, the risk premiums for Japanese banks have almost disappeared in short-term money markets such as the market for <b>negotiable</b> <b>certificates</b> of deposit, while they have remained in the credit default swap market and the stock market. This result supports the view that market participants have positively perceived the BOJfs ample liquidity provisions in containing the near- term defaults of banks caused by the liquidity shortage.

40|$|Liability {{management}} by the Australian trading banks {{is a relatively}} recent development, largely {{made possible by the}} inroduction of <b>negotiable</b> <b>certificates</b> of deposit (NCD’s). The market for NCD’s also acts as an important link in transmitting credit market disturbances to non-bank financial intermediaries. Relatively little {{attention has been paid to}} analysing the working of this market in Australia. This paper presents and estimates two models of the NCD market. In the first case the hypothesis of short term rationing, that arises from various restrictions on the operation of the market, is tested. The second model assumes that the market clears in the short run but adjusts with a lag to the desired long run position. Our results favour the second model. In addition, the demand for NCDs by the non-bank public depends on wealth and interest rates. The supply of NCD’s by the banks depends on the banks liquidity position and on interest rates. The results suggest that banks may use asset management instead of liability management when rates rise on liquid assets of the banks. Adjustment by the non-bank public to the long run demand is instantaneous, while the banks adjust with a lag. Our results suggest that approximately 84 per cent of the adjustment in the banks’ supply occurs within one year. ...|$|R

40|$|The <b>negotiable</b> time <b>certificate</b> {{of deposit}} (CD) has played an {{important}} role in the competitive struggle of commercial banks in the US since 1961, enabling them to tap sources of funds they had neglected since the banking reforms of the 1930 s. The aggressive employment of the CD has already brought about various changes in banking practices, and may lead to further modifications in the functions performed by commercial banks and in the banking structure. The present article is devoted to the CD phenomenon as it affects the role of commercial banks as financial intermediaries and the structure of the banking industry. The effects of interest rate regulation on the development of the CD as a potential source of funds is also considered.

40|$|Considering {{water as}} an {{economic}} good entails, among other requisites, properly assessing the cost incurred by supplying and managing the resource, and the required infrastructure thereof. Regarding irrigation, the International Commission for Irrigation and Drainage (ICID) set up a method for assessing the full financial costs, {{in the form of}} guidelines. This paper investigates the applicability of these guidelines in smallholder irrigation conditions in developing countries. The paper first presents the specific conditions and features of such a sector, with emphasis on South African examples. Several specific issues are identified and discussed, such as the lack of records on infrastructure and initial costs, the multiple purpose and actual uses of certain equipment and infrastructure, the shift in purpose of others over time, the inclusion of certain small, yet indispensable equipment in the calculation, the partial refurbishment works on particular assets, and the lack of a standard basis for calculation under tropical, developing conditions (e. g. on service life, maintenance requirements). Secondly, after a brief review of current frameworks, concepts and terminology, the paper attempts to apply the existing guidelines developed by ICID for evaluating financial costs of irrigation services on a case study in South Africa. The results suggest that the application of the guidelines is feasible, provided that some adapted data and available information replace the original set, especially for capital costs. This applies to the discount rate, calculation of the current value, and estimation of the service life of infrastructure and equipment. In particular, several scenarios have been tested in order to identify a surrogate to the discount rate. The average yield on <b>Negotiable</b> <b>Certificates</b> of Deposit (NCD) is suggested as a surrogate for treasury bills and hence as a substitute for the discount rate. The case study demonstrates the high costs of irrigation services compared to the low income derived from irrigation production in smallholder schemes and hence the need for renewed public intervention and subsidisation, especially on account of the current context of management transfer, privatisation, and liberalisation. The paper suggests a shift in the underlying policy and societal mindset about the water charging system for smallholder irrigation. Cost recovery and water charges should not be considered as being a further burden or deterring factor for smallholder irrigation, but rather as an incentive towards increasing production and ultimately improving their contribution to the country's economy...|$|R

In terms of national legislation, these proposals- which are designed to alter the basic asset-liability mismatch of the housing oriented thrift institutions-have often been stymied.
