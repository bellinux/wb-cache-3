A <b>national</b> treatment <b>provision</b> avoids these regulatory distortions, but implies entry distortions because it makes the holdup problem also apply to domestic firms.

50|$|The Directive {{requires}} all Member States {{to apply}} effective, dissuasive and proportionate remedies and penalties against those engaged in counterfeiting and piracy.

In short, the Directive adds extra measures on enforcement of digital copyright while leaving national law in other areas unaffected.|$|E

Topic: General decision aiming to harmonise <b>national</b> <b>provisions</b> {{in the field}} of cyber crime, encompassing material criminal law (i.e. definitions of specific crimes), procedural criminal law (including investigative measures and international cooperation) and liability issues. Scope: Requires Member States to implement the provisions of the Framework Decision in their national legal frameworks. Framework decision is relevant to RM/RA because it contains the conditions under which legal liability can be imposed on legal entities for conduct of certain natural persons of authority within the legal entity. Thus, the Framework decision requires that the conduct of such figures within an organisation is adequately monitored, also because the Decision states that a legal entity can be held liable for acts of omission in this regard.|$|E
