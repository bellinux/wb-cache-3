One scenario is the recognition of citizen claims and initiatives to have a bigger say in governance, or a greater deal of political participation in relevant decision-making processes (Keane, 2009; Rosanvallon, 2008; Saward, 2010, Tormey, 2014). Another scenario is the development of alternative means of access to collective services and mutual help outside the sphere of the state – possibly in the tradition of older social economy experiences (Graeber, 2013). Both scenarios may be combined in some cases. How do we interpret the rise of ngos, social networking, mass protests, diy politics and other forms of sub-politics in terms of the scenarios and perspectives of a diverse civil society and its social movements...|$|R
