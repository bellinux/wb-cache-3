40|$|For {{efficient}} aminoacylation, tRNAs {{carry the}} conserved 3 ′-terminal sequence C-C-A, which is synthesized by highly specific tRNA <b>nucleotidyltransferases</b> (CCA-adding enzymes). In several prokaryotes, this function {{is accomplished by}} separate enzymes for CC- and A-addition. As A-adding enzymes carry an N-terminal catalytic core identical to that of CCA-adding enzymes, it is unclear why their activity is restricted. Here, it is shown that C-terminal deletion variants of A-adding enzymes acquire full and precise CCA-incorporating activity. The deleted region seems {{to be responsible for}} tRNA primer selection, restricting the enzyme’s specificity to tRNAs ending with CC. The data suggest that A-adding enzymes carry an intrinsic CCA-adding activity that can be reactivated by the introduction of deletions in the C-terminal domain. Furthermore, a unique subtype of CCA-adding enzymes could be identified that evolved out of A-adding enzymes, suggesting that mutations and deletions in <b>nucleotidyltransferases</b> can lead to altered and even more complex activities, as a simple A-incorporation is converted into sequence-specific addition of C and A residues.

50|$|Chemoenzymatic glycorandomization was {{inspired}} by the early pathway engineering work of Hutchinson and coworkers that suggested natural product glycosyltransferases were capable of utilizing non-native sugar nucleotide donors. The initial platform for chemoenzymatic glycorandomization was based upon a set of two highly permissive sugar activation enzymes (a sugar anomeric kinase and sugar-1-phosphate <b>nucleotidyltransferase)</b> to afford sugar nucleotide libraries as donors for these promiscuous glycosyltransferases where the permissivity of the corresponding sugar kinase and <b>nucleotidyltransferase</b> was expanded by enzyme engineering and directed evolution. The first application of this three enzyme (kinase, <b>nucleotidyltransferase</b> and glycosyltransferase) strategy enabled the product of a set of >30 differentially glycosylated vancomycins, some members of which were further diversified chemoselectively by virtue of the installation of sugars bearing chemoselective handles. This enzymatic platform has been further advanced through glycosyltransferase evolution and capitalizing upon the discovery of the reversibility of glycosyltransferase-catalyzed reactions first discovered in the context of calicheamicin biosynthesis.|$|E
40|$|The {{synthesis}} of deoxy-thymidine di-phosphate (dTDP) –l-rhamnose, {{an important component}} of the cell wall of many microorganisms, is a target for therapeutic intervention. The first enzyme in the dTDP–l-rhamnose biosynthetic pathway is glucose- 1 -phosphate thymidylyltransferase (RmlA). RmlA is inhibited by dTDP–l-rhamnose thereby regulating l-rhamnose production in bacteria. The structure of Pseudomonas aeruginosa RmlA has been solved to 1. 66 Å resolution. RmlA is a homotetramer, with the monomer consisting of three functional subdomains. The sugar binding and dimerization subdomains are unique to RmlA-like enzymes. The sequence of the core subdomain is found not only in sugar <b>nucleotidyltransferases</b> but also in other <b>nucleotidyltransferases.</b> The structures of five distinct enzyme substrate– product complexes reveal the enzyme mechanism that involves precise positioning of the nucleophile and activation of the electrophile. All the key residues are within the core subdomain, suggesting that the basic mechanism is found in many <b>nucleotidyltransferases.</b> The dTDP–l-rhamnose complex identifies how the protein is controlled by its natural inhibitor. This work provides a platform for the design of novel drugs against pathogenic bacteria...|$|R
