50|$|A <b>coupling</b> <b>nut,</b> {{also known}} as {{extension}} nut, is a threaded fastener for joining two male threads, most commonly a threaded rod, but also pipes. The outside of the fastener is usually a hex so a wrench can hold it. Variations include reducing <b>coupling</b> <b>nuts,</b> for joining two different size threads; sight hole <b>coupling</b> <b>nuts,</b> which have a sight hole for observing the amount of engagement; and <b>coupling</b> <b>nuts</b> with left-handed threads. These are used to make up long rod assemblies from shorter lengths of rods. The rods are threaded into the <b>coupling</b> <b>nut</b> for a certain distance. <b>Coupling</b> <b>nut</b> dimensions are described by the Industrial Fasteners Institute in standard IFI-128. It is given a plain finish. It is either cold drawn or hot rolled depending on the bar stock used. <b>Coupling</b> <b>nuts</b> threaded with two different thread sizes and profiles are called reducing <b>coupling</b> <b>nuts.</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{closed-loop}} {{performance of}} a ball-screw drive is usually limited by a resonance in which the carriage oscillates {{in the direction of}} motion as the screw undergoes longitudinal and torsional deformation. By means of the finite element method (FEM), a model of ball-screw system dynamics is presented by taking into account the distributed inertia of the screw and the compliance and damping of thrust bearings, <b>nut</b> and <b>coupling.</b> Transmission ratio is modeled using DOFs (degree of freedoms) constraint equation. The model is found to accurately predict the transfer function from motor torque to carriage position. Comparing the predicted responses with experiments performed on a pair of ball-screw drives, the resonance frequency is misestimated as much as 5 % in the worst case...|$|R
5000|$|The {{coupling}} system is usually made of two bayonet ramps machined on the external {{side of the}} receptacle connector and 2 stainless steel studs mounted inside the plug connectorâ€™s <b>coupling</b> <b>nut.</b> Several classes of electrical cable connectors, including audio, video, and data cables use bayonet connectors. Examples include BNC, C, and ST connectors. (The BNC connector is not exactly as described in this article, as the male, not female, connector has the slots and spring.) ...|$|R
50|$|Electrical blind mate {{connectors}} provide {{power or}} signal and are distinguished from other connectors {{in that they}} do not feature a rigid mechanical retention mechanism belonging to the interface itself, such as a threaded <b>coupling</b> <b>nut</b> on an SMA connector. They are typically used in a multi-pin arrangement between racks and panels, daughtercard to backplane, or similar applications where the connector is not mated by itself, but rather by the action of inserting the entire unit or module.|$|R
40|$|Mating pair of {{insulators}} forces initial alinement of {{plug and}} socket. Male pins recessed {{behind one of}} alining insulators so they cannot touch female contacts alined. Contacts mate when <b>coupling</b> <b>nut</b> draws alined plug and socket together, depressing one of alining insulators against spring. Compressed spring provides tension on mated threads of assembly helping connector to resist loosening under vibration or shock. Arrangement prevents breakage or bending of male pins on conventional connectors when misalined contacts carelessly pressed together...|$|R

Fitting comprises parts made of materials with different coefficients of thermal expansion to prevent leakage gaps from forming as temperature decreases. Consists of <b>coupling</b> <b>nut,</b> two flared tube ends, and flared O-ring spacer. Spacer contracts more than tube ends do as temperature decreases. This greater contraction seals tube ends more tightly, preventing leakage...|$|R
50|$|Threaded Coupling {{interconnect}} mating designs use a {{threaded nut}} on the plug, and a corresponding set of threads on the receptacle,to mate {{the pair of}} components. The <b>coupling</b> <b>nut</b> is usually equipped with flats or knurling for easy assembly. Different thread types, profiles andgeometries provide different functionality. Buttress Threads, for example, are often specified on plastic connectors due to their enhanced tensile strength.The MIL-C-38999 connector incorporates a triple-start threaded coupling mechanism for greater vibration protection and faster mating and unmating.|$|R
50|$|The BNC (Bayonet Neill-Concelman) {{connector}} is {{a miniature}} quick connect/disconnect radio frequency connector used for coaxial cable. It features two bayonet lugs on the female connector; mating is fully achieved with a quarter {{turn of the}} <b>coupling</b> <b>nut.</b> BNC connectors are used with miniature-to-subminiature coaxial cable in radio, television, and other radio-frequency electronic equipment, test instruments, and video signals. The BNC was commonly used for early computer networks, including ARCnet, the IBM PC Network, and the 10BASE2 variant of Ethernet. BNC connectors are made to match the characteristic impedance of cable at either 50 ohms or 75 ohms. They are usually applied for frequencies below 4 GHz and voltages below 500 volts.|$|R
25|$|On lap 14, Morbidelli crashed, and Brundle crashed off {{shortly after}} {{at the same}} point whilst the marshalls were still dealing with Morbidelli's car. Although no-one was hit by the car, one marshall was hit by debris and {{suffered}} a broken leg; the race was stopped. The race restarted after some time behind the Safety Car and Frentzen ran wide into the first corner, dropping down three places. Schumacher, who was just ahead on track but 6 seconds ahead on aggregate pitted early on lap 19. He took on fresh tyres and a fuel load that was insufficient to last {{to the end of the}} race. He rejoined 17 seconds behind Hill on aggregate but got caught in traffic and soon the gap was up to 30 seconds before it stabilized. This meant that Hill rejoined 7 seconds ahead on lap 25 when he pitted and fueled to the end of the race, but only 3 of his tyres were changed due to a sticking wheel <b>nut.</b> This, <b>coupled</b> with Hill's heavy fuel load appeared to hinder him and Schumacher began to close in.|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} was conducted at PT. XYZ which is a manufacturing company engaged {{in the manufacture of}} spare parts of screwpress and digester. The study was conducted only in the manufacture of spare parts of screwpress, namely protection nut, screw worm, cone guide, dismentling plate, cone, pin & <b>coupling</b> <b>nut,</b> strainer, extension shaft, intermediate gear, and flexible coupling. The flow pattern at PT. XYZ is job shop and produced by make to order, each product has a different process flow, sequence and timing of different processes, but through the facilities of the same engine, so may result in idle time on a machine and the accumulation of another job on the machine. PT. XYZ used production scheduling by FCFS rule that still result in a delay in the completion of orders and there was so much undone job because makespan values was too large. The {{purpose of this study was}} to minimize the makespan, namely the Tabu Search Algorithm. Results from this study is the reduction occurred from time to schedule company with Tabu Search Algorithm is from 141. 22 hours or minutes become 132. 14 8473. 2 7928. 4 hours or minutes. Relative Error shows that the savings obtained makespan between Tabu Search Algorithm with the method of company is 6. 8715 % and the value of Efficiency Index is 1. 068715. It can be concluded that the Tabu Search Algorithm produces a smaller makespan than the company actual scheduling...|$|R
40|$|A {{system for}} {{coupling}} a vascular overflow graft or cannula to a heart pump. A pump pipe outlet {{is provided with}} an external tapered surface which receives {{the end of a}} compressible connula. An annular compression ring with a tapered internal bore surface is arranged about the cannula with the tapered internal surface in a facing relationship to the external tapered surface. The angle of inclination of the tapered surfaces is converging such that the spacing between the tapered surfaces decreases {{from one end of the}} external tapered surface to the other end thereby providing a clamping action of the tapered surface on a cannula which increases as a function of the length of cannula segment between the tapered surfaces. The annular compression ring is disposed within a tubular locking <b>nut</b> which threadedly <b>couples</b> to the pump and provides a compression force for urging the annular ring onto the cannula between the tapered surfaces. The nut has a threaded connection to the pump body. The threaded coupling to the pump body provides a compression force for the annular ring. The annular ring has an annular enclosure space in which excess cannula material from the compression between the tapered surfaces to "bunch up" in the space and serve as an enlarged annular ring segment to assist holding the cannula in place. The clamped cannula provides a seamless joint connection to the pump pipe outlet where the clamping force is uniformly applied to the cannula because of self alignment of the tapered surfaces. The nut can be easily disconnected to replace the pump if necessary...|$|R
