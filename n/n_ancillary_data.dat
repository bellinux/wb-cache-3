40|$|To provide {{reliable}} {{estimates for}} mapping soil properties for precision agriculture requires intensive sampling and costly laboratory analyses. If the spatial structure of <b>ancillary</b> <b>data,</b> such as yield, digital information from aerial photographs, and soil electrical conductivity (EC) measurements, relates {{to that of}} soil properties they {{could be used to}} guide the sampling intensity for soil surveys. Variograins of permanent soil properties at two study sites on different parent materials were compared {{with each other and with}} those for <b>ancillary</b> <b>data.</b> The ranges of spatial dependence identified by the variograms of both sets of properties are of similar orders of magnitude for each study site, Maps of the <b>ancillary</b> <b>data</b> appear to show similar patterns of variation and these seem to relate to those of the permanent properties of the soil. Correlation analysis has confirmed these relations. Maps of kriged estimates from sub-sampled data and the original variograrns showed that the main patterns of variation were preserved when a sampling interval of less than half the average variogram range of <b>ancillary</b> <b>data</b> was used. Digital data from aerial photographs for different years and EC appear to show a more consistent relation with the soil properties than does yield.

40|$|<b>Ancillary</b> <b>data</b> such as elevation, slope, rainfall, crop {{planting}} date, etc., {{have been}} recognized for some time as containing useful information for improving data analysis accuracy.

40|$|Site-specific {{management}} requires accurate {{knowledge of}} the spatial variation {{in a range of}} soil properties within fields. This involves considerable sampling effort, which is costly. <b>Ancillary</b> <b>data,</b> such as crop yield, elevation and apparent electrical conductivity (ECa) of the soil, can provide insight into the spatial variation of some soil properties. A multivariate classification with spatial constraint imposed by the variogram was used to classify data from two arable crop fields. The yield data comprised 5 years of crop yield, and the <b>ancillary</b> <b>data</b> 3 years of yield data, elevation and ECa. Information on soil chemical and physical properties was provided by intensive surveys of the soil. Multivariate variograms computed from these data were used to constrain sites spatially within classes to increase their contiguity. The constrained classifications resulted in coherent classes, and those based on the <b>ancillary</b> <b>data</b> were similar to those from the soil properties. The <b>ancillary</b> <b>data</b> seemed to identify areas in the field where the soil is reasonably homogeneous.

40|$|Continuous satellite-derived cloud records now extend {{over three}} decades, and are {{increasingly}} used for climate applications. Certain applications, such as trend detection, require {{a clear understanding}} of uncertainty as it relates to establishing statistical significance. The use of reanalysis products as sources of <b>ancillary</b> <b>data</b> could be construed as one such source of uncertainty, as there has been discussion regarding the suitability of reanalysis products for trend detection. Here we use three reanalysis products: Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR), Modern Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) and European Center for Medium range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF) ERA-Interim (ERA-I) as sources of <b>ancillary</b> <b>data</b> for the Pathfinder Atmospheres Extended/Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (PATMOS-x/AVHRR) Satellite Cloud Climate Data Record (CDR), and perform inter-comparisons to determine how sensitive the climatology is to choice of <b>ancillary</b> <b>data</b> source. We find differences among reanalysis fields required for PATMOS-x processing, which translate to small but not insignificant differences in retrievals of cloud fraction, cloud top height and cloud optical depth. The retrieval variability due to choice of reanalysis product is on the order of one third the size of the retrieval uncertainty, making it a potentially significant factor in trend detection. Cloud fraction trends were impacted the most by choice of reanalysis while cloud optical depth trends were impacted the least. Metrics used to determine the skill of the reanalysis products for use as <b>ancillary</b> <b>data</b> found no clear best choice for use in PATMOS-x. We conclude use of reanalysis products as <b>ancillary</b> <b>data</b> in the PATMOS-x/AVHRR Cloud CDR do not preclude its use for trend detection, but for that application uncertainty in reanalysis fields should be better represented in the PATMOS-x retrieval uncertainty...|$|R
