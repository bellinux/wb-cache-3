5|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{although}} Oswald {{was active in}} promoting cults, he does not generally seem to have used relic collecting {{as a means of}} gaining control of the assets of secular communities, and Dunstan displayed <b>no</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> relics.|$|E
5|$|A June 1999 poll {{conducted}} by Gonzales/Arscott Communications Inc., a polling {{firm based in}} Annapolis, Maryland, showed Schaefer ahead of Bell.

5|$|A play, The Doom Bar, about {{smuggling}} and wrecking {{was written}} in the early 1900s by Arthur Hansen Bush. Although there was <b>no</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> London it was well received in America, and was scheduled to tour in Chicago and New York. A series of mishaps, blamed on the legendary wrecker Cruel Coppinger, culminating in a fire at Baltimore, caused the play to be considered cursed by America's actors' unions and its members were banned from appearing in it.|$|E
5|$|Although Braille was {{admired and}} {{respected}} by his pupils, his writing system was not {{taught at the}} Institute during his lifetime. The successors of Valentin Haüy, {{who had died in}} 1822, showed <b>no</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> altering the established methods of the school, and indeed, they were actively hostile to its use. Dr. Alexandre François-René Pignier, headmaster at the school, was dismissed from his post after he had a history book translated into braille.|$|E
5|$|Although he had <b>no</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> {{politics}} at first, Dawson {{ran in the}} 1935 election as a Social Credit candidate in the riding of Little Bow, {{at the urging of}} a citizens' group. He defeated United Farmers of Alberta candidate and former speaker Oran McPherson by 66% of the vote. Dawson was re-elected seven consecutive times and held his seat for twenty-eight years.|$|E

5|$|Annie and Alvy, in a {{line for}} The Sorrow and the Pity, overhear another man deriding the work of Federico Fellini and Marshall McLuhan; McLuhan himself steps in at Alvy's {{invitation}} to criticize the man's comprehension. That night, Annie shows <b>no</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> sex with Alvy. Instead, they discuss his first wife, whose ardor gave him no pleasure. His second marriage was to a New York writer who didn't like sports {{and was unable to}} reach orgasm.|$|E
5|$|At age 9, Gandhi {{entered the}} local school in Rajkot, near his home. There he studied the rudiments of arithmetic, history, the Gujarati {{language}} and geography.

He was an average student, won some prizes, but was a shy and tongue tied student, with <b>no</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> games; his only companions were books and school lessons.|$|E
5|$|Chris Carter {{had envisioned}} Lance Henriksen portraying the {{character}} of Frank Black, long before he was ever contacted. Although Carter's colleagues responded positively to the selection, the Fox Network wanted someone younger {{to take the lead}} part. Fox asked William Hurt to play the lead role, but after finding out that Hurt had <b>no</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> acting on television, Henriksen got the part.|$|E

5|$|Coke {{was noted}} as {{deriving}} great enjoyment from and working {{hard at the}} law, but enjoying little else. He was versed in the Latin classics and maintained a sizeable estate, but the law was his primary concern. Francis Bacon, his main competitor, {{was known as a}} philosopher and man of learning, but Coke had <b>no</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> such subjects. Notably, when given a copy of the Novum Organum by Bacon, Coke wrote puerile insults in it.|$|E
5|$|Prince Henry showed <b>no</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> Catherine as a wife; instead, he openly took mistresses. For {{the first}} ten years of the marriage, Catherine failed to produce any children. In 1537, Philippa Duci, one of Henry's mistresses, {{gave birth to a}} daughter, whom he {{publicly}} acknowledged. This proved that Henry was fertile and added to the pressure on Catherine to produce a child.|$|E
5|$|Replying to the Wrights' letters, the U.S. {{military}} expressed virtually <b>no</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> their claims. The brothers {{turned their}} attention to Europe, especially France, where enthusiasm for aviation ran high, and journeyed there {{for the first time in}} 1907 for face-to-face talks with government officials and businessmen. They also met with aviation representatives in Germany and Britain. Before traveling, Orville shipped a newly built Model A Flyer to France in anticipation of demonstration flights.|$|E

5|$|Shea {{was born}} September 5, 1925, {{and grew up}} in the Bronx, the eldest son in a working-class Irish Catholic family. His father worked as a {{mechanic}} on the New York City Subway.

5|$|The {{story begins}} in 1994. An {{outstanding}} student, Shen Chia-yi, is popular among her teachers and classmates. Ko Ching-teng, a mischievous and poor student, {{claims that he}} has <b>no</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> her, despite being her classmate since junior high school. One day, Ching-teng is caught masturbating during class, and the principal reseats him, placing {{him in front of}} Chia-yi.|$|E
5|$|There were {{setbacks}} with distribution, however. United Artists, {{which had}} {{ownership of the}} movie, changed hands and the new owners had <b>no</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> the movie. Carradine bought the movie back from U.A., {{and set out to}} find a distributor. The picture was picked up by Crown International, which specialized in teen exploitation films. Just two weeks before the opening was scheduled, Carradine was still shooting some additional scenes.|$|E

5|$|Although {{proposals}} for television projects were submitted to him, he had <b>no</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> {{working outside the}} film world. Nevertheless, the hard-drinking director did agree to appear {{in a series of}} television ads for Suntory whiskey, which aired in 1976. While fearing that he might never be able to make another film, the director nevertheless continued working on various projects, writing scripts and creating detailed illustrations, intending to leave behind a visual record of his plans in case he {{would never be able to}} film his stories.|$|E
5|$|De la Rúa's {{government}} would face {{an economic crisis}} and the 2001 riots, resigning two years later. De la Rúa thought that Duhalde had organized a coup d'état against him Rodolfo Terragno, De la Rúa's Chief of the Cabinet of Ministers, thought instead that the crisis was the exclusive result of keeping the peso-dollar parity despite the costs generated by it. Duhalde and other Peronists interviewed by Ceferino Reato for the book Doce noches said that the party had <b>no</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> removing De la Rúa from power, {{because he was so}} unpopular that the party would win the 2003 presidential elections without a problem.|$|E
5|$|Education was {{provided}} for the children, but workhouse teachers were a particular problem. Poorly paid, without any formal training, and facing large classes of unruly children with little or <b>no</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> their lessons, few stayed in the job {{for more than a}} few months. In an effort to force workhouses to offer at least a basic level of education, legislation was passed in 1845 requiring that all pauper apprentices should be able to read and sign their own indenture papers. A training college for workhouse teachers was set up at Kneller Hall in Twickenham during the 1840s, but it closed in the following decade.|$|E
