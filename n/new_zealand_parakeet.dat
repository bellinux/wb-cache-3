5000|$|The {{three species}} of kākāriki or <b>New</b> <b>Zealand</b> <b>parakeets</b> {{are the most}} common species of parakeets in the genus Cyanoramphus, family Psittacidae. The birds' Māori name, which is the most {{commonly}} used, means [...] "small parrot". The etymology is: from kākā, parrot + riki, small. [...] The word is also used to refer to the colour green because of the birds' predominantly green plumage. The patches of red on the birds' rumps are, according to legend, the blood of the demigod Tāwhaki.The three species on mainland <b>New</b> <b>Zealand</b> are the yellow-crowned parakeet (Cyanoramphus auriceps), the red-crowned parakeet, or red-fronted parakeet (C. novaezelandiae), and the critically endangered Malherbe's parakeet or orange-fronted parakeet (not to be confused with Aratinga canicularis a popular aviary bird known as the orange-fronted conure, orange-fronted parakeet or half-moon conure - C. malherbi).|$|R
50|$|Although {{it is now}} infrequent, {{individual}} aerial 1080 operations can still sometimes affect local bird populations if not carried out with sufficient care. In <b>New</b> <b>Zealand,</b> individuals from 19 species of native birds and 13 species of introduced birds have been found dead after aerial 1080 drops. Most of these recorded bird deaths were associated with only four operations in the 1970s that used poor-quality carrot baits with many small fragments. On the other hand, many native <b>New</b> <b>Zealand</b> bird populations have been successfully protected by reducing predator numbers through aerial 1080 operations. Blue duck, <b>New</b> <b>Zealand</b> pigeon, kiwi, <b>New</b> <b>Zealand</b> kaka, <b>New</b> <b>Zealand</b> falcon, tomtit, South Island robin, North Island robin, <b>New</b> <b>Zealand</b> <b>parakeets</b> (kākāriki), and yellowhead (mōhua) have all responded well to pest control programmes using aerial 1080 operations, with increased chick and adult survival, and increases in population size. In contrast, seven of 38 tagged kea, the endemic alpine parrot, were killed during an aerial possum control operation in Ōkārito Forest conducted by DOC and AHB in August 2011. Because of their omnivorous feeding habits and inquisitive behaviour, kea {{are known to be}} particularly susceptible to 1080 poison baits, as well as other environmental poisons like the zinc and lead used in the flashings of backcountry huts and farm buildings.|$|R
50|$|The Chatham parakeet (Cyanoramphus forbesi), {{also known}} as Forbes' parakeet, is a rare parakeet endemic to the Chatham Islands group, <b>New</b> <b>Zealand.</b> This <b>parakeet</b> is one of <b>New</b> <b>Zealand’s</b> rarest birds and is {{classified}} as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List, {{as a result of}} a range of threats to the species survival, including habitat loss, predation, and hybridization. A number of conservation methods have been employed to assist the recovery of this species, and currently the population trend is considered stable.|$|R
40|$|In this study, a {{visit to}} the remote Kermadec {{archipelago}} and the translocation of two parakeet species to novel sites opened up opportunities to document aspects of the biology of free-living and captive-bred parakeets. Four years after the eradication of cats and rats on Raoul Island by the Department of Conservation, the Kermadec redfronted parakeet has naturally recolonised this site, potentially from the adjacent Herald Islets. Over a period of three weeks in March-April 2008, 100 parakeets were captured on Raoul Island and the first evidence of nesting of the species at this site since 1836 was recorded. These observations reinforce the view that eradication of introduced predators such as cats and rats is a requisite for the recovery and establishment of populations of <b>New</b> <b>Zealand</b> <b>parakeets.</b> These observations also suggest that strategic eradication of cats and rats can facilitate the natural dispersal of parakeets. Taking into account the remarkable recolonisation of parakeets on Raoul Island and the existence of islands free of introduced mammalian predators and red-fronted parakeets in the Hauraki Gulf, a translocation of parakeets was envisaged. Between April and May 2008, 32 red-fronted parakeets were translocated from Little Barrier Island to Motuihe Island, in the first translocation of the species within the Hauraki Gulf in 32 years. Alongside such transfer, a total of 62 captive-bred Malherbe’s parakeets were monitored on Maud Island, in the Marlborough Sounds. Because the translocations of red-fronted and Malherbe’s parakeets were temporally close, a unique opportunity to study translocated free-living and captive-bred parakeets was identified. The focus of monitoring on both sites was the detection of successful nesting attempts, a short-term measure of translocation success. On both sites (Motuihe and Maud Islands) evidence of successful nesting was found within a year of the release of the first flocks. As part of the planning steps for the translocation of red-fronted parakeets, a survey was designed for four selected microorganisms of conservation concern for <b>New</b> <b>Zealand</b> parrots: Campylobacter, Salmonella, Yersinia and the beak and feather disease virus (BFDV). Only the latest was detected at a prevalence of 28 % on Little Barrier Island. Subsequent isolation and sequencing of BFDV genomes revealed a previously undescribed genotype of this virus in <b>New</b> <b>Zealand.</b> The discovery of a new BFDV genome in a wild population of endemic <b>New</b> <b>Zealand</b> <b>parakeets</b> highlights need of future research. BFDV is known to affect the immune system and survival of infected individuals in other species and is likely to hamper conservation efforts for threatened parrot species. The challenges to study BFDV in <b>New</b> <b>Zealand,</b> a global hotspot of parrot diversity, are outlined and high priority lines of research are identified and discussed...|$|R
40|$|This study {{describes}} the isolation and characterisation of microsatellite loci in Forbes’ parakeet (Cyanoramphus forbesi). These molecular markers {{are used to}} assess the status of interspecific hybridisation between Forbes’ parakeets and Chatham Island Red-crowned parakeets (C. novaezelandiae chathamensis) on Mangere and Little Mangere Islands in the Chatham Islands group. The evolution of these microsatellite loci in parrots is also investigated. Forbes’ parakeets are facing the problem of genetic introgression due to extensive hybridisation with Chatham Island Red-crowned parakeets. Hybrids show a spectrum of crown morphologies between the parent species (Nixon 1982), but identification of hybrids based on morphology alone is not foolproof. Mitochondrial DNA studies by Boon (2000) showed that Forbes’ parakeet is a distinct lineage, basal to all other <b>New</b> <b>Zealand</b> <b>parakeets</b> but several Forbes’ morphotypes have Chatham Island Redcrowned parakeet haplotype. However, mitochondrial DNA markers only probe the maternally inherited lineages and cannot tell the whole story. The microsatellite markers used in this study show that interspecific hybridisation between Forbes parakeet and Chatham Island Red-crowned parakeet is more extensive than previously expected. Microsatellite data combined with results from scoring mitochondrial DNA haplotypes show that crown morphology alone under-represents the proportion of hybrids in the population, and {{that a large number of}} cryptic hybrids (77. 9 %) show Forbes’ parakeet morphotypes. A three factor scoring system is suggested in which a parakeet must pass both genetic (microsatellites and mitochondrial) and morphological criteria to be considered a “pure” Forbes’ parakeet. Using this system, 17. 8 %, 1. 2 %, and 81. 0 % of the Mangere Island parakeet population are “pure” Forbes’ parakeets, “pure” Chatham Island Red-crowned parakeets, and interspecific hybrids respectively. The results of this study have implications for the future conservation of Forbes’ parakeet. Because interspecific hybridisation makes no positive contribution to the long-term survival of Forbes’ parakeets, conservation measures to limit contact between the two species should be taken to control further hybridisation of parakeets on Mangere Island. The microsatellite loci isolated in this study are found to evolve following the patterns best described by either the Stepwise Mutation Model (SMM; Ohta & Kimura 1973) or the Two-Phase Model (TPM; Di Rienzo et al. 1994) at population level. By mapping the evolutionary changes in repeat motif variations to a parrot phylogeny, it is suggested that these loci may evolve through a more complex model than sole repeat number changes...|$|R
