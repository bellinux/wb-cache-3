Ganymede receives about 0.08Sv (8rem) of radiation per day. Callisto is farther from Jupiter's strong radiation belt and subject to only 0.0001Sv (0.01rem) a day. For comparison, the average amount of radiation taken on Earth by a living organism is about 0.0024Sv per year; the highest <b>natural</b> <b>radiation</b> levels on Earth are recorded around Ramsar hot springs at about 0.26Sv per year.|$|E

25|$|In April 2011, the United States Department of Energy {{published}} {{projections of}} the radiation risks {{over the next year}} (that is, for the future) for people living in the neighborhood of the plant. Potential exposure could exceed 20mSv/year (2 rems/year) in some areas up to 50kilometers from the plant. That is the level at which relocation would be considered in the USA, and it is a level that could cause roughly one extra cancer case in 500 young adults. However, <b>natural</b> <b>radiation</b> levels are higher {{in some parts of the}} world than the projected level mentioned above, and about 4 people out of 10 can be expected to develop cancer without exposure to radiation. Further, the radiation exposure resulting from the incident for most people living in Fukushima is so small compared to background radiation that it may be impossible to find statistically significant evidence of increases in cancer.|$|E
