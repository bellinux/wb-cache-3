30|$|This {{paper is}} devoted to the {{investigation}} of the corrosion resistance of nanopowders of borides and carbides of zirconium, titanium, vanadium, chromium, molybdenum, and tungsten in the <b>nickeling</b> electrolytes depending on the acidity of the electrolyte, temperature, and duration of the interaction.|$|E
30|$|It {{was shown}} that the {{corrosion}} resistance in standard <b>nickeling</b> electrolytes for nanopowders of silicon carbide, {{as well as for}} zirconium, titanium, vanadium, chromium, molybdenum, and tungsten borides and carbides, depends on the acidity of the electrolyte, the temperature, and the treatment duration.|$|E
30|$|The {{corrosion}} resistance of nanopowders of borides and carbides of metals of IV–VIB groups, {{as well as}} of silicon carbide, was studied in the standard <b>nickeling</b> electrolytes. As objects of study, nanopowders with the content of the main phase 91.8 – 97.6 % and with the average particle size 32 – 78  nm were used. Their {{corrosion resistance}} was evaluated depending on the acidity of the electrolyte, temperature, and duration of the interaction. It was found that, by the corrosion resistance in the electrolytes solutions, nanopowders of borides and carbides within each group of compounds are similar and characterized by unlimited period of induction in alkaline media. An exception is the nanopowder of silicon carbide which is resistant to the solution of any acidity.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of the present investigation was to study {{the influence of the}} occupational <b>nickel</b> exposure on the concentration of <b>nickel</b> in nasal mucosa, plasma and urine. Plasma, urine and biopsy specimens of nasal mucosa from 318 <b>nickel</b> workers, 15 retired <b>nickel</b> workers and 57 non-exposed controls were analyzed for <b>nickel</b> by atomic absorption spectrometry. The results showed that <b>nickel</b> exposure led significantly to raised <b>nickel</b> concentration in nasal mucosa, plasma and urine both in active and retired <b>nickel</b> workers. The average <b>nickel</b> concentration in the nasal mucosa was highest in workers exposed to the highest atmospheric <b>nickel</b> concentration, inhaled as <b>nickel</b> subsulphide and oxide dust.

Furthermore, the <b>nickel</b> nitrate adsorbent exhibited better sulfur capacity, metallic dispersion compared to the <b>nickel</b> formate and <b>nickel</b> acetate adsorbents.
