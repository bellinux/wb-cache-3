500|$|Fortuyn {{announced}} {{his intention to}} run for parliament in a television interview on 20August2001. An unusual aspect of this {{was that it was}} not yet clear which political party he would be a candidate for. Although he was already in contact with the Livable Netherlands (LN) party, he initially also considered running for the CDA or creating his own list. On 25November he was chosen as party leader for the LN. The LN functioned as the <b>national</b> <b>extension</b> of a movement that had contested municipal but never national elections. Fortuyn concluded his acceptance speech by saying the words that would become his slogan; [...] "At your service!" [...] Almost immediately after Fortuyn became leader, LN went from 2% in opinion polls to about 17%. In January2002, it was announced that Fortuyn also would head the Livable Rotterdam (LR) list for the March2002 local elections. The official 2002 election study found that immigration and integration problems were the second most important issue for voters after issues concerning the health care system. Helped by the many speeches and interviews given by Fortuyn, immigration issues became the major topic of the national political agenda, thereby forcing other parties to react.|$|E
