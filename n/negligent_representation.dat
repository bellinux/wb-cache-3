50|$|On April 6, 2009, Zuckerman filed {{a lawsuit}} against J. Ezra Merkin and his Gabriel Capital LP. The lawsuit claims fraud and <b>negligent</b> <b>representation</b> and seeks {{unspecified}} punitive damages. Merkin had a “huge incentive not to disclose Madoff’s role, especially to investors like Zuckerman” because he charged clients “substantial fees” to manage both his Ascot Partners LP and Gabriel Capital. The lawsuit claims over US$40 million in losses for placing his assets with Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC without his knowledge. Zuckerman invested US$25 million with Merkin’s Ascot Fund in 2006 through his Charitable Remainder Trust or CRT Investments Limited and personally invested US$15 million with Merkin’s Gabriel Capital. Merkin charged Zuckerman a 1.5% fee and imposed significant “lock-up restrictions on redemptions", but his agreement with Gabriel Capital contains an arbitration clause against Merkin for his lost personal US$15 million investment. The lawsuit also named the accounting firm BDO Seidman LLP and a related entity called BDO Tortuga as defendants.|$|E
