In addition, it is seen that the nitro group was a stronger electron-withdrawing group and led to a less thermally stable polymer compared to the chloro group. Based on the FTIR spectra of these copolymers, the following observations were made: (1) the formation of <b>N-phenylmaleimide</b> products from the imidization of maleic anhydride was more complete than the 42 ̆ 7 -N-maleimido- 2, 32 ̆ 7 -dimethylazobenzene products, (2) the imidization of maleic anhydride was complete for the [92 : 8] copolymers, but incomplete for the [50 : 50] copolymers, (3) polymerization reactions including both emulsion and solution polymerizations were preferred over imidization reaction, and (4) solution polymerization was more favorable in the incorporation of imide than emulsion polymerization. From the analogy of TGA and DSC characteristics, the [50 : 50] and [92 : 8] polymers were alternating and random copolymers, respectively. Polymers synthesized by emulsion and solution polymerizations were random copolymers. The emulsion polymerized materials decomposed at higher temperatures than the solution polymerized materials. Most of the copolymer products were amorphous copolymers as no crystallization or melting behavior was observed on their DSC thermograms...|$|E
