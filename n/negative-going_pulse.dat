5000|$|The main pulse {{definition}} is as follows: a <b>negative-going</b> <b>pulse</b> of 300 mV lasting 40 sample clocks {{followed by a}} positive-going pulse of 300 mV lasting 40 sample clocks. The allowed rise/fall time {{for each of the}} transitions is 4 sample clocks. This is with a clock rate of 74.25 MHz ...|$|E
40|$|A circuit is {{described}} for {{the measurement of}} the cumulative amplitude probability distribution of electrical signals. Details are given {{of the use of}} the apparatus in noise and aerodynamic turbulence measurements. The input level is 0. 6 volts peak-to-peak (100 mV R. M. S. with a Gaussian probability distribution), and the frequency response is approximately 10 c/s to 70 kc/s. The output signal is obtained as a train of 3 volt <b>negative-going</b> <b>pulses</b> which are integrated on a galvanometer...|$|R
40|$|A {{low-power}} CMOS peak detecting {{track and}} hold circuit optimized for nuclear pulse spectroscopy is presented. The circuit topology {{eliminates the need for}} a rectifying diode, reducing the effect of charge injection into the hold capacitor, incorporates a linear gate at the input to prevent pulse pileup, and uses dynamic bias control that minimizes both pedestal and droop. Both positive-going and <b>negative-going</b> <b>pulses</b> are accommodated using a complementary set of {{track and hold}} circuits. Full characterization of the design fabricated in 1. 2 {mu}m CMOS including dynamic range, integral nonlinearity, droop rate, pedestal, and power measurements is presented. Additionally, analysis and design approaches for optimization of operational characteristics are discussed...|$|R
50|$|In {{the timing}} diagram, the {{horizontal}} axis represents time. The vertical axis represents: (top row) amplitude of radio frequency pulses; (middle rows) amplitudes {{of the three}} orthogonal magnetic field gradient pulses; and (bottom row) receiver analog-to-digital converter (ADC). Radio frequencies are transmitted at the Larmor frequency of the nuclide to be imaged. For example, for 1H in a magnetic field of 1 T, a frequency of 42.5781 MHz would be employed. The three field gradients are labeled GX (typically corresponding to a patient's left-to-right direction and colored red in diagram), GY (typically corresponding to a patient's front-to-back direction and colored green in diagram), and GZ (typically corresponding to a patient's head-to-toe direction and colored blue in diagram). Where <b>negative-going</b> gradient <b>pulses</b> are shown, they represent reversal of the gradient direction, i.e., right-to-left, back-to-front or toe-to-head. For human scanning, gradient strengths of 1-100 mT/m are employed: Higher gradient strengths permit better resolution and faster imaging. The pulse sequence shown here would produce a transverse (axial) image.|$|R
