[...] Harper was also enthusiastic: [...] "This performance for me represents what I like about New Directions—and why Kurt <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> back asap. Everyone {{got to do}} their own individual thing, yet they still work really well as a group. I give it best song of the night."

[...] In I Am Legend, Will Smith's character is the last healthy human in New York City and lives with his dog. In order {{to figure out what}} is going on, Jonathan does investigative work and downloads Don Geiss's schedule while self-narrating to the theme music of [...] (1996).

Bobsled!" [...] This is a reference to the comedy movie Cool Runnings (1993) in which the Jamaica national bobsled team made their debut in the 1988 Winter Olympics.

500|$|... "Beautiful People" [...] is an uptempo electro house, dancehall and Europop {{song with}} R influences. According to James Dean Wells from AOL Radio, {{the song is}} [...] " [...] pulsing synths that build under Benassi and Brown's staccato and auto-tuned melodies." [...] "Beautiful People" [...] is set in common time with a {{moderate}} tempo of 126 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of Eb major with Brown's vocal range spanning from the note of Eb4 to the note of F5. The song is positive and uplifting with lyrics such as: [...] "Everywhere that I've been / The only thing that I see is beautiful people ... / Don't you know / Don't you know / You're beautiful." [...] According to Rap-Up, on the song, Brown encourages [...] "everyone {{on the dance floor}} to keep their heads up and discover the beauty inside." [...] When speaking about [...] "Beautiful People", Brown told Jayson Rodriguez from MTV News that [...] "it wasn't a selfish record, it wasn't me bragging or boasting or talking about cars or money or girls. It was me being able to inspire people with dance music. We have a lot of tragic things going on and the world <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> together as a whole and stop the negativity." ...|$|E
500|$|Also in 1996, Murphy began {{studying}} law at University College Cork (UCC), but he failed {{his first year}} exams because, as he put it, he had [...] "no ambitions to do it". Not only was he busy with his band, but {{he has said that}} he knew within days after starting at UCC that law was not what he wanted to do. After seeing Corcadorca's stage production of , directed by Kiernan, acting had begun to pique his interest. His first major role was in the UCC Drama Society's amateur production of Observe the Sons of Ulster Marching Towards the Somme, also starring Irish American comedian, Des Bishop. Murphy also played the lead in a UCC Drama production of Little Shop of Horrors, which was performed in the Cork Opera House. According to Murphy, his primary motivation then was to party and meet women, not to begin an acting career. Nonetheless, he began to move away from working as a rock musician, about which he later remarked, [...] "I think there's {{such a thing as a}} performance gene. If it's in your DNA it <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> out. For me it originally came out through music, then segued into acting and came out through there. I always needed to get up and perform." ...|$|E

Deangelo's popularity with the employees causes Michael to get jealous to the point where he passes out peanut butter sandwiches, despite Deangelo's peanut allergy. Deangelo then assembles the staff in the [...] "multipurpose room", including Dwight, who learned from Gabe Lewis (Zach Woods) that Michael did not put in a recommendation and thus snubs Michael. Jim quietly tells Michael that he chose to resign his job and <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> to terms with both that choice and the fact that life is going to go on at the office. Deangelo then steps out of his meeting and asks Michael for advice for how to run the meeting, saying that he is a good manager and Dunder Mifflin will not be the same without him. The two make up with a reverse hug, Deangelo telling him that he should start enjoying his retirement. Michael returns to his office while Deangelo conducts his meeting in the conference room.|$|E

2500|$|In April 2008, the Daily News {{reported}} that Issa questioned federal expenditures pertaining to disability-compensation claims from 9/11 first responders.

[...] In September 2009, Issa's office released a statement indicating that his comments had been misrepresented and that the questions he asked concerned the then still unpassed bill H.R. 3543, which, according to that statement [...] "would give U.S. taxpayer dollars to those who did not suffer physical injury and did not work at or around Ground Zero." ...|$|E

[...] In response, on July 21, 2010, The Hutchinson News, a local paper in Hutchinson, Kansas, withdrew their endorsement of Mann, saying that Mann [...] "questions the citizenship of President Barack Obama despite evidence that is irrefutable to most objective, rational people– including a birth certificate released by the Hawaii secretary of state and birth announcements printed in Honolulu's two major newspapers". Mann responded that he was [...] "disappointed and mystified by the Hutchinson News decision to withdraw their endorsement over a misunderstanding of [...] position", as he is not [...] "interested in pursuing this issue in Congress", and he has [...] "never had any interest in spending any time on the matter". Mann was subsequently defeated in the Republican primary by state senator Tim Huelskamp.|$|E

Because his melodies make so much sense of everything, it would be ridiculous to put out these recordings, as exciting as they are, without the melodies. We have talked about people who Tim would approve of adding vocals, under his direction. I think Tim just wants to be well enough to really be producing it. I think his big drive at the moment is to finish off things that were started. There are a lot of loose ends that need tying up.|$|E
