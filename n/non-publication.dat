The data {{should be used}} in conjunction with the OSCAR 3 software as described in the project reportThe life sciences nowadays are characterized by rapid growth. Due to the huge number of publications per year – in the hundreds of thousands and growing – it is becoming increasingly difficult for the researchers to stay abreast of the latest developments. Thus, automated methods of analysing the scientific information grow in importance. Text mining in the Life Sciences aims at extracting information from textual data (usually abstracts or full texts of scientific publications, but also <b>non-publications</b> like clinical histories or patents). It normally involves some kind of machine learning technique that requires training data from the given thematical domain. Our case study concerns the automatic identification of chemical named entities (e. g. compounds, reaction names) from the life science literature. We investigate the impact of the data heterogeneity on the performance of Maximum Entropy Markov models and explore possible solutions to this problem. This is, {{to the best of our}} knowledge, the first study to explore thematical heterogeneity in the chemistry-related life science literature and its impact on named entity recognition. Thus it is necessarily general - its role is to collect evidence, establish basic facts and explore possible solutions. In doing so, our study suggests that the genre structure is especially important for high precision recognition. It also suggests that a system aiming at recall, rather than precision, transferring training data from one domain to another is a useful strategy (especially in respect to the domains having smaller training datasets). But, most importantly, this study provides motivation for a model that explicitly models the thematic heterogeneity of the life science literature. It explores possible solutions and the practical issues of such implementation...|$|R

In December 2011, three justices of the NSW Court of Appeal lifted the suppression orders on the case. However, a stay was granted until 3 February 2012 and extended by the High Court of Australia until 9 March 2012.

5000|$|Multiple factors {{contribute}} to publication bias. For instance, once a scientific finding is well established, it may become newsworthy to publish reliable papers that fail to reject the null hypothesis.

Factors cited as underlying this effect include investigators assuming they must have made a mistake, failure to support a known finding, loss of interest in the topic, or anticipation that others will be uninterested in the null results. The nature of these issues and the problems that have been triggered, have been referred to as the 5 diseases that threaten science, which include: [...] "significosis, an inordinate focus on statistically significant results; neophilia, an excessive appreciation for novelty; theorrhea, a mania for new theory; arigorium, a deficiency of rigor in theoretical and empirical work; and finally, disjunctivitis, a proclivity to produce large quantities of redundant, trivial, and incoherent works." ...|$|E

A heavy workload (limiting the time available for drafting a publication) and unwillingness to submit incomplete or preliminary studies were the main barriers to submission for publication.

40|$|The Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) {{promotes}} academic excellence through competitive {{selection of}} study proposals and rigorous evaluation of feasibility, but completion status and publication history of SNSF-supported randomised clinical trials (RCTs) remain unclear. The main objectives were to review all healthcare RCTs {{supported by the}} SNSF for trial discontinuation and <b>non-publication,</b> to investigate potential risk factors for trial discontinuation due to poor recruitment and <b>non-publication,</b> and to compare findings to other Swiss RCTs {{not supported by the}} SNSF. We established a retrospective cohort of all SNSF-supported RCTs for which recruitment and funding had ended in 2015 or earlier. For each RCT, two investigators independently searched corresponding publications in electronic databases. In addition, we approached all principal investigators to ask for additional publications and information about trial discontinuation. Teams of two investigators independently extracted details about study design, recruitment of participants, outcomes, analysis and sample size from the original proposal and, if available, from trial registries and publications. We used multivariable regression analysis to explore potential risk factors associated with discontinuation due to poor recruitment and with <b>non-publication,</b> and to compare our results with data from a previous cohort of Swiss RCTs not supported by the SNSF. We included 101 RCTs supported by the SNSF between 1986 and 2015. Eighty-seven (86 %) principal investigators responded to our survey. Overall, 69 (68 %) RCTs were completed, 26 (26 %) RCTs were prematurely discontinued (all due to slow recruitment) and the completion status remained unclear for 6 (6 %) RCTs. For analysing publication status, we excluded 4 RCTs for which follow-up was still ongoing and 9 for which manuscripts were still in preparation. Of the remaining 88 RCTs, 53 (60 %) were published as full articles in peer-reviewed journals. Multivariable regression models suggested that discontinued trials were at higher risk for <b>non-publication</b> than completed trials (adjusted OR 7. 61; 95 %[*]CI 2. 44 to 27. 09). Compared with other Swiss RCTs, the risk of discontinuation for SNSF-supported RCTs was higher than in industry-initiated RCTs (adjusted OR 3. 84; 95 %[*]CI 1. 68 to 8. 74), but not significantly different from investigator-initiated RCTs not supported by the SNSF (adjusted OR 1. 05; 95 %[*]CI 0. 51 to 2. 11). We found no evidence that the proportion of discontinued or unpublished RCTs decreased over the last 20 years. One out of four SNSF-supported RCTs were prematurely discontinued due to slow recruitment, 40 % of all included RCTs and 70 % of all discontinued RCTs were not published in peer-reviewed journals.
