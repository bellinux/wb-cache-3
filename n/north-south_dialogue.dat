The second part of this dissertation is dealing with the war against the "Dutch" and with the Brazilian Policy to rebuilt Portuguese Empire, the mutual aid between both sides of South Atlantic. After the first and second world wars it is considered the discussion that Portugal had to face in the U. N.

40|$|General {{inequality}} in development between global North and South {{is identified as}} {{a major source of}} crises threatening global peace and security. <b>North-South</b> <b>Dialogue</b> is an approach designed to use summits, conferences, dialogues, negotiations, and meetings to achieve agreements, and programmes that can reduce this imbalance.

40|$|This chapter {{argues that}} <b>North-South</b> <b>dialogue</b> is heavily {{influenced}} by the colonial past and burdened by extreme power inequalities. Former colonizing nations control many of the agendas of such dialogue, exposing it to the risks of paternalism, post-colonialism, and tutelage. As a result, coloniality is a condition difficult to escape in <b>north-south</b> <b>dialogue.</b> South-south dialogue, on the other hand, is less implicated by this burden, thus offering a platform for a potentially free - and freeing – critical interchange of ideas and empirical examples that reflect subaltern experiences and provide opportunities for mutual learning. One area where this dialogue is particularly promising is around the themes of democracy, citizenship, participation, and development. Examples from both Brazil and India of participatory budgeting, participatory planning, and participatory policy-making clearly demonstrate that democratic participation has {{a positive impact on}} democracy and development – especially when development is understood the way Amartya Sen (1999) has defined it, namely as an extension of capabilities and agency, both at the individual and the collective levels. By comparing examples of democratic participation from India and Brazil, this paper points at the potential for south-south dialogue and argues for a reconceptualization of such core Western ideas as democracy, citizenship, and development by anchoring them in a strong conception of active citizenship and direct democratic participation...|$|E

The USAMGIK, an occupation government, played the decisive role in reviving those Japanese-trained bureaucrats and ruling elites. Land reform was the central policy issue at that time. The KDP endorsed “appropriation by compensation, and distribution with pay”, which contradict the communist land reform policy, “Appropriation without compensation, distribution for nothing”. The KDP opposed the communist policy because it denied the principle of private property. It was the natural response of the KDP because the policy was to protect their members’ and sponsor’ interest. Since then, the KDP made little efforts to solve the national division by <b>North-South</b> <b>dialogue</b> or to seek détente.

40|$|This thesis {{will examine}} how the {{organization}} of creditors and debtors within an ad hoc sovereign debt framework affects the prospect of establishing a formal international mechanism for debt disputes. Since sovereign debtors are not bounded by the same constraints and guarantees as domestic actors, crisis-driven political battles and case-by-case compromises between creditor interests and indebted countries are the ideal building blocks for constructing {{a picture of the}} contemporary debt regime. A review of sovereign debt disputes between the 1970 s and the present day – corresponding to the <b>North-South</b> <b>Dialogue,</b> the Latin American debt crisis of the 1980 s, the International Monetary Fund’s Sovereign Debt Restructuring Mechanism proposal, and Argentina’s 2014 default – indicates that a formal sovereign debt regime is unlikely to arise in the current bond-dominated atmosphere. In particular, the dominance of retail investors and other private bondholders, combined with stagnated or waning influence among public entities such as the IMF and the Paris Club, relegates the concept of a formal, permanent debt arbiter to an aspirational status...|$|E
40|$|The {{difficulties}} Africa {{is going}} through are illustrated in the gap between its growing dependence on international authorities and the continual weakening of the means at its disposal to make it self heard in these bodies. For twenty years, Africa {{was caught up in}} the <b>North-South</b> <b>dialogue.</b> In the 1980 s, the breaking-off of the dialogue and the breaking-up of the Third World deprived it of means for collective action. The distinction between North Africa and Black Africa has grown more pronounced as first the globalization of markets and then the changes in East-West relations caused the latter to fall victim to a process of double marginalization. International organizations consider Subsaharan Africa to be a "welfare case" and reserve special treatment for it, without loosening the external constraints bearing down on its economy. In these conditions, a consensus seems to be developing which holds that multilateral diplomacy is not what's most important for Africa and that the real question is to know how to involve the entire population in the development process. There is thus a return to the overall issue of grass root organizations and essential needs as outlined in the 1970 s...|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, UNCTAD (United Nations Conference of Trade and Development) {{is used as}} a case to {{shed light}} on the {{dynamics}} in the <b>North-South</b> <b>dialogue.</b> UNCTAD was meant to be the institutional arena where the South used Global Conference Diplomacy (GCD) to challenge the status quo in the quest for a New International Economic Order (NIEO). The quest of NIEO through UNCTAD failed conclusively when the outcome was compared to the stated objectives of the grand coalition of the South. Consequently, UNCTAD as an institutional arena and as a device for aggregating and articulating the demands of the South experienced a Fall. The main objective of this thesis is to understand UNCTAD’s development over time and explain the drivers behind the ‘Rise’ and ‘Fall’. The wider aim is to identify drivers that are relevant to other GCD processes where the North-South cleavage appears. Preliminary interviews in Geneva and four months of participative observation in UNCTAD negotiations in 2011 served as a point of departure. I constructed a theoretical model that includes four selected independent variables: Consensual Knowledge, Problem Malignancy, Institutional Capacity and Power. The model also includes three specified criteria to evaluate UNCTAD’s performance as an intergovernmental forum over time. In order to obtain information about these issues, 21 semi-structured elite interviews were conducted with 19 respondents who were diplomats, UNCTAD staff and experts in Norway and Geneva. It became clear that UNCTAD had experienced a rise and fall and was influenced by “the vicious cycle of deprioritization”, ”radicalization of the UN agenda and coalitions”, “agenda sprawling”, “law of the least ambitious program” and finally the “the contamination scare”. It became clear from my analysis that the independent variables correlated, and subsequently three general findings from the analysis were examined: (i) In the GCD processes the leader and the secretariat play a fundamental and pivotal role in creating consensual knowledge between the North and South; (ii) The GCD process is sensitive towards the ‘amplifying effect of the level of participation’ in a competitive institutional landscape; (iii) The GCD process becomes harder when there is asymmetry in the power distribution in the negotiations in UNCTAD (the decision game), coupled with asymmetric power distribution in the world as such (basic game) and when these two games are incongruent. I hope to make a small contribution {{to our understanding of the}} complexity of the dynamics in the <b>North-South</b> <b>Dialogue</b> and shed light on factors that increase the vulnerability for diplomatic gridlocks in the GCD processes...|$|E
40|$|According to {{the concept}} of {{historical}} responsibility, the commitments of individual countries to take action on climate change are distributed based on the relative effects of their past emissions as manifested in present climate change. Brazil presented a comprehensive version of the concept to pre-Kyoto negotiations in 1997. The ‘Brazilian proposal’ originally combined several justice principles; however, following referral to the Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice, discussion soon became confined to technical calculations. This case illustrates how disparities in knowledge production and framing can influence the inclusiveness of negotiations. Southern participation in the policy process was restrained due to lack of scientific expertise on the part of Southern countries and due to the non-inclusive biophysical discourse traditionally preferred by Northern policy-makers. The historical responsibility issue became stranded on problems of how to correctly represent physical nature in climate models. This marginalized the original intention that equity should be the guiding principle of the North–South interaction, arguably undercutting a potential angle of approach to advance the climate change negotiations. The article concludes that in the interest of facilitating the <b>North–South</b> <b>dialogue</b> in climate change negotiations, any framing of historical responsibility that excludes equity needs to be redefined.
