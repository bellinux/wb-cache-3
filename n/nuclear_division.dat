After giving Homer {{a tour of the}} company, Scorpio tells him that his job is to motivate the {{employees}} in the <b>nuclear</b> <b>division.</b> Meanwhile, Bart starts school, but he finds that his new class is far above the standards of Springfield Elementary. When his teacher discovers that Bart cannot read cursive writing, he places him in a remedial class, much to Bart's shock. Lisa goes for a nature walk and discovers that she is allergic to all of the plants around Cypress Creek. Marge tries to go about her daily chores, but the house does everything automatically. This ends up depressing her to the point where Marge starts drinking wine to cope. However, Homer does an excellent job motivating his team in the <b>nuclear</b> <b>division,</b> which makes his family very proud of him.|$|E

5000|$|The {{process of}} schizogony {{is when a}} cell {{undergoes}} multiple <b>nuclear</b> <b>divisions</b> before undergoing cytokinesis or division of the cytoplasm. There is no specific number of <b>nuclear</b> <b>divisions</b> during schizogony. The number of <b>nuclear</b> <b>divisions</b> is species specific and even within a single species the number of <b>nuclear</b> <b>divisions</b> can differ depending on the phase of the life cycle.

5|$|When {{collected}} in deposit, such {{as with a}} spore print, the spores appear white. Viewed with a microscope, the spores are broadly elliptical or roughly spherical, smooth, thin-walled, and have dimensions of 6.5–9.5 by 5.5 by 8.5µm. Spores are amyloid (meaning they take up iodine when stained with Melzer's reagent) The basidia (spore-bearing cells {{on the edges of}} gills) are four-spored and measure 30–50 by 4–11µm. The bases of the basidia have clamp connections—short branches connecting one cell to the previous cell to allow passage of the products of <b>nuclear</b> <b>division.</b> The cap cuticle comprises a layer of densely interwoven, sightly gelatinized, filamentous hyphae that are 3–8µm in diameter.

5|$|The {{majority}} {{of her career}} was spent at Cambridge's Molteno Institute for Parasite Biology, where she returned in 1929. Her work there was an extension of her research with Dobell, as she studied <b>nuclear</b> <b>division</b> in parasitic flagellates and amoebae of diverse species, including both vertebrates and invertebrates. She isolated one type of protozoan, aerotolerant anaerobes, from the digestive tract of Haemopis sanguisuga during this period. Bishop also discovered a new species, Pseudotrichomonas keilini, which she named to acknowledge her colleague David Keilin, {{as well as the}} parasite's resemblance to the genus Trichomonas. Her research at Manchester with H.P. Baynon concerned the identification, isolation, and study of the turkey blackhead parasite (Histomonas meleagridis); this study pioneered a technique for isolating and growing parasites from lesions on the liver. Bishop and Baynon were the first scientists to isolate Histomonas and then prove its role in blackhead. Bishop's expertise with parasitic protozoa translated into her best-known work, a comprehensive study of the malaria parasite (Plasmodium) and potential chemotherapies for the disease.|$|E

40|$|Haploidization of gametes during meiosis {{requires}} a single round of premeiotic DNA replication (meiS) {{followed by two}} successive <b>nuclear</b> <b>divisions.</b> This study demonstrates that ectopic activation of cyclin B/cyclin-dependent kinase in budding yeast recruits up to 30 % of meiotic cells to execute one to three additional rounds of meiS. Rereplication occurs prior to the meiotic <b>nuclear</b> <b>divisions,</b> indicating that this process {{is different from the}} postmeiotic mitoses observed in other fungi. The cells with overreplicated DNA produced asci containing up to 20 spores that were viable and haploid and demonstrated Mendelian marker segregation. Genetic tests indicated that these cells executed the meiosis I reductional division and possessed a spindle checkpoint. Finally, interfering with normal synaptonemal complex formation or recombination increased the efficiency of rereplication. These studies indicate that the block to rereplication is very different in meiotic and mitotic cells and suggest a negative role for the recombination machinery in allowing rereplication. Moreover, the production of haploids, regardless of the genome content, suggests that the cell counts replication cycles, not chromosomes, in determining the number of <b>nuclear</b> <b>divisions</b> to execute...|$|R

50|$|Asexual {{phase in}} adult anuran host. The basic opaline life cycle {{begins with the}} large, multinucleate trophonts in the adult anuran cloaca. Through much of the year, the trophonts grow and divide {{continually}} to yield more trophonts. <b>Nuclear</b> <b>divisions</b> maintain the appropriate number of nuclei during this phase. As the host's breeding season approaches, the trophonts enter a phase known as palintomy -- a series of cell divisions {{with little or no}} overall growth or <b>nuclear</b> <b>divisions.</b> The resulting opalines, which become gradually smaller with fewer nuclei per individual, are called tomonts. At some point the small tomonts undergo encystment, and the cysts are released into the environment (i.e. the breeding pool of the anuran host) along with the feces.|$|R

25|$|C. uncinata {{goes through}} asexual {{reproduction}} for cell division and duplication called amitosis. As C. uncinata has two nuclei, {{it goes through}} two different styles of division of the nuclei. The germ-line nucleus goes through mitosis during asexual division while the somatic nucleus undergoes amitosis. Amitosis is a stochastic process where unlike in mitosis, there is no spindle formation to segregate chromosomes during <b>nuclear</b> <b>division.</b> Instead, the chromosomes within the somatic nucleus are duplicated, and the nucleus goes through binary division.

25|$|Within the {{mosquito}} midgut, the female gamete maturation process entails slight morphological changes, becoming more enlarged and spherical. The male gametocyte undergoes a rapid <b>nuclear</b> <b>division</b> within 15 minutes, producing eight flagellated microgametes {{by a process}} called exflagellation. The flagellated microgamete fertilizes the female macrogamete to produce a diploid cell called a zygote. The zygote then develops into an ookinete. The ookinete is a motile cell, capable of invading other organs of {{the mosquito}}. It traverses the peritrophic membrane of the mosquito midgut and crosses the midgut epithelium. Once through the epithelium, the ookinete enters the basal lamina, and settles to an immotile oocyst. For several days, the oocyst undergoes 10 to 11 rounds of cell division to create a syncytial cell (sporoblast) containing thousands of nuclei. Meiosis takes place inside the sporoblast to produce over 3,000 haploid daughter cells called sporozoites {{on the surface of}} the mother cell. Immature sporozoites break through the oocyst wall into the haemolymph. They migrate to the mosquito salivary glands where they undergo further development and become infective to humans.|$|E
500|$|The hyphae of basidiomycetous fungi are {{partitioned}} by cross-walls called septa, {{and these}} septa have pores that permit {{the passage of}} cytoplasm or protoplasm between adjacent hyphal compartments.

Due to the scarcity of similar data from other Agaricomycotina species, it is unknown whether the extended septal pore cap margins of A.vulgare are phylogenetically informative. [...] Regarding <b>nuclear</b> <b>division,</b> the process of metaphase I of meiosis is similar to the metaphase of mitosis.

40|$|The {{anaphase}} promoting {{complex is}} a highly conserved E 3 ligase complex that mediates the destruction of key regulatory proteins during both mitotic and meiotic divisions. In order to maintain ploidy, this destruction must occur after the regulatory proteins have executed their function. Thus, the regulation of APC/C activity itself is critical for maintaining ploidy during all types of cell divisions. During mitotic cell division, two conserved activator proteins called Cdc 20 and Cdh 1 are required for both APC/C activation and substrate selection. However, significantly less is known about how these proteins regulate APC/C activity during the specialized meiotic <b>nuclear</b> <b>divisions.</b> In addition, both budding yeast and flies utilize a third meiosis-specific activator. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, this meiosis-specific activator is called Ama 1.

Consistent with these findings, genes required for the biogenesis and function of short interfering RNAs and microRNAs, dicer (dcr- 1 in Caenorhabditis elegans) and argonaute homologs, are essential for development in diverse organisms, including C. elegans. We demonstrate that genes required for the function of short RNAs synergize with the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor homolog lin- 35 in negative regulation of the <b>nuclear</b> <b>divisions</b> in the intestine of C. elegans.
