6000|$|But {{can we go}} {{no further}} than that? When one has got so far, {{one is tempted to}} go on a step and inquire whether we cannot go back yet further and bring down the whole to {{modifications}} of one primordial unit. The anatomist cannot do this; but if he call to his aid the study of development, he can do it. For we shall find that, distinct as those plans are, whether it be a porpoise or man, or lobster, or any of those other kinds I have mentioned, every one begins its existence with one and the same primitive form,--that of the egg, consisting, as we have seen, of a <b>nitrogenous</b> <b>substance,</b> having a small particle or nucleus in the centre of it. Furthermore, the earlier changes of each are substantially the same. And it is in this that lies that true [...] "unity of organisation" [...] of the animal kingdom which has been guessed at and fancied for many years; but which it has been left to the present time to be demonstrated by the careful study of development. But is it possible to go another step further still, and to show that in the same way the whole of the organic world is reducible to one primitive condition of form? Is there among the plants the same primitive form of organisation, and is that identical with that of the animal kingdom? The reply to that question, too, is not uncertain or doubtful. It is now proved that every plant begins its existence under the same form; that is to say, in that of a cell--a particle of nitrogenous matter having substantially the same conditions. So that if you trace back the oak to its first germ, or a man, or a horse, or lobster, or oyster, or any other animal you choose to name, you shall find each and all of these commencing their existence in forms essentially similar to each other; and, furthermore, that the first processes of growth, and many of the subsequent modifications, are essentially the same in principle in almost all.|$|E

Out of the total of 247 examined stomachs, 66 were male and 181 female. Sampling of study material was conducted in 2003 – 2010 at three isolated forest sites in South Moravia with different habitat conditions and different type of management (old semi-natural forest with dominance of English Oak (Quercus robur); production forest with dominant Sessile Oak (Quercus petraea) and Black Locust (Robinia pseudoacacia); pheasantry with variable mixture of forest plots). The determined <b>nitrogenous</b> <b>substances</b> content ranged from 9. 5 – 64. 4 % of dry matter.

40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} {{was to examine the}} quality of the lettuce Lactuca sativa L., which was grown with two methods. Hydroponically grown lettuce was {{compared}} with lettuce grown in soil. The purpose of this research was to find out with which method the lettuce would look better and with which method the quality of the lettuce`s nutritiousness would be higher. We ascertained that plants grown with hydroponics did look better and were heavier. About quality results showed that the contents of <b>nitrogenous</b> <b>substances</b> was higher in plants grown with hydroponics, than in plants grown in soil. Results also showed that the contents of vitamin C was higher in plants grown in soil, than grown with hydroponics. With all other measured characteristics, which identify the quality of the produce, the deviations were generally negligible. From all the sorts, sort ‘Dalmatinska ledenka’ had the highest susceptibility for conditions, as it showed the highest variations while grown with different methods. From all the sorts it reached the lowest growth, but had the hardest head, and consequently had a high grade for mildew. It had the lightest rosette from all sorts, was most susceptible for <b>nitrogenous</b> <b>substances</b> in the hydroponics system. The sort ‘Ljubljana ledenka’ had the smallest variations between the different methods, was less susceptible for <b>nitrogenous</b> <b>substances,</b> and had the least vitamin C.

40|$|In earlier {{communications}} {{observations were}} presented indicating the presence in inflammatory exudates of a crystalline <b>nitrogenous</b> <b>substance</b> capable of inducing increased capillary permeability and active migration of leukocytes through the endothelial wall. In {{view of its}} chemotactic properties this substance was named leukotaxine. The accumulated body of evidence suggested that it represented an intermediary product of protein catabolism, belonging probably {{to the group of}} relatively simple polypeptides (1 - 5). The purpose of this short paper is to present further observations in support of this concept. Normal blood serum contains a negligible quantity of leukotaxine. Subjected, however, for a limited interval to the action of proteolytic enzymes, for example trypsin, blood serum becomes turbid doubtless owing to the formation of numerous split products of protein breakdown. Such partially digested blood serum injected into normal skin induces prompt increased capillary permeability as well as marked leukocytic migration.

40|$|There {{is present}} in {{inflammatory}} exudates a factor which induces a prompt increase in the permeability of normal capillaries. Its liberation and presence in exudates offers a reasonable explanation for the mechanism of increased permeability of small vessels in injured tissue. A method for the isolation and purification of this permeability factor has been described. In its essential features, this consists of treating the exudate with pyridine followed by acetone. After separation of the protein fractions further purification {{can be obtained by}} prolonged extraction with butyl alcohol or by subjecting the acetone supernatant fraction to low temperature (– 20 °C.). The latter favors spontaneous separation of the active principle. The purified material is a crystalline doubly refractive <b>nitrogenous</b> <b>substance.</b> The factor is evidently not a protein, yet it contains amino and carboxyl groups. It gives a positive test for the presence of an indole nucleus in its structure (Adamkiewicz test). The active material is dialyzable; and it is precipitated by concentrated ammonium sulfate.

40|$|Objective The aim of {{the study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effects of different nitrate levels (150, 300, 450, and 600 ppm KNO 3) on the volatile compounds and some other properties of pastırma. Methods Pastırma samples were produced under the controlled condition and analyses of volatile compounds, and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) as an indicator of lipid oxidation, non-protein nitrogenous matter content as an indicator of proteolysis, color and residual nitrite were carried out on the final product. The profile of volatile compounds of pastırma samples was analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry using a solid phase microextraction. Results Nitrate level had a significant effect on pH value (p< 0. 05) and a very significant effect on TBARS value (p< 0. 01). No significant differences were determined in terms of aw value, non-protein <b>nitrogenous</b> <b>substance</b> content, color and residual nitrite between pastırma groups produced by using different nitrate levels. Nitrate level had a significant (p< 0. 05) or a very significant (p< 0. 01) effect on some volatile compounds. It was determined that the amounts and counts of volatile compounds were lower in the 450 and especially 600 ppm nitrate levels than 150 and 300 ppm nitrate levels (p< 0. 05). While the use of 600 ppm nitrate did not cause an increase in residual nitrite levels, the use of 150 ppm nitrate did not negatively affect the color of pastırma. However, the levels of volatile compounds decreased with an increasing level of nitrate. Conclusion The use of 600 ppm nitrate is not a risk in terms of residual nitrite in pastırma produced under controlled condition, however, this level is not suitable due to decrease in the amount of volatile compounds...|$|E
