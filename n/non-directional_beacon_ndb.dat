500|$|On board were 130 passengers, of whom 3 were children, {{consisting}} of Arktikugol employees and their families. Waiting {{at the airport}} for the return flight were 120 other employees and their families. The aircraft left Vnukovo Airport at 04:44 Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) or 08:44 Moscow Summer Time. Estimated flight time was 3 hours and 30 minutes, and alternative airports were Murmansk Airport and Severomorsk-3, both in Murmansk Oblast, Russia. The flight proceeded normally until descent, following the routing W 29 from Moscow to Padun (west of Murmansk), before crossing to Bodø Flight Information Region over the Barents Sea cruising at FL 350 at an average airspeed of [...] It then proceeded over Bjørnøya <b>non-directional</b> <b>beacon</b> (<b>NDB),</b> Isfjord NDB and Advent NDB.|$|E
2500|$|Yarmouth Airport {{facilities}} {{include a}} modern airport terminal building and combined services building which houses a maintenance garage. The airport has two runways, two taxiways and separate parking aprons for commercial and general aviation. In {{the summer of}} 2013, its Category I instrument landing system (ILS) was decommissioned, however, GPS (RNAV) approaches exist for all runways, and a VHF omnidirectional range/distance measuring equipment (VOR/DME) and <b>non-directional</b> <b>beacon</b> (<b>NDB)</b> remain active.

This includes VOR beacons, Distance Measuring Equipment (DME), Instrument Landing Systems (ILS), and <b>Non-Directional</b> <b>Beacons</b> (<b>NDB).</b>|$|R
25|$|Radio {{aeronautical}} navigation aids (Navaids) {{use other}} frequencies. <b>Non-directional</b> <b>beacons</b> (<b>NDB)s</b> operate on low frequency and medium frequency bands between 190–415kHz and 510–535kHz. The Instrument landing system (ILS) glide path operates in the UHF frequency range of 329.3–335.0MHz with marker beacons at 75 MHZ. Distance Measuring Equipment (DME) also uses UHF from 962–1150MHz.|$|R
2500|$|The {{flight plan}} {{that had been}} {{approved}} in 1977 by the New Zealand Department of Transport Civil Aviation Division was along a track directly from Cape Hallett to the McMurdo <b>non-directional</b> <b>beacon</b> (<b>NDB),</b> which, coincidentally, entailed flying almost directly over the [...] peak of Mount Erebus. However, the printout from Air New Zealand's ground computer system presented at the 9 November briefing corresponded to a southerly flight path {{down the middle of}} the wide McMurdo Sound, leaving Mount Erebus approximately [...] to the east. The majority of previous flights had also entered this flight plan's coordinates into their aircraft navigational systems and flown the McMurdo Sound route, unaware that the route flown did not correspond with the approved route.|$|E
2500|$|Flight 1903, {{which had}} {{departed}} Manchester at 16:08 local time, encountered {{air traffic control}} (ATC) delays in the Paris area, resulting in a change of route. Radio contact between the pilot flying the aircraft and Barcelona Area Control Centre (ACC) was established at 17:53 local time, following which ACC gave the flightdeck crew clearance to descend from [...] to [...] Six minutes later, the flight was handed over to Barcelona ATC (approach control), and acknowledged that Runway 25 was in use at Barcelona Airport. Approach control cleared the crew to overfly the Sabadell <b>non-directional</b> <b>beacon</b> (<b>NDB)</b> [...] {{to the north of}} Barcelona VOR and descend further to [...] This involved turning left to a heading of approximately 140 degrees to intercept the extended centreline of runway 25 at [...]|$|E
2500|$|The {{doors closed}} at 15:58 and at 16:00 Key {{requested}} pushback. At 16:03 BE 548 was cleared to taxi to the holding point {{adjacent to the}} start of Runway 27 Right. During taxi, at 16:06 the flight received its departure route clearance: a routing known as the [...] "Dover One Standard Instrument Departure". This Standard Instrument Departure involved taking-off to the west over the Instrument Landing System localiser and middle marker beacon of the reciprocal Runway 09 Left, turning left to intercept the 145° bearing to the Epsom <b>Non-Directional</b> <b>Beacon</b> (<b>NDB)</b> (to be passed at [...] or more), and then proceeding to Dover. Key advised the tower that he was ready for take-off and was cleared to do so. He subsequently reported an unspecified technical problem and remained at the holding point for two minutes to resolve it.|$|E
50|$|The {{height of}} antennas differ by usage. For some <b>non-directional</b> <b>beacons</b> (<b>NDBs)</b> the height {{can be as}} low as 10 meters, while for more {{powerful}} navigation transmitters such as DECCA, masts with a height around 100 meters are used. T-antennas have a height between 50 and 200 meters, while mast aerials are usually taller than 150 meters.|$|R
50|$|This {{also led}} to a revival in the {{operation}} of simple radio beacons for use with these RDF systems, now referred to as <b>non-directional</b> <b>beacons</b> (<b>NDB).</b> As the LF/MF signals used by NDBs can follow the curvature of earth, NDB has a much greater range than VOR which travels only in line of sight. NDB can be categorized as long range or short range depending on their power. The frequency band allotted to <b>non-directional</b> <b>beacons</b> is 190-1750 kHz, but the same system can be used with any common AM-band commercial station.|$|R
5000|$|Around 21:15 the {{navigator}} {{stated that}} the distance to Maputo was 60 km. Over the next few minutes, there were several comments from the crew indicating that they believed the navigational aids at Maputo were unavailable: the captain stated that [...] "there is no Maputo" [...] and [...] "electrical power is off, chaps!", while the navigator reported that the Instrument Landing System (ILS) and Distance Measuring Equipment (DME) were switched off and that the <b>non-directional</b> <b>beacons</b> (<b>NDBs)</b> were not working.|$|R
2500|$|Smolensk North Airport is {{a former}} {{military}} airbase, presently in mixed military-civilian use. At {{the time of the}} crash, the airport was not equipped with an ICAO-compliant instrument landing system (ILS), the standard system used in western countries. The airport did have previously a Russian landing system installed, but that was decommissioned after civilian operations started. The Polish Tu-154 was modified to use western-style ILS. A <b>non-directional</b> <b>beacon</b> (<b>NDB)</b> was installed at the airport, but such device is essentially a navigational aid, and can be used only for non-precision approaches, where it can guide the pilot to align with the runway, but offers no vertical guidance on how to descend towards the runway.

50|$|A compass rose, {{sometimes}} called a windrose, or Rose of the Winds, is a figure on a compass, map, nautical chart, or monument used {{to display the}} orientation of the cardinal directions: North, East, South, and West—and their intermediate points. It is also the term for the graduated markings found on the traditional magnetic compass. Today, the idea of a compass rose is found on, or featured in, almost all navigation systems, including nautical charts, <b>non-directional</b> <b>beacons</b> (<b>NDB),</b> VHF omnidirectional range (VOR) systems, global-positioning systems (GPS), and similar equipment.|$|R
50|$|From its {{beginning}} in the early 1930s, the LFR was augmented with Low Frequency <b>Non-directional</b> <b>beacons</b> (<b>NDBs).</b> While the LFR required a complex ground installation and only a simple AM receiver on board the aircraft, NDB ground installations were simple single-antenna transmitters requiring somewhat more complex equipment on board the aircraft. The NDB's radio emission pattern was uniform in all directions in the horizontal plane. The NDB's on-board receiver was called a radio direction finder (RDF). The NDB-RDF combination allowed pilots to determine the direction of the NDB ground station relative to the direction the airplane was pointing. When used in conjunction with the on board magnetic compass, the pilot could navigate to or from the station along any chosen course radiating from the station.|$|R
50|$|There are {{thirteen}} {{instrument approach}} procedures: six {{instrument landing system}} (ILS) approaches, six Global Positioning System approaches (GPS) and one <b>Non-Directional</b> Radio <b>Beacon</b> (<b>NDB)</b> approach. Runways with an ILS are 6L, 24R, 24L and 18; 6L has capabilities for a CAT II and III ILS procedure. GPS approaches are set up on each runway. Runway 6R is the only runway with an NDB approach.|$|R

40|$|Electromagnetic {{exposure}} (occupational {{and general}} public) to 14 types of {{air traffic control}} (ATC) systems is assessed. Measurement methods are proposed for in situ exposure assessment of these ATC systems. In total, 50 sites are investigated at 1, 073 locations in the frequency range of 255 kHz to 24 GHz. For all installations, typical and maximal exposure values for workers {{and the general public}} are provided. Two of the 14 types of systems, <b>Non-Directional</b> <b>Beacons</b> (<b>NDB)</b> (up to 881. 6 V m(- 1)) and Doppler Very High Frequency (VHF) Omni-directional Range (DVOR) (up to 92. 3 V m(- 1)), exhibited levels requiring recommended minimum distances such that the ICNIRP reference levels are not exceeded. Cumulative exposure of all present radiofrequency (RF) sources is investigated, and it is concluded that the ATC source dominates the total exposure in its neighborhood.

5000|$|ADF uses <b>non-{{direction}}al</b> <b>beacons</b> (<b>NDBs)</b> on {{the ground}} to drive a display which shows the direction of the beacon from the aircraft. The pilot may use this bearing to draw a line on the map to show the bearing from the beacon. By using a second beacon, two lines may be drawn to locate the aircraft at the intersection of the lines. This is called a cross-cut. Alternatively, if the track takes the flight directly overhead a beacon, the pilot can use the ADF instrument to maintain heading relative to the beacon, though [...] "following the needle" [...] is bad practice, especially {{in the presence of a}} strong cross wind - the pilots actual track will spiral in towards the beacon, not what was intended. NDBs also can give erroneous readings because they use very long wavelengths, which are easily bent and reflected by ground features and the atmosphere. NDBs continue to be used as a common form of navigation in some countries with relatively few navigational aids.|$|R
50|$|Radio {{transmitters}} for air and sea navigation {{are known}} as beacons and are the radio equivalent to a lighthouse. The transmitter sends a Morse Code transmission on a Long wave (150 - 400 kHz) or Medium wave (520 - 1720 kHz) frequency incorporating the station's identifier {{that is used to}} confirm the station and its operational status. Since these radio signals are broadcast in all directions (omnidirectional) during the day, the signal itself does not include direction information, and these beacons are therefore referred to as <b>non-directional</b> <b>beacons,</b> or <b>NDBs.</b>|$|R
50|$|Among the {{services}} available are a Flight Information Service (FIS), runway lighting (01/19), and a <b>non-directional</b> <b>beacon</b> (<b>NDB)</b> with an approved locator approach to runway 19.|$|E
50|$|There {{are three}} {{non-precision}} instrument approaches available: a Global Positioning System (GPS) approach to runway 33, a <b>non-directional</b> <b>beacon</b> (<b>NDB)</b> approach to runway 21, and a localizer approach to runway 15.|$|E
50|$|Diu Airport's {{main runway}} 05/23 is 5922 ft (1826m) long and 45m wide, {{connected}} to an apron measuring 60 by 90 metres via two taxiways. The airport terminal can accommodate 100 passengers {{each in the}} arrivals and departure halls. A <b>non-directional</b> <b>beacon</b> (<b>NDB)</b> is Diu's sole navigational aid.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>non-directional</b> (radio) <b>beacon</b> (<b>NDB)</b> is a radio {{transmitter}} at a known location, {{used as an}} aviation or marine navigational aid. As the name implies, the signal transmitted does not include [...] directional information, in contrast to other navigational aids such as low frequency radio range, VHF omnidirectional range (VOR) and TACAN. NDB signals follow the curvature of the Earth, {{so they can be}} received at much greater distances at lower altitudes, a major advantage over VOR. However, NDB signals are also affected more by atmospheric conditions, mountainous terrain, coastal refraction and electrical storms, particularly at long range.|$|R
2500|$|Under these stresses, {{the crew}} {{continued}} their approach pattern and readied the aircraft for final descent. Radios were {{tuned to the}} two <b>Non-Directional</b> <b>Beacons</b> (<b>NDBs)</b> present at the field, and the autopilot {{was set up to}} use waypoints from the Flight Management System (FMS) units for navigation. The crew used their second radio to contact the Yak-40 which had landed earlier, inquiring as to the weather conditions. The Yak-40 crew replied, [...] "Well, generally it's absolute shit here," [...] and that, [...] "(we) were lucky to land at the last moment." [...] The Yak-40 crew estimated visibility was , but told PLF 101, [...] "you might try...(to make an approach)." [...] The crew of PLF 101 acknowledged this information and continued their approach. As the aircraft approached the outer marker, the crew issued pitch commands (via the CLIMB-DESCEND wheel) to the autopilot. This is not recommended for the Tu-154, as the autopilot cannot maintain vertical speed accurately enough for the approach phase of flight; manual flight mode is instead recommended. Although the crew had not requested it, the radar controller began issuing reports to PLF 101 concerning their distance from the runway {{and whether or not they}} were on the glidepath. The Polish report noted that on multiple occasions the radar controller stated the airplane was on the glidepath when it was not.|$|R
5000|$|Radio {{direction}} finding, Radio direction finder, or RDF {{was once}} the primary aviation navigational aid. (Range and Direction Finding was the abbreviation {{used to describe the}} predecessor to Radar.) Beacons were used to mark [...] "airways" [...] intersections and to define departure and approach procedures. Since the signal transmitted contains no information about bearing or distance, these beacons are referred to as <b>non-directional</b> <b>beacons,</b> or <b>NDB</b> in the aviation world. Starting in the 1950s, these beacons were generally replaced by the VOR system, in which the bearing to the navigational aid is measured from the signal itself; therefore no specialized antenna with moving parts is required. Due to relatively low purchase, maintenance and calibration cost, NDB's are still used to mark locations of smaller aerodromes and important helicopter landing sites.|$|R
5000|$|Flying Tiger Line Flight 66, on February 19, 1989, a 747-100F {{was flying}} a <b>non-directional</b> <b>beacon</b> (<b>NDB)</b> {{approach}} to Runway 33 at Sultan Abdul Aziz Shah Airport, Kuala Lumpur, when the aircraft hit a hillside 600 ft above sea level, {{resulting in the}} deaths of all four people on board.|$|E

5000|$|During {{the flight}} the crew {{reviewed}} the weather several {{times with the}} air traffic control and finally decided to land at Rabat, using the <b>non-directional</b> <b>beacon</b> (<b>NDB).</b> Air traffic control warned the pilot that the NDB was not aligned with the runway, but this message received no response.The investigation reported an [...] "Error in instrument reading" [...] as probable cause.|$|E
50|$|There are {{a number}} of coast guard and other {{ship-to-shore}} frequencies in use between 1600 and 2850 kHz. These include, as examples, the French MRCC on 1696 kHz and 2677 kHz, Stornoway Coastguard on 1743 kHz, the US Coastguard on 2670 kHz and Madeira on 2843 kHz. RN Northwood in England broadcasts Weather Fax data on 2618.5 kHz. <b>Non-directional</b> navigational radio <b>beacons</b> (<b>NDBs)</b> for maritime and aircraft navigation occupy a band from 190 to 435 kHz, which overlaps from the LF into the bottom part of the MF band.|$|R
5000|$|The {{reason for}} abandoning the {{approach}} is unknown. Since the meteorological conditions were close to the minimum permitted for an IFR approach, the aircraft would need to approach close to the ECHO 1 approach trajectory. On the aircraft's improper approach, the investigation noted {{that there was a}} low probability that the aircraft could have stabilized its approach in order to land safely. With a wet runway and if the aircraft crossed the threshold at the reference speed, the aircraft would have a 385 m safety margin to land on the wet runway. There was a 2 kn tailwind {{at the time of the}} attempted landing. Additionally, a <b>non-directional</b> radio <b>beacon</b> (<b>NDB)</b> just before the runway (RR NBD) was non-functional on the day of the accident. Because the aircraft did not follow the ECHO 1 approach, it did not pass the only NBD available for determining the missed approach point, which was SAT NBD. The report concluded that [...] "the fact that the crew did not follow the profile of the ECHO 1 approach, along with their difficulty stabilizing the aircraft on a final approach, and the tail wind component condition may have contributed to their decision to discontinue the approach." ...|$|R
