5|$|<b>Nine</b> Hours, <b>Nine</b> Persons, <b>Nine</b> Doors was {{originally}} released in Japan by Spike on December 10, 2009, for the Nintendo DS. An American release followed on November 16, 2010. In the United States, {{a replica of}} the in-game bracelets was included with pre-orders at GameStop; due to low pre-orders, Aksys made these available on their website's shop, both separately and bundled with the game. Upon release, <b>Nine</b> Hours, <b>Nine</b> Persons, <b>Nine</b> Doors became the eleventh Nintendo DS game to be rated M by the ESRB. Coinciding with the release of the game's sequel, , <b>Nine</b> Hours, <b>Nine</b> Persons, <b>Nine</b> Doors got a reprint titled Zero Escape: <b>Nine</b> Hours, <b>Nine</b> Persons, <b>Nine</b> Doors, with new box art featuring the Zero Escape brand. The game's soundtrack was published by Super Sweep on December 23, 2009. A novelization of the game, titled Kyokugen Dasshutsu 9 Jikan 9 Nin 9 no Tobira Arutana, was written by Kenji Kuroda and released by Kodansha in two volumes in 2010: Ue and Shita.|$|E
5|$|Virtue's Last Reward was {{developed}} by Chunsoft and directed by Kotaro Uchikoshi, who had previously led the production of <b>Nine</b> Hours, <b>Nine</b> Persons, <b>Nine</b> Doors. While his original intention was to make <b>Nine</b> Hours, <b>Nine</b> Persons, <b>Nine</b> Doors a stand-alone title, its unexpected critical success in North America prompted him to continue the series. In an attempt to reduce costs, Uchikoshi asked Chunsoft if he could develop Virtue's Last Reward and its eventual sequel simultaneously, as both games would use the same engine and digital assets; Chunsoft agreed to his proposal, and green-lit production.|$|E

5|$|An {{analysis}} of the orbits of comets with nearly parabolic orbits identifies five new comets with hyperbolic orbits that approach the nominal orbit of Planet <b>Nine</b> described in Batygin and Brown's initial paper. If these orbits are hyperbolic due to close encounters with Planet <b>Nine</b> the analysis estimates that Planet <b>Nine</b> is currently near aphelion with a right ascension of 83°–90° and a declination of 8°–10°. Scott Sheppard, who is skeptical of this analysis, notes that many different forces influence the orbits of comets.|$|E
5|$|Analyses {{conducted}} contemporarily and independently by Bailey, Batygin and Brown; by Gomes, Deienno and Morbidelli; {{and later}} by Lai suggest that Planet <b>Nine</b> could be responsible for inducing the spin–orbit misalignment of the Solar System. The Sun's axis of rotation is tilted approximately six degrees from the orbital plane of the giant planets. The exact reason for this discrepancy {{remains an open question}} in astronomy. The analysis used computer simulations to show that both the magnitude and direction of tilt {{can be explained by the}} gravitational torques exerted by Planet <b>Nine</b> on the other planets over the lifetime of the Solar System. These observations are consistent with the Planet <b>Nine</b> hypothesis, but do not prove that Planet <b>Nine</b> exists, as there could be some other reason, or more than one reason, for the spin–orbit misalignment of the Solar System.|$|E

5|$|Carlos de la Fuente Marcos and Ralph de la Fuente Marcos have {{calculated}} {{that some of}} the statistically significant commensurabilities are compatible with the Planet <b>Nine</b> hypothesis; in particular, a number of objects may be trapped in the 5:3 and 3:1 mean-motion resonances with a putative Planet <b>Nine</b> with a semimajor axis ∼700 AU.|$|E

5000|$|Similarly, {{percentages}} {{ending in}} a 5 have conventional names, traditionally the number of <b>nines,</b> then [...] "five", so 99.95% is [...] "three <b>nines</b> five", abbreviated 3N5.
