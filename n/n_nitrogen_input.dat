Eutrophication is a global environmental problem. Better management of this threat requires more accurate assessments of anthropogenic <b>nitrogen</b> (<b>N)</b> <b>inputs</b> to coastal systems than can be obtained with traditional measures. Recently, primary producer N isotopic signatures have emerged as useful proxy of such inputs.

Spatial availability of sewage N across a bay with one major sewage outflow predicted by eelgrass δ 15 N was high near and downstream of the outflow compared to upstream, but returned to upstream levels within 4 km downstream from the outfall.

The rate-limiting step of nitrification, the oxidation of ammonia to nitrite, is performed by ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and bacteria (AOB) (Juretschko et al. 1998; Francis et al. 2005). Although both AOA and AOB can be detected {{in a wide range of}} aquatic habitats, their abundance varies widely (He et al. 2007).

40|$|Quantifying the {{environmental}} impact of production systems has become a milestone for agricultural commodity chains. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is a unique ISO standardized methodology for estimating {{the environmental}} impact of human activities along a commodity chain. In the last decade, LCA has become the worldwide standard for environmental product declarations and the baseline model behind various GHG calculators and certifications (e. g. European Directive 2009; RSPO PalmGHG 2012). Various LCA on palm oil products have shown that the agricultural stage is a major contributor to most of the potential environmental impacts, including global warming, eutrophication and acidification for instance. This large contribution is due to combined important <b>nitrogen</b> (<b>N)</b> <b>input</b> levels in the field and low input levels at the mill and refinery stages. The agricultural stage remains a critical contributor even when the system boundary is extended to palm-based biofuel production. Focusing on global warming impact, main contributors are N-related GHG emissions in the plantation and methane emissions from palm oil mill effluent treatment. The impact from the plantation becomes overwhelming when forests or peatland areas are converted to palm plantations. Meanwhile, impact from palm oil mill effluent can be drastically reduced if the biogas is captured with electricity recovery. While <b>nitrogen</b> <b>inputs</b> are critical, LCA models still mostly rely on global emission factor.

40|$|This {{study was}} based on a {{long-term}} field trials of three different vegetable cropping systems (organic, low-input and conventional) in greenhouse which was initiated in 2002 at Quzhou Experimental Station of China Agricultural University, Hebei Province. The apparent nitrogen budget which equals to <b>N</b> <b>input</b> (<b>nitrogen</b> of fertilizer, transplants and irrigation) minus <b>N</b> output (<b>nitrogen</b> of the eggplants) was compared to provide the reference for the development of high yield and sustainable cropping system. The main conclusions were as follows: The total <b>input</b> of <b>nitrogen</b> in the organic, low-input and conventional systems was 1 150 kg·hm 2, 1 182 kg·hm 2 and 1 433 kg·hm 2, respectively. The total nitrogen uptake by plants was 178 kg·hm 2, 135 kg·hm 2, 116 kg·hm 2, respectively. The eggplant production was 93 458 kg·hm 2, 93 320 kg·hm 2, 90 209 kg·hm 2 respectively. And the net nitrogen surplus was 971 kg·hm 2, 1 046 kg·hm 2 and 1 317 kg·hm 2, respectively. The eggplant production in organic system was 0. 1 % higher than the low-input system and 3. 6 % higher than the conventional system. The net nitrogen surplus in organic system was 7. 2 % and 26. 3 % lower than low-input system and conventional system, respectively. These data showed that organic system tends to be higher yields and lower net nitrogen surplus leading to higher nitrogen use efficiency when compared with the low-input and conventional systems...|$|R
