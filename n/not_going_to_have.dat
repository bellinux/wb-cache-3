He had been specifically told that his colour would not be an issue at the hotel.

When Arnold Watson, a colleague of Constantine at the Ministry of Labour, arrived and attempted to intervene, he was told by the manager: [...] "We are <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> these niggers in our hotel," [...] and that his presence might offend American guests. Watson argued, to no avail, that not only was Constantine a British subject, he worked for the government. Eventually Watson persuaded Constantine to leave and stay at another hotel which, owned by the same company as the Imperial, proved to be welcoming.

The final step was for the voters to post the interactions on YouTube. The Dodd campaign has used the internet more frequently than other campaigns, often airing staff meetings via the web.

[...] There were, however, various religious and Conservative criticisms of the Charter during its drafting, with fears that denominational schools and Canada's abortion law were threatened. [...] At this time as well, religious groups in Canada such as 100 Huntley Street and the Evangelical Fellowship of Canada were growing and wanted God acknowledged in the Constitution. [...] Despite the Liberal Party of Canada's protests that a better preamble could be written after patriation was achieved, and thus there was no need for the preamble being proposed at the time by the Conservatives, religious groups increased their activism.
