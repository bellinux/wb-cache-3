In a democratic country, each law-document is published as open media content, is in principle a free content; but in general there are no explicit license attributed for each law-document, so the license must be interpreted, is a implied license.Only few countries have explicit licenses in its law-documents, as the UK's Open Government Licence (a CC-BY compatible license).In the other countries, the implied license comes from its proper rules (general laws and rules about copyright in government works). The automatic protection provided by Berne Convention not apply to law-documents: Article 2.4 excludes the official texts from the automatic protection.It is also possible to [...] "inherit" [...] the license from context. The set of country's law-documents is made available through national repositories. Examples of law-document open repositories: LexML Brazil, Legislation.gov.uk, <b>N-Lex</b> of EU countries. In general a law-document is offered {{in more than one}} (open) official version, but the main one is that published by a government gazette. So, law-documents can eventually inherit license expressed by the repository or by the gazette that contains it.|$|E

It is {{the concern}} of the author to arrange cogitations and {{experiences}} she gained by collaborating in relevant international project works, by conducting scientific studies regarding legal knowledge representation and by teaching legal information retrieval. The main focus is the demonstration of problems of communication within and between humans and legal information systems, which are often hidden, overlooked or ignored. The author uses the concept "semantic spaces " to describe and explain semantic related difficulties detected in legal knowledge bases and data retrieval. Realization of these various semantic spaces might help further work in this area. Emphasis is also placed {{on the problem of}} multilingualism and diversity of legal cultures in EU legislation. The practical examples of the EU tools <b>N-Lex</b> and EUROVOC are used to illustrate the various situations, the current limits and the specific requirements and information needs in multilingual and cross-national legal information retrieval...|$|E
