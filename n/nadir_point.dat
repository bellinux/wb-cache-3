Within the cardiology field, Atkov {{has been a part}} of 15 major projects that has helped advance the types of technology in cardiology research. He also holds several patents for inventions he produced or helped develop. One of his major inventions was a device for positioning a cardiograph sensor. This invention had seven other cardiology specialist involved. The main objective was to create something that could hold and maneuver an Echocardiograph and an Electrocardiograph at the same time while not being in the way of physicians. This device has paved the way towards greater and more advanced technology for better ultrasound techniques. Another notable invention was the Photogrammetrical plotting projector apparatus for radial <b>nadir</b> <b>point</b> triangulation. This invention was to make sure that a Photogrammetrical plotting projector could take what images it needs at the correct angles and explore new angles that images could be taken from.

By this slow motion, the {{telescope was}} adjusted until the star moved along the horizontal wire (or if there were two, in the middle between them), from {{the east side of}} the field of view to the west. Following this, the circles were read by the microscopes for a measurement of the apparent altitude of the star.

In addition, this torque, coupled with the spacecraft gyro-dynamics and orbit rate, results in a natural alignment of the momentum wheel bias vector with the orbit plane normal. From this known orientation, returning to <b>nadir</b> <b>pointing</b> is simple, requiring only a 90 ° rotation around the pitch axis.

40|$|<b>Nadir</b> <b>point</b> {{plays an}} {{important}} role in multi-objective optimization because of its importance in estimating the range of objective values corresponding to desired Pareto-optimal solutions and also in using many classical interactive optimization techniques. Since this point corresponds to the worst Pareto-optimal solution of each objective, the task of estimating the <b>nadir</b> <b>point</b> necessitates information about the whole Pareto optimal frontier and is reported to be a dicult task using classical means. In this paper, for the rst time, we have proposed a couple of modi cations to an existing evolutionary multi-objective optimization procedure to focus its search towards the extreme objective values front-wise.

40|$|GOES-R series {{spacecraft}} {{feature a}} number of flexible appendages with modal frequencies below 3. 0 Hz which, if excited by spacecraft disturbances, can be sources of undesirable jitter perturbing spacecraft pointing. In order to meet GOES-R pointing stability requirements, the spacecraft flight software implements an Active Vibration Damping (AVD) rate control law which acts in parallel with the <b>nadir</b> <b>point</b> attitude control law. The AVD controller commands spacecraft reaction wheel actuators based upon Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) inputs to provide additional damping for spacecraft structural modes below 3. 0 Hz which vary with solar wing angle. A GOES-R spacecraft dynamics and attitude control system identified model is constructed from pseudo-random reaction wheel torque commands and IMU angular rate response measurements occurring over a single orbit during spacecraft post-deployment activities. The identified Fourier model is computed on the ground, uplinked to the spacecraft flight computer, and the AVD controller filter coefficients are periodically computed on-board from the Fourier model. Consequently, the AVD controller formulation is based not upon pre-launch simulation model estimates but upon on-orbit <b>nadir</b> <b>point</b> attitude control and time-varying spacecraft dynamics. GOES-R high-fidelity time domain simulation results herein demonstrate {{the accuracy of the}} AVD identified Fourier model relative to the pre-launch spacecraft dynamics and control truth model. The AVD controller on-board the GOES- 16 spacecraft achieves more than a ten-fold increase in structural mode damping of the fundamental solar wing mode while maintaining controller stability margins and ensuring that the <b>nadir</b> <b>point</b> attitude control bandwidth does not fall below 0. 02 Hz. On-orbit GOES- 16 spacecraft appendage modal frequencies and damping ratios are quantified based upon the AVD system identification, and the increase in modal damping provided by the AVD controller for each structural mode is presented.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a new method called ND-Tree-based update (or shortly ND-Tree) for the dynamic non-dominance problem, i. e. the problem of online update of a Pareto archive {{composed}} of mutually non-dominated points. It uses a new ND-Tree data structure in which each node represents a subset of points contained in a hyperrectangle defined by its local approximate ideal and <b>nadir</b> <b>points.</b> By building subsets containing points located close in the objective space and using basic properties of the local ideal and <b>nadir</b> <b>points</b> we can efficiently avoid searching many branches in the tree. ND-Tree may be used in multiobjective evolutionary algorithms and other multiobjective metaheuristics to update an archive of potentially non-dominated points. We prove that the proposed algorithm has sub-linear time complexity under mild assumptions. We experimentally compare ND-Tree to the simple list, Quad-tree, and M-Front methods using artificial and realistic benchmarks with up to 10 objectives and show that with this new method substantial reduction of the number of point comparisons and computational time can be obtained. Furthermore, we apply the method to the non-dominated sorting problem showing that it is highly competitive to some recently proposed algorithms dedicated to this problem.

30|$|Various {{approaches}} to the improvement of MOEA/D have also been proposed in the literature (for detail, see a review [22]).

Other important issues include solution–subproblem matching [17, 18] and resource allocation to subproblems [28]. Whereas the normalization of the objective space is also important, this issue has not been actively studied in the literature [4]. One exception is Bhattacharjee et al.

Conversely, a similar scalarizing function can push out from the <b>nadir</b> <b>point</b> toward a specified aspiration point.
