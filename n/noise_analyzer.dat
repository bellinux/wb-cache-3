50|$|A {{number of}} studies have elucidated cases of the {{insufficiency}} of the linear noise approximation in biological contexts by comparison of its predictions with those of stochastic simulations. This has led to the investigation of higher order terms of the system size expansion that go beyond the linear approximation. These terms have been used to obtain more accurate moment estimates for the mean concentrations and for the variances of the concentration fluctuations in intracellular pathways. In particular, the leading order corrections to the linear noise approximation yield corrections of the conventional rate equations. Terms of higher order have also been used to obtain corrections to the variances and covariances estimates of the linear noise approximation. The linear noise approximation and corrections to it can be computed using the open source software intrinsic <b>Noise</b> <b>Analyzer.</b> The corrections {{have been shown to be}} particularly considerable for allosteric and non-allosteric enzyme-mediated reactions in intracellular compartments.|$|E

40|$|The linear noise {{approximation}} {{is commonly}} used to obtain intrinsic noise statistics for biochemical networks. These estimates are accurate for networks {{with large numbers of}} molecules. However {{it is well known that}} many biochemical networks are characterized by at least one species with a small number of molecules. We here describe version 0. 3 of the software intrinsic <b>Noise</b> <b>Analyzer</b> (iNA) which allows for accurate computation of noise statistics over wide ranges of molecule numbers. This is achieved by calculating the next order corrections to the linear noise approximation's estimates of variance and covariance of concentration fluctuations. The efficiency of the methods is significantly improved by automated just-in-time compilation using the LLVM framework leading to a fluctuation analysis which typically outperforms that obtained by means of exact stochastic simulations. iNA is hence particularly well suited for the needs of the computational biology community.

40|$|Random {{telegraph}} signal (RTS) noise has shown an increased impact on circuit performance at advanced complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor technologies. However, {{there is not}} yet a computer-aided design tool available to analyze such noise based on the statistical distribution of traps. In this paper, a new methodology is proposed to enable integrated circuit designers to analyze their circuits in the presence of RTS noise, thus providing an opportunity to mitigate the noise effect by design. Using a 3 -D atomistic simulator, compact models that could accurately describe the device structure, doping profile, and statistically representative distribution of traps were extracted for SPICE simulation. Carrier trapping/detrapping was represented by a pair of compact models at different threshold voltages, hence defining the amplitude of RTS noise. The timing parameters of RTS noise were predicted based on the Shockley-Read-Hall statistics. Simulation results reveals that, while RTS noise from a single device may have little impact (Delta I-out &# 60;= 0. 0842 mu A) on our test circuit performance, the cumulative effect from all devices (n = 30) in this relatively small circuit can be significant (Delta I-out &# 62;= 0. 5766 mu A). This reinforces the need for an RTS <b>noise</b> <b>analyzer</b> for deep-sub-micrometer circuit design...|$|E
40|$|Background: The linear noise {{approximation}} (LNA) {{is commonly}} used to predict how noise is regulated and exploited at the cellular level. These predictions are exact for reaction networks composed exclusively of first order reactions or for networks involving bimolecular reactions and large numbers of molecules. It is however well known that gene regulation involves bimolecular interactions with molecule numbers {{as small as a}} single copy of a particular gene. It is therefore questionable how reliable are the LNA predictions for these systems. Results: We implement in the software package intrinsic <b>Noise</b> <b>Analyzer</b> (iNA), a system size expansion based method which calculates the mean concentrations and the variances of the fluctuations to an order of accuracy higher than the LNA. We then use iNA to explore the parametric dependence of the Fano factors and of the coefficients of variation of the mRNA and protein fluctuations in models of genetic networks involving nonlinear protein degradation, post-transcriptional, post-translational and negative feedback regulation. We find that the LNA can significantly underestimate the amplitude and period of noise-induced oscillations in genetic oscillators. We also identify cases where the LNA predicts that noise levels can be optimized by tuning a bimolecular rate constant whereas our method shows that no such regulation is possible. All our results are confirmed by stochastic simulations...|$|E

Alternatively, it can be measured by analyzing the spectrum of the photodetected signal using an electrical spectrum <b>analyzer.</b> <b>Noise</b> observed in the electrical domain is proportional to electric current squared and hence to optical power squared. Therefore, RIN is usually presented as relative fluctuation in {{the square of the}} optical power in decibels per hertz over the RIN bandwidth and at one or several optical intensities.

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} a photonic-assisted wideband phase <b>noise</b> <b>analyzer</b> based on optoelectronic hybrid units comprising a microwave photonic phase shifter (MPS) and a microwave truetime delayer. The MPS and the microwave true time delayer are achieved by a dual-drive Mach-Zehnder modulator (DMZM) incorporating with a broadband microwave frequency up-convertor(MFC) and an optical fiber delay line (ODL), respectively. Our scheme, which {{is analogous to}} the conventional microwave delayed homodyne self-reference method, can effectively improve its accuracy using longer time delay with minimum power consumption. In the scheme, themicrowave signal is up-converted using the MFC and then down-converted using optical mixing in a photo-detector (PD). Meanwhile, the microwave signal is phase shifted using the MPS and time delayed using the ODL and are finally homodyne mixed with reference signals for converting phase fluctuations to voltage fluctuations. The motivation of this work {{lies in the fact that}} the previously reported phase noise measurement configurations based on photonic techniques are hard to accurately measure phase noise of microwave oscillators working at low frequencies. The microwave signals are phase tuned over 360 ° at frequency range of 0. 5 – 9 GHz to achieve a photonic-assisted phase detector.

40|$|The {{accepted}} stochastic {{descriptions of}} biochemical dynamics under well-mixed conditions are {{given by the}} Chemical Master Equation and the Stochastic Simulation Algorithm, which are equivalent. The latter is a Monte-Carlo method, which, despite enjoying broad availability in {{a large number of}} existing software packages, is computationally expensive due to the huge amounts of ensemble averaging required for obtaining accurate statistical information. The former is a set of coupled differential-difference equations for the probability of the system being in any one of the possible mesoscopic states; these equations are typically computationally intractable because of the inherently large state space. Here we introduce the software package intrinsic <b>Noise</b> <b>Analyzer</b> (iNA), which allows for systematic analysis of stochastic biochemical kinetics by means of van Kampen’s system size expansion of the Chemical Master Equation. iNA is platform independent and supports the popular SBML format natively. The present implementation is the first to adopt a complementary approach that combines state-of-the-art analysis tools using the computer algebra system Ginac with traditional methods of stochastic simulation. iNA integrates two approximation methods based on the system size expansion, the Linear Noise Approximation and effective mesoscopic rate equations, which to-date have not been available to non-expert users, into an easy-to-use graphical user interface. In particular, the present methods allow for quick approximate analysis of time-dependent mean concentrations, variances, covariances and correlations coefficients, which typically outperform...|$|E

We have shown that the parametric dependence of the coefficients of variation and Fano factors for common gene regulatory networks is better described by including terms of higher order than LNA in the system size expansion. This analysis is considerably faster than stochastic simulations due to the extensive ensemble averaging needed to obtain statistically meaningful results. Hence iNA is well suited for performing computationally efficient and quantitative studies of intrinsic noise in gene regulatory networks...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Spectrum sensing for {{cognitive}} radio requires a high linearity to handle strong signals, {{and at the}} same time a low noise figure (NF) to enable detection of much weaker signals. Often there is a trade-off between linearity and noise: improving one of them degrades the other. Cross-correlation can break this trade-off by reducing noise at the cost of measurement time. An existing RF front-end in CMOS-technology with IIP 3 =+ 11 dBm and NF< 6. 5 dB is duplicated and attenuators are put in front to increase linearity (IIP 3 =+ 24 dBm). The attenuation degrades NF, but by using cross-correlation of the outputs of the two front-ends, the NF is reduced to below 4 dB. In total this results in a spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR) of 89 dB in 1 MHz resolution bandwidth (RBW).

40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} {{a series}} of experimental studies that investigate the coherence properties of a superconducting persistent-current or flux qubit, a promising candidate for developing a scalable quantum processor. A collection of coherence characterization experiments and techniques that originate {{from the field of}} nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) are implemented. In particular, one type of dynamical decoupling techniques that uses refocusing pulses to recover coherence is successfully realized for the first time. This technique is further utilized as a <b>noise</b> spectrum <b>analyzer</b> in the megahertz range, by which a 1 /f-type dependence is observed for the flux noise. Then, a novel method of performing low-frequency noise spectroscopy is developed and successfully implemented. New techniques used in the readout scheme and data processing result in an improved spectral range and signal visibility over conventional methods. The observed power law dependence below kilohertz agrees with separate measurements at higher frequencies. Also, the noise is found to be temperature independent. Finally, a robust noise spectroscopy method is presented, where the spin-locking technique is employed to extract noise information by measuring the driven-evolution longitudinal relaxation. This technique shows improved accuracy over other methods, due to its insensitivity to low-frequency noise. Spectral signatures of coherent fluctuators are resolved, and further confirmed in a time-domain spin-echo experiment. by Fei Yan. Thesis (Ph. D.)

50|$|The {{measurement}} of 1/f noise spectrum in voltage or current {{is done in}} the same way as the {{measurement of}} other types of <b>noises.</b> Sampling spectrum <b>analyzers</b> take a finite-time sample from the noise and calculate the Fourier transform by FFT algorithm. Then, after calculating the squared absolute value of the Fourier spectrum, they calculate its average value by repeating this sampling process by a sufficiently large number of times. The resulting pattern is proportional to the power-density spectrum of the measured noise. It is then normalized by the duration of the finite-time sample and also by a numerical constant in the order of 1 to get its exact value. This procedure gives correct spectral data only deeply within the frequency window determined by the reciprocal of the duration of the finite-time sample (low-frequency end) and the digital sampling rate of the noise (high-frequency end). Thus the upper and the lower half decades of the obtained power density spectrum are usually discarded from the spectrum. Conventional spectrum analyzers that sweep a narrow filtered band over the signal have good signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), since they are narrow-band instruments. Unfortunately, these instruments do not operate at frequencies low enough to fully measure flicker noise. Sampling instruments are broadband, and hence high noise. They reduce the noise by taking multiple sample traces and averaging them. Conventional spectrum analyzers still have better SNR due to their narrow-band acquisition.|$|R

A dry chemiluminescence fast-response O- 3 analyzer and a UV-absorption based slow-response O- 3 analyzer {{were used for}} measuring fast O- 3 concentration fluctuations and absolute concentrations, respectively. The main objective {{of this study was}} to determine a group of suitable methods for calculating F-o based on the performance of the two O- 3 analyzers in the field. We evaluated the effects of three calibration methods on F-o. These calibration methods include the ratio method (RM, it assumes that the fast-response analyzer's signal-output is directly proportional to absolute ambient O- 3 concentration within a 30 -min interval), the ratio offset method (ROM, it is based on the ratio method with analyzer's offset modification), and the ratio variation method (RVM, it is based on the ratio method with the fast-response analyzer's gain factor variation within a 30 -min interval). Three frequency response corrections (analytic, revised analytic, and in-situ) for the estimation of F-o were also evaluated. Our results show that: (1) Compared to the O- 3 flux with the commonly-used method (RM), on average, the fluxes with ROM and RVM were decreased by about 9 % and 7 %, respectively. (2) Based on the spectral analysis, the fast-response 03 <b>analyzer's</b> <b>noise</b> could cause random errors, but did not result in a systematic error in F-o. Tubing attenuation in O- 3 concentration fluctuations can cause up to 20 % loss in F-o.
