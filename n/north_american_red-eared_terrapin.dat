It includes numerous land mammals and birds, three species of Australian Litoria tree frogs, the Australian rainbow skink (Lampropholis delicata) and the <b>North</b> <b>American</b> <b>red-eared</b> slider turtle (Trachemys scripta elegans). The only species on this list that occur naturally in New Zealand are the southern black-backed gull and the spur-winged plover (masked lapwing), both of which present a significant risk of bird strike.|$|R

40|$|One {{invasive}} species, the <b>Red-eared</b> <b>terrapin</b> Trachemys scripta elegans, {{was legally}} traded in Poland until mid 2002. Following the ban, {{work was done}} {{on the extent of}} trade in <b>red-eared</b> <b>terrapins</b> in pet shops in SE Poland in the year 2005 and 2007. Despite the trade ban, it was not fully eliminated from the market and was still available in 20. 5 % and 7. 3 % of the monitored stores in the 2005 and 2007 respectively. <b>Red-eared</b> <b>terrapins</b> comprised 43. 4 % and 14. 8 % of the number of all water turtles available for sale in the indicated years. On the market, the substitute for the <b>Red-eared</b> <b>terrapin</b> has presently become Troost’s terrapin Trachemys scripta troostii, since other turtles are too expensive. Troost’s terrapin may also pose a threat for the native European pond turtle Emys orbicularis...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In Poland, {{just like}} in many other countries, selling <b>Red-eared</b> <b>terrapins</b> Trachemys scripta elegans as {{invasive}} has been prohibited, {{but there are other}} subspecies of Trachemys scripta on the pet market, constituting a threat to the native Pond turtle Emys orbicularis. I provide data on the structure of local trade in turtles in eastern Poland and the factors driving it after the introduction of a ban on trade in <b>Red-eared</b> <b>terrapins.</b> I also point out the role of Cumberland sliders Trachemys scripta troostii in replacing the banned subspecies. The dominant role of Cumberland sliders on the market resulted in cases of their unlawful introduction into the environment and the appearance of free-living individuals in Poland. The conclusions of the study point to the significance of economic mechanisms in preventing the dispersal of invasive species...|$|R

50|$|The red-eared slider (Trachemys scripta elegans), {{also known}} as the <b>red-eared</b> <b>terrapin,</b> is a semiaquatic turtle {{belonging}} to the family Emydidae. It is a subspecies of the pond slider. It is the most popular pet turtle in the United States and is also popular as a pet {{in the rest of the}} world. It has, therefore, become the most commonly traded turtle in the world. It is native to the southern United States and northern Mexico, but has become established in other places because of pet releases, and has become an invasive species in many areas, where it outcompetes native species. The red-eared slider is included in the list of the world's 100 most invasive species published by the IUCN.|$|R
5000|$|South Korean {{researchers}} have remotely controlled {{the movements of}} a turtle using a completely non-invasive steering system. <b>Red-eared</b> <b>terrapins</b> (Trachemys scripta elegans) were made to follow a specific path by manipulating the turtles' natural obstacle avoidance behaviour. If these turtles detect something is blocking their path in one direction, they move to avoid it. The researchers attached a black half cylinder to the turtle. The [...] "visor" [...] was positioned around the turtle's rear end, but was pivoted around using a microcontroller and a servo motor to either {{the left or right}} to partially block the turtle's vision on one side. This made the turtle believe there was an obstacle it needed to avoid on that side and thereby encouraged the turtle to move in the other direction.|$|R
50|$|It is {{increasingly}} recognized that animal release {{has the potential}} for negative environmental impacts, including as a pathway for the introduction of invasive species into non-native environments. This may lead to biodiversity loss over time. For example, competition from <b>American</b> <b>Red-eared</b> slider turtles released in China's lakes has been reported to cause death of native turtles.|$|R
