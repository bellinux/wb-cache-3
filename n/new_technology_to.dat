Bridges across the Golden Horn were constructed during this period, and Istanbul was connected to the rest of the European railway network in the 1880s. Modern facilities, such as a water supply network, electricity, telephones, and trams, were gradually introduced to Istanbul over the following decades, although later than to other European cities. The modernization efforts were not enough to forestall the decline of the Ottoman Empire.|$|E

5|$|Bird, who was Pixar's first outside director, {{developed}} {{the film as}} an extension of 1960s comic books and spy films from his boyhood and personal family life. He pitched the film to Pixar after the box office disappointment of his first feature, The Iron Giant (1999), and carried over much of its staff to develop The Incredibles. The animation team was tasked with animating an all-human cast, which required creating <b>new</b> <b>technology</b> <b>to</b> animate detailed human anatomy, clothing and realistic skin and hair. Michael Giacchino composed the film's orchestral score.|$|E
5|$|In 1338 Southampton was raided by French forces; the town's defences proved inadequate, {{particularly}} {{along the}} quays {{on the west}} {{and south of the}} city. Edward III ordered some immediate improvements to Southampton's town walls {{but it was not until}} the 1360s that substantial work began. Over the coming decades the town was entirely enclosed by a 2km (1.25-mile) long stone wall, with 29 towers and eight gates. With the advent of gunpowder weapons in the 1360s and 1370s, Southampton was one of the first towns in England to install the <b>new</b> <b>technology</b> <b>to</b> existing fortifications and to build new towers specifically to house cannon.|$|E

5|$|The {{origins of}} the workhouse {{can be traced to}} the Poor Law Act of 1388, which {{attempted}} to address the labour shortages following the Black Death in England by restricting the movement of labourers, and ultimately led to the state becoming responsible for the support of the poor. But mass unemployment following the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815, the introduction of <b>new</b> <b>technology</b> <b>to</b> replace agricultural workers in particular, and a series of bad harvests, meant that by the early 1830s the established system of poor relief was proving to be unsustainable. The New Poor Law of 1834 attempted to reverse the economic trend by discouraging the provision of relief to anyone who refused to enter a workhouse. Some Poor Law authorities hoped to run workhouses at a profit by utilising the free labour of their inmates, who generally lacked the skills or motivation to compete in the open market. Most were employed on tasks such as breaking stones, crushing bones to produce fertiliser, or picking oakum using a large metal nail known as a spike, perhaps the origin of the workhouse's nickname.|$|E
5|$|During {{its initial}} development, Versus XIII used Crystal Tools, a {{proprietary}} game engine created by Square Enix for seventh-generation gaming hardware {{that would be}} used throughout the company for multiple games, including XIII and Final Fantasy XIV. Later, Tabata described the Crystal Tools hardware {{as an extension of the}} technology of the previous gaming generation. During 2010, Nomura revealed that the team were using read world-based physical calculations to determine weather and cloud behavior in-game. By 2011, Nomura announced that the game was no longer using Crystal Tools, and instead used a specially designed proprietary gameplay engine combined by lighting technology from Luminous Studio, an engine built for eighth-generation gaming hardware. The focus on realism influenced the decision to incorporate the more advanced lighting technology, while the specially designed engine had a limited area of use. The planned scale of the open world increased so much that the older technology eventually became obsolete as it was restricting the developers. The need to create <b>new</b> <b>technology</b> <b>to</b> cope with these problems further added to initial development difficulties. The original plan was to have interactive real-time event scenes. Nomura felt that regular storytelling cutscenes in other games interrupted gameplay and caused players to skip them. Furthermore, the development frame could theoretically be shortened as there was no need to create cutscenes-exclusive high-polygon character models. However, seamless transitions of these events into the gameplay were hard to achieve and instead increased the time that had to be invested by the team. After the full shift onto eighth-generation platforms, multiple planned elements were influenced by the new Luminous technology: the in-game cutscene camera was optimized to work similarly to the one used in pre-rendered movies, and more environmental and gameplay elements could be included such as an increased number of destructible environments and the player character's warping to faraway spots on the game maps. It also enabled Nomura to start experimenting with higher facial detail for enemies such as behemoths.|$|E

5|$|For the {{technical}} crew members, the film's human characters posed a difficult set of challenges. Bird's story {{was filled with}} elements that were difficult to animate with CGI back then. Humans are widely {{considered to be the}} most difficult things to execute in animation. Pixar's animators filmed themselves walking to better grasp proper human motion. Creating an all-human cast required creating <b>new</b> <b>technology</b> <b>to</b> animate detailed human anatomy, clothing, and realistic skin and hair. Although {{the technical}} team had some experience with hair and cloth in Monsters, Inc. (2001), the amount of hair and cloth required for The Incredibles had never been done by Pixar until this point. Moreover, Bird would tolerate no compromises for the sake of technical simplicity. Where the technical team on Monsters, Inc. had persuaded director Pete Docter to accept pigtails on Boo to make her hair easier to animate, the character of Violet had to have long hair that obscured her face; it was integral to her character. Violet's long hair, which was extremely difficult to animate, was only successfully animated toward the end of production. In addition, animators had to adapt to having hair underwater and blowing through the wind. Disney was initially reluctant to make the film because of these issues, feeling a live-action film would be preferable, though Lasseter vetoed this.|$|E
5|$|Tomb Raider: Underworld {{continued}} the plot line established in Legend. Crystal Dynamics used <b>new</b> <b>technology</b> <b>to</b> improve the character for seventh generation consoles, focusing on improving realism. The dirt accumulation and water cleansing mechanic from Legend was altered to be a real-time mechanic that can involve the entire game environment. To achieve {{a more natural}} appearance, the developers added spherical harmonics to provide indirect lighting to in-game objects like Lara Croft. Crystal Dynamics made the character model more complex and detailed than previous instalments, featuring more texture layers that determine the appearance of shadows and reflective light on it, and using skeletal animation to portray believable movement. The number of polygons in the model increased to 32,000. The developers enhanced Croft's facial model by {{increasing the number of}} polygons, bones used in the animation skeleton, and graphical shaders in the face to add more detail and expressive capabilities. The hair was created as a real-time cloth simulation to further add realism to its shape and movement. The developers kept Croft's hair tied back because they felt a real person would not want it flying around while performing dangerous manoeuvres. The character's body size was increased and breast size reduced to portray more realistic proportions.|$|E
5|$|Zito {{wanted to}} put {{together}} some demos to present the technology to Hasbro. Riley wanted {{to create an environment}} the player could move freely about, leading to the idea of surveillance cameras. Fulop and Riley were inspired by the play Tamara (1981) which ran parallel stories running in 13 different rooms. The audience would need to decide for themselves which stories they wanted to follow. Fulop and Riley watched the play three times {{over the course of a}} weekend in 1985. Fulop and Riley liked the design model and thought it would make a good basis for an interactive media experience. A prototype game titled Scene of the Crime was produced to demonstrate the <b>new</b> <b>technology</b> <b>to</b> Hasbro and test the surveillance camera gameplay. It was a short five-minute demo where the player follows suspicious characters around a house to find who stole a stash of money. The player switches between cameras to observe the characters and eavesdrop on their conversations; all the characters have a plot to steal the money. At the end of the game, the player must guess who stole the money. In December 1986, the team flew to Hasbro headquarters in Pawtucket, Rhode Island and pitched the technology to Hasbro CEO Stephen Hassenfeld and a board room of 22 executives who liked the system and gave funding to support further development for the technology and games.|$|E
