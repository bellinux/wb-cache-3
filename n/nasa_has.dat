5|$|<b>NASA</b> <b>has</b> {{made use}} of {{technologies}} such as the Multi-Mission Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator (MMRTG), which {{is a type of}} Radioisotope thermoelectric generator used on space missions. Shortages of this material have curtailed deep space missions {{since the turn of the}} millennia. An example of a spacecraft that was not developed because of a shortage of this material was New Horizons 2.|$|E
5|$|<b>NASA</b> <b>has</b> {{named the}} rim of Shackleton as a {{potential}} candidate for its lunar outpost, slated to {{be up and running}} by 2020 and continuously staffed by a crew by 2024. The location would promote self-sustainability for lunar residents, as perpetual sunlight on the south pole would provide energy for solar panels. Furthermore, the shadowed polar regions are believed to contain the frozen water necessary for human consumption and could also be harvested for fuel manufacture.|$|E
5|$|NASA {{science is}} focused on better {{understanding}} Earth through the Earth Observing System, advancing heliophysics {{through the efforts of}} the Science Mission Directorate's Heliophysics Research Program, exploring bodies throughout the Solar System with advanced robotic spacecraft missions such as New Horizons, and researching astrophysics topics, such as the Big Bang, through the Great Observatories and associated programs. NASA shares data with various national and international organizations such as from the Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite. Since 2011, <b>NASA</b> <b>has</b> been criticized for low cost efficiency, achieving little results in return for high development costs.|$|E

5|$|For {{missions}} beyond low Earth orbit (BLEO), <b>NASA</b> <b>has</b> {{been directed}} {{to develop the}} Space Launch System (SLS), a Saturn-V class rocket, and the two to six person, beyond low Earth orbit spacecraft, Orion. In February 2010, President Barack Obama's administration proposed eliminating public funds for the Constellation program and shifting greater responsibility of servicing the ISS to private companies. During {{a speech at the}} Kennedy Space Center on April 15, 2010, Obama proposed a new heavy-lift vehicle (HLV) to replace the formerly planned Ares V. In his speech, Obama called for a manned mission to an asteroid as soon as 2025, and a manned mission to Mars orbit by the mid-2030s. The NASA Authorization Act of 2010 was passed by Congress and signed into law on October 11, 2010. The act officially canceled the Constellation program.|$|E
5|$|In 2015, a {{group that}} claims {{affiliation}} with Anonymous group, calling themselves as AnonSec, claimed to have hacked and gathered almost 276 GB of data from NASA servers including NASA flight and radar logs and videos, and also multiple documents related to ongoing research. AnonSec group also claimed gaining access of a Global Hawk Drone of NASA, and released some video footage purportedly from the drone's cameras. A part of the data was released by AnonSec on Pastebin service, as an Anon Zine. <b>NASA</b> <b>has</b> denied the hack, asserting that {{the control of the}} drones were never compromised, but has acknowledged that the photos released along with the content are real photographs of its employees, but that most of these data are already available in the public domain.|$|E
5|$|<b>NASA</b> <b>has</b> speculated on the {{feasibility}} of mining the atmospheres of the outer planets, particularly for helium-3, an isotope of helium that is rare on Earth and could {{have a very high}} value per unit mass as thermonuclear fuel. Factories stationed in orbit could mine the gas and deliver it to visiting craft. However, the Jovian system in general poses particular disadvantages for colonization because of the severe radiation conditions prevailing in Jupiter's magnetosphere and the planet's particularly deep gravitational well. Jupiter would deliver about 36Sv (3600rem) per day to unshielded colonists at Io and about 5.4Sv (540rems) per day to unshielded colonists at Europa, which is a decisive aspect {{due to the fact that}} already an exposure to about 0.75Sv over a period of a few days is enough to cause radiation poisoning, and about 5Sv over a few days is fatal.|$|E

5|$|SIM's new {{technology}} {{was meant to}} lead to the development of telescopes powerful enough to take images of Earth-like extrasolar planets orbiting distant stars and to determine whether those planets are able to sustain life. <b>NASA</b> <b>has</b> already started developing future missions that will build on SIM's technological legacy. The technological development phase of the mission was completed in November 2006 with the announcement that the eight, mission-technology-milestones set by NASA were reached. The milestones were necessary steps in the technological development before flight control instruments could begin to be designed. The completion of each milestone meant that new systems had to be developed for nanometer control as well as picometer knowledge technology; these systems enable the telescope to make its accurate measurements with extreme accuracy.|$|E
