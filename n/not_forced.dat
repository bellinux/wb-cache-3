5|$|To {{the east}} von Falkenhayn, held his reserve force of 3rd Cavalry Division (Seventh Army's III Corps) and 19th Division (Eighth Army reserve) {{in front of}} Beit Jibrin. They waited {{throughout}} the day for the main attack to make progress before beginning their own advance, but the opportunity never eventuated. This powerful Ottoman counterattack had been contained and had <b>not</b> <b>forced</b> any rearrangement of the invading forces, whose preparations and concentration on the plain were now complete. But von Falkenhayn was forced to halt his Seventh Army's attack and then {{to take away from}} it the 16th Division plus one regiment.|$|E
5|$|In 1823, {{the family}} moved to the village of Georgetown, Ohio, where five more {{siblings}} were born: Simpson, Clara, Orvil, Jennie, and Mary. At the age of five, young Grant began his formal education, starting at a subscription school and later was enrolled in two private schools. In the winter of 1836–1837, Grant was a student at Maysville Seminary, and in the autumn of 1838 he attended John Rankin's academy. In his youth, Grant developed an unusual ability to ride, work with, and control horses. Expressing a strong dislike for the tannery, Grant's father instead put this ability to use giving Ulysses work driving wagon loads of supplies and transporting people. Unlike his siblings, Grant was <b>not</b> <b>forced</b> to attend church by his Methodist parents. For the rest of his life, he prayed privately and never officially joined any denomination. To others, including late in life, his own son, Grant appeared to be an agnostic. He inherited some of Hannah's Methodist piety and quiet nature while adopting his father's Whig political inclinations.|$|E
5|$|NASCAR {{spokesperson}} Jim Hunter however insisted Smith was <b>not</b> <b>forced</b> {{below the}} yellow line, and stated drivers were warned beforehand in the pre-race drivers' meeting about gaining a position illegally. Earnhardt felt Smith deserved {{to win the}} race, saying {{there was a lack}} of clarity over what going below the yellow line meant. Smith stated he did not ask for clarification of the rule because of his low-profile status. NASCAR president Mike Helton stated that race officials had correctly awarded the penalty to Smith, and clarified that no driver would be allowed to advance their position by going below the yellow line at any time during a race. Similarities were also made between Smith's overtake, and Earnhardt's pass of Kenseth below the yellow line at Talladega at the 2003 Aaron's 499.|$|E

That is, if First attacks Middle, and Middle defends by moving {{in such a way}} that First now checks Last (a discovered attack), this does <b>not</b> <b>force</b> an alliance between First and Middle. Or, if Last attacks First, and First defends by checking Last, and then Middle threatens Last's rook, this does <b>not</b> <b>force</b> an alliance between First and Middle either.|$|R

5|$|The {{battle is}} often {{described}} as the first major battle of the war in the Pacific in which Allied troops decisively defeated Japanese land forces. Although Japanese land forces had experienced local setbacks elsewhere in the Pacific earlier in the war, unlike at Milne Bay, these actions had <b>not</b> <b>forced</b> them to withdraw completely and abandon their strategic objective. Nor did they have such a profound impact upon the moral aspect of the war. Milne Bay showed the limits of Japanese capability to expand using relatively small forces in the face of increasingly larger Allied troop concentrations and command of the air. As a result of the battle, Allied morale was boosted and Milne Bay was developed into a major Allied base, which was used to mount subsequent operations in the region.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} {{directed}} by David Fincher and was written by Beau Willimon, who has served as an aide to Charles Schumer, Howard Dean and Hillary Clinton. Independent studio Media Rights Capital purchased the rights to House of Cards, with the intent on creating a series. Netflix agreed to contribute an undisclosed fixed fee to production costs in March 2011. As he was completing his work on The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, Fincher {{was introduced to the}} original miniseries by his agent and sought to develop a series with Eric Roth. House of Cards was pitched to several cable networks, including HBO, AMC and Showtime. Netflix, interested in launching their own original programming, outbid the networks, picking the series up for 26 episodes, totaling two seasons. Netflix was the only bidder that was interested in purchasing the rights without seeing a completed pilot. Thus, the show was <b>not</b> <b>forced</b> into manipulating story arcs introduced in the pilot to create artificial cliffhangers.|$|E
5|$|The ideal age {{to start}} {{training}} dromedaries for riding is three years, {{although they may}} be stubborn and unruly. At first the camel's head is controlled, and it is later trained to respond to sitting and standing commands, and to allow mounting. At this stage a camel will often try to escape when a trainer tries to mount it. The next stage involves training it to respond to reins. The animal must be given loads gradually and <b>not</b> <b>forced</b> to carry heavy loads {{before the age of}} six. Riding camels should not be struck on their necks, rather they should be struck behind the right leg of the rider. Leese described two types of saddles generally used in camel riding; the Arabian markloofa used by single riders and the Indian pakra used when two riders mount the same camel.|$|E

5|$|One whole {{month after}} {{the events of the}} {{original}} movie, Mulan and Li Shang preparing to marry but distracted by a task from the Emperor, who wants his three daughters escorted to their own marriage ceremony. Their romantic relationship becomes somewhat strained during the trip, as the romantic couple has differing views on various issues. Meanwhile, Mushu realizes that if Mulan marries Shang, she will not need him anymore as her guardian spirit, and decides to trick the two into breaking up. When bandits attack, Mulan and Shang fight them off, but Mulan is devastated when Shang is seemingly killed trying to save her. To make sure the three princesses are <b>not</b> <b>forced</b> to marry against their will, Mulan takes their place marrying the eldest son of the ruler of the neighboring land. Shang survives the accident and arrives in time to stop the wedding but ultimately Mulan is saved by Mushu who, posing as the mighty Golden Dragon of Unity, frees the three princesses from their vows, and marries Mulan and Li Shang himself causing Mulan to forgive him for his actions. Afterwards, Mulan informs Li Shang of Mushu's existence and he combines the temples of his family and hers, allowing Mushu to keep his position.|$|E
5|$|The Union flanks {{were being}} pushed back, but not decisively. Hardee and Polk caused Sherman and McClernand on the Union right to retreat in the {{direction}} of Pittsburg Landing, leaving the right flank of the Hornet's Nest exposed. Just after Johnston's death, Breckinridge, whose corps had been in reserve, attacked on the extreme left of the Union line, driving off the understrength brigade of Col. David Stuart and potentially opening a path into the Union rear and the Tennessee River. However, the Confederates paused to regroup and recover from exhaustion and disorganization, then followed the sounds of the guns toward the Hornet's Nest, and an opportunity was lost. After the Hornet's Nest fell, the remnants of the Union line established a solid three-mile (5km) front around Pittsburg Landing, extending west from the river and then north, up the River Road, keeping the approach open for the expected, although belated, arrival of Lew Wallace's division. Sherman commanded the right of the line, McClernand took the center, and on the left, the remnants of W. H. L. Wallace's, Hurlbut's, and Stuart's men mixed with thousands of stragglers who were crowding on the bluff over the landing. The advance of Buell's army, Col. Jacob Ammen's brigade of Bull Nelson's division, arrived in time to be ferried over and join the left end of the line. The defensive line included a ring of more than 50 cannons and naval guns from the river (the gunboats USS Lexington and USS Tyler). A final Confederate charge of two brigades, led by Brig. Gen. Withers, attempted to break through the line but was repulsed. Beauregard called off a second attempt after 6 p.m., as the sun set. The Confederate plan had failed; they had pushed Grant east to a defensible position on the river, <b>not</b> <b>forced</b> him west into the swamps.|$|E
