5|$|After 1938, the M-111 {{designation}} {{was given}} to an old M-6 routing in the Keweenaw Peninsula that ran between Eagle River and Phoenix along what is, now, modern-day M-26 parallel to Eagle River. That incarnation lasted two years until M-111 was deleted and M-26 was realigned over it. The M-111 designation has <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>used</b> since being deleted in 1940.|$|E
5|$|During the Olympics, {{transport}} {{was in part}} {{provided by}} Vikingskipet Station on the RÃ¸ros Line, which passes {{right next to the}} venue.

5|$|From the {{beginning}} of the planning, things went awry for the Confederates. While Pickett's division had <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>used</b> yet at Gettysburg, A.P. Hill's health became an issue and he did not participate in selecting which of his troops were to be used for the charge. Some of Hill's corps had fought lightly on July 1 and not at all on July 2. However, troops that had done heavy fighting on July 1 ended up making the charge.|$|E
5|$|Lily's {{effects in}} Puerto Vallarta {{made it the}} second {{hurricane}} of the season to be declared the worst hurricane to strike a specific city in twenty or more years. The first was Hurricane Bridget, which struck Acapulco. Despite the damage, the name was not retired and was reused in 1975, but due {{to a change in}} names lists in 1978, the name Lily has <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>used</b> since.|$|E
5|$|On July 1, 1919, M-74 ran between Pioneer and M-55 west of Merritt. There {{it turned}} east running {{concurrently}} with M-55 to Merritt where it turned south to Moddersville and terminated. The spur south of Merrit remained a state highway {{through at least}} late 1938. Late that year or early the next, the roadway between Merritt and Moddersville was turned back to local control and removed from the highway system. By late 1939, the entire highway was decommissioned in its entirety. The highway designation has <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>used</b> since.|$|E

5|$|This was {{the second}} time an East Pacific storm was named Naomi and the only time that a storm named Naomi in the basin reached {{hurricane}} strength. Because the effects from the hurricane were minor, the name was not retired after this hurricane and was re-used in the 1976 season. However, a name change in 1978 dropped the name Naomi, and the name has <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>used</b> since.|$|E

5|$|At the Portuguese Grand Prix Hill charged {{from the}} back of the grid to third, having stalled on the warm up lap from pole. He {{finished}} off the season finishing fourth in Japan and third in Australia, but it was not enough to hold 2nd place in the championship as Ayrton Senna passed him by winning the last two races. Prost finished the season as champion. Hill ended the season in Australia by setting the lap record for the Adelaide Street Circuit. As of 2017 (the full Grand Prix track has <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>used</b> since 2000), Hill's lap record of 1:15.381 for the 3.780km (2.349mi) long track still stands.|$|E
5|$|Conventional {{real estate}} {{development}} and urban planning activities are subject to conflicting interests and positional bargaining. The integrative negotiation approach emphasises mutual gains. The approach has been applied in land use planning and environmental management, but has <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>used</b> as a coordinated approach to {{real estate development}}, city design, and urban planning. Urban design management involves reordering the chain {{of events in the}} production of the built environment according to the principles of integrative negotiation. Such negotiation can be used in urban development and planning activities to reach more efficient agreements. This leads to integrative developments and more sustainable ways to produce the built environment.|$|E
5|$|Later in August, Tropical Storm Christine {{became the}} easternmost forming {{tropical}} cyclone on record when it developed formed over Guinea. The most intense storm {{of the season}} was Hurricane Ellen, a Category 3 cyclone that remained over open water. The final named storm was meteorologically significant in that it became the first recorded tropical cyclone to transition into a subtropical cyclone. No names were retired during the season; however, due to the addition of male names into the list of Atlantic hurricane names in 1979, several of the names were removed and have <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>used</b> since.|$|E

The airfield itself had <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>used</b> {{since the middle of}} August except for emergency landing and refueling of planes, but evacuation of US Air Force equipment, bombs, and petroleum products was still in progress. Davidson commanded the task force, which was composed of the US 19th Infantry, less the 3rd Battalion, the 3rd Battalion of the 9th Infantry, the 13th Field Artillery Battalion, C Battery of the 15th Field Artillery Battalion, A Company of the 3rd Engineer Combat Battalion, the 9th Infantry Regimental Tank Company, two batteries of antiaircraft automatic weapons, and other miscellaneous units.|$|E
5|$|One unusual {{defensive}} weapon was in use at Kenley on 18 August; the parachute-and-cable. Located {{on the north}} side of the airfield at 18 metre (60 foot) intervals, these were fired vertically by a rocket in salvoes of nine or more. As enemy aircraft came in at low-altitude, the parachute deployed and held a 145-metre (480 foot) long steel cable from an altitude of 180 metres (600 feet). If struck by an aircraft, a second parachute deployed and tangled the device around the victim. If the cable was picked up on the wing, there was a good chance that the aircraft would go down out of control. This device had <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>used</b> before 18 August 1940. Also available were barrage balloons with cutting cables capable of tearing off bombers' wings.|$|E
5|$|Sandoval {{made the}} Giants' Opening Day roster out of spring {{training}} in 2009 as the Giants' starting third baseman and backup catcher. He served as a personal catcher for Zito {{at the beginning of}} the year. On May 12, Sandoval hit his first walk-off home run against Joe Beimel to beat the Washington Nationals 97. Following an elbow injury to Sandoval in May, the Giants called up Eli Whiteside to serve as the backup catcher on May 24; since then, Sandoval has <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>used</b> at all as a catcher. After 73 games played, San Francisco Chronicle columnist Scott Ostler wrote that Sandoval had made the most impressive transition from the Giants farm system since 1986 when Will Clark and Robby Thompson were rookies.|$|E
