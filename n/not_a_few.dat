5|$|Nevertheless, several {{woodpeckers}} {{are under}} threat as their habitats are destroyed. Being woodland birds, deforestation and clearance {{of land for}} agriculture and other purposes can reduce populations dramatically. Some species adapt to living in plantations and secondary growth, or to open countryside with forest remnants and scattered trees, but some do <b>not.</b> <b>A</b> <b>few</b> species have even flourished when they have adapted to man-made habitats. There are few conservation projects directed primarily at woodpeckers, but they benefit whenever their habitat is conserved. The red-cockaded woodpecker {{has been the focus}} of much conservation effort in the southeastern United States, with artificial cavities being constructed in the longleaf pines they favour as nesting sites.|$|E

He persecuted them with rigorous edicts, but yet could not prevent reprisals towards Christians from taking place in Samaria toward the close of his reign. The consistency of Justinian's policy meant that the Manicheans too suffered persecution, experiencing both exile and threat of capital punishment. At Constantinople, on one occasion, <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> Manicheans, after strict inquisition, were executed in the emperor's very presence: some by burning, others by drowning.|$|E
