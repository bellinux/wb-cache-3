5|$|Despite the {{settlement}} recognising {{his claim to}} Morley's music patent, Barley seemingly {{found it difficult to}} enforce his rights, even with his <b>new</b> <b>role</b> <b>as</b> a stationer. Less than half of the known music books published from 1606 to 1613 recognised Barley's rights on the imprint. Barley took Thomas Adams to the Stationers' court in 1609, challenging the copyrights of the music books Adams had published. The court handed down a settlement similar to the one between East and Barley. However, none of the music books Adams published afterward contained any recognition of Barley's patent.|$|E

The new troop with mortar and Vickers machine gun sections provided the heavy weapons needed for their <b>new</b> <b>role</b> <b>as</b> assault infantry. By now the Commandos had started to move away from smaller raiding operations. They were formed into units intended to spearhead future Allied landing operations.

5|$|As {{a result}} of the finger spinners' success, Australian captain Ian Johnson tried to convert Davidson into a left arm {{orthodox}} spinner. Davidson returned as Australia faced a fourth meeting with Laker and Lock, in a match against Surrey immediately after the two consecutive Test maulings. On a sticky wicket that played {{into the hands of the}} Surrey spinners, Australia were skittled for 143. Only Davidson, who took the attack to the pair, made 44 not out. One six that he lofted from Laker almost reached the iconic gasometer outside The Oval. The match was drawn, and Davidson took 2/50 including Eric Bedser and Laker in his <b>new</b> <b>role</b> <b>as</b> a slow bowler.|$|E
5|$|Hassett had a <b>new</b> <b>role</b> <b>as</b> {{the teams}} headed to Headingley for the Fourth Test. He would improvise and open with Morris, as regular opener Sid Barnes was injured. Hassett dropped Len Hutton—who {{went on to}} score 81—on 25. Hassett {{struggled}} {{to make an impact}} in the unfamiliar role, scoring 13 and 17. However, the other Australian batsmen stepped up and scored 3/404 in 330 minutes on the final day to set a new world record for the highest successful Test runchase, ensuring an unassailable 3–0 series lead. Hassett scored two fifties in the lead-up to the Fifth Test, where he returned to his customary role with the return of Barnes. Hassett took a diving catch in the first innings and scored 37 in an innings win. Australia thus won the series convincingly 4–0 and Hassett finished the series with 310 runs at 44.29.|$|E
5|$|Henry {{responded to}} the French and Angevin threat by {{expanding}} his own network of supporters beyond the Norman borders. Some Norman barons deemed unreliable were arrested or dispossessed, and Henry used their forfeited estates to bribe his potential allies in the neighbouring territories, in particular Maine. Around 1110, Henry attempted to arrest the young William Clito, but William's mentors moved him {{to the safety of}} Flanders before he could be taken. At about this time, Henry probably began to style himself as the Duke of Normandy. Robert of Bellême turned against Henry once again, and when he appeared at Henry's court in 1112 in a <b>new</b> <b>role</b> <b>as</b> a French ambassador, he was arrested and imprisoned.|$|E
50|$|Petipa allowed Kschessinskaya {{to create}} {{only a small}} number of <b>new</b> <b>roles,</b> <b>as</b> he {{considered}} the Italian Pierina Legnani to be the superior ballerina. Although she was able to command top billing in theatre programs or on posters, her efforts to obtain more <b>new</b> <b>roles</b> were thwarted by Petipa, whose authority over the artistic direction of the Imperial Ballet was not challenged even by the Emperor himself. Among the few roles Kschessinskaya created were Flora in Le Réveil de Flore (1894) and Columbine in Harlequinade (1900). She also became the first Russian danseuse to master the 32 fouettés en tournant of Legnani.|$|R

5|$|In May 1940, Nazi Germany invaded Belgium as World War II {{broke out}} across Europe. Although Hergé briefly fled to France and {{considered}} a self-imposed exile, he ultimately {{decided to return}} to his occupied homeland. For political reasons, the Nazi authorities closed down Le Vingtième Siècle, leaving Hergé unemployed. In search of employment, he got a job as an illustrator at Belgium's leading newspaper, Le Soir (The Evening), which was allowed to continue publication under German management. On 17 October 1940, he was made editor of the children's supplement, Le Soir Jeunesse, in which he set about producing new Tintin adventures. In this new, more repressive political climate of German-occupied Belgium, Hergé could no longer explore political themes in his Adventures of Tintin lest he be arrested by the Gestapo. As Harry Thompson noted, Tintin's role as a reporter came to an end, to be replaced by his <b>new</b> <b>role</b> <b>as</b> an explorer.|$|E
