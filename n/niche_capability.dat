50|$|In November 1968, VAH-4 {{received}} the EKA-3 {{version of the}} Skywarrior and was redesignated as Tactical Electronic Warfare Squadron 131 (VAQ-131). In 1971, they became the second squadron in the U.S. Navy to receive the Standard version of the EA-6B Prowler. The squadron transitioned to the Expanded Capability (EXCAP) version of the Prowler in 1976, to the Improved Capablility (ICAP) Prowler in 1978, and to the ICAP II Prowler in 1984. In May 2014, they transitioned to the Boeing EA-18G Growler, which they currently operate. The EA-18G expanded the squadron's capabilities to enable more effective prosecution of radar and Surface-to-Air Missile (SAM) sites in an Integrated Air Defense System (IADS), both through air-to-ground weapon employment and precision electronic attack, the latter being the Growler's <b>niche</b> <b>capability.</b> The EA-18G is also a capable air-to-air combat platform.|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedWith conventional weapons nearing their peak capability, {{the need to}} identify alternative war fighting solutions suggests a look at Directed Energy Weapons (DEWs). The goal {{is to change the}} means by which warfare is conducted to improve operational efficiencies and overall effectiveness. The Naval Postgraduate School Systems Engineering and Analysis (SEA- 19 B) Capstone project team examined how existing directed energy technologies can provide performance across multiple warfare area domains and mission subsets for the U. S. Navy. The aim was to identify and characterize the capability gaps with conventional weapons systems, produce a coherent vision of naval missions that incorporate DEWs, and generate a roadmap for a DEW fleet. By conducting a thorough Analysis of Alternatives based on system performance, integration, schedule, and cost, the project team identified that the Tactical Laser System (with a laser beam power of 10 kW) provided the best overall capability to defend surface combatants, although none of the analyzed DEWs have the capability to replace a current conventional weapon.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the origins and}} development of signals intelligence in the Royal Australian Navy, during the period 1914 to 1945, {{within the context of}} an Australian contribution to Imperial defence. In doing so it demonstrates how the development of this capability was shaped by national, Imperial and international forces and events. The thesis thus fills a gap in the historiography of imperial defence and of early twentieth century signals intelligence. It also constitutes a case study of the development of a niche military capability by a small to medium power in the context of great power alliances and major historical events. The thesis is based principally upon the investigation of documents in the Australian, US and UK national archives, some of which have been newly declassified for this purpose. During the First World War the RAN undertook a minor cryptographic effort focused on intercepting and breaking coded messages from the German Pacific Squadron. After the War, and {{at the request of the}} RN, the RAN began to develop a signals intelligence capability aimed at the Imperial Japanese Navy. This capability was seen as part of the RAN contribution to Imperial defence. The commitment, made without Australian political approval, would see the RAN conduct two covert intelligence collection operations against the Japanese Mandated Territories. After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and subsequent defeat of the Western Powers in Asia, the RAN signals intelligence organisation became, as a consequence of agreements between Britain and the USN, part of the USN organisation in the Pacific. At no stage however, was the RAN involved in the discussions which accompanied these arrangements nor did it have any subsequent say in the strategic direction of this capability. As a consequence, when the Pacific War was drawing to a close the future of the RAN's cryptographic organisation came in to question. By the time the Japanese surrendered this issue had still not been resolved. Beyond the history of the origins and development of signals intelligence in the RAN, and of its involvement in the signals intelligence war against Japan, the thesis highlights the importance of committed individuals in small military organisations and how they can greatly influence the success or otherwise of these organisations. The ability of personnel from different nations to work together in signals intelligence is reflective of the functioning of the alliance as a whole. The development of such a <b>niche</b> <b>capability</b> by a small to medium power can have an effect on that nation's standing, in the context of alliance relationships, as it did in this case. As the RAN found however, such capabilities do not provide for automatic access to strategic decision making within an alliance...|$|E

40|$|Over {{the past}} twenty years Norwegian {{security}} has not been threatened and large parts of Europe are inherently stable. Norway is a small power in a big world. Membership in NATO is a cornerstone of Norwegian security policy. Norway has, since 1999, deliberately moved to develop domestic capabilities to improve the ability to participate in international operations. Development of an operational doctrine focused on mobility and responsiveness form a core in the current Norwegian force structure. In addition transformation of the NIS and expansion of NORSOF are seen as credible commitments towards NATO. This thesis assesses the extent of Norwegian dependence on NATO, indirectly questions why and how Norway depends on NATO. The second element of the inquiry evaluates the consequences of this dependence through the action of Norwegian policymakers. The inquest is approached through internal and external measures, herein NATO. Through focus on two threat scenarios –day-to-day and worst-case –the thesis answers the underlying questions through a focus on: the domestic arms industry; the service branches of the Armed Forces; joint capabilities; and external NATO elements. The use of a two-pronged approach to the threat environment through the extreme opposites in a threat continuum, as seen above, enable assessment of Norwegian dependence whilst assessing the impact on resource dispositions. The thesis finds that Norway is dependent on NATO for security provision, but manages under the day-to-day scenario through domestic measures. Under the alternate scenario Norway likely withstand for a short- to medium-term before needing allied assistance. The Armed Forces have transformed, increasing quality through improved mobility, responsiveness, interoperability and <b>niche</b> <b>capabilities</b> over the past decade. Changes in the Norwegian Armed Forces, threat environment, and NATO over the past decade impel policy makers to re-evaluate Norwegian commitments. Through <b>niche</b> <b>capabilities</b> and a comprehensive high-north strategy policymakers attempt to address this imbalance. To facilitate the inquests a neo-realistic framework is applied in a single case multiple-N case study in the effort to understand the role of a small state in interstate relations. In this environment states compete, sometimes escalating to armed conflict, making the security provisions of this small state of interest. Combining internal and external measures to security with its associated costs and benefits provide insight towards understanding inter-state games...|$|R
40|$|Latvia’s {{transition}} from Soviet republic to restored nation-state {{has been most}} clearly seen in {{the transition to democracy}} and the market economy. Externally, however, the Baltic State has had to negotiate complex challenges in both the local and wider security complex. In this essay I argue that the development and evolution of Latvian foreign policy illustrates a transition to post-existential politics and illuminates the nature of geo-politics in the Baltic subregion in general. Initially, Latvia had to create a foreign policy agenda with limited resources such as knowledge and capacity. The 1995 Latvian foreign policy guidelines formally established the move to the ‘West’ generally as well as membership of the EU and NATO specifically. The guidelines show that the nature of insecurity in the region was by and large dictated by Russian dominance and political transition. With the accession into the EU and NATO, we can see that Latvia’s foreign policy objectives have shifted away from balancing in the subregion to integration in the larger security architecture. This includes fulfilling the <b>niche</b> <b>capabilities</b> in the North Atlantic infrastructure as well as engaging with other post-Soviet States as they move towards the ‘West’. Furthermore, Latvia’s objectives have moved beyond the subregion to include military missions in the Balkans, Afghanistan and Iraq. Overall, I argue that a review of Latvia’s foreign policy development illustrates the evolving nature of cooperation and conflict on the threshold between East and West...|$|R

40|$|Currently, {{dramatic}} changes are {{happening in the}} IS development industry. The incumbent system developers (hubs) are embracing partnerships with less well established companies (spokes), acting in specific niches. This paper seeks to establish {{a better understanding of}} the motives for this strategy. Relying on existing work on strategic alliance formation, it is argued that partnering is particularly attractive, if these small companies possess certain capabilities that are difficult to obtain through other arrangements than partnering. Again drawing on the literature, three categories of capabilities are identified: the capability to innovate within their <b>niche,</b> the <b>capability</b> to provide a specific functionality that can be integrated with the incumbents’ systems, and the capability to address novel markets. These factors are analyzed through a case study. The case represents a market leader in the global IS development industry, which fosters a network of smaller partner firms. The study reveals that temporal dynamics between the identified factors are playing a dominant role in these networks. A cyclical partnership model is developed that attempts to explain the life cycle of a partnership within such a network...|$|R

40|$|Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) is like soccer: {{there are}} {{supporters}} and opponents. Supporters credit BMD with providing full security against rogue states. Opponents fear a renewed arms race with Russia or China. There is another analogy: {{playing in the}} major league is awarding. Land-based and seabased missile defense each are attractive options, offering pros and cons to foreign policy makers, while military planners have to make tough decisions on how to allocate scarce defense resources {{in the face of}} austerity. A small or medium-sized state like the Netherlands has only a few policy options: emulate the policy of the hegemon, strive for national or European innovative solutions or (continue to) do nothing at all. Neoclassical realism holds that the state is not a black box in the anarchy of international relations, but that the foreign policy elite makes resource allocation decisions {{on the basis of its}} own perception of the external vulnerability of the state. State institutions, domestic influence groups and party politics in turn influence both threat perception and resource allocation. Resource allocation should ideally support the best foreign policy option to counter the perceived threat. Of course, external state actors, industrial and transnational organizations influence the foreign policy elite as well. Against this backdrop, the author uses the theoretical framework of neoclassical realism to research and describe the influence that domestic influence groups can exert on policy decisions regarding the Netherlands’ BMD capabilities. After a brief introduction into neoclassical realism, the external vulnerability is described in terms of the existing ballistic missile threat posed by Iran. The threat perception is approached form the eye of the beholder: regional actors, NATO as our primary security alliance and of course domestic actors. Then the primary BMD resources available to the Netherlands are described: operational capabilities, technological innovation and defense industrial base. External factors and domestic interest groups that affect resource allocation decisions, such as the international defense industry and national civic societal actors, are analyzed. The dominant foreign policy mantra that the Netherlands’ international reputation is at stake after incessant defense budget cuts and relinquishing our NATO commitments is also taken into account as a factor of influence. Finally, four adaptive strategies are researched as BMD policy options: blindly emulate US policy (with high investment costs), join European innovation policies (with high political and investment costs), do nothing (which eventually leads to a free rider status) or a mixed innovative emulation strategy (which attains foreign policy objectives appropriate for a small or medium power while at the same time promoting Dutch industrial interests). Research indicates that very few domestic actors actually oppose the Dutch role in BMD. The author concludes that the Netherlands cannot afford to lose its leading position in European BMD capabilities. Our reputation is firmly based on our Patriot capability, and for a long time we have punched above our weight. Our credibility is at risk – and maritime BMD is one of the very few <b>niche</b> <b>capabilities</b> that we hold as bargaining chip to promote our interests in international relations. The stakes are high – but so are the potential rewards...|$|R
40|$|Increasingly, {{technological}} innovation creates markets for {{new products and}} services. To survive, firms must respond to these new markets. How do firms develop the capabilities necessary to succeed in such changing conditions? Some suggest that experience with previous entry builds such capabilities. Others suggest that capabilities arise from experience producing and selling to existing markets. The role of managers is also debated. Some argue that experience with existing markets causes managers to miss entry opportunities. Others argue that managers enter new markets when their firm possesses the experience needed to compete effectively. In this paper, we explore these issues by investigating entry patterns in the disk-drive industry. We investigate the effect of experience in existing markets and experience with previous market entry. We find that experience in previous markets increased {{the probability that a}} firm would enter a new market. We show that this experience had greater value if the firm entered the new market. We infer that managers chose to enter these markets to obtain this increase in value.

40|$|This thesis, "The Ecology of Sycamore in British Woodland", firstly {{examines}} the {{method by which}} sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus) has been introduced to the British environment, and seeks to ascertain the common locations of these introductions. An approximately 300 km 2 section of West Suffolk is selected to {{be an example of}} a typical intensively farmed, lowland, rural landscape. Classification and definition of the vegetational types present is undertaken. The area is then surveyed according to techniques designed primarily by the author. The survey produces an accurate description of vegetational composition, from which the demography of sycamore can be examined, and a database of ecologically significant factors for individual vegetation units. Subsequent research is concerned with analyzing the data from the survey in conjunction with additional studies of specific sites. An investigation of the occurrence of sycamore in relation to other native tree species and common vegetational types is effected, to reveal the 1980 s status of sycamore in terms of vegetational classification. The physical structure of woodlands is then examined to produce an estimation of sycamore's past and future competitive status in comparison with the native tree community, particularly interpreting the anthropogenic influence of woodland management. Specific sites are chosen for more detailed observation and some of the conservational implications of sycamore invasion are discussed. The way (including rate and method) in which sycamore disperses through the West Suffolk area is considered. Whether sycamore invasion of individual woodland conforms to predictable demographic patterns is questioned by mapping invasive sycamore populations. Areas of Epping Forest are included to provide an example of a management variant. The thesis continues to give an account of the possible resistance of some woodland to invasion which could be related to the physical form and species composition of individual woodlands and to the intrinsic <b>niche</b> exploitation <b>capability</b> afforded to sycamore by virtue of its dispersal adaptation. The 'strategy' and 'life mode' of sycamore is reflected upon with regard to its tolerances to various ecological components of woodland ecosystems and to the British climatic regime both past and present...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability of}} hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) to undergo {{self-renewal}} is partly regulated by external signals originating from the stem cell niche. Our previous studies with HSCs obtained from fetal liver of mice deficient for the calcium-sensing receptor (CaR) {{have shown the}} crucial role of this receptor in HSC lodgment and engraftment in the bone marrow (BM) endosteal niche. Using a CaR agonist, Cinacalcet, we assessed the effects of stimulating the CaR on the function of murine HSCs. Our results show that CaR stimulation increases primitive hematopoietic cell activity in vitro, including growth in stromal cell cocultures, adhesion to extracellular matrix molecules such as collagen I and fibronectin, and migration toward the chemotactic stimulus, stromal cell-derived factor 1 α. Receptor stimulation also led to augmented in vivo homing, CXCR 4 -mediated lodgment at the endosteal <b>niche,</b> and engraftment <b>capabilities.</b> These mechanisms by which stimulating the CaR dictates preferential localization of HSCs in the BM endosteal niche provide additional insights into the fundamental interrelationship between the stem cell and its niche. These studies also have implications {{in the area of}} clinical stem cell transplantation, where ex vivo modulation of the CaR may be envisioned as a strategy to enhance HSC engraftment in the BM...|$|R
40|$|Embargo length {{currently}} unknown. The {{article is}} still in press and will have a 36 month embargo on availability of the full text, once it has been published. The most important properties of utilitarian pottery reside in the functional roles of form and material. Functions vary considerably in terms of intended and actual use (Skibo 1992, 35 ff.) but mainly focus on food preparation, storage and transportation (Rice 1987, 208 ff.). Within these roles cooking places {{some of the greatest}} demands on a ceramic body, which has to withstand repeated cycles of heating and cooling during use. In the archaeological and ethnographic records there are several examples of pottery production centres that acquired a reputation for producing good quality cooking ware, for example the central Mediterranean island of Pantelleria (Peacock 1982, 79 - 80, Montana et al. 2007) during the Late Roman period and Pabillonis in Sardinia (Annis and Jacobs 1989 / 90) in more recent times. Such centres often exported their products into surrounding regions, suggesting that cooking pot production either occupied a social <b>niche,</b> that technical <b>capabilities</b> were restricted, or that geologically specific raw materials were preferred, leading to resource specialisation (Rice 1987, 191). This paper considers some of the key issues concerning materials choices for cooking pots. It then discusses cooking pot production from two major centres in the Aegean, the island of Aegina where volcanic materials were exploited during the prehistoric to Classical periods and the potters of Siphnos who used metamorphic resources in the modern period. These materials are compared with the quartz-rich cooking ware found in regional survey and excavations in the Berbati Valley, Greece.

40|$|Microcontact {{printing}} {{is a form}} of {{soft lithography}} that uses a molded elastomeric stamp to print patterns with micron and sub-micron scale features. This is an effective low-cost technique for replicating master patterns onto substrates. However, the traditional embodiment of using a planar stamp with a planar substrate is limited in both scale and speed. In order to achieve higher production rates, the lab scale plate-to-plate microcontact printing method must be developed into a roll-based manufacturing process. The marriage of the precision of microcontact printing with the speed of traditional press printing will fill a <b>niche</b> in manufacturing <b>capabilities.</b> Large area, high rate patterning of micron and sub-micron scale features will help to enable the economic manufacturing {{of a wide range of}} emerging technologies. Specifically, this continuous microcontact printing process could be used to make flexible displays, thin film photovoltaic cells, transparent conductors, desalination membranes, and other large-scale surface modifications. This thesis details the development of a precision roll-to-roll microcontact printing machine. This pilot-scale web-handling machine serves as the platform for research on the continuous microcontact printing process. Specific consideration is given to the design of a precision print head that is capable of maintaining consistent contact pressure even while printing at high speeds. As well, a novel camera system is developed to achieve in-situ real-time inspection of the contact region between the stamp and the substrate. The visual data from this sensor is used as feedback for the controller, enabling the print head to maintain the desired evenly distributed pressure along the entire stamp width. Results show that the closed-loop control of print contact is able to compensate for eccentricities and disturbances in the system, significantly decreasing variation in print pressure. These tests show promise for the usefulness of this novel process control technique, rather than traditional downstream sensing. As well, this pilot-scale machine succeeds in serving as a platform for continuous roll-to-roll microcontact printing research that will help to guide the scale-up of the process into a high rate manufacturing technique. by Adam M.
