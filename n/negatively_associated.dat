5|$|Aquatic life ties North American river otters almost {{exclusively}} to permanent watersheds. The river otters favor bog lakes with banked shores containing semiaquatic mammal burrows and lakes with beaver lodges. The otters avoid water bodies with gradually sloping shorelines of sand or gravel. In Maine, use of watersheds by river otters is <b>negatively</b> <b>associated</b> with the proportion of mixed hardwood-softwood stands in forested areas adjacent to waterways. However, it is positively associated {{with the number of}} beaver flowages, watershed length, and average shoreline diversity. In Idaho, river otters prefer valley habitats over mountainous terrain, and they select valley streams over valley lakes, reservoirs, and ponds. Log jams are heavily used when present. In Florida, inhabitation of North American river otters is lowest in freshwater marshes, intermediate in salt marshes, and highest in swamp forests. During the dry season, they will recede from the marshland and move to permanent ponds, where water is available and food is in greater supply. In Idaho and Massachusetts, ecological elements preferred for latrine sites include large conifers, points of land, beaver bank dens and lodges, isthmuses, mouths of permanent streams, or any object that protrudes from the water.|$|E

40|$|NFκB is an {{inducible}} transcriptional factor {{controlled by}} two principal signaling cascades and plays pivotal roles in diverse physiological processes including inflammation, apoptosis, oncogenesis, immunity, and development. Activation of NFκB signaling was detected in skin of SHAPRIN-deficient mice {{and can be}} diminished by an NFκB inhibitor. However, in vitro studies demonstrated that SHARPIN activates NFκB signaling by forming a linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex with RNF 31 (HOIP) and RBCK 1 (HOIL 1). The inconsistency between in vivo and in vitro findings about SHARPIN's function on NFκB activation could be partially due to SHARPIN's potential interactions with downstream molecules of NFκB pathway. In this study, 17 anti-flag immunoprecipitated proteins, including TRAF 2, were identified by mass spectrum analysis among Sharpin-Flag transfected mouse fibroblasts, B lymphocytes, and BALB/c LN stroma 12 cells suggesting their interaction with SHARPIN. Interaction between SHARPIN and TRAF 2 confirmed previous yeast two hybridization reports that SHARPIN was one TRAF 2 's partners. Furthermore, luciferase-based NFκB reporter assays demonstrated that SHARPIN <b>negatively</b> <b>associates</b> with NFκB activation, which can be partly compensated by over-expression of TRAF 2. These data suggested that other than activating NFκB signaling by forming ubiquitin ligase complex with RNF 31 and RBCK 1, SHARPIN may also <b>negatively</b> <b>associate</b> with NFκB activation via interactions with other NFκB members, such as TRAF 2...|$|R

DAGs are by-products of lipolysis consecutive to TAG hydrolysis by adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) and are subsequently hydrolyzed by hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL). We hypothesized that an imbalance of ATGL relative to HSL (expression or activity) may contribute to DAG accumu-lation and insulin resistance. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS—We first measured lipase expression in vastus lateralis biopsies of young lean (n = 9), young obese (n = 9), and obese-matched type 2 diabetic (n = 8) subjects.

We also found that eIF 3 a over-expression increases IR-induced DNA damage and decreases Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ) activity by suppressing expression level of NHEJ repair proteins such as DNA-PKcs and vice versa.

40|$|Although {{many believe}} that {{creativity}} associates with a vulnerability to psychopathology, research findings are inconsistent. Here we address this possible linkage between risk of psychopathology and creativity in nonclinical samples. We propose that propensity for specific psychopathologies {{can be linked to}} basic motivational approach and avoidance systems, and that approach and avoidance motivation differentially influences creativity. Based on this reasoning, we predict that propensity for approach-based psychopathologies (e. g., positive schizotypy and risk of bipolar disorder) associates with increased creativity, whereas propensity for avoidance-based psychopathologies (e. g., anxiety, negative schizotypy, and depressive mood) associates with reduced creativity. Previous meta-analyses resonate with this proposition and showed small positive relations between positive schizotypy and creativity and small negative relations between negative schizotypy and creativity and between anxiety and creativity. To this we add new meta-analytic findings showing that risk of bipolar disorder (e. g., hypomania, mania) positively associates with creativity (k = 28, r =. 224), whereas depressive mood <b>negatively</b> <b>associates</b> (albeit weakly) with creativity (k = 39, r = -. 064).
