5|$|All {{medical records}} and documents, {{including}} Poe's death certificate, have been lost, {{if they ever}} existed. The precise cause of Poe's death is disputed, but many theories exist. Many biographers have addressed the issue and reached different conclusions, ranging from Jeffrey Meyers' assertion that it was hypoglycemia to John Evangelist Walsh's conspiratorial murder plot theory. It has also been suggested that Poe's death might have resulted from suicide related to depression. In 1848, he <b>nearly</b> <b>died</b> from an overdose of laudanum, readily available as a tranquilizer and pain killer. Though it is unclear {{if this was a}} true suicide attempt or just a miscalculation on Poe's part, it did not lead to Poe's death a year later.|$|E

5|$|Controversy arose {{during the}} ten-lap Milan criterium {{of the ninth}} stage, when the riders staged a protest over what they viewed as unsafe riding {{conditions}} in that stage and those that preceded it. The most visible cause for the protest was Rabobank rider Pedro Horrillo's accident during the eighth stage; Horrillo sustained numerous fractures and head injuries after tumbling over a barricade on the roadside while descending the Culmine di San Pietro. Horrillo fell more than , and <b>nearly</b> <b>died</b> {{as a result of}} his injuries.

5|$|Producer Lauren Shuler Donner {{had hoped}} to start filming in March 2002, but {{production}} did not begin until June 17, 2002 in Vancouver and ended by November. Over sixty-four sets were used in thirty-eight different locations. The film crew encountered problems when there was insufficient snow in Kananaskis, Alberta for them to use for some scenes. A large amount of fake snow was then applied. The idea to have Jean Grey sacrifice herself {{at the end and}} to be resurrected in a third installment was highly secretive. Singer did not tell Famke Janssen until midway through filming.

5|$|Revolution {{broke out}} in St. Petersburg {{in the spring of}} 1917. At the height of the chaos, Maria and her {{siblings}} were stricken with measles. The Tsarina was reluctant to move the children to the safety of the imperial residence at Gatchina, even though she was advised to do so. Maria was the last of the five to fall ill and, while she was still healthy, was a major source of support to her mother. Maria went outside with her mother on the night of March 13, 1917 to plead with the soldiers to remain loyal to the imperial family. Shortly afterwards, the seventeen-year-old fell ill with measles and virulent pneumonia and <b>nearly</b> <b>died.</b> She was not told that her father had abdicated the throne until after she began to recover.|$|E
5|$|Susanna Paine, born in Rehoboth, Massachusetts on June 9, 1792, was {{the second}} child of James Paine (b. 1764–65) and Mary Chaffee Paine (1767–1849). Her father was a mariner. When {{she was a young}} girl, he was lost at sea. She then lived with her {{maternal}} grandparents, Reverend Jonathan Chaffee and Mary Chaffee. Paine, an excellent student, attended school until she was 11 years of age, when she was needed to help care for her ill grandmother. The following year she <b>nearly</b> <b>died</b> {{as the result of a}} lightning strike that killed the person standing beside her. Believed to have died, she resumed consciousness after one hour, but suffered from seizures for several years after the incident. Her mother married widower Nathaniel Thurber on April 9, 1808, and the combined household, including his four children, moved to a Foster, Rhode Island farm.|$|E
5|$|The {{walk back}} to Bear Valley was very slow; at one point, Reed sent ahead {{two of the men}} to {{retrieve}} the first cache of food, expecting the third relief to come at any moment, a small party led by Selim E. Woodworth. A violent blizzard arose after they scaled the pass. Five-year-old Isaac Donner froze to death, and Reed <b>nearly</b> <b>died.</b> Mary Donner's feet were badly burned because they were so frostbitten that she did not realize she was sleeping with them in the fire. When the storm passed, the Breen and Graves families were too apathetic and exhausted to get up and move, not having eaten for days. The relief party {{had no choice but to}} leave without them.|$|E

5|$|Anning {{searched for}} fossils in the area's Blue Lias cliffs, {{particularly}} {{during the winter months}} when landslides exposed new fossils that had to be collected quickly before they were lost to the sea. She <b>nearly</b> <b>died</b> in 1833 during a landslide that killed her dog, Tray. Her discoveries included the first ichthyosaur skeleton correctly identified; the first two more complete plesiosaur skeletons found; the first pterosaur skeleton located outside Germany; and important fish fossils. Her observations {{played a key role in}} the discovery that coprolites, known as bezoar stones at the time, were fossilised faeces. She also discovered that belemnite fossils contained fossilised ink sacs like those of modern cephalopods. When geologist Henry De la Beche painted Duria Antiquior, the first widely circulated pictorial representation of a scene from prehistoric life derived from fossil reconstructions, he based it largely on fossils Anning had found, and sold prints of it for her benefit.|$|E
5|$|Diffie {{has been}} married three times. His first wife was Janise Parker, whom he married while in college. The couple had two children, Parker and Kara, then {{divorced}} in 1986. Parker later worked as Diffie's on-road manager in the mid-2000s, and in mid-2010, he and Kara auditioned for American Idol. Two years after divorcing Janise, Diffie married Debbie Jones, a nurse technician. They had two sons, Drew and Tyler, the latter of whom was born with Down syndrome and <b>nearly</b> <b>died</b> in 1991 following complications from a tonsillectomy. Diffie began an affair with Liz Allison, the widow of NASCAR driver Davey Allison, in 1993. In 1994, a judge ordered Diffie to pay Jones $3,000 per month towards their pending divorce settlement, and not to allow Drew and Tyler {{to be in the}} presence of any girlfriend; he divorced Jones in 1996. In 2000, Diffie married the former Theresa Crump, whom he met at a concert, at the Opryland Hotel in Nashville, Tennessee. They have one daughter, Kylie Tarissa, born in 2004.|$|E
5|$|Ellet and Stephens {{continued}} {{writing to}} Griswold's ex-wife, urging {{her to have}} the divorce repealed. Myers was finally convinced and filed in Philadelphia on September 23, 1853. The court, however, had lost records of the divorce and had to delay the appeal. Adding to Griswold's troubles, that fall, a gas leak in his home caused an explosion and a fire. He was severely burned, losing his eyelashes, eyebrows, and seven of his finger nails. That same year, his 15-year-old daughter, Emily, <b>nearly</b> <b>died</b> in Connecticut. A train she was riding on had fallen off a drawbridge into a river. When Griswold arrived he saw 49corpses in a makeshift morgue. Emily had been pronounced dead when pinned underwater but a doctor was able to revive her. On February 24, 1856, the divorce appeal went to court, with Ellet and Stephens providing lengthy testimony against Griswold's character. Neither Griswold nor Myers attended and the appeal was dismissed. Embarrassed by the ordeal, McCrillis left Griswold in New York and moved in with family in Bangor, Maine.|$|E

5|$|Following his retirement, Killebrew was a {{television}} broadcaster for the Twins at WTCN TV from 1976 to 1978, the Oakland Athletics from 1979 to 1982, the California Angels in 1983 and back with Minnesota from 1984 to 1988. While with Oakland, {{he also served}} as a major- and minor-league hitting instructor. In the late 1980s, Killebrew had financial problems. In July 1988, his house went into foreclosure and, in 1989, the Minneapolis Star Tribune reported that he had fallen $700,000 into debt. He also divorced his first wife of over 30 years, Elaine, who he had married in 1955. Soon after, Killebrew's health failed. In May 1990, he {{was rushed to the hospital}} with a collapsed lung and damaged esophagus. Together with a subsequent abscess and staph infection, Killebrew endured three surgeries and <b>nearly</b> <b>died.</b> He used a wheelchair for some time post-surgery. By December 1990, his health was improved and he was remarried to Nita.|$|E
5|$|His nephew and biographer (Ferdinand Brock Tupper) {{asserts that}} shortly after Brock joined the regiment, a {{professional}} dueller forced a match on him. As the one being challenged Brock had {{his choice of}} terms, and he insisted that they use pistols. His friends were shocked as Brock was a large target and his opponent an expert shot. Brock, however, refused to change his mind. When the duellist arrived at the field, he asked Brock to decide how many paces they would take. Brock insisted that the duel would take place not at the usual range, but at handkerchief distance (i.e., close range). The duellist declined and subsequently {{was forced to leave}} the regiment. This contributed to Brock's popularity and reputation among his fellow officers, as this duellist had a formidable reputation and was reportedly regarded as a bully in the regiment. During his time with this regiment, Brock served in the Caribbean, where he fell ill with fever and <b>nearly</b> <b>died.</b> He did not fully recover until after returning to England in 1793.|$|E
5|$|When Britten {{was three}} months old he {{contracted}} pneumonia and <b>nearly</b> <b>died.</b> The illness {{left him with a}} damaged heart, and doctors warned his parents that he would probably never be able to lead a normal life. He recovered more fully than expected, and as a boy was a keen tennis player and cricketer. To his mother's great delight he was an outstandingly musical child, unlike his sisters, who inherited their father's indifference to music, while his brother, though musically talented, was interested only in ragtime. Edith gave the young Britten his first lessons in piano and notation. He made his first attempts at composition when he was five. He started piano lessons when he was seven years old, and three years later began to play the viola. He {{was one of the last}} composers brought up on exclusively live music: his father refused to have a gramophone or, later, a radio in the house.|$|E
