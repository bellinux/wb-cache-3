This kind of approach leaves other, less known but by <b>no</b> means <b>less</b> <b>important,</b> putative mechanisms of resistance. We tried to shed some light on these mechanisms of resistance. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a research through Pubmed database of all published articles highlighting mechanisms of resistance to Cetuximab and Panitumumab based therapies, published in 2000 - 2012 period. CONCLUSIONS: We reviewed the "classical" molecular factors, extensively analyzed as predictive factors for efficacy to anti-EGFR therapy, such as K-ras, B-raf, and PI 3 K-mTOR-Akt, focusing on their predictive or prognostic value and on the controversial aspects of the biomarker analysis for clinical practice. On the second part we will then move on to other less known molecular markers, for the future understanding of biological mechanisms underlying anti-EGFR therapy resistance, such as non-canonical heterodimer candidates, microRNA, IGF 1 -IGF 1 R, HGF-cMET and secondary mutations of EGFR...|$|R

The priests and nobility of the Muisca were eliminated. Only the Capitanias remained. Much information about the Muisca culture was gathered by the Spanish administration and by authors such as Pedro de Aguado and Lucas Fernández de Piedrahita.

25|$|From {{the start}} of the war in 1939 until VE Day, several of Canada's Atlantic coast ports became {{important}} to the resupply effort for the United Kingdom and later for the Allied land offensive on the Western Front. Halifax and Sydney, Nova Scotia, became the primary convoy assembly ports, with Halifax being assigned the fast or priority convoys (largely troops and essential material) with the more modern merchant ships, while Sydney was given slow convoys which conveyed bulkier material on older and more vulnerable merchant ships. Both ports were heavily fortified with shore radar emplacements, search light batteries, and extensive coastal artillery stations all manned by RCN and Canadian Army regular and reserve personnel. Military intelligence agents enforced strict blackouts throughout the areas and anti-torpedo nets were in place at the harbor entrances, making a direct attack on those facilities unfeasible due to the impossibility for Germany to provide air support. Even though no landings of German personnel took place near these ports, there were frequent attacks by U-boats on convoys departing for Europe once these had reached the mouth of the St. Lawrence. Less extensively used, but <b>no</b> <b>less</b> <b>important,</b> was the port of Saint John which also saw matériel funneled through the port, largely after the United States entered the war in December 1941.

40|$|In {{some social}} movements, we {{find people who}} invite suffering—or {{actually}} inflict it on themselves—as an act of protest. They march long distances, go willingly to jail, welcome or provoke the blows of police, refuse to eat, and even kill themselves. In short, they act as if costs were benefits. The costs are not merely time and money, but the more profound costs of physical hardship and emotional distress, and occasionally the ultimate cost of life itself. The benefits are collective rather than individual; these actions contribute to a “collective good”. This raises the problem of altruism in its most acute form: if {{it is hard to}} reconcile the act of voting with self-interest, consider the act of sacrificing one’s life. These actions raise another puzzle, <b>less</b> obvious but <b>no</b> <b>less</b> theoretically <b>important.</b> How can suffering contribute to a collective good? This question has rarely been posed, let alone answered. The neglect is curious given the significance of deliberately chosen suffering in the history of social movements. This chapter conceptualizes communicative suffering as one form or dimension of political protest, and identifies the mechanisms underpinning it. Examples are drawn from two movements: Indians challenging British rule in the 1920 s and 1930 s, and African Americans challenging racial oppression in the 1960 s...|$|R

Therefore a postal questionnaire was sent to 100 hospital doctors dealing with children asking which features made them consider a parent to be difficult or unlikeable. Seventy eight responded. Most problems arose from parents who displayed aggression, disparagement of their child, unacknowledged anxiety, or fixed ideas about the medical condition and its management. Other unpopular parental features were poor compliance, failure to listen, and the attendance of more than one accompanying adult. Respondents graded 16 features in order of their detrimental effect on the child's care.

40|$|Greater human {{longevity}} {{is one of}} {{the biggest}} achievements of medicine. Timely medical interventions save countless human lives. But some of them, especially those undertaken in the face of imminent death, often generate serious ethical dilemmas. After reaching a certain critical point, the otherwise welcomed and blessed possibilities of prolonging life sometimes degenerate into a painful prolongation of dying. A spontaneous moral intuition, as well as a more balanced, careful ethical reflection – for which human life constitutes the highest value – permits withdrawal of ineffective therapy. But just what are the criteria for making that crucial decision to terminate a medical therapy? How does one define them? The article opens with the overview of terminology applied to medical interventions that fall into the category of inadequate treatment, both from the perspective of medical futility (futile treatment), the standpoint of the physician (overzealous treatment) and the actual suffering of the patient (burdensome treatment). It then examines the criteria for the termination of treatment, among which the prognosis of imminent death and disagreements over the extent of the basic medical care play crucial roles. The final parts of the article focus on some additional, though by <b>no</b> means <b>less</b> <b>important,</b> issues relating to end of life, like the truth at the sickbed, patient’s advance decision concerning the extent of medical interventions he is willing to accept and the physician’s conscience clause...|$|R

The specific goal is the use of a minimum number of wiring levels, with wiring sizes that achieve the performance requirements.

The human-security concept discursively embraces both the diversity of threats in the world and the wisdom of having diverse actors address these diverse threats. Because the human-security concept is not a theoretical approach, I endeavour in this study to transform the concept into a theory before embarking on an exploration of the ongoing effort to create the APSC...|$|R
