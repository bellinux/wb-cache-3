5|$|In his {{biography}} of Hick, David Cheetham notes {{a criticism of}} Hick's theory: waiting for eschatological verification could make religious belief provisional, preventing total commitment to faith. Cheetham argues that such criticism is misapplied because Hick's theory was <b>not</b> <b>directed</b> to religious believers but to philosophers, who argued that religion is unverifiable and therefore meaningless.|$|E

5|$|Kono's {{inspiration}} for the first Clock Tower title came from watching Italian film director Dario Argento's horror films, especially his film Phenomena (1985). The game began as an experimental project with a low budget and small staff. It sold well enough to prompt a direct sequel which competed with Capcom's Resident Evil (1996). The third game in the series was <b>not</b> <b>directed</b> by Kono and was a critical failure. Human Entertainment {{went out of business}} in 2000, after which Sunsoft purchased the Clock Tower intellectual property. They would go on to develop Clock Tower 3 with Capcom which was a commercial failure.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after the}} success of Kedok Ketawa, Saeroen joined Union Films and wrote four films for the company. These were <b>not</b> <b>directed</b> by Jo An Djan, who left Union for the {{competitor}} Populair's Film, but by the newly hired R Hu and Rd Ariffien. Union Film ultimately produced a total of seven films in 1940 and 1941 before being closed following the Japanese invasion in early 1942. Of the film's main cast, only Fatimah and Oedjang are recorded as continuing their acting career, both appearing in several further Union productions. However, in the 1950s Resobowo continued his career behind the screen, serving as art director of such films as Darah dan Doa (The Long March; 1950).|$|E
5|$|The next Divine film, Lust in the Dust (1985), reunited {{him with}} Tab Hunter and was Divine's first film <b>not</b> <b>directed</b> by John Waters. Set in the Wild West {{during the nineteenth}} century, the movie was a sex comedy that starred Divine as Rosie Velez, a {{promiscuous}} woman {{who works as a}} singer in saloons and competes for the love of Abel Wood (Tab Hunter) against another woman. A parody of the 1946 western Duel in the Sun, the film was a moderate critical success, with Divine receiving praise from a number of reviewers. Divine followed this production with a very different role, that of gay male gangster Hilly Blue in Trouble in Mind (1985). The script was written with Divine in mind. Although not a major character in the film, Divine had been eager to play the part because he wished to perform in more male roles and leave behind the stereotype of simply being a female impersonator. Reviews of the film were mixed, as were the evaluations of Divine's performance.|$|E

However, Cairano's attention was <b>not</b> <b>directed</b> to Salò, which he visited rarely, or even to San Pietro in Oliveto, which was mainly run by Sanmicheli, but to two works of greater importance and resonance: the grand staircase of the Loggia and the arch at Sant'Apollonio.|$|E
