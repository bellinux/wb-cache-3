5|$|Active {{resistance}} in Belgium {{took the form}} of sabotaging railways and lines of communication as well as hiding Jews and Allied airmen. The resistance produced large numbers of illegal newspapers in both French and Dutch, distributed to the public to provide news about the war <b>not</b> <b>available</b> <b>in</b> officially approved, censored newspapers. Some such publications achieved considerable success, such as La Libre Belgique, which reached a circulation of 70,000. Attacks on German soldiers were comparatively rare as the German administration made a practice of executing at least five Belgian hostages for each German soldier killed. At great personal risk, Belgian civilians also hid large numbers of Jews and political dissenters hunted by the Germans.|$|E
5|$|Detectives began re-examining 10,000 witness statements, and {{submitting}} {{items for}} forensic tests <b>not</b> <b>available</b> <b>in</b> 1985. In September 2004 the back garden of a terraced council house in Willan Road, near the Broadwater Farm estate, was excavated after a tip-off. A female friend of Cynthia Jarrett, {{the woman whose}} death sparked the Broadwater Farm riot, lived alone at the house between 1984 and 1989, {{and according to the}} Evening Standard {{was one of the first}} on the scene when police raided Jarrett's house.|$|E
5|$|Educational {{opportunities}} in emergency medicine are <b>not</b> <b>available</b> <b>in</b> many countries, {{and even when}} present, they are often in their infancy. Botswana opened its first medical school in 2009, with a program in emergency medicine following in 2011. The program aims to train four to six physicians in emergency medicine each year. Limitations on in-country training mean that the program includes six months of training at an international site. The organization {{of the program is}} modeled on South Africa's program due to the similarities in resource constraints and disease burdens and the eagerness of College of Emergency Medicine of South Africa and Emergency Medicine Society of South Africa to support the expansion of emergency medicine. Two years of clinical practice are required before entering the residency program, as in the South African and Australian approaches.|$|E

5|$|Elgato {{introduced}} a Thunderbolt docking station in June 2014. A computer is {{plugged into the}} dock using a Thunderbolt port {{in order to gain}} access to the dock's three USB ports, audio jacks, HDMI and ethernet. It is typically used to plug a Macbook into an office setting (printer, monitor, keyboard) or to provide additional ports <b>not</b> <b>available</b> <b>in</b> the Macbook Air. A review in The Register said it was compact and useful, but Windows users should consider a USB 3.0 dock. The Register and CNET disagreed on whether it was competitively priced. Reviews in TechRadar and Macworld gave it 4 out of 5 stars.|$|E
5|$|In 1930, Segrè began {{studying}} the Zeeman effect in certain alkaline metals. When his progress stalled because the diffraction grating he required to continue was <b>not</b> <b>available</b> <b>in</b> Italy, {{he wrote to}} four laboratories elsewhere in Europe asking for assistance and received an invitation from Pieter Zeeman to finish his work at Zeeman's laboratory in Amsterdam. Segrè was awarded a Rockefeller Foundation fellowship and, on Fermi's advice, elected {{to use it to}} study under Otto Stern in Hamburg. Working with Otto Frisch on space quantization produced results that apparently did not agree with the current theory; but Isidor Isaac Rabi showed that theory and experiment were in agreement if the nuclear spin of potassium was +1/2.|$|E
5|$|In April 2014, the Kansas District Court {{granted a}} {{petition}} from Manning for a legal name change. An Army spokesman stated {{that while the}} Army would update personnel records to acknowledge the name change, the military would continue to regard Manning as a male. Manning sought hormone therapy {{and the right to}} live as a woman while confined, consistent with her gender dysphoria, which had been confirmed by two Army medical specialists. Such treatment is provided in civilian federal prisons when it is found to be medically necessary, but it is <b>not</b> <b>available</b> <b>in</b> military prisons. The Pentagon policy at the time considered transgender individuals ineligible to serve.|$|E

5|$|Multiplayer {{comes in}} two forms in Empire: Total War. As with {{previous}} Total War titles, players {{can engage in}} real-time battles against each other either by composing their armies themselves, or re-enacting battles from history. The full campaign multiplayer mode was unveiled {{one month after the}} initial release, because the technology to create a multiplayer campaign game was <b>not</b> <b>available</b> <b>in</b> previous Total War games, and the time allowed The Creative Assembly to implement this for Empire: Total War. The campaign multiplayer mode was first tested in a two-player beta build which was released on 7 December 2009.|$|E
5|$|On February 9, 2006, Nick Baron {{announced}} that a version of Halo 2 would be released on PC, exclusively for the Windows Vista operating system. While this was a deliberate decision by Microsoft to push sales of Vista, the game could be enabled to play on Windows XP through an unauthorized third-party patch. The game was ported by a small team at Microsoft Game Studios (codenamed Hired Gun) who worked closely with Bungie. As one of the launch titles of Games for Windows – Live, the game offered Live features <b>not</b> <b>available</b> <b>in</b> the Xbox version, such as guide support and achievements. The Windows port also added two exclusive multiplayer maps and a map editor.|$|E
5|$|On July 9, it was {{announced}} that Hungarian fans had until July 27, to choose their songs from an extensive pool of 122 tracks, in a two-stage process.

Notably expansions on the pool choice included: A larger option of tracks from Thriller 25 and the inclusion of 12 tracks from The Ultimate Collection (these are <b>not</b> <b>available</b> <b>in</b> the Australian or New Zealand version). In the first round (July 9 - July 15) the fans were able to vote for their top 50 tracks. In round two (July 16 - July 27) the 50 were cut down to the album track list.|$|E
