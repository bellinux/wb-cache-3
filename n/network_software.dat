25|$|Hayes, having bet {{the company}} on a system that was never {{actually}} deployed, had no new products in the pipeline. In an attempt at diversification in January 1991 it had acquired most of the assets of local area <b>network</b> <b>software</b> developer Waterloo Microsystems Inc of Waterloo, Ontario and belatedly entered the operating system (OS) market in June 1991 with LANstep, a network OS for small offices, but this was subsequently abandoned in 1994 {{in the face of}} stiff competition particularly from Novell NetWare. An effort was started to move into the market for ADSL and cable modems, but this was a multi-year effort during a period when USR increasingly took over the market. They entered Chapter 11 protection in November 1994, exiting in October 1995 as Hayes Corp. after selling 49% of the company to Nortel and a Singapore-based venture capital firm. In 1997 they merged with Access Beyond, a builder of ISP rack-mount modems and terminal servers, and changed the company name again, this time to Hayes Communications. The merger was primarily a way to take the company public. The stock started crashing over the next year, from around US$12 in early 1998 to pennies in October, when they once again filed for Chapter 11 protection. No new funding could be found, and in 1999 the company assets were liquidated.|$|E

[...] The creators believed this was [...] the first use of the Internet to allow simultaneous querying of transatlantic scientific databases. [...] Until 1994, the service was available via proprietary <b>network</b> <b>software,</b> but it was transferred to the nascent World Wide Web early that year. [...] The number of users of the service quadrupled in the five weeks following the introduction of the ADS web-based service.|$|E
500|$|Pakistan blocked access on February 23, 2008, {{because of}} [...] "offensive material" [...] towards the Islamic faith, {{including}} {{display of the}} Danish cartoons of Muhammad. This led to a near global blackout of the YouTube site for around two hours, as the Pakistani block was inadvertently transferred to other countries. On February 26, 2008, the ban was lifted after the website had removed the objectionable content from its servers {{at the request of}} the government. Many Pakistanis circumvented the three-day block by using virtual private <b>network</b> <b>software.</b> In May 2010, following the Everybody Draw Mohammed Day, Pakistan again blocked access to YouTube, citing [...] "growing sacrilegious content". The ban was lifted on May 27, 2010, after the website removed the objectionable content from its servers {{at the request of the}} government. However, individual videos deemed offensive to Muslims posted on YouTube will continue to be blocked. Pakistan again placed a ban on YouTube in September 2012, after the site refused to remove the film Innocence of Muslims, with the ban still in operation as of September 2013. The ban was lifted in January 2016 after YouTube launched a Pakistan-specific version.|$|E

40|$|The {{availability}} of <b>networked</b> <b>software</b> services is {{an increasingly important}} quality of service issue. A service user gauges service availability in terms of initial access time and subsequent service delivery time.
