By measuring γF in both a polar and an apolar liquid system, the fibre surface tension γS and its dispersive and polar parts, γSd and γSp, respectively, can be calculated using the harmonic mean approximation. The fibre surface tensions found for untreated and extracted natural fibres are in good agreement with literature data for surface tensions of various fibre components such as cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin and waxes.

40|$|AbstractThe {{behaviour}} {{of different}} <b>cellulosic</b> <b>fibres</b> during acid hydrolysis {{has been investigated}} and the levelling-off degree of polymerisation (LODP) has been determined. The study included a bleached kraft pulp (both never-dried and once-dried) and two dissolving pulps (once-dried). Additionally, cotton cellulose from new cotton sheets and sheets discarded after long-time use was studied. Experimental results from the investigation, together with results found in literature, imply that ultrastructural differences between different fibres affect their susceptibility towards acid hydrolysis. Drying of a bleached kraft pulp was found to enhance the rate of acid hydrolysis and also result in a decrease in LODP. This implies that the susceptibility of <b>cellulosic</b> <b>fibres</b> towards acid hydrolysis is affected by drying-induced stresses in the cellulose chains.

40|$|Natural fibres have {{terminal}} {{groups in}} their polymer structure {{that make them}} appropriate for anchoring other groups with specific functional properties. The most used chemicals so far based on this possibility are reactive dyes for <b>cellulosic</b> <b>fibres</b> discovered {{as far back as}} 1956. Twenty to thirty years on and other products were attached to <b>cellulosic</b> <b>fibres</b> for increasing the yield of reactive dyes or even dyeing with reactive dyes without salt. These were cationic groups that attracted the anionic dyes used. The process didn’t progress much into industrial application, mainly because of colour non-uniformity problems. Based on the experience of these technologies, we can go much further and attach longer chain cationic groups that have anti-bacterial properties. This has also been claimed by at least one company to be happening with their products. However, the application of these and other anti-bacterial products is invariably after dyeing, mainly by padding methods, with the use of resins. In this work we apply novel reactive long chain cationic products to <b>cellulosic</b> <b>fibres</b> by exhaustion method before dyeing, and promote the chemical reaction with the hydroxyl groups on the fibre. The main objective was to prove that the process is viable when applied before dyeing, and that it has benefits since no salt is not used, or used in less quantities, and there is no subsequent fixation of the anti-bacterial product by resins, eventually containing formaldehyde is necessary, making it globally into a much more ecological process...|$|R

This {{material}} is renewable, biodegradable and very ecological. In fact, it requires very little amount of water to grow and neither insecticides nor pesticides are needed. In this work, three methods have been used to extract and obtain the Alfa fibres. These inquiries involve the study of the Alfa undergoing them only to an initial mechanical treatment (α 1 fibres); adding to it, a chemical treatment using NaOH 3 N (α 2 fibres) and, finally, an enzymatic treatment is incorporated to the mechanical and alkali treatments (α 3 fibres). The effects of these treatments on the fibres have been studied by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Fourier Transformation InfraRed (FTIR), linear density, density, moisture regain, tensile test, water absorption, contact angle and X-ray diffraction. It has been observed that both (α 2) and (α 3) fibres have promising results, SEM images and FTIR spectra show the elimination level of the non-cellulosic components presents in the stems. Pectinase used in the last extraction have a supplementary cleaning up effect. It was found using X-Ray diffraction that cristallinity index increases after treatments, this effect is due to the partial elimination of the amorphous cellulose and the removal of the <b>non</b> <b>cellulosic</b> material during the treatment. The tensile properties were obtained from single filament tensile test, resulting in values similar to those of natural fibres like Agave or Sisal [12].

40|$|The {{material}} properties of fibre networks and fibre reinforced composites are {{strongly influenced by}} fibre-fibre interactions. Stress transfer between load bearing elements in such materials is often dictated {{by the nature of}} the fibre-fibre interface. Inter-fibre bonding is solely responsible for internal cohesion in paper, because all stresses transferred between fibres operate through fibre-fibre bonds.. The future development of <b>cellulosic</b> <b>fibre</b> materials will require an improved understanding of the fibre-fibre interface. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) was proposed as a new tool for the study of fibre interfaces. A protocol for covalent linkage of fluorophores to natural and regenerated <b>cellulosic</b> <b>fibres</b> was developed and the absorptive and emissive properties of these dyes were characterized. The fluorescent response of these dyed fibres in paper sheets was studied using steady-state fluorescence spectroscopy. Fluorescence micrographs of fibre crossings on glass slides were analyzed using the FRETN correction algorithm. Energy transfer from coumarin dyed fibres to fluorescein dyed fibres at the interface was observed. The FRETN surfaces for spruce and viscose rayon fibre crossings were distinctly different. The FRET microscopy method was able to detect statistically significant differences in spruce fibre interface development when fibre fraction and wet pressing were varied. The coalescence of natural <b>cellulosic</b> <b>fibre</b> interfaces during drying was also observed with the technique. Polysaccharide films were employed as model systems for the natural and regenerated cellulose fibre interfaces. It was found that pressing cellulose films did not result in significantly increased FRETN either due to resistance to deformation or the inability to participate in interdiffusion. Conversely, xylan films demonstrated a drastic increase in the FRETN signal with increased wet pressing. These results support the previously observed differences between regenerated cellulose fibres and natural wood fibres. The results of the FRETN analysis of the polysaccharide film model systems suggest that lower molecular weight amorphous carbohydrates are likely to be significant contributors to fibre interface development.

40|$|Abstract — Cotton as a {{dominating}} {{natural fibre}} imparts a major contribution {{in the whole}} textile market including natural and artificial fibres. The demand of this <b>cellulosic</b> <b>fibre</b> is increasing rapidly day by day, {{on the other hand}} supply cannot fulfill its demand, and as a result price goes higher in world market. Viscose as cellulosic origin, the cheapest of all <b>cellulosic</b> <b>fibres</b> could be the best alternative. Viscose fibre exhibits some similar properties compared to cotton except its poor wet strength. In this research work different chemical finishes were applied to improve the wet strength of viscose fabric. For this purpose water repellent and soil release finishes were applied. Both water repellent and soil release finishes helped in reducing the molecular barrier around the individual fibres that lowered the surface tension of the fibre. It reduces the absorbency of viscose fibre hence leads to higher wet strength. Water repellent finish was applied alone as well as in combination with soil release finish. It was seen that viscose fibre exhibited better wet strength after applying water repellent and soil release finishes on it. This improved property of viscose could replace the cotton fibre in certain applications like bed linen. Index Term — Cotton, cellulose, viscose, wet strength, wate...|$|R
