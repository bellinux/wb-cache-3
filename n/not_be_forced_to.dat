The Court ruled that this withdrawal of funding was unconstitutionally coercive and that individual states had the right to opt out without losing preexisting Medicaid funding.|$|E

The Immigration and Naturalization Service records indicate that very few Costa Ricans have actually tried to enter the country illegally.

25|$|The {{soldiers}} currently fighting near Béxar were volunteers, {{who joined}} the army to accomplish a specific task and staunchly maintained their right to elect their own leaders. On November 13, the council officially established a regular army. Houston was appointed to command this new Provisional Army of Texas, subject to the orders of the governor. Houston was instructed to raise an army from scratch; because the volunteers had organized before the Consultation convened, they could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> accept Houston as their commander. The new army should consist of 2,500men, who would enlist for 2-year terms in exchange for land grants.|$|E
25|$|After {{the capture}} of Peking by the foreign armies, some of Empress Dowager Cixi's {{advisers}} advocated that the war be carried on, arguing that China could have defeated the foreigners as it was disloyal and traitorous people within China who allowed Beijing and Tianjin to be captured by the Allies, and that the interior of China was impenetrable. They also recommended that Dong Fuxiang continue fighting. The Empress Dowager Cixi was practical, however, and decided that the terms were generous {{enough for her to}} acquiesce when she was assured of her continued reign after the war and that China would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> cede any territory.|$|E

Put in irons in the hold, he was carried to Lima. During the passage, Don Benito did not visit him. Nor then, nor at any time after, would he look at him. Before the tribunal he refused. When pressed by the judges, he fainted. On {{the testimony of the}} sailors alone rested the legal identity of Babo.|$|E
25|$|In 212, Caracalla {{bestowed}} citizenship on all its residents, {{including the}} Jews. This granted Jews legal equality {{to all other}} citizens, and formed the foundation of their legal status in Byzantium following the founding of Constantinople in 330. Indeed, Jews enjoyed the right to practice their faith {{under the rule of}} the Byzantines, as long as they paid the Fiscus Judaicus. For example, circumcision, which was considered mutilation and therefore punishable by death if performed on a non-Jewish child, and by exile if performed on a non-Jewish adult, was legally permitted within Jewish religious practices. Byzantine law recognized synagogues as places of worship, which could not be arbitrarily molested, Jewish courts had the force of law in civil cases, and Jews could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> violate Shabbat and their festivals.|$|E

There he witnessed discrimination between European and Indian prisoners. He considered himself, along with others, {{to be a political}} prisoner. He noted that he had received an enhanced diet at Delhi which was not being provided at Mianwali. He led other Indian, self-identified political prisoners he felt were being treated as common criminals in a hunger strike. They demanded equality in food standards, clothing, toiletries, and other hygienic necessities, as well as access to books and a daily newspaper.

25|$|A key {{development}} {{in the ability to}} use APL effectively, before the widespread use of CRT terminals, was the development of a special IBM Selectric typewriter interchangeable typeball with all the special APL characters on it. This was used on paper printing terminal workstations using the Selectric typewriter and typeball mechanism, such as the IBM 1050 and IBM 2741 terminal. Keycaps could be placed over the normal keys to show which APL characters would be entered and typed when that key was struck. For the first time, a programmer could actually type in and see real APL characters as used in Iverson's notation and <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> use awkward English keyword representations of them. Falkoff and Iverson had the special APL Selectric typeballs, 987 and 988, designed in late 1964, although no APL computer system was available to use them. Iverson cited Falkoff as the inspiration for the idea of using an IBM Selectric typeball for the APL character set.|$|E
25|$|On August 18, 1970, the NAACP {{filed suit}} against Michigan state officials, {{including}} Governor William Milliken, charging de facto public school segregation. The NAACP argued that although schools were not legally segregated, the city of Detroit and its surrounding counties had enacted policies to maintain racial segregation in public schools. The NAACP also suggested a direct relationship between unfair housing practices and educational segregation, which followed segregated neighborhoods. The District Court held {{all levels of government}} accountable for the segregation in its ruling. The Sixth Circuit Court affirmed some of the decision, holding that it was the state's responsibility to integrate across the segregated metropolitan area. The U.S. Supreme Court took up the case February 27, 1974. The subsequent Milliken v. Bradley decision had wide national influence. In a narrow decision, the Court found that schools were a subject of local control and that suburbs could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> solve problems in the city's school district.|$|E
25|$|Australian faith {{communities}} {{vary widely}} in their official positions towards LGBT rights, including the legalisation of same-sex marriage. Sometimes, {{the position in}} many of the Abrahamic faiths – Christianity, Judaism and Islam – is to oppose LGBT rights such as same-sex marriage, but this is not uniform across all denominations or clergy, with a number of religious leaders speaking out in favour of LGBT rights. Churches would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> marry same-sex couples if it became legalised, but this does not change their stance on the matter. Australian Christian Lobby, formed in 1995, and the Catholic Australian Family Association, formed in 1980, strongly oppose same-sex rights such as adoption and marriage. However, the official positions of faiths are not necessarily shared by their membership, with a 2005 study finding that along with members of the Anglican and Uniting Churches, Australian Catholics were among the most supportive of LGBTI people and rights in Australia. Australia's peak Buddhist and Hindhu organisations have expressed support for LGBT rights such as same-sex marriage.|$|E

500|$|Trimmer's fundamentalism, Grenby argues, {{does not}} {{necessarily}} mark her as the rigid thinker that many critics have presumed her to be.

Fanny left England shortly afterwards, allegedly {{to avoid having to}} continue living with Hopley.|$|E
500|$|In 1974, Higginbotham issued his {{influential}} {{opinion in}} Comm. of Pa. v.

He held, in an opinion that was followed by later judges, including a series of Black judges who faced recusal requests, that a judge should <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> recuse solely because of their membership in a minority group.

500|$|On March 4, the {{day after}} his {{reinforcements}} arrived, Santa Anna proposed an assault on the Alamo. Many of his senior officers recommended that they wait for two 12-pounder cannons anticipated to arrive on March 7. That evening, a local woman, likely Bowie's cousin-in-law Juana Navarro Alsbury, approached Santa Anna to negotiate a surrender for the Alamo defenders. According to many historians, this visit probably increased Santa Anna's impatience; as historian Timothy Todish noted, [...] "there would have been little glory in a bloodless victory". The following morning, Santa Anna announced to his staff that the assault would take place early on March 6. [...] Santa Anna arranged for troops from Béxar to be excused from the front lines so that they would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> fight their own families.|$|E
500|$|The {{bishop and}} the noblemen {{regarded}} the Kolozsmonostor agreement {{as a temporary}} compromise.

They assembled at Kápolna and started negotiations with the counts of the Székelys and the delegates of the Saxon seats. This was the first occasion when {{the representatives of the}} noblemen, Székelys and Saxons held a joint assembly without the authorization of the monarch. They concluded a [...] "brotherly union" [...] against their enemies in early September, pledging to provide military assistance to each other against both internal and foreign aggressors. The bishop seems to have acknowledged that petty noblemen were exempt from paying the tithe, according to Demény, because the Diet of Hungary decreed that noblemen could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> pay the tithe in 1438.|$|E

The {{scene in which}} the celebrities start shaking and dancing, proclaiming [...] "Look, the sex addiction is leaving my body!", demonstrates the insincerity and ridiculousness of these public steps. The episode also mocked the measures used to diagnose and treat sexual addiction in the United States. This is particularly prevalent when Kenny, Kyle and Butters are misdiagnosed with sexual addiction based on an inaccurate test of simply presenting {{an image of a}} naked woman to them and testing whether they could identify a handkerchief in the woman's hand and specify its color. The rehabilitation courses themselves are also mocked as ineffective and unnecessary, particularly because the most important lesson taught in them is how to avoid getting caught.|$|E
