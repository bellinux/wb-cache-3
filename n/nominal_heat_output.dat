The low-temperature Bi 2 Te 3 generator based on thermoelectric modules {{has the potential to}} recover waste heat from gas combustion products as effective energy. The small-scale generator is constructed from independent segments. Measurements have shown that up to 11 W of electricity can be generated by one segment. Higher output power can be achieved by linking thermoelectric segments. The maximum output power is given by the dew point of the flue gas. The electrical energy that is generated can be used, e. g., for power supply or for charging batteries.

The estimated <b>heat</b> <b>output</b> is 460 ± 40 MW. Previous studies have estimated that the <b>heat</b> <b>outputs</b> from high-temperature hydrothermal discharge and low-temperature diffuse flow at the TAG hydrothermal mound are 90 ± 20 MW and at least 780 MW, respectively. Consequently, the contribution of diffuse flow to make the neutrally buoyant plume is 370 ± 60 MW, which accounts for approximately 80 % of the <b>heat</b> <b>output</b> to the neutrally buoyant plume. As this contribution is less than 50 % of the total <b>heat</b> <b>output</b> from the diffuse flow, {{it is likely that}} more than 50 % of the <b>heat</b> <b>output</b> from the diffuse flow dissipates in the ambient current.|$|R

The market leader is Robur, with ammonia-water absorption heat pumps available in air, water and ground source versions with <b>nominal</b> <b>heat</b> <b>output</b> around 40 kW. GUEs in the different versions are higher than competitors. Water at up to 70 degrees Celsius can be produced but the GUE under these conditions is generally not available.

They are single indoor units, large in size, and when in heat pumping mode cannot produce water hotter than 55 degrees C. They use solar heated water (Vaillant) or ground source heat, air source being unfeasible with water as a refrigerant.

40|$|AbstractThis study {{presents}} the experimental results on CO emissions and performance analysis obtained from two commercially available Belgian made modern wood stoves with capacity of 10 kW and 20 kW <b>nominal</b> <b>heat</b> <b>output.</b> Four batches in the 10 kW stove and six batches in the 20 kW stove were performed. The gaseous emissions of CO, CO 2 and O 2 were continuously measured during the combustion tests. The CO emissions during the startup phase were significant and about 4 {{times higher than}} combustion phase of the 10 kW stove and 3 {{times higher than the}} 20 kW stove. The total CO emissions from all the batches varied from 447 to 1185 mg/Nm 3 for the 10 kW stove and 958 to 1545 mg/Nm 3 for the 20 kW stove. The combustion efficiency obtained from all the batches was 79. 5 ± 0. 7  % for the 10 kW stove and 77. 1 ± 1. 2  % for the 20 kW stove. The results show that the total CO emissions from all batches of both stoves (with exception for the Batch 1 of 20 kW) satisfied the limit value of the NBN EN 13229 standard, while the combustion efficiency from both stoves satisfied the limit of the standard. The results of CO emissions and combustion efficiency from this study could be useful for the improvement of the combustion process to reduce emissions from these devices...|$|E
40|$|Wood-fired Combined Heat and Power (CHP) plants {{connected}} to District Heating (DH) networks can represent an {{efficient way to}} exploit biomass. Medium and small plants in rural areas can be supplied with local biomass and can contribute to increase the production of renewable energy in a sustainable way. In the last years, according to EU targets and thanks to the incentives provided on energy production from renewables, the number of biomass-fired CHP plants has continuously increased. In order to assess the behaviour and performance of a whole plant and of its various components it is essential to analyse operational data and parameters over the time. Real operation data can differ from nominal data because of their dependence on different parameters, i. e. biomass quality and moisture content, outdoor temperature, heat load, etc. The performance of each component has to be evaluated in order to assess the overall efficiency of the system and to find possible improvements. In this work the operational data of a wood fired CHP plant coupled to a DH network supplying users in a mountainous area are analysed. The DH system is supplied by two hot water boilers of total heat output of 8 MW and by a CHP system. The CHP system is made of a thermal oil boiler with <b>nominal</b> <b>heat</b> <b>output</b> of 6, 5 MW, an ORC unit with nominal electrical power 650 kW, a flue gas cleaning systems with a multicyclone and an electrofilter and two heat storage tanks. The DH network is about 20 km with almost 500 supplied users. The ORC unit is used at maximum power in the winter season, and at partial load in summer when the heat load mainly provides domestic hot water. The analyses performed over a whole heating season allowed to define operational patterns of the CHP unit with the overall DH operation. A good electric efficiency at partial loads has been assessed, accordingly to the data provided from the manufacturer. The heat provided by the ORC unit covered a significant share of the heat required from the users, thanks also to the presence of the heat storage systems. The correlation between relevant parameters that describe the behaviour of the system can be useful to analyse other CHP and DH systems with similar layout and operatio...|$|E
40|$|Klebsiella aerogenes {{has been}} grown in carbon-limited chemostats and the <b>heat</b> <b>output</b> of {{different}} steady states measured by pumping the culture through an LKB flow microcalorimeter. Initially the flow time between fermentor and microcalorimeter cell was 5 minutes {{during which time}} the steady-state conditions of the chemostat were disturbed and the measured <b>heat</b> <b>output</b> was less than that in the fermentor. To minimise this problem a specially designed fermentor was fitted into the airbath of the microcalorimeter, thus providing temperature control and reducing the flow time between fermentor and microcalorimeter to 1 minute. This design was adequate providing only one dilution rate was used in each experiment. If different dilution rates {{were used in the}} same experiment the fermentor contents could not be maintained at 37 C and inaccurate <b>heat</b> <b>outputs</b> were recorded. It is believed that with modifications this design may be used to accurately determine the energy changes occuring in chemostat cultures. K. aerogenes has been grown in batch culture in media limited by carbon or nitrogen. Characteristic heat output-time records were obtained for each medium. As growth proceeded the <b>heat</b> <b>output</b> increased steadily until oxygen became limiting whereupon the rate of <b>heat</b> <b>output</b> decreased.

40|$|In {{the present}} study two {{pozzolanic}} materials are used, Metakaolin (MK) and Fly Ash (PFA), as binary and ternary partial replacement binders with Portland cement (PC) to investigate their effect on {{the rate of heat}} evolution (dQ/dt in J/gh) during hydration, and the heat of hydration, (Q(t) in J/g). For binary PC–PFA blends PC hydration is enhanced in the very early stages of hydration, but at extended periods (up to 120 h) an increase in PFA replacement level causes a systematic reduction in <b>heat</b> <b>output.</b> For binary PC–MK blends the results suggest that the MK initially diminishes PC hydration but the subsequent pozzolanic reaction of MK increasingly contributes to the <b>heat</b> <b>output</b> causing some blends to exceed the <b>heat</b> <b>output</b> of the PC control. For both systems a principal controlling factor in the PC hydration rate (and the heat evolution rate) is the water requirement of the pozzolan, but for PC–MK blends the pozzolanic reaction of the MK makes a significant contribution to the <b>heat</b> <b>output.</b> However this reaction is controlled both by the availability of water and the supply of Ca 2 + ions from the hydrating PC which introduces an increasing level of complexity to the <b>heat</b> <b>output</b> versus time profiles.

The heat flow data from each of these drainage areas have been assessed making it possible to compare the <b>heat</b> <b>outputs</b> from two independent methods: direct heat measurements and the chloride flux method. For both the Waiotapu/Reporoa Valley drainage and the Waikite drainage a discrepancy exists between the two assessments, with the <b>heat</b> <b>output</b> observed at the surface (Waiotapu- 540 {+-} 110 MW; Waikite- 80 MW) nearly double of that calculated from the chloride flux (300 MW; 36 MW respectively).

40|$|The {{increase}} {{of renewable energy}} by combustion of biofuel will likely {{lead to an increase}} in the use of biofuels with high ash content. These fuels are more demanding from a combustion perspective. To facilitate combustion of these fuels in small combustion devices (50 kW – a few MW), there is a need of inexpensive dust cleaning devices. This is urgent to facilitate increased biofuel combustion without counteraction with the Swedish environmental goal Clean Air (which contain goals for particles in the air). Electrostatic filters for dust cleaning at heat and power plants are well established. However, the cost of these filters is often expensive to bear for a small plant. A few electrostatic filters for residential applications are available, but the experience is limited. In the capacity-area in between, i. e. small district heating plants, it is of special importance to find new cheap alternatives for an improved dust cleaning. The Norwegian company Applied Plasma Physics (APP) have products for dust- and odour-cleaning. APP also has the electrostatic filter called R_ESP (Residential Electrostatic Precipitator) for combustion of wood close to commercially available. The purpose of this report is to evaluate the electrostatic filter R_ESP at combustion of biofuels rich in ash, and by this contribute to increased knowledge about electrostatic precipitation at small-scale applications. A sub-goal is to separate 85 % of the particles in the flue gas. Experimental tests were performed at SP’s Energy laboratory. R_ESP was mounted downstream of a chimney, which was mounted on a multi-stoker/boiler. The multi-stoker has a <b>nominal</b> <b>heat</b> <b>output</b> of 65 kW at combustion of wood pellets. In this project pellets of bark or reed canary grass were fired. Dust separation efficiency over the R_ESP with respect to number concentration and size distribution was tested for several powers of the filter, during combustion of the two fuels. Combustion of bark was selected for a longer time test with respect to separation efficiency by particle mass. Number concentration and size distribution were measured in real time using an electrical low pressure impactor (ELPI) and mass concentration was measured by filter sampling. The combustion conditions were favourable, with low concentrations of hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide. The number concentration of particles was 2. 5 · 107 #/cmN 3 and 1. 9 · #/cmN 3 (normalised to 10 % O 2) at combustion of reed canary grass and bark respectively. The results show that the technique of R_ESP works well for cleaning of particles from efficient combustion of the ash-rich fuels reed canary grass and bark. The combustion device was run at 20 kW, which is a thermal output that may be present at a farm or a school. For such an application the existing R_ESP may be tested in field, but for larger plants a certain product development is needed. The objective to separate 85 % of the particles was reached at normal operation of the filter (60 W). Lowering the effect of the filter, {{a large part of the}} dust separation is maintained and at 20 W the separation was about 80 %. At combustion of bark a two-day test of dust separation with respect to mass was performed. It showed on a dust separation efficiency of 82 % at 30 W power of the electrostatic filter...|$|E

The results show that all methods at least slightly differ from each other, indicating that each one reflects only a part of the microbial life in the soil. Due to limited nutrient supply {{the main part of the}} soil microflora is dormant, but can be activated by addition of an anergy source.
