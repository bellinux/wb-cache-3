5|$|English naval {{power was}} vital to Edward I's {{successful}} campaigns in Scotland from 1296, using largely merchant ships from England, Ireland {{and his allies}} in the Islands to transport and supply his armies. Part {{of the reason for}} Robert I's success was his ability to call on <b>naval</b> <b>forces</b> from the Islands. As a result of the expulsion of the Flemings from England in 1303, he gained the support of a major naval power in the North Sea. The development of naval power allowed Robert to successfully defeat English attempts to capture him in the Highlands and Islands and to blockade major English controlled fortresses at Perth and Stirling, the last forcing Edward II to attempt the relief that resulted at English defeat at Bannockburn in 1314. Scottish <b>naval</b> <b>forces</b> allowed invasions of the Isle of Man in 1313 and 1317 and Ireland in 1315. They were also crucial in the blockade of Berwick, which led to its fall in 1318.|$|E
