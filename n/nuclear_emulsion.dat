500|$|When Burhop {{took charge}} of the Bubble Chamber Group at University College in 1967, he was quick to grasp the {{advantages}} of heavy liquid bubble chambers for studying neutrino interactions, and steered the group towards participation in joint European ventures, using the Gargamelle. The group's discovery of neutral currents in 1973 was a milestone {{on the road to the}} theoretical unification of electromagnetism with the weak force. [...] In 1974 and 1975, with the help of Robert R. Wilson, the director of the Fermilab in the United States, an international team from Fermilab and seven European laboratories under Burhop's leadership carried out a search for a new particle, the existence of which Burhop had predicted in 1963. He had suggested that neutrino interactions could create short-lived (perhaps as low as 10−14 s) particles that could be detected with the use of <b>nuclear</b> <b>emulsion.</b> Experiment E247 at Fermilab successfully detected particles with a lifetime of the order of 10−13 s. A follow-up experiment WA17 with the SPS confirmed the existence of the [...] (charmed lambda baryon), with a flight time of 7.3±0.1 x 10−13s.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1960s the Goldhabers {{realized}} that they should begin using the bubble chamber to continue their studies instead of <b>nuclear</b> <b>emulsion</b> so they formed the [...] "Goldhaber-Trilling Group" [...] with George Trilling. Goldhaber quickly became a renowned expert in hydrogen bubble chamber physics, accruing a lengthy list of invited papers and conference talks. [...] The Goldhabers {{were the first to}} measure the spin of the K* meson and the first to study the simultaneous production of pairs of resonant states. They also invented the triangle diagram to aid in their research.|$|E

30|$|Several {{detector}} technologies were considered. Among them plastic scintillators, <b>nuclear</b> <b>emulsions</b> and Resistive Plate Chambers (RPC) {{were carefully}} reviewed. In {{the case of}} <b>nuclear</b> <b>emulsions,</b> although they offer a very high resolution and have no need for electrical power, they do not allow real-time data acquisition and transfer to laboratories for data analysis. In the case of RPCs, the sensitivity to temperature, {{the need for a}} gas mixture to be kept carefully under control as well as the large high voltage required would be inconvenient for operation outside of a laboratory. Therefore, both <b>nuclear</b> <b>emulsions</b> and RPCs were discarded since they do not fulfill all the experimental requirements of the MU-RAY project.|$|R
2500|$|In 2017, {{scientists}} from the Scan Pyramids Project discovered a large cavity above the Grand Gallery, using muon radiography that can detect cosmic rays.

It was detected using three different technologies: <b>nuclear</b> <b>emulsion</b> films, scintillator hodoscopes, and gas detectors. The purpose of the cavity is not known and it is not accessible but according to Zahi Hawass it may have been a gap used in the construction of the Grand Gallery. The Japanese research team disputes this, however, saying that the huge void is completely different from the construction spaces previously identified.|$|E

40|$|The high {{pressures}} and current densities associated with MG fields limit their useful lifetime to 1 psec or less. The pulse {{duration of the}} SLAC electron beam being of the same order of magnitude, a successful marriage of the two techniques was achieved in experiments that use transverse fields in the range 1 to 2 MG as targets for a 19 GeV electron beam. The fields were generated in volumes of dia. 3 to 5 mm by discharging a very fast capacitor bank into small single turn coils, or by flux compression with electromagnetically driven aluminum foils. The termination of the capacitor bank, designed to minimize the destructive effects of the exploding coils, permitted a repetition rate of one shot per hour. Magnetic bremsstrahlung emitted by the electrons was recorded on X-ray film and <b>nuclear</b> <b>emulsions.</b> In an additional experiment, <b>nuclear</b> <b>emulsions</b> mounted in the high field region survived the violent self-destruction of the coils.
