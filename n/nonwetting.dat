Heifers were subjected to 3 days of thermoneutral conditions followed by 3 days of hot conditions accompanied by water sprinkling between 1300 and 1500 h (HOT 1 - 3). Then on the following 2 days (HOT 4 - 5), environmental conditions remained similar, but 3 heifers were sprinkled between 1200 and 1600 h (WET) and 3 were not sprinkled (<b>NONWET).</b> This was followed by a 1 -day period (HOT 6) in which environmental conditions and sprinkling regimen were similar to HOT 1 - 3. Rectal temperature (RT) was collected hourly, and respiration rate (RR) was monitored every 2 h on HOT Days 2, 4, 5, and 6. Dry matter intake and rate of eating were also determined. Sprinkling reduced RR and RT (P < 0. 01) of all heifers during HOT 1 - 3. During HOT 4 - 5, WET heifers had lower (P < 0. 05) RT than <b>NONWET</b> from 1300 to 700 h and lower RR from 1400 to 2000 h. Dry matter intake of <b>NONWET</b> heifers was reduced by 30. 6 % (P < 0. 05) during HOT 4 - 5 and by 51. 2 % on HOT 6. On HOT 4 - 5 the dry matter intakes of WET heifers were similar to intakes under thermoneutral conditions. During HOT 6, RT was again reduced following sprinkling in all heifers. Comparison of RT and RR of <b>NONWET</b> and WET heifers on HOT 1 - 3 v. HOT 6 revealed that under similar environmental conditions, <b>NONWET</b> heifers had increased RT, partially due to carry-over from HOT 4 - 5. However, <b>NONWET</b> heifers had 40 % lower feed intake but tended to have lower RR on HOT 6 v. HOT 1 - 3.

40|$|Investigation of helium on rubidium, {{sodium and}} {{potassium}} surfaces followed the cesium studies. My own involvement in wetting experiments {{was triggered by}} the results of an experiment conducted by Wyatt and Klier. In their experiment the helium-rubidium system seemed to exhibit <b>nonwet</b> behavior below 300 mK. The very thin film of adsorbed helium on <b>nonwet</b> rubidium seemed to behave like a submonolayer superfluid. From it was born the idea that we could explore superfluidity in the thin film of helium atop rubidium by conducting an experiment which attempts to propagate a tidal-like wave (third sound) along the film. ^ The basic idea behind the experiment is that third sound can only propagate in films which are superfluid. Therefore, if the thin film of helium on rubidium is superfluid, we can expect to propagate third sound through it. We designed an experiment to examine third sound that propagates across a rubidium substrate. We were able to use the third sound reflection off of the rubidium boundary as a diagnostic to determine when the rubidium was wet (or prewet) by helium and when it was not wet by helium. We produced a rubidium substrate that could be caused to make a transition from being <b>nonwet</b> by helium to being wet by helium. Third sound propagated across the rubidium. We therefore have obtained strong evidence to support the idea that helium in the thin film state on rubidium can behave like a superfluid. We also observed strong evidence that, very close to saturation, the rubidium was always wet by helium to temperatures as low as 150 mK. On a second rubidium surface, the rubidium was always in the wet state, evidence that it is extremely difficult to fabricate rubidium surfaces of reproducible quality. ^ In this document, we present the results of our third sound experiments on rubidium and explain how we have drawn conclusions about the wetting behavior of helium on rubidium. In addition, a chapter is devoted to some of the low temperature third sound data on glass. (Abstract shortened by UMI.) ...|$|R

50|$|Some {{atmospheric}} {{effects on the}} functionality of adhesive devices can be characterized by following the theory of surface energy and interfacial tension. It is known that γ12 = (1/2)W121 = (1/2)W212. If γ12 is high, then each species finds it favorable to cohere while in contact with a foreign species, rather than dissociate and mix with the other. If this is true, then it follows that when the interfacial tension is high, the force of adhesion is weak, since each species does not find it favorable to bond to the other. The interfacial tension of a liquid and a solid {{is directly related to}} the liquids wettability (relative to the solid), and thus one can extrapolate that cohesion increases in non-wetting liquids and decreases in wetting liquids. One example that verifies this is polydimethyl siloxane rubber, which has a work of self-adhesion of 43.6 mJ/m2 in air, 74 mJ/m2 in water (a <b>nonwetting</b> liquid) and 6 mJ/m2 in methanol (a wetting liquid).|$|E

40|$|The {{mobilization}} of the trapped residual oil {{is an important}} part of Enhanced Oil Recovery. The desaturation of <b>nonwetting</b> fluids from porous media is often described using capillary numbers which are a ratio of viscous forces over the capillary forces between the wetting and the <b>nonwetting</b> fluids. Twodimensional microfluidic devices (micromodels) play an important role as they allow for the visualization of the two phase flow in porous media. Even though the existing definitions for capillary numbers work fine for describing the {{mobilization of}} the trapped <b>nonwetting</b> phase in geological rock, problems arise when applying these definitions for capillary numbers on micromodels. The conventional definition of the capillary numbers do not allow to visualize the desaturation of <b>nonwetting</b> phases in different micromodels on a single trend. This research presents the derivation of a new definition of a capillary number that can be used to better analyze the mobilization of trapped <b>nonwetting</b> ganglions inside micromodels. The new capillary number is based on a force balance on a trapped ganglion and the corresponding mobilization criteria of the trapped <b>nonwetting</b> phase. The new definition of the capillary number consists of the conventional definition of the capillary number and a geometric term that accounts for the geometry of the micromodel, including the sizes of the pore bodies and throats as well as the ganglion length. The functionality of similar definitions of the capillary number for roughened fractures has previously been published by Al Quaimi and Rossen (2017). The functionally of the new capillary number has been tested by analyzing published desaturation data for various micromodels, each using different wetting and <b>nonwetting</b> phase combinations using both the conventional and the new definition of the capillary number. It is found that the new definition allows for better analysis of the mobilization of the trapped <b>nonwetting</b> fluid inside micromodels, as the desaturation curves for different models can now be visualized by a single trend.

40|$|Abstract. In {{many studies}} {{involving}} a liquid and air, the effective permeability of the wetting phase (kw) is determined from the capillary pressure (Pc) –saturation (S) relation and a corresponding, measured kw value. The movement, {{and therefore the}} effective permeability, knw, of air in an air-liquid system is often ignored, especially by those who consider only {{the flow of water}} in soils. However, if a wetting and a <b>nonwetting</b> liquid coexist (two immiscible liquids), the effective permeability function of the <b>nonwetting</b> liquid must be determined as well. Rather than using some indirect method to determine the knw(Pc) or knw(S) relationship of the <b>nonwetting</b> liquid, we propose a direct measurement technique by using a permeameter which allows for steady state flow of the <b>nonwetting</b> liquid over a range of Pc and S values. During each steady state flow condition of the <b>nonwetting</b> liquid, Pc and S are constant and uniform throughout the permeameter, while the wetting liquid is at rest. The <b>nonwetting</b> liquid can either be a dense non–aqueous phase liquid (DNAPL) or a light non–aqueous phase liquid (LNAPL). The knw values are calculated as a function of Pc and S from the measured flow rates and the density difference between the wetting and <b>nonwetting</b> liquid. The proposed technique can be applied during drainage as well as imbibition. The S values are determined by recording the amount of water being displaced from the cell each time the Pc is changed.

The <b>nonwetting</b> tendency of the films is explained based on the interactions of the dipole moments of polar water molecules and BN nanosheets. (C) 2012 Acta Materialia Inc.

40|$|Wetting {{phenomena}} are {{ubiquitous in}} nature and technology. A solid substrate exposed to the environment is almost invariably covered by a layer of fluid material. In this review, the surface forces that lead to wetting are considered, and the equilibrium surface coverage of a substrate in contact with a drop of liquid. Depending {{on the nature of}} the surface forces involved, different scenarios for wetting phase transitions are possible; recent progress allows us to relate the critical exponents directly to the nature of the surface forces which lead to the different wetting scenarios. Thermal fluctuation effects, which can be greatly enhanced for wetting of geometrically or chemically structured substrates, and are much stronger in colloidal suspensions, modify the adsorption singularities. Macroscopic descriptions and microscopic theories have been developed to understand and predict wetting behavior relevant to microfluidics and nanofluidics applications. Then the dynamics of wetting is examined. A drop, placed on a substrate which it wets, spreads out to form a film. Conversely, a <b>nonwetted</b> substrate previously covered by a film dewets upon an appropriate change of system parameters. The hydrodynamics of both wetting and dewetting is influenced by the presence of the three-phase contact line separating "wet" regions from those that are either dry or covered by a microscopic film only. Recent theoretical, experimental, and numerical progress in the description of moving contact line dynamics are reviewed, and its relation to the thermodynamics of wetting is explored. In addition, recent progress on rough surfaces is surveyed. The anchoring of contact lines and contact angle hysteresis are explored resulting from surface inhomogeneities. Further, new ways to mold wetting characteristics according to technological constraints are discussed, for example, the use of patterned surfaces, surfactants, or complex fluids. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Infrared video {{thermography}} {{was used}} to observe ice nucleation temperatures, patterns of ice formation, and freezing rates in nonacclimated and cold acclimated leaves of a spring (cv Quest) and a winter (cv Express) canola (Brassica napus). Distinctly different freezing patterns were observed, {{and the effect of}} water content, sugars, and soluble proteins on the freezing process was characterized. When freezing was initiated at a warm subzero temperature, ice growth rapidly spread throughout nonacclimated leaves. In contrast, acclimated leaves initiated freezing in a horseshoe pattern beginning at the uppermost edge followed by a slow progression of ice formation across the leaf. However, when acclimated leaves, either previously killed by a slow freeze (2 °C h− 1) or by direct submersion in liquid nitrogen, were refrozen their freezing pattern was similar to nonacclimated leaves. A novel technique was developed using filter paper strips {{to determine the effects of}} both sugars and proteins on the rate of freezing of cell extracts. Cell sap from nonacclimated leaves froze 3 -fold faster than extracts from acclimated leaves. The rate of freezing in leaves was strongly dependent upon the osmotic potential of the leaves. Simple sugars had a much greater effect on freezing rate than proteins. Nonacclimated leaves containing high water content did not supercool as much as acclimated leaves. Additionally, wetted leaves did not supercool as much as <b>nonwetted</b> leaves. As expected, cell solutes depressed the nucleation temperature of leaves. The use of infrared thermography has revealed that the freezing process in plants is a complex process, reminding us that many aspects of freezing tolerance occur at a whole plant level involving aspects of plant structure and metabolites rather than just the expression of specific genes alone...|$|R
40|$| {{following}} {{input parameters}} {{are required to}} run the FAO-type crop factor model: planting date, latitude, altitude, maximum and minimum daily air temperatures, FAO crop factors and duration of crop stages. The input data required to run the two-dimensional cascading model are rainfall and irrigation amounts, volumetric soil water content at field capacity and permanent wilting point, as well as initial volumetric soil water content for each soil layer. Row spacing, wetted diameter, distance between micro-irrigators or drippers and the fraction of roots in the wetted volume of soil are also required. Required input data for yield prediction with the FAO model are FAO stress factors for growing stages and potential yield. Field Trial Evaluation of the model was carried out {{for a wide range}} of conditions (row orientation, period of the year and canopy density). For this purpose, two field trials were set up. The first trial was established in a peach (Prunus persica cv Transvaalia) orchard on the lysimeter facilities at Hatfield (Pretoria University experimental farm). This provided a site where detailed observations could be easily recorded to evaluate the SWB model for deciduous trees. The second trial was established in a citrus clementine (Citrus reticulate cv. Nules Clementine) orchard at the Syferkuil experimental farm of the University of the North. This was the site where measured data were collected to evaluate the SWB model for evergreen trees. In both field trials, the following field measurements were carried out and used to evaluate the two-dimensional energy interception and soil water balance model: i) Weather measurements (temperature and relative humidity, wind speed, solar radiation and rainfall). ii) Soil texture, bulk density, penetrometer resistance. iii) Volumetric soil water content with neutron water meter and time domain reflectometry (TDR). iv) Soil matrix potential with heat dissipation sensors. v) Root distribution by taking soil core samples and washing out roots to determine root length. vi) Soil irradiance at different distances from the tree row with tube solarimeters. v) Leaf area index and density with a LAI- 2000 plant canopy analyser. vi) Canopy size and row orientation. In addition, load cell lysimeters were used in the peach orchard at Hatfield in order to measure crop water use. An additional field trial was carried out at the Hatfield experimental station on Leuceaena (Leucaena leucocephela) trees in order to test the two-dimensional radiant interception model for different environmental conditions (tree size and shape as well as row orientation). For the same purpose, two other trials were carried out on two commercial orchards at Brits in Empress Mandarin (Citrus reticulate cv. Empress) and Delta Valencia (Citrus sinensis [L. ] cv. Osbeck) orchards. In these field trials, weather data were recorded, soil irradiance across the row was measured with tube solarimeters, as well as leaf area index and density, canopy size and row orientation. Results The simple, quasi two-dimensional, cascading soil water balance model was calibrated using data from the peach trial at the Hatfield experimental station. In the process, FAO basal crop coefficients (Kcb) were determined for first and second leaf peach trees. The daily crop factor (Kc) was calculated using evapotranspiration measurements from the lysimeters and the grass reference evapotranspiration calculated from weather data. The Kcb values for the various growth stages were determined by fitting an appropriate line through the lower values of Kc, which were taken to reflect the condition where the soil surface was dry (negligible evaporation), subsoil drainage was negligible and there was sufficient water not to restrict transpiration. There was good agreement between predicted and measured daily soil water deficit for water stressed and non-stressed treatments. This was expected since the calibration data came from the trial. Field measurements in Hatfield also indicated that in hedgerow plantings the whole area across the row must be borne in mind when assessing soil water content. The practice of using single or restricted locality measurements, as utilised in agronomic crops, can be misleading in orchards. The reason for this is the effect of the irrigation distribution and rain interception by the canopy, the variation in radiation interception by the canopy across the row, the irradiance reaching the soil surface as the season progresses, the presence of a grass sod or bare soil in the inter-row region and the root density across the row. In both field trials at Hatfield and Syferkuil, it was found that there are significant amounts of roots in the inter-row region and thus this portion of the rooting volume must not be disregarded when assessing the water balance. The two-dimensional energy interception and soil evaporation components were evaluated separately. The crucial interactions between the model components were integrated in the validation of the two-dimensional soil water balance model, which uses the energy interception and soil evaporation sub-models to split evaporation and transpiration. The radiant interception model predictions and the tube solarimeter measured soil irradiance generally gave very good agreement at different distances from the tree row and in different orchards. However, some discrepancies between measurements and model predictions occurred. This was attributed to the presence of trunks and branches shading the tube solarimeters at low leaf area densities, irregularities in the shape of the hedgerow, and nonuniform distribution of leaves within the canopy. In one case the canopy shape differed drastically from that used in the model. The output obtained with the two-dimensional soil water balance model was compared to independent field measurements in order to evaluate the full SWB two-dimensional model. Volumetric soil water content data collected with the TDR system in the peach and citrus orchards were compared to SWB simulations. Results of model simulations done during drying cycles showed that the surface layer predictions were generally very good. However, in certain situations discrepancies between measurements and simulations were observed, in particular, for deeper soil layers. This could have been due to spatial variability of soil properties, as well as soil disturbance during the installation of TDR probes. It is clear that TDR probes can be used in irrigation scheduling to determine crop water use over certain periods. Caution should, however, be exercised in the interpretation of absolute values of volumetric soil water content obtained from the probes. Scenario modelling and sensitivity analyses were carried out by varying some input parameters and observing variations in certain output variables. The aim was to show an application of this tool to identify the most suitable management practice in order to maximise water use efficiency. Two case studies were considered for two “virtual” orchards located at different latitudes and in different climates (Kakamas in the Northern Cape and Stellenbosch in the Western Cape). The results of the scenario simulations indicated that, based on the inputs used, the orchards should be planted in a N-S row orientation, a wetted diameter of 0. 5 m should be applied when the canopy width is 2 m, in order to minimize water losses through evaporation. As the canopy width increased to 3 m, so the wetted diameter should be increased to 1. 5 m. If the wetted diameter is too small, transpiration and thus yield will be reduced. A sensitivity analysis was also carried out for both case studies varying the fraction of roots in the wetted volume of soil, and observing variations in the output results of evaporation and transpiration. The contribution to crop water uptake from the inter-row volume of soil can be high, in particular under high atmospheric evaporative demand, and this needs to be accounted for in irrigation management in order to maximise rainfall use efficiency in areas of higher summer rainfall. Conclusions and recommendations The methodologies developed to measure the temporal and spatial variation in solar radiation and thus the energy distribution within Hedgerow orchards worked well. The methods used to measure the temporal and spatial variation of the soil water balance also worked well. Thus a very good data set was generated that enabled the sound evaluation of the 2 -D SWB model. Thus one can conclude that the two-dimensional energy interception and soil water balance model that was developed in the overall research thrust and included in the Soil Water Balance irrigation scheduling model worked well. The simpler model, based on the FAO crop factor approach and a cascading soil water balance, that was also developed to enable users to predict crop water requirements with a limited set of input data, also gave very satisfactory results. The FAO-based model and the cascading soil water balance were calibrated for first leaf and second leaf peaches at Hatfield. The two-dimensional model was fully evaluated for deciduous orchards using data obtained in field trials on peaches and Leucaena (Hatfield). For model validation in evergreen citrus orchards, data obtained in field trials set up at the Syferkuil experimental station (University of the North) and on two commercial farms in Brits were used. Irregular trunks and branches could cause inaccuracies in predictions of the energy balance. At low leaf area densities, the shade from trunks and branches is not accounted for in the SWB model. The relative importance of non-symmetric canopy shape as opposed to nonuniform leaf distribution did have an effect but indications where that this was not critical. The major difficulties encountered in the evaluation of the soil water balance were due to spatial variability of soil properties and disturbance of the soil when the water status monitoring sensors were installed. Careful installation is therefore recommended when using sensors that give localised measurements like those used in this study (heat dissipation sensors and TDR probes). The successful evaluation of the two-dimensional energy interception and soil water balance model opens the opportunity to develop a useful yield predictor and productivity efficiency measure if one knows the canopy to fruit ratio. This information could also be useful for fruit colour and internal quality research. As demonstrated with data from the peach trial at Hatfield, soil or cover crops between rows can also have a large effect on the efficient use of rainfall, and this could be further investigated. The biggest contribution of this model is likely to be the quantification of the contribution that rainfall can make to crop water use by taking the non-irrigated inter-row soil reservoir into account. It is recommended to accurately estimate the root fraction in the wetted and <b>nonwetted</b> volume of soil by digging a trench across the row, taking core soil samples and determining root densities. The two-dimensional energy interception and finite difference soil water balance model is expected to be more accurate than the cascading soil water balance, due to the sound physical principles on which it is based. The mechanistic detailed approach could give guidance with respect to the magnitude of errors made by using simpler, more empirical approaches. However, the two-dimensional model will also require more input parameters compared to the simpler cascading model. In particular, the most difficult parameters to determine will be the leaf area density for the radiation energy interception part due to the cost of the instrumentation, and the hydraulic conductivity for the soil part due to the specialised knowledge and scientific equipm...|$|R
