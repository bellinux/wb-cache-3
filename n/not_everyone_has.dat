Army forces cover the army members for all infertility investigations and treatments. It also covers three trials of IVF in primary infertility cases. Some {{health insurance companies}} cover the diagnosis and the treatment of infertility for those with government health insurance, {{but it will not}} cover any of the assisted reproductive techniques. In private sector, there are many centers offering private treatment for infertility including the assisted reproductive techniques.|$|E

I just love supermodels, I love sunshine, and I love sports cars. And this time we also added a speedboat. So you got the four S's in there." [...] In an interview with Rap-Up, when talking about the video portraying him as a heartbreaker, Cruz said [...] "No, not really. I suppose maybe 20%. It was more of just playing a character and having fun, just going out there and making a real cool, fun, cocky video. <b>Not</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>has</b> seen the whole plot of the video, but it's actually myself and my girlfriend both going out with the intention of breaking everyone's hearts." ...|$|E

500|$|Gilchrist's {{actions have}} sparked debate amongst {{current and former}} players and umpires. Ricky Ponting has {{declared}} on several occasions {{that he is not}} a walker but will leave it to each player to decide whether they wish to walk or not. While no other Australian top order batsmen have expressly declared themselves to be walkers, lower-order batsmen Jason Gillespie and Michael Kasprowicz both walked during Test matches in India in 2004. In 2004, New Zealand captain Stephen Fleming accused Gilchrist of conducting a [...] "walking crusade" [...] when Craig McMillan refused to walk after Gilchrist had caught him off an edge from the bowling of Jason Gillespie in the First Test in Brisbane. After the appeal was turned down by the umpire, who did not hear the edge, Gilchrist goaded McMillan about the edge, and McMillan's angry response was picked up by the stump microphone: [...] "...not everyone is walking, Gilly ... <b>not</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>has</b> to walk, mate...". The taunt was effective, however, as McMillan, perhaps distracted, missed the next ball and was given out leg before wicket. Gilchrist said in his autobiography that he had [...] "zero support in the team" [...] for his stance and that he felt that the topic made the dressing room uncomfortable. He added that he [...] "felt isolated" [...] and [...] "silently accused of betraying the team. Implictly I was made to feel selfish, as if I was walking for the sake of my own clean image, thereby making everyone else look dishonest." ...|$|E
2500|$|Confucius did {{not believe}} in the concept of [...] "democracy", which is itself an Athenian concept unknown in ancient China, but could be {{interpreted}} by Confucius's principles recommending against individuals electing their own political leaders to govern them, or that anyone is capable of self-government. He expressed fears that the masses lacked the intellect to make decisions for themselves, and that, in his view, since not everyone is created equal, <b>not</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>has</b> a right of self-government.|$|E

Her helicopters {{also played a role}} in securing the city of Basra. When interviewed about the experience Clayton said; [...] "There's [...] a sense of pride in a job really well done.

But also we have to remember that we're the lucky ones coming back. <b>Not</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>has.</b> There are many we have to think about, including one of our ship's company who was killed in action, Marine Chris Maddison. Our thoughts will be about him and with his family." ...|$|E

50|$|Pei Hwa Public School along Yio Chu Kang Road {{was founded}} in 1934 as Hwa Keow School by Mr Ang Gong Pin, who felt {{a need for a}} school in {{proximity}} to their villages because most schools were located in the cities and <b>not</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>had</b> the means {{to send their children to}} and from the city. Pei Hwa Public School started as a small village school with 17 classrooms and a dormitory for the principal and teachers.|$|R

In 1978 it tied for third at the ninth North American Computer Chess Championship despite being seeded ninth of 12 entries. Sargon finished only behind Belle and Chess 4.7, and defeated AWIT—running on a $5 million Amdahl mainframe—amazing the audience. That year they published {{a series of articles}} in BYTE on computer chess programming, stating [...] "we think {{it would be nice if}} <b>not</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>had</b> to reinvent the wheel".|$|R
2500|$|<b>Not</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>has</b> {{embraced the}} Sport Bowling concept. PBA Hall of Famer Johnny Petraglia argues that Sport Bowling combats changes in bowling balls simply {{by making it}} tougher to roll a shot into the [...] "pocket" [...] (the 1–3 pins for a right-hander, 1–2 pins for a left-hander). According to Petraglia, Sport Bowling is merely an attempt to [...] "create the scores that were shot 30 years ago. The problem is, 30 years ago the game wasn't tougher. You could hit the pocket as easily as you do now, but you couldn't knock over the same [...] of pins with a rubber bowling ball. Sport bowling is, for the first time, {{intentionally}} {{trying to make the}} lanes tough." [...] Petraglia's suggestion to combat high-tech bowling balls is to use heavier pins that are single-voided on the bottom (versus double-voided), making them less top-heavy.|$|E
2500|$|Mauss and his collaborator, Henri Hubert, were criticised {{for this}} {{position}} when their 1904 Outline of a General Theory of Magic was published. [...] "No one questioned {{the existence of}} the notion of mana", wrote Mauss's biographer Marcel Fournier, [...] "but Hubert and Mauss were criticized for giving it a universal dimension". Criticism of mana as an archetype of life energy increased. According to Mircea Eliade, the idea of mana is not universal; in places where it is believed, <b>not</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>has</b> it, and [...] "even among the varying formulae (mana, wakan, orenda, etc.) there are, if not glaring differences, certainly nuances not sufficiently observed in the early studies". [...] "With regard to these theories founded upon the primordial and universal character of mana, we must say without delay that they have been invalidated by later research".|$|E
2500|$|Nicknames (t, s, chuòhào, or , wàihào) are {{acquired}} in China {{in much the}} same way they are in other countries. <b>Not</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>has</b> one. Most that do received theirs in childhood or adolescence from family or friends. Common Chinese nicknames are those based on a person's physical attributes, speaking style, or behavior. Names involving animals are common, although those animals may be associated with different attributes than they are in English: for example, Chinese cows are strong, not stupid; foxes are devious, not clever; pigs are ugly, lazy, stupid, or content, but not dirty. Similarly, nicknames that might seem especially insulting in English—such as [...] "Little Fatty" [...] (...) —are more acceptable in Chinese. One especially common method of creating nicknames is prefixing Ā- (...) or Xiǎo (...) to the surname or the second character of the given name. Ā- is more common in southern China and abroad, while Xiǎo is common throughout China. Both Ā- and Xiǎo are distinguished from Lǎo ( [...] , [...] "old" [...] but see below for usage). Nicknames are rarely used in formal or semi-formal settings, although a famous exception is A-bian.|$|E

50|$|Many film {{historians have}} remarked upon the many {{great works of}} cinema that emerged from this period of highly regimented film-making. One reason this was {{possible}} is that, with so many movies being made, <b>not</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>had</b> {{to be a big}} hit. A studio could gamble on a medium-budget feature with a good script and relatively unknown actors: Citizen Kane, directed by Orson Welles (1915-1985) and often regarded as the greatest film of all time, fits that description. In other cases, strong-willed directors like Howard Hawks (1896-1977), Alfred Hitchcock (1899-1980), and Frank Capra (1897-1991) battled the studios in order to achieve their artistic visions.|$|R

50|$|Etruscan beliefs {{concerning}} the hereafter {{appear to be}} an amalgam of influences. The Etruscans shared general early Mediterranean beliefs, such as the Egyptian belief that survival and prosperity in the hereafter depend on the treatment of the deceased's remains. Etruscan tombs imitated domestic structures and were characterized by spacious chambers, wall paintings and grave furniture. In the tomb, especially on the sarcophagus (examples shown below), was a representation of the deceased in his or her prime, often with a spouse. <b>Not</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>had</b> a sarcophagus; sometimes the deceased was laid out on a stone bench. As the Etruscans practiced mixed inhumation and cremation rites (the proportion depending on the period), cremated ashes and bones might be put into an urn in the shapes of a house or a representation of the deceased.|$|R

However, the terms PTS and PTE are used interchangeably in medical literature.

50|$|Belonging is {{a strong}} and {{inevitable}} feeling that exists in human nature. To belong or not to belong can occur due to choices of one's self, or the choices of others. <b>Not</b> <b>everyone</b> <b>has</b> the same life and interests, hence not everyone belongs {{to the same thing}} or person. Without belonging, one cannot identify themselves as clearly, thus having difficulties communicating with and relating to their surroundings.|$|E
