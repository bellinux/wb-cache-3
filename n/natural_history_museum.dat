The purpose of this research {{study was to examine the}} standards of care for education collections at <b>natural</b> <b>history</b> <b>museums.</b> Using a descriptive case study approach, twelve museum professionals representing four large <b>natural</b> <b>history</b> <b>museums</b> were interviewed. Study results suggest that, while education collections are considered consumable collections, museums enact various levels of care to prolong the usefulness of these specimens and objects, including repair and preventative maintenance. Further, institutions critically consider what it means for objects to be a part of the education collection, in terms of possible damage to the object and potential benefits to learning in the museum. These results will provide a critical lens for museum professionals who use or care for education collections...|$|R
