The system incorporates a Pu-Be radionuclide neutron source within a graphite neutron collimator assembly.

5000|$|Transmission Raman {{lends itself}} to rapid, {{non-invasive}} and <b>non-destructive</b> <b>analysis</b> of pharmaceutical dosage forms such as capsules and tablets. This addresses several limitations of traditional pharmaceutical assay techniques including limitations due to surface sensitivity (e.g., reflectance NIR), the presence of phase changes due to sample preparation (liquid chromatography) or sub-sampling (conventional Raman, NIR). [...] Transmission Raman is largely insensitive to surface, requires no sample preparation, involves no phase change and is rapid. Transmission Raman spectroscopy of pharmaceutical tablets and capsules was first demonstrated by Matousek and Parker. [...] Subsequent research established the technique’s accuracy and applicability to quantifying tablet and production-style capsule formulations.|$|E
50|$|Radiography is a <b>non-destructive</b> <b>analysis</b> of the {{internal}} structure of an object, that uses x-rays to create an image. For paintings this means that conservators can potentially see the inner structure of the painting and learn about the materials and techniques used by the original artist. Radiography {{can also be used}} on archaeological objects or sculptures to learn more about {{the internal}} structure of the items that would otherwise be invisible without destroying the object. This type of imaging produces a two-dimensional image of the inner workings of the item. X-ray technology has been used to read the damaged Herculaneum Papyri as opposed to trying to unroll the scroll to read its contents. As part of a conservation measure on the Ghent Altarpiece x-rays were created to better understand how the piece was painted and put together. Images from that project can be viewed on the Closer to Van Eyck website. On the Penn Museum's Artifact Lab blog there are multiple entries discussing the applications of radiography on cultural heritage.|$|E
50|$|Relative {{to other}} methods of analysis, powder {{diffraction}} allows for rapid, <b>non-destructive</b> <b>analysis</b> of multi-component mixtures {{without the need}} for extensive sample preparation. This gives laboratories around the world the ability to quickly analyze unknown materials and perform materials characterization in such fields as metallurgy, mineralogy, forensic science, archeology, condensed matter physics, and the biological and pharmaceutical sciences. Identification is performed by comparison of the diffraction pattern to a known standard or to a database such as the International Centre for Diffraction Data's Powder Diffraction File (PDF) or the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD). Advances in hardware and software, particularly improved optics and fast detectors, have dramatically improved the analytical capability of the technique, especially relative to the speed of the analysis. The fundamental physics upon which the technique is based provides high precision and accuracy in the measurement of interplanar spacings, sometimes to fractions of an Ångström, resulting in authoritative identification frequently used in patents, criminal cases and other areas of law enforcement. The ability to analyze multiphase materials also allows analysis of how materials interact in a particular matrix such as a pharmaceutical tablet, a circuit board, a mechanical weld, a geologic core sampling, cement and concrete, or a pigment found in an historic painting. The method has been historically used for the identification and classification of minerals, but it can be used for any materials, even amorphous ones, so long as a suitable reference pattern is known or can be constructed.|$|E

40|$|Electron beam excited x-ray {{spectrometry}} {{is applied}} to <b>non-destructive</b> chemical <b>analysis</b> of solids in the near-surface region.
