5|$|Lipsett {{decided to}} tow <b>New</b> <b>Mexico</b> for {{scrapping}} at Newark, New Jersey. The proximity of Newark to rail lines {{made it an}} ideal location for dismantling the ship and hauling away the steel. In early November 1947 <b>New</b> <b>Mexico</b> departed Boston, towed by two tugs. On 12 November, while {{off the coast of}} New York, the tugs pulling the battleship encountered heavy weather and were forced to cut the tow lines. Running lights were kept on aboard <b>New</b> <b>Mexico</b> along with three crewmembers, but the tugs eventually lost sight of the battleship. <b>New</b> <b>Mexico</b> then drifted as a derelict until spotted by a Coast Guard plane the next day, 35 miles off the coast. The two tugs then secured tow lines and continued the journey to the scrapyard.|$|E
