5|$|He {{was found}} guilty and punished posthumously for the crime of treason. The Senate had his {{property}} proscribed, forbade mourning on his account, removed images of his likeness, such as statues and portraits, and his name was erased {{from the base of}} one statue in particular as part of his damnatio memoriae. Yet, in a show of clemency <b>not</b> <b>unlike</b> <b>that</b> of the emperor, the Senate had Piso's property returned and divided equally between his two sons, on condition that his daughter Calpurnia be given 1,000,000 sesterces as dowry and a further 4,000,000 as personal property. His wife Placina was absolved.|$|E

25|$|In 1826, {{when the}} Sultan issued a decree abolishing the janissaries in Bosnia, Gradaščević's {{immediate}} reaction was <b>not</b> <b>unlike</b> <b>that</b> {{of the rest}} of the Bosnian aristocracy. Gradaščević threatened that he would use military force to subdue anybody opposed to the Sarajevo janissaries. When the janissaries killed nakibul-ešraf Nuruddin Efendi Šerifović, however, his tone shifted and he rapidly distanced himself from their cause.|$|E
25|$|The {{leaves are}} short-petioled {{and so have}} little {{individual}} motion, but the branches sway as a whole. The spray is fine and abundant and lies horizontally so that the foliage arrangement is <b>not</b> <b>unlike</b> <b>that</b> of the beech (Fagus). Its often spectacular autumnal coloring, with intense reds to purples, is highly valued in landscape settings. It is the most fiery and brilliant of the 'brilliant group' that includes maple, dogwood, sassafras, and sweet gum, as well as various species of tupelo.|$|E
25|$|Designed in High Renaissance style, the {{building}} {{is not merely a}} replica of the United States Capitol. Local newspapers made a fuss when Gilbert sent to Georgia for marble, but the result, in which a hemispherical dome caps a high drum <b>not</b> <b>unlike</b> <b>that</b> of St. Peter's Basilica, crowning a building housing the bicameral legislature and the state supreme court, was so nobly handsome that West Virginia and Arkansas contracted for Gilbert capitols as well. Its brick dome is held in hoops of steel.|$|E

25|$|The {{style of}} his sacred music varies from simple homophony, {{designed}} for absolute clarity of textual expression in conformance with {{the dictates of}} the Council of Trent (as Mantua was a center of the Counter-Reformation, {{this was to be}} expected), to motet settings similar in expressive intensity to his madrigals including passages of surprising chromaticism <b>not</b> <b>unlike</b> <b>that</b> of Gesualdo. This is particularly true in the 1581 collections: Ascendente Jesu, for example, contains colorful examples of text-painting such as he used in the works he was composing for the Ferrarese court at the time.|$|E
25|$|Troelstra was {{the member}} of {{parliament}} for the district of Leeuwarden, close to the men's village of Beetgum, and was drawn into the case after the brother's conviction. He collected additional evidence, which he published in socialist newspapers. One of his revelations was that soon after the burglary, three men had quickly emigrated to America and Germany. However, Troelstra did not manage to get the case retried. The affair gained fame, particularly in socialist circles, as the Dutch pendant of the French Dreyfus Affair, and Troelstra's role was, perhaps not coincidentally, <b>not</b> <b>unlike</b> <b>that</b> played by Émile Zola. Despite the failure of his efforts (the brothers served most of their sentence), they contributed to Troelstra's reputation and goodwill in the Frisian countryside.|$|E
25|$|The large mound {{has been}} {{estimated}} to date from c. 3200 BC. The passages are independent of each other, leading to separate burial chambers. The eastern passage arrives at a cruciform chamber, <b>not</b> <b>unlike</b> <b>that</b> found at Newgrange, which contains three recesses and basin stones into which the cremated remains of the dead were placed. The right-hand recess is larger and more elaborately decorated with megalithic art than the others, which is typical for Irish passage graves of this type. The western passage ends in an undifferentiated chamber, which is separated from the passage by a sill stone. The chamber seems to have also contained a basin stone which was later removed and is now located about two-thirds down the passageway.|$|E

25|$|This glossy all-black crow has a {{heavy black}} bill with an arching culmen (upper {{edge of the}} mandible) and has a fine tip. The {{feathers}} have a purple gloss throughout. The tail of the Indian jungle crow is rounded and the legs and feet are stout. The Himalayan japonensis (in this sense including western intermedius and eastern tibetosinensis) has a slightly wedge-shaped tail and a voice is a guttural and grating graak (intermedius) or a hoarse kyarrh (tibetosinensis). The calls of the Indian jungle crow are <b>not</b> <b>unlike</b> <b>that</b> of the house crow but are harsher. In Sri Lanka, the house crow lacks the light grey neck but the neck is slimmer than in the jungle crow. The sexes are indistinguishable.|$|E
25|$|She {{was dressed}} for {{traveling}} and for cold weather. Her hood {{was large and}} round and red but not smooth, — it was corrugated; that is to say, it consisted {{of a series of}} rolls nearly as large as my arm, passing over her head sidewise, growing smaller toward the back until they terminated in a big button that was embellished with a knot of green ribbon. Its general appearance was <b>not</b> <b>unlike</b> <b>that</b> of the familiar, pictorial beehive except that the rolls were not arranged spirally. The broad, white ruffle of her lace cap projected several inches beyond the front of the hood and waved back and forth like the single leaves of a great white poppy, as she nodded emphatically in her discourse.|$|E
25|$|Also {{significant}} was the 1968 {{declaration of}} the Brezhnev Doctrine which officially asserted the Soviet Union's right to intervene in other nation's internal affairs {{in order to secure}} socialism from opposing capitalist forces. This doctrine was used to justify the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979. In Afghanistan the Soviet forces met a fierce resistance from the Afghans who were supported by the CIA. Battling an opposition that relied on guerrilla tactics and asymmetric warfare, the massive Soviet war machine proved incapable of achieving decisive victories and the entire campaign quickly devolved into a quagmire <b>not</b> <b>unlike</b> <b>that</b> which the U.S. faced a decade earlier in the Vietnam War. After ten years of fighting at the cost of approximately 20 billion dollars a year (in 1986 United States dollars) and 15,000 Soviet casualties, Gorbachev surrendered to public opinion and ordered troops to withdraw in early 1989.|$|E

500|$|The russet sparrow's vocalisations are {{described}} by most sources as [...] "the sweetest and most musical" [...] of any sparrow. Its basic call is a cheep or chilp, {{similar to that}} of other sparrows. This call is monosyllabic, unlike the house sparrow's chirrup call, and is softer than that of the other sparrows. This call is given as a flight call, or by displaying males. Recorded variations include a chweep given by males at the nest and a trilled cheeep. Sometimes the male strings calls together and sings them in a strident tone, to create a sort of short song, transcribed as cheep chirrup cheeweep or chreet-chreet-chreet. The song is interspersed with sibilant chu-swik notes {{similar to those of the}} white wagtail. A thin swee swee vocalisation <b>not</b> <b>unlike</b> <b>that</b> of an Indian robin has been reported, but the context of this call is unrecorded. During territorial disputes, males give a rapid chit-chit-chit call.|$|E
500|$|The Gulf Stream is {{typically}} [...] wide and [...] to [...] deep. [...] The current velocity is fastest near the surface, with {{the maximum speed}} typically about [...] [...] As it travels north, the warm water transported by the Gulf Stream undergoes evaporative cooling. The cooling is wind-driven: Wind moving over the water causes evaporation, cooling the water and increasing its salinity and density. [...] When sea ice forms, salts are {{left out of the}} ice, a process known as brine exclusion. [...] These two processes produce water that is denser and colder (or, more precisely, water that is still liquid at a lower temperature). In the North Atlantic Ocean, the water becomes so dense that it begins to sink down through less salty and less dense water. (The convective action is <b>not</b> <b>unlike</b> <b>that</b> of a lava lamp.) This downdraft of cold, dense water becomes a part of the North Atlantic Deep Water, a southgoing stream. [...] Very little seaweed lies within the current, although seaweed lies in clusters to its east.|$|E
500|$|After Pennant's death, the French {{zoologist}} and naturalist Georges Cuvier {{wrote of}} him [...] "When {{the life of}} a man is entirely devoted to the sciences, it cannot be expected that it will present a variety of incident; it will be found most truly in the analysis of his works." [...] Pennant is cited as an authority by Thomas Bewick throughout his pioneering field guide, A History of British Birds (2 volumes, 1797 and 1804). For example, under [...] "The Golden Eagle", Bewick writes that [...] "Pennant says there are instances, though rare, of their having bred in Snowdon Hills". Bewick cites him for facts about rare species like [...] "The Sclavonian Grebe": [...] "This species is not numerous in the British Isles. Pennant says, they inhabit and breed in the fens near Spalding, in Lincolnshire, and that the female makes a nest <b>not</b> <b>unlike</b> <b>that</b> of the Crested Grebe, and lays four or five white eggs." [...] On occasion, Pennant's knowledge could be highly specific: for [...] "The Great-Crested Grebe", Bewick records that the nest [...] "is made of various kinds of dried fibres, stalks and leaves of water plants, and (Pennant says) of the roots of bugbane, stalks of water-lily, pond-weed and water-violet; when it happens to be blown from among the reeds, it floats about upon the surface of the water".|$|E
5000|$|Although it {{has been}} {{considered}} to be a solitary animal, it is often encountered in pairs, and may be more sociable than commonly believed. It is arboreal, spending much of its time in trees. Its tail is <b>not</b> prehensile, <b>unlike</b> <b>that</b> of the related kinkajous, although it can act as a balance. The call of the northern olingo has been described as possessing two distinct notes, with a [...] "whey-chuck" [...] or [...] "wey-toll" [...] sound.|$|R

Certain types of obi are used with certain types of kimono; the obi of married and unmarried women are tied in different ways. Often the obi adjusts the formality and fanciness of the whole kimono outfit: the same kimono can be worn in very different situations depending on what kind of obi is worn with it.|$|R
