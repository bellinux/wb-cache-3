In June 1937, during an Imperial Conference of all the Dominion Prime Ministers in London, King informed British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain that Canada would only go to war if Britain were directly attacked, and that if Britain were to become involved in a continental war then Chamberlain was <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>expect</b> Canadian support.|$|E

Degas also introduced her to etching, of which he was a recognized master. The two worked side-by-side for a while, and her draftsmanship gained considerable strength under his tutelage. He depicted her in a series of etchings recording their trips to the Louvre. She treasured his friendship but learned <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>expect</b> too much from his fickle and temperamental nature after a project they were collaborating on at the time, a proposed journal devoted to prints, was abruptly dropped by him. The sophisticated and well-dressed Degas, then forty-five, was a welcome dinner guest at the Cassatt residence, and likewise they at his soirées.|$|E

500|$|On {{the other}} hand, PSXextreme's Ben Dutka, felt that Zack was {{not worthy of}} his own game, believing that only players with [...] "halfway decent memories" [...] and a [...] "hardcore completionist mentality" [...] {{will be able to}} {{remember}} Zack's appearances in the original Final Fantasy VII. IGN UK expressed a mixed opinion about the character, feeling his personality was sometimes annoying, although it served to contrast with the serious attitudes of the other main characters. Similarly, VideoGamer.com's Wesley Yin-Poole called Zack Cloud's [...] "identical twin in all but hair colour," [...] and complained about his personality being [...] "annoying" [...] {{during the first half of}} the game. Destructoid agreed, telling players <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>expect</b> to enjoy Zack if they do not like [...] "cocky teenagers," [...] and even labelling him an [...] "annoying cockhole." [...] Gameplanet criticized Rick Gomez' acting, finding it more immature than they expected. PALGN called Zack an unfamiliar character in the series since his only appearances were in backstories.|$|E

He also warns players <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>expect</b> the game to be enjoyable, saying: [...] "Playing Depression Quest isn't 'fun', like watching Schindler's List isn't 'enjoyable'.

500|$|Despite {{his lack}} of {{experience}} in composing film music, Prokofiev began his Kijé score confidently, later writing: [...] "I somehow had no doubts whatever about the musical language for the film". He told the producers, [...] "What {{is important to me}} is the era, the internal meaning of each event, the personality of each hero", and warned them <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>expect</b> mere musical [...] "illustrations". He attended rehearsals and made detailed notes of the action and the acting. The period setting of the film appealed to Prokofiev; Robinson comments that the Kijé score is one of several works, including the Classical Symphony, The Love of Three Oranges, Cinderella, and War and Peace, that show [...] "the composer's fondness for the eighteenth century". The language he chose combined elements of humour and romance with an underlying melancholy—he interpreted the story as more tragic than comic. Prokofiev had heard Ravel's Boléro in Paris, and had been much impressed by the French composer's use of the saxophone, an instrument then rarely used in orchestral compositions outside France but which suited Prokofiev's intentions perfectly. The composer Gerard McBurney has pointed out the [...] "haunting sounds of the tenor saxophone" [...] that punctuate the Kijé music.|$|E
500|$|During the {{remainder}} of the 1930s Gibbons [...] produced five more novels, as well as two poetry collections, a children's book, and a number of short stories. From November 1936 the family home was in Oakshott Avenue, on the Holly Lodge Estate off Highgate West Hill, where Gibbons regularly worked in the mornings from ten until lunchtime. [...] Her novels were generally well received by critics and the public, though none earned the accolades or attention that had been given to Cold Comfort Farm; [...] readers of The Times were specifically warned <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>expect</b> Gibbons's second novel, [...] Bassett (1934), to be a repetition of the earlier masterpiece. Enbury Heath (1935) is a relatively faithful account of her childhood and early adult life with, according to Oliver, [...] "only the thinnest veil of fictional gauze cover raw experience". Miss Linsey and Pa (1936) was thought by Nicola Beauman, in her analysis of women writers from 1914 to 1939, to parody Radclyffe Hall's [...] 1928 lesbian novel The Well of Loneliness. Gibbons's final prewar novels were [...] Nightingale Wood (1935)—"Cinderella brought right up to date"—and My American (1939), which Oliver considers her most escapist novel, [...] "a variant of Hans Christian Andersen's The Snow Queen." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{last years}} of Monteverdi's life were much {{occupied}} with opera for the Venetian stage. Richard Taruskin, in his Oxford History of Western Music, gives his chapter on this topic the title [...] "Opera from Monteverdi to Monteverdi." [...] This wording, originally proposed humorously by the Italian music historian Nino Pirrotta, is interpreted seriously by Taruskin as indicating that Monteverdi is significantly responsible for {{the transformation of the}} opera genre from a private entertainment of the nobility (as with Orfeo in 1607), to what became a major commercial genre, as exemplified by his opera L'incoronazione di Poppea (1643). His two surviving operatic works of this period, Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patria and L'incoronazione are held by Arnold to be the first [...] "modern" [...] operas; Il ritorno is the first Venetian opera to depart from what Ellen Rosand terms [...] "the mythological pastoral". However, David Johnson in The North American Review warns audiences <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>expect</b> immediate affinity with Mozart, Verdi or Puccini: [...] "You have to submit yourself to a much slower pace, to a much more chaste conception of melody, to a vocal style that is at first merely like dry declamation and only on repeated hearings begins to assume an extraordinary eloquence." ...|$|E

500|$|In April 1914 Grainger {{gave his}} first {{performance}} of Delius's piano concerto, at a music festival in Torquay. Thomas Beecham, {{who was one}} of the festival's guest conductors, reported to Delius that [...] "Percy was good in the forte passages, but made far too much noise in the quieter bits". Grainger [...] was receiving increasing recognition as a composer; [...] leading musicians and orchestras were adding his works to their repertoires. [...] His [...] decision to leave England for America in early September 1914, after the outbreak of the First World War, damaged his reputation among his patriotically minded British friends. Grainger wrote that the reason for this abrupt departure was [...] "to give mother a change" [...] – she had been unwell for years. However, according to Bird, Grainger often explained that his reason for leaving London was that [...] "he wanted to emerge as Australia's first [...] composer of worth, and to have laid himself open to the possibility of being killed would have rendered his goal unattainable". [...] The Daily Telegraph music critic Robin Legge accused him of cowardice, and told him <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>expect</b> a welcome in England after the war, words that hurt Grainger deeply.|$|E
500|$|Several {{established}} {{actors were}} {{considered for the}} leading role of Rusty Sabich. Kevin Costner turned down the role, and Robert Redford was vetoed by Pollack due to his age. When he was hired to direct the film, Pakula only offered the role to Harrison Ford, believing that the actor possessed an [...] "Everyman quality" [...] that best suited the character. [...] Ford's casting was confirmed in March 1989. He received a $7 million salary for the role. Turow was initially uncertain of Ford portraying Rusty but relented after seeing {{a few of the}} actor's films. Ford said, [...] "Friends warned me this was a tough role because Rusty is such a passive, interior character. Though Rusty's in every scene, all the action takes place around him. Things happen to him." [...] Upon being cast, Ford read the novel to avoid arguments over events and details that were left out in the book. Ford also suggested to Pakula that Rusty have a buzz cut. He explained, [...] "There are many things I found I could express with that short haircut. Simplest of all, I wanted to tell the audience to leave their baggage at home — <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>expect</b> the Harrison Ford they've seen before." ...|$|E
