U.S. Coast Guard and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) did confirm they had boats patrolling northwest Washington waters looking for Jenkins as early as Wednesday, August 19. Initial media reports were that the US Coast Guard and Canadian authorities chased Jenkins' speedboat as it crossed to Point Roberts, but these reports were later denied by officials.|$|E

25|$|In August 2015, the slating {{committee}} of the Cook County Democratic Party narrowly voted to endorse Brown for re-election to a fifth term in the March 2016 primary elections. In early October 2015, the Federal Bureau of Investigation executed a search warrant at Brown's home and seized her County-issued cell phone. Chicago attorney Ed Genson represented Brown. On October 23, 2015 the Cook County Democratic Party withdrew its endorsement of Brown, and endorsed Michelle A. Harris. In November 2015, {{an employee of the}} Clerk's office was charged in a federal indictment that alleged that he lied to a federal grand jury after he had been rehired by the Clerk's office weeks after lending $15,000 to a company controlled by Brown's husband; the employee pleaded not guilty.

25|$|During the 1940s, {{several cases}} {{arose from the}} {{provision}} of contraception by the Waterbury clinic, leading to legal challenges to {{the constitutionality of the}} Comstock law, but these failed on technical grounds. In Tileston v. Ullman (1943), a doctor and mother challenged the law on the grounds that a ban on contraception could, in certain sexual situations, threaten the lives and well-being of patients. The U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the appeal {{on the grounds that the}} plaintiff lacked standing to sue on behalf of his patients. Yale School of Medicine gynecologist C. Lee Buxton and his patients brought a second challenge to the law in Poe v. Ullman (1961). The Supreme Court again dismissed the appeal, on the grounds that the case was not ripe: the plaintiffs had <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>charged</b> or threatened with prosecution, so there was no actual controversy for the Court to resolve.|$|E
25|$|The {{pursuit of}} Latour-Maubourg's force faltered despite the British and Portuguese outnumbering them greatly. The reason behind this failure was {{subsequently}} disputed between supporters of Brigadier Long and Marshal Beresford. The cavalry clash at Campo Maior {{was to become}} a very controversial action. Beresford considered that Long had lost control of his light cavalry. Beresford also claimed that his taking personal command of the heavy dragoon brigade had prevented Long from ordering them to attempt a suicidal charge against French infantry squares. Long was of the opinion, and was subsequently supported in this by the historian Sir William Napier, that if Beresford had released the British brigade of heavy dragoons he {{would have been able to}} drive off the remaining French cavalry (two squadrons who had <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>charged</b> by the 13th LD and some rallied fugitives), who were in close support of their infantry, and consequently force the French infantry to surrender.|$|E

25|$|A renewed {{application}} {{for permission to}} bring a judicial review was made by Lutfur Rahman in August 2016, after the Metropolitan Police concluded in March 2016 there was insufficient evidence to bring a criminal prosecution. As part of the renewed application, permission to reopen the original judicial review application was seeked and granted by Ouseley J. The August 2016 application {{took the form of}} an {{application for}} permission to amend the grounds of the July 2015 judicial review claim. Three additional grounds for review were seeked by Rahman. The first two grounds rely on Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights arguing that the election court findings are incompatible with the presumption of innocence and right to a fair trial, given the subsequent decision of the Metropolitan Police. Permission for those two grounds were rejected by the divisional court with the findings that Rahman was at no point charged with a criminal offence for the purpose of Article 6, and that there were no parallel criminal proceedings alongside civil proceedings of the election court. Permission to include the second ground was additionally denied on the basis of undue delay in raising the issue by Rahman. Under the third ground, Rahman seeked a declaratory judgment that the Metropolitan Police decision to discontinue criminal investigation into him constituted an acquittal, and thus triggering the power of a court to order the cessation of the incapacity previously imposed by the election court judgment. Permission was denied based on the earlier finding that Rahman had <b>not</b> <b>been</b> <b>charged,</b> and thus impossible to have been acquitted on a prosecution.|$|E

Jackson booked the whole fourth floor of a clinic and was put on Valium IV to wean him from painkillers. The media showed Jackson little sympathy.
