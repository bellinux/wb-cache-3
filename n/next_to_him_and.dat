5|$|Bleak then {{returned}} to the patrol and attempted to treat more wounded members, but soon thereafter a Chinese hand grenade bounced off the helmet of the soldier standing <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> landed nearby. Bleak tackled the soldier over and covered him with his larger frame to protect him from the grenade, but neither was injured in the ensuing blast. The patrol then continued on its mission, and was successful in capturing several Chinese prisoners. However, as it descended Hill 499 to return to UN lines, they were ambushed by another group of Chinese hidden in a trench with an automatic weapon. Three of the other soldiers were wounded in the attack, and as Bleak attempted to run to them, he was hit in the leg. Bleak dressed all four wounds, but one of the men had been hit too critically to move. In spite of continued Chinese fire and his own injury, Bleak picked up the wounded soldier and began to carry him down the hill.|$|E
5|$|I fell in {{love with}} him as a ten-year-old boy. I saw him in a play in New York... a very well-staged melodrama which was an {{enormous}} hit for about a year—it was made as a movie later with somebody else. He had the leading role, and I never forgot him. And through the years I'd seen him in movies—little things. And I could never forget that performance of his. He's always played very stereotyped parts in pictures but is one of the best actors I've ever known. I have such respect for him. You play <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> you just feel the thing that you do with a big actor—this dynamo going on.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} Carey driving up {{to a large}} movie theater, the Los Angeles Theatre in {{downtown}} Los Angeles, with several of her female friends. As they {{pull up to the}} front doors, they tell Carey that her boyfriend is inside with another woman, leading her to try to convince them to abort the plan of confrontation. After convincing her, they enter the theater and begin a series of small dance routines alongside some of the theater employees. As the music begins, scenes of them dancing and Carey entering the movie projection room inter-cut. Carey sits behind her boyfriend (played by Jerry O'Connell) and the woman he is cheating with, and spy on them in a comedic way with her female lackeys. Soon after, the still unidentified woman walks towards the bathroom, prompting Carey to follow her during a short interlude in the video. After running into each other by the washroom, the woman appears to be Carey sporting a short brown wig and red seductive clothing. Carey pokes her, starting a large brawl in between the two women. Afterwards, Carey appears to have defeated the woman named Bianca, and heads back towards the movie room. During this scene, Jay-Z's rap verse is played, while an animated clip of Jay-Z and Carey is projected onto the screen. Later a version of the video leaked where Jay-Z was rapping his verse in a jacuzzi. During the verse, Carey's friends begin throwing popcorn and other candies at O'Connell, prompting a small food fight in between them. As they halt their attack on him, Carey walks towards O'Connell's seat and acts as though she is Bianca. After she sits <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> he notices who it is, Carey spills a large soda on his lap and bids him farewell, leaving the theater with her friends smiling.|$|E

25|$|Unlike its predecessor, the {{syndicated}} What's My Line? did not emphasize formality as the panelists dressed in normal attire. In addition, the panelists were simply {{referred to by}} name and only their first names were displayed in front of them.

500|$|The 1973 Kentucky Derby on May 5 {{attracted}} {{a crowd of}} 134,476 to Churchill Downs, then the largest crowd in North American racing history.

Fernández glances at the photos of him and Veronica and burns them at the fireplace. He steps outside but still cannot forget the time he spent with her and imagines Veronica next to him. He exercises as another attempt to forget but to no avail. Fernández takes a shower and hallucinates Veronica being <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> holding him.

500|$|... "Subway" [...] {{was shot}} by Alex Zakrzewski, the series' regular {{director}} of photography. The episode was staged so that Pembleton is initially keeping his distance from Lange, but gradually moves closer and closer as they begin to bond, {{and by the end}} is sitting <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> holding his hand. Accordingly, the initial scenes included wider shots with Braugher and D'Onofrio on the outer edges of the frame, but later scenes included more close-ups of the two sitting together. Although Homicide: Life on the Street typically employs a number of back-and-forth whip pan-style cuts, Fleder asked that the style be modified for this episode. In earlier scenes, Fleder asked for wider long shots {{to create a sense of}} setting within the subway station, and as the episode progressed and the story became more intense, he then allowed more close-ups and whip pans. This led to disagreements on the set between Fleder and Zakrzewski, who felt Fleder was trying to being too disruptive and difficult. Fleder said of his behavior, [...] "I have to admit, I'm not the most charming guy on the set. I'm just not. When I'm on the set, I'm very focused and my humor goes away and I become not so charming." [...] After the episode was complete, Fleder said that he and Zakrzewski settled their differences and were both happy with the final result.|$|E
500|$|Additionally, {{aside from}} the three men, Carey worked with Carole King, a female singer-songwriter who had been {{predominantly}} popular in the 1970s. However, unlike with C+C Music Factory, King approached Carey, hoping {{to work with her}} after hearing her perform live on The Arsenio Hall Show. During a conversation with Carey, King suggested that she cover [...] "(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman," [...] a song she had written with Gerry Goffin for Aretha Franklin. After giving it some thought, Carey declined the offer, feeling uncomfortable about recording a song she felt one of her musical influences performed so perfectly. Still determined on working with Carey, King flew to New York for one day, to try to create a ballad of some sort. The two ladies sat together by a piano {{over the course of the}} day, and by nightfall, had written and arranged a song titled [...] "If It's Over." [...] After working with Carey, King said in an interview [...] "I love her voice. She's very expressive. She gives a lot of meaning to what she sings." [...] After recording [...] "If It's Over," [...] Carey expressed the musical connection she shared with Afanasieff, as well as the creative format in which she wrote and produced her music when with him, or working with C+C Music Factory. When working with Afanasieff, the duo would sit by a piano, and lead each other vocally and musically, until they would reach the right note and arrangement. During an interview in 1992, Afanasieff described how Carey would stand <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> begin singing different notes and tunes she was thinking of, while he would follow her with the piano. In doing so, he would help lead her to the right note and vice versa. Carey described their working relationship as [...] "very unique," [...] and felt it to be very similar to the form in which she had worked with Margulies. While similar, Carey's creative process with Cole and Clivillés proved different; they would bring her several different tapes and tunes, of which she would choose from. Afterwards, they would work on building the already created melody, and have Carey add and build onto it, as well as writing the lyrics and key.|$|E
