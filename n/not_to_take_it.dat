5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the pre-production phase, Carter and Bowman were busy with the television series, leaving Sackheim to work alone. Sackheim hired executive producer Lata Ryan, who had previously collaborated with Steven Spielberg for his 1993 film, Jurassic Park. Once hired, Ryan was allowed to read the script in front of the Ten Thirteen Productions staff members—but <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> away. At this time, most of the staff members had not read the script for themselves. After Ryan accepted the offer of becoming executive producer, Chris Nowak was hired as production designer, Ward Russell as director of photography and Bill Liams as construction coordinator. According to Ryan, they had secured all key personnel six weeks before principal filming began.|$|E

500|$|Kenneth Silber from Space.com {{was very}} {{negative}} towards the episode, saying, [...] "This episode conveys {{a strong sense}} of a writer, director and actors merely going through the motions, collecting their sizable paychecks while running out the clock on the season and series. The plot is not compelling, the agents themselves seem <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> seriously, and the doppelgangers around whom the action revolves are little more than ciphers." [...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode one star out of five. The two wrote, [...] "'Fight Club' is a marker for a series that seems to want to die now, please. [...] it's tonally one of the most atypical episodes the series ever made, conceived in spite and self-loathing and sheer exhaustion." [...] Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a largely negative review and awarded it one star out of four. Vitaris criticized the use of Kathy Griffin and asserted, [...] "the guest cast {{is one of the worst}} ever. [...] Griffin [...] simply is not up to the task; she can not differentiate Betty and Lulu at all [...] and she reads every line as if she were still on her cancelled sitcom." [...] i09 reviewer Cyriaque Lama named [...] "The Kathy Griffin Twins" [...] the tenth [...] "Most Ridiculous X-Files Monsters of the Week", and derided her performance as the Templeton twins. In 2016, in a ranking of all episodes of the series from best to worst, Vulture.com named [...] "Fight Club" [...] the worst episode of the series.|$|E

2500|$|The song [...] "Hetero", with lyrics {{written by}} Stevenson, drew some {{negative}} remarks. Reviewing the band's May 25, 1995 performance at Irving Plaza, Jon Pareles of The New York Times called it [...] "openly homophobic, {{and it goes}} on to describe the narrator as a 'cigarette smokin', seal killin' redneck. Jon Ginoli, openly gay frontman of the queercore band Pansy Division, called it [...] "an obviously anti-gay backlash song. In it [...] proclaims himself as a normal straight guy who can't get laid, and he's blaming gay guys. What? In his words, 'the only way you're cool is if you're gay or dead'. Huh? 'Maybe I should pierce my butt or get a few tattoos / Maybe I should wear a dress and be a homo like you / Normal, hetero, straight guy / Yeah that's right, I'm a straight, normal, girl fuckin', coffee drinkin', titty suckin', cigarette smokin', seal killin', redneck-ass bastard from hell'. Hmm, I don't think the gay guys are to blame for that [...] Hearing the song, it was hard <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> personally [...] At the same time I felt sad for the guy, who so obviously appeared threatened by gay people having more visibility and acceptance." ...|$|E
2500|$|Santorum {{stated that}} he spent [...] "maybe a month a year" [...] at his Pennsylvania home, raising {{allegations}} of hypocrisy as he had denounced his former opponent Doug Walgren for living away from his House district. Critics also complained that Pennsylvania taxpayers were paying 80% of the tuition for five of Santorum's children to attend an online [...] "cyber school"—a benefit available only to Pennsylvania residents—when all his children lived in Virginia. The Penn Hills School District, which covered the tuition costs for the cyber school through local taxes, unsuccessfully filed a complaint against Santorum for reimbursement in 2005, but won reimbursement from the state in September 2006 {{in the amount of}} $55,000. In response, Santorum asked county officials to remove the homestead tax exemption from his Penn Hills property, saying he was entitled to it, but chose <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>it</b> because of the political dispute. Since 2006, Santorum has been home-schooling his seven children. Santorum responded to the dispute saying that his children should not be implicated in the [...] "politics of personal destruction".
