As with Tarzan the Ape Man, Indian elephants taken from M.G.M's zoo had attachments fixed to their ears and tusks to suggest African elephants. During the crocodile wrestling scene, a mechanical crocodile, equipped with <b>nigrosine</b> dye sacks to simulate blood, was used. Perhaps the highlight of the action sequences occurs with the elephants vs. lions battle. Travelling matte shots were used to depict lions leaping up and holding on to elephants, who then seized them with their trunks and hurled them down, or crushed them beneath their feet. Tarzan rides a rhinoceros in one scene - a first for film. The rhino, Mary, was imported from the Hagenbeck Zoo in Hamburg, Germany. Weissmuller did the scene himself, sustaining only minor scrapes to sensitive places from Mary's rough hide.|$|E

Consequently, I studied the action of a glucocorticoid, methylprednisolone (MPS), on human lymphoid cell lines as a possible in vitro model for this effect. MPS induced both a cytolethal and growth inhibitory response in these cells, which I have defined on a kinetic and morphological basis. The cytolethal response - measured by the ability of live cells to exclude <b>nigrosine</b> after treatment over 48 hr - was dose-dependent, occurring around 10 MPS. Maximal lethal effects occurred only on continuous exposure of the cells to MPS. Morphological changes, as observed by light and electron microscopy, were consistent with apoptosis followed by autolysis, with increased <b>nigrosine</b> uptake correlating closely with onset of autolysis. A low background level of apoptosis and autolysis was also present in control cultures. The growth inhibitory response - measured {{by an increase in}} population doubling time after treatment over several days - was dose-dependent, occurring within the concentration range 10 M - 10 Si MPS. Again, continuous exposure to MPS was necessary for the response to be maintained. Morphological changes resulting from sub lethal damage were seen in mitochondria by electron microscopy; in addition a small {{increase in the number of}} apoptotic and autolytic cells was observed by light microscopy. Cell cycle kinetic analysis. revealed that growth inhibition was a stable effect caused by a blockage of cells in G^ (or Gq); I was unable to determine whether blocked cells were committed to death or maintained the ability to return to cycle. A correlation was made between my own results and biochemical studies performed on human lymphoid cell lines by other workers in our research group.

This paper describes a spray controller aiming to compensate {{the effect of the}} horizontal boom movements on the spray deposits homogeneity. The controller is based on three main components: a control law describing the relationship between nozzle speed, nozzle flow and spray deposit; a real time measurement of the boom horizontal speed variations using micro-machined capacitive accelerometers, and pulse width modulation (PWM) nozzle flow actuators. To assess the feasibility of such a controller, a single nozzle prototype was developed and tested in the laboratory, using a <b>nigrosine</b> solution.

The measured fRHext(%RH, Dry) was compared to theoretical calculations based on Mie theory, using the measured growth factors and assuming homogeneous mixing. The expected complex refractive indices (RIs) using the volume weighted mixing rule were compared to the RIs derived from the extinction measurements. Moreover, the differences between assuming a core-shell structure or a homogeneous mixing of the substances is examined. The laboratory results were used as a basis to model {{the change in the}} total extinction, the single scattering albedo (&omega;), and the asymmetry parameter (g) in the twilight zone of clouds at 355 nm and 532 nm. We found slightly linear to no dependency of fRH(%RH, Dry) with size for absorbing substances in contrast to the decreasing exponential behavior with size for purely scattering substances. However, no discernable difference could be made between the two wavelengths used. Less than 5 % {{differences were found between the}} real parts of the complex refractive indices derived and those calculated using the volume weighted mixing rule, and the imaginary parts had up to a 20 % difference. Moreover, for substances with growth factor less than 1. 15 there was, in average, less than 5 % difference between the extinction efficiencies calculated using a core-shell model and assuming homogeneous mixing for size parameters less than 2. 5. For x> 2. 5 the differences were greater causing and overestimation of the extinction efficiency (Qext) values if homogenous mixing was assume instead of a core-shell structure. The total extinction as a function of distance from the nearest cloud was found to be independent from the imaginary component (k) of the dry RI of the absorbing aerosols modeled. On the other hand, the single scattering albedo, as expected, decreased with larger values of k, whereas the asymmetry parameter increased suggesting a reduction in the reflectivity of the twilight zone with more absorbing aerosols and a reduction of cloud edge 3 -D radiative effects...|$|E

During isolation 16 % of the total protein and 24 % of the total lactic dehydrogenase were lost from the cells, but subsequent enzyme leakage was low. Leakage increased with shaking, incubation at 37 °C, or increasing the oxygen tension of the suspending medium, but was minimal when the Na+: K+ ratio in the medium was 8 : 1 and the osmolarity was high. Losses of particulate enzyme activities were negligible. Respiration was constant for up to 4 hr and was insensitive to calcium, bicarbonate, oxygen tension, and pH.

40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this study}} is to {{characterize}} the impact of binder liquid distribution on granule properties during the wet granulation process. A new parameter, namely the binder liquid transfer coefficient, is used to characterize binder liquid distribution. The relationships between binder liquid distribution coefficient and granule size distribution are discussed. Granules are made of lactose alpha-monohydrate (97. 5 % w/w, d 50 = 31 μm) and polyvinylpyrrolidone (2. 5 % w/w, d 50 = 89 μm) and are manufactured in a Mi-Pro high shear mixer (Pro-C-epT, Belgium). <b>Nigrosine</b> is incorporated as a tracer in the binder liquid in order to detect its distribution in the granules during the process. The results show that the binder liquid is heterogeneously distributed at the beginning of the process whereas it tends to be evenly distributed in the powder during the process. The binder liquid transfer in granule classes obeys a first-order law and the binder liquid transfer coefficient appears to be related to operating conditions: high rotation speed, low liquid flow rate and low liquid viscosity favour the achievement of high liquid transfer coefficient. In addition, the higher the coefficient, the earlier the homogenization and the wider the granule mean diameters. Thus, granule size distribution can be controlled by the binder liquid distribution process. A binder liquid distribution mechanism is proposed, which makes it possible to discuss the influence of the operating parameters on the granule construction process...|$|E

In this study, the decolorization of Methylene blue (a phenothiazine dye) under high salt conditions using Bacillus firmus was investigated. The bacterial isolate was obtained from textile effluent as a positive enrichment culture with dye using simulated saline dye wastewater at 4 % salt content. The effects of chemical parameters inherent in real textile wastewater such as dye, salt (sodium chloride) and surfactant (sodium duodecyl sulphate) concentration on decolorization of Methylene Blue (MB) by the bacterium were assessed. The bacterium showed tolerance for high concentrations of the dye as {{it was able to}} decolorize different concentrations (25 - 125 mg L - 1) of MB albeit at varying rates. Efficient Methylene blue decolorization in saline medium was at salt concentrations between 1 and 6 % while, tolerance to the effect of surfactant was at concentrations between 0. 1 and 5. 0 mg L - 1. The isolate had a broad spectrum decolorization efficiency being able to decolorize seven structurally different dyes: Safranin (82. 6 %); Serva blue (76. 8 %); Neutral red (63. 7 %); Methylene blue (94. 6 %); Crystal violet (67. 2 %); <b>Nigrosine</b> (41. 5 %) and Basic fuchsin (68. 1 %) to varying degrees under high salt conditions. Spectrophotometric analyses in the UV-visible domain of culture supernatants indicated color removal was due to biodegradation rather than adsorption of dyes on bacterial cells.

Anoxia was induced by incubation of cultures in normal medium for 45 min at 25 °C {{in an atmosphere of}} nitrogen (N 2), and cell death was measured by <b>nigrosine</b> dye uptake. Immediately after anoxia, cell death was highest in S 3 and MAL segments > S 2 > S 1 = CCT. The combined effects of anoxia and substrate (glucose, vitamins, amino acid) omission determined after incubation of cultures in phosphate buffered saline containing Ca 2 + and Mg 2 + (PBS) for 45 min in N 2 also showed differential killing dependent on segment of origin: MAL > S 3 > S 2 CCT > S 1. The effects of in vitro “reflow” were tested by returning cells to their normal oxygenated culture media at 37 °C. After the 45 min of anoxia and four to six hr of reflow in normal calcium–containing media, all cells from each segment were dead. Reflow in media lacking calcium for two hr immediately after anoxia then followed by return to normal calcium–containing media was associated with the survival of a significant percentage of cells for 48 hr: S 1 (35. 3 ± 2. 0 %), S 2 (30. 0 ± 2. 0 %), S 3 (46. 2 ± 3. 0 %), MAL (38. 7 ± 3. 0 %), CCT (28. 2 ± 2. 0 %). These results indicate that cells from different nephron segments have different intrinsic susceptibilities to anoxia and that the catastrophic effect on cell survival induced by “reflow”, that is, return of oxygen and substrates, can be significantly attenuated by removal of calcium from the environment for the initial two hr after the insult...|$|E

The aim of this thesis was to find the influence of different equilibration and freezing curve conditions to on spermatozoa viability after thawing. The theoretical part of the thesis summarizes available information about the bulls semen parameters, methods for its evaluation and especially the processing and long-term preservation. Within the case study part of the thesis, during the years 2013 - 2015 the semen of the pre-selected group of 5 breeding bulls was being collected at the Sires insemination center. The group was uniform as to age, breed and housing and treatment conditions. After initial assessment the collected semen was divided into parts, which were then processed in different wals. A part of straws was processed by standard protocol, the other part was processed using different length of equilibration and freezing curve. First part of the straws was equilibrated in a standard protocol for 120 minutes; subsequently half of the equilibrated straws was standardly frozen by the Direct Freezing method based on 3 -phase freezing curve while the other half was frozen using the different 2 -phase freezing curve. Second part of the straws was initially equilibrated for 240 minutes with the subsequent freezing, similarly {{as in the previous}} case, used 3 -phase and 2 -phase freezing curve. Frozen straws were then stored in liquid nitrogen container at - 196 °C. Spermatozoa motility was evaluated using CASA. The semen was further evaluated on the proportion of live and dead spermatozoa, using coloration of Eosin and <b>Nigrosine,</b> and on the sensitivity of the spermatozoa membranes, using HOS test, which detects the reaction of spermatozoa tail membrane to hypoosmotic conditions. The obtained results indicated higher progressive spermatozoa motility (+ 5. 57 %) and higher percentage of live spermatozoa (+ 4. 47 %) following the application of the prolonged equilibration (240 min). When applying the length of equilibration 240 minutes, the values of total spermatozoa motility and HOS test were higher as well, though the differences were not statistically significant. When evaluate the effect of using different freezing curves on the parameters of the spermatozoa after thawing, higher values (average + 1. 6 %) at almost all of these parameters using 3 -phase freezing curve were found, the diferrences were not statistically significant. Statistically significant differences among the bulls (P < 0. 01) were found in total as well as progressive spermatozoa motility, in the proportion of living spermatozoa and in value of the HOS test - the individuality among the bulls is therefore evident.

40|$|The aim of optimalization the {{insemination}} doses {{production is}} to provide the highest fertilization ability of spermatozoa during the demanding proces of processing fresh semen and its subsequent cryopreservation. Temperature changes causes spermatozoa damage during the cooling and freezing. Spermatozoa is exposed to cold shock and many others limiting factors, which leads to cell death and therefore to decline of fertilization ability of thawed insemination doses. For increasing spermatozoa resistance, exactly the plasma membrane resistance against cold shock was fraction of egg yolk LDL cholesterol (low density lipoprotein) at various concentrations into the comercially produced diluents added. It is believed that LDL acts possitively to plasma membrane and helps to maintain the fertilization ability of spermatozoa after thawing. Following step in the proces of insemination doses production is slow cooling of diluted semen and equilibration, when the straws are store at cooling box for 30 minutes to 240 hours. This period is necessary to penetrate of certain diluent components into the spermatazoa also maintain the balance between their intracellular and extracellular concentration. Also important is subsequent freezing temperature gradient of insemination doses. The most suitable freezing method is based on computer controlled temperature decline in freezing chamber which allows the precise control of ice crystals formation that could tear and kill the cell. During 2012 to 2016 was repeatedly collected semen from the group of breeding bulls (n = 27, Holstein and Czech Fleckvieh breed) at AI centre. Semen which fulfill the standard entrance conditions in first step was evenly into several parts divided. For dilution {{the three types of}} comercially diluents AndroMed, Bioxcell and Triladyl with and without LDL addition were used. Into the diluents AndroMed and Bioxcell the concentration of LDL 4 %, 6 % and 8 % into the dilent Triladyl 6 %, 8 % and 10 % was added. Diluted semen was filled into the glass capillares with volume 0, 1 ml and temperature + 4 °C. Subsequently the sample was placed to cold bath (0 °C) for 10 minutes. Then the volume of capillare with physiological solution (37 °C) was mixed and for next 120 minutes was incubate. The effect of cold shock to proportion of live spermatozoa was evaluated by using Eosin and <b>Nigrosine</b> staining technique during heat test of spermatozoa survivability after spermatozoa heating and after 120 minutes of incubation. The more suitable semen diluents which provide the higher spermatozoa resistance against cold shock were AndroMed and Bioxcell. Together the possitive effect of LDL addition into the diluents to lower decrease of proportion of live spermatozoa during heat test was found (P< 0. 05). The most suitable LDL concentration which had a favorable influence at spermatozoa resistance against cold shock was 6 % in diluent Bioxcell. Values of the proportion of live sperm were higher {{at the beginning of the}} heat test (+ 1. 31 % to + 3. 2 %) and after 120 minute incubation (+ 5. 82 % to + 8. 41 %) compared to other diluents with and without addition of LDL. In the next step the process of equilibration was optimized, is an important part of insemination doses production. The effect of the length of equilibration for subsequent fertilization ability of spermatozoa was evaluated using spermatozoa motility based of CASA and proportion of live spermatozoa after thawing and during heat survival test lasting 120 minutes (37 ° C). Suitable semen was diluted by comercially used diluent AndroMed based on soya lecithin, filled into the straws (0. 25 ml), cooled and equilibrated in cooling box for 30, 120 and 240 minutes and freezed in programmable freezing box applying four types of freezing curves differing in temperature rate decline. There was used standard and by producer recommended 3. phase freezing curve, then 2. phase freezing curve, and 3. phase freezing curve with slower as well as rapid decline of temperature rate in freezing chamber, compared with standard freezing curve. The highest spermatozoa motility was found using 240 minutes of equilibration by + 2. 72 % and + 4. 58 % compared to other lengths of equilibration (P < 0. 05 to 0. 01). The highest proportion of live spermatozoa was found using 120 minutes of equilibration (+ 6. 87 % and + 8. 68 %). The highest average spermatozoa motility during heat test after thawing was achieved by using 2. phase freezing curve (from + 2. 97 % to + 10. 37 %, P < 0. 05), also in the proportion of live spermatozoa (from + 4. 37 % to + 8. 82 %, P < 0. 01). When evaluating interaction between the length of equilibration and freezing curve (standard 3. phase and 2. phase freezing curve), the highest average spermatozoa motility and proportion of live spermatozoa using 240 minutes of equilibration by both freezing curves was reached, there was no statistically significant differences. As well as, in all evaluated parts of this study the individual differences between ejaculate of bulls and within semen from one bull (P < 0. 05) as secondary effect were found. To maintain good fertilization ability of semen during cryopreservation is necessary to increase the spermatozoa resistance against cold shock using addition of correct concentration of LDL into the commercially used diluents AndroMed and Bioxcell. Subsequently the fertilization ability of insemination dose is influenced by cooling, the length of equilibration and freezing. The length of equilibration 120 minutes and more as well as gentle way of freezing according to freezing curve, which ensures a gradual decrease of temperature in freezing chamber provided the higher average spermatozoa motility and proportion of live spermatozoa...|$|E
