5|$|Johnson <b>never</b> <b>gave</b> <b>up</b> on {{a return}} to public service. He ran an {{unsuccessful}} campaign for the U.S. Senate against John J. Crittenden in 1842. He briefly and futilely sought his party's nomination for president in 1844. He also ran as an independent candidate for Governor of Kentucky in 1848, but after talking with the Democratic candidate, Lazarus W. Powell, who had replaced Linn Boyd on the ticket, Johnson decided to drop out and back Powell. Some speculated that the real object of this campaign was to secure another nomination to the vice-presidency, but this hope was denied.|$|E

25|$|King {{was not a}} pacifist, but {{he showed}} little enthusiasm for the Great War; he faced {{criticism}} for not serving in Canada's military and instead working for the Rockefellers. But he was nearly 40 years old when the war began, and was not in good physical condition. He <b>never</b> <b>gave</b> <b>up</b> his Ottawa home, and travelled to the United States on an as-needed basis, performing valuable service by helping to keep war-related industries running smoothly.|$|E

25|$|By {{the end of}} the war the {{battalion}} had gained a remarkable reputation: they never failed to complete a mission, and they <b>never</b> <b>gave</b> <b>up</b> an objective once taken. They are the only Canadians to participate in the Battle of the Bulge and had advanced deeper than any other Canadian unit into enemy territory. Despite being a Canadian Army formation, it was assigned to the British 3rd Parachute Brigade, a British Army formation, which was itself assigned to the British 6th Airborne Division.|$|E

25|$|Hale {{moved to}} Santa Barbara, California, {{for two years}} in the 1890s, perhaps to improve her health after falling ill during her late twenties. In 1904, she moved to Washington, D.C., where she acted as her father's hostess during his time as {{chaplain}} for the U.S. Senate. As an unmarried woman, Hale did what was expected of her and devoted herself to the need of her parents.

Syndra is allowed to descend to Earth at an inappropriate time (faeries can descend and ascend at the full moon) with the King to find Oran at the price of being forced to be reborn as a spirit force of gold and then confined for all eternity, as Gabija, Nyrckes, and Neptune once were.|$|E
25|$|Davitt's {{ambition}} {{that the}} ownership of the land would be transferred from the landlords to the tenants finally materialised after the 1902 Land Conference under O'Brien's Wyndham Land (Purchase) Act (1903), but not as he had campaigned for. He condemned the act that offered generous inducement to the landlords to sell their estates to the tenants, the Irish Land Commission mediating to then collect land annuities instead of rents, {{on the grounds that}} landlords should not receive any compensation for land which Davitt felt belonged to the state. He <b>never</b> <b>gave</b> <b>up</b> his adherence to land nationalisation. Later in 1906 after the Liberal Party came to power, his open support for their policy of state control of schooling, rather than denominational education, merged into a major conflict between Davitt and the Irish Catholic Church.|$|E

25|$|In 200 CE, Sun Ce {{died and}} was succeeded by his younger brother, Sun Quan. After Sun Quan {{took control of}} the Wu lands, he {{recruited}} Lu Ji to serve as a zoucaoyuan (奏曹掾; a minor official in a bureau) under him. Lu Ji subsequently served as the Administrator (太守) of Yulin Commandery (鬱林郡; around present-day Guiping, Guangxi). He was also promoted to Lieutenant-General (偏將軍) and placed in command of 2,000 troops. However, Lu Ji did not aspire to be an official, because he not only had physical disabilities, but also because he was actually interested in scholarly pursuits. Nevertheless, throughout his career, he <b>never</b> <b>gave</b> <b>up</b> on academics even though he was busy with military affairs. He created the Hun Tian Tu (渾天圖) and annotated the Yi Jing and Taixuanjing, and his works were spread around later.|$|E
25|$|Because of {{the money}} she gave up, her family stayed poor because her salary was only 207 RMB, which was equal to 20 dollars a month. And her {{research}} and work place was very poor. However, she <b>never</b> <b>gave</b> <b>up.</b> After coming back to China, she began working as soon as possible. In 1957, her workplace-Institute of Semiconductor CAS—finished making the first mono-crystalline germanium in China. By virtue of the working experience in Sylvania Company, she knew all the processes in making the mono-crystalline silicon. However she could not get any equipment because of embargoes from other countries. So she changed the process and made the first mono-crystalline silicon in China in 1958. China became the third country to make mono-crystalline silicon by itself. In 1962, she designed the mono-crystal furnace. This furnace had been merchandized to many countries. In the same year, she made the first mono-crystalline gallium arsenide in China. Lanying Lin’s gallium arsenide reached the highest mobility {{at that time in}} the whole world.|$|E
25|$|In 1874, {{she married}} Alexander Sullivan (born August 9, 1847, Waterville, Maine), {{whom she had}} met in Detroit. They made their home in Chicago. He was chosen in 1883 as first {{president}} of the Irish National League of America with the object to promote home rule in Ireland. He resigned in 1884 to practice law in Chicago. Sullivan's married life, despite the rumors to the contrary, was happy. She <b>never</b> <b>gave</b> <b>up</b> editorial writing but neither did she allow it to interfere with her duties as wife. She generally did her work at her home. A few years after her marriage, Sullivan severed her connection with the Times and became editorial writer on the Chicago Tribune. In 1883, she became associated with the Chicago Herald. The editors, who a few years before had refused to take her on their papers, now clamored for her services. Though a general editorial writer, Sullivan's political editorials gained her the greatest recognition.|$|E

He received permission to resume performing liturgical functions without any say in administration, and spent his remaining years in seclusion and prayer.

500|$|During 2000, Hamm {{obtained}} {{the role of}} romantic firefighter Burt Ridley on NBC's drama series Providence. His one-episode contract grew to 19, and enabled him to quit waiting tables.

During filming that movie, he turned 30. His career was bolstered by his playing the recurring role of police inspector Nate Basso on Lifetime's television series The Division, from 2002 to 2004. Other minor roles followed on the television series What About Brian, , Related, Numb3rs, The Unit, and The Sarah Silverman Program.
