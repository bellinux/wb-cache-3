500|$|Calvin's friends {{urged him}} to marry. Calvin took a prosaic view, writing to one correspondent:I, who have the air of being so hostile to celibacy, I am still not married and {{do not know whether}} I will ever be. If I take a wife it will be because, being better freed from {{numerous}} worries, I can devote myself to the Lord. Several candidates were presented to him including one young woman from a noble family. Reluctantly, Calvin agreed to the marriage, on the condition that she would learn French. Although a wedding date was planned for March 1540, he remained reluctant and the wedding never took place. He later wrote that he would <b>never</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> marrying her, [...] "unless the Lord had entirely bereft me of my wits". Instead, in August of that year, he married Idelette de Bure, a widow who had two children from her first marriage.|$|E

500|$|In {{response}} to this letter, Madison visited Jefferson at Monticello {{during the first week}} of September. Their discussion was important in that it persuaded Jefferson to depart from his radical stance on dissociation from the Union, which is expressed at the end of the excerpt above. At the very least, Virginia or Kentucky taking such a stance publicly would have justified the Federalist attacks against the secessionist tendencies of the Democratic-Republicans. Madison won over Jefferson, who shortly thereafter wrote to Wilson Cary Nicholas that: [...] "From [...] I retreat readily, not only in deference to [...] judgment but because as we should <b>never</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> separation but for repeated and enormous violations, so these, when they occur, will be cause enough of themselves." [...] Adrienne Koch and Harry Ammon, examining Jefferson's later writing, conclude that Madison had a significant role [...] "in softening Jefferson's more extreme views." ...|$|E
500|$|The package {{illustration}} for Fate of Atlantis {{was inspired}} by the Indiana Jones movie posters of Drew Struzan. It was drawn by Eaken within three days, following disagreements with the marketing department and an external art director over which concept to use. Clint Bajakian, Peter McConnell and Michael Land created the soundtrack for the game, arranging John Williams' main theme [...] "The Raiders March" [...] for a variety of compositions. The DOS version uses sequenced music played back by either an internal speaker, the FM synthesis of an AdLib or Sound Blaster sound card, or the sample-based synthesis of a Roland MT-32 sound module. During development of the game, William Messner-Loebs and Dan Barry wrote a Dark Horse Comics series based on Barwood's and Falstein's story, then titled Indiana Jones and the Keys to Atlantis. In an interview, Eaken mentioned hour-long meetings of the development team {{trying to come up with}} a better title than Fate of Atlantis, though the staff members could <b>never</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> one and always ended up with names such as [...] "Indiana Jones Does Atlantis". The final title was Barwood's idea, who first had to convince the company's management and the marketing team not to simply call the game [...] "Indy's Next Adventure".|$|E
500|$|Production Designer Allan Cameron found a {{dormant volcano}} near Erfoud where the entire set for Hamunaptra could be constructed. Sommers liked the {{location}} because, [...] "A city {{hidden in the}} crater of an extinct volcano made perfect sense. Out {{in the middle of}} the desert you would never see it. You would <b>never</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> entering the crater unless you knew what was inside that volcano." [...] A survey of the volcano was conducted so that an accurate model and scale models of the columns and statues could be replicated back at Shepperton Studios, where all of the scenes involving the underground passageways of the City of the Dead were shot. These sets took 16 weeks to build, and included fiberglass columns rigged with special effects for the movie's final scenes. Another large set was constructed in the United Kingdom on the dockyard at Chatham which doubled for the Giza Port on the River Nile. This set was [...] in length and featured [...] "a steam train, an Ajax traction engine, three cranes, an open two-horse carriage, four horse-drawn carts, five dressing horses and grooms, nine pack donkeys and mules, as well as market stalls, Arab-clad vendors and room for 300 costumed extras".|$|E

2500|$|The aerial {{campaign}} for Singapore {{began at the}} outset of the invasion of Malaya. Early on 8 December 1941, Singapore was bombed for the first time by long-range Japanese aircraft, such as the Mitsubishi G3M2 [...] "Nell" [...] and the Mitsubishi G4M1 [...] "Betty", based in Japanese-occupied Indochina. The bombers struck the city centre as well as the Sembawang Naval Base and the island's northern airfields. After this first raid, throughout the rest of December, there were a number of false alerts and several infrequent and sporadic hit-and-run attacks on outlying military installations such as the Naval Base, but no actual raids on Singapore City. The situation had become so desperate, that one British soldier took to the middle of a road to fire his Vickers machine gun at any aircraft that passed. He could only say: [...] "The bloody bastards will <b>never</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> looking for me in the open, and I want to see a bloody plane brought down." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Second Italo-Ethiopian War {{was to be}} Mussolini's way {{of making}} up for Italy's {{embarrassing}} defeat {{at the hands of}} the Ethiopians in the First Italo-Ethiopian War in 1896, and was also a chance to expand the Italian empire by taking one of the last regions of Africa not controlled by other European powers and divert the populace from economic woes. General Emilio de Bono put on record that preparations for the invasion of Ethiopia (Abyssinia) had been going on since 1932 as roads were being built from Italian Somaliland into Ethiopian territory, though Mussolini constantly claimed that he was not a [...] "collector of deserts" [...] and would <b>never</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> invading. Ethiopians protested this build-up to war which eventually led up to a border clash at Walwal. Mussolini called this clash [...] "unprovoked aggression" [...] by Ethiopia and Italian forces invaded on 3 October 1935, led by de Bono. In only three days the Italians had captured Adwa where the former disgraceful defeat had happened. In December Pietro Badoglio replaced de Bono as commander of the invasion because of de Bono's cautious advance. On 31 March 1936, a desperate final counter-attack by Haile Selassie, king of Ethiopia, was carried out, though word of the attack had already gotten to the Italians, giving them victory in the Battle of Maychew. Only a few days later the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa was conquered, allowing Italy to annex the country on 7 May, proclaiming Victor Emmanuel III Emperor of Ethiopia. Italy's East African possessions was unified into the colony of Italian East Africa.|$|E
