5|$|Many Lollards {{were still}} about, {{especially}} in London and the Thames Valley, in Essex and Kent, Coventry, Bristol {{and even in}} the North, who would be receptive to the new ideas when they came, who looked for a reform in the lifestyle of the clergy. They emphasised the preaching of the word over the sacrament of the altar, holding the latter to be but a memorial, but they were not party to the actions of the government. Other ideas, critical of the papal supremacy were held, not only by Lollards, but by those who wished to assert the supremacy of the secular state over the church but also by conciliarists such as Thomas More and, initially, Cranmer. Other Roman Catholic reformists, including John Colet, Dean of St Paul's, warned that heretics were <b>not</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>so</b> great a danger to the faith as the wicked and indolent lives of the clergy.|$|E
25|$|Another noted Loyalist later {{associated}} with the Cherokee, Thomas Brown, was <b>not</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>so</b> fortunate. In his home of Brownsborough, Georgia, near Augusta, he was assaulted by a crowd of the Sons of Liberty, tied to a tree, roasted with fire, scalped, tarred, and feathered. After his escape, he took up residence among the Seminole commanding his East Florida Rangers, who fought with them {{and some of the}} Lower Muskogee.|$|E
25|$|The Pali Text Society {{was founded}} in part to {{compensate}} for the very low level of funds allocated to Indology in late 19th-century England {{and the rest of the}} UK; incongruously, the citizens of the UK were <b>not</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>so</b> robust in Sanskrit and Prakrit language studies as Germany, Russia, and even Denmark. Even without the inspiration of colonial holdings such as the former British occupation of Sri Lanka and Burma, institutions such as the Danish Royal Library have built up major collections of Pali manuscripts, and major traditions of Pali studies.|$|E

25|$|Blown up by {{dynamite}} last night. It {{was intended}} to have fired the charges at 5 o'clock in the evening; but at that hour the sunken vessel was so thickly surrounded by boats, it was deemed inexpedient {{to proceed with the}} work, and 9 o'clock was decided upon. The knowledge that large numbers of fish would be thrown to the surface stunned by the shock influenced the attendance of small boats to a marked degree in the afternoon, and though there were <b>not</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>so</b> many at night the number was larger than was expected, and caution had to be observed.|$|E
25|$|However, from 1907 onwards Mead, at {{this stage}} an opening batsman, {{advanced}} very rapidly, with his average reaching 39 in the very wet summer of 1909. In 1911, he moved down the order to his familiar position of number four, and so successful was this move {{that he was the}} leading run-scorer in 1911 and 1913, and toured Australia in 1911/1912 and South Africa in 1913/1914. He was <b>not</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>so</b> successful as might have been expected in Australia, but in South Africa he hit a Test century and played particularly well throughout. In 1912 he had been unbeaten (160* and 33*) in Hampshire's historic win over the Australians at Southampton.|$|E
25|$|In {{temperate}} softwoods, there {{often is}} a marked difference between latewood and earlywood. The latewood will be denser than that formed {{early in the}} season. When examined under a microscope, the cells of dense latewood are seen to be very thick-walled and with very small cell cavities, while those formed first in the season have thin walls and large cell cavities. The strength is in the walls, not the cavities. Hence the greater the proportion of latewood, the greater the density and strength. In choosing a piece of pine where strength or stiffness is the important consideration, the principal thing to observe is the comparative amounts of earlywood and latewood. The width of ring is <b>not</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>so</b> important as the proportion {{and nature of the}} latewood in the ring.|$|E

25|$|Tests {{of general}} {{relativity}} on the largest scales are <b>not</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>so</b> stringent as Solar System tests. The earliest such test was prediction and discovery of {{the expansion of the}} universe. In 1922, Alexander Friedmann found that Einstein equations have non-stationary solutions (even {{in the presence of the}} cosmological constant). In 1927, Georges Lemaître showed that static solutions of the Einstein equations, which are possible in the presence of the cosmological constant, are unstable, and therefore the static universe envisioned by Einstein could not exist (it must either expand or contract). Lemaître made an explicit prediction that the universe should expand. He also derived a redshift-distance relationship, which is now known as the Hubble Law. Later, in 1931, Einstein himself agreed with the results of Friedmann and Lemaître. The expansion of the universe discovered by Edwin Hubble in 1929 was then considered by many (and continues to be considered by some now) as a direct confirmation {{of general relativity}}. In the 1930s, largely due to the work of E. A. Milne, it was realised that the linear relationship between redshift and distance derives from the general assumption of uniformity and isotropy rather than specifically from general relativity. However the prediction of a non-static universe was non-trivial, indeed dramatic, and primarily motivated by general relativity.|$|E
25|$|Like so many Nottinghamshire-born men, Albert Hallam took to cricket at {{an early}} age. However, as he developed, he was not seen as good enough for a regular place in the Nottinghamshire eleven and, already {{residing}} in Leicestershire, played for them {{for a number of}} years in the late 1880s and early 1890s. Though these matches were not first-class, Hallam acquired a good enough reputation for Lancashire, desperate for support for the seemingly irrepressible Mold and Briggs, to encourage Hallam to qualify. He steadily improved, and by 1896 Hallam's slow bowling was already providing Lancashire with a third force in attack. He actually beat Briggs in the averages and was only a fraction behind Mold, though he did less than half as much bowling as the two established bowlers. The following year, these three bowlers, together with the newly imported Willis Cuttell, gave Lancashire a deadly attack on any helpful wicket and they won the County Championship. Hallam bowled consistently well and in all matches just reached 100 wickets. Nevertheless Wisden and many batsmen thought he was <b>not</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>so</b> good as the other three bowlers because he was too regular on dry pitches and helped batsmen to play themselves in.|$|E
500|$|After {{seeing the}} show George Jean Nathan said, [...] "... {{it is my}} notion that this Veloz and Yolanda team is merely of the current average skill, <b>not</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>so</b> good as the De Marcos, that is, if it is Renée and not the present Sally who serves as Tony's partner, yet {{somewhat}} better {{than some of the}} couples publicized in the floor shows.|$|E

"Sire," [...] {{answered}} the Indian, {{to whom the}} proposal did <b>not</b> seem <b>nearly</b> <b>so</b> generous as it appeared to the king, [...] "I am most grateful to your Highness for your princely offer, and beseech you not to be offended with me if I say that I can only deliver up my horse {{in exchange for the}} hand of the princess your daughter." ...|$|R
500|$|Initially, Article 231 was not {{correctly}} translated. Rather than stating [...] "...Germany accepts {{responsibility of}} Germany and her allies causing all the loss and damage...", the German Government's edition read [...] "Germany admits it, that Germany and her allies, as {{authors of the}} war, are responsible for all losses and damages...". Germans felt that they the country had signed away her honor, {{and there was a}} prevailing belief of humiliation as the article was seen, overall, as an injustice. Historian Wolfgang Mommsen commented that despite the public outrage, German government officials were aware [...] "that Germany's position on this matter was <b>not</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>so</b> favorable as the imperial government had led the German public to believe during the war." ...|$|E
500|$|In his {{analysis}} of her reviews, Grenby comes to the conclusion [...] "Trimmer was ... <b>not</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>so</b> vitriolic in her reviewing as her reputation suggests.... fewer than 50 [...] were chiefly negative, and of these only 18 were thoroughly excoriating. These were easily outweighed by the positive notices, although most of her reviews were mixed or– more surprisingly given her reputation for always impassioned appraisal– ambivalent." [...] She objected primarily to texts that altered the Bible, such as William Godwin's Bible Stories (1802), and secondarily to books that promoted ideas she associated with the French Revolution. She also criticized the inclusion of scenes of death, characters who were insane, and representations of sexuality, as well as books that might frighten children. She typically praises books that encourage intellectual instruction, such as Anna Barbauld's Lessons for Children (1778–79).|$|E
500|$|In her writing, Frank {{examined}} her {{relationships with the}} members of her family, and the strong differences in each of their personalities. She considered herself to be closest emotionally to her father, who later commented, [...] "I got on better with Anne than with Margot, who was more attached to her mother. The reason for that may have been that Margot rarely showed her feelings and didn't need as much support because she didn't suffer from mood swings as much as Anne did." [...] The Frank sisters formed a closer relationship than had existed before they went into hiding, although Anne sometimes expressed jealousy towards Margot, particularly when members of the household criticized Anne for lacking Margot's gentle and placid nature. As Anne began to mature, the sisters were able to confide in each other. In her entry of 12 January 1944, Frank wrote, [...] "Margot's much nicer... She's <b>not</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>so</b> catty these days and is becoming a real friend. She no longer thinks of me as a little baby who doesn't count." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{apartheid}} system {{carried out}} by Afrikaner minority rule enacted a nationwide social policy [...] "separate development" [...] with the National Party victory in 1948, following the [...] "colour bar"-discriminatory legislation {{dating back to the}} beginning of the Union of South Africa and the Boer republics before which, while repressive to black South Africans along with other minorities, had <b>not</b> gone <b>nearly</b> <b>so</b> far.|$|R

500|$|The Moving Picture News and The Moving Picture World {{were both}} neutral in their {{review of the}} film, giving neither {{specific}} praise nor criticism of the production. The New York Dramatic Mirror review was positive: [...] "This idea has been used quite recently in an Independent film, but <b>not</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>so</b> effectively as {{in the hands of}} the capable Thanhouser players. They give the farcical events an air of reality that goes far to strengthen the comical results. ... She insists on her lover rigging himself up in knightly costume and carrying her off on a horse to be married. The absurdity of this business in modern times is not made as much of as might have been, but it brings plenty of laughter. The actress who played the part of the girl marred her work by turning too often to face the camera. She is very pretty and attractive but she should not permit it to appear that she is so well aware of her beauty." [...] Some advertisements by theaters heavily promoted the comedy aspect of the film with generic quips.|$|E
500|$|Stewart said, due to Max's {{past events}} with his family, what Abi might say when Max objects to her {{relationship}} with Jay, [...] "It won't be her setting a gerbil on him", calling her a [...] "goody-two-shoes". A writer from the Western Mail said that the Branning/Mitchell Feud makes Abi and Jay feel like [...] "Walford's answer to Romeo and Juliet". Two writers from the Daily Mirror mocked the storyline where Abi turns down the trip to Costa Rica. One said, [...] "An extreme case of soap agoraphobia as brilliant Abi sensibly turns down the chance to spend eight weeks in the tropical paradise of Costa Rica. But in the tiny micro-world of EastEnders, even the three-mile odyssey from Walford to the West End is considered an epic journey. So Central America is simply out of the question" [...] with another saying, [...] "Abi {{was a little girl}} arranging tearful funerals for her pets. But now she's a young teenager, secretly engaged to boyfriend Jay and planning to run away together. He then gives Abi an ultimatum: him or her trip to Costa Rica. Best pass her the suncream, then". However, Abi, along with the younger members of the cast were thought to be the blame of declining ratings for the show; [...] "In the last two months, viewers have seen lots of Lauren, Lucy Beale (Hetti Bywater), Whitney Dean (Shona McGarty), Fatboy (Ricky Norwood), Ben Jay, Abi and Anthony Moon (Matt Lapinskas) - but <b>not</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>so</b> much of the classic characters". Inside Soap noted that Abi and Jay's relationship was popular with viewers.|$|E
500|$|Roach was {{unsuccessful}} {{playing for}} Trinidad in 1932. His poor form led some critics {{to call for}} his exclusion from the West Indies team; he failed in a trial match in early 1933, but was picked to tour England during the 1933 season. The West Indies team did not perform as well as expected, and lost the Test series 2–0, and their batting was generally unsuccessful. After a slow start, Roach scored 67 against Hampshire then, in his next innings, 180 against Surrey in 170 minutes. In the latter innings, described by Wisden as the most dazzling innings on the tour, he scored a century before lunch. Wisden noted: [...] "The Surrey bowling on that occasion admittedly was moderate, but, at home from the very start, Roach cut, drove and hooked in a style seen only on very rare occasions." [...] After other substantial innings against County teams, he failed to score in either innings of the first Test. He was more successful {{in the other two}} Tests, scoring 64 in the second Test and 56 in the third, reaching fifty in 33 minutes during the latter innings. The Wisden report stated: [...] "If <b>not</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>so</b> sound as Headley, Roach was easily the best man in the team to watch, his batting on many occasions being brilliant to a degree. Nothing, indeed, in the whole tour was so dazzling as the innings of 180 Roach played against Surrey at the Oval". In total, Roach scored 1,286 runs at 25.72 in first-class matches to finish ninth in the team averages, and 141 runs at 23.50 in Tests. Wisden suggested that, had his defensive abilities matched the style of his strokeplay, he would have been more successful. A review in a Trinidad newspaper suggested that Roach was the [...] "best stroke maker" [...] in England during the 1933 season, but he was undependable when his side faced adverse circumstances. There were suggestions that Roach should have dropped down the batting order to counter his periods of poor form, but the captain, Jackie Grant, suggested that his aggressive approach made him an attraction and that he was happier opening the batting.|$|E
50|$|His Peapatch Politics: The Earl Long Era in Louisiana Politics is a {{political}} memoir from the 1940s to the 1970s. Dodd in time seemed to reach the conclusion that Louisiana did <b>not</b> benefit <b>nearly</b> <b>so</b> much from Longism and the constant corrupt practices {{as many of the}} Longites had always assumed. For the rest of his life, he regretted the consequences that stemmed from the rejection of the tidelands compromise that President Truman had offered in 1948.|$|R

5000|$|Rape, in many US states, {{before the}} 1970s, could incur capital punishment. The 1977 Supreme Court case of Coker v.
