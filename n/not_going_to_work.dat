40|$|Purpose: Exploring {{healthcare}} professional experiences of Multimodal rehabilitation (MMR) in primary care. Methods: Fourteen {{healthcare professional}}s (11 women, 3 men) were individually interviewed {{about their work}} with MMR in primary care. Interviews covered experiences of assessing patients and work with patients in the programme. Transcribed interviews were analysed by qualitative content analysis. Results: The analysis resulted in four categories: select patients for success; a multilevel challenge; ethical dilemmas and considering what is a good result. MMR work was experienced as useful and efficient, but also challenging because of patient complexity. Preconceptions about who is a suitable patient for MMR influenced the selection of patients (e. g. gender, different culture). Interviewees were conflicted about not {{to being able to}} offer MMR to patients who were <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> return <b>to</b> <b>work.</b> They thought that there were more factors to evaluate MMR than by the proportion that return <b>to</b> <b>work.</b> Conclusions: Healthcare professionals perceive MMR as a helpful method for treating chronic pain patients. At the same time, they thought that only including patients who would return <b>to</b> <b>work</b> conflicted with their ethical views on equal healthcare for all patients. Preconceptions can influence selection for, and work with, MMR. Funding Agencies|Swedish Social Insurance Agency, the research programme REHSAM</p...|$|R

It is in this spirit that it approaches the World Economic Conference." [...] Hugenberg objected to Neurath's speech under the grounds that he was <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> London <b>to</b> <b>work</b> for [...] "harmonious understanding" [...] between nations, but rather he was seeking to assert German interests in the most aggressive manner possible. Besides his sincere belief that Germany needed an empire in Africa and Eastern Europe to recover from the Great Depression, Hugenberg's major reason for putting forth his imperialist programme at the London Economic Conference was that by late May 1933 the DNF was being increasingly persecuted by its nominal Nazi allies, and Hugenberg believed that if he could score an outstanding success in foreign policy, then Hitler would end the persecution of his party. Hugenberg believed that the case for German imperialism as a way of ending the Great Depression not just in Germany, but all over the world was so compelling that he could convert the other delegates at World Economic Conference to his way of thinking. On 16 June 1933 Hugenberg released the [...] "Hugenberg memorandum" [...] to the press in London, and set off a media storm. The Soviet government put forth a diplomatic note protesting against Hugenberg's idea that the Soviet Union was a backward country ripe for German colonization, while the British and French governments protested against Hugenberg's demand that they should just hand over all their colonies in Africa to Germany. The leaders {{of the rest of the}} German delegation in London comprising Neurath, the Reichsbank president Hjalmar Schacht and the Finance minister Lutz Graf Schwerin von Krosigk had not been consulted about the [...] "Hugenberg Memorandum" [...] and felt Hugenberg's approach to foreign policy had made him into an embarrassment.|$|R
