5|$|After {{the opening}} {{game of the}} 2009 season, Blount was {{suspended}} for punching a Boise State University opponent and angrily confronting fans after the <b>nationally</b> <b>televised</b> season-opening loss. Though the suspension was announced {{to be for the}} remainder of the season, due to his meeting of specific criteria set by the football staff, he was eventually reinstated after missing eight games.|$|E
25|$|On January 31, 1953, the New York Yankees, Cleveland Indians and Boston Red Sox {{joined forces}} against St. Louis Browns owner Bill Veeck. The {{respective}} franchises {{tried to force}} the Browns to play afternoon games {{in an attempt to}} avoid having to share television revenues. A month later, Major League Baseball owners received a warning from Senator Edwin Johnson about <b>nationally</b> <b>televising</b> their games. Johnson's theory was that <b>nationally</b> <b>televising</b> baseball games would be a threat to the survival of minor league baseball. The owners pretty much ignored Johnson since the games on NBC in particular, were gaining a large and loyal following.|$|R
50|$|It {{remains the}} only Super Bowl to have been {{simulcast}} in the United States by two networks: NBC had the rights to <b>nationally</b> <b>televise</b> AFL games, while CBS held the rights to broadcast NFL games; both networks were allowed to televise the game. The first Super Bowl's entertainment consisted of college marching bands from the University of Arizona and Grambling State University, instead of featuring popular singers and musicians as in more recent Super Bowls.|$|R

The university's academic quality and student quality also have improved as a result. During Shalala's {{leadership of the}} University of Miami, Miami hosted one of three <b>nationally</b> <b>televised</b> U.S. presidential debates of the 2004 U.S. Presidential election.|$|E
5|$|On February 15, 1993, Clinton {{made his}} first address to the nation, announcing his plan to raise taxes to close a budget deficit. Two days later, in a <b>nationally</b> <b>televised</b> address to {{a joint session of}} Congress, Clinton {{unveiled}} his economic plan. The plan focused on reducing the deficit rather than on cutting taxes for the middle class, which had been high on his campaign agenda. Clinton's advisers pressured him to raise taxes, based on the theory that a smaller federal budget deficit would reduce bond interest rates.|$|E
50|$|The {{first ever}} AFL-NFL World Championship Game was played on January 15, 1967 between the NFL {{champion}} Packers and the AFL champion Chiefs. As CBS held {{the rights to}} <b>nationally</b> <b>televise</b> NFL games and NBC had the rights to broadcast AFL matches, {{it was decided that}} both would cover that first game. The next three AFL-NFL World Championship Games, the initial Super Bowls, were then divided by the two networks: CBS broadcast Super Bowls II and IV while NBC covered III.|$|R

5|$|Flanders {{was noted}} for {{introducing}} a 1954 {{motion in the}} Senate to censure Senator Joseph McCarthy. McCarthy had made sensational claims that there were large numbers of Communists and Soviet spies and sympathizers inside {{the federal government and}} elsewhere. He used his Senate committee as a <b>nationally</b> <b>televised</b> forum for attacks on individuals whom he accused. Flanders felt that McCarthy’s attacks distracted the nation from a much greater threat of Communist successes elsewhere in the world and that they had the effect of creating division and confusion within the United States, to the advantage of its enemies. Ultimately, McCarthy's tactics and his inability to substantiate his claims led to his being discredited and censured by the United States Senate.|$|E
5|$|Following the shooting, American and {{international}} politicians expressed grief and condemnations. Gun control advocates pushed for increased {{restrictions on the}} sale of firearms and ammunition, specifically high-capacity ammunition magazines. Some commentators criticized the use of harsh political rhetoric in the United States, with a number blaming the political right wing for the shooting; in particular, Sarah Palin was criticized for a poster by her political action committee that featured stylized crosshairs on an electoral map. Palin rejected claims that she bore responsibility for the shooting, and others defended her by noting that Loughner hated all politicians regardless of their affiliation. President Barack Obama led a <b>nationally</b> <b>televised</b> memorial service on January 12, and other memorials took place.|$|E
5|$|On October 2, No. 9 Stanford played No. 4 Oregon. The {{game was}} {{touted as a}} matchup {{between two of the}} top offenses in college {{football}} and was <b>nationally</b> <b>televised.</b> Stanford led 21–3 after the first quarter and 31–24 at halftime, but the Cardinal allowed 28 unanswered points in the second half and lost to Oregon, 52–31. Oregon later went on to play in the BCS National Championship game, and the defeat was Stanford's only one of the season. The loss dropped Stanford to No. 16 in the polls, but the team rebounded the following week to defeat USC on a last-second field goal, 37–35.|$|E

5|$|The Browns {{continued}} to succeed {{upon entering the}} NFL in 1950, winning the championship that year and reaching the title game in both 1951 and 1952. In January 1951, McBride testified in <b>nationally</b> <b>televised</b> hearings before the Kefauver Committee, where he was questioned about his Continental Press Service and alleged ties to organized crime and illegal gambling. It emerged that McBride partnered with Cleveland police captain John Fleming in real estate deals and had Fleming on the Yellow Cab payroll until 1941. McBride denied the mafia connections, claimed he never broke the law and was never charged with any crime. Congress later passed legislation making such wire services illegal.|$|E
5|$|Claire's main storyline {{in season}} 2 is her advocacy, as Second Lady, for {{a sexual assault}} {{prevention}} bill. During her campaign for the bill a skeleton from her college days emerges: during a <b>nationally</b> <b>televised</b> interview, she admits that she was raped in college and that her rapist, Dalton McGinnis (Peter Bradbury), is now a high-ranking general. (She had earlier had an uncomfortable encounter with McGinnis at a White House dinner, during which she had told Frank what the general had done to her.) She also admits to having aborted a pregnancy that she claims {{was the result of}} the rape; it is later revealed that she in fact aborted Frank's child, with his consent. She then converts the focus on that issue into political support that becomes critical to the Underwoods' ascension to the Oval Office.|$|E

50|$|This game is {{the only}} Super Bowl to have been {{broadcast}} in the United States by two television networks simultaneously (no other NFL game was subsequently carried nationally {{on more than one}} network until December 29, 2007, when the New England Patriots faced the New York Giants on NBC, CBS, and the NFL Network). At the time, NBC held the rights to <b>nationally</b> <b>televise</b> AFL games while CBS had the rights to broadcast NFL games. Both networks were allowed to cover the game. During the week, tensions flared between the staffs of the two networks (longtime arch-rivals in American broadcasting), who each wanted to win the ratings war, to the point where a fence was built between the CBS and NBC trucks.|$|R

5|$|In 1987, {{the media}} speculated that Clinton {{would enter the}} Presidential race after {{incumbent}} New York Governor Mario Cuomo declined to run and Democratic front-runner Gary Hart withdrew owing to revelations of marital infidelity. Clinton decided to remain as Arkansas governor (following consideration for the potential candidacy of Hillary Rodham Clinton for governor, initially favored—but ultimately vetoed—by the First Lady). For the nomination, Clinton endorsed Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis. He gave the <b>nationally</b> <b>televised</b> opening night address at the 1988 Democratic National Convention, but his speech, which was 33 minutes long and {{twice as long as}} it was expected to be, was criticized for being too long and poorly delivered. Clinton presented himself as both a moderate and a member of the New Democrat wing of the Democratic Party, and he headed the moderate Democratic Leadership Council in 1990 and 1991.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech {{began the}} 1984 season under head coach Bill Dooley, {{who at the}} time was the winningest coach in Tech history. In 1983, the Hokies had gone 92, with one of the two losses coming at the hands of No. 9 West Virginia in a <b>nationally</b> <b>televised</b> game. Tech began the 1984 season with a win against Wake Forest, but {{followed}} that by a loss against West Virginia {{in one of the most}} contentious college football rivalries in the country at that time. In the two weeks that followed, Tech continued to alternate wins and losses, reaching an overall record of 22 by the end of the fourth week of the season. Tech's fortunes took a turn for the better during the latter portion of the season, however, as the Hokies proceeded to win six of their final seven games before earning a bid to the 1984 Independence Bowl.|$|E
5|$|In {{her first}} year in Delta State, Harris helped the Lady Statesmen to a 16–2 record. However, they {{finished}} third in the regional tournament and failed to qualify to the national tournament. The following year, the Lady Statesmen qualified to the national tournament at Harrisonburg, Virginia. They {{went all the way to}} the final where they met the Mighty Macs of Immaculata University who had won the last three consecutive AIAW championships. In the final, Harris scored 32 points and recorded 16 rebounds to lead Delta State past Immaculata 90–81. The 1975 championship game was televised nationally (albeit delayed). This is the first year that women's basketball games were <b>nationally</b> <b>televised</b> by a major network. That season, Delta State went undefeated in with a 28–0 record, the only undefeated college season that year (men or women). Harris scored a total of 138 points and 63 rebounds in four games at the national tournament and was named as the tournament's most valuable player.|$|E

5|$|Just after 9:00 PM CST (0300 UTC), a {{supercell}} {{that had}} spawned tornadoes over northern Mississippi {{as well as}} a deadly EF4 in Hardin County, Tennessee, moved to the northeast over Nashville. Fortunately, no tornadoes were reported there and no significant damage was reported in Nashville or Davidson County, though funnel clouds were sighted during the storm's passage. At the time the supercell moved over Nashville, a National Hockey League game between the Nashville Predators and the Carolina Hurricanes, which was <b>nationally</b> <b>televised</b> on Versus, was being played at the Sommet Center. With just over nine minutes left in the third period, Predators head coach Barry Trotz was told that the game may have to be stopped. Although the game continued to completion, at the game's end fans were not allowed to leave the arena until the storm had passed. National Weather Service Meteorologist Bobby Boyd theorized that cold air downbursts impinged on the development of a strong, low-level circulation as the storm moved through the Nashville area, forcing the area of rotation to remain aloft as it crossed over Davidson County and downtown Nashville.|$|E
5|$|The Virginia Tech Hokies {{entered the}} 2010 season after a 2009 {{campaign}} {{that saw the}} team finish 10–3, including a season-ending win in the 2009 Chick-fil-A Bowl against the Tennessee Volunteers. Because of that season-ending victory and the Hokies' general good performance during the 2009 season, Virginia Tech was ranked No. 10 in preseason national polling. The Hokies' {{first game of the}} season was a <b>nationally</b> <b>televised</b> contest against then-No. 3 Boise State at FedExField near Washington, D.C.. Because the game {{was the first of the}} season to feature two top-10 teams, it received large amounts of media coverage. During the game, Virginia Tech fell behind 17–0 in the first quarter, but rallied to take a 21–20 lead early in the third quarter. The two teams traded the lead, alternating scoring drives until Boise State scored a touchdown with 1:06 remaining. Virginia Tech was unable to reply one final time, and Boise State earned a 33–30 victory.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{his senior}} year, James and the Fighting Irish {{traveled}} {{around the country to}} play a number of nationally ranked teams, including a game against Oak Hill Academy that was <b>nationally</b> <b>televised</b> on ESPN2. Time Warner Cable, looking to capitalize on James' popularity, offered St. Vincent-St. Mary's games to subscribers on a pay-per-view basis throughout the season. For the year, James averaged 31.6 points, 9.6 rebounds, 4.6 assists, and 3.4 steals per game, was named Ohio Mr. Basketball and selected to the USA Today All-USA First Team for an unprecedented third consecutive year, and was named Gatorade National Player of the Year for the second consecutive year. He participated in three year-end high school basketball all-star games—the EA Sports Roundball Classic, the Jordan Capital Classic, and the McDonald's All-American Game—losing his National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) eligibility and making it official that he would enter the 2003 NBA draft. Many basketball analysts, scouts, and writers have remarked that James left high school {{as one of the best}} and most hyped prospects of all-time.|$|E
