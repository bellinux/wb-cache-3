40|$|Abstract: Previous {{studies have}} shown that the {{activities}} of the hepatic enzymes xanthine dehydrogenase and nucleoside phosphorylase, as well as the uric acid excreted, can be used to determine the quality of the protein consumed in chickens, in a short time and using a small amount of the test protein. A common observation in protein quality evaluation is that the food intake of the control animals is considerably greater than that observed in those receiving proteins of low quality. Since this can aect the results, this study measured the quality of garbanzo bean and black bean proteins in chickens fed these beans ad libitum, feeding the bean diets at the level observed in the controls (soy protein] methionine) by enteral intubation or pair feeding the controls with the amount of food consumed by the chickens receiving the bean diets.

Pea seeds also contained non-nutritive compounds such as α-galactosides (4 g/ 100 g), phytic acid (0. 4 g/ 100 g) and trypsin inhibitor activity (2 TIU/mg). Extrusion cooking caused a slight increase of protein and fat content, whilst it reduced dietary fibre, thiamine and α-galactosides, and led to negligible trypsin inhibitor activity (TIA) levels. The protein quality of pea measured by biological indexes (<b>net</b> <b>protein</b> <b>utilisation,</b> net protein ratio, relative net protein ratio, true protein digestibility and biological value) was not affected by extrusion treatments. Protein quality measured by chemical indexes (chemical score and protein digestibility corrected amino acid score) decreased in processed peas.

Fish were fed 5 % of their body weight per day adjusted fortnightly. Diet 1, containing 10 % carbohydrate and 17 % lipids with a CHO:L ratio of 0. 60 produced the poorest (p< 0. 05) growth rates, feed and protein efficiency. Increasing carbohydrate content in the diets to 26 % concomitant with a reduction in lipid content to 11 % with a CHO:L ration of 2. 29 of diet 5 significantly improved (p< 0. 05) growth rates, feed and protein efficiency.

40|$|The {{available}} {{literature on}} abalone nutrition was synthesised {{and the prospects}} for developing a complete pelleted dry feed for Haliotis midae evaluated. The similar body compositions, digestive structures, enzyme activity, acceptance {{of a wide variety}} of feed ingredients and comparable growth performance on formulated diets of various abalone species suggests that they have similar nutritional requirements. Abalone also appear to be similar to other farmed monogastric animals in that digestion is primarily extracelluar and they possess a large, muscular crop and stomach. Abalone energy metabolism is carbohydrate based. They are capable of digesting high levels of dietary protein but their ability to utilise fat is limited. Abalone have been shown to consume predictable amounts of dry feed which is efficiently converted into body weight. Efficiency indices of utilisation of formulated feeds, such as feed conversion ratio, protein efficiency ratio, <b>net</b> <b>protein</b> <b>utilisation</b> and apparent digestibility have been successfully applied to abalone. It was concluded that the prospects for developing complete diets for H. midae using a conventional animal feed science model were good. The ability of H. midae to utilise a range of proteins which had potential for inclusion in practical diets was investigated. Five protein rich ingredients, namely, casein, fishmeal, soya oil cake, Spirulina, and torula yeast, were fed to H. midae in semi-purified diets. Two algal diets, fresh Plocamium corallorhiza and dried Ecklonia maxima were fed as controls. Abalone fed on fishmeal and Spirulina based diets displayed significantly higher growth rates than diets containing soya oil cake, torula yeast, casein and E. maxima. Growth rates of abalone fed with P. corallorhiza were significantly lower than all other diets. All artificial diets yield lower feed conversion ratios (0. 7 - 1. 8) and higher protein efficiency ratios (3. 3 - 6. 5) ratios than the seaweed control diets (FCR = 2. 8 - 3. 4; PER = 2. 2 - 3. 0). The results indicated that fishmeal and Spirulina were the most suitable proteins for inclusion in practical diets for H. midae. The effect of protein level on growth rate and nutritional indices was evaluated by feeding starch bound, fishmeal based diets containing 27, 32, 37, 42 and 47 % protein to juvenile H. midae. Weight gain was positively related to the level of dietary protein, increasing by 18 % between 27 % and 47 % protein. Protein efficiency ratio declining from 3. 2 to 2. 3 with an increasing dietary protein content. Feed consumption rate was approximately 1 % of body weight per day for all diets. Post-weaning abalone (ca. lOmm shell length, 0. 2 g) differed from larger juveniles (ca. 35 mm, 8 g) in their response to varying proportions of dietary protein and energy. The smaller animals appeared to have a lower protein requirement and poorer ability to utilise lipid than the larger juveniles. Proximate analyses revealed that the levels of protein, lipid and carbohydrate in abalone soft tissue increased with increasing dietary levels of these nutrients. Larger juveniles contained significantly higher levels of protein and carbohydrate, but lower levels of lipid, ash and moisture, than the smaller post-weaning abalone. The assimilation efficiency of [U-¹⁴C]-arginine by H. midae fed diets enriched with [U-¹⁴C]-arginine was only 0. 45 %. Furthennore, supplementation of diets with graded levels of crystalline arginine did not have any effect on growth rates. It was concluded that the prospects for defining the quantitative amino acid requirements of H. midae using crystalline amino acids are not promising. Rates of gastric evacuation and enzyme secretion were monitored in juvenile H. midae fed an extruded, fishmeal based dry feed. Gut fullness peaked 6 h after feed was offered and the bulk of feed consumed was digested within 24 h. Enzyme secretion appeared to begin with the onset of feeding and continued for at least 6 h after peak gut fullness was attained. Protease activity increased significantly following ingestion but amylase activity was maintained at a more or less constant level. A low level of lipase activity was observed suggesting that the ability of H. midae to digest fat is limited. The growth rate of H. midae fed an extruded, fishmeal based feed increased with increasing temperature between 12 °C and 20 °C. Between 20 °C and 24 °C a marked decline in growth rate accompanied by a deterioration in feed conversion and increased mortality was observed. Consumption of a dry pelleted feed was shown to be a function of body size and temperature. Based on these data a model which predicts a daily ration for H. midae was developed. The present study showed that H. midae efficiently utilises extruded dry feeds containing conventional feed ingredients. Although technical difficulties were encountered in measuring apparent digestibility, it was concluded that the prospects for developing practical diets according to established nutritional principles are promising...|$|E

In the test diet insect meal replaced almost 50 % of the fishmeal. The whole experiment was conducted under practical conditions on an organically certified rainbow trout farm in Switzerland. Fish of initially 66. 5 ± 2. 3 g body weight were grown to 125 ± 4. 5 g and assessed for their growth performance, as well as analysed for their proximate composition, feed conversion ratio, fatty acid contents and organoleptic properties. Improved lipid <b>utilisation</b> and decreased <b>protein</b> <b>utilisation</b> were observed in fish fed the HIM diet. Furthermore, in a controlled degustation no differences except a slightly darker coloration of fish fed HIM were observed. The experiment demonstrated that substantial replacement of fishmeal by insect meal is possible without compromising growth, feed conversion and product quality.

40|$|Merged with {{duplicate}} record (10026. 1 / 1967) on 03. 01. 2017 by CS (TIS) The {{current status of}} global aquaculture production was reviewed with a special emphasis on Africa and in particular Egypt. The main species {{of interest in this}} study were tilapia Oreochromis niloticus and African catfish Clarias gariepinus which are gaining popularity and are of considerable importance in the market of farmed fish in this continent and of economic relevance to Egypt and other Middle Eastern countries. Research was principally directed to establishing the suitability of specific feed ingredients and materials that could be included in balanced diets for both species. Various animal and plant by-products were selected to evaluate their nutritional value for either species. The experimental protocols, materials and methods and techniques employed are described for nutritional investigations with tropical freshwater fish. These included the various parameters assessed in the growth and digestibility studies relevant to the species in question. These include Specific Growth Rates (SGR), Feed Conversion Ratios (FCR), Protein Efficiency Ratio (PER) and Apparent <b>Net</b> <b>Protein</b> <b>Utilisation</b> (ANPU). An initial investigation to determine the coefficients of digestibility of protein, amino acids and energy was first undertaken using tilapia as the model warmwater fish species. This investigation was able to provide useful data and information as a prelude for successive growth trials with both tilapia and catfish. Fishmeal, soyabean meal, corn gluten meal, poultry by-products including feathermeal and blood meal were all tested at a variety of inclusion levels in successive trials. Apparent digestibility coefficients (ADC %) for tilapia fed diets containing 60 % LT 94 fishmeal and 40 % of each ingredient are reported. ADC of dry matter (DM) and protein (CP) and energy (E) for the reference fishmeal diet were 83. 99 DM; 92. 60 CP; and 93. 31 E respectively. For each test ingredient, these values were as follows; 1 - PBM (56. 99 DM; 69. 30 CP & 73. 47 E), 2 - Feathermeal (54. 09 DM, 45. 53 CP & 49. 11 E), 3 - Blood meal (76. 13 DM; 85. 79 CP and 75. 96 E), 4 - Solvent extracted soyabean meal (85. 83 DM; 93. 46 CP & 82. 16 E), 4 - Full fat soyabean meal (75. 86 DM; 86. 99 CP & 74. 84 E). The amino acid availability coefficients reflected the same trends as protein digestibility, and these varied from > 87 % on average for the essential amino acids in fishmeal, 83 % for maize gluten and 85 % for solvent extracted soyabean meal with an average of 63 % for feathermeal and only 61 % for poultry meat meal. The importance of plant protein sources and especially soyabean meal was the focus of a complete nutritional study with juvenile tilapia, The influence of full fat soyabean meal (FFSB) inclusion on growth performance, feed utilisation and the gastrointestinal digestive enzymes was also measured in this experiment. It was found that soyabean meal levels above 50 % could reduce growth performance and adversely affect gut enzyme activities. Tilapia fed a series of diets with FFSB (58, 63 and 63 % + DLmethionine did not perform as well as the control group. SGR values ranged between 2. 42 to 2. 12, and ANPU between 39. 41 - 34. 46. Supplementation of the diet with methionine did not restore performance. Hepatic trypsin and amylase enzyme activity was affected with FFSB (from 12. 64 - 1. 43 Units and 4. 99 - 2. 76 Units respectively). No affects were detected on general proteolytic activity for stomach, intestine and liver. For studies with African catfish, it was first necessary to assess the different grades of fishmeal that could be employed in suitable reference diets for this species. A Poultry by-product meal (PBM) was further evaluated as a fishmeal replacement source (0 - 100 %) for this species. Catfish fed dry and wet diets of two types of fishmeal showed significant differences in growth performance. Catfish fed dry diets performed better than those receiving wet diets for both LT 94 and white fishmeal sources. SGR were (2. 80 and 2. 75 dry) and (2. 46 and 2. 57 wet). FCR (0. 97 and 0. 80 dry) and (1. 30, 1. 30 wet), ANPU (41. 85, 52. 94 dry) and (31. 43, 30. 9 wet) for LT 94 and White fishmeal respectively. The PBM fed catfish showed significant differences in weight gain and feed utilisation. SGR was between 3. 57 to 2. 83, FCR between 1. 61 to 2. 25 and ANPU fell from 28. 90 to 18. 82 for groups' fed the control fishmeal diet towards the maximum level of PBM substitution. Histological examination of liver tissue showed alterations in hepatic morphology with respect to sinusoids and fat accumulation for catfish fed higher amounts of PBM. A restricted inclusion of up to 40 % poultry by-product meal could therefore be suggested for practical diet formulations. Further investigations were undertaken to assess the potential for either maize gluten meal (MG) or soyabean meal as substitute protein sources for the African catfish Catfish fed higher inclusions of MG displayed SGR's ranging between 5. 28 to 2. 79, FCR between 0. 81 to 1. 53 and ANPU values from 52. 33 to 24. 99 %. All lower performance data were obtained for 75 % MG substitution of LT 94 fishmeal protein. Further histological examination of liver tissue revealed alterations in hepatic structure associated with higher levels of MG. It was suggested that no more than 25 % substitution of fishmeal with maize gluten meal is feasible under the present conditions. In a separate study, catfish fed diets containing different levels of FFSB (58, 63 and 63 % + DL-methionine) at the expense of fishmeal (LT 94), showed significant differences in weight gain. SGR ranged between 3. 11 to 2. 78, FCR 0. 82 - 0. 83 and ANPU between 54. 48 to 48. 60. Also trypsin activities for intestine ranged between 2. 75 to 1. 71 Units, liver 1. 37 to 1. 05 Units and stomach 4. 09 to 2. 29 Units of activity for increasing levels of FFSB. Hepatic amylase was also reduced from 4. 49 to 2. 46 Units. General proteolytic activities however, did not show any significant differences between catfish fed different levels of FFSB for the stomach, intestine and liver. The conclusions from each of the nutritional trials were considered and comparisons between the response of tilapia and catfish were made. The advantages of plant based protein concentrates was stressed due to the problems currently existing for animal sources and the expense of fishmeal There were many similarities for the tilapia and catfish and it would seem that both fish species could greatly benefit from improved diet formulations that may meet with their nutritional requirements whilst minimising cost of production. A future strategy of research is presented that includes further work to identify more feed ingredients for potential use in these species...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} the nutrition, growth and {{production}} of C. destructor was examined. Selected nutritional requirements of juvenile animals were determined under controlled conditions {{with the aim of}} developing a pelleted diet for use in hatcheries, nurseries and growout situations. The best developed diet was assessed for its potential as a supplementary feed for animals cultured in earthen environments. The protein requirements were first determined simultaneously with an evaluation of the effect of replacing animal protein (fishmeal) by soybean meal. Juveniles were reared communally for 59 d on isoenergetic diets containing 15 - 30 % protein and graded levels of soybean meal (0 - 60 %, of protein). When soybean meal was included at a level of 40 - 60 %, growth was reduced relative to that achieved with control diets containing 15 % and 20 % protein, but {{this was not the case}} at a 20 % soybean meal substitution level. A two-way interaction occurred between dietary protein and soybean meal content. Higher protein feeds enabled higher soybean meal inclusion levels without significantly affecting growth. Protein increases of 5 % produced better growth at the 40 % and 60 % soybean meal substitution levels. This effect was less pronounced in the control and the 20 % soybean meal diets. Carcass %protein increased and %lipid decreased as dietary protein increased. A similar effect occurred by increasing the soybean meal level to 60 %. No obvious trend in carcass moisture, energy, and ash occurred. A protein requirement of 30 % was apparent when fish meal and soybean meal were included in diets at levels of 20 % and 24 % (dry matter) respectively. Alternative protein sources to soybean meal were subsequently identified. Juveniles were maintained for 12 weeks on isoenergetic diets containing 30 % protein and differing in the primary source of protein used, with meat, snail, soybean, yabby, and zooplankton meals comprising the major protein ingredient. No significant difference occurred in mean weight (MW), percentage weight gain (%WG), SGR or survival among diets. Food conversion ratios (FCR) were low, with a minimum value of 0. 95 for the snail-based diet. The apparent <b>net</b> <b>protein</b> <b>utilisation</b> (ANPU) varied from 29. 6 % (zooplankton-based diet) to 41. 2 % (snail-based diet). Carcass composition varied with diet, with the greatest difference occurring in carapace colour. Animals fed the zooplankton-based diet developed the strongest, most natural pigmentation. A new combination of previously used protein-based ingredients was subsequently tested with reference to two yabby species, Cherax albidus and Cherax destructor, that were grown simultaneously in identical conditions. Juvenile male animals were reared individually for 20 weeks on isoenergetic diets containing 15 % or 30 % protein with fish meal, soybean meal, yabby meal and wheat products forming the basis of the diets. C albidus grew the fastest and utilised the food the most effectively. Carcass composition was influenced by diet with the 30 % protein diet resulting in an increase in carcass protein and ash and a decrease in carcass lipid and energy relative to the low protein diet. Carcass moisture and calcium were not affected by diet. The intermoult period (IP) was highly dependent on the premoult weight (W) but the mean moult increment (WI, as weight) was independent of the PM. The orbital carapace length (OCL) and the abdominal length (ABL) %moult increments generally declined with an increase in PM whereas the propus length (PL) %moult increment generally increased. The IP, WI, %OCL, %ABL, and %PL moult increments varied according to diet and to species. Elevated dietary protein caused a reduction to the IP (for similar sized animals) by 11 d and 7 d and an increase to the WI by 85 % and 81 % in C. albidus and C destructor respectively. Dietary induced morphological changes also occurred. Animals of a standard OCL (both species) had significantly larger abdomens when fed the higher protein diet. Growth on the best developed diet was compared to the growth obtained on a natural diet of freshwater zooplankton. Juveniles were reared individually for 12 weeks on the two diets. The MW, %WG and SGR were higher for the zooplankton diet. Carcass composition was influenced by diet and the zooplankton fed animals had a higher carcass %protein, %lipid, %ash and %fibre content and were more richly pigmented than animals fed pellets. The IP and the WI were highly dependent on the PM and varied according to diet; feeding with zooplankton reduced the IP by 1. 2 days and increased the WI by 13. 7 % compared to pellets. Nutrient digestibility was determined for the pelleted diets evaluated in the growth trials. Protein digestibility (PD) and dry matter digestibility (DMD), using chromic oxide (Cr 2 O 3) as an exogenous marker, were high for all diets, at around 93 % and 83 % respectively. Ash digestibility varied considerably from 17 % to 73 % for the snail and yabby meal diets respectively. Crude fibre digestibility was around 50 % and probably indicates cellulase activity. Alternative markers to Cr 2 O 3 were evaluated. Ash was considered to be the most suitable alternative to Cr 2 O 3, providing a reasonable, albeit lower, estimate of nutrient digestibility. Cr 2 O 3 and ash were preferentially excreted whereas fibre was retained in the digestive system for a longer period, consequently, the collection of a particular fraction of the deposited faeces (late or early) substantially affected the digestibility coefficients. In earthen-based environments, animals fed the best developed diet were compared to animals cultured using a forage crop of clover (Trifolium repens). Three supplementary feeding strategies representing varying levels of management intensity were evaluated in a series of trials conducted in ponds and pond microcosms. Growth on pellets consistently exceeded that obtained with the forage crop, with final MW being 67 - 159 % higher than that using clover and appeared to be the result of direct pellet consumption and from a pellet fertiliser effect (on the sediment). Within-pond DMD and PD were high and similar for each treatment (DMD = 51 - 58 %; PD = 89 - 92 %). In the control pond, DMD and PD increased with each successive flood. The faecal egestion rate (PER) decreased with each successive flood in all ponds, and is negatively related to animal weight and to foregut fullness (FF) according to power curves. FF was consistently lowest in the control pond. Mean FF was 48. 5 %, 62. 3 %, and 26. 7 % for the pellet, crop and control ponds respectively. FF increased to the third flood in each pond. The foregut protein content was high in all samples and the mean values were 33. 9 %, 32. 7 % and 35. 6 % for the pellet, crop and control ponds respectively. Foregut ash was highly variable within each pond and is inversely related to the foregut protein content. In the control and pellet ponds the highest foregut ash content occurred during flood 1. The culture system (aquaria or pond) strongly influenced the composition of the foregut content. The foregut of animals fed the manufactured diet (B 2) in ponds contained approximately 176 % more ash and 5 % more protein than the foregut of animals fed in bare-bottom tanks. The FF of the tank fed animals was approximately 45 % higher than the FF of pond fed animals after a similar feeding period. Base-line yields for extensive production systems appeared to be around 400 kg ha- 1. The supplementary addition of T. repens produced yields of approximately 635 kg ha- 1 (in ponds) to around 1086 kg ha- 1 (in tanks). The sequential addition of cut-clover to tanks stimulated growth to levels approaching those achieved on pellets. Yabbies stocked into ponds at 15 - 20 m- 2 with a mean weight of 2. 67 g and fed a 30 % protein pelleted diet for 100 d, resulted in a yield of approximately 1117 kg ha- 1, but only 2 % of the population were above a marketable size of 50 g. The feed utilisation indices were better for animals reared on pellets in bare-bottom tanks than in earthen environments, indicating some degree of pellet wastage when natural feeds are simultaneously present. High apparent food conversion ratios and low protein efficiency ratios occurred when the forage crop was provided. A considerable quantity of the dry matter and protein content of the forage crop was either inefficiently utilised or directed into other production pathways. Sowing a forage crop into pond microcosms to which a pelleted diet was also provided, did not enhance growth performance. Pelleted feed inputs at a rate of approximately 129 g m- 2 to 198 g m- 2 (dry matter) and 38 g - 2 to 64 g m- 2 (protein) over 70 - 100 d resulted in acceptable growth and feed utilisation indices for animals reared in ponds and pond microcosms. Forage crop inputs of approximately 533 g m- 2 to 680 g m- 2 (as dry matter) or 84 g m- 2 to 177 g m- 2 (as protein) over a 70 - 100 d period produced reasonable growth rates but poor feed utilisation indices. Low inputs of dry matter (from 113 - 296 g m- 2) and protein (from 24 - 54 g m- 2) from clover were sufficient to maintain high growth rates in pond microcosms for around 28 d. In ponds, a very low level of 21 g m- 2 (dry matter) and 4. 3 g m- 2 (protein) was sufficient for around 3 weeks. Forage depletion appeared to occur beyond week 3 - 4 and was probably a major growth limiting factor. The mean hepatosomatic index (HSI) was 9. 44, 7. 68, and 6. 79 for the pellet, crop, and control ponds respectively. The relationship between hepatopancreas weight and overall animal weight was significantly different between treatments. The hepatopancreas of pellet-fed animals had the highest %lipid and lowest %ash, %protein, %carbohydrate and %moisture content. In terms of absolute quantities, the only major difference in hepatopancreas composition between treatments occurred for lipid and dry matter content. The hepatopancreas of the pellet-fed animals was a cream/cream-yellow colour and was very fragile, whereas in the other ponds it was a more ‘natural’ bright yellow colour and was structurally more robust. C. destructor has a capacious foregut, being approximately 5 times the volume of similar sized Penaeids. The foregut volume (V, ml) of the yabby is related to animal weight (W, g) according to V = 0. 048 W 0. 9543. Animals that were starved for 96 h and then fed diet B 2 were almost completely foil after 30 min. The ‘apparent enzymatic response’ of animals fed various natural and artificial diets in tanks was evaluated. Nutrient processing time and the enzymatic response following ingestion appeared to be regulated by the chemical and physical properties of the diet. For the natural feeds, foregut protein was 1. 2 % higher (for zooplankton) and up to 300 % higher (for detritus) than dietary protein, whereas ash was 7. 5 % higher (zooplankton) and 46 - 63 % lower (detritus) than dietary ash. For animals fed diet B 2 after 48 h without food, FF was approximately half that of 96 h starved animals after a similar feeding period but foregut protein and ash contents were similar. Finally, the physiological and morphological attributes elucidated in this study are discussed with reference to the ecology of the yabby. High growth rates, excellent feed utilisation indices and high digestibility coefficients for a wide range of diet-types illustrate nutritional flexibility. A capacious foregut, a large hepatopancreas with a high energy storage capacity, the ability to partition and preferentially excrete the low nutrient value inorganic component of the diet, the capacity to alter body form, nutrient processing time and enzymatic secretions in relation to diet-type, and modified behaviour according to feed availability also demonstrate plasticity/adaptability/flexibility. The combined effect of these important characteristics ensures survival in environments that may be adverse and highly variable in terms of nutrient availability. Collectively the morphological and digestive traits elucidated in this study reflect the generalist-type nature of C destructor and indicate that a polytrophic classification still seems appropriate. Several priority areas for further nutrition research are identified and recommendations are made regarding the best-practices to use in the commercial culture of the yabby. Of paramount importance is the further clarification of the nutritional requirements and feeding preferences of animals in various phases of development...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examined}} the effect of including different dietary proportions of starch, protein and lipid, in diets balanced for digestible energy, on the utilisation efficiencies of dietary energy by barramundi (Lates calcarifer). Each diet was fed at one of three ration levels (satiety, 80 % of initial satiety and 60 % of initial satiety) for a 42 -d period. Fish performance measures (weight gain, feed intake and feed conversion ratio) were all affected by dietary energy source. The efficiency of energy utilisation was significantly reduced in fish fed the starch diet relative to the other diets, {{but there were no}} significant effects between the other macronutrients. This reduction in efficiency of utilisation was derived from a multifactorial change in both <b>protein</b> and lipid <b>utilisation.</b> The rate of <b>protein</b> <b>utilisation</b> deteriorated as the amount of starch included in the diet increased. Lipid utilisation was most dramatically affected by inclusion levels of lipid in the diet, with diets low in lipid producing component lipid utilisation rates well above 1 · 3, which indicates substantial lipid synthesis from other energy sources. However, the energetic cost of lipid gain was as low as 0 · 65 kJ per kJ of lipid deposited, indicating that barramundi very efficiently store energy in the form of lipid, particularly from dietary starch energy. This study defines how the utilisation efficiency of dietary digestible energy by barramundi is influenced by the macronutrient source providing that energy, and that the inclusion of starch causes problems with <b>protein</b> <b>utilisation</b> in this species...|$|R
