25|$|The Brown Line Capacity Expansion Project—which {{ran from}} 2006 to 2009—was {{undertaken}} to repair aging infrastructure and increase passenger capacity at Brown Line stations. On February 20, 2006, the CTA broke {{ground on the}} project. All {{but one of the}} Brown Line stations were reconstructed to be ADA compliant and to accommodate eight-car trains. The right-of-way between Kimball and Rockwell Avenue was modernized. Traction power equipment and train control systems were upgraded and a new fiber optic communication <b>network</b> <b>installed.</b> Merchandise Mart was the only station not to receive any work as it had previously been reconstructed from 1987 to 1988, and was already ADA compliant and able to accommodate 8-car trains. Another two stations—Kimball and Western—received small platform extensions but little other work, and the other 16 stations were completely rebuilt.|$|E
