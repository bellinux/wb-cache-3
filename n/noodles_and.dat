5|$|In Ancient China, rice was {{the staple}} crop {{in the south}} and wheat in the north, the latter made into dumplings, <b>noodles,</b> <b>and</b> pancakes. Vegetables used to {{accompany}} these included yams, soybeans, broad beans, turnips, spring onions, and garlic. The diet of the ancient Egyptians was based on bread, often contaminated with sand which wore away their teeth. Meat was a luxury but fish was more plentiful. These were accompanied by a range of vegetables including marrows, broad beans, lentils, onions, leeks, garlic, radishes, and lettuces.|$|E

5|$|The FSM {{government}} {{estimated that}} residents on Fais and Ulithi would need food rations for 3–6 {{months following the}} typhoon. Debris removal at Chuuk International Airport allowed for flights to the state to resume on April1. Emergency assistance across the nation was hampered by the remote and small nature of the islands it comprises. In many instances, communities can only be reached by boat. Further complicating issues was {{the large number of}} trees uprooted or downed by the storm which blocked numerous roads. Generators had been supplied to Ulithi and Fais by April6, allowing for water pumps to be activated and supply clean water. Power and water supply was gradually restored, although many remained without power by two weeks after the storm. On April6, a United States Coast Guard helicopter provided an aerial assessment of the islands affected. Damage assessment was difficult due to the many sparse islands affected across open ocean. Relief supplies stockpiled by the Micronesian Red Cross were distributed {{in the immediate aftermath of}} Maysak; however, these supplies were exhausted by April8. On April14, the FSM government sent a patrol boat to Chuuk, delivering rice, ramen <b>noodles,</b> <b>and</b> water.|$|E

25|$|Europeans {{introduced}} saffron to the Americas when immigrant {{members of}} the Schwenkfelder Church left Europe with a trunk containing its corms. Church members had grown it widely in Europe. By 1730, the Pennsylvania Dutch cultivated saffron throughout eastern Pennsylvania. Spanish colonies in the Caribbean bought large amounts of this new American saffron, and high demand ensured that saffron's list price on the Philadelphia commodities exchange was equal to gold. Trade with the Caribbean later collapsed {{in the aftermath of}} the War of 1812, when many saffron-bearing merchant vessels were destroyed.

25|$|Certain spices {{have been}} {{reported}} to counteract the production of intestinal gas, most notably the closely related cumin, coriander, caraway, fennel and others such as ajwain, turmeric, asafoetida (hing), epazote, and kombu kelp (a Japanese seaweed). Most starches, including potatoes, corn, <b>noodles,</b> <b>and</b> wheat, produce gas as they are broken down in the large intestine. Intestinal gas can be reduced by fermenting the beans, and making them less gas-inducing, or by cooking them in the liquor from a previous batch. Some legumes also stand up to prolonged cooking, which can help break down the oligosaccharides into simple sugars. On the other hand, fermented bean products such as miso are less likely to produce as much intestinal gas. Fermentative lactic acid bacteria such as Lactobacillus casei and Lactobacillus plantarum reduce flatulence in human intestinal tract.|$|E
25|$|Once a {{main dish}} has been cooked, spices such as minced ginger and various pungent herbs may be added as a garnish, called tsuma.

A sprig of mitsuba {{or a piece of}} yuzu rind floated on soups are called ukimi. Minced shiso leaves and myoga often serve as yakumi, a type of condiment paired with tataki of katsuo or soba.

40|$|Okara is a {{byproduct}} of tofu or soymilk production process, which contains rich dietary fibre and protein. To estimate the feasibility of okara’s application in <b>noodle</b> <b>and</b> steamed bread, the effect of okara addition on the qualities of these foods were investigated. The {{results showed that the}} optimal ingredient for okara noodle was: wheat flour 75 %, okara powder 25 %, gluten 3 %, carboxymethyl cellulose sodium 0. 4 %, konjac flour 0. 2 %, NaCl 1 %; the optimal ingredient for okara steamed bread was: wheat flour 85 %, okara powder 15 %, gluten 1 %. The <b>noodle</b> <b>and</b> steamed bread made from above ingredients had almost similar qualities to those made from 100 % wheat flour. Okara addition produces some negative influences on dough mixing and food making, which can be remedied by various additives.
