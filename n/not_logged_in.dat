2500|$|Unlike other massively {{multiplayer}} online games, player {{characters in}} Eve Online advance continuously over time by training skills, a passive process {{that occurs in}} real world time so that the learning process continues even if the player is <b>not</b> <b>logged</b> <b>in.</b> The skill training queue allows up to 50 skills to be scheduled, with up to a 10-year total training schedule. Before the November 4, 2014 [...] "Phoebe" [...] release, the skill training queue allowed skills to be scheduled to start training only up to 24 hours in the future. Some skills require other prerequisite skills to be trained to a certain level to be trained, and some skills require more time to train than others; for example, the skill to fly a Titan-class spaceship takes 8 times as long to train as the skill to fly a frigate ship, with {{a significant number of}} prerequisite skills.|$|E

50|$|Eve Online is {{different}} from MMOGs such as World of Warcraft, Guild Wars, and EverQuest II because the player characters do not gain experience points through actions or by completing tasks. Instead, the player learns skills by training a specific skill over time, a passive process that occurs in real world time so that the learning process will continue even if the player is <b>not</b> <b>logged</b> <b>in.</b> Skills have 5 levels, and each level increases geometrically while skill bonuses per level are linear. This means that gaining competency in a skill requires much less time then getting it to level 5 - a player can easily become competent in many skills but becoming specialized in a skill requires a longer time investment.|$|E

40|$|Background: Posttraumatic stress {{disorder}} (PTSD) develops in 10 - 20 % of injury patients. We developed a novel, self-guided Internet-based intervention (called Trauma TIPS) based on techniques from cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) {{to prevent the}} onset of PTSD symptoms. Objective: To determine whether Trauma TIPS is effective in preventing the onset of PTSD symptoms in injury patients. Methods: Adult, level 1 trauma center patients {{were randomly assigned to}} receive the fully automated Trauma TIPS Internet intervention (n= 151) or to receive no early intervention (n= 149). Trauma TIPS consisted of psychoeducation, in vivo exposure, and stress management techniques. Both groups were free to use care as usual (nonprotocolized talks with hospital staff). PTSD symptom severity was assessed at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months post injury with a clinical interview (Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale) by blinded trained interviewers and self-report instrument (Impact of Event Scale-Revised). Secondary outcomes were acute anxiety and arousal (assessed online), self-reported depressive and anxiety symptoms (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), and mental health care utilization. Intervention usage was documented. Results: The mean number of intervention logins was 1. 7, SD 2. 5, median 1, interquartile range (IQR) 1 - 2. Thirty-four patients in the intervention group did <b>not</b> <b>log</b> <b>in</b> (22. 5 %), 63 (41. 7 %) <b>logged</b> <b>in</b> once, and 54 (35. 8 %) <b>logged</b> <b>in</b> multiple times (mean 3. 6, SD 3. 5, median 3, IQR 2 - 4). On clinician-assessed and self-reported PTSD symptoms, both the intervention and control group showed a significant decrease over time (P <. 001) without significant differences in trend. PTSD at 12 months was diagnosed in 4. 7 % of controls and 4. 4 % of intervention group patients. There were no group differences on anxiety or depressive symptoms over time. Post hoc analyses using latent growth mixture modeling showed a significant decrease in PTSD symptoms in a subgroup of patients with severe initial symptoms (n= 20) (P <. 001). Conclusions: Our results do not support the efficacy of the Trauma TIPS Internet-based early intervention in the prevention of PTSD symptoms for an unselected population of injury patients. Moreover, uptake was relatively low since one-fifth of individuals did <b>not</b> <b>log</b> <b>in</b> to the intervention. Future research should therefore focus on innovative strategies to increase intervention usage, for example, adding gameplay, embedding it in a blended care context, and targeting high-risk individuals who are more likely to benefit from the interventio...|$|R
