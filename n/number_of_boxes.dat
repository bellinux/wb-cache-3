5|$|Boxes play a {{prominent}} role in Crash Bandicoot: Warped and can be broken with all of Crash's techniques. Boxes contain helpful items or can augment Crash's mobility. Check Point boxes allow the player to return to a specific point in the stage upon losing a life. TNT Boxes explode after a three-second fuse when jumped on, while Nitro Boxes explode upon any physical contact. All of the Nitro Boxes in a level can be detonated at once if a green-colored box with an exclamation point (!) on it is touched; contact with this box is necessary in obtaining the level's Gem, as Nitro Boxes count towards the total <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>boxes</b> broken in the level.|$|E
5|$|Completing stages rewards {{the player}} with medals {{that can be}} spent on {{challenge}} stages, music, and costumes for Qbby. Additional medals can be earned by collecting crowns found on each stage, which must be collected before a certain <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>boxes</b> are used. The game makes use of the Nintendo 3DS' Play Coin feature; Play Coins {{can be used to}} request hints to the puzzle solutions. BoxBoy! features a black and white monochrome graphical style. The game features a minimal story, in which Qbby meets two additional characters, Qucy and Qudy, after progressing through certain worlds.|$|E
5|$|BoxBoy! is {{a puzzle}} {{platform}} video {{game in which}} players control a square-shaped character named Qbby. The goal {{of the game is}} to guide Qbby through a series of obstacle-filled stages that are divided into sets called worlds. Each world is focussed on a particular gameplay theme; for example one world introduces stages that contain deadly lasers, and another introduces cranes for transporting Qbby around. The central gameplay mechanic is Qbby's ability to create boxes and make use of them to clear the obstacles. Boxes are created one at a time as a connected string and the maximum <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>boxes</b> in a string varies between each stage. Qbby can detach the string of boxes then push it to different positions. The boxes can be used to overcome obstacles, such as creating a bridge to pass bottomless pits or building staircases to reach higher platforms. Additionally, Qbby can keep the string of boxes attached to his body. He may then use the boxes as a shield to block hazards such as deadly lasers. He is also able to grapple onto ledges and pull himself up by retracting through the boxes. Creating a new string of boxes causes the previous string to disappear. If Qbby dies, he will respawn at a nearby checkpoint.|$|E

25|$|Within {{the levels}} themselves, {{there are a}} <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>boxes</b> that will give {{specific}} gameplay hints. Three Toads are hidden throughout each level; the boss levels have one Toad to rescue (except World 7's boss where Luigi is captive, and World 8's boss where Mario is held hostage) contained in a bubble. (Mario was contained in a cage.) Each world has 16 Toads to rescue. In order to play the final boss battle, the player must rescue all of the Toads.|$|E
25|$|The Theatre Royal {{went dark}} on 14 March 2011 {{due to a}} major {{restoration}} of the auditorium, box office, bars and restaurant. The restoration restored the theatre to the original 1901 Frank Matcham Edwardian interior. The whole interior was stripped apart from the original plasterwork which was carefully preserved. The proscenium arch, tiers and boxes were gold leafed and the plasterwork restored. On all levels the seats were replaced with Edwardian-style theatre seats {{in keeping with the}} restoration. The amphitheatre which was removed during previous renovations was restored to offer more leg room and better views than the gallery. This took the theatre to five distinct seating areas, the stalls, grand circle, upper circle, amphitheatre and gallery. Wheelchair spaces were installed on levels which had previously been inaccessible. As well as the boxes near the stage, boxes {{at the rear of the}} grand and upper circles were also restored taking the total <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>boxes</b> up to ten. The stage lift and orchestra pit were replaced to offer better facilities for opera and musicals. A new ventilation system was put in place to improve comfort levels in the theatre. New frescos for the lobby and upper circle were commissioned and put in place. This £4.75m project introduced higher standards of comfort and improved energy. The Theatre Royal reopened on 12 September 2011 with Alan Bennett’s epic period drama The Madness of George III; George III was in fact the monarch who gave the Theatre Royal its charter.|$|E
500|$|Logarithms {{occur in}} {{definitions}} of the dimension of fractals. Fractals are geometric objects that are self-similar: small parts reproduce, at least roughly, the entire global structure. The Sierpinski triangle (pictured) can be covered by three copies of itself, each having sides half the original length. This makes the Hausdorff dimension of this structure [...] Another logarithm-based notion of dimension is obtained by counting the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>boxes</b> needed to cover the fractal in question.|$|E

2500|$|One {{special case}} of the coin problem is {{sometimes}} {{also referred to as}} the McNugget numbers. The McNuggets version of the coin problem was introduced by Henri Picciotto, who included it in his algebra textbook co-authored with Anita Wah. [...] Picciotto thought of the application in the 1980s while dining with his son at McDonald's, working the problem out on a napkin. A McNugget number is the total number of McDonald's Chicken McNuggets in any <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>boxes.</b> In the United Kingdom, the original boxes (prior to the introduction of the Happy Meal-sized nugget boxes) were of 6, 9, and 20 nuggets.|$|E
2500|$|Not every {{situation}} requires the {{axiom of choice}}. For finite sets X, the axiom of choice follows from the other axioms of set theory. In that case it is equivalent to saying that if we have several (a finite <b>number</b> <b>of)</b> <b>boxes,</b> each containing at least one item, then we can choose exactly one item from each box. Clearly we can do this: We start at the first box, choose an item; go to the second box, choose an item; and so on. The <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>boxes</b> is finite, so eventually our choice procedure comes to an end. The result is an explicit choice function: a function that takes the first box to the first element we chose, the second box to the second element we chose, and so on. (A formal proof for all finite sets would use the principle of mathematical induction to prove [...] "for every natural number k, every family of k nonempty sets has a choice function.") This method cannot, however, be used to show that every countable family of nonempty sets has a choice function, as is asserted by the axiom of countable choice. If the method is applied to an infinite sequence (X'i : i∈ω) of nonempty sets, a function is obtained at each finite stage, {{but there is no}} stage at which a choice function for the entire family is constructed, and no [...] "limiting" [...] choice function can be constructed, in general, in ZF without the axiom of choice.|$|E
