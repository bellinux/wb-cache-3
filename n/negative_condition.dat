60|$|I {{think that}} none of us were {{surprised}} when we were asked to see Mrs. Harker a little before the time of sunset. We have of late come to understand that sunrise and sunset are to her times of peculiar freedom. When her old self can be manifest without any controlling force subduing or restraining her, or inciting her to action. This mood or condition begins some half hour or more before actual sunrise or sunset, and lasts till either the sun is high, or whilst the clouds are still aglow with the rays streaming above the horizon. At first there is a sort of <b>negative</b> <b>condition,</b> as if some tie were loosened, and then the absolute freedom quickly follows. When, however, the freedom ceases the change back or relapse comes quickly, preceded only by a spell of warning silence.|$|E

As {{the return}} action was evidently {{greatest}} instantly after the discharge, I again put the apparatus together, and charged it {{for fifteen minutes}} as before, the inner ball positively. I then discharged it, instantly removing the upper hemisphere with the interior ball, and, leaving the shell-lac cup in the lower uninsulated hemisphere, examined its inner surface by the carrier ball as before (1237.). In this way I found {{the surface of the}} shell-lac actually negative, or in the reverse state to the ball which had been in it; this state quickly disappeared, and was succeeded by a positive condition, gradually increasing in intensity for some time, {{in the same manner as}} before. The first <b>negative</b> <b>condition</b> of the surface opposite the positive charging ball is a natural consequence of the state of things, the charging ball being in contact with the shell-lac only in a few points. It does not interfere with the general result and peculiar state now under consideration, except that it assists in illustrating in a very marked manner the ultimate assumption by the surfaces of the shell-lac of an electrified condition, similar to that of the metallic surfaces opposed to or against them.|$|E
60|$|The cause, then, philosophically speaking, is the {{sum total}} of the conditions, {{positive}} and negative taken together; the whole of the contingencies of every description, which being realized, the consequent invariably follows. The negative conditions, however, of any phenomenon, a special enumeration of which would generally be very prolix, may be all summed up under one head, namely, the absence of preventing or counteracting causes. The convenience of this mode of expression is mainly grounded on the fact, that the effects of any cause in counteracting another cause may in most cases be, with strict scientific exactness, regarded as a mere extension of its own proper and separate effects. If gravity retards the upward motion of a projectile, and deflects it into a parabolic trajectory, it produces, in so doing, the very same kind of effect, and even (as mathematicians know) the same quantity of effect, as it does in its ordinary operation of causing the fall of bodies when simply deprived of their support. If an alkaline solution mixed with an acid destroys its sourness, and prevents it from reddening vegetable blues, it is because the specific effect of the alkali is to combine with the acid, and form a compound with totally different qualities. This property, which causes of all descriptions possess, of preventing the effects of other causes by virtue (for the most part) of the same laws according to which they produce their own,(115) enables us, by establishing the general axiom that all causes are liable to be counteracted in their effects by one another, to dispense with the consideration of negative conditions entirely, and limit the notion of cause to the assemblage of the positive conditions of the phenomenon: one <b>negative</b> <b>condition</b> invariably understood, and the same in all instances (namely, the absence of counteracting causes) being sufficient, along with the sum of the positive conditions, to make up the whole set of circumstances on which the phenomenon is dependent.|$|E

60|$|Margaret was changing! At {{times during}} the past few days I had hardly known her as the same girl whom I had met at the picnic, and whose vigils I had shared in the sick-room of her father. Then, even in her moments of {{greatest}} sorrow or fright or anxiety, she was all life and thought and keenness. Now she was generally distraite, and at times in a sort of <b>negative</b> <b>condition</b> as though her mind--her very being--was not present. At such moments she would have full possession of observation and memory. She would know and remember all that was going on, and had gone on around her; but her coming back to her old self had to me something the sensation of a new person coming into the room. Up to the time of leaving London I had been content whenever she was present. I had over me that delicious sense of security which comes with the consciousness that love is mutual. But now doubt had taken its place. I never knew whether the personality present was my Margaret--the old Margaret whom I had loved at the first glance--or the other new Margaret, whom I hardly understood, and whose intellectual aloofness made an impalpable barrier between us. Sometimes she would become, as it were, awake all at once. At such times, though she would say to me sweet and pleasant things which she had often said before, she would seem most unlike herself. It was almost as if she was speaking parrot-like or at dictation of one who could read words or acts, but not thoughts. After one or two experiences of this kind, my own doubting began to make a barrier; for I could not speak with the ease and freedom which were usual to me. And so hour by hour we drifted apart. Were it not for the few odd moments when the old Margaret was back with me full of her charm I do not know what would have happened. As it was, each such moment gave me a fresh start and kept my love from changing.|$|E
6000|$|It is for {{the same}} reason that no one (as the {{reviewer}} remarks) [...] “calls the cause of a leap, the muscles or sinews of the body, [...] though they are necessary conditions; nor the cause of a [...] self-sacrifice, the knowledge which was necessary for it; nor the [...] cause of writing a book, that a man has time for it, which is a [...] necessary condition.” These conditions (besides that they are [...] antecedent states, and not proximate antecedent events, and are [...] therefore never the conditions in closest apparent proximity to the [...] effect) are all of them so obviously implied, that it is hardly [...] possible there should exist that necessity for insisting on them, [...] which alone gives occasion for speaking of a single condition as if [...] it were the cause. Wherever this necessity exists in regard to some [...] one condition, and does not exist in regard to any other, I conceive [...] that it is consistent with usage, when scientific accuracy is not [...] aimed at, to apply the name cause to that one condition. If the only [...] condition which can be supposed to be unknown is a negative [...] condition, the <b>negative</b> <b>condition</b> may be spoken of as the cause. It [...] might be said that a person died for want of medical advice: though [...] this would not be likely to be said, unless the person was already [...] understood to be ill, and in order to indicate that this negative [...] circumstance was what made the illness fatal, and not the weakness [...] of his constitution, or the original virulence of the disease. It [...] might be said that a person was drowned because he could not swim; [...] the positive condition, namely, that he fell into the water, being [...] already implied in the word drowned. And here let me remark, that [...] his falling into the water is in this case the only positive [...] condition: all the conditions not expressly or virtually included in [...] this (as that he could not swim, that nobody helped him, and so [...] forth) are negative. Yet, if it were simply said that the cause of a [...] man’s death was falling into the water, there would be quite as [...] great a sense of impropriety in the expression, as there would be if [...] it were said that the cause was his inability to swim; because, [...] though the one condition is positive and the other negative, it [...] would be felt that neither of them was sufficient, without the [...] other, to produce death.|$|E
6000|$|With {{regard to}} the {{assertion}} that nothing is termed the cause, [...] except the element which exerts active force; I waive the question [...] as {{to the meaning of}} active force, and accepting the phrase in its [...] popular sense, I revert to a former example, and I ask, would it be [...] more agreeable to custom to say that a man fell because his foot [...] slipped in climbing a ladder, or that he fell because of his weight? [...] for his weight, and not the motion of his foot, was the active force [...] which determined his fall. If a person walking out in a frosty day, [...] stumbled and fell, it might be said that he stumbled because the [...] ground was slippery, or because he was not sufficiently careful: but [...] few people, I suppose, would say, that he stumbled because he [...] walked. Yet the only active force concerned was that which he [...] exerted in walking: the others were mere negative conditions; but [...] they happened to be the only ones which there could be any necessity [...] to state; for he walked, most likely, in exactly his usual manner, [...] and the negative conditions made all the difference. Again, if a [...] person were asked why the army of Xerxes defeated that of Leonidas, [...] he would probably say, because they were a thousand times the [...] number; but I do not think he would say, it was because they fought, [...] though that was the element of active force. To borrow another [...] example, used by Mr. Grove and by Mr. Baden Powell, the opening of [...] flood-gates {{is said to be the}} cause of the flow of water; yet the [...] active force is exerted by the water itself, and opening the [...] flood-gates merely supplies a <b>negative</b> <b>condition.</b> The reviewer adds, [...] “There are some conditions absolutely passive, and yet absolutely [...] necessary to physical phenomena, viz., the relations of space and [...] time; and to these no one ever applies the word cause without being [...] immediately arrested by those who hear him.” Even from this [...] statement I am compelled to dissent. Few persons would feel it [...] incongruous to say (for example) that a secret became known because [...] it was spoken of when A. B. was within hearing; which is a condition [...] of space: or that the cause why one of two particular trees is [...] taller than the other, is that it has been longer planted; which is [...] a condition of time.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In recent {{security}} architectures, it {{is possible}} that the security policy is not evaluated in a centralized way but requires negotiation between the subject who is requesting the access and the access controller. This negotiation is generally based on exchanging credentials between the parties so that the access controller can decide to accept or deny the requesting access. Previous proposals in this field generally implicitly or explicitly assume that the access control policy only contains permissions. In this paper, we present a new approach of negotiation when the security policy contains both permissions and prohibitions. In this case, we claim that it would not be fair to ask for credentials to directly activate prohibitions. Thus, our approach consists in rewriting the policy into an equivalent one that only contain permissions. Since the rewritten policy specifies <b>negative</b> <b>conditions,</b> we then show how to define strategies to negotiate these <b>negative</b> <b>conditions.</b> ...|$|R

For IMF Bz positive and <b>negative</b> <b>conditions,</b> the observed plasma motions are consistent with a standard two cell pattern. For the periods from dusk through midnight to dawn, flow speeds are at least twice as large for Bz negative component compared with Bz positive.

For Bz negative, there are large anti-sunward flows the orientation of which is ordered by IMF By. These By orientated flows are consistent with theoretical predictions, and are anti-symmetric to those reported from the northern hemisphere. The two most significant differences from previous observations are that the convection reversal in the late morning sector for By <b>negative</b> <b>conditions</b> occurs at about a 4 ° lower latitude than the Heppner and Maynard (1987) model. This may be due to a seasonal bias in the PACE dataset. Also, the separatrix between eastward and westward flow near midnight has a very different shape dependent upon the orientation of IMF By.
