5|$|Having {{learned that}} Obote was {{planning}} to arrest him for misappropriating army funds, Amin seized power in a military coup on 25 January 1971, while Obote was attending a Commonwealth summit meeting in Singapore. Troops loyal to Amin sealed off Entebbe International Airport and took Kampala. Soldiers surrounded Obote's residence and blocked major roads. A broadcast on Radio Uganda accused Obote's government of corruption and preferential treatment of the Lango region. Cheering crowds were reported {{in the streets of}} Kampala after the radio broadcast. Amin announced that he was a soldier, <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>politician,</b> and that the military government would remain only as a caretaker regime until new elections, which would be announced when the situation was normalised. He promised to release all political prisoners.|$|E
5|$|Many {{politicians}} {{with strong}} personalities {{and a powerful}} attachment to the institution of Congress are reputed still to roam the halls of Congress long after their deaths. The shades of Representative Joseph Cannon (R-Ill. and Speaker from 1903 to 1911) and Rep. Champ Clark (D-Mo. and Speaker from 1911 to 1919) are claimed to occasionally return to the dark chamber of the House of Representatives after midnight and, after a loud rap from a gavel, resume the strong, angry debates they once had in life. Members of the United States Capitol Police have claimed to have seen Senator (and from 1852 to 1854, Representative) Thomas Hart Benton sitting at a desk in National Statuary Hall, although {{it has not been}} used as a legislative chamber since 1857. Steve Livengood, chief tour guide for the United States Capitol Historical Society, says he has seen the ghost of former Representative Wilbur Mills (D-Ark.) near Mills' former office late at night. Pierre Charles L'Enfant, although <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>politician,</b> was a brevet Major during the American Revolutionary War who served with George Washington at Valley Forge. In 1791, L'Enfant was appointed architect and planner of the new city of Washington in the District of Columbia. Although L'Enfant submitted grandiose plans for the new capital city, his plans were never fully adopted and President Washington dismissed him. L'Enfant spent {{much of the rest of}} his life attempting to wrest a monetary payment from Congress, and he died in poverty in 1825. Eyewitnesses, however, claim to have seen his spirit walking through the Capitol, head down, murmuring to himself, with the plans for the capital city tucked under his arm.|$|E
25|$|Dönitz was {{released}} on 1 October 1956 and retired to the small village of Aumühle in Schleswig-Holstein in northern West Germany. There, he worked on two books. His memoirs, Zehn Jahre, Zwanzig Tage (Memoirs: Ten Years and Twenty Days), appeared in Germany in 1958 and became available in an English translation the following year. This book recounted Dönitz's experiences as U-boat commander (10 years) and President of Germany (20 days). In it, Dönitz explains the Nazi regime {{as a product of}} its time, but argues he was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>politician</b> and thus not morally responsible for much of the regime's crimes. He likewise criticizes dictatorship as a fundamentally flawed form of government and blames it for much of the Nazi era's failings.|$|E

25|$|Garry Sobers, the West Indies' {{captain and}} their best cricketer, caused {{controversy}} by {{playing in a}} double-wicket competition in Rhodesia in September 1970. Although Sobers spent only 48 hours in Salisbury, he had time for a meal with the prime minister, Ian Smith, and described him as a great man to talk to. Sobers' statement and his participation in the tournament gave Caribbean politicians {{an opportunity to make}} clear their hatred of apartheid and racism. The Guyanese prime minister, Forbes Burnham, said Sobers was not welcome in his country until there was an apology. The Jamaican government called for his resignation as captain. The Indian prime minister, Indira Gandhi, forbade the Indian cricket team to tour the West Indies until the matter was sorted out. Sobers initially argued that he had done nothing wrong as he was a cricketer, <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>politician,</b> but ultimately apologised in October 1970 when the scandal threatened to break the West Indies team.|$|E

The day after the election, Churchill asked Ismay to become the Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations in his cabinet. Ismay [...] "was overjoyed at the prospect of serving under Churchill again" [...] and accepted the post immediately. Although <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>politician,</b> Ismay was well-suited for the position because of his close relationships with the leaders of the commonwealth countries, largely the result of his work during the war.|$|E

500|$|During the 1940s, Robey {{appeared}} predominantly in troop concerts {{as himself}} but caused controversy by jokingly supporting the Nazis and belittling black people during his act. His intentions were to gently {{poke fun at}} the [...] "Little Englanders", but audiences {{thought that he was}} sympathising with Nazism. His jocular view that a defeat for Hitler would mean a victory for bolshevism was highlighted in a series of controversial interviews, which caused him much embarrassment when challenged and which he regretted afterwards. His views became known in the press as [...] "Robeyisms", which drew increasing criticism, but his Prime Minister of Mirth remained popular, and he used the character to divert the negative publicity. Cotes wrote that Robey was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>politician,</b> merely a jingoist, who [...] "lived long enough to feel [...] his little-Englander outlook [...] acute embarrassment, and his army of admirers deep dismay." ...|$|E
500|$|Historian A.J.P. Taylor labeled Lansbury as [...] "the most lovable {{figure in}} modern politics" [...] and the {{outstanding}} {{figure of the}} English revolutionary left in the 20th century, while Kenneth O. Morgan, in his biography of a later Labour leader, Michael Foot, regards Lansbury as [...] "an agitator of protest, <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>politician</b> of power". [...] Journalists commonly accused Lansbury of [...] sentimentality, and [...] party intellectuals accused him of lacking mental capacity. Nevertheless, [...] his speeches in the House of Commons were often flavoured with historical and literary allusions, and he left behind a considerable body of writing on socialist ideas; Morgan refers {{to him as a}} [...] "prophet". Foot, who as a young man met and was influenced by Lansbury, was particularly impressed by the older man's achievements in establishing the [...] Daily Herald, given his complete lack of journalistic training. Nevertheless, Foot felt that Lansbury's pacifism was unrealistic, and believed that Bevin's demolition at the 1935 conference was justified.|$|E

[...] Schmeling kept his Jewish manager, Joe Jacobs, despite significant pressure, and, in a dangerous political gamble, refused the [...] "Dagger of Honor" [...] award offered by Adolf Hitler.

2500|$|According to Mircea Braga, one of {{his last}} {{interviews}} shows that, while still criticized for [...] "aestheticism", Baconsky merged his lyricism with an interest in social matters. The statement reads: [...] "The writer is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>politician</b> in the common and consecrated sense of the word. He does however have the role of a spiritual ferment [...] He must not allow people to acquire cerebral obesity. He is always dissatisfied with something or other, his position is that of a permanent antithesis with the surrounding reality." [...] Braga believes Baconsky's moral [...] "rigor" [...] to bear a [...] "Transylvanian sign", and to have been ultimately inspired by the philosophy of Lucian Blaga. The related anti-capitalist vision is questioned by Cernat. The critic indicates that, although sincere in its patriotism, it was also [...] "compatible" [...] with the mixture of communism and nationalism introduced by the Ceauşescu regime (see National communism), and thus similar with the philosophical discourse of Constantin Noica.|$|E

[...] The Los Angeles Police Commissioner sent a telegram to the newspapers before the election asking, [...] "Shall crime and protected vice continue, or will the voters and taxpayers elect George E. Cryer mayor?" [...] Cryer billed himself as a non-politician: [...] "I know nothing about politics, and I shall never be a politician. [...] I have an idea that {{the business of the}} City of Los Angeles can be conducted like any other business ... quietly, effectively, efficiently." [...] The Los Angeles Times backed Cryer, noting, [...] "To talk with George E.
