Along with video collections and recorded live concerts, Do As Infinity were still going strong. Although Dai Nagao was not as active as he was in the beginning (he did not participate in promotional events anymore, such as video clips or photo shoots) he was still the main composer and the brain behind the band. He did, though, appear in concerts from time to time.|$|E

500|$|Subterranean Jungle was {{released}} by Sire Records in February 1983. In a contemporary review for The Village Voice, music journalist Robert Christgau wrote that despite containing two inferior pieces ("Highest Trails Above" [...] and [...] "I <b>Need</b> <b>Your</b> Love"), the album is [...] "more worthy of an audience than anything they've done in the '80s." [...] Stereo Review magazine strongly recommended it to [...] "headbangers of all ages" [...] as [...] "a textbook Ramones album" [...] whose unintellectual lyrics about mental illness and drug abuse [...] "can actually be refreshing." [...] The album peaked at number 83 in on the Billboard 200 in the US, but failed to chart elsewhere. Neither of the album's singles—"Psycho Therapy" [...] and [...] "Time Has Come Today"—charted.|$|E

So since we don't really like having song titles being {{the title of the}} record, 'cause it brings this weird, undue focus to the song, I thought it would be cool to call it Down on the Upside. We started {{thinking}} about all these other titles, and worrying about them describing the whole record without excluding anything... So it was the last minute and we were at a photo shoot for Spin and someone called and said, 'We <b>need</b> <b>your</b> title now so we can start doing the record package,' so Matt [...] brought up the title again, and everyone went, 'yeah, that's it.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Goulding {{released}} her second studio album, Halcyon, in October 2012. In addition to reuniting with writers {{with whom she}} had previously worked, the singer collaborated with several new writers and producers. The album's lead single, [...] "Anything Could Happen", was co-written by Goulding and Jim Eliot. They also wrote six other songs for the album. Goulding collaborated with Lattimer on the single [...] "Figure 8"; she co-wrote [...] "Explosions" [...] with John Fortis and with Starsmith on [...] "Dead in the Water". She also appeared as a featured artist on [...] "I <b>Need</b> <b>Your</b> Love" [...] by Calvin Harris from his third studio album 18 Months (2012). In August 2013, Halcyon was reissued as Halcyon Days. It was preceded by the single [...] "Burn", which Goulding co-wrote with Ryan Tedder, Brent Kutzle, Noel Zancanella and Greg Kurstin.|$|E
500|$|Fox made no {{promises}} that his efforts {{would lead to}} a cure for cancer, but he closed his letter with the statement: [...] "We <b>need</b> <b>your</b> help. The people in cancer clinics all over the world need people who believe in miracles. I am not a dreamer, and I am not saying that this will initiate any kind of definitive answer or cure to cancer. I believe in miracles. I have to." [...] The Cancer Society was skeptical of his dedication, but agreed to support Fox once he had acquired sponsors and requested he get a medical certificate from a heart specialist stating that he was fit to attempt the run. Fox was diagnosed with left ventricular hypertrophy– an enlarged heart– a condition commonly associated with athletes. Doctors warned Fox of the potential risks he faced, though they did not consider his condition a significant concern. They endorsed his participation when he promised that he would stop immediately if he began to experience any heart problems.|$|E

500|$|... "Serious" [...] takes {{influence}} from the [...] "'80s style" [...] and dance music genres, {{which in turn}} drew frequent comparisons to the works of Madonna and Club Nouveau. It contains a string melody alongside a synthpop rhythm. Opening with [...] "an orchestral [...] before diving into a Prince-ready bumping drum beat and ambient synth", Stefani sings: [...] "I think I'm coming down with something / I think I'm gonna <b>need</b> <b>your</b> medicine" [...] in a provocative tone. The use of [...] is also present. Hazel Cills from Vice found the aforementioned lyric reminiscent of Carol Douglas' 1974 cover of [...] "Doctor's Orders". In between different exclamations [...] "centered around Stefani's manic love", she also announces [...] "breathy, vaudeville 'Oohs' and 'Yeahs'". Theon Weber of Spin described the composition: [...] "'Serious' carved out a bittersweet niche that applied loping ska upstrokes to new-wave synth washes and blurred warm feelings about lovers into warm feelings about the synth-pop era." ...|$|E
500|$|Described by Riley as the album's [...] "most {{derivative}} cut", [...] "Got to Get You into My Life" [...] {{was influenced}} by the Motown Sound and written by McCartney after he had seen Stevie Wonder perform at the Scotch of St James nightclub in February. The horn players on the track included members of Georgie Fame's group, the Blue Flames. To capture the desired sound, microphones were placed in the bells of the brass instruments, and the signals were heavily limited. A month later, a tape copy of these horn parts was superimposed with a slight delay, thereby doubling the presence of the brass contributions. Rodriguez terms the completed track [...] "an R shouter". Although cast {{in the form of a}} love song, McCartney described the lyric as [...] "an ode to pot, like someone else might write an ode to chocolate or a good claret". The initial version of the song, as issued on Anthology 2, featured acoustic backing and organ, and a harmonised refrain of [...] "I <b>need</b> <b>your</b> love", which was replaced by Harrison's guitar break on the more uptempo remake.|$|E
500|$|Peckham {{often was}} in {{conflict}} with his subordinate bishops, mainly because of his efforts to reform them, but Peckham's own attitude and handling of his clergy contributed to the problem. He once wrote to Roger de Meyland, the Bishop of Coventry and Lichfield [...] "These things <b>need</b> <b>your</b> attention, but you have been absent so long that you seem not to care. We therefore order you, on receipt of this letter, {{to take up residence}} in your diocese, so that—even if you are not competent to redress spiritual evils—you may at least minister to the temporal needs of the poor." [...] The historian Richard Southern says that Peckham's disputes with his suffragan bishops were [...] "conducted in an atmosphere of bitterness and perpetual ill-will", which probably owed something to a [...] "petulant strain in Peckham's character". Peckham's conflicts started because his own ideals were those of a Franciscan, but most of his clergy were concerned with more mundane and materialistic affairs. These strains between the archbishop and his subordinates were intensified by clashes over ecclesiastical and secular authority, as well as Edward's great need for income.|$|E

500|$|The album {{opens with}} two cover songs; the first, [...] "Little Bit O' Soul", was {{originally}} written by John Carter and Ken Lewis and the second, [...] "I <b>Need</b> <b>Your</b> Love", was first performed by Bobby Dee Waxman. Subterranean Jungle {{is the first}} Ramones' release {{to begin with a}} song not written by the band—this track list structure was criticized by author Everett True, who said that it was [...] "disorientating." [...] Johnny also thought that the fact that the album featured three covers was a bad idea, saying, [...] "we shouldn't have, but I was happy with the guitar sound on it." [...] The album's third track, [...] "Outsider", was written by Dee Dee and, in 2002, it was covered by Green Day on Shenanigans. [...] "What'd Ya Do?" [...] was track number four, and was described by music journalist Chuck Eddy as [...] "crudely metallic." [...] Eddy also deemed the next track, [...] "Highest Trails Above", as [...] "AOR-mystic." [...] "Somebody Like Me" [...] was called a [...] "full-on rock anthem" [...] by Everett True, who {{went on to say that}} the lyrics contained [...] "no-nonsense lines." ...|$|E
500|$|The Documentarys big budget {{production}} from high-profile hip hop producers was well received from critics. The {{first half of}} the album contains [...] "upbeat, gangsta boogie" [...] tracks with the other half relegating [...] "smoothed out R maneuvers". At seven tracks, Dr. Dre co-executive produced the album with his [...] "stripped-down cinematic" [...] approach. [...] "Westside Story" [...] contains an [...] "evil sounding piano plink", [...] "Dreams" [...] has a [...] "simultaneously smooth and eerie" [...] beat, and [...] "Hate It or Love It" [...] unveils a [...] "smoothed out R funk vibe". [...] "Higher" [...] revolves around a pounding synth blast and [...] "How We Do" [...] contains syncopated hand claps with a beat described as [...] "a hypnotic blast of sinister seduction powered by a deliciously primitive 808 pattern and a slinky synth." [...] "Don't <b>Need</b> <b>Your</b> Love" [...] samples Mary J. Blige's [...] "Not Gon Cry" [...] and is one the album's more soulful songs. [...] "Church for Thugs" [...] delivers a [...] "sing-song stylee over an accentuated sonic bed" [...] and [...] "Put You on the Game" [...] is a club track containing [...] "dark dirge of synth".|$|E
500|$|... "Footprints in the Sand" [...] {{was written}} by Simon Cowell, David Kreuger, Per Magnusson and Richard Page, whilst the {{production}} was helmed by Steve Mac. It was recorded in 2007 at Rokstone Studios in London, England. Cowell originally {{came up with the}} idea to base a song around the Christian poem [...] "Footprints", and suggested it to Kreuger and Magnusson. They had a scheduled session in Page's home in Malibu, California and finished the song the next day. Cowell secured a songwriting credit for coming up with the idea. In an interview with HitQuarters, Magnusson said they had thought the song would be a good idea for Irish boy band Westlife, but it was offered to British singer Leona Lewis instead. When Cowell mentioned the song concept to Lewis, she agreed that it could be [...] "really quite interesting". Regarding the song, Lewis commented: [...] "Originally it was a poem; it's very inspirational so we put it into a song. I think it is very moving, with a very emotional lyric and I really love to sing this song"; and added that the poem [...] " [...] about standing by someone and being there for people who <b>need</b> <b>your</b> help." ...|$|E
