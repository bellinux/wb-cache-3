The TMT LGSF conceptual design is based upon three 50 W solid state, continuous wave, sum frequency 589 nm lasers and conventional beam transport optics. In this paper, we provide an update to the TMT LGSF conceptual design. The LGSF top end and the beam transfer optics have been significantly redesigned {{to compensate for the}} TMT telescope top end flexure, to adapt for the new TMT Ritchey-Chrétien optical design, {{to reduce the number of}} optical surfaces and to reduce the mass and volume. Finally, the laser service enclosure has been relocated within the telescope azimuth structure. This will permit the lasers to operate with a fixed gravity vector, but also requires further changes in the beam transport optical path...|$|E
40|$|An all optical {{autofocus}} {{has been}} designed and tested for tight line width control in a high <b>NA</b> <b>laser</b> photoplotter system. The laser system is based in a GaN semiconductor laser with power 30 mW and wavelength 405 nm. The advantage of using this laser, despite the relatively long wavenlength, is compactness and easy for high frequency modulation. The autofocus system is based in a secondary 635 nm GaAlAs laser without need for wavelength, neither power stabilization. The two beams are delivered coaxially through the focusing lens {{by means of a}} dichroic beamsplitter. Focusing lens need no correction for chromatic aberration, as this is compensed by appropriate autofocus beam divergence. After reflection in the sample, the autofocus beam is separated from the returning writing beam and then guided to a collimation sensor, in which defocus of about 1 / 20 of the Rayleigh range of the writing beam can be detected and compensated by an analogue PID electronic control. Stable linewidth within 5 % is achieved with different numerical aperture focusing lenses...|$|E

Major subsystems include the laser itself and its enclosure, the optics for transferring the laser beams up the telescope structure and the asterism generator and launch telescope, both mounted behind the TMT secondary mirror.

40|$|The use {{of optical}} {{interconnects}} is a promising {{solution to the}} increasing demand for high speed mass data transmission used in integrated circuits as well as device to device data transfer applications. For the purpose, low cost polymer waveguides are a popular choice for routing signal between devices due to their compatibility with printed circuit boards. In optical interconnect, coupling from an external light source to such waveguides is a critical step, thus a variety of couplers have been investigated such as grating based couplers [1, 2], evanescent couplers [3], and embedded mirrors [4 – 6]. These couplers are inherently micro-optical components which require fast and scalable fabrication for mass production with optical quality surfaces/structures. Low <b>NA</b> <b>laser</b> direct writing {{has been used for}} fast fabrication of structures such as gratings and Fresnel lenses using a linear laser direct writing scheme, though the length scale of such structures are an order of magnitude larger than the spot size of the focused laser of the tool. Nonlinear writing techniques such as with 2 -photon absorption offer increased write resolution which makes it possible to fabricate sub-wavelength structures as well as having a flexibility in feature shape. However it does not allow a high speed fabrication and in general are not scalable due to limitations of speed and area induced by the tool’s high NA optics. To overcome such limitations primarily imposed by NA, we propose a new micro-optic fabrication process which extends the capabilities of 1 D, low NA, and thus fast and scalable, laser direct writing to fabricate a structure having a length scale close to the tool's spot size, for example, a mirror based and 45 degree optical coupler with optical surface quality. The newly developed process allows a high speed fabrication with a write speed of 2600 mm²/min by incorporating a mask based lithography method providing a blank structure which is critical to creating a 45 degree slope to form the coupler surface. In this method, instead of using an entire exposure in a pixelated manner, only a portion of the Gaussian profile is used, allowing a reduced surface roughness and better control of the surface shape than previously possible with this low NA beam. The surface figure of the mirror is well controlled below 0. 04 waves in root-mean-square (RMS) at 1. 55 μm wavelength, with mirror angle of 45 ± 1 degrees. The coupling efficiency is evaluated using a set of polymer waveguides fabricated on the same substrate as the complete proof of concept device. Device insertion loss was measured using a custom built optical test station and a detailed loss analysis was completed to characterize the optical coupling efficiency of the mirror. Surface roughness and angle were also experimentally confirmed. This process opens up a pathway towards large volume fabrication of free-form and high aspect ratio optical components which have not yet pursued, along with well-defined optical structures on a single substrate. In this dissertation, in Chapter 1, we provide an overview of optical surface fabrication in conjunction with current state of the art on fabrication of free form surfaces in macro and microscopic length scale. The need for optical interconnects is introduced and fabrication methods of micro-optical couplers are reviewed in Chapter 2. In Chapter 3, the complete fabrication process of a mirror based coupler is presented including a custom alignment procedure. In Chapter 4, we provide the integration procedure of the optical couplers with waveguides. In Chapter 5, the alignment of two-lithographic methods is discussed. In Chapter 6, we provide the fabrication procedure used for the waveguides. In Chapter 7, the experimental evaluation and testing of the optical coupler is described. We present a custom test station used for angle verification and optical coupler efficiency measurement. In Chapter 8, a detailed loss analysis of the device is presented including suggestions for future reductions in loss. Conclusions and future work considerations are addressed in Chapter 9...|$|E

40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{interaction}} {{and the competition}} {{of a set of}} transverse cavity modes, which belong to a frequency-degenerate family. The laser turns out to be able to realize several different stationary spatial patterns, which differ in the transverse configuration of the intensity or of the field and are met by varying the values of the control parameters. A striking feature that emerges in almost all steady-state patterns is the presence of dark points, in which both the real and the imaginary part of the electric field vanish and such that, if one covers a closed loop around one of these points, the field phase changes by a multiple of 2, which corresponds to the topological charge of the point. We show in detail the analogy of these phase singularities to the vortex structures well known in such fields as, for example, hydrodynamics, superconductivity, and superfluidity. In our case, at steady state, these singularities are arranged in the form of regular crystals, nd the equiphase lines of the field exhibit a notable similarity to the field lines of the electrostatic field generated by a corresponding set of point charges. We analyze in detail the patterns that emerge in the cases 2 p+l= 2 and 2 p+l= 3, where p and l are the radial and angular modal indices, respectively, and we compare the results with the experimental observations obtained from a <b>Na</b> 2 <b>laser.</b> The observed patterns agree in detail with those found by theory; in particular, they exhibit the predicted phase singularities in each pattern.

30|$|STORM imaging was {{performed}} on a custom setup built around a Nikon TiU inverted microscope (Huang et al. 2008; Bates et al. 2007). Illumination of the Alexa- 647 dye was provided by a 300 [*]mW 656 [*]nm solid state laser (Crystalaser, CL 656 - 300). The 656 [*]nm laser light excites fluorescence from Alexa 647 and switches the dye off rapidly. The same light also reactivates Alexa 647 back to the fluorescent state, but at a very low rate such {{that only a small}} fraction of the dye molecules (~ 0.1 %) emit fluorescence at any given instant.

The output of the lasers was combined and coupled into a single mode photonic fiber (NKT Photonics, LMA- 8) for transmission to the STORM microscope. Light from the fiber was collimated and focused on the back-focal plane of the microscope objective. The illumination was adjusted from epi-flourescence to total internal reflection by translating the illumination beam across the back-focal plane of the objective.

CellTracks TDI, a dedicated image cytometer, was developed to improve the enumeration of these rare CTC. The CellSearch System was used to enumerate CTC in 7. 5 mL blood of 68 patients with cancer and 9 healthy controls. Cartridges containing the fluorescently labeled CTC from this system were reanalyzed using the image cytometer, which acquires images with a TDI camera using a 40 ×/ 0. 6 <b>NA</b> objective and <b>lasers</b> as light source. Automated classification of events was performed by the Random Forest method using Matlab. An automated classifier was developed to classify events into CTC, apoptotic CTC, CTC debris, leukocytes, and debris not related to CTC. A high agreement in classification was obtained between the automated classifier and five expert reviewers. Comparison of images from the same events in CellTracks TDI and CellTracks Analyzer II shows improved resolution in fluorescence images and improved classification by adding bright-field images. Improved detection efficiency for CD 45 -APC avoids the classification of leukocytes nonspecifically binding to cytokeratin as CTC. The correlation between number of CTC detected in CellTracks TDI and CellTracks Analyzer II is good with a slope of 1. 88 and a correlation coefficient of 0. 87.

We have performed x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) on all of these systems.

40|$|The Shuttle Laser Altimeter (SLA) is a Hitchhiker {{experiment}} {{now being}} integrated for first flight on STS- 72 in November 1995. Four Shuttle flights of the SLA are planned {{at a rate}} of about a flight every 18 months. They are aimed at the transition of the Goddard Space Flight Center airborne laser altimeter and lidar technology to low Earth orbit as a pathfinder for operational space-based laser remote sensing devices. Future alser altimeter sensors such as the Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS), an Earth Observing System facility instrument, and the Multi-Beam Laser Altimeter (MBLA), the land and vegetation laser altimeter for the NASA TOPSAT (Topography Satellite) Mission, will utilize systems and approaches being tested with SLA. The SLA Instrument measures the distance from the Space Shuttle to the Earth's surface by timing the two-way propagation of short (approximately 10 <b>na</b> noseconds) <b>laser</b> pulses. laser pulses at 1064 nm wavelength are generated in a laser transmitter and are detected by a telescope equipped with a silicon avalanche photodiode detector. The SLA data system makes the pulse time interval measurement to a precision of about 10 nsec and also records the temporal shape of the laser echo from the Earth's surface for interpretation of surface height distribution within the 100 m diam. sensor footprint. For example, tree height can be determined by measuring the characteristic double-pulse signature that results from a separation in time of laser backscatter from tree canopies and the underlying ground. This is accomplished with a pulse waveform digitizer that samples the detector output with an adjustable resolution of 2 nanoseconds or wider intervals in a 100 sample window centered on the return pulse echo. The digitizer makes the SLA into a high resolution surface lidar sensor. It can also be used for cloud and atmospheric aerosol lidar measurements by lengthening the sampling window and degrading the waveform resolution. Detailed test objectives for the STS- 72 mission center on the acquisition of sample data sets for land topography and vegetation height, waveform digitizer performance, and verification of data acquisition algorithms. The operational concept of SLA is illustrated in Fig. 1 where a series of 100 m footprints stretch in a profile of Earth surface topography along the nadir track of the Space Shuttle. The location of SLA as a dual canister payload on the Hitchhiker Bridge Assembly in Bay 12 of the Space Shuttle Endeavor can also be noted in this figure. Full interpretation of the SLA range measurement data set requires a 1 m knowledge of the Orbiter trajectory and better than 0. 1 deg knowledge of Orbiter pointing angle. These ancillary data sets will be acquired during the STS- 72 mission with an on-board Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver, K-band range and range-rate tracking of the Orbiter through TDRSS, and use of on-board inertial measurement units and star trackers.

40|$|This project aims {{to develop}} and characterise a {{label-free}} waveguide microscopy system {{as an alternative to}} objective-based total internal reflection microscopy to be applied in the qualitative detection of the adhesion of biological samples. The advantage of the waveguide system allows the use of lower numerical aperture objectives resulting in a larger field of view and a significant cost reduction. A LED illuminated waveguide system was developed in which light is coupled through a conventional microscope slide to produce total internal reflection at the glass-water interface. The evanescent field profile was characterised by displacing a tungsten tip from the glass/water interface and the scattered intensity from the tip was imaged using a low <b>NA</b> objective. A <b>laser</b> illuminated waveguide system was then developed and the microscope slides were modified by polishing the uneven edges, which allowed better control of the incidence angle and the evanescent field was characterised using the same method. To verify that the waveguide signal will only be detected when an objective is proximal to the surface, microspheres under Brownian motion were tracked under bright-field mode and laser waveguide mode. The evanescent field profile was best fitted with a double exponential, however, the evanescent field depth could not be defined due to the presence of an intensity offset of approximately 50 % from the normalised intensity. The high intensity offset was reduced to 10 % when the edges of the waveguide were polished and a collimated laser source was used. Under laser illumination, for high incident angles, the evanescent field profile showed deviation from the simple exponential function at short separation distances from the substrate. The evanescent field depth based on the best fitted function for incident angles 62. 1 (deg), 68. 1 (deg) and 77. 4 (deg) were 956 ± 55 nm, 366 ± 0. 6 nm and 211 ± 32 nm respectively; demonstrating that the evanescent field depth can be controlled by changing the incident angle. Two out of seven tracked microspheres featured a coefficient of variation > 1 over time in the results of the waveguide mode and was not observed in the bright-field mode. The higher coefficient of variation was caused by an intensity spike when the microspheres moved in and out the evanescent field and confirms the validity of the waveguide system. This system can potentially be compatible with standard tissue culture plastics and can be adoptable in an industrial manufacturing setting...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} the mitochondrial {{function of the}} remnant liver (RL) in the early phase of liver regeneration in rats after 70 % partial hepatectomy (PH). METHODS: Sixty male Wistar rats (200 - 250 g) submitted to 70 % PH were divided into five groups according {{to the time of}} euthanasia and application or not of laser light: C = Control, time zero; 2 minutes, 4, 6 and 24 hours after PH. The dose of laser radiation was 22. 5 J/cm², wavelength of 660 nm (visible/red), in the remnant liver. We studied the respiration activated by ADP (state 3), basal mitochondrial respiration (state 4), respiratory control ratio (RCR) and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). RESULTS: The mitochondrial function of RL changed at 4 and 6 hours after PH, with a significant increase in state 3 and a concomitant increase in state 4 and with maintenance of RCR. MMP differed significantly between the groups biostimulated with laser radiation and the control group 4 hours after HP, with a substantial reduction in the non-laser groups. CONCLUSION: The laser light at the dose used in this study did not induce additional damage to the RL and seems to have delayed the hepatocellular metabolic overload of the remnant liver.

Alguns recursos fisioterapêuticos atuam basicamente na redução dos sintomas ocasionados por este distúrbio. O objetivo deste estudo foi verificar a eficácia do laser 670 nm, em duas diferentes densidades de energia, na redução do quadro álgico, em ratos submetidos a modelo experimental de ciatalgia. Foram utilizados 18 ratos, divididos em 3 grupos: G 1 (n= 6) submetidos à ciatalgia e simulado o tratamento (grupo placebo), G 2 (n= 6) submetido à ciatalgia e tratados com laser 2 J/cm², G 3 (n= 6) submetidos à ciatalgia e irradiados com laser 4 J/cm². O nervo isquiático do membro posterior direito dos animais foi exposto e compressão com fio catgut em 4 pontos ao redor do nervo foi realizada. No 3 ° dia pós-operatório, iniciou-se o tratamento com <b>laser</b> <b>na</b> região do procedimento cirúrgico do membro posterior direito durante 10 dias consecutivos. Verificou-se por meio da marcha, o tempo em que o membro permanecia no ar nos períodos: anterior à ciatalgia, pré e pós-tratamento. Os resultados demonstraram que o laser não foi eficaz na redução do quadro álgico, porém com 4 J/cm² houve efeito positivo, sem restabelecimento completo da funcionalidade. Sciatica {{is caused}} by the sciatic nerve compression in some point of its course, and its treatment consists of solving the nervous compression cause, either by surgical or conservative treatment. Some physiotherapeutic resources act basically in the reduction of the symptoms caused by this disturbance. The aim {{of this study was to}} verify the effectiveness of the laser 670 nm, in two different energy densities, in the pain reduction, in rats submitted to a sciatica experimental model. Eighteen rats, divided in 3 groups were used: G 1 (n= 6) submitted to sciatica and simulated treatment (placebo group), G 2 (n= 6) submitted to sciatica and treated with laser 2 J/cm², G 3 (n= 6) submitted to sciatica and irradiated with laser 4 J/cm². The hamstring nerve of the animals' right hind limb was exposed and compression with catgut thread in 4 points of the nerve was performed. On the 3 rd post-operation day, the treatment was begun with laser in the surgical procedure area of the right hind limb for 10 days. The time during which the limb remained on the air was verified through gait in the following periods: previous to the sciatica, before and after treatment.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: to {{evaluate}} the impact of laser therapy on inter-twin discordance in twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS). METHODS: biparietal diameter (BPD), head circumference (HC), abdominal circumference (AC), femur length (FL) and estimated fetal weight were prospectively collected during a five-year period (1999 to 2004). The inter-twin discordance was expressed {{as a percentage of}} the largest twin's measurements. The measurements were made the day before laser, twice following laser and after delivery. The mean values of discordance in measurements and in fetal weight were calculated. ANOVA was used to compare mean values. RESULTS: the mean (SD) discordance for BPD, HC, AC, FL and estimated fetal weight the day before laser were 8. 53 % (5. 28), 8. 75 % (2. 76), 16. 19 % (4. 85), 12. 92 % (5. 13) and 28. 50 % (6. 46) respectively. At the at 2 nd ultrasound assessment after surgery were 4. 37 % (3. 55), 3. 73 % (2. 71), 8. 90 % (4. 42), 6. 61 % (4. 99) and 19. 11 % (8. 01) respectively; and at birth the weight discordance was 18. 55 % (8. 74). There was a significant decrease in discordance for HC and AC for each ultrasound assessment. CONCLUSIONS: there was a decrease in fetal growth discordance following laser therapy in TTTS. These changes might be related to re-adaptation of blood flow following laser therapy. OBJETIVOS: avaliar impacto da terapia a laser no crescimento fetal na Sindrome de transfusão feto-fetal (STFF). MÉTODOS: diâmetro biparietal (DBP), circunferência cefálica (CC) e abdominal (CA), comprimento do fêmur (CF) e peso fetal foram colhidos prospectivamente no período de cinco anos (1999 a 2004). A discordância entre os gêmeos foi expressa como porcentagem da medida do maior. As medidas foram feitas um dia antes do laser, duas vezes após e depois do nascimento. A cada exame e pós-parto foram calculadas médias das discordâncias entre medidas e peso fetal. ANOVA foi usada para comparar as médias. RESULTADOS: a discordância média (SD) para DBP, CC, CA, CF e peso fetal um dia antes do laser foi 8, 53 % (5, 28), 8, 75 % (2, 76), 16, 19 % (4, 85), 12, 92 % (5, 13) e 28, 50 % (6, 46). No segundo exame pós-laser os resultados foram 4, 37 % (3, 55), 3, 73 % (2, 71), 8, 90 % (4, 42), 6, 61 % (4, 99) e 19, 11 % (8, 01); e a discordância do peso fetal ao nascimento foi 18, 55 % (8, 74). Houve diminuição significativa na discordância para CC e CA em cada exame. CONCLUSÕES: houve redução significativa na discordância do crescimento fetal após o <b>laser</b> <b>na</b> STFF.

O objetivo desse estudo foi avaliar as tensões geradas em implantes esplintados por três diferentes desenhos de barras pré-fabricadas em Ti (Ti- 6 Al- 4 V) soldadas por duas técnicas de soldagem (Laser e Tungsten Iner Gas (TIG)). Três barras, utilizando 5, 4 e 3 implantes foram soldadas com solda Laser e TIG (tungsten inert gas), formando os grupos (G 3 L,G 3 T), (G 4 L, G 4 T), (G 5 L,G 5 T). As tensões foram mensuradas com análise fotoelástica quantitativa. Resultados. Entre os grupos G 5 T e G 5 L houve maiores concentrações de tensão para solda TIG (p 0. 05). A análise estatística utilizou o teste de variância (anova Fisher) indicando o maior valor pela média. Na segunda análise comparou-se os implantes Nº 1 e 5 por serem comuns às três barras. Não houve diferenças significativas na análise do implante nº 1 (p> 0. 05). No implante nº 5 no grupo Laser, G 3 L foi significativamente diferente com maiores valores que G 4 L e G 5 L. No implante nº 5 no grupo TIG, apenas G 5 T foi significativamente diferente com maiores valores que G 4 T e G 3 T. A análise estatística utilizou o teste de variância (anova Fisher) indicando o maior valor pelo teste Tukey. Em conclusão, melhores resultados para TIG nas barras com menos implantes, e <b>Laser</b> <b>nas</b> barras com mais implantes. In {{the past}} few years, {{frameworks}} for multiple implants have been sectioned and welded for a passive fit. However, the welding process itself may lead to misalignments. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the stress generated on splinted implants by three different designs of Ti (Ti- 6 Al- 4 V) prefabricated frameworks welded with two different techniques. Three frameworks were welded with Laser or TIG (tungsten inert gas) to implants 3, 4 and 5, forming (G 3 L, G 3 T), (G 4 L, G 4 T), and (G 5 L, G 5 T), groups. Stress was measured by quantitative photoelastic analysis. Results: There was higher concentration of stress with TIG in groups G 5 T and G 5 L, and with Laser in groups G 3 T and G 3 L (p 0. 05). On the second analysis, the stress of the implants on each framework was analyzed on implants 1 and 5, since they are present on the three frameworks. No significant differences were observed in the analysis of implant 1 (p> 0. 05). On implant 5 of the Laser group, G 3 L was significantly different, with higher values than those of G 4 L and G 5 L. On implant 5 of the TIG group, only G 5 T was significantly different, with higher values than those of G 3 T and G 4 T. The statistical analysis used the Fisher Anova test and Tukey-S-B test.

40|$|The {{mechanism}} of regeneration does not start {{to restore the}} wound until its corresponding epimorphic phase. A bioestimulation of tissues and cells by laser radiation depends on the wavelength, on the dose, and on {{the intensity of the}} light. The goal of this work was to verify the effect of the low power laser at 660 nm on the regenerative process of Girardia tigrina. The specimens were maintained in the laboratory under a temperature ranging from 19 ° up to 24 °C for 21 days. The planarians were anesthetized by placing them on ice and then cut them with a scalpel. The three treatments were as following: animals individually irradiated with 14 sessions with 1 minute duration (treatment 1), 14 sessions with 3 minutes duration (treatment 2), and without irradiation (control). The planarians were amputated and divided in three study treatments: a control group (without radiation), and two other treatments: irradiated for 1 minute, and irradiated for 3 minutes. The animals were irradiated with diode laser (660 nm) with 3. 3 ± 0. 3 mW of power, using 0. 94 mW. mm- 2 power density for each irradiation procedure. During the experiment, 14 irradiation sessions were undertaken. The specimens were fixed in Bouin, and stained with hematoxyline and eosin. From observation and histological analysis, it was possible to assess the effects of interaction between laser and tissue. The head fragment after 1 minute of irradiation presented a better organized tissue scheme, when compared with the other treatments. Aspects of the body fragments submitted to 3 minutes of light treatment were very similar to fragments that had not been injured. It can be concluded that there are changes in the quality of regeneration when treated with low power laser under the conditions mentioned above. O mecanismo de regeneração não restaura a ferida até sua fase epimórfica correspondente. A bioestimulação de tecidos e células por radiação laser depende do comprimento de onda, da dose e intensidade de luz. O objetivo deste trabalho foi verificar o efeito do laser de baixa potência (660 nm) no processo regenerativo de Girardia tigrina. Estes vermes têm uma elevada capacidade de regeneração. Os espécimes foram mantidos em laboratório sob uma temperatura de 19 ° a 24 °C por 21 dias. As planárias foram anestesiadas com gelo e amputadas com bisturi. Os 3 tratamentos foram compostos de: animais individualmente irradiados com 14 sessões de 1 minuto de duração (tratamento 1), com 14 sessões de três minutos de duração (tratamento 2) e não irradiados (controle). Elas foram irradiadas com laser diodo (660 nm) 3, 3 ± 0, 3 mW potência, usando 0. 94 mW. mm- 2 de densidade de potência para cada irradiação. Durante o experimento foram realizadas 14 sessões.

OBJETIVOS: Comparar a contração da ferida e a neovascularização com o uso da Pfaffia glomerata e do laser de baixa potência em dorso de ratos. MÉTODOS: Foram utilizados 40 ratos da linhagem Wistar nos quais realizaram-se feridas cirúrgicas com punch de 3 mm de diâmetro na parte superior direita do dorso onde nenhuma substância foi aplicada e nesses mesmos animais foram também realizadas feridas cirúrgicas no lado esquerdo na região inferior, onde foi aplicado o extrato das raízes de Pfaffia glomerata (Spreng.) Pedersen, Amaranthaceae, obtendo-se desta maneira os grupos controle e planta nos mesmos animais. Em outros 40 animais, foi utilizado o laser de baixa potência. Nas datas programadas em 48 horas, uma, duas e três semanas foram tomadas as medidas da contração da ferida. Microscopicamente os resultados foram analisados utilizando-se imunoistoquímica como fator VIII para observar a densidade vascular. RESULTADOS: Macroscopicamente não houve diferença estatisticamente significante com relação à contração da ferida entre os grupos planta e laser, obtendo ambos resultados superiores ao grupo controle. Dentro desta variável, o resultado com diferença estatisticamente significante ocorreu dentro do grupo <b>laser</b> <b>na</b> comparação dos subgrupos: 48 horas vs. uma semana (p= 0, 008).

Sixty human teeth with single canals and ovalshaped were used (n= 15) : ETA - Endodontic treatment and cementation with RelyX ARC; ETU - Endodontic treatment and cementation U 200; ERA - Endodontic retreatment and cementation RelyX ARC; ERU - Endodontic retreatment and cementation with U 200. The groups with conventional endodontic treatment were filled with AH plus (ETA and ETU) and the groups that suffered endodontic retreatment were filled, primarily, with Endofill and, after, with AH Plus.  The fiber glass posts received as a previous treatment, an alcohol 70 % cleaning and application of silane. The groups ETA and ERA received adhesive application. For analysis in confocal laser microscope, were added to the primer adhesive system and the self-adhesive cement, the fluorescent dye rhodamine B isothiocyanate RITC 0. 01 %. Each root third passed for the push-out test, with a speed of 0. 5 mm / min and to verify the penetration and adaptation of the cement in the root dentin analysis were made under confocal laser scanning microscopy. Subsequently each of the specimens were analyzed in scanning electron microscopy, the failures were classified (AD) adhesive; (MI) mixed and (CO) cohesive. For statistical analysis of the results, were selected two criteria: the tests two-way ANOVA and the Tukey test (α < 0. 05). As a result for push out bond strength ETA showed higher bond strength to radicular dentin than the other groups (p < 0. 05) in all radicular thirds. Endodontic retreatment interfered negatively on the penetrability and on the push out bond strength of RelyX ARC and U 200 cements to dentin, regardless of the analyzed radicular third. O objetivo deste estudo foi verificar o efeito do retratamento endodôntico sobre a resistência de união e a penetrabilidade de diferentes sistemas de cimentação de pinos de fibra de vidro à dentina intrarradicular por meio de ensaio mecânico push out, microscopia confocal a laser e microscopia eletrônica de varredura.

Ainda que existam poucos estudos na {{literatura}} quanto ao emprego do laser de Er,Cr:YSGG para o tratamento preventivo de lesões de cárie, acredita-se que a sua aplicação sobre a estrutura dental seja capaz de promover uma superfície mais resistente a desafios ácidos. O objetivo deste estudo foi avaliar o efeito da irradiação do esmalte dental humano com o laser de Er,Cr:YSGG, com diferentes densidades de energia, em relação à desmineralização. Quarenta e cinco blocos de esmalte dental de terceiros molares humanos (3 x 3 mm) foram aleatoriamente divididas em 5 grupos (n= 9) : G 1  Laser de Er,Cr:YSGG 0, 25 W, 20 Hz, 2, 84 J/cm 2, G 2   Laser de Er,Cr:YSGG 0, 50 W, 20 Hz, 5, 68 J/cm 2, G 3  Laser de Er,Cr:YSGG 0, 75 W, 20 Hz, 8, 52 J/cm 2, G 4  Tratamento com dentifrício fluoretado (controle positivo), G 5  Sem tratamento (controle negativo). Em seguida, as amostras&# 3338;foram submetidas a ciclagem de pH por 2 semanas, permanecendo, diariamente, 6 h e 18 h nas soluções desmineralizante e remineralizante, respectivamente. Após o desafio ácido, as amostras foram seccionadas e o teste de Microdureza Knoop (25 g, 30 seg) foi realizado em distancias pré-determinadas em relação a superfície do esmalte (15 µm - 300 µm). OS valores de ANOVA e teste de Student Newman Keuls foram realizados(&# 945; = 5 %). Os percentuais de inibição de cárie encontrados foram de: G 1 - 36, 64 %, G 2 - 37, 98 %. G 3  63, 83 % e G 4  50, 47 %. Não houve diferenças estatisticamente significativas entre a porcentagem de volume mineral perdido nos grupos G 1 (1391, 81 ± 521, 65) e G 2 (1291, 90 ± 656, 49), porém ambos foram maiores do que o grupo G 3 (753, 32 ± 287, 07). Nenhum dos grupos submetidos ao tratamento com o laser de Er,Cr:YSGG diferiu estatisticamente do grupo controle positivo (G 4). Os resultados deste estudo {{in vitro}} sugerem que a irradiação com o Laser de Er,Cr:YSGG com densidade de energia de 8, 52 J/cm 2 pode ser uma alternativa efetiva na obtenção do aumento da resistência ácida do esmalte e que densidades de energia menores podem apresentar um potencial cariostático semelhante ao tratamento com dentifrício fluoretado. The continuing development and {{improvement of the}} techniques and materials have introduced the laser technology in the different specialties of Dentistry. Even though there are still few studies {{on the use of}} the Er,Cr:YSGG Laser on caries prevention, one believes that the enamel irradiation with this wavelength can lead to a more acid resistant surface. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of different parameters of the Er,Cr:YSGG Laser irradiation on the enamel mineral loss. Forty five enamel samples obtained from third molars (3 x 3 mm) were randomly divided in 5 groups (n= 9) : G 1  Er,Cr:YSGG Laser 0. 25 W, 20 Hz, 2. 84 J/cm 2, G 2  Er,Cr:YSGG Laser 0. 50 W, 20 Hz, 5. 68 J/cm 2, G 3  Er,Cr:YSGG Laser 0. 75 W, 20 Hz, 8. 52 J/cm 2, G 4  Treatment with fluoride toothpaste (positive control), G 5  No treatment (negative control). After the surface treatment, the samples were submitted to a 2 -weeks pH-cycling, consisted of the daily immersion in demineralizing and remineralizing solutions for 6 h e 18 h, respectively. After&# 3338;the acid challenge, the samples were sectioned and the Knoop microhardness test was performed (25 g, 30 sec) at different depth from the enamel surface (15 µm - 300 µm). ANOVA and Student Newman Keuls tests were performed (&# 945; = 5 %). The percentage of lesion inhibition for each group was: G 1 - 36. 64 %, G 2 - 37. 98 %. G 3  63. 83 % e G 4  50. 47 %. Regarding the percentage of mineral loss volume, Groups G 1 (1391. 81 ± 521. 65) and G 2 (1291. 90 ± 656. 49) did not differ from each other, but both were higher than group G 3 753. 32 ± 287. 07). All the groups irradiated with the Er,Cr:YSGG were similar to the positive control group (G 4).

Prepararam-se três formulações, diferindo-se no tensoativo utilizado, sendo o sistema emulsionado SE- 1 composto por 8, 0 % (p/p) de oleth- 20; o SE- 2 por 4, 0 % (p/p) de oleth- 20 e 4, 0 % (p/p) steareth- 21; e o SE- 3 por 8, 0 % (p/p) steareth- 21. Avaliaram-se a estabilidade preliminar, o valor de pH, os perfis reológico e termogravimétrico. A presença de fase gel cristalina foi determinada por meio da microscopia com luz polarizada e, o tamanho das gotículas, por meio da microscopia óptica comum, difração a laser e OCT. As amostras não apresentaram sinais de instabilidade por meio dos testes da centrifugação e do estresse térmico. O valor de pH foi considerado compatível com o da pele humana (4, 6 a 5, 8). Os sistemas apresentaram comportamento reológico não-Newtoniano pseudoplástico. SE- 1 apresentou viscosidade aparente {{inferior}} (223, 53 mPa. s) e área de histerese (2238, 38 Pa/s) estatisticamente igual ao SE- 2 (2911, 19 Pa/s); SE- 2 apresentou valor intermediário de viscosidade aparente (332, 20 mPa. s) e, SE- 3, valores superiores para ambos os parâmetros (636, 40 mPa. s e 4248, 97 Pa/s). Os testes oscilatórios constataram a predominância do caráter elástico para os três sistemas. Por meio da termogravimetria, o perfil das três amostras foi semelhante, independentemente do tipo e concentração do tensoativo não-iônico. Observou-se a presença de fase gel cristalina para os três sistemas, sendo aparentemente mais pronunciado para o SE- 2.

The physical, physicochemical {{and chemical}} {{attributes of the}} emulsified systems {{are influenced by the}} characteristics of their internal phase droplets, such as: concentration, size and morphology. Thus, the aims involved the physical and physicochemical characterization of emulsions obtained from the stearyl alcohol condensed with 21 mols ethylene oxide (EO) (steareth- 21) and oleyl alcohol with 20 mols EO (oleth- 20), as well as, the introduction of the optical coherence tomography (OCT) as the analytical technique tool to the determination of the particle size and morphological characterization of the emulsified systems. Three formulations were prepared, differing at the surfactant used, being the emulsified system SE- 1 composed by 8. 0 % (p/p) of oleth- 20, the SE- 2 by 4. 0 % (p/p) of oleth- 20 and 4. 0 % (p/p) steareth- 21; and the SE- 3 by 8. 0 % (p/p) steareth- 21. The preliminary stability was evaluated, such as the ph value and the rheological and thermogravimetric profiles. The presence of the crystalline gel phase was determined from microscopy with polarized light and the droplet size through regular optical microscopy, laser diffraction and OCT. The samples did not present signs of instability throughout the centrifugation and thermal stress tests. The ph value was considered compatible to human skin (4. 6 to 5. 8). Systems represent the non-Newtonian pseudoplastic rheological behaviour. The SE- 1 presented inferior apparent viscosity (223. 53 mPa. s) and the hysteresis area (2238. 38 Pa/s) statistically equal to SE- 2 (2911. 19 Pa/s); the SE- 2 presented an average value of apparent viscosity (332. 20 mPa. s) and, the SE- 3, superior values to both parameters (636. 40 mPa. s and 4248. 97 Pa/s). The oscillating tests verified the elastic character predomination to the three systems. Throughout the thermogravimetry, the profile of the three samples was similar, independent from the kind and concentration of the non-ionic surfactant. The presence of the crystalline gel phase was identified at the three systems, being apparently more pronounced to the SE- 2. Either at the microscopic analysis {{as well as at the}} laser diffraction were obtained an average size of the particles minor than 6. 0 &# 181;m. According to OCT results, the particles below 6. 0 &# 181;m were not possible to be identified and the major particles were suggested be the internal phase of the systems, however new studies should be performed...|$|R
