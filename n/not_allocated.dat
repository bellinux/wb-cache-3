5|$|The ZBGM-75 Advanced Intercontinental Ballistic Missile, {{also known}} as Weapons System 120A (WS-120A), was a program to develop an {{intercontinental}} ballistic missile (ICBM), proposed by the United States Air Force in the 1960s {{as a replacement for}} the LGM-30 Minuteman as the Air Force's standard ICBM. Funding was <b>not</b> <b>allocated</b> for the program and the project was cancelled in 1967.|$|E
5|$|Development of the Canning River as {{a source}} of water for Perth was first {{proposed}} in a report of the first Metropolitan Water Works Board of Perth in 1896. Investigation of the site began in 1897 when engineer Thomas Hodgson surveyed and proposed the dam's current location as a possible site. However, despite the recommendations of further inquiries, and an extreme shortage of water in some years, government funds were <b>not</b> <b>allocated</b> {{for the construction of a}} dam until the Great Depression in the 1930s.|$|E

5|$|Svalbard is an {{archipelago}} in the Arctic Ocean {{under the}} full sovereignty of Norway, but {{is subject to}} the special status granted by the Svalbard Treaty. Jan Mayen is a remote island in the Arctic Ocean; it has no permanent population and is administrated by the County Governor of Nordland. Svalbard and Jan Mayen have in common that they are the only integrated parts of Norway <b>not</b> <b>allocated</b> to counties. While a separate ISO code for Svalbard was proposed by the United Nations, it was the Norwegian authorities who took initiative to include Jan Mayen in the code. Its official language is Norwegian.|$|E
5|$|The {{project was}} {{presented}} {{as part of the}} original proposal of the Bergen Line when approved by Parliament in 1894, but due to the narrow gauge on the Drammen Line at the time, a temporary solution via Roa was chosen instead. Later proposals have been launched, and parliament has voted over it in 1954, 1978, 1984 and 1992; only the last being passed, but not followed up by funding, and the Norwegian National Rail Administration has <b>not</b> <b>allocated</b> any date to start construction; detailed plans have however been produced.|$|E
5|$|From the 1854 {{establishment}} of railways in Norway to 1909, no dining service was offered aboard trains; passengers {{were allowed to}} bring food with them. Train stations also lacked dining facilities. The first dining service was started by restaurateur Carl Christiansen. He established the restaurant at Drammen Station, and in 1907 was asked by NSB to establish a dining service aboard the express trains on the Bergen Line, which would open in 1909. After investigating similar operations in England and Germany, he ordered two carriages from Skabo Jernbanevognfabrikk. These were {{to be paid for}} by the state, but the Parliament of Norway delayed the grants after a long debate regarding the suitability of restaurant carriages on trains. The plans were opposed by the teetotaler faction of Parliament, but there was a majority in favor of dining service. To get the carriages in time, Christiansen personally guaranteed the production cost in case a state grant was <b>not</b> <b>allocated.</b> After the parliamentary decision, the cost of the carriages was refunded by NSB. In 1910, when President of the United States Theodore Roosevelt visited Oslo to receive the Nobel Peace Prize, several restaurant carriages were ordered solely for the occasion. Two years later, restaurant carriages were put in regular service on the Østfold Line.|$|E

25|$|A small {{engine shed}} was opened {{close to the}} station in 1864, and {{extended}} in 1867.

The shed was <b>not</b> <b>allocated</b> a code by British Railways since it was deemed a sub-shed of Machynlleth, and so locomotives bore that depot's code, 89C.|$|E

There were 617 other stocks which have limited data or for which criteria for overfishing had not been defined. These stocks mostly have harvests which are not significant, so they are <b>not</b> <b>allocated</b> research funding. Their assessment can be expensive {{and there is no}} evidence of overfishing. Rebuilding strategies are operating or are being developed for most stocks which are overfished.|$|E

25|$|In the post-Soviet period, {{the members}} of the former Soviet intelligentsia have {{displayed}} diverging attitudes towards the communist regime. While the older generation of intelligentsia has attempted to frame themselves as victims, the younger generation, who were in their 30s when the Soviet Union collapsed, has <b>not</b> <b>allocated</b> so much space for the repressive experience in their self-narratives. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, the popularity and influence of the intelligentsia has significantly declined, therefore it is typical for the post-Soviet intelligentsia to feel nostalgic for the last years of the Soviet Union (perestroika), which they often regard as the golden age of the intelligentsia.|$|E
25|$|In 2007 the Edinburgh DVLA office {{exceptionally}} issued TN07 prefixed registrations {{for some}} vehicles, {{instead of the}} expected 'SN07'. This was stated to be because of potential offence caused by interpreting SN07 as 'snot'. This is the first known use of the 'T' code as the first letter, as it was <b>not</b> <b>allocated</b> to a region in the 2001 system. Also, TF07, TH07 and TJ07 registrations have been issued in Glasgow, most probably because the SA07–SJ07 allocations were exhausted. Similarly, along with TN07, TK07 has also been issued by Edinburgh, probably for the same oversubscription reason as in Glasgow. It has also been observed that the TP07 mark has also been issued.|$|E
25|$|With no {{new designs}} of nuclear weapons, the warheads in the U.S. {{stockpile}} {{must continue to}} function far past their original expected lifetimes. As components and materials age, problems can arise. Stockpile Life Extension Programs can extend system lifetimes, but they also can introduce performance uncertainties and require maintenance of outdated technologies and materials. Because there is concern that it will become increasingly difficult to maintain high confidence in the current warheads for the long term, the Department of Energy/National Nuclear Security Administration initiated the Reliable Replacement Warhead (RRW) Program. RRW designs could reduce uncertainties, ease maintenance demands, and enhance safety and security. In March 2007, the LLNL design was chosen for the Reliable Replacement Warhead. Since that time, Congress has <b>not</b> <b>allocated</b> funding for any further development of the RRW.|$|E
