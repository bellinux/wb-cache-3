40|$|The {{estrogen}} receptor protein (estrophilin) {{was determined}} in specimens from 359 primary breast cancers and from metastatic tumors of 214 patients. Ninety-eight patients were eventually treated by {{some form of}} endocrine therapy: 82 patients were treated by ablative therapy, and 16 by hormonal additive treatment. The records of 81 of the 98 patients whose tumors were characterized for estrogen receptor content and who had received some type of endocrine therapy were reviewed by a peer review group that assessed the objective data for these patients regarding objective remission or failure to treatment. A positive estrophilin determination was defined as receptor content greater than 250 fmole per gram of tumor for premenopausal females and greater than 750 fmole per gram of tumor for postmenopausal and previously castrated patients. Estrogen receptor determinations may be made from tumor specimens as small as 200 mg. Sixty-nine patients underwent some form of ablative therapy. Twenty-seven of these patients {{were found to have}} significant receptor determinations. Of those patients in whom a definite determination was made of their post-treatment response, roughly two-thirds experienced objective remissions. None of the 42 patients with <b>negative</b> estrogen receptor <b>determination</b> experienced an objective remission to ablative endocrine therapy. Only one of 6 patients with <b>negative</b> <b>determinations</b> benefited from additive hormonal therapy; 4 of 6 patients with positive determinations benefited from additive therapy. Not all women with receptor containing mammary cancer will respond favorably to endocrine therapy, but those patients whose tumors lack a critical amount of estrophilin have little chance of benefit from either endocrine ablation or hormone administration. The estrogen receptor content of the primary tumor indicates the hormonal dependency of the tumor and may be used to predict the response to endocrine treatment when recurrent disease appears...|$|R

50|$|On April 15, 2005, the Canadian Minister of Trade, Jim Peterson, {{announced}} {{that the federal government}} would provide Canadian softwood lumber associations with $20 million in compensation for their legal expenses stemming from the dispute with the United States. That same year, another NAFTA Chapter 19 panel reviewed a determination made by the USITC that the U.S. lumber industry was under a threat of injury due to Canadian imports. Since the United States ceded jurisdiction to the World Trade Organization, it was necessary for the U.S. government to establish that a domestic industry was suffering injury, or faced a threat of injury, before countervailing duties can be imposed. The NAFTA panel found the USITC's determination invalid. In addition, the panel made the controversial decision to deny the USITC to reopen the administrative record, ordering the USITC to issue a <b>negative</b> <b>determination</b> based on the existing record. Unlike the panel during the Lumber III stage, this panel's decision was unanimous. However, the U.S. government challenged its decision before an extraordinary challenge committee, which, on August 10, 2005, issued a unanimous decision against the United States, finding that the NAFTA panel's determination was not sufficiently invalid to require vacatur or remand, under the standards of NAFTA.|$|E

The upshot is that we have to consider how best to democratize the multilevel constellation that makes up the EU. Such a solution entails reconstituting democracy (rather than simply abolishing the EU or uploading nation-state democracy to the EU-level). We briefly outline three models for how to reconstitute democracy in Europe; each of which reflects the entity’s compound character. democracy; democratization; legitimacy; multilevel governance; integration theory; federalism; supranationalism...|$|E

40|$|This thesis aims {{to throw}} an {{illuminating}} {{light on the}} as yet neglected concept of nothing in Kant’s system, a concept which is taken into consideration, by Kant, {{in accordance with the}} guiding thread of the categories of the understanding. My main argument is that Kant has a fourfold division of nothing and each has a transcendental function in his system. This function is basically a limiting one; setting up <b>negative</b> <b>determinations</b> without which Kant’s system would have never been constituted as it is now. It is shown in the thesis that the concept of nothing is divided basically into four: first, nothing as ens rationis that limits and thereby protects knowledge, secondly nothing as nihil privativum that defines the boundaries of phenomenal reality, thirdly nothing as ens imaginarium that makes possible the unity of experience and finally, nothing as nihil negativum that draws the lines of logical thinking. All make, in the last resort and by being the concepts of the opposite, experience possible. The thesis consists of four chapters. The first chapter is an exposition of all four divisions of nothing, the second is the display specifically of the concepts of ens rationis and nihil negativum, and the third is of the concepts of ens imaginarium and nihil privativum. The auxiliary argument of the thesis is that while Hegel makes a strong charge of externality against and thereby severely criticizes the Kantian concept of the thing-in-itself, - the concept of which I propose to be contained under the concept of ens rationis- Kant has equally convincing arguments against such a charge. This is the topic of the fourth and final chapter which has an implicit aim of creating the image of a powerful critical Hegel {{but on the other hand}} an equally enduring and war-like Kant. Kant is presented as a philosopher who has powerful responses to institute a balance between himself and his opponent. When Kant’s differing concepts of nothing are taken into account, Hegel’s attack of externality, it is maintained, appears not to have taken into account the full measure of the resources of the Kantian position. Even when it is said that the attack is against one specific concept of the thing-in-itself alone, Kant still seems to have enough resources for toleration and defence indeed...|$|R

The dispute resulted in a Panel ruling that conforms with earlier Appellate Body decisions outlawing the use of "weighted average to transaction" zeroing in such reviews. However, we note that the Panel's stance was driven largely from a desire to preserve "stability and predictability" within the system, suggesting a practical recognition of the shadow of past Appellate Body decisions on the same legal question. In addition, we argue that to fully understand the effects of zeroing, {{it is important to}} account for the underlying reasons behind observed price changes in the market. We show that zeroing is more likely to convert a <b>negative</b> dumping <b>determination</b> into a positive one when price changes are driven by variations in demand relative to when they are driven by variations in the cost of exporting. In the present case, Brazilian exporters of orange juice experienced an increase in (residual) demand for their product since, by reducing the local supply of round oranges, adverse weather conditions in the US made it difficult for US orange juice producers to meet local demand...|$|R

40|$|AbstractINTRODUCTION:The saliva of {{mosquitoes}} {{has an important}} role in the transmission of several diseases, including malaria, and contains substances with vasomodulating and immunomodulating effects to counteract the host physiological mechanisms and enhance pathogen transmission. As immunomodulatory components, salivary gland proteins can induce the generation of specific IgG antibodies in the host, which can be used as specific biomarkers of exposure to Anopheles sundaicus. The objective of this study was to identify immunogenic proteins from the salivary glands of Anopheles sundaicus by reaction with sera from individuals living in malaria-endemic areas who are thus exposed to Anopheles mosquitoes. METHODS:IgG antibodies targeting salivary gland proteins in serum samples from individuals living in malaria-endemic areas were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Sera from healthy individuals living in non-endemic areas were used as <b>negative</b> controls. <b>Determination</b> of the presence of salivary gland immunogenic proteins was carried out by western blotting. RESULTS:Sixteen bands appeared in sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, with molecule weights ranging from 22 to 144 kDa. Among the exposed individuals, IgG responses to salivary gland proteins were variable. Protein bands with molecular weights of 46, 41, 33, and 31 kDa were the most immunogenic. These immunogenic proteins were consistently recognized by pooled serum and individual samples from people living in malaria-endemic areas but not by negative controls. CONCLUSIONS:These results support the potential use of immunogenic proteins from the salivary glands of Anopheles as candidate markers of bite exposure or in malaria vaccines...|$|R

S. marcescens also exhibits tryptophan and citrate degradation. One of the end products of tryptophan degradation is pyruvic acid, which is then incorporated into different metabolic processes of S. marcescens. A final product of citrate degradation is carbon. Thus, S. marcescens can rely on citrate as a carbon source. In identifying the organism, one may also perform a methyl red test, which determines if a microorganism performs mixed-acid fermentation.

We enrolled adults presenting with dyspnea not trauma-related, they underwent lung ultrasound, and chest X-ray studies, and NT pro-BNP level determination. Then we compared the results with the diagnosis of acute heart failure established by an independent panel of experts. 236 patients were enrolled in the study. We find sensitivity and specificity for lung ultrasound of 57. 73 and 87. 97 %, for chest X-ray 74. 49 and 86. 26 %, for NT pro-BNP 97. 59 and 27. 56 %, respectively.

However, a child refugee claimant may not be able to express subjective fear of persecution in the same manner as an adult refugee claimant. Inference of lack of subjective fear that can be drawn from the pre-application conduct of unaccompanied minors could lead to <b>negative</b> refugee <b>determination.</b> Unaccompanied minors, being not able to establish their subjective fear, though there may be objective evidence of a risk of persecution, may face denial of refugee protection.

Candidacy to be on the CCL 4 is based on a compound’s occurrence in the environment, public health toxicity and recommendation from expert opinion. Methods to qualitatively determine occurrence and toxicity for compounds were developed in this research and based off USEPA methods. This process involved looking at a large range of chemicals/compounds found in the environment from varying groups such as: disinfection bi‐products, pharmaceuticals, pesticides, inorganics, volatile organic compounds, industrial and cyanotoxins. These compounds may have been included on previous CCL lists or are contaminants of concern currently found in the drinking water industry. Data approaches such as the creation of a master sheet, space diagrams and numerical algorithms ranked compounds based on occurrence and toxicity. These data approaches, along with others, were then provided to an expert panel (TAW) that considered all of these tools, in addition to others, to develop expert opinions about the top candidates for the CCL 4.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} Papua New Guinea 2 ̆ 7 s {{track record}} in assessing and resettling asylum seekers, its current obligations under the 2013 Regional Resettlement Arrangement, and the sustainability of this arrangement. Introduction In the lead-up to the Australian Federal Election in September 2013, public attention focused dramatically on Papua New Guinea (PNG) {{in terms of the}} joint PNG–Australia Regional Resettlement Arrangement, the subject of a memorandum of understanding (MOU) signed on 6 August 2013. In short, Australia would transfer asylum seekers who arrived in Australia by boat after 19 July 2013 to PNG where their claim for refugee status would be assessed, under PNG law, and those found to be refugees would be resettled in PNG ‘and in any other participating regional, including Pacific Island, states’. (Nauru is the only other current participating regional state, with Cambodia considering resettlement of asylum seekers at the time of publication.) While the Migration Legislation Amendment (Regional Processing and Other Measures) Act 2012 provided for assessment of asylum seekers by PNG, it was the August 2013 Regional Resettlement Arrangement (mentioned as the 2013 Arrangement) that provided for resettlement in PNG, of asylum seekers determined to be refugees. In accordance with the 2013 Arrangement, the full cost of implementing the arrangement in PNG, that is, transfer, assessment, and resettlement, would be met by Australia. PNG has a track record related to the assessment and resettlement of asylum seekers. The discussion paper begins with a brief outline of PNG policy responses to West Papuan asylum seekers from neighbouring Indonesian Papua. It focuses on the permissive residence system (part of a PNG ‘Limited Integration’ policy) offered to West Papuan refugees living at the former United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) resettlement site at East Awin in Western Province since 1997. Limitations of the permissive residence permit, particularly issues related to eligibility and permit renewal, illustrate challenges faced by the PNG government and bureaucracy to design and administer a visa system. PNG’s track record of assessing and resettling West Papuan asylum seekers since 1984 is looked at against the terms of the 2013 Arrangement, which requires PNG to determine the refugee status of asylum seekers transferred by Australia to the offshore processing centre on Manus Island, review <b>negative</b> <b>determinations,</b> and resettle in PNG those determined to be refugees. The second section considers PNG’s obligations {{under the terms of the}} 2013 Arrangement. In relation to status determination, an efficient and procedurally fair determination process requires legislation i. e., domestic refugee law, and an effective immigration bureaucracy. It can be argued that neither of these elements were present at the time of the 2013 Arrangement. However, at the time of publication of this paper in mid- 2014, some status determinations and a review process had been announced. In relation to resettlement, ongoing disagreement by the PNG government over the terms of resettlement (which refugees are to be resettled, how many refugees will be resettled) threatens to undermine the terms of the 2013 Arrangement. Australia has underwritten the costs of implementing resettlement under the Arrangement, although the details are not explicit. Nor are details available about any social planning being undertaken for the resettlement of refugees. The author takes up UNHCR’s charge of a ‘xenophobic phenomenon’ in relation to the reception of non-Melanesian refugees in PNG, and offers some context. It is argued that social planning that works towards minimising inter-community tension is critical to resettlement. The 2013 Arrangement is subject to annual review by the Australian–PNG Ministerial Forum. The sustainability of the Arrangement in terms of legal challenges and security issues is the subject of the third section. Responding to the announcement of the first status determination decisions at the time of publication of this paper, the conclusion summarises some of the major issues related to PNG’s responsibilities under the Arrangement: procedurally fair assessment and review processes, and resettlement planning...|$|R
40|$|PFAD is {{potential}} {{enough to}} be developed as a biodiesel feedstock because it is cheap and always available. But the FFA in PFAD is so high, so esterification process is necessary to lower levels of the FFA. High levels of FFA PFAD and a solid form at room temperature need necessary studies to determine the needs of methanol as a reactant and reaction time esterification for high yield and characteristics of biodiesel. Esterification of PFAD were carried out to study the effect of : molar ratios of methanol to PFAD of 6 : 1 – 10 : 1 and reaction time  of 60 – 120 min. The optimum condition for esterification process was molar ratio of methanol to PFAD at 10 : 1 with 2 wt% of H 2 SO 4 at 60 ˚C and 60 min.

By using HTM and NCCLS standard M 2 -A 4, strains showing zone sizes of greater than or equal to 25 mm to AMP on HTM were considered sensitive. Intermediate strains had zone sizes of 22 to 24 mm. The majority of isolates (68 %) were sensitive to all antibiotics. Two percent of the isolates were resistant to chloramphenicol. Seventeen percent of the isolates were AMP-resistant, beta-Lac-producing strains of H. influenzae. Thirteen percent of the isolates gave at least one intermediate or resistant zone for AMP but were beta-Lac <b>negative.</b> MIC <b>determinations</b> with NCCLS standard M 7 -A 2 were performed with resistant and intermediate strains. MICs for beta-Lac-producing strains of H. influenzae were >/= 8. 0 microgram/ml. MICs for beta-Lac-negative strains were </= 1. 0 microgram/ml and were highly reproducible. If one uses the current NCCLS zone diameter interpretive criteria, results should be viewed with caution. Further investigation of zone size interpretive criteria is warranted. It is suggested that in the case of serious infections with H. influenzae, beta-Lac-negative, AMP-resistant or -intermediate strains be confirmed by the MIC procedure...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE. To {{measure the}} {{endotoxin}} concentration (EC) of 25 commercially available, hyaluronic acid- and hydroxypropylmethylcellulose-based (HPMC) ophthalmic viscosurgical devices (OVDs). METHODS. The in vitro Limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) assay, {{which indicates the}} presence of endotoxins originating from gram-negative bacteria, {{was used to determine}} the EC. The procedure was performed according to the European Pharmacopoeia/USP. EC including duplicate <b>determinations,</b> <b>negative</b> controls, dilution series with control standard endotoxin, dilution series with sample extract and positive sample control. RESULTS. 16 OVDs (Amvisc(R), Amvisc(R) Plus, Biolon(R), Coatel(R), Healon(R), Healon(R) GV, Healon(R) 5, HPMC Ophtal(R) L, Microvisc(R), Microvisc(R) Plus, Ocucoat(R), Provisc(R), Rayvisc(R), Viscoat(R), Visco Shield(R) 2 %, Visko(R) 1. 4 %) had an EC under 1. 2 endotoxin units/mL, five (Adatocel(R), HPMC Ophtal(R) H, LA Gel(R), Viscorneal(R), Viscorneal(R) Plus) had an EC {{greater than or equal to}} 1. 2 and less than or equal to 24 EU/ml, and four (Biocorneal(R), Dispasan(R) also named Ophthalin, Dispasan(R) Plus, Visko(R), 1 %) had an EC of > 24 EU/ml. DISCUSSION. To avoid viscoelastic- related inflammatory or immunological reactions, the use of pure OVDs is recommended, especially for surgical procedures with an inherent possibility of leaving viscoelastic remnants in the eye (e. g., cataract surgery, visco-canalostomy or penetrating keratoplasty) ...|$|R

40|$|In this article, we {{investigate}} which variables determine the income per capita growthrates of the Alagoas? municipalities (up to 50. 000 inhabitants) {{and of the}} Minas Gerais?municipalities (up to 50. 000 inhabitants) between 1991 and 2000. In the econometricanalysis, we do not find spatial autocorrelation in {{the model for the}} small Alagoas?municipalities. In the case of Minas Gerais? municipalities, spatial autocorrelation isverified. The econometric results show that the economic growth determinants of arelatively rich state are not identical to the determinants of a relatively poor state. In respect to the model estimation for the small Alagoas? municipalities, only theGini index is significant and <b>negative</b> in the <b>determination</b> of income per capita growthrates. Concerning the small Minas Gerais? municipalities, we get four statically significantvariables: income per capita in 1991, years of schooling, percentage of households withaccess to the lightning and Gini index. We suspect, therefore, that small municipalitiesof a relatively poor state need an additional improvement than the ones verified inhis indicators of productivity and quality of life, so that those indicators can haveeffect on the income per capita growth rates. In view of that, in the small Alagoas?municipalities, the levels of productivity and quality of life are extremely low in relationto the small Minas Gerais? municipalities. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{synthetic}} peptide comprising amino acids 6 - 35 of HPV- 16 E 7 {{was used in}} an ELISA to screen sera taken from 31 cervical carcinoma patients. Sera obtained before and during treatment, and in follow-up, were tested {{for the presence of}} antibodies to this peptide. Sixteen patients with <b>negative</b> pretreatment serum <b>determination</b> remained <b>negative</b> during treatment and follow-up. Of the 15 patients with positive pretreatment sera, 12 showed a decrease in anti-E 7 6 - 35 antibody level during treatment. During follow-up an increase in anti-E 7 - 35 antibody level was observed in 6 out of 7 patients with progressive or recurrent disease, whereas all patients who remained in complete remission showed stable or further decreasing antibody levels. During the course of disease of the 15 seropositive patients, serum anti-E 7 - 35 antibody levels were compared with serum squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCC-Ag) profiles, a clinically useful tumor marker in the management of cervical cancer patients. Similar patterns were observed in 10 out of 15 patients. The {{results of this study suggest}} that in a subset of cervical cancer patients, anti-E 7 - 35 antibody response against HPV- 16 E 7 at least partially depends on the presence of viable tumor lesions, and that to some extent the anti-E 7 profile reflects the course of disease.

40|$|Newborn {{screening}} programs use {{whole blood}} dried on filter paper {{as the standard}} specimen. Metabolites are reasonably stable and can easily be sent to screening laboratories by regular mail. The recommended sample collection procedure is to spot native blood without anticoagulants onto the filter paper, because anticoagulants can interfere with the different laboratory methods. However, visual examination of the blood spots cannot always detect contamination. In this study, whole blood was drawn by venous puncture from a healthy volunteer, spiked with the corresponding metabolites and EDTA, and spotted onto filter paper. TSH and 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone were determined by time resolved fluoroimmunoassays with the AutoDelfia system. Total galactose, biotinidase activity, and galactose- 1 -phosphate uridyltransferase activity were measured photometrically or fluorometrically. Succinyl acetone was estimated indirectly through the inhibition of porphobilinogen synthase activity (PBGS assay). EDTA, amino acids, and acylcarnitines were converted to the corresponding butyl esters, after extraction with methanol, and analysed by LC-MS/MS. EDTA contamination gives falsely elevated 17 -OHP values and falsely reduced TSH and PBGS values. The inclusion of an EDTA determination in routine screening revealed that at least 0. 06 % of newborn screening samples were contaminated with EDTA. In conclusion, non-conformity during the pre-analytical phase {{is a source of}} false positive and false <b>negative</b> screening results. <b>Determination</b> of EDTA from NBS blood spots can reliably identify these samples and prevent screening errors...|$|R

30|$|The MIC and MBC were {{performed}} by broth microdilution and spread plate method, respectively. A 0.5 McFarland-standard adjusted bacterial suspension (1 [*]×[*] 108  CFU mL− 1) was diluted with 1 : 100 ratios in MHB to obtain 1 [*]×[*] 106  CFU mL− 1. In broth microdilution method, each well of 96 -well plate contained 50  µL of DX and DX-Ag–AgCl NPs with different concentrations (0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, and 16  µg mL− 1) and 50  µL of each bacterial strain suspension (1 [*]×[*] 106 CFU mL− 1) were added separately. Two sets of 96 -well plate were prepared: one for MIC {{and another for}} MBC <b>determination.</b> <b>Negative</b> control was prepared, which contained only media; while the positive control contained bacterial strains without DX or DX-Ag–AgCl NPs. Plates were incubated for 24  h at 37  °C. After that, in one 96 -well plate, 40  µL of INT (0.2  mg mL− 1) solution was added to each well. The plate was further incubated for 30  min, to interaction of INT with enzyme dehydrogenase. Pink color formation {{can be seen in}} the presence of live cells, while there will be no color change in dead cells. The lowest dilution without color change will be indicated as the MIC. From the second plate, 100  µL of MIC concentrations was plated on MHA plate and spread with sterile glass spreader. These plates were incubated for 24  h at 37  °C. After incubation, MBC will be recorded as the lowest concentration of DX or DX-Ag–AgCl NPs that resulted in no bacterial growth.|$|R
40|$|Background: Clinical {{features}} of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) cases diagnosed by detection of {{polymerase chain reaction}} (PCR), with negative toxin enzyme immunoassay results (EIA) have not been fully elucidated. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the magnitude of CDI patients who had <b>negative</b> EIA toxin <b>determinations</b> but positive PCR tests, and their differences in clinical presentation. Methods: We performed a retrospective study comparing the clinical {{features of}} CDI cases detected by EIA (toxins A + B) with cases detected by PCR (toxin negative, PCR positive) over a 16 -month period. Only patients with an initial Clostridium difficile infection episode that fulfilled a standardized definition were included. Results: During the study period, 107 episodes of CDI were detected. Seventy-four patients (69 %) had positive glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) antigen and EIA determinations (EIA positive patients). Thirty-three patients (31 %) had GDH positive, negative toxin EIA and positive PCR determination (PCR positive patients). PCR positive patients were younger, 57 (27) years (mean [SD]), than EIA positive patients, 71 (16) years, (p < 0. 001). Fewer PCR positive patients were receiving proton pump inhibitors (21 patients, 64 %) than EIA positive patients (61 patients, 82 %, p = 0. 034). The clinical presentation was similar in both groups. In the multivariate analysis, lower age was identified as the only independent variable associated with PCR positive patients. Conclusions: One third of Clostridium difficile infection patients present negative toxin EIA and PCR positive tests. Performing PCR <b>determination</b> after the <b>negative</b> EIA test is more relevant in younger patients...|$|R
