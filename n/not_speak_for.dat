5|$|Daniel Craig was a late auditionee for {{the role}} of Geordie. At the audition, he {{performed}} the Geordie accent very poorly, however, he won the part and it came to be regarded as his breakthrough role. Mark Strong worked on the Geordie accent by studying episodes of the 1980s comedy series Auf Wiedersehen, Pet, which featured lead characters from Newcastle. Strong later claimed that Christopher Eccleston took a dislike to him, and outside of their scenes together, the pair did <b>not</b> <b>speak</b> <b>for</b> the entire period that Our Friends in the North was filming.|$|E
5|$|Their {{relationship}} was further strained in 1946 when Fontaine made negative comments to an interviewer about deHavilland's new husband, Marcus Goodrich. When she read her sister's remarks, deHavilland was deeply hurt {{and waited for}} an apology that was never offered. The following year after accepting her first Academy Award for To Each His Own, deHavilland was approached backstage by Fontaine, who extended her hand to congratulate her; deHavilland {{turned away from her}} sister. The two did <b>not</b> <b>speak</b> <b>for</b> the next five years after the incident. This may have caused an estrangement between Fontaine and her own daughters, who maintained a covert relationship with their aunt, deHavilland.|$|E
5|$|Despite their celebrated {{success at}} turning {{spectacular}} plays in collaboration, {{relations between the}} teammates {{were said to have}} been often strained. Tinker and Evers feuded for many years. On September 14, 1905, Tinker and Evers engaged in a fistfight on the field because Evers had taken a cab to the stadium and left his teammates behind in the hotel lobby. They did <b>not</b> <b>speak</b> <b>for</b> years following this event. According to some tellings, Tinker and Evers did not speak to one another again following their fight for 33 years, until they were asked to participate in the radio broadcast of the 1938 World Series, between the Cubs and the New York Yankees. Neither Tinker nor Evers knew the other had been invited. However, in 1929, Tinker joined Evers in signing a ten-week contract to perform a theatrical skit on baseball in different cities across the United States.|$|E

5|$|Irma Johnson is {{the sister}} of the late Warren Johnson and Eve Russell's aunt. When she was young, Eve had a close {{relationship}} with her aunt because of their love of gospel music. Irma is proud of Eve's singing in the church's choir; she discouraged Eve from singing jazz and blues music, calling them sinful. Their relationship became strained when Irma saw a drugged and intoxicated Eve singing in a seedy Boston jazz club and cavorting with several men. Irma disowns Eve when she discovers her relationship with Julian, who is white, and her pregnancy with his child. Eve and Irma did <b>not</b> <b>speak</b> <b>for</b> nearly 20 years. Eve paid for Irma to live in a retirement home, but told everyone she had no living relatives in an attempt to keep her past secret.|$|E
5|$|Returning to New York, he and Thomashefsky jointly leased The People's Theater, {{intending}} {{to use it}} on different nights of the week. Adler, exhausted from his Russian trip, was often leaving his nights unused, and Thomashefsky offered to buy him out for $10,000 {{on the condition that}} he would not return to performing in New York. Adler was so insulted that the two did <b>not</b> <b>speak</b> <b>for</b> months, even though at the time they were living across a courtyard from one another, and could see into each other's St. Mark's Place apartments. Adler decided to perform Tolstoy's The Power of Darkness, and decided that he would do his own translation from Russian to Yiddish. The play was a great success, the first successful production of a Tolstoy play in the U.S., and Thomashefsky was so obviously happy for Adler that their friendship was renewed. Adler followed with equally successful productions of Gordin's dramatization of Tolstoy's Resurrection and the Gordin original The Homeless.|$|E

25|$|Harry became {{estranged from}} his son Gordon, known as Roy {{following}} Denis' death and they did <b>not</b> <b>speak</b> <b>for</b> {{the last twenty years}} of Roy's life. Roy died of cancer in 2002 aged 75.|$|E

25|$|Indeed, in {{initiating}} his columns, Mbeki stated {{his view}} {{that the bulk of}} South African media sources did <b>not</b> <b>speak</b> <b>for</b> or to the South African majority, and stated his intent to use ANC Today to speak directly to his constituents rather than through the media.|$|E

25|$|The {{newspaper}} {{has been}} described by some scholars as a mouthpiece for Falun Gong, connected with the group and carrying sympathetic coverage of it. A spokesperson for the newspaper says it does <b>not</b> <b>speak</b> <b>for</b> the practice. The newspaper maintains a generally anti-communist editorial stance, including explicit opposition to the Communist Party of China.|$|E
25|$|On rare occasions, panellists will {{challenge}} themselves, usually by mistake or for laughs. The game rewards {{those who make}} entertaining challenges, {{even if they do}} <b>not</b> <b>speak</b> <b>for</b> very long. If successful, last-second challenges can be especially rewarding, as they allow one to speak for a short time but earn two points—one for the challenge and one for being the last speaker.|$|E
25|$|James Dobson {{was born}} to Myrtle Georgia (née Dillingham) and James C. Dobson, Sr., on April 21, 1936, in Shreveport, Louisiana. From his {{earliest}} childhood, religion played a central part in his life. He once told a reporter that he learned to pray before he learned to talk, and says he gave his life to Jesus {{at the age of}} three, in response to an altar call by his father. He is the son, grandson, and great-grandson of Church of the Nazarene ministers, although he does <b>not</b> <b>speak</b> <b>for</b> the denomination in any capacity.|$|E

5000|$|Saint Bernardino of Siena in his preaching told of {{the family}} of a {{cardinal}} who, having arrived in Benevento, joined a nighttime banquet, and brought with him a girl he knew, who had <b>not</b> <b>spoken</b> <b>for</b> three years; later it was discovered that she was a janara.|$|R
60|$|He studies her at his leisure, <b>not</b> <b>speaking</b> <b>for</b> a time. She too studies {{something}} at her leisure. She {{is not the}} first to speak, appearing indeed so unlikely to be so, though he stood there until midnight, that even he is driven upon breaking silence.|$|R
25|$|Royer {{attended}} the first International Congress on Woman’s Rights in 1878 but did <b>not</b> <b>speak.</b> <b>For</b> the Congress in 1889 {{she was asked}} by Maria Deraismes, to chair the historical section. In her address she argued that the immediate introduction of women's suffrage was {{likely to lead to}} an increase {{in the power of the}} church and that the first priority should be to establish secular education for women. Similar elitist views were held by many French feminists at the time who feared a return to the monarchy with its strong links to the conservative Roman Catholic Church.|$|E
25|$|Butkus' {{retirement}} {{came with}} four years remaining on {{a five-year contract}} with the Bears, which was to pay him $115,000 per year through 1977, came with a no-cut, no-trade clause, and was payable even if surgery was needed. The contract also promised necessary medical and hospital care which, according to Butkus, the Bears neglected to provide him, causing irreparable damage to his knee. The Bears also informed him {{he would not be}} paid if he could not play. He filed a suit against the Bears' team doctor in May 1974 asking for $600,000 in compensatory damages and $1 million in punitive damages. It was eventually settled out of court when the Bears agreed to pay Butkus the full value of his contract. The episode caused a rift between Butkus and Bears owner George Halas, and the two did <b>not</b> <b>speak</b> <b>for</b> the next five years.|$|E
25|$|God's {{word came}} to Jeremiah {{to say that}} before God formed him in the womb, God knew him, sanctified him, and {{appointed}} him a prophet to the nations. Jeremiah protested that he could <b>not</b> <b>speak,</b> <b>for</b> he was a child, but God {{told him not to}} fear, for he would go wherever God would send him, say whatever God would command him to say, and God would be with him to deliver him. Then God touched Jeremiah's mouth and said that God had put words in his mouth and set him over the nations to root out and to pull down, to destroy and to overthrow, to build and to plant. God asked Jeremiah what he saw, he replied that he saw the rod of an almond tree, and God said that he had seen well, for God watches over God's word to perform it.|$|E
6000|$|We had <b>not</b> <b>spoken</b> <b>for</b> an hour, and I {{naturally}} asked him, Where? His {{answer was}} delayed by our {{getting into the}} Piazzetta. I stepped ashore first {{and then turned to}} help him. As he took my hand he met my eyes, consciously, and it came. [...] "To Smyrna!" ...|$|R
60|$|At {{first he}} was obdurate. Nothing that the high officer of police could say would move his medical dictum. Lord Radclyffe was too ill to see any one. He was hardly conscious. His brain was working very feebly. He had <b>not</b> <b>spoken</b> <b>for</b> two days, for speech was difficult.|$|R
60|$|I nodded my head. At {{that moment}} I could <b>not</b> have <b>spoken</b> <b>for</b> worlds.|$|R
25|$|Xu Hai, {{wounded and}} {{bogged down in}} the siege, was shocked to hear that Wang Zhi was {{negotiating}} his own surrender with Hu Zongxian, and that Mao Haifeng was already helping Hu put down pirates in the Hangzhou Bay. Xu Hai told Hu's agents that while he could be induced to surrender, he could <b>not</b> <b>speak</b> <b>for</b> his ally Chen Dong, upon which the agents bluffed that Chen Dong had already reached {{an agreement with the}} government. This made Xu Hai tremendously suspicious of Chen Dong, who grew restless learning that Xu Hai was seeing government agents. Xu Hai eventually agreed to surrender on the condition that Hu Zongxian would secure his pardon and mollify his Japanese followers with gifts. Approximately a month into the siege, Xu Hai released 200 Ming prisoners as a sign of goodwill and withdrew from Tongxiang. Chen Dong found himself abandoned by his ally and angrily attacked Tongxiang for one more day before retreating in another direction.|$|E
