5|$|Although {{most of the}} defences were {{in place}} by the time of Ranulph's death in 1232, there were <b>no</b> <b>living</b> <b>quarters,</b> and neither were there on the death of Ranulph's {{successor}} John in 1237. John died without a male heir, allowing King Henry III to take over the Earldom of Cheshire. Henry enlarged Beeston Castle during his wars with Wales, and used it as a prison for his Welsh captives. No attempt was made to equip the castle as a permanent residence with halls and chambers; garrisons were probably housed in wooden structures within the outer bailey.|$|E
50|$|Ultimately {{the fire}} {{brought about the}} end of Rogers House's long {{existence}} as both dormitory and schoolhouse. Save for the Headmaster's house attached {{to the back of the}} building, there would be <b>no</b> <b>living</b> <b>quarters</b> in Rogers House, which from this point forward would house only classrooms, laboratories and the school's administration offices. Drawing from some of the lessons of the 1981 fire, in 1983 a brand new, three storey residence (dubbed New House) for teachers and students was constructed using a cinderblock design to render the building as fireproof as possible. The end of the 1980s also saw the complete renovation of Firth House, again changing the function of a formerly dual-use building - classrooms in Firth House were eliminated in favour of new residences for teachers and the building became entirely residential in nature.|$|E

[...] The current home of the club is at 9 Linden St., steps from Harvard Yard and a few blocks from Harvard Square. It was designed by James Purdon H'1895 in the neo-Georgian style and occupied in 1902-03. The design features the red brick and cornices typical of Harvard Yard. The interior contains numerous large common spaces and an oversize formal dining room on the 2nd floor for large events, <b>no</b> <b>living</b> <b>quarters,</b> and a regulation squash court.
