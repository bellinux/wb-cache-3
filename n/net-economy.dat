40|$|This {{articles}} {{examines the}} peculiar role of mimetic behaviors in co-location processes. We start showing that geographical proximity between agents and/or firms {{is not a}} sufficient nor necessary condition for the collective performance of clusters. Other types of socio-economic proximities characterize clusters, and our purpose is to show that, among the several ways to analyze the complex links between proximities and clusters, the theoretical outlook on {{the role played by}} mimetic interactions in co-location processes are certainly one of the most promising. Mimetic behaviors of location (in economics and sociology) are introduced in order to demonstrate that co-location processes can be the result of sequentiality, uncertainty, legitimacy and non market interactions, rather than full rational and isolated decisions and pure strategic market interactions. According to the type of mimetic behavior at work in the clustering process, the nature of socio-economic proximity can differ and have a strong influence of the “evolutionary stability” of clusters. All these theoretical considerations are illustrated through the emblematic French case of “Silicon Sentier”, cluster which has gathered together three hundred firms of the French <b>net-economy</b> (the famous “dotcom”) during the Internet bubble swelling. cluster, mimetic interactions, proximity, stability, Silicon Sentier...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{explores the}} {{structural}} changes, {{in response to}} internationalization, in an important traditional activity (food chain, meat processing) in a typical 'district area'. In the paper, {{attention is focused on}} the 'Institutional structure of production' (Coase, R. 1992) and the cluster is considered as a whole, as a complex economic player, capable of generating coherent action, regulated by institutional mechanisms, and founded on a set of 'public assets' which make up its 'social capital'. The paper is based on many empirical studies and surveys aimed at exploring the structure of SMEs {{and the role of the}} local institutions: the changes observed over time and in response to internationalization underline the reinforcement of the activity's cluster configuration. These features emphasize the existence of a specific unit of analysis, indivisible from the individuals which constitute it. The discussion touches on the classical themes of the efficiency of the <b>net-economy</b> based on SMEs, and their prospects in a context of growing globalization. The paper does not aim to enter into the debate on the origins and mechanism of innovation. However, the case study does illustrate the strength of the hypothesis of a unit of analysis different from the firm for discussion of a number of topics: some empirical examples of innovation, of significance for the economic consolidation of the ID, highlight the importance of district relationships in the production and spread of innovation...|$|E
