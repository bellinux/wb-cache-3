In 1959, it was instead decided to make this <b>new</b> <b>link</b> a westward extension of Highway11; a major renumbering took place on April1, 1960: Highway11 was established between Rainy River and Fort Frances, Highway71 was truncated west of the Highway70 junction, and the entirety of Highway70 was renumbered as Highway71.|$|E
5|$|A plan {{to fill in}} {{a section}} of the canal in Nottingham {{resulted}} in a number of letters appearing in the local press in 1963, and a student at Kesteven College produced a report {{on the state of the}} canal, which was presented to the Grantham Civic Society. In 1970, the British Waterways Board attempted to obtain an act of parliament which would have allowed them to cease maintaining the water levels of the canal. The Inland Waterways Association campaigned against the bill, and the clause was amended. The Grantham Canal Society was formed soon afterwards, to promote restoration of the waterway. In 1974, a National Boat Rally was held at Nottingham, to gain support for the restoration scheme, and to promote the idea of a <b>new</b> <b>link</b> to the Trent, which would pass through old gravel workings.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} sees Taunton's {{traffic congestion}} problems {{as a serious}} obstacle to its continuing economic growth. An {{important part of the}} government's growth strategy for the town is new road infrastructure consisting of a <b>new</b> <b>link</b> road (Taunton's Third Way) which was completed 27 September 2011 at a cost of £7.5 million. A second link road, (the Northern Inner Distributor Road) planned for completion by the end of 2014 at a cost of £21 million, is still unfinished in 2016, with no completion in the near future. The road would link Staplegrove Road with Priory Avenue, running across Station Road.|$|E

5|$|The station's opening {{effectively}} {{filled a}} gap in provision, as lines in the area had already been constructed; the Whiteinch and Stobcross Railways both opened in 1874, but no station was constructed on these lines at Jordanhill. A <b>new</b> <b>link</b> allowed services to Whiteinch Victoria Park to begin in 1897, but they ceased in 1951 and the link was closed to freight in 1967.

This helps reduce the need to establish <b>new</b> <b>links.</b>|$|R
