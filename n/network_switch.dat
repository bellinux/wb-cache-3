5|$|In February 2014, several {{software}} and hardware improvements were introduced for Juniper routers, including a series of software applications ISPs could use to provide internet-based services to consumers. In December 2014, Juniper introduced a <b>network</b> <b>switch,</b> OCX1100, that could run on either the Junos operating system or the Open Compute Project open-source software.|$|E
5|$|TouchWave, Inc. (now WebCom), was {{a privately}} held Palo Alto, California IP-telephony <b>network</b> <b>switch</b> {{provider}} founded in 1997. TouchWave developed a product line called WebSwitch {{that was designed}} to replace traditional private telephone exchange systems in small-to-medium-sized companies. WebSwitch was part of a phone system that incorporates communication features provided by the Internet. The rapid success of TouchWave was memorialized with awards and an acquisition by Ericsson Communications for $46M two years after TouchWave was founded. Ericsson continued the TouchWave product line under the name WebCom, but its efforts have been viewed as less than successful.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} WRT54G {{was first}} released in December 2002.

25|$|It is not {{available}} to Cablevision customers in Lakewood, Seaside Heights and southern Monmouth County, even though Cablevision carries other Philadelphia stations on these systems. Cablevision (previously Harte-Hanks Cable and Monmouth Cablevision) in the Asbury Park area of Monmouth County carried KYW-TV until September 10, 1995, when WCAU replaced KYW on that system after the <b>network</b> <b>switch.</b> Verizon FiOS carries KYW in Upper Freehold Township, {{while the rest of}} the county gets only New York City area stations on FiOS, except for portions of southern Howell Township, which get WPVI from the Ocean County feed. DirecTV and Dish Network do not carry any Philadelphia stations in any area outside the Philadelphia market.|$|E
25|$|When {{the station}} gained the Fox {{affiliation}} on January 1, 1989, it retained a news schedule {{similar to the}} one it had as an NBC affiliate; in its early years with Fox, local news programming on the station ran on weekdays from 6:00 to 9:00a.m., 12:00 to 1:00p.m., 5:00 to 7:00p.m., weekends from 6:00 to 6:30p.m. and nightly from 10:00 to 11:00p.m. The station became the second Fox affiliate to have a weekday morning newscast as a result and was the first one with weeknight 5:00 and 6:00p.m. newscasts. On the date of the <b>network</b> <b>switch,</b> WSVN debuted a locally produced early evening news magazine program, Inside Story; the program eventually evolved into its present entertainment-based format as 7:30 (in reference to its timeslot) in 1994, and later changed its title to the current Deco Drive in 1996.|$|E

25|$|At {{the time}} it signed the {{contract}} with CBS, KTVT began airing The Price Is Right and The Bold and the Beautiful within its daytime schedule, after KDFW chose to pre-empt the CBS Daytime programs respectively in favor of Donahue and an expanded midday newscast {{as part of its}} transition to Fox; Channel 11 also cleared select CBS prime time programs that KDFW-TV pre-empted in order to run locally produced specials. On the evening of July 1, 1995 at 10:00p.m., during the station's telecast of a Major League Baseball game between the Texas Rangers and the Seattle Mariners, Ed Trimble, KTVT's {{vice president and general manager}} at the time, delivered an on-air message informing viewers of the forthcoming network changes (David Whitaker, then the vice president and general manager at KDFW, also conducted a segment on the <b>network</b> <b>switch</b> that aired concurrently on channel 4; KTVT had aired a half-hour special detailing network affiliation changes involving channel 11, KDFW and KDAF, Are You Ready for This?, preceding the game earlier that evening).|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} of the <b>network</b> <b>switch,</b> Gaylord had already begun winding down its {{television}} interests, selling its network affiliates, independent stations and cable networks to other groups. On April 12, 1999, Gaylord announced its formal exit from television when the company agreed to sell KTVT—which had become the company's lone remaining broadcast television property—to CBS Television Stations for $485 million. In September of that year, Viacom announced its intention to merge with (the original) CBS Corporation for $36 billion; when the purchase was finalized, KTVT formed a duopoly with then-UPN station KTXA {{as a result of the}} integration of CBS's group of owned-and-operated stations into Viacom's Paramount Stations Group subsidiary, a transaction that effectively reunited KTVT with KSTW under common ownership. Subsequently, KTXA relocated from its existing facilities at the Paramount Building in downtown Dallas and integrated its business operations with KTVT at its Bridge Street facility in Fort Worth. On January 3, 2006, the original Viacom split into two companies; one being the 'new' Viacom, the other being the newly-minted CBS Corporation, which included CBS' Television Stations division; as a result, channel 11 became part of the new CBS Corporation.|$|E
25|$|On {{the date}} of the <b>network</b> <b>switch,</b> KDFW also debuted a daily local sports news program within its 9:00p.m. newscast, Sports 4 Texas, which also served as a {{generalized}} branding for its sports segments until January 1997; the program – which ran for 20 minutes on Monday through Friday nights (as well as Saturdays, {{with the exception of the}} NFL season, when the prime time newscast was abbreviated by a half-hour to air the Cowboys magazine show The Aikman-Summerall Report), and for a half-hour on Sundays – eventually evolved into its present weekly half-hour format as Fox 4 Sports Sunday in September 1997, when KDFW discontinued the weekend editions of its 10:00p.m. newscast, relegating that newscast to Monday through Friday evenings (Fox late night programming airs on Saturdays at 10:00p.m., while Sports Sunday airs Sundays in that time slot). In advance of the switch, KDFW station management offered news department employees a one-month pay bonus as an incentive to agree to stay until or after the affiliation switch. Because Fox did not have a news division – and by association, an affiliate news service – at the time KDFW joined the network (Fox News Channel and the Fox News Edge video service would not launch until August 1996), the station's news department initially relied on external video feeds from CNN Newsource for coverage of national and international news stories; the station also increased its news staff from 80 to 120 employees, through the hiring of 40 additional employees in both on-air and behind-the-scenes roles.|$|E

2500|$|As {{part of the}} {{reorganization}} of the broadcasting assets {{in the wake of}} the acquisitions, on September 13, 1926, the formation of the National Broadcasting Company was announced via newspaper advertisements, and on November 15, 1926 NBC's first broadcast was made. [...] This first broadcast on November 15, 1926 marked NBC's de facto formation of the NBC Red Network from the WEAF network assets, using WEAF as the [...] "key station"; this network in eventual popular image tended to broadcast the most popular entertainment programming. [...] RCA merged its former radio operations into NBC, and on January 1, 1927, WJZ became the [...] "key station" [...] of the Blue Network when its <b>network</b> <b>switch</b> operations began; this network, again in eventual popular image, tended to place its focus more on news and public affairs programming, as well as the [...] "sustaining", or non-sponsored shows.|$|E
2500|$|WSVN's success also {{influenced}} how newscasts on other Fox affiliates would look in later years; the station's {{decision to take}} on a news-intensive schedule would eventually serve as the template for the programming formats of the former [...] "Big Three" [...] stations that switched to Fox {{as a result of its}} 1994 affiliation agreement with New World Communications and certain transactions related to the deal, and was gradually adopted by many heritage Fox stations and certain news-producing stations that are not affiliated with the network, NBC, CBS or ABC. It was also the first station to take a cue from CNN, integrating its newsroom and studio into one large area, which the station has termed the [...] "newsplex". It evolved out of their initial two sets around the time of the <b>network</b> <b>switch</b> in the late 1980s: one used for its morning and 5:00p.m. newscasts, which was a small, enclosed area in the newsroom, and its main set, which was positioned in the station's control room. Other stations and networks, both in the U.S. and internationally, have taken cues from WSVN's set. The overall format was successful enough in Miami that in 1993, Ed Ansin assigned Cheatwood to overhaul Sunbeam's newly acquired Boston station WHDH, incorporating a considerably watered-down version of the WSVN format for its newscasts; as in Miami, the tabloid style helped WHDH rise from a perennial third place into a contender for first in the news ratings (against the more traditional WCVB-TV). WHDH uses many visual cues taken from WSVN including the use of flashy graphics, distinct music packages composed by Chris Crane (who has composed the various custom news themes used by WSVN since 1991) and a similarly designed [...] "newsplex" [...] set; WSVN's [...] "circle 7" [...] logo was also adopted by WHDH after Sunbeam assumed ownership.|$|E
