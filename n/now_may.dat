5|$|Odd Horten is an overcautious 67-year-old {{man about}} to retire after forty {{years as a}} train driver on the route between Oslo and Bergen. As he awakes, he goes through a meticulous daily routine, as he prepares for his second-to-last time driving the train to Bergen. When he gets there, he makes small talk with Svea, who owns the {{boarding}} house where he stays when there and whom he <b>now</b> <b>may</b> never see again.|$|E
5|$|Since 1971, {{additional}} piecemeal amendments {{have been}} added in response to federal developments. Amendments ratified by the voters reduced the voting age to eighteen to conform with the Twenty-sixth Amendment, removed residency requirements for voting, and conformed voter registration to the Motor Voter Act. A legislative session <b>now</b> <b>may</b> be called after a Governor's veto. Virginia joined thirty-two other states in 1996 by amending its Constitution to provide for rights of victims of crime. Since 1996 Virginia and other states have adopted a provision protecting {{the right of the}} people to hunt, fish and harvest game.|$|E

Indictment could be made with a two-thirds vote, and the grand jury voted to indict the defendants. Thomas Knight, Jr. by <b>now</b> (<b>May</b> 1935) Lieutenant Governor, was appointed special prosecutor to the cases.|$|E
25|$|The {{translation}} of cuneiform documents is quite difficult, {{especially given the}} damaged nature of much source material. Additionally, {{our knowledge of the}} underlying languages, like Akkadian and Sumerian, have evolved over time, so a translation done <b>now</b> <b>may</b> be quite different than one done in AD 1900. The result of all this is that there can be honest disagreement what the document really says. Worse yet, many archaeological finds have not yet been published, much less translated. Those held in private collections may never be.|$|E
25|$|Immediately {{after the}} revolution, basic {{democratic}} rights were reestablished in Portugal. On 27 April, political prisoners were freed. On April 30, Álvaro Cunhal returned to Lisbon, {{where he was}} received by thousands of people. May Day was commemorated {{for the first time}} in 48 years, and an estimated half million people gathered in the FNAT Stadium (<b>now</b> <b>May</b> 1 Stadium) in Lisbon to hear speeches by Cunhal and the socialist Mário Soares. On May 17, the party's newspaper, Avante!, produced the first legal issue in its history.|$|E

Historically this was only done in cooperation with large industrial consumers, but <b>now</b> <b>may</b> be expanded to entire grids. For instance a few large scale projects in Europe link variations in wind power to change industrial food freezer loads, causing small variations in temperature. If communicated on a grid-wide scale, small changes to heating/cooling temperatures would instantly change consumption across the grid.|$|E
500|$|North Carolina Highway 2A (NC 2A) was a {{state highway}} located in {{southern}} Moore County, in the U.S. state of North Carolina. The highway traveled from an intersection with U.S. Route 1 (US 1), <b>now</b> <b>May</b> Street, northward through portions of Manly and Southern Pines to an intersection with NC 22 (now US 1). The highway was first listed {{as part of the}} Moore County road system by at least 1930. The route was improved to a paved surface by 1936. NC 2A was numbered sometime between 1945 and 1949. By 1952, it was cancelled and Highway 2 was designated over the route. It has since been numbered Secondary Road 2029 (SR 2029).|$|E
500|$|The men's {{magazine}} Playboy ignited her career, and she {{was featured}} in numerous issues. It has been conjectured that Playboy was a pioneer in starting an American [...] "breast fetish" [...] which has exaggerated the importance of large breasts, in which both Jayne Mansfield and Marilyn Monroe, featured in the early issues of the magazine, played significant roles. Playboy pictorials of Mansfield and Monroe {{were part of the}} emerging trend that gave birth to the large-breasted feminine ideal and men's magazines including Rogue, Nugget and Dude. Numerous other magazines featured her on the cover. These include: Hollywood Studio Magazine: Then And <b>Now</b> (<b>May</b> 1987, Volume 20, No. 5.), Life Magazine (April 23, 1956), Modern Man: The Adult Picture Magazine (March 1966), Photo-Rama Magazine (Volume 6, No. 16) and Playboy (June 1963).|$|E

500|$|At {{the start}} of the 1902 rugby season in May, Verge was up for {{selection}} to the University first XV, either at fullback or threequarter, and also for NSW as fullback. He took the place at fullback on the University XV from A. J. McKenzie. By June 1902, Verge was gaining recognition in the press. The Referee reported: [...] "Verge, as full back, deserves a special word of praise for quickness and all-round ability: he has steadily improved until he <b>now</b> <b>may</b> be compared with any man we have in the position. And he is likely to still further improve." [...] After a lacklustre performance by John Maund at fullback in the first inter-state match between NSW and Queensland, Verge gained his first cap for NSW in the return match on 19 July 1902 at University Oval, Sydney.|$|E
500|$|Potts {{declares}} that [...] "this Countie of Lancashire ... <b>now</b> <b>may</b> lawfully bee said to abound asmuch in Witches of divers kinds as Seminaries, Jesuites, and Papists", and describes the three accused women as having once been [...] "obstinate Papists, and now came to Church". The judges {{would certainly have}} been keen to be regarded by King James, {{the head of the}} judiciary, as having dealt resolutely with Catholic recusants as well as with witchcraft, the [...] "two big threats to Jacobean order in Lancashire". Samlesbury Hall, the family home of the Southworths, was suspected by the authorities of being a refuge for Catholic priests, and it was under secret government surveillance for some considerable time before the trial of 1612. It may be that JP Robert Holden was at least partially motivated in his investigations by a desire to [...] "smoke out its Jesuit chaplain", Christopher Southworth.|$|E
500|$|The Simpsons uses a {{floating}} timeline {{in which the}} characters do not age or age very little, and as such, the show is always assumed to be set in the current year. In several episodes, events {{have been linked to}} specific times, though sometimes this timeline has been contradicted in subsequent episodes. Bart's year of birth was stated in [...] "I Married Marge" [...] (season three, 1991) as being in the early 1980s. In [...] "Simpsorama" [...] (season 26, 2014) Bart states his birthday as February 23. He lived with his parents in the Lower East Side of Springfield until the Simpsons bought their first house. When Lisa was born, Bart was at first jealous of the attention she received, but he soon warmed to her when he discovered that [...] "Bart" [...] was her first word. Bart's first day of school was in the early 1990s. His initial enthusiasm was crushed by an uncaring teacher and Marge became worried that something was truly wrong with Bart. One day during recess, Bart met Milhouse and started entertaining him and other students with various gestures and rude words. Principal Skinner told him [...] "you've just started school, and the path you choose <b>now</b> <b>may</b> be the one you follow {{for the rest of your}} life! Now, what do you say?" [...] In his moment of truth, Bart responded, [...] "eat my shorts". The episode [...] "That '90s Show" [...] (season nineteen, 2008) contradicted much of the backstory's time frame; for example, it was revealed that Homer and Marge were childless in the early 1990s.|$|E

2500|$|Modules, generally, {{communicate}} with the kernel using a module interface of some sort.

2500|$|Birds {{frequent}} the mountains, {{some as a}} {{migratory path}} and others as native species. The migratory birds often use the area to the west as an overwintering area, and migrate north along the western slopes. In the northern canyons birds may be divided into different habitats, or more specifically, {{the different types of}} forest, leading to differences in range by altitude. Some of this difference by altitude may even extend the range of some species, enabling tropical species to use the mountain valleys for migration. Bird species endemic to the Sierra Madre Occidental include tufted jay, the [...] "gray-eared" [...] subspecies of red warbler, eared quetzal, thick-billed parrot, and formerly included the imperial woodpecker, which <b>now</b> <b>may</b> be extinct.|$|E
2500|$|A theory {{called the}} [...] "primrose path" [...] is {{intended}} to explain how preference reversal can lead to addiction in the long run. As an example, a lifetime of sobriety may be more highly valued than a lifetime of alcoholism, but, at the same time, one drink <b>now</b> <b>may</b> be more highly valued than not drinking now. [...] Because it is always [...] "now," [...] the drink is always chosen, and a paradoxical effect occurs whereby the more-valued long-term alternative is not achieved because the more-valued short-term alternative is always chosen. This {{is an example of}} complex ambivalence, when a choice is made not between two concrete alternatives but between one immediate and tangible alternative (i.e., having a drink) and one delayed and abstract alternative (i.e., sobriety).|$|E
2500|$|The {{government}} appealed, {{and by a}} 2–1 margin the jury's {{verdict was}} restored. Robert Arthur Sprecher, following United States v. Shryock, an earlier case from the Fifth Circuit where the defendant had been {{the head of the}} leasing department at a new-car dealership, held that the ongoing nature of the scheme distinguished the case and supported the jury verdict. But concurring Judge Richard Dickson Cudahy, calling the statute [...] "judicially [...] " [...] warned that [...] "the present case takes us to what (for <b>now)</b> <b>may</b> be the outer limits". Luther Merritt Swygert dissented. [...] "The mailings did not conceal the fraud, produce profit for Galloway or contribute to the consumer's harm," [...] he wrote. [...] "The mailings resulted from a transaction to which Galloway was not a party and they were routine business mailings the purposes of which were immaterial to Galloway." [...] He distinguished that case from Shryock by noting that Shryock had been a retail dealer, selling directly to consumers, instead of a wholesaler.|$|E
