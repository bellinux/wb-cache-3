40|$|A {{technique}} is described for measuring objectively and quantitatively {{the reaction of}} sensitized guinea pigs when exposed to an aerosol of specific antigen. The principle involves registration by semi-automatic means {{of the number of}} coughs produced in animals passively sensitized with known amounts of antibody. The number of coughs is shown to be linearly related to log dose of antibody within a limited range and a dose-response curve is presented. The cough produced by this procedure is not inhibited by the antitussive drugs, codeine and propadrine, but can be inhibited by anti-allergic agents, such as cortisone and an antihistaminic drug. It is also inhibited by <b>narcotine.</b> The last is the only compound so far tested which suppresses both the cough produced by this procedure and that produced by a simple irritant.

40|$|The present paper {{describes}} the methodological optimization and validation of a capillary zone electrophoresis method for the rapid determination of heroin, secondary products and additives present in clandestine heroin samples, by using 20 mM β-cyclodextrins in phosphate buffer, pH 3. 23. Applied potential was 15 kV and separation temperature was 24 °C; detection was by UV absorption at 200 nm wavelength. Heroin samples were first dissolved in CHCl 3 -MeOH (96 : 4, v/v) and injected by pressure (0. 5 p. s. i., 3 s; 1 p. s. i. = 6894. 76 Pa) after evaporation {{of the organic}} mixture and reconstitution in aqueous buffer. Under the described conditions, phenylethylamine (internal standard), morphine, monoacetylmorphine, heroin, acetylcodeine, papaverine, codeine and <b>narcotine</b> were baseline resolved in less than 10 min. The limit of detection was better than 1 μg/ml for each analyte. The study of the intra-day and day-to-day precision showed, in terms of migration times, RSDs ≤ 0. 71 % and, in terms of peak areas, RSDs ≤ 3. 2 %. Also, the evaluation of linearity and analytical accuracy of the method provided good results for all the analytes investigated, thus allowing its application to real cases of seized controlled drug preparations. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.

40|$|As {{a result}} of our {{extensive}} work on the alkaloids of Turkish Papaver species the pres-ence of several chemotypes has been shown. Among these chemotypes, medicinally impor-tant alkaloids such as noscapine (=narcotine), papaverine- and thebaine-containing samples have been found as new sources for the production of them. The infraspecific variation encountered within the Papaver species has been demon-strated mainly in two sections of the genus, Miltantha and Oxytona. The alkaloids of seven species (Papaver armeniacum, P. curviscapum, P. cylindricum, P. fugax, P. persicum, P. poly-chaetum, and P. triniifolium) of the section Miltantha have been studied, and the existence of chemical strains has been shown mainly in P. fugax, P. persicum, and P. triniifolium. Investigations on the species of the section Oxytona indicated that there is a relation-ship between the major alkaloid content and the chromosome numbers of the samples. Isolation of new secoberbine-type alkaloids as well as promorphinane- and morphi-nane-types has revealed the biosynthetic relationship between the alkaloids of Miltantha and Oxytona species. Chemical races are also known for species of Papaver within other sections of the genus.

40|$|Wounding is {{required}} {{to be made in}} the walls of the green seed pod of Opium poppy prior exudation of latex. To withstand this kind of trauma plants regulate expression of some metabolites through an induced transcript level. 167 unique wound-inducible ESTs were identified by a repetitive round of cDNA subtraction after 5 hours of wounding in Papaver somniferum seedlings. Further repetitive reverse northern analysis of these ESTs revealed 80 transcripts showing more than two fold induction, validated through semi-quantitative RT-PCR & real time expression analysis. One of the major classified categories among identified ESTs belonged to benzylisoquinoline transcripts. Tissue specific metabolite analysis of benzylisoquinoline alkaloids (BIAs) in response to wounding revealed increased accumulation of <b>narcotine</b> and papaverine. Promoter analysis of seven transcripts of BIAs pathway showed the presence of W-box cis-element with the consensus sequence of TGAC, which is the proposed binding site for WRKY type transcription factors. One of the Wound inducible 'WRKY' EST isolated from our subtracted library was made full-length and named as 'PsWRKY'. Bacterially expressed PsWRKY interacted with the W-box element having consensus sequence TTGACT/C present in the promoter region of BIAs biosynthetic pathway genes. PsWRKY further activated the TYDC promoter in yeast and transiently in tobacco BY 2 cells. Preferential expression of PsWRKY in straw and capsule and its interaction with consensus W-box element present in BIAs pathway gene transcripts suggest its possible involvement in the wound induced regulation of BIAs pathway...|$|E
40|$|Poppy (Papaver somniferum L.) {{produces}} sec-ondary metabolites, {{which have}} {{important roles in}} self-defence processes – alkaloids (Szabo et al. 2003). Pothier and Goland (2005) described as major alkaloids contained in poppy morphine, codeine, thebaine, papaverine, <b>narcotine</b> (noscap-ine). Poppy capsules with a high alkaloid content are of great importance to the pharmaceutical industry (Szucs et al. 2002). On the contrary, a mutation-breeding programme using γ-rays and ethyl methane sulphonate was carried out for genetic conversion of narcotic opium poppy into non-narcotic seed poppy (Sharma et al. 1999). Poppy, despite the low Cd concentrations in the soil, reaches the highest Cd concentrations in the seeds (Chizzola 1997). Chizzola et al. (2003), Tlustoš et al. (1997) and Pavlíková et al. (1997) confirmed a high tendency of the poppy to ac-cumulate heavy metals, above all Cd and Pb and also semi-metal arsenic. As Pavlíková et al. (1997) found, spraying of poppy during the growing sea-son by potassium humate resulted in a significant growth of Cd and Zn contents in the plant. The concentration of alkaloids in capsules is affected by many factors. Kadar et al. (2001) reported an increase of alkaloids in capsules {{as the result of}} N fertilisation, while it generally decreased following P fertilisation. Also irregular stress effects change the alkaloid content of poppies. Szabo et al. (2003) observed that drought stress resulted in higher levels of the alkaloids whereas mycotoxin stress did not result in significant differences. As reported by Morimoto et al. (2001), in response to stress, morphine is quickly metabolised to bismorphine consisting of two morphine units. Bismorphine binds predominantly to pectins possessing high galacturonic acid residue contents through ionical bonds with higher ability as Ca 2 + – a cross-linker Relations among alkaloids, cadmium and zinc contents in opium poppy (Papaver somniferum L. ...|$|E
40|$|There {{have been}} many {{observations}} made on the action of morphine on the circulatory system during the last half century. In 1864 Bernard (1) noted a fall in carotid blood pressure with morphine. His results were confirmed four years later by Gscheidlen (2) working on rabbits and cats. In 1869 Baxt (3) in some experimental work found that codeine, morphine, and papaverine caused {{an increase in the}} force of the heart beat but that thebaine caused a decrease in both the force and rate. Wit-kowski (4) studied the effect of morphine upon the blood pressure and hearts in dogs and observed a decreased blood pressure fol-lowing its injection which he believed was caused by a central action, i. e., depression of the vasomotor center. He observed the heart to remain normal in rate and force. Six years later Von Schroeder (5) noted that codeine, <b>narcotine</b> and papaverine did not influence the blood pressure in experimental animals (rabbits and dogs) but did slow somewhat the heart rate. He also observed papaverine to decrease the rate and force of the heart beat of frogs and finally to stop the heart in diastole. The effect of morphine upon the hearts of dogs, cats, goats, sheep, horses, mules, oxen and pigs was studied by Guinard (6). With therapeutic doses of morphine he noted an increase of the heart beat but with toxic doses a decrease in the force of cardiac contraction. In goats and in sheep the pulse was first slowed, then an acceleration in rate followed. In horses, mules, pigs and cats the results were not constant. In some the pulse was slowed in others acceleration occurred immediately upon administration of the drug...|$|E
