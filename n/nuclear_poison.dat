500|$|At the Berkeley Radiation Lab, Lawrence offered Segrè {{a job as}} a {{research}} assistant—a relatively lowly position for someone who had discovered an element—for [...] a month for six months. When Lawrence learned that Segrè was legally trapped in California, he reduced Segrè's salary to $116 a month. Working with Glenn Seaborg, Segrè isolated the metastable isotope technetium-99m. Its properties made it ideal for use in nuclear medicine, and it is now used in about 10 million medical diagnostic procedures annually. Segrè went looking for element 93, but did not find it, as he was looking for an element chemically akin to rhenium instead of a rare-earth element, which is what element 93 was. Working with Alexander Langsdorf, Jr., and Chien-Shiung Wu, he discovered xenon-135, which later became important as a <b>nuclear</b> <b>poison</b> in nuclear reactors.|$|E

50|$|Generation II {{reactors}} {{were typically}} designed to achieve about 40 GWd/tU. With newer fuel technology, {{and particularly the}} use of <b>nuclear</b> <b>poisons,</b> these same reactors are now capable of achieving up to 60 GWd/tU. After so many fissions have occurred, the build-up of fission products poisons the chain reaction and the reactor must be shut down and refueled.|$|R
50|$|An early {{researcher}} in nuclear science named Dr. Eric Shanner made some careless mistakes in his nuclear research which ended up exposing Dr. Shanner {{and his family}} to nuclear radiation. While his family died out, Dr. Shanner was rendered ill from the <b>nuclear</b> <b>poisoning.</b> While vowing to teach the world about effects of radiation and <b>nuclear</b> <b>poisoning,</b> he began to do it years later by building a group of androids with Dad resembling a younger version of himself and five others to resemble his family members. Each of the androids was endowed with powers {{that are similar to}} the different stages of the nuclear bombs. Dr. Shanner then sent them to destroy the city of Los Angeles where they managed to destroy the Esperanza Canyon Nuclear Power Plant during its opening day. When the Nuclear Family returned the next day to destroy the nuclear power plant, they ran afoul of the Outsiders and managed to defeat them. After briefly holding Looker captive and sedated, they fought the Outsiders again where they managed to destroy the Nuclear Family while Dr. Shanner expired from his nuclear radiation illness.|$|R

50|$|The iodine pit {{effect has}} to be taken in account for reactor designs. High values of power density, leading to high {{production}} rates of fission products and therefore higher iodine concentrations, require higher amount and enrichment of the nuclear fuel used to compensate. Without this reactivity reserve, a reactor shutdown would preclude its restart for several tens of hours until 135I/135Xe sufficiently decays, especially shortly before replacement of spent fuel (with high burnup and accumulated <b>nuclear</b> <b>poisons)</b> with fresh one.|$|R
5|$|In 1942, Wheeler {{recruited}} Way {{to work on}} the Manhattan Project at the Metallurgical Laboratory in Chicago. Working with physicist Alvin Weinberg, Way analyzed {{neutron flux}} data from Enrico Fermi's early nuclear reactor designs to see whether {{it would be possible to}} create a self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction. These calculations were put to use in the construction of Chicago Pile-1. Afterwards, she examined the problem of <b>nuclear</b> <b>poisoning</b> of reactors by certain fission products. With physicist Eugene Wigner she developed the Way-Wigner approximation for fission product decay.|$|R
50|$|The iodine pit, {{also called}} the iodine hole or xenon pit, is a {{temporary}} disabling of a nuclear reactor due to buildup of short-lived <b>nuclear</b> <b>poisons</b> in the reactor core. The main isotope responsible is 135Xe, mainly produced by natural decay of 135I. 135I is a weak neutron absorber, while 135Xe {{is the most powerful}} known neutron absorber. When 135Xe builds up in the fuel rods of a reactor, it significantly lowers their reactivity, by absorbing a significant amount of the neutrons which provide the nuclear reaction.|$|R
5000|$|... 149Sm is an {{observed}} {{stable isotope}} of samarium (predicted to decay, but no decays {{have ever been}} observed, giving it a half-life several orders of magnitude longer than {{the age of the}} universe), and a fission product (yield 1.0888%), which is also a neutron-absorbing <b>nuclear</b> <b>poison</b> with significant effect on nuclear reactor operation, second only to 135Xe. Its neutron cross section is 40140 barns for thermal neutrons.|$|E
50|$|Xenon-135 (135Xe) is an {{unstable}} isotope of xenon with a half-life of about 9.2 hours. 135Xe is a fission product of uranium {{and it is}} the most powerful known neutron-absorbing <b>nuclear</b> <b>poison</b> (2 million barns; up to 3 million barns under reactor conditions.), with a significant effect on nuclear reactor operation. The ultimate yield of xenon-135 from fission is 6.3%, though most of this is from fission-produced tellurium-135 and iodine-135.|$|E
50|$|Xenon-135 is a {{radioactive}} isotope of xenon, produced as a fission product of uranium. It has a half-life of about 9.2 hours {{and is the}} most powerful known neutron-absorbing <b>nuclear</b> <b>poison</b> (having a neutron absorption cross-section of 2 million barns). The overall yield of xenon-135 from fission is 6.3%, though most of this results from the radioactive decay of fission-produced tellurium-135 and iodine-135. Xe-135 exerts a significant effect on nuclear reactor operation (xenon pit).|$|E
50|$|Failing to {{anticipate}} and manage xenon poisoning and {{compensate for the}} subsequent burn-off properly was a contributing factor to the Chernobyl disaster; during a run-down to a lower power, a combination of operator error and xenon <b>nuclear</b> <b>poisoning</b> caused the reactor thermal power to fall to near-shutdown levels. The crew's resulting efforts to restore power, including the manual withdrawal of control rods not under the SKALA computer's automated control, placed the reactor in a highly unsafe configuration. A failed SCRAM procedure, resulting in the control rods being jammed {{at a level that}} actually increased reactivity, caused a thermal transient and a steam explosion that tore the reactor apart.|$|R
50|$|During the 1950s {{this mode}} of combat was {{increasingly}} questioned. Unloading the infantry onto a battlefield that {{was assumed to be}} littered with chemical and <b>nuclear</b> <b>poisons</b> did not seem like a good idea. Further, while the APCs moved to and from combat the infantry section in the back had nothing to do, a claustrophobic environment where the men could not add to the fight. Military theorists turned to the concept of the infantry fighting vehicle (IFV), similar to the APC but with the expectation that the infantry section would be able to stay in the vehicle fight effectively, while also improving the vehicles own armament. The Soviets were the second to adapt to this new style of combat, issuing requirements and then introducing the BMP in the late 1960s, followed soon after by the German Marder.|$|R
5|$|Even {{before the}} Hanford Site {{started up the}} B Reactor, {{the first of its}} three reactors, on September 15, 1944, Wheeler had been {{concerned}} that some nuclear fission products {{might turn out to be}} <b>nuclear</b> <b>poisons,</b> the accumulation of which would impede the ongoing nuclear chain reaction by absorbing many of the thermal neutrons that were needed to continue a chain reaction. In an April 1942 report, he predicted that this would reduce the reactivity by less than one percent so long as no fission product had a neutron capture cross section of more than 100,000 barns. After the reactor unexpectedly shut down, and then just as unexpectedly restarted about fifteen hours later, he suspected iodine-135, with a half life of 6.6 hours, and its daughter product, xenon-135, which has a half life of 9.2 hours. Xenon-135 turned out to have a neutron capture cross-section of well over 2 million barns. The problem was corrected by adding additional fuel rods to burn out the poison.|$|R
50|$|A neutron poison (also {{called a}} neutron {{absorber}} or a <b>nuclear</b> <b>poison)</b> is a substance {{with a large}} neutron absorption cross-section, in applications such as nuclear reactors. In such applications, absorbing neutrons is normally an undesirable effect. However neutron-absorbing materials, also called poisons, are intentionally inserted into some types of reactors in order to lower the high reactivity of their initial fresh fuel load. Some of these poisons deplete as they absorb neutrons during reactor operation, while others remain relatively constant.|$|E
5000|$|Iodine-135 is an isotope {{of iodine}} with a {{half-life}} of 6.6 hours. It {{is an important}} isotope {{from the viewpoint of}} nuclear reactor physics. It is produced in relatively large amounts as a fission product, and decays to xenon-135, which is a <b>nuclear</b> <b>poison</b> with a very large thermal neutron cross section, which is a cause of multiple complications in the control of nuclear reactors. The process of buildup of xenon-135 from an accumulated iodine-135 can temporarily preclude a shut-down reactor from restarting. This is known as xenon-poisoning or [...] "falling into an iodine pit".|$|E

500|$|Construction on B Reactor {{began in}} August 1943 and was {{completed}} on September 13, 1944. The reactor went critical in late September and, after overcoming <b>nuclear</b> <b>poisoning,</b> produced its first plutonium on November 6, 1944. Plutonium {{was produced in}} the Hanford reactors when a uranium-238 atom in a fuel slug absorbed a neutron to form uranium-239. U-239 rapidly undergoes beta decay to form neptunium-239, which rapidly undergoes a second beta decay to form plutonium-239. The irradiated fuel slugs were transported by rail to three huge remotely operated chemical separation plants called [...] "canyons" [...] that were about [...] away. A series of chemical processing steps separated {{the small amount of}} plutonium that was produced from the remaining uranium and the fission waste products. This first batch of plutonium was refined in the 221-T plant from December 26, 1944, to February 2, 1945, and delivered to the Los Alamos laboratory in New Mexico on February 5, 1945.|$|R

50|$|If {{sufficient}} reactivity {{control authority}} is available, the reactor can be restarted, but a xenon burn-out transient {{must be carefully}} managed.

50|$|Because 135Xe is {{a potent}} <b>nuclear</b> <b>poison</b> with a large cross section for neutron absorption, the buildup of 135Xe in the fuel inside a power reactor can lower the {{reactivity}} greatly. If a power reactor is shut down or left running at a low power level, then large amounts of 135Xe can build up through decay of 135I. When the reactor is restarted or the low power level is increased significantly, 135Xe will be quickly consumed through neutron capture reactions and the reactivity of the core will increase. Under some circumstances, control systems {{may not be able}} to respond quickly enough to manage an abrupt reactivity increase as the built-up 135Xe burns off.
