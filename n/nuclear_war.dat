For these reasons British officials sought a speedy end to the conflict, hoping to unite Korea under United Nations auspices and withdrawal of all foreign forces.|$|E

5|$|On October 6, 1973, an Arab {{coalition}} led by Egypt and Syria, supported {{with arms}} and materiel by the Soviet Union, attacked Israel in the Yom Kippur War. Israel suffered heavy losses and Nixon ordered an airlift to resupply Israeli losses, cutting through inter-departmental squabbles and bureaucracy and taking {{personal responsibility for}} any response by Arab nations. More than a week later, {{by the time the}} U.S. and Soviet Union began negotiating a truce, Israel had penetrated deep into enemy territory. The truce negotiations rapidly escalated into a superpower crisis; when Israel gained the upper hand, Egyptian President Sadat requested a joint U.S.-USSR peacekeeping mission, which the U.S. refused. When Soviet Premier Brezhnev threatened to unilaterally enforce any peacekeeping mission militarily, Nixon ordered the U.S. military to DEFCON3, placing all U.S. military personnel and bases on alert for <b>nuclear</b> <b>war.</b> This was the closest that the world had come to <b>nuclear</b> <b>war</b> since the Cuban Missile Crisis. Brezhnev backed down as a result of Nixon's actions.|$|E

His criticism attracted more press as the war became a stalemate. It also became highly publicized through discourse among the anti-war movement.|$|E
5|$|A {{communications}} variant designated Tu-142MR ("Bear J") was {{the last}} production version of the Tu-142. It was tasked with long-range communications duties with Soviet ballistic missile submarines, a role {{similar to that of}} the Boeing E-6 Mercury. The Tu-142MR differed from the ASW Tu-142s in having less-sophisticated avionics, but had a long trailing wire radio aerial to relay messages to submerged Soviet submarines in times of <b>nuclear</b> <b>war.</b> This was amongst the many distinctive features of the Tu-142MR that allows it to communicate with satellites, airborne and ground-based command posts, and submarines. The aircraft replaced the Ilyushin Il-80 in the airborne command and control role. Tu-142s are currently operated by the 76th Naval Aviation Regiment from Kipelovo. Other developments of the Tu-142 include the one-off Tu-142MRT maritime reconnaissance variant, and the unbuilt Tu-142MS missile-carrying variant.|$|E
5|$|After {{the mint}} closed, it {{performed}} {{a variety of}} functions for the Federal government.

Then, in 1932, the assay office closed and the building was converted into a Federal prison, in which capacity it served until 1943. The Coast Guard then took over the building as a nominal storage facility, though in truth the structure was largely abandoned and left to decay until it was transferred to the state of Louisiana in 1965. During the Cold War, when many believed there to be a high risk of <b>nuclear</b> <b>war,</b> the old Mint was considered to be the best fallout shelter in the city.|$|E
