5|$|Auckland's {{population}} growth, {{as evidenced}} in the 2001 census, {{led to the}} formation for the 2002 general election of a new electorate called Helensville, which covered the north-western corner of the Auckland urban area. Key beat long-serving National MP Brian Neeson (whose own Waitakere seat had moved on paper to being a Labour seat through the boundary changes) for the National Party Helensville selection. At the 2002 election Key won the seat with a majority of 1,705, ahead of Labour's Gary Russell, with Neeson, <b>now</b> <b>standing</b> as an independent, coming third. Key won re-election with ease at the 2005 election garnering 63% of votes cast in Helensville, and increased his majority again in 2008, gaining 73% of the electorate vote.|$|E
5|$|Charing Cross, at the {{junction}} of Strand and Whitehall, {{was the site of}} the first public monument in what is now the City of Westminster, the cross commissioned by Edward I late in the 13th century in memory of his queen, Eleanor of Castile. Destroyed by order of the Long Parliament in 1647, the Eleanor cross was replaced after the Restoration by the equestrian statue of Charles I by Hubert Le Sueur, the oldest public sculpture <b>now</b> <b>standing</b> in the borough. In 1865 a facsimile of the cross was erected in the forecourt of Charing Cross railway station. Charing Cross was declared the official centre of London in 1831 and a plaque marking this status was installed near Le Sueur's statue in 1955.|$|E
5|$|From 1–14 February 1945, Hartmann briefly led I. Gruppe of Jagdgeschwader 53 {{as acting}} Gruppenkommandeur {{until he was}} {{replaced}} by Helmut Lipfert. In March 1945, Hartmann, his score <b>now</b> <b>standing</b> at 336 aerial victories, was asked a second time by General Adolf Galland to join the Me262 units forming to fly the new jet fighter. Hartmann attended the jet conversion program led by Heinrich Bär. Galland also intended Hartmann to fly with Jagdverband 44. Hartmann declined the offer, preferring to remain with JG52. Some sources report that Hartmann's decision to stay with his unit was due to a request via telegram made by Oberstleutnant Hermann Graf. Now Gruppenkommandeur of I./JG52, Erich Hartmann claimed his 350th aerial victory on 17 April, {{in the vicinity of}} Chrudim. The last wartime photograph of Hartmann known was taken in connection with this victory.|$|E

After several minutes of teasing, Beyoncé approaches the detective, {{who is now}} smiling, and knocks a stack of papers off of his desk so she can rub against him. She then pulls open the blinds to let light in. At the same time, several other women are seen {{to be present in}} the room. They were apparently there all along, hidden in the darkness. Together, they give a choreographed teaser dance in front of their own respective antique fans while their hair is blowing. The women move about to continue the dance elsewhere in the room, executing some hip-shaking moves. They later perform a chair-dancing routine with Beyoncé, and whip their hair back and forth. The video ends with a fade to black as Beyoncé approaches the man at his desk.|$|E
5|$|With the {{increasing}} Soviet resistance, a plan {{was made to}} concentrate on only one target. It was decided to halt the Ukhta-offensive and instead support the advance east of Kestenga in mid-August. This new drive {{was able to make}} some ground in the arctic no-man's land, but no decisive breakthrough could be achieved. The increasing Soviet activity also worried Siilasvuo, especially as Group F was <b>now</b> <b>standing</b> still in exposed terrain, open to a possible Soviet encirclement. To counter this, AOK Norwegen decided to bolster the Finnish forces for a final push to the east {{and the rest of the}} SS Nord division was moved south and put under Finnish command. Also parts of 6th Finnish Division were now moved south and returned to the Finnish III Corps for more reinforcements. Once the reorganisation had been completed, a new, final attack had to be launched by both Finnish battlegroups in October.|$|E

25|$|On 11 September 1913, however, Ward finally {{accepted}} {{the leadership of}} the Liberal Party once again. Ward extracted a number of important concessions from the party, insisting on a very high level of personal control – he felt that the party's previous lack of direction was the primary cause for its failure. He also worked to build alliances with the growing labour movement, which was <b>now</b> <b>standing</b> candidates in many seats.|$|E
25|$|The 1928 Members' stand, the 1956 Olympic {{stand and}} the 1968 Ponsford stand were {{demolished}} {{one by one}} between late 2003 to 2005 and replaced with a new structure {{in time for the}} 2006 Commonwealth Games. Despite <b>now</b> <b>standing</b> as a single unbroken stand, the individual sections retain the names of Ponsford, Olympic and Members Stands. The redevelopment cost exceeded 400million and pushed the ground's capacity to just above 100,000. Since redevelopment, the highest attendance was the 2017 Grand Final of the AFL with 100,021, followed by 100,016 in the 2010 Grand Final.|$|E

He was particularly supportive of moves to create a national health service; he cautioned that the administration must be kept efficient. At the 1945 general election, Linstead faced a five-cornered fight against not only Labour and Liberal candidates but also Sir Richard Acland, the leader of Common Wealth and Mrs. E. Tennant, a former Conservative candidate <b>now</b> <b>standing</b> as an Independent. Linstead won a majority of 3,887.|$|E
25|$|The year 1840 {{also brought}} a {{political}} crisis between France, Russia and England because of France's support for Muhammad Ali, {{the ruler of}} Egypt, Ali was a long-time ally of France; in 1829 he had given the Luxor obelisk, <b>now</b> <b>standing</b> in the Place de la Concorde, to France. Lord Palmerston {{was convinced that the}} French would not fight, and sent a fleet to bombard Beirut and threaten Egypt. The French cabinet was divided, fearing that France was not ready for war; the French army was already engaged in an expensive military conquest of Algeria. The King made it clear to Thiers that he wanted peace. Thiers offered to resign, but the King refused his resignation, arguing that he wanted the British to believe that France would fight. When Thiers drafted a note to Britain warning that a British ultimatum to Egypt would upset the global balance of power, and he ordered construction of a new ring of fortresses around Paris. Palmerston did not attack Egypt, and crisis ended. The fortifications begun by Thiers during crisis were eventually finished, and became known as the Thiers wall, which later became (and remain today) the city limits of Paris.|$|E

In order to better {{distinguish}} this base-2 exponent from a base-10 exponent, a base-2 exponent is sometimes also indicated by using the letter B instead of E, a shorthand notation originally proposed by Bruce Alan Martin of Brookhaven National Laboratory in 1968, as in 1.001bB11b (or shorter: 1.001B11). For comparison, the same number in decimal representation: 1.125×23 (using decimal representation), or 1.125B3 (still using decimal representation). Some calculators use a mixed representation for binary floating point numbers, where the exponent is displayed as decimal number even in binary mode, so the above becomes 1.001b×10b3d or shorter 1.001B3.|$|E
2500|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th century, {{criticism}} of natural selection had reached the point that in 1903 the German botanist, , wrote that [...] "We are <b>now</b> <b>standing</b> at the death bed of Darwinism", and in 1907 the Stanford University entomologist Vernon Lyman Kellogg, who supported natural selection, asserted that [...] "... the fair truth is that the Darwinian selection theory, considered with regard to its claimed capacity to be an independently sufficient mechanical explanation of descent, stands today seriously discredited in the biological world." [...] He added, however, that there were problems preventing the widespread acceptance of any of the alternatives, as large mutations seemed too uncommon, and there was no experimental evidence of mechanisms that could support either Lamarckism or orthogenesis. Ernst Mayr wrote that a survey of evolutionary literature and biology textbooks showed that as late as 1930 the belief that natural selection was {{the most important factor in}} evolution was a minority viewpoint, with only a few population geneticists being strict selectionists.|$|E
