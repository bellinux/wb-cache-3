Though two turned her down, one agent, Jean Naggar, encouraged Koen to continue finishing the book, believing {{it to be}} [...] "the launching of a major author." [...] Naggar mailed the manuscript to five major publishing companies, with Random House purchasing it for a [...] "whopping" [...] $350,000 in August 1985, which {{was at the time}} a record for a new novelist. Random House's publisher, Howard Kaminsky, wanted to publish [...] "Oprah Winfrey-type books" [...] in the [...] "how-to-be-the-best-you-can-be" [...] genre. He reasoned, [...] "I'm sure that's up there with the highest prices ever paid for the hardcover rights alone to a first novel.

[...] Leslie enjoys herself at the party and, when the beer runs out and the party is about to end, she keeps it going by {{retrieving}} the wine and cheese from the gift basket. [...] The next morning, she feels guilty and, despite her boss Ron's (Nick Offerman) assurance that [...] "t's <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>big</b> a deal," [...] Leslie issues a public apology to every government official in Pawnee, including {{a link to the}} new pit website. [...] Later, however, she learns April has placed a drunken video of herself drinking the rest of the wine on the site, even though she is only 19. [...] Ron tells Leslie an ethics board has called for a disciplinary hearing with Leslie. [...] Leslie apologizes to the board and defends April, accepting responsibility for the video. [...] As the questions from the board continue, Ron angrily defends Leslie, insisting, [...] "Leslie has never broken a rule in her life, to the point that it's annoying." [...] He abruptly ends the meeting and insists they will have to go through him to give Leslie anything more than a slap on the wrist.|$|E
500|$|Nick is {{described}} by the soap opera's official website as often thinking [...] "with his heart instead of his head". When the teenaged version of Nick debuted on the series in 1994, he was characterized as a [...] "frisky" [...] 16-year-old [...] "rich-kid", with Morrow being able to [...] "kick back and relax in typical teenager attire—jeans, tees, etc". Morrow said [...] "Nick's eager and fun-loving ... and that's fun to play". Nick also has an [...] "eye for the ladies". In 1999, Morrow told soap magazine Soap Opera Digest that Nick has a [...] "fiery personality", and [...] "if you attack him, he's going to fight back". Morrow has insisted {{that he is not}} concerned about viewer backlash towards Nick, having stated: [...] "My job is not to be palatable to the audience. I want to tell a convincing story. I have never been a man in love with two women. I can only imagine what that must be like." [...] The actor felt that if he needed to [...] "look like an ass and a bad guy" [...] to keep people interested in his portrayal, [...] "so be it". He told Tommy Garrett of Canyon News: [...] "I’d rather be playing an imperfect good guy than a boring one. There is a lot of me in Nick, there is <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>big</b> of a stretch for me on a daily basis". A controversial storyline occurred in 2011 when alongside his sisters Abby Newman (Marcy Rylan) and Victoria Abbott (Amelia Heinle), Nick sued his father. Morrow felt that Nick wants to teach Victor a lesson, hoping he will [...] "appreciate his children more". He also stated Nick wants to get respect, as he isn't [...] "this young and impressionable boy who looks at his father in this hero light anymore." [...] By the following year, Morrow opined that Nick is now [...] "more mature" [...] with his decision-making, and that [...] "He's got a very practical view of the world, and I like that he's kind of become a steady character on the show". He stated that although the part isn't as [...] "splashy or flashy" [...] as Adam Newman (Michael Muhney), Nick's onscreen brother, he [...] "really" [...] likes Nick because [...] "he's a good dude" [...] and a [...] "very supportive" [...] person.|$|E

2500|$|The Allmusic {{review by}} Scott Yanow awarded the album three stars and states: [...] "The music on this CD reissue {{is better than}} it should be. Cannonball Adderley had a fluke hit with [...] "African Waltz" [...] so a full album was {{recorded}} {{with the hope of}} coming up with additional hits... There is some strong material on the set (including [...] "West Coast Blues," [...] "Stockholm Sweetnin'" [...] and a remake of [...] "This Here") but the results are not too substantial and this was <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>big</b> a seller; it is still a reasonably enjoyable effort". The Penguin Guide to Jazz awarded the album three stars stating [...] "'A departure from and an extension of what the Adderleys were doing in their small groups. Ernie Wilkins arranges a set of full-bodied top-heavy charts which Adderley has to jostle with to create their own space, and the music's worth hearing for its Sheer Brashness and impact".|$|E
