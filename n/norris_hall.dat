5|$|At age 76, Librescu {{was among}} the 32 people who were murdered in the Virginia Tech shooting. On April 16, 2007, Seung-Hui Cho entered the <b>Norris</b> <b>Hall</b> Engineering Building and opened fire on classrooms. Librescu, who taught a solid {{mechanics}} class in Room 204 in the <b>Norris</b> <b>Hall</b> during April 2007, held {{the door of his}} classroom shut while the gunman attempted to enter it. Although he was shot through the door, Librescu managed to prevent the gunman from entering the classroom until most of his students had escaped through the windows. He was struck by five bullets, with a shot to the head proving to be fatal. Of the 23 registered students in his class, only one, Minal Panchal, died.|$|E
5|$|Within {{the next}} {{two and a half}} hours, Cho {{returned}} to his room to rearm himself; he mailed a package to NBC News that contained pictures, digital video files and documents. At approximately 9:45a.m. EDT (13:45 UTC), he then crossed the campus to <b>Norris</b> <b>Hall,</b> a classroom building on the campus where, in a span of nine minutes, Cho shot dozens of people, killing 30 of them. As police breached the area of the building where Cho attacked the faculty and students, Cho committed suicide in Norris 211 with a gunshot to his temple. Cho's gunshot wound destroyed his face, obscuring identification of his body for several hours. The police identified Cho by matching the fingerprints on the guns used in the shootings with immigration records. Before the shootings, Cho's only known connection to <b>Norris</b> <b>Hall</b> was as a student in the sociology class, which met in a classroom {{on the second floor of}} the building. Although police had not stated positively at the time of the initial investigation that Cho was the perpetrator of the <b>Norris</b> <b>Hall</b> shootings and the earlier one at West Ambler Johnston Hall, forensic evidence confirmed that the same gun was used in both shooting incidents.|$|E
5|$|Through {{ballistics}} examination, {{law enforcement}} investigators determined that Cho used the Glock 19 pistol during the attacks at the West Ambler Johnston dormitory and at <b>Norris</b> <b>Hall</b> on the Virginia Tech campus. Police investigators found that Cho fired more than 170 shots during the killing spree, evidenced by technicians finding at least 17 empty magazines at the scene. During the investigation, {{federal law enforcement}} investigators found that the serial numbers were illegally filed off on both the Walther P22 and the Glock 19 handguns used by Cho during the rampage.|$|E
50|$|At age 53, Loganathan {{was among}} the 32 people killed by Seung-Hui Cho in the Virginia Tech shootings on April 16, 2007. Loganathan taught an Advanced Hydrology class in <b>Norris</b> <b>Hall's</b> Room 206. On April 16, 2007, Cho entered Norris 206 and opened fire; Loganathan was Cho's first target. Of the fifteen {{registered}} students in Loganathan's class, nine were killed and two more were injured.|$|R
25|$|Bittaker and <b>Norris</b> drove <b>Hall</b> to a {{location}} in the San Gabriel Mountains beyond where they had taken Lucinda Schaefer. At this location, she was raped twice by Bittaker and once by Norris. On the second occasion in which Bittaker raped <b>Hall,</b> <b>Norris</b> saw what he believed to be vehicle headlights approaching. Upon informing Bittaker, he (Bittaker) clasped his hand over Hall's mouth and dragged her into nearby bushes as Norris drove in an unsuccessful search of the vehicle he had seen. When {{he returned to the}} van, the pair drove to {{a location}} deeper in the San Gabriel Mountains, where Bittaker forced Hall to walk, naked, up a hill alongside the road, then perform fellatio upon him. Bittaker then ordered Andrea Hall to pose for several Polaroid pictures.|$|R

Among other roles, he spoke at the April 10 ceremony.|$|E
25|$|<b>Norris</b> <b>Hall</b> {{was also}} the {{location}} of the second shooting attack during the Virginia Tech shootings on April 16, 2007. The building was the site of 31 of the 33 fatalities (including the gunman), and all 17 wounded faculty and students. The building was closed {{for the rest of the}} 2007 spring semester, and reopened with access limited to faculty and students with legitimate business inside at remaining offices and laboratories on June 18, 2007. On December 20, 2007, it was announced that the second floor of Norris would be renovated and become home to the Center for Peace Studies and Violence Prevention.|$|E
25|$|<b>Norris</b> <b>Hall</b> is a four story (1 {{floor below}} grade) Hokie Stone {{academic}} building located between Burruss and Holden Halls.

25|$|Northwestern {{was also}} home to several {{literary}} societies predating fraternal societies. The Adelphic, Hinman, and Ossoi societies published periodicals of essays, poems, and news items. These early periodicals were named The Evanstonian, The Academian, Tripod (1871–1880), and Vidette. In 1881, the Northwestern was published biweekly and ultimately evolved into the modern The Daily Northwestern newspaper. The Northwestern University Press Company published the Northwestern out of the Gymnasium building until the Press moved off-campus in 1888. By 1900, the student newspapers were published out of the basement of Old College, before they were moved to the attic of Memorial Hall in the 1920s. After World War II, {{the offices of the}} student newspaper moved frequently until <b>Norris</b> <b>Hall</b> was completed in 1972.|$|E
2500|$|The {{specialty}} news {{channels in}} the U.S. — CNN, MSNBC, and Fox News Channel — had started {{covering the story}} much earlier, mentioning the first gunshot attacks on the West Ambler-Johnston residence hall before starting much more extensive coverage when news of the shootings at <b>Norris</b> <b>Hall</b> broke. [...] CNN first reported the AJ shooting about 10:10a.m. ET. The channels dropped all commercial breaks until about 7 p.m. Eastern time, then aired limited commercials after that through the night.|$|E
2500|$|Jamal Albarghouti (البرغوثي), a {{graduate}} student at Virginia Tech, on April 16, 2007, recorded video of the exterior of <b>Norris</b> <b>Hall</b> during the classroom shootings. [...] Albarghouti captured the footage using the video function on his cell phone while ducking for safety outside the building where the shooting occurred. The video displays police officers reacting to the sound of gunshots, which could be heard coming from the interior of the campus building. [...] His video footage was televised frequently {{during the course of the}} event, and additionally logged over 1.8 million hits the day of the incident on CNN's I-Report, a feature that allows viewers to send video footage as well as photos from their cellphone or personal cameras. Albarghouti's video was some of the most memorable media coverage of the event, notably for its audio capture of the shooter's methodic gunfire.|$|E

5|$|Royal Arsenal renamed {{themselves}} {{for a second time}} upon becoming a limited liability company in 1893. They registered their new name, Woolwich Arsenal, with The Football League when the club ascended later that year. Woolwich Arsenal was the first southern member of The Football League, starting out in the Second Division and winning promotion to the First Division in 1904. Falling attendances, due to financial difficulties among the munitions workers and the arrival of more accessible football clubs elsewhere in the city, led the club close to bankruptcy by 1910. Businessmen Henry <b>Norris</b> and William <b>Hall</b> became involved in the club, and sought to move them elsewhere.|$|R
2500|$|The {{local news}} {{networks}} in the Middle Atlantic region had extensive coverage, as many residents of the area had ties to Virginia Tech, until the evening news programs took over at 6:30pm.

25|$|The Hawks {{made the}} Cup Finals twice {{more in the}} 1960s, losing to the Leafs in 1962 and the Canadiens in 1965. They {{remained}} {{a force to be}} reckoned with throughout the decade, with Hull enjoying four 50-goal seasons, Mikita winning back-to-back scoring titles and MVP accolades, Pilote winning three consecutive <b>Norris</b> Trophies, and <b>Hall</b> being named the First or Second All-Star goaltender eight out of nine seasons. Hull and Mikita especially were widely regarded as the most feared one-two punch in the league. However, despite a strong supporting cast which included Bill Hay, Ken Wharram, Phil Esposito, Moose Vasko, Doug Mohns and Pat Stapleton, the Hawks never quite put it all together.|$|R
2500|$|Bittaker and <b>Norris</b> {{then drove}} <b>Hall</b> {{to a third}} location, where Bittaker again walked Hall up a nearby hill, this time as Norris drove to a nearby store to {{purchase}} alcohol. When Norris returned, Bittaker was alone and in possession of two further Polaroid pictures he had taken of Hall; both of which depicted Hall's face in expressions Norris later described as being of [...] "sheer terror" [...] as she begged for her life to be spared. Bittaker told Norris that he had informed Hall he intended to kill her and challenged her to give him as many reasons as she could why she {{should be allowed to}} live, before thrusting an ice pick through her ear into her brain. He then turned her body over and thrust the ice pick into her other ear, stamping upon it until the handle broke. Noting that Andrea Hall was still alive and conscious, Bittaker then manually strangled her to death before throwing her body over a cliff.|$|R

5|$|When Arsenal {{was founded}} in 1886 by munition workers' from Woolwich, the club {{resisted}} the lure of professionalism and remained an amateur side. Success in local cup competitions soon followed, and a tie against Derby County in the FA Cup on 17 January 1891 led to the opposition approaching two of Arsenal's players, in view of offering them professional contracts. Later that year the club resigned its membership of the Kent County and London Football Associationsboth amateur governing bodiesand voted to turn professional, a move which attracted criticism from many southern clubs. In 1893, the club received an invitation to join the Football League, which the board accepted. Arsenal played in the Second Division for eleven seasons, while also participating in regional competitions, the Southern Combination and United League. The club won promotion in 1904, and enjoyed strong FA Cup campaigns in the mid-1900s, but the increase of football clubs in the capital and falling attendances at the Manor Ground pushed Arsenal close to bankruptcy by 1910. Sir Henry <b>Norris</b> and William <b>Hall</b> in that year took over Arsenal, and planned to relocate the team to Highbury {{in order to improve}} their financial standing. Arsenal were relegated back to the Second Division in 1913, but the move to North London brought about larger attendances than ever before.|$|R
2500|$|In {{reference}} to the actual murders, Norris stated that after he unsuccessfully attempted to strangle Lucinda Schaefer, Bittaker had strangled her with a wire coat hanger.

In {{reference to}} the murder of Andrea <b>Hall,</b> <b>Norris</b> stated he had been told by Bittaker to drive to a nearby store to purchase alcohol when Hall was murdered, after which he returned to find Bittaker, smiling and holding Polaroid pictures he had taken of Hall after informing her he intended to kill her. With reference to victims Jacqueline Lamp and Jackie Gilliam, Norris stated that the two girls were held captive for [...] "over a day" [...] before being murdered, adding that Bittaker had killed Gilliam before he himself bludgeoned Lamp about the head as Bittaker strangled her. When discussing the abuse and torture of Shirley Lynette Ledford, Norris stated he had, upon the insistence of Bittaker, committed the actual murder of Ledford, adding Bittaker had informed him that [...] "I should kill her, because I hadn't killed anyone yet. I knew this was coming, so I agreed." [...] Norris then confessed to having killed Ledford by strangling her with a coat hanger, which he had tightened with pliers in much the same manner Bittaker had with previous victims Lucinda Schaefer and Jacqueline Lamp. Norris then stated the pair had driven to Sunland, where he discarded Shirley Ledford's body upon the front lawn as Bittaker waited in his van.|$|R
