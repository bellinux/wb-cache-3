5|$|Atoms of {{the same}} element have {{the same number of}} protons, called the atomic number. Within a single element, the number of {{neutrons}} may vary, determining the isotope of that element. The total number of protons and neutrons determine the <b>nuclide.</b> The number of neutrons relative to the protons determines the stability of the nucleus, with certain isotopes undergoing radioactive decay.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the great}} rarity of odd–odd nuclei, almost all the {{primordial}} isotopes of the alkali metals are odd–even (the exceptions being the light stable isotope lithium-6 and the long-lived radioisotope potassium-40). For a given odd mass number, there can be only a single beta-stable <b>nuclide,</b> since {{there is not a}} difference in binding energy between even–odd and odd–even comparable to that between even–even and odd–odd, leaving other nuclides of the same mass number (isobars) free to beta decay toward the lowest-mass <b>nuclide.</b> An effect of the instability of an odd number of either type of nucleons is that odd-numbered elements, such as the alkali metals, tend to have fewer stable isotopes than even-numbered elements. Of the 26 monoisotopic elements that have only a single stable isotope, all but one have an odd atomic number and all but one also have an even number of neutrons. Beryllium is the single exception to both rules, due to its low atomic number.|$|E

The <b>nuclide</b> 54Fe theoretically can undergo double electron capture to 54Cr, but the process has never been observed and only a lower limit on the half-life of 3.1×1022 years has been established.|$|E

5|$|Nineteen nuclides {{and three}} nuclear isomers {{are known for}} {{einsteinium}} with atomic weights ranging from 240 to 258. All are radioactive and the most stable <b>nuclide,</b> 252Es, has a half-life of 471.7 days. Next most stable isotopes are 254Es (half-life 275.7 days), 255Es (39.8 days) and 253Es (20.47 days). All of the remaining isotopes have half-lives shorter than 40 hours, {{and most of them}} decay within less than 30 minutes. Of the three nuclear isomers, the most stable is 254mEs with half-life of 39.3 hours.|$|E
5|$|There is {{currently}} {{no use for}} any isotope of berkelium outside basic scientific research. Berkelium-249 is a common target <b>nuclide</b> to prepare still heavier transuranic elements and transactinides, such as lawrencium, rutherfordium and bohrium. It is also useful {{as a source of}} the isotope californium-249, which is used for studies on the chemistry of californium in preference to the more radioactive californium-252 that is produced in neutron bombardment facilities such as the HFIR.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{widespread}} application of technetium-99m in nuclear medicine, the radioactive isotope thallium-201, with a half-life of 73 hours, {{was the main}} substance for nuclear cardiography. The <b>nuclide</b> is still used for stress tests for risk stratification in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). This isotope of thallium can be generated using a transportable generator {{which is similar to}} the technetium-99m generator. The generator contains lead-201 (half-life 9.33 hours) which decays by electron capture to the thallium-201. The lead-201 can be produced in a cyclotron by the bombardment of thallium with protons or deuterons by the (p,3n) and (d,4n) reactions.|$|E

The odd-A stable <b>nuclides</b> are divided (roughly evenly) into odd-proton-even-neutron, and even-proton-odd-neutron <b>nuclides.</b> Odd-proton-odd-neutron <b>nuclides</b> (and nuclei) {{are the least}} common.|$|R
50|$|<b>Nuclides</b> {{that are}} {{produced}} by radioactive decay are called radiogenic <b>nuclides,</b> whether they themselves are stable or not. There exist stable radiogenic <b>nuclides</b> that were formed from short-lived extinct radionuclides in the early solar system.

5|$|Newly formed astatine-211 is {{the subject}} of ongoing {{research}} in nuclear medicine. It must be used quickly as it decays with a half-life of 7.2hours; this is long enough to permit multistep labeling strategies. Astatine-211 has potential for targeted alpha particle radiotherapy, since it decays either via emission of an alpha particle (to bismuth-207), or via electron capture (to an extremely short-lived <b>nuclide,</b> polonium-211, which undergoes further alpha decay). Polonium X-rays emitted {{as a result of the}} electron capture branch, in the range of 77–92keV, enable the tracking of astatine in animals and patients. Although astatine-210 has a slightly longer half-life, it is wholly unsuitable because it usually undergoes beta plus decay to the extremely toxic polonium-210.|$|E
5|$|Nitrogen has two stable isotopes: 14N and 15N. The {{first is}} much more common, making up 99.634% of natural nitrogen, and the second (which is {{slightly}} heavier) makes up the remaining 0.366%. This leads to an atomic weight of around 14.007u. Both of these stable isotopes are produced in the CNO cycle in stars, but 14N is more common as its neutron capture is the rate-limiting step. 14N {{is one of the}} five stable odd–odd nuclides (a <b>nuclide</b> having an odd number of protons and neutrons); the other four are 2H, 6Li, 10B, and 180mTa.|$|E
5|$|Noddack was proven {{right after}} all. Fermi had {{dismissed}} {{the possibility of}} fission {{on the basis of}} his calculations, but he had not taken into account the binding energy that would appear when a <b>nuclide</b> with an odd number of neutrons absorbed an extra neutron. For Fermi, the news came as a profound embarrassment, as the transuranic elements that he had partly been awarded the Nobel Prize for discovering had not been transuranic elements at all, but fission products. He added a footnote to this effect to his Nobel Prize acceptance speech.|$|E
40|$|The high-energy {{particles}} in the galactic cosmic rays, (GCR) can produce <b>nuclides</b> deep in any object exposed to them. These cosmic-ray-produced (cosmogenic) <b>nuclides</b> have been extensively studied during the last four decades, mainly in meteorites and lunar samples (e. g., 1, 2).

5|$|One {{short-lived}} gamma ray-emitting {{nuclear isomer}} of technetium—technetium-99m—is used in nuclear medicine {{for a wide}} variety of diagnostic tests. The ground state of this <b>nuclide,</b> technetium-99, is used as a gamma-ray-free source of beta particles. Long-lived technetium isotopes produced commercially are by-products of the fission of uranium-235 in nuclear reactors and are extracted from nuclear fuel rods. Because no isotope of technetium has a half-life longer than 4.2million years (technetium-98), the 1952 detection of technetium in red giants, which are billions of years old, helped to prove that stars can produce heavier elements.|$|E
5|$|The chief {{questions}} raised by Kulakov were that the claimed alpha decay energy of sergenium was many orders of magnitude lower than expected and the half-life given was eight orders of magnitude shorter than what would be predicted for a <b>nuclide</b> alpha decaying with the claimed decay energy, {{but at the same}} time a corrected half-life in the region of 1016years would be impossible as it would imply that the samples contained about 100milligrams of sergenium. In 2003 it was suggested that the observed alpha decay with energy 4.5MeV could be due to a low-energy and strongly enhanced transition between different hyperdeformed states of a hassium isotope around 271Hs, thus suggesting that the existence of superheavy elements in nature was at least possible, although unlikely.|$|E
5|$|The {{most stable}} {{chlorine}} radioisotope is 36Cl. The primary decay mode of isotopes lighter than 35Cl is electron capture to isotopes of sulfur; that of isotopes heavier than 37Cl is beta decay to isotopes of argon; and 36Cl may decay by either mode to stable 36S or 36Ar. 36Cl occurs in trace quantities in {{nature as a}} cosmogenic <b>nuclide</b> in a ratio of about (7–10)×10−13 to 1 with stable chlorine isotopes: it is produced in the atmosphere by spallation of 36Ar by interactions with cosmic ray protons. In the top meter of the lithosphere, 36Cl is generated primarily by thermal neutron activation of 35Cl and spallation of 39K and 40Ca. In the subsurface environment, muon capture by 40Ca becomes more important {{as a way to}} generate 36Cl.|$|E

5|$|Animal {{studies show}} that astatine, {{similarly}} to iodine, although to a lesser extent, is preferentially concentrated in the thyroid gland. Unlike iodine, astatine also shows {{a tendency to be}} taken up by the lungs and spleen, possibly because of in-body oxidation of At– to At+. If administered {{in the form of a}} radiocolloid it tends to concentrate in the liver. Experiments in rats and monkeys suggest that astatine-211 causes much greater damage to the thyroid gland than does iodine-131, with repetitive injection of the <b>nuclide</b> resulting in necrosis and cell dysplasia within the gland. Early research suggested that injection of astatine into female rodents caused morphological changes in breast tissue; this conclusion remained controversial for many years. General agreement was later reached that this was likely caused by the effect of breast tissue irradiation combined with hormonal changes due to irradiation of the ovaries. Trace amounts of astatine can be handled safely in fume hoods if they are well-aerated; biological uptake of the element must be avoided.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from the}} {{practically}} stable 48Ca, the longest lived radioisotope of calcium is 41Ca. It decays by electron capture to stable 41K with a half-life {{of about a}} hundred thousand years. Its existence in the early Solar System as an extinct radionuclide has been inferred from excesses of 41K: traces of 41Ca also still exist today, {{as it is a}} cosmogenic <b>nuclide,</b> continuously reformed through neutron activation of natural 40Ca. Many other calcium radioisotopes are known, ranging from 34Ca to 57Ca: they are all much shorter-lived than 41Ca, the most stable among them being 45Ca (half-life 163days) and 47Ca (half-life 4.54days). The isotopes lighter than 42Ca usually undergo beta plus decay to isotopes of potassium, and those heavier than 44Ca usually undergo beta minus decay to isotopes of scandium, although near the nuclear drip lines proton emission and neutron emission begin to be significant decay modes as well.|$|E
5|$|Attempts to {{synthesize}} elements 119 and 120 push {{the limits of}} current technology, due to the decreasing cross sections of the production reactions and their probably short half-lives, expected {{to be on the}} order of microseconds. Heavier elements, beginning with element 121, would likely be too short-lived to be detected with current technology, decaying within a microsecond before reaching the detectors. Where this one-microsecond border of half-lives lies is not known, and this may allow the synthesis of elements 121 through 124, with the exact limit depending on the model chosen for predicting <b>nuclide</b> masses. The nuclides 296Uue, 296,299Ubn, 300Ubu, 300,303Ubb, 304Ubt, and 304Ubq, continuing up a possible narrow one-microsecond alpha-decaying corridor, could conceivably be produced in the reactions of projectiles of 50Ti, 54Cr, and 58Fe with targets of 248Cm, 249Bk, and 249Cf.|$|E
50|$|The line of beta {{stability}} {{follows a}} particular curve of neutron-proton ratio, {{corresponding to the}} most stable <b>nuclides.</b> On {{one side of the}} valley of stability, this ratiois small, corresponding to an excess of protons over neutrons in the <b>nuclides.</b> These <b>nuclides</b> tend to be unstable to β+ decay, since such decay converts a proton to a neutron.

On {{the other side of the}} valley of stability, this ratio is large, corresponding to an excess of neutrons over protons in the <b>nuclides.</b> These <b>nuclides</b> tend to be unstable to β- decay, since such decay converts neutrons to protons. On this side of the valley of stability, β- decay also serves to move <b>nuclides</b> toward a more stable neutron-proton ratio.|$|R

5|$|Rubidium-87 has a {{half-life}} of years, {{which is}} {{more than three times the}} age of the universe of years, making it a primordial <b>nuclide.</b> It readily substitutes for potassium in minerals, and is therefore fairly widespread. Rb has been used extensively in dating rocks; 87Rb beta decays to stable 87Sr. During fractional crystallization, Sr tends to concentrate in plagioclase, leaving Rb in the liquid phase. Hence, the Rb/Sr ratio in residual magma may increase over time, and the progressing differentiation results in rocks with elevated Rb/Sr ratios. The highest ratios (10 or more) occur in pegmatites. If the initial amount of Sr is known or can be extrapolated, then the age can be determined by measurement of the Rb and Sr concentrations and of the 87Sr/86Sr ratio. The dates indicate the true age of the minerals only if the rocks have not been subsequently altered (see rubidium–strontium dating).|$|E
5|$|The longest-lived of the {{radioactive}} isotopes of iodine is iodine-129, {{which has a}} half-life of 15.7millionyears, decaying via beta decay to stable xenon-129. Some iodine-129 was formed along with iodine-127 before {{the formation of the}} Solar System, but it has by now completely decayed away, making it an extinct radionuclide that is nevertheless still useful in dating the history of the early Solar System or very old groundwaters, due to its mobility in the environment. Its former presence may be determined from an excess of its daughter xenon-129. Traces of iodine-129 still exist today, as it is also a cosmogenic <b>nuclide,</b> formed from cosmic ray spallation of atmospheric xenon: these traces make up 10−14 to 10−10 of all natural iodine. It also occurs from open-air nuclear testing, and is not hazardous because of its incredibly long half-life, the longest of all fission products. At the peak of thermonuclear testing in the 1960s and 1970s, iodine-129 still made up only about 10−7 of all natural iodine. Excited states of iodine-127 and iodine-129 are often used in Mössbauer spectroscopy.|$|E
5|$|In {{a quantum}} {{tunneling}} model with mass estimates from a macroscopic-microscopic model, the alpha-decay half-lives of several unbinilium isotopes (292–304Ubn) have been predicted {{to be around}} 1–20 microseconds. Some heavier isotopes may be more stable; Fricke and Waber predicted 320Ubn {{to be the most}} stable unbinilium isotope in 1971. Since unbinilium is expected to decay via a cascade of alpha decays leading to spontaneous fission around copernicium, the total half-lives of unbinilium isotopes are also predicted to be measured in microseconds. This has consequences for the synthesis of unbinilium, as isotopes with half-lives below one microsecond would decay before reaching the detector. Nevertheless, new theoretical models show that the expected gap in energy between the proton orbitals 2f7/2 (filled at element 114) and 2f5/2 (filled at element 120) is smaller than expected, so that element 114 no longer appears to be a stable spherical closed nuclear shell, and this energy gap may increase the stability of elements 119 and 120. The next doubly magic nucleus is now expected to be around the spherical 306Ubb (element 122), but the expected low half-life and low production cross section of this <b>nuclide</b> makes its synthesis challenging.|$|E
