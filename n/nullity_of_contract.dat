40|$|The {{topic of}} {{contract}} of employment is still contemporary issue of czech labour law. Nowadays {{contract of employment}} is {{under the influence of}} a technical and societal progress which demands frequent and important legal changes. There is also the substantial influence of contemporary European tendency to make labour law more flexible with maintaining the high level of social security standards of employees. This tendency is widely known as "flexicurity". The thesis is divided into three chapters. The chapter deals with common principles of labour law which are crucially important for understanding the issue of contract of employment. For this reason, the charter contains explaining the term "labour law" and its object, principals of labour law, the relations between the Labour Code and Civil Code, the defining the term of dependent work. This term is strongly connected with the issue of disimulation of legal act. The Chapter Two discuss a contract of employment as an agreement between employees and their employers, which have some autonomy of will which is limited by law. One section deals with <b>nullity</b> <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> of employment or articles of contract, in other part I try to explain the legal form of contract of employment.

40|$|Governments {{and private}} firms try to contain {{corruption}} among their staff mostly in a top-down, rules-based approach. They limit discretion, increase monitoring or impose harsher penalties. Principles-based, bottom-up approaches to anticorruption, instead, {{emphasize the importance}} of value systems and employee's intrinsic motivation. This embraces the invigorating of social control systems, encouraging whistle-blowing, coding of good practice and alerting to red flags. This paper investigates how some top-down measures run counter to bottom-up contributions. Examples range from penalties imposed with zero-tolerance, debarment or the <b>nullity</b> <b>of</b> <b>contracts.</b> While top-down elements are indispensable for containing corruption they must be designed well in order to avoid discouraging the bottom-up endeavors.

40|$|We analyze a Principal-Agent {{model of}} an insurer who faces an adverse {{selection}} problem. He {{is unable to}} observe if his client has a high risk or a low risk of having an accident. At the underwriting <b>of</b> the <b>contract,</b> the insurer requests the client to declare his risk. After that, the former can costly audit the truthfulness of this announcement. If the audit confirms a false declaration, the insurer is legally allowed to punish the defrauder. We characterize the e¢cient contracts when this punishment is bounded from above by a legal restriction. Then, we do some comparative statics on the efficient contracts and on the agent’s utility. The most important result of this paper concerns the legal limit to a defrauder’s punishment. We prove that there exists a unique value of this legal limit that maximizes the expected utility of a high risk type. Facing this particular value of the legal limit to a defrauder’s punishment, the insurer will effectively audit a low risk report. We also show that this particular value increases with the probability of facing a high risk policy- holder. Therefore, when this probability is su¢ciently high, the <b>nullity</b> <b>of</b> the <b>contract</b> is not enough. From {{the point of view}} of a potential defrauder, the law should allow harder sanctions. This is an striking result because the <b>nullity</b> <b>of</b> the <b>contract</b> is a common sanction for this kind of fraud in the USA and in some European countries.

On November 15, 1947, the case of Krivenko vs. Register of Deeds, G. R. No. L-630 was decided by this Court holding that a conveyance of a residential land to aliens infringes Section 5, Article XIII of the Constitution. As a result, on December 15, 1947, plaintiffs demanded from the defendants to restore to them the lands above-referred to {{on the ground that}} the sale they made thereof to the defendants was null and void, but the latter refused to do so. Hence the plaintiffs brought this action on January 14, 1948, seeking the anullment of the sale above-mentioned.The court in said case that the Krivenko doctrine does not apply because at the time <b>of</b> the <b>contract</b> <b>of</b> sale was executed on 1943, the Philippines was under Japanese occupation thus the Constitution of the Philippines, political in nature, being the basis of the Krivenko ruling, was not in force at that time.

40|$|Contractual {{liability}} is {{an important}} topic of the ongoing reform of the effective Serbian Law on Obligations (2007 - 2009), which aims to harmonize the national legislation in this field with {{the laws of the}} European Union. In this paper the author analyzes the evolution of the traditional European civil codes (the German BGB, French Code civil, the Austrian ABGB the Swiss OR and the Hungarian Civil Code), with due attention to the doctrine and jurisprudence, taking into account the proposed reforms of the effective Serbian Law on Obligations concerning issues of contractual liability, such as the legal consequences of nonperformance, misperformance, default, etc. The author is of the opinion that the notion of the breach <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> doesn't cover all the cases in which contractual liability arises, although it embraces nonperformance, misperformance and default. The notion of contractual liability, namely, covers not only the cases <b>of</b> breach <b>of</b> <b>contract,</b> but the infringement of public policy, good morals and mandatory rules, which all lead to the <b>nullity</b> <b>of</b> the <b>contract.</b> In cases <b>of</b> voidable <b>contracts</b> (that is in case of defects of contractual will, such as mistake, deceit and duress) it is questionable whether the scope of contractual liability should be extended to mistake, which is a case of nonconscious discrepancy between contractual will and its expression. It is undisputable that contractual liability arises in case of deceit and duress, to the burden of the party acting in bad faith. The rescission <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> entails a separate complex of legal issues, since it may be justified by the other party's breach <b>of</b> the <b>contract.</b> It can also be onesided, two-sided or by a mutual agreement. Furthermore, specific rules apply to rescission <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> due to changed circumstances. In case of termination <b>of</b> a <b>contract</b> by mutual agreement, the parties usually agree on the extent of liability, that is on the extent of indemnification. Contractual liability is also specific that, according to the principle of parties' autonomy, the parties always may in advance agree on the extent of damages for the case <b>of</b> breach <b>of</b> <b>contract,</b> in a form of a clause on liquidated damages, forfeit money, suretyship for indemnification, the limitation of the sum insured in insurance contracts, clauses in the general conditions of business, etc. The author calls {{attention to the fact that}} these clauses in certain extent limit the scope of the indemnification for breach <b>of</b> a <b>contract,</b> according to which this liability differs from the liability for torts, where the principle of full indemnification applies as a rule...|$|R

40|$|The <b>nullity</b> <b>of</b> the {{juridical}} {{person is a}} notion without correspondence in the old civil law theory. In fact the regulation of the {{juridical person}} is a matter that enters relatively recent civil law because in traditional approach civil law dealt with natural persons and associations of natural persons only. The difference between the <b>nullity</b> <b>of</b> the agreement of association and the <b>nullity</b> <b>of</b> the juridical person itself, born by such association, is clearly revealed by the law. The two notions are still linked. One cannot imagine a <b>nullity</b> <b>of</b> the agreement without the <b>nullity</b> <b>of</b> the legal person born by such agreement. Nevertheless the <b>nullity</b> <b>of</b> the juridical person is laid down independently, comprising limited cases of occurrences. The regulation <b>of</b> the <b>nullity</b> <b>of</b> the juridical person finds out its correspondence in the Company Law. The <b>nullity</b> <b>of</b> {{the company has a}} distinct regulation, in Company Law, in line with the regulation <b>of</b> the <b>nullity</b> <b>of</b> the juridical person. In this case the civil law imported the notion from commercial law in order to limit the incidences <b>of</b> the <b>nullity</b> aiming the security of the civil circuit and the interest of the third persons. In a general accepted way, nullity represents a civil sanction which impedes the effects of an act concluded in a way that breach the law.
