East Harlem in New York City, a {{community}} with a large Puerto Rican population, has among {{the highest rates of}} asthma hospitalizations and mortality in the United States, but it is not known if the high rates are related to the ethnic composi-tion, environmental or community factors, or if the higher rates reflect differentials in access to appropriate asthma care.

40|$|Objectives: The {{diagnosis}} {{of pain in}} patients with low consciousness is a major challenge {{in the intensive care}} unit (ICU). Therefore, the use of behavioral tools for pain assessment could be an effective tool to manage pain in this group of patients. The aim of this study was to determine the effects on pain management by nurses using a critical care pain observational tool in patients with a decreased level of consciousness.  Methods: Our research used a before and after design to evaluate the ability of nurses to manage pain in patients with low consciousness. A total of 106 ICU nurses were included in the study. The study was divided into three phases: pre-implementation, implementation, and post-implementation. The researchers first observed the nurses management of pain in their patients; this was done three times using a checklist following tracheal suctioning and position change procedures. The nurses were then taught how to apply the critical-care pain observational tool (CPOT). Post-implementation of the tool, the researchers re-evaluated trained the nurses’ pain management.  Results: Performance scores after training improved with relation to the <b>nurses</b> <b>diagnosis</b> of pain, pharmacological and nonpharmacological actions, reassessment of pain, and re-relieving of any pain. However, use of the tool did not improve the recording of the patient’s pain and the relief measures used.  Conclusion: Use of the CPOT can increase nurse’s sensitivity to pain in non-conscious patients and drive them to track and perform pain management...|$|R

Referred patients with FM symptoms (n = 193) were randomized to a study group diagnosed by a specialized rheumatology nurse (SRN group, n = 97) or to a control group diagnosed by a rheumatologist (RMT group, n = 96). SRN patients were seen within 3 weeks by a nurse who took structured history and initiated routine laboratory tests. During a 5 -minute supervision session, the rheumatologist was informed by the nurse about medical history, performed a brief physical examination, and confirmed or rejected the <b>nurse's</b> <b>diagnosis.</b> RMT patients were seen by a rheumatologist after a regular waiting period of 3 months. Outcome measures were initial agreement between the nurse and rheumatologist in the SRN group, final diagnosis after 12 - 24 months of followup, patient satisfaction, and diagnostic costs. The mean waiting time after randomization was 2. 8 and 12. 1 weeks in the SRN and RMT groups, respectively. Eight RMT patients cancelled their appointments because of the waiting time. Excellent agreement (kappa = 0. 91) between rheumatologists and nurses was found. After 12 - 24 months of followup, none of the initial diagnoses were recalled in either group. SRN patients were significantly more satisfied than RMT patients. Mean diagnostic costs were lower in the SRN group (euro 219) than in the RMT group (euro 281) (95 % uncertainty interval euro- 103, euro- 20).

40|$|Modern {{nursing care}} is {{characterized}} by seeking, planning and satisfying needs of a healthy or an ill person. All this is performed {{by means of the}} nursing care process. The nursing care process is considered the basic scientific method of advanced nursing care leading to solution of problems. It has already become an inherent form of individual care planning. Thanks to the nursing care process a nurse has a holistic view of a patient and is able to provide quality care. Nursing care is provided in compliance with the nursing care process principles with regard to the specifics of geriatric care in senior homes. A senior home nurse takes into consideration the specifics of the individual phases of nursing care process in seniors. Senior homes provide residential services to people with lower self-sufficiency particularly caused by higher age and to those who need regular care in the field of self-sufficiency and personal care. Unfavourable social situation does not allow these people to live in their domestic environment. Complex care provided in senior homes substitutes for domestic environment. Seniors are also given health care provided by general nurses. The aim of the thesis was to examine nursing care process application in a senior home and the importance of the nursing care process {{from the point of view}} of senior home nurses. The following research questions were set: Which nursing care process phases are applied by nurses taking care about seniors in the senior home? How do senior home nurses feel the importance of nursing care process? Qualitative research by means of in-depth interview and questioning of nurses in a selected senior home in South Bohemia was chosen for collection of necessary information. The interviews were recorded and subsequently literally transcribed. The transcribed interviews were deeply analyzed by means of paper and pencil method by open coding. Four categories were created from the data analysis: Nursing care process, Nursing care process in practice, Nursing care process phases and Compilation of <b>nursing</b> care <b>diagnosis</b> and maintenance of nursing care documentation. Subcategories, where the core data are coded, are assigned to the individual categories, everything is illustrated by clear diagrams of the individual categories. The research shows that nurses have general knowledge of nursing care process. They were able to define nursing care process, to name its phases and to express their attitude to this method. They actively apply the process, but they say it is demanding for them from time and administration point of view. The fact that the knowledge of <b>nursing</b> care <b>diagnosis</b> is very poor among nurses is surprising.
