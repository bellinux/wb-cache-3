5|$|According to Herodotus, {{there were}} a total of 69,500 lightly armed troops – 35,000 helots and 34,500 troops {{from the rest of}} Greece; roughly one per hoplite. The number of 34,500 has been {{suggested}} to represent one light skirmisher supporting each non-Spartan hoplite (33,700), together with 800 Athenian archers, whose presence in the battle Herodotus later notes. Herodotus tells us that {{there were a}}lso 1,800 Thespians (but does <b>not</b> <b>say</b> <b>how</b> they were equipped), giving a total strength of 108,200 men.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} attempt to {{understand}} the many species, Lull found two groups, although he did <b>not</b> <b>say</b> <b>how</b> he distinguished them: one composed of T. horridus, T. prorsus, and T. brevicornus; the other of T. elatus and T. calicornis. Two species (T. serratus and T. flabellatus) stood apart from these groups. By 1933, and his revision of the landmark 1907 Hatcher-Marsh-Lull monograph of all known ceratopsians, he retained his two groups and two unaffiliated species, with a third lineage of T. obtusus and T. hatcheri that was characterized by a very small nasal horn. T. horridus-T. prorsus-T. brevicornus was now {{thought to be the}} most conservative lineage, with an increase in skull size and a decrease in nasal horn size, and T. elatus-T. calicornis was defined by large brow horns and small nasal horn. C. M. Sternberg made one modification, adding T. eurycephalus and suggesting that it linked the second and third lineages closer together than they were to the T. horridus lineage. This pattern was followed until the major studies of the 1980s and 1990s.|$|E

25|$|There {{are also}} other {{difficulties}} in researching {{the effects of}} cannabis. Many people who smoke cannabis also smoke tobacco.

Some of the women appear to be unconscious, and many share the same physical characteristics as the original 11 victims. The following day the police released an additional photograph of another woman; this woman was subsequently identified by family members, who reported that she had {{died of natural causes}} several years ago.

25|$|The vehicle {{tracking}} and maintenance issue had not improved by August 2013. The Washington Post {{reported that the}} Ellerbe never ordered the 16 fire engines and seven ladder trucks which he said were needed in 2011. Ellerbe blamed the city council and an unspecified dispute with a vendor for the two-and-a-half year delay. He also asserted that six new fire engines and two new ladder trucks had been ordered, but did <b>not</b> <b>say</b> <b>how</b> long it would be until they arrived. The newspaper also reported that Ellerbe had yet to fix the vehicular tracking database problem. The department spent $160,000 on a consultant to inventory the department's equipment, but no permanent staff person had been hired to oversee the project and keep it going.|$|E
25|$|Witt then {{traveled}} to Kentucky, {{where he was}} {{to work on the}} Louisville and Portland Canal. Sources vary considerably as to the next sequence of events. Two sources say Witt spent 18 months there, but did not finish the work and so returned to Albany. Maurice Joblin, however, says he fell ill shortly after arriving in Kentucky, and returned to Albany for 13 months of recuperation. The New York Times said Witt completed work on the canal (although it did <b>not</b> <b>say</b> <b>how</b> long that took) and then returned to Albany, If Witt worked on the canal, it seems unlikely that he spent much time there. The canal had been completed in December 1830, and the United States Army Corps of Engineers records almost no work done on the canal between 1830 and 1848 (when Witt is known to have been in Cleveland).|$|E

25|$|With {{the death}} of Tutankhamun and the two {{stillborn}} children buried with him, the Thutmoside family line came to an end. The Amarna letters indicate that Tutankhamun's wife, recently widowed, wrote to the Hittite king Suppiluliuma I, asking if she could marry one of his sons. The letters do <b>not</b> <b>say</b> <b>how</b> Tutankhamun died. In the message, Ankhesenamun says {{that she was very}} afraid, but would not take one of her own people as husband. However, the son was killed before reaching his new wife. Shortly afterward, Ay married Tutankhamun's widow and became Pharaoh as a war was fought between the two countries, and Egypt was left defeated. The fate of Ankhesenamun is not known, but she disappears from record and Ay's second wife Tey became Great Royal Wife. After Ay's death, Horemheb usurped the throne and instigated a campaign of damnatio memoriae against him. Tutankhamun's father Akhenaten, stepmother Nefertiti, his wife Ankhesenamun, half sisters and other family members were also included. Not even Tutankhamun was spared. His images and cartouches were also erased. Horemheb himself was left childless and willed the throne to Paramessu, who founded the Ramesside family line of pharaohs.|$|E
25|$|Towards {{the end of}} the airline's life, on most {{economy class}} flights within North America, to/from Canada, and to/from resort {{destinations}} within the Caribbean and Latin America, Continental had a buy on board service. On those flights between 2 hours and 6 hours, snacks were available for purchase, and food for purchase was available on most of those flights that are 3 to 6 hours. Originally the airline provided meals free of charge on flights more than 1 hours. The airline continued doing so after competitors charged for meals. In March 2010 the airline announced that it would switch to buy on board for food in fall 2010. The airline said that the absence of free meals would save the airline $35million per year ($ when adjusted for inflation), and if half of economy class passengers on the affected flights purchased food, the airline would make an additional $17million per year ($ when adjusted for inflation). The airline did <b>not</b> <b>say</b> <b>how</b> the transition to buy on board would affect the employment of workers at the subsidiary Chelsea Food Services. Buy on board began on October 12, 2010. On March 1, 2011, Continental stopped serving free snacks on domestic flights to coach passengers in order to align itself with the policy of United Airlines. In addition, on that day all fights between Hawaii, Alaska, and the Mainland U.S. became buy on board flights.|$|E

500|$|In a November {{session of}} the Federation Council, Putin stated that {{establishing}} the national symbols (anthem, flag and coat of arms) should be a top priority for the country. Putin pressed for the former Soviet anthem to be selected as the new Russian anthem, but strongly suggested that new lyrics be written. He did <b>not</b> <b>say</b> <b>how</b> much of the old Soviet lyrics should be retained for the new anthem. Putin submitted the bill [...] "On the National Anthem of the Russian Federation" [...] to the Duma for their consideration on 4 December. The Duma voted 381–51–1 in favor of adopting Alexandrov's music as the national anthem on 8 December 2000. Following the vote, a committee was formed and tasked with exploring lyrics for the national anthem. After receiving over 6,000 manuscripts from all sectors of Russian society, the committee selected lyrics by Mikhalkov for the anthem.|$|E
500|$|Diodorus {{suggests}} that there were 1,000 Lacedemonians and 3,000 other Peloponnesians, totalling 4,000. Herodotus agrees with this figure in one passage, quoting an inscription by Simonides saying there were 4,000 Peloponnesians. However, elsewhere, in the passage summarized by the above table, Herodotus tallies 3,100 Peloponnesians at Thermopylae before the battle. Herodotus also reports that at Xerxes' public showing of the dead, [...] "helots were also there for them to see", but he does <b>not</b> <b>say</b> <b>how</b> many or in what capacity they served. Thus, the difference between his two figures can be squared by supposing (without proof) that there were 900 helots (three per Spartan) present at the battle. If helots were present at the battle, {{there is no reason}} to doubt that they served in their traditional role as armed retainers to individual Spartans. Alternatively, Herodotus' [...] "missing" [...] 900 troops might have been Perioeci, and could therefore correspond to Diodorus' 1,000 Lacedemonians.|$|E
500|$|Hemingway {{returned}} home early in 1919 {{to a time}} of readjustment. Not yet 20 years old, he had gained from the war a maturity that was at odds with living at home without a job and {{with the need for}} recuperation. As Reynolds explains, [...] "Hemingway could not really tell his parents what he thought when he saw his bloody knee. He could <b>not</b> <b>say</b> <b>how</b> scared he was in another country with surgeons who could not tell him in English if his leg was coming off or not." [...] In September, he took a fishing and camping trip with high school friends to the back-country of Michigan's Upper Peninsula. The trip became the inspiration for his short story [...] "Big Two-Hearted River", in which the semi-autobiographical character Nick Adams takes to the country to find solitude after returning from war. A family friend offered him a job in Toronto, and with nothing else to do, he accepted. Late that year he began as a freelancer, staff writer, and foreign correspondent for the Toronto Star Weekly. He returned to Michigan the following June and then moved to Chicago in September 1920 to live with friends, while still filing stories for the Toronto Star.|$|E

2500|$|Easter is {{the most}} {{important}} Christian feast, and the proper date of its celebration {{has been the subject of}} controversy as early as the meeting of Anicetus and Polycarp around 154. According to Eusebius' Church History, quoting Polycrates of Ephesus, churches in the Roman Province of Asia [...] "always observed the day when the people put away the leaven", namely Passover, the 14th of the lunar month of Nisan. The rest of the Christian world at that time, according to Eusebius, held to [...] "the view which still prevails," [...] of fixing Easter on Sunday. Eusebius does <b>not</b> <b>say</b> <b>how</b> the Sunday was decided. Other documents from the 3rd and 4th centuries reveal that the customary practice was for Christians to consult their Jewish neighbors to determine when the week of Passover would fall, and to set Easter on the Sunday that fell within that week.|$|E
