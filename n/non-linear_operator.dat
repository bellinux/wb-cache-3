In such research, the first priority is to understand {{the structure of the}} problem and to give a theoretical answer to the three Hadamard questions (so that the problem is solved from the theoretical point of view). It is only later in a study that regularization and interpretation of the solution's (or solutions', depending upon conditions of uniqueness) dependence upon parameters and data/measurements (probabilistic ones or others) can be done. Hence the corresponding following sections do not really apply to these problems. Whereas linear inverse problems were completely solved from the theoretical point of view {{at the end of the}} nineteenth century, only one class of nonlinear inverse problems was so before 1970, that of inverse spectral and (one space dimension) inverse scattering problems, after the seminal work of the Russian mathematical school (Krein, Gelfand, Levitan, Marchenko).

40|$|This article {{presents}} a new reduced order model based upon proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) for solving the Navier-Stokes equations. The novelty {{of the method}} lies in its treatment of the equation’s <b>non-linear</b> <b>operator,</b> for which a new method is proposed that provides accurate simulations within an efficient framework. The method itself is a hybrid of two existing approaches {{that have already been}} developed to treat non-linear operators within reduced order models. The first of these approaches is one that approximates non-linear operators through quadratic expansions, and this is then blended within a second technique known as the Discrete Empirical Interpolation Method (DEIM). The method proposed applies the quadratic expansion to provide a first approximation of the <b>non-linear</b> <b>operator,</b> and DEIM is then used as a corrector to improve its representation. In addition to the treatment of the <b>non-linear</b> <b>operator</b> the POD model is stabilized using a Petrov-Galerkin method. This adds artificial dissipation to the solution of the reduced order model which is necessary to avoid spurious oscillations and unstable solutions. A demonstration of the capabilities of this new approach is provided by simulating a flow past a cylinder and gyre problems. Comparisons are made with other treatments of non-linear operators, and these show the new method to provide significant improvements in the solution’s accuracy...|$|E

40|$|The Concordance-based Medial Axis Transform (CMAT) {{presented}} in this paper is a multiscale medial axis (MMA) algorithm that computes the medial response from grey-level boundary measures. This <b>non-linear</b> <b>operator</b> responds only to symmetric structures, overcoming the limitations of linear medial operators which create "side-lobe " responses for symmetric structures and respond to edge structures. In addition, the spatial localisation of the medial axis and the identification of object width is improved in the CMAT algorithm compared with linear algorithms. The robustness of linear medial operators to noise is preserved in our algorithm. The effectiveness of the CMAT is accredited to the concordance property described in this paper. We demonstrate the performance of this method with test figures used by other authors and medical images that are relatively complex in structure. In these complex images the benefit of the improved response of our <b>non-linear</b> <b>operator</b> is clearly visible...|$|E

40|$|A <b>non-linear</b> <b>operator</b> {{approach}} to estimation in discrete-time multivariable systems is described. It involves inferential estimation of a signal which enters a communication channel that contains non-linearities and transport delays. The measurements {{are assumed to}} be corrupted by a coloured noise signal correlated with the signal to be estimated. The solution of the non-linear estimation problem is obtained using nonlinear operators. The signal and noise channels may be grossly non-linear and are represented in a very general <b>non-linear</b> <b>operator</b> form. The resulting so-called Wiener non-linear minimum variance estimation algorithm is relatively simple to implement. The optimal non-linear estimator is derived in terms of the nonlinear operators and can be implemented as a recursive algorithm using a discrete-time non-linear difference equation. In the limiting case of a linear system, the estimator has the form of a Wiener filter in discrete-time polynomial matrix system form. A non-linear channel equalisation problem is considered for the design example...|$|E

The problem is modeled using the radiative transfer equation {{by means of an}} explicit <b>non-linear</b> <b>operator</b> that gives the ballistic and scattering measurements {{as a function of the}} radioactive source and attenuation distributions. First, by differentiating this <b>non-linear</b> <b>operator</b> we obtain a linearized inverse problem. Then, under regularity hypothesis for the source distribution and attenuation map and considering small attenuations, we rigorously prove that the linear operator is invertible and we compute its inverse explicitly. This allows proof of local uniqueness for the non-linear inverse problem. Finally, using the previous inversion result for the linear operator, we propose a new type of iterative algorithm for simultaneous source and attenuation recovery for SPECT based on the Neumann series and a Newton-Raphson algorithm.

40|$|<b>Non-linear</b> image {{processing}} <b>operators</b> give excellent {{results in a}} number of {{image processing}} tasks such as restoration and object recognition. However they are frequently excluded from use in solutions because the system designer does not wish to introduce additional hardware or algorithms and because their design can appear to be ad hoc. In practice the median filter is often used though it is rarely optimal. This paper explains how various <b>non-linear</b> image processing <b>operators</b> may be implemented on a basic linear image processing system using only convolution and thresholding operations. The paper is aimed at image processing system developers wishing to include some <b>non-linear</b> processing <b>operators</b> without introducing additional system capabilities such as extra hardware components or software toolboxes. It may also be of benefit to the interested reader wishing to learn more about <b>non-linear</b> <b>operators</b> and alternative methods of design and implementation. The non-linear tools include various components of mathematical morphology, median and weighted median operators and various order statistic filters. As well as describing novel algorithms for implementation within a linear system the paper also explains how the optimum filter parameters may be estimated for a given image processing task.
