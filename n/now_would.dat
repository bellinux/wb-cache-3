25|$|In 2012, economists {{surveyed}} by the University of Chicago rejected the viewpoint that the Laffer Curve's postulation of increased tax revenue through a rate cut applies to federal US income taxes {{of the time}} in the medium term.

25|$|In May 1940, the {{armoured}} brigades became homogeneous {{and were}} reorganised; all <b>now</b> <b>would</b> contain 10 cruisers within the brigade headquarters, while the regimental headquarters would have four cruisers. Each regimental headquarters would control a headquarters squadron and three sabre squadrons; {{each of which}} consisted of a squadron headquarters, with two cruisers and two close support tanks, and four troops each comprising three cruisers. In total, each regiment would consist of 46 cruisers and 8 close support tanks, 31 officers and 546 other ranks, with the brigade being able to muster 166 tanks. The October 1940 authorised changes allocated an infantry battalion to the brigade, but made no other changes.|$|E
25|$|Boulstred {{eventually}} {{started a}} relationship with Sir Thomas Roe, Sir John Roe’s cousin.

What likely <b>now</b> <b>would</b> have been diagnosed as a brain tumor or gastric cancer was identified by doctors of the College of Medicine at the time as “the mother,” a.k.a. wandering womb – an imprecise medical diagnosis employed…to cover ailments that were thought to attend upon feminine frailty.” Her symptoms included stomach pain, sleeplessness, fever, and vomiting. A cure could not be found, and she wasted away at the countess of Bedford’s house in Twickenham, unable to hold down food or liquids.|$|E

25|$|Gas-core reactor. A {{closed loop}} {{version of the}} nuclear {{lightbulb}} rocket, where the fissile material is gaseous uranium-hexafluoride contained in a fused silica vessel. A working gas (such as hydrogen) would flow around this vessel and absorb the UV light produced by the reaction. This reactor design could also function as a rocket engine, as featured in Harry Harrison's 1976 science-fiction novel Skyfall. In theory, using UF6 as a working fuel directly (rather than as a stage to one, as is done <b>now)</b> <b>would</b> mean lower processing costs, and very small reactors. In practice, running a reactor at such high power densities would probably produce unmanageable neutron flux, weakening most reactor materials, and therefore as the flux {{would be similar to}} that expected in fusion reactors, it would require similar materials to those selected by the International Fusion Materials Irradiation Facility.|$|E
25|$|On February 6, 2015, Paramount Pictures and New Regency {{announced}} that Robert Zemeckis was to direct an untitled World War II romantic thriller, in which Brad Pitt would star.

On June 8, 2015, Marion Cotillard was cast to play a spy along with Pitt, who fall in love during a mission to kill a German official. In August 2015, Knight said that the film {{would be based on}} a true story told to him at the age of 21, and also that the shooting would start in January 2016. On January 28, 2016, Jared Harris joined the film. On March 8, 2016, Lizzy Caplan was cast to play Pitt's sister. Executive producers on the film would be Knight, Jack Rapke, Patrick McCormick and Denis O'Sullivan. Alan Silvestri composed the music.|$|E
25|$|The Stralsund {{area had}} been tied to Denmark in the Late Middle Ages, was of {{strategic}} importance as a bridgehead into the Holy Roman Empire, and a potent exporter of wool and grain. First Danish claims to northern Swedish Pomerania were formulated in 1713, and a respective treaty was drafted in May 1715 between Frederick IV and George I which guaranteed the Danish occupied Swedish dominion of Bremen-Verden to George I {{in return for}} him entering the war on Frederik's side, and Pomerania north of the Peene river as well as 30,000 talers to Frederik IV. When Prussia, keen to annex Swedish Pomerania as well, joined the allies in summer, a Dano-Prussian treaty was concluded partitioning Swedish Pomerania along the Peene, with Denmark being assured her claims for the northern part with Stralsund, and Prussia for the southern part with Stettin. August the Strong's protests and Danish tendencies to minimize their military efforts in the coalition after the treaty, resulting from Frederik IV's understanding that he <b>now</b> <b>would</b> gain Stralsund anyway, led to quarrels in the siege force.|$|E

25|$|Through the Christian {{community}} in Japan, Pessoa was {{informed of the}} intrigues against him and promptly prepared for defence and departure. He prepared a large quantity of hand grenades and ammunition aboard the ship, but due to the large size of the cargo, the ship {{was not ready to}} sail until after New Years Day in 1610, whereas previous Macanese vessels usually returned before Christmas. While the ship was being loaded, Arima tried to entice Pessoa to come ashore with offers of hospitality, saying that he had been sent to Nagasaki only to negotiate silk prices, and that the high officials in Sunpu only wanted Pessoa to give his account of the Macau events in person—he would be pardoned as a foreigner even if he was found guilty. Many Portuguese believed Arima, but not Pessoa, who knew Arima had assembled a force of 1200 samurai against him. Pessoa <b>now</b> <b>would</b> not go ashore even for Mass, and ordered his crew to come aboard the carrack to set sail. However, this was delayed as some crew believed that the current crisis was merely Pessoa's personal feud and dragged their feet, while most who had wanted to embark were obstructed by Japanese guards. By the time Arima attacked the carrack on January 3, only about 50 Europeans were on board with some black slaves and lascars.|$|E
25|$|Slartibartfast, Arthur, and Ford {{transport}} to an airborne party that has lasted numerous generations where another Gate component, the Silver Bail, {{is to be}} found, but Arthur finds himself separated from the others and ends up at a Cathedral of Hate created by a being called Agrajag. Agrajag reveals that Arthur has killed him countless times before, each time reincarnating into a new form that is soon killed by Arthur, and now plans to kill Arthur in revenge. However, when he realises that Arthur has yet to cause his death {{at a place called}} Stavromula Beta, Agrajag discovered he took Arthur out of his relative timeline too soon and that killing him <b>now</b> <b>would</b> cause a paradox, but attempts to kill Arthur anyway. In his insanity, Agrajag brings the Cathedral down around them. Arthur manages to escape unharmed, partially due to learning how to fly after falling and missing the ground while catching sight of a piece of luggage he had lost at a Greek airport years before. After collecting the suitcase, Arthur inadvertently comes across the flying party and rejoins his friends. Inside, they find Trillian, but they are too late to stop the robots from stealing the Bail. Arthur, Ford, Trillian, and Slartibartfast return to the Bistromath and try to head off the robots activating the Wikkit Gate.|$|E
25|$|As {{part of the}} Army transformation, it was re-organized in 1993. The {{division}} of the territory in military regions and zones was kept, with {{the reduction of the}} number of regions, but with the raising of the Airborne Troops Command (using the structure of the previous Air Force's Paratroopers Command) and the Santa Margarida Military Camp as two special territorial commands. The regiments of the Army became again designed by numbers and not anymore by the place where they were based. The assigned numbers were not consecutive, as in previous organizations, but were the historical numbers previously used by each unit or by its predecessor in the same garrison place. The old 1950's plans to equip the Army with light aviation assets were resumed, with the raising of a Light Aviation Unit that was intended to operate helicopters. However, the reception of the planned helicopters was delayed successively until being finally canceled and the unit disbanded. The military regions and zones continued to be responsible for keeping territorial defense brigades and battle groups, mostly maintained only in cadre strength in time of peace. The Army <b>now</b> <b>would</b> have an increased permanent operational force with three brigades: the Independent Airborne Brigade (BAI), the Independent Mechanized Brigade (BMI) and the Light Intervention Brigade (BLI). The BAI resulted from the old Air Force's Light Paratrooper Brigade, also absorbing the parachute qualified members of the disbanded Commando Regiment. The BMI resulted from the fully mechanization of the previous 1st Composite Brigade. The BLI would be a completely newly raised motorized infantry brigade, although inheriting part of the disbanded Special Forces Brigade. Operationally, each of the three brigades had a similar organization that included three maneuver (infantry / armoured) and one field artillery battalion, engineering, signals and services companies, an armored reconnaissance squadron and an anti-aircraft battery. Administratively however each of the brigades had completely different organizations, with the BAI being entirely maintained by the Airborne Troops Command in several of its regiments and other units spread across the country, with the BMI being entirely maintained by the Santa Margarida Military Camp concentrated in a single place and with the BLI being maintained by the several military regions in their several regiments spread across the country.|$|E
