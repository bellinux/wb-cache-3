25|$|Earlier in the season, Sue Ellen gets drunk {{after having}} seen J.R. {{in bed with}} Holly Harwood. She gets into a car and Ray Krebbs' cousin Mickey Trotter tries to stop her and they are {{involved}} in an accident, in a car belonging to J.R., just outside Southfork. Sue Ellen emerges with <b>nothing</b> <b>worse</b> than bruises, but Mickey is paralyzed from the neck down and in a coma. In the final episode of the season, Ray finds out that the driver of the other car was Walt Driscoll, J.R.'s rival. He also learns that Driscoll deliberately caused the accident, thinking that J.R. was driving, as a means of revenge for being put in jail by J.R. earlier in the year. An angered Ray comes to Southfork late at night demanding answers from J.R., who was not expecting to see him. J.R. asks him what is going on and Ray says he's going to kill J.R. for what happened. J.R. throws a candle holder at Ray, which misses him and knocks over another candle holder with lit candles in it. As the two brawl, the candles ignite a fire and the smoke starts to creep into both John Ross and Sue Ellen's bedrooms as they sleep. Sue Ellen had been given a sedative by the doctor earlier in the day so she doesn't wake up. J.R. notices the fire and tries to break free of Ray, finally knocking him out with a telephone, and runs upstairs to try to save his wife and son. Ray recovers and runs after J.R. but is consumed by smoke and falls. J.R. is hit with a falling beam as he gets upstairs and both men are unconscious as Southfork burns.|$|E
500|$|As of May 2015, {{the only}} direct {{outcome of the}} inquiry into the police {{response}} to the shooting was lowering of wage of a dispatch officer, who advised the policemen on spot over the radio not to engage [...] "so that <b>nothing</b> <b>worse</b> happens".|$|E
500|$|The {{other major}} {{feature of the}} race was a {{succession}} of crashes. Sep Vanmarcke (...) slipped on the Paterberg, though this resulted in <b>nothing</b> <b>worse</b> than a broken shoe; however, a major crash early in the race caused significant problems {{for a number of}} riders. The worst affected was Fabian Cancellara (...) , one of the major favourites for victory; he broke two vertebrae, ruling him out of the remainder of the classics season.|$|E

500|$|Prior to {{the start}} of filming, Corman had set aside one day of rehearsals with his cast. [...] "Previously, I had {{painstakingly}} rehearsed the actors so there was complete understanding as to what each was to accomplish in each scene. This is most important; there is <b>nothing</b> <b>worse</b> than to be on the set and ready to roll, only to find that director and actor have different views as to how the scene is to be done. Thanks to pre-production planning and rehearsals, there was no time wasted on the set in haggling and making decisions." ...|$|E
500|$|In his Middle East Diary Coward {{made several}} {{statements}} that offended many Americans. In particular, he commented {{that he was}} [...] "less impressed {{by some of the}} mournful little Brooklyn boys lying there in tears amid the alien corn with <b>nothing</b> <b>worse</b> than a bullet wound in the leg or a fractured arm". After protests from both The New York Times and The Washington Post, the Foreign Office urged Coward not to visit the United States in January 1945. He did not return to America again during the war. In the aftermath of the war, Coward wrote an alternative reality play, Peace In Our Time, depicting an England occupied by Nazi Germany.|$|E
500|$|The {{lyrics are}} {{deliberately}} obscure; Shields joked {{that he once}} considered rating various attempts to decipher {{the words on the}} band's website according to percentage of accuracy. He claims that he and Butcher [...] "spent way more time on the lyrics than ever on the music". The words were often written in late-night eight- to ten-hour-long sessions before the pair were due to record the vocals. The pair worked diligently to ensure the lyrics were not lackluster, even though few changes actually resulted; Shields said, [...] "There's <b>nothing</b> <b>worse</b> than bad lyrics." [...] Nonetheless, pressed by Selects David Cavanagh to reveal just the first line of [...] "Loomer", Butcher refused, and Shields claimed to have [...] "absolutely no idea" [...] what she was singing.|$|E

500|$|Closely {{associated}} with the now unpopular disco and having had no hit singles in the preceding few years, after leaving Fantasy Sylvester was not a particular draw for major record labels. Recognizing this state of affairs, in 1982 Sylvester commented that [...] "there's <b>nothing</b> <b>worse</b> than a fallen star" [...] who still has [...] "illusions" [...] of their continuing fame. Rather than chasing major chart success, Sylvester wanted to focus on retaining creative control over his music. Hiring his former tour manager and longstanding friend Tim McKenna as his new manager, Sylvester decided to produce his next album with Megatone Records, a small San Francisco company that had been founded in 1981 by Patrick Cowley and Marty Blecman and which catered largely to the gay club scene. The result was All I Need (1982), on which James Wirrick had written most of the songs, which were dance-orientated and influenced by the new wave music then in vogue. Sylvester insisted that he include several ballads on the album, which featured cover art by Mark Amerika depicting Sylvester in ancient Egyptian garb.|$|E
500|$|Other parodies {{have been}} presented, {{including}} the devil corollary, the no devil corollary and the extreme no devil corollary. The devil corollary proposes that a being than which <b>nothing</b> <b>worse</b> can be conceived {{exists in the}} understanding (sometimes the term lesser is used in place of worse). Using Anselm's logical form, the parody argues that if it exists in the understanding, a worse being would be one that exists in reality; thus, such a being exists. The no devil corollary is similar, but argues that a worse being would be {{one that does not}} exist in reality, so does not exist. The extreme no devil corollary advances on this, proposing that a worse being would be that which does not exist in the understanding, so such a being exists neither in reality nor in the understanding. Timothy Chambers argued that the devil corollary is more powerful than Gaunilo's challenge because it withstands the challenges that may defeat Gaunilo's parody. He also claimed that the no devil corollary is a strong challenge, as it [...] "underwrites" [...] the no devil corollary, which [...] "threatens Anselm's argument at its very foundations".|$|E
500|$|The {{music for}} Countdown to Extinction {{was written in}} two {{different}} sessions. The first session was done following the conclusion of Clash of the Titans tour, while the second session took place after a one-month break, {{in the fall of}} 1991. The album was recorded {{in the first half of}} 1992, when the Rodney King Riots took place. These events negatively affected the recording process, as the band was forced to leave the studio every night at six o'clock because of the enacted curfew. Dave Mustaine shared his experience: [...] "There’s <b>nothing</b> <b>worse</b> than getting a creative moment and you have to leave. It was like a school bell ringing." [...] The record was produced by Mustaine and Max Norman at The Enterprise in Burbank, California, while the mixing was handed by Norman with the help of Fred Kelly. Referring to the recording process, Mustaine said that Countdown to Extinction [...] "was one of those records where everything was firing on all 12 cylinders and you just know it". He also said that it didn't take the band a long time to record the album because [...] "records were a lot easier to make back then because the pressure wasn't quite as hard".|$|E

500|$|Lost writer Elizabeth Sarnoff {{explained}} that Michael's storyline in season two is about [...] "what a father {{will do to}} save his son"; she noted [...] "there's <b>nothing</b> <b>worse</b> than what he does". The second episode of season two was originally going to be Sawyer centric, however this was rewritten [...] "at the proverbial last minute" [...] and changed to a Michael centric episode. Perrineau received swimming lessons in preparation for this episode. Perrineau was unaware that his character had been captured by the Others until he was told Michael {{was going to kill}} Ana Lucia and Libby. Perrineau described shooting the scenes in [...] "Two for the Road" [...] where Michael murders Ana Lucia and Libby as a [...] "tough day". The last scene shot of season two was Michael and Walt sailing away from the Island. As it was a long camera shot, Perrineau had to sail the boat so far from the pier, that by the time he returned, all the equipment had already been packed away. He said, [...] "It felt fitting, actually. Like; that's it". Perrineau knew he would be back one day, but as the producers did not reveal any details to him, he did not know when. He was the first actor that left the show as [...] "part of a grander design to come back", and the only one until Emilie de Ravin.|$|E
500|$|Bilinda Butcher's vocals {{have been}} {{referred}} to as a trademark of My Bloody Valentine's sound, alongside Shields' guitar techniques. On a number of occasions during the recording of Isn't Anything and Loveless, Butcher was awoken and recorded vocals, which she said [...] "influenced [...] sound" [...] by making them [...] "more dreamy and sleepy". The vocals in most My Bloody Valentine's recordings are low in the mix as Shields intended for the vocals to be used as an instrument. Critics have often described an androgynous sound to the band's vocals. My Bloody Valentine's lyrics are mostly written by Shields. However, Butcher wrote a third of the lyrics on both Isn't Anything and Loveless, but has referred {{to a lot of the}} lyrics as [...] "plain nonsense." [...] According to Butcher, she [...] "didn't have a plan and never thought about lyrics until it was time to write them. I just used whatever was in my head for the moment." [...] Some of her lyrics were written as a result of attempting to interpret rough versions of songs Shields had recorded. Butcher has said: [...] "He [...] never sang any words on the cassettes I got but I tried to make his sounds into words." [...] Butcher and Shields would often spend eight to ten hours a night writing lyrics, even though few changes actually resulted, as Shields believed [...] "there's <b>nothing</b> <b>worse</b> than bad lyrics." [...] Spin writer Simon Reynolds has noted that the band's lyrics often contain sexual themes, which are [...] "a paradoxical blend of force and tenderness".|$|E
2500|$|Ambrose Bierce {{mentioned}} {{being at}} Philippi Races. He had enlisted {{as a private}} in Company C. Years later, in 1903, Bierce revisited the town. He recalled that visit and the battle in a 1904 piece written for the Eighth Annual Reunion of the 9th Indiana, noting that the Union battery involved [...] "did <b>nothing</b> <b>worse</b> than take off a young Confederate's leg." ...|$|E

2500|$|Physical {{damage to}} the spinal cord may result in loss of {{sensation}} or movement. [...] If an injury to the spine produces <b>nothing</b> <b>worse</b> than swelling, the symptoms may be transient, but if nerve fibers in the spine are actually destroyed, the loss of function is usually permanent. [...] Experimental {{studies have shown that}} spinal nerve fibers attempt to regrow {{in the same way as}} nerve fibers, but in the spinal cord, tissue destruction usually produces scar tissue that cannot be penetrated by the regrowing nerves.|$|E
2500|$|In November 2006, {{when asked}} about the war in Iraq, Pryce ended an {{interview}} with CNN by walking away. In a statement later issued to CNN, Pryce said: [...] "What's happening in Iraq is not a direct reflection on me." [...] The statement also said that [...] "I voted to give the president the authority to use force in Iraq; that doesn't mean I'm always happy with what I see, but I can think of <b>nothing</b> <b>worse</b> for our troops or our prospects for success than having 435 members of Congress second-guessing our commanders." ...|$|E
2500|$|Octavius goes to Cleopatra {{trying to}} persuade her to surrender.

[...] This speech is full of dramatic irony, because in Shakespeare's time Cleopatra really was played by a [...] "squeaking boy" [...] and Shakespeare's play does depict Antony's drunken revels.|$|E
