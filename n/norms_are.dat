Such studies show the importance of local social norms, government policies and cultural situations. Feminist economists see such variation as a crucial factor {{to be included in}} economics.|$|E

500|$|As {{long ago}} as 1937, Lewis Terman pointed out that error of {{estimation}} in IQ scoring increases as IQ score increases, {{so that there is}} less and less certainty about assigning a test-taker to one band of scores or another as one looks at higher bands. Current IQ tests also have large error bands for high IQ scores. As an underlying reality, such distinctions as those between [...] "exceptionally gifted" [...] and [...] "profoundly gifted" [...] have never been well established. All longitudinal studies of IQ have shown that test-takers can bounce up and down in score, and thus switch up and down in rank order as compared to one another, over the course of childhood. Some test-givers claim that IQ classification categories such as [...] "profoundly gifted" [...] are meaningful, but those are based on the obsolete Stanford–Binet Third Revision (Form L-M) test. The highest reported standard score for most IQ tests is IQ 160, approximately the 99.997th percentile (leaving aside the issue of the considerable error in measurement at that level of IQ on any IQ test). IQ scores above this level are dubious as there are insufficient normative cases upon which to base a statistically justified rank-ordering. Moreover, there has never been any validation of the Stanford–Binet L-M on adult populations, and there is no trace of such terminology in the writings of Lewis Terman. Although two current tests attempt to provide [...] "extended norms" [...] that allow for classification of different levels of giftedness, those <b>norms</b> <b>are</b> not based on well validated data.|$|E
