40|$|We study, to one loop order, the {{behavior}} of the gluon self-energy in the non covariant Coulomb gauge at finite temperature. The cancellation of the peculiar energy divergences, which arise in such a gauge, is explicitly verified in the complete two point function of the Yang-Mills theory. At high temperatures, the leading T 2 term is determined to be transverse and nonlocal, in agreement with the results obtained in covariant gauges. The coefficient of the sub-leading ln(T) contribution, is <b>non</b> <b>transverse</b> but local and coincides (up to a multiplicative constant) with that of the ultraviolet pole term of the zero temperature amplitude. In thermal field theory, one is often interested in the contributions which arise from the region where the loop momenta are of the same order as the temperature T, with T much larger than all the masses and external momenta [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. Such hard thermal loop contributions determine th...|$|E

40|$|The {{relativity}} of simultaneity {{implies that}} the image of a Lorentz transformed (LT) spherical (circular) wavefront is not a spherical (circular) wavefront (Einstein 1905) but an ellipsoidal (elliptical) wavefront (Moreau, Am. J. of Phys). We show firstly that the relativity of simultaneity leads to the consequence {{that the image of}} a Lorentz transformed plane wavefront is a tangent plane to an ellipsoid and not a tangent plane to a sphere (Einstein 1905). We deduce then a longitudinal component of the tangent vector to Poincare's ellipse which is directly connected to the relativity of simultaneity. We suggest finally that this violation of relativity of simultaneity is related to Einstein's implicit choice of the (<b>non</b> relativistic) <b>transverse</b> gauge in his theory of (rigid) wavefronts.

40|$|A general {{framework}} {{has been developed}} for computing longitudinal and transverse beam impedances in accelerator pipes consisting of several coaxial tubes with <b>non</b> simple <b>transverse</b> geometry, possibly made of composite materials and/or bearing special features like e. g. holes or slots, based on the combined use of Lorentz reciprocity theorem, Debye potentials, extended impedance boundary conditions, and generalized trasmission line (waveguide) circuit concepts. The results are applied to the proposed LHC design. I. INTRODUCTION Rounded corners, multi-layered or composite walls, pumping holes, etc., make accelerator cross-sectional pipe geometries not simple. Beam coupling impedances must then computed by numerical methods, analytic solutions being available only for simple (transverse) geometries where, e. g., the Laplacian is separable, and simple (e. g., perfect conductor) boundary conditions. Analytic, even approximate, solutions {{on the other hand}} are relatively appealing, as they pr [...] ...|$|R

Considering a massive scalar field in a topological massless black hole background, which is non minimally coupled to the curvature and assuming the horizon geometry with a negative constant curvature. Mainly, we show that there is range of modes which contribute to the absorption cross section in the zero-frequency limit, at difference of the result existing in the literature. Where, the mode with lowest angular momentum contribute to the absorption cross section. Also we show that the condition that the sum of the reflection coefficient and the transmission coefficient is equal to one is always satisfied for these kind of black holes.

40|$|To {{limit the}} number of head on {{collisions}} to only one at the interaction point in the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), two beams are colliding with a non zero crossing angle. Under the presence of such angle the closed orbits of the individual bunches in the bunch train varies due to the long-range beam-beam effects. These variations leave a signature as a <b>non</b> zero <b>transverse</b> offset at the collision points visible in the front and trail of the bunch train. When operation team aims for the optimised beam orbit and therefore maximised luminosity, those front and tail bunches due to the overall offset experience reduced luminosity. This paper describes an overview of the existing tool for simulating these effects and compares to operational data. The effects of different operational scenarios (i. e. beam brightness, reduced or asymmetric crossing angles between the interaction points etc.) are simulated and discussed...|$|R
40|$|Welding {{distortion}} during welding {{leads to}} dimensional inaccuracies and misalignments of structural members. In the butt welded plates angular distortion is particularly more pronounced {{among the different}} types of distortions. <b>Non</b> uniform <b>transverse</b> shrinkage along the depth of the welded plates is the cause of angulardistortion. Distortion and residual stresses are largely opposed. Restriction of the angular distortion may lead to higher residual stresses. Prediction of angular distortion may help in reducing the distortion by providing initial angular distortion in the negative direction. Design of experiments (DOE) is a scientific approach of planning and conducting experiments to generate, analyze and interpretation of the data. In this study mathematical models were developed to predict angular distortion for a particular set of parameters. Using the mathematical equations trends of direct and indirect effects of the process variables on the angular distortion are presented in the graphical form and analyzed. This sensitively analysis helps in optimizing the welding process to improvethe quality and life of the welded parts...|$|R
40|$|In {{this work}} I {{develop a new}} {{framework}} for anisotropic hydrodynamics that generalizes the leading order of the hydrodynamic expansion to the full (3 + 1) -dimensional anisotropic massive case. Following previous works, my considerations {{are based on the}} Boltzmann kinetic equation with the collisional term treated in the relaxation time approximation. The momentum anisotropy is included explicitly in the leading term, allowing for a large difference between the longitudinal and transverse pressures as well as for <b>non</b> trivial <b>transverse</b> dynamics. Energy and momentum conservation is expressed by the first moment of the Boltzmann equation. The system of equations is closed by using the zeroth and second moments of the Boltzmann equation. The close-to-equilibrium matching with second-order viscous hydrodynamics is demonstrated. In particular, I show that the coupling between shear and bulk pressure corrections, recently proved to be important for an accurate description of momentum anisotropy and bulk viscous dynamics, does not vanish in the close-to-equilibrium limit...|$|R

Making a convenient reference to a widely used material -nematic liquid crystals-, we derive {{a new form of}} the discrete nonlinear Schrodinger equation and find a novel family of discrete solitons. Such self-localized solutions in optical lattices can exist with an arbitrary degree of imprinted chirp and a have breathing character. We verify numerically that both local and non local discrete light propagation and solitons can be observed in liquid crystalline arrays.

40|$|Impulsive {{gravitational}} plane waves, {{which have}} a delta-function singularity on a hypersurface, {{can be obtained by}} squeezing smooth plane gravitational waves with Gaussian profile. They exhibit (as do their smooth counterparts) the Velocity Memory Effect: after the wave has passed, particles initially at rest move apart with <b>non</b> vanishing constant <b>transverse</b> velocity. A new effect is that, unlike to the smooth case, (i) the velocities of particles originally at rest jump, (ii) the spacetime trajectories become discontinuous along the (lightlike) propagation direction of the wave.

40|$|The Vicario Viaduct {{is located}} in the A- 44 motorway, in the South-East part of Spain. It crosses a natural gorge, near the town of Ízbor in the {{province}} of Granada. A single continuous steel concrete composite deck, 24 m wide and 175 m long, divided in two 87, 5 m spans, has been built.

The steel parts of the deck were entirely constructed in the workshop and then they were erected on site just behind one of the abutments.

40|$|We {{show that}} the {{standing}} accretion shock instability (SASI) {{that has been used}} to ease the shock revival in core collapse supernovae (CCSNe) neutrino-driven explosion models, might play a much more decisive role in supplying the stochastic angular momentum required to trigger an explosion with jittering jets. We find that if the kinetic energy associated with the <b>transverse</b> (<b>non</b> radial) motion of the SASI is larger than about ten percent of the energy associated with the energy of the accreted gas, then the stochastic angular momentum can reach about five percent of the Keplerian specific angular momentum around the newly born neutron star. Such an accretion flow leaves an open conical region along the poles with an average opening angle of about 5 degrees. The outflow from the open polar regions powers an explosion according to the jittering-jets model. Comment: new versio...|$|R
40|$|We study {{periodic}} structures, such as vortex lattices, {{moving in}} a random potential. As predicted in [T. Giamarchi, P. Le Doussal Phys. Rev. Lett. 76 3408 (1996) ] the periodicity in the direction transverse to motion leads to {{a new class of}} driven systems: the Moving Glasses. We analyse using several RG techniques the properties at T= 0 and $T> 0 $: (i) decay of translational long range order (ii) particles flow along static channels (iii) the channel pattern is highly correlated (iv) barriers to transverse motion. We demonstrate the existence of the ``transverse critical force'' at T= 0. A ``static random force'' is shown to be generated by motion. Displacements grow logarithmically in $d= 3 $ and algebraically in $d= 2 $. The persistence of quasi long range translational order in $d= 3 $ at weak disorder, or large velocity leads to predict a topologically ordered ``Moving Bragg Glass''. This state continues the static Bragg glass and is stable at $T> 0 $, with <b>non</b> linear <b>transverse</b> response and linear asymptotic behavior. In $d= 2 $, or in $d= 3 $ at intermediate disorder, another moving glass exist (the Moving Transverse Glass) with smectic quasi order in the transverse direction. A phase diagram in $T$ force and disorder for static and moving structures is proposed. For correlated disorder we predict a ``moving Bose glass'' state with anisotropic transverse Meissner effect and transverse pinning. We discuss experimental consequences such as anomalous Hall effect in Wigner crystal and transverse critical current in vortex lattice. Comment: 74 pages, 27 figures, RevTe...|$|R
40|$|We have numerically {{studied the}} {{thermodynamic}} {{properties of the}} spin 1 / 2 XXZ chain {{in the presence of}} a <b>transverse</b> (<b>non</b> commuting) magnetic field. The thermal, field dependence of specific heat and correlation functions for chains up to 20 sites have been calculated. The area where the specific heat decays exponentially is considered as a measure of the energy gap. We have also obtained the exchange interaction between chains in a bulk material using the random phase approximation and derived the phase diagram of the three dimensional material with this approximation. The behavior of the structure factor at different momenta verifies the antiferromagnetic long range order in y-direction for the three dimensional case. Moreover, we have concluded that the Low Temperature Lanczos results [M. Aichhorn et al., Phys. Rev. B 67, 161103 (R) (2003) ] are more accurate for low temperatures and closer to the full diagonalization ones than the results of Finite Temperature Lanczos Method [J. Jaklic and P. Prelovsek, Phys.
