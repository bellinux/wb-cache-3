In the present study, Froude-scaled flume experiments were used to investigate how changes in vegetation density (ratio of frontal area to channel area, including both stems and leaves) and bank surface angle influence <b>near-bank</b> turbulence intensities (RMS[subscript u,v,w]) and Reynolds stresses (τ[subscript uv] and τ[subscript uw]) estimated using velocities obtained with an acoustic Doppler velocimeter positioned beneath the canopy. Results illustrate how, with increasing vegetation density, turbulence intensities and Reynolds stresses decreased along the sloped bank surface but increased {{at the base of the}} slope and within the main channel. The steeper bank angle resulted in greater vertical stresses on the bank surface than the shallower angle, but lateral momentum exchange was larger than vertical exchange along the base of the slope, regardless of bank angle. Leaves were an important influence on <b>near-bank</b> turbulence intensities and Reynolds stresses, while the influence of bank slope was small relative to the influence of vegetation density...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Accelerated {{streambank}} erosion {{is a major}} cause of non-point source pollution associated with increased sediment supply. A quantitative prediction of {{streambank erosion}} rate provides a tool to apportion sediment contribution of streambank sediment source to the total load transported by a river. A method for developing quantitative prediction of streambank erosion rates and examples of its implementation are presented. The prediction model presented utilizes a rational estimation, process-integration approach. A streambank erodibility index and calculated <b>near-bank</b> stresses are utilized in the prediction model. Streambank characteristics involving measurements of bank heights, angles, materials, presence of layers, rooting depth, rooting density and per cent of bank protection, are used to develop the streambank erodibility index. Measured data are converted to a normalization index for application {{for a wide range of}} channel sizes and types. <b>Near-bank</b> stress requires calculation of vertical velocity profiles and shear stress for subsequent distribution of energy calculations in the <b>near-bank</b> region. The measured field values, converted to prediction indices, were tested against measured annual streambank erosion rates. The results of an analysis of variance performed on two independent data sets from two varied hydro-physiographic regions indicated a highly significant relation. Application in regions other than those used to develop the relations are also presented. Applications in river and riparian management, stream channel stability analysis, streambank stabilization programs, river restoration, and sediment studies are presented. This model was also used to compare geologic erosion with anthropogenic sources and the consequence of riparian vegetation changes on streambank erosion rates. The model has particular advantages when used for stream channel stability departure analysis and sediment TMDL's...|$|E
40|$|A simple {{mathematical}} model for the simulation of river meandering processes is presented and analysed. The model is schematized as follows: computation of steady-state flow field and riverbed topography; and computation of bank erosion rate {{as a function of}} the <b>near-bank</b> hydraulic and morphological properties. The model is linear for the prediction of flow field and river bed topography, while geometrical non-linearities arise from the bank erosion equation. The flow and river bed model is derived by fully coupling flow field, bed topography and sediment transport and it (roughly) accounts for the secondary flow momentum convection.

40|$|Due to the {{relatively}} high computational costs related {{to the use of}} 2 D models {{the purpose of this study}} was to develop a one-dimensional mathematical model that can give a fair estimation of the <b>near-bank</b> deformation and the bedtopography in meandering rivers. The bedtopography is characterized by a point bar-pool configuration that can also be reproduced by the MEANDER model that is presented here. The basic flow and sediment equations are elaborated into two systems of ordinary differential equations using an asymptotic series of trigoniometric functions that describes the transverse bed profile. Each system represents the odd and even terms of this series. The unknown parameters are the amplitudes at the banks of each term. These amplitudes are solved numerically in longitudinal direction and time. The model is applied on the Mekong river at the border of Thailand and Laos, between Vientiane and Nong Khai. Due to a lack of sufficient data the model is not yet tested thoroughly. Hydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E
40|$|The {{three-dimensional}} {{flow field}} near the banks of alluvial channels is the primary factor controlling rates of bank erosion. Although submerged slump blocks and associated large-scale bank roughness elements have both previously been proposed to divert flow away from the bank, direct observations {{of the interaction between}} eroded bank material and the 3 -D flow field are lacking. Here we use observations from multibeam echo sounding, terrestrial laser scanning, and acoustic Doppler current profiling to quantify, for the first time, the influence of submerged slump blocks on the <b>near-bank</b> flow field. In contrast to previous research emphasizing their influence on flow diversion away from the bank, we show that slump blocks may also deflect flow onto the bank, thereby increasing local shear stresses and rates of erosion. We use our measurements to propose a conceptual model for how submerged slump blocks interact with the flow field to modulate bank erosion. UK Natural Environment Research Council (NERC...|$|E
40|$|Measurements from a fixed-bed, Froude-scaled {{hydraulic}} {{model of a}} stream in northeastern Vermont demonstrate the importance of forested riparian vegetation effects on <b>near-bank</b> turbulence during overbank flows. Sections of the prototype stream, a tributary to Sleepers River, have increased in channel width within the last 40 years in response to passive refor-estation of its riparian zone. Previous research found that reaches of small streams with forested riparian zones are commonly wider than adjacent reaches with non-forested, or grassy, vegetation; however, driving mechanisms for this morphologic difference are not fully explained. Flume experiments were performed with a 1 : 5 scale, simplified model of half a channel and its floodplain, mimicking the typical non-forested channel size. Two types of riparian vegetation {{were placed on the}} constructed floodplain: non-forested, with synthetic grass carpeting; and forested, where rigid, randomly distributed, wooden dowels were added.

40|$|In highly curved river bends, flow may {{separate}} at {{the inner}} bank {{to create a}} recirculation eddy with weak upstream flow. Very {{little is known about}} how recirculation eddies connect with the downstream flow or how the latter is affected by their presence. We investigate these questions using three-dimensional time-averaged computational fluid dynamics models of two natural bends with inner-bank separation. Test measurements of velocity in one bend agree well with the simulation. Common points in the two simulations are that (1) an outer-bank helix is only present in the upstream part of the bend, (2) maximum <b>near-bank</b> velocities are highest here rather than beyond the apex as in most bends, (3) reverse flow extends farther across the channel at the surface than the bed, and (4) flow within the recirculation eddy has a three-dimensional structure, linked with that in the outer-bank free stream. Substantial differences in detail between the two bends appear to be due to differences in upstream planform, manifested through the lateral distribution of inflow velocity...|$|E
40|$|Shoreline {{detection}} {{plays an}} important role in vision based navigation for autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs). It is a challenging task because of the diversity in <b>near-bank</b> scenarios. In this paper, we present a two-stage algorithm to find the shoreline by employing multiple features. First, we classify images into two types: reflection-unidentifiable and reflection-identifiable. Based on this classification, images are further analyzed with suitable techniques respectively. In the reflection-unidentifiable case, the surface reflection is subtle and so the water region can be separated from land by an adaptive thresholding method. The points along the edge of the water region are then identified and the shoreline is estimated through a line-fitting technique. In the reflection-identifiable case, we aim to discriminate water regions from the land by means of a two-category region classifier. Images are oversegmented into small regions based on color homogeneity. Then the characteristic features of land-water scenes like symmetry and brightness are extracted and applied to classify a region into land or water categories. Experimental results show the efficacy of our approach and robustness in diverse situations. 1...|$|E
40|$|Streambank erosion {{is known}} to be a major source of {{sediment}} in streams and rivers. The Bank Stability and Toe Erosion Model (BSTEM) was developed in order to predict streambank retreat due to both fluvial erosion and geotechnical failure. However, few, if any, model evaluations using long-term streambank retreat data have been performed. The objectives of this research were to (1) monitor long-term composite streambank retreat during a hydraulically active period on a rapidly migrating stream, (2) evaluate BSTEM’s ability to predict the measured streambank retreat, and (3) assess the importance of accurate geotechnical, fluvial erosion, and <b>near-bank</b> pore-water pressure properties. The Barren Fork Creek in northeastern Oklahoma laterally eroded 7. 8 to 20. 9 m along a 100 -m length of stream between April and October 2009 based on regular bank location surveys. The most significant lateral retreat occurred in mid- to late-May and September due to a series of storm events, and not necessarily the most extreme events observed during the monitoring period. BSTEM (version 5. 2) was not originally programmed to run multiple hydrographs iteratively, so a subroutine was written that automatically input the temporal sequence of stream stage and to lag the water table in the <b>near-bank</b> ground water depending on user settings. Eight BSTEM simulations of the Barren Fork Creek streambank were performed using combinations of the following input data: with and without a water table lag; default BSTEM geotechnical parameters (moderate silt loam) versus laboratory measured geotechnical parameters based on direct shear tests on saturated soil samples; and default BSTEM fluvial erosion parameters versus field measured fluvial erosion parameters from submerged jet tests. Using default BSTEM input values underestimated the actual erosion that occurred. Lagging the water table predicted more geotechnical failures resulting in greater streambank retreat. Using measured fluvial and geotechnical parameters and a water table lag also under predicted retreat (approximately 3. 3 m), but did predict the appropriate timing of streambank collapses. The under prediction of retreat was hypothesized to be due to over predicting the critical shear stress of the non-cohesive gravel, under predicting the erodibility of the non-cohesive gravel, and/or under predicting the imposed shear stress acting on the streambank. Current research improving our understanding of shear stress distributions, streambank pore-water pressure dynamics, and methods for estimating excess shear stress parameters for noncohesive soils will be critical for improving BSTEM and other streambank stability models...|$|E
40|$|Although {{many studies}} {{regarding}} bank erosion  and accretion {{can be found}} in the literature, it is  not common to find works studying the interaction  between opposite banks. Some existing  morphodynamic models describe bank erosion as  an event that depends on <b>near-bank</b> flow and bed  topography, as well as on eroding bank  properties.

40|$|A {{three part}} {{investigation}} into the effects of riparian reforestation on small streams demonstrated the timing, nature, and processes of morphologic change. First, measurements of two small streams in northeastern Vermont collected in 1966 and 2004 – 2005 documented considerable change in channel width following a period of passive reforestation. Channel widths of several tributaries to Sleepers River were measured in 1966 when the area had more non-forested riparian vegetation than today. A longitudinal survey in 2004 of two of these tributaries, followed by detailed measurements at specific reaches in 2005, provided information on channel size, large woody debris (LWD), and riparian vegetation. Reforested reaches have widened and incised markedly since 1966. Reaches with the oldest forest were widest for a given drainage area, and the non-forested reaches were substantially narrower. A conceptual model was developed that describes a multi-phase process of incision, widening, and recovery following riparian reforestation of non-forested areas. Second, a fixed-bed hydraulic model {{of one of the}} streams was developed to evaluate the impact of forested riparian vegetation on <b>near-bank</b> turbulence during overbank flows. Flume experiments with kinematic similitude and a 1 : 5 scale represented half a channel and its floodplain, mimicking the size of a non-forested reach. Two types of vegetation were simulated: non-forested, with synthetic grass carpet; and forested, where wooden dowels were added. Three-dimensional velocities were measured with an acoustic Doppler velocimeter. Velocities, turbulent kinetic energy (TKE), and Reynolds shear stress showed significant differences between forested and non-forested runs. Forested runs exhibited a narrow band of high TKE in the <b>near-bank</b> region that was roughly two times greater than in non-forested runs. Hydraulic characteristics of forested runs appear to create an environment with higher erosion potential, thereby indicating a possible driving mechanism for channel widening in reforesting stream reaches. Third, Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data from Chittenden County were analyzed to develop a method capable of classifying riparian buffers into broad classes according to forest type and age. The geospatial characteristics of the LiDAR data in forested areas were explored using semivariogram analysis, and LiDAR-based metrics were derived in a geographic information system (GIS) to quantify vegetation height and variance. The LiDAR-based metrics were then used in two discriminant analysis procedures that distinguished: 1) forest type as deciduous or coniferous; and 2) forest age in four age classes. With the resulting linear discriminant functions, a GIS-based classification method was developed. The classification method was highly successful at determining forest type but only moderately successful at determining forest age...|$|E
40|$|Bank erosion is {{incorporated}} in one-dimensional and two-dimensional horizontal models for river morphology. The banks are assumed to consist of a fraction of cohesive material, which becomes washload after being eroded, and a fraction of granular material, with the same properties as the material of the bed. The banks are taken to be eroded by discharge flow causing lateral entrainment of lower parts of the banks and <b>near-bank</b> bed degradation, both inducing mass failure of upper parts of the banks. Theoretical analyses are performed in order to reveal the influence of bank erosion on the morphological system. From an analysis of characteristics of the one-dimensional model it is concluded that generally river widths cannot be stabilized by protecting certain carefully chosen bank section~ only, and that computations of river planimetry can be decoupled from the computations of flow and bed topography. A linear analysis of the one-dimensional model is used to clarify the interactions between bank and bed disturbances, whereas a linear analysis of the twodimensional model is used {{to demonstrate that the}} input of bank erosion products decreases transverse bed slopes, but hardly influences the wave lengths and damping lengths of flow and bed topography in natural rivers with moderately migrating banks.

During I 997 and 1998 {{in a study}} near Fairbanks, Alaska U. S. A. the hydrologic conditions in the Chena River and in the adjacent groundwater were monitored. The river stage, groundwater elevations, and the water chemistry and temperature in both river and groundwater were measured. In the spring of 1997, the groundwater gradient close to the Chena River reversed causing surface water to enter the aquifer.

The properties of money-demand equations for these aggregates, particularly their temporal stability, are also examined. The major aggregates considered are M 1, M 2, M 3, M 2 +, and their Fisher ideal counterparts. Also considered are M 3 + (which adds <b>near-bank</b> deposits to M 3) and two liquidity aggregates, {{as well as their}} Fisher ideal counterparts. Over all, {{on the basis of the}} in-sample fit of indicator models, the out-of-sample forecasts by indicator models, the specification of money-demand functions, and the temporal stability of money-demand functions, Canadian simple-sum monetary aggregates appear to be empirically superior to Fisher ideal aggregates. Specifically, broad monetary aggregates are generally the best in predicting inflation, M 1 works well in predicting nominal spending, and real M 1 is the best predictor of real output. These conclusions generally agree with earlier studies, which have shown that weighted monetary aggregates rarely do better than simple-sum aggregates in predicting major Canadian macroeconomic variables. ...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{reports on}} phases 1 and 2 (Matsuura and Townsend, 2004 a, 2004 b, 2004 c) {{of an ongoing}} {{laboratory}} study of a novel form of streambank protection structure. 'Barbs' are groin-like structures {{designed to protect the}} (usually unstable) outside-bank regions of channel bends by actively redirecting flow away from the outside-bank. These low-profile, rock-fill structures have trapezoidal-shaped cross-sections and point upstream into the direction of flow. Their overall length typically extends one-quarter way across the channel, and are comprised of 'key' and 'weir' sections. The former, which is set back into the channel bank material, slopes downwards at 1 V: 1. 5 H to meet the low-profile weir section that extends into the stream. The crest of the weir section, the 'key' end of which should not exceed the channel-forming flow level (typically taken as the 1. 5 -year flow event), should have a mild positive slope (< 1 V: 5 H) towards the 'stream' end for proper operation, (USDA 1999). By disrupting <b>near-bank</b> velocity gradients, barbs promote sediment deposition along the eroding outside-bank region. Their presence also modifies the bend's 'helicoidal'-type flow pattern such that secondary currents, that would otherwise attack the outside-bank, are redirected towards the center of the channel.

To determine the potential effects of the surface water contamination on the microbial community composition, surface stream sediments were collected 7 times during the year, from 5 contaminated locations and 1 control stream. Fifty-nine samples were analyzed for bacterial community composition and geochemistry. Community characterization was based on GS 454 FLX pyrosequencing with 235 Mb of 16 S rRNA gene sequence targeting the V 4 region. Sorting and filtering of the raw reads resulted in 588, 699 high-quality sequences with lengths of > 200 bp.

Detailed field studies of compound meander loops, or elongate bends with multiple arcs of curvature, are rare.

40|$|Stream {{temperature}} {{is an important}} water quality indicator, particularly in the Pacific Northwest where endangered fish populations are sensitive to elevated water temperature. Regional assessment of stream temperatures from the ground is limited by sparse sampling of temperatures in both space and time. Remotely sensed thermal infrared (TIR) images {{can be used to}} derive spatially distributed estimates of the radiant skin temperature of streams. Even for fully resolved streams, however, our limited ability to compensate for atmospheric and emissivity effects constrains the accuracy of stream temperature measurements. When the stream is not fully resolved, it is the effect of mixed image pixels and thermal scattering from the <b>near-bank</b> environment that dominates both the accuracy and uncertainty of stream temperature measurements. Whereas airborne thermal sensors can resolve smaller streams than spaceborne sensors, their limited spatial coverage and cost makes satellite-derived TIR data an attractive option. We examine the accuracy and uncertainty associated with recovered stream temperatures for a range of stream sizes and pixel resolutions, using remotely sensed airborne (MASTER) and satellite (ASTER, LANDSAT-TM) TIR measurements. We find that when the stream width is resolved by fewer than 3 pixels, the accuracy of TIR measurements significantly decreases, and the uncertainty is greater, largely due to the reduction of mixed pixels (bank and stream). This limits the use of satellite TIR to temperature recovery for large rivers (currently, ~ 180 m stream widths with Landsat- TM) ...|$|E
40|$|Flow {{processes}} {{near the}} (concave) outer bank in curved river reaches are investigated {{in a laboratory}} flume, with focus {{on the influence of}} the bank roughness. An outer-bank cell of reversed secondary flow occurs for all the investigated roughness configurations of the outer bank. The cell widens the outer-bank boundary layer, which reduces the flow forcing on the bank, but also advects high-momentum fluid toward {{the lower part of the}} bank, which enhances the flow forcing on the bank. Increasing the roughness of the outer bank causes a considerable widening and strengthening of the outer-bank cell, which amplifies both effects on the flow forcing. The widening of the outer-bank boundary layer induced by the outer-bank cell reduces the effective width of the channel, i. e., the width where most of the discharge is conveyed, which increases significantly the sediment transport capacity in the central part of the channel. The <b>near-bank</b> processes are qualitatively similar but show considerable quantitative variations around the bend. The outer-bank cell reaches its maximum strength in the zone that is most vulnerable to bed scour and bank erosion, which corroborates its morphological relevance. The outer cell is mainly generated by reversed near-surface gradients in the profile of the streamwise velocity. The anisotropy of the cross-stream turbulence is the major mechanism opposed to the outer-bank cell. Increasing roughness of the outer bank amplifies all dominant mechanisms but does not modify their relative importance.

Samples were taken in the "lacustrine" zone of the reservoir near the dam, and also at 12 stations distributed in the middle and the lateral regions of the channel of the Paranapanema River downstream from the dam. The following species of Cyclopoida were found at the sites: Thermocyclops decipiens, Thermocyclops minutus, Paracyclops sp., Tropocyclops sp and Mesocyclops sp., and of Calanoida: Argyrodiaptomus furcatus, Notodiaptomus iheringi and Notodiaptomus conifer. In the reservoir sampling station, the copepod abundance during the dry and rainy seasons corresponded to 41 and 51 % of the total zooplankton, respectively. This difference could be related to the rainfall and water level variations, and especially to the influence of variables such as water temperature, dissolved oxygen and chlorophyll-a contents. No significant differences in organism numbers were recorded among samples of zooplankton taken in the middle and <b>near-bank</b> parts of the river. In relation to longitudinal variation in the Paranapanema River stretch, a significant decrease in density and disappearance of some species were recorded 11 km downstream of the dam during the dry season. At the stations 32 km from the dam, a drastic reduction in copepod abundance was observed in the rainy season.

40|$|Streambank seeps {{commonly}} {{originate from}} localized heterogeneity or preferential flow pathways (PFPs) in riparian floodplains. However, limited field data {{have been reported}} on ground water seep flows and solute transport to seeps from PFPs. The objective {{of this research was}} to build upon previous floodplain-scale investigations of PFPs by analyzing seep discharge and transport characteristics through a single PFP. An important research question was whether this PFP could be conceptualized as a homogeneous, one-dimensional flow path. Streambank seep discharge measurements were obtained by inducing a hydraulic head in a trench injection system. Also, co-injection of Rhodamine WT (RhWT) and a potassium chloride (KCl) tracer over a 60 -min period was used to investigate transport dynamics. Seep discharge and breakthrough curves for electrical conductivity (EC) and RhWT were measured at the streambank using a lateral flow collection device. The breakthrough curves were fit to one-dimensional convective-dispersion equations (CDEs) to inversely estimate solute transport parameters. The PFP from which the seep originated was clean, coarse gravel (6 % by mass less than 2. 0 mm) surrounded by gravel with finer particles (20 % by mass less than 2. 0 mm). Located approximately 2 m from the trench, the seep (50 cm by 10 cm area) required at least 40 cm of hydraulic head for flow to emerge at the streambank. At a higher hydraulic head of 125 cm, seep discharge peaked at 3. 5 L/min. This research verified that localized PFPs can result in the rapid transport of water (hydraulic conductivity on the order of 400 m/d) and solutes once reaching a sufficient <b>near-bank</b> hydraulic head. A one-dimensional equilibrium CDE was capable of simulating the EC (R 2 = 0. 94) and RhWT (R 2 = 0. 91) breakthrough curves with minimal RhWT sorption (distribution coefficient, Kd, equal to 0. 1 cm 3 /g). Therefore, the PFP could be conceptualized as a one-dimensional, homogenous flow and transport pathway.

40|$|Channel {{straightening}} and dredging were extensively {{used in the}} 20 th {{century to}} enhance agricultural drainage and facilitate crop maintenance and harvest. Although the adverse geomorphological and ecological effects of channelization are widely acknowledged, the use of alternative management strategies remains marginal in Southwestern Québec. Bank stabilisation projects are often carried out to mitigate local erosion problems with little assessment of their effects at the reach and watershed scales and with insufficient guidance on suitable designs. The objective {{of this research is}} to assess the impacts of various management strategies by studying a case of straightened agricultural stream. Field measurements in the Richer stream, which drains a small agricultural watershed in the St. Lawrence Lowlands, were used to parameterise a hydro-morphological model at the watershed scale and a 3 D computational fluid dynamics model at the reach scale. The increase in stream power associated with the loss in sinuosity since the 1930 s has resulted in noteworthy erosion problems in the studied watershed, in particular near residential development where there is limited space available to establish riparian strips. The tested management strategies at the watershed scale are the recreation of meanders and the installation of backwater ponds whereas, at the reach scale, stream barbs and bed weirs are tested. These management strategies are also assessed through a cost-benefit analysis which also takes into account environmental and practical implementation aspects. Results indicate that both the addition of ponds and re-meandering can markedly reduce unit stream power, thus the potential for erosion. Hydraulic structures such as stream barbs and V-shaped bed weirs re-align the flow towards channel centre, thus reducing <b>near-bank</b> velocities. The re-meandering approach involving natural vegetation regeneration has the highest overall effectiveness at the watershed scale whilst V-shaped weirs are found to be moderately effective at the reach scale. The diversification of flow conditions and channel morphologies associated with these approaches were important factors contributing to their higher suitability compared to other potential solutions. The modelling methodology used in this study can help limit the uncertainty surrounding restoration activities by better predicting the efficiency of proposed stabilisation techniques prior to their implementation while considering specific stream and watershed characteristics as well as ecological factors...|$|E

The methods developed here can, however, be applied to the broader context of meandering channels. The report consists of two parts. The first part is devoted to an experimental study of the problem. The process of bank erosion of coarse material is first studied. The channel is allowed to erode until such point as a stable equilibrium is attained. Such experiments provide a baseline against which to test the effectiveness of various means of bank protection. The type of bank protection studied falls under the category of distributed drag. Such methods use timber-pile permeable dikes, jacks, jetties, or trees in conjunction with the Palmiter method to slow the flow down {{in the vicinity of the}} bank. In the present study, screens similar to permeable dikes were used to accomplish this. It was shown that a sufficient density of distributed drag elements can substantially slow or stop bank erosion. When fine, suspendable material was added to the water, this material tended to settle out preferentially in the <b>near-bank</b> field of retarded velocity due to distributed drag. As a result, not only could bank erosion be prevented, but eroded banks could be reconstructed by means of deposition from suspension. The second part of the study was devoted to a theoretical and numerical model of bank erosion and its prevention, in parallel with the experiments. The theory is based on a description of bedload transport on side slopes up to the angle of repose. The Finite Element Method was used to model the flow and sediment transport field, as well as describe the time evolution of the channel. At present, the model has proved successful in describing the process of bank erosion documented in the experiments. Numerical work continues on the subject of bank protection by means of distributed drag. Legislative Commission on Minnesota Resource...|$|E
40|$|Excessive {{sediment}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} common surface water pollutants. It diminishes water quality and destroys aquatic habitat. Streambank erosion is known to be a major source of sediment in streams and rivers, contributing as much as 80 % of the total sediment load in some watersheds. Little work has been done to study the effects of seepage on streambank erosion and failure. Prior research, primarily in the laboratory under well-defined and controlled conditions, has examined seepage as a mechanism for bank erosion, but more needs to be done to validate conclusions derived from the laboratory with field data. This project studied a streambank on Dry Creek (a tributary to Little Topashaw Creek) located in Chickasaw County, Mississippi. The bank was previously observed to produce seepage even during dry summer months. This creek is a deeply incised stream in the Yalobusha Watershed with near 90 degree banks. The creek flows through alluvial plains under cultivation and surrounded by forested areas. Excess sediment has been identified as the main water quality issue in the watershed with gullies and banks being the main sources. Watershed geology is characterized by silt loam and clay loam with a more conductive loamy sand between the loam and an underlying cohesive layer. The site was initially instrumented with a network of tensiometers and observation wells. Groundwater conditions and bank erosion were monitored for several weeks, followed by an induced seepage experiment. A trench installed 2. 8 m from the edge of the bank and approximately 2 m below ground surface was used to provide a constant head for groundwater flow in the <b>near-bank</b> area. The bank face was outfitted with a seepage collection device that measured seepage flow rate and sediment transport. Groundwater conditions were again monitored by the tensiometer and observation well network. Experiments consisted of a trench injection at a constant head and observations of flow rates, erosion rates, soilwater pressures, and water table elevations. Flow rates varied from 0. 004 L/min to 1. 16 L/min at different locations on the bank. It was observed that the seeps experienced ‘self-healing’ erosion in which upper layer cohesive soil failures blocked further particle mobilization. One experiment simulated fluvial erosion removing the failed material, thereby, resulting in combined erosion rates of over 6000 g/min. Seepage erosion could be a dominate mechanism of streambank failure where the self-healing process is not occurring...|$|E
40|$|River bank erosion {{models are}} a {{fundamental}} requirement {{for understanding the}} migration and evolution of river meanders, estimating the potential for land-loss and threat to floodplain infrastructure, and predicting the delivery of contaminated floodplain sediments to aquatic ecosystems. While progress has recently been made in understanding and modelling processes controlling large-scale mass failure, less {{attention has been paid}} to the role that fluvial erosion plays in bank retreat. This project aims to address this gap by developing a new fluvial erosion model. Recent developments in bank erosion monitoring technology, and in the quantification of the bank erodibility parameters using jet-testing devices, offer the means of determining fluvial erosion rates and bank erodibility. However, the missing link remains the need to obtain highresolution, spatially distributed, flow data to characterize the <b>near-bank</b> fluid shear stresses that drive bank erosion. One possible solution is to use Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) models as a substitute for empirical data. Herein I evaluate a series of three-dimensional CFD simulations for a meander loop on the River Asker at Bridport in southern England. CFD models under specific steady peak flow conditions were developed using Fluent 6. 2, with peak flow discharge estimates obtained from an adjacent gauging station. All the models obtained from the three examined flow events were successfully verified and validated using clearly defined and structured procedures. The modelling results indicated that the main qualitative features of the flow remain even as flow discharge varies. However, notable differences were observed between the examined flow events, such as, a general increasing of velocity and shear stress throughout the reach as flow stage is gradually increased, a slight reduction in the size and extent of separation zones at bank full stage, a movement of impingement points further downstream, and a continuation of the secondary flow within the fast streamtube further towards the bends exits. Bed/bank shear stress is mostly seen to decrease at shallow riffles as discharge approaches bankfull, while pools experience an increase in bed/bank shear stress with increase in discharge. Zones of higher bed/bank shear stress extend and combine, while marginal recirculation zones and areas of relatively low bed/bank shear stress generally reduce in area to form discrete locations for erosion and deposition phenomena. At bank full stage, the magnitudes of velocity and simulated shear stresses within the inner bank separation zones are found to be higher than those observed under low flow conditions and they may be sufficient to result in the removal of accumulated sediments into the main downstream flow. The presence of regions of high velocity in the form of a streamtube, especially along the outer banks, creates high shear stresses within these areas. As a result, outer bank migration rates are likely to be relatively high in bends with inner bank separation zones. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

MooreExcess {{sediment}} is {{a leading}} cause of stream impairment in the United States, resulting in poor water quality, sedimentation of downstream waterbodies, and damage to aquatic ecosystems. Numerous case studies have found that accelerated bank erosion can be the main contributor of sediment in impaired streams. An empirically-derived "Bank Assessment for Non-Point Source Consequences of Sediment" (BANCS) model can be developed for a specific hydrophysiographic region to rapidly estimate sediment yield from streambank erosion, based on both physical and observational measurements of a streambank. This study aims to address model criticisms by (1) evaluating the model’s repeatability and sensitivity and (2) examining the developmental process of a BANCS model by attempting to create an annual streambank erosion rate prediction curve for the Central Great Plains ecoregion. To conduct the repeatability and sensitivity analysis of the BANCS model, ten stream professionals with experience utilizing the model individually evaluated the same six streambanks twice in the summer of 2015. To determine the model’s repeatability, individual streambank evaluations, as well as groups of evaluations based on level of Rosgen course training, were compared utilizing Kendall’s coefficient of concordance and a linear model with a randomized complete block design. Additionally, a one-at-a-time design approach was implemented to test sensitivity of model inputs. Statistical analysis of individual streambank evaluations suggests that the implementation of the BANCS model may not be repeatable. This may be due to highly sensitive model inputs, such as streambank height and <b>near-bank</b> stress method selection, and/or highly uncertain model inputs, such as bank material. Furthermore, it was found that higher level of training may improve model implementation precision. In addition to the repeatability and sensitivity analysis, the BANCS model developmental process was examined through the creation of a provisional streambank erosion rate prediction curve for the Central Great Plains ecoregion. Streambank erosion data was collected sporadically from 2006 to 2016 from eighteen study banks within the sediment-impaired Little Arkansas River watershed of south-central Kansas. Model fit was observed to follow the same trends, but with greater dispersion, when compared to other created models throughout the United States and eastern India. This increase in variability could be due to (1) obtaining streambank erosion data sporadically over a 10 -year period with variable streamflows, (2) BEHI/NBS ratings obtained only once in recent years, masking the spatiotemporal variability of streambank erosion, (3) lack of observations, and (4) use of both bank profiles and bank pin measurements to calculate average retreat rates. Based on the results of this study, a detailed model creation procedure was suggested that addresses several model limitations and criticisms. Recommendations provided in the methodology include (1) more accurate measurement of sensitive/uncertain BEHI/NBS parameters, (2) multiple assessments by trained professionals to obtain accurate and precise BEHI/NBS ratings, (3) the use of repeated bank profiles to calculate bank erosion rates, and (4) the development of flow-dependent curves based on annually assessed study banks. Subsequent studies should incorporate these findings to improve upon the suggested methodology and increase the predictive power of future BANCS models...|$|E
40|$|In {{this report}} a study {{is carried out}} on the Magdalena River {{near the village of}} San Pablo, Colombia. The Magdalena River near San Pablo {{experiences}} two major issues which are related to navigation and erosion. The major problem for inland navigation is the sharp bend of the Magdalena River at San Pablo, which has too small a radius, causing problems for navigation. Furthermore, there are some parts in the considered river reach where the water depth is insufficient according to the requirements for navigability. Regarding the erosion problem near San Pablo, the main driving force is assumed to be high flow velocities and large <b>near-bank</b> water depths due to spiral flow in the outer bend. The main flow passing by the river bank of San Pablo gradually takes soil particles away, resulting in a continuous erosion process. In addition, the developed steep slope and height of the river bank results in mass failure mechanisms, increasing the erosion problems even further in the future. Several possiblemeasures have been analysed to solve this navigational problem, such as river training works consisting of groynes, longitudinal dams and a spit, where the latter one consists of a land tongue and a longitudinal dam connected to it. Measures with an even bigger impact are also considered, such as a bend cut-off and a river bypass. There are several possible measures to solve the erosion problem, such as a revetment, groynes and geogrids. Both the navigability and erosion problem can be solved in an integral way by a combination of different measures. In this study five alternatives are proposed, which are groynes, a spit, longitudinal dams, a bend cut-off and a river bypass. With the help of a multi-criteria analysis the most promising alternatives have been selected, which showed the spit to be the best in terms of reducing erosion and increasing navigation possibilities. With the help of the Delft 3 D model the general up- and downstream consequences have been explored of the most promising alternatives. The large river training structures, such as longitudinal dams and a bend cut-off, do not result in the desired behaviour of the river reach. Therefore, it is not advised to completely restrict the river in its flow conditions since this in general leads to more difficulties as the restriction does not allow the river to get to its equilibrium within a short period of time. However, both the groynes and the spit pose fewer restrictions to the river flow and show large improvements of the current situation in terms of navigability and erosion. The groynes are especially successful in reducing erosion problems at the river bank of San Pablo. However, the spit is more effective in driving {{the main part of the}} flow through the current navigation channel, which results in a deeper and wider channel. Therefore, it is recommended to combine the spit and the groynes to obtain an integrated solution for both erosion and navigation problems. However, for both river training works, erosion problems are encountered downstream of San Pablo. This should be a major part of future research since problems should be solved instead of shifted up- or downstream. Water Management, Hydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E
