As a result, Banco de México has as its primary objective maintaining stability in the purchasing power of the peso.

50|$|During 1995-1998 {{monetary}} policy was highly expansionary. <b>Net</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>credit</b> of the National Bank of Belarus was increasing {{at the rate}} of over 100 percent from 1996 till mid-1998 as a consequence of numerous presidential decrees and resolution of the Council of Ministers instructing NBB to extend credits. Since no external sources were available for covering state budget deficit, the NBB emission activity provided its financing. Also, through authorized banks serving governmental programs, the NBB extended preferential targeted loans to state-owned enterprises. The list of credited enterprises is prepared by the government and sometimes depends on the ad-hoc strategies of development. In 2000, Belarus managed to unify its currency exchange rates, tightened its {{monetary policy}}, and partially liberalized the foreign currency market. Starting from the period of an administrative peg of the exchange rate of the Belarusian ruble in 1995, the monetary policy was based on administrative regulation of interest rates. In November 1995, administrative limitations of the inter-bank credit market activity were initiated and still remain in force. In spite of the Central Bank Law passed in 1994 guaranteeing its independence, President Lukashenko has a power to nominate and dismiss the Chairman of the NBB. and to formulate monetary and foreign exchange policy. Over the past years, preferential credits, administrative price setting, and decline of the interests rate spread below 15 percentage points {{in the second quarter of}} 1997 resulted in damaging consequences to enterprises and especially banks. As the process of exhaustion of the Central Bank's hard currency reserves exhibits a dangerous tendency, government introduced restrictions on currency transactions. These have resulted in inconvertibility of the Belarusian ruble for the current transactions since March 1998.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} analyzes theoretically and empirically {{the role}} of fiscal dominance as defined by Sargent and Wallace (1981) {{in the behavior of}} inflation, the real exchange rate, and the stock of net international reserves in developing countries with imperfect capital mobility and managed exchange rate regimes. We develop an open-economy AD-AS model that imposes the government intertemporal solvency constraint and incorporates the assumptions of a managed exchange rate regime with imperfect capital mobility. We test the empirical relevance of the fiscal dominance hypothesis for Colombia and Venezuela, estimating vector error-correction and unrestricted vector autoregression models with annual and quarterly data. Our hypothesis that under a managed exchange rate regime, fiscal dominance should imply a dynamic relationship between fiscal deficits and <b>net</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>credit</b> is not supported by the data. Using either the <b>net</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>credit</b> to trend output ratio or the logarithm of the monetary base to trend output ratio, we find for both countries that the fiscal dominance hypothesis receives, at best, weak support. Fiscal deficits and/or the rate of growth of the monetary base to trend output, however, have an important effect on the behavior of inflation, but not on the real exchange rate or the stock of net international reserves. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{response}} to the 1994 peso crisis, {{and as part of}} the U. S. -led relief package, Mexico committed its central bank to more frequent monetary disclosures. Starting March 21, 1995, Mexico’s central bank began weekly press releases concerning international reserve and tesobono levels, tesobono repurchase plans, and money supply and <b>net</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>credit.</b> The release of such critical monetary data should have beneficially helped resolve the peso crisis. Our results support such a role, in terms of reduced market volatility and asymmetric information concerns.

40|$|A {{commonly}} held {{view is that}} creation of excessive domestic credit may lead to inflation problems, however, many economists uphold the possibility that, generous domestic credit under appropriate conditions will result in increases of output. This hypothesis is examined for Japan and Colombia for the period 1950 - 1993. ^ Domestic credit theories are reviewed since the times of Thornton and Smith, until the recent times of Lewis, McKinnon, Stiglitz and of Japanese economists like K. Emi, Tachi R. and others. It is found that in Japan of the Post-War period, efficient financial markets and the decisive role {{of the government in}} orienting investment decisions seem to have influenced positively the effectiveness of domestic credit as an output-stimulating variable. On the contrary, in Colombia the absence of the above features seems to explain why domestic credit is not very effective as an output-stimulating variable. ^ Multiple regression analyses show that domestic credit is a strong explanatory variable for output increases in Japan and a weak one for Colombia 2 ̆ 7 s case in the studied period. For Japan the correlation depicts a positive relationship between the two variables with a decreasing rate very similar to a typical production function. Moreover, the positive decreasing rate is confirmed if <b>net</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>credit</b> is used in the correlations. For Colombia a positive relationship is also found when accumulated domestic credit is used, but, if <b>net</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>credit</b> is the source of correlations, the positive decreasing rate is not obtained. ^ Granger causality tests determined causality from domestic credit to output for Japan and no-causality for Colombia at the 1...|$|E
40|$|Before the 1980 s, Vietnam was {{modelled}} as a centrally-planned economy (CPE) {{along the}} same lines as the Soviet economy.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that in a small open economy where there is perfect {{substitutability}} between domestic and foreign assets and costless portfolio adjustment, the monetary authorities, pursuing an exchange-rate target, cannot control the money supply, but can influence the balance of payments through the use of <b>domestic</b> <b>credit.</b> It has been argued that <b>domestic</b> <b>credit</b> is therefore the relevant variable in output determination as well.
