2500|$|In {{elementary}} {{fluid mechanics}} utilizing ideal gases, a shock wave {{is treated as}} a discontinuity where entropy increases over a nearly infinitesimal region. [...] Since <b>no</b> <b>fluid</b> flow is discontinuous, a control volume is established around the shock wave, with the control surfaces that bound this volume parallel to the shock wave (with one surface on the pre-shock side of the fluid medium {{and one on the}} post-shock side). The two surfaces are separated by a very small depth such that the shock itself is entirely contained between them. At such control surfaces, momentum, mass flux and energy are constant; within combustion, detonations can be modelled as heat introduction across a shock wave. [...] It is assumed the system is adiabatic (no heat exits or enters the system) and no work is being done. [...] The Rankine–Hugoniot conditions arise from these considerations.|$|E

40|$|Results from {{petrographic}} analyses, {{chemical analyses}} and mineral phase diagram calculations show that staurolite minerals grew in selvages adjacent to quartz veins. Previous studies {{show the same}} relationships between quartz veins and garnet, as well as kyanite growth. The selvages are formed as metamorphic fluids flow through cracks, altering the bulk composition by mass transfer and triggers the nucleation and growth of new minerals. A pseudosection for a staurolite absent sample has been calculated using THERMOCALC. No stability field correlates to visually observed mineralogy. This indicates that a reaction forming staurolite never was triggered since <b>no</b> <b>fluids</b> was present during metamorphism...|$|R

Cars must also have two hydraulic brake circuits, full five-point racing harnesses, and must meet geometric templates for driver location in the cockpit for all drivers competing.
