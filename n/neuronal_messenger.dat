The activity of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate diaphorase (NADPH-d) was shown to be identical to NOS activity in the brain. Since the periaqueductal gray matter (PAG) plays an important role in pain perception and antinociception this study was carried out to monitor the expression of NADPH-d in PAG after nociceptive visceral stimulation. Our data showed that the noxious visceral stimulation significantly increased NADPH-d positive neurons and that these neurons were localized in the ventrolateral areas of the PAG. These findings suggest that NO in the PAG may play a role in pain modulation and antinociception...|$|E
40|$|AbstractCarbon {{monoxide}} (CO) is an activator of soluble guanylyl cyclase and is implicated as a <b>neuronal</b> <b>messenger.</b> CO production, {{nitric oxide}} synthase (NOS) activity, and guanosine 3 ′, 5 ′-monophosphate (cGMP) levels were quantitated in cerebellar granule cell cultures. Metabolic labeling experiments enabled the direct measurement of neuronal CO production in vitro. CO production is significant, and peaked during early stages of culture. NOS activity and cGMP levels synchronously increased as cells matured. Whereas inhibition of NOS depleted cGMP in mature cultures, inhibitors of CO production potentiated the nitric oxide (NO) -mediated cGMP increase. Exogenous CO at similar concentrations to endogenous levels blocked the NO-mediated cGMP increase. These results directly demonstrate that endogenous neuronal CO production is high and indicate that while NO is the major regulator of cGMP in these neurons, CO may modulate the NO–cGMP signaling system...|$|E
40|$|The sensory {{innervation}} of intracranial vessels {{originates in}} the trigeminal ganglion with calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), substance P (SP) and pituitary adenylate cyclase activating peptide (PACAP) as frequent <b>neuronal</b> <b>messengers.</b> The {{present study was}} designed to study the expression of these neuropeptides (a) in primary culture of adult rat trigeminal ganglion neuronal cells and (b) in organ culture of sections of the trigeminal ganglion. In cell culture, axons grow in the peripheral direction for up to 48 h. Immunocytochemistry revealed that the cell bodies showed increased expression of CGRP at 24 h and SP at 24 - 48 h (p 0. 05), but at 48 h (p 0. 05). In conclusion, neurons of rat trigeminal ganglia alter their expression of neuropeptides during cell and organ culture differently, but it is mainly the CGRP system that is up-regulated. We have compared two methods for future studies of underlying molecular mechanisms responsible for regulation of neuropeptide expression in the trigeminal system. (C) 2007 Elsevier B. V.

The majority of the nerve fibers found were sympathetic and displayed specific immunoreactivity for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and neuropeptide Y (NPY). Only few nerve fibers displayed vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and substance P (SP) immunoreactivity. In both arteries. the contractions induced by noradrenaline (NA), NPY and 5 -hydroxytryptarnine (5 -HT) and the relaxant responses induced by acetylcholine (ACh).

In conclusion. there was no major difference in innervation pattern or vasomotor sensitivity (pEC(50) and pIC(50) values) between the two vessels'. However. the general pattern indicates stronger vasomotor responses (E-max and I-max) in the PCA branches as compared to the lenticulostriate arteries which may lend support for the clinical observation of a difference in stroke expression between the two vascular areas.

40|$|Some {{amphibian}} brain-melanotrope {{cell systems}} {{are used to}} study how neuronal and (neuro) endocrine mechanisms convert environmental signals into physiological responses. Pituitary melanotropes release alpha-melanophore-stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH), which controls skin color in response to background light stimuli. Xenopus laevis suprachiasmatic neurons receive optic input and inhibit melanotrope activity by releasing neuropeptide Y (NPY), dopamine (DA) and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) when animals are placed on a light background. Under this condition, they strengthen their synaptic contacts with the melanotropes and enhance their secretory machinery by upregulating exocytosis-related proteins (e. g. SNAP- 25). The inhibitory transmitters converge on the adenylyl cyclase system, regulating Ca(2 +) channel activity. Other messengers like thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) and corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH, from the magnocellular nucleus), noradrenalin (from the locus coeruleus), serotonin (from the raphe nucleus) and acetylcholine (from the melanotropes themselves) stimulate melanotrope activity. Ca(2 +) enters the cell and the resulting Ca(2 +) oscillations trigger alpha-MSH secretion. These intracellular Ca(2 +) dynamics can be described by a mathematical model. The oscillations travel as a wave through the cytoplasm and enter the nucleus where they may induce the expression of genes involved in biosynthesis and processing (7 B 2, PC 2) of pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) and release (SNAP- 25, munc 18) of its end-products. We propose that various environmental factors (e. g. light and temperature) act via distinct brain centers in order to release various <b>neuronal</b> <b>messengers</b> that act on the melanotrope to control distinct subcellular events (e. g. hormone biosynthesis, processing and release) by specifically shaping the pattern of melanotrope Ca(2 +) oscillations...|$|R
40|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} (CO), produced endogenously by heme oxygenase, {{has been}} implicated as a <b>neuronal</b> <b>messenger.</b> Carotid bodies are sensory organs that regulate ventilation by responding to alterations of blood oxygen, CO 2, and pH.

Using immunocytochemistry, we demonstrate that heme oxygenase 2 is localized to glomus cells in the cat and rat carotid bodies. Physiological studies show that zinc protoporphyrin IX, a potent heme oxygenase inhibitor, markedly increases carotid body sensory activity, while copper protoporphyrin IX, which does not inhibit the enzyme, is inactive. Exogenous CO reverses the stimulatory effects of zinc protoporphyrin IX.

40|$|ANANDAMIDE (N-arachidonoyl-ethanolamine) was {{recently}} {{identified as a}} brain arachidonate derivative that binds to and activates cannabinoid receptors 1 - 4, yet the mechanisms underlying formation, release and inactivation of this putative messenger molecule are still unclear. Here we report that anandamide is produced in and released from cultured brain neurons in a calcium ion-dependent manner when the neurons are stimulated with membrane-depolarizing agents. Anandamide formation occurs through phos-phodiesterase-mediated cleavage of a novel phospholipid precursor, N-arachidonoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine. A similar mechanism also governs {{the formation of a}} family of anandamide congeners, whose possible roles in neuronal signalling remain unknown. Our results and those of others 5, 6 indicate therefore that multiple biochemical pathways may participate in anandamide formation in brain tissue. The life span of extracellular anandamide is limited by a rapid and selective process of cellular uptake, which is accompanied by hydrolytic degradation to ethanolamine and arachidonate. Our results thus strongly support the proposed role of anandamide as an endogenous <b>neuronal</b> <b>messenger.</b> © 2002 Nature Publishing Group...|$|E
40|$|The {{free radical}} gas nitric oxide (NO) is a {{recently}} identified <b>neuronal</b> <b>messenger</b> that carries out diverse signaling tasks {{in both the}} central and peripheral nervous systems. Whereas most neurotransmitters are packaged in synaptic vesicles and secreted in a Ca 2 +-dependent manner from specialized nerve endings, NO is an unconventional transmitter which is not packaged in vesicles, but rather diffuses from its site of production {{in the absence of}} any specialized release machinery. The lack of a requirement for release apparatus raises the possibility that NO can be released from both pre- and postsynaptic neuronal elements. In addition, because NO is gaseous and extremely membrane permeant, it can bypass normal signal transduction routes involving interactions with synaptic membrane receptors. Although the targets of NO have not yet been completely described, it is known that NO can bind to the iron contained in heine groups, leading to conformational changes in associated proteins, such as guanylyl cyclase...|$|E

40|$|We present {{evidence}} that direct activation of <b>neuronal</b> second <b>messenger</b> pathways in PC 12 cells by opening voltage-dependent calcium channels mimics {{cell adhesion molecule}} (CAM) -induced differentiation of these cells. PC 12 cells were cultured on monolayers of control 3 T 3 cells or 3 T 3 cells expressing transfected N-cadherin {{in the presence of}} KCl or a calcium channel agonist Bay K 8644. Both potassium depolarization and agonist-induced activation of calcium channels promoted substantial neurite outgrowth from PC 12 cells cultured on control 3 T 3 monolayers and increased neurite outgrowth from those cultured on N-cadherin- expressing 3 T 3 monolayers. The potassium-induced response could be inhibited by L- and N-type calcium channel antagonists and by kinase inhibitor K- 252 b but was unaffected by pertussis toxin. In contrast activators of protein kinase C did not stimulate neurite outgrowth, and the neurite outgrowth response induced by activation of protein kinase A was not inhibited by calcium channel antagonists or pertussis toxin. These studies support the postulate that CAM-induced neuronal differentiation involves a specific transmembrane signaling pathway and suggest that activation of this pathway after CAM binding may be more important for the neurite outgrowth response than CAM-dependent adhesion per se...|$|R
40|$|Extensive {{evidence}} suggests that long term memory (LTM) formation {{is dependent on the}} activation of <b>neuronal</b> second <b>messenger</b> systems and requires protein synthesis. The cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) is a constitutively expressed regulatory transcription factor that couples changes in second messenger levels to changes in cellular transcription. Several recent studies suggest that CREB and related transcription factors regulate gene expression necessary for neuronal plasticity and LTM. However, the role of CREB, within defined mammalian brain structures, in mediating the cellular events underlying LTM formation has not been investigated. We examined whether CREB-mediated transcription within the dorsal hippocampus is critical to LTM consolidation of water maze spatial training, which is known to depend on dorsal hippocampal function. Pretraining infusions of antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN) directed against CREB mRNA were used to disrupt hippocampal CREB protein levels in adult rats. Control groups received pretraining infusions of ODN of the same base composition but in a randomized order (scrambled ODN) or buffer. Task acquisition and memory up to 4 h (i. e., short term memory) were similar in CREB antisense ODN and control groups. In contrast, CREB antisense ODN-infused rats exhibited significantly impaired memory 48 h later (i. e., LTM). Moreover, administration of antisense ODN 1 day after training did not affect subsequent retention performance. These findings provide the first evidence that CREB-mediated transcription is integral to hippocampal-dependent memory consolidation processes...|$|R

Transfection of human kidney cells with NO synthase cDNA elicits NADPH diaphorase staining.

The degree of discoloration implies the extract’s scavenging potential, {{which is due to}} the ability of hydrogen donation [26]. Nitric oxide is a potent pleiotropic inhibitor of physiological processes and overproduction of nitric oxide manifest in various pathological conditions such as relaxation of smooth muscle, neuronal signaling, and regulation of cell-mediated cytotoxicity and inactivation of platelet aggregation [27]. Nitric oxide plays many roles as an effector molecule in several biological systems involving <b>neuronal</b> <b>messenger,</b> vasodilator [28]. In the quantitative assay, CRSM has shown better activity than CRSP in both case of DPPH free radical and NO scavenging capacity assay and is significant compared to the standard (ascorbic acid) (Table 3).

Materials and methods: We investigated the effect of the CGRP receptor antagonist, telcagepant, on CGRP-induced cranial vasodilatation in human isolated cerebral and middle meningeal arteries. We also studied the expression of the CGRP receptor components in cranial arteries with immunocytochemistry. Concentration response curves to aCGRP were performed in human isolated cerebral and middle meningeal arteries in the absence or presence of telcagepant. Arterial slices were stained for RAMP 1, CLR and actin in a double immunofluorescence staining. Results: In both arteries, we found that: (i) telcagepant was devoid of any contractile or relaxant effects per se; (ii) pretreatment with telcagepant antagonised the aCGRP-induced relaxation in a competitive manner; and (iii) immunohistochemistry revealed expression and co-localisation of CLR and RAMP 1 in the smooth muscle cells in the media layer of both arteries.

40|$|The {{gastrointestinal}} (GI) tract {{constitutes the}} largest mucosal surface that is continually {{exposed to a}} wide range of antigens and potential immune stimuli including various dietary antigens and commensal bacteria. For this reason, the intestinal mucosal tissue contains the largest number of immune cells participating to an elaborate network of cells and effector molecules to defend the host from the external milieu. In order to maintain homeostasis, the immune system has developed diverse regulatory strategies including additional non-immunological actors able to control the immune response. Defects in these immunological responses can lead to intestinal disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), encompassing Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis. Of note, organisms have evolved endogenous strategies in order to control immune response. The concept of an inflammatory reflex, in which the central nervous system responds to inflammatory stimuli and acts to limit inflammation, was clearly formulated by Tracey (174). This novel concept concerning the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway (CAIP) proposes that the vagus nerve plays a crucial role in the regulation of the immune response. This implies that a specific organ or region of the organism has its dedicated vagal innervation detecting activation of the innate immune system and providing integrated efferent vagal input to dampening the inflammatory response (174). Truthfully, vagotomy (VXG) significantly aggravated the development of septic shock and enhanced inflammation whereas electrical stimulation of the efferent vagus nerve prevented systemic inflammation (175). Moreover, our research group has provided evidence that the CAIP also modulates the intestinal immune system in a model of post-operative ileus (POI) in which the inflammation is located at the muscularis layer. In this thesis, we have investigated the participation of the neuro-endocrine factors, such as the vagus nerve and the gastrointestinal hormone, ghrelin, in the regulation of the intestinal immune system. First, we aim to better define the CAIP mechanism in the intestine. We demonstrated that vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is able to dampen intestinal muscular inflammation and prevent ileus via activation of the alpha 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α 7 nAChR). We provide evidence that the vagus nerve reduces local intestinal inflammation through a circuit that differs from that previously reported in models of systemic inflammation, i. e. independent of the spleen and T cells. Indeed, cholinergic nerve fibers arising from enteric neurons innervated by the vagus nerve modulate intestinal resident muscularis macrophages expressing α 7 nAChR. We therefore conclude that resident macrophages located within the intestinal muscularis are the ultimate target cell mediating the anti-inflammatory effect of VNS in POI (Chapter 3). Taking into consideration that immune tolerance to food antigens and to intestinal microflora is essential to preserve intestinal homeostasis and prevent chronic inflammation, we hypothesized that the vagal innervation of the gut can modulate intestinal immune mucosal homeostasis and not only dampening on-going local inflammation. Our findings clearly showed that the vagus nerve is essential for the development of mucosal immune homeostasis and induction of appropriate immune response during colitis even if this mechanism is independent of α 7 nAChR. VGX impairs the ability to develop oral tolerance and results in increased severity of dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) colitis however these effects are not observed in α 7 nAChR-deficient mice. Additionally, no role for α 7 nAChR could be proven (either on transferred T cells or in the recipient mice) in T cell transfer colitis. Therefore our data indicate that α 7 AChR does not play a crucial role in the anti-inflammatory cholinergic effect to the lamina propria but most likely other nicotinic receptors are participating to this pathway (Chapter 4). Together with the <b>neuronal</b> <b>messengers</b> able to affect the immune system, hormonal messengers have been recently discovered as potent immune-modulatory factors. Recent work suggests that the orexigenic hormone, ghrelin, has potent anti-inflammatory properties in a preclinical model of intestinal inflammation. Ghrelin is secreted predominantly from enteroendocrine cells of the stomach and acts as an appetite-regulating hormone increasing food intake and long-term regulation of body weight. Interestingly, the expression of this ghrelin receptor (GRLN-R) has been shown on innate and adaptive immune cells. However, the mechanism, by which ghrelin suppresses intestinal inflammation, is still unclear. Hence, we decided to investigate the effect of ghrelin on T cell function during colitis. In Chapter 5, we observed that the lack of ghrelin signalling in Th cells resulted in a significantly worsened colitis with increased colonic inflammation dependent on a pathological accumulation of CD 4 effector T cells in the lamina propria. In line, ghrelin directly affected proliferation of Th cells and induced apoptosis while it did not influence Th cell polarization in vitro. Our observations strongly suggest that ghrelin may significantly ameliorate experimental chronic colitis by modulating T helper effector cell function in the gut. Indeed, clinical evidence showed that ghrelin is involved in chronic intestinal inflammatory diseases in patients. Higher serum ghrelin level is associated with disease activity in ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease patients. Currently, important amount of data regarding ghrelin and its contribution in modulating immune response are suggesting possible therapeutic properties of the ghrelin pathway. However more studies are required before translating this novel approach to the clinical setting in order to clarify the contribution of this hormone in regulating the colonic immune response. In conclusion, the results described in this thesis provide further insights into implications of nervous system, via vagus nerve, and hormonal molecules such as ghrelin in the modulation of intestinal immune system. Hopefully, these findings and further investigations on these counter regulatory mechanisms will provide new insights in the cross-talk between the neuro-endocrine and immune system leading to the identification of new therapeutic targets to treat intestinal immune diseases. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|SYNOPSIS. Recent {{studies have}} {{investigated}} the source and target neurons for the diffusible <b>neuronal</b> <b>messenger</b> molecule nitric oxide (NO) in the nervous system of the locust. Here we compare the neuroarchitecture of NO signaling between dif-ferent sensory systems. The available neuroanatomical data implicate NO in sen-sory processing for modalities as diverse as mechanoreception, vision, olfaction, gustation and hearing. All respective first-order sensory neuropils are innervated by NOS-containing interneurons. The corresponding sensory receptor neurons lack NOS but seem to express soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC), the main receptor mol-ecule for NO in the nervous system. The axonal projections of sensory neurons must therefore be considered the primary target of NO in these sensory neuropils. An exception is the antennal olfactory system where sGC is apparently expressed in interneurons, in partial colocalization with NOS. We discuss these anatomical findings {{in relation to the}} spatiotemporal charac-teristics of NO signaling. Many sensory neuropils are organized into maps that reflect neuronal response properties (i. e., tuning or receptive fields). A local release of NO within such maps will therefore most strongly affect neurons with similar coding properties. If sensory receptor activity triggers NO synthesis locally in the map, this mechanism could link groups of similarly tuned receptors dynamically according to stimulus intensity. Furthermore, we explore the functional implica-tions of differences between sensory systems in the anatomy of NOS-expressing interneurons, using the compound eye and the thoracic tactile system as examples...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Nitric oxide (NO) is a <b>neuronal</b> <b>messenger</b> {{molecule}} in {{the central}} nervous system, which is generated from L-arginine by nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and involves in many important opioid-induced effects. Our previous studies revealed that Cuminum cyminum interestingly reduces morphine sensitization, tolerance and dependency in male mice. Therefore, in the present study, the effect of intraperitoneal (ip) administration of different doses of cumin fruit essential oil (FEO) on the acquisition of morphine-induced conditioned place preference (CPP) in L-arginine treated mice was investigated. Methods: In this study, the CPP paradigm was done on 231 adult male albino Wistar mice and conditioning scores and locomotor activity were recorded by the Ethovision software. Results: The results showed that solely administration of different doses of cumin FEO (0. 01, 0. 1, 0. 5, 1 and 2 %; ip) or L-arginine (50, 100 and 200 mg/kg; ip) during CPP protocol could not induce CPP. Nonetheless, morphineinduced CPP was significantly decreased by two higher doses of cumin FEO (1 % and 2 %; P< 0. 05), while it was increased by L-arginine (100 and 200 mg/kg) when they were injected before morphine (5 mg/kg) during the acquisition period (P< 0. 001). Additionally, cumin FEO (0. 01 - 2 %) could interestingly attenuate the increasing effect of L-arginine (200 mg/kg) on morphine-induced CPP in a dose-dependent manner. Conclusion: In conclusion, {{it could be suggested}} that some components of cumin FEO attenuate the excessive effect of L-arginine on morphine-induced CPP through inhibitory mechanisms on NO pathway. It seems that cumin FEO possibly acts as a NOS inhibitor...|$|E
40|$|The fear {{conditioning}} {{paradigm is}} used to investigate the roles of various genes, neurotransmitters, and substrates {{in the formation of}} fear learning related to contextual and auditory cues. In the brain, nitric oxide (NO) produced by neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) functions as a retrograde <b>neuronal</b> <b>messenger</b> that facilitates synaptic plasticity, including the late phase of long-term potentiation (LTP) and formation of long-term memory (LTM). Evidence has implicated NO signaling in synaptic plasticity and LTM formation following fear conditioning, yet {{little is known about the}} role of the nNOS gene in fear learning. Using knockout (KO) mice with targeted mutation of the nNOS gene and their wild-type (WT) counterparts, the role of NO signaling in fear conditioning was investigated. Plasma levels of the stress hormone corticosterone were measured to determine the relationship between physiological and behavioral response to fear conditioning. Contextual fear learning was severely impaired in male and female nNOS KO mice compared with WT counterparts; cued fear learning was slightly impaired in nNOS KO mice. Sex-dependent differences in both contextual and cued fear learning were not observed in either genotype. Deficits in contextual fear learning in nNOS KO mice were partially overcome by multiple trainings. A relationship between increase in plasma corticosterone levels following footshock administration and the magnitude of contextual, but not cued freezing was also observed. Results suggest that the nNOS gene contributes more to optimal contextual fear learning than to cued fear learning, and therefore, inhibition of the nNOS enzyme may ameliorate context-dependent fear response...|$|E
40|$|The {{central nervous}} system isprobably the most complex {{structure}} present in the human body. Such complexityis also a drawback since the {{central nervous system}} may be affected by severaldiseases, many of which are extremely complex and difficult to understand. Onefeature that many neurological diseases have in common is some perturbation inthe metabolism of <b>neuronal</b> <b>messenger</b> RNA. Despite all the studies and the progress that has been achieved in thisfield, the exact relation between dysfunction of mRNA metabolism andneurological disease remains elusive. In fact, for many severe diseases stillno precise molecular pathway has been identified. In particular motor neurons seem to beextremely vulnerable to perturbations of their mRNA metabolism as shown by thefact that mutations in genes encoding RNA-binding proteins can cause devastatingdiseases like Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and Spinal Muscular Atrophy. SpinalMuscular Atrophy in particular is caused by shortage of the Survival of MotorNeuron protein, which is fundamental for pre-mRNA splicing by affecting thematuration of the Sm proteins, the major players of splicing. Despite the factthat the function of SMN is well known, nobody could so far provide a directexplanation for the pathogenesis of SMA. The Like-Sm protein 1 (LSm 1), a memberof the Like-Sm protein family which is structurally related to the Sm proteinfamily, has been demonstrated {{to play an important role}} in neuronal mRNA processing. Considering the similarities between LSm proteins and Sm proteins, a potentialrole for SMN in the metabolism of LSm proteins can be hypothesized. A lack ofSMN, as observed in SMA, could lead to misfunction of the mRNA processescarried by LSm 1 or other members of the family. The aim of the work of mythesis is to investigate a potential role of LSm proteins and proteinsassociated with them in neuronal mRNA metabolism and eventually, look for apossible role in the pathogenesis of SMA. We identified in mammalian cells aninteractor of LSm 1, Pat 1 b, known to be involved in mRNA turnover in yeast. As apartner of LSm 1, Pat 1 b could be necessary for its action or for specific mRNAtarget recognition. In the first part of this work we studied the role of Pat 1 bin mammalian cells and in neuronal mRNA metabolism. We found that Pat 1 b affectsmRNA turnover through deadenylation of the target. Plus, we observed that inmammalian cells Pat 1 b does not generally act on mRNA molecules but insteadaffects specific transcripts. However, when we extended our analysis toneurons, we observed a prevalent nuclear localization of the protein,suggesting that in neurons Pat 1 b has evolved a different function. This study beingfocused on mRNA metabolism (cytoplasmic event), we decided to look at otherpotential players of neuronal mRNA and SMA. We studied two members of the Like-Smfamily that share structural features with LSm 1 and LSm 4 which make themcandidates as SMN partners. We show that LSm 14 a and LSm 14 b can represstranslation of mRNA and affect its stability and that they bind specific mRNAsin neurons that are involved in cytoskeleton remodelling and axonal growth. Inagreement with these findings, knock-down of LSm 14 b in primary neurons causedan axonal phenotype. At last, we extended our analysis of LSm 14 proteins to SMAand found that a SMA mouse model has dramatically reduced levels of both proteinssuggesting a link between the proteins and the disease. This work sheds lighton the function and importance of three different proteins in neuronal mRNAmetabolism, and increases our knowledge of neuronal molecular physiology. nrpages: 98 status: publishe...|$|E
