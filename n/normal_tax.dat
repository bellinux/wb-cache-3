50|$|The Hoko system {{faced the}} risk of {{overhaul}} in the 1920s where its rules of collective responsibility were seen as archaic {{in a time of}} increasing individualism. Critics of the system deemed it racially discriminatory considering it was only enforced on Taiwanese nationals, who also had to pay the corresponding hoko fees in addition to their <b>normal</b> <b>taxes.</b> This manifested itself in a petition, led by Yang Chi Chen for the hoko system’s abolition being presented the Japan’s 44th Diet in August 1921. Ultimately, the hoko system was not abolished until June 1945, shortly before Japan’s surrender in World War II.|$|R

50|$|In 2008 Alresford {{made the}} news {{when it was}} {{reported}} that its residents were unhappy with the rising levels of crime. In response to this, on top of their <b>normal</b> <b>taxes</b> the villagers paid an additional £13,000 so that the local Essex Police could have an officer assigned to specifically patrol the village. The appointed Police Community Support Officer (PCSO) was seen as a success by the villagers and was credited in an overall reduction of crime in the village. Despite the large amount spent on having her specifically patrol the village residents voted eight to three to keep her post. Official figures show that since the deployment of a dedicated PCSO for the village crime has been reduced including criminal damage and anti social behaviour, which was previously increasing in the village before the PCSO was appointed. The cost of PCSO is now shared with a neighbouring village, Great Bentley.|$|R
5000|$|In 1947, the [...] "Customs Free Airport Act" [...] {{established}} Shannon as the world's first duty-free airport, a move {{promoted by}} Brendan O'Regan; although [...] "duty-free" [...] shopping is not applicable any more for flights within the European Union, EU-bound passengers can still buy goods, but {{have to pay}} the <b>normal</b> <b>taxes.</b> Shannon became a model for other duty-free facilities worldwide.

As the prices for tobacco in Ireland are {{among the highest in the}} world, there is little or no demand for tobacco at Irish airports for EU flights.|$|R
