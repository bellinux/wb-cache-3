He supported the creation of a special budget for the province of Buenos Aires, led by governor Eduardo Duhalde. The radical legislator Leopoldo Moreau supported the <b>new</b> <b>budget</b> even more vehemently than the Peronists. Both parties had an informal alliance in the province. Alfonsín also supported the amendment to the constitution of Buenos Aires that allowed Duhalde to run for re-election.|$|E

5|$|Meeting on {{the third}} day of the special session, Democratic factions within the General Assembly reached a {{compromise}} budget. That tentative budget proposed an increase in the state sales tax from 6% to 7%, which was estimated to generate an additional $1.1 billion in revenue. The plan also included a requirement to use half of that for direct relief toward New Jersey's property tax—highest of all states. The plan also called for the same dedicated purpose for all of the money raised by this sales tax increase in subsequent years. The <b>new</b> <b>budget</b> law included a provision for a constitutional amendment which was required, like all such amendments in the state, to be approved in an Election Day referendum. On November 7, 2006, New Jersey voters approved this measure by a two to one margin statewide.|$|E

25|$|South East Asian LCC AirAsia {{plans to}} {{establish}} a <b>new</b> <b>budget</b> airline in Vietnam in {{a joint venture with}} Vietnamese partners, AirAsia announced in a statement to the Malaysia Stock Exchange on 31 March 2017. The new Vietnamese LCC is expected to commence its operations by early 2018. The company said that the new joint venture has been signed by its wholly owned subsidiary AirAsia Investment Limited (AAIL) with Vietnam’s Gumin Company Limited (Gumin), a businessman Tran Trong Kien and Hai Au Aviation Joint Stock Company (JV Co) on 30 March 2017. Gumin will own around 69.99% of the new LCC, AirAsia will have 30% and Tran will own the rest. According to AirAsia, the new venture will need investments of VND 1 trillion ($44 million), and the Kuala Lumpur-based company will contribute 30% of that after raising internal funding. AirAsia said that Vietnam’s geographical location provides the foundation and support for the joint venture’s plans to operate domestic and international underserved routes focusing primarily in providing connectivity domestically into key cities in Vietnam as well as internationally to ASEAN, China, Korea and Japan from 3 major hubs namely Ho Chi Minh, Hanoi and Da Nang. Vietnam is also the 5th largest aviation market in South East Asia after Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore. It was the fastest growing aviation market both in the world and in South East Asia in 2015 and 2016. In terms of passenger carriage (domestic and international), Vietnam’s air travel passenger carriage in 2016 was 52 million, with its growth dwarfing its ASEAN peers’, charting approximately 28% year-over-year growth in 2016 vis-à-vis its ASEAN peer’s average growth of approximately 10%. Vietnam’s domestic and international market has also doubled in size since 2013 and 2011 respectively. Domestic passenger growth in 2016 was approximately 25% while international growth was over 30%. With the plan, AirAsia will enter the competitive market of airlines’ industry in Vietnam and challenge the current LCC players – VietJet and Jetstar Pacific.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to fare collections, the MARTA budget {{is funded by}} a 1% sales tax in Fulton, Clayton and DeKalb counties along with limited federal money. In 2017, the City of Atlanta raised their sales tax for MARTA to 1.5% to improve and expand MARTA. For fiscal year 2007, MARTA had a farebox recovery ratio of 31.8%. By law, funds from the 1% sales tax must be split evenly between MARTA's operational and Capital expenditure budgets. This restriction {{does not apply to}} other sources of revenue, including passenger revenue. The split was written into MARTA legislation at MARTA's formation with the rationale that MARTA should continue expanding and investing in the system. However, MARTA has no active rail construction projects. Capital funds continue to decrease every year, creating a shortfall. The operations funds limit the amount of service MARTA provides. The sales tax law was amended by the state legislature in 2002 to allow a temporary three-year 45% capital/55% operations split. This additional 5% for operations expired in 2005. A 2005 bill to renew the split was tabled by the legislature's MARTA Oversight Committee, forcing MARTA to pass a <b>new</b> <b>budget</b> with cuts in service. The temporary 45%/55% capital/operations split was renewed again in the 2006 state legislative session. The capital funds surplus has resulted in projects, such as a new US$100million Breeze Card fare collection system and US$1.1million automatic toilets in the MARTA Five Points station, occurring {{at the same time that}} MARTA is struggling to pay for bus and rail operations. In 2015, the Georgia Assembly approved a new bill that no longer requires MARTA to split the 1% Sales Tax. Due to low Sales Tax Revenue and no source of funding from the State of Georgia, MARTA was forced to eliminate 43 bus routes, eliminate shuttles, (Excluding the Six Flags Over Georgia and Braves Shuttle) and reduce Rail Service frequencies and hours. MARTA also closed the majority of its station restrooms. There are 13 station restrooms open to the public, which most are located at the end of each line including College Park, Arts Center, Peachtree Center, West End, Avondale, Kensington and Lindbergh Center. There are two Ridestores available. The two Ridestores are located at the Airport and Five Points Rail Stations. Despite the massive cuts, MARTA predicted the system would still come up 69.34million dollars short for FY 2011; in which was pulled from their Reserved Account. A $9 million addition was posted for 2013. This money is being re-invested into the system by adding frequency to trains and bus routes.|$|E

500|$|Rochdale had {{developed}} into an increasingly large, populous, and prosperous urban mill town since the Industrial Revolution. Its newly built rail and canal network, and numerous factories, {{resulted in the}} town being [...] "remarkable for many wealthy merchants". In January 1856 the electorate of the Rochdale constituency petitioned the Privy Council for the grant of a charter of incorporation under the Municipal Corporations Act 1835, to constitute the town as a municipal borough. This would give it limited political autonomy via an elected town council, comprising a mayor, aldermen, and councillors, to oversee local affairs. The petition was successful and the charter was granted in September 1856. The newly formed Rochdale Corporation—the local authority for the Municipal Borough of Rochdale—suggested {{plans to build a}} town hall in which to conduct its business in May 1858. The site of an abandoned 17th-century house known as The Wood was proposed. Six months later, in April 1860, Rochdale Corporation arranged to buy the site {{on the outskirts of the}} town centre for £4,730 (£ in [...] ).
