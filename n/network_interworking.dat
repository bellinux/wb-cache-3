The combination of these tools provides applications and services with functionality needed to implement a wide variety of multimedia communication services.

One of the vast discussion in this area is increasing the throughput and prevent the congestion in rush traffic hours in the network. Congestion occurs when transfer rate in the network is lower than requested rate by application. Congestion leads to cell loss and dropped cells should be retransferred to recover the data which is double job and affect the throughput and even can affect the quality of the services. Time sensitive information (voice/video) requires no data loss and they employ Forward Error Correction (FEC) codes to recover the data. The number of the FEC codes should be kept small to prevent the overload in the network.

40|$|With {{convergence}} of the Internet and mobile telecommunications, mobile networks are taking {{more and more}} IP-based protocols onboard. Mobile networks are expected to evolve and become IP-based packet data networks with various fuctionalities supported by IP-based protocols. This thesis investigates IP protocols for mobility management an all-IP mobile network. The design principles of mobility management in packet data network are first explored by studying GPRS. It is realised that GPRS is only an emulated IP network and lacks of the flexibility of IP networks. Packet scheduling techniques for enhancing mobility management performance and its implementation in GPRS are also studied. Evolution of GPRS to an all-IP based network, in which IP protocols {{can be used for}} mobility management, is subsequently proposed. Mobility management protocols in IP networks can be segregated into inter-domain (or macro) mobility, intra-domain (or micro) mobility and mobile ad hoc networking. Mobile IP is a proposal by the IETF as a solution to support mobility of IP terminal. In addition, SIP has been extended by research community to support terminal mobility. Both Mobile IP and extended SIP are compared for their ability to support mobility. It is found that Mobile IP is more suitable for supporting terminal mobility. However, Mobile IP is not sufficient for supporting intra-domain and high-speed mobility. An optimised solution therefore consists of Mobile IP and a specialised intra-domain mobility scheme. Having identified the characteristics and design principles of various existing inti-a-domain mobility protocols, a novel protocol known as Mobility-Aware Routing Protocol, MARP, is proposed. It is compared to some existing protocols and is proven to be superior in term of better handoff support, flexibility in packet routing and scalability. Mobile ad hoc networks are expected to be integral part of all-IP mobile <b>network.</b> <b>Interworking</b> of ad hoc and infrastructure-backed mobile networks enables extension of wireless networks coverage and provision of Internet access to mobile node with relaying. Key issues related to such a hybrid networking topology, in the context of ad hoc IP routing protocol and mobility management protocol, are identified. Mechanisms that allow interworking of mobility protocols and ad hoc routing protocols are designed. Interworking of both protocols significantly increases capability of ad hoc mobile nodes to interact with fixed network elements, but is at the cost of high control overhead. Effective techniques for reducing control overhead in the hybrid network is subsequently proposed...|$|E
40|$|The use of {{satellites}} for {{mobile communication}} applications {{has become a}} global issue. The use of handheld, vehicle mounted and transportable terminals is a key feature of Satellite Personal Communication Networks (S-PCNs). Due to the higher eirp requirements on the Earths surface and also because of their inherent delay, geostationary (GEO) satellites are not considered suitable for such applications. Instead, constellations of satellites at lower altitudes have been proposed for use in what are termed 2 nd generation mobile satellite communication systems. Low intensity regions in the Earths surrounding trapped radiation bands, have resulted in two altitude bands of specific interest, resulting in two constellation types - LEO (Low Earth Orbit) constellations at around 1, 000 km and MEO (Medium Earth Orbit) constellations at around 10, 000 km. A satellite constellation consists {{of a number of}} satellites orbiting at the same altitude and inclination and phased in a specific way. The work reported in this thesis proposes a network control architecture for LEO or MEO based S-PCN systems. Air-interface signalling aspects are then considered for mobility management and call setup signalling. LEO and MEO constellation design aspects and properties are initially considered. Important implications on the control network are drawn based on constellation coverage and connectivity properties. Other system constraints such as terrestrial <b>network</b> <b>interworking</b> considerations as well as user, network operator and regulator requirements are also considered. Finally network and more specifically satellite control signalling is examined before a S-PCN architecture is proposed. The reference architecture results in constellation control being distributed globally with individual satellite control, at any one time, being located at a specific earth station. The use of two earth station types allows network administration to be separated from traffic channel carrying aspects. In order to reduce system setup cost and delay, the reuse of network related standards from the GSM terrestrial mobile communication system is envisaged. An equivalence is made between the S-PCN architecture and the GSMs terrestrial architecture. Network implementation aspects are considered for a 14 satellite MEO constellation. Network implications resulting from the use of LEO and MEO constellations are considered. After an examination of S-PCN traffic demand on a MEO constellation, mobility management signalling is considered. A new approach is proposed based on the use of a positioning system. The performance of this approach is examined from a system signalling viewpoint for both LEO and MEO constellations and a method to minimise the required amount of signalling is described. The air interface signalling procedure for location update, based on a modified GSM network layer protocol, is simulated from a delay point of view for both LEO and MEO constellations. User-originated, user-terminated and user-to-user call setup signalling were also simulated and their delay performance examined. The importance of random access channel delay and of user cooperation with the link were highlighted as aspects which have a significant influence on the average signalling delay. Finally, the effect of common and dedicated control channel system signalling on satellite power consumption, based on busy hour call setup and mobility management signalling estimates, was examined for a MEO constellation. From this, conclusions can be made on the signalling power efficiency of S-PCN systems...|$|E
