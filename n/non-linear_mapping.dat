50|$|An autoencoder is a {{feed-forward}} {{neural network}} which is trained to approximate the identity function. That is, it is trained to map from a vector of values to the same vector. When used for dimensionality reduction purposes, one of the hidden layers in the network is limited to contain {{only a small number}} of network units. Thus, the network must learn to encode the vector into a small number of dimensions and then decode it back into the original space. Thus, the first half of the network is a model which maps from high to low-dimensional space, and the second half maps from low to high-dimensional space. Although the idea of autoencoders is quite old, training of deep autoencoders has only recently become possible through the use of restricted Boltzmann machines and stacked denoising autoencoders. Related to autoencoders is the NeuroScale algorithm, which uses stress functions inspired by multidimensional scaling and Sammon mappings (see below) to learn a <b>non-linear</b> <b>mapping</b> from the high-dimensional to the embedded space. The mappings in NeuroScale are based on radial basis function networks.|$|E

40|$|We study {{multi-user}} massive multiple-input single-output (MISO) {{systems and}} focus on downlink transmission, where the base station (BS) employs a large antenna array with low-cost 1 -bit digital-to-analog converters (DACs). The direct combination of existing beamforming schemes with 1 -bit DACs is shown to lead to an error floor at medium-to-high SNR regime, due to the coarse quantization of the DACs with limited precision. In this paper, based on the constructive interference we consider both a quantized linear beamforming scheme where we analytically obtain the optimal beamforming matrix, and a <b>non-linear</b> <b>mapping</b> scheme where we directly design the transmit signal vector. Due to the 1 -bit quantization, the formulated optimization for the <b>non-linear</b> <b>mapping</b> scheme is shown to be non-convex. To solve this problem, the non-convex constraints of the 1 -bit DACs are firstly relaxed, followed by an element-wise normalization to satisfy the 1 -bit DAC transmission. We further propose a low-complexity symbol scaling scheme that consists of three stages, in which the quantized transmit signal on each antenna element is selected sequentially. Numerical {{results show that the}} proposed symbol scaling scheme achieves a comparable performance to the optimization-based <b>non-linear</b> <b>mapping</b> approach, while its corresponding complexity is negligible compared to that of the non-linear scheme.
