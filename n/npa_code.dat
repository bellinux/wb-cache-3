5000|$|On January 25, 1995, INC {{designated}} the 888 Numbering Plan Area (<b>NPA)</b> <b>code</b> {{as the next}} area code for use in providing Toll-Free service. The INC also reserved the remaining 8YY sic (877, 866, ..., 822) area codes for future Toll-Free services.|$|E
50|$|Within the {{multinational}} calling area {{administered by the}} North American Numbering Plan, telephone numbers are composed of three fixed-length fields: a three-digit numbering plan area (<b>NPA)</b> <b>code</b> (area code), indicating a geographical area, a three-digit (NXX) central office code, and a four-digit (XXXX) station number.|$|E
50|$|Area code 201 was the first-assigned {{numbering}} plan area (<b>NPA)</b> <b>code</b> {{of the original}} NPAs when AT&T devised the North American Numbering Plan in 1947. It {{was also the first}} area code with Direct Distance Dialing (DDD) service, when in 1951 the first direct-dialed long-distance call was made from Englewood, New Jersey to Alameda, California.|$|E
50|$|In North America, {{interchangeable}} <b>NPA</b> <b>codes</b> are area {{codes of}} the telephone network {{that do not have}} a 0 or 1 as the middle digit.|$|R
50|$|Under this proposal, the N9X format <b>NPA</b> <b>codes,</b> {{which are}} {{currently}} reserved from assignment, {{would be released}} and be available for normal assignment for code relief and other purposes.|$|R
50|$|In North America, from 1947 to 1995, all {{numbering}} plan area (<b>NPA)</b> <b>codes</b> were distinguished with a 0 or 1 {{as the middle}} digit, while central office codes (the first three digits of a seven-digit local number) never had a 0 or 1 as the middle digit.|$|R
50|$|Ten decimal digits {{allow an}} {{absolute}} maximum of 10 billion telephone numbers. The numbering {{rules of the}} plan reduce that to 6.4 billion telephone numbers. However, a considerable percentage of these numbers will remain unused when the last available <b>NPA</b> <b>code</b> is assigned, because thousands of numbers will be reserved in exchanges that serve only small population centers, the exchange being served by a single NPA-NXX combination in non-competitive markets. More combinations would be partially unused {{in the event that}} a small market has competitive providers.|$|E
50|$|By 1995, {{many cities}} in the United States and Canada {{had more than one}} area code, either through {{splitting}} the city into different areas (splits) or having more than one code for the same area (overlays). For example, in Manhattan, subscribers' numbers had the <b>NPA</b> <b>code</b> 212, but two additional codes—first 917 (which initially was exclusively for cellular phones and pagers until that idea was struck down in a Federal court), then 646—were also introduced. This means that the area code must be dialed, even for local calls. In other areas, 10-digit or 11-digit dialing is now required for all local calls. The transition to 10-digit dialing typically starts with a permissive dialing phase in which 10-digit dialing is optional. During this period, the transition is heavily publicized. After a period of several months, the mandatory dialing phase is introduced, in which 7-digit dialing no longer works. Atlanta was the first U.S. city to require mandatory 10-digit dialing throughout the metropolitan area, roughly coinciding with the 1996 Summer Olympics held there. Atlanta was used as the test case not only because of its size, but also because it enjoyed the world's largest fiber optic network at the time (five times that of New York then), and it was home to BellSouth (now part of AT&T), then the Southeastern Regional Bell Operating Company.|$|E
50|$|When the North American Numbering Plan {{was created}} in 1947, Missouri was divided into two {{numbering}} plan areas (<b>NPAs).</b> Area <b>code</b> 816 served all points west of Jefferson City, while area code 314 served the east, including St. Louis. However, in 1951 a third <b>NPA,</b> area <b>code</b> 417, was created for the southwest, including the cities of Branson, Joplin, and Springfield.|$|R
50|$|In 2015 the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) {{approved}} the Canadian Non-Geographic Code Assignment Guideline and {{the assignment of}} the 622, 633, 644, 655, 677, and 688 non-geographic numbering plan area (<b>NPA)</b> <b>codes</b> {{to meet the demand}} for telephone numbers related to technologies such as machine-to-machine applications. The first 6YY NPA to be used is 622 NPA, with additional numbers requested when 622 approaches exhaustion.|$|R
50|$|The {{structure}} of the North American Numbering Plan permits implementation of local dial plans in each plan area, depending on requirements. When multiple <b>NPA</b> <b>codes</b> serve an area in an overlay arrangement, ten-digit (10D) dialing is required. Seven-digit (7D) dialing may be permissible in areas with single area codes. Depending on the requirement of toll alerting, {{it may be necessary}} to prefix a telephone numbers with 1. The NANPA publishes dial plan information for individual area codes.|$|R
50|$|As of 1990, Bellcore {{determined}} that Interchangeable <b>NPA</b> <b>codes</b> {{would be required}} and would be implemented no sooner than 1 January 1995. By that date, all telephone callers, even those in area codes that {{did not yet have}} interchangeable CO codes, would be required to dial all ten digits for long distance calls, including such calls within the same area code. Canadian phone companies made the change in fall 1994 outside of area code 905, which had already implemented the requirement (before the split from 416) in 1990.|$|R
50|$|Each {{of these}} eight numbers {{is part of}} a NANP dial plan using <b>NPAs</b> (Area <b>Codes)</b> which prevent nearly 8,000,000 {{telephone}} numbers (from N11-NXX-0000 to N11-NXX-9999 excluding certain NXXs) from being assigned.|$|R
50|$|When calling {{other places}} in the North American Numbering Plan, callers dial as if {{undertaking}} regular ten-digit dialling in those countries. Callers dial 1 + <b>NPA</b> area <b>code</b> + seven digit phone number.|$|R
50|$|When {{calling to}} {{other places in the}} North American Numbering Plan, calls are dialed as if {{undertaking}} regular ten-digit dialing in those countries. Callers must simply dial 1 + <b>NPA</b> (area <b>code)</b> + seven digit phone number.|$|R
5000|$|In the GSM variant PCS 1900, MSISDN {{is built}} up as MSISDN = CC + NPA + SN CC = Country <b>Code</b> <b>NPA</b> = Number Planning Area SN = Subscriber Number ...|$|R
50|$|Before {{the late}} 1970s and early 1980s, {{it was common}} for many smaller cities {{to have their own}} operators. An <b>NPA</b> (area <b>code)</b> would usually have its largest city as its primary toll center, with smaller toll centers serving the {{secondary}} cities scattered throughout the NPA. TSPS allowed telephone companies to close smaller toll centers and consolidate operator services in regional centers which might be hundreds of miles from the subscriber.|$|R
50|$|When the North American Numbering Plan was {{devised by}} AT&T in October 1947, Nassau and Suffolk counties, {{and the lower}} Hudson Valley, were {{assigned}} area code 914. In 1951, Nassau and Suffolk were split off as a separate numbering plan area (<b>NPA)</b> with area <b>code</b> 516.|$|R
50|$|In the 1940s, {{with the}} advent of dial pulse and {{multi-frequency}} operator dialing, the operator would plug into a tandem trunk and dial the <b>NPA</b> (area <b>code)</b> and operator code for the information operator in the distant city. For instance, the New York City information operator was 212-131. If the customer knew the number, and the point was direct-dialable, the operator would dial the call. If the distant city did not have dialable numbers, the operator would dial the code for the inward operator serving the called party, and ask her to ring the number.|$|R
50|$|By the mid-1990s, the {{proliferation}} of cell phones, pagers, and fax machines required another area <b>code.</b> <b>NPA</b> 717 was split on December 5, 1998, when the northern portion, centered on Scranton, Wilkes-Barre and Williamsport, received area code 570. As of May 2005, the subscriber number pool of 717 was allocated by 52%.|$|R
5000|$|An IXC carries traffic, usually voice traffic, between {{telephone}} exchanges. Telephone exchanges {{are usually}} {{identified in the}} United States by the LATA indicated by three-digit area <b>code</b> (<b>NPA)</b> and the first three digits of the phone number (NPA-NXX) within the LATA. Different exchanges generally cover different geographic locations, connected as separate central offices (COs, also called [...] "wire centers").|$|R
50|$|Within the NANP, {{a leading}} digit of 0 or 1 {{indicates}} special dialing arrangements such as 0-1-1 {{followed by a}} country code is used to dial internationally or 1 followed by a 10-digit phone number indicating long distance or toll charges. In a few states, some areas retain {{the ability to use}} 7-digit dialing for local calls; in these areas a leading digit of 1- must be followed by a 10-digit phone number. As such, N11s are restricted by NANP design to N = 2 through 9, creating the 8 allowable N11s. This is also why <b>NPAs</b> (Area <b>Codes)</b> or 7-digit phone numbers (designated by NXX-XXXX) cannot have a 0 or 1 as the first digit (N).|$|R
50|$|On September 1, 1984, Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island {{were split}} {{off as a}} new {{numbering}} plan area (<b>NPA)</b> with area <b>code</b> 718, while 212 was reduced to cover only Manhattan and the Bronx. In 1992, the 718 territory was expanded to include the Bronx and the Marble Hill neighborhood of Manhattan (see below), while reducing 212 to most of Manhattan. In 1992, the entire city was overlaid with area code 917, which was initially planned for only mobile service.|$|R
50|$|Traditionally, {{identical}} {{central office}} codes in adjacent Numbering Plan Areas (NPAs) would be assigned as far apart {{from each other}} as possible, so that callers living near an NPA boundary would not confuse numbers in the adjacent <b>NPAs.</b> Central office <b>code</b> protection made it possible in some low density areas to use seven digits to reach areas in another area code, such as Hull from Ottawa before 2006, as every Ottawa-Hull local number originally was reserved in both area code 613 and 819.|$|R
40|$|Obesity, {{diet and}} {{physical}} inactivity are {{risk factors for}} some cancers. Grantees of the National Comprehensive Cancer Control Program (NCCCP) in US states, tribes, and territories develop plans to coordinate funding and activities for cancer prevention and control. Including information and goals related to nutrition and physical activity (NPA) is a key opportunity for primary cancer prevention, but it is currently unclear to what extent NCCCP plans address these issues. We reviewed 69 NCCCP plans and searched for terms related to <b>NPA.</b> Plans were <b>coded</b> as (1) knowledge of NPA and cancer link; (2) goals to improve NPA behaviors; and (3) strategies to increase healthy NPA activities, environments, or systems changes. NPA content was consistently included in all cancer plans examined across all years. Only 4 (60...|$|R
