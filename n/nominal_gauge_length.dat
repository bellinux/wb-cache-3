40|$|Commercially {{produced}} {{sheets of}} superplastic grade Al 7475 with various thicknesses have been characterised {{in terms of}} their microstructure and mechanical properties. Gold grids deposited on polished surfaces of tensile specimens were used to measure the surface strains on mesoscopic and microscopic length scales, and fracture surfaces were examined using SEM. The results show that mechanically the alloy behaves like other superplastic materials, with a maximum strain rate sensitivity, m, of 0. 6, and a grain size exponent, p, of 2. 6. Thinner sheets had smaller grain sizes and therefore higher superplastic strain rates. The surface studies showed that the actual strain rate in the gauge length was considerably smaller than the ratio of the crosshead velocity to the <b>nominal</b> <b>gauge</b> <b>length</b> owing to extrusion of material from the gauge head. Evidence for grain boundary sliding and localised tensile separation of material were found. The latter effect was responsible for about 30 % of the strain in the surface. The separated regions were bridged by filaments of similar dimensions to whiskers observed protruding from the fracture surfaces. These whiskers were rich in Mg and were oxidised. It is suggested that the solid oxide layer is responsible for stabilising the filaments against necking...|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY: Si-Zr-C-O ceramic fibers were {{evaluated}} for deriving the Weibull parameters of high accuracy. The approach {{in this study}} couples detailed measurements of the diameter along the <b>gauge</b> <b>length</b> with tensile tests. The distribution of critical defects is assumed in the two-parameter single-modal Weibull model to be homogeneous throughout the volume. In the case of ceramic fibers, the term of volume is usually replaced with <b>gauge</b> <b>length</b> assuming the uniformity of the diameter. However the diameter measurements revealed very large variation along the <b>gauge</b> <b>length</b> of each fiber. This affects {{the reliability of the}} Weibull parameters, if the parameters are correlated with the <b>gauge</b> <b>length</b> and not with the volume. Therefore, tensile samples of equal volume were made from the sections with negligible variation in the diameter. Then the Weibull moduli were calculated for the two-parameter single-modal case with the tensile results. The obtained results show that the two-parameter single-modal Weibull distribution can successfully characterize the strength of Si-Zr-C-O fibers...|$|R

40|$|AbstractA simple, easily {{reproduced}} experiment {{based on}} artificial flaws {{has been proposed}} which demonstrates that {{the distribution of the}} minimum failure load does not necessarily follow a Weibull distribution. The experimental result presented in the paper clearly indicates that the Weibull distribution with its strictly increasing function, is incapable of approximating a constant probability of failure over a loading region. New fundamental concepts have been introduced referred to as ‘hazard stress density’ and ‘cumulative hazard stress density’. These concepts helped derive an equation giving the probability of failure without making use of the notions ‘flaws’ and ‘locally initiated failure by flaws’. As a result, the derived equation is more general than earlier models. The cumulative hazard stress density is an important fingerprint of materials and can be used for determining the reliability of loaded components. It leaves materials to ‘speak for themselves’ by not imposing a power law dependence on the variation of the critical flaws which is always the case if the Weibull model is used. An important link with earlier models has also been established. We show that the cumulative hazard stress density is numerically equal to the product of the number density of the flaws with a potential to cause failure and the probability that a flaw will be critical at the specified loading stress. We show that, predictions of the probability of failure from tests related to a small <b>gauge</b> <b>length</b> to a large <b>gauge</b> <b>length</b> are associated with large errors which increase in proportion with the ratio of the <b>gauge</b> <b>lengths.</b> Large <b>gauge</b> <b>length</b> ratios amplify the inevitable errors in the probability of failure associated with the small <b>gauge</b> <b>length</b> to a level which renders the predicted probability for failure of the large <b>gauge</b> <b>length</b> meaningless. Finally, a general integral has been derived, giving the reliability associated with time interval and random loading of a material with flaws. The integral has been validated by a Monte Carlo simulation...|$|R
40|$|Variability in {{the failure}} load, tenacity, and linear density of single aramid {{filaments}} is studied experimentally. Data indicate {{that both the}} failure load and the tenacity of filaments, for a given <b>gauge</b> <b>length</b> and yarn cross section, can be fitted to a two parameter Weibull distribution; however the fit is better for tenacity than for failure load, and the Weibull shape parameter for the former is typically smaller. Within a yam cross section filaments vary significantly in linear density (and diameter), and this variability contributes a component to the variability in failure load, {{but not to the}} tenacity. Also, the mean tenacity and the variability in linear density and in failure load may differ greatly from spool to spool. The implications of the variability are discussed in light of the work of Bunsell. The effect of <b>gauge</b> <b>length</b> on the strength distribution of filaments is examined. Weibull statistics are used to separate out this effect. As previously shown for other brittle filaments, the Weibull shape parameter for aramid filaments depends on the gauge length; however values for the shape parameter calculated at a fixed <b>gauge</b> <b>length</b> are substantially lower than those obtained by a procedure based on varying the <b>gauge</b> <b>length.</b> This suggests short range correlations in flaw strengths along a filament...|$|R

40|$|Two {{complimentary}} {{optical fiber}} strain sensors employing lock-in techniques are presented. The first system interrogates {{an array of}} long <b>gauge</b> <b>length</b> sensors, defined by broadband optical reflectors and employs multiplexing in the time domain. The second system operates over shorter <b>gauge</b> <b>lengths</b> using multiple narrowband reflectors and wavelength-division-multiplexing. The first system tracks minima in the amplitude response produced from the superposition of two sinusoidal subcarrier waves. The second uses an acousto-optic-tunable-filter (AOTF) to track the peak reflective wavelength of an array of Bragg gratings. Both systems are constructed using telecommunications components. Together, the systems {{may be used to}} examine both line-integrated strain (or temperature) over long <b>gauge</b> <b>lengths</b> and local strain at a number of selected discrete points of particular interest. Lock-in techniques using dithered signals are applicable to sensors having a transfer function containing at least one turning point. This may be a maximum or minimum when observed either in transmission or reflection. The sensor responds to the dither with an amplitude-modulated signal, which permits locking of the interrogation system to the turning point. This provides a real-time response and better noise performance than scanned measurements. High-resolution monitoring of time-varying strain is demonstrated using this method. The long <b>gauge</b> <b>length</b> system has demonstrated a resolution of 3 microstrain over discrete 5 m long sensing sections, with an interrogation time of 0. 25 s. When multiplexed to interrogate an array of four sections, intersection crosstalk levels were below minus 50 dB. The short <b>gauge</b> <b>length</b> interrogation system has been demonstrated using both fiber Bragg gratings and an in-line Fabry-Perot cavity as the wavelength selective reflectors. A resolution below 1 microstrain was obtained using the gratings, whereas a resolution of 1. 5 multiplied by 10 - 6 in optical path-length-difference was obtained when interrogating a Fabry-Perot cavity. Simultaneous monitoring of multiple Bragg gratings has also been demonstrated by multiplexing with different dither frequencies. The versatility and the high resolution make the lock-in systems ideal for smart structures applications...|$|R
