500|$|Until 1 January 1937, when The County Court Districts (<b>Name</b> <b>of</b> <b>Court)</b> Order 1936 {{came into}} force, the full title of each court was The County Court of (county) holden at (location/locations), using the {{historic}} county names for England and for Wales. Thereafter, each court was renamed as (location/s) County Court. [...] For brevity, the latter form is used throughout in this table, and [...] "County Court" [...] is abbreviated to [...] "CC".|$|E
50|$|Circuit {{court is}} the <b>name</b> <b>of</b> <b>court</b> systems in several common law jurisdictions. The core concept of circuit courts {{requires}} judges {{to travel to}} different locales {{in order to ensure}} wide visibility and understanding of cases in a region. More generally, some modern circuit courts may also refer to a court which merely holds trials for cases of multiple locations in some rotation.|$|E
50|$|The Clyde or Clyde-Carlingford type are principally {{found in}} {{northern}} and western Ireland and southwestern Scotland. They first {{were identified as}} a separate group in the Firth of Clyde region, hence the name. Over 100 {{have been identified in}} Scotland alone. Lacking a significant passage, they are a form of gallery grave. The burial chamber is normally located at one end of a rectangular or trapezoidal cairn, while a roofless, semi-circular forecourt at the entrance provided access from the outside (although the entrance itself was often blocked), and gives this type of chambered cairn its alternate <b>name</b> <b>of</b> <b>court</b> tomb or court cairn. These forecourts are typically fronted by large stones and it is thought the area in front of the cairn was used for public rituals of some kind. The chambers were created from large stones set on end, roofed with large flat stones and often sub-divided by slabs into small compartments. They are generally considered to be the earliest in Scotland.|$|E
50|$|The {{abbreviated}} <b>name</b> <b>of</b> the <b>court</b> {{is included}} inside the parenthesis {{before the year}} if the <b>name</b> <b>of</b> the <b>court</b> is not obvious from the reporter.

In this example, the <b>name</b> <b>of</b> the <b>court</b> (United States Supreme Court) is obvious (since only decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court are published in United States Reports) and is thus omitted as a matter of convention.|$|R

5000|$|The Court of Common Pleas was {{established}} by an ordinance promoted by New Jersey's first royal governor Edward Hyde, Lord Cornbury, and modeled on a similar ordinance passed in New York in the previous decade. When the courts of New Jersey were established under this ordinance, the English <b>name</b> <b>of</b> <b>Court</b> of Common Pleas, already used in West New Jersey, {{was given to the}} civil side of the County Court or Court of Sessions. The ordinance provided that justices of the peace would have jurisdiction over civil cases of debt or trespass to the value of forty shillings, with power to determine such cases without a jury, subject to an appeal to the Justices at the next Court of Sessions in cases for over twenty shillings. Next there {{was established}} a Court of Common Pleas to be held in each county at the place where the general Court of Sessions is usually kept, to [...] "begin immediately after the Sessions of the Peace does end and terminate". It was thus assumed rather than ordained that the judges of the Common Pleas should be the same as the judges of the sessions, and these latter had always been the justices of the peace of the county. The Court of Common Pleas was given general civil jurisdiction at common law, and there was a right of appeal or removal where the judgment was more than twenty pounds, and in cases where the title to land came in question.|$|E
