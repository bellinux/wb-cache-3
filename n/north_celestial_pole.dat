5|$|The German {{cartographer}} Johann Bayer {{used the}} Greek letters alpha to theta to label {{the most prominent}} stars in the constellation, while his countryman Johann Elert Bode subsequently added iota to phi. Only lambda and pi remain in use, likely because of their proximity to the <b>north</b> <b>celestial</b> <b>pole.</b> Within the constellation's borders, there are 39stars brighter {{than or equal to}} apparent magnitude6.5.|$|E
5|$|Capella {{is closer}} to the <b>north</b> <b>celestial</b> <b>pole</b> than any other first {{magnitude}} star. Its northern declination is such that it is actually invisible south of latitude 44°S—this includes southernmost New Zealand, Argentina and Chile as well as the Falkland Islands. Conversely it is circumpolar north of 44°N: for the whole of the United Kingdom, Canada and the northernmost United States, the star never sets. Capella and Vega are {{on opposite sides of the}} pole, at about the same distance from it, such that an imaginary line between the two stars will nearly pass through Polaris. Visible halfway between the Belt of Orion and Polaris, Capella is at its highest in the night sky at midnight in early December and is regarded as a prominent star of the winter sky in the northern hemisphere.|$|E
5|$|To {{calculate}} what astronomical {{features a}} structure faced a coordinate system is needed. The stars provide such a system. If {{you were to}} go outside on a clear night you would observe the stars spinning around the celestial pole. This point is +90° if you are watching the <b>North</b> <b>Celestial</b> <b>Pole</b> or −90° if you are observing the Southern Celestial Pole. The concentric circles the stars trace out are lines of celestial latitude, known as declination. The arc connecting the points on the horizon due East and due West (if the horizon is flat) and all points midway between the Celestial Poles is the Celestial Equator which has a declination of 0°. The visible declinations vary depending where {{you are on the}} globe. Only an observer on the North Pole of Earth would be unable to see any stars from the Southern Celestial Hemisphere at night (see diagram below). Once a declination has been found for the point on the horizon that a building faces it is then possible to say whether a specific body can be seen in that direction.|$|E

5000|$|Effective latitude:If that dial-plane is {{horizontal}}, then it's {{a horizontal}} dial (bifilar, or straight-style). Then, {{of course the}} <b>north</b> <b>celestial</b> <b>pole's</b> altitude, measured from the dial-plane, is the latitude of the location. Well then, if the flat-dial is reclined, declined, or reclined-&-declined, everything {{is the same as}} if it the dial were horizontal, with the <b>celestial</b> <b>pole's</b> altitude, measured with respect to the dial-plane, treated as the latitude.|$|R

I'll call that direction [...] "dial-north".|$|R

25|$|When {{viewed from}} the <b>north</b> <b>celestial</b> <b>pole</b> (i.e., from the {{approximate}} direction of the star Polaris) the Moon orbits Earth anticlockwise and Earth orbits the Sun anticlockwise, and the Moon and Earth rotate on their own axes anticlockwise.|$|E
25|$|A {{consequence}} of the precession is a changing pole star. Currently Polaris is extremely well suited to mark {{the position of the}} <b>north</b> <b>celestial</b> <b>pole,</b> as Polaris is a moderately bright star with a visual magnitude of 2.1 (variable), and it is located about one degree from the pole.|$|E
50|$|The Regiment of the North Pole, an {{outdated}} astronomy term, is a rule saying {{how to find}} the <b>celestial</b> <b>North</b> <b>Pole</b> by the stars.

50|$|The <b>north</b> {{and south}} <b>celestial</b> <b>poles</b> {{are the two}} {{imaginary}} points in the sky where the Earth's axis of rotation, indefinitely extended, intersects the <b>celestial</b> sphere. The <b>north</b> and south <b>celestial</b> <b>poles</b> appear permanently directly overhead to an observer at the Earth's North Pole and South Pole, respectively. As the Earth spins on its axis, the two <b>celestial</b> <b>poles</b> remain fixed in the sky, and all other points appear to rotate around them, completing one circuit per day (strictly per sidereal day).|$|R

50|$|The <b>celestial</b> <b>poles</b> {{are also}} the <b>poles</b> of the <b>celestial</b> {{equatorial}} coordinate system, meaning they have declinations of +90 degrees and &minus;90 degrees (for the <b>north</b> and south <b>celestial</b> <b>poles,</b> respectively).|$|R

5000|$|The {{precession}} of the equinoxes {{takes about}} 25,770 {{years to complete}} a cycle.Polaris' mean position (taking account of precession and proper motion) will reach a maximum declination of +89°32'23", which translates to 1657" [...] (or 0.4603°) from the <b>celestial</b> <b>north</b> <b>pole,</b> in February 2102. Its maximum apparent declination (taking account of nutation and aberration) will be +89°32'50.62", which is 1629" [...] (or 0.4526°) from the <b>celestial</b> <b>north</b> <b>pole,</b> on 24 March 2100.|$|R
25|$|The <b>north</b> <b>celestial</b> <b>pole</b> {{is located}} {{very close to}} the pole star (Polaris or North Star), so from the Northern Hemisphere, all {{circumpolar}} stars appear to move around Polaris. Polaris itself remains almost stationary, always at the north (i.e. azimuth of 0°), and always at the same altitude (angle from the horizon), equal to the observer's latitude. These are then classified into quadrants.|$|E
25|$|Moderns have Polaris to {{mark the}} {{approximate}} location of the <b>North</b> <b>celestial</b> <b>pole,</b> which it does nearly exactly, but this position of Polaris was not available in Pytheas' time, due {{to changes in the}} positions of the stars. Pytheas reported that the pole was an empty space at the corner of a quadrangle, the other three sides of which were marked by stars. Their identity has not survived but based on calculations these are believed to have been α and κ in Draco and β in Ursa Minor.|$|E
25|$|Whether a star is {{circumpolar}} {{depends upon}} the observer's latitude. Since the altitude of the north or south celestial pole (whichever is visible) equals the absolute value of the observer's latitude, any star whose angular distance from the visible celestial pole {{is less than the}} absolute latitude will be circumpolar. For example, if the observer's latitude is 50° N, any star will be circumpolar if it is less than 50° from the <b>north</b> <b>celestial</b> <b>pole.</b> If the observer's latitude is 35° S, then all stars within 35° of the south celestial pole are circumpolar. Stars on the celestial equator are not circumpolar when observed from any latitude in either hemisphere of the Earth.|$|E
5000|$|As on Earth, {{the effect}} of {{precession}} causes the <b>north</b> and south <b>celestial</b> <b>poles</b> to move in a very large circle, but on Mars the cycle is 175,000 Earth years ...|$|R

50|$|For {{satellites}} {{orbiting the}} earth it is normal {{to use the}} Equatorial coordinate system. The projection of the Earth's equator onto the celestial sphere is called the celestial equator.

25|$|The {{constellation}} {{is named}} after Cassiopeia, the queen of Aethiopia. Cassiopeia was the wife of King Cepheus of Aethiopia and mother of Princess Andromeda. Cepheus and Cassiopeia were placed {{next to each other}} among the stars, along with Andromeda. She was placed in the sky as a punishment after enraging Poseidon with the boast that her daughter Andromeda was more beautiful than the Nereids or, alternatively, that she herself was more beautiful than the sea nymphs. She was forced to wheel around the <b>North</b> <b>Celestial</b> <b>Pole</b> on her throne, spending half of her time clinging to it so she does not fall off, and Poseidon decreed that Andromeda should be bound to a rock as prey for the monster Cetus. Andromeda was then rescued by the hero Perseus, whom she later married.|$|E
500|$|The star Polaris, {{often called}} the [...] "North Star", is treated {{specially}} due to its proximity to the <b>north</b> <b>celestial</b> <b>pole.</b> [...] When navigating in the Northern Hemisphere, special techniques {{can be used with}} Polaris to determine latitude or gyrocompass error. [...] The other 57 selected stars have daily positions given in nautical almanacs, aiding the navigator in efficiently performing observations on them. [...] A second group of 115 [...] "tabulated stars" [...] can also be used for celestial navigation, but are often less familiar to the navigator and require extra calculations.|$|E
500|$|The three-letter {{abbreviation}} for the constellation, as {{adopted by the}} IAU (International Astronomical Union) in 1922, is [...] "UMi".

In the equatorial coordinate system, the right ascension coordinates of these borders lie between [...] and , while the declination coordinates range from the <b>north</b> <b>celestial</b> <b>pole</b> south to 65.40°.

50|$|These {{concepts}} {{are important for}} understanding celestial coordinate systems - frameworks for measuring the positions of objects in the sky. Certain reference lines and planes on Earth, when projected onto the celestial sphere, form the bases of the reference systems. These include the Earth's equator, axis, and the Earth's orbit. At their intersections with the celestial sphere, these form the <b>celestial</b> equator, the <b>north</b> and south <b>celestial</b> <b>poles</b> and the ecliptic, respectively.

500|$|Making up {{the handle}} of the Little Dipper are Delta and Epsilon Ursae Minoris. Just over 3.5 degrees from the <b>north</b> <b>celestial</b> <b>pole,</b> Delta is a white main-sequence star of {{spectral}} type A1V with an apparent magnitude of 4.35, located 172±1 light-years from Earth. Bearing the proper name of Yildun, it has around 2.8 times the diameter and 47 times the luminosity of the Sun. A triple star system, Epsilon Ursae Minoris shines with a combined average light of magnitude 4.22. A yellow giant of spectral type G5III, the primary is an RS Canum Venaticorum variable star. It is a spectroscopic binary, with a companion 0.36AU distant, and a [...] third star—an orange main-sequence star of spectral type K0—8100AU distant.|$|E
2500|$|The {{circumpolar}} stars {{appear to}} lie within a circle that is centered at the celestial pole and tangential to the horizon. At the Earth's North Pole, the <b>north</b> <b>celestial</b> <b>pole</b> is directly overhead, and all stars that are visible at all (that is, all {{stars in the}} Northern Celestial Hemisphere) are circumpolar. As one travels south, the <b>north</b> <b>celestial</b> <b>pole</b> moves towards the northern horizon. More and more stars that are {{at a distance from}} it begin to disappear below the horizon for some portion of their daily [...] "orbit", and the circle containing the remaining circumpolar stars becomes increasingly small. At the Equator, this circle vanishes to a single point – the celestial pole itself – which lies on the horizon, and there are thus effectively no circumpolar stars at all.|$|E
2500|$|The Perseus Family {{includes}} several constellations {{associated with the}} Perseus myth: Cassiopeia, Cepheus, Andromeda, Perseus, Pegasus, and Cetus (representing the monster sent to devour Andromeda).

The group reaches from near the <b>north</b> <b>celestial</b> <b>pole</b> to declination 30°.|$|E
50|$|Theta Boötis has {{apparent}} magnitude +4.05 and {{belongs to the}} spectral class F7V. It is approximately 47 light years from Earth.
