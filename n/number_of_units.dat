5|$|Overall, the Army's wartime {{division}} {{organization and}} reorganizations have been judged a success by historians, {{in that they}} provided an adequate <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>units</b> to win the war, while ensuring that agricultural and industrial production could continue.|$|E
5|$|Non-SI units {{associated}} with the CGS and the CGS-Gaussian system of units (Table 9). This table catalogues a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>units</b> of measure based on the CGS system and dating from the nineteenth century. They appear frequently in the literature, but their continued use is discouraged by the CGPM.|$|E
5|$|Other non-SI units (Table 8). This list {{catalogues}} a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>units</b> of {{measure that}} have been used internationally in certain well-defined spheres including the bar for pressure, the ångström for atomic physics, the nautical mile and the knot in navigation.|$|E

30|$|Like {{concentrated}} MTMFD, {{the optimum}} parameters of distributed MTMFD system {{are summarized in}} Table  3. The responses shown in Fig.  7 d are the minimized peak mid-span displacement responses of the bridge, considering optimum values of controlling parameters corresponding to each <b>number</b> <b>of</b> TMFD <b>units.</b> Thus, the optimum frequency spacing of MTMFD system increases with the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> TMFD <b>units</b> <b>of</b> MTMFD system. The optimum tuning frequency ratio increases with the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> TMFD <b>units.</b> The optimum R f reduces {{with the increase in}} the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> TMFD <b>units.</b> The optimum R f of TMFD is much higher than that of MTMFD system. The response of the bridge decreases with the increase in the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> TMFD <b>units</b> <b>of</b> a distributed MTMFD system up to a certain <b>number</b> <b>of</b> TMFD <b>units</b> and after that the reduction of response becomes practically insignificant which shows an optimum <b>number</b> <b>of</b> TMFD <b>units</b> in distributed MTMFD exists. For the present study, the optimum <b>number</b> <b>of</b> TMFD <b>units</b> is selected as 5 to compose distributed TMFD system.|$|R

5|$|Recruitment {{was thus}} heavy {{throughout}} the Augustan period, {{with a steady}} increase in the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>units</b> formed. By AD 23, the Roman historian Tacitus records that there were roughly the same numbers of auxiliaries in service as there were legionaries. Since at this time there were 25 legions of c. 5,000 men each, the Auxilia thus amounted to c. 125,000 men, implying c. 250 auxiliary regiments.|$|E
5|$|While 9/28 was {{fighting}} near Vukosavci, a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>units,</b> consisting mainly of artillery, were temporarily detached for duty with other formations of Second Panzer Army fighting Soviet troops within the German-occupied territory of Serbia. The division was not re-united until January 1945.|$|E
5|$|Army Group North {{had already}} {{considered}} abandoning Estonia in February 1944, during the Soviet Kingisepp-Gdov Offensive. A large <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>units</b> {{would have been}} freed up with changes to the front, but the Narva front continued to be defended on Hitler's orders. The German Command considered it important to maintain control over the southern shore of the Gulf of Finland to ease the situation in Finland and keep the Soviet Baltic Fleet trapped in the eastern bay of the gulf. The retention of the oil shale reserves and oil shale industry in Ida-Viru was important for economic reasons.|$|E

5|$|In {{response}} to Nedeljković's request for reinforcements, Simović {{had sent a}} <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>units</b> by rail via Tuzla. These included a cadet battalion and a company of the 27th Infantry Regiment, detached from the 1st Infantry Division Cerska. By the time the reinforcements arrived, Banja Luka had been evacuated {{in the face of}} German tanks and an Ustaše-led revolt. The cadet battalion was redirected to Ključ to block the road KljučMrkonjić GradJajce. Nedeljković did not have the option of withdrawing via Bugojno or Prozor as those towns had been taken over by the Ustaše.|$|E
5|$|In the 1860s, James Clerk Maxwell, William Thomson (later Lord Kelvin) {{and others}} {{working under the}} auspices of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, built on Gauss' work and formalised the concept of a {{coherent}} system of units with base units and derived units. The principle of coherence was successfully used to define a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>units</b> of measure based on the centimetre–gram–second system of units (CGS), including the erg for energy, the dyne for force, the barye for pressure, the poise for dynamic viscosity and the stokes for kinematic viscosity.|$|E

5|$|The Notitia lists a large <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>units</b> with barbarian names. This was {{probably}} {{the result of the}} transformation of irregular allied units serving under their own native officers (known as socii, or foederati) into regular formations. During the Principate, regular units with barbarian names are not attested until the 3rd century and even then rarely e.g. the ala I Sarmatarum attested in 3rd-century Britain, doubtless an offshoot of the Sarmatian horsemen posted there in 175.|$|E
5|$|The most {{critical}} problem, however, was {{a shortage of}} ammunition for the PAVN's tanks and heavy artillery (field artillery and mortars 85mm or larger in caliber). By 1974, PAVN's entire stock of heavy artillery and tank ammunition, including all ammunition held by combat units at forward warehouses, and in the PAVN's strategic reserves, totaled just 100,000 rounds. The ammunition problem was so serious that the PAVN artillery command had to replace the larger weapons in a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>units</b> with obsolete 76.2mm and 57mm artillery pieces drawn out of storage for which there still was adequate ammunition.|$|E
5|$|After {{three years}} as Inspector-General, {{and in order to}} gain staff experience, Davies was {{attached}} as an observer to a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>units</b> in the United Kingdom in 1909–10. During this time, he also attended the Imperial Defence Conference and represented the New Zealand forces at the funeral of King Edward VII. At the end of the one-year attachment, he had so impressed the British Army that they offered him an appointment as commander of 6th Brigade in October 1910, with the temporary rank of brigadier general. As such, he became the first overseas officer to command a regular brigade, only eleven years after taking up a permanent military commission.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} of the invasion, many units of the 4th Army were still at their {{mobilisation}} centres or in their concentration areas, and only a small <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>units</b> had actually deployed into their planned positions to defend the border. A significant number of conscripts did not report to their mobilisation centres. The logistics of the 4th Army were in a poor state, mainly {{due to a lack of}} livestock and vehicles for transport, but also due to fifth column sabotage by the Ustaše and their sympathisers, to the extent that many units did not even have 10 per cent of their transport needs. It was also equipped poorly, lacking in many tools of modern warfare, including tanks, light artillery, anti-aircraft weapons and air support. These deficiencies affected both its fighting power and morale.|$|E
5|$|Every {{player has}} {{a limit to}} the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>units</b> they can create—a {{population}} limit—but may not immediately use the entire potential population. The population capacity, which can be capped at anywhere between 75 – 200 in intervals of 25, {{is based on the}} number of houses, Castles, or Town Centers—the main building in a player's town—which have been built. The Age of Kings introduced two significant new features for unit management: the idle villager button, which helps players identify villagers that have not been assigned a task, and the town bell, which sends all a player's villagers into their Town Center, Castle, or tower for safety; units garrisoned within these three buildings, especially archers, increase the building's firepower (towers fire more arrows with units garrisoned inside) including the town center, which cannot fire anything at all without someone garrisoned there.|$|E
5|$|From a {{starting}} point on the frontier, {{if there is no}} increase in productive resources, increasing production of a first good entails decreasing production of a second, because resources must be transferred to the first and away from the second. Points along the curve describe the tradeoff between the goods. The sacrifice in the production of the second good is called the opportunity cost (because increasing production of the first good entails losing the opportunity to produce some amount of the second). Opportunity cost is measured in the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>units</b> of the second good forgone for one or more units of the first good.|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} a classic multidimensional generalization of the bin packing problem, namely, packing d-dimensional rectangles into the minimum <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>unit</b> cubes. Our two results are: an asymptotic polynomial time approximation scheme for packing d- dimensional cubes into the minimum <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>unit</b> cubes and a {{polynomial time algorithm}} for packing rectangles into at most OPT bins whose sides have length (1 + #), where OPT denotes the minimum <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>unit</b> bins required to pack the rectangles. Both algorithms also achieve the best possible additive constant term. For cubes, this settles the approximability {{of the problem and}} represents a significant improvement over the previous best known asymptotic approximation factor of 2 + #. For rectangles, this contrasts with the currently best known approximation factor of 1. 691... ...|$|R

5|$|Ultimately, the {{voluntary}} system of recruitment proved unable {{to sustain the}} force structure of the AIF, failing to provide sufficient replacements for the heavy casualties it sustained and requiring a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>units</b> to be disbanded {{towards the end of}} the war. In mid-1918 it was decided to allow the men who had enlisted in 1914 to return to Australia for home leave, further exacerbating the manpower shortage experienced by the Australian Corps. Regardless, by the last year of the war the AIF was a long-serving force—even if it was a citizen army and not a professional one like the pre-war British Army—containing 141,557 men with more than two-years service, including, despite the heavy casualties suffered at Gallipoli in 1915 and on the Western Front in 1916 and 1917, 14,653 men who had enlisted in 1914. Battle hardened and experienced as a result, this fact partially explains the important role the AIF subsequently played in the final defeat of the German Army in 1918.|$|E
5|$|Battles use a turn-based battle system, {{with the}} player, enemies, and {{sometimes}} non-playable characters each taking turns and moving across a grid-based battlefield: battles are {{won by the}} player defeating all enemies in a map or killing a boss character. Enemies include human troops and monsters. The players are given a limited <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>units,</b> which are each assigned unique character classes that have various functions in battle, such as being mounted or having access to magic. A unit's class also affects their range of movement on the battlefield. In contrast to the previous game, character classes are not set but can switch once a character reaches a certain level. A special example of class promotion is the two main characters: Alm can promote from a Fighter to a Hero, while Celica promotes from a Priestess to a Princess. Each time a unit raises its experience level, its various stats increase based on a percent chance unique for each character. Spells for magical classes are learned through leveling up rather than {{being part of a}} separate system, and each spell consumes part of the caster's health when used.|$|E
5|$|Each race {{relies on}} two {{resources}} {{to sustain their}} game economies and to build their forces: minerals and vespene gas. Minerals are needed for all units and structures, and are obtained by using a worker unit to harvest the resource directly from mineral nodes scattered around the battlefield. Players require vespene gas to construct advanced units and buildings, and acquire it by constructing a gas extraction building {{on top of a}} geyser and using worker units to extract the gas from it. In addition, players need to regulate the supplies for their forces to ensure that they can construct the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>units</b> they need. Although the nature of the supply differs between the races—Terrans use physical supplies held in depots, Protoss use psionic energy channeled from their homeworld via pylons, and Zerg are regulated by the number of controlling overlord units present—the supply mechanic essentially works {{in exactly the same way}} for each race (just with differing impacts on gameplay), allowing players to create new units when there are sufficient resources to sustain them.|$|E
