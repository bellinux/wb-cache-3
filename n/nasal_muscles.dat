40|$|The hypertrophic {{and much}} {{elongated}} epicranial (nasal) complex of sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus) {{is a unique}} device to increase directionality and source levels of echolocation clicks in aquatic environments. The {{size and shape of}} the nasal fat bodies as well as the peculiar organization of the air sac system in the nasal sound generator of sperm whales are in favour of this proposed specialized acoustic function. The morphology of the sperm whale nose, including a 'connecting acoustic window' in the case and an anterior 'terminal acoustic window' at the rostroventral edge of the junk, supports the 'bent horn hypothesis' of sound emission. In contrast to the laryngeal mechanism described for dolphins and porpoises, sperm whales may drive the initial pulse generation process with air pressurized by <b>nasal</b> <b>muscles</b> associated with the right nasal passage (right nasal passage muscle, maxillonasolabialis muscle). This can be interpreted as an adaptation to deep-diving and high hydrostatic pressures constraining pneumatic phonation. Comparison of nasal structures in sperm whales and other toothed whales reveals that the existing air sac system as well as the fat bodies and the musculature have the same topographical relations and thus may be homologous in all toothed whales (Odontoceti). This implies that the nasal sound generating system evolved only once during toothed whale evolution and, more specifically, that the unique hypertrophied nasal complex was a main driving force {{in the evolution of the}} sperm whale taxon.

40|$|Human {{upper airway}} and facial muscles support breathing, swallowing, speech, mastication, and facial expression, but their {{endurance}} performance in sustained contractions is poorly understood. The muscular fatigue {{typically associated with}} task failure during sustained contractions has both central and intramuscular causes, with the contribution of each believed to be task dependent. Previously we failed to show central fatigue in the <b>nasal</b> dilator <b>muscles</b> of subjects that performed intermittent maximal voluntary contractions (MVCs). Here we test the hypothesis that central mechanisms contribute to the fatigue of submaximal, sustained contractions in <b>nasal</b> dilator <b>muscles.</b> <b>Nasal</b> dilator <b>muscle</b> force and EMG activities were recorded in 11 subjects that performed submaximal contractions (20, 35, and 65 % MVC) until force dropped to ≤ 90 % of the target force for ≥ 3 s, which we defined as task failure. MVC and twitch forces (the latter obtained by applying supramaximal shocks to the facial nerve) were recorded before the trial and at several time points over the first 10 min of recovery. The time to task failure was inversely related to contraction intensity. MVC force was depressed by roughly 30 % at task failure in all three trials, but recovered within 2 min. Twitch force fell by 30 – 44 % depending on contraction intensity and remained depressed after 10 min of recovery, consistent with low-frequency fatigue. Average EMG activity increased with time, but never exceeded 75 % of the maximal, pretrial level despite task failure. EMG mean power frequency declined by 20 – 25 % in all trials, suggesting reduced action potential conduction velocity at task failure. In contrast, the maximal evoked potential did not change significantly {{in any of the}} tasks, indicating that the EMG deficit at task failure was due largely to mechanisms proximal to the neuromuscular junction. Additional experiments using the interpolated twitch technique suggest that subjects can produce about 92 % of the maximal evocable force with this muscle, which is not a large enough deficit to explain the entire shortfall in the EMG at task failure. These data show that the nervous system fails to fully activate the <b>nasal</b> dilator <b>muscles</b> during sustained, submaximal contractions; putative mechanisms are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The nasal {{region of}} the skull has {{undergone}} dramatic changes {{during the course of}} cetacean evolution. In particular, mysticetes (baleen whales) conserve the nasal mammalian pattern associated with the secondary function of olfaction, and lack the sound-producing specializations present in odontocetes (toothed whales, dolphins and porpoises). To improve our understanding of the morphology of the nasal region of mysticetes, we investigate the nasal anatomy, osteology and myology of the southern right whale, Eubalaena australis, and make comparisons with other mysticetes. In E. australis external deflection surfaces around the blowholes appear to divert water off the head, and differ in appearance from those observed in balaenopterids, eschrichtiids and cetotherids. In E. australis the blowholes are placed above hypertrophied nasal soft tissues formed by fat and <b>nasal</b> <b>muscles,</b> a pattern also observed in balaenopterids (rorqual mysticetes) and a cetotherid (pygmy right whale, Caperea marginata). Blowhole movements are due to the action of five nasofacial muscles: dilator naris superficialis, dilator naris profundus, depressor alae nasi, constrictor naris, and retractor alae nasi. The dilator naris profundus found in E. australis has not been previously reported in balaenopterids. The other nasofacial muscles have a similar arrangement in balaenopterids, with minor differences. A novel structure, not reported previously in any mysticete, is the presence of a vascular tissue (rete mirabile) covering the lower nasal passage. This vascular tissue could play a role in warming inspired air, or may engorge to accommodate loss of respiratory space volume due to gas compression from increased pressure during diving.

40|$|To {{examine the}} {{characteristics}} of excyclotropia correction through surgery on the inferior rectus muscle in patients with thyroid eye disease. This was a retrospective, observational study at a single institution. We reviewed 36 patients who had undergone unilateral inferior rectus muscle recession, with or without <b>nasal</b> inferior rectus <b>muscle</b> transposition. The following factors were investigated as possibly influencing excyclotropia correction: inferior rectus muscle thickness, degree of adipose change in the inferior rectus muscle, smoking status, history of orbital radiotherapy, {{and the amount of}} inferior rectus muscle recession. Using T 1 -weighted coronal magnetic resonance imaging, we measured the cross-sectional area of the inferior rectus muscle at its largest point, as well as the bright-signal area of the inferior rectus muscle, which reflects intermuscular adipose change. We then calculated the percentage internal bright-signal area at the point of the largest inferior rectus muscle cross-sectional area. The history of orbital radiotherapy was graded using a binary system. We evaluated correlations among excyclotropia correction, the amount of <b>nasal</b> inferior rectus <b>muscle</b> transposition, and the possible influencing factors listed, using stepwise multiple regression analyses. The multiple regression model demonstrated a significant relationship among excyclotropia correction, amount of <b>nasal</b> inferior rectus <b>muscle</b> transposition, and the amount of inferior rectus muscle recession (YCORRECTION = 8. 546 XTENDON WIDTH + 0. 405 XRECESSION- 0. 908; r = 0. 844; adjusted r 2 = 0. 695; P < 0. 001).

40|$|Because of its {{particular}} location, the nose {{is an extremely}} important anatomical region,given its prominent rolein social interaction. Therefore, invasive surgery of the nose should be followed by reconstructive procedure that should seek to respect its morphological and aesthetic features as much as possible.

40|$|Ten healthy {{subjects}} exercised on a cycle ergometer at 60, 120, and 150 - 180 W while breathing nasally. Nasal inspiratory flow, <b>nasal</b> dilator <b>muscle</b> (alae nasi; A. N.)

In both protocols, 12 - 15 breaths of a He:O₂ (79 : 21 %) gas mixture were substituted surreptitiously for air under each condition. He:O₂ breathing resulted in a decrease in flow turbulence and intranasal pressure, and therefore, resistance, as indicated by lower calculated Reynold's numbers. He:O₂ evoked an increase in nasal inspiratory flow, and reductions in nasal pressure and A. N. EMG activities (25 - 50 %) at each work rate. These results suggest that A. N. EMG during exercise is controlled by increases in intranasal pressure, not by nasal flow. Thus, the data suggest that sensory information from pressure sensitive nasal receptors in the nasal lumen serve to modulate A. N. EMG activities during exercise...|$|R
40|$|Aims: To {{evaluate}} {{the effects of}} mild hyperoxia on sympathetic activity during quiet breathing in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) and, hence, to investigate whether tonic activation of excitatory chemoreceptor afferents contributes to the elevated sympathetic activity in these patients. Sympathetic activation in patients with CHF may result in part from increased chemoreflex sensitivity. Previous studies using microneurography did not demonstrate deactiva-tion of the chemoreceptors while the patients were breathing 100 % O 2. However, 100 % O 2 may decrease cardiac output, thereby offsetting the effects on the chemoreflexes. Setting: University hospital.

40|$|The {{regulation}} of the aldo-keto reductase AKR 7 A 1 was examined in the livers {{of male and female}} rats during development by using Western blots, and its contribution to carbonyl metabolism was assessed by using enzyme assays. Hepatic levels of AKR 7 A 1 are low in fetal rats and rise to a peak at around 6 weeks of age in animals of both sexes. Higher levels of the enzyme are found in adult male rat liver than in adult female rat liver. The reductase, therefore, appears to be subject to sex-specific regulation. The effect of growth hormone in mediating this difference in expression was examined by using hypophysectomized animals whose serum growth hormone levels had been feminized by continuous administration. Results demonstrate that such treatment leads to a reduction in AKR 7 A 1 expression. AKR 7 A 1 was found to be constitutively expressed in rat tissues such as liver, kidney, small intestine, and testis, but it was not detected in <b>nasal</b> mucosa, skeletal <b>muscle,</b> heart, adrenal gland, brain, or spleen. However, AKR 7 A 1 was inducible by the synthetic antioxidant ethoxyquin in liver, kidney, and small intestine, but not in the other tissues examined.

Substance P {{was added to}} cultured adenoid at concentrations of 10 - 1 °, 10 - 8, 10 - 6, and 10 - 4 mol/L. Ciliary beat frequency was determined with phase-contrast microscopy and microphotometry. Substance P increased ciliary beat frequency a maximum of 11. 9 % ± 3. 8 % [p < 0. 01). Diclofenac [10 - 6 mol/L] significantly blocked the ciliostimulatory effects of SP (p < 0. 022], indicating that prostaglandin synthesis is an intermediate step in the action of substance P on ciliary beat frequency. The L-arginine analogs, N°-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester and N~-monomethyl-L-arginine, inhibit nitric oxide synthesis from L-arginine. k-Arginine analogs [10 - 4 to 10 - 2 mol/L] inhibited the effect of substance P [p < 0. 02 at the higher concentration].

40|$|Myasthenia Gravis is a {{specific}} autoimmune disease of the postsynaptic membrane of the neuromuscular junction. In {{the area of the}} neuromuscular synapse, there is a blockage of the acetylcholine’s receptors, which disables the creation of muscle action potential and transmission of the signal from the neuron to the muscle. The blockage is due to presence of antibodies on the acetylcholine’s receptors. Objective of the study is to trace the impact of the applied neurorehabilitation in a case of generalized adult form of myasthenia gravis. Sources and methods The subject of the case is a 30 years old female patient with generalized adult form of myasthenia gravis (medium severe form). Clinical symptoms started with fatigue which appeared during the day, absent in the morning. Later were developed ptosis and diplopia, difficulty in speech, chewing and swallowing, <b>nasal</b> speech, <b>muscle</b> weakness in upper and lower extremities. Neurorehabilitation is appointed for period of 6 weeks in home condition, including medicament therapy – acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, Prostigmin, ordinated 15 mg per os, corticosteroids and kinesitherapy 3 times a week with duration of one hour with medium intensity of the load, with a rest between the separate exercises, without reaching tiredness. Also, breathing exercises, passive-active exercises, analytical exercises for upper and lower extremities, exercises for improvement of the muscle strength, balance and coordination in siting and standing exercises and massages are being used. Muscle weakness test are being used to follow the effect of the applied therapy – MMT, measuring the volume of the muscles with centimeters, Bal’s score of subjective complains – pain, squats per minute. The changes in patient’s motoric activities are checked twice in home condition rehabilitation. Results and discussion By measuring the muscle volume in centimeters and the muscle weakness test – MMT, improvement of muscle volume and strength were noticed, due to the systematical procedures of kinesitherapy and strength exercises for upper and lower extremities. The score of subjective complains is lower with decreasing of the pain and significantly improved results in the test of squats per minute, due to the improved strength of the lower extremities. Conclusion The efficiency of the directed and structured exercises is proved by the improvement of the functionality, aerobic capacity for exercising and muscle strength. The biggest benefit is reached by combined complex medicament therapy and multidisciplinary rehabilitation, in order to lower the clinical symptoms of the disease, lower the functional deficits and improvement of the functional performances. When properly directed and dosed, neurorehabilitation can prevent the secondary health issues like obesity, coronary heart disease and osteoporosis.

40|$|Snoring is {{traditionally}} considered {{more of a}} social nuisance than disease. The observation that nasal obstruction may modify breathing during sleep and daytime behavior and our clinical observations suggesting that some single snorer patients who had undergone surgery of the nasal valve for nasal obstruction complaints had presented a decrease in their snoring, led us to make a retrospective study on twenty nine patients. Eight of them were simple snorers. They underwent a surgery of the nasal valve under general anesthesia through an open septorhinoplasty during which lateral graft cartilages (modified spreader grafts) were set in place between septolateral cartilage and the anterior and superior edge of the nasal septum. Active anterior rhinomanometry (AAR), posterior active rhinomanometry (PAR) and a self-assessment of the nasal patency by the patient himself on a visual analog scale (VAS) were compared before and one year after surgery. Snoring was assessed by both bed partners according to a four step scale (none, slight, moderate and severe). No {{significant differences were found}} between AAR or between PAR. But significant differences were measured with VAS (for the left (p < 0. 0001) and the right sides (p < 0. 001). All patients but one demonstrated substantially decreased snoring. As there is no clear cut evidence of changes in nasal resistances measured by rhinomanometry, we suggest that the observed decrease in snoring may be induced by changes in the direction of the nasal airflow against the nasal mucosa which may produce by a reflex between mecanoreceptors of the <b>nasal</b> mucosa and <b>muscles</b> of the pharynx, an increased tonus of the muscles of the pharynx...|$|R
40|$|Purpose - Anterior segment optical {{coherent}} tomography (AS-OCT) is used {{to further}} examine previous reports that ciliary muscle thickness (CMT) is increased in myopic eyes. With reference to temporal and nasal CMT, interrelationships between biometric and morphological characteristics of anterior and posterior segments are analysed for British-White and British-South-Asian adults with and without myopia. Methods - Data are presented for the right eyes of 62 subjects (British-White n = 39, British-South-Asian n = 23, aged 18 – 40 years) {{with a range of}} refractive error (mean spherical error (MSE (D)) - 1. 74 ± 3. 26; range - 10. 06 to + 4. 38) and separated into myopes (MSE (D) <- 0. 50, range - 10. 06 to - 0. 56; n = 30) and non-myopes (MSE (D) =- 0. 50, - 0. 50 to + 4. 38; n = 32). Temporal and <b>nasal</b> ciliary <b>muscle</b> cross-sections were imaged using a Visante AS-OCT. Using Visante software, manual measures of nasal and temporal CMT (NCMT and TCMT respectively) were taken in successive posterior 1 mm steps from the scleral spur over a 3 mm distance (designated NCMT 1, TCMT 1 et seq). Measures of axial length and anterior chamber depth were taken with an IOLMaster biometer. MSE and corneal curvature (CC) measurements were taken with a Shin-Nippon auto-refractor. Magnetic resonance imaging was used to determine total ocular volume (OV) for 31 of the original subject group. Statistical comparisons and analyses were made using mixed repeated measures anovas, Pearson's correlation coefficient and stepwise forward multiple linear regression. Results - MSE was significantly associated with CMT, with thicker CMT 2 and CMT 3 being found in the myopic eyes (p = 0. 002). In non-myopic eyes TCMT 1, TCMT 2, NCMT 1 and NCMT 2 correlated significantly with MSE, AL and OV (p < 0. 05). In contrast, myopic eyes failed generally to exhibit a significant correlation between CMT, MSE and axial length but notably retained a significant correlation between OV, TCMT 2, TCMT 3, NCMT 2 and NCMT 3 (p < 0. 05). OV was found to be a significantly better predictor of TCMT 2 and TCMT 3 than AL by approximately a factor of two (p < 0. 001). Anterior chamber depth was significantly associated with both temporal and nasal CMT 2 and CMT 3; TCMT 1 correlated positively with CC. Ethnicity had no significant effect on differences in CMT. Conclusions - Increased CMT is associated with myopia. We speculate that the lack of correlation in myopic subjects between CMT and axial length, but not between CMT and OV, is evidence that disrupted feedback between the fovea and ciliary apparatus occurs in myopia development...|$|R
40|$|The primary aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{investigate}} in-vivo changes to ocular morphology during ocular accommodation, with particular attention to ciliary muscle changes, using pharmacological agents and physiological stimuli. To determine the optimum target for accommodation studies, accommodative responses to different stimuli were investigated. Insignificant differences in accommodative responses to a letter target and Maltese cross were found. Anterior Segment Optical Coherence Tomography (AS-OCT) and semi-automated software were used for in-vivo investigation of ciliary muscle morphology. As expected, anti-muscarinic agents reduced the accommodative amplitude, the greatest effect evident with cyclopentolate hydrochloride 1 %, which was, in turn, associated with a reduced forward movement of the ciliary muscle, possibly due to the restricted movement of radial and longitudinal fibres. Pilocarpine nitrate 2 % induced a contractile shortening and anterior thickening of the ciliary muscle in both pre-presbyopic and presbyopic eyes. However, pilocarpine {{does not seem to}} be a super-stimulus for accommodation. Comparison between cyclopentolate and pilocarpine ciliary muscle morphology further supported the concept that anterior movement of ciliary muscle mass is essential to elicit higher accommodative amplitudes. Ciliary muscle asymmetry was identified between horizontal and vertical meridians. The findings confirmed a longer ciliary muscle in axial elongated eyes, however, only within the temporal, <b>nasal,</b> and superior <b>muscle</b> quadrants. Nevertheless, during accommodation, anterior thickening and contractile shortening of the muscle was evident for all four quadrants. The effect of accommodation on posterior eye conformation revealed a homogenous elongation of the posterior pole, with the greatest expansion occurring along the inferior-nasal quadrant, rather than the visual axis. The possibility of a vitreous role in accommodation is discussed. The studies presented herein suggest a forward movement of ciliary muscle mass is necessary for accommodation. Further research is required to establish whether a mechanical restriction occurs to the muscle with increasing age, resulting in presbyopia. Moreover, investigations are required to explore the variation in ciliary muscle morphology in eyes with ametropia, as well as the likely role of the vitreous in accommodation...|$|R
40|$|The {{principal}} {{theme of}} this thesis is the in vivo examination of ocular morphological changes during phakic accommodation, with particular attention paid to the ciliary muscle and crystalline lens. The investigations detailed involved the application of high-resolution imaging techniques to facilitate the acquisition of new data {{to assist in the}} clarification of aspects of the accommodative system that were poorly understood. A clinical evaluation of the newly available Grand Seiko Auto Ref/ Keratometer WAM- 5500 optometer was undertaken to assess its value in the field of accommodation research. The device was found to be accurate and repeatable compared to subjective refraction, and has the added advantage of allowing dynamic data collection at a frequency of around 5 Hz. All of the subsequent investigations applied the WAM- 5500 for determination of refractive error and objective accommodative responses. Anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) based studies examined the morphology and contractile response of youthful and ageing ciliary <b>muscle.</b> <b>Nasal</b> versus temporal asymmetry was identified, with the temporal aspect being both thicker and demonstrating a greater contractile response. The ciliary muscle was longer in terms of both its anterior (r = 0. 49, P < 0. 001) and overall length (r = 0. 45, P = 0. 02) characteristics, in myopes. The myopic ciliary muscle {{does not appear to be}} merely stretched during axial elongation, as no significant relationship between thickness and refractive error was identified. The main contractile responses observed were a thickening of the anterior region and a shortening of the muscle, particularly anteriorly. Similar patterns of response were observed in subjects aged up to 70 years, supporting a lensocentric theory of presbyopia development. Following the discovery of nasal/ temporal asymmetry in ciliary muscle morphology and response, an investigation was conducted to explore whether the regional variations in muscle contractility impacted on lens stability during accommodation. A bespoke programme was developed to analyse AS-OCT images and determine whether lens tilt and decentration varied between the relaxed and accommodated states. No significant accommodative difference in these parameters was identified, implying that any changes in lens stability with accommodation are very slight, as a possible consequence of vitreous support. Novel three-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and analysis techniques were used to investigate changes in lens morphology and ocular conformation during accommodation. An accommodative reduction in lens equatorial diameter provides further evidence to support the Helmholtzian mechanism of accommodation, whilst the observed increase in lens volume challenges the widespread assertion that this structure is incompressible due to its high water content. Wholeeye MRI indicated that the volume of the vitreous chamber remains constant during accommodation. No significant changes in ocular conformation were detected using MRI. The investigations detailed provide further insight into the mechanisms of accommodation and presbyopia, and represent a platform for future work in this field.

40|$|A respiratory, {{resonator}} and articulatory organ, nose is {{an important}} organ for human health. During inhalation and exhalation, nose makes the weather humid, warms it and enables the sound to become peculiar to the person, aerating the ears. Nose is an organ which provides speech {{and the production of}} sound. Nasal cavity aids the resonation and amplification of the primary sound that forms in cricoarytenoid <b>muscles.</b> <b>Nasal</b> voices are the sounds in which oral cavity is completely blocked,and the air is allowed to go out through nasal cavity. /m/,/n/ letters are in that group (Altundağ, 2008; 11). The complaint about nasal obstruction {{is one of the reasons}} for application with which the doctors of ear, nose and throat are faced often times. Sound is negatively influenced by the nasal obstruction resulting fromanatomical problems (Ö. Koç, 2008; 6). In such cases as the obstructions in the nasal cavity and nasopharynx or abnormal structural situations, the obstruction of sound transmission leadsto deficit in the oral and nasal resonation in the course of the transmission of sound through nasal cavity (Kummer and Lee, 1996; 272). Rhinolalia (nasal dysfunction and rhinophonia) is a speechof pathology arising out of the breakdown of nasal resonation. (Ö. Koç, 2008; 14 - 15). They can be seen in three forms. Hyper nasality (rhinolalia aperture) is the breakdown of resonation resulting from the velopharyngeal insufficiency. Freezing can be detected especially in famous voices notably in hyper nasality because these voices are uttered for a long time (Kummer and Lee, 1996; 272). Hypo nasality (rhinolalia cause) is called the insufficiency of nasal resonation. The nasal obstruction leading to such an abnormality results from such pathologies as upper respiratory infection, nasal structural deficits and nasal tumours (Enver and Akan, 1995; 122). Rhinolaryngitis is the case in which hyper and hypo nasality can be seen together. Velopharyngeal insufficiency and nasal pathologies and the blockage of a mass to denture in nasopharynx cause the mixed type. Resonation cannot be seen in nasal sounds (Aktaran: Çağlar, 2006; 8). Since nose is a resonator organ, the structural deficits in it such as symptom deviation, concha hypertrophy, nasal valve narrowness, symptom perforation, symptom hematoma and abscess, nasoseptitis deformity and choanal atresia all lead to nasal obstruction and respiratory defection and resonation breakdown. Symptom deviation forms as a result of the breakage of the nose from the centre to the right or left. Deviation continues to form generally based on trauma and congenital (Yılmaz, 2002; 55). The most significant symptom of deviation is nasal obstruction. Due to nasal obstruction and the air not warming, not dampening or not being cleared, respiratory illnesses such as angina, pharyngitis, laryngitis, bronchitis…etc. come in to existence. Sinus nasal cavities could become blocked owing to deviation and for that reason, sinusitis might develop. Concha hypertrophy which can be seen with chronic hypertrophic rhino sinusitis, allergic rhinitis or symptom deviation is one of the most important reasons for obstruction (Köybaşıand Yılmaz, 2005; 115). The symptoms of the disease can be seen with general nose stiffening, respiratory difficulty, and the necessity to inhale and exhale through mouth, sleep deficits accompanying snoring. (Fethallah, 2005; 20). Nasal valve region is the region where respiratory passage is the narrowest and nasal resonation is the highest. Nasal valve iscalled the distance between septum and upper lateral cartilage. Patients complain about the nasal obstruction. Other symptoms are helminthiasis and bleeding. Septum perforation is the case in which mucoperichondrium and cartilage get exposed to inflammation. Nasal dryness, nasal stiffening, frequent crusting, action of creating whistle during respiration can be seen in the patients. Perforation affects the air passage in the nasal resonation. Septum hematom arises as a consequence of the bleeding in-between trauma and septum plates. If septum hematom is not treated, it will turn into abscess with infection. The symptomsof septum hematom are nasal stiffening, flix, nose ache and nasal weakness. Patients feel nasal swelling, headache and edema when abscess happens (Somdaş, 2005). Bilateral pleural involvement, which is most often seen in congenital nasal abnormality, can be encountered once in every 8000 living births. During the early period of development, noseis separated from pharynx with biconasal membrane. When this membrane does not disappear, it will cover posterior coanal bleeding. In the structural deficits of nose, acoustical Rhinometryis use in order to determine nasal cavity volume. As a result ofacoustical Rhinometry measurements, minimal cutting areas and selected point volume can be measured in that way. The parameters such as acoustical sound frequency, vibration and periodicity are analysed. 40 first class students who read Selcuk University education faculty fine arts music major branch have been included in the study. So as to obtain data from all the students, they were asked to fill in personal information form and nasal obstruction scala. Acoustical Rhinometry together with phonatory skills measurements were applied on these studentsby the interested experts. Descriptive statistical methods (average, standard deviation) and Mann-Whitney U test were used for the evaluation of these data. 40 first class students who read Selcuk University education faculty fine arts music major branch have been included in the study. In this study, it is aimed that the sound education can be modified in the faculty of music over the sentence “How are the sound features of the people with nasal structure deficits?” As a result of examination in ear, nose and throat major branches at the faculty of medicine at Selcuk University, septum deviation was detected in 12 students, concha hypertrophy 6 students, septum deviation and concha hypertrophy 7 students. Besides, 15 students were detected to be free of nasal defection. Because the students of BYBB have low points at NOSE, the diseases like septum deviation and conca hypertrophy narrow the nasal cavity volume, influencing phonatory talents negatively. It has been identified that the acoustic properties of the sound frequencies of the fundamental frequency F 0 and formant F 1, F 2, F 3, F 4, F 5 values did not differ significantly among the students of BYBS BYBB. When the arithmetic average related to the formant frequencies of the acoustical features of sound has beenanalysed in the students participating in the study, it is determined that (F 3) formant is for the singer. At the courses giving a professional music education, voice education methods should be developed, based on the anatomical features of the organs working in constitution of voice and the structural breakdowns in such organs with their effects. Ear nose throat doctors should maintain the studies with audiologists on the basis of the thought that voice education is disciplinary. Professional voice users must learn how to sustain their voice health and take precautions against illnesses, giving importanceto hygiene. It is thought that this study will be much more convenient for a larger group in terms of statistics...|$|R
