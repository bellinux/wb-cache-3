25|$|Investigators {{believe that}} Hughes entered {{an area of}} deteriorating weather with low {{visibility}} and lost his visual reference with the ground.

40|$|The free wing/free trimmer {{concept was}} {{analytically}} studied in order to: (1) compare the {{fore and aft}} trimmer configurations {{on the basis of}} equal lift capability, rather than equal area; (2) assess the influence of tip mounted aft trimmers, both free and fixed, on the lateral directional modes and turbulence responses; (3) examine the feasibility of using differential tip mounted trimmer deflection for lateral control; (4) determine the effects of independent fuselage attitude on the lateral directional behavior; and (5) estimate the influence of wing sweep on dynamic behavior and structural weight. Results indicate that the forward trimmer concept is feasible with the reduced size examined, but it remains inferior to the aft trimmer in every respect except structural weight. Differential motion of the aft trimmer is found to provide powerful lateral control; while the effect of fuselage deck angle is a reduction of the dutch roll damping ratio for <b>nose-down</b> <b>attitudes...</b>|$|R

25|$|The Camel {{proved to}} have better {{manoeuvrability}} than the Albatros D.III and D.V and offered heavier armament and better performance than the Pup and Triplane.

25|$|Lloyd {{selected}} the Armstrong Siddeley Tiger IX radial engine {{to power the}} Whitley, which was capable of generating 795 horsepower. One of the more innovative features of the Whitley's design was {{the adoption of a}} three-bladed two-position variable-pitch propeller built by de Havilland; the Whitley was the first aircraft to fly with such an arrangement. As Lloyd was unfamiliar with the use of flaps on a large heavy monoplane, they were initially omitted from the design. To compensate, the mid-set wings were set at a high angle of incidence (8.5°) to confer good take-off and landing performance. Although flaps were included late in the design stage, the wing remained unaltered; as a result, the Whitley flew with a pronounced <b>nose-down</b> <b>attitude</b> when flown with the wings in the cruising position, resulting in considerable drag.|$|E

40|$|During {{the summer}} of 2015, NASA Langley Research Center {{conducted}} three full-scale crash tests of Cessna 172 (C- 172) aircraft at the NASA Langley Landing and Impact Research (LandIR) Facility.

The third test, also conducted onto soil, represented a CFIT with a nose-up pitch attitude of the aircraft, which resulted in a tail strike condition. These three crash tests were performed for the purpose of evaluating the performance of Emergency Locator Transmitters (ELTs) and to generate impact test data for model validation.

25|$|Reading {{the control}} yoke {{data from the}} FDR {{revealed}} that the pilots made a crucial error by pulling back on the control yoke throughout the dive with the stick-shaker audible on the CVR from {{the onset of the}} dive. This raised the aircraft's angle of attack, removed all aileron authority, prevented recovery from the roll induced by the rudder, and caused an aerodynamic stall. Because the aircraft had entered a slip, pulling back on the yoke only aggravated the bank angle further. Boeing's test pilots reenacted the fatal dive in both a simulator, as well as a test 737-300 by flying the same parameters on the accident FDR, and found that recovery from a fully deflected rudder at level flight, while at 190 knot crossover speed, was accomplished by turning the wheel to the opposite direction of the roll, and not pulling back on the yoke to regain aileron authority. The NTSB remarked that no airline had ever trained a pilot on the proper recovery technique for the situation experienced by the pilots and that the pilots had just 10 seconds from the onset of the roll to troubleshoot before recovery of the aircraft was impossible. The FDR revealed that after the aircraft stalled, it along with the crew and passengers were subjected up to a 4g load throughout the dive until impact with the ground in an 80 degree <b>nose-down</b> <b>attitude</b> traveling at approximately 300mph under significant sideslip.|$|E

2500|$|All {{wreckage}} {{was found}} along a 209 metre long, 50 metre wide {{section of the}} seabed {{at a depth of}} 78 metres. Investigators found no evidence of structural failure inflight. The damage to the aircraft was roughly symmetrical left-to-right, indicating the aircraft was close to wings-level flight on impact. The separation of the left landing gear leg compared to the bending of the right leg suggested to investigators that impact with the water happened with the left wing slightly lower than the right, as the left gear was the more damaged, and therefore subject to more force against the water. When the left wingtip contacted the water, investigators conclude that the aircraft cartwheeled, bringing the right wing down into the water with great force, which they report as being consistent with the nose gear being bent to the right as well as aft. The pattern of damage to the nose and the underside of the fuselage suggests the aircraft was in a slightly <b>nose-down</b> <b>attitude,</b> as if in a normal descent. Nearly neutral trim settings indicated the pilot was not trying to compensate for some abnormal flying condition, such as an engine failure or flight control problems. The pitch trim was set to a slight <b>nose-down</b> <b>attitude,</b> which the aircraft manufacturer calculated to indicate stable flight at 110–120 kts. This is consistent with investigators' calculations based on the damage to the aircraft that it had been moving at 90–130 kts at impact. Damage to the propeller blades is consistent with both of them turning and similar engine power being delivered to them. The amount of power being delivered to the propellers could not be determined. Therefore, it remains possible that ice had accumulated in the carburetors and reduced engine power. Although meteorological conditions were favorable for carburetor icing, and the carburetor heat levers were in the [...] "OFF" [...] position, loss of engine power is not consistent with the speed and shallow angle of impact calculated from the wreckage.
