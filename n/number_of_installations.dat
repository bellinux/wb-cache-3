5|$|There were {{a number}} of {{development}} schemes for the head including a major railway and docks scheme proposed in 1885, proposals for housing and a golf course were also put forward before World War I, though none of these schemes came to fruition. In 1919 the head was sold by Sir George Meyrick to Harry Gordon Selfridge with plans to construct a grand house. These plans also came to nothing, apart from the establishment of a nursery garden. Bournemouth Borough Council purchased the head in 1930 for £25,200; although plans for housing existed west of double dykes, the head itself was to be kept as public open space. During World War II the head was closed to the public and was occupied by the army, becoming home to a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>installations</b> including a radar station. The area was also extensively mined. The head was finally cleared of the military defences by the 1950s.|$|E

25|$|From the beginning, {{questions}} of hygiene posed {{a problem in}} the camps, built in haste. The goal was to quickly build a maximum <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>installations,</b> which relegated sanitary considerations to the back burner. Camps in Germany featured only a simple faucet in the yard for thousands of people. Very often, latrines consisted of a simple board with a hole in the middle above a pit, which the prisoners were tasked with emptying at regular intervals. Because of their basic construction, the toilets often overflowed during powerful rains, making an unbreathable atmosphere prevail in the camps. Moreover, the clayey soil turned to muck from the first rains.|$|E
25|$|Computer games {{sometimes}} use DRM {{technologies to}} limit the number of systems the game can be installed on by requiring authentication with an online server. Most games with this restriction allow three or five installs, although some allow an installation to be 'recovered' when the game is uninstalled. This not only limits users who have more than three or five computers in their homes (seeing as the rights of the software developers allow them {{to limit the}} <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>installations),</b> but can also prove to be a problem if the user has to unexpectedly perform certain tasks like upgrading operating systems or reformatting the computer's hard drive, tasks which, depending on how the DRM is implemented, count a game's subsequent reinstall as a new installation, making the game potentially unusable after a certain period even if it is only used on a single computer.|$|E

Wilson, PC Magazine software analyst. He appreciated the product's one-click repair feature and the subsequent reduction in his test PC's boot-time. However, Wilson criticized the software license that only permits installation on three PCs, contrasting it with Iolo System Mechanic 10, a competing product that allows an unlimited <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>installations</b> in the same household.|$|E

In 1978, the focus of the fair was changed to horses, creating the first Feria Internacional del Caballo (International Fair of the Horse), for which a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>installations</b> were built such as a bullring, an open-air theatre, a kiosk, stables, corrals, music stage and exhibition halls. This version of the festival has been successful and held yearly ever since. [...] The Feria occurs at the end of March and includes musical shows, cockfights, open-air theatre and expositions of livestock, commerce and crafts, with one of the main events being bullfighting.

40|$|International audienceIn this paper, {{we study}} the {{wireless}} sensor network deployment for water pollution monitoring in the Amazon rainforest rivers. Our objective consists in minimising the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> deployed geographical field installations along the river, while ensuring the detection of the substance spilled in the given river regardless {{of the position of}} its source. A geographical field installation is formed by a set of barrier coverage underwater sensors which detect the pollutant if its molarity in the water is greater than a predefined threshold. Indeed, the substance molarity is inversely proportional to the moving distance. To generate the best topology, we propose a sub-optimal novel geographic Installation Field Deployment Algorithm based on the Backtracking heuristic named BT-FIDA. Since the river has a several forks, {{in order to reduce the}} <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>installation</b> fields, BT-FIDA minimises the rate of at least 2 -covered river segments. The simulation results obtained show that our proposal minimises the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> field <b>installations</b> (i. e., deployment cost) while minimising the rate of areas which are miss-covered and over-covered...|$|R
