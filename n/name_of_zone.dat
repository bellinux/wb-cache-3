30|$|Surface failure {{models are}} known by <b>name</b> <b>of</b> {{cohesive}} <b>zone</b> models (CZMs). In the latter case, continuum is enriched with discontinuities along surfaces—cohesive zones—with additional traction-displacement-separation constitutive laws. These laws are built qualitatively as follows: traction increases up {{to a maximum}} and then goes down to zero via increasing separation (Barenblatt 1959; Camacho and Ortiz 1996; de Borst 2001; Gong et al. 2012; Moes et al. 1999; Needleman 1987; Park et al. 2009; Rice and Wang 1989; Tvergaard and Hutchinson 1992; Xu and Needleman 1994). If {{the location of the}} separation surface is known in advance (e.g., fracture along weak interfaces) then the use of CZM is natural. Otherwise, the insertion of cracks in the bulk {{in the form of the}} separation surfaces remains an open problem, which includes definition of the criteria for crack nucleation, orientation, branching and arrest. Besides, the CZM approach presumes the simultaneous use of two different constitutive models: one for the cohesive zone and another for the bulk, for the same real material. Certainly, a correspondence between these two constitutive theories is desirable yet not promptly accessible. The issues concerning the CZM approach have been discussed by Needleman (2014), the pioneer of the field.|$|R
