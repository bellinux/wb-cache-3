25|$|The most {{defining}} {{property of}} modernity, according to Giddens, {{is that we}} are disembedded from time and space. In pre-modern societies, space was the area in which one moved, time was the experience one had while moving. In modern societies, however, the social space is no longer confined by the boundaries set by the space in which one moves. One can now imagine what other spaces look like, even if he has <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>there.</b> In this regard, Giddens talks about virtual space and virtual time. Another distinctive property of modernity lies in the field of knowledge.|$|E
500|$|For {{the next}} fifty years, the zoo {{served as a}} {{showcase}} of large animals from far away places, appealing {{to a sense of}} wonder. An estimated one million people visited the Prospect Park Zoo annually prior to World War II, but attendance gradually declined, reaching about a half million by the early 1980s. Around this time, the facility showed signs of deterioration. Writing in New York Magazine in late 1970, writer Erik Sanberg-Diment termed the zoo the 'rattiest' in New York – [...] "in the literal sense of the word. (I've <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>there</b> without seeing several rodents romping in the bear lair)". He reported that 'Vultch', a Southern United States black vulture {{which was one of the}} zoo's earliest residents [...] "…is still there, looking down his beak at visitors littering the walks, and celebrating his 35th anniversary in the same old cage." ...|$|E
500|$|After Thorpe's {{funeral was}} held at St. Benedict's Catholic Church in Shawnee, Oklahoma, his body was lying in state at Fairview Cemetery after {{citizens}} had paid to have it moved to Shawnee by train from California. The people were in a fund-raising effort to erect a permanent monument and burial place for Thorpe at the town's Athletic Park. Local officials had asked the state legislature for funding but were turned down, so they doubled their efforts {{to raise the money}} on their own. Meanwhile, Thorpe's third wife, unbeknownst to the rest of his family, [...] "stole" [...] Thorpe's body and had it shipped to Pennsylvania when she heard that the small Pennsylvania towns of Mauch Chunk and East Mauch Chunk were seeking to attract business. She made a deal with officials which, according to Thorpe's son Jack, was done by Patricia for monetary considerations. The towns bought Thorpe's remains, erected a monument to him, merged, and renamed the newly united town in his honor Jim Thorpe, Pennsylvania, even though Thorpe had <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>there.</b> The monument site contains his tomb, two statues of him in athletic poses, and historical markers describing his life story.|$|E

2500|$|The working {{title for}} the first track [...] "Intro" [...] is [...] "Attempted Assassination". Papoose said he was using the song [...] "more as a {{preparing}} the listener for what type of album, what type of experience they [...] about to have. I’m just basically setting the stage then an interlude." [...] The intro features samples from Barack Obama and Martin Luther King Jr. speeches. The third track [...] "Mother Ghetto" [...] is about loving and representing where you are from. Papoose being from Brooklyn, New York he said the song will give you and inside look to the city {{even if you have}} <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>there.</b> Papoose would say his Mobb Deep collaboration [...] "Aim, Shoot" [...] was recorded in 2012 even through the feud that went on between members Havoc and Prodigy. He also said they all recorded the song in the studio at the same time.|$|E
2500|$|One defendant, Barbier, who had {{previously}} admitted playing {{an active part in}} the events of the 17 August, totally retracted his evidence and claimed he had <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>there.</b> Despite the efforts of the court, it was impossible to get from him anything other than abject denials. A French worker, Vernet, supposedly stabbed in the stomach and the side by an Italian, had not answered a witness summons. The prosecutor sent for him by telegraph. The following day, a 30-year-old Vernet was called to the stand and asked if he had been stabbed. He replied, [...] "I wasn't stabbed. I didn't even go to the saltpans at Aigues-Mortes." [...] Asked if he was, indeed, Vernet from Saint-Laurent-du-Pont, he replied [...] "Certainly, but I'm a telegram postman in Grenoble and I have never set foot in the saltpans. I know another Vernet in Saint-Laurent-du-Pont and it's my uncle, a man of fifty years, a cultivater who has never left the land." [...] The court decided that someone had given a false name.|$|E
