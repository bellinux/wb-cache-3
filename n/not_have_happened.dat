Scully claims he shot her, while Mulder claims she shot him. Mulder realizes that that could <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> and stands up. The illusion is broken, and the two leave the house. Maurice and Lyda sit by the fire, holding hands, saying that they almost had the two agents. Meanwhile, at Mulder's apartment, Mulder and Scully exchange gifts, even though they told each other they would not.|$|E
5|$|While still a three-year-old, he was {{exported}} to England {{where he was}} registered in the General Stud Book. He was imported by Richard Croker, {{at a cost of}} about 8000 guineas. Americus' importation to England occurred before the imposition of the Jersey Act, which allowed him and his offspring to be registered in the General Stud Book, something that would <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> had he been imported into England after 1913, due to the Jersey Act's prohibition on registering horses tracing to Lexington in the General Stud Book.|$|E

It is argued that, because the USSR was unable to do this, the United States should have also been unable to develop the technology to do so.|$|E

25|$|Investigators {{also note}} that Robert Young, the {{traveling}} companion with whom victim Russell Nelson was visiting Chicago {{at the time of}} his disappearance in October 1977, gave differing accounts of the youth's disappearance to both Nelson's family and investigators. To Nelson's family, Young had stated Nelson failed to arrive at a bar at a prearranged time; to investigators, Young claimed he had last seen Nelson standing among a crowd who had gathered outside a Chicago bar and when his (Young's) attention was diverted for a few moments, Nelson simply disappeared. Investigators contend this could <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> without his traveling companion noticing.|$|E
25|$|During the season, {{there was}} ongoing {{speculation}} {{that if the}} talented Fremantle lineup failed to reach the finals, it might cost Fremantle coach Chris Connolly {{his job at the}} club, and that the two points potentially lost by the siren mistake could be the difference between making or missing the finals. Ironically, however, it was St Kilda coach Grant Thomas who was dismissed {{at the end of the}} season after (though not necessarily because) the club was defeated by Melbourne and eliminated in the first week of the finals, which would certainly <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> if St Kilda had finished third and claimed a double-chance.|$|E

It stated that the weather data which the pilots received at Værnes did not predict the conditions which led to the icing. However, it found that had the pilots conferenced in person with a meteorologist concerning the weather along the whole route the conditions may have been discovered in advance, and recommended that such procedures developed.|$|E

25|$|The looting of the city's {{treasury}} could <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> {{without the}} help of {{the most powerful man in}} San Francisco, David Broderick, who was a state senator and held tight control over San Francisco from 1851 until his death in 1859. Broderick's corruption was such that no man could be elected to public office unless he made a deal with Broderick to share half the profits from his office. As a result of these backroom deals, Broderick accumulated a large amount of wealth which further strengthened his position as a powerful city boss. As news of the treasury's financial crisis became known, another even larger uprising of enraged citizenry would occur.|$|E
25|$|Amlaíb {{is known}} to have built a {{fortress}} at Clondalkin, eight kilometres west of Áth Cliath. This was an important seat of Norse power for more than a century. Significantly, the fortress was built on the remains of an old monastic site, which has led some historians to wonder whether a similar thing might <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> at the ecclesiastical enclosure of Duiblinn. The annals are silent as to the ultimate fate of the latter settlement and its community – no Abbot or Bishop of Dublin is mentioned after 785; the possibility remains that it was abandoned in the late 8th century before the arrival of the Norsemen, who simply annexed it and built their longphort on the site.|$|E
25|$|There {{was also}} a story that was widely {{circulated}} {{over the years and}} famously recounted in Lawrence Ritter's The Glory of Their Times, that at one point Cobb was on first; he bragged to Wagner {{that he was going to}} steal second and threatened to assault him physically doing it; Wagner defiantly dared him to try it and placed an especially rough tag to Cobb's mouth; and the two exchanged choice words. Cobb denied it in his autobiography, and the play-by-play of the 1909 World Series confirms that the event could <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> as stated: Cobb was never tagged out by Wagner in a caught-stealing. The Pirates won the series four games to three behind the pitching of Babe Adams.|$|E

In February 2017, she led a {{campaign}} to block the release of the film Matilda for its allegedly blasphemous portrayal of the affair between Tsar Nicholas II (who has been canonized by the Russian Orthodox Church) and the ballerina Matilda Kshesinskaya. In April she released a 39-page report denouncing the film and alleging, among other claims, that the well-documented affair could <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> as Kshesinskaya was, in the opinion of the report's authors, too ugly to have attracted the attention of Nicholas. In March she claimed that a bronze bust of the tsar in Simferopol was seeping fragrant myrrh. Her claims were denied by the Russian Orthodox Church and prompted ridicule from Russian netizens.|$|E
25|$|The Battle of Albert (21–3 August) saw Third Army {{push forward}} up to 4,000 yards over an 11 mile front, taking 5,000 prisoners, with Fourth Army attacking on the {{southern}} flank - in Gary Sheffield's description, a victory for ordinary British troops which would <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> without Haig’s prodding of Byng. The attacks continued for another two days, then on 26 August Currie’s Canadian Corps, now part of First Army, attacked at Arras further north. Haig wrote to his wife that this, the Battle of the Scarpe, was “the greatest victory which a British Army has ever achieved”, and although it did not achieve quite the planned level of success – cavalry, including a brigade of infantry in buses, had been ready to exploit – Ludendorff ordered further withdrawals that evening, including the ground gained by “Georgette” in April.|$|E

I was able to do that in front of millions of viewers. That was a remarkable experience—and it continues to resonate. The downside of that is also that it continues to resonate, and threatens to eclipse all else in one's long career if one does not up the ante and stay at it, in a way that may not ordinarily be necessary. I have to work at changing and constantly reinventing myself in a way that probably would <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> had Star Trek not come along.

50|$|Like many otome games, {{the events}} take place over a fix time frame. However, unlike many games, each route {{in the game}} is a {{parallel}} world.

25|$|Chainfire {{continues}} {{the story of}} Richard {{in his attempt to}} teach the people that their lives are theirs alone, and that they can be free of the Imperial Order. Richard is gravely injured from an enemy's arrow. He is brought to Nicci, a sorceress and former Sister of the Dark, who heals him using Subtractive Magic; this causes unforeseen events to spiral out of control. When Richard awakens, he discovers that his wife, Kahlan Amnell, the Mother Confessor, is missing. Furthermore, no one around him seems to remember her. Nicci and Cara both attribute Richard's memory of Kahlan to dreams and delusions brought on by his injury and possibly an unintended effect of the Subtractive Magic used in healing Richard. Despite Richard's attempts to explain {{the events of the last}} several years could <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> without Kahlan, the paradoxes are explained away as Richard remembering things inaccurately.|$|E
25|$|The special {{values such as}} {{infinity}} and NaN {{ensure that}} the floating-point arithmetic is algebraically completed, such that every floating-point operation produces a well-defined result and will not—by default—throw a machine interrupt or trap. Moreover, the choices of special values returned in exceptional cases were designed to give the correct answer in many cases, e.g. continued fractions such as R(z) := 7 − 3/(z − 2 − 1/(z − 7 + 10/(z − 2 − 2/(z − 3)))) will give the correct answer in all inputs under IEEE-754 arithmetic as the potential divide by zero in e.g. R(3)=4.6 is correctly handled as +infinity and so can be safely ignored. As noted by Kahan, the unhandled trap consecutive to a floating-point to 16-bit integer conversion overflow that caused the loss of an Ariane 5 rocket would <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> under the default IEEE 754 floating-point policy.|$|E
25|$|At {{some point}} {{in the days leading up}} to Survivor Series, however, McMahon began to reconsider that decision. Word of Hart's {{impending}} departure from the company had leaked to fans and wrestling news sources. McMahon was worried that allowing Hart to remain champion after the match at Survivor Series would cause problems and reckoned that Bischoff was still prone to doing anything he could to get under McMahon's skin and McMahon thought he would be likely to mention the signing of Hart to WCW on Nitro the following night (something Bischoff said would <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>happened</b> under normal circumstances). Furthermore, Bischoff would have a one-hour head start on McMahon due to Nitro going on the air live at 8 PM, which would have been more than enough time to announce Hart's WCW arrival. Therefore, McMahon felt, he needed to find a way to get the title off of Hart.|$|E
