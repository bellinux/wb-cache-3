50|$|Smaller {{research}} {{topics that}} Rice has published on included {{work on the}} chemistry of water, the theory of <b>freezing</b> <b>liquids,</b> the properties of monolayers on liquids, and confined colloidal systems, amongst others.|$|R
5000|$|For {{every type}} of latent {{internal}} energy there is an opposite. For example, the latent internal energy of <b>Freezing</b> (<b>liquid</b> to solid) {{is equal to the}} negative of the Latent internal energy of melting (solid to liquid) ...|$|R
5000|$|Another {{disadvantage}} is {{that the}} bottles are unsuitable for freezing its contents, as <b>freezing</b> <b>liquids</b> expand in volume and cause the bottle to crack. [...] Therefore, it is advisable not to keep fluids in the container during extended periods below freezing temperatures.|$|R
50|$|Frozen dessert is {{the generic}} name for desserts made by <b>freezing</b> <b>liquids,</b> semi-solids, and {{sometimes}} even solids. They may be based on flavored water (shave ice, ice pops, sorbet, snow cones, etc.), on fruit purées (such as sorbet), on milk and cream (most ice creams), on custard (frozen custard and some ice creams), on mousse (semifreddo), and others.|$|R
50|$|Metastable {{states of}} matter range from melting solids (or <b>freezing</b> <b>liquids),</b> boiling liquids (or {{condensing}} gases) and sublimating solids to supercooled liquids or superheated liquid-gas mixtures. Extremely pure, supercooled water stays liquid below 0 °C and remains so until applied vibrations or condensing seed doping initiates crystallization centers. This {{is a common}} situation for the droplets of atmospheric clouds.|$|R
5000|$|Willem Hendrik Keesom (...) (21 June 1876, Texel [...] - [...] 24 March 1956, Leiden) was a Dutch {{physicist}} who, in 1926, {{invented a}} method to <b>freeze</b> <b>liquid</b> helium.He also developed the first mathematical description of dipole-dipole interactions in 1921. Thus, dipole-dipole interactions are also known as Keesom interactions.He was previously a student of Heike Kamerlingh Onnes, who had discovered superconductivity (a feat for which Kamerlingh Onnes received the 1913 Nobel Prize in Physics).|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{we present}} {{for the first time}} the {{observations}} of a <b>freezing</b> <b>liquid</b> marble. In the experiment, liquid marbles are gently placed on the cold side of a Thermo-Electric Cooler (TEC) and the morphological changes are recorded and characterized thereafter. These liquid marbles are noticed to undergo a shape transition from a spherical to a flying-saucer shaped morphology. The <b>freezing</b> dynamics of <b>liquid</b> marbles is observed to be very different from that of a freezing water droplet on a superhydrophobic surface. For example, the pointy tip appearing on a frozen water drop could not be observed for a frozen liquid marble. In the end, we highlight a possible explanation for the observed morphology...|$|R
50|$|Evacuated tube {{collectors}} {{reduce the}} need for anti-freeze additives since the vacuum helps slow heat loss. However, under prolonged exposure to freezing temperatures the heat transfer fluid can still freeze and precautions must be taken to ensure that the <b>freezing</b> <b>liquid</b> does not damage the evacuated tube when designing systems for such environments. Properly designed solar thermal water heaters can be frost protected down to more than -3 °C with special additives and are being used in Antarctica to heat water.|$|R
40|$|Heat pipe diode {{types are}} discussed. The design, {{fabrication}} and {{test of a}} flight qualified diode for the Advanced Thermal Control Flight Experiment (ATFE) are described. The review covers the use of non-condensable gas, <b>freezing,</b> <b>liquid</b> trap, and liquid blockage techniques. Test data and parametric performance are presented for the liquid trap and liquid blockage techniques. The liquid blockage technique was selected for the ATFE diode {{on the basis of}} small reservoir size, low reverse mode heat transfer, and apparent rapid shut-off...|$|R
50|$|Monosodium xenate {{can be made}} {{by mixing}} {{solutions}} of xenon trioxide and sodium hydroxide, followed by <b>freezing</b> to <b>liquid</b> nitrogen temperatures, and dehydrating in a vacuum.|$|R
2500|$|Although the {{temperature}} on Mars can reach above <b>freezing</b> (...) , <b>liquid</b> water is unstable {{over much of}} the planet, as the atmospheric pressure is below water's triple point and water ice sublimes into water vapor. Exceptions to this are the low-lying areas of the planet, most notably in the Hellas Planitia impact basin, the largest such crater on Mars. It is so deep that the atmospheric pressure at the bottom reaches 1155Pa, which is above the triple point, so if {{the temperature}} exceeded 0°C liquid water could exist there.|$|R
40|$|The tables include entropy, enthalpy, {{internal}} energy, density, volume, {{speed of}} sound, specific heat, thermal conductivity, viscosity, thermal diffusivity, Prandtl number, and the dielectric constant for 65 isobars. Quantities of special utility in heat transfer and thermodynamic calculations are {{also included in}} the isobaric tables. In addition to the isobaric tables, tables for the saturated vapor and liquid are given, which include all of the above properties, plus the surface tension. Tables for the P-T of the <b>freezing</b> <b>liquid,</b> index of refraction, and the derived Joule-Thomson inversion curve are also presented...|$|R

5000|$|On 22 November 2016 the European Parliament voted 497 to 37 {{in favour}} of a <b>non</b> binding <b>freeze</b> on {{membership}} talks with Turkey in response to [...] "disproportionate repressive measures taken in Turkey since the failed military coup attempt." ...|$|R
50|$|Freezing {{is almost}} always an {{exothermic}} process, meaning that as liquid changes into solid, heat and pressure is released. This is often seen as counter-intuitive, since {{the temperature of the}} material does not rise during freezing, except if the liquid were supercooled. But this can be understood, since heat must be continually removed from the <b>freezing</b> <b>liquid</b> or the <b>freezing</b> process will stop. The energy released upon freezing is a latent heat, and is known as the enthalpy of fusion and is exactly the same as the energy required to melt the same amount of the solid.|$|R
30|$|After {{treatment}} at each temperature, algal samples of each species were immediately <b>froze</b> in <b>liquid</b> nitrogen, labeled {{and stored in}} a freezer at − 80  °C for the following assay (Fariduddin et al. 2014).|$|R
40|$|To prepare tissues for {{analysis}} of NAD+, NADH, NADP+, and NADPH, common practice is to <b>freeze</b> samples in <b>liquid</b> nitrogen, often followed by freeze-drying, before extraction in HCl or NaOH. With cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) cotyledons, prefreezing in liquid nitrogen or slower freezing to − 20 °C yielded substantially lower values for NADH and NADPH than obtained from samples homogenized immediately in acid or base. Freeze-drying after <b>freezing</b> in <b>liquid</b> nitrogen generally caused even lower values of those coenzymes. We suggest that direct extraction {{is more likely to}} yield accurate results with cotyledons and other plant parts...|$|R
30|$|Immediately after harvesting, {{inactivation}} of {{the metabolic}} processes {{is critical to}} avoid the loss of metabolites with high turnover (Figure  1 B). The most common method employed for this end is rapid <b>freezing</b> by <b>liquid</b> nitrogen, although quenching or acidic treatment are also appropriate alternatives [41]–[47].|$|R
5000|$|When the brinicle becomes thick enough, {{it becomes}} self-sustaining. As ice accumulates around the down-flowing cold jet, it forms an insulating layer that {{prevents}} the cold, saline water from diffusing and warming. As a result, the ice jacket surrounding the jet grows downward with the flow. The inner wall {{temperature of the}} stalactite remains on the salinity-determined freezing curve, so as the stalactite grows and the temperature deficit of the brine goes into the growth of ice, the inner wall melts to dilute and cool the adjacent brine back to its freezing point. [...] It is like an icicle turned inside-out; rather than cold air <b>freezing</b> <b>liquid</b> water into layers, down-rushing cold water is freezing the surrounding water, enabling it to descend even deeper. As it does, it creates more ice, and the brinicle grows longer.|$|R
40|$|Alginate-coated shoot-tips of chicory (Cichorium intybus L. cv. Flash) were cryopreserved using direct <b>freezing</b> in <b>liquid</b> nitrogen. A two-step preculture was used. After {{dehydration}} and cryopreservation {{a survival}} rate of 65. 0 (+/- 7. 0) % was obtained. This method seems. to be promising for cryopreserving chicory shoot-tips. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Aerosolized {{evaporative}} precipitation into {{aqueous solution}} and spray <b>freezing</b> into <b>liquid</b> nanostructured formulations of itraconazole as prophylaxis significantly improved survival relative to commercial itraconazole oral solution {{and the control}} in a murine model of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. Aerosolized administration of nanostructured formulations also achieved high lung tissue concentrations while limiting systemic exposure...|$|R
50|$|As an {{alternative}} to a ladle, a degreasing cup {{can be used to}} skim the fat off hot liquids. This is a clear plastic or glass cup that looks similar to a teapot, with a spout that comes out of the bottom. The liquid and juices are poured into the cup then poured out leaving the fat behind; the liquid comes {{from the bottom of the}} cup instead of the top. Degreasing cups come in various sizes. Refrigerating or <b>freezing</b> <b>liquids</b> until the fat congeals and solidifies can make the fat easier to remove with a spoon. If, after removing the congealed fat, the liquid still appears cloudy, it can be made clearer by skimming it again with a ladle after bringing it to a gentle simmer to allow for the release of more fat and insoluble proteins.|$|R
40|$|Fiber {{contents}} of oven-dried ray-grass cut {{at different stages}} of maturity were higher than the values obtained for freeze-dried samples. The reverse was observed for in vitro organic matter digestibility. Moreover, oven-drying dramatically decreased in sacco nitrogen degradability as compared to lyophilization, preservation by <b>freezing</b> with <b>liquid</b> nitrogen and use of fresh material. Peer reviewe...|$|R
5000|$|An ice pop is a {{water-based}} frozen snack. It is {{also referred}} to as a popsicle (Canada, U.S., New Zealand), freezer pop (Ireland, U.S.), ice lolly (United Kingdom, India, Ireland, South Africa), ice block (New Zealand, parts of Australia), icy pole (parts of Australia), ice drop (Philippines), or chihiro (Cayman Islands) A frozzie (kirkby) [...] It is made by <b>freezing</b> flavored <b>liquid</b> (such as fruit juice) around a stick, generally resembling a tongue depressor. Often, the juice is colored artificially. Once the <b>liquid</b> <b>freezes</b> solid, the stick {{can be used as a}} handle to hold the ice pop. When an ice pop does not have a stick, it is called, among other names, a freezie.|$|R
50|$|A freezie, freeze pop (United States), freezer pop, ice-pole, pop stick, icy-pole, ice pop, tip top, chihiro (Cayman Islands), ice candy (Philippines), aiskrim Malaysia or potong (Malaysia) is a {{water-based}} frozen snack. It {{is made by}} <b>freezing</b> flavored <b>liquid</b> such as sugar water, {{fruit juice}} or purée inside a plastic casing or tube, either round or flat.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Soluble solids (SS), {{titratable acidity}} (TA), SS/TA ratio, pH, moisture, soluble sugars (SSU), total {{reducing}} sugars (RSU), and non-reducing sugars (NRS) were assessed in the pulp of pequi fruits collected at three ripening stages: from the plant, {{from the ground}} after naturally falling off, and collected from the ground three days after naturally falling off. The evaluation was performed {{after six months of}} freezer storage both for fruits subjected to quick <b>freezing</b> (<b>liquid</b> nitrogen followed by freezer) and slow freezing (straight into the freezer). The variables assessed were not influenced by the freezing method. The SS, TA, and RSU contents increased with the ripening stage, suggesting that the fruits collected from the plant are still immature and have lower quality than those collected after naturally falling off. Although considered mature when they fall off, fruits consumed three days after naturally falling off have better quality...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{elaborate}} two-dimensional behavioral modeling method of thick-film resistors working in low-temperature conditions. The investigated resistors (made from 5 various resistive inks: 10 resistor coupons, each with 36 resistors with various dimensions), were measured automatically in a cryostat system. The low temperature was achieved in a nitrogen-helium continuous-flow cryostat. For nitrogen used as a <b>freezing</b> <b>liquid</b> the minimal temperature possible to achieve was equal to − 195. 85 °C (77. 3 K). Mathematical model {{in the form of}} a multiplication of two polynomials was elaborated based on the above mentioned measurements. The first polynomial approximated temperature behavior of the normalized resistance, while the second one described the dependence of resistance on planar resistors dimensions. Special computational procedures for multidimensional approximation purpose were elaborated. It was shown that proper approximation polynomials and sufficiently exact methods of calculations ensure acceptable modeling errors...|$|R

50|$|When a rock cools {{too quickly}} the <b>liquid</b> <b>freezes</b> into a solid glass, or {{crystalline}} groundmass. Often vapor loss from a magma chamber {{will cause a}} porphyritic texture.|$|R
30|$|CD 45 -depleted {{cells were}} re-suspended in D-PBS(−) (Wako, Japan) and lysed by five <b>freeze</b> (in <b>liquid</b> N 2)/thaw (in 37  °C water bath) cycles {{followed}} by centrifugation. Lysate was centrifuged at 15, 000 g for 30  min at 4  °C.

40|$|Results of {{detailed}} structural studies, using elastic neutron scattering, of the <b>freezing</b> of <b>liquid</b> O 2 and D 2 in porous vycor glass, are presented. The experimental {{studies have been}} complemented by computer simulations {{of the dynamics of}} freezing of a Lennard-Jones liquid in narrow channels bounded by molecular walls. Results point to a new simple physical interpretation of freezing in confined geometries...|$|R
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the effects of slow (– 18 °C) and fast <b>freezing</b> (<b>liquid</b> nitrogen) of pork meat, {{and the use of}} exudate released upon thawing, on the physicochemical, color, rheological, microbiological, histological, and sensory characteristics of cooked ham. The meat samples were frozen at – 18 °C and thawed after 22 weeks for the production of cooked ham. No significant difference was observed regarding physicochemical, color and microbiological parameters or in sensory acceptance. The hardness and chewiness parameters showed significant differences when compared to the control sample (ham made from chilled meat). Light microscopy of cooked ham samples showed that changes in the tissues were caused by freezing and thawing the meat. The effect of exudate was significant on the sodium content and compression force parameters, but this difference was not perceived in the sensory analysis, confirming that frozen pork meat can be used to produce cooked ham without loss of quality...|$|R
50|$|Props {{are also}} {{included}} in the game. Trampolines help the player bounce to further ledges or platforms, Buttons activate certain things throughout the game, Pressure Pads are like buttons, but they are big metal squares with feet. There are also character specific abilities, such as Sandy being able to swing from Texas hooks, SpongeBob being able to dive downward on a bungee hook, and Patrick's ability to pick up and throw watermelons, freeze fruits, and fire fruits. Though some areas can be navigated by any character, several sections can only be completed with a specific character, due to each one having unique abilities. SpongeBob can create a bubble helmet for head-butting enemies. Patrick can throw objects at buttons, robots, and <b>freeze</b> <b>liquids.</b> Sandy can glide over large gaps with her lasso. The Windows version features a series of mini-games and greatly differs from the console versions. Gameplay for the GBA version is much different as well, as it is simply a 2D game.|$|R
