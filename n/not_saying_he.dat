[...] Time {{magazine}} journalist Lisa Beyer reported that Rabbi Adin Even-Yisrael said he wished that Schneerson should be revealed as the Messiah." [...] Even Rabbi Yehuda Krinsky told the New York Times in 1988: [...] "Our sages tell us that the Messiah is a man of flesh and blood who lives among us...

2500|$|James Mitchell (c. 1920 – May 2008) — an RUC Reserve {{officer and}} the owner of the Glenanne farm. He joined the RUC Reserve in September 1974 and was {{stationed}} at Markethill. He left the force on 1 July 1977 for [...] "personal reasons". Weir named him as a UVF member who regularly participated in paramilitary activities. Weir claimed that Mitchell admitted being involved in the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, and went on to claim that he had seen Mitchell mixing home-made ammonium-nitrate-and-fuel-oil explosive in the farmyard on one occasion. He was convicted for possession of weapons found on his land after an RUC raid in December 1978. In an RUC interview on 9 August 2000, he staunchly denied Weir's allegations and referred to him as [...] "a damned liar and convicted murderer". Mitchell died, aged 88, in May 2008 at Daisy Hill Hospital, Newry. Willie Frazer attended his funeral and told media [...] "I’m <b>not</b> <b>saying</b> <b>he</b> was lily–white but he was a decent man".|$|E
2500|$|Scholarly {{opinion is}} {{divided on the}} issue, with many {{scholars}} viewing him as a staunch antisemite while some deny {{the appropriateness of the}} term, or argue that he became antisemitic. Robert Kiely sees Husseini as moving [...] "incrementally toward anti-Semitism as he opposed Jewish ambitions in the region." [...] Historian Zvi Elpeleg, who formerly governed both the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, while rehabilitating him from other charges, concludes his chapter concerning al-Husseini's involvement in the extermination of the Jews as follows:'n any case, {{there is no doubt that}} Haj Amin's hatred was not limited to Zionism, but extended to Jews as such. His frequent, close contacts with leaders of the Nazi regime cannot have left Haj Amin any doubt as to the fate which awaited Jews whose emigration was prevented by his efforts. His many comments show that he was not only delighted that Jews were prevented from emigrating to Palestine, but was very pleased by the Nazis' Final Solution'. [...] Walter Laqueur, Benny Morris, Klaus-Michael Mallmann and Martin Cüppers, the evidential basis for whose claims in their book, translated as [...] "Nazi Palestine" [...] were questioned by Michael Sells as based on selective statements by a few writers taken at face value, share the view that al-Husseini was biased against Jews, not just against Zionists. Morris, for instance, notes that al-Husseini saw the Holocaust as German revenge for a putative Jewish sabotaging of their war effort in World War I, and has written that [...] "Haj Amin al-Husseini was an antisemite. This is clear from his writings. I am <b>not</b> <b>saying</b> <b>he</b> was just an anti-Zionist, he hated the Jews, 'Jews were evil'". In a study dedicated to the role and use of the Holocaust in Israeli nationalist discourse, Idith Zertal reexamining al-Husseini's antisemitism, states that 'in more correct proportions, [...] as a fanatic nationalist-religious Palestinian leader'.|$|E

6000|$|... "'I'm <b>not</b> <b>saying</b> <b>he</b> did,' Mr. Crow snapped out {{short as}} pie crust. 'He {{took hold of}} my leg and I couldn't get here without him, and that's why the miserable {{creature}} is making so much trouble.' ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{man turned}} and went rather sulkily. I heard him say to the under-keeper, [...] "He's pretty good, the master is, I'm <b>not</b> <b>saying</b> <b>he</b> isn't, but if he kills a {{woodcock}} in this light and wind, I'm a Dutchman." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Duckett sent it ashore," [...] said Brisket. [...] "Thinking {{that there}} was men’s work ahead, and that the ladies {{might be in the}} way, he put it over the side and sent it back. And mind, believing what he did, I’m <b>not</b> <b>saying</b> <b>he</b> wasn’t in the right." ...|$|E

6000|$|Julius {{laughed a}} little, and added, [...] "I am <b>not</b> <b>saying</b> <b>he</b> deserves you--hush!--or {{that it would}} be well to take him now, only that I think to find himself utterly {{rejected}} for so insufficient a reason, and when he was really deceived, would not only half kill him now, but do his whole nature cruel harm." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Tut, tut! I am <b>not</b> <b>saying</b> <b>he</b> wasn't a good man. I am only saying that, good or bad, {{it was no}} {{business}} of mine; and then nothing will do but I must send for the boy {{and put him in}} my business. And a nice mess he made of it--an idler, more careless apprentice, no cloth merchant, especially one who stood well with his fellow citizens, and who was on the highway to becoming mayor of his native city, was ever crossed with." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm <b>not</b> <b>saying</b> <b>he</b> is. The {{great thing}} is that he's good enough, and gracious knows {{what will happen if}} she meets some other {{worthless}} fellow, and gets befooled with him! Or if she doesn't take a fancy to some one, and goes back to Tuskingum without seeing any one else she likes, there is that awful wretch, and when she hears what Dick did to him--she's just wrong-headed enough to take up with him again to make amends to him. Oh, dear oh, dear! I know Lottie will let it out to her yet!" ...|$|E

6000|$|Then Mr. Toogood {{explained}} {{as well as}} he was able that the dean might have something to say on the subject which would serve Mr. Crawley's defence. [...] "We shouldn't leave any stone unturned," [...] said Mr. Toogood. [...] "As far as I can judge, Crawley still thinks,--or half thinks,--that he got the cheque from your son-in-law." [...] Mr. Harding shook his head sorrowfully. [...] "I'm <b>not</b> <b>saying</b> <b>he</b> did, you know," [...] continued Mr. Toogood. [...] "I can't see myself how it is possible;--but still, we ought not to leave any stone unturned. And Mrs. Arabin,--can you tell me at all where we shall find her?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Exactly. We {{offer him}} {{some sort of}} social recognition. Well, {{as soon as a}} fellow gets up, if he gets up high enough, we offer him some sort of social recognition; in fact, all sorts; but upon {{condition}} that he has left off working with his hands for a living. We forgive all you please to his past on account of the present. But there isn't a working-man, I venture to say, in any city or town, or even large village, in the whole length and breadth of the United States who has any social recognition, if he is still working at his trade. I don't mean, merely, that he is excluded from rich and fashionable society, but from the society of the average educated and cultivated people. I'm <b>not</b> <b>saying</b> <b>he</b> is fit for it; but I don't care how intelligent and agreeable he might be--and some of them are astonishingly intelligent, and so agreeable in their tone of mind and their original way of looking at things that I like nothing better than to talk with them--all of our invisible fences are up against him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not, however," [...] he went on, [...] "that I {{want to talk}} to {{you about}} that. It's my own little affair, and I {{mentioned}} it simply as part of Mrs. Pocock's advantage." [...] No, no; though there was a queer present temptation in it, and his suspense was so real that to fidget was a relief, he wouldn't talk to her about Mrs. Newsome, wouldn't work off on her the anxiety produced in him by Sarah's calculated omissions of reference. The effect she produced of representing her mother had been produced--and that was just the immense, the uncanny part of it--without her having so much as mentioned that lady. She had brought no message, had alluded to no question, had only answered his enquiries with hopeless limited propriety. She had invented a way of meeting them--as if he had been a polite perfunctory poor relation, of distant degree--that made them almost ridiculous in him. He couldn't moreover on his own side ask much without appearing to publish how he had lately lacked news; a circumstance of which it was Sarah's profound policy not to betray a suspicion. These things, all the same, he wouldn't breathe to Madame de Vionnet--much as they might make him walk up and down. And what he didn't say--as well as what SHE didn't, for she had also her high decencies--enhanced the effect of his being there with her at the end of ten minutes more intimately on the basis of saving her than he had yet had occasion to be. It ended in fact by being quite beautiful between them, the number of things they had a manifest consciousness of <b>not</b> <b>saying.</b> <b>He</b> would have liked to turn her, critically, to the subject of Mrs. Pocock, but he so stuck to the line he felt to be the point of honour and of delicacy that he scarce even asked her what her personal impression had been. He knew it, for that matter, without putting her to trouble: that she wondered how, with such elements, Sarah could still have no charm, was one of the principal things she held her tongue about. Strether would have been interested in her estimate of the elements--indubitably there, some of them, and to be appraised according to taste--but he denied himself even the luxury of this diversion. The way Madame de Vionnet affected him to-day was in itself a kind of demonstration of the happy employment of gifts. How could a woman think Sarah had charm who struck one as having arrived at it herself by such different roads? On the other hand of course Sarah wasn't obliged to have it. He felt as if somehow Madame de Vionnet WAS. The great question meanwhile was what Chad thought of his sister; which was naturally ushered in by that of Sarah's apprehension of Chad. THAT they could talk of, and with a freedom purchased by their discretion in other senses. The difficulty however was that they were reduced as yet to conjecture. He had given them in the day or two as little of a lead as Sarah, and Madame de Vionnet mentioned that she hadn't seen him since his sister's arrival.|$|E
6000|$|... "But, my dear, His {{purposes}} are inscrutable. We dare <b>not</b> <b>say</b> <b>He</b> should <b>not</b> {{do this or}} that, or try {{to fathom}} to what ends He is working." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I did <b>not</b> <b>say</b> <b>he</b> knew it," [...] {{answered}} Moore crossly; [...] "I {{said he had}} it. As to Egypt, I don't {{know what}} you are talking about--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If wisely exercised, and I will <b>not</b> <b>say</b> <b>he</b> is <b>not</b> exercising it wisely. Certainly {{for his own}} purpose, {{but whether}} that purpose is for the general good--query?" ...|$|R
50|$|The Labour Government {{decided to}} {{commission}} an enquiry under Lord Scarman and the pickets were called off in mid-July {{to wait for}} the result of the enquiry. APEX announced it would abide by the outcome of the enquiry but Ward did <b>not,</b> <b>saying</b> <b>he</b> would only submit to the normal courts.|$|E
50|$|In 2004, Bawab {{signed a}} {{professional}} contract with Real Madrid, {{and the club}} also agreed to pay a college scholarship for him, as {{he went on to}} make his senior debuts with the third team in the fourth division. At that time, talks had started where people compared his style of play to Zinedine Zidane (even though they did not play in the same position); first-team coach Mariano García Remón thought about promoting to the main squad, but eventually did <b>not</b> <b>saying</b> <b>he</b> did not want to put pressure on the youngster, who was just 19.|$|E

50|$|Touching a person's {{genitals}} without consent (also {{known as}} groping) is considered sexual assault in most jurisdictions in the United States. Many attorneys and media commentators characterized Trump's statements as describing acts of sexual assault. Lisa Bloom, {{a sexual harassment}} expert and civil rights lawyer, stated: “Let’s be very clear, {{he is talking about}} sexual assault. He is talking about grabbing a woman’s genitals without her consent.” Trump and some of his supporters claimed that Trump was <b>not</b> <b>saying</b> <b>he</b> committed a sexual assault, or denied that groping is sexual assault. Journalist Emily Crockett says that this is further evidence of a trend to minimize sexual assaults against women.|$|E
5000|$|Ortiz's manager, Sal Garcia, added: [...] "one of {{the other}} fighters comes in at that point and says, 'hey, Ken Shamrock and the Lion's Den, {{they want to come}} over and kick Tito and Sal's asses.'" [...] The tension {{backstage}} was so great that some feared a brawl between the Lion's Den and Tito Ortiz, Kevin Randleman, Mark Coleman and others from the Hammer House (who were in Ortiz's locker room after the event). The situation was escalated to the point that police and security had to be called in to monitor the situation. Jeff Sherwood, creator of Sherdog, wrote after the event: [...] "Someone needs to remind Ken Shamrock that it wasn't Monday Night Raw out there. <b>Not</b> <b>saying</b> <b>he</b> wouldn't tear Tito up though." ...|$|E
5000|$|Later that month, on 11 December, Brand {{appeared}} on the BBC's Question Time programme which included the UK Independence Party's leader Nigel Farage {{as one of the}} other panellists. Brand called Farage [...] "a pound shop Enoch Powell" [...] on-air, and the two men continued to trade insults after the programme had ended. [...] In the wake of the Question Time episode, one journalist concluded that neither Brand nor Farage emerged victorious, with the former accused of [...] "preaching", while a supporter of Brand wrote that the comedian was out of his element: [...] "I'm <b>not</b> <b>saying</b> <b>he</b> didn't make an impact. I agree with most of what he has to say, and I'm glad he was on Question Time—in the heart of the establishment—saying it. But in terms of his performance or identity, he looks caught between two stools." ...|$|E
60|$|I do {{not mean}} that all mad {{delusions}} are as concrete as this, though some are more concrete. Believing your own body is glass is a more daring denial of reality than believing a tree is a glass lamp {{at the top of}} a pole. But all true delusions have in them this unalterable assertion--that what is not is. The difference between us and the maniac is not about how things look or how things ought to look, but about what they self-evidently are. The lunatic does <b>not</b> <b>say</b> that <b>he</b> ought to be King; Perkin Warbeck might <b>say</b> that. <b>He</b> <b>says</b> <b>he</b> is King. The lunatic does <b>not</b> <b>say</b> <b>he</b> is as wise as Shakespeare; Bernard Shaw might say that. The lunatic <b>says</b> <b>he</b> is Shakespeare. The lunatic does <b>not</b> <b>say</b> <b>he</b> is divine in the same sense as Christ; Mr. R.J. Campbell would say that. The lunatic <b>says</b> <b>he</b> is Christ.
