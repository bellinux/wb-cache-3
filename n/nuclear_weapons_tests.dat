5|$|Among the {{numerous}} radioactive isotopes of zirconium, 93Zr {{is among the}} most common. It is released as a product of 235U, mainly in nuclear plants and during <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>tests</b> in the 1950s and 1960s. It has a very long half-life (1.53 million years), its decay emits only low energy radiations, and it is not considered as highly hazardous.|$|E
5|$|Compared to the Congress, the BJP takes a more {{aggressive}} and nationalistic position on defence policy and terrorism. The Vajpayee-led NDA government carried out <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>tests,</b> and enacted the Prevention of Terrorism Act, which later came under heavy criticism. It also deployed troops to evict infiltrators from Kargil, and supported the United States' War on Terror.|$|E
5|$|Alvin Cushman Graves (November 4, 1909 â€“ July 19, 1965) was an American nuclear {{physicist}} {{who served}} at the Manhattan Project's Metallurgical Laboratory and the Los Alamos Laboratory during World War II. After the war, he became the head of J (Test) Division at Los Alamos, and was director or assistant director of numerous <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>tests</b> during the 1940s and 1950s. Graves was badly injured in the 1946 laboratory criticality accident in Los Alamos that killed Louis Slotin, but recovered.|$|E

5|$|On Earth, {{berkelium}} {{is mostly}} concentrated in certain areas, which {{were used for}} the atmospheric <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>tests</b> between 1945 and 1980, {{as well as at the}} sites of nuclear incidents, such as the Chernobyl disaster, Three Mile Island accident and 1968 Thule Air Base B-52 crash. Analysis of the debris at the testing site of the first U.S. hydrogen bomb, Ivy Mike, (1 November 1952, Enewetak Atoll), revealed high concentrations of various actinides, including berkelium. For reasons of military secrecy, this result was published only in 1956.|$|E

5|$|Because of {{the short}} {{half-life}} of all isotopes of fermium, any primordial fermium, that is fermium that could be present on the Earth during its formation, has decayed by now. Synthesis of fermium from naturally occurring actinides uranium and thorium in the Earth crust requires multiple neutron capture, which is an extremely unlikely event. Therefore, most fermium is produced on Earth in scientific laboratories, high-power nuclear reactors, or in <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>tests,</b> and is present only {{within a few months}} {{from the time of the}} synthesis. The transuranic elements from americium to fermium did occur naturally in the natural nuclear fission reactor at Oklo, but no longer do so.|$|E
5|$|GRBs {{were first}} {{detected}} in 1967 by the Vela satellites, {{which had been}} designed to detect covert <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>tests.</b> Following their discovery, hundreds of theoretical models were proposed to explain these bursts, such as collisions between comets and neutron stars. Little information was available to verify these models until the 1997 detection of the first X-ray and optical afterglows and direct measurement of their redshifts using optical spectroscopy, and thus their distances and energy outputs. These discoveries, and subsequent studies of the galaxies and supernovae associated with the bursts, clarified the distance and luminosity of GRBs, definitively placing them in distant galaxies.|$|E
5|$|After {{completing}} his term as {{commanding officer of}} No. 2 Squadron on 11 July 1955, Raw was posted to the UK to undertake training at the Royal Air Force Flying College.

From December that year he served as a liaison officer to the RAAF force supporting the British <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>tests</b> in the Montebello Islands off the coast of Western Australia. In 1957 Raw was posted to the Joint Planning staff. During 1958 he and Dorothy divorced; Raw subsequently married Helen Dorothy Hammond on 21 June that year at St Margaret's Presbyterian Church in Balaclava.

5|$|Because of {{the short}} {{half-life}} of all isotopes of einsteinium, any primordial einsteinium, that is einsteinium that could possibly be present on the Earth during its formation, has decayed by now. Synthesis of einsteinium from naturally occurring actinides uranium and thorium in the Earth crust requires multiple neutron capture, which is an extremely unlikely event. Therefore, all terrestrial einsteinium is produced in scientific laboratories, high-power nuclear reactors, or in <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>tests,</b> and is present only {{within a few years}} {{from the time of the}} synthesis.

5|$|In May 1998, the United States enacted {{sanctions}} upon India {{as a part}} of {{the international}} response to a series of <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>tests</b> by India. , these sanctions effectively grounded India's Sea Kings because India could not purchase any US-supplied spare parts for the fleet. Westland also complied with the sanctions by refusing to maintain any US-made components. A limited number of Sea Kings were kept operational by cannibalising other aircraft and the manufacture of some components by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL). In December 2000, President Bill Clinton permitted a relaxation of the sanctions. In the late 2000s, HAL and AgustaWestland signed an agreement to jointly maintain and perform upgrades to India's fleet of Sea Kings.|$|E
5|$|In his {{new role}} Nichols clashed with the AEC {{over the issue of}} whether it or the Department of Defense should have custody of nuclear weapons. The administration's policy {{remained}} firmly in favor of AEC control. This was tested during the Berlin Blockade, when Truman ordered B-29 bombers to Europe. For a time there was talk of calling off the Operation Sandstone <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>tests,</b> but Nichols successfully argued for their continuation. In 1950, he became Deputy Director of the Guided Missiles Division of the Department of Defense, overseeing the Nike Project. He was appointed Chief of Research and Development when it was reorganized in 1952. Nichols retired from the Army on 31 October 1953. For his services from 1948 to 1953, he was belatedly awarded a second Distinguished Service Medal in 1956.|$|E

5|$|Nichols {{kept the}} {{national}} laboratories operating with $60 {{million worth of}} research grants for fiscal year 1947. He helped Captain Hyman G. Rickover train a team of naval engineers at Oak Ridge in nuclear propulsion. In June 1946, Nichols went to Bikini Atoll to represent the Manhattan Project at Operation Crossroads, a series of <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>tests</b> conducted to investigate their effects on warships. Like many of his contemporaries in an Army that was dramatically reduced in size as it rapidly demobilized, Nichols was reduced in rank, reverting to his substantive rank of lieutenant colonel on 30 June 1946. On return from Bikini, he found {{that he had been}} made an honorary Commander of the Order of the British Empire.|$|E
5|$|In June 1999, the {{contract}} to jointly develop and produce the Chengdu FC-1/Super 7 was signed. The project {{was to be a}} 50:50 partnership; the air forces of both countries would be committed to ordering the fighter. After GEC-Marconi had abandoned the bidding to supply an integrated avionics suite, FIAR and Thomson-CSF proposed a number of avionics suites based on the Grifo S7 and RC400 radars respectively, despite previously hoping to use the PAF's Super 7 to launch its new Blue Hawk radar. Because of sanctions placed on Pakistan after the country's 1998 <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>tests,</b> design work progressed very slowly over the next 18 months, preventing delivery of the Western avionics to the PAF. In early 2001, the PAF decided to decouple the airframe from the avionics, enabling design work on the aircraft to continue. As the airframe was developed, any new avionics requirements by the PAF could be more easily integrated into the airframe.|$|E
5|$|The longest-lived isotope of curium, 247Cm, has a {{half-life}} of 15.6 million years. Therefore, any primordial curium, that is curium {{present on}} the Earth during its formation, should have decayed by now, although some of it would be detectable as an extinct radionuclide as an excess of its nearly stable daughter 235U. Curium is produced artificially, in small quantities for research purposes. Furthermore, it occurs in spent nuclear fuel. Curium is present in nature in certain areas used for the atmospheric <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapons</b> <b>tests,</b> which were conducted between 1945 and 1980.
