5000|$|Saunders Mac Lane, one of {{the founders}} of {{category}} theory, is said to have remarked, [...] "I didn't invent categories to study functors; I invented them to study natural transformations." [...] Just as the study of groups is <b>not</b> complete <b>without</b> a study of homomorphisms, so the study of categories is <b>not</b> complete <b>without</b> the study of functors. The reason for Mac Lane's comment is that the study of functors is itself <b>not</b> complete <b>without</b> the study of natural transformations.|$|R
5|$|Lody's death {{produced}} a low-key {{response from the}} German government. The Admiralstab recommended {{at the end of}} 1914 that he should be awarded a posthumous Iron Cross, Second Class, and argued that the recruitment of naval agents would be assisted if espionage could be rewarded with such a prestigious medal. The Kaiser agreed, though <b>not</b> <b>without</b> some reluctance.|$|E
5|$|Over one {{thousand}} plates {{were included in}} The Indian Antiquary and the Epigraphia Indica over the first fifty years of publication, but having the illustrations produced abroad was <b>not</b> <b>without</b> its disadvantages.

5|$|Although Innis remains {{appreciated}} {{and respected}} {{for the grand}} and unique nature of his later efforts regarding communications theories, he was <b>not</b> <b>without</b> critics.

Biographers have suggested that this style {{may have been a}} result of Innis' illness late in his career.|$|E
5|$|Although <b>not</b> <b>without</b> its critics, his {{architecture}} is widely appreciated. He {{was awarded the}} Royal Institute of British Architects' (RIBA's) Royal Gold Medal for architecture in 1936 and was appointed a Royal Designer for Industry in 1943. His station designs for London Underground became the corporation's standard design influencing designs by all architects working for the organisation in the 1930s. Many of his buildings have been granted listed building status, protecting them from unapproved alteration. He twice declined the offer of a knighthood.|$|E

In what was the last match of the 1920–21 campaign, Burnley fell to a 0–2 loss at White Hart Lane on 16May 1921. The match was <b>not</b> <b>without</b> controversy, as the Burnley players claimed that the second goal should have been disallowed despite the Tottenham goalscorer being onside, maintaining that the whistle had already been blown by the referee.|$|E

However, his election was <b>not</b> <b>without</b> controversy, as the Veterans Committee included former teammates of Bancroft, resulting in charges of cronyism against the Veterans Committee.|$|E
