5|$|Plataea and Mycale {{have great}} {{significance}} in ancient {{history as the}} battles that decisively ended the second Persian invasion of Greece, thereby swinging {{the balance of the}} Greco-Persian Wars in favour of the Greeks. They kept Persia from conquering all of Greece, although they paid a high price by losing many of their men. The Battle of Marathon showed that the Persians could be defeated, and the Battle of Salamis saved Greece from immediate conquest, but it was Plataea and Mycale that effectively ended that threat. However, neither of these battles is <b>nearly</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> known as Thermopylae, Salamis or Marathon. The reason for this discrepancy is not entirely clear; it might, however, be a result of the circumstances in which the battle was fought. The fame of Thermopylae certainly lies in the doomed heroism of the Greeks in the face of overwhelming numbers; and Marathon and Salamis perhaps because they were both fought against the odds, and in dire strategic situations. Conversely, the Battles of Plataea and Mycale were both fought from a relative position of Greek strength, and against lesser odds; the Greeks, in fact, sought out battle on both occasions.|$|E

25|$|Similar {{breakaway}} Southern Democratic candidates {{running on}} states' rights and segregationist platforms would continue in 1956 (T. Coleman Andrews), and 1960 (Harry F. Byrd).

500|$|This {{prompted}} {{further exploration}} of the chemical behavior of complexes of dubnium. Thousands of repetitive chromatographic experiments were performed jointly in various labs between 1988 and 1993. All group 5 elements and protactinium were extracted from concentrated hydrochloric acid; at lower concentrations of hydrogen chloride, small amounts of hydrogen fluoride were added to start selective re-extraction. Dubnium showed a behavior {{different from that of}} tantalum at concentrations of hydrogen chloride below 12 moles, following the behavior of niobium and the pseudohomolog protactinium. Because of this similarity to these two elements, the research suggested that the formed complex was either [...] or [...] After extraction experiments of dubnium from hydrogen bromide into diisobutyl carbinol (2,6-dimethylheptan-4-ol), a specific extractant for protactinium, with subsequent elutions with the hydrogen chloride/hydrogen fluoride mix as well as hydrogen chloride, dubnium was found to be less prone to extraction than both protactinium and niobium. It was explained as an increasing tendency to form non‐extractable complexes of multiple negative charges. Further experiments in 1992 confirmed the stability of the +5 state: Db(V) was shown to be extractable from cation‐exchange columns with α‐hydroxyisobutyrate, similarly to other group 5 elements and protactinium; Db(III) and Db(IV) were not. In 1998 and 1999, new predictions suggested dubnium would extract <b>nearly</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> as niobium and better than tantalum from halide solutions, which was later confirmed.|$|E
