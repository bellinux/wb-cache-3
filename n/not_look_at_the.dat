During the 2017 eclipse he warned the country to not make the mistake he did. While some can recover, the danger of an eclipse comes in part because the excitement can override the instinct to <b>not</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> sun.|$|E
25|$|Parthian art was Iranian art {{made during}} the Parthian Empire from 247 BC to 224 AD, based in the Near East. It has a mixture of Persian and Hellenistic influences. For some time after {{the period of the}} Parthian Empire, art in its styles {{continued}} for some time. A typical feature of Parthian art is the frontality of the people shown. Even in narrative representations, the actors do <b>not</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> object of their action, but at the viewer. These are features that anticipate the art of medieval Europe and Byzantium.|$|E

It is used primarily {{by the majority of}} television networks to track the trajectory of balls in flight. In the winter season of 2008/2009 the ICC trialled a referral system where Hawk-Eye was used for referring decisions to the third umpire if a team disagreed with an LBW decision. The third umpire was able to look at what the ball actually did up to the point when it hit the batsman, but could <b>not</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> predicted flight of the ball after it hit the batsman.|$|E
25|$|According to his accounts, Cooper {{realized}} that these men, who {{on a regular}} basis have seen experimental aircraft flying and landing around them as part of their job of filming those aircraft, were clearly worked up and unnerved. They explained how the saucer hovered over them, landed 50 yards away from them using three extended landing gears and then took off as they approached for a closer look. They took photographs and film. There was a special Pentagon number to call to report such incidents: called and soon was reported up the chain of command until he was instructed by a general to have the film developed, but to make no prints of it, and send it right away in a locked courier pouch. As he had not been instructed to <b>not</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> negatives before sending them, he did. He said the quality of the photography was excellent as would be expected from the experienced photographers who took them. What he saw was exactly what they had described to him. He did not see the film before everything was sent away. He expected {{that there would be a}} follow up investigation since an aircraft of unknown origin had landed in a highly classified military installation, but nothing was ever said of the incident again. He was never able to track down what happened to those photos. He assumed that they ended up going to the Air Force's official UFO investigation, Project Blue Book, which was based at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.|$|E

500|$|Heffron also {{clashed with}} the Federal Government's {{imposition}} of National Emergency Services procedures, most notably over the imposition of brownouts {{for the city of}} Sydney. In the Legislative Assembly in November 1942, Heffron denounced the advisers of the Federal Government who continued to maintain the brown-out as an essential defence measure: [...] "The only conclusion I can come to, is that the brown-out was born of a form of panic when Japan entered the war and it has continued because of a few brass hats will <b>not</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> facts and the evidence of the fighting men, but persist in sticking to their first conclusion. The position, therefore, is ludicrous." [...] Heffron later affirmed that the brown-out was completely unnecessary as a black-out, with short notice given, was a more effective and safer defensive measure.|$|E
500|$|Following the {{appearance}} of Arthur Curry, which {{became one of the}} highest rated episodes of that season, Smallville developers Al Gough and Miles Millar began work on an Aquaman pilot for The WB Television Network, with Justin Hartley as Arthur Curry. As work progressed on season five's [...] "Aqua", the character was recognized to have potential for his own series. The season five episode was never meant to be a backdoor pilot for an Aquaman television spin-off, so Alan Ritchson was never considered for the role. Gough stated in a November 2005 interview that the series would have put a different spin on the Aquaman mythology. Although Gough did <b>not</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> new series as a true spin-off, he did suggest an interest in doing a crossover with Smallville. Aquaman is currently the only series to go into production, though it was ultimately not picked up by The CW network, which had formed from a merger between The WB and UPN during the production of the pilot.|$|E
500|$|If {{property}} has {{not been}} transferred, the potential trustees and beneficiaries are volunteers, and an equitable maxim is that [...] "equity will not assist a volunteer"; the courts will <b>not</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> case. To get around this, the courts have developed exceptions to this rule for situations when the settlor has done [...] "all that he could do", the trustees or beneficiaries have acquired the property in a different way, or where the gift was made donatio mortis causa. Formality refers to the specific language or forms used when transferring property. For chattels, no formal language or documentation is needed, unless it is made as a will. For land, the transfer must be drafted {{in line with the}} Law of Property Act 1925 and the Law of Property (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1989. When disposing of an equitable interest, the Law of Property Act 1925 must also be followed; much of the case law in this area has centred on the meaning of [...] "dispose", with many cases involving people attempting to avoid tax.|$|E

500|$|Nécib {{was born}} on 23 January 1987 {{in the city of}} Marseille to parents of Algerian origin. Her father had emigrated to France from Biskra, while her mother had come from Oran. Nécib was raised in Busserine, a {{quartier}} located in the northern suburbs of the 14th arrondissement of Marseille and has a brother and sister. After signing with Lyon, Nécib enrolled at the Université Lyon 1 with hopes of completing her undergraduate studies in Sciences et techniques des activités physiques et sportives (STAP) (...) [...] She developed an interest in football at a young age, prior to which she trained in gymnastics. She, initially, did <b>not</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> future prospects of women's football and played mainly for recreation with males stating [...] "I'd always played with the boys in my neighborhood" [...] and [...] "I didn't plan to join a club because, to be honest, I didn't know girls' teams existed. Then, one day I found out there was a club in the 14th arrondissement and I signed up".|$|E
500|$|At {{the time}} of the {{formation}} of the new league in 2004, the club was owned by Spirits Sports and Leisure Group. The club announced its search for a star player under the league's allowance for one star player outside of the $1.5million salary cap, insisting that the player should <b>not</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> position as a retirement fund. Coach Lawrie McKinna sought interest from Australia national football team players Ante Milicic and Simon Colosimo, and announced that he may sign more than the three under-20 players required by league rules. Early concerns for the club focussed on concerns over financial stability, but after forming a partnership with technology company Toshiba and a cash injection from local businessman John Singleton, the club's financial worries were eased. McKinna was keen to sign local player Damien Brown of Bateau Bay, formerly of the Newcastle Jets. In a decision which prompted the player to declare that he was [...] "over the moon", Brown became the first player to sign with the club. Club chairman Lyall Gorman was pleased that a local had become a [...] "foundation player" [...] and part of Brown's role would be to assist with selection of younger players from the local area. By early December 2004, the club had created a steady foundation of player signings and began negotiations with former Perth Glory striker Nik Mrdja, signing him later in the month as its star attacker. Mrjda {{was one of the most}} prominent players in the last season of the National Soccer League, scoring the final goal to secure Perth Glory's finals win. The club's management was reluctant to sign a star player outside of the $1.5million salary cap, stipulating that they [...] "would have to contribute on the pitch and get people to come to the ground." ...|$|E

2500|$|In [...] many {{traditional}} Jewish communities {{it is the}} custom for congregants to spread their tallitot over their own heads during the blessing and <b>not</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Kohanim. If a man has children, they will come under his tallit to be blessed, {{even if they are}} quite old. The (unattributed) basis of this custom is to emphasize the spiritual aspect of the blessing over the role of the Kohanim themselves; as per the scriptural verse, the Kohanim are simply a vehicle for the expression of the blessing, when they [...] "place My name upon the children of Israel".|$|E
