Examples of this type of disorder are Albinism, Medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency, cystic fibrosis, sickle-cell disease, Tay-Sachs disease, <b>Niemann-Pick</b> <b>disease,</b> spinal muscular atrophy, and Roberts syndrome.

2500|$|When SHH {{reaches its}} target cell, it binds to the Patched-1 (PTCH1) {{receptor}} (Process [...] "3" [...] on Figure 5, the blue molecule).

It {{has been suggested that}} SMO is regulated by a small molecule, the cellular localization of which is controlled by PTCH. PTCH1 has homology to <b>Niemann-Pick</b> <b>disease,</b> type C1 (NPC1) that is known to transport lipophilic molecules across a membrane. PTCH1 has a sterol sensing domain (SSD), which {{has been shown to be}} essential for suppression of SMO activity. A current theory suggests that PTCH regulates SMO by removing oxysterols from SMO. PTCH acts like a sterol pump and removes oxysterols that have been created by 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase. Upon binding of a Hh protein or a mutation in the SSD of PTCH, the pump is turned off allowing oxysterols to accumulate around SMO.|$|E

40|$|<b>Niemann-Pick</b> <b>diseases</b> are a {{group of}} rare {{autosomal}} recessive disorders caused by an inherited deficiency of lysosomal storage with similar clinical presentations. At least three different <b>Niemann-Pick</b> (NP) <b>diseases</b> have been described, with NPA and NPB occurring {{as a result of}} a deficiency of the acid sphingomyelinase (ASM) enzyme, while NPC as a disorder that cause misregulation in cholesterol and lipids turnover, causing their accumulation in various tissues, including brain. The resulting phenotypic spectrum ranges from a severe infantile type with neurologic degeneration and death, usually by 3 years of age (NPA), to a non-neurologic adult onset form compatible with survival into adulthood (NPB) and a neurovisceral disorder with symptoms that occur at different times and progress independently (NPC). Here, we report on an Italian child born from non-consanguineous healthy parents, with a negative family history, who developed infantile spasms at the age of 5 months and clinical signs of potential storage disease. The genetic screening, performed by means of whole exome sequencing, revealed compound heterozygous mutations in the Sphingomyelin Phosphodiesterase 1 gene (SMPD 1), comprising both a homozygous polymorphism (p. V 36 A) in exon 1 and a new frameshift heterozygous deletion (c. 1187 delT) in exon 3 generating a premature stop (TAA) at codon 424 (p. L 395 fsX 29).
