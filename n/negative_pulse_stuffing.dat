40|$|Abstract—A glia is {{a nervous}} cell {{existing}} in a brain. The brain {{is composed of}} the relationship with glias and neurons. By an ion concentration, the glia transmits signal to neurons and neighboring glias. In this study, we propose the MLP with positive and <b>negative</b> <b>pulse</b> glial chain which is inspired from features of the biological glia. We add the MLP to the positive and <b>negative</b> <b>pulse</b> glial chain. In the positive and <b>negative</b> <b>pulse</b> glial chain, the glias {{are connected to the}} neurons one by one. The glia generates pulse when the glia is excited by the connected neuron’s output. If the connected neuron has large amount of output, the glia generates positive pulse. Moreover, if the connected neuron has small amount of output, the glia generates the <b>negative</b> <b>pulse.</b> The positive and <b>negative</b> <b>pulse</b> are propagated to the connected neuron and neighboring glias. We consider that the positive and <b>negative</b> <b>pulse</b> glial chain give the relationships of position of neurons in a same layer. By solving a Two-Spirals Problem (TSP), we confirm that the proposed MLP has better a learning performance and a generalization capability than the conventional MLP. I...|$|R

Combined with the characteristics of the guided drilling system, drilling fluid pulse is selected as a tool for trajectory control. <b>Negative</b> <b>pulse</b> transmission of drilling fluid is one of the key technologies to realize wellbore trajectory automatic control. In this paper, the working principle of <b>negative</b> <b>pulse</b> propagation of drilling fluid is introduced. The characteristics of <b>negative</b> <b>pulse</b> propagation and signal pretreatment of drilling fluid are analyzed emphatically. Signal correlation analysis method is proposed for signal transmission of drilling fluid negative impulse well. In this paper, the propagation characteristics of drilling fluid pressure pulsed downward transmission system are studied deeply. The influence of various drilling parameters on the drilling fluid pressure pulse is analyzed, and the model of drilling fluid pressure pulse is presented. Experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively separate useful signals from interfering signals. It is verified by field experiment that the success rate of information decode system designed by this method is high, which can meet the requirement of well trajectory precise control.|$|R
40|$|The {{interaction}} between microbubbles through pressure pulses {{has been studied}} {{to show that it}} can be a source of cavitation noise. A recent report demonstrated that the acoustic noise generated by a shrimp originates from the collapse of a cavitation bubble produced when the shrimp closes its snapper claw. The recorded acoustic signal contains a broadband noise that consists of positive and <b>negative</b> <b>pulses,</b> but a theoretical model for single bubbles fails to reproduce the negative ones. Using a nonlinear multibubble model we have shown here that the <b>negative</b> <b>pulses</b> can be explained by considering the interaction of microbubbles formed after the cavitation bubble has collapsed and fragmented: Positive pulses produced at the collapse of the microbubbles hit and impulsively compress neighboring microbubbles to generate reflected pulses whose amplitudes are negative. Discussing the details of the noise generation process, we have found that no <b>negative</b> <b>pulses</b> are generated if the internal pressure of the reflecting bubble is very high when hit by a positive pulse.

The film thickness increases while {{the size of}} pore and roughness of the film surface decreases initially and then increases with <b>negative</b> <b>pulse</b> voltage increasing. The microarc oxidation treatment considerably improved corrosion resistance, and the highest corrosion potential was- 1. 16 V, which was 0. 38 V {{higher than that of}} substrate, and the corrosion current was lower than that of substrate about three orders of magnitude. Microarc oxidation combines electrochemical oxidation with a high voltage spark treatment to form a protective ceramic coating on the surface of valve metals such as Al, Ti, Mg, which can considerably enhance wear-resistant and corrosion resistance of the metals. It is simple, energy saving and environmentally friendly. Therefore, microarc oxidation becomes a hot research topic in surface treatment [1 - 4].

This rapid (supersonic) electrical heating, although small (about 10 to the - 6 th T sub zero), produces a positive pressure perturbation (of about 10 to the - 1 st Pa), which when added to the negative electrostatic pressure perturbation generates an acoustic wave consistent with measured signals. A positive pulse always precedes the <b>negative</b> <b>pulse</b> in this model, and the positive pulse is always smaller in amplitude than the negative.
