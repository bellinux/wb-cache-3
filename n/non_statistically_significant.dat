This functionality is available in GeoDa by means of Anselin's Moran scatter plot. Note however, that the fact that a value is high in comparison with the values in neighboring locations does not necessarily means that it is an outlier as we need to assess the statistical significance of that relationship. In other words, we may find areas where there seems to be clustering or where there may seem to be clusters but when the statistical procedures are conducted they turn to be <b>non</b> <b>statistically</b> <b>significant</b> clusters or outliers. The procedures employed to assess statistical significance consists on a Monte Carlo simulation of different arrangements of the data and the construction of an empirical distribution of simulated statistics. Afterwards the value obtained originally is compared to the distribution of simulated values and if the value exceeds the 95h percentile it is said that the relation found is significant at 5%.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: We {{evaluated}} {{our experience}} with laparoscopic donor nephrectomy {{in patients with}} multiple renal arteries, comparing operative outcomes and early graft function with patients with a single renal artery. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From January 2003 to February 2009, 130 patients underwent laparoscopic donor nephrectomy at our institution, 108 (83 %) with a single renal artery and 22 (17 %) with multiple arteries. Donor and recipient outcomes for single artery and multiple arteries allografts were compared. RESULTS: The LDN operative time was similar between the single artery and multiple arteries groups (162 vs 163 min, respectively, p = 0. 87). Allografts with multiple arteries had significantly longer warm ischemia time (3. 9 vs 4. 9 min, p = 0. 05) and cold ischemia time (72 vs 94 min, p < 0. 001) than those with single artery. The conversion rate was similar between single and multiple arteries groups (6 % vs 4. 5 %, respectively, p = 0. 7). Multiple arteries grafts had a <b>non</b> <b>statistically</b> <b>significant</b> higher rate of poor graft function when compared to single artery grafts (23 % vs 12 %, respectively, p = 0. 18). Five patients in the single artery group (4. 6 %) and one patient in the multiple arteries group (4. 5 %) needed dialysis during the first postoperative week. Overall, recipient complication rates were similar between single and multiple arteries groups (12. 9 % vs 18. 1 %, respectively, p = 0. 51). CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic donor nephrectomy with multiple arteries {{was associated with a}} <b>non</b> <b>statistically</b> <b>significant</b> higher rate of poor early graft function. The procedure appears to be safe in patients with multiple arteries, with similar complications rates. Multiple arteries should not be a contraindication for laparoscopic donor nephrectomy...|$|E

40|$|AbstractIntroductionAcute STEMI is {{the most}} serious {{presentation}} of CAD. Restoration of the coronary flow facilitates cardiomyocyte salvage and decreases cardiac morbidity and mortality. However, reperfusion may result in paradoxical cardiomyocyte dysfunction, a phenomenon termed reperfusion injury. Trimetazidine is a metabolic anti-ischemic drug which is beneficial in reducing periprocedural myocardial reperfusion injury. The aim of the work is to study the effect of trimetazidine on myocardial salvage index in patients with acute STEMI who underwent primary PCI. MethodsForty patients presented with acute STEMI, underwent primary PCI with injection of an intravenous dose of Tc- 99 m labeled Sestamibi before primary PCI then first set of SPECT images were taken within 6 h from injection time to assess the initial size of the perfusion defect. Prior to discharge the patients received another dose of Tc- 99 m labeled Sestamibi and follow up SPECT images were taken to assess the final perfusion defect and to calculate myocardial salvage and myocardial salvage index. Twenty patients of them received trimetazidine before primary PCI (study group) and the other twenty patients did not receive trimetazidine (control group). Results(1) Patients with acute STEMI undergoing primary PCI who received trimetazidine before primary PCI had better myocardial salvage index, however it was <b>statistically</b> <b>non</b> <b>significant.</b> (2) <b>Statistically</b> <b>significant</b> better myocardial salvage index with post procedural TIMI 3 flow than with post procedural TIMI 2 flow among patients who received trimetazidine before primary PCI.

Laboratory studies demonstrate fused segments increase adjacent level stress including elevated intradiscal pressure and increased range of motion. Radiographic adjacent segment pathology (RASP) has been associated to ACDF in multiple statistically significant studies. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing anterior cervical discectomy and arthroplasty (ACDA) and ACDF have confirmed ACDF accelerates RASP. The question of greatest clinical interest is whether ACDA, artificial disc surgery, results in fewer adjacent level surgeries than ACDF. Current RCT follow up results reveal only <b>non</b> <b>statistically</b> <b>significant</b> trends favoring ACDA yet the post operative periods are only two to four years. Statistically significant increased RASP in ACDF patients however is already documented.

ResultsAlthough relative viscosity and conductivity of hemoglobin were significantly elevated in rats exposed to a single dose of 2  Gy, these elevations were <b>statistically</b> <b>non</b> <b>significant</b> in irradiated rats exposed to 4 and 6  Gy as compared to control animals. Serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines were significantly elevated in addition to up-regulation of hepatic NF-кB and down-regulation of p 53 and p 21 in irradiated groups. ConclusionElevated levels of hepatic NF-κB mRNA {{and low levels of}} p 53 mRNA prove lack of apoptosis and induction of the inflammatory pathway in hepatic cells to face the harmful effects of the present γ-irradiated model...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: To {{know how}} the nursing {{students}} evaluate the clinical-practical knowledge appraised at their clinical clerkship, measured through the satisfaction with the nursing staff Teaching Skills, the Perceived Support and their Global Satisfaction. Methodology: Cross-section, descriptive study carried out at the Ramon y Cajal Hospital. The target population were the 2008 / 09 nursing students at their clinical clerkship in the hospital, with a total number of 459 shifts. Questionnaire was self-designed and self-administered. Analyzed variables were the student academic year, the hospital ward and their relation with: 1. Teaching Skills, 2. Perceived Support, 3. General Satisfaction. Results: 314 questionnaires were filled out and returned, which is 69, 41 % {{of the total number}} of questionnaires. Students at the Operating Rooms and at the Paediatric Wards gave statistically significant lower qualifications (p= 0, 005 and p= 0, 003) than the Emergencies students to the nursing staff Teaching Skills. Regarding the Perceived Support, statistically significant higher scores were given to the Paediatrics (p= 0, 002) and the Surgical Wards (0, 001) compared to the Operating Rooms staff. Finally, in General Satisfaction the lowest, but <b>non</b> <b>statistically</b> <b>significant,</b> scores were given also to the Operating Rooms (p> 0, 05). Conclusions: Nursing staff from the Operating Rooms and the Paediatric Wards should ameliorate their teaching skills, and those at the Operating Rooms, also the support given during the students clinical clerkship. The proposed improvement actions suggest that meetings between supervisors, nursing staff and professors in order to discuss the teaching objectives are necessary, as well as informational sessions between students and nursing staff at the wards...|$|E

40|$|Aim. Aim of {{the study}} was to {{recognise}} the role of psychological disagreement in children and adolescents suffering from functional pain. Methods. Two groups of children, adolescents and their parents were interviewed: group H (hospitalized patients), group S (students, at school). Suitable investigations excluded organic lesions. The following data were analysed: 1) presence of pain in relation with: i) sex and age; ii) relation with parents, brothers, other relatives, schoolfellows; 2) efficacy of possible treatments. Results. Group H: 194 patients, median age 10 years; 134 referred pain: 62 out of 92 males and 72 out of 102 females; location of pain: abdomen, limbs, head, back. Family disagreements: 36, functional pain 32; schoolfellows disagreements 114, functional pain 79. Correlations of pain with sex, increasing age, family and schoolfellows disagreements: <b>non</b> <b>statistically</b> <b>significant.</b> Group S: 246 students, median age: 13 years; 188 referred pain: 78 out of 118 males and 110 out of 128 females; pain was statistically more frequent in females, it increased with age. Location of pain: limbs, abdomen, head, back. Family disagreements: 31, functional pain 28, schoolfellows disagreements 140, functional pain 114. Correlations of pain with family and schoolfellows disagreements: non-statistically significant. Several parents gave answers which were different from their children's. Pharmacological and dietary interventions failed to obtain regression of pain. Conclusion. In both groups, the referred disagreements were not statistically different among children with functional pain and those without pain; such psychological distress was not the only factor causing functional pain.
