Before an item of legislation becomes law it may be known as a bill, and may be broadly referred to as [...] "legislation", while it remains under consideration to distinguish it from other business. Legislation can have many purposes: to regulate, to authorize, to outlaw, to provide (funds), to sanction, to grant, to declare or to restrict. It may be contrasted with a <b>non-legislative</b> <b>act</b> which is adopted by an executive or administrative body under the authority of a legislative act or for implementing a legislative act.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: We {{present a}} new dataset {{on the process}} of {{decision-making}} in the European Union. With the help of the novel extracting programme 'Law Leecher ' we are able to readout information from PreLex, which contains every official legislative and <b>non-legislative</b> <b>act</b> issued by the Commission since 1976 and offers detailed information on their evolution. All documented processes are indicated including the institution involved and the date of its involvement. By extracting this information, we will provide an online accessible, monthly updated dataset that is structured in an easy-to-use fashion but leaves all substantive decisions to the individual researcher. To achieve as much transparency as possible we provide the code of 'Law Leecher' as well as the raw database. We assist the interested reader with an extensive codebook that explains the data in greater detail. The new dataset is designed to offer an objective source of information for descriptive and analytical research on decision-making of the EU. In doing so, we hope to contribute to the claim by Gabel et al (2002) : to build a common basis of data that every researcher can freely and openly use whenever the goal is to develop new or test existing theories...|$|E
50|$|Regulations and {{directives}} can {{be either}} legislative or <b>non-legislative</b> <b>acts.</b> Legislative acts are normally adopted by the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament acting together, and have their legal basis in the treaties. <b>Non-legislative</b> <b>acts</b> are adopted by the European Commission in pursuance with powers given to it by legislative acts. Their function is {{to fill in the}} detail omitted by legislative acts.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The paper {{examines}} {{the introduction of}} a distinction between legislative and <b>non-legislative</b> <b>acts</b> in the Constitutional Treaty. The drafting history and the possible implications are analyzed. Questions covered include: Was the introduction of the distinction necessary in terms of clarification or was it primarily a lever to strengthen support for more powers to the European Parliament and the Commission? Could the distinction nurture false expectations of what the EU is, or could it undermine efforts at improving transparency and enforcement of subsidiarity? The paper concludes that the distinction probably has little real significance and no serious counterproductive effects. The drafting history and analysis illustrate the pitfalls of analogies to national constitutional orders and the complexity of simplification. ...|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{focuses on}} the post-Lisbon legal {{instruments}} of the EU and the formal categorization and hierarchy of norms established by the Treaty of Lisbon. After {{a brief overview of}} the history and the rationale behind the creation of a hierarchical relationship between the legal acts of the Union, a detailed analysis of legislative, delegated and implementing acts and the related legal issues is provided. In addition, one section is devoted to <b>non-legislative</b> <b>acts</b> adopted directly {{on the basis of the}} Treaty—a category of act which appeared in the Constitutional Treaty but did not make its way into the Treaty of Lisbon. Lastly, the realization of the objectives behind the ranking of norms is discussed...|$|R
40|$|The present case {{is one of}} {{the many}} {{inter-institutional}} conflicts which recently came before the Court of Justice, dealing with controversies resulting from the Lisbon Treaty. That Treaty introduced the terms “delegated act” and “implementing act”, two <b>non-legislative</b> <b>acts,</b> in Articles 290 and 291 TFEU without making a clear distinction between them. It was therefore only a matter of time before the Court would be called upon to draw the dividing line. Biocides provided the first occasion to do so, but that opportunity was not fully seized by the Court. In Visa reciprocity however, the second case on the demarcation line between delegated and implementing acts, the Court seems to have settled the issue...|$|R
40|$|The {{reform of}} <b>non-legislative</b> <b>acts</b> {{introduced}} by Articles 290 and 291 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union {{was guided by}} concerns regarding the democratic legitimacy of (lato sensu) implementing acts of the Union. However, it has ignored the centrality of transparency in the Union's democracy {{and the role of}} participation as a complementary source of democracy. This article argues that the procedures leading to the adoption of delegated and implementing acts are subject to the treaties' provisions on transparency and participation, and should be shaped by them. It analyses the constitutional choices underlying Articles 290 and 291, with a view to assessing whether and to what extent the material, organic and functional profiles of delegated and implementing acts condition procedural rules on transparency and participation to be followed in their adoption...|$|R
40|$|Book II aims {{to fill a}} gap in the {{existing}} legal system of the EU. It links the provisions, general principles of law and values arising from primary law with the procedure for adoption of <b>non-legislative</b> <b>acts</b> of general application. Progressively over the past decades, a set of constitutional values emerged as general principles of law both in the case law of the CJ and in (incremental) Treaty amendments. Such principles have until now mainly shaped the EU’s institutional structures and decision-making procedures with regard to the EU’s formalised legislative procedure. Rule-making outside of legislative procedures, the subject matter of this book, has arguably been much less influenced by these constitutional principles. The implementation of such principles is, in any event, scattered across single provisions in some but not all policy areas. The provisions of this book are designed to ensure their systematic infusion into non-legislative rule-making more generall...|$|R
40|$|Summary: This article {{deals with}} the new {{provisions}} devoted to EU legal instruments proposed by the Constitutional Treaty and the Reform Treaty. In the first part, the changes proposed by the Constitutional Treaty and the Reform Treaty are explained {{in relation to the}} present organisation of legal instruments. Besides describing the proposed changes, an attempt is made to identify the motives behind them. In the second part, the proposed changes are assessed as to whether they represent simplifications that {{would make it easier for}} European citizens to understand the EU system. The article looks at whether different aspects of the proposed changes, such as decreasing the number of legal instruments, changing their names, or introducing a distinction between legislative and <b>non-legislative</b> <b>acts,</b> represent simplifications. The overall conclusion which follows is that the Reform Treaty does not simplify EU legal acts for EU citizens, even if there are certain changes which might be called simplifications...|$|R
40|$|The {{relative}} {{power of}} the Commission, the Parliament and the Council in the adoption of delegated and implementing acts, including {{the debate on the}} delimitation of the scope of these acts, has dominated the debate on the scheme of <b>non-legislative</b> <b>acts</b> introduced by the Lisbon Treaty. This chapter argues that approaching decision-making procedures of delegated and implementing acts only from an institutional lens is normatively insufficient, in two respects. First, it is incongruous with the Treaty provisions on democracy: not only an inter-institutional perspective is insufficient to ensure the democratic legitimacy of delegated and implementing acts, but also it ignores the relationships between the makers of legal acts and the outer sphere composed of citizens and legally affected persons. Secondly, it also overlooks core functions of procedures that are relevant to ensure the legitimacy of public acts. Procedures are a means to rationalise public action, by channeling information, weighing competing interests, and allowing scrutiny of the choices made. If designed accordingly, procedures could concretise democracy as a Union founding principle also in the making of delegated and implementing acts...|$|R
40|$|Since the Treaty of Lisbon, the {{legislative}} {{system of the}} European Union {{is based on a}} distinction between legislative <b>acts</b> and <b>non-legislative</b> <b>acts</b> as well as on a distinction between delegation and implementation. This system has brought about several issues that received a fair degree of scholarly attention prior to the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon and in the initial years thereafter. The new Interinstitutional Agreement on Better Law Making (IIA) has addressed some of these issues, but this still leaves the question open as to how this new legislative system is to be implemented in practice. This article reviews these issues, first, in light of the new IIA and, second, in light of {{the legislative}} practice that has emerged since then. The revision of the Directive on Institutions for Occupational Retirement Provision is taken as the legislative case in this respect. This case includes political conflicts between mostly national and EU legislatures but also conflicts with regard to the substance of some EU provisions. It also evaluates the role of EU agencies – in this case the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA) – within the rules of the EU’s legislative system...|$|R
40|$|Although not {{explicitly}} {{regulated by the}} EU treaties, EU agencies not only exist but also have increased in number and power. In addition, while EU agencies may exercise very similar functions {{to those of the}} Commission, Articles 290 and 291 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) do not list agencies among the possible authors of <b>non-legislative</b> <b>acts.</b> The existing situation raises the questions {{of the extent to which}} the ongoing agencification in the EU is legitimate and what its limits are. This article addresses these questions in the light of the old and new Treaties and case law, including the just released ESMA-shortselling case. It shows that while the Lisbon Treaty made a few steps forward on the road of legitimizing EU agencies and delegating important powers to them, the scope of powers that EU agencies can have remains unclear. In this respect, the European Court of Justice’s lenient approach in the ESMA-shortselling case is unfortunate because it neither clarifies the issue nor pushes the Union Legislator and the Member States to address it. Consequently, in the absence of clear limits, further agencification is likely to persist at the risk of increasing the democratic legitimacy deficit and remaining accountability gaps...|$|R
40|$|The Annulment Proceeding and the Limits to the Protection of Individuals’ Right The essay {{focuses on}} the Locus Standi of Private Applicants under Article 263. 4 TFEU and the limit to the Principle of Judicial Protection in the European Union system. In {{particular}} it highlights that notwithstanding the new formula of the norm of the Treaty, which introduces new rules of standing for private parties concerning “regulatory acts not entailing implementing measures”, {{there are still some}} grey areas in the protection of private parties under the annulment proceeding. After the analysis of the previous Article 230. 3 TEC, and the position of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) which has refused to relax its approach to standing on various occasions, despite strong criticism from many quarters, the paper describes the origin and the reasons that leads the drafters of the Treaty of Lisbon to revise the article relating to the standing of private parties adding a third category to the existing two (addressee, party directly and individually concerned) : a natural or legal person may challenge “a regulatory act which is of direct concern to them and does not entail implementing measures”. Due to the lack of definitions, the effect that the revision has on applicants depends on the judicial interpretation of the provision. The notion of these acts had raised doubts until the General Court has given a definition in case Inuit in October 2013. Before the judgment of ECJ the EU Tribunal in cases Inuit and Microban defined the “regulatory acts” as general <b>non-legislative</b> <b>acts</b> {{on the basis of a}} formal point of view. The ECJ had a chance to adopt in the appeal in Inuit a more extensive approach, but it did not. The issue raised a great debate among scholars too, dividing them between those who advocate a wider definition of “regulatory acts”, and the ones who support the ECJ interpretation. This essay will present criticisms of the latest definition set out by the ECJ and the overall effect of the new version of Article 263. 4 TFEU that does not entail a general improvement for the right of access to justice for the citizens. Although the new formula stated in Article 263. 4 has gone some way to alleviate the previous problems the restrictive interpretation of ‘regulatory act’ has limited its success preserving gaps in the protection of individuals’ right to an effective remedy...|$|R
