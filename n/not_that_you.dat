500|$|On {{potential}} crossovers with Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., Bell said in March 2016, {{in reference}} to the way Hunter and Morse were written off of that series, [...] "We want to be clear we're telling a different type of story, and in doing so, you don't want to be telling a story where you go, [...] "Why don't they call Coulson? He can fix this easily," [...] because that line's been cut. <b>Not</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> can't bring them back someday or have someone from S.H.I.E.L.D. show up on this show, but it's really setting up a different [...] universe". Blood described the situation as [...] "they're on their own, they can make up their own rules, just turn the phones on airplane mode and ignore the calls from back home".|$|E
500|$|Close to the Edge, the group's second album, was {{released}} in 1992. Certified gold by the RIAA for U.S. shipments of 500,000 copies, the album produced the Top 5 country hits [...] "In a Week or Two" [...] and [...] "Oh Me, Oh My, Sweet Baby", the latter of which was originally recorded by George Strait on his 1989 album Beyond the Blue Neon. The next singles, [...] "This Romeo Ain't Got Julie Yet" [...] and [...] "Sawmill Road", both failed to reach top 10. Roe considered Close to the Edge a weaker album than their debut because the band only had one month to pick the songs for it; in a 1994 interview with New Country magazine, he stated: [...] "There aren't ten great songs out there for everybody, certainly <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> could find in a 30-day period of time." [...] Olander was also critical of the novelty factor of [...] "This Romeo Ain't Got Julie Yet", which he co-wrote, {{saying that it was}} [...] "by far not my favorite Diamond Rio recording – but that's at the time when I'm thinkin', 'Oh, this is easy, let's write this. It's kinda cute." [...] Brian Mansfield of Allmusic was also critical of the song, but described the rest of the album with favor, saying that its [...] "strongest material emphasizes the virtues of God, family and honest living – traditional stuff, no doubt influenced by the members' bluegrass background", while Jack Hurst of the Chicago Tribune thought that [...] "In a Week or Two" [...] and [...] "Sawmill Road", [...] "which is about the diverse trails some rural schoolmates follow in adulthood", were the strongest tracks.|$|E

And as soon as You remove Yourself from them, all the Names remain like a body without a soul...All is to show how You conduct the world, but <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>You</b> have a known righteousness that is just, nor a known judgement that is merciful, nor any of these attributes at all...Blessed is God forever, amen and amen! ...|$|E

2500|$|On the whole, Gregory's tutors {{seemed to}} be happy with his progress. In November 1528, John Chekyng advised his father that [...] "Little Gregory is {{becoming}} great in letters." [...] Margaret Vernon noted in 1529, that Gregory [...] "is in good health, and is a very good scholar, and can construe his paternoster and creed. When you next come to me I doubt <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> shall like him very well." [...] At that time, young children practised reading from religious texts, the primer, containing the Paternoster, Ave Maria, Creed and other common prayers and liturgical works like the antiphonal and the psalter. In the case of boys, the learning of Latin grammar also involved religious material. An elementary exercise might take the form of studying and analysing the basic prayers in their Latin forms, as Gregory is mentioned by Vernon, learning to translate the Paternoster and the Creed from Latin.|$|E
