40|$|Graduation date: 1964 Recent {{studies have}} shown that when milk fat is heated, a {{homologous}} series containing the <b>n-alkyl</b> members of <b>methyl</b> <b>ketones</b> with odd numbers of carbon in their chains are produced (48; 44; 38; and 3). The same series of compounds also is found in evaporated and dried whole milk and in these products the concentration increases during storage (70 and 46). It is believed by some investigators that the <b>methyl</b> <b>ketones</b> {{play an important role in}} flavor deterioration of milk fat and in the aforementioned concentrated products. At the present time, however, there is disagreement on the factors influencing <b>methyl</b> <b>ketone</b> production; some workers relate their formation to autoxidation (25), while there are others who report that heat and water are essential in the reaction (48; 38 and 3). Finally, a recent report indicates that anhydrous milk fat will give rise to <b>methyl</b> <b>ketones</b> when heated in the absence of oxygen (44). The purpose of this investigation was to study the effect of various factors on the qualitative and quantitative composition of <b>methyl</b> <b>ketones</b> in heat treated milk fat. It is anticipated that the resulting information will contribute to a more thorough understanding of the reactions leading to ketone production in the fat; hence, to development of suitable processing measures for prevention of this type of deterioration in dairy products. Milk fat was prepared from raw cream two days after milking. It was washed free from phospholipids, centrifuged at 30, 000 x G for 20 minutes and degassed at two to five microns pressure for one hour. The fat was then heat treated in sealed vials at various temperatures and time periods under controlled conditions. The samples were quantitatively analyzed for <b>methyl</b> <b>ketones</b> by direct conversion of the ketones to 2, 4 -dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNP) derivatives in the intact fat sample. The derivatives were isolated from the fat, separated and identified by a combination of column and paper chromatographic methods and by their absorption spectra. <b>Methyl</b> <b>ketone</b> formation in heated milk fat was shown to be non-oxidative. A plateau in ketone production was approached in the 120 °C to 140 °C range when the time of heat treatment was 30 minutes. Added water enhanced total <b>methyl</b> <b>ketone</b> production at 140 °C but not at 200 °C. Air did not hinder ketone production. Maximum ketone production (1. 733 mM/kg fat) was noted after three hours of heat treatment at two to five microns pressure, and 140 °C. Milk fat centrifuged at 30, 000 x G for 20 minutes and degassed at two to five microns pressure for one hour was found to contain 0. 27...|$|R

40|$|The current {{chemical}} industry produces a {{diverse array of}} industrial chemicals {{from a handful of}} highly reduced byproducts (termed "platform chemicals") derived from oil refining. However, petroleum is a non-renewable resource, and increases in its cost have created pressure to convert the {{chemical industry}} into one that is renewable to ensure its long-term viability. To complete this objective, one approach is the conversion of biomass to platform chemicals through fermentation by Escherichia coli. One such platform chemical is <b>methyl</b> <b>ketone,</b> which can be readily converted to dienes that can directly replace existing platform chemicals such as ethylene. To bestow non-native <b>methyl</b> <b>ketone</b> production capability to E. coli from glucose, the polyketide biosynthesis pathway was exploited in conjunction with grafting in a heterologous <b>methyl</b> <b>ketone</b> synthesis pathway found in wild tomato species Solanum habrochaites to produce the <b>methyl</b> <b>ketones.</b> Cultivation under microaerobic conditions improved titers and yields, and further engineering to knock out the native competitive pathways that become activated under microaerobic conditions led to significantly improved strains.

40|$|The {{similarity}} {{of the pattern}} of <b>methyl</b> <b>ketones</b> obtained from the steam distillates at atmospheric pressure of cheeses made under controlled aseptic conditions, despite the wide differences in bacterial flora, led to the suspicion that the <b>methyl</b> <b>ketones</b> were being formed as artifacts. This was confirmed by steam distilling cheeses from 1 day to 13 months old when the qualitative patterns and quantitative amounts differed little with {{the age of the}} cheese. Evidence was produced to show that the greater part of these <b>methyl</b> <b>ketones</b> must be formed during the heat treatment of milk fat. The maximum quantities of <b>methyl</b> <b>ketones</b> obtainable from cheese and from milk fat, determined by exhaustive steam distillation at atmospheric pressure, averaged from 14 p. p. m. for 2 -undecanone to 46 p. p. m. for 2 -pentadecanone. Some artifact formation of <b>methyl</b> <b>ketones</b> also occurred, although to a greatly reduced extent, when dairy products containing milk fat were steam distilled under reduced pressure at 40 °. As <b>methyl</b> <b>ketones</b> in low concentrations could be extracted from mature cheese at room temperature by solvents or by flushing cheese suspension with nitrogen, milk fat appears to contain precursors which break down to <b>methyl</b> <b>ketones</b> slowly during cheese ripening, this breakdown being accelerated at higher temperatures. Two possible modes of formation of the <b>methyl</b> <b>ketones</b> with an odd number of carbon atoms, found in limiting quantity in the steam distillates of Cheddar cheese, were considered:- (a) From precursors, probably β-keto acids, bound in milk fat. (b) The β-oxidation of free fatty acids, formed by the lipolysis of milk triglycerides, and subsequent decarboxylation of the β-keto acids formed. The use of radioactive milk fat from a lactating cow which had been injected intravenously with carboxy- 14 C acetate allowed a direct comparison to be made between the labelling patterns of fatty acids and the corresponding <b>methyl</b> <b>ketones</b> from the same milk source. The {{similarity of}} the labelling patterns suggests that the C 6 to C 16 β-keto acids and the corresponding fatty acids have a common precursor (or that one is the precursor of the other) and are together incorporated into the triglycerides. Only butyric acid of the C 4 to C 16 fatty acids in all 3 milkings had a higher specific activity than the corresponding <b>methyl</b> <b>ketone.</b> This suggests that the acetone found in steam distillates of milk fat is formed from a compound (probably D-β-hydroxybutyrate), derived almost entirely from a precursor other than acetate. The finding that the saturated C 18 acid in all 3 samples of radioactive milk fat had an extremely low activity was in agreement with the fact that no C 17 <b>methyl</b> <b>ketone</b> was detected in any of the numerous steam distillates from milk fat or cheese. This supports the generally accepted view that, in the biosynthesis of milk fat, the fatty acids up to c 16 acid are synthesised from an acetate pool, whereas C 18 acids and above are obtained from the blood triglycerides. The possibility that <b>methyl</b> <b>ketones</b> were being formed in Cheddar cheese from the β-oxidation of free fatty acids, as well as from a slow breakdown of bound β-keto acids in milk fat, was shown to be improbable. Triglycerides of acids (undecanoic, nonanoic, and heptanoic), which occur normally only in traces in milk fat, were synthesised and incorporated in Cheddar cheeses. On steam distillation of these cheeses when mature, no <b>methyl</b> <b>ketones</b> corresponding to the acids in the added triglycerides were obtained, although the normal range of <b>methyl</b> <b>ketones</b> with an odd number of carbon atoms was found in the distillates. A detailed study of the metabolism of fatty acids and synthetic triglycerides by spores and mycelium of Penicillium roqueforti was undertaken, this fungus being chosen as a general representative of lipolytic organisms that might be of importance in producing Cheddar flavour. The effect of the growth medium, pH of solution, concentration of acid and inorganic ions on both oxygen uptake and <b>methyl</b> <b>ketone</b> formation was determined. The rate of <b>methyl</b> <b>ketone</b> formation suggested the synthesis of adaptive β-keto acid decarboxylases after a lag period of 1 to 2 hours. An hypothesis based upon the possible toxicity of the C 6 to C 12 β-keto acids can explain a number of the experimental results: (1) Only one <b>methyl</b> <b>ketone</b> was formed (2) The most toxic acids were those which gave the least amount of <b>methyl</b> <b>ketone</b> (3) Concentrations of the C 8 to C 12 fatty acids that markedly inhibited the respiration of mycelium were nevertheless oxidised to considerable quantities of the corresponding <b>methyl</b> <b>ketone.</b> The relationship between the toxic action of fatty acids and chain length was found to be dependent upon pH. The chain length of the most toxic acid increased with pH, being C 10 acid at pH 2. 5 and C 12 at pH's 5. 2 and 6. 0. At pH 6. 8 none of the acids from C 4 to C 18 inhibited oxygen uptake but C 14 acid was the most toxic acid at pH 8. 0. There appeared to be no sharp dividing line between the metabolic activity, with respect to fatty acids, of spores and mycelium. Mycelium oxidised fatty acids rapidly giving varying amounts of <b>methyl</b> <b>ketone</b> but considerably more CO 2 than spores. In general spores formed higher amounts of <b>methyl</b> <b>ketones</b> than mycelium but showed also a slight but definite ability to form CO 2 from octanoic acid. Evidence for a β-oxidation mechanism in the fungal metabolism of fatty acids was obtained by the use of 1 -C 14 and 2 -C 14 octanoic acids. A relatively slow movement of intermediates through the T. C. A. cycle was also indicated. High concentrations of triglycerides were oxidised slowly by spores to <b>methyl</b> <b>ketones</b> when equivalent concentrations of the free acid (up to 66 μmoles/ml) inhibited <b>methyl</b> <b>ketone</b> formation. It seems probable that the very slow rate of formation of <b>methyl</b> <b>ketones</b> is due to the inhibitory effect of the ketones themselves on the lipases. Methyl carbinols were not detected in significant amounts as products of the metabolism of <b>methyl</b> <b>ketones,</b> evidence being obtained on the contrary that the carbinols were possibly precursors of the ketones during the oxidation of fatty acids by spores. Cell free extracts obtained from mycelium were able to oxidise low concentrations of octanoic acid (0. 5 μ-moles/ml or less) after a lag of up to 3 hours. The supplementation of the extracts with several coenzymes, known to be associated with fatty acid oxidation, or with T. C. A. cycle intermediates were unable, however, to decrease the lag before oxidation started. No <b>methyl</b> <b>ketones</b> were detected after the oxidation of fatty acids by cell-free extracts but were formed when cell debris from the Hughes Press was used. This suggests that the β-keto acid decarboxylases were tightly bound to the cell walls...|$|R

Auto-ignition {{temperature}} (AIT) {{is usually}} {{defined as the}} lowest temperature at which a substance will produce hot-flame ignition in air at atmospheric pressure {{without the aid of}} an external energy source such as spark or flame.
