25|$|Syed Qutb from a {{young age}} would save up his money for a man called Amsaalih, who used to sell books around the local villages. He would have a big {{collection}} of books, and another small collection specifically for Syed Qutb. If Syed never had the money, he would tell him that I don't have the money now, so let me borrow it and I'll give it you <b>next</b> <b>time</b> <b>you</b> come around. And Amsaalih would let him do that. At the age of 12, {{he had his own}} library collection of 25 books, even though books were really expensive during that time. He would imitate the scholars by reading the books, and then give lectures {{to the rest of the}} village. If any women needed any information, they would wait till Syed Qutb came back from school, and ask him to share the knowledge he had to them. In many occasions he would be shy because he was a young man, but in some occasions he would go and teach the knowledge he had to the people who asked him.|$|E

While we mourn {{the loss of a}} very good man, we also celebrate his remarkable life and hope that it serves as an example to young people around the world to work hard to make their dreams come true, to be willing to explore and push the limits, and to selflessly serve a cause greater than themselves.

Honor his example of service, accomplishment and modesty, and the <b>next</b> <b>time</b> <b>you</b> walk outside on a clear night and see the moon smiling down at you, think of Neil Armstrong and give him a wink."

500|$|After {{the tournament}} ended, Moon was congratulated by {{professional}} poker player Phil Hellmuth, who said, [...] "I'm proud of you, Darvin." [...] Some were critical of both Moon and Cada. Mike Matusow, a professional poker player {{with a reputation}} for trash-talking, called the heads-up contest between the two [...] "a new low for poker as a skilled game". Storms Reback, of All In Magazine, said Moon was [...] "out of his league" [...] at the tournament, and made a number of questionable calls and bets. As an example, Reback cited a hand in which Moon attempted to bluff by re-raising a bet by Begleiter for 15 million chips, then folding when Begleiter went all in for an additional 6 million, even though Moon was getting better than 7-to-1 odds on his money. Moon said he planned to spend some of his World Series winnings on putting relatives through college and charitable contributions to his home town, including a new youth ball field and recreation center. Moon said of his victory, [...] "We ain't gonna change. The <b>next</b> <b>time</b> <b>you</b> see us, we'll be wearing jeans and everything else, like we always have." ...|$|E

500|$|In [...] "Where Life Begins", Madonna {{promises}} to teach [...] "a {{different kind of}} kiss" [...] to the listener. In the song, Madonna talks about the pleasures of oral sex and also references safe-sex. The sixth track is [...] "Bad Girl". It talks {{about a woman who}} would rather get drunk than end a relationship she is too neurotic to handle. The seventh song, [...] "Waiting", {{has been described as a}} [...] "yearning ballad." [...] Featuring spoken words, it addresses rejection and unrequited love. It ends with lyrics [...] "The <b>next</b> <b>time</b> <b>you</b> want pussy, just look in the mirror, baby." [...] The next track, [...] "Thief of Hearts", is a dark and rumbling song. It uses tough hip-hop language to ward off a rival for her lover's attention. It opens with the smashing of a glass, and Madonna shouting, [...] "Bitch!/Which leg do you want me to break?" [...] and later, she sneers, [...] "Little miss thinks she can have his child/Well anybody can do it." [...] "Words" [...] was compared to the previous track [...] "Thief of Hearts," [...] with music critics finding similarity in scope, each with sharp lyrics and catchy beats. The song features clattering programs and icy synth block-chords.|$|E
500|$|Christie {{commented that}} [...] "people didn't do scenes {{like that in}} those days", and that she found the scenes {{difficult}} to film: [...] "There were no available examples, no role models ... I just went blank and Nic [...] shouted instructions." [...] The scene caused problems with censors {{on both sides of}} the Atlantic. [...] The American censor advised Nicolas Roeg explicitly, saying, [...] "We cannot see humping. We cannot see the rise and fall between thighs." [...] The scene's much celebrated fragmented style, in which scenes of the couple having sexual intercourse are intercut with scenes of the couple post-coitally getting dressed to go out to dinner, partly came about through Roeg's attempt to accommodate the concerns of the censors: [...] "They scrutinised it and found absolutely nothing they could object to. If someone goes up, you cut and the <b>next</b> <b>time</b> <b>you</b> see them they're in a different position, you obviously fill in the gaps for yourself. But, technically speaking, there was no 'humping' in that scene." [...] In the end, Roeg only cut nine frames from the sequence, and the film was awarded an R rating in the United States. In Britain, the British Board of Film Classification judged the uncut version to be [...] "tasteful and integral to the plot", and a scene in which Donald Sutherland's character can be clearly seen performing oral sex on Christie's character was permitted, but it was still given an X rating—an adults only certificate.|$|E
500|$|In The Village Voice, Gary Giddins penned an angrily dismissive {{review of}} Agharta, {{in which he}} charged Davis with failing to assert his musical {{presence}} on the terribly [...] "sad" [...] record. A few days after it was published, he was sent a package full of large cotton swabs, industrial-strength scouring pads, and a card that read, [...] "The <b>next</b> <b>time</b> <b>you</b> review Miles Davis clean out your head." [...] Although Giddins dismissed the message, Agharta grew {{to become one of}} his favorite albums from the trumpeter's electric period, as he reevaluated its elements of drama, relentless tension, and what he considered the best performances of Fortune and Cosey's careers. [...] "There really is not a moment when the music fails to reflect the ministrations of the sorcerer himself", Giddins later said. Nathan Cobb from The Boston Globe reviewed the record favorably in 1976, calling it [...] "a kind of firestorm for the '70s" [...] with a [...] "positively cosmic" [...] rhythmic foundation and Davis [...] "the one who leads the others through the unknown waters of electronic jazz rock". In Down Beat, Gilmore said the band performed best on the breakneck segments opening each of the two discs, where Cosey's ferocious improvisations [...] "achieved a staggering emotional dimension" [...] lacking on the slower passages, which he felt were redeemed by Davis' elegiac trumpet playing. Lester Bangs found Agharta too difficult to definitively assess but nonetheless more fascinating than most other music being released at the time. He wrote in Phonograph Record that Davis' new music was the product of his heart's once luminous [...] "emotional capacities" [...] having been shattered by [...] "great, perhaps unbearable suffering", but that [...] "the soul beyond it" [...] could never be destroyed and interestingly [...] "almost glows uniquely brighter in its own dark coldness; and that, that which is all that is left, is merely the universe".|$|E
