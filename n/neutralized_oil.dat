40|$|Thesis (Master) [...] İzmir Institute of Technology, Food Engineering, İzmir, 2004 Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves: 58) Text in English; Abstract: Turkish and Englishxiii, 68 leavesIn this thesis, acid activation and characterization {{studies were}} conducted for different clay samples and bleaching {{capacity of the}} selected acid activated clay samples for sunflower oil were determined. The samples selected {{for this study were}} naturally occuring clays from Ankara and Eskiehir regions. The acid activated zeolite was also used for the purpose to compare its bleaching performance with commercial bleaching clay, Tonsil and the acid activated clays. The clay minerals were activated with hydrochloric acid (HCl) at three acid concentrations (1 N, 3 N, 5 N), activation times (1 h, 2 h, 3 h) and different dry clay/acid ratios. The clay samples from the Ankara and Eskiehir regions were defined as montmorillonite according to X- ray diffraction (XRD). XRD results proved that acid activation caused structural changes in the treated montmorillonites, montmorillonite peaks gradually disappearing and yielding to an amorphous montmorillonite structure. The TGA results showed a significant weight loss between 30 C - 200 C (15 %) for the Ankara clay and between 20 - 200 (12 %) for the Eskiehir clay. This was most probably due to the removal of free and hydrogen-bonded water molecules. Maximum surface area was obtained for the acid activated Ankara clay treated with 1 N HCl for 3 hours. It was determined to be 849. 1 m 2 /g. Also, maximum surface area was 269. 7 m 2 /g for the acid activated Eskiehir clay treated with 5 N HCl for 1 hour. Then the surface area of the acid activated clays decreased sharply with the acid activation. The chemical compositions of the solutions and clays after acid activation were determined using ICP and EDX analysis, respectively. According to the results, the dissolution amount of CaO, Na 2 O, MgO, K 2 O, Fe 2 O 3 and Al 2 O 3 increased along with increasing acid concentration and treatment time. The SiO 2 content and the Si 02 /Al 2 O 3 ratio increased as a result of dissolving of aluminium ions. This ratio increased from 6. 0 to 7. 5 for the acid activated Eskiehir clay and from 2. 7 to 3. 9 for acid activated Ankara clay. Acid activated clays were tested for the assessment of their bleaching efficiency for sunflower oil in the laboratory. Bleaching tests were carried out with earths prepared at different acid activation conditions such as acid concentration and activation times. The absorbance value was measured at 455 nm and found to be 0. 429 for the neutralized sunflower oil. Peroxide value and free-fatty acid content of the <b>neutralized</b> <b>oil</b> were found to be 16. 8 meq/kg and 0. 07 %, respectively. The oil bleached with the acid activated Ankara clay had a peroxide value of 46. 2 meq/kg first, which decreased to 22. 4 meq/kg and the free-fatty acid content was observed to be around 0. 08 %. For acid activated Eskiehir clay, peroxide value of the bleached oil initially increased up to 31. 2 meq/kg, then decreased under the peroxide value of <b>neutralized</b> <b>oil</b> (16. 8 meq/kg) and free-fatty acid content of bleached oil approximately was around 0. 09 %. The bleaching parameters which were used for testing were 1 % earth concentration and 30 minutes contact time at 100 °C bleaching temperature. At these selected parameters, acid activated Eskiehir clay (5 N 1 h HCl treatment), Ankara clay (1 N 3 h HCl treatment) and zeolite (2 N 6 h HNO 3 treatment) were compared with the commercial bleaching clay, Tonsil. The smallest value of absorbance and bleaching efficiency were found to be 0. 084 and 80 %, respectively with the Eskiehir clay and these values were determined to be 0. 083 and 81 % with the Tonsil under the same conditions. The absorbance value and bleaching efficiency of the bleached oil with acid activated Ankara clay were determined to be 0. 114 and 73 %, respectively using the selected bleaching parameters. Bleaching performance of Ankara clay was found to be lower when compared with the result of Eskiehir clay. At the selected bleaching point, results of lovibond red and yellow color of bleached oil indicated that the Eskiehir clay and Tonsil were close to each other in bleaching efficiency (Red color: 0. 8 and 1. 1; yellow color: 20 and 20 for Tonsil and Eskiehir clay, respectively). Zeolite did not reach the required bleaching performance. The bleaching efficiency was 25 % with raw zeolite and it hardly increased to 46 % with the acid activated zeolite. In addition, red and yellow color values were higher than the other clays (red color: 2. 6; yellow color: 30). As a result, Eskiehir clay gave a better bleaching performance compared to Ankara clay and Zeolite. Maximum bleaching efficiency was achieved after 30 minutes of contact time with 1 % earth concentration at 100 °C bleaching temperature following 5 N 1 h HCl treatment for Eskiehir clay...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Biodiesel {{consists}} of long-chain fatty acid esters, derived from renewable {{sources such as}} vegetable oils, and its utilization is associated to the substitution of the diesel oil in engines. Depending on the raw material, biodiesel can contain more or less unsaturated fatty acids in its composition, which are susceptible to oxidation reactions accelerated by exposition to oxygen and high temperatures, being able to change into polymerized compounds. The objective of this work {{was to determine the}} oxidative stability of biodiesel produced by ethanolysis of neutralized, refined, soybean frying oil waste, and partially hydrogenated soybean frying oil waste. The evaluation was conducted by means of the Rancimat equipment, at temperatures of 100 and 105 ºC, with an air flow of 20 L h- 1. The fatty acid composition was determined by GC and the iodine value was calculated. It was observed that even though the neutralized, refined and waste frying soybean oils presented close comparable iodine values, biodiesel presented different oxidative stabilities. The biodiesel from <b>neutralized</b> soybean <b>oil</b> presented greater stability, followed by the refined and the frying waste. Due to the natural antioxidants in its composition, the <b>neutralized</b> soybean <b>oil</b> promoted a larger oxidative stability of the produced biodiesel. During the deodorization process, the vegetable oils lose part of these antioxidants, therefore the biodiesel from refined soybean oil presented a reduced stability. The thermal process degrades the antioxidants, thus the biodiesel from frying waste oil resulted in lower stability, the same occuring with the biodiesel from partially hydrogenated waste oil, even though having lower iodine values than the other...|$|R

40|$|Responding to oil spills, even spills of {{moderate}} proportion, requires {{the commitment of}} substantial manpower and equipment {{on the part of}} the responsible party or the federal government. Throughout the response operation, successful spill management entails choosing the most effective and efficient countermeasures and cleanup techniques to remove or <b>neutralize</b> <b>oil</b> in the environment, minimize overall environmental damages from the spill, and insure that the objectives and expectations of government agencies, responsible parties, and the public are met. As the response progresses, effective and efficient management requires determining when response operations should be terminated.

40|$|AbstractRed {{palm oil}} is the richest natural source of {{valuable}} minor components such as carotene.

40|$|The {{final stage}} of edible soybean oil {{manufacture}} is refining, the most delicate phase of which is bleaching. At this step, undesirable substances are removed, such as pigments, traces of metals, phospholipids and certain degradation products. However, certain valua-ble compounds such as tocopherols and sterols may also be removed, significant loss of oxidative stability can occur, and fatty acid content may increase. To avoid these negative oil changes, bleaching parameters such as the concentration of bleaching clay, temperature and duration should be optimized. Since bleaching conditions depend on {{the properties of the}} bleaching clay {{as well as on the}} type of crude oil, bleaching parameters should be opti-mized with different types of clay for each vegetable oil. Since such optimization has not yet been reported for soybean oil treated with Pure-Flo ® Supreme Pro-Active bleaching ad-sorbent, this study investigates the effect of bleaching parameters on bleaching efficiency, oxidative stability and the content and composition of bioactive compounds (tocopherols and sterols) using the above mentioned clay in this type of oil. Results show that the amount of clay had the greatest influence on bleaching efficiency, especially according to the Lovi-bond scale, on transparency, and on phosphorus content.

40|$|The paper {{analyzes}} the changing INR trends over the reform period, {{in the context}} of fundamental determinants of exchange rates. In the early reform years the chief concern was to limit appreciation from inflows, and from higher domestic inflation, given the trade deficit.

We ask how the exchange rate contributed to three possible policy objectives-maintaining a real competitive exchange rate, <b>neutralizing</b> inflationary <b>oil</b> shocks, deepening foreign exchange markets and encouraging hedging. Depreciation allowed just before oil prices crashed compromised the second objective. Inadequate commitment to two-way movement, prior to the crisis, induced firms to take large currency exposures based on expected appreciation.

The effect of parameters such as time, temperature, moisture and dosage on bleaching sunflower oil was investigated.

It was determined that the ability of adsorption of the activated carbon samples at 20  °C temperature is {{higher than that of}} the bleaching earth which is used for this purpose. The analysis results directly prove that activated carbons remove the unwanted pigments and residues from sunflower oil. Moreover, activated carbon sample A 2 has a more positive effect on pigment removal than other activated carbon samples (A 1 and A 3). 1 % of activated carbon sample A 2, 0.01 % sunflower oil moisture, 20  °C temperature and 30  min contact time are optimal values in a sunflower oil bleaching process. Therefore, these activated carbon samples can be used to bleach sunflower oil instead of bleaching earth.|$|R

The objective of this research was to improve deacidification process in pilot plant scale so that the process can produce lower level of free fatty acids (FFA) and higher recovery of carotene in high yield <b>neutralized</b> red palm <b>oil</b> (NRPO). Characterization of physical and chemical properties of crude palm oil (CPO) such as moisture content, FFA and carotene contents, saponification number, iodine value, peroxide value, and color were determined before processing. Degumming was performed before deacidification process. The 17. 5 % excess of NaOH was obtained from the pilot plant scale deacidification trial. The optimization of deacidification time and temperature was carried out by using central composite design (CCD). Response surface method (RSM) was used to observe the influence of treatments on the FFA level reduction, carotene recovery, and NRPO yield. The result showed that the optimum deacidification condition was at 61 ± 2 °C in 26 minutes, and at the 16 °Be NaOH strength with 17. 5 % excess of NaOH. In this optimum condition, the process achieved 96. 35 % of FFA reduction, 87. 30 % of carotene recovery, and 90. 16 % of NRPO yield...|$|R
40|$|O objetivo desta dissertaÃÃo foi otimizar o processo de produÃÃo de {{biodiesel}} pela reaÃÃo de transesterificaÃÃo do Ãleo de mamona via rota metÃlica, aplicando tÃcnicas de adsorÃÃo para a remoÃÃo da Ãgua formada durante a reaÃÃo de produÃÃo do catalisador bÃsico homogÃneo (hidrÃxido de potÃssio + metanol [...] metÃxido de potÃssio + Ãgua) e reduzindo a acidez do Ãleo de mamona. A Ãgua, formada junto com o metÃxido de potÃssio, quando em contato com os triglicerÃdeos do Ãleo, reage atravÃs de uma reaÃÃo secundÃria de saponificaÃÃo, produzindo sabÃo e reduzindo o rendimento da reaÃÃo de transesterificaÃÃo. Foram realizados estudos preliminares de adsorÃÃo com o sistema metanol/Ãgua para a determinaÃÃo dos dados de equilÃbrio e cinÃtica de adsorÃÃo com o zeolito 3 A. Realizou-se um planejamento experimental para estudar as variÃveis que interferem na formaÃÃo da Ãgua e do metÃxido de potÃssio como, a concentraÃÃo de KOH e a concentraÃÃo de adsorvente colocada no meio reacional. Para a resposta quantidade de metilato formado, apenas a variÃvel independente concentraÃÃo de KOH mostrou-se estatisticamente significativa para um intervalo de confianÃa de 90 %. Para a resposta quantidade de Ãgua presente no meio reacional, apenas a interaÃÃo entre a concentraÃÃo de KOH e a concentraÃÃo de adsorvente, ambos no modelo linear, foram estatisticamente significativos. Realizou-se tambÃm estudos de adsorÃÃo no catalisador em uma coluna de leito fixo, na qual avaliou-se a influÃncia do tamanho do diÃmetro da partÃcula (3, 1 mm; 3, 68 mm e 4, 38 mm) e da vazÃo de alimentaÃÃo (2 e 6 mL/min). A melhor condiÃÃo dos parÃmetros estudados foi para o menor diÃmetro da partÃcula e para a maior vazÃo e alimentaÃÃo, pois observou-se uma reduÃÃo da resistÃncia a transferÃncia de massa a nÃvel externo a partÃcula adsorvente. Realizou-se reaÃÃes de transesterificaÃÃo em diferentes condiÃÃes para avaliar o efeito da acidez do Ãleo de mamona e da remoÃÃo de Ãgua por adsorÃÃo no catalisador. O Ãleo de mamona tinha uma acidez de 4 mgKOH/g, considerada alta para ser utilizado na reaÃÃo de transesterificaÃÃo. Para reduzir esta acidez, realizou-se uma etapa de neutralizaÃÃo deste Ãleo utilizando o co-produto da reaÃÃo, fase glicerinosa. Obteve-se um bom resultado com a reduÃÃo da acidez para 0, 48 mgKOH/g. Observou-se que a maior conversÃo em Ãsteres metÃlicos foi de 93, 79 % para o biodiesel preparado a partir da reaÃÃo de transesterificaÃÃo do Ãleo de mamona neutralizado e com o catalisador oriundo do processo de adsorÃÃo. Observou-se que a adsorÃÃo no catalisador apresenta uma melhora de 12 % nos resultados de conversÃo e Ãsteres metÃlicos. This dissertation {{aimed to}} optimize the transesterification reaction for biodiesel production using castor oil and a basic homogeneous catalyst. To the reaction was analyzed for catalyst production (sodium hydroxide + methanol methoxide potassium + water) and by reducing the castor oil, acid value. Adsorption was applied to remove the water formed in the process, because water deactivates the catalyst and shifts the equilibrium towards the hydrolysis reaction, forming soap. The thermodynamic and kinetic study of liquid phase adsorption of methanol-water mixtures was carried out using zeolite 3 A as adsorbent. An experimental design was carried out for the reaction for catalyst production. The variables concentration of KOH and adsorbent concentration in the reaction were investigated. The concentration of KOH was the most statistically significant response {{on the amount of}} methoxide formed during the production of the catalyst (within a 90 % level of confidence). To the amount of water present in the reaction, just the interaction between the concentration of KOH and the adsorbent concentration, both in the linear term, were statistically significant. Tests for catalyst production in a porous bed were carried out. The studied factors were average grain size (3, 1 mm; 3, 68 mm and 4, 38 mm) and uptake flow rate (2 and to 6 mL/min). The best condition were the smallest diameter of the particle and the highest uptake flow rate, because there was a reduction of resistance to mass transfer at the particle sorbent. The transesterification reaction were carried out in different conditions to evaluate the effect of the acidity of the castor oil and the effect of the removal of water by adsorption during the production of the catalyst. The castor oil presented an acidity of 4 mgKOH/g which can be considered high {{to be used in the}} transesterification reaction. To reduce the acidity, a neutralization step of oil using the co-product of the reaction (glycerin). The neutralization step with glycerin was able to reduce the acidity to 0, 48 mgKOH / g. It was observed that the conversion into methyl esters was as high as 93, 79 % for biodiesel prepared from the transesterification reaction of the castor <b>oil</b> <b>neutralized</b> with the catalyst produced using the adsorption process. It was observed that the use of adsorption of water in producing catalyst presented an improvement by 12 % in the conversion of oil into methyl esters...|$|R
40|$|In this study,Three {{kinds of}} drying oils for the {{manufacturing}} water soluble air-drying alkyd resins,then blend {{it with a}} high imino methylated melamine resin crosslinker, neutralizing agents and other additives for wood coatings and then the properties of paints were investigated. The molecular weight and its distribution were determined by Gel Permeation Chromatography (GPC). The rheological properties were measured by Viscometer, and the drying time of film was obtained by drying recorder. The crosslinking reaction and weatherability were determined by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR). Differential Scanning Calorimeter (DSC) {{was used to evaluate}} the curing kinetics. It was found that the nature of drying <b>oils,</b> <b>neutralizing</b> agents, and cosolvents would significantly influence on the molecular weight, viscosity, stability, drying time and curing kinetics of the paints. When the tung/castor oil, was used as resin generally it showed a higher molecular weight and viscosity than those using soybean or linseed <b>oil.</b> The diethylamine <b>neutralizing</b> agent for paints exhibited the best stability and lower viscosity, In contrast, ammonia exhibited lower stability. The paints which included the resin that using linseed oil,ammonia and butyl cellosolve (EGMBE), showing the fastest drying time for coating film. However, the drying time of the film was found to be significantly decreased, due to blending it with high imino methylated melamine resin. But the crosslinking peak was very weak on the FTIR plot. It was also found that below 109 ℃ during the solvent evaporation stage,the endothermic peak occurred and it would suppress the DSC exotherm associated with the autooxidation crosslinking reaction. However,the temperature was above 109 ℃,the solvent would be completely evaporated,and exothermic reaction would occur,therefore the crosslinking reaction of amino alkyd resin at high temperature would be performed. It was found that the solvent may significantly influence on thermal behavior, and it was also found that the alkyd resin with more iodine value and lower preexponential constant (InZ) and lower activation energy, generally it would have a short drying time. The physical and chemical properties of the coating film depended on the rate of evaporation and stability of the neutralizing agent and the number of unsaturated double bond and hydroxyl group of oil modified alkyd resin. The paints those including the neutralizing agent and using ammonia, showed the best film hardness and water-resistance; but the paint using diethylamine system, exhibited a higher thermal degradation than that of the other 2 kinds of neutralizing agents. Regarding the evaluation of paint which contained a drying oil, linseed oil modified resin, it had a higher film hardness. In contrast, a blend of the drying oil which soybean oil was used as modified resin, it showed both better water-resistance and thermal degradation-resistance. In addition, whatever the substrate was used as coating, {{it was found that the}} film had good flexibility after 15 cycles of cold and hot treatment. In order to qualify the weatherability, the coated wood was placed in the artificially accelerated weatherometer (enclosed carbon-arc type) for 240 hours. The paint system which included ammonia and soybean oil modified resin still maintained a higher gloss retention than that of the other formulations. In addition,the film of the coated wood appeared to have better appearance after 240 hours of exposure. According to the SRS-FTIR measurement, the absorption peak of the methoxyl group (915 cm- 1) and alkyl group (1376 cm- 1) disappeared after 240 hours of exposure. The absorption peak of the triazine ring (1556 cm- 1) disappeared after 268 hours, while the absorption peaks of the carbonyl group(1710 cm- 1, 1721 cm- 1) increased after 268 hours. It was found that the fastest drying time for coating film in air was the alkyd resin containing 5 % trimethylol propane diallyl ether (TMPDAE). Alkyd resin containing 10 % or 15 % had a longer drying time, therefore it would not have any improved effect. With a relative humidity under 65 % and various temperature, it was found that in creasing the temperature resulted in an increased speed of the drying of the film. It also indicated the synergism of both temperature and relative humidity in affecting the drying rate of film. The alkyd resin coating containing 5 % TMPDAE in air at 50 ℃ and under 45 % RH, 2 hours drying time would be required. When UV illumination was applied, the drying time was reduced to 1 hour. Under these condition, the drying time of film was 9 - 18 times faster than drying in air at 25 ℃ and under 65 %RH condition. With a DSC experiment, it was found that increasing the TMPDAE content, resulted in an increasing in the speed of the crosslinking reaction of the film. This indicated that the synergism of temperature and TMPDAE would affect the rate of crosslinking reaction. 高亞胺型甲基化三聚氰胺樹脂可作為水溶性醇酸樹脂之架橋劑，在不需添加酸觸媒下能夠調配氣乾型水性塗料。使用膠體滲透層析儀 (GPC) ， 霍氏 轉換紅外線光譜儀(FTIR) ，示差掃瞄熱卡儀(DSC) 及其他相關儀器 ，評估 樹脂塗料系統之性質及塗膜性能，結果歸納如下： 1. 樹脂塗料之分子量、黏度、穩定性、乾燥性、硬化動力學及塗膜物理 化學性能，主要受乾性油種類，中和劑種類所影響。桐油／篦麻油者 顯示最高分子量及黏度，依次為大豆油及亞麻仁油者；二乙胺中和之 塗料具有最佳穩定性及低黏度；氨者則穩定性最差，含亞麻仁油變性 之結合劑、氨中和劑及乙二醇單丁醚(EGMBE) 共溶劑之配方，塗膜乾 燥速度最快。 2.
