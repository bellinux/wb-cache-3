There is widespread agreement that the financial sector is most seriously affected by persistent inflation. This was also true for Argentina. Due to interest rate ceilings and other regulations relative yields on particular financial assets have been affected differently by inflation. While the holdings of <b>non-interest</b> <b>bearing</b> assets (currency in circulation and demand deposits) were fully exposed to the inflation tax, time deposits at a controlled rate or indexed deposits were partially protected from inflation losses, however, at varying degrees.

This study focused on the determinants like capital adequacy, earnings quality and leverage those affect the profitability of Islamic banking. For this study researchers selected five Islamic banks and collected secondary data from the financial statements of the banks during 2011 - 2014. The study showed that capital adequacy and leverage were positively related with profitability {{but there was a}} negative correlation between cost to income ratio and return on asset (ROA) of the selected bank during that period.

40|$|We generalize a money-in-the-utility {{function}} model to include interest-bearing deposits {{and use the}} model to estimate the welfare cost of inflation. In the model, the user cost of deposits is invariant to inflation in steady state. Currency and deposits {{are assumed to be}} weakly separable and the model is calibrated using index number methods. We find that the welfare cost of inflation is substantially lower in the model with interest-bearing deposits than in models where all monetary assets are assumed to be <b>non-interest</b> <b>bearing.</b> We also show that higher inflation can raise or lower the rate of convergence to steady state depending on the coefficient of relative risk aversion, but the effect is weak. We provide evidence for OECD countries suggesting {{that there could be a}} positive effect of inflation on user costs, which would lead to higher welfare cost estimates. ...|$|R
5000|$|The Baumol-Tobin {{model is}} an {{economic}} model of the transactions demand for money as developed independently by William Baumol (1952) and James Tobin (1956). The theory relies on the tradeoff between the liquidity provided by holding money (the ability to carry out transactions) and the interest forgone by holding one’s assets {{in the form of}} <b>non-interest</b> <b>bearing</b> money. The key variables of the demand for money are then the nominal interest rate, the level of real income that corresponds to the amount of desired transactions, and the fixed transaction costs of transferring one’s wealth between liquid money and interest-bearing assets. The model was originally developed to provide microfoundations for aggregate money demand functions commonly used in Keynesian and monetarist macroeconomic models of the time. Later, the model was extended to a general equilibrium setting by Boyan Jovanovic (1982) and David Romer (1986).|$|R
40|$|The paper {{looks at}} the {{relationship}} between reserve requirements and {{the choice of the}} maturity structure of external debt in a general equilibrium setup, by incorporating the role of international lenders. A date- and maturity-specific reserve requirement is a fraction of the debt to be deposited in a <b>non-interest</b> <b>bearing</b> account at the central bank. At maturity, the central bank returns the reserves. There exist some specific combinations of date- and maturity-specific reserve requirements that reduce the vulnerability to bank runs. In such setup, lenders may still want to provide new short-term lending to the bank after a bank run.

40|$|The narrow banking {{proposal}} {{defining a}} class of safe and liquid assets (generally sovereign Government securities) for investments by weak banks, backed fully by demand liabilities (generally <b>non-interest</b> <b>bearing</b> deposits) has been considered {{as a means of}} deposit protection and a possible solution to the banking problems. The paper seeks to explain the theoretical implications of the proposal and examine its implications for the Indian public sector banks facing large non-performing loans. The evidence presented shows that even without a directive, narrow banking on the asset side is already being practised as part of the asset-liability management by these banks. However, given the structure of deposit ownership, narrow banking in its strict sense does not afford a solution to reforming weak banks. Strictly practiced narrow banking can neither guarantee deposit protection not turn around the weak banks. On the contrary, it may expose weak banks to immense market and interest rate risks which can make the banking system vulnerable to idiosyncratic and systemic risks arising from macroeconomic shocks. The paper however recognises that some contraction in the scale of operations of weak banks seems to be an unavoidable by-product of measures which may be necessary to strengthen weak banks. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with delineating conditions under which public financial policies have no real and/or price effects. In the absence of intergenerational distribution effects, public financial policy is irrelevant:an increase in government debt (whether indexed or not), an exchange of anindexed bond for a non-indexed bond, or an exchange of a short term bond fora long term bond has neither real nor financial effects. We also describe changes in financial policy in which the supply of bonds are increased and the nominal interest rate increases, which {{have an effect on}} the rate of inflation, but no real effects. We examine the implications of price and wage rigidities and the existence of a <b>non-interest</b> <b>bearing</b> financial asset used for transactions purposes for the validity of these irrelevance theorems. In general, public financial policies have effects on intergenerational distribution; alternative financial policies have implications for the pattern of capital accumulation (an effect which was the center of the literature on money and growth) and on the sharing of risks among members of different generations. We examine the consequences of three alternative financial policies,a fixed supply of financial assets, a fixed price level, and a fixed real supply of government indebtedness; under some plausible conditions, the latter policy may provide for the least intergenerational variability inconsumption. ...|$|R
