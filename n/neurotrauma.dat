The study, [...] "Detected Cognitive Impairment in High School Football Players Without Clinically Diagnosed Concussion", {{was published in}} 2013 in the Journal of <b>Neurotrauma</b> and observed 21 high school players throughout a season; [...] it determined that even players who would not be diagnosed with a concussion based on their symptoms can display notable impairments via MRIs and verbal or cognitive testing, indicating that the current tests used on the sideline to assess concussions may not be adequate. A 2013 study by the National Academy of Sciences found that concussion rates in college football exceed those in any other sport, and that high school players have twice the risk of sustaining a concussion as collegiate players. The study found that, as reported by athletic trainers, college football players sustain 6.3 concussions for every 10,000 athletic exposures (meaning an individual practice or game), and the rate for high school football players is 11.2.

40|$|Substantial {{quantities}} of glutamate and {{reactive oxygen species}} are released following <b>neurotraumas.</b> Present work establishes that administering glutamate into the spinal cord at {{the level at which}} it is released following spinal cord injury did not significantly change the levels of superoxide or malondialdehyde released, nor did it change the ratio of the concentrations of reduced glutathione to oxidized glutathione, i. e., the redox state of the exposed tissue. Nonetheless, administering into the spinal cord the level of glutamate released by spinal cord injury substantially increased neuron death. Thus mechanisms of glutamate toxicity other than the generation of toxic oxygen species likely mediate the secondary damage that accompanies spinal cord injury. 清华大学，东南大学，南京大学，西北大...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Neurodegenerative {{diseases}} and <b>neurotraumas</b> typically result in apoptosis of specific neurons {{leading to the}} pathology observed during the disease state. Existing treatments target the symptoms instead of preventing the death of these neurons. Although neuroprotective drugs should be useful as a treatment to prevent further loss of neurons, efficacious molecules are lacking. FK 506 (tacrolimus), a widely used immunosuppressant drug, has significant neuroprotective and neuroregenerative properties throughout the central nervous system, including the eye. FK 506 achieves these properties through interaction with FK 506 binding proteins (FKBP), including FK 506 binding protein 51 (FKBP 51). In this study, we {{examine the effects of}} FKBP 51 as a neuroprotective agent on a neuronal cell line. Methods: We cultured 661 w cell cultures with or without FK 506, or stably transfected them with an FKBP 51 expression vector. These cells were then exposed to the apoptosis-inducing agent staurosporine. Cell viability was determined using a calcein AM/propidium iodide assay. Protein levels and activation of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) were determined by western immunoblot analysis. Results: FKBP 51 overexpression significantly protected 661 w cell cultures from staurosporine-induced apoptosis. FKBP 51 overexpression also significantly increased NF-κB p 65 protein levels and activated NF-κB p 65. FK 506 treatment significantly protected 661 w neuronal cultures from staurosporine-induced apoptosis. FK 506 increased FKBP 51, NF-κB p 65, and levels of activated NF-κB p 65 protein...|$|R
40|$|Doxorubicin causes toxic {{side effects}} which result in {{profound}} changes in various organs including the heart muscle, {{which leads to}} the development of cardiomyopathy, with further complications, as our earlier studies have shown. But there are complications in treatment by anthracycline chemotherapy. The reduction of toxicity of cytotoxic drugs without reduction of their antitumor action remains an important medical challenge. The S- 100 b and glial fibrillar acid protein (GFAP) are the key astroglial proteins which are widely used as biomarkers for <b>neurotraumas</b> and strokes. Thus the purpose of our work was to study the GFAP and S- 100 b levels under the experimental model of doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy and the effect of the cytostatic separately or combined with Humilid. The level of studied proteins was measured by ELISA using monospecific antibodies against GFAP and S- 100 b (Sigma, USA), secondary anti-IgG labeled with horseradish peroxidase (Sigma, USA) and GFAP and S- 100 b standards (Sigma, USA). The experiment was conducted on white Wistar male rats weighing 210 ± 50 g, which were divided into 3 groups with 8 animals in each: 1 – control, rats received saline i/p, 2 – doxorubicin 1 mg/kg i/p once weekly during 4 weeks, 3 – doxorubicin by the same scheme plus 0. 01 % solution of Humilid during 4 weeks. Under impact of doxorubicin an increase of fibrillar GFAP content in the rats’ hippocampus was shown, which may have occurred {{as a result of the}} proliferation of astrocytes. An increase of concentration of S- 100 b to 20 – 26 % compared with the control animals was also detected in the hippocampus, thalamus and the cerebral cortex of the studied animals. Concomitant administration of doxorubicin with Humilid partially prevented the increase in concentration of GFAP and S- 100 b in the rats’ hippocampus. The reciprocal change in the level of S- 100 b and GFAP in the peripheral nervous system of the heart tissue was defined with a high degree of correlation under impact of doxorubicin. Accordingly, we have proposed the hypothesis that the increase in of the filament GFAP in the hippocampus may occur due to the development of the ischemic state under the impact of doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy. Humilid with doxorubicin prevented changes in the researched astroglial proteins of the heart muscle and brain parts of rats...|$|R

40|$|Die Rückenmarkverletzung, als abgrenzbare Entität des <b>Neurotraumas,</b> führt zu schwerwiegenden Konsequenzen mit zumeist starker Beeinträchtigung der senso-motorischen Funktionen unterhalb der Läsion. Tierexperimentelle Studienergebnisse der Pathophysiologie ermutigten Wissenschaftler die These zu formulieren, dass die Gabe von Substanzen, direkt nach der Verletzung, den Heilungs- und Regenerationsprozess beim Menschen positiv beeinflussen könnten. In der vorliegenden Arbeit wurden die klinischen, randomisierten und kontrollierten Studien zu pharmakologischen Interventionen in der akuten Phase nach Rückenmarkverletzung genauer untersucht und in einer Übersicht dargestellt. Die Studien zeichneten sich, im Vergleich zu anderen Interventionsstudien nach Rückenmarkverletzung, durch eine hohe Patientenpopulation aus. Schwierigkeiten bestehen im Besonderen bei der Studienqualität (neurologische Funktionsmessung, statistische Methoden, Veröffentlichungsart, Schlussfolgerung der Studienautoren). Die Bildung von Subpopulationen führte in keiner Studie zu homogenen Daten, da die lineare Summation der ordinalen senso-motorischen Punktwerte (nach ASIA) mathematisch nicht zulässig ist. Wir konnten aufzeigen, wie diese Daten linearisiert und in Beziehung zu der potentiellen neurologischen Funktionserholung der Patienten, ausgewertet werden können. Vorteile bestehen in der erweiterten Differenzierungsfähigkeit der Erholung, Ausschaltung von Grenzeffekten durch die begrenzte potentielle Erholung einzelner Patientenpopulationen und der Einsatz von linearen statistischen Methoden. Es konnten weiterhin dargestellt werden, dass die Aussagekraft der Studien anhand der Einteilung der Canadian Task Force on the Periodic Health Examination (Evidenzklassen I-III) nur unzureichend beurteilbar ist. Weitere Qualitäts- und Validitätsmerkmale müssen berücksichtigt werden. Spinal cord injury, as {{an entity}} of {{neurological}} trauma, leads to serious consequences with usually severe impairment of the sensory-motor functions beneath the lesion. Pathophysiological study results from experiments on animals have encouraged scientists to formulate {{the thesis that}} the administering of substances directly after the injury could positively influence the healing and regeneration process in human. In the present work, the clinical, randomised and controlled studies on pharmacological interventions in the acute phase after spinal cord injury have been examined more closely and presented in a summary. In comparison to other intervention studies after spinal cord injury, these studies are distinguished by a high patient population. In particular, difficulties exist in study quality (measurement of neurological function, statistical methods, type of publication, the reasoning of the study authors). In none of the studies did the formation of sub-populations lead to homogeneous data, because the linear summation of the ordinal sensory-motor point values (according to ASIA) is not mathematically permissible. We were able to show how this data might be linearised and analysed {{in relation to the}} potential recovery of the neurological function of the patients. Advantages exist in the increased ability to differentiate recovery, the elimination of threshold effects by the limited potential recovery of individual patient populations, and the use of linear statistical methods. It was also shown that, {{on the basis of the}} classification of the Canadian Task Force on the Periodic Health Examination (Evidence Classes I-III), the explanatory power of the studies cannot be sufficiently assessed.

50|$|Blast {{injuries}} {{can cause}} hidden sensory and brain damage, with potential neurological and neurosensory consequences. It {{is a complex}} clinical syndrome caused by the combination of all blast effects, i.e., primary, secondary, tertiary and quaternary blast mechanisms. It is noteworthy that blast injuries usually manifest in a form of polytrauma, i.e. injury involving multiple organs or organ systems. Bleeding from injured organs such as lungs or bowel causes a lack of oxygen in all vital organs, including the brain. Damage of the lungs reduces the surface for oxygen uptake from the air, {{reducing the amount of}} the oxygen delivered to the brain. Tissue destruction initiates the synthesis and release of hormones or mediators into the blood which, when delivered to the brain, change its function. Irritation of the nerve endings in injured peripheral tissue or organs also contributes significantly to blast-induced <b>neurotrauma.</b>|$|E
