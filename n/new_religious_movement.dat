40|$|The {{violence}} of Aum Shinrikyo has had four observable consequences for <b>new</b> <b>religious</b> <b>movements</b> in Japan: {{a change in}} posture by the Japanese government toward <b>new</b> <b>religious</b> <b>movements,</b> stricter laws and regulations regarding <b>new</b> <b>religious</b> <b>movements</b> and tighter enforcement of those laws, a growing skepticism {{by the media and}} scholars towards <b>new</b> <b>religious</b> <b>movements,</b> and increasing skepticism about new religions movements among community groups and the public at large. This study will show that the crimes of Aum Shinrikyo have created a shift in Japan 2 ̆ 7 s society resulting in a contraction of operational space available to Japan 2 ̆ 7 s <b>new</b> <b>religious</b> <b>movements.</b> For this study `operational space 2 ̆ 7 refers to the sociopolitical boundaries in which a group can operate, in other words, a religion 2 ̆ 7 s freedom to believe, practice, organize, and conduct economic activities free from government restriction and undue influence by other individuals or groups. The proposed thesis will be illustrated by several case studies that look specifically at particular instances of contraction of operational space for Japanese <b>new</b> <b>religious</b> <b>movements</b> including Soka Gakkai, Hono-hana Sanpogyo, The Unification Church of Japan (Toitsu Kyokai) and Panawave Laboratory. Each case study will analyze how interactions between Japanese new religions movements and aspects or segments of Japanese society have changed due to a paradigm shift caused by the crimes of Aum. The thesis is supported by a theoretical framework that draws on theories of Japanese <b>new</b> <b>religious</b> <b>movements</b> and theories of religion and violence. The research builds upon this framework through in-depth study of writings by leaders of Japanese <b>new</b> <b>religious</b> <b>movements</b> (particularly the writings of Aum leader Asahara Shoko, Japanese and Western scholarship on <b>new</b> <b>religious</b> <b>movements,</b> as well as government documents, media reports, personal interviews and field observations to produce a unique analysis of the Post-Aum Era for Japan 2 ̆ 7 s <b>new</b> <b>religious</b> <b>movements...</b>|$|R

5|$|Heathenry, also termed Heathenism or Germanic Neopaganism, is {{a modern}} Pagan religion. Scholars of {{religious}} studies classify Heathenry as a <b>new</b> <b>religious</b> <b>movement.</b> Its practitioners model their faith on the pre-Christian belief systems adhered to by the Germanic peoples of Iron Age and Early Medieval Europe. To reconstruct these past belief systems, Heathenry uses surviving historical, archaeological, and folkloric evidence as a basis, although approaches to this material vary considerably.|$|E

50|$|Beckford's {{doctoral}} thesis {{was the first}} major sociological study of the Jehovah's Witnesses, The Trumpet of Prophecy (1975), which has remained an important reference work on the group. His research focus then shifted to cults and <b>new</b> <b>religious</b> <b>movements</b> and the responses they provoke from wider society. On the basis of his empirical studies of the anti-cult movement in Britain, France and Germany, Beckford contended that the responses to <b>new</b> <b>religious</b> <b>movements</b> reveal as much about a society as studies of the relevant movements themselves. He explored this topic further in Cult Controversies: Societal Responses to <b>New</b> <b>Religious</b> <b>Movements,</b> highlighting the differing ways movement members (and ex-members) relate {{to each other and to}} the surrounding society, and proposing that these differences could serve as the basis of a new model for classifying <b>new</b> <b>religious</b> <b>movements.</b>|$|R

Meanwhile, in Saigon, the Bình Xuyên organised crime syndicate ruled {{much of the city}} through its gangster militia. These three southern forces vied for control of southern Vietnam with the main protagonists: the French, who were attempting to re-establish colonial control across the entire nation; and the communist-dominated Việt Minh, who sought Vietnamese independence.|$|E
40|$|The purpose {{with this}} study is to {{research}} how <b>new</b> <b>religious</b> <b>movements</b> are depicted, in textbooks used for upper secondary school in religious education, in contrast to how Christianity is depicted, {{and if there is a}} more negative depiction around <b>new</b> <b>religious</b> <b>movements.</b> The content analysis uses/investigates three chosen textbooks, all written for Swedish upper secondary education. The content analysis uses quantitatively research whereas the depiction of Christianity and <b>new</b> <b>religious</b> <b>movements</b> are investigated by counting as well as analyzing adjectives used to describe, furthermore what emotive value the adjectives carry. Through qualitative and quantitative analysis the syntheses of an adjective the study shows that more negatively charged adjectives are more common describing <b>new</b> <b>religious</b> <b>movements</b> in two of the textbooks and throughout all textbooks, Christianity is described positively...|$|R

5|$|Murray {{also became}} closely {{involved}} in the first-wave feminist movement, joining the Women's Social and Political Union and devoting much time to improving women's status at UCL. Unable to return to Egypt due to the First World War, she focused her research on the witch-cult hypothesis, {{the theory that the}} witch trials of Early Modern Christendom were an attempt to extinguish a surviving pre-Christian, pagan religion devoted to a Horned God. Although later academically discredited, the theory gained widespread attention and proved a significant influence on the emerging <b>new</b> <b>religious</b> <b>movement</b> of Wicca. From 1921 to 1931 Murray undertook excavations of prehistoric sites on Malta and Menorca and developed her interest in folkloristics. Awarded an honorary doctorate in 1927, she was appointed assistant professor in 1928 and retired from UCL in 1935. That year she visited Palestine to aid Petrie's excavation of Tall al-Ajjul and in 1937 she led a small excavation at Petra in Jordan. Taking on the presidency of the Folklore Society in later life, she lectured at such institutions as the University of Cambridge and City Literary Institute, and continued to publish in an independent capacity until her death.|$|E
5|$|Today, Christians make up 57% of the state's population, with Protestants {{making up}} 21% of them. Roman Catholics make up 34% and now predominate because of massive {{immigration}} from primarily Catholic countries and regions – chiefly Ireland, Italy, Poland, Portugal, Quebec, and Latin America. Both Protestant and Roman Catholic communities {{have been in}} decline since the late 20th century, due {{to the rise of}} irreligion in New England. It is the most irreligious region of the country, along with the Western United States. A significant Jewish population immigrated to the Boston and Springfield areas between 1880 and 1920. Jews currently make up 3% of the population. Mary Baker Eddy made the Boston Mother Church of Christian Science serve as the world headquarters of this <b>new</b> <b>religious</b> <b>movement.</b> Buddhists, Pagans, Hindus, Seventh-day Adventists, Muslims, and Mormons can also be found. Kripalu Center in Stockbridge, the Shaolin Meditation Temple in Springfield, and the Insight Meditation Center in Barre are examples of non-Abrahamic religious centers in Massachusetts. According to 2010 data from The Association of Religion Data Archives, (ARDA) the largest single denominations are the Catholic Church with 2,940,199 adherents; the United Church of Christ with 86,639 adherents; and the Episcopal Church with 81,999 adherents. 32% of the population identifies as having no religion.|$|E
