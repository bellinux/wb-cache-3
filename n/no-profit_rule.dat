40|$|Reflects on {{the debate}} {{surrounding}} key aspects of UK fiduciary law. Reviews {{the circumstances in which}} a fiduciary relationship may be found by the courts, whether an effective definition of "fiduciary relationship" exists {{and the extent to which}} such relationships may arise in a commercial context. Discusses the nature of fiduciary liability and considers whether the strict application of the <b>no-profit</b> <b>rule</b> should be relaxed in certain circumstances...|$|E
40|$|It is a well-entrenched {{principle}} of corporate law that a director has a fiduciary duty {{not to make}} a secret profit out of his trust, and generally must not place himself in a position in which his duty and self-interest may conflict (Aberdeen Railway Co v Blaikie Bros (1854) 2 Eq Rep 12 461; Regal (Hastings) Ltd v Gulliver [1967] 2 AC 134 (HL); Robinson v Randfontein Gold Mining Co Ltd 1921 AD 168; Phillips v Fieldstone Africa (Pty) Ltd 2004 (3) SA 465 (SCA); Bhullar v Bhullar [2003] 2 BCLC 241 (CA);MS Blackman, R D Jooste, G K Everingham, M Larkin, C H Rademeyer & J L Yeats Commentary on the Companies Act Volume 2 (2008) 8 - 30). This broader principle may be subdivided into two categories, namely the corporate opportunity rule and the <b>no-profit</b> <b>rule.</b> This article was written by Maleka Femida Cassim before she joined the University of Pretoria.

40|$|Conventional wisdom {{holds that}} the {{fiduciary}} duty of loyalty is a prophylactic rule that serves to deter and redress harmful opportunism. This idea {{can be traced back}} to the dawn of modern fiduciary law in England and the United States, and it has inspired generations of legal scholars to attempt to explain and justify the duty of loyalty from an economic perspective. Nonetheless, this Article argues that the conventional account of fiduciary loyalty should be abandoned because it does not adequately explain or justify fiduciary law’s core features. The normative foundations of fiduciary loyalty come into sharper focus when viewed through the lens of republican legal theory. Consistent with the republican tradition, the fiduciary duty of loyalty serves primarily to ensure that a fiduciary’s entrusted power does not compromise liberty by exposing her principal and beneficiaries to domination. The republican theory has significant advantages over previous theories of fiduciary law because it better explains and justifies the law’s traditional features, including the uncompromising requirements of fiduciary loyalty and the customary remedies of rescission, constructive trust, and disgorgement. Significantly, the republican theory arrives at a moment when American fiduciary law stands at a crossroads. In recent years, some politicians, judges, and legal scholars have worked to dismantle two central pillars of fiduciary loyalty: the categorical prohibition against unauthorized conflicts of interest and conflicts of duty (the no-conflict rule), and the requirement that fiduciaries relinquish unauthorized profits (the <b>no-profit</b> <b>rule).</b> The republican theory explains why these efforts to scale back the duty of loyalty should be resisted in the interest of safeguarding liberty...|$|E
40|$|The Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal has {{utilised}} a ‘scope of business’ inquiry {{to delineate}} {{the boundaries of}} the no-conflict rule for the company director. Such an inquiry is directed at discerning the realistic ability of the company to exploit any particular business opportunity and a strict capacity approach is eschewed, at least where the no-conflict rule is concerned. The decision is premised on a bifurcation between the no-conflict and <b>no-profit</b> <b>rules,</b> suggesting that the tests to determine breach of these fiduciary rules are not necessarily the same, thus permitting a more nuanced consideration of directorial breaches...|$|R
40|$|This article {{considers}} {{the current state}} of the fiduciary duty to avoid conflicts of interest as it applies to non-executive directors (NEDs) of UK companies, particularly in the context of corporate opportunities discovered by them in an outside capacity. The article charts the current law through the no-conflict and <b>no-profit</b> <b>rules</b> developed by the common law, and argues that the Companies Act 2006 leaves significant real-world uncertainties for the modern non-executive with outside business interests. Empirical data gathered from the largest listed companies in the UK are used to show that companies do attempt to legislate for this problem, but in a way that is only partially satisfactory. Finally, the article argues that the courts can and should develop the law in a way that accords with these real-world contractual solutions and the commercial expectations of NEDs, and suggests how the courts should approach cases of this type...|$|R
2500|$|The {{landmark}} Australian decision ASIC v Citigroup {{noted that}} the [...] "informed consent" [...] {{on behalf of the}} beneficiary to breaches of either the <b>no-profit</b> and no-conflict <b>rule</b> will allow the fiduciary to get around these rules. Furthermore, it highlighted that a contract may include a clause that allows individuals to avoid all fiduciary obligations within the course of dealings, and thereby continue to make a personal profit or deal with other parties- tasks that may otherwise have been in conflict with what would have been a fiduciary duty {{had it not been for}} this clause. In the Australian case of Farah Constructions Pty Ltd v Say-Dee Pty Ltd, however, Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Callinan, Heydon and Crennan JJ observed that the sufficiency of disclosure may depend on the sophistication and intelligence of the persons to whom the disclosure must be made.|$|R
