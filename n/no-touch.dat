500|$|Nystrom {{chose to}} leave Calgary {{as a free}} agent, signing a three-year, $4.2 million {{contract}} with the Minnesota Wild on July 1, 2010. He scored four goals and eight assists {{in his first season}} with the Wild, a season which Nystrom admitted was not good, and [...] "snowballed negatively" [...] for him. The 2011–12 season posed early challenges for Nystrom. [...] In a pre-season game against the Edmonton Oilers, his attempt to avoid an icing call resulted in his stick getting caught up in the skates of Edmonton's Taylor Fedun, sending the latter player crashing into the boards at high speed. [...] Fedun suffered a broken leg and the play renewed calls for the NHL to move to <b>no-touch</b> icing to avoid similar incidents in the future. [...] He was waived by Minnesota prior to the season's start, but went unclaimed by any other team and was demoted to the AHL's Houston Aeros, with whom he appeared in one game.|$|E
40|$|Effects {{of light}} touch on body sway have usually been {{investigated}} with {{some form of}} constant contact. Only two studies investigated transient sway dynamics following the addition or withdrawal of light touch. This study adopted a paradigm of intermittent touch and assessed body sway during as well as following short periods of touch of varying durations to investigate whether effects and after-effects of touch differ {{as a function of}} touch duration. In a modified heel-to-toe posture, 15 blindfolded participants alternated their index finger position between <b>no-touching</b> and touching on a strain gauge in response to low- and high-pitched auditory cues. Five trials of 46 s duration were segmented into 11 sections: a 6 -s <b>no-touching</b> period was followed by five pseudo-randomly ordered touching periods of 0. 5 -, 1 -, 1. 5 -, 2 -, and 5 -s duration, each of which was followed by another 6 -s <b>no-touching</b> interval. Consistent with previous research, compared to <b>no-touching</b> intervals sway was reduced during touch periods with touch durations greater than 2 s. Progressive reductions in sway were evident after touch onset. After touch withdrawal in the 2 -s touch condition, postural sway increased and returned to baseline level nearly immediately. Interestingly, in the 5 -s touch condition, reductions in sway persisted even after touch withdrawal in the medio-lateral and antero-posterior plane for around 2. 5 s and 5. 5 s, respectively. Our intermittent touch paradigm resulted in duration-dependent touch effects and after-effects; the latter is a novel finding and may result from a more persistent postural set involved in proactive sway control...|$|R

50|$|By {{the early}} 1990s, all the top dance teams were {{performing}} dances in the theatrical, rather than ballroom, style. Deciding {{to attempt to}} restrain theatricality, the International Skating Union pushed ice dancing to return to its ballroom roots by adding more restrictions on music and dance holds. In June 1993, the ISU decreed that free dance music must have a rhythmic beat and a melody and be arranged and orchestrated for use on the dance floor. Amid complaints that ice dance had become too boring, these restrictions were removed and replaced with requirements that dancers include specified technical elements in the original dance and free dance. Step sequences in face-to-face holds, <b>no-touching</b> step sequences, dance lifts, dance spins, and twizzles became required elements.|$|R

As a result of the accusation, Logan kissed Rogue, but she broke it off before it caused any major damage. Gambit then began to realize what he was saying, questioning his romantic love for Rogue, but soon after began to suffer from hallucinations that he was fighting Mister Sinister.

At its opening in the 1930s, the White Horse was not explicitly a gay bar but rather a [...] "gay-friendly bar a <b>no-touching</b> policy" [...] and Chinese restaurant. Advertisements from the 1940s state that the restaurant offered [...] "exotic Chinese dinners and distinctive American cuisine." [...] It was likely frequented by factory and port workers from nearby industrial centers as well as soldiers and sailors, especially during the Great Depression and World War II.
