5|$|After {{returning}} from overseas in 1921, Cooper {{got a job}} working the <b>night</b> <b>shift</b> at The New York Times. He was commissioned to write articles for Asia magazine. Cooper was able to travel with Ernest Schoedsack on a sea voyage on the Wisdom II. As part of the journey, he traveled to Abyssinia, or the Ethiopian Empire, where he met their prince regent, Ras Tefari, later known as Emperor Haile Selassie I. The ship left Abyssinia in February 1923. On their way home, the crew narrowly missed being attacked by pirates, and the ship was burned down. His three-part series for Asia was published in 1923.|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} {{the effects of a}} compressed working week with high cognitive and emotional work demands within the population of Dutch Helicopter Emergency Medical Service (HEMS) pilots. Work stressors were measured and levels of well-being were examined before, during and after a series of day and <b>night</b> <b>shifts.</b> Results revealed that (i) the start of a series of day shifts was more taxing for wellbeing than the start of a series of <b>night</b> <b>shifts,</b> (ii) there were no differences in the decrease in well-being during day and <b>night</b> <b>shifts,</b> (iii) distress during shifts was more strongly related to a decrease in wellbeing during night than during day shifts and (iv) it took HEMS pilots more time to recover from a series of <b>night</b> <b>shifts</b> than from a series of day shifts. It is concluded that HEMS pilots should not start earlier during day shifts, nor have longer series of <b>night</b> <b>shifts...</b>|$|R
30|$|Another {{requirement}} {{is that each}} employee should get six work shifts per week or else the employee’s case is considered separately. In addition, assignment of employees to different shifts in the week should be as fair as possible. For instance, if an employee is assigned to six <b>night</b> <b>shifts</b> out of the seven <b>night</b> <b>shifts</b> in a week, but the remaining employees are assigned one or no night shifts,there is clearly a lack of fairness in the assignment, given that employees may less prefer <b>night</b> <b>shifts.</b>|$|R

5|$|On the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War in 1939, the animal keepers were issued with rifles to deal with any dangerous animals who might escape if the gardens were bombed. A <b>night</b> <b>shift</b> was introduced to watch over the animals 24hours a day. A list of dangerous animals that was drawn up included 13lions, 6tigers, 2leopards, 1cheetah, 2tigons, 3other small cats and several bears. Although the zoo's administrators succeeded in convincing the local authorities that any danger from the animals was minimal, primarily because the perimeter walls were so high, the keepers were replaced in their sharp-shooting role by soldiers who patrolled the grounds armed with tommy guns.|$|E

5|$|A pair {{will work}} {{together}} to help build the nest, incubate the eggs and raise their altricial young. However, in most species the male {{does most of the}} nest excavation and takes the <b>night</b> <b>shift</b> while incubating the eggs. A clutch will usually consist of two to five round white eggs. Since these birds are cavity nesters, their eggs {{do not need to be}} camouflaged and the white color helps the parents to see them in dim light. The eggs are incubated for about 11–14 days before they hatch. It then takes about 18–30 days before the chicks are fully fledged and ready to leave the nest. In most species, soon after this the young are left to fend for themselves, exceptions being the various social species, and the Hispaniolan woodpecker, where adults continue to feed their young for several months. In general, cavity nesting is a successful strategy and a higher proportion of young are reared than is the case with birds that nest in the open. In Africa, several species of honeyguide are brood parasites of woodpeckers.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To prospectively {{study the}} {{association}} of <b>night</b> and <b>shift</b> work with weight change and lifestyle behaviors. Methods: Workers participating in the Netherlands Working Conditions Cohort Study (2008 and 2009) (N = 5951) reported <b>night</b> and <b>shift</b> work, weight and height. Groups included stable <b>night</b> or <b>shift</b> work, from day work to <b>night</b> or <b>shift</b> work, from <b>night</b> or <b>shift</b> work to day work, and no <b>night</b> or <b>shift</b> work in 2008 and 2009. Regression analyses were used to study association changes in <b>night</b> and <b>shift</b> work with weight change and changes in lifestyle behaviors. Results: A larger weight change was seen in normal-weight workers changing from day to shift work ([beta] = 0. 93 %; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 01 to 1. 85) compared with stable no shift workers. No further associations of <b>night</b> and <b>shift</b> work with weight change were observed, neither in normal-weight, overweight, and obese workers. Conclusions: Despite the fact that starting <b>night</b> or <b>shift</b> work is associated with some unhealthy lifestyle habits, {{this study did not}} confirm a positive association of <b>night</b> and <b>shift</b> work with weight change over 1 year, except for normal-weight workers moving from day to shift work.

5|$|The episode {{begins with}} an unknown person {{lighting}} a candle in the homicide squadroom. One by one, the detectives arrive for the <b>night</b> <b>shift</b> on an unusually hot September evening. A furious Gee (Yaphet Kotto) calls maintenance {{to complain about the}} non-working air conditioner and learns it has been shut off for the night. Felton (Daniel Baldwin) and Lewis (Clark Johnson) try to find out who secretly lights the candle every night; they blow it out a number of times, but it always ends up lit again without anyone noticing. Munch (Richard Belzer) loudly complains about his ex-girlfriend breaking up with him. While the other detectives sweat and complain about the heat, a calm and comfortable Pembleton (Andre Braugher) wears a tie and drinks hot tea without sweating. Bayliss (Kyle Secor), who acts uncooperative with his partner Pembleton, says he has found the fingerprints of a man named James Hill who he believes is the murderer in the Adena Watson case.

40|$|Objective: Junior {{physicians}} {{have been shown}} to exhibit exceptionally high burnout levels. With this study, we aimed to investigate the relationship between work experience, medical career stage, work load, on-call stress, and burnout-level in a population of university physicians. Methods: The influence of demographic and professional characteristics on work load and burnout levels from the Maslach Burnout Inventory were determined amongst 702 of 1797 (response rate 39. 1 %) university-based clinicians using generalized linear estimation models. Results: MBI burnout levels were comparable to other studies on hospital-based physicians with 51. 4 % meeting cut-off criteria for pronounced levels of emotional exhaustion and 53. 8 % for depersonalization. With increasing experience, emotional exhaustion (P <. 001) and depersonalization (P =. 002) decreased. Long working hours and regular <b>night</b> <b>shifts</b> posed additional independent risk factors. 39. 6 % of physicians met the cut-off value for a high grade of depersonalization if working days, and 61. 4 % if providing regular <b>night</b> <b>shifts.</b> Compared to 29. 6 % of senior physicians, 84. 6 % of residents provided regular <b>night</b> <b>shifts</b> (P <. 001), and residents reported longer weekly hours if their schedule required <b>night</b> <b>shifts</b> (P =. 005). Conclusion: Having little work experience and high workloads with a disadvantageous combination of <b>night</b> <b>shifts</b> and long working hours, physicians in early medical career presented an especially high burnout risk. Early intervention in case of high workload and on-call stress may have a particular preventive benefit in this group...|$|R
