25|$|On April 9, 1984, the Brisco {{brothers}} {{sold their}} shares in GCW, including their prime time slot on the TBS cable television network, to Vince McMahon. However, GCW's core audience {{was not interested}} in the WWF's gimmick-based approach, preferring a more athletic style. As a result, when GCW's television viewers tuned into TBS on July 14, 1984 and saw WWF programming instead, they were outraged and sent complaints to the network demanding the return of GCW. This day has since gone down in wrestling lore as Black Saturday. Adding fuel to the fire was the fact that, despite originally promising to produce original programming for the TBS time slot, McMahon chose instead to provide only a clip show for TBS featuring highlights from other WWF programming, a move which angered <b>network</b> <b>head</b> Ted Turner and was a major factor in his decision to discontinue showing the WWF on his network. Luckily for Turner, Ole Anderson had refused to sell his shares in GCW to the WWF, and he teamed with fellow holdout shareholders Fred Ward and Ralph Freed to create Championship Wrestling from Georgia. Turner quickly secured a television deal with the new promotion, as well as with Bill Watts' Mid-South Wrestling.|$|E

As the Nine Network was {{interested}} in creating local and world-class television, they decided to invest in a drama series that told the story of the Melbourne gangland killings. Jo Horsburgh, Nine <b>Network</b> <b>Head</b> of Drama, stated that the network was [...] "100 percent committed to bringing Underbelly to the small screen". Des Monaghan, executive producer for Screentime, called the series [...] "one of the most exciting and challenging drama projects ever shot in [...] ". The script took 12months to write, beginning in June 2006, with the main writers, Greg Haddrick, Peter Gawler and Felicity Packard putting together an entire episode themselves before their scripts were edited. Haddrick, Screentime's Head of Drama, felt that the challenge for the writing team was to [...] "capture the essential truth of these extraordinary events in a compelling and coherent manner".|$|E

[...] In , a billboard featuring the hot tub kiss is a major plot point in the film and is the main reason why the <b>Network</b> <b>Head</b> is hunting the housemates down in order to kill them in the movie, due to the billboard being the cause of his wife and daughter's death.|$|E

The <b>Network</b> <b>Head</b> then tells him he wants the housemates dead because, one day, as his wife was driving his daughter to school, they passed a billboard advertising Drawn Together that featured Foxxy and Clara's hot tub kiss (from the episode Hot Tub). This terrifies the daughter, thinking that Foxxy is eating Clara's face. As the mother tries to calm down the daughter, they drive off a cliff into a vat of alligators (in a vat of sulfuric acid), killing them. The Jew Producer states that, despite this revelation, he will not help the <b>Network</b> <b>Head</b> with his mission, but the <b>Network</b> <b>Head</b> reveals that he has kidnapped the Jew Producer's son as a threat. The Jew Producer reluctantly agrees to help, and he and I.S.R.A.E.L. take off {{in pursuit of the}} housemates once again. Clara, Hero, Molly (a corpse Hero believes to be his girlfriend), Xandir, and Ling-Ling arrive at Clara's kingdom, expecting to find refuge. However, nobody there seems to recognize Clara. She encounters the king of the land, who is not her father, and even more shockingly, she sees a woman who appears to be the [...] "real" [...] princess. The guards end up dismembering and eventually killing Clara, but the other three manage to escape.|$|E
