5|$|The main {{conservation}} {{threat to}} the plain maskray is incidental capture by commercial bottom trawl fisheries. In the present day, this is mostly caused by Australia's <b>Northern</b> <b>Prawn</b> Fishery, which operates throughout its range. Although this species is discarded when caught, it is more delicate-bodied than other maskrays and is thus unlikely to survive encounters with trawling gear. Historically, this species {{may also have been}} negatively affected by Japanese, Chinese, and Taiwanese trawlers that fished intensively off northern Australia from 1959 to 1990. These factors, coupled with the plain maskray's limited distribution and low reproductive rate, have resulted in its being assessed as Near Threatened by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).|$|E
5|$|The {{peppered}} maskray lacks {{economic value}} and is discarded by fisheries. It is often caught incidentally in bottom trawls, {{and due to}} its small size does not benefit from Turtle Exclusion Devices. In particular, this species accounts for approximately 4.5% of the total catch of the <b>Northern</b> <b>Prawn</b> Fishery (NPF) in the Gulf of Carpentaria. Over half of the rays caught by the NPF, including almost all the males, are fatally crushed within the trawl. Despite this mortality, the NPF is not believed to have negatively affected the local population because its operational area {{does not include the}} waters where this species is most abundant. The peppered maskray is also caught frequently in scallop trawls operated by the Queensland East Coast Trawl Fishery. Elsewhere in its range, fishing pressure is relatively light due to external factors such as fuel prices. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed this species under Least Concern, because it remains common and its range includes several Marine Protected Areas.|$|E
5|$|Though {{not highly}} {{dangerous}} to humans, the pink whipray's venomous sting {{makes it difficult}} to handle when it is thrashing in a fishing net. Usually, it must be thrown overboard before the rest of the catch can be sorted. Throughout Indonesia and Malaysia, and probably elsewhere in its range, this species is a regular incidental catch of coastal fisheries using tangle nets, bottom trawls, gillnets, seine nets, {{and to a lesser extent}} longlines. When retained, the meat, skin, and cartilage are utilized. Fishing activity in Southeast Asia is intense and largely unregulated, and this large ray may be more vulnerable to depletion than its smaller relatives because of its slower reproductive rate. The population in the Arafura Sea is thought to have been particularly affected by an Indonesian fishery targeting wedgefishes (Rhynchobatus), and Indonesian fishers are also increasingly operating illegally in Australian waters. Off northern Australia, the pink whipray is caught incidentally by the <b>Northern</b> <b>Prawn</b> Fishery (NPF), but bycatch levels have likely fallen significantly since the use of Turtle Excluder Devices (TEDs) and Bycatch Reduction Devices (BRDs) became compulsory in 2000.|$|E

50|$|The duskyshoulder {{trevally}} is {{of little}} importance to either commercial fisheries or anglers, but is commonly taken as bycatch in other trawl fisheries, especially the <b>northern</b> Australian <b>prawn</b> fishery. It is mostly discarded when taken, rarely sold at market.|$|R

5|$|The {{mangrove}} whipray {{is capable}} of injuring a human with its venomous sting. It is occasionally caught in tangle nets and bottom trawls, {{and to a lesser}} extent on longlines; it is marketed for its meat, skin, and cartilage. Because of its inshore habitat preferences, this naturally uncommon species is highly susceptible to intensive artisanal and commercial fishing occurring across much of its range. In Southeast Asia, immature rays have been particularly affected by local fishing, as well as by habitat degradation from the widespread loss of mangrove forests. Additionally, the numbers of this species in the Arafura Sea have dropped significantly due to an Indonesian gillnet fishery targeting wedgefishes (Rhynchobatus), which involves over 600 vessels and has been increasingly operating illegally in Australian waters. These factors have led to an inferred decline of the Southeast Asian population by over 50%, leading the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) to give it a regional assessment of Endangered. The mangrove whipray is minimally threatened off northern Australia, where it is caught incidentally by the <b>Northern</b> <b>Prawn</b> Fishery (NPF) but only in small numbers following the mandatory adoption of Turtle Exclusion Devices (TEDs). As a result, the IUCN assessment for the Australian population is Least Concern. Globally, the IUCN has listed this species as Vulnerable.|$|E

40|$|Australia’s {{aquaculture}} {{industry is}} predominantly based in rural coastal regions where {{it makes a}} significant contribution to local economies as well as to national food security. Over the past decade changing global economic and trade conditions have resulted in Asia supplying an ever-increasing amount of seafood to Australian consumers. From 2003 to 2007 landings of cheaper imported Asian prawns increased dramatically, seriously impacting the eastern Australian prawn farming industry as graphically illustrated by the collapse of prawn farming in the Northern Rivers region of NSW. In response, the Southern Cross University’s National Marine Science Centre researched the feasibility of farming the finfish mulloway or jewfish (Argyrosomus japonicus) as an opportunity for Australian prawn farmers to diversify their production base. In this context, the purpose of this case study was to assess the effect of imported products on the viability of the <b>northern</b> NSW <b>prawn</b> farming industry by reviewing the output and cost structures of a local prawn farm before (2002 - 2003) and after the influx of competing imports (2006 - 2007). Secondly, the findings of a two year trial of farming mulloway in ponds on a converted prawn farm are critically evaluated, and possible opportunities are identified. Finally, regional policy implications of the case study are examined and current constraints and limitations to the uptake of mulloway farming in northern NSW are identified...|$|R
40|$|Extensive {{surveys of}} various fish landing sites in eastern Indonesia, {{conducted}} between April 2001 and March 2006, recorded {{a total of}} 54 species of batoid rays belonging to 12 families. The Dasyatidae {{was by far the}} most speciose family, comprising half of the recorded species, and was also the most abundant, contributing 89 and 44 % to the total numbers and total estimated biomass of batoids, respectively. The size and sex compositions of 23 species of rays are described and an accurate size at maturity of males, i. e. with 95 % CI, was determined for 13 of these species. The sex ratios were found to be close to parity in the majority of species, however, the landings of the whitespotted guitarfish Rhynchobatus australiae consisted of significantly more females than males, a situation also recorded for this species in the by-catch of the <b>northern</b> Australian <b>prawn</b> fishery. Data on aspects of the reproductive biology of three dasyatid species (Dasyatis cf. kuhlii, Dasyatis zugei and Himantura walga), which form a substantial component of the by-catch of the bottom trawl fisheries in the region, were collected on most sampling occasions. These small rays, i. e. maximum sizes 243 - 379 mm disc width, were found to have no distinct seasonal reproductive cycle and small litter sizes, i. e. less than four embryos. Opportunistic reproductive data, e. g. litter size and embryo sizes, were also collected from various other species. The litter sizes of the rhynchobatid and rhinobatid species examined were found to be larger than those of the gymnurid and dasyatid species examined, i. e. seven to 19 and two to 13 v. one to four, respectively.

5000|$|The one {{traditional}} Norse {{dish with}} {{a claim to}} international popularity is smoked salmon. It is now a major export, and {{could be considered the}} most important Scandinavian contribution to modern international cuisine. Smoked salmon exists traditionally in many varieties, and is often served with scrambled eggs, dill, sandwiches and mustard sauce. Another traditional salmon product is gravlaks, (literally [...] "buried salmon"). Traditionally, gravlaks would be cured for 24 hours in a mix of sugar and salt and herbs (dill). The salmon may then be frozen or kept in a chilled area. Since grav means [...] "buried" [...] it is a common misunderstanding that the salmon is buried into the ground, (similar to how rakfisk is still prepared). This {{was the case in the}} medieval ages because the fermenting process was important, however this is not the case today. Gravlaks is often sold under more sales-friendly names internationally. A more peculiar Norwegian fish dish is Rakfisk, which consists of fermented trout, a culinary relation of Swedish surströmming.Until the 20th century, shellfish was not eaten to any extent. This was partly due to the abundance of fish and the relative high expenditure of time involved in catching shellfish when set against its nutritional value, as well as the fact that such food spoils rather quickly, even in a <b>northern</b> climate. However, <b>prawns,</b> crabs and mussels have become quite popular, especially during summer.

40|$|Summary of {{priority}} issues {{for managing the}} ecological effects of fishing in the <b>Northern</b> <b>Prawn</b> Fishery The ecological risk assessment (ERA) process was designed to assess and rank the ecological effects of fishing in Commonwealth fisheries. The ERA process for the <b>Northern</b> <b>Prawn</b> Fishery (NPF) analysed the effect of commercial fishing, based on the effects on all organisms (protected species, bycatch, byproduct and target species), habitats and ecological communities {{that occur in the}} area of the fishery. The process provided a list of species, habitats and ecological communities that are at risk of ecological damage from the effects of fishing. The ecological effects of fishing in the NPF are largely due to the incidental capture of non-target species (including the capture of protected species). The methods of fishing employed in the NPF were found to have little to no detrimental impact on the physical marine environment. The highest level of ERA assessment conducted on the NPF is a quantitative Level 2. 5 assessment.
