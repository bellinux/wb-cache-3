5|$|Lasarra was {{a female}} protoss {{scientist}} stationed on Kaldir when it was attacked by zerg led by Sarah Kerrigan. The protoss were defeated; Lasarra was captured during the attack on Kaldir {{at the request of}} Abathur, who wanted to experiment on her even though it was known that the protoss could not be infested. Kerrigan agreed to spare Lasarra's life until she found a use for her. During her time onboard Kerrigan's leviathan, Lasarra interacted with Kerrigan a number of times. Kerrigan tried to justify her actions on Kaldir, saying that if the protoss could contact Shakuras, Kerrigan {{would not have been able}} to survive. However, Lasarra is unconvinced, saying that self-preservation is <b>no</b> <b>justification</b> <b>for</b> killing so many innocents. Eventually, Kerrigan admitted she could not and would not justify her actions, stating that both the zerg and protoss were killers. Eventually, as one of the protoss ships was able to break through the zerg blockade, Lasarra was implanted with a special larva and allowed to warp in to that ship. The larva devoured her and then other lifeforms being stored on the ship, evading detection. It eventually transformed into a broodmother, Niadra, which bred a new brood that infested the ship, killing every protoss on board. Kerrigan later showed some regret over Lasarra's death, as she told Izsha that she did not enjoy having to kill her.|$|E

25|$|Other {{opinion polls}} have shown Romanians {{to be more}} {{intolerant}} with regard to homosexuality, including a 2003 poll conducted by Gallup for the Institute for Public Policies. In the poll, 45% of respondents said homosexuals should not be treated the same as others in society; 37% thought homosexuality should be criminalized; and 40% thought homosexuals {{should not be allowed}} to live in Romania. The Soros Foundation also conducted in June 2011 a survey where 80% of the respondents feel that there is <b>no</b> <b>justification</b> <b>for</b> the acceptance of homosexuality even though it has not been illegal since 2001.|$|E
25|$|Starting {{from the}} {{argument}} that a historical universal scientific method does not exist, Feyerabend argues that science does not deserve its privileged status in western society. Since scientific points of view do not arise from using a universal method which guarantees high quality conclusions, he thought that there is <b>no</b> <b>justification</b> <b>for</b> valuing scientific claims over claims by other ideologies like religions. Feyerabend also argued that scientific accomplishments such as the moon landings are no compelling reason to give science a special status. In his opinion, it is not fair to use scientific assumptions about which problems are worth solving in order to judge the merit of other ideologies. Additionally, success by scientists has traditionally involved non-scientific elements, such as inspiration from mythical or religious sources.|$|E
25|$|Discussing ethical issues, Ruse {{distinguishes between}} {{involuntary}} inclination and willful behavior, arguing that while a homosexual orientation is morally blameless, {{this is not}} necessarily true of homosexual behavior. Ruse finds <b>no</b> <b>justification</b> <b>for</b> homosexual or heterosexual promiscuity, but nevertheless maintains on utilitarian grounds that people should be free to be promiscuous. He criticizes ethical arguments that appeal to scientific claims about the naturalness or unnaturalness of homosexuality, for example the views of the Greek philosopher Plato, according to whom homosexual behavior did not occur in animals. Ruse finds this claim to be mistaken, and dismisses the idea that homosexuality is unnatural. Ruse argues that both neo-Kantian and utilitarian theories of the just state must affirm the moral worth of homosexual relationships and support equal rights for homosexuals and heterosexuals.|$|E

25|$|There is no general {{right to}} privacy in English law. Attempts to {{establish}} such a right in Kaye v Robertson and Wainwright v Home Office were rejected {{on the basis that}} it could only be done by Parliament. The creation of a tort of infringement of privacy had been recommended by Sir David Calcutt in his Review of Press Self-Regulation published in 1993, but no action was taken. Instead, a patchwork of different torts combine to protect certain aspects of privacy, such as breach of confidence and misuse of private information. In Campbell v Mirror Group Newspapers Ltd, the House of Lords confirmed that a person will be subject to a duty of confidence if they receive information in circumstances where there is a reasonable expectation of privacy and where there is <b>no</b> <b>justification</b> <b>for</b> interference with that {{right to privacy}}. This was followed by Douglas v Hello! Ltd where a magazine was successfully sued for publishing unauthorised photographs of a celebrity wedding.|$|E
25|$|In 1991 the Transitional Government of Ethiopia (TGE) {{restructured}} {{the country}} into ethnically-based Regions, and Welayta became the centre of Region 9. Later, Welayta {{was included in the}} Southern Nations, Nationalities, and People's Region (SNNPR, consisting of the former regions 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11) as part of the Semien Omo Zone. The regional government claimed that the Welayta were so closely related to the other Omotic-speaking peoples of that zone that there was <b>no</b> <b>justification</b> <b>for</b> a separate Welayta zone. Welayta leaders, however, stressed that their people had a distinct language and culture and demanded a zone for themselves. In 1998, the regional government attempted to introduce an artificially constructed language, based on the various local North Omotic languages and dialects, as the new language of education and administration for Semien Omo Zone. This triggered violent protests by Welayta students, teachers and civil servants, which led to the withdrawal of the new language. In November 2000, the Welayta Zone was established.|$|E
25|$|The {{argument}} of centuries of social injustice through the caste system (see below, {{in the next}} Section) is not accepted by those who {{point out that the}} caste system, although differently known and practised in different societies, is a tribal hangover from the past, which had some merit in that it ensured, or 'reserved', specified jobs to be done castes which had a preference to do so. They have no sanction in the Vedas (the Upanishads Section) in which only speak of four broad 'Varnas' or divisions according to the temperament of people and of inter-Varna switch, or mobility, based on individual efforts when he/she happens to be borne to a man of a particular Varna. This process, called 'Samskara' is, approximately, conscious individual refinement. In a true sense, therefore, the talk of deliberate subjugation of or discrimination of upper castes against lower castes has no basis, even though distortions of the principle has happened historically, without sanction of the Vedas. Hence reservation, the anti-reservationists seem to say, is just a mask for demanding reservations under the cloak of casteism over-riding merit and blissfully ignoring that Vedas do not sanction this. At any rate, after several decades of Varna reservation for the lowest social strata comprising certain classes constitutionally enshrined as 'scheduled castes' and 'scheduled tribes', and otherwise open competition to all people irrespective of any criteria other than merit and aptitude, there is <b>no</b> <b>justification</b> <b>for</b> the political parties to demand extend reservation of educational admission and job opportunities to more classes ('other backward castes'). It is pointed out that more opportunities in keeping with the uncontrolled growth in population, in all spheres of economic activity as well as education, will be the only right answer and not reservation. However, since proportional representation is the basis of modern democracy as it is practised, these anti-reservationists point out, this, in India, has led to its most abominable abuse, resulting in a democracy which is of and by Indians but against their own interests, since a disunited country oblivious of equality of opportunity because of prohibitive reservation levels, can never compete successfully in the global context, nor achieve much in its own management of internal economy.(Already due to politicisation of trade unions, India's labour productivity remains among the lowest in the world, as a UK study had pointed out a few years ago.) The abuse of political power to demand reservation for all other than the so-called 'forward ' communities is, according to the contesters, just a vote bank politics to woo the majority represented by the beneficiary communities to cast their votes in their favour. Since, however, there are no opponents among political parties to educational and job reservations, in view of their universal vote bank politics, such reservation in themselves cannot favour any particular parties at the elections.|$|E

500|$|The {{justification}} for the first premise is the most controversial. Both Putnam and Quine invoke naturalism to justify the exclusion of all non-scientific entities, and hence to defend the [...] "only" [...] part of [...] "all and only". The assertion that [...] "all" [...] entities postulated in scientific theories, including numbers, should be accepted as real is justified by confirmation holism. Since theories are not confirmed in a piecemeal fashion, but as a whole, there is <b>no</b> <b>justification</b> <b>for</b> excluding any of the entities referred to in well-confirmed theories. This puts the nominalist who wishes to exclude the existence of sets and non-Euclidean geometry, but to include the existence of quarks and other undetectable entities of physics, for example, in a difficult position.|$|E

500|$|The {{issue was}} {{revisited}} {{in the subsequent}} case of R. (on the application of Cart) v. Upper Tribunal (2011). The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom disapproved of certain pronouncements by the lower courts which appeared to signal {{a return to the}} pre-Anisminic position. According to Lord Dyson, this was not justified as [...] "the importance of Anisminic is that it showed that a material error of law renders a decision a 'nullity' so that the decision is in principle judicially reviewable". He went on to state that [...] "as a matter of principle, there is <b>no</b> <b>justification</b> <b>for</b> drawing the line at jurisdictional error". In his opinion, any restrictions on judicial review require justification and, prima facie, such review should be available to challenge the legality of decisions of public bodies.|$|E
500|$|Thomas Paine, {{one of the}} Founding Fathers of the United States, {{said that}} the right to vote is {{critical}} in the protection of individual freedoms.

Paine's view was that there is <b>no</b> <b>justification</b> <b>for</b> one part of a community to deny another its right to vote on any basis, whether class, race, religion or political creed. His view survives in various international instruments such as Article 21(1) of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.|$|E

500|$|Ferrier met Albert Wilson in 1933, {{probably}} through dancing, {{which they}} both loved. When she {{announced that they}} were to marry, her family and friends had strong reservations, on the grounds that she was young and inexperienced, and that she and Wilson shared few serious interests. Nevertheless, the marriage took place on 19 November 1935. Shortly afterwards the couple moved to Silloth, a small port town in Cumberland, where Wilson had been appointed as manager of his bank's branch. The marriage was not successful; the honeymoon had revealed problems of physical incompatibility, and the union remained unconsummated. In a tribute article written for the 50th anniversary of Ferrier's death, the journalist Rupert Christiansen wrote of Ferrier's sexuality that [...] "there is absolutely <b>no</b> <b>justification</b> <b>for</b> the idea that she was a lesbian, but she may have been sexually frigid". Outward appearances were maintained for a few years, until Wilson's departure for military service in 1940 effectively ended the marriage. The couple divorced in 1947, though they remained on good terms. Wilson subsequently married a friend of Ferrier's, Wyn Hetherington; he died in 1969.|$|E
