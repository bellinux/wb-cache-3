The massive zone is overlain by a matrix ore zone composed of the above sulfide assemblage and coarse jackstraw textured bladed olivine, now retrogressed to black serpentinite.

50|$|Unlike emerald which {{owes its}} green {{color to the}} {{presence}} of chromium, the color of chrysoprase is due to trace amounts of nickel compounds in the form of very small inclusions. The nickel reportedly occurs as different silicates, like kerolite or pimelite (not NiO mineral, bunsenite, as was reported before). Chrysoprase results from the deep weathering or lateritization of <b>nickeliferous</b> serpentinites or other ultramafic ophiolite rocks. In the Australian deposits, chrysoprase occurs as veins and nodules with brown goethite and other iron oxides in the magnesite-rich saprolite below an iron and silica cap.|$|E

5000|$|Pentlandite is {{the most}} common {{terrestrial}} nickel sulfide. It typically forms during cooling of a sulfide melt. These sulfide melts, in turn, are typically formed during the evolution of a silicate melt. Because Ni is a chalcophile-like element, it has preference for (i.e. it [...] "partitions into") sulfide phases. In sulfide undersaturated melts, Ni substitutes for other transition metals within ferromagnesian minerals, the most usual being olivine, although <b>nickeliferous</b> varieties of amphibole, biotite, pyroxene and spinel are known. Ni substitutes most readily for Fe2+ and Co2+ because or their similarity in size and charge.|$|E
50|$|The nickel {{resources}} of the region are {{in the form of}} <b>nickeliferous</b> laterites, soils of unique geochemistry derived from the tropical weathering of parent serpentinized ultramafites. Two types of nickel ore are of commercial importance, limonite (oxide) ore and saprolite (nickel silicate) ore. Nickel content is higher in the saprolite zone although cobalt is an important by-product of the limonite horizon. Potential is high in Surigao del Norte and northern Surigao del Sur particularly in Dinagat and Nonoc group of islands as well as in Claver - Carrascal area, Surigao mainland. Potential, but of lower tonnage occur in the western highlands of Agusan del Norte particularly from Jabonga to Tubay area.|$|E

40|$|From Chapter 1 : It {{has been}} a long {{standing}} belief that many nickel sulphide ores are derivatives of magmatic processes in ultramafic and mafic rocks, and that they segregate from these magmas as immiscible sulphide droplets which are then concentrated into an orebody by gravitational settling either during intrusion or extrusion, or during the early stages of crystallization of the magma (Naldrett, 1981). Some geologists however, have suggested alternative mechanisms to explain the concentration of <b>nickeliferous</b> sulphides in the mafic and ultramafic hosts. These include hydrothermal replacement (Fleet, 1977), exhalative volcanic processes (Lusk, 1976), or major metamorphic upgrading of low grade, initially magmatic deposits (Barrett et al., 1977). It is not {{the purpose of this study}} to verify or disprove these hypotheses, but in so far as the initial concentration of sulphides in most deposits is concerned, these effects are relatively unimportant (Naldrett, 1981). The nickel sulphide ores associated with these mafic and ultramafic host rocks, invariably consist of <b>nickeliferous</b> pyrrhotite as the dominant phase, together with lesser, but variable, amounts of magnetite, pentlandite, chalcopyrite, cubanite, and platinum group elements (Reynolds, 1982) ...|$|E
40|$|There is {{considerable}} {{interest in the}} development of new processes to extract the nickel from the oxidic <b>nickeliferous</b> laterite deposits, as the global nickel sulphide resources are rapidly becoming more difficult to access. In comparison to sulphide ores, where the nickel-containing mineral can be readily concentrated by flotation, nickel laterites are not amenable to significant upgrading, due to their complex mineralogy. In this paper, firstly, a brief overview of the conventional techniques used to process the <b>nickeliferous</b> limonitic laterites is given, as well as a review of current research in the area. Secondly, a thermodynamic model is developed to simulate the roasting process and to aid in the selection of process parameters to maximize the nickel recovery and grade and also to minimize the magnetite content of the concentrate. Thirdly, a two-stage process involving reduction roasting and thermal growth in either a tube furnace or a rotary kiln furnace, followed by magnetic separation, was investigated. Thermogravimetric, differential thermal and mineral liberation analyses techniques were utilized to further understand the process. Finally, the nickel grades and recovery results were compared to those available in the literature...|$|E
40|$|A {{study of}} cobalt {{mineralization}} present in weathered ultramafic rocks from New Caledonia revealed the follow-ing minerals: heterogenite (2 H and 3 R polytypes), asbo-lan (with cobalt and nickel), lithiophorite, intermediare phases between asbolan and lithiophorite, cryptomelane, ramsdellite and todorokite; only lithiophorite and cryptome-lane {{had previously been}} characterized in New Caledonia. Cryptomelane, ramsdellite and todorokite contain only traces of cobalt. The other minerals, the main cobalt bearers, occur not only as cryptocrystalline aggregates but also as crystals or fibers up to several hundred pm long. They form concretions, but more often occur as pseudo-morphs after silicates and plant roots, which are habits not previously documented for these minerals. Microprobe ana-lyses show that (l) the heterogenite is much more nickelifer-ous (up to 7. 5 t/ 0 NiO) and the lithiophorite, more cobal-tiferous (up to I 1. 5 q 0 Co 2 O 3), than those found elsewhere;(2) the asbolan shows more variable compositions than those described elsewhere, rangrng from purely cobaltifer-ous to purely <b>nickeliferous</b> end-members; and (3) new phases exist with compositions between those of asbolan and lithiophorite.

40|$|<b>Nickeliferous</b> pyrrhotites {{are found}} {{concentrated}} in various grade in the Oshirabetsu gabbro mass which occupies the southeastern piedmont of the Hidaka mountains, Central Axial Zone of Hokkaido. One {{of the most}} characteristic features is that the pyrrhotite is generally accompanied by graphite. The Oshirabetsu gabbro, host rock of the preceding nickel sulfide ores can be classified into several rock facies: a) olivine gabbro, b) norite, c) hornblende gabbro, d) diorite. The <b>nickeliferous</b> pyrrhotite ores {{are closely related to}} the former three rock facies. On the other hand, the nickel sulfide ore is classified into four types: 1) fine-disseminated, 2) coarse-disseminated, 3) semi-massive, 4) massive. The latter two types are structurally controled by fracture or shear zones where abundant quartz, chlorite are generally present and scant garnet and tourmaline are rarely associated. Pyrrhotites and pentlandites from the above-classified sulfide ores were chemically as well as mineralogically investigated, and the following interesting results have been obtained: Almost all pyrrhotite belongs to hexagonal and peak type thermomagnetically. From the microscopic mode of occurrence, the pyrrhotite was classified into lamella type, granular type and spindle type. The value of (1 +x) in chemical formula, FeS 1 +x of Oshirabetsu pyrrhotite {{has been shown to be}} 1. 09 in average, ranging from 1. 04 to 1. 14. Nickel contents in Oshirabetsu pyrrhotite range from 0. 02 to 1. 19, and it has been found that pentlandite is apt to appear in the pyrrhotite which contains around 1 % Ni. On the other hand, Co contents in pentlandite are rather abundant (9. 99 - 12. 31) in semi-massive sulfide ores.
