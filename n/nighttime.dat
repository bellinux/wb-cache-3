5|$|By 1964, the station's {{power had}} {{increased}} to 1,000 watts during the day, while the <b>nighttime</b> power remained at 250 watts. On June 1, 1973, WKEY {{was sold to}} WKEY, Inc., headed by E.H. Barr, for an undisclosed amount. WKEY increased its <b>nighttime</b> power in 1987 to 1,000 watts, matching its daytime power.|$|E
5|$|<b>Nighttime</b> levels feature slower-paced, action-oriented levels, {{in which}} Sonic {{transforms}} into the Werehog, a beast form that has great strength and stretchable arms. Gameplay here sees the player {{use a variety}} of melee and combo attacks to defeat large numbers of enemies, collect items, and move items around to advance through the level, and use his stretchable arms to cling to distant objects; simple puzzle elements are also featured. Collecting rings in these levels replenishes the Werehog's health, while a special move, Unleashed Mode, allows the Werehog to channel his energy into increasing the power of his attacks for a short time. <b>Nighttime</b> levels are adjusted in the Wii version to allow greater use of the Wii Remote, such that players may control the arms of the Werehog by using the Wii Remote and Nunchuk in order to grab onto objects and proceed in the levels. The Wii version of the game also expands upon the ratio of <b>nighttime</b> levels to daytime, with more than three times as many <b>nighttime</b> levels (twenty-five in all). After <b>nighttime</b> levels are completed, Dark Gaia Points are gained, allowing access to bonus moves.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, {{the entire}} street was {{lit up with}} 300,000 lights for the <b>nighttime</b> show Starlight Spectacular, {{featuring}} animated effects projected on to Wonder Mountain. Overlooking the front gate is the Maple Room, a small, higher-end events facility.|$|E
5|$|World of Color at Disney California Adventure {{is a large}} <b>nighttime</b> {{water and}} light show. Some of the scenes {{projected}} on the water screens feature animation from the Toy Story films.|$|E
5|$|A Bug's Land is {{a section}} of Disney California Adventure that is {{inspired}} by A Bug's Life. One of the main attractions is the 3D show It's Tough to Be a Bug! which is also in Disney's Animal Kingdom. The Disney California Adventure <b>nighttime</b> show World of Color features a segment that includes Heimlich, the caterpillar from the film.|$|E
5|$|Adelaide has a Mediterranean climate with St Kilda being {{slightly}} hotter and drier {{than the}} Adelaide average. Summer daytime temperatures {{can be expected}} to exceed 40°C on 4days of the year. Conversely, <b>nighttime</b> temperatures in winter are expected to drop below 0°C on 1 day, although generally the season is mild with moderate rainfall.|$|E
5|$|Although {{generally}} {{quiet and}} non-vocal, giraffes {{have been heard}} to communicate using various sounds. During courtship, males emit loud coughs. Females call their young by bellowing. Calves will emit snorts, bleats, mooing and mewing sounds. Giraffes also snore, hiss, moan, grunt and make flute-like sounds, and possibly communicate over long distances using infrasound—though this is disputed. During <b>nighttime,</b> giraffes appear to hum to each other above the infrasound range for purposes which are unclear.|$|E
5|$|Domitian himself {{supported}} the travel of competitors from {{all corners of}} the Empire to Rome and distributed the prizes. Innovations were also introduced into the regular gladiatorial games such as naval contests, <b>nighttime</b> battles, and female and dwarf gladiator fights. Lastly, he added two new factions to the chariot races, Gold and Purple, to race against the existing White, Red, Green and Blue factions.|$|E
5|$|Harry Woolman {{worked on}} the special effects along with Baker, and Willy Curtis worked as the film's cinematographer. Some scenes {{included}} photography errors, including one in which light shines through a kitchen window from outside {{even though it is}} supposed to be <b>nighttime.</b> Michel Levesque provided art direction, and the musical score was composed by London Philharmonic Orchestra conductor Arlon Ober.|$|E
5|$|Public {{severe weather}} outlooks (PWO) are issued when a {{significant}} or widespread outbreak is expected, especially for tornadoes. From November to March, {{it can also}} be issued for any threat of significant tornadoes in the <b>nighttime</b> hours, noting the lower awareness and greater danger of tornadoes at that time of year.|$|E
5|$|Tea {{meetings}} are celebrations held in society lodges or school halls, and feature both solo and group performance, theatrical rhetoric and oratory, and other activities. After declining following World War I, tea meetings {{have recently been}} revived and have regained their widespread popularity. They are held at <b>nighttime,</b> beginning at 9:00 pm and continuing until midnight, {{when there is a}} two-hour break for food and drink before the tea meeting is resumed.|$|E
5|$|Temperatures on {{the surface}} have been {{estimated}} to lie between about −20°C with the Sun overhead, dropping to about −190°C at the winter pole. Typical daytime and <b>nighttime</b> temperatures are −60°C and −130°C respectively. This estimate is for 6 May 1996, very close to perihelion, although details vary somewhat with the seasons.|$|E
5|$|The fragrance's commercial, {{directed}} by director Jake Nava and released in December 2009, spawned controversy for its sexually explicit imagery, {{and was only}} allowed <b>nighttime</b> broadcast in the United Kingdom. Macy's sold US$3 million worth of Heat between early February and early March 2010. It received mixed reviews from critics, and it was nominated at several fragrance award ceremonies.|$|E
5|$|The high-mass air well design {{attempts}} to cool a large mass of masonry with cool <b>nighttime</b> air entering the structure due to breezes or natural convection. In the day, {{the warmth of}} the sun results in increased atmospheric humidity. When moist daytime air enters the air well, it condenses on the presumably cool masonry. None of the high-mass collectors performed well, Knapen's aerial well being a particularly conspicuous example.|$|E
5|$|The {{music of}} So Beautiful or So What {{features}} West African blues-inspired guitar playing, Indian-style percussion, and experimentation with samples, which ranged from {{an excerpt from}} a 1941 sermon to <b>nighttime</b> ambience in Kenya. The songs were recorded with little bass but with a very large presence of bells. Much of Simon's lyrics touch on themes of spirituality and mortality, which Simon said was unintentional and resulted naturally in his songwriting process for the album.|$|E
5|$|The {{predictive}} or circadian system increases renal secretion {{of potassium}} during mealtime hours (e.g. daytime for humans, <b>nighttime</b> for rodents) {{independent of the}} presence, amount, or absence of potassium ingestion. It is mediated by a circadian oscillator in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the brain (central clock), which causes the kidney (peripheral clock) to secrete potassium in this rhythmic circadian fashion.|$|E
5|$|Underestimating the {{strength}} of Allied forces on Guadalcanal—about 12,000—Kawaguchi's 6,000 soldiers conducted several <b>nighttime</b> frontal assaults on the U.S. defenses. The main Japanese assault occurred around Lunga ridge south of Henderson Field, manned by troops from several U.S. Marine Corps units, primarily troops from the 1st Raider and 1st Parachute Battalions under U.S. Marine Corps Lieutenant Colonel Merritt A. Edson. Although the Marine defenses were almost overrun, Kawaguchi's attack was ultimately defeated, with heavy losses for the Japanese.|$|E
5|$|Wagner filmed the {{explosion}} scenes {{at the factory}} on location during <b>nighttime.</b> These explosion scenes were the first scenes of the film to be filmed {{before returning to the}} studio to film the rest of the film. The film crew had three weeks to prepare for the factory scene by clearing trees and bringing in some artificial trees to match Lang's idea for the scene. The explosion was triggered by Lang himself.|$|E
5|$|Washington's defeat {{revealed}} his deficiencies as a strategist who split his forces, his inexperienced generals who misunderstood the situation, and his raw troops that fled in disorder {{at the first}} shots. However, his daring <b>nighttime</b> retreat has been seen by some historians {{as one of his}} greatest military feats. Other historians concentrate on the failure of British naval forces to prevent the withdrawal.|$|E
5|$|About {{the size}} of a rabbit, the tammar is among the {{smallest}} of the wallabies in the genus Macropus. Its coat colour is largely grey. The tammar has several notable adaptations, including the ability to retain energy while hopping, colour vision and the ability to drink seawater. A nocturnal species, it spends <b>nighttime</b> in grassland habitat and daytime in shrubland. It is also very gregarious and has a seasonal, promiscuous mating pattern. A female tammar can nurse a joey in her pouch while keeping an embryo in her uterus. The tammar is a model species for research on marsupials, and on mammals in general. It is one of many organisms to have had its genome sequenced.|$|E
5|$|Activated in 1921, the {{division}} was created as an infantry unit {{with a focus}} on <b>nighttime</b> combat operations. Deployed during World War II, {{the division}} saw almost 200 days of fighting in northwestern Europe as it fought through France, Belgium, and western Germany, fighting back several fierce German counterattacks as it advanced through the theater throughout late 1944 and 1945. This was the only combat duty that the 104th Infantry Division has served during its history. At the end of the fighting on 7 May 1945 (V-E Day), this division was in central Germany opposite the troops of its allies from the Soviet Army.|$|E
5|$|Al-Kharrat {{commenced}} guerrilla {{operations in}} September, targeting French forces posted {{in the eastern}} and southern Ghouta. His prominence rose as he led <b>nighttime</b> raids against the French in Damascus, during which he disarmed army patrols and took soldiers hostage. In al-Shaghour, Souk Saruja and Jazmatiyya, al-Kharrat and his band burnt down all French-held buildings. In {{the first week of}} October, sixty French gendarmes were dispatched to the Ghouta to apprehend al-Kharrat and his fighters. The gendarmes were quartered in the home of al-Malihah's mukhtar (village headman). In the evening, the rebels attacked the residence, killing one gendarme and capturing the rest; the prisoners were eventually all returned unharmed.|$|E
5|$|As intended, the Comanche {{was to be}} {{equipped}} with sophisticated avionics, including navigation and detection systems, which would have to enabled operations during <b>nighttime</b> and within challenging weather conditions. Its primary mission was to scout around using its advanced sensors, attempting to find and designate targets for attack helicopters, such as the AH-64 Apache, to strike. The Comanche was furnished with a digital fly-by-wire flight control system. Each of the two crew members were to be provided {{with a pair of}} LCD multi-functional displays which would have functioned in addition to the Helmet-Integrated Display and Sight System (HIDSS) worn by the crew.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the game, the player is {{presented}} with a range of options that determine the experience. The game offers nine selectable levels of difficulty, including a tutorial difficulty in which the enemy forces do not fire back. Among the options, the player can choose to play either in summer or winter time and either daytime or <b>nighttime,</b> altering the scenery. The player must choose from the range of weapons that will be mounted on their AWAT plane. These include air-to-air, air-to-ground, air-to-sea and multipurpose missiles, depending on what enemies the player chooses to engage. In addition, the plane is equipped with a machine gun and decoy flares against hostile missiles.|$|E
5|$|By Monday May 8, {{the fire}} {{perimeter}} extended from west of Highway 154, {{in the hills}} burned in the 1990 Painted Cave Fire, across the front country of the Santa Ynez Mountains east through Mission Canyon, Rattlesnake Canyon, and into the hills above Montecito, reaching the area burned by the Gap Fire in July 2008 and the Tea Fire in November 2008. Intense sundowner winds caused the fire to spread rapidly during evening and <b>nighttime</b> hours during its first three days.|$|E
5|$|By Your Side was {{released}} on January12, 1999. The album's cover art is a blue-tinted <b>nighttime</b> photograph of the band, all dressed in white and {{standing in front of}} a lake. The band name is rendered in tiny white lights above their heads, and other small white lights are scattered at their feet. In keeping with the tiny lights theme, the back of the booklet shows a satellite image of the United States at night, in which densely populated areas can be discerned by light pollution, and the booklet contains drawings of constellations. The album's disc artwork is designed after a centaur with a crow's head in place of the man's head.|$|E
5|$|During {{the night}} of 15 December, {{the main body of}} the High Seas Fleet {{encountered}} British destroyers. Fearing the prospect of a <b>nighttime</b> torpedo attack, Admiral Ingenohl ordered the ships to retreat. Hipper was unaware of Ingenohl's reversal, and so he continued with the bombardment. Upon reaching the British coast, Hipper's battlecruisers split into two groups. Derfflinger and Von der Tann went south to shell Scarborough and Whitby while Seydlitz, Moltke, and Blücher went north to shell Hartlepool. By 09:45 on the 16th, the two groups had reassembled, and they began to retreat eastward.|$|E
5|$|Early {{pressings}} of {{the sleeve}} {{were presented in}} a six-panel gatefold cover, with one side displaying the landscape in the daytime, whilst the other shows the same image at night, playing {{with the idea that}} during the day, the countryside is glorious and the city is dull and grey, whereas at <b>nighttime</b> the countryside is dark and the city is illuminated and alive. To prioritize the design, no text was included on the sleeve apart from a promotional sticker shaped like a red balloon featuring the band's name and album title. Later copies of the album came in a standard plastic case with a protective cardboard sleeve.|$|E
5|$|Geography affects {{solar energy}} {{potential}} because {{areas that are}} closer to the equator have a greater amount of solar radiation. However, the use of photovoltaics that can follow {{the position of the}} sun can significantly increase the solar energy potential in areas that are farther from the equator. Time variation effects the potential of solar energy because during the <b>nighttime</b> there is little solar radiation {{on the surface of the}} Earth for solar panels to absorb. This limits the amount of energy that solar panels can absorb in one day. Cloud cover can affect the potential of solar panels because clouds block incoming light from the sun and reduce the light available for solar cells.|$|E
5|$|Hitmaker {{had tried}} to develop an on-line version of Crazy Taxi, to be called Crazy Taxi Next {{exclusively}} for the Xbox, which, besides multiplayer game modes, would have included night and day cycles, each with {{a different set of}} passengers and destinations, while reusing and graphically updating the maps from Crazy Taxi and Crazy Taxi 2. Ultimately, both multiplayer and day/night cycles were dropped and work on Crazy Taxi Next was transferred to Crazy Taxi 3: High Roller, which included some of the <b>nighttime</b> driving concepts suggested by Next.|$|E
5|$|Hydnellum fruitbodies have {{caps and}} stipes, often with indeterminant growth forms, that may grow in spurts and decay over several weeks. Neighboring fruitbodies can coalesce, forming {{intricately}} intertwined caps and partially fused stipes. The flesh has a zoned appearance and is fibrous when fresh, but becomes hard and woody when dry. Zones {{in the flesh}} reflect differences in growth during periods of low daytime and high <b>nighttime</b> humidity, and give a fairly accurate record of daily growth. The spines are crowded closely together and are typically decurrent (extending {{down the length of}} the stipe). Fruitbodies may display a variety of colors, from white to yellow, olive green, shades of orange, light brown, or dark brown in age.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, Cedar Point added Dinosaurs Alive!, a {{walk-through}} exhibit featuring approximately 50 life-size animatronic dinosaurs. It {{is located}} on Adventure Island and replaced the Paddlewheel Excursions boat cruise ride. A six-lane mat racer slide complex called Dragster H2O was added to Soak City. The slides around Dragster H2O were repainted and the Speed Slides were dismantled {{to make room for}} Dragster H2O. Cedar Point also introduced Fast Lane, their version of a fast-pass system, and a new <b>nighttime</b> show, Luminosity– Ignite the Night!. Cedar Point also removed WildCat for the 2012 season to make room for Luminosity. This was the first time since 1978 that a roller coaster was removed from Cedar Point.|$|E
5|$|Jeopardy! is an American {{television}} {{game show}} created by Merv Griffin. The show features a quiz competition in which contestants {{are presented with}} general knowledge clues {{in the form of}} answers, and must phrase their responses in the form of questions. The original daytime version debuted on NBC on March 30, 1964, and aired until January 3, 1975. A weekly <b>nighttime</b> syndicated edition aired from September 1974 to September 1975, and a revival, The All-New Jeopardy!, ran on NBC from October 1978 to March 1979. The current version, a daily syndicated show produced by Sony Pictures Television, premiered on September 10, 1984, and is still airing.|$|E
5|$|Larger ships {{often had}} false bows and sterns painted in a {{different}} shade {{from the rest of}} the hull to create the impression of the ship being at greater range from the observer. German decks were a very dark gray. Smaller ships operating in the North Sea or Baltic Sea were painted white or a very pale gray to blend in with daytime mist and <b>nighttime</b> phosphorescent organisms. As in the First World War, the Germans again employed disguised commerce raiders, Hilfskreuzer such as Atlantis, Thor and Kormoran. These ships were able to modify their appearance to throw off the searching Allied cruisers.|$|E
5|$|Luminosity — Ignite the Night!, often {{shortened}} to Luminosity, (previously named Luminosity, Powered by Pepsi), is a <b>nighttime</b> show performed nightly at Cedar Point {{amusement park}} in Sandusky, Ohio. It replaced American Portrait and the WildCat roller coaster. The show opened for previews on June 1, 2012 and held its grand-opening one week later. It ran nightly at 9:15 until August 19. Since 2013, {{the show has}} run every night at 9:30 pm except Tuesdays from May 31 – August 18.|$|E
5|$|Marysville {{holds an}} annual {{strawberry}} festival {{in the third}} week of June, which is highlighted by a grand parade on State Avenue and a <b>nighttime</b> fireworks show. The first annual strawberry festival was held in 1932 to celebrate the city's strawberry growing industry, and has only been cancelled during World War II from 1942 to 1945 and a polio outbreak in 1949. The week-long event attracts over 100,000 visitors and is the largest strawberry festival in Washington state. In addition to the Marysville Strawberry Festival, the city holds other annual events, including the Merrysville for the Holidays celebration and grand parade in early December.|$|E
