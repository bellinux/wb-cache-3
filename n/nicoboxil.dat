M. Sechenov First Moscow State Medical University, Moscow, Russian Federation Background/objective: Low {{back pain}} affects many {{patients}} {{and has a}} high socioeconomic impact. Topical capsaicinoids {{have been used for}} decades to treat musculoskeletal pain. This study investigated the effects of the fixed dose combination (FDC) of nonivamide (a capsaicinoid) and <b>nicoboxil</b> (a nicotinic acid ester) cream in the treatment of acute nonspecific low back pain. Materials and methods: This phase III randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multinational, multi-center trial investigated efficacy, safety, and tolerability of topical <b>nicoboxil</b> 1. 08 %/nonivamide 0. 17 % (Finalgon® cream) in treatment of acute nonspecific low back pain with the endpoints: pain intensity (PI) difference between pre-dose baseline and 8 hours after first application and the end of treatment, mobility score, and efficacy score. Results: Patients (n= 138), 21 – 65 years of age, were treated for up to 4 days with FDC or placebo cream. Mean baseline PI was 6. 8 on a 0 – 10 point numerical rating scale. After 8 hours, pain was more reduced with the FDC than with placebo (adjusted means: 2. 824 vs. 0. 975 points; p< 0. 0001). On the last treatment day, mean pain reduction by the FDC was stronger than with placebo (adjusted means: 5. 132 vs. 2. 174 points; p< 0. 0001). Mobility on Day 1 was in favor of the FDC when compared to placebo (odds ratio [95 % confidence interval {CI}]: 7. 200 [3. 609, 14. 363], p< 0. 0001). At the end of treatment, patients treated with the FDC rated efficacy significantly higher than placebo (odds ratio [95 % CI]: 11. 370 [5. 342, 24. 199], p< 0. 0001). Both treatments were tolerated well. No serious adverse events were reported. Conclusion: Nicoboxil/nonivamide cream is an effective and safe treatment for acute nonspecific low back pain, adding a promising treatment option.
