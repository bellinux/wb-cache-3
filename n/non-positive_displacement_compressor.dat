Starting from a known rotor profile, all the algorithms {{to calculate the}} second rotor profile, {{the size of the}} control volume, and the compressor’s performance are presented. The proposed modeling approach can be applied in an optimization procedure to find the optimal rotor profiles for a given application, with corresponding working conditions. Furthermore, based on the modeling results and substantiated with measurements on different compressor types, a similarity law for positive <b>displacement</b> <b>compressors</b> seems to exist. The existence of a similarity law has large application potential as it could be used to predict the performance of a positive <b>displacement</b> <b>compressor</b> in other than the (lab) tested working conditions. Further investigation of the similarity law for positive <b>displacement</b> <b>compressors</b> is therefore proposed as a key topic for future research. status: publishe...|$|R
50|$|Rotary screw {{compressors}} are also positive <b>displacement</b> <b>compressors.</b> Two meshing screw-rotors rotate in opposite directions, trapping refrigerant vapor, {{and reducing the}} volume of the refrigerant along the rotors to the discharge point.|$|R
50|$|Scroll {{compressors}} {{are also}} positive <b>displacement</b> <b>compressors.</b> The refrigerant is compressed when one spiral orbits around a second stationary spiral, creating {{smaller and smaller}} pockets and higher pressures.

5000|$|The {{compressor}} can {{be driven}} by the car's engine (e.g. via a belt, often the serpentine belt, and an electromagnetically actuated clutch; an electronically actuated variable <b>displacement</b> <b>compressor</b> can also be always directly driven by a belt without the need of any clutch and magnet at all) or by an electric motor.|$|R
30|$|Furthermore, no basic {{differentiation}} {{of the energy}} balance is made between a displacement and working piston because that has only a constructive meaning. The appearing leaky mass flow about the piston seals (which can be predicted mathematically only inexactly) is extremely low at a <b>displacement</b> <b>compressor</b> due to the lower pressure differences, and the effects for the process can be neglected.|$|R
40|$|Different {{types of}} {{positive}} <b>displacement</b> <b>compressors</b> {{are employed in}} low-capacity air conditioning applications. Understanding the advantages and drawbacks {{of each of these}} technologies is important in order to identify the ranges of cooling capacities at which a specific compression technology is more efficient. This paper presents a comparative analysis between two positive <b>displacement</b> <b>compressors</b> (rolling piston and scroll) designed for air conditioning applications. The compressors operate with R- 22 and present a nominal cooling capacity of 18000 BTU/h at the AHRI-A checkpoint condition. First, the compressors were tested in a hot-cycle test bench to measure the mass flow rate and power consumption for MBP and HBP operating conditions. The results showed that the most efficient compressor depends on the operating condition. Â After this, simulation models for each compressor were validated against the experimental data, showing good agreement. Therefore, through the simulation models, it was possible to evaluate the effect of different aspects, such as leakage, heat transfer and discharge process, on the efficiency of each compressor...|$|R

With high temperature hydraulic fluid, both the compressor and the expander can be liquid ring pump even up to 400 °C, with rotating casing for best efficiency.|$|R
40|$|Thermodynamic {{models to}} {{simulate}} positive <b>displacement</b> <b>compressors</b> {{are well known}} for a few decades already and can describe the compressor performance quite well. One {{of the most complex}} part of the simulation process however is the positive <b>displacement</b> <b>compressor</b> geometry simulation. In the current context, under geometry simulation, values of working compressor volumes, as well as cross-sections of port openings, at different shaft (rotor) angles are considered. In the current paper, as an example, the Greene formula approach was applied to a geometry simulation of a single screw compressor. Working chamber geometry was defined by “cutting “ it with the gate rotor blade; flute volume was computed using Greene formula; suction and discharge ports were intersected with this volume so that port opening contours were defined and their respective cross sectional areas were calculated. The results of this geometry simulation were applied for a thermodynamic model of a single screw compressor. Experimental investigation of a single screw working process using pressure transducers has been conducted. Geometry simulation data was applied to calculate compression work from experimental pressure traces. Pressure-volume diagrams obtained experimentally were compared to the simulated ones. Also, indicator work obtained from simulation and experiment, was compared to the power input to the shaft, and demonstrated good correlation...|$|R

Its {{purpose is to}} increase the motive power output from the internal combustion engine attainable with a given engine displacement.

We build the compressor system and gradually add components so as to end up with the complete system. The simulation results shows that when the suction pressure becomes at some point smaller than the regulation pressure, the valve controls the <b>compressor</b> <b>displacement</b> and tends to reduce it in order to maintain a certain level for the suction pressure.

50|$|The {{isentropic}} {{efficiency of}} scroll compressors is {{slightly higher than}} that of a typical reciprocating compressor when the compressor is designed to operate near one selected rating point. The scroll compressors are more efficient in this case because {{they do not have a}} dynamic discharge valve that introduces additional throttling losses. However, the efficiency of a scroll compressor that does not have a discharge valve begins to decrease as compared to the reciprocating compressor at higher pressure ratio operation. This is a result of under-compression losses that occur at high pressure ratio operation of the positive <b>displacement</b> <b>compressors</b> that do not have a dynamic discharge valve.|$|R

40|$|The ECS and the {{anti-ice}} {{systems are}} two of the energy consumers for an aircraft; they absorb together two times the sum of the power of all the other systems (electrical, mechanical and hydraulic). More efficient ECSs and a more efficient anti-ice sub-systems would reduce the aircraft fuel consumption increasing the operative radius of the vehicle and also increasing the maximum useful load. The anti-ice sub-system is not only a key energy consumer {{but it is also a}} system critical for the flight safety: a failure of this system means a mission abort and the landing on the nearest airport. This thesis presents the results of several mathematical models which have been developed to study the performance of the aforementioned systems and the strategies to reduce their impacts on the aircraft fuel consumption. The models have been developed using AMEsim and Simulink. In particular a mathematical model, which describes the behavior of the inline pneumatic valves, have been created. The model uses the fundamental thermodynamic and mechanical differential equations to simulate the dynamic behavior of the valves. The mathematical model reproduces the results of the experimental tests within their uncertainty. The validated model has been used to explore the behavior of the valve and its own subcomponents proposing two possible solutions to increase the operative range of the valves and to decrease the influence of the pressure and temperature on the regulated pressure. The second detailed mathematical model created calculates the performance of the plate and wavy fins compact heat exchangers. The model, based on the work of Kays & London, includes some improvements related to the description heat exchanger geometry and related to the empirical correlations used to calculate the number of Stanton. The tests performed on three different heat exchangers have been used to validated the developed model; the mathematical model is able to predict the performance of the performance of the HXs with an accuracy compatible with most the industrial applications. The developed detailed models have been used to simulate the behavior of the system where they are installed. The behavior of an anti-ice system at extreme high bleed air temperature has been analyzed. An innovative architecture for anti-ice system is studied and the benefits on aircraft fuel consumption for a standard day mission are shown. The performance of an reverse Brayton-Joule cycle has been analyzed and a new possible control strategy based on a line installed in series to the air cycle machine is proposed. The limits of the proposed architecture are exposed studying the case of a system used to cool some electronic equipment. The benefits of the use of a reverse Brayton-Joule system which does not use the air bled from the engine (bleedless approach) are detailed with particular attention to the gain in terms of fuel penalty. The thesis ends with the results of the VCS simulations. Some technical solutions to fit a fixed <b>displacement</b> <b>compressor</b> architecture into an aircraft are explained; the solutions are oriented to increase the reliability of the compressor avoiding a continuous switch on and off even with low heat loads.
