We find a mean reassessment of stock value following short sales of up to - 0. 20 percent with adverse information impounded within fifteen minutes or twenty trades. Short sales executed {{near the end of}} the financial year and those related to arbitrage and hedging activities are associated with a smaller price reaction; trades <b>near</b> <b>information</b> events precipitate larger price reactions.

We propose simple, scalable greedy algorithms for adding a set of extra information links to optimize team performance and resilience to non-cooperative and adversarial agents.

Although this implies that the greedy algorithm is not accompanied by worst-case performance guarantees, we illustrate through numerical experiments that it can produce effective and often optimal or <b>near</b> optimal <b>information</b> structure modifications...|$|R

However, opponents are skeptical of how the raw information can be useful and fear information overload, or that there would be too much irrelevant information out there.

Visual appearance {{is known to be}} very useful in place recognition tasks. In recent years, {{it has been shown that}} taking geometric information also into account further improves system robustness. Stereo visual systems provide 3 D information and texture of nearby regions, as well as an image of far regions. In order to make use of all this information, our system builds two probabilistic undirected graphs, each considering either <b>near</b> or far <b>information.</b> Inference is carried out in the framework of conditional random fields. We evaluate our algorithm in public indoor and outdoor datasets from the RAWSEEDS project and in an outdoor dataset obtained at the MIT campus.

40|$|Mid {{and near}} InfraRed spectroscopies {{provides}} useful information of the molecular composition of biological systems related to molecular vibrations, overtones, and combinations of fundamental vibrations and bonds. Actual challenges for biorefineries, biotechnologies, and environment applications are to identify discriminating wavenumbers allowing {{to evaluate the}} biodegradation process of the lignocellulosic biomass. This study addresses this issue through {{the implementation of a}} genetic algorithm by choosing adapted steps and a Davies-Bouldin fitness function. Results show that the genetic algorithm with a Davies-Bouldin as fitness function and the choice of adapted steps select interesting wavenumbers corresponding to principal chemical functional groups can be identified on maize roots samples. These wavenumbers highlight the different stages of the biodegradation process. This result can be improved by combining the mid and <b>near</b> - InfraRed <b>information.</b> then this combination of mid and <b>near</b> - InfraRed <b>information</b> give the best classification according to the periods of the biodegradation process...|$|R
