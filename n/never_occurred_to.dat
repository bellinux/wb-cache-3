If the missing were to return alive, which has <b>never</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> date, the cross is to be circumscribed by a circle.|$|E
25|$|Once he had {{established}} the camp at Isandlwana, Chelmsford sent out two battalions of the Natal Native Contingent to scout ahead. They skirmished with {{elements of a}} Zulu force which Chelmsford {{believed to be the}} vanguard of the main enemy army. Such was the confidence in British military training and firepower that he divided his force, taking about 2,500 men, including half of the British infantry contingent, and set out to find the main Zulu force with the intention of bringing them to battle, so as to achieve a decisive victory. It <b>never</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> Chelmsford that the Zulus he saw were diverting him from their main force.|$|E

500|$|Originally, Shannon McMahon {{was to be}} a {{recurring}} character and was due to be featured in [...] "The Truth", the series finale of The X-Files. However, Lawless, who has a history of miscarriages, became pregnant shortly after part two of these episodes was filmed; her high-risk pregnancy prevented her returning to the series for future episodes.

500|$|During {{previous}} searches, {{including a}} visit by a repairman, no dog was heard. The house had been searched three times before, but the bedroom closet where {{her body was found}} was not searched. Rev. Harry McIntyre looked in bedroom closets on February 26, but it <b>never</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> him to search the front-bedroom closet. [...] "I concentrated on the basement, believing the girl might have fallen down the stairs," [...] he said. A volunteer fireman, John Reeves, also searched the first-floor bedroom but not the closet. Barker may have been too frightened to cry out.|$|E

500|$|J. P. Earwaker {{heavily criticized}} {{the design of}} the {{accordion}} experiment as it took place under a dining room table. Earwaker who read Crookes' report noted that [...] "no reason for this strangest of all strange positions is even hinted at." [...] He also wrote [...] "it <b>never</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> [...] to notice whether the keys were depressed or not... it would be obvious that if the keys were not pressed down, it was impossible for the music really to have come from the accordion, and its true source must have been looked for elsewhere." ...|$|E
500|$|Electro was {{voiced by}} Crispin Freeman, {{who sought to}} reflect in his vocal style the {{psychological}} decline {{brought on by the}} character's new powers: [...] "It <b>never</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> me before how that would have an effect on his character [...] to be dealing with that curse and blessing. And when you think about it, that's also Peter Parker's core issue." [...] The episode's title, [...] "Interactions," [...] expands the series theme [...] "The Education of Peter Parker" [...] chosen by developer Greg Weisman. Episodes in the early season one arc all shared a naming scheme based on the biological sciences.|$|E
500|$|Because Scheyer's {{talent was}} obvious {{by the time}} he was set to start high school, many people {{encouraged}} his parents to move so he could attend a high school with a powerhouse basketball program. [...] The move was recommended so that he would have a greater chance of success. Scheyer shrugged off the suggestion, telling his parents: [...] "We'll just do it here. We'll build the success at Glenbrook North." [...] His father said: [...] "I get chills thinking about it. [...] That wasn't my vision. [...] It wasn't Laury's. It wasn't his coaches'.

500|$|In a November 2014 {{cover story}} for Out {{promoting}} The Imitation Game, Cumberbatch opened up about sexual experimentation {{during his time}} in boarding schools stating, [...] "While there was experimentation, it had <b>never</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> me as, 'Oh, this is that!' It was just boys and their penises, {{the same way with}} girls and vaginas and boobs. It wasn't out of desire." [...] LGBT group Stonewall released a statement praising Cumberbatch's comments, saying, [...] "Seeing someone in the public eye – especially somebody as influential as Benedict – talking positively around gay issues, is powerful for young lesbian, gay and bisexual people. It is often difficult for those growing up to find role models who demonstrate that it is equally okay to be gay or straight." ...|$|E
500|$|On 31 October 1994 Princess Andrew's two {{surviving}} children, the Duke of Edinburgh and Princess George of Hanover, went to Yad Vashem (the Holocaust Memorial) in Jerusalem {{to witness}} a ceremony honouring her as [...] "Righteous Among the Nations" [...] for having hidden the Cohens in her house in Athens during the Second World War. Prince Philip said of his mother's sheltering of persecuted Jews, [...] "I suspect that it <b>never</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> her that her action was in any way special. She was {{a person with a}} deep religious faith, and she would have considered it to be a perfectly natural human reaction to fellow beings in distress."

500|$|... "Yoda" [...] was {{originally}} written by [...] "Weird Al" [...] Yankovic {{during the initial}} run of the second Star Wars movie, the 1980 American epic space opera The Empire Strikes Back. The film introduced the character of Yoda, the ancient Jedi Master who trains Luke {{in the ways of}} The Force following the demise of Obi-Wan Kenobi. Yankovic later jokingly said that, [...] "Prior to The Empire Strikes Back, the thought of writing a song about Yoda had <b>never</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> me." [...] He {{toyed with the idea of}} writing a song based on the break-out character, but was unable to find a suitable piece to parody until one of his friends proposed that he use [...] "Lola"—"which I couldn't believe that I hadn't thought of myself, since I was such a huge Kinks fan." ...|$|E

500|$|Hill and Beatty {{left the}} film, which Paramount began {{developing}} as a lower-budget project with Richard Benjamin directing. Cash and Epps continued {{to rewrite the}} script, but Universal was unsatisfied. The film rights eventually reverted to Tribune Media Services in 1985. However, Beatty decided to option the Dick Tracy rights himself, along with the Cash/Epps script. When Jeffrey Katzenberg moved from Paramount to the Walt Disney Studios, Dick Tracy resurfaced with Beatty as director, producer and leading man. He considered hiring Martin Scorsese to direct the film, but changed his mind. [...] "It <b>never</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> me to direct the movie," [...] Beatty admitted, [...] "but finally, {{like most of the}} movies that I direct, when the time comes to do it, I just do it because it's easier than going through what I'd have to go through to get somebody else to do it." ...|$|E
500|$|While it is {{possible}} to apply Locke's general principles of education to all children, and contemporaries such as Coste certainly did so, Locke himself, despite statements that may imply the contrary, believed that Some Thoughts applied only to the wealthy and the middle-class (or as they would have been referred to at the time, the [...] "middling sorts"). One of Locke's conclusions in Some Thoughts Concerning Education is that he [...] "think a Prince, a Nobleman, and an ordinary Gentleman's Son, should have different Ways of Breeding." [...] As Peter Gay writes, [...] "t <b>never</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> him that every child should be educated or that all those to be educated should be educated alike. Locke believed that until the school system was reformed, a gentleman ought to have his son trained at home by a tutor. As for the poor, they do not appear in Locke's little book at all." ...|$|E
500|$|Comparisons {{were drawn}} between Willy Wonka and Michael Jackson. Burton {{disagreed}} with the comparisons and said Jackson, unlike Wonka, liked children. Depp said the similarities with Jackson <b>never</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> him. Instead, he compared Wonka to Howard Hughes due to his [...] "reclusive, germaphobe, controlling" [...] nature. Burton agreed with the similarity to Hughes. He also cited Charles Foster Kane from Citizen Kane as an inspiration for Wonka, as Kane is [...] "somebody who was brilliant but then was traumatized and then retreats into their own world". Depp wanted to sport prosthetic makeup for the part and have a long, elongated nose, but Burton believed {{it would be too}} outrageous. During production, Gene Wilder, in an interview with The Daily Telegraph, accused the filmmakers of only remaking the 1971 film for the purpose of money. Depp said he was disappointed by Wilder's comment, and responded that the film was not a remake, but a new adaptation of Dahl's 1964 book.|$|E

500|$|McDiarmid was {{surprised}} when Lucas approached him 16 years after Return of the Jedi to reprise the role of Palpatine. In an interview, he stated, [...] "When we were doing Return of the Jedi there was a rumor that George Lucas had nine films in his head, and he'd clearly just completed three of them." [...] McDiarmid added, [...] "Someone said that, 'Oh, I think what he might do next is go back in time, and show how Vader came to be.' It <b>never</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> me {{in a million years}} that I would be involved in that, because I thought, 'oh well, then he'll get a much younger actor [...]' That would be obvious." [...] However, [...] "I was the right age, ironically, for the first prequel when it was made. ...

500|$|Wolf {{has been}} a {{consistent}} supporter of mandated paid sick days for employees, with his company Cape Air offering paid leave for all employees. Wolf, along with Kay Khan in the House of Representatives, introduced the [...] "2013 Earned Paid Sick Time" [...] bill, which would allow employees to one hour of paid sick leave for every thirty worked. To generate support among other Senators, Wolf {{went so far as}} to hold a protest with workers' rights activists at a Dunkin' Donuts frequented by legislators. While advocating for the bill in a committee hearing, Wolf admitted “it <b>never</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> me that there were that many businesses out there that didn't offer this as a benefit,” and referred to the experience as “an eye-opener.” Although the proposal eventually expired without being passed, for reasons Wolf described as a compromise with the legislature having already passed an incremental minimum wage increase, he campaigned for a ballot measure in 2014 which would mandate universal employee sick time.|$|E
500|$|The {{facility}} {{was designed by}} Graham McCourt Architects. [...] While {{they set out to}} design a unique building, the idea of a western theme <b>never</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> Barry Graham or his team. [...] The roof of the building was designed to be a reverse hyperbolic paraboloid, allowing for a pillar free view from all seats and reducing the interior volume by up to one-third when compared to traditional arenas, resulting in reduced heating, lighting and maintenance costs, plus the floating roof can flex to compensate for the city's frequent temperature fluctuations. [...] When the design was unveiled, the roof was immediately referred to as being saddle-shaped. [...] Of 1,270 entries submitted in a contest to name the arena, 735 involved the word Saddle. [...] The winning name in the contest, Olympic Saddledome, was drawn from a hat filled with several similar saddle-themed names. At the time the name received a tepid reception from some, including the chairman of Calgary's Olympic Organizing Committee (OCO), Frank King, who was quoted as saying [...] "It is neither Olympic nor western, and it's not even dome".|$|E
