"Yes," [...] {{said the}} latter, [...] "they're {{not much to}} look at <b>now.</b> <b>They</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> go through quite a lot of dressing, and I've heard that in the first place all the long outside hair is plucked out. There's an inner coat." [...] He looked at the men. [...] "It's done in England, isn't it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The Burmese {{are very}} brave," [...] Stanley agreed, [...] "but, hitherto, {{they have only}} fought against people less warlike than themselves. <b>Now</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> deal with {{a nation that has}} made war a study, and which always keeps up a large army of men who are trained to fight, and who spend all their time in {{military}} exercises. It is not that they are stronger than the Burmese, for the Burmese are very strong men; but only that men who are trained to act together must, necessarily, possess a great advantage over those who have had no such training--who simply take up arms for the occasion and, when the trouble is over, return to their homes and lay them by, until called out to fight again.|$|E
60|$|This {{is not an}} over-coloured picture. Can we not see, then, {{what was}} the inner reason for the war? Can we not {{understand}} that it was needful to shake mankind loose from gossip and pink teas, and sword-worship, and Saturday night drunks, and self-seeking politics and theological quibbles--to wake them up and make them realise that they stand upon a narrow knife-edge between two awful eternities, and that, here and <b>now,</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> finish with make-beliefs, and with real earnestness and courage face those truths which have always been palpable where indolence, or cowardice, or vested interests have not obscured the vision. Let us try to appreciate what those truths are and the direction which reform must take. It is the new spiritual developments which predominate in my own thoughts, {{but there are two}} other great readjustments which are necessary before they can take their full effect. On the spiritual side I can speak with the force of knowledge from the beyond. On the other two points of reform, I make no such claim.|$|E
6000|$|... "There, now, she's {{hard and}} fast!" [...] roared the captain, as he stormed about the deck in a {{paroxysm}} of rage. But man's rage could avail nothing. <b>They</b> <b>had</b> missed the passage {{by a few}} feet, and <b>now</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> wait the fall and rise again of the tide ere they could hope to get off.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nothing but {{ice from}} now on," [...] {{announced}} Jack Wumble, {{and he was}} right, by morning everything was frozen up, [...] "as stiff as a stake," [...] as Sam expressed it. The day before <b>they</b> <b>had</b> caught some water dripping from the rocks, for drinking purposes, <b>now</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> melt the ice over the fire to get the liquid.|$|R

60|$|The little immortals had set {{themselves}} a difficult task; for although <b>they</b> <b>had</b> assisted Santa Claus {{on many of}} his journeys, their master had always directed and guided them and told them exactly what he wished them <b>to</b> do. But <b>now</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> distribute the toys {{according to their own}} judgment, and they did not understand children as well as did old Santa. So it is no wonder they made some laughable errors.|$|R
6000|$|... "They are coming!" [...] {{came from}} Dan Casey, {{just as the}} nearest of the trees was gained. [...] "Back, ye rascals!" [...] he shouted, and fired {{as quickly as he}} could. Casey was right; the Tagals were {{surrounding}} them, and <b>now</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> fight back to back, in as hot a contest as the young captain <b>had</b> ever seen. <b>They</b> were clearly outnumbered, but retreat was impossible, for the Filipinos surrounded them upon every side.|$|R

6000|$|... 'Did Monsieur wish {{to go to}} La Sablerie? Ah! then he did {{not know}} what had happened. The {{soldiers}} had been there; there had been a great burning. <b>They</b> <b>had</b> been out in their boats at sea, but <b>they</b> <b>had</b> seen the sky red--red as a furnace, all night; and the steeple was down.

50|$|In 2004 {{the guys}} {{felt that their}} mission was complete. Their music was {{changing}} throughout the years, and <b>now</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> {{face the fact that}} it didn’t fit psychobilly scene anymore. So they took it even further, doubled the line up with 3-piece brass section and mixed up their older sounds with ska punk and some Ukrainian folk. The new project called Mad Heads XL became a smashing success in Ukraine, so it was decided to quit as a trio for an indeterminate period.|$|R
