40|$|Abstract [...] Changes in {{hydraulic}} onductivity (HC) {{and clay}} dispersion of smectite-sand mixtures {{as a function}} of exchangeable Na in Na-Ca and Na-Mg systems were measured. The charge density on the smectites had no effect on Na-Ca and Na-Mg equilibrium, and the affinity of the clays for Na was similar in both systems. A decrease in HC at 0. 01 M concentration was found to be due to clay swelling. Mg was found to be less effective than Ca in preventing the breakdown of the packets by low concentrations of exchangeable Na, and Na-Mg-smectite swelled more than Na-Ca-smectites. Na-Mg-clay particles dispersed more readily than Na-Ca-clay particles when the mixtures were leached with distilled water; however, if the electrolyte concentration in the clay-sand mixture was controlled by the leaching solutions, no difference between the Na-Mg- and Na-Ca-clays was noted. Thus, the effect of Mg on clay mixtures leached with distilled water was apparently due to the effect of Mg on the hydrolysis of the clays. Increase in charge density increased the stability of the R 2 § clay packets, and higher con-centrations of <b>Na</b> were <b>needed</b> to break the packets. Mg was less effective than Ca in stabilizing the packets, and lower concentrations of <b>Na</b> were <b>needed</b> to break the Mg-packets...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe {{previously}} isolated {{a variant}} of the influenza virus NWS/G 70 C, with a decreased sensitivity to the neuraminidase-specific inhibitor 4 -guanidino-Neu 5 Ac 2 enin vitro,which has a mutation in one of the conserved residues of the neuraminidase Glu 119 to Gly. Despite the mutation, purified neuraminidase demonstrated the same specific activity as the parent neuraminidase. In contrast, characterization of a similar mutant by another group revealed a low specific activity of the enzyme. We confirm here that the specific activity of our variant is {{the same as that of}} the parent, but report that this mutation makes the enzyme inherently unstable, at high and low temperatures, either on the virion or as purified neuraminidase. Thus, for a valid determination of specific activity the concentration of native <b>NA</b> <b>needs</b> to be determined at the time of enzyme assay. Structurally, the instability may be partially explained by the introduction of a side chain (Gly), which carries a greater entropy penalty in condensation of the structure from the unfolded to the folded state and this, together with the loss of stabilizing interaction between Glu 119 and its neighbors in the active site, is not compensated for by the water molecule occupying the position of the carboxylate group (6) ...|$|R

40|$|Crystallographic {{information}} can be determined for bulk specimens in a SEM by utilizing electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD), which is {{also referred to as}} backscatter electron Kikuchi diffraction. This technique provides similar information to that provided by selected area electron channeling (SAEC). However, the spatial resolutions of the two techniques are limited by different processes. In SAEC patterns, the spatial resolution is limited to {approximately} 2 {mu}m by the motion of the beam on the specimen, which results from the angular rocking of the beam and the aberration of the probe forming lens. Therefore, smaller incident probe sizes provide no improvement in spatial resolution of SAEC patterns. In contrast, the spatial resolution for EBSD, which uses a stationary beam and an area detector, is determined by (1) the incident probe size and (2) the size of the interaction volume from which significant backscattered electrons are produced {{in the direction of the}} EBSD detector. The second factor is influenced by the accelerating voltage, the specimen tilt, and the relative orientation of scattering direction and the specimen tilt axis. This study was performed on a Philips XL 30 /FEG SEM equipped with a TexSEM Orientation Imaging Microscopy (OIM) system. The signal from the EBSD detector (SIT camera) is flat- fielded and enhanced in a MTI frame storage/image processor. The Schottky FEG source provides the fine probe sizes ({approximately} 10 nm) desired with sufficient probe current ({approximately} 1 <b>nA)</b> <b>needed</b> for image processing with the low signal/noise EBSD signal...|$|R

40|$|Cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR) and {{nicotinic acid}} adenine {{dinucleotide}} phosphate (NAADP) {{have been shown}} to mobilize intracellular Ca 2 + stores by totally independent mechanisms, which are pharmacologically distinct from that activated by inositol trisphosphate. Although cADPR and NAADP are structurally and functionally different, they can be synthesized by a single enzyme having ADP-ribosyl cyclase activity. In this study, three different assays were used to measure the metabolism of cADPR in sea urchin egg homogenates including a radioimmunoassay, a Ca 2 + release assay, and a thin layer chromatographic assay. Soluble and membrane-bound ADP-ribosyl cyclases were identified and both cyclized NAD to produce cADPR. The soluble cyclase was half-maximally stimulated by 5. 3 μM cGMP, but not by cAMP, while the membrane-bound form was independent of cGMP. The two forms of the cyclase were also different in the pH dependence of utilizing nicotinamide guanine dinucleotide (NGD), a guanine analog of NAD, as substrate, indicating they are two separate enzymes. The stimulatory effect of cGMP required ATP or ATPγS (adenosine 5 '-O-(3 -thiotriphosphate)) and a cGMP-dependent kinase activity was shown to be present in the soluble fraction. The degradation of cADPR to ADP-ribose was catalyzed by cADPR hydrolase, which was found to be predominantly associated with membranes. Similar to the membrane-bound cyclase, the cADPR hydrolase activity was also independent of cGMP. Both the soluble and membrane fractions also catalyzed the synthesis of NAADP through exchanging the nicotinamide group of NADP with nicotinic acid (NA). The base- exchange activity was independent of cGMP and the half-maximal concentrations of NADP and <b>NA</b> <b>needed</b> were about 0. 2 mM and 10 mM, respectively. The exchange reaction showed a preference for acidic pH, contrasting with the neutral pH optimum of the cyclase activities.

In general, higher concentrations of 5 -ALA-SQ <b>NAs</b> were <b>needed</b> to efficiently induce the biosynthesis of PpIX when compared to 5 -ALA-Hex, presumably due to the different ester bond cleavage rates within the cancer cells. Decrease in PpIX production was observed when concentrations higher than 1  mM of 5 -ALA-Hex were used due to the non-specific toxicity of 5 -ALA-Hex.This effect was much less pronounced for the 5 -ALA-SQ where the fluorescence levels started to drop off only at the highest tested concentration (3.3  mM) and prolonged incubation times (Fig. 5 b, d). However, the fluorescence levels were similar for both compounds without any fluorescence lag observed for the NAs.|$|R
40|$|Neuraminidases (NAs) are {{critical}} virulence factors for several microbial pathogens. With a highly conserved catalytic domain, a microbial NA “superfamily” has been proposed. We previously reported that murine polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) sialidase activity {{was important in}} leukocyte trafficking to inflamed sites and that antibodies to Clostridium perfringens NA recognized a cell surface molecule(s), presumed to be a sialidase of eukaryotic origin on interleukin- 8 -stimulated human and murine PMNs. These antibodies also inhibited cell sialidase activity both in vitro and, in the latter instance, in vivo. We therefore hypothesized that mammalian sialidases share structural homology and epitopes with microbial NAs. We now report that antibodies {{to one of the}} isoforms of C.  perfringens NA, as well as anti-influenza virus NA serum, recognize human NEU 3 but not NEU 1 and that antibodies to C.  perfringens NA inhibit NEU 3 enzymatic activity. We conclude that the previously described microbial NA superfamily extends to human sialidases. Strategies designed to therapeutically inhibit microbial <b>NA</b> may <b>need</b> to consider potential compromising effects on human sialidases, particularly those expressed in cells of the immune system...|$|R
40|$|Traditional optical imaging {{faces an}} {{unavoidable}} trade-o between resolution {{and depth of}} eld (DOF). To increase resolution, high numerical apertures (<b>NA)</b> are <b>needed,</b> but the associated large angular uncertainty results in a limited range of depths that can be put in sharp focus. Plenoptic imaging was introduced {{a few years ago}} to remedy this trade o. To this aim, plenoptic imaging reconstructs the path of light rays from the lens to the sensor. However, the improvement offered by standard plenoptic imaging is practical and not fundamental: the increased DOF leads to a proportional reduction of the resolution well above the diffraction limit imposed by the lens NA. In this paper, we demonstrate that correlation measurements enable pushing plenoptic imaging to its fundamental limits of both resolution and DOF. Namely, we experimentally demonstrate to maintain the imaging resolution at the diraction limit while increasing the depth of eld by a factor 4. Our results represent the theoretical and experimental basis for the effective development of thepromising applications of plenoptic imaging...|$|R

For a successful gene delivery system, these <b>NA</b> vehicles <b>need</b> to comprise several functionalities. This work focuses on the modification of oligoaminoamide carriers with hydrophilic oligomer blocks mediating nanoparticle shielding potential, which is necessary to prevent aggregation or dissociation of NA polyplexes in vitro, and hinder opsonization with blood components in vivo. Herein, the shielding agent polyethylene glycol (PEG) in three defined lengths (12, 24, or 48 oxyethylene repeats) is compared with two peptidic shielding blocks composed of four or eight repeats of sequential proline-alanine-serine (PAS). With both types of shielding agents, we found opposing effects {{of the length of}} hydrophilic segments on shielding and compaction of formed plasmid DNA (pDNA) nanoparticles. Two-arm oligoaminoamides with 37 cationizable nitrogens linked to 12 oxyethylene units or four PAS repeats resulted in very compact 40 – 50 nm pDNA nanoparticles, whereas longer shielding molecules destabilize the investigated polyplexes. Thus, the balance between sufficiently shielded but still compact and stable particles can be considered a critical optimization parameter for non-viral nucleic acid vehicles based on hydrophilic-cationic block oligomers...|$|R
