40|$|ABSTRACT—In a {{previous}} study, {{search for a}} notched-disk target abutting a square among complete-disk nontargets and squares was inefficient in 250 -ms exposures, but relatively efficient in 100 -ms exposures. This finding was interpreted as evidence that amodal completion proceeds through a mosaic and then a completion stage, with the latter preempting the former. We used the same target but changed its context: Nontargets were instead <b>notched</b> <b>disks</b> near squares. Task set was also different: Participants searched for a complete disk. Contrary {{to the prediction of}} the preemption model, search was efficient in the 100 -ms condition and inefficient in the 250 -ms condition. We propose that in both the present and the previous studies, the target was ambiguous, and task set and context affected how it was perceived. In both experiments, set effects were evident for 100 -ms exposures; context effects were evident for 250 -ms exposures...|$|R

These component antennas are unified {{as a single}} composite diversity antenna by mounting the wire antenna on the <b>notched</b> <b>disk.</b> Antenna characteristics are calculated using the method of moments (MoM) with wire grid models and examined in terms of component arrangement and terminal isolation. It is found that maximum isolation is obtained when the current path of the wire antenna is where the current exciting the H-pol element is cancelled. Consequently, both component antennas may work independently even in the composite form. The quasi-monopole pattern is also confirmed for each polarization...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{evaluate}} pattern electroretinogram optimized for glaucoma screening (PERGLA) and retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) at spectral optical coherence tomography (OCT) in eyes with suspected glaucoma (GS) and in eyes with ocular hypertension (OHT). This is a cross-sectional, observational study. Twenty-four patients with GS (BCVA 20 / 20, normal visual field, intraocular pressure, IOP, less than 21 mmHg, and glaucomatous optic neuropathy, GON) and 14 patients with OHT (BCVA 20 / 20, intraocular pressure 25 mmHg, absence of glaucomatous optic neuropathy and normal visual field) were considered in this study. GON was intended as vertical cup-disk ratio of 0. 5 or more; asymmetry of greater than 0. 2, <b>disk</b> <b>notching,</b> <b>disk</b> splinter hemorrhages. PERGLA amplitude and phase were measured, while thickness of the RNFL was obtained with spectral OCT. A control group of 50 age-matched healthy patients was added.

30|$|Although DSC/TGA systems share broad commonalities, even {{specific}} {{models are}} often {{available in a}} broad set of configurations to accommodate a variety of sample, measurement, and environment types. The specifics of our instrument are as follows: The system consists of an open-loop, tap-water fed, water-cooled vertical tube furnace with cylindrical graphite resistive heating element that is enveloped in Ultra High Purity Grade Argon gas. The alumina vertical furnace tube of this Setaram 16 / 18 contains a single platinum heat flux pan with two symmetric pockets for holding cylindrical 100  μL alumina crucibles, one for the sample and one for a reference material. This platinum pan is suspended from an alumina rod attached to an electromagnetically stabilized microbalance. In addition to transferring the load to the balance, the rod contains lead wires for a sample thermocouple and heat flow sensor for measuring the heat flux {{across the bottom of}} the two crucibles. During testing, the current compensated balance holds a sample (mass between 50 and 150  mg) and a reference (77  mg of NIST SRM 720 Sapphire rod) at a fixed height in the furnace so long as the balance is within +/− 200  mg of its zero point. This zero point can be adjusted to accommodate a variety of sample and reference masses via the addition and subtraction of tungsten shot from the counterweight arm of the balance. This entire balance, rod and pan assembly is mounted on a vertical moving linear actuator to enable loading and unloading of the pan outside the furnace tube. The balance environment is pressure sealed and coupled with the sample environment. Thus the sample and balance can be purged at various flow rates with a selectable so called carrier gas. In this work, Ar was used at a flow rate of about 1.5  L per hour to purge the sample. Type S Pt/Pt- 10 %Rh thermocouples were used for the sample temperature, heat flow sensor, and the furnace temperature measurement. While sample and heat flow sensors are integrated into the platinum pan on the DSC, the furnace thermocouple is separate and sits just below the pan {{at the end of an}} alumina rod with a <b>notched</b> <b>disk</b> alumina heat shield just below the exposed thermocouple junction. All thermocouple junctions are bare and as small as practical for maximum rate sensitivity.|$|E
50|$|The coupler {{face has}} a {{protruding}} cone and a matching cup. Inside the cone {{there is a}} rigid metal hoop connected to a revolving, spring-loaded metal <b>disk</b> with a <b>notch</b> on the opposite side. When ready to couple, the spring turns the disk so the hoop is extended from the cone; as the cars meet the hoop enters the cup on the other coupler, stopping against the disk. The hoops are then pressed back into their own coupler, causing the disks to rotate until the notches align with the hoops. After the hoops have entered the <b>notches</b> the <b>disks</b> spring back into the hoop extended position, locking the coupling.

40|$|The {{development}} of new health-monitoring techniques {{requires the use of}} theoretical and experimental tools to allow new concepts to be demonstrated and validated prior to use on more complicated and expensive engine hardware. In order to meet this need, significant upgrades were made to NASA Glenn Research Center s Rotordynamics Laboratory and a series of tests were conducted on simulated turbine engine disks as a means of demonstrating potential crack-detection techniques. The Rotordynamics Laboratory consists of a high-precision spin rig that can rotate subscale engine disks at speeds up to 12, 000 rpm. The crack-detection experiment involved introducing a notch on a subscale engine disk and measuring its vibration response using externally mounted blade-tip-clearance sensors as the disk was operated at speeds up to 12 000 rpm. Testing was accomplished on both a clean baseline disk and a disk with an artificial crack: a 50. 8 -mm- (2 -in. -) long introduced <b>notch.</b> The <b>disk</b> s vibration responses were compared and evaluated against theoretical models to investigate how successful the technique was in detecting cracks.

40|$|Studying {{fracture}} toughness behavior at elevated temperatures and cofining pressures is valuable {{for a number}} of practical situations such as hydraulic fracturing used to enhance oil and gas recovery from a reservoir, and the disposal or safe storage of radioactive waste in underground cavities. Mixed-mode (I-II) {{fracture toughness}} under simulated reservoir conditions of high temperature and confining pressure was studied using straight <b>notched</b> Brazilian <b>disk</b> (SNBD) specimens under diametrical compression. Rock samples were collected from a limestone formation outcropping in the Central Province of Saudi Arabia. Tests were conducted under an effective confining pressure (sigma(3)) Of UP to 28 MPa (4000 psi), and a temperature of up to 116 degrees C. The results show a substantial increase in fracture toughness under confining pressure. The pure mode-I fracture toughness (K-IC) increased by a factor of about 3. 7 under a sigma(3) of 28 MPa compared to that under ambient conditions. The variation of K-IC was found to be linearly proportional to sigma(3) The pure mode-II fracture toughness (K-IIC) increased by a factor of 2. 4 upon increasing sigma(3) to 28 MPa.

This research was carried out in a corn (Zea mays L.) field aiming to evaluate the operational and energetic performance of a no-tillage seeder in two soil types with different vegetable covering and with different forward speeds, furrow opener and cut elements. The performance were evaluated through parameters of seeds longitudinal uniformity distribution, seeding depth, soil mobilized area, tractor and seeder tractive wheel slips, draw bar pull and power requirements, fuel consumption, plantules emergency, culture growing and productivity. The experiments were carried out in two different farms. One at Lageado Experimental Farm, which the soil is classified as Nitossolo Vermelho distroférrico covered with 7 t. ha- 1 of dry matter of corn, lupine and weed residues.

The material was characterized for anisotropic plasticity, fracture initiation for various states of stress, (pre-cracked) fracture toughness and uncracked ductility. The experimental program included tests on flat butterfly-shaped, central hole, <b>notched</b> and circular <b>disk</b> specimens for low stress triaxiality levels; as well as tests on round notched bar specimens and SENT fracture mechanics tests, for high values of stress triaxiality.

Parallel to the experimental study, detailed numerical investigations were carried out to simulate all different experimental tests. Using an inverse method, a 3 -parameter calibration was performed on the Modified Mohr-Coulomb (MMC) fracture model. Subsequently, the predictive capabilities of the MMC were evaluated by the comparison to the fracture toughness tests results, used extensively in the pipeline industry. The capabilities of the MIT fracture model have been demonstrated on an example of high strength offshore steel, X 100.
