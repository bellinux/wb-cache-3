40|$|OBJECTIVE: This study {{aimed to}} verify the {{performance}} of blood transfusion committees in transfusion services linked to the public blood bank network {{of the state of}} Minas Gerais. METHODS: A cross-sectional observational study was conducted between 2007 and 2008 using questionnaires and proficiency tests to evaluate the reporting and <b>investigation</b> <b>of</b> transfusion reactions comparing transfusion services with and without transfusion committees in the public transfusion services of the state of Minas Gerais. RESULTS: Nineteen of Hemominas own transfusion services and 207 that contracted the services of the foundation located in 178 municipalities were visited between 2007 and 2008. Established transfusion committees were present in 63. 4 % of the services visited. Transfusion incidents were reported by 53 (36. 8 %) transfusion services with transfusion committees and by eight (9. 6 %) without transfusion committees (p < 0. 001) with 543 (97. 5 %) and 14 (2. 5 %) <b>notifications,</b> respectively. <b>Of</b> the reported transfusion incidents, 40 (75. 5 %) transfusion services with transfusion committees and only two (25 %) of those without transfusion committees investigated the causes. CONCLUSION: The incidence <b>of</b> <b>notification</b> and <b>investigation</b> <b>of</b> the causes of transfusion reactions was higher in transfusion services where a transfusion committee was present. Despite these results, the performance of these committees was found to be incipient and a better organization and more effective operation are required...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to examine how child {{investigators}} in the police force interpret and apply the <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> preliminary <b>investigation</b> (FuK) and the po-lice act in their child investigative interviews with alleged victims of sexual abuse. Questions at issue were how child investigators relate to FuK 17 - 19 §§, re-garding child investigative interviews and to FuK 16 § and the police act 3 §, re-garding their co-operation with social services. The theory and method used in this study was Sociology of Law. Qualitative interviews were conducted with eight child investigators, one from each police district in Stockholm. The results of the study conclude that despite special qualifications, child investigators may find themselves in difficulty in receiving or interpreting information from chil-dren, therefore they may need to consult a person with expert knowledge. Fur-thermore the results conclude that all of the child investigators with no exception inform the social services when a report to the police is received. Moreover, the results show that child investigators in general are aware of the legislation and re-late in compliance with it. In conclusion, children are given special treatment in relation to adults, in order to place children on equality with them...|$|R

40|$|Objective: This study {{illuminates}} {{the degree of}} psychological stress response experienced by spouses of cancer patients when given bad news at three different times (<b>notification</b> <b>of</b> the name <b>of</b> the disease, <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> recurrence, and <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> terminality) {{as well as the}} factors that influence the response and the health status of the spouse as measured by health-related quality of life (QOL). Methods: A total of 203 individuals (57 men and 146 women) who had received the three types of news were surveyed using a self-report questionnaire on psychological stress response, marital satisfaction, and health-related QOL scales. Results: The degree of the psychological stress response was the highest for <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> terminality, followed by <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> the name of the disease, and <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> recurrence. The influencing factors varied depending on the notification period. Although no significant difference was observed for health-related QOL among the three notification types, significant differences were observed for certain items when compared with national standard values. Conclusions: When a <b>notification</b> <b>of</b> terminality, which produced the highest psychological stress response, is given, providing care that considers health-related QOL is necessary not only for patients but also for their spouses...|$|R
