50|$|Coenagrion hastulatum, the <b>northern</b> <b>damselfly</b> or {{spearhead}} bluet, is a damselfly in {{the family}} Coenagrionidae.|$|E
50|$|An {{inventory}} of dragonflies in the north-eastern {{end of the}} lake documented a presence of red-eyed damselfly, <b>northern</b> <b>damselfly,</b> azure damselfly, brown hawker, club-tailed dragonfly, downy emerald, and four-spotted chaser.|$|E
50|$|Thanks to {{the sparse}} {{population}} of the forest and the filter action of bunter sandstone, many springs and streams in the hills have retained their natural water quality, so that they remain healthy habitats for many species of fish. These include brown trout and brook lamprey and, in calmer waters, minnow, spined loach and stone loach. In larger meadow streams grayling, perch, pike, burbot und various other minnow-like species may be found. Dragonflies, such as the golden-ringed dragonfly and the otherwise rare <b>northern</b> <b>damselfly,</b> may often be seen by streams and ponds.|$|E
40|$|Although {{there is}} much {{theoretical}} and empirical data about the life history responses of time constrained organisms, {{little is known about}} the latitude compensating mechanism that enables northern populations’ developmental rates to compensate for latitude. To investigate the importance of photoperiod on development and growth, I collected adults and raised the offspring of the obligatory univoltine damselfly Lestes sponsa from two populations at different latitudes (53 º N and 63 º N). The offspring were raised in a common laboratory environment at 21 º C and at the two photoperiods corresponding to the sites of collection. Field data showed that adult and egg sizes decreased towards the higher latitude. This adult size difference was a genetically fixed trait since the same size difference between populations was also found when larvae where reared in the laboratory. All studied individuals expressed shorter development time and faster growth rates under northern photoperiod regimes. <b>Northern</b> <b>damselflies</b> showed fixed body size and mass at emergence despite being reared at different photoperiod conditions. Similarly, southern individuals kept body size at emergence constant at both photoregimes, but overcompensated shorter development time in the northern photoregime by gaining higher body mass than in original,southern photoregime. There was no difference in hatching synchronisation between larvae from the south and the north. I found evidence of higher synchrony at adult emergence among northern individuals. The previous investigation of L. sponsa phenology in natural conditions together with these laboratory results indicate the presence of the latitude compensating mechanism that is triggered by a response to photoperiod. A positive correlation between photoperiod and developmental rate in this damselfly, and probably in many other temperate insect species, might be adaptive since it optimises the life history stage transitions and body size/mass at each latitude...|$|R
50|$|Fry {{of smooth}} newt was {{reported}} in 2000, the only amphibian reported by the lake. An inventory of damselflies in 1997 resulted in a list of emerald damselfly, red-eyed damselfly, variable damselfly, southern hawker, brilliant emerald, four-spotted chaser, eastern white-faced darter, and black darter. A second inventory in 2000 produced the following list interpreted as a normal amount of species: common hawker, brown hawker, Irish damselfly, variable damselfly, downy emerald, red-eyed <b>damselfly,</b> <b>northern</b> white-faced darter, brilliant emerald, and black darter.|$|R
50|$|The sparse fauna {{before the}} {{dredging}} of the lake, after 1995 {{evolved into a}} pretty considerable variety of species typical for shallow lakes rich in nutrients. Two species of freshwater snails, Bithynia leachii and Gyraulus crista, were earlier considered as endangered. Noteworthy is also the population of several freshwater mussels, duck mussel and swan mussel, and Hippeutis complanatus, the latter two declining. A species of Oligochaeta new in Sweden {{has been reported in}} the lake just like did the rare hairy dragonfly. An inventory of dragonfly larvae in 2000 unveiled several other species (mostly red-eyed damselfly but also common blue damselfly, azure damselfly, variable damselfly, and <b>northern</b> <b>damselfly</b> (Coenagrion hastulatum). Fish population reflects the shortage of oxygen with an absence of carp bream and silver bream and an abundance of perch, roach, and crucian carp dating back to before the dredging. The outlet forms a threshold for migrating species.|$|E
40|$|The {{status of}} the <b>northern</b> <b>damselfly</b> Coenagrion hastulatum in the Netherlands, a {{characteristic}} dragonfly of non-disturbed shallow lakes (Odonata) The <b>northern</b> <b>damselfly</b> Coenagrion hastulatum is a rare and endangered dragonfly in The Netherlands. In the period 1998 - 2001 extensive research had been conducted {{on the distribution of}} this species in the Netherlands. Old and new data are collated for the first time, and an overview of all current populations is presented. Coenagrion hastulatum now has 16 populations left, in the southern and eastern parts of The Netherlands. The species disappeared from seven sites in the period 1980 - 2000. Incidental records of wandering individuals give circumstantial evidence that C. hastulatum can migrate over at least 2 kilometres distance...|$|E
40|$|Background: Latitudinal clines in {{temperature}} and seasonality impose strong seasonal constraints on ectotherms. Studies of population differentiation in phenotypic plasticity of life history traits along latitudinal gradients {{are important for}} understanding how organisms have adapted to seasonal environments and predict how they respond to climate changes. Such studies have been scarce for species with a northern distribution. Methodology/Principle Finding: Larvae of the <b>northern</b> <b>damselfly</b> Coenagrion johanssoni originating from semivoltine central, partivoltine northern, and partivoltine northernmost Swedish populations were reared in the laboratory. To investigate whether larvae use photoperiodic cues to induce compensatory growth along this latitudinal gradient, larvae were reared under two different photoperiods corresponding to a northern and southern latitude. In addition, field adult size was assessed to test the strength of possible compensatory growth mechanisms under natural conditions and hatchling size was measured to test for maternal effects. We hypothesized that populations originating from lower latitudes would be more time constrained than high-latitude populations {{because they have a}} shorter life cycle. The results showed that low-latitude populations had higher growth rates in summer/fall. In general northern photoperiods induced higher growth rates, but this plastic response to photoperiod was strongest in the southernmost populations and negligible in the northernmost population. During spring, central populations grew faster under the southern rather than the norther...|$|E
40|$|This thesis characterises species {{richness}} and community structure over a habitat-patch size gradient {{of a typical}} bog-pool complex, investigating the effect of pool size on aquatic invertebrate communities. In this study, twenty-two pools were surveyed ranging in area from 8. 6 m 2 to 280. 9 m 2 within a single complex at Forsinard {{in the north of}} Scotland. Three different sampling methods were used: baited and unbaited activity traps and a sediment sampler. Univariate and multivariate methods were used to investigate the effects of pool size and pool location within the complex on {{species richness}} and community structure. The research expands our knowledge of peatland pool invertebrates by providing a comprehensive survey of the aquatic invertebrate fauna representative of the Flow Country of northern Scotland. Two IUCN British Red Data Book species were recorded: the <b>Northern</b> <b>Damselfly,</b> Coenagrion hastulatum (Charpentier), and the cased caddisfly, Nemotaulius punctatolineatus (Retzius). Three species of aquatic Coleoptera were collected that have Nationally Notable status according to Ball (1986) : Dytiscus lapponicus Gyllenhal, Ilybius aenescens Thomson and Gyrinus minutus Fabricius. All these species are typical of, and often restricted to, this habitat type. The three different sampling methods differed in their sampling efficiency and each gave a different species spectrum. A distinct seasonal change in the samples was also observed. The number of taxa caught per standardised sampling unit (taxon density) was investigated over the pool size gradient. Relationships between taxon density and area were weak or non-existent in both unbaited activity traps and sediment samples. However, the number of beetle species caught in baited activity traps increased significantly with pool size, indicating that the total number of beetle species per pool may also increase over the size gradient. Ratios of the number of predator taxa to prey (non-predator) taxa for each pool ranged from 0. 34 to 0. 78 with a mean of 0. 49 and were not affected by pool area or total taxonomic richness. Taxa displayed a positive abundance-occupancy relationship and the possible underlying mechanisms involved in creating this pattern are discussed. Multivariate techniques showed that pool area, depth, and distance from the centre of the pool complex (periferality) all had a small but significant affect on community composition and that between certain taxa there were distinctly different optima along the pool size gradient. These results are discussed in the context of species area theory...|$|E
