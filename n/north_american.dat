However, fighting is frequently punishable by ejection in European leagues, and in Olympic competition.|$|E
5|$|A <b>North</b> <b>American</b> {{localization}} was hinted on Namco Bandai Games' Facebook page by {{a puzzle}} on January 24, 2011. When solved, the puzzle reveals a URL to a distorted image which was restored on February 2, 2011 and reveals Tales of Graces fs localization for North America. On May 11, 2011, Namco officially announced the <b>North</b> <b>American,</b> EMEA and Asia-Pacific localization of Tales of Graces f. The text was translated by 8-4 while Cup of Tea Productions produced the dubbing. The <b>North</b> <b>American</b> localization {{was released on}} March 13, 2012. The EMEA and Asia-Pacific localization released on August 31, 2012 along with a day one special edition. The game was made available on the <b>North</b> <b>American</b> and European PlayStation Network in March 2013.|$|E

5|$|Another major {{difference}} between Tarbosaurus and its <b>North</b> <b>American</b> relatives was its more rigid mandible (lower jaw). While many theropods, including <b>North</b> <b>American</b> tyrannosaurids, had some degree of flexibility between the bones {{in the rear of}} the mandible and the dentary in the front, Tarbosaurus had a locking mechanism formed from a ridge on the surface of the angular, which articulated with a square process on the rear of the dentary.|$|E

Similar pairings performed between <b>North</b> <b>American</b> and European collections showed the species to be incompatible, and therefore distinct.|$|E

50|$|In {{a classic}} study, {{researchers}} analyzed {{the effects of}} ageism among the elderly. They performed memory tests on the three selected groups: residents of China, deaf <b>North</b> <b>Americans,</b> and hearing <b>North</b> <b>Americans.</b> In the three groups, the Chinese residents were presumably the least exposed to ageism, with lifelong experience {{in a culture that}} traditionally venerates older generations. Lifelong deaf <b>North</b> <b>Americans</b> also faced less exposure to ageism in contrast to those with typical hearing, who presumably had heard ageist comments their whole life. The results of the memory tests showed that ageism has significant effects on memory.|$|R

5|$|<b>North</b> <b>American</b> red foxes, {{particularly}} those of northern Alaska, are the most valued for their fur, as they have guard hairs of a silky texture, which, after dressing, allow the wearer unrestricted mobility.

Most European peltries have coarse-textured fur compared to <b>North</b> <b>American</b> varieties.

5|$|Since Ankylosaurus {{and other}} Late Cretaceous <b>North</b> <b>American</b> ankylosaurids grouped with Asian genera (in a tribe the authors named Ankylosaurini), Arbour and Currie {{suggested}} that earlier <b>North</b> <b>American</b> ankylosaurids had gone extinct {{by the late}} Albian or Cenomanian ages of the Middle Cretaceous. Ankylosaurids thereafter recolonised North America from Asia during the Campanian or Turonian ages of the Late Cretaceous, and diversified there again, leading to genera such as Ankylosaurus, Anodontosaurus, and Euoplocephalus. This explains a 30 million year gap in the fossil record of <b>North</b> <b>American</b> ankylosaurids between these ages.|$|E
