5|$|Bonhoeffer et al. {{suggested}} that template switching by the reverse transcriptase {{acts as a}} repair process to deal with breaks in the ssRNA genome. In addition, Hu and Temin {{suggested that}} recombination is an adaptation for repair of damage in the RNA genomes. Strand switching (copy-choice recombination) by reverse transcriptase could generate an undamaged copy of genomic DNA from two damaged ssRNA genome copies. This view of the adaptive benefit of recombination in HIV could explain why each HIV particle contains two complete genomes, rather than one. Furthermore, the view that recombination is a repair process implies that the benefit of repair can occur at each replication cycle, and that this benefit can be realized {{whether or not the}} two genomes differ genetically. On the view that that recombination in HIV is a repair process, the generation of recombinational variation would be a consequence, but <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of,</b> the evolution of template switching.|$|E
5|$|Though {{at first}} Silver stalks Sonic and impedes his {{attempts}} to save Elise, Shadow reveals to him that Sonic is <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> his world's suffering but rather Mephiles, {{who is trying to}} erase the past for his own evil purposes. Throughout the story, Sonic and friends travel between the past, present, and future in their efforts to stop Mephiles and Iblis and protect Elise from Doctor Eggman. They learn that Mephiles seeks to bond with Iblis, as they are the two halves of Soleanna's omnipotent god, Solaris. Mephiles succeeds, but Sonic, Shadow, and Silver use the power of the Chaos Emeralds to transform into their super forms and defeat Solaris.|$|E
5|$|When {{the first}} Black Hebrews arrived in Israel in 1969, they claimed {{citizenship}} under the Law of Return, which gives eligible Jews immediate citizenship. The Israeli government ruled in 1973 {{that the group}} did not qualify for automatic citizenship {{because they could not}} prove Jewish descent and had not undergone Orthodox conversion. The Black Hebrews were denied work permits and state benefits. The group accused the Israeli government of racist discrimination. In 1981, a group of American civil rights activists led by Bayard Rustin investigated and concluded that racism was <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> the Black Hebrews' situation. No official action was taken to return the Black Hebrews to the United States, but some individual members were deported for working illegally.|$|E

5|$|White never {{remarried}} {{following his}} wife's death in 1915. In addition to White's church activities, {{he served as}} a master of the Masonic Lodge, and was affiliated with the Odd Fellows. Beginning in 1934, White endured 18 months of illness, and on August 14, 1935, his physician Dr. R. W. Dailey reported to the Cumberland Evening Times that he was in critical condition and was unlikely to recover. White succumbed to his illness and died at his residence in Romney on August 15, 1935 at the age of 59 as a result of arteriosclerosis. Myocarditis also contributed to his prolonged illness but was <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> his death. White was interred with Masonic rites on Saturday afternoon, August 17, 1935 at Indian Mound Cemetery in Romney. A number of state officials attended his funeral.|$|E

25|$|HIV/AIDS denialism is the belief, {{contradicted by}} {{conclusive}} medical and scientific evidence, that {{human immunodeficiency virus}} (HIV) does not cause acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). Some of its proponents reject the existence of HIV, while others accept that HIV exists but {{argue that it is}} a harmless passenger virus and <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> AIDS. Insofar as they acknowledge AIDS as a real disease, they attribute it to some combination of sexual behavior, recreational drugs, malnutrition, poor sanitation, haemophilia, or the effects of the drugs used to treat HIV infection.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} with the biblical account of the Fall, in Islamic tradition Eve (Ḥawwā) did not tempt Adam (Ādam) to eat the forbidden fruit; instead, they were tempted together by the Devil. This means that Eve was <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> Adam's expulsion from paradise: he was also responsible, and therefore {{both men and women}} are faced equally with its consequences. This has a number of important implications for the Islamic understanding of womanhood and women's roles in both religious and social life. For one, in Islam, women are not seen as a source of evil {{as a result of the}} Fall.|$|E
25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 16th century, women were sexually stimulated by midwives in order to relieve their symptoms. Gerolamo Cardano and Giambattista della Porta believed that polluted water and fumes caused the symptoms of hysteria. Towards the end of the century, however, the role of the uterus was no longer thought central to the disorder, with Thomas Willis discovering that the brain and central nervous system were the cause of the symptoms. Thomas Sydenham argued that the symptoms of hysteria may have an organic cause. He also proved that the uterus is <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> symptom.|$|E

25|$|On January 20, the NTSB {{declared}} that overvoltage was <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> the Boston incident, as voltage did {{not exceed the}} battery limit of 32 V, and the charging unit passed tests. The battery had signs of short circuiting and thermal runaway. Despite this, by January 24, the NTSB had not yet pinpointed {{the cause of the}} Boston fire; the FAA would not allow U.S.-based 787s to fly again until the problem was found and corrected. In a press briefing that day, NTSB Chairwoman Deborah Hersman said that the NTSB had found evidence of failure of multiple safety systems designed to prevent these battery problems, and stated that fire must never happen on an airplane.|$|E
25|$|The {{hip joint}} {{is unique in}} that it {{experiences}} combined mechanical loads. An axial load along the shaft of the femur results in compressive stress. Bending load at {{the neck of the}} femur causes tensile stress along {{the upper part of the}} neck and compressive stress along the lower part of the neck. While osteoarthritis and osteoporosis are associated with bone fracture as we age, these diseases are <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> the fracture alone. Low energy falls from standing are responsible for the majority of fractures in the elderly, but fall direction is also a key factor. Elderly tend to fall to the side as instead of forward, and the lateral hip and strikes the ground first. During a sideways fall, the chances of hip fracture see a 15-fold and 12-fold increase in elderly males and females, respectively.|$|E
25|$|Episodes of RMD are short, lasting between 3 and 130 seconds. Rare {{cases of}} {{constant}} RMD {{can last for}} hours. The majority of RMD episodes usually occur just before or during sleep. Some cases have been reported on rhythmic movements during wakeful activities like driving. When occurring in sleep, RMD episodes {{are more likely to}} onset during non-REM, stage 2 sleep. Roughly 46% of sleep-RMD episodes occur only in non-REM sleep; 30% in non-REM and REM; and only 24% strictly in REM sleep. Most patients are unresponsive during an episode and are unlikely to remember the movements occurring upon awakening. In some patients who also experience sleep apnea, episodes of apnea can be followed immediately by RMD-like symptoms, suggesting that the apnea episodes may trigger an RMD episode. Similarly, current studies suggest that external stimuli are <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> <b>of</b> RMD episodes.|$|E

5|$|Epiphenomenalism is a {{doctrine}} first formulated by Thomas Henry Huxley.

Physical events can cause other physical events and physical events can cause mental events, but mental events cannot cause anything, since they are just causally inert by-products (i.e. epiphenomena) of the physical world.
