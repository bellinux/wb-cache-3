The liberalization of service imports (including through direct investment) will generate benefits through higher quality, lower prices, and better access mainly if competition among suppliers is enhanced. This is typically the case for producer services, such as domestic and international transport, financial services, and telecommunications. By contrast, the rationale for import liberalization is less clear for consumer or infrastructure services with <b>network</b> <b>monopolies</b> (such as water or energy distribution) or when demand is constrained by poverty (health care, education). In such cases, carefully calibrated government policies, possibly with international donor support, {{may be required to}} achieve a socially optimal level of supply. Finally, most service exports by developing countries face few import barriers in industrialized countries. However, under the GATS, service exports could also be delivered through temporary movement of natural persons.

40|$|The main {{objective}} of antitrust interventions is to assure competition in markets to benefit consumers.

It is then analyzed in the framework of the canonical model for two-sided markets developed by Rochet & Tirole (2004). The main finding is that the satellite network maximizes his profits by choosing a price formation which maximizes the overall welfare of all market participants. Even if the satellite <b>network</b> uses his <b>monopoly</b> power to introduce a fee to receive satellite TV, it would do so only until the semi-elasticity of the amount of consumers in regard to the per-interaction-price equals the one of the TV stations – exactly the point where welfare is maximized.

40|$|Until {{today the}} European Union has {{followed}} a service-based approach towards liberalizing telecommunications markets. This policy will {{be accomplished by}} liberalizing voice telephony in 1998.

Many are now in a process of privatization and of reviewing the <b>network</b> <b>monopoly</b> of their national telecommunications organizations. Rapid technological change, the experience of network competition in other countries and regulatory reform at the member state level make it necessary to develop a Community policy towards telecommunications infrastructure. This will be done in a Green Paper on infrastructure by the European Commission due in early 1995. After briefly reviewing the European Union's telecommunications policy to date, this article discusses the benefits which may arise from a policy of infrastructure liberalization at the Community level. It is argued that only by introducing competition between network operators can the benefits of the Community's service-based approach be fully reaped. ...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIt is puzzling {{today to}} explain {{diversity}} and imperfection of actual transmission monopoly designs in competitive electricity markets. We argue that transmission monopoly in competitive electricity markets {{has to be}} analysed within a Wilson (2002) modular framework. Applied to the management of electricity flows, at least three modules make the core of transmission design: 1 ° the short run management of network externalities; 2 ° the long run management of network investment; and 3 ° the coordination of neighboring Transmission System Operators for cross border trade. In order to tackle this diversity of designs of TSOs, we show that {{for each of these}} modules, three different basic ways of managing them are possible. Among the identified twenty seven options of organisation, we define an Ideal TSO. Second, we demonstrate that 1 °monopoly design differs from this Ideal TSO and cannot handle these three modules irrespective of the “institutional” definition and allocation of property rights on transmission; while 2 °definition and allocation of property rights on transmission cannot ignore the existing electrical industry and transmission network structure: they have to complement each other to be efficient.

Results suggest that operators of electronic capacity markets face severe difficulties in motivating major carriers to participate in the market. Former transmission <b>network</b> <b>monopoly</b> holders are particularly reluctant to participate in electronic carrier capacity market places. Incumbents fear that their participation could accelerate the decline of transport capacity prices.

40|$|Several {{developments}} {{in international trade}} in services impact strongly on developing countries: First, the world-wide diffusion of information technologies (IT) has created new export opportunities for developing countries in IT services. Second, the recently proclaimed Millennium Development Goals for poverty reduction can only be attained if key services are provided more efficiently in developing countries - particularly through the liberalization of service imports. Third, in the ongoing Doha Development Round (DR) of trade negotiations, developing countries are asked to formally commit to liberalizing their service imports {{under the terms of}} the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS). Developing countries will benefit from liberalizing service imports if liberalization enhances competition on the supply side. This is typically the case for producer services, such as domestic and international transport, financial services, and telecommunications. The lifting of restrictions on the market access by foreigners (including through direct investment) will often improve service quality or lower prices and thereby enhance the international competitiveness of downstream industries. In Doha Development Round negotiations, therefore, developing countries may find it useful to commit to liberalizing imports of producer services. By contrast, the benefits of import liberalization are less clear for some consumer services where supply is subject to <b>network</b> <b>monopolies</b> (e. g., water and energy distribution) or demand is constrained by poverty (health care, education). Here, achieving a socially optimal level of supply may require carefully calibrated government policies, possibly with international donor support. For developing countries, such sectors should not be priority areas for commitments on service imports under the GATS. Most service exports by developing countries, especially IT services transmitted electronically, face few import barriers in industrialized countries. However, under the GATS, service exports may also be delivered through temporary movement of natural persons, e. g., developing country nationals working in industrialized countries without becoming residents there. If Doha Development Round negotiations were to increase opportunities for such temporary labor migration, the benefits to developing countries could be huge. [...] ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} how competition among payment card networks three-party scheme networks and four-party scheme networks affects pricing {{as well as}} the welfare of various parties. A competing network has an incentive to provide rewards to its card users. By providing more generous rewards than its rival networks, the network can increase its own card transactions because multihoming cardholders who hold multiple networks cards choose to use its card instead of using its rivals. Although a <b>monopoly</b> <b>network</b> does not have such an incentive, in a <b>monopoly</b> four-party scheme <b>network,</b> competition among card issuers likely makes issuers provide rewards. Due to rewards, the merchant fees under competition can be higher than the merchant fees set by a <b>monopoly</b> <b>network,</b> unless the majority of cardholders are multihoming. Generally, cardholding consumers are better off under network competition. In contrast, non-cardholding consumers are better off only when network competition reduces merchant fees lower than those under monopoly. The results suggest that policies that simply encourage network competition will likely increase cardholder rewards but will not necessarily lower merchant fees in the U. S. payment card market.
