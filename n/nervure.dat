2500|$|Due to its ethnic {{diversity}} {{and the existence}} of different languages and religious observations (Sunni and Shi'a), the musical tradition of Khorasan is very rich. From the north to the south, the music scene varies greatly. In the north of Khorasan, one can find the bakhshi narrating and singing, among other things, [...] "daastans" [...] (stories in old Persian), although they can also sing in Kurdish about the historical deeds of local figures. They accompany themselves on the dotar. A leading exponent of this type is the late Haj Ghorban Soleimani. One can also find in the north, the Asheq who play [...] "dohol" [...] (double-faced drum), the [...] "sorna" [...] (a kind of oboe-like reed instrument) and the [...] "qoshme" [...] (double clarinet made of the central <b>nervure</b> of the plumage of birds tied together). The Asheq are specifically associated with the Kurds and play at wedding dances and village feasts. In the East of Khorasan, near Torbat Jam, the main instrument is the dotar with some modifications, but there are no Bakhshi and the music is different. Here, the music takes the form of [...] "ghazal khani'" [...] and is performed by singers of quatrains and [...] "ghazals" [...] – lyric poems based on the invocations of mystic poets like Rumi, Attar and Sheikh Ahmad Jami. Purely instrumental pieces also figure in the repertoire.|$|E

The fore wing is typically without markings, in some specimens with a patch of sulphur-yellow {{on either side of}} base of median <b>nervure,</b> in the very yellow examples the tornal area is often widely greenish white, in others (Catopsilia catilla, Cramer) it bears a spot variable in size on the discocellulars. This spot has a pearly centre and an outer reddish line. Many specimens have an irregular angulated narrow discal reddish line (the colour varies in intensity) that runs from the costa obliquely outwards to vein 7, and then obliquely inwards to vein 2, though this line is often absent in specimens that bear the discocellular spot; apex and termen sometimes very narrowly reddish. The hind wing is typically uniform, without markings; in var. catilla there is a single small spot {{at the end of the}} cell similar to that on the fore wing, sometimes this spot is much larger with a narrow outer reddish ring, sometimes it is accompanied by a similar spot at base of interspace 5; when two spots are present they may be entirely separate, or their outer rings may coalesce; again, some specimens have a highly irregular discal reddish line (often reduced to a series of minute spots) that extends from the costa to vein 1; finally, the majority of specimens have a series of minute red terminal dots at the apices of the veins." ...|$|E

60|$|In {{the three}} Families the sounds are {{differently}} produced. In the males Of the Achetidæ both wing-covers {{have the same}} structure; and this in the field-cricket (Gryllus campestris, fig. 10) consists, as described by Landois,[458] of from 131 to 138 sharp, transverse ridges or teeth (st) on the under side {{of one of the}} nervures of the wing-cover. This toothed <b>nervure</b> is rapidly scraped across a projecting, smooth, hard <b>nervure</b> (r) on the upper surface of the opposite wing. First one wing is rubbed over the other, and then the movement is reversed. Both wings are raised a little at the same time, so as to increase the resonance. In some species the wing-covers of the males are furnished at the base with a talc-like plate.[459] I have here given a drawing (fig. 11) of the teeth on the under side of the <b>nervure</b> of another species of Gryllus, viz.

I here give a drawing (Fig. 12) of the teeth on the under side of the <b>nervure</b> of another species of Gryllus, viz., G. domesticus. With respect to the formation of these teeth, Dr. Gruber has shewn (36. 'Ueber der Tonapparat der Locustiden, ein Beitrag zum Darwinismus,' 'Zeitschrift fur wissenschaft. Zoolog.' B. xxii. 1872, p. 100.) that they have been developed by the aid of selection, from the minute scales and hairs with which the wings and body are covered, and I came to the same conclusion with respect to those of the Coleoptera. But Dr. Gruber further shews that their development is in part directly due to the stimulus from the friction of one wing over the other.|$|E
6000|$|In the Locustidae the {{opposite}} wing-covers differ {{from each other}} in structure (Fig. 13), and the action cannot, as in the last family, be reversed. The left wing, which acts as the bow, lies over the right wing which serves as the fiddle. One of the nervures (a) on the under surface of the former is finely serrated, and is scraped across the prominent nervures on the upper surface of {{the opposite}} or right wing. In our British Phasgonura viridissima it appeared to me that the serrated <b>nervure</b> is rubbed against the rounded hind-corner of the opposite wing, the edge of which is thickened, coloured brown, and very sharp. In the right wing, but not in the left, there is a little plate, as transparent as talc, surrounded by nervures, and called the speculum. In Ephippiger vitium, a member of this same family, we have a curious subordinate modification; for the wing-covers are greatly reduced in size, but [...] "the posterior part of the pro-thorax is elevated into a kind of dome over the wing-covers, and which has probably the effect of increasing the sound."
