5|$|The World Series {{started on}} a Tuesday for the second {{straight}} year, instead of a Wednesday as in the past. The practice was to avoid games on Thursday and Monday nights, generally big days of television viewing, where Fox's telecast would face stiff competition from Thursday <b>Night</b> <b>Football,</b> ESPN College Football Thursday Primetime, various popular primetime entertainment shows, and Monday <b>Night</b> <b>Football.</b>|$|E

50|$|After {{a disappointing}} season in 2005, Coles enjoyed a rebirth in 2006, {{directly}} {{due to the}} good health of quarterback, Chad Pennington. On December 26, 2005, he caught the last touchdown in Monday <b>Night</b> <b>Footballs</b> last game on ABC. Coles was released by the Jets on February 25, 2009.|$|R
5|$|Game 5 went {{head-to-head}} with an NBC Sunday <b>Night</b> <b>Football</b> {{game between}} the Green Bay Packers and Denver Broncos, {{both of which were}} previously unbeaten. Media sources like Sporting News predicted that this heavy competition would result in series-low ratings. While the football game drew the larger audience, the Royals and Mets did average a 10.0 rating, the highest for a World Series Game 5 since 2003.|$|E

5|$|The Colts {{suffered}} their largest {{margin of}} defeat, 34–14, against the Green Bay Packers the following week. Manning threw two interceptions that were returned for touchdowns (for {{the second time}} in his career; the first was on September 30, 2001 against the New England Patriots). The next week the Colts went into Tennessee on Monday <b>Night</b> <b>Football</b> to face the 6–0 Titans. They led 14–6 in the third quarter, but Tennessee scored 25 unanswered for a 31–21 victory and almost assured the Colts they would not win the AFC South division title {{for the first time in}} six seasons. At 3–4, the Colts opened up November with their annual showdown against the New England Patriots on Sunday <b>Night</b> <b>Football.</b> Tied at 15 in the 4th quarter, Manning set up Adam Vinatieri for a 52-yard field goal that proved to be the winning points in an 18–15 victory. Manning completed 21-of-29 passes for 254 yards, 2 touchdowns and no interceptions. The Colts were 4–4 halfway through the season and still alive in the AFC playoff race.|$|E

The two shows merged in 2006, but there was some {{criticism}} by viewers that Sports Tonight was not long enough and that it should have remained the same.

5|$|AFL teams won {{the next}} two Super Bowls, and in 1970, the two leagues merged {{to form a new}} 26-team league. The {{resulting}} newly expanded NFL eventually incorporated some of the innovations that led to the AFL's success, such as including names on player's jerseys, official scoreboard clocks, national television contracts (the addition of Monday <b>Night</b> <b>Football</b> gave the NFL broadcast rights on all of the Big Three television networks), and sharing of gate and broadcasting revenues between home and visiting teams.|$|E
5|$|After several disappointing seasons, Coughlin {{retired after}} the end of the 2015 season as head coach and {{replaced}} with previous offensive coordinator Ben McAdoo. McAdoo brought the Giants to an 11-5 record and their first playoff berth since 2011 with a much improved defense (despite a mediocre offense). He was the first Giants coach since Jim Fassel in 1997 to bring them to the playoffs in his first year as head coach. On December 11, 2016, during a Sunday <b>Night</b> <b>Football</b> game against the Dallas Cowboys, McAdoo was fined $200,000 for illegally using a walkie talkie on the field.|$|E
50|$|The head of ABCs {{televised}} sports, Roone Arledge, {{made sure}} that Monday <b>Night</b> <b>Footballs</b> inaugural game on September 21, 1970 featured Namath.

The Jets set a team record for penalties and lost on a late Namath interception.|$|R

5|$|In an {{improvement}} over the previous four episodes, the episode was viewed in 8.48 million homes in its original airing, according to Nielsen ratings, despite airing simultaneously with Sunday <b>Night</b> <b>Football,</b> the television movie A Dog Named Christmas on CBS and Desperate Housewives on ABC.
