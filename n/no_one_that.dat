25|$|Thirty-five years later, Babette Hersant (Stéphane Audran) {{appears at}} their door. She carries only {{a letter from}} Papin, {{explaining}} {{that she is a}} refugee from counter-revolutionary bloodshed in Paris, and recommending her as a housekeeper. The sisters cannot afford to take Babette in, but she offers to work for free. Babette serves as their cook for the next 14 years, producing an improved version of the bland meals typical of the abstemious nature of the congregation, and slowly gaining their respect. Her only link to her former life is a lottery ticket that a friend in Paris renews for her every year. One day, she wins the lottery of 10,000 francs. Instead of using the money to return to Paris and her lost lifestyle, she decides to spend it preparing a delicious dinner for the sisters and their small congregation {{on the occasion of the}} founding pastor's hundredth birthday. More than just a feast, the meal is an outpouring of Babette's appreciation, an act of self-sacrifice; Babette tells <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> she is spending her entire winnings on the meal.|$|E
500|$|Rothbard's The Libertarian Forum {{blamed the}} Middle East {{conflict}} on Israeli aggression [...] "fueled by American arms and money." [...] Rothbard {{warned that the}} mid-East conflict would draw the U.S. into a world war. He was anti-Zionist and [...] opposed U.S. involvement in the Middle East. Rothbard criticized the Camp David Accords for having betrayed Palestinian aspirations and opposed Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon. In his essay, [...] "War Guilt in the Middle East," [...] Rothbard states that Israel refused [...] "to let these refugees return and reclaim the property taken from them." [...] He took negative views of the two state solution for the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, saying: On the one hand there are the Palestinian Arabs, who have tilled the soil or otherwise used the land of Palestine for centuries; and on the other, there are a group of external fanatics, who {{come from all over}} the world, and who claim the entire land area as [...] "given" [...] to them as a collective religion or tribe at some remote or legendary time in the past. There is no way the two claims can be resolved to the satisfaction of both parties. There can be no genuine settlement, no [...] "peace" [...] in the face of this irrepressible conflict; there can only be either a war to the death, or an uneasy practical compromise which can satisfy <b>no</b> <b>one.</b> <b>That</b> is the harsh reality of the Middle East.|$|E
2500|$|Conrad and {{the others}} were given auditions, but they were little more than token efforts—especially in Conrad's case, due to his obesity. However, Meston was kept as the main writer. In the early years, a {{majority}} of the TV episodes were adapted from the radio scripts, often using identical scenes and dialogue. Dunning wrote, [...] "That radio fans considered the TV show a sham and its players impostors should surprise <b>no</b> <b>one.</b> <b>That</b> the TV show was not a sham is due in no small part to the continued strength of Meston's scripts." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{translator}} {{and author}} Thomas Cooke also gave Tate's version his blessing: {{in the introduction}} to his own play The Triumphs of Love and Honour (1731), he commented that Lear and Gloucester [...] "are made sensible or their Errors, and are placed in a State of Tranquility and Ease agreeable to their Age and Condition [...] [...] [...] rejoicing in the Felicity of Edgar and Cordelia." [...] Cooke added that he had [...] "read many Sermons, but remember <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> contains so fine a Lesson of Morality as this Play." ...|$|E
2500|$|President Erdoğan {{has said}} that the marchers are {{supporting}} terrorism: [...] "If you are launching a march for terrorists and for their supporters, something which you have never thought about doing against terrorist groups, you can convince <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> your aim is justice." [...] He said that the opposition party's actions exceeded the scope of political opposition and said that they were [...] "acting with terrorist organisations and the forces inciting them against our country". Erdoğan likened the march to the coup attempt: [...] "The coup soldiers had their F-16s and tanks; Kılıçdaroğlu has his march." ...|$|E
2500|$|During the inquest into Kopechne's death, Kennedy {{testified that}} he left the party at [...] "approximately 11:15 p.m." [...] When he {{announced}} {{that he was about to}} leave, Kopechne told him [...] "that she was desirous of leaving, if I would be kind enough to drop her back at her hotel." [...] Kennedy then requested the keys to his mother's car from his chauffeur, Crimmins. Asked why he did not have his chauffeur drive them both, Kennedy explained that Crimmins and some other guests [...] "were concluding their meal, enjoying the fellowship and it didn't appear to me necessary to require him to bring me back to Edgartown." [...] Kopechne told <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> she was leaving with Kennedy, and left her purse and hotel key at the party.|$|E

2500|$|The contests, too, were an illusion. Útgarða-Loki {{reveals that}} Loki had {{actually}} competed against wildfire itself (Logi, Old Norse [...] "flame"), Þjálfi had raced against thought (Hugi, Old Norse [...] "thought"), Thor's drinking horn had actually reached {{to the ocean}} and with his drinks he lowered the ocean level (resulting in tides). The cat that Thor attempted to lift was in actuality the world serpent, Jörmungandr, and everyone was terrified when Thor was able to lift the paw of this [...] "cat", for Thor had actually held the great serpent up to the sky. The old woman Thor wrestled was in fact old age (Elli, Old Norse [...] "old age"), and there is <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> old age cannot bring down. Útgarða-Loki tells Thor {{that it would be}} better for [...] "both sides" [...] if they did not meet again. Upon hearing this, Thor takes hold of his hammer and swings it at Útgarða-Loki but he is gone and so is his castle. Only a wide landscape remains.|$|E
