For elections, it was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> of who received the most votes, but rather who could first be approved {{by a majority of}} the voting blocs. All votes had to be completed within a single day and had to be done again if interrupted or abandoned.|$|E

5|$|Historians see {{the growing}} Roman {{influence}} over the east, as with the west, as <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> of intentional empire-building, but constant crisis management narrowly focused on short-term goals within a highly unstable, unpredictable, and inter-dependent network of alliances and dependencies. With some major exceptions of outright military rule, the Roman Republic remained an alliance of independent city-states and kingdoms (with varying degrees of independence, both de jure and de facto) until it transitioned into the Roman Empire. It {{was not until the}} time of the Roman Empire that the entire Roman world was organized into provinces under explicit Roman control.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{the rulers}} of Europe {{considered}} the 1789 revolution in France as an affair between the French king and his subjects, and <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> in which they should interfere. However, as the rhetoric grew more strident after 1790, the European monarchs began to view the French upheavals with alarm. Among the concerned monarchs were the Holy Roman Emperor Leopold II, who feared for the life and well-being of his sister, the Queen of France, Marie Antoinette. In August 1791, in consultation with French émigré nobles and Frederick William II of Prussia, he issued the Declaration of Pillnitz, in which they declared {{the interest of the}} monarchs of Europe as one with the interests of Louis XVI and his family. They threatened ambiguous, but quite serious, consequences if anything should happen to the royal family.|$|E

5|$|The {{suspension}} {{order of}} Nagpal was challenged in the Allahabad High Court on 30 July 2013 through a Public interest litigation (PIL). The petition was filed by social activist Nutan Thakur at the Lucknow bench of the court. It also requested {{the court to}} direct the central government to ask the state governments to prevent harassment of those officers who have ordered action against illegal construction of religious places, and illegal mining. On 1 August, {{the court ruled that}} the suspension is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> of a PIL, and the officer should directly approach the court. It however praised her work in preventing illegal sand mining and ordered both the central and the state government to report how they are tackling illegal mining and what security is being provided to the officers engaged in stopping it.|$|E
5|$|The {{hearing was}} at last held in November, with a verdict {{expected}} in January 2012. This, however, was also {{subject to a}} delay. Finally, on 6 February 2012, the court spoke, overturning the Spanish federation's decision to clear Contador and assessing the rider a backdated two-year ban, from the date of his adverse test at the 2010 Tour de France. The backdated ban meant any results obtained {{from the time of}} that test to the time the court announced its verdict were to be vacated and awarded in turn to previously second-placed riders. This effectively made Michele Scarponi the new Giro champion and points winner, and it made José Rujano and Vincenzo Nibali into stage winners in this Giro. The decision was reminiscent of that handed down in the Alessandro Petacchi case from the 2007 Giro d'Italia. The court's ruling opinion was that the minute amount of clenbuterol found was probably not caused by a doping regimen, but that strict liability rules meant that Contador had nonetheless violated WADA's World Anti-Doping Code. The court held that the adverse finding itself was never in doubt, but merely how the substance had entered the athlete's body. This was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> under which they could exonerate him.|$|E

25|$|The {{court ruled}} that even in cases of adultery, sadomasochistic {{behaviour}} was generally <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> of public interest but {{that there could be}} a public interest if the behaviour involved the mocking of Jews or the Holocaust.

The British troops were led by officers trained at the finest military academies where war is studied {{in the same way that}} one studies a subject at university. The fact that Bai Bureh was not executed after his capture has led some historians to claim that this was in admiration for his prowess as an adversary to the British.|$|E

25|$|In {{the late}} Fall of 1997, Wesley Aaron Shafer, Jr., {{was found guilty}} of, inter alia, murder. During the {{sentencing}} phase, Shafer's counsel argued that Simmons required the trial judge to instruct the jury that under South Carolina law, a life sentence carries no possibility of parole. The prosecution responded that because the state did not plan to argue to the jury that Shafer would be a danger in the future, no Simmons instruction was required. During deliberations, the jury asked under what conditions someone convicted of murder could become available for parole. The trial judge stated that parole eligibility or ineligibility was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> for the jury's consideration. Ultimately, the jury recommended {{the death penalty and}} the judge imposed the sentence. In affirming, the South Carolina Supreme Court held that Simmons generally did not apply to the State's sentencing scheme because an alternative to death other than life without the possibility of parole existed.|$|E
