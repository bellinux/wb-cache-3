25|$|Skin reactions: Rash, pruritus, and {{photosensitivity}} {{have all}} been noticed. Toxic epidermal <b>necrolysis</b> (Lyell's syndrome) may also be encountered and may be life-threatening.|$|E
25|$|Side-effects such as rash, fever, {{and fatigue}} are very serious, {{as they may}} {{indicate}} incipient Stevens–Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal <b>necrolysis,</b> DRESS syndrome or aseptic meningitis.|$|E
25|$|Rare {{adverse effects}} (<0.1% of patients) include: anaphylaxis, toxic {{epidermal}} <b>necrolysis,</b> erythema multiforme, red man syndrome, superinfection, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, leukopenia, tinnitus, dizziness and/or ototoxicity, and DRESS syndrome.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} adverse effect of {{nevirapine}} {{is the development}} of mild or moderate rash (13%). Severe or life-threatening skin reactions have been observed in 1.5% of patients, including Stevens–Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal <b>necrolysis</b> and hypersensitivity.|$|E
25|$|Dangerous and {{potentially}} fatal skin reactions, including Stevens–Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal <b>necrolysis,</b> caused by carbamazepine therapy are significantly {{more common in}} people with a particular human leukocyte antigen allele, HLA-B*1502. Odds ratios {{for the development of}} Stevens-Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal <b>necrolysis</b> in people who carry the allele can be in the double, triple or even quadruple digits, depending on the population studied. HLA-B*1502 occurs almost exclusively in people with ancestry across broad areas of Asia, but has a very low or absent frequency in European, Japanese, Korean and African populations. However, the HLA-A*31:01 allele {{has been shown to be}} a strong predictor of both mild and severe adverse reactions to carbamazepine among Japanese and Europeans.|$|E
25|$|Less than 1% of {{primidone}} {{users will}} experience a rash. Compared to carbamazepine, lamotrigine, and phenytoin, {{this is very}} low. The rate is {{comparable to that of}} felbamate, vigabatrin, and topiramate. Primidone also causes exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens–Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal <b>necrolysis.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} manifestations of a {{hypersensitivity}} reaction to sulfa drugs are rash and hives. However, {{there are several}} life-threatening manifestations of hypersensitivity to sulfa drugs, including Stevens–Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal <b>necrolysis,</b> agranulocytosis, hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, fulminant hepatic necrosis, and acute pancreatitis, among others.|$|E
25|$|Sulfonamides {{have the}} {{potential}} to cause a variety of untoward reactions, including urinary tract disorders, haemopoietic disorders, porphyria, and hypersensitivity reactions. When used in large doses, they may cause a strong allergic reaction. Two of the most serious are Stevens–Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal <b>necrolysis</b> (also known as Lyell syndrome).|$|E
25|$|Spironolactone may rarely {{cause more}} severe side effects such as anaphylaxis, renal failure, {{hepatitis}} (two reported cases, neither serious), agranulocytosis, DRESS syndrome, Stevens-Johnson syndrome or toxic epidermal <b>necrolysis.</b> Five cases {{of breast cancer}} in patients who took spironolactone for prolonged periods of time have been reported. It should also be used with caution in people with some neurological disorders, anuria, acute kidney injury, or significant impairment of renal excretory function with risk of hyperkalemia.|$|E
25|$|Unlike carbamazepine, {{there are}} few case reports {{mentioning}} the use of primidone {{in the treatment of}} trigeminal neuralgia. The first, published in the October 10, 1957 issue of Gazette Médicale de France, has no abstract. The second one was a case report of a woman taking primidone and then phenobarbital for trigeminal neuralgia. She developed toxic epidermal <b>necrolysis,</b> as well as endocarditis and gastrointestinal hemorrhage. The second recurrence, induced by phenobarbital, killed her within five weeks of onset.|$|E
25|$|Common adverse drug {{reactions}} (≥1% of patients) {{associated with}} systemic aciclovir therapy (oral or IV) include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, encephalopathy (with IV use only), injection site reactions (with IV use only) and headache. In high doses, hallucinations have been reported. Infrequent adverse effects (0.1–1% of patients) include agitation, vertigo, confusion, dizziness, oedema, arthralgia, sore throat, constipation, abdominal pain, hair loss, rash and weakness. Rare adverse effects (<0.1% of patients) include coma, seizures, neutropenia, leukopenia, crystalluria, anorexia, fatigue, hepatitis, Stevens–Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal <b>necrolysis,</b> {{thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura}} and anaphylaxis.|$|E
25|$|Though uncommon, {{potentially}} fatal adverse effects are stroke, myocardial infarction, GI bleeding, Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, Toxic epidermal <b>necrolysis</b> and anaphylaxis. A less serious and more common (>10%) side effect is drowsiness. Infrequent (<1%) side effects are paresthesia, prolonged bleeding time, injection site pain, purpura, sweating, abnormal thinking, increased tearing (eyes), edema, pallor, dry mouth, abnormal taste, urinary frequency increased liver enzymes, itching and others. Ketorolac can cause premature constriction of the ductus arteriosis in an infant {{during the third}} trimester of pregnancy. The practice of restricting treatment with ketorolac is due to its potential to cause kidney damage. Platelet function is decreased related {{to the use of}} ketorolac.|$|E
25|$|The dose-limiting {{side effects}} are liver damage, lung disease and immunosuppression. The most common side effects (occurring in >1% of those treated with it) are, in {{approximately}} descending order of frequency: diarrhea, respiratory tract infections, hair loss, high blood pressure, rash, nausea, bronchitis, headache, abdominal pain, abnormal liver function tests, back pain, indigestion, urinary tract infection, dizziness, infection, joint disorder, itchiness, weight loss, loss of appetite, cough, gastroenteritis, pharyngitis, stomatitis, tenosynovitis, vomiting, weakness, allergic reaction, chest pain, dry skin, eczema, paraesthesia, pneumonia, rhinitis, synovitis, cholelithiasis and shortness of breath. Whereas uncommon side effects (occurring in 0.1-1% of those {{treated with the}} drug) include: constipation, oral thrush, stomatitis, taste disturbance, thrombocytopenia and hives. Rarely (in 0.1% of those treated with it) it can cause: anaphylaxis, angiooedema, anaemia, agranulocytosis, eosinophilia, leucopenia, pancytopenia, vasculitis, toxic epidermal <b>necrolysis,</b> Stevens-Johnson syndrome, cutaneous lupus erythematosus, severe infection, interstitial lung disease, cirrhosis and liver failure.|$|E

2500|$|More {{serious side}} effects include [...] {{arrhythmia}} with prolonged QT intervals including torsades de pointes, and reversible deafness. Allergic reactions range from urticaria to anaphylaxis. [...] Cholestasis, Stevens–Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal <b>necrolysis</b> are some other rare side effects that may occur.|$|E
2500|$|Rarely {{and very}} rarely: taste disturbance, liver dysfunction, {{peripheral}} oedema, hypersensitivity reactions (including bronchospasm, urinary, angioedema, anaphylaxis), photosensitivity, fever, sweating, depression, interstitial nephritis, blood disorders (including leukopenia, leukocytosis, pancytopenia, thrombocytopenia), arthralgia, myalgia, skin reactions including (erythroderma Stevens–Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal <b>necrolysis,</b> bullous eruption) ...|$|E
2500|$|Caution {{should be}} {{exercised}} in long-term use when breastfeeding. Short-term use is safe; bioavailability in milk is low to nil. According to the U.S. FDA, [...] cases of Stevens–Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal <b>necrolysis,</b> and erythema multiforme associated with doxycyline use have been reported, but a causative role {{has not been}} established.|$|E
2500|$|Lamotrigine {{prescribing}} {{information has}} a black box warning about life-threatening skin reactions, including Stevens–Johnson syndrome (SJS), DRESS syndrome and toxic epidermal <b>necrolysis</b> (TEN). The manufacturer states {{that nearly all}} cases appear {{in the first two}} to eight weeks of therapy, or if the medication is suddenly stopped then resumed at the normal dosage. Patients should seek medical attention for any unexpected skin rash, as its presence is an indication of a possible serious or even deadly side-effect of the drug. Not all rashes that occur while taking lamotrigine progress to SJS or TEN. Between 5 and 10% of patients will develop a rash, but only one in a thousand patients will develop a serious rash. [...] Rash and other skin reactions are more common in children, so this medication is often reserved for adults. For patients whose lamotrigine has been stopped after development of a rash, re-challenge with lamotrigine is also a viable option. However, it is not applicable for very serious cases.|$|E
