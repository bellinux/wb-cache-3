5|$|At {{the same}} time as the Pribilof Islands dispute, an {{outbreak}} of mob violence in New Orleans became an international incident. After <b>New</b> <b>Orleans</b> <b>police</b> chief David Hennessy led a crackdown against local mafiosi, he was assassinated on October 14, 1890. After the alleged murderers were found not guilty on March 14, 1891, a mob stormed the jail and lynched eleven of them. Since many of those killed were Italian citizens the Italian minister, Saverio Fava, protested to Blaine. Blaine explained that federal officials could not control how state officials deal with criminal matters, and Fava announced that he would withdraw the legation back to Italy. Blaine and Harrison believed the Italians' response to be an overreaction, and did nothing. Tensions slowly cooled, and after nearly a year, the Italian minister returned to the United States to negotiate an indemnity. After some internal dispute—Blaine wanted conciliation with Italy, Harrison was reluctant to admit fault—the United States agreed to pay an indemnity of $25,000, and normal diplomatic relations resumed.|$|E

After the war he became politically active in what was an especially violent time in Louisiana and <b>New</b> <b>Orleans</b> politics. During reconstruction, Lewis initially worked for the Freedmen's Bureau raising money for schools. He then was made custom's inspector for a short period, before being recalled for political reasons. He entered the <b>New</b> <b>Orleans</b> Metropolitan <b>police</b> force, but left in 1872 after more political machinations.

25|$|After their {{increased}} {{immigration to}} the U.S. in the late 19th century, Italian Americans in the South were recruited for laboring jobs. On March 14, 1891, 11 Italian immigrants were lynched in New Orleans, Louisiana for their alleged role {{in the murder of}} David Hennessy, an ethnic Irish <b>New</b> <b>Orleans</b> <b>police</b> chief. This incident was one of the largest mass lynchings in U.S. history. A total of twenty Italians were lynched during the 1890s. Although most lynchings of Italian Americans occurred in the South, Italians did not comprise a major portion of immigrants or a major portion of the population as a whole. Isolated lynchings of Italians also occurred in New York, Pennsylvania, and Colorado.|$|E

50|$|An early {{example of}} {{criminal}} {{use of the}} weapon in the United States was {{the assassination of the}} <b>New</b> <b>Orleans</b> chief of <b>police,</b> David Hennessy, in October 1890. The murder punctuated a rivalry between gangs of Sicilian fruit company stevedores whose contracts did not fall {{under the auspices of the}} local longshoreman's union. A pile of sawn-off shotguns was displayed after the murder, including a homemade gun with a folding iron stock, and another with a hook on its stock to brace against the arm when firing one armed. Anti-Italian provocation, following the failed prosecution of a group of suspected men, resulted in a mob assault on the <b>New</b> <b>Orleans</b> Parish Prison and the subsequent lynching of many Italian prisoners.|$|R

25|$|Irish {{immigration}} {{was opposed}} in the 1850s by the nativist Know Nothing movement, originating in New York in 1843. It was engendered by popular {{fears that the}} country was being overwhelmed by Irish Catholic immigrants. On March 14, 1891, a lynch mob stormed a local jail and lynched several Italians following the acquittal of several Sicilian immigrants alleged {{to be involved in the}} murder of <b>New</b> <b>Orleans</b> <b>police</b> chief David Hennessy. The Congress passed the Emergency Quota Act in 1921, followed by the Immigration Act of 1924. The Immigration Act of 1924 was aimed at limiting immigration overall, and making sure that the nationalities of new arrivals matched the overall national profile.|$|E
500|$|Additional acts {{of unrest}} {{occurred}} following the storm, {{particularly with the}} <b>New</b> <b>Orleans</b> <b>Police</b> Department.

[...] Also, one-third of <b>New</b> <b>Orleans</b> <b>police</b> officers deserted {{the city in the}} days before the storm, many of them escaping in their department-owned patrol cars. This added to the chaos by stretching law enforcement thin. Additionally, several NOPD officers were arrested weeks after Katrina for suspicion of vehicle theft.|$|E
