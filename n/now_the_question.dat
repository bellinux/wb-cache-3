2500|$|By {{the time}} Leibowitz closed, the {{prosecution}} had employed anti-semitic remarks to discredit him. Wade Wright added to this, referring to Ruby's boyfriend Lester Carter as [...] "Mr. Caterinsky" [...] and called him [...] "the prettiest Jew" [...] he ever saw. He said, [...] "Don't you know these defense witnesses are bought and paid for? May the Lord have mercy on the soul of Ruby Bates. <b>Now</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> {{in this case is}} this—Is justice in the case going to be bought and sold in Alabama with Jew money from New York?" ...|$|E
2500|$|It {{was this}} period, that the Revolutionary Democratic Group were {{expelled}} and became in their words, [...] "an external faction". The SWP {{was involved in}} the relaunch the ANL in 1992 in response to the growth of the British National Party and campaigned against the Criminal Justice Bill. A demonstration for justice for murdered teenager Stephen Lawrence near the BNP headquarters in Welling in 1993 turned into a violent confrontation with the police, leading to criticism from Ken Livingstone, then a Labour MP and a supporter of the rival Anti-Racist Alliance (ARA), in which Socialist Action plaed a major role. Livingstone argued that this kind of action was playing {{into the hands of the}} BNP. He said at the time: [...] "'No one's discussing [...] policies. <b>Now</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> is the violence of the SWP, arguments between the police and the SWP about who is to blame." [...] Although Stephen's mother Doreen Lawrence attended the Welling demo, she came to realise that the ANL was a [...] "front for the Socialist Workers Party". She later wrote that [...] "the various groups that had taken an interest in Stephen's death were tearing each other apart and were in danger of destroying our campaign which we wanted to keep focused and dignified", and Doreen and Neville Lawrence wrote to both the ANL and ARA to demand that they [...] "stop using Stephen's name".|$|E

2500|$|According to Kierkegaard, {{the human}} self desires {{that which is}} beyond reason. Desire itself {{appears to be a}} desire for the infinite, as Plato once wrote. Even the desire to propagate, {{according}} to Plato, is a kind of desire for immortality—that is, we wish to live on in time through our children and their children. Erotic love itself appears as an example of this desire for something beyond the purely finite. It is a taste of what could be, if only it could continue beyond the boundaries of time and space. As the analogy implies, humans seek something beyond the here and <b>now.</b> <b>The</b> <b>question</b> remains, however, why is it that human pathos or passion is the most precious thing? In some ways, it might have to do with our status as existential beings. It is not thought that gets us through life—it is action; and what motivates and sustains action is passion, the desire to overcome hardships, pain, and suffering. It is also passion that enables us to die for ideals {{in the name of a}} higher reality. While a scientist might see this as plain emotion or simple animal desire, Kierkegaard sees it as that which binds to the source of life itself. The desire to live, and to live in the right way, for the right reasons, and with the right desires, is a holy and sacred force. For Kierkegaard all Christian action should have its ground in love, which is a passion.|$|E
