5|$|Lamason was <b>not</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> speak his mind. On {{the night}} of 30/31 March 1944, when 795 bombers were sent to attack Nuremberg, he was very {{critical}} of the route chosen, warning his station commander that heavy losses could be expected. On the moonlit night, 95 bombers were lost, its heaviest losses of the entire war during a single raid.|$|E
5|$|William Hunt, the onsite {{architect}} {{employed to}} oversee Blore's design, while remaining faithful to Blore's overall plans, was <b>not</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> alter them. Most notably, the Western Gatehouse, the main {{approach to the}} palace, was intended to have octagonal towers, but Hunt redesigned the gatehouse in an English 14th-century castle style, with solid round towers and machicolations, nearly identical to the towers at Bodiam Castle, East Sussex.|$|E
5|$|I don't see {{the point}} of playing in a band and going just one way when you can do everything. It would be {{impossible}} for us to play just death metal; that is our roots, but we are now a mishmash of everything, and not purists to any form of music. It's impossible for us to do that, and quite frankly I would think of it as boring to be in a band that plays just metal music. We're <b>not</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> experiment, or to be caught with our pants down, so to speak. That's what keeps us going.|$|E

Misa freely possess her at any time, represented by a change in Yusa's eye and hair color. While possessing Yusa, Misa is able to use her own ability, pyrokinesis. Misa has a tomboyish and ill-tempered personality, and she is <b>not</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> be violent against anyone looking to harm her sister. She disappears after Yuu takes away Yusa's power.|$|E
5|$|Although {{they were}} renowned for their polite behavior, the courtesans {{were known to}} {{dominate}} the conversation amongst elite men, and were <b>not</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> openly castigate or criticize prominent male guests who talked {{too much or too}} loudly, boasted too much of their accomplishments, or had in some way ruined dinner for everyone by rude behavior (on one occasion a courtesan even beat up a drunken man who had insulted her). When singing to entertain guests, courtesans not only composed the lyrics to their own songs, but they popularized a new form of lyrical verse by singing lines written by various renowned and famous men in Chinese history.|$|E
5|$|Noda is a {{self-reliant}} {{young man}} who executes the strategies formed by the SSS and fights with a halberd. He does not listen to anyone other than Yuri, for whom he has adoration, and is antagonistic to almost everyone else. He has a one-sided rivalry with Otonashi. He is a complete idiot whose weakness is education; at one point, Takeyama is able to knock him out by reciting pi. He is <b>not</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> harm or kill anyone who gets in Yuri's way. Though he prefers to fight with his halberd, he sometimes uses guns out of necessity, the type of weaponry that he hates.|$|E

5|$|Before her stasis {{aboard the}} Spear of Adun, Rohana was a driven protoss who was <b>not</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> seek out tasks others thought impossible. She {{displayed}} strict adherence to tradition, yet was creative {{when faced with}} the issues. After she was awakened, Rohana held on to the old ways of the Protoss Empire, openly speaking out against her Nerazim crew, Artanis' Terran allies, and the reawakening of the Purifiers. She served as a reminder of the past, clinging to old traditions and ways, and refusing to cut her connection from the Khala even as Amon continued to possess her, stating knowledge and history {{was the only thing that}} brought unity to the protoss. Though Artanis valued her memories and her ability to see into Amon's thoughts, he began to grow weary of her adherence to the old ways and her objections to his choices, becoming more of a critic than a councilor. Eventually, she came to terms with the Daelaam, and cut herself from the Khala, stating that perhaps history did not need to be recorded with perfect clarity.|$|E
5|$|Hartley {{explained}} that Arthur would {{be aware of}} his powers {{at the beginning of}} the series and would have no problem using them for personal gain. Hartley felt this played against the typical superheroes, because his character was <b>not</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> flaunt his abilities. Gough explained A.C. would be able to swim faster than humans, breathe underwater, as well as have super strength while underwater. He also stated that exposure to water on land would give him powers. The extent of his speed is shown in the pilot, when Arthur is able to keep up with a fighter jet flying above him. The extent of A.C.'s ability to breathe underwater was not elaborated upon, but he is seen swimming near the bottom of the ocean near the start of the pilot. When A.C. is talking to Eva about releasing captive dolphins, he tells her that he felt as though the dolphins were somehow calling to him. In the comics, one of Aquaman's powers is the ability to communicate with sea life. Gough likened A.C.'s not having access to water to Clark's growing weak around kryptonite in Smallville – if A.C. does not get water, he will dehydrate and weaken. Water gives him a power boost and enables producers to explore stories on land.|$|E
5|$|Swan had {{no respect}} for Heath and was <b>not</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> show it, and so Heath kept Swan's {{appearances}} to a minimum in 1996–97. He offered loan moves to Third Division Hartlepool United and Hereford United, offers which Swan dismissed out of hand, and so Heath placed him on the transfer list. The transfer took until August 1997, at which point {{he moved on to}} Bury for a fee of £50,000 – this reunited him with manager Stan Ternent. The move had been delayed after Heath left Burnley to be replaced by Chris Waddle, though Waddle quickly sanctioned the transfer. Ternent moved Swan back to his role as a striker, despite the player having been used exclusively as a defender at his last few clubs. He scored six goals in his first twelve games before hitting a fifteen-game goal drought. He helped the club to narrowly avoid relegation {{at the end of the}} season.|$|E

50|$|Comics Village is a British based comics website {{launched}} in November 2007 and predominantly aimed at publicizing non-mainstream comics. Over time, it has extended its remit into {{other forms of}} pop culture, into providing a different take on the mainstream (i.e. superhero comics) than that provided by the ratings-chasing other comics websites. The site was based on alternative comics (as in comedians) of the UK scene in the 1980s - <b>not</b> being <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> call a spade a spade, <b>not</b> being <b>afraid</b> <b>to</b> point out the emperor has no clothes, and not beholden to any large US publisher for previews, interviews, etc. - a totally independent comics website.|$|R
