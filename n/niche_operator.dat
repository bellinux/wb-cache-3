At the same time, it was unable to match the significantly lower costs of emerging, aggressively expanding Far East competitors, such as Cathay Pacific.|$|E
40|$|The Indian {{pharmaceutical}} industry is presently {{going through a}} phase of transition and potential consolidation, owing to India’s new TRIPS-compliant intellectual property regime and other rules aimed at enhancing the industry’s credibility nationally and internationally. Appropriate policy interventions can play {{a large role in}} cushioning the transition (and gradual consolidation) of the industry post- 2005. Using firm level data collected in 2004 - 2005, this paper seeks to make two major contributions in this regard. The research findings show that the Indian pharmaceutical sector is a heterogeneous mix of firms with vast differences in innovative capabilities. Based on these differences, the groups can be categorized into specific “innovation modes ” (the innovator, the <b>niche</b> <b>operator</b> and the manufacturer), each mode being a step closer towards the innovative pharmaceutical firm. Second, the paper highlights how the emerging strategies of firms in all three groups, although different, underpin the importance of systemic coordination in the pharmaceutical sector. The analysis links both these findings t...|$|E
50|$|Since 1 July 2015, all 0800 and 0808 {{numbers have}} been free to call from landlines and mobile phones alike. Most mobile phone {{operators}} had charged for such calls previously, with Orange being the final major network to introduce such charges during December 2005. Certain helplines, {{such as those in}} the 0808 80x xxxx series had remained free from most networks on a voluntary basis and some <b>niche</b> <b>operators,</b> such as Giffgaff always offered freephone calls at no charge.|$|R
50|$|The {{companies}} visited to {{and pitched}} to by software resellers are often small and medium enterprises (SMEs), local businesses and <b>niche</b> <b>operators.</b> This benefits the software house {{as they may}} not hold the resources for the legwork needed to spread their network on a lower scale. While it benefits the reseller because he/she can build up networks of smaller clients and become a {{single point of contact}} for them for every aspect concerned with the software, be it advice, training or updating.|$|R

40|$|The {{new economy}} {{presents}} extraordinary opportunities {{for growth and}} profit of electronic management of business-to-business relationships. E-marketplaces, or digital exchanges, represent {{one of the most}} promising phenomena in this environment but, despite the promises, many of these B-to-B exchanges have failed in the last few years, while a few 'survivors' remained in the market. The purpose of this paper is to investigate business models of active e-marketplaces, to understand which features make the difference between successful initiatives and failures. The paper is based on a survey of a sample of European exchanges located in Italy. Alternative business models are described through a cluster analysis along with three dimensions: content, structure, and governance. By comparing performances of the alternative business models, the analysis is able to show key features of successful business models for B-to-B e-marketplaces. The findings show that private large exchanges have a superior capability to generate turnover compared to vertical <b>niche</b> <b>operators,</b> due to specific choices of content, structure, and governance. Managerial implications and suggestions for future research are proposed. B-to-B Exchange business models E-marketplaces Digital exchanges Italy...|$|R

Some <b>niche</b> commercial bus <b>operators</b> such as Timebus Travel exclusively exist {{for the purposes of}} heritage vehicle operation. Most commercial preserved bus operation is for private hire, although occasionally a preserved bus may appear on a scheduled service.|$|R
