40|$|Radio {{frequency}} {{identification is}} a developing technology that {{has recently been}} adopted in industrial applications for identification and tracking operations. The radio frequency <b>identification</b> <b>network</b> planning problem deals with many criteria like number and positions of the deployed antennas in the networks, transmitted power of antennas, and coverage of network. All these criteria must satisfy a set of objectives, such as load balance, economic efficiency, and interference, {{in order to obtain}} accurate and reliable network planning. Achieving the best solution for radio frequency <b>identification</b> <b>network</b> planning has been an area of great interest for many scientists. This article introduces the Ring Probabilistic Logic Neuron as a time-efficient and accurate algorithm to deal with the radio frequency <b>identification</b> <b>network</b> planning problem. To achieve the best results, redundant antenna elimination algorithm is used in addition to the proposed optimization techniques. The aim of proposed algorithm is to solve the radio frequency <b>identification</b> <b>network</b> planning problem and to design a cost-effective radio frequency <b>identification</b> <b>network</b> by minimizing the number of embedded radio frequency identification antennas in the network, minimizing collision of antennas, and maximizing coverage area of the objects.

30|$|Recently, the {{convolutional}} {{neural network}} (CNN) has made great progress in the task of person re-identification, and they are mainly based on the verification <b>network</b> and the <b>identification</b> <b>network.</b> For the verification network, Ahmed et al. [35] added the neighborhood difference layer and the subsequent layer to compare convolutional features in the patch level and summarize the neighborhood differences of each patch. In [36], Ding et al. utilized a series of triplet samples to train the networks which consider the distances between pedestrian images from the same class and the distances between pedestrian images from the different classes, simultaneously. To fully discover the structural information, some methods train the CNN in part-based way. Varior et al. [9] combined the verification network with some gating functions to selectively emphasize common local patterns by comparing the mid-level features across pairs of images. In [37], pedestrian images were cropped into three overlapped parts and three networks were trained jointly. Similarly, Cheng et al. [38] presented to learn both the full-body and local-body features for the pedestrian images. However, the verification network does not fully consider the identity information of images and cannot predict the identity labels of pedestrians. In order to take full advantages of the identity labels, the <b>identification</b> <b>network</b> which has strong discrimination is employed for person re-identification. Zheng et al. [39] fine tuned the <b>identification</b> <b>network</b> on three large datasets and achieved competitive results. Wu et al. [40] proposed the feature extraction network named Feature Fusion Net (FFN) for pedestrian image representation, which combines CNN embeddings with the hand-crafted features in a fully connected layer. Moreover, Zheng et al. [10] combined the verification <b>network</b> with the <b>identification</b> <b>network</b> to learn more discriminative pedestrian descriptors. However, the abovementioned methods learn the <b>identification</b> <b>network</b> in a holistic way, which ignores the structural information.|$|R

For the verification network, we set the training epoch to 75, and set the learning rate to 0.001 and 0.0001 in the first 70 epochs and the final 5 epochs, respectively. The batch size is 24 and the ration between local similar pairs and local dissimilar pairs is 1 : 1 in the verification <b>network.</b> The <b>identification</b> <b>network</b> has the same epoch and learning rate with the verification network, and the batch size of the <b>identification</b> <b>network</b> is set to 48. The mini-batch stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is utilized to update the parameters and the weight decay is set to 0.0005 for two types of networks. There are four blocks in the ResNet- 50 network, and each block contains nine convolution layers. We extract the local feature maps from the ninth convolution layer of the first block in the ResNet- 50 network. The number of divided regions for each pedestrian image is the same, and each pedestrian image {{is divided into three}} regions.
