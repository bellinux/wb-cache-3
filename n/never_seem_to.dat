5|$|Kaʻauwai {{became an}} {{experienced}} fisherman, {{manager of the}} chief's canoes and an early physician. He worked as his headman or right-hand agent to Governor Hoapili and was effectively the Lieutenant Governor of Maui in all but name. In their first meeting in 1832, Reverend Richard Armstrong described how Hoapili trusted him with all his important business including accessing and collecting taxes, managing his property, and conducting tours of the island of Maui, and thus became a highly respected and well-loved official in the public view. In October 1851, the Privy Council of State, the advisory council for the king, recommended him {{as a candidate for}} the Governorship of Maui left vacant by the death of James Kānehoa Young, but the council eventually voted eight to three to recommended the appointment of Prince Lot Kapuāiwa (the future Kamehameha V) instead. However, Prince Lot <b>never</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> have taken up this position either because Kānehoa's deputy Paul Nahaolelua remained acting governor until his own appointment in 1852.|$|E

25|$|Dick Su as Seng: Dick Su was {{involved}} in the production only after Serene Chen brought him in. In the film, Seng is the son in the family, who failed in graduating from his overseas studies. There were times when he tries to convince his family, especially his father, that he can succeed in life. Unfortunately, his plans <b>never</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> work out and he ends up disappointing the people around him.|$|E

Initially, he resents his father for his mother's death, but their {{relationship}} improves gradually after the family moves to Avonlea. For some time, he is Gus's rival for Felicity's affection. Despite making several returns to Avonlea, Felicity and he <b>never</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> {{run into each other}} after that. They both starred together in An Avonlea Christmas, but again, conveniently never ran into each other. He is somber, intellectual, and eccentric, and studied to become a veterinarian.|$|E

25|$|The wing bar {{is unique}} among living {{whistling}} ducks. When on the ground, {{it may be}} hard to discern the light flanks present in many of these waterfowl. The fulvous whistling duck (D. bicolor) is the only sympatric whistling duck that shows such a whitish flank stripe, and it differs from the black-bellied by having dark wings and a lighter belly {{rather than the other way}} around. Juvenile D. autumnalis are quite similar to young of the white-faced whistling duck (D. viduata), which have a darker bill and no white wing patch; even when sitting they <b>never</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> show white along the sides, as their thin white vertical barring on the black flanks is very indistinct.|$|E
25|$|In that year, {{his first}} cousin once removed, Ermengard of Provence, {{daughter}} of the Emperor Louis II and wife of Boso of Provence, brought her son Louis the Blind to him for protection. Charles confirmed Louis in Provence (he may even have adopted him) and allowed them to live at his court. He probably intended to make Louis heir to the whole realm and the imperium. On 11 November, he called an assembly to Frankfurt. While there he received news that an ambitious nephew, Arnulf of Carinthia, had fomented a general rebellion and was marching into Germany with an army of Bavarians and Slavs. The next week saw the collapse of all his support in East Francia. The last to abandon him were his loyal Alemanni, though the men of Lotharingia <b>never</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> have formally accepted his deposition. By 17 November, Charles was out of power, though the exact course of events is unknown. Aside from rebuking his faithlessness, he did little to prevent Arnulf's move—he had recently been ill again—but assured that Bernard was entrusted to his care and possibly Louis too. He asked for a few estates in Swabia on which to live out his days and thus received Naudingen (Donaueschingen). There he died six weeks later, on 13 January 888.|$|E

500|$|Specifically, Enough Said {{was praised}} for its {{commitment}} to realism, both in the way Holofcener's characters converse and in the themes the film addresses. In a review for The New York Times, A. O. Scott claimed that [...] "Line for line, scene for scene, {{it is one of}} the best-written American film comedies in recent memory." [...] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times felt that Enough Said demonstrated [...] "Holofcener's gift for portraying life as it is lived", while David Denby, writing for The New Yorker, wrote that it [...] "approaches novelistic richness". In The New York Times Book Review, Francine Prose praised Holofcener for having written characters [...] "with sufficient depth and wisdom that ... the actors <b>never</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> be movie stars impersonating people. Rather, they disappear into the vulnerable and self-doubting characters they play without a hint of the preening vanity that so often causes cinematic performances to seem forced and shallow." ...|$|E

500|$|Last of the Summer Wine was set and {{filmed in}} and around Holmfirth, West Yorkshire, England, and centred on a trio of old men and their {{youthful}} misadventures; {{the membership of the}} trio changed several times over the years. The original trio consisted of Bill Owen as the mischievous and impulsive Compo Simmonite, Peter Sallis as easy-going everyman Norman Clegg, and Michael Bates as uptight and arrogant Cyril Blamire. When Bates dropped out due to illness in 1976 after two series, the role of the third man of the trio was filled in various years up to the 30th series by the quirky war veteran Walter [...] "Foggy" [...] Dewhurst (Brian Wilde), who had two lengthy stints in the series, the eccentric inventor Seymour Utterthwaite (Michael Aldridge), and former police officer Herbert [...] "Truly of The Yard" [...] Truelove (Frank Thornton). The men <b>never</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> grow up, and they develop a unique perspective on their equally eccentric fellow townspeople through their stunts. Although in its early years the series generally revolved around the exploits of the main trio, with occasional interaction with a few recurring characters, over time the cast grew to include a variety of supporting characters and by later years the series was very much an ensemble piece. Each of these recurring characters contributed their own running jokes and subplots to the show and often becoming reluctantly involved in the schemes of the trio, or on occasion having their own, separate storylines.|$|E
500|$|Describing Vala's {{attitude}} towards bonding with other characters as [...] "in {{a strange way}} quite level-headed" [...] and [...] "quite honest", Black interpreted Vala's behavior {{as a reaction to}} growing attached to people where the relationships <b>never</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> work out. Cooper explained that by Vala's contacting of Stargate Command about the imminent threat at the end of season 9, she [...] "has reached a point of honesty with [...] characters and possibly herself on a level that she's never had before." [...] From the beginning of season 10, Claudia Black and Amanda Tapping requested a similarly positive camaraderie between their characters as male characters have. Tapping noted Carter's respect for Vala despite them being at opposite ends in their actions; Tapping also thought Carter finds Vala amusing rather than annoying. A scene in [...] "Morpheus" [...] that was intended to establish this relationship was cut for time, and until the late season 10 episode [...] "Family Ties" [...] would accommodate this with a shopping scene, the actresses acknowledged their connection through looks and subtle nuances. By joining SG-1, Vala also shared a spot with stoic warrior Teal'c as the only alien members of the team, and actor Christopher Judge (Teal'c) explained that his character's amusement with Vala contributed to Teal'c's loosening up. The relationship between Vala and SG-1 team leader Colonel Cameron Mitchell (played by Ben Browder) was rarely emphasized in the series since Black and Browder were well known for formerly starring as star-crossed lovers in the cult sci-fi series Farscape.|$|E
