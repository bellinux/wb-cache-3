However, actual domestic water use is lower because of <b>network</b> <b>losses,</b> and furthermore it varies considerably between different localities in Egypt.

25|$|Given {{the high}} water {{scarcity}} in Jordan, the average per capita use {{is lower than}} in most other countries. Water production before <b>network</b> <b>losses</b> is about 120 liters per person and day while actual consumption is close to 80 liters per capita and day. A survey of water consumption habits by households in Eastern Amman and in 14 villages in the Northern Governorates showed that total consumption per capita lies between 60 and 80 liters per day. About 20-30% of this water is obtained from sources other than the public piped system, including from bottled water, water bought from tankers, rainwater harvesting and springs. In rural areas, 28% of households surveyed harvested rainwater and stored it in cisterns for drinking, since they considered it to be of better quality than piped water. In Eastern Amman, 12% of households bought water in large bottles and 30% bought water from private tankers. Most households have roof storage tanks with a volume of 1–2 m3. According to the 2009 Population and Family Health Survey, 31% of households use bottled water, 7% use rainwater, 2% tanker water and 60% tap water as their primary source of drinking water. According to the same survey, 22% of households filter tap water and the majority does not apply any type of treatment. A 2007–08 survey by the German-Jordanian water programme in the middle governorates Zarqa, Balqa and Madaba showed that 79% of households use tap water as their main source of drinking water and that 37% of households treat water before drinking it.

40|$|We {{consider}} two finite capacity loss queues {{in series}} with Poisson arrival at the first queue, and with Erlang service time distribution at both queues. We assume that the service rate at the second queue is held fixed and that a maximum buffer space is globally available. For this model, we {{address the problem of}} optimally choosing the service rate at the first queue and the buffer space distribution over the two queues in order to minimize the steady-state total <b>network</b> <b>loss</b> rate. It is shown that a decrease of the service rate at the first queue can reduce the total <b>network</b> <b>loss</b> rate only if this lower service rate decreases the variability of the process feeding the second queue. Numerical results show that, when optimal values are assigned to the parameters of the model, a significant reduction of the <b>network</b> <b>loss</b> rate can be achieved, especially when the network load is moderate and when the service time distributions have a small variance. broad-band communication networks using asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) techniques is a potential field of application of these results...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (MTech(Electrical Engineering)) [...] Cape Peninsula University of Technology, 2011 In a situation, {{where there}} is a {{shortage}} of power generation or the power stations are operating with a very low reserve margin, as is typically the current position in South Africa, there is a need to operate distribution network at the highest possible efficiency by utilising <b>network</b> power <b>loss</b> reduction techniques. Such techniques are especially important when contingencies occur as they tend to increase loss, reduce efficiencies and cause power supplies to such networks to increase. This increase can cause the network or multiples of such networks to be load shed as the power stations do not have the reserve margins to meet this increased demand. The ideal situation would thus be to minimise <b>network</b> <b>loss</b> and in so doing decrease the amount of power needed and possibly avoid load shedding. Thus, there is a need to study efficiency, <b>network</b> <b>loss</b> reduction under contingency conditions and this is the focus of the research. Most large urban distribution networks are operated as ring main networks. Ring networks are considered to have less power loss. However, a major component in a ring network can cause the loss to substantially increase; resulting in power shortage in the network. There is an urgency to eliminate high <b>network</b> <b>loss.</b> An efficiency plan was developed for a large ring network that reduces the loss so that its input power can be decreased. In this way, the available power existing due to the contingency can be more evenly spread, and the number of ring main networks to be load shed could be reduced...|$|R
