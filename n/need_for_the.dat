5|$|Discussions {{about the}} <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> road to be {{constructed}} {{date back to}} the construction of Switch Island junction, with numerous public consultations held throughout the years to ascertain public support and opinion on the <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> road and the alignment it would take. The consultations have produced favourable responses from the majority of respondents, with several different alignment suggestions being proposed over the years.|$|E

5|$|The <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> second crewman was {{an obvious}} problem with the Mk. XII, {{especially}} as few bombers of the era had enough room for the operator. Working with Henry Braddick, Blackett developed {{a new version of}} the calculator that included aircraft instruments inside the computor, eliminating the <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> needle-on-needle matching and completely automating the calculations. After the initial design was complete, Blackett moved onto other matters with RAF Coastal Command, where he continued development of his theories of operational research.|$|E

40|$|An {{exploratory}} {{measure of}} multiple motives (EMMM) is presented. The EMMM enables researchers to make quick exploratory assessments {{of a relatively}} large number of general motives. It includes 14 single-item self-report measures that assess self-control, self-esteem, sensation-seeking, <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> acquisition, <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> affect, <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> cognition, <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> meaning, <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> power, <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> precision, <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> self-consistency, <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> structure, <b>the</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> uniqueness, <b>the</b> <b>need</b> to belong, {{and the need to}} buffer anxiety about death. Each single-item measure is sourced from previously-established psychometric scales. The EMMM’s rationale, development, operationalization, analysis, and exploratory nature are discussed, and evidence is provided <b>for</b> <b>the</b> divergent and convergent validity of its items. It is considered to be the Swiss Army knife of motivation measures: A small but versatile tool <b>for</b> understanding <b>the</b> complexity of human attitudes and behaviours...|$|R

5|$|A {{few years}} later there was a debate between Heaviside and Peter Guthrie Tait about the {{relative}} merits of vector analysis and quaternions. The result was the realisation that there was no <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> greater physical insights provided by quaternions if the theory was purely local, and vector analysis became commonplace. Maxwell was proven correct, and his quantitative connection between light and electromagnetism {{is considered one of the}} great accomplishments of 19th century mathematical physics.|$|E
5|$|At this time, the ADF had no {{military}} units on operational deployment outside Australia. In 1987, the ADF {{made its first}} operational deployment as part of Operation Morris Dance, in which several warships and a rifle company deployed to the waters off Fiji {{in response to the}} 1987 Fijian coups d'état. While broadly successful, this deployment highlighted the <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> ADF to improve its capability to rapidly respond to unforeseen events.|$|E
5|$|During {{the second}} half of the 16th century, Europeans' {{interest}} in the New World revolved around gold and silver and not tobacco. The European lack of interest in tobacco was due to the fact that the Amerindians controlled the tobacco industry; as long as the Amerindians controlled the supply there was no <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> incorporation in European commercial capitalism.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the merger}} of Westland and Agusta to form AgustaWestland in 2000, there was no <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> {{separate}} EHI entity; the EH101 was formally re-branded as the AW101 in 2007. In 2008, the volume of AW101 orders was reported as having filled production capacity {{in excess of the}} following five years. By April 2009, more than 180 AW101s had been sold worldwide; the combined operational fleet had also accumulated a total of 170,000 flying hours.|$|E
5|$|German air {{doctrine}} {{had seen}} little <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> {{development of an}} nocturnal night air defence system and the Luftwaffe concentrated on the offensive use of air power. However, {{the failure of the}} Luftwaffe in the Battle of Britain in 1940 ended hopes for an early victory and forced the continuance of hostilities with the British Empire. Faced with German domination of the continent, the only weapon the British could use to exert immediate military pressure on Germany was the night bombing operations of RAF Bomber Command.|$|E

5|$|In 2002, the Australian {{government}} {{created the}} White Shark Recovery Plan, implementing government-mandated conservation research and monitoring for conservation {{in addition to}} federal protection and stronger regulation of shark-related trade and tourism activities. An updated recovery plan was published in 2013 to review progress, research findings, and to implement further conservation actions. A study in 2012 revealed that Australia's White Shark population was separated by Bass Strait into genetically distinct eastern and western populations, indicating a <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> development of regional conservation strategies.|$|E
5|$|In February 1983, the two {{assistant}} directorates were merged {{to promote}} efficiency {{and recognize the}} interdependency of their programs. Jerry L.

5|$|In {{domestic}} matters, Scott advocated increased {{salaries for}} public officials, economic development measures, and heavy punishments for persistent criminals. While he desired a tax code that would preclude the <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> state to borrow money, he encouraged legislators to keep taxes {{as low as}} possible. He also urged them to convert the militia into a youth army. The General Assembly routinely ignored his calls for reform but did pass a measure he advocated that allowed debtors a one-year stay on collection of their debts if they provided both bond and security.|$|E

5|$|In his Federalist No. 43, {{published}} January 23, 1788, James Madison {{argued that}} the new federal government would need authority over a national capital to provide for its own maintenance and safety. Five years earlier, a band of unpaid soldiers besieged Congress while its members were meeting in Philadelphia. Known as the Pennsylvania Mutiny of 1783, the event emphasized the <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> national government not to rely on any state for its own security.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s, after Estonia regained independence, {{the country}} {{underwent}} a {{restructuring of the}} economy, causing {{the collapse of a}} large part of the heavy industry sector. This collapse led to a decrease in the consumption of electricity and thus a decrease in the <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> oil shale that was mined to produce it. Electricity and shale oil export to former Soviet markets largely ceased. Due to a decrease in demand, the Tammiku and Sompa mines closed in 1999 and those at Kohtla and Ahtme closed in 2001.|$|E
5|$|Large-scale {{limestone}} quarrying {{has been}} a particular area of contention.
