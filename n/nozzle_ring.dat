It is done by the fixed blades which act as nozzles. The steam expands equally in all rows of fixed blade. The steam coming from the boiler is fed to the first set of fixed blades i.e. the <b>nozzle</b> <b>ring.</b> The steam is partially expanded in the <b>nozzle</b> <b>ring.</b> Hence, there is a partial decrease in pressure of the incoming steam. This leads to an increase in the velocity of the steam. Therefore the pressure decreases and velocity increases partially in the nozzle.|$|E

The grinding force for coal pulverization is applied by a loading frame. This frame is connected by vertical tension rods to three hydraulic cylinders secured to the mill foundation. All forces used in the pulverizing process are transmitted to the foundation via the gear reducer and loading elements. The pendulum movement of the roller wheels provides a freedom for wheels to move in a radial direction, which results in no radial loading against the mill housing during the pulverizing process.|$|E

The performance of the VG mixed flow turbine has been evaluated experimentally in steady and unsteady flow conditions. The VG mixed flow turbine shows higher peak efficiency and swallowing capacity at various vane angle settings compared to an equivalent nozzleless turbine. Comparison with an equivalent straight vane arrangement shows a higher swallowing capacity but similar efficiencies.

40|$|Turbochargers are {{becoming}} an essential device in internal combustion engines as they boost the intake air with more pressure {{in order to}} increase the power output. These devices are normally designed for a single steady design point but the pulsating flow delivered from the internal combustion engine is everything but steady. The efficiency drop experienced in the off-design points by the fixed geometry turbochargers have made some research groups to look into new variable geometry solutions for turbocharging. A <b>nozzle</b> <b>ring</b> is a device which normally achieves a higher performance under design conditions, but the efficiency rapidly drops at off-design conditions. In this paper, a variable angle <b>nozzle</b> <b>ring</b> is designed and implemented in the model of a radial turbine of a turbocharger in order to study its potential when working under real internal combustion engine cycles. To understand the profit margin the turbine performance is compared with two turbines with the same impeller geometry: one without <b>nozzle</b> <b>ring</b> and one with a <b>nozzle</b> <b>ring</b> with a fixed angle. The results show that the maximum efficiency angle function calculated for the variable angle <b>nozzle</b> <b>ring</b> achieves an improvement in the total efficiency of 5 % when comparing with a turbine with a fixed angle and 18 % when comparing with a vaneless turbine. The improved guidance achieved due to the variable blade angle leads to less turbine losses and therefore more mechanical energy can be extracted from the exhaust mass flow throughout all the combustion cycle but a further study should be made in order to match all the engine operations points. Notably, taking the pulsating boundary conditions into consideration, a remarkable improvement is achieved already for the fixed angle <b>nozzle</b> <b>ring.</b> ...|$|E

40|$|A new {{turbocharger}} turbine {{concept that}} enhances exhaust energy recovery has been developed; {{it is known}} as the ârotating vane turbineâ (RVT). It aims to address the negative impact of the pulsating exhaust flow on the turbocharger turbine, so that the exhaust energy can be recovered more efficiently compared to the state of art turbocharging technologies. Different from traditional turbine configurations, in which the nozzle is stationary, the RVT incorporates a rotating <b>nozzle</b> <b>ring</b> at a relatively low speed. It thus minimises the deviation of the turbine incidence angle from the optimal design angle on average through a pulse cycle, it as such leads to an improvement of turbine performance. Two control methods are investigated for the rotating nozzle: a passive self-rotation and one that is controlled from the outside with the use of an external driving turbine. The geometry of the rotating <b>nozzle</b> <b>ring</b> is also optimized to reduce the incidence loss on the nozzle blade under unsteady flow. The new RVT is studied through numerical calculation in order to demonstrate that the rotating <b>nozzle</b> <b>ring</b> can adaptively change the flow angle at the turbine inlet through a pulse cycle. As a result, the turbine operating point is pushed to better performance region with higher turbine efficiency and lower pressure ratio, compared to a traditional stationary <b>nozzle</b> <b>ring.</b> The flow analysis shows that the turbine performance improvement is due to the reduction of the flow separation on the turbine blade under sub-optimal operating conditions. Detailed experimental testing is also carried out to further validate the new concept. Two rotating nozzles with different angles are tested under different flow frequencies, turbine speeds, turbine loads and mass flow rates. As comparisons, stationary vane turbine (SVT) and nozzleless turbine are also tested under the same operating conditions as for RVT. The testing results demonstrate that, the rotating <b>nozzle</b> <b>ring</b> can reduce the amplitude of the flow pulses, thereby reducing the unsteadiness level of the turbine operation. Similar to the simulation results, a significant increase in average turbine efficiency as well as a reduction of turbine pressure ratio are observed for RVT, compared to for SVT or nozzleless turbine. A preliminary study of 1 D engine simulation is also carried out to investigate the impact of the new RVT on the engine performance. The simulation results show that, the back pressure of the engine with RVT is reduced based on the same engine power output. This indicates the new RVT can effectively reduce the BSFC of an engine, compared to a traditional SVT. Open Acces...|$|E

As part of a major debottlenecking project, they were rerated to provide more flow. The entire pump inner case assemblies (including rotor and inner casing) were replaced with higher capacity elements. The steam turbines had new governor valves and <b>nozzle</b> <b>rings</b> installed to produce more power. The control scheme was modernized with an electronic governor that adjusted the pump speed to maintain a constant header pressure.

The cause was a valve resonance problem that were teething problems with the electronic governor control system that took time to sort out.

40|$|The {{design of}} a radial turbine working at peak {{efficiency}} {{over a wide range}} of operating conditions is nowadays an active topic of research, as this constitutes a target feature for applications on turbochargers. To this purpose many solutions have been suggested, including the use of devices for better flow guidance, namely the <b>nozzle</b> <b>ring,</b> which are reported to boost the performance of a radial turbine at both design and off-design points. However the majority of performance evaluations available in literature are based on one-dimensional meanline analysis, hence loss terms related to the three-dimensional nature of real flows inside a radial turbine are either approximated through empirical relations or simply neglected. In this thesis a three-dimensional approach to the {{design of a}} radial turbine is implemented, and two configurations, with and without fixed <b>nozzle</b> <b>ring,</b> are generated. The turbine is designed for a turbocharging system of a typical six-cylinder diesel truck engine, of which exhaust gas thermodynamic properties are known.

Results show that, at design point, the addition of a static <b>nozzle</b> <b>ring</b> leads to non negligible increments, with respect to the vaneless case, of both efficiency and power output: such increments are estimated in + 1. 5 % and + 3. 5 % respectively, despite these data should be compared with the uncertainty of the numerical model.

Measurements of pressure at the inlet and outlet of both stages and in the inter-stage pipe hinted at an acoustic excitation in the annular space between impeller and adjustable <b>nozzle</b> <b>ring.</b> The acoustic excitation and resulting subsynchronous vibrations could be reduced by installing a few fixed nozzles, thus interrupting the vaneless space {{to the extent that}} safe operation of the gear turbine is possible adhering to the relevant guidelines.

The action of this venturi results in the aspiration of considerable volumes of air through the bore of the unit.

40|$|Variable Geometry Turbochargers (VGT) {{are widely}} used to improve engine-turbocharger {{matching}} and currently common in diesel engines. VGT has proven to provide air boost for wide engine speed range as well as reduce turbo-lag. This thesis presents the design and experimental evaluation of a variable geometry mixed flow turbocharger turbine. The mixed flow rotor {{used in this study}} consists of 12 blades with a constant inlet blade angle of + 20 Â°, a cone angle of 50 Â° and a tip diameter of 95. 2 mm. A variable geometry stator has been designed within this work, consists of 15 vanes fitted into a ring mechanism with a pivoting range between 40 Â° and 80 Â°. A novel nozzle vane was designed to have 40 Â° lean stacking (from the axial direction). This geometrically achieves 3 -dimensional match with the mixed flow rotor and aims to improve the turbine stage performance. A conventional straight nozzle vane was also constructed {{in order to have a}} comparative design to assess the benefits of the new lean vane. The steady flow performance results are presented for vane angle settings of 40 Â°, 50 Â°, 60 Â°, 65 Â° and 70 Â° over a non-dimensional speed range of 0. 833 - 1. 667. The tests have been carried out with a permanent magnet eddy current dynamometer within a velocity ratio range of 0. 47 to 1. 09. The optimum efficiency of the variable geometry turbine was found to be approximately 5 percentage points higher than the baseline nozzleless unit. The peak efficiency of the variable geometry turbine corresponds to vane angle settings between 60 Â° and 65 Â°, for both the lean and straight vanes. The maximum total-to-static efficiency of the turbine with lean vanes configuration was measured to be 79. 8 % at a velocity ratio of 0. 675. The equivalent value with straight vanes configuration is 80. 4 % at a velocity ratio of 0. 673. The swallowing capacity of the turbine was shown to increase with the lean vanes, as much as 17 % at 70 Â° vane angle and pressure ratio of 1. 7. The turbine pulsating flow performance is presented for 50 % and 80 % equivalent speed conditions and a pulse frequency range of 20 - 80 Hz, these frequencies correspond to an engine speed range of 800 - 3200 RPM respectively. The turbine was observed to go through a period of choking within a pulse for vane angle settings between 60 Â° - 70 Â°. The unsteady efficiency of a nozzled turbine was found to exhibit larger deviation from the quasi-steady curve compared to a nozzlesless turbine, by as much as - 19. 4 percentage points. This behaviour was found to be more pronounced towards the close nozzle settings, where the blockage effect is dominant. The <b>nozzle</b> <b>ring</b> was also shown to act as a ârestrictorâ which shields the turbine rotor from being completely exposed to the unsteadiness of the flow. This coupled with the phase shifting ambiguity was shown to result in the inaccuracy of the point-by-point instantaneous efficiency; where as much as 25 % of a cycle exhibits instantaneous efficiency above unity. Finally the turbine was tested by adapting to the pulsating flow (20 - 60 Hz) by cyclic variation in the opening and closing of the nozzle vanes, called Active Control Turbocharger (A. C. T.). The nozzle vane operating schedules for each pulse period were evaluated experimentally in two general modes; natural oscillating opening/closing of the nozzle vanes due to the pulsating flow and the forced sinusoidal oscillation of the vanes to match the incoming pulsating flow. The spring stiffness was found to be a dominant factor in the effectiveness of the natural oscillation mode. In the best setting, the turbine energy extraction was shown to improve by 6. 1 % over a cycle for the 20 Hz flow condition. In overall it was demonstrated an optimum A. C. T. operating condition could be achieved by allowing the <b>nozzle</b> <b>ring</b> to oscillate naturally in pulsating flow, against an external spring pre-load, which eliminates the use of complex mechanism and external drive. However, the current result suggest the benefits of A. C. T. are best realised in large low speed engines. Open Acces...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the development of}} high efficiency turbochargers and turbogenerators to significantly increase the {{power to weight ratio}} and reduce both the fuel consumption and emissions from heavy duty diesel engines. A literature overview is provided for turbomachinery based exhaust energy recovery projects in the public domain. The technologies are discussed in detail and compared using real test data. The thesis describes some design issues that were experienced during engine testing one with a heat shield and one with a volute - and how finite element analysis was used to generate solutions and long term evolutions in the designs. A variable <b>nozzle</b> guide vane <b>ring</b> was designed but seizing of the mechanism occurred during testing. A low friction coating was shown to be the solution.

5000|$|Fan Guns {{are very}} {{different}} from all other guns because they require electricity to power a fan as well as an on-board reciprocating piston air compressor; modern fan guns do not require compressed air from an external source. Compressed air and water are shot out of the gun through a variety of nozzles (there are many different designs) and then the wind from the large fan blows this into a mist in the air to achieve a long hang time. Fan guns have anywhere from 12 to 360 water <b>nozzles</b> on a <b>ring</b> {{on the front of the}} gun through which the fan blows air. These banks can be controlled by valves. The valves are either manual, manual electric, or automatic electric (controlled by logic controller or computer).|$|R
5000|$|Due {{to being}} stalked by Kaine during {{the five years}} of his {{worldwide}} travels, Ben Reilly makes his own improvements over Peter Parker's original web-shooters for defenses against Kaine's attacks. Reilly's web-shooters still have triggers on the inside palm to fire a web-line from a turbine-driven spinneret. Though Reilly's web-shooters can still fire them {{with a variety of}} options of web patterns, it was done by a piezoelectric valving instead of a <b>nozzle</b> adjustment <b>ring</b> as Parker's. Three new weapons are designed within the modified shooters. When twisting a shooter's wrist cuff, impact webbing is fired out as miniature web-pellets that explode on contact, encasing a target within a web cocoon and rendering him or her virtually immobile. Stingers are small, diamond-shaped darts coated with a paralyzing chemical agent to incapacitate opponents. Mini-dot tracers are miniaturized versions of Parker's spider-tracers (at 1/4" [...] of their size), smaller and lighter and shaped like red diminutive Frisbees, which are even more difficult to detect and much faster when fired from Reilly's web-shooters. Each of these projectiles are fired from a cassette-style launching pod built within the shooters. Because of Reilly's web-shooters are bulkier than Peter Parker's {{as the result of the}} modifications, he wears them on the outside of his costume. Like Parker, Reilly also wears a belt that contains spare web cartridges.|$|R
