40|$|CIVINSThe United States Navy has {{recognized}} the rising age of its <b>nuclear</b> <b>reactors.</b> With this increasing age comes increasing importance of backup generators. In {{addition to the}} need for decay heat removal common to all (naval and commercial) <b>nuclear</b> <b>reactors,</b> naval vessels with <b>nuclear</b> <b>reactors</b> also require a backup means of propulsion. All underway Navy <b>nuclear</b> <b>reactors</b> are operated with diesel generators as a backup power system, able to provide emergency electric power for reactor decay heat removal as well as enough electric power to supply an emergency propulsion mechanism. While all commercial <b>nuclear</b> <b>reactors</b> are required to incorporate muhiple backup generators, naval submarine nuclear plants feature a single backup generator. The increasing age of naval <b>nuclear</b> <b>reactors,</b> coupled with the dual reqmrements of a submarine's solitary backup generator, makes the study of submarine backup generators vital.

The foremost use of corrosion-resistant hafnium and zirconium has been in <b>nuclear</b> <b>reactors.</b> Zirconium has a very low and hafnium has a high thermal neutron-capture cross-section. Therefore, zirconium (mostly as zircaloy) is used as cladding of fuel rods in <b>nuclear</b> <b>reactors,</b> while hafnium is used in control rods for <b>nuclear</b> <b>reactors,</b> because each hafnium atom can absorb multiple neutrons.|$|R

5|$|Uranium-235 was {{the first}} isotope that {{was found to be}} fissile. Other {{naturally}} occurring isotopes are fissionable, but not fissile. On bombardment with slow neutrons, its uranium-235 isotope will most of the time divide into two smaller nuclei, releasing nuclear binding energy and more neutrons. If too many of these neutrons are absorbed by other uranium-235 nuclei, a nuclear chain reaction occurs that results in a burst of heat or (in special circumstances) an explosion. In a <b>nuclear</b> <b>reactor,</b> such a chain reaction is slowed and controlled by a neutron poison, absorbing some of the free neutrons. Such neutron absorbent materials are often part of reactor control rods (see <b>nuclear</b> <b>reactor</b> physics for a description of this process of reactor control).|$|E
