2500|$|As a performer, he {{was known}} for his {{flamboyant}} style and showmanship. He came to be regarded as a sex symbol for his androgynous, amorphous sexuality, play with signifiers of gender, and defiance of racial stereotypes. His [...] "audacious, idiosyncratic" [...] fashion sense made use of [...] "ubiquitous purple, alluring makeup and frilled garments." [...] His androgynous look has been compared to that of Little Richard and David Bowie. In 2016, Reynolds described it as [...] "Prince’s ’80s evasion of conventional gender definitions speaks to us <b>now</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> trans-aware moment. But it also harks backwards in time to the origins of rock 'n' roll in racial mixture and sexual blurring".|$|E

The show aired live on MSNBC from 6:00 AM to 9:00 AM Eastern, and on delay on the radio from 9:00 AM to noon Eastern. During this period, the show originated from MSNBC's studio in Secaucus, New Jersey, the studios and time slot formerly used by the canceled Imus in the Morning. On the first day on MSNBC, Miller visibly sweated from her armpits which she joked about in her usual self-depracating manner. As a result, onscreen she was dubbed [...] "Sweaty Chick". Miller and her on-air staff received generally favorable reviews for their appearance. A fan petition was started to make the show the permanent replacement for the Imus MSNBC show. After the stint, she said that she was not interested in the position full-time. Joe Scarborough's show Morning Joe is <b>now</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> time slot.|$|E

2500|$|The Washington Herald {{published}} {{an interview with}} Kellogg where she supported women's suffrage, emphasizing Iroquois women's equality of civic powers with the men. Female leaders among the Oneida were not uncommon. [...] "It is a cause of astonishment to us that you white women are only <b>now,</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> twentieth century, claiming {{what has been the}} Indian woman's privilege as far back as history traces." [...] The Iroquois had a communal system of land distribution and the tribe gave tracts to clans for further distribution among households for cultivation. Clan Mothers decided any and all issues involving territory, including where a community was to be built and how land was to be used. Since land tracts were the concern of the women, it was the women's job to cultivate food and not the men, [...] The Clan Mothers' Council also reserved certain areas of land to be worked by the women of all the different clans. Food from such lands, called kěndiǔ"gwǎ'ge' hodi'yěn'tho, would be used at festivals and large council gatherings.|$|E
