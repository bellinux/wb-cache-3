50|$|All iPods lack Touch ID, 3D Touch, NFC, GPS, an {{earpiece}} {{speaker and}} a <b>noise-cancelling</b> <b>microphone.</b> Depending on the generation, the iPod Touch {{may have a}} smaller or inferior display and camera(s). Newer models (5th and 6th generation) lack the ambient light sensor that makes automatic brightness available. Older models lack a built in speaker, a microphone, a camera, and a flash.|$|E
5000|$|Martian Watches are {{produced}} in several styles, each with an analog time display, a small OLED display screen, a speaker, and a <b>noise-cancelling</b> <b>microphone.</b> The small OLED displays scrolling text which can show caller ID information, text messages, {{and other information}} such as social media notifications. In addition, the watch {{can be used to}} trigger the shutter of the mobile phone's camera. [...] The watches utilize Bluetooth 4.0, which supports regular Bluetooth, as well as Bluetooth low energy. The analog watch portion of Martian Watches is powered by a watch battery, and there is a side mounted micro USB port for the rechargeable battery that handles the phone functions, in addition to an accelerometer.|$|E
50|$|A <b>noise-canceling</b> <b>{{microphone}}</b> is {{a microphone}} {{that is designed}} to filter ambient noise from the desired sound, which is especially useful in noisy environments.|$|R
50|$|Some mobile radios use <b>noise-canceling</b> <b>microphones</b> or headsets. At speeds over 100 MPH, {{the ambient}} road and wind noise can make radio {{communications}} difficult to understand. For example, California Highway Patrol mobile radios have <b>noise-canceling</b> <b>microphones</b> which reduce road and siren noise {{heard by the}} dispatcher. Most fire engines and radios in heavy equipment use noise-canceling headsets. These protect the occupant's hearing and reduce background noise in the transmitted audio. <b>Noise-canceling</b> <b>microphones</b> require the operator speak directly into {{the front of the}} microphone. Hole arrays {{in the back of the}} microphone pick up ambient noise. This is applied, out-of-phase, to the back of the microphone, effectively reducing or canceling any sound which is present both in front and back of the microphone. Ideally, only the voice present on the front side of the microphone goes out on the air.|$|R
2500|$|A <b>noise-canceling</b> <b>microphone</b> is {{a highly}} {{directional}} design intended for noisy environments. [...] One such use is in aircraft cockpits where they are normally installed as boom microphones on headsets. Another use is in live event support on loud concert stages for vocalists involved with live performances. Many <b>noise-canceling</b> <b>microphones</b> combine signals received from two diaphragms that are in opposite electrical polarity or are processed electronically. In dual diaphragm designs, the main diaphragm is mounted closest to the intended source {{and the second is}} positioned farther away from the source so that it can pick up environmental sounds to be subtracted from the main diaphragm's signal. After the two signals have been combined, sounds other than the intended source are greatly reduced, substantially increasing intelligibility. Other noise-canceling designs use one diaphragm that is affected by ports open to the sides and rear of the microphone, with the sum being a 16dB rejection of sounds that are farther away. One noise-canceling headset design using a single diaphragm has been used prominently by vocal artists such as Garth Brooks and Janet Jackson. A few <b>noise-canceling</b> <b>microphones</b> are throat microphones.|$|R
50|$|They {{feature a}} <b>noise-cancelling</b> <b>microphone</b> that works over {{bluetooth}} to reduce ambient noise over phone calls. Much like the QuietComfort 25, an included audio cable allows wired {{use of the}} headphones either with or without use of the noise cancelling feature. Similar to Bose's SoundLink models, the right ear cup features a pair of volume buttons flanking a pause/play button. The user can double or triple press the play button to skip forward or backward a track. The right ear cup also has the power switch, which you flick to a third position to put the headphones into pairing mode, if you need it, which {{you do for a}} smartphone. The headphones are also NFC compatible, and tapping an NFC enabled device such as certain Android smartphones on the NFC spot located on the headphones pairs them via Bluetooth.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{techniques to}} improve the robustness of the HTK large vocabulary speech recognition system to non-ideal acoustic environments. The primary methods are single-pass retraining using stereo training data; parallel model combination which combines HMMs trained on clean data with estimates of convolutional and additive noise; and maximum likelihood linear regression which estimates a set of linear transformations of the model parameters to the current conditions. Experiments are reported on both the 1994 ARPA CSR S 5 (alternate microphones) and S 10 (additive noise) spoke tasks and the 1995 ARPA CSR H 3 task (multiple unknown microphones). The HTK system yielded the lowest error rates in both the H 3 -P 0 and H 3 -C 0 tests. 1.

The LifeChat ZX-6000 ships with a black Wireless Gaming Receiver.|$|R
50|$|Speech {{recognition}} was discontiguous, {{meaning the}} player {{had only a}} few seconds to speak into a headset when prompted. This headset was equipped with a <b>noise-canceling</b> <b>microphone</b> to help isolate speech from any other sounds. Speech samples would be compared against allowed responses, and a match along with probability of accuracy would be sent to the Halcyon main processor.|$|R
50|$|Golden-i {{headsets}} {{feature a}} 15-inch virtual laptop-size qHD microdisplay manufactured by Kopin Corporation {{which can be}} adjusted to be used below {{the left or right}} eye, 9-axis head-tracking technology with a digital compass and GPS, speech recognition software with two <b>noise-cancelling</b> <b>microphones</b> (supporting 38 languages), Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and USB connectivity, 3D graphics accelerators. The 18650 Li-ion battery will last 8+ hours. The latest Golden-i Gen 3.8 headset computer also has built-in 14MP camera.|$|R
5000|$|Most {{external}} microphone {{designs are}} of either omnidirectional or <b>noise-canceling</b> type. <b>Noise-canceling</b> <b>microphone</b> headsets use a bi-directional microphone as elements. A bi-directional microphone's receptive field has two angles only. Its receptive field {{is limited to}} only the front and the direct opposite back of the microphone. This create an [...] "8" [...] shape field, and this design is the best method for picking up sound only from a close proximity of the user, while not picking up most surrounding noeous noise.|$|R

40|$|A {{subsystem}} for {{the adaptive}} suppression of noise {{in a voice}} communication system effects {{a high level of}} reduction of noise that enters the system through microphones. The subsystem includes a digital signal processor (DSP) plus circuitry that implements voice-recognition and spectral- manipulation techniques. The development of the adaptive noise-suppression subsystem was prompted by the following considerations: During processing of the space shuttle at Kennedy Space Center, voice communications among test team members have been significantly impaired in several instances because some test participants have had to communicate from locations with high ambient noise levels. Ear protection for the personnel involved is commercially available and is used in such situations. However, commercially available <b>noise-canceling</b> <b>microphones</b> do not provide sufficient reduction of noise that enters through microphones and thus becomes transmitted on outbound communication links...|$|R

40|$|When {{a system}} must process spoken {{language}} in natural environments that involve different types {{and levels of}} noise, the problem of supporting robust recognition {{is a very difficult}} one. In the present studies, over 2, 600 multimodal utterances were collected during both mobile and stationary use of a multimodal pen/voice system. The results confirmed that multimodal signal processing supports significantly improved robustness over spoken language processing alone, with the largest improvement during mobile use. The multimodal architecture decreased the spoken language error rate by 19 - 35 %. In addition, data collected on a command-by-command basis while users were mobile emphasized the adverse impact of users' Lombard adaptation on system processing, even when a <b>noise-canceling</b> <b>microphone</b> was used. Implications of these findings are discussed for improving the reliability and stability of spoken language processing in mobile environments...|$|R

40|$|Modern {{ultrasound}} scanners are portable {{and have}} become very useful for clinical diagnosis. However, they have limitations for field use purposes, primarily because they occupy both hands of the physician who performs the scanning. The goal of this thesis {{is to develop a}} wearable voice-controlled ultrasound scanner system that would enable the physician to provide a fast and efficient diagnosis. This is expected to become very useful for emergency and trauma applications. A commercially available ultrasound scanner system, Terason 2000, was chosen as the basis for development. This system consists of a laptop, a hardware unit containing the RF beamforming and signal processing chips and the ultrasound transducer. In its commercial version, the control of the ultrasound system is performed via a Graphical User Interface with a Windows-application look and feel. In the system we developed, a command and control speech recognition engine and a <b>noise-canceling</b> <b>microphone</b> are selected to control the scanner using voice commands. A mini-joystick is attached {{to the top of the}} ultrasound transducer for distance and area measurements and to perform zooming of the ultrasound images. An eye-wear viewe...|$|R
5000|$|The {{development}} is a special case of the differential microphone topology most commonly used to achieve directionality. All such microphones {{have at least two}} ports through which sound enters; a front port normally oriented toward the desired sound and another port that's more distant. The microphone's diaphragm is placed between the two ports; sound arriving from an ambient sound field reaches both ports more or less equally. Sound that's much closer to the front port than to the rear will make more of a pressure gradient between the front and back of the diaphragm, causing it to move more. The microphone's proximity effect is adjusted so that flat frequency response is achieved for sound sources very close {{to the front of the}} mic [...] - [...] typically 1 to 3 cm. Sounds arriving from other angles are subject to steep midrange and bass rolloff. Commercially and militarily useful <b>noise-canceling</b> <b>microphones</b> have been made since at least 1935, Amelia Earhart used one on her 1935 flight from Hawaii to California [...] and have been made since the 1940s by Roanwell, Electro-Voice and others.|$|R
40|$|A {{prototype}} field-deployable acoustic insect flight detector {{was constructed}} from a <b>noise-canceling</b> <b>microphone</b> coupled to an off-the-shelf digital sound recorder capable of 10 h recordings. The system {{was placed in}} an urban forest setting 25 times {{over the course of}} the summer of 2004, collecting 250 h of ambient sound recordings that were downloaded to a personal computer and used to develop detection routines. These detection routines operated on short segments of sound (0. 093 s, corresponding to 4096 samples at 44100 Hz). A variety of approaches were implemented to detect insect flight tones. Simple approaches, involving sensing the fundamental frequency (1 st harmonic) and 2 nd harmonic, were capable of detecting insects, but generated large numbers of false positives because of other ambient sounds including human voices, birds, frogs, automobiles, aircraft, sirens, and trains. In contrast, combining information from the first four harmonics, from the interharmonic regions, and from the sound envelope, reduced false positives greatly. Specifically, in the 250 h of recordings, 726 clear insect buzzes were detected by the final algorithm, with only 52 false positives (6. 5 %). Running the final algorithm with all criteria liberalized by 20 % increased the number of clear insect buzzes by 8 %, to 784, but increased false positives to 471 (28 % of total detections). The potential of using this approach for detecting mosquito activity using low-cost sensors is discussed...|$|R
