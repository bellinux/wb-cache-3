25|$|The {{defendants}} {{also argued}} that Steinberg was estopped from defending his copyright {{on the grounds that}} he had taken no action over a period of eight years to stop others from counterfeiting his posters and adapting his idea to other locations, and had not acted in response to newspaper ads promoting the movie. The court rejected this argument, holding that the defendants had not proved any of the elements of estoppel: (1) a representation in fact; (2) reasonable reliance thereon; and (3) injury or damage resulting from denial by the party making the representation. While the defendants argued that Steinberg had made a representation of his acquiescence to their use of his image in the movie poster by <b>not</b> <b>complaining</b> about the ads in the newspaper, the judge rejected this line of reasoning and noted that the defendants had continued to use the infringing advertisements even after becoming aware of Steinberg's objections. Further, there was no existing relationship between the parties that could give rise to estoppel.|$|E

This competition is followed by a haggadic explanation of the form of the various letters and by interpretations of the different compositions of the alphabet: AT BSH, AḤS BṬ'A, and AL BM.|$|E

Ferrari meanwhile got the two fastest times of the session, with Räikkönen a full half a second faster than his Brazilian team-mate. Williams were close up behind Alonso, as BMW were running lower in the field than usual. Although Kubica was <b>not</b> <b>complaining,</b> Nick Heidfeld said that [...] " [...] was difficult to drive, so {{we have to figure out}} why." [...] Christian Klien got a drive during the practice to replace Button in the car and help set it up. Both of the works Hondas were beaten by both of the Super Aguri cars and Davidson improved on his time and position to tenth.
