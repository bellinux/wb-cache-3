5|$|Although {{not usually}} {{identified}} as a genre writer, William S. Burroughs produced works with a surreal <b>narrative</b> <b>that</b> estranged the action from the ordinary world as science fiction and fantasy do. In 1959 he published Naked Lunch, {{the first of many}} works such as The Nova Trilogy and The Wild Boys in which he linked drug use and homosexuality as anti-authoritarian activities.|$|E
5|$|The Dalits {{strongly}} believe in his piety and portray Brahmins as {{the root cause}} of all the misery of the Nayanar. Nandanar fits in the Dalit <b>narrative</b> <b>that</b> proves that their religiosity is on par or superior to the higher castes. They say that Nandanar was 'swallowed by God'. The sashes round Nataraja's waist are interpreted as the legs of the saint, who merged into the god.|$|E
5|$|The {{style of}} {{narrative}} writing, {{in this passage}} and throughout the piece, was alien to journalism at the time, and was considered the province of fiction writing. Only a few other authors, such as Tom Wolfe, were using such techniques in journalistic writing. The piece employed techniques like scenes, dialogue and third-person <b>narrative</b> <b>that</b> were common in fiction, but still rare in journalism.|$|E

5|$|François-René de Chateaubriand {{depicted}} the massacre in his 1827 epic Les Natchez, incorporating his earlier best-selling novellas Atala and René into a longer <b>narrative</b> <b>that</b> greatly embellished {{the history of}} the French and the Natchez in Louisiana. In Chateaubriand's work, the grand conspiracy behind the massacre implausibly included native tribes from all across North America. Chateaubriand saw the Natchez Massacre as the defining moment in {{the history of the}} Louisiana colony, a position consistent with the views of other 18th-century historians, such as Le Page du Pratz and Dumont de Montigny.|$|E
5|$|In 2006–2010, artist Park Kun-woong and Chung Eun-yong {{published}} Nogunri Story, a two-volume graphic <b>narrative</b> <b>that</b> {{told the}} story of the massacre, and the half-century struggle for the truth, through thousands of drawings, based on Chung's 1994 book. The Korean-language work was also published in translation in Europe. In the United States and Britain, No Gun Ri was a central or secondary theme in five English-language novels, including the U.S. National Book Award finalist Lark & Termite of 2009, by Jayne Anne Phillips, and the James Bond thriller Trigger Mortis of 2015, by British author Anthony Horowitz.|$|E
5|$|Lewis {{argues that}} Applewhite {{effectively}} controlled his followers by packaging his teachings in familiar terms. Richard Hecht of the University of California, Santa Barbara, echoes this sentiment, arguing {{that members of}} the group killed themselves because they believed the <b>narrative</b> <b>that</b> he had constructed, rather than because he psychologically controlled them. In his 2000 study of apocalyptic movements, John R. Hall posits that they were motivated to commit suicide because they saw {{it as a way to}} demonstrate that they had conquered the fear of death and truly believed Applewhite.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} influences on History of a Six Weeks' Tour was Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark (1796), written by Mary Shelley's mother Mary Wollstonecraft. A travel <b>narrative</b> <b>that</b> reflects on topography, politics, society, aesthetics, and the author's personal feelings, it provided a model for Mary Shelley's work. Like her mother, Mary Shelley revealed her liberalism by boldly discussing politics; however, this political tone was unusual for travel works at the time and was considered inappropriate for women writers. Like Wollstonecraft's Letters, History of a Six Weeks' Tour blurs the line between private and public spheres by using intimate genres such as the journal and the letter, allowing Mary Shelley to present political opinions through personal anecdote and the picturesque.|$|E
5|$|The Autobiography of Malcolm X was {{published}} in 1965, {{the result of a}} collaboration between human rights activist MalcolmX and journalist Alex Haley. Haley coauthored the autobiography based on a series of in-depth interviews he conducted between 1963 and MalcolmX's 1965 assassination. The Autobiography is a spiritual conversion <b>narrative</b> <b>that</b> outlines MalcolmX's philosophy of black pride, black nationalism, and pan-Africanism. After the leader was killed, Haley wrote the book's epilogue. He described their collaborative process and the events at the end of MalcolmX's life.|$|E
5|$|The {{cooperative}} Spartan Ops mode originally {{began as}} a Firefight-type mode, similar to that featured in Halo: Reach, but was composed of different objective-oriented mission types. Over the course of development, changes were made to Spartan Ops to include a <b>narrative</b> <b>that</b> would tie Halo 4s multiplayer together. The missions were designed primarily for four player co-op. The Spartan Ops development team worked with the narrative team to use ideas and storylines to shape the mode such that the cinematics would tie in with the missions.|$|E
40|$|<b>Narratives</b> <b>that</b> prompt inferences {{can be more}} {{interesting}} in that they provide the reader {{with the opportunity to}} reason about the narrative world, participating in its construction. These narratives can also be more concise and direct, as details can be filled in by the reader. On the other hand, <b>narratives</b> <b>that</b> leave out important information without the opportunity to infer this information may be incoherent. To generate <b>narratives</b> <b>that</b> prompt inferences a system must 1) employ a theory of how inferences are prompted and 2) provide a capacity for creating <b>narratives</b> <b>that</b> satisfy inference goals. This paper presents is a novel algorithm for generating discourse plans that prompt inferences according to a theory of online inferencing in narrative discourse. Though other approaches have generated narrative and discourse structures to influence the reader’s perception of the narrative, this is the first approach to present an empirically based cognitive model of online inference generation. The algorithm is a partial-order planning approach to discourse generation, selecting events to tell the reader from an input story plan...|$|R

5000|$|Following Kirkwood, Scott R. Stroud is {{particularly}} interested in [...] "multivalent narratives," [...] or <b>narratives</b> <b>that</b> include a variety of seemingly contradictory values or positions that force a reader to reconstruct their meaning, thereby enabling positive judgments of narrative fidelity and the adoption of new values for their own lives. In a later study, Stroud examines other Indian philosophical texts to further categorize the types of multivalent <b>narratives</b> <b>that</b> creatively use contradictory elements to enable judgments of narrative fidelity.|$|R
5|$|Uncle Tom's Cabin first {{appeared}} as a 40-week serial in The National Era, an abolitionist periodical, starting with the June 5, 1851, issue. It was originally intended as a shorter <b>narrative</b> <b>that</b> would run {{for only a few}} weeks. Stowe expanded the story significantly, however, and it was instantly popular, such that several protests were sent to the Era office when she missed an issue. Because of the story's popularity, the publisher John P. Jewett contacted Stowe about turning the serial into a book. While Stowe questioned if anyone would read Uncle Tom's Cabin in book form, she eventually consented to the request.|$|E
5|$|With {{the fall}} of the Han, I Ching {{scholarship}} was no longer organized into systematic schools. The most influential writer of this period was Wang Bi, who discarded the numerology of Han commentators and integrated the philosophy of the Ten Wings directly into the central text of the I Ching, creating such a persuasive <b>narrative</b> <b>that</b> Han commentators were no longer considered significant. A century later Han Kangbo added commentaries on the Ten Wings to Wang Bi's book, creating a text called the Zhouyi zhu. The principal rival interpretation was a practical text on divination by the soothsayer Guan Lu.|$|E
5|$|Another {{encounter}} {{connected to}} the <b>narrative</b> <b>that</b> was advertised for Turning Point was Kurt Angle versus Abyss in a Falls Count Anywhere match. After Angle lost to Jeff Jarrett at Bound for Glory IV, Angle challenged Jarrett to a rematch, which was refused on the October16 episode of Impact!. To get Jarrett to accept his challenge, Angle assaulted several wrestlers in TNA. On the October23 episode of Impact!, Angle challenged Jarrett to a rematch for the second time. Jarrett refused the offer for a second time, but recommended a casualty of Angle's attacks, Abyss, as Angle's opponent. On the October30 episode of Impact!, a contest between Angle and Abyss ended in a disqualification after Angle struck Abyss with a steel chair. Following their encounter, a match was promoted pitting Angle against Abyss in a Falls Count Anywhere match at Turning Point. Angle won the bout at the show.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This study {{investigates the}} local {{response}} to place-based {{economic and social}} decline in a small working-class town in central Pennsylvania. Critical analytic attention {{is given to the}} meeting point between global economic structure and local context as embodied in community discourse. A classification scheme is developed herein in which prominent narratives are categorized according to their response to the hegemonic account that all places can be successful if the people composing them are willing to work hard enough; identified are <b>narratives</b> <b>that</b> comply, <b>narratives</b> <b>that</b> deny, and <b>narratives</b> <b>that</b> defy. It is proposed that within the latter group lies a budding ???discourse of local resistance??? to the destructive spatial outcomes produced by capitalism, and that revitalization efforts in this declining town should focus more on developing the community that exists and less on uncertain attempts to attract outside attention and investment...|$|R

5|$|Mushishi {{opens with}} Yoki {{and his mother}} walking along a {{mountain}} when a cliff suddenly collapses. This {{is followed by a}} nonlinear <b>narrative</b> <b>that</b> moves between the past and the present. A series of flashbacks reveal that only Yoki survived, coming under the care of Nui, who is a Mushishi (or Bugmaster)—an expert in Mushi, which are supernatural bug-like creatures that are invisible to most humans. She lives near a pond where {{there are two types of}} Mushi: a fish-like Ginko who swims in the darkness-like Tokoyami. Because Nui spent too long looking at the Ginko, one of her eyes and the color of her hair were altered by the shadow of Tokoyami. Eventually, Nui is swallowed by the Tokoyami. When Yoki tries to help her, he is also swallowed. Only by sacrificing one of his eyes and his memories is Yoki able to survive. He then renames himself Ginko because it is the only name he can remember.|$|E
5|$|Narayan's next novel, The Man-Eater of Malgudi, was {{published}} in 1961. The book was reviewed as having a <b>narrative</b> <b>that</b> is a classical art form of comedy, with delicate control. After the launch of this book, the restless Narayan once again took to travelling, and visited the U.S. and Australia. He spent three weeks in Adelaide, Sydney and Melbourne giving lectures on Indian literature. The trip was funded by a fellowship from the Australian Writers' Group. By this time Narayan had also achieved significant success, both literary and financial. He had a large house in Mysore, and wrote in a study with no fewer than eight windows; he drove a new Mercedes-Benz, a luxury in India at that time, to visit his daughter who had moved to Coimbatore after her marriage. With his success, both within India and abroad, Narayan started writing columns for magazines and newspapers including The Hindu and The Atlantic.|$|E
5|$|Other {{types of}} {{religious}} texts give {{evidence for the}} myth, such as two Middle Kingdom texts: the Dramatic Ramesseum Papyrus and the Ikhernofret Stela. The papyrus describes the coronation of Senusret I, whereas the stela alludes to events in the annual festival of Khoiak. Rituals in both these festivals reenacted elements of the Osiris myth. The most complete ancient Egyptian account of the myth is the Great Hymn to Osiris, an inscription from the Eighteenth Dynasty (c. 1550–1292 BCE) that gives the general outline of the entire story but includes little detail. Another important source is the Memphite Theology, a religious <b>narrative</b> <b>that</b> includes an account of Osiris's death {{as well as the}} resolution of the dispute between Horus and Set. This narrative associates the kingship that Osiris and Horus represent with Ptah, the creator deity of Memphis. The text was long thought to date back to the Old Kingdom (c. 2686–2181 BCE) and was treated as a source for information about the early stages {{in the development of the}} myth. Since the 1970s, however, Egyptologists have concluded that the text dates to the New Kingdom at the earliest.|$|E

5|$|Set on {{the prosperous}} Long Island of 1922, The Great Gatsby {{provides}} a critical {{social history of}} America during the Roaring Twenties within its fictional <b>narrative.</b> <b>That</b> era, known for unprecedented economic prosperity, the evolution of jazz music, flapper culture, new technologies in communication (motion pictures, broadcast radio, recorded music) forging a genuine mass culture; and bootlegging, along with other criminal activity, is plausibly depicted in Fitzgerald's novel. Fitzgerald uses these societal developments of the 1920s to build Gatsby's stories from simple details like automobiles to broader themes like Fitzgerald's discreet allusions to the organized crime culture which {{was the source of}} Gatsby's fortune. Fitzgerald educates his readers about the garish society of the Roaring Twenties by placing a timeless, relatable plotline within the historical context of the era.|$|E
5|$|The group {{received}} {{an influx of}} funds in the late 1970s, which it used to pay housing and other expenses. In 1985, Nettles died, leaving Applewhite distraught and challenging his views on physical ascension. In the early 1990s the group took more steps to publicize their theology. In 1996, they learned of the approach of Comet Hale–Bopp and rumors of an accompanying spaceship. They concluded that this spaceship was the vessel that would take their spirits on board for a journey to another planet. Believing that their souls would ascend to the spaceship and be given new bodies, the group members committed mass suicide in their mansion. A media circus followed the discovery of their bodies. In the aftermath, commentators and academics discussed how Applewhite persuaded people to follow his commands, including suicide. Some commentators attributed his followers' willingness to commit suicide to his skill as a manipulator, while others argued that their willingness was due to {{their faith in the}} <b>narrative</b> <b>that</b> he constructed.|$|E
5|$|The storyline of {{the game}} {{was based on the}} final novel in Nishitani's trilogy, Tensei no Shuuen, {{although}} taking its title from the first novel, Megami Tensei. Nishitani was deeply involved in planning the game, contributing suggestions and advice for the project. According to Okada, a major issue during development was faithfully following the novel's plot due to the limited hardware space on the Famicom cartridge, together with the necessity of creating a compelling gameplay experience. With this in mind, the team picked out key parts the novel's plot to include in the game while cutting out non-essential elements. One element that was not included was the questionable morality of the main protagonist, which was a prominent feature in the novels. Suzuki later commented that it was only because they were working with Namco, which included mature character designs and the heavy use of religion in its <b>narrative,</b> <b>that</b> the game was ever released. The Cerberus demon, which would become a recurring feature in later Megami Tensei games, was a homage to the narrative of Nishitani's trilogy, at the same time emulating the trend for games to have a marketable mascot or character.|$|E
