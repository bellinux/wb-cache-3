5|$|These {{features}} {{have made}} Gibraltar a naturally strong defensive position. The isthmus lacks any <b>natural</b> <b>cover,</b> exposing any approaching enemy to opposing fire. The heights of the Rock form a natural barrier to movement and rocky ledges provide natural platforms for gun batteries. The sheer cliffs {{on the north}} and east sides of the Rock block access from those directions and the sea cliffs around {{the southern end of the}} peninsula make landings there difficult, especially if opposed. A single road connects Gibraltar with Spain, and within the territory most roads are narrow and often steep due to the restricted land area. Over the centuries, Gibraltar's successive occupants have built an increasingly complex set of fortifications around, on top of and incorporating the territory's natural features.|$|E
5|$|Unknown to Montgomery, he was {{promoted}} to major general on December 9 for his victories at St. Johns and Montreal. After Montgomery was unable to convince Carleton to surrender, he placed several mortars a few hundred yards outside the walls of the city. The shelling of the city began on December 9, but after several days it had failed to make a serious impact on the walls, the garrison, or the civilian population. With the shelling having little effect, Montgomery ordered the emplacement of another battery closer towards the city walls, on the Plains of Abraham, despite the fact it offered little <b>natural</b> <b>cover</b> from returning fire. On December 15, the new batteries were ready and Montgomery sent a party of men under the flag of truce to ask for the city's surrender. However, they were turned away. Montgomery then resumed firing on the city, but the effect was little better. When the new batteries were hit by more effective fire from the British, Montgomery ordered their evacuation.|$|E

40|$|Human actions, such as {{converting}} <b>natural</b> land <b>cover</b> {{to agricultural}} or urban land, {{result in the}} loss and fragmentation of natural habitat, with important consequences {{for the provision of}} ecosystem services. Such habitat loss is especially important for services that are supplied by fragments of <b>natural</b> land <b>cover</b> and that depend on flows of organisms, matter, or people across the landscape to produce benefits, such as pollination, pest regulation, recreation and cultural services. However, our quantitative knowledge about precisely how different patterns of landscape fragmentation might affect the provision of these types of services is limited. We used a simple, spatially explicit model to evaluate the potential impact of <b>natural</b> land <b>cover</b> loss and fragmentation on the provision of hypothetical ecosystem services. Based on current literature, we assumed that fragments of <b>natural</b> land <b>cover</b> provide ecosystem services to the area surrounding them in a distance-dependent manner such that ecosystem service flow depended on proximity to fragments. We modeled seven different patterns of <b>natural</b> land <b>cover</b> loss across landscapes that varied in the overall level of landscape fragmentation. Our model predicts that <b>natural</b> land <b>cover</b> loss will have strong and unimodal effects on ecosystem service provision, with clear thresholds indicating rapid loss of service provision beyond critical levels of <b>natural</b> land <b>cover</b> loss. It also predicts the presence of a tradeoff between maximizing ecosystem service provision and conserving <b>natural</b> land <b>cover,</b> and a mismatch between ecosystem service provision at landscape versus finer spatial scales. Importantly, the pattern of landscape fragmentation mitigated or intensified these tradeoffs and mismatches. Our model suggests that managing patterns of <b>natural</b> land <b>cover</b> loss and fragmentation could help influence the provision of multiple ecosystem services and manage tradeoffs and synergies between services across different human-dominated landscapes...|$|R
500|$|Located on {{a narrow}} strip of land {{southeast}} of Port Fouad, Fort Budapest was surrounded by water on two sides. The fort came under air and artillery strikes at 14:00. A Sa'iqa company cut off the only route to the fort for reinforcements, while a battalion attacked from Port Fouad, advancing along a narrow strip of land bereft of <b>natural</b> <b>cover.</b> The battalion's attack bogged down at the minefield, which was [...] deep. It soon came under air attacks, as the fort was outside of the SAM [...] "umbrella", and faced stiff resistance from the fort's garrison. The battalion eventually broke off its attack and retreated, while the Sa'iqa unit east of the fort prevented reinforcements from reaching the fort for four days before it too withdrew. Another attack on October 15 came close to succeeding but ultimately failed, and hence Fort Budapest became the only position of the Bar Lev Line to be remain in Israeli hands.

2500|$|Staff {{officers}} of the German IV Corps wrote {{a report on the}} experience of fighting the British in July, which dwelt on the details of the defensive battle, in which emphasis was given to fortification, the co-operation of infantry and artillery and the necessity for maintaining communications, using every means possible, to overcome the chaos of battle. British infantry had learnt much since the Battle of Loos (25 September – 14 October 1915) and attacked vigorously, which was assumed to be due to the confidence of the infantry in their overwhelming artillery. British tactical leadership was considered to be lacking and men tended to surrender if surrounded. Units were assembled close together and suffered many losses to German artillery but the British showed skill in rapid consolidation of captured ground and tenacity in defence, small parties with automatic weapons being most difficult to overcome. German infantry remained confident that they were superior to British infantry but British medium and heavy artillery outnumbered German guns and the quality of its ammunition had improved. German infantry and artillery positions were subjected to methodical bombardment, villages just behind the front line and ground affording <b>natural</b> <b>cover</b> were continuously bombarded and artillery registration and aim were assisted by organised aerial observation, aircraft also frequently being used to bomb villages at night. British frontal attacks by cavalry against infantry and had suffered [...] "heavy losses", reflecting badly on the tactical knowledge of British higher commanders.|$|E

60|$|Continuous firing {{occupied}} the 28th, and at 5.30 P.M. the enemy again assaulted. As in previous attacks, they at first advanced by twos and threes, making little dashes over the open ground, for bits of <b>natural</b> <b>cover,</b> {{and for the}} stone sungars they had built all round the fort under cover of darkness. Some of these were within 200 yards of the wall. As they advanced the fire became intense. Then the main rush was delivered. In a great semi-circle round {{the face of the}} fort held by the cavalry, and displaying nearly 200 standards whose gay colours were representative of every tribe on the border, they charged right up to the walls. Some of them actually got across the tangled barbed wire and were destroyed in the enclosure. But all efforts were defeated by the garrison, and towards morning the attack melted away, and only the usual sharpshooters remained. Some of these displayed a singular recklessness. One man climbed up into the barbed wire and fired three shots at the defenders at close quarters before he was killed.|$|E

This did not, however, divert the Indian, who, trotting still doggedly on, paused only to examine another footprint--much more frequent--the smooth, inward-toed track of moccasins. The thicket grew more dense and difficult as he went on, yet he seemed to glide through its density and darkness--an obscurity that now seemed to be stirred by other moving objects, dimly seen, and as uncertain and intangible as sunlit leaves thrilled by the wind, yet bearing a strange resemblance to human figures! Pressing a few yards further, he himself presently became a part of this shadowy procession, which on closer scrutiny revealed itself as a single file of Indians, following each other in the same tireless trot. The woods and underbrush were full of them; all moving on, as he had moved, in a line parallel with the vanishing coach. Sometimes through the openings a bared painted limb, a crest of feathers, or a strip of gaudy blanket was visible, but nothing more. And yet only a few hundred yards away stretched the dusky, silent plain--vacant of sound or motion! ...|$|E
