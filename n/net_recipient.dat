40|$|We use the Vietnam Living Standard Survey {{conducted}} in 1993 and in 1998 {{to analyze the}} determinants of private transfers among rural farmers. Private transfers are widespread and important relative to pre-transfer income levels of recipients in both years.

Pre-transfer income is positively related to the net donor status and negatively associated with the <b>net</b> <b>recipients</b> status, especially for low levels of income. These results suggest that crowding-out of public redistributive policies targeted to the rural poor might be an issue {{to take into account}} in Vietnam. ...|$|R

This analysis helped in explaining the link between strategic decisions of the Spanish MNCs and their choice of geography and industrial sector. Empirical analysis finds Spanish MNCs responded to privatisation opportunities and to gain access to specific foreign markets rather than to an attempt to create global export platforms. ...|$|E

A balanced view requires that the gains from integration be set against this cost. Drawing on established theories of economic integration, this paper first identifies typical fallacies present in policy-oriented thinking about gains from trade liberalization {{and the role of}} preferential trading blocs like the EU. Using detailed data on east-west trade for each of the present member states, as well as the relevant trade barriers of the EU and applicant countries, it then presents empirical estimates on the likely orders of magnitude for integration gains.

40|$|This paper aims to {{disentangle}} {{the impact}} of multiple transmission channels in interbank connectedness. We use the identification properties of a structural vector autoregression with a multivariate GARCH-in-mean structure (SVAR-MGARCH-M) to model the dynamics in equity returns of the Eurozone systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs). We can identify the impacts of multiple transmission channels such as asset communality, interbank deposits, and information contagion. Asset communality is both {{a factor in the}} transmission of shocks and a means of diversification: heightened connectedness results in an increase in shock spillovers, which are countered by risk sharing benefits. We show that connectedness increased during the financial crisis with a major role for common exposures. Institutions move from being a <b>net</b> <b>recipient</b> to a net transmitter of shocks when the asset communality channel is taken into account, suggesting that we need to evaluate the systemic importance of an institution using all transmission components...|$|E
40|$|This paper aims {{to examine}} the {{relationship}} between foreign direct investment and the globalization. The Portuguese economy has been a <b>net</b> <b>recipient</b> of FDI. Understanding the main determinants of FDI inflows is important to take the macroeconomic policy decisions. The manuscript analyses the determinants of FDI in Portugal for the period 1990 - 2008. Instrumental variable estimation of a dynamic panel model within a system generalized methods moments framework allows us to control for potential correlation issues and endogeneity bias. The results show that the market size and globalization have a positive impact on FDI. Openness trade and urban population are also statistically significant. The paper confirms some relevant theoretical hypotheses on the causes of the FDI. The good results obtained with the GMM system estimator suggest that the building of dynamic theoretical model will be of interest to academic researches in FDI theory. ...|$|E

The United States was by far the major source of direct investment outflows in the early 1970 s, but Europe caught up to the United States in the 1980 s and Japan almost did, before fading in the 1990 s. The United States shifted from being the largest net supplier of direct investment to absorbing much of the world's supply, especially in the late 1980 s, and then reverted to its earlier net supplier role. Direct Investment flows have been the least volatile source of international investment for most countries, the chief exception being the United States, which has flipped back and forth from dominant net supplier to dominant <b>net</b> <b>recipient,</b> and back to dominant net supplier.

40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{efficiency}} of the pattern of public spending when two asymmetric economies are not perfectly integrated and their pri-vate sectors are imperfectly competitive. We show that tax harmoniza-tion constrains the low productivity country to set higher subsidies for firms. Moreover, while households located in the low productivity country seem to be the net contributors of their public sector regard-less the level of trade costs, residents of the more advanced country may shift from a position of net contributors to <b>net</b> <b>recipients</b> when trade costs are low enough. Finally, we isolate two main externalities suggesting that a coordinated policy increasing the public spendings for households in both countries will be beneficial. Thus, with a very different framework, our results seem to confirm the robustness of the main conclusion of Keen and Marchand (1997) : governments could spend too much for firms and the inefficiency arising from competition for multinationals concerns both the level of taxation and the resulting pattern of public spending...|$|R
