Taking over the worsening dispute on the northern coalfields, he believed the struggle to be communist-inspired and made possible by unemployment relief and child endowment and attempted to resolve an industrial dispute by supporting the use of <b>non-union</b> <b>labour</b> in the Rothbury coal mine. The resultant protests led to the Rothbury Riot {{and the death of}} one miner. His suspension of unemployment relief gained him many enemies from the Labor Party. This promotion proved short-lived however, when the Bavin Government was defeated at the October 1930 election, at which Weaver was returned with 65.42%, by Jack Lang's Australian Labor Party.|$|E

5000|$|In 1887 William Shand, aide-de-camp to the Queensland Governor Anthony Musgrave, was sharply {{critical}} of the fanciful promises made to immigrant workers to make their fortune in a so-called workers paradise, when in fact poorer workers lived in wooden shanties cobbled together from old biscuit boxes and wine cases. Shand was even more alarmed at how the growing trade union movement was drafting new arrivals into unions, these labor organisations already having had some success in hiking up wages and blocking <b>non-union</b> (scab) <b>labour.</b> At this time, 1877, there were 2,500 union members registered under the Queensland Trade Union Act. By 1890 this number had ballooned more than eight-fold to 21,500. Even Liberals were {{caught up in the}} excitement. In 1889 Samuel Walter Griffith, barrister and 9th Premier of Queensland, after being defeated by the conservative Thomas McIlwraith in 1888, wrote radical articles advocating state intervention to curb capitalism, redistribute wealth, protect the weak and enforce the rule of freedom. Griffith's radical reformer phase was short lived however, as in 1890 he suddenly betrayed his radical friends and became Premier again at the head of an unlikely alliance with McIlwraith, forming the so-called [...] "Griffilwraith" [...] government. Also on the political front, Thomas Glassey became Australia's first Labour parliamentarian, representing Ipswich coalminers. He was joined in 1890 by John Plumper Hoolan. Early industrial action had international support, with the British Seamen's Union backing the Queensland Shearers Union to victory in the Jondaryan dispute, by blocking transport and handling of Jondaryan wool bales.|$|R

500|$|In September 1928, Leane {{provided}} {{police protection}} to non-union strikebreakers {{brought in to}} work on the Port Adelaide wharves to circumvent a dispute over the industrial award that covered the waterfront.

There were suggestions that communists were interfering in internal union deliberations to resolve the matter. A week later, the continued employment of <b>non-union</b> <b>labour</b> resulted in significant violence on the waterfront. On the morning of 27 September, a crowd of between 4,000–5,000 unionists and others overran the Port Adelaide wharves, boarding ships and injuring and intimidating strikebreakers. That afternoon, a crowd of 2,000 marched the [...] from Port Adelaide to Outer Harbor to confront the strikebreakers working there. Leane, accompanied by just one inspector, met the leaders and attempted to dissuade them from entering the wharf area. Instead, the crowd surged forward towards the docks. But Leane, his inspectors and about 150 mounted and foot police immediately set into motion plans to first break up the mass of the crowd among the buildings, then cordon off a significant portion of it in an open allotment. For some time they remained at a stalemate, but the crowd eventually dispersed having been unable to approach any of the strikebreakers or the vessels they were working on. The unionists had attacked a number of police and police horses, there had been a considerable amount of stone throwing by the crowd, and the police had used their batons freely at times. The events of the day were described in The Register as [...] "probably without parallel in the history of the state".|$|E
40|$|There {{has been}} a great deal of {{research}} regard the effects of unions on union – non-union wage gap. Most of the studies regarding the impact of unions on wages have assumed that apart from the division between union and <b>non-union</b> workers, the <b>labour</b> market is relatively homogeneous. A number of economists, however, have argued that the labour market is segmented, implying that there are distinct labour markets and that some workers employment opportunities are concentrated in “bad jobs” while other workers employment opportunities are concentrated in “good jobs” which are rationed. This paper will explore whether the relative wage differential between union and non-union workers differs between the independent primary, subordinate primary and secondary labour markets. Labour market segments are defined using “job zones”. “Job zones” are distinct groups defined by the level of specific vocational preparation necessary for a particular occupation, allowing for the comparison of skill levels and training for each occupation. The data on “job zones” comes from the Occupational Information Network database (O∗Net). We estimate separate equations for union and non-union workers in each segment using data from the Current Population Survey and calculate union non-union differentials for each labour market segment. The findings of this paper suggest that the greatest differentials are in secondary labour markets followed by differentials in the subordinate primary labour market and that the smallest wage differentials are in the independent primary labour market...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{patterns of}} power relations between waterfront workers and waterfront employers {{during the years}} 1953 to 1993. It argues that the key actors on each side, and the relationships between them, were constituted by the Waterfront Industry Act 1953 which established a 'bureau system' of labour administration. This legislative intervention created an occupational registration scheme which was complemented by the registration, as legal entities, of the main organized interests within the labour market - the unions and the employers' organization. The relationships between these actors are explored at three separate (although overlapping) levels: employment relations, industrial relations and work relations. Using these categories, an analysis of two distinct periods is presented: the break-bulk era (1953 - 1971) and the container era (1972 - 1986). The thesis concludes {{with a discussion of}} the period after deregulation (1987 - 1993). The thesis demonstrates that unions were empowered by the bureau system of labour administration by being granted formal 'joint control' of certain crucial aspects of the labour supply. The resulting union strength was constituted in and through a blend of local and national bargaining together with the judicious use of strike action. At the level of work relations, the bureau system exacerbated the inherent problems of control associated with the performance of work by gangs. This produced a particular pattern of work relations which centred on the wage-effort bargain. In the break-bulk era, this pattern led to a tension between the organization of the labour market and the wage-form. Despite this tension, watersiders had considerable control of work practices. This control was carried over to the period after containerization. In the relationship between firms and the labour market, the study reveals that firm size was as much a function of the type of labour market, as the type of labour market was a function of firm size. As well as empowering the unions, the bureau system secured the existence of small firms. These, the most significant, unintended consequences of this system intersected in the 1970 s when several unions became involved in establishing small new entrant stevedoring companies. Key developments in ownership and control followed containerization. Rather than containerization resulting in pervasive vertical integration, this process occurred unevenly and was accompanied by a parallel process of vertical disintegration. Instead of large vertically integrated shipping companies becoming the main players within stevedoring, a number of new types of organizations and firms entered the field. This fragmentation of waterfront employers at an economic level became a persistent source of employer disunity which significantly impacted upon outcomes within the spheres of employment relations, industrial relations and work relations during the 1970 s and 1980 s. The resulting dynamic of union strength and employer weakness only began to be eroded after the institutional and legislative supports of the unions were systematically dismantled by state reformers in the late 1980 s. The effects of the bureau system in producing considerable union control, set limits upon what could be achieved by both state reformers and employers in the period after deregulation. All attempts to restructure the industry have come up against the barrier of labour that is already unionized and well-organized. Port reform has, however, allowed a new space for small firms, operating now as stand alone players in the labour market. These small firms have the greatest potential to erode the last remnants of the bureau system, in the union's control of the labour supply, by reintroducing <b>non-union</b> casual <b>labour</b> into the industry...|$|R
