25|$|Innovative {{solutions}} {{have been}} conceived {{to deal with}} nutrient pollution in aquatic systems by altering or enhancing natural processes to shift nutrient effects away from detrimental ecological impacts. Nutrient remediation {{is a form of}} environmental remediation, but concerns only biologically active nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus. “Remediation” refers to the removal of pollution or contaminants, generally for the protection of human health. In environmental remediation nutrient removal technologies include biofiltration, which uses living material to capture and biologically degrade pollutants. Examples include green belts, riparian areas, natural and constructed wetlands, and treatment ponds. These areas most commonly capture anthropogenic discharges such as wastewater, stormwater runoff, or sewage treatment, for land reclamation after mining, refinery activity, or land development. Biofiltration utilizes biological assimilation to capture, absorb, and eventually incorporate the pollutants (including nutrients) into living tissue. Another form of nutrient removal is bioremediation, which uses microorganisms to remove pollutants. Bioremediation can occur on its own as <b>natural</b> <b>attenuation</b> or intrinsic bioremediation or can be encouraged by the addition of fertilizers, called biostimulation.|$|E

Not all isolates are equally pathogenic, however, and several isolates have been characterized as naturally virulence attenuated. We sought {{to identify the}} genetic basis of <b>natural</b> virulence <b>attenuation</b> using cell culture assays and molecular techniques. By comparing the phenotypes of naturally virulence-attenuated isolates to those of defined virulence gene mutants in plaque, cytotoxicity, and hemolysis assays and by characterizing selected virulence genes and their expression using DNA sequencing and TaqMan reverse transcriptase PCR, we classified virulence-attenuated isolates into four categories. Both group A and group B isolates were noncytotoxic and nonhemolytic; however, group A isolates underexpressed listeriolysin O (LLO, encoded by hlyA), while group B isolates produced LLO proteins that were inactive. The single isolate in group C was fully cytotoxic, had higher than wild-type hemolytic activity, and was, therefore, likely virulence attenuated due to overexpression of LLO. Group D isolates were characterized by normal cytotoxicity, hemolytic activity, and hlyA expression but had reduced intracellular growth. The genetic mechanisms causing virulence-attenuated phenotypes among the group D isolates could not be determined definitively but may involve defects in the expression of actA or {{the function of the}} ActA protein. Our results show (i) that the combination of cell culture assays and molecular techniques used in this study allows for identification and characterization of naturally virulence-attenuated isolates and (ii) that multiple distinct genetic mechanisms are responsible for <b>natural</b> virulence <b>attenuation</b> in L. monocytogenes...|$|R

As the number of parameters increases, convergence rates approach that of the ideal plant inverse algorithm.

Such an approach, whilst defying the popular view of flood and coastal management, is likely to lead to sustainable form, and lower maintenance and capital investment costs in the long-term.

Characterization of the precipitates and sediments from the stream bed was performed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray-fluorescence (XRF), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). The aqueous concentration of arsenic and iron decreases markedly from the adit mouth to 300 m downstream due to precipitation of iron oxides and iron oxyhydroxysulfates, which can retain trace elements by coprecipitation and/or sorption processes.

40|$|Negative {{environmental}} impacts of landfill operations have led to establishment of stringent legislation on dumping of wastes in landfills. Emphases {{have been put on}} integration of various disciplines where experts from engineering, geology, hydrology and chemistry collaborate to ensure construction of landfills that pose less risks to the environment. Revdalen landfill has neither liners nor leachate collection system, reflecting luck of interdisciplinary collaboration in its construction, which must have been due to lack of adequate information in the year of its construction (1974). This is a report on a 23 -year study of groundwater chemistry of the aquifer polluted by leachate emanating from Revdalen Landfill. The study aimed to characterise the organic and inorganic compositions of the groundwater, identify the processes governing <b>natural</b> <b>attenuations,</b> and further examine effects of landfill age, landfill closure and season on the groundwater quality. Groundwater samples were taken twice a year from wells established using Waterloo Multilevel Groundwater Monitoring System and separate multilevel sampling wells. The samples were analysed for several chemical parameters. Results showed substantial input of mainly inorganic pollutants from the landfill. Seasonal dynamics on groundwater quality has indicated slightly higher concentrations of pollutants in dry season (autumn) than in wet season (spring). The results further demonstrated that, closing the landfill was followed by decrease in concentrations of contaminants in groundwater. Generally, concentrations of all the parameters were found {{to be on the verge}} of attaining the natural background level as the age of the landfill approached 21 years. The seasonal variations could be due to dilution in wet season and concentration effect in dry season, whereas that of landfill closure could partly be due to initiation of reducing condition that immobilised pollutants, and in part due to controlled infiltration of precipitation that would otherwise lead to wash out of pollutants. The decrease in concentrations of pollutants with age was probably a result of landfill stabilisation, when most of the contaminants would have been leached out. The redox conditions responsible for attenuation processes have been identified in the order of increasing distance from the landfill as; sulphate reducing, iron reducing, manganese reducing, nitrate reducing and finally aerobic condition. The feasibility of the aquifer acting as a treatment plant for the pollutants was very substantial, thus eliminating any serious environmental risk associated with the emanating leachate...|$|R

40|$|As {{the second}} part of a series of four, this paper reviews a number of case studies of <b>natural</b> uranium <b>attenuation</b> in peat, as well as {{underlying}} chemical mechanisms reported in literature. Based on this review, a generic, conceptual, model for peat to act as filter for dissolved uranium (U) is developed for guiding subsequent field investigations. The model consists of a chemical and an hydraulic component which is derived largely from data reported in literature as well as from limited field observations. For the chemical model component 10 different processes, each controlled by factors relating to water chemistry, have been identified to govern the attenuation of U in peat via a net balance of immobilization and remobilization. For the hydraulic aspect of the filter model, five different principal modes of U polluted water coming in contact with peat are discussed, focusing on the associated peat-water contact time as a crucial parameter controlling chemical U attenuation. Moreover, links between the two model components are discussed and, based on the integrated conceptual model, possible effects of natural and anthropogenic events on U attenuation in peatlands are outlined. Guided by the model, various site-specific field and laboratory investigations are finally designed to verify how far the identified generic factors and processes are indeed applicable to the Gerhard Minnebron Peatland...|$|R

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to provide a basis for quantifying the ability of red sandstone to oxidise dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and determine if results of experiments on synthetic minerals can be applied to geological materials. Ascorbic acid (H_ 2 A) was used as a probe. Preliminary experiments revealed that it can reductively dissolve sandstone hematite and Mn oxide as research on synthetic minerals had previously shown. Sorption of H_ 2 A to sandstone was similar to that seen for synthetic hematite (a two-slope linear isotherm). Anoxic batch experiments were undertaken under biotic and abiotic conditions. Release of Fe and Mn was found to be dependent on the concentration of H_ 2 A and pH. Decrease in H_ 2 A concentration exceeded increase in Fe and Mn concentrations corrected for sorption, and this was modelled by sorption of both ascorbate and dehydroascorbic acid. The rate of H_ 2 A oxidation was higher in biotic experiments than in abiotic experiments, probably due to the differences in pH rather than bacterial presence. The rate of ascorbic acid oxidation by natural oxides was higher than found by previous researchers for synthetic hematite. This result was not expected, and only in part can be ascribed to the effect of Mn oxides. However, the mechanism of reductive dissolution determined by the synthetic mineral studies appear relevant also to the sandstone system. Many questions remain but the study shows that the sandstone provides a significant <b>natural</b> oxidative <b>attenuation</b> capacity and that the results of experimentation on synthetic minerals can only be applied qualitatively...|$|R
50|$|The {{combination}} {{concept of}} ATES and enhanced <b>natural</b> <b>attenuation</b> (ATES-ENA) {{can possibly be}} used in the Netherlands and China, especially in urbanized areas. These areas in both countries are confronted with organic groundwater contaminations. Currently, the combination concept may be better applicable for the Netherlands with more mature technology and application of ATES. And the overlapping between ATES and groundwater contamination also promotes the need of this combined technology. However, for China where ATES is much less developed compared to the Netherlands, the important advantages are that many more demonstration pilot projects can be set-up prior to real applications, and flexible systems can be developed because of the less intense pressure on subsurface use by ATES compared to the Netherlands. For sustainable urban development, the combined ATES-ENA technology can provide contributions to the solution of both energy and environmental problems.|$|E

Petroleum hydrocarbons, less chlorinated solvents like vinyl chloride, soil organic matter, and reduced inorganic compounds are all compounds that can act as electron donors.

The vacuum extraction of soil gas induces gas flow across a site, increasing the mass transfer driving force from aqueous (soil moisture), non-aqueous (pure phase), and solid (soil) phase into the gas phase. Air flow across a site is thus a key aspect, but soil moisture and subsurface heterogeneity (i.e., a mixture of low and high permeability materials) can result in less gas flow across some zones.

50|$|Naturally {{occurring}} {{within the}} soil are microbial populations that utilize hydrocarbons {{as a source}} of energy and Carbon. Upwards to twenty percent of microbial soil populations have the ability to metabolize hydrocarbons. These populations can through either accelerated or <b>natural</b> monitored <b>attenuation</b> be utilized to neutralize within the soil hydrocarbon pollutants. The metabolic mode of hydrocarbon remediation is primarily aerobic. The end products of the remediation for hydrocarbons are Carbon Dioxide and water. Hydrocarbons vary in ease of degradation based on their structure. Long chain aliphatic carbons are the most effectively degraded. Short chained, branched, and quaternary aliphatic hydrocarbons are less effectively degraded. Alkene degradation is dependent on the saturation of the chain with saturated alkenes being more readily degraded. Large numbers of microbes with the ability to metabolize aromatic hydrocarbons are present within the soil. Aromatic hydrocarbons are also susceptible to being degraded through anaerobic metabolism. Hydrocarbon metabolism is an important facet of in situ bioremediation due to the severity of petroleum spills around the world. Polynuclear aromatic carbons susceptibility to degradation is related to the number of aromatic rings within the compound. Compounds with two or three rings are degraded at an effective rate, compounds possessing four or more rings can be more resilient to bioremediation efforts. Degradation of polynuclear aromatic carbons with less than four rings is accomplished by various aerobic microbes present in the soil. For larger compounds the only metabolic mode that has shown to be effective is cometabolism. The fungus genus Phanerochaete under anaerobic conditions has species with the ability to metabolize some polynuclear aromatic carbons utilizing a peroxidase enzyme.|$|R

Some progress in this direction for SRCT is being made, using a variety of contrast agents that alter the <b>natural</b> x-ray <b>attenuation</b> of the marked tissue [1]. However there are limits to the usefulness of these attenuation altering techniques. Often high concentrations of potentially disruptive chemicals are required with reduced compatibility for in-vivo studies. Another image highlighting technique which might prove more sensitive is x-ray fluorescence imaging. In this case usually endogenous elemental markers are visualised. We would like to develop a lower resolution, but wider field of view means of three-dimensional (3 -D) fluorescence imaging compatible with SRCT. We have previously proposed a technique in which x-ray fluorescence CT (FXCT) and SRCT data can be collected simultaneously [2]. This work resulted in proof of concept modelling, and a simple experiment test system. We show data here which demonstrate a two-dimensional (2 -D) reconstruction of an iodine fluorescence map from a phantom. Measurements were performed with a fixed beam modulating mask using the Imaging and Medical beam line (IMBL) at the Australian Synchrotron. Fluorescence data was obtained during a CT scan using a single point detector, while transmission data was simultaneously collected using an area detector. A maximum likelihood expectation maximisation (MLEM) iterative algorithm was used to reconstruct the fluorescence map.
