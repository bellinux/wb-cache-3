40|$|Transgender {{identities are}} as {{divergent}} as transgender experiences, {{but they are}} also often constructed and negotiated through and in opposition to medical and legislative discourse and practice. For these groups identity formation is complex, often problematic within existing classificatory systems, and limited linguistic possibilities that rest upon a male/female gender binary not always able to account for different practices and experiences of gender and sexual diversity. The paper analyses the impact of medical, psychiatric, legal frameworks on transgendered identities, and the constraints they impose. It explores the contribution made by art and cinema in providing non-traditional images and ideas that help transgendered people to form and articulate their identity to themselves and to the <b>non-transgendered</b> public. It examines the ways in which art and cinema articulate identities transgressive of the binary framework of male and female, to give representation and expressive reality to the multiple perspectives of transgendered live...|$|R
40|$|Two {{hundred and}} four Thai Male-to-Female (MtF) transgenders (mean age 23. 0 years) {{completed}} questionnaires designed to examine self-concept (actual and ideal) and gender-trait stereotypes held towards men and women. Findings indicated that (a) participants' gender-trait stereotypes {{were similar to}} those of <b>non-transgenders</b> examined in other studies (both in their own country and internationally), (b) their actual and ideal self-concepts each displayed much more consensus about traits not possessed than about those possessed, (c) their actual and ideal self-concepts were commonly discrepant, and (d) while they commonly held a stereotypically female view of themselves, they often aspired towards a broad range of traits that were less stereotyped. Indeed, (e) they commonly disowned stereotypically female traits. These last two findings suggest that transgenders have personal growth goals that transcend, or even run counter to, gender-stereotype.

40|$|This study aims {{to look at}} the {{challenges}} faced by women of low socio-economic status in exiting sex work, in a South African context where gender-based violence is normalized and widespread. In doing so, this research applies principles of feminist theory to create a contextualized understanding of the process of exit. Two focus groups, with a total of 18 <b>non-transgendered</b> women were conducted in an informal setting, resulting in an open-ended discussion around these challenges. These interviews were recorded, transcribed and analyzed using thematic analysis. The categories and themes emerging from this analysis were past trauma, motherhood, partnerships, social support, economic necessity, employment and gossip. These themes are permeated by a pattern of escapism. This pattern exemplifies their disempowerment and lack of agency, which is symptomatic of the gender oppression pervading their lives. The results of this research will be used to draw up a policy in collaboration with the NGO Embrace Dignity, for parliament, to initiate legal reform relating to sex work...|$|R

A sample of 62 individuals (30 transgender consisting of 22 male to female or MTF transgender and eight female to male or FTM transgender, and 32 <b>non-transgender</b> consisting of 24 males and eight females), male and females, between the age range of 18 - 40 years, and minimum educational qualification till class eight were selected after a basic interview and screening.

Results: Authoritative parenting style was found to be significantly lower for both the parents {{of the participants in the}} transgender group. On the contrary, authoritarian parenting was found to be significantly higher for both the parents in the transgender group. Conclusions: The study indicated that among the transgender group, both the parents fail to provide safe and nurturing emotional climate which has been found to be contributory to healthy development and respectful of an individual.

MethodsLogistic regressions were used to examine the associations between gender groups and selected outcomes in a nationally representative high school health and well-being survey, undertaken in  2012. ResultsOf the students (n = 8, 166), 94. 7 % reported being <b>non-transgender,</b> 1. 2 % reported being transgender, 2. 5 % reported being not sure about their gender, and 1. 7 % did not understand the question.

Transgender men (assigned birth sex of female) differed from cisgender men across many psychosocial factors, including having more recent employment, less legal system involvement, greater incidence of living with a substance abuser, and greater family conflict, while transgender women (assigned birth sex of male) were less likely to have minor children than cisgender women. Transgender women reported greater needle use, and HIV testing rates were greater among transgender women.

40|$|The {{experience}} of shame is universal, and {{has long been}} studied. However, shame experiences of cisgender (<b>non-transgender)</b> women who identify as having relationships primarily or exclusively with other cisgender women are not well understood. Additionally, research about same-sex relationships between women is sparse. In this study, 100 women who identify as having relationships with other women completed an online survey exploring their personal experiences of shame, and how these experiences have impacted their intimate partnerships. The survey instrument was developed using Shame Resilience Theory (SRT), and addressed several shame categories: others??? expectations of me; appearance; body image; relationships; money; work; perceived expectations of motherhood/fatherhood; family; parenting; being perceived as weak; mental health; physical health; addiction; sex; aging; religion; expectations I have of myself; surviving trauma; and being stereotyped or labeled. Of these categories, eight emerged as the most significant to participants: others??? expectations of me; expectations I have of myself; sex; body image; appearance; family; being perceived as weak; and relationships.

40|$|Background. Whereas {{reciprocal}} {{relationships between}} autobiographical memory and self are broadly emphasized, {{there is no}} empirical research that examines how major life changing transitions affect the graphically expressed life story. Objective. The paper focuses on the novel topic of autobiographical memory in transsexual individuals. Design. Twenty-eight volunteers who had undergone gender-affirming surgery and 28 <b>non-transgender</b> {{participants were asked to}} produce a Life Line which required them to identify the most memorable events in their lives. The level of acquisition of affirmed gender-typed traits was measured by the Bem Sex-Role Inventory (BSRI). Results. Compared to cisgender individuals, transsexual participants have self-focused Life Lines with a high proportion of vivid flashbulb-like memories and unhappy recollections of childhood. The emotional profile of autobiographical memory addressing childhood was more negative in transsexual participants who deviate from BSRI norms reflecting derogation of past gender category in favour of affirmed gender identity. Those with high acquisition of affirming gender-typed traits assigned more space on the timeline for childhood, revealing the process of self-continuity restoration that leads to an increase in the proportion of positive memories. Accordingly, transsexuals recollected fewer events relevant to their gender identity performing a psychological defence toward the topic of gender. Conclusion. We interpreted the results by focusing on the utility of autobiographical memories as a cognitive resource for filling the gap between past and current selves and maintaining self-continuity across the lifespan...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} closed access until 20 th April 2018. Background: Transgender people (those who feel incongruence between the gender they were {{assigned}} at birth and their gender identity) engage in lower levels of physical activity compared to cisgender (<b>non-transgender)</b> people. Several factors {{have been shown to}} affect physical activity engagement in the cisgender population; however, the physical activity experiences of young transgender adults have not been explored. It is therefore the aim of the current study to understand what factors are associated with physical activity and sport engagement in young transgender adults who are medically transitioning. Method: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 14 young transgender adults (18 – 36 years) who had initiated their medical transition at a transgender health service in the United Kingdom. The data were analyzed using thematic analysis. Results: Two main themes were identified: (1) barriers and (2) facilitators to physical activity and sport. Overall, the young transgender adults were insufficiently active due to inadequate changing facilities, body dissatisfaction, fears surrounding “passing” and not being accepted by others. At the same time, participants were motivated to engage in physical activity to increase their body satisfaction and gender congruence. However, participants felt {{there was a lack of}} safe and comfortable spaces to engage in physical activity and sport. Conclusion: Young transgender adults who are medically transitioning experience several barriers to physical activity and sport, despite being motivated to be physically active. Initiatives to facilitate young transgender adults’ ability to put their motivations into practice (i. e. to be more physically active) are needed...|$|E
40|$|Few bodies {{consistently}} portray {{natural or}} unaltered forms. Instead, humans inhabit bodies imbued with sociocultural meanings {{about what is}} attractive, appropriate, functional, and presentable. As such, embodiment is always gendered. The social, extra-corporeal body is a central locus for expressing gender. Surgical body modifications represent inherently gendered technologies of the body. But psychomedical institutions subject people who seek gender-crossing surgeries to increased surveillance, managing and regulating cross-gender embodiment as disorderly. Using mixed research methods, this research systematically compared transgender and cisgender (<b>non-transgender)</b> people’s experiences before, during, and after surgical body modification. I conducted a content analysis of 445 threads on a message board for an online cisgender surgery community, an analysis of 15 international protocols for transgender-specific surgeries, and 40 in-depth interviews with cisgender and transgender people who had surgery. The content analysis of the online community revealed similar themes among cisgender and transgender surgery users. However, detailed protocols existed only for transgender consumers of surgery. Interview findings showed that transgender and cisgender people reported similar presurgical feelings toward their bodies, similar cosmetic and psychological motivations for surgery, and similar benefits of surgery. For both cisgender and transgender people, surgery enhanced the inner self through improving the outer gendered body. Despite these similar embodied experiences, having a cisgender gender status determined respondents’ abilities to pursue surgery autonomously and with institutional support. Ultimately, this research highlights inequalities that result from gender status and manifest in psychomedical institutions by identifying the psychosocial impacts of provider/consumer or doctor/patient interactions, relating gendered embodiment to regulatory systems of authority, and illuminating policy implications for clinical practice and legal classifications of sex and gender...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{research}} has shown that gender transition of one partner in a relationship impacts the non-transitioning partner’s sense of identity, emotional wellbeing and their relationship with their transgender partner. This topic is under-researched and very little of this {{research has}} examined the wider social implications of being a partner of a person making a gender transition. To date no published research of this kind has been conducted in New Zealand. This project explored the experiences of the former and current cisgender (<b>non-transgender)</b> partners of people transitioning from one gender to another. In particular the project explored how cisgender partners felt their partners’ transition impacted on them and their relationships, as well as how they experienced the disclosure of their partners’ transgender identity. Six participants (four were separated from their partners, five women, one man, aged 21 to 39 years, all identified as non-heterosexual except one) were recruited through advertising via social media and support groups. Participants took part in in-depth semi-structured one-on-one interviews; these were transcribed and analysed using interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA). Three superordinate themes and ten subthemes were found. They were: “Coming Out as a Process”; “Support”; and “Changes to the Relationship and Self”. Many of the participants experienced their partners’ disclosure as transgender as a gradual and shared process. Participants felt that their partners’ transition shaped their relationships and themselves in different ways and responded to their partners’ transition with a range of emotions and cognitions. Participants generally felt supported by others but felt {{there was a lack of}} understanding, support and resources that were specific to their needs. There is clear need for good sources of support for cis partners. Future research efforts could usefully explore the support needs of partners of transitioning people and the best ways to distribute this support...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is based}} on nearly two years of multi-sited ethnographic observations and seventy-two semi-structured interviews documenting the religious lives of queer and transgender Jews in Boston and Los Angeles. My primary analytic interest is in how LGBTQ Jews adapt their religious lives {{in response to the}} privileging of heterosexuality and cisgender (<b>non-transgender)</b> identity, or even homophobia/transphobia, in normative Judaism. I explore how queer and transgender Jews are assimilated, or not, into normative frameworks of Jewish law, theology, ritual/liturgy, and religious spaces. Previous ethnographic research on queer religious communities within the field of Religious Studies has sometimes given minimal attention to queer and transgender theory and to gender nonconforming and transgender participants; in contrast, my work asserts the central importance of transgender participants and queer/transgender theory to such projects. My first chapter focuses on the function of LGBTQ and/or Jewish organizations as well as synagogues in fostering LGBTQ community and inclusion in Jewish spaces. The second chapter explores the interplay between Jewish and LGBTQ identity in politics and activism with regard to Israel and Palestine, a topic that can be polarizing in both LGBTQ and Jewish communities. The third and fourth chapters analyze the disparate ways actors within normative institutional Judaism, as well as transgender Jews, address inclusion. I consider a conversation amongst rabbis on inclusion for transgender converts as well as transgender-affirming rituals created by and for transgender Jews, arguing that institutional Judaism’s normative framework, which values cisgender bodies and binary gender, may result in assimilating transgender Jews into normative Judaism, or more radically, ostracizing them. In contrast to this assimilative approach for incorporating transgender Jews, I map the ways transgender Jews have created affirmation for themselves within Judaism through innovating rituals that engage Jewish tradition to celebrate transgender identities and lives...|$|E

There {{is evidence that}} transgender individuals and LGB individuals both experience similar types of discrimination; however, there are important differences between those who identify as transgender (one’s gender identity) and those who identity as LGB (one’s sexuality). The present study provides qualitative data from 20 American officers and 19 English and Welsh constables on a particularly under-researched group within criminology: transgender police. Drawing upon theoretical perspectives from criminology, sociology and social psychology, this study examines if gender ideologies and hypermasculinity are monolithic across police cultures. By doing so, the reinforcement of gender binaries which impact gender ideologies and hypermasculinity were perceived as endemic, yet administratively addressable. The purpose {{of this research is}} to examine how transgender identities are perceived and how they are treated within policing. This research answers the following research questions: what are police perceptions towards transgender officers, and what are the consequences of these perceptions?; what are the occupational experiences and perceptions of officers who identify as transgender within policing?; and what are the reported positive and negative administrative issues that transgender individuals face within policing?. This research found that cisgender (i. e. <b>non-transgender)</b> police, particularly those who are heterosexual, collectively viewed LGB and transgender identities as violating conventional gender ideologies. Further, this research found that transgender police faced varied amounts of heterosexism and genderism based on how well they were able to conform to masculine or feminine ideals in addition to how their occupational transition was administratively managed. Yet some hopeful themes were found that are promising for the future acceptance of additional transgender identities within policing. For example, administrative improvements, such as supportive supervision and leadership alongside transition policies, can improve the occupational experiences of transgender officers and reduce the frequency of bias incidents, complaints and grievances. Further, it was discovered that officers who work alongside transgender colleagues are more understanding of transgender identities and certain social barriers that they face...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Researchers have {{attempted}} to modify some measures of religiosity/spirituality to address disparities in examining practices and beliefs in non-European minority groups; however, no one has modified or tested religion scales to address disparities between transgender and <b>non-transgender</b> populations. Research using existing scales proved inadequate with a female-to-male transsexual (FTM) population. To begin to modify instruments for applicability to a FTM population requires gaining more knowledge about this population with regard to religion. Research shows individuals who are transgender face resistance to and rejection of their identities beginning early in life. Reliance on majority religions and their concepts of divinity, embodiment [...] one's experience of having a particular body [...] and views of immutable, or essential, human qualities based on sex assigned at birth, may create significant problems when interacting with transgender populations. The significance {{of this study is}} in learning how a sample of FTMs conceptualize and experience religion to effect more competent interactions with this marginalized people. Interactions based on increased competency with and understanding of FTMs will contribute to improved long-term health outcomes and overall quality of life for this population. Further, exploring the experiences and beliefs of FTMs may challenge our assumptions and understandings about gender itself, expanding our knowledge about human experience of embodiment, and offering insights into traditional concepts of creation and humanity. RESULTS: This study reports a qualitative investigation of the understanding and experience of religion held by six FTM individuals. All participants completed five or more years of cross-sex hormone treatment with testosterone and identified as male. Methods from Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) guided analysis of semistructured interviews and sample size. Four common themes are presented: rejection of early concepts of religion; connection with others; construction of a way of life; and provision of a source of redefinition and reincarnation. The participants' understandings of religion do not principally parallel those in commonly studied populations. The study's most significant finding is that every participant had a fundamental break from religious tradition as he learned it. The researcher concludes by offering preliminary recommendations for clinical interventions and future research...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender (LGBT) youth face {{health disparities}} linked to {{societal}} stigma and {{discrimination based on}} their sexual orientation and/or gender identity. Depressive symptoms, feelings of prolonged hopelessness or sadness, suicidal ideation, and suicide attempts are considerably more likely for sexual minority and transgender youth than for heterosexual and <b>non-transgender</b> youth. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to understand the current state of LGBTQ youth suicide research and to propose a program plan for an LGBTQ youth-focused suicide prevention intervention. The author utilized two main research strategies for developing the plan: first, a PubMed literature search was executed to identify peer-reviewed literature on LGBT youth suicide prevention interventions. Second, a grey literature search was conducted to locate existing evidence-based suicide prevention interventions for the general youth population that may be useful for LGBTQ youth. Results from the PubMed literature search indicate that no LGBT-specific evidence-based interventions to reduce suicide risk are currently available. However, the grey literature search found that a number of evidence-based interventions for suicide prevention among the general youth population exist and contain elements that may be adapted for an LGBTQ-specific program. The author selected four evidence-based programs that have been reviewed and included in the Suicide Prevention Resource Center’s Best Practices Registry (BPR) based on their potential for adaptation for LGBTQ youth. The grey lit review also yielded a list of recommendations for agencies serving youth for developing more LGBT-inclusive programming published by the Suicide Prevention Resource Center. The author identified core elements of the four existing programs and designed new elements based on the SPRC’s recommendations to directly target LGBT-specific risk factors for suicide, and combined these to create “Protecting Our Youth: A Suicide Prevention Program for LGBTQ Youth and Allies (POY). ” The public health significance of this work is that it advances our understanding of the unique mental health needs of LGBTQ youth. Using a strong base of public health theory along with an extensive review of LGBTQ health research, the proposed program provides the basis of a potentially efficacious program for reducing suicide-related outcomes among members of a vulnerable population...|$|E
