The Cyprus Assay Office (CAO) is {{under the jurisdiction of}} the Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Tourism. The Cyprus Hallmark consists of three compulsory symbols: 1. The manufacturer's mark - Consists of the initials of the manufacturer of the article surrounded by a small shield; 2. The fineness mark - The purity of the metal, in parts per thousand; 3. The official mark - the Head of Aphrodite until December 2001 and a ship as from January 2002 denotes that the article is made of Gold, and the fish that the articles is made of Silver. The manufacturer's mark must be struck on the articles by the manufacturer before its submitted to the Assay Office for Hallmarking. The manufacturer may make arrangements for the manufacture's mark to be struck by the Assay Office upon submission of the article to be struck with the approved hallmarks. The manufacturer's mark which is registered under the relevant section of the Law shall include the initial letters of the name or names of the manufacturer and shall be of such design as may be approved by the Assay Office. The <b>standards</b> <b>of</b> <b>fineness</b> <b>of</b> Gold and Silver articles that are hallmarked are for gold : 375, 585, 750 and 916 parts per thousand; for silver: 800, 830 and 925 parts per thousand; no negative tolerance is permitted on the above <b>standards</b> <b>of</b> <b>fineness.</b>|$|R

50|$|Weight is {{commonly}} measured {{using one of}} two methods. A spring scale or hydraulic or pneumatic scale measures local weight, the local force of gravity on the object (strictly apparent weight force). Since the local force of gravity can vary by up to 0.5% at different locations, spring scales will measure slightly different weights for the same object (the same mass) at different locations. To standardize weights, scales are always calibrated to read the weight an object would have at a <b>nominal</b> <b>standard</b> gravity <b>of</b> 9.80665 m/s2 (approx. 32.174 ft/s2). However, this calibration is done at the factory. When the scale is moved to another location on Earth, {{the force of gravity}} will be different, causing a slight error. So to be highly accurate, and legal for commerce, spring scales must be re-calibrated at the location at which they will be used.|$|R
40|$|RESUMEN: Este artículo {{describe}} la difusión universal del real de a ocho desde los siglos XVI al XVIII. Múltiplo del real, la moneda de plata por excelencia de Castilla, esta pieza sirvió de medio de pago en Europa, en el Báltico, en el Mediterráneo Oriental, en el Extremo Oriente y, por supuesto, en el interior del continente americano. El análisis de las causas y consecuencias de su expansión da pie a repasar los flujos internacionales del dinero y el cuadro de la división internacional del trabajo durante la Edad Moderna. Mercaderes y banqueros de todo el mundo respetaban el real de a ocho porque sabían que era una moneda que conservó intactas durante más de siglo y medio sus características intrínsecas, pero la estabilidad de su peso y su ley fueron la causa, precisamente, de su drenaje desde Castilla hacia el exterior. Se concluye que, si bien, desde siempre se ha asociado la moneda fuerte a la hegemonía, poder y prosperidad de una entidad política y que, en líneas generales, Castilla en su cénit no sería una excepción, sin embargo, a diferencia de la libra o del dólar, la moneda española de plata no estuvo respaldada por una economía potente. ABSTRACT: This article {{deals with}} the worldwide spread of a Spanish coin called real de a ocho from the 16 th to the 18 th century. Múltiple of the real (1 real de a 8 equals 8 reales), this typically castilian silver coin {{was used as a}} means of payment in Europe, the Baltic lands, Eastern Mediterranean áreas, the Far East and, of course, the inner American continent. Thanks to an analysis of the causes and consequences of its expansión, it is possible here to review the way money flew internationally and to sketch the international labour división in the early modern period. Merchants and bankers all over the world accepted the real de a ocho because they were aware of its intrinsic features, which had been left untouched {{for more than a century}} and a half. Due to its weight and legal <b>standard</b> <b>of</b> <b>fineness,</b> this coin flew regularly from Castile abroad. Finally although it has been claimed that a valuable coin is always linked to a hegemonic political power and Castile followed this rule to a great extent, we draw the conclusión that the Spanish silver coin was not correlated to a steady economic framework, as was the case with the pound or the dollar. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{accuracy}} of the parasitological techniques of Willis, Hoffman-Pons-Janer or Lutz (HPLJ), Sheather and Faust was evaluated in fecal samples from stray cats caught by the Zoonosis Control Center in Goiânia, Goiás, Brazil. These four techniques were applied separately to analyze 154 fecal samples, and their accuracy was analyzed based on an evaluation of their sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and Kappa index, resulting {{in the selection of}} the Willis technique as the <b>nominal</b> gold <b>standard.</b> <b>Of</b> the 154 samples, 115 (74. 68 %) tested positive for intestinal parasites. The analysis of the frequency of positivity indicated that the HPLJ technique detected 86. 1 % of the positive samples and was the closest to the gold <b>standard.</b> The analysis <b>of</b> the {{accuracy of}} the techniques was evaluated using the most prevalent parasites. The Sheather technique showed the highest accuracy in the detection of Ancylostomatidae, while the Sheather and HPLJ techniques showed similar accuracies in the detection of Cystoisospora spp. when compared to the gold standard. Lastly, the Faust technique showed the highest accuracy in the detection of Toxoplasma gondii when compared to the gold standard.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{presents}} the effect <b>of</b> <b>fineness</b> <b>of</b> fly ash on expansion of fly ash-cement mortar in magnesium sulfate solution. Fly ash from the Mae Moh {{power plant in}} Thailand was classified in to three different levels <b>of</b> <b>fineness</b> <b>of</b> Blaine of 3215, 4440 and 5890 cm 2 /g with a median particle size of 25. 57, 7. 69, and 4. 81 microns, respectively. Fly ash at each level <b>of</b> <b>fineness</b> was used to replace Portland cement type I and type V at percentages of 0, 20, 30, and 40 by weight of the cementitious material, to cast mortar bars of 2. 5 x 2. 5 x 30 cm 3. Expansion of the fly ash-cement mortar bars, which were immersed in 5 % by weight of magnesium sulfate solution, were measured {{at the age of}} 1 to 540 days. The results showed that the replacement of Portland cement type I and type V by fly ash reduced expansion of the mortar bars. When the same level <b>of</b> <b>fineness</b> and same percent of replacement of fly ash were used in the mortar bars, the replacement of Portland cement type V by fly ash produced less expansion than that of Portland cement type I. For the same level <b>of</b> <b>fineness</b> <b>of</b> fly ash, the mortar bars made with 40 % fly ash replacement had less expansion than those made with 20 and 30 % replacement. The mortar bars with 20 - 25 % replacement of fine fly ash (Blaine <b>fineness</b> <b>of</b> 4440 or 5890 cm 2 /g) and the mortar bars with 40 % replacement of original fly ash (Blain <b>fineness</b> <b>of</b> 3125 cm 2 /g) had the same expansion. The smaller particle size of fly ash not only reduced expansion of the fly ash-mortar bars but also produced higher strength activity index of mortar than the bigger particle size of fly ash. Therefore, very fine fly ash could be used effectively for reducing the expansion and improving sulfate resistance of mortar...|$|R
