5|$|Poison {{was given}} a {{secondary}} outfit for Capcom Fighting All-Stars alongside her primary classic attire. Made of shiny, silvery material it consisted of boots that extended halfway up her thighs and a combined sleeveless shirt/short skirt with a plunging <b>neckline.</b> Gloves and a small hairband were also added, {{as well as a}} belt, with the handcuffs hanging off of it. Her arm straps were removed, though the strap around her neck remained.|$|E
5|$|Portrait of a Lady (or Portrait of a Woman) {{is a small}} oil-on-oak panel {{painting}} executed around 1460 by the Netherlandish painter Rogier van der Weyden. The {{composition is}} built from the geometric shapes that form {{the lines of the}} woman's veil, <b>neckline,</b> face, and arms, and by the fall of the light that illuminates her face and headdress. The vivid contrasts of darkness and light enhance the almost unnatural beauty and Gothic elegance of the model.|$|E
5|$|Christus frames his sitter in a {{rigid and}} {{balanced}} architectural setting. She is positioned within a narrow rectangular space, before a wainscotted wall. The image is {{divided by the}} horizontal parallel lines of her wainscot and blouse, which join at the inverted triangle formed by the <b>neckline</b> of her dress. The rendering of the background departs somewhat from contemporary conventions in portraiture: Christus sets the girl against a dark brown wall with little detail, {{in contrast to the}} elaborate interiors of Jan van Eyck, who is often regarded as Christus' master. It is defined entirely by its material, a wooden dado rail along the top and the wainscot that forms the lower portion. The wall sets her in a realistic interior, perhaps intended to represent a space within her home.|$|E

5|$|Mansfield's {{publicity}} antics {{are another}} recurring theme in popular culture. On the season 32 episode of Saturday Night Live hosted by Alec Baldwin (with musical guest Christina Aguilera), {{one of the}} commercial bumpers has Alec Baldwin PhotoShopped into the famous picture of Sophia Loren staring at Mansfield's chest at Romanoff's in Beverly Hills. It was a direct reference to publicity stunt of Mansfield in April 1957 intended to deflect attention from Loren during a dinner party in the Italian star's honor. Photographs of the encounter were published around the world. The most famous image showed Loren raising a contemptuous eyebrow at the American actress who, sitting between Loren and her dinner companion, Clifton Webb, had leaned over the table, allowing her breasts to spill over her low <b>neckline</b> and exposing one nipple. The photo of Sophia Loren sitting next to Jayne Mansfield and regarding her cleavage inspired other photographers too. In 1993, Daniela Federici created an homage with Anna Nicole Smith as Mansfield and New York City DJ Sky Nellor as Loren for a Guess Jeans campaign. Later, Mark Seliger took a picture named Heidi Klum at Romanoff's with Heidi Klum in a reproduction of the restaurant set. The meeting between Mansfield and Anton LaVey, the founder and high priest of the Church of Satan, was a much publicized and oft quoted event of her life, {{as well as the}} history of the Church.|$|E
25|$|Décolletage is {{the upper}} part of a woman's torso, between her waist and neck, {{comprising}} her neck, shoulders, back and chest, that is exposed by the <b>neckline</b> of her clothing. However, the term is most commonly applied to a <b>neckline</b> that reveals or emphasizes cleavage.|$|E

25|$|Many {{women of}} this era remarked upon how being fully dressed meant the bosom and {{shoulders}} were bare, and yet being under-dressed would mean one's <b>neckline</b> went {{right up to}} one's chin.|$|E
25|$|Open-fronted bodices {{could be}} filled {{in with a}} {{decorative}} stomacher, and {{toward the end of}} the period a lace or linen kerchief called a fichu could be worn to fill in the low <b>neckline.</b>|$|E
25|$|The style had waxed and waned {{in fashion}} for {{hundreds}} of years. The shape of the dresses also helped to lengthen the body’s appearance. The clothing can also be draped to maximize the bust. Lightweight fabrics were typically {{used to create a}} flowing effect. Also, ribbon, sash, and other decorative features were used to highlight the waistline. The empire gowns were often with low <b>neckline</b> and short sleeves and women usually worn them as evening dresses. On the other hand, day gowns had higher <b>neckline</b> and long sleeves. The chemisette was a staple for fashionable ladies. Although there were differences between day dresses and evening dresses, the high waistline was not changed.|$|E

25|$|The robe à la française or sack-back gown, {{with back}} pleats hanging loosely from the <b>neckline,</b> long worn as court fashion, made its last {{appearance}} {{early in this}} period. A fitted bodice held {{the front of the}} gown closely to the figure.|$|E
25|$|The mantua or manteau {{was a new}} {{fashion that}} arose in the 1680s. Instead of a bodice and skirt cut separately, the mantua hung from the {{shoulders}} to the floor (in the manner of dresses of earlier periods) started off as the female version of the men's Banyan, worn for 'undress' wear. Gradually it developed into a draped and pleated dress and eventually evolved into a dress worn looped and draped up over a contrasting petticoat and a stomacher. The mantua-and-stomacher resulted in a high, square <b>neckline</b> {{in contrast to the}} broad, off-the-shoulder <b>neckline</b> previously in fashion. The new look was both more modest and covered-up than previous fashions and decidedly fussy, with bows, frills, ribbons, and other trim, but the short string of pearls and pearl earrings or eardrops worn since the 1630s remained popular.|$|E

25|$|Many {{people in}} Western culture, {{both male and}} female, {{consider}} breasts an important female secondary sex characteristic and {{an important aspect of}} femininity and many women use décolletage that exposes cleavage as part of their physical and sexual attractiveness and to improve their sense of femininity. Display of cleavage with a low <b>neckline</b> is often regarded as a form of feminine flirting or seduction, as much as for its aesthetic or erotic effect. Most men derive erotic pleasure from seeing a woman's cleavage, and some people derive pleasure in their female partner exposing cleavage. When cleavage is enhanced with a push-up bra or exposed by a low <b>neckline</b> it can draw attention. During adolescence, some girls become obsessed with breast shape and cleavage. In South Africa, Wonderbra sponsors a National Cleavage Day during which women are encouraged to display their cleavage. The use of tight clothing and the display of cleavage has been attributed as causes of an increase in breast fetishism, and atypical paraphilia.|$|E

25|$|The wide, high-waisted {{look of the}} {{previous}} period was gradually superseded by a long vertical line, with horizontal emphasis at the shoulder. Full, loose sleeves ended just below the elbow at mid century and became longer and tighter {{in keeping with the}} new trend. The body was tightly corseted, with a low, broad <b>neckline</b> and dropped shoulder. In later decades, the overskirt was drawn back and pinned up to display the petticoat, which was heavily decorated.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} years of the new century, fashionable bodices had high <b>necklines</b> or {{extremely}} low, rounded <b>necklines,</b> and short wings at the shoulders. Separate closed cartwheel ruffs were sometimes worn, with the standing collar, supported by a small wire frame or supportasse used for more casual wear and becoming more common later. Long sleeves were worn with deep cuffs to match the ruff. The cartwheel ruff disappeared in fashionable England by 1613.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Evaluating the {{efficacy}} of 2 new percutaneous devices specifically designed to be placed through the right internal jugular vein, therefore named "necklines," for achieving retrograde cardioplegia and pulmonary venting {{in the setting of}} minimally invasive aortic valve replacement (MIAVR). DESIGN: Case series. SETTING: University-affiliated private hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Patients undergoing MIAVR. INTERVENTIONS: <b>Necklines</b> were placed by the anesthesiologist using transesophageal electrocardiography, with pressure guidance before the surgical procedure was initiated. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The records of 51 consecutive patients who underwent MIAVR with <b>necklines</b> placement were reviewed retrospectively. The access for MIAVR was through either a J-hemisternotomy or a right anterior thoracotomy. The efficacy of the 2 catheters, successful placement rate, time needed to deploy catheters, and perioperative complications were recorded. <b>Necklines</b> were placed successfully in all patients in 23 ± 13 minutes. A total of 110 doses of retrograde cardioplegia were delivered at a mean flow rate of 173 ± 35 mL/min and a mean pressure of 41 ± 6 mmHg. The pulmonary catheter ensured venting of the heart that was graded by surgeons as "excellent" in 33 patients, "sufficient" in 12 patients, and "not adequate" in 2 patients. There were no major adverse events or deaths. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Necklines</b> ensure effective retrograde cardioplegia and venting of the heart, provide optimal surgical vision and access during MIAVR, and allow surgeons to operate in an unobstructed surgical field. Nevertheless, additional studies are required to determine whether the use of <b>necklines</b> is associated with better outcomes than those with conventional methods...|$|R
