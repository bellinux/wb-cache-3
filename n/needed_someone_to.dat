Dimitri eagerly accepted. Later, Brooke re-introduced Dimitri to J.R. Chandler, who, although appeared happy to see Dimitri, was nonetheless jealous {{of the fact that}} Dimitri, and not him, would be overseeing Chandler Media.|$|E
5|$|Even {{after the}} album had been completed, Collins was unhappy about leaving the drumkit to sing lead, {{and the band}} were unsure he would be {{comfortable}} as frontman on tour. The group decided to try anyway, and <b>needed</b> <b>someone</b> <b>to</b> drum while Collins was singing. Collins insisted on choosing the touring drummer himself, selecting Bill Bruford, who he had already worked with in Brand X. Collins continued to drum during instrumental sections.|$|E
5|$|James later {{encounters}} two Pyramid Heads, {{along with}} an alive Maria, who is killed again. James realizes that Pyramid Head was created because he <b>needed</b> <b>someone</b> <b>to</b> punish him, and all the monsters have been manifestations of his psyche. The envelope from Mary disappears and both Pyramid Heads commit suicide. James heads to the hotel's rooftop; depending on choices made by the player throughout the game, he encounters either Mary or Maria disguised as her.|$|E

5|$|Moberly, born in 1846, was {{the tenth}} of fifteen children. She {{came from a}} {{professional}} background; her father, George Moberly, was the headmaster of Winchester College and later Bishop of Salisbury. In 1886 Moberly became the first Principal of a hall of residence for young women, St. Hugh's College in Oxford. It became apparent that Moberly <b>needed</b> <b>someone</b> <b>to</b> help run the college, and Jourdain was asked to become Moberly's assistant.|$|E
5|$|Weinberg taught {{courses at}} Wright Junior College. He applied for and {{received}} a National Research Council fellowship to study under Kenneth S. Cole at Columbia University, but never took it up, as Cole came to Chicago {{to work on the}} Manhattan Project as a radiation biologist. Weinberg was recruited to work at its Metallurgical Laboratory at the University of Chicago in September 1941 by Eckart and Samuel Allison, who <b>needed</b> <b>someone</b> <b>to</b> work on the latter's neutron capture calculations.|$|E
5|$|Göring {{had never}} {{believed}} in Sea Lion, while Hitler had never believed Adler could achieve victory without Sea Lion. Both went their own ways. Hitler <b>needed</b> <b>someone</b> <b>to</b> {{keep up the}} pressure on Britain, and Göring {{was willing to do}} it. On 19 September, Hitler ordered that no further barges were to be added to Sea Lion ports, but those under assembly were to continue. But the damage being done by RAF Bomber Command now meant sustaining the army in readiness was becoming a strain. The invasion forces were broken up and moved East on the understanding it could be reassembled with only three weeks notice.|$|E

"I'll <b>Need</b> <b>Someone</b> <b>to</b> Hold Me (When I Cry)" [...] {{is a song}} {{written by}} Bob McDill and Wayland Holyfield, and {{recorded}} by American country music artist Janie Fricke. It was released in July 1981 as the third single and title track from her album I'll <b>Need</b> <b>Someone</b> <b>to</b> Hold Me When I Cry. The song reached #4 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles chart and #1 on the RPM Country Tracks chart in Canada.|$|R

It was released in November 1972 as the first single from the album She <b>Needs</b> <b>Someone</b> <b>to</b> Hold Her. The song was Twitty's ninth {{number one in the}} U.S. country chart as a solo artist. It stayed at number one for two weeks and spent 14 weeks in the chart.|$|R
5|$|The {{military}} {{then made}} him the press secretary for former Prime Minister of Australia Billy Hughes. From his appointment onwards, he {{lived and worked in}} Canberra. Hughes had changed political parties several times and was infamous for his erratic style and the government wanted Fingleton to moderate him. The leader of the United Australia Party, Hughes had particularly worried Prime Minister John Curtin by frequently and publicly excoriating US General Douglas Macarthur, who was commanding the Allied forces in the Pacific. Curtin <b>needed</b> <b>someone</b> <b>to</b> quieten Hughes, as Macarthur had threatened to leave if the denouncements continued. Fingleton spent three months working for the temperamental Hughes and was not successful in curbing his aggressive oratory. He then worked in censorship, deciding which portions of Curtin's press briefings were reportable; Fingleton tried to take a liberal line on press freedom. Fingleton also worked for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's Radio Australia while serving in the censorship department.|$|E
5|$|When the {{battered}} fleet returned to Venice, {{news of the}} defeat spread throughout the city to mixed reactions. Though some were willing to forgive the defeat considering the circumstances, many others <b>needed</b> <b>someone</b> <b>to</b> blame for the loss that was considerable not only in human and material terms, but also symbolically. The people of Venice had been humiliated by an upstart nation with practically no naval experience. Though Guiscard would die {{the next year and}} the Norman threat would quickly disappear, a scapegoat was needed at that moment. A faction of influential Venetians, possibly led by Vitale Faliero based on later writings, led a popular revolt to depose Selvo, and in December 1084 they succeeded. Selvo apparently did not make a great effort to defend himself and was sent off to a monastery. He died three years later in 1087, and was buried in the loggiato of St. Mark's Basilica.|$|E
25|$|Philip III succeeded {{his father}} in 1598 but had no {{interest}} in politics or government, preferring to engage in lavish court festivities, religious indulgences, and the theatre. He <b>needed</b> <b>someone</b> <b>to</b> do the work of governing, and he settled on the Duke of Lerma.|$|E

25|$|When the Senate Ethics {{committee}} <b>needed</b> <b>someone</b> <b>to</b> review Republican senator Bob Packwood's diaries, {{the committee}} chose Starr. In 1990, Starr {{was the leading}} candidate for the U.S.Supreme Court nomination after William Brennan's retirement. He encountered strong resistance from the Department of Justice leadership, which feared that Starr might not be reliably conservative as a Supreme Court justice. George H. W. Bush nominated David Souter instead of Starr.|$|E
25|$|Douglas and Coldwell's {{position}} was eventually {{adopted by the}} CCF National Council, but they also did not admonish Woodworth's pacifist stand, and allowed him to put it forward in the House. Douglas assisted Woodsworth, during his leader's speech, by holding up the pages and turning them for him, even though he disagreed with him. Woodsworth had suffered a stroke {{earlier in the year}} and he <b>needed</b> <b>someone</b> <b>to</b> hold his notes, and Douglas still held him in very high regard, and dutifully assisted his leader.|$|E
25|$|The black people, {{dissatisfied}} with Almeida's leadership, {{wanted to take}} the ship and escape but they <b>needed</b> <b>someone</b> <b>to</b> pilot it. Vera was offered the position and accepted, agreeing to share the result of the sale of the vessel. On December 26, 1827, a riot occurred. In the action one of the mutineers and two of the crew were killed. The captain, with three head injuries and a broken arm, and the three survivors who supported him, were locked in the chamber to defend themselves with firearms that were stored there, but the rioters threw buckets of water on the weapons and wet the gunpowder. Vera then threatened to block the outlet and blow the powder magazine, forcing them to surrender.|$|E

25|$|In late 1905, Harry {{left the}} trio {{following}} {{an argument with}} Al. Harry had refused Al's request {{to take care of}} Joe Palmer, who was in a wheelchair, while he was dating. After Harry's departure, Al and Joe Palmer worked as a duo but were not particularly successful. By 1906 the two agreed to separate, and Jolson was on his own. Jolson became a regular at the Globe and Wigwam Theater in San Francisco, California, and remained successful nationwide as a vaudeville singer. He took up residence in San Francisco, saying the earthquake-devastated people <b>needed</b> <b>someone</b> <b>to</b> cheer them up. In 1908 Jolson, needing money for himself and his new wife, Henrietta, returned to New York. In 1909, Al's singing caught the attention of Lew Dockstader, the producer and star of Dockstader's Minstrels. Al accepted Dockstader's offer and became a regular blackface performer.|$|E
25|$|After {{his release}} from prison, Speck worked for three months as a driver for the Patterson Meat Company and had six {{accidents}} with his truck before he was fired for failing {{to show up for}} work. In December 1965, on the recommendation of his mother, Speck, who was by then separated from his wife, moved in with a 29-year-old divorced woman, an ex-professional wrestler who was a bartender at his favorite bar, Ginny's Lounge, and <b>needed</b> <b>someone</b> <b>to</b> babysit her three children. In January 1966, Speck's wife filed for divorce. That same month, Speck stabbed a man in a knife fight at Ginny's Lounge. He was charged with aggravated assault, but a defense attorney hired by his mother was able to get the charge reduced to disturbing the peace. Speck was fined ten dollars and jailed for three days after he failed to pay the fine. This was the last time Speck was in police custody in Dallas.|$|E
25|$|Boulez earned {{money by}} giving {{mathematics}} lessons to his landlord's son. He also played the ondes Martenot (an early electronic instrument), improvising accompaniments to radio dramas and occasionally deputising {{in the pit}} orchestra of the Folies Bergère. In early 1946 the actor and director Jean-Louis Barrault <b>needed</b> <b>someone</b> <b>to</b> play the instrument for a production of Hamlet for the new company he and his wife, Madeleine Renaud, had formed. Honegger suggested Boulez. He was soon appointed Music Director of the Compagnie Renaud-Barrault, a post he held for nine years. He arranged and conducted incidental music, mostly by composers {{with whom he had}} little affinity (such as Milhaud and Tchaikovsky), but it gave him the chance to work with professional musicians, whilst leaving him time to compose during the day. It also broadened his horizons: in 1947 the company toured to Belgium and Switzerland ("absolutely pays de cocagne , my first discovery of the big world"); in 1948 they took their production of Hamlet to the second Edinburgh International Festival; in 1951 they gave a season of plays at St James's Theatre in London at the invitation of Laurence Olivier; and between 1950 and 1957 there were three tours to South America and two to North America. The music he wrote for the company was lost during the student occupation of the Théâtre de l'Odéon in 1968.|$|E

500|$|This meaning {{was also}} evident in the song's lyrics. [...] In the second line, Fanning states that [...] "I made a mistake that I'll never surpass", before {{explaining}} {{that it does not}} matter whose fault it is, in saying [...] "I know you <b>needed</b> <b>someone</b> <b>to</b> take the fall/I know you <b>needed</b> <b>someone</b> <b>to</b> blame it on". [...] In the second verse, Fanning again reiterates that he feels pain in the mistake that was made, when he says [...] "I found my heart and it broke like glass/I made that mistake that I'll never surpass".|$|E
500|$|... "We <b>needed</b> <b>someone</b> <b>to</b> play {{keyboards}} {{for a song}} I {{did with}} Gavin Christopher. We called someone and he couldn't come, so by accident we stumbled on Ben.

500|$|It {{became a}} sports media sensation, {{especially}} {{given that the}} New York Mets had won the division in 2006 with relative ease. The claim was widely reported, often without {{the second part of}} the quote ("only on paper"). USA Today columnist Hal Bodley opined, [...] "The Phillies have <b>needed</b> <b>someone</b> <b>to</b> light a fire, especially in April. Rollins' bold, if not arrogant, prediction might just do that." [...] During the first half of the season, it appeared Rollins had spoken prematurely, as the Mets jumped out to an early divisional lead. On June 28, Rollins had a four-hit game against the Cincinnati Reds, including a game-tying triple. The triple was Rollins' 10th, which gave him his fifth career [...] "quadruple–double".|$|E

50|$|As Emma's baby's birth approaches, Blackie {{arranges}} {{for her to}} {{meet his}} friend Laura Spencer {{in the village of}} Armley. Laura <b>needs</b> <b>someone</b> <b>to</b> share household expenses, and Emma <b>needs</b> <b>someone</b> <b>to</b> look after her, so the match seems ideal. The women become good friends, Emma moves in, and Laura gets her a job at Thompson's Mill. In March, Emma has a daughter and names her Edwina. As Emma must work to support herself and her child, Emma's cousin, Freda, takes Edwina. After a year of working two jobs, Emma makes enough money to rent a shop in Armley. This shop is a success, and Emma's business expands to a second shop, then a third. Not expecting to see the Fairleys, she is horrified when Edwin's brutish brother Gerald visits; he had found her after seeing she worked at Thompson's Mill, now owned by his father. He tells her Edwin will soon be engaged and demands she tell him where the child is. Emma refuses to admit there is a child, and after a violent confrontation, realizes she <b>needs</b> <b>someone</b> <b>to</b> protect her. Worried Gerald will return, she marries her landlord, Joe Lowther. (They had become friends when he taught her how to do her own accounts.) Soon after their marriage, he and Emma have a son, Christopher, nicknamed Kit.|$|R
