In 1913 {{he was awarded}} the Rumford Prize of the American Academy of Arts and Science, and in 1915 the Henry Draper Medal of the <b>National</b> <b>Academy</b> <b>of</b> <b>Sciences.</b> The research was also supported by grants from the Draper fund of the <b>National</b> <b>Academy</b> <b>of</b> <b>Sciences</b> and the Rumford Fund of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

After numerous discoveries, Stebbins left the University of Illinois in 1922 for the Washburn Observatory in Wisconsin and Dr. Robert H. Baker took over as the new Director of the University of Illinois Observatory. However, because the observatory lost its pioneering researcher in Stebbins did not mean that discovery and science did not continue at the university's observatory.|$|E
