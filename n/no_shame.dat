25|$|The Athenians {{express their}} shock at the Melians' lack of realism. They {{say that there}} is <b>no</b> <b>shame</b> in {{submitting}} to a stronger enemy, especially one who is offering reasonable terms. They also argue that it is sensible to submit to one's superiors, stand firm against one's equals, and be moderate to one's inferiors. The Melians do not change their minds and politely dismiss the envoys.|$|E

25|$|Stevenson's senior boxing {{career began}} at age {{seventeen}} with a {{defeat in the}} national championships against the experienced heavyweight Gabriel Garcia. Despite the setback, Stevenson went on to register convincing victories over Nancio Carillo and Juan Perez, two of Cuba's finest boxers in the weight division, securing {{a place in the}} national team for the 1970 Central American Championships. Defeat in the final after three victories was considered <b>no</b> <b>shame,</b> and Stevenson firmly established himself as Cuba's premier heavyweight. Back in the gym Chervonenko and leading Cuban boxing coach Alcides Sagarra worked on Stevenson's jab, which paid dividends when the Cuban easily defeated East Germany's Bernd Anders in front of a surprised Berlin crowd. The victory made the entire amateur boxing world take notice of Stevenson as a serious heavyweight contender.|$|E
25|$|After {{this had}} the king a large meeting, and very deep {{consultation}} with his council, about this land; {{how it was}} occupied, and by what sort of men. Then sent he his men over all England into each shire; commissioning them to find out 'How many hundreds of hides were in the shire, what land the king himself had, and what stock upon the land; or, what dues {{he ought to have}} by the year from the shire.' Also he commissioned them to record in writing, 'How much land his archbishops had, and his diocesan bishops, and his abbots, and his earls;' and though I may be prolix and tedious, 'What, or how much, each man had, who was an occupier of land in England, either in land or in stock, and how much money it were worth.' So very narrowly, indeed, did he commission them to trace it out, that there was not one single hide, nor a yard of land, nay, moreover (it is shameful to tell, though he thought it <b>no</b> <b>shame</b> to do it), not even an ox, nor a cow, nor a swine was there left, that was not set down in his writ. And all the recorded particulars were afterwards brought to him.|$|E

500|$|Gagged {{consists}} of five dance-pop, electronic, and avant-garde tracks with [...] "thumping" [...] beats. Music critics viewed the EP as {{a departure from}} the music released by previous RuPaul's Drag Race contestants, describing its sound as more experimental or moodier. The songs are heavily influenced by sexual fetishism and sadomasochism. Through their lyrics, Chachki addresses [...] "gender roles and conformity, power play, exhibitionism, sex and confidence." [...] She found additional inspiration from her time working as an assistant to a dominatrix and a [...] "mistress in a dungeon." [...] Oscar Raymundo wrote that the EP's title reflected how Chachki is [...] "a fetish queen at heart."

In its obituary, The Times opined that [...] "throughout his life he maintained a fearlessness and an indifference to consequences" [...] and one journalist claimed: [...] "To say that he has <b>no</b> <b>shame</b> is to drastically exaggerate the amount of shame that he has".

[...] Attorney Karen Nersisyan agrees: [...] "Serbsky is not an organ of medicine. It's an organ of power." [...] According to human rights activist and former psychiatrist Sofia Dorinskaya, the system of Soviet psychiatry has not been destroyed, the Serbsky Institute is standing where it did, the same people who worked in the Soviet system are working there. She says we have a situation like after the defeat of fascism in Germany, when fascism officially collapsed, but all governors of acres, judges and all people remained after the fascist regime.|$|E

500|$|... "Inactive" [...] is a spoof of the Imagine Dragons song [...] "Radioactive" [...] that {{centers on}} an {{extremely}} lethargic character covered in food residue. O'Keeffe remarked upon the breathing {{sounds of the}} original song being recontexualized in the parody, as the character mentions that he requires an inhaler. The Pixies pastiche [...] "First World Problems" [...] lampoons people who complain of various First World problems such as the lack of gluten-free cookies in an airport lounge. The song features [...] "off-kilter guitars and a Black Francis-esque raucous vocal delivery" [...] with stylistic references to the Pixies songs [...] "Debaser" [...] and [...] "Hang Wire". The sendup of Pharrell Williams' [...] "Happy" [...] is the song [...] "Tacky", in which the singer boasts of having <b>no</b> <b>shame</b> and making unfashionable or tactless choices.

500|$|Human Rights Watch (HRW) {{said the}} charges were {{politically}} motivated and asked authorities to drop them, allow al-Jamri back to his position and [...] "cease their campaign to silence independent journalism".

[...] "Bahrain's rulers are showing they have <b>no</b> <b>shame</b> by muzzling the one media outlet that was {{widely regarded as the}} country's only independent news source," [...] Joe Stork of HRW said. The Committee to Protect Journalists condemned the actions of Bahraini government and described them as [...] "strong-arm tactics". The non-government organization added that its research supported claims by al-Jamri that the government was behind planting the false news.

These principles are significant {{to the history of}} spiritual side of yoga.

500|$|Critics {{found some}} of Stargate's {{succeeding}} works {{a replica of}} Irreplaceables musical formula. Sheffield commented that, in the song [...] "Tattoo" [...] by Sparks, the team [...] "have <b>no</b> <b>shame</b> about churning out 'Irreplaceable' replicants forever", reprising the acoustic guitar-drum loop formula. The New York Times music critic Kelefa Sanneh deemed it [...] "sounds like a cousin" [...] of [...] "Irreplaceable". The release of R singer Chris Brown's 2007 single [...] "With You" [...] produced similar impressions: Sheffield, in his review for Brown's album, noted that [...] "Stargate {{was just trying to}} roll out 'Irreplaceable' one more time". Hillary Crosley of Billboard magazine wrote that [...] "With You" [...] "leans a bit too heavily" [...] toward [...] "Irreplaceable". Stylus Magazine also noted that Rihanna's Stargate produced single, [...] "Hate That I Love You" [...] was a rehash of Ne-Yo and Stargate's previous works saying, [...] "Here you've got the 'Sexy Love' drums, the 'Irreplaceable' strum, and a bit of the synth and chorus melody from 'So Sick'... is hardly the new twist all these old bits need to sound fresh." ...|$|E

[...] Bill Ferguson, the Australian team's scorer, was also critical: [...] "Had Johnson been told by his friends in the press that he was, in fact, a passenger, he might have pondered on the advisability of standing down.

The employees decide not to tell David about Andy's unapproved absence out of gratitude for Andy's past kindnesses, but at the meeting they cannot resist crafting made-up recent events in the hope that he will blow his own cover.
