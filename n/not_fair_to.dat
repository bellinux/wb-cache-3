5|$|Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) {{talks with}} Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) about his going to {{marriage}} counseling with Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer), and Pam {{does the same}} with Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate). Toby points out to Jim that it is <b>not</b> <b>fair</b> <b>to</b> tell Pam that he needs an indeterminate amount of time before Athlead pays off for the family; Pam vents to Nellie that Jim is always making unilateral decisions involving her and they each agree they are not leaving Philly for Scranton or vice versa. The Halperts leave the office looking sad and awkward together.|$|E
25|$|Sachs {{does not}} {{see the need for}} {{independent}} evaluators, and sees them as a detractor to proper progress. He argues that many facets of aid cannot be effectively quantified, and thus it is <b>not</b> <b>fair</b> <b>to</b> try to put empirical benchmarks on the effectiveness of aid.|$|E
25|$|The dissent {{argued that}} in this case there was a net {{transfer}} from Penn Central to the city. The dissent argued that it was <b>not</b> <b>fair</b> <b>to</b> have the entire burden of preserving Grand Central fall on its owners. That cost is the opportunity cost of not developing the airspace over the terminal.|$|E

25|$|Often, bear {{viewing and}} bear hunting are {{considered}} incompatible. Even if the bear population is healthy and bear hunting is sustainable, ethical questions arise especially if hunting occurs near viewing areas and either during or {{soon after the}} viewing season. Many {{feel that it is}} <b>not</b> <b>fair</b> <b>to</b> encourage bears to be close to people during the summer, only to allow them to be shot in the fall. The Kodiak bear plan recognized bear hunting as a legitimate, traditional, and biologically justifiable activity. It recommended that agencies find ways to make bear hunting and bear viewing compatible on the archipelago.|$|E
25|$|Starting {{from the}} {{argument}} that a historical universal scientific method does not exist, Feyerabend argues that science does not deserve its privileged status in western society. Since scientific points of view do not arise from using a universal method which guarantees high quality conclusions, he thought {{that there is no}} justification for valuing scientific claims over claims by other ideologies like religions. Feyerabend also argued that scientific accomplishments such as the moon landings are no compelling reason to give science a special status. In his opinion, it is <b>not</b> <b>fair</b> <b>to</b> use scientific assumptions about which problems are worth solving in order to judge the merit of other ideologies. Additionally, success by scientists has traditionally involved non-scientific elements, such as inspiration from mythical or religious sources.|$|E
500|$|At {{the podium}} interview, {{conducted}} by film director George Lucas, Lewis Hamilton expressed gratitude to his {{team and the}} fans at the venue. Felipe Massa, asked about his last lap fight with teammate Bottas, stated: [...] "I’m getting old for that! I even said to the team I’m getting old! The last three laps of the race I was fighting with my team-mate. It was very difficult but we managed to be here." [...] During the post-race press conference, Hamilton expressed surprise over his championship lead, since {{he had not been}} made aware of Rosberg's retirement at that point. When asked about the tyre pressure issue, Sebastian Vettel defended Hamilton, saying: [...] "I think it’s <b>not</b> <b>fair</b> <b>to</b> hand that question to Lewis because he doesn’t know what’s going on [...] In a lot of respect and fairness he {{did a very good job}} today and you have to accept that." ...|$|E

500|$|After {{losing the}} World Series {{in six games}} to the Boston Red Sox, Matheny and general manager John Mozeliak {{explained}} that Miller's role was as [...] "insurance." [...] In just one game until Michael Wacha's final start– which was {{the final game of}} the year– did a starter go less than five innings. [...] Miller also became less effective as the season progressed late, with his strikeout rate decreasing and walk rate increasing. [...] Said Matheny, [...] "It {{would have to be a}} situation where we were pushing into a tight spot, and that's just <b>not</b> <b>fair</b> <b>to</b> him without having much action to this point. [...] He's been exactly what we’ve needed up to this point. [...] Fortunately we haven’t needed that long outing." [...] Mozeliak added that [...] "second-guessing the roster doesn’t have traction. [...] His role was always that insurance. [...] There were a lot of question marks as we were going into this on exactly how our rotation was going to unfold. [...] The fact that everybody has stepped up changed the dynamic." ...|$|E
500|$|Co-writer Frank Spotnitz {{described}} the episode as a [...] "fortunate accident". Late {{in the fourth}} season of the show Gillian Anderson left the show for a week to film her part in the film The Mighty. The producers, knowing {{that they would have}} to write an episode without Dana Scully, decided it was <b>not</b> <b>fair</b> <b>to</b> have David Duchovny carry the same workload as in a normal episode considering her absence. As such, a story was devised in which his involvement would be light. This resulted in the decision to write, for the second year in a row, an episode focused on Assistant Director Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi). Howard Gordon, having written the previous Skinner-centric episode, [...] "Avatar", joined Spotnitz and the two wrote the episode over a weekend while another Gordon-written episode, [...] "Synchrony", was in production. The writers felt that this was the perfect time to bring in Skinner's deal with The Smoking Man (William B. Davis) to cure Scully's cancer, made in the episode [...] "Memento Mori". Frank Spotnitz said of Skinner's deal, [...] "The hard thing for Skinner was that we had to keep him in the middle. We had him tell Mulder not to bargain with The Smoking Man in order to save Scully's life. And then he himself struck a Faustian bargain with the Cigarette Smoking Man and was in his debt for some kind." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hanks {{told the}} Associated Press that Sullenberger had {{reviewed}} an early {{draft of the}} script, which identified NTSB investigators by their real names, and asked that these be removed. According to Hanks, Sullenberger felt that the real-life investigators [...] "were not prosecutors" [...] and it was <b>not</b> <b>fair</b> <b>to</b> associate them with changes in the story to depict [...] "more of a prosecutorial process".|$|E

2500|$|.....We {{had to do}} {{the whole}} movie in 16 weeks. It was a massive undertaking. That was <b>not</b> <b>fair</b> <b>to</b> the movie. I would redo the entire third act if I could. But the studio {{literally}} took the movie away from us. It was terrible. My visual effects supervisor had a nervous breakdown, so I had {{to be in charge of}} that. I called James Cameron and asked [...] "What do you do when you're doing all the effects yourself?" [...] But the movie did fine.|$|E
2500|$|Green {{eventually}} wrote a {{song called}} [...] "Lonely Swedish (The Bum Bum Song)", which he composed during MTV's Spring Break while doing a show on a cruise ship. After airing the music video on his show and appealing to his audience to request it, the song became an instant number one hit on Total Request Live and was also referred to in Eminem's song [...] "The Real Slim Shady". He quickly called for the video to be retired because [...] "it's <b>not</b> <b>fair</b> <b>to</b> 98 Degrees." [...] Later, in his autobiography, he revealed that MTV had pressured {{him to do so}} {{in order to maintain the}} image that Total Request Live was, in fact, a live request show (the next week's episodes had been pre-taped on location, and the producers of the show were completely unaware of [...] "The Bum Bum Song" [...] at the time).|$|E
2500|$|Robertson, visiting London {{in early}} October, had {{discussed}} French's replacement with Murray (now CIGS) and the King. [...] After {{he returned to}} France and conferred with Haig, Haig recorded (diary 24 October) [...] "I ha(ve) been more than loyal to French and {{did my best to}} stop all criticism of him or his methods … I ha(ve) {{come to the conclusion that}} it (i)s <b>not</b> <b>fair</b> <b>to</b> the Empire to retain French in command. [...] Moreover, none of my officers commanding corps had a high opinion of Sir John's military ability or military views; in fact they had no confidence in him. [...] Robertson quite agreed and left me saying [...] "he knew how to act, and would report to Stamfordham" [...] ". Robertson thought (24 October) that French's [...] "mind was never the same for two consecutive minutes" [...] and that his ideas were [...] "reckless and impossible" [...] and that he had poor relations with Joffre.|$|E

2500|$|An {{organization}} {{calling itself}} [...] "Union of Slavs", led by Nina Konovaleva and Boris Karatayev, {{was created in}} 1991 to counter the activities of Circassian organizations such as Adyge Khase, and prevent Circassians from removing Russians from positions of prestige and power, {{as well as to}} [...] "protect Russians/Cossacks from Circassian control of the land". In 1991, Union of Slavs in Adygeya actively opposed the establishment of Adygeya as separate from Krasnodar Krai as an ethnic republic within Russia, stating that Circassians were only 22% of the populace and as such, it was <b>not</b> <b>fair</b> <b>to</b> the other 78%. The Union of Slavs has called the increasing autonomy of Adygeya and the activism in Karachay–Cherkessia and Kabardino-Balkaria part of a [...] "dangerous conspiracy" [...] to create a [...] "Greater Circassia", achieve demographic dominance by repatriating Diaspora Circassians, and then marginalize or even expel the Russian residents ("colonists", in Circassian ideology). It has called for the liquidation of the three Circassian republics (two of which are also shared with Karachays or Balkars) due to [...] "discrimination of Russians".|$|E
2500|$|However, in a January 28, 2009 {{interview}} with MTV News, Richard {{announced that the}} group had split up. Richard explained that Combs had invited all the women {{to come back to}} the 2009 season of Making the Band and that only two of them, Richard and Fimbres, showed up. [...] "It changes [...] completely," [...] she said. [...] "We have fans out there who love Danity Kane. We love Danity Kane. It's hard. We're sitting here trying to make sense of it now. It's hard. We're put in this position that we didn't ask to be in and we're being told to fix it." [...] On the series and in an earlier interview, Bex had explicitly stated her discontent about Danity Kane being divided. [...] "I don't know why ," [...] said Richard. [...] "I think she's just happy. I don't want to even try to answer it 'cause that's <b>not</b> <b>fair</b> <b>to</b> her. I haven't [...] but I heard she's doing well with her husband and she got a house. I love her, but I don't know." [...] Richard was surprised that only two members showed up for another season. [...] "The thing about it ... I thought we were all going to come back and talk, or maybe if [...] didn't come back, 'cause I don't know how [...] was feeling about that, if the four of us got together. I didn't know what to expect. I just know I got off the plane and found out I was the only one there and [...] came the next day." ...|$|E
