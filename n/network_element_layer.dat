This is the proof of concept of a new scenario for traffic engineering, for self-configuring control and end-to-end quality of service management {{by means of a}} tool based on Web Services. The system is structured in 3 layers: A Graphical User Interface, a <b>Network</b> <b>Elements</b> <b>layer</b> (an interface to physical devices) and, in the middle, a Network Management System layer, where decisions about admission, load balancing, path selection, re-routing and bandwidth allocation per class are taken. The system includes Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA) and Background Monitoring System (BMS) modules to globally manage network resources. The so-called Squatter and Legalization mechanisms are introduced as novelties added to traffic engineering. Those strategies permit the use of part of the available resources from other classes only while unused by the class owning them. The trials have validated the management system, using Cisco routers.

40|$|Modern {{communication}} {{networks are}} reaching {{a high level}} of complexity. As their global dimensioning and performance evaluation are very hard tasks, a multi-layer approach is generally applied to divide them in smaller problems easier to tackle. Within this approach, tools only address one or two network layers. To perform an enhanced analysis encompassing more layers, several tools, not necessarily available in the same place when the problem arises, are often required. This paper shows how to allow a remote access to various existing tools using Web Services paradigm. In this way, software components modelling <b>network</b> <b>elements,</b> <b>layers,</b> or computing specific functions are turned into Web Services, which are available to remote users over the internet. Accessed through a simplified interface, they can be used sequentially or in parallel to solve a specific task. This dispenses the user to perform a local implementation, allows better code reuse, and offers an easy way to confront results from distinct models. A tool accessed via a web service can be beneficial for either research or educational purposes. Moreover, making tools available on the web increases credibility and visibility of their authors. Calls to Web Service require transmitting and retrieving al...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- The {{security}} of complex <b>networks</b> with multiple <b>elements</b> {{is very difficult}} to evaluate and characterize by numbers. The interaction between the <b>network</b> <b>elements,</b> the different <b>layer</b> topologies and the numerous features makes the security quantification almost impossible. On the other side, the lack of security benchmarking is very problematic for the budget and invests allocation by companies. Numerical economical indexes for the costs and potential benefits are used to set the budgets. The security is not be quantified and it cannot be mapped to these economical indexes, thus the budget is not set objectively. This paper suggests a novel framework for quantification of network security, thus security benchmarking. The relative vector expresses the different layers, physical connections, operation risk, and human resources. The benchmark is relative and not absolute value, which is an indirect indication for the security. The relative security vector maps to economical values and helps the management to take the decisions. The suggested framework extends the common standards like ISO 27000, BSI, ITIL, which characterize single <b>network</b> <b>elements</b> or processes in corporations. This framework is the missing link between the security standards, subjective expert analysis and the monetary instruments. The benchmarking is not saying if a system is secured, then it gives a relative indirect comparison between systems.

40|$|Abstract. It {{is often}} useful {{to be able}} to examine managed objects of a crashed network el-ement in order to {{determine}} why it is faulty. However, most network monitoring systems only allow the examination of managed objects of fault-free agents. This work presents the specication and requirements of a clustering architecture for SNMP agents, which supports replication of managed objects. Also, we described its properties. The architecture is struc-tured in three layers. The lower layer corresponds to the managed objects at the <b>network</b> <b>elements.</b> The middle <b>layer</b> contains management entities called clusters that monitor and replicate managed objects. The upper layer allows the denition of management clusters as well as the relationship between clusters. An analysis of network resources demanded on a practical tool for replicating managed objects is presented. Resumo.

40|$|The {{traditional}} {{model of}} single ownership {{of all the}} physical <b>network</b> <b>elements</b> and <b>network</b> <b>layers</b> by mobile network operators is beginning to be challenged. This {{has been attributed to}} the rapid and complex technology migration compounded with rigorous regulatory requirements and ever increasing capital expenditures. These trends, combined together with the increasing competition, rapid commoditization of telecommunication equipments and rising separation of network and service provisioning are pushing the operators to adopt multiple strategies, with network infrastructure sharing in the core and radio access networks emerging as a more radical mechanism to substantially and sustainably improve network costs. Through infrastructure sharing, developing countries and other emerging economies can harness the technological, market and regulatory developments that have fostered affordable access to mobile and broadband services. Similarly, the network operators entering or consolidating in the emerging markets can aim for substantial savings on capital and operating expenses. The present paper aims to investigate the current technological solutions and regulatory and the technical-economical dimensions in connection with the sharing of mobile telecommunication networks in emerging countries. We analyze the estimated savings on capital and operating expenses, while assessing the technical constraints, applicability and benefits of the network sharing solutions in an emerging market context...|$|R
