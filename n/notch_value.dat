40|$|Abstract Fracture in ductile glassy {{polymers}} {{is usually}} preceded by noticeable and extensive plastic deformation, as shear yielding {{takes place in}} the form of shear bands that are limited by progressive hardening of materials at continuous deformation. In the case of a notched specimen, this induces a noticeable crack blunting before the failure. We use a constitutive law that captures realistically the stress-strain fields of solid glassy polymers. In particular, we account for a rate dependent yield stress followed by intrinsic softening and progressive hardening at continued deformation. We analyzed the 3 D crack tip fields around a blunted notch loaded under mode I. With an increasing ratio between thickness versus notch tip radius, the shape of crack tip area evolves from a flame like zone characteristic of plane stress conditions to slip lines when plan strain conditions prevail. For a constitutive law representing the response of polycarbonate, we identified a critical thickness vs <b>notch</b> radius <b>value</b> that indicates the transition between plane stress to plane strain dominant loading conditions.

The investigation involved the synthesis and mechanical testing of a series of unsaturated polyester resins and the incorporation of these resins into sheet moulding compounds (SMC) with their subsequent testing. Two main structural parameters were varied, firstly the degree of unsaturation of the resin (i. e. maleic:phthalic ratio), and secondly the amount of diol excess added to the reaction vessel during the resin synthesis thereby varying the hydroxyl value of the resin. It was found that the properties of the resins, both structural and mechanical, were interdependent. Altering the maleic:phthalic ratio was found to effect the hydroxyl <b>value,</b> <b>notch</b> sensitivity, shrinkage, and modulus of the resin. Low resin hydroxyl values were found to give SMC with low tensile strength and low fracture toughness. Unusually high hydroxyl values enhanced the toughness but the SMC did not show the expected increase in tensile strength. Surprisingly the toughness of SMC appears insensitive to the notch sensitivity of the resins despite the relatively wide range of resins used and their range of notch sensitivities.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Describe stress {{distribution}} and compare stress concentration factor (K(t)) for homogeneous micro-specimens with different notch geometries and stick-shaped homogeneous and bimaterial specimens {{by means of}} finite element (FE) analysis. METHODS: Axisymmetric models were created for homogeneous specimens with different notches and for stick-shaped homogeneous and bimaterial specimens. FE mesh was refined at areas of expected stress concentration and boundary conditions included an applied tensile stress in the axial direction. Linear elastic analysis was used. RESULTS: For hourglass homogeneous specimens, K(t) equaled 1. 32 and 1. 12 for a notch radius of 0. 6 mm and 3. 3 mm, respectively. A non-uniform axial (sigma(zz)) {{stress distribution}} {{was found in the}} <b>notch</b> cross-section, with <b>values</b> at the outer edge being 78 % and 25 % larger than at the center. In addition, a triaxial stress state was generated. Stick-shaped and dumbbell homogeneous specimens presented K(t) = 1 and a uniform, uniaxial stress distribution along the entire cross-section. Shear stresses were zero for all homogeneous specimens. When an adhesive interface was added to the stick-shaped specimen, an area of localized axial stress concentration (K(t) = 1. 55) was detected at the bimaterial joint near the outer edge. Normal stresses sigma(rr) and sigma(thetatheta) and shear stress tau(zr) were also non-zero at the free-edge. CONCLUSIONS: Dumbbell or stick-shaped specimens are favored for muTBS testing, as they do not present stress concentrations due to geometry. However, dissimilar mechanical properties of joint components will lead to stress concentrations and non-uniform multi-axial stresses, although to a lesser extent. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|In {{an earlier}} work, an {{ultrahigh}} strength steel, designated as 0. 3 C-CrMoV ESR (0. 3 C- 1. 0 Mo- 0. 3 V), {{which is a}} modified version of AFNOR 15 CDV 6 steel, has been developed by increasing carbon content from 0. 15 to 0. 28 % and by processing the steel through electroslag refining (ESR) with inoculation by either niobium or zirconium during ESR. Depending on the quench rate, the ultimate tensile strength (UTS), 0. 2 % proof stress (PS), percentage of elongation and Charpy U <b>notch</b> impact energy <b>values</b> of the steel in the as cast condition after heat treatment varied at ranges of 1550 - 1560 MPa, 1500 - 1520 MPa, 8 - 12. 5 % and 370 - 790 kJ m 22 respectively. The microstructure of the 0. 3 C-CrMoV steel is reported to consist of martensite and bainite. In the present investigation, the UTS and 0. 2 % PS have been further increasd to 1740 - 1760 and 1570 1610 MPa respectively by increasing the chromium content of the 0. 3 C-CrMoV steel to 4 % and by subjecting the steel to ESR with inoculation by titanium. Interestingly, the percentage of elongation also increased to 14 % simultaneously with UTS and PS without any drop in the Charpy U notch impact energy. The improvement in the mechanical properties of the steel with increasing chromium content may be attributed to an increase in the volume fraction of the martensite in the mixed martensite and bainite microstructure...|$|R
40|$|In this work, {{reflection}} and transmission of shear waves from discontinuities in a plate waveguide are investigated using both analytical and finite element models. The study {{is motivated by}} the important role played by guided waves in nondestructive applications, ranging from detection of corrosion or cracks to {{the evaluation of the}} state of prestress [1]. In comparison to conventional ultrasonic methods, the advantage of guided waves is their larger inspection range, moreover, if compared to modal analysis they exhibit greater sensitivity because of the use of ultrasonic frequencies. Practical guided-wave ultrasonic testing is done by sending a signal along a waveguide and interpreting reflected and transmitted fields. In the presence of a discontinuity, this response consists of a complex superposition of waves. The characteristics of a discontinuity are related to the amplitude of scattered fields to obtain a quantitative evaluation of the discontinuity itself, and hence solve the inverse problem. The analytical model presented here makes use of the principle of reciprocity in elastodynamics [2, 3] to derive coefficients of {{reflection and}} transmission of a given incident wave from symmetric and asymmetric discontinuities [4]. The kinds of discontinuities considered are double sharp changes of cross-section, which conventionally represent notches. In parallel, finite element models are developed to corroborate analytical results. The change of reflection and transmission coefficients as a function of notch depth and extension is discussed for different values of the ratio wavelength/notch extension. It has been shown that, to detect small <b>notches,</b> a <b>value</b> of such ratio smaller or equal to 1 is required, meaning the need for high frequencies [5]. In this work it is shown that high frequencies are necessary not only to make the notch observable, but also to be able to observe its asymmetry, which requires that at least the cutoff frequency of the first asymmetric wave mode is exceeded.

40|$|Purpose It {{has been}} {{hypothesized}} that femoral notching in total knee arthroplasties weakens the cortex of the femur, which can predispose to femoral fractures in the postoperative period. Some authors suggest that patients who sustain inadvertent notching should have additional {{protection in the}} postoperative period, and consideration {{should be given to}} the use of prophylactic femoral stems. In this case, a question can be raised: Is the use of femoral stem in an anterior femoral notching an effective way to reduce the fracture risk? We hypothesized that for a larger notch, the use of a femoral stem does not decrease considerably the stress-riser at the notch edge, and the use of stem is not enough {{to reduce the risk of}} fracture. Methods In the present in vitro study, twelve synthetic femurs were selected and used for the experiments under two load scenarios. Femoral components with and without femoral stems were implanted in femurs with different notch sizes to predict experimentally the strain levels at the notch edge with the use of fiber Bragg gratings and at notch region with strain gauges. Results Despite the global strain reduction in stemmed condition, at the notch edge, the strain behavior was dissimilar for the different notch depths. For notch depths lower than 5 mm, the use of stem reduces the strain level at the <b>notch</b> edge to <b>values</b> below the intact femur condition, while for depths greater or equal to 5 mm, the strain levels at the notch edge were higher than the intact femur condition with values ranging from ? 10 to ? 189 %. Conclusions The present study suggests the use of a prophylactic stem for notch depths greater than 5 mm. For notch depths below 5 mm, the fracture risk due to strain increase at the notch edge seems to be low in the stemless condition...|$|R
