5|$|The Medway valley {{has long}} been {{associated}} with the <b>newsprint</b> industry, but in February 2015 it was confirmed that the last major paper mill in the parish, Aylesford <b>Newsprint,</b> was to close with the loss of 233 jobs. Ditton's connection with the industry goes back to 1922 when the first factory was built by Reed International {{on the banks of the}} river Medway. Reed International were a major paper manufacturer which, at its height, had in the region of 1,500 employees. The business was seriously hampered by the advent of World War II, which caused a shortage of pulp to make newspapers and led to a different material, waste paper, being used in its place. Waste paper was then replaced by recycled fibre, which was fully utilised in the process of producing <b>newsprint.</b> The 60-acre <b>Newsprint</b> plant belonged to SCA, paper manufacturers from Sweden, in partnership with Mondi, and £250 million was invested in developing the site. Aylesford <b>Newsprint</b> was one of the world's leading manufacturers of <b>newsprint,</b> recycling around 500,000 tonnes of material to produce some 400,000 tonnes of final product. Media organisations in Europe, America and the Far East relied on the recycled <b>newsprint</b> from the plant for their publications. Ditton stream was a vital water supply for the processes carried out in the plant.|$|E
5|$|From 1932 until 2008 {{the site}} was owned by News International, which used it to import <b>newsprint</b> and other paper {{products}} from Finland until early 2000. It is now owned by Hutchison Whampoa Limited and is subject to a planning application to convert it into residential units, though it has safeguarded wharf status.|$|E
5|$|More recently, ragstone and <b>newsprint</b> {{industries}} have developed and become important sources of local employment. The {{population of the}} village grew rapidly with the overspill of housing from {{the nearby town of}} Maidstone. Today Ditton has a mixed agricultural and industrial economy, {{with a wide range of}} social and leisure facilities. In 2001 it had a population of 4,786.|$|E

50|$|Boone {{wanted to}} publish Morgan’s {{letter in the}} {{newspaper}} but she refused, citing her agreement with the library to not publish any more letters. Boone insisted, telling her that publicly stating her views would inspire others. Morgan relented and on January 14, 1957 the Tuscaloosa <b>Newsprinted</b> her letter.|$|R
5|$|The Irish Shipping fleet imported, {{across the}} Atlantic: 712,000 tons of wheat, 178,000 tons of coal, 63,000 tons of {{phosphate}} (for fertilizer), 24,000 tons of tobacco, 19,000 tons of <b>newsprint,</b> 10,000 tons of timber and 105,000 tons of assorted other cargo. Figures {{from the other}} shipping companies have not survived.|$|E
5|$|Until {{the end of}} the 20thcentury, the Ouse {{was used}} by barges to carry freight between York and the port of Hull. The last {{significant}} traffic was the supply of <b>newsprint</b> to the local newspaper's Foss-side print works, which continued until 1997. Today navigation is almost exclusively leisure-oriented.|$|E
5|$|Just {{before the}} Japanese {{surrender}} {{that ended the}} war, News-Miner editor David Tewkesbury died. He was replaced by Art Bremer, a reporter. The post-war boom caused a sudden shortage of <b>newsprint,</b> as paper mills {{were not able to}} meet the demand {{of a growing number of}} newspapers nationwide. This shortage caused the News-Miner to run short until Lathrop used his industrial connections to divert a shipment from a newspaper that was going out of business.|$|E

50|$|The {{control over}} the media was reached through {{different}} strategies. On the one hand, the legal framework on the media system was purposefully left chaotic, while the state maintained the monopoly over the distribution of frequencies and production of <b>newsprints,</b> printing facilities, and distribution networks. Moreover, non-aligned journalists, media outlets and media advertisers were harassed, jammed and/or forcefully closed down - particularly if perceived as dangerous to the government, such as elections, the 1996-97 mass demonstrations, and the 1998-99 war in Kosovo.|$|R
5000|$|Recycling {{has been}} used in art since {{the early part of the}} 20th century, when cubist artist Pablo Picasso (1881-1973) and Georges Braque (1882-1963) created collages from <b>newsprints,</b> {{packaging}} and other found materials. The [...] "Outside Art" [...] movement is recognized as a genuine expressive art form, and is celebrated because of the materials used and not in spite of them. The same principle can be used inside the home, where found objects are now displayed with pride and collecting certain objects and materials to furnish a home is now admired rather than looked down upon.|$|R
5|$|To {{promote the}} retail release of The King of Limbs, Radiohead {{distributed}} a free single-issue newspaper, the Universal Sigh, at independent record shops {{across the world}} on 28 March 2011. Donwood and Yorke distributed copies in person at a record shop in east London. Influenced by free newspapers such as LA Weekly or London Lite, the Universal Sigh is a 12-page tabloid printed using web-offset lithography on <b>newsprint</b> paper and features artwork, poetry, and lyrics along with short stories by Donwood, Jay Griffiths and Robert Macfarlane.|$|E
5|$|The Silver Age {{coincided with}} the rise of pop art, an artistic {{movement}} that used popular cultural artifacts, such as advertising and packaging, as source material for fine, or gallery-exhibited, art. Roy Lichtenstein, one of the best-known pop art painters, specifically chose individual panels from comic books and repainted the images, modifying them to some extent in the process but including in the painting word and thought balloons and captions as well as enlarged-to-scale color dots imitating the coloring process then used in <b>newsprint</b> comic books. An exhibition of comic strip art was held at the Musée des Arts Décoratifs of the Palais de Louvre in 1967, and books were soon published that contained serious discussions of the art of comics {{and the nature of the}} medium.|$|E
5|$|The {{availability}} {{of water to}} transport products and raw materials, and as a resource used {{in the manufacture of}} paper, was essential to the historical development of paper mills in the area. Bradbourne stream, which meanders through the parish in a south-east to north-west direction, rises in East Malling, crosses under the A20 road and M20 motorway, and joins the river Medway near the Aylesford <b>Newsprint</b> site. Historically the {{availability of}} running water was essential to the early settlements that grew up in Kent, and to the establishment of industries in the area; such as providing power to drive the mills which ground grain.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, Zigi used {{discarded}} <b>newsprints</b> and industrial paper, which he {{found on the}} streets of SoHo to construct his formations in paper, 3-dimensional paintings, collages and sculptures. Many of these works are in collections of museums around the world. In the early 1990s, the industrial aluminum material replaced the found paper. He has been creating paintings, 3 dimensional installations, indoor and outdoor sculptures until today. From time to time, he finds himself experimenting with other materials like concrete, film, ropes, burlap to make his conceptual point- creating footprints of culture and nature as they collide and coincide to form a new experience.|$|R
5000|$|In November 1989 Dirk Mudge {{founded the}} Democratic Media Trust of Namibia, an agency funding <b>newsprinting</b> in Namibia {{with the mission}} to [...] "promote a free and {{independent}} media in Namibia". For the establishment of this trust, money was used that was originally meant to fight SWAPO in the 1989 independence elections. The trust owned Democratic Media Holdings which in turn owned John Meinert Printing, Namibia's biggest newspaper printing works. By 2007 the trust had sold its remaining stakes in the printing industry and became a charity dedicated to education and development. Mudge {{was chairman of the}} Board of Directors of the trust until 2008.|$|R
40|$|Often simplistic and misleading, the {{reporting}} {{of child sexual abuse}} has long been a staple of commercial news media's portrayal of crime and criminal justice. A mixed quantitative/qualitative content analysis methodology is applied to the study of three Toronto-based newspaper's construction of Internet Child Luring, between the 1 st of January, 1998, and August 1 st, 2008. Erected as a serious problem, above which a sober appraisal of known facts could sustain, a Textual Panic is said to exist within <b>newsprint's</b> rendering of the information-age crime. Rational cogitating offenders, undeterred by weak legislation and underfunded police forces, are described as exploiting the communication medium in attempts to lure defenseless children into illicit sexual activity...|$|R
5|$|The inaugural {{edition of}} the Echo was printed in Press Lane, Sunderland on 22 December 1873; 1,000 copies were {{produced}} and sold for a halfpenny each. The Echo survived intense competition in its early years, {{as well as the}} depression of the 1930s and two World Wars. Sunderland was heavily bombed in the Second World War and, although the Echo building was undamaged, it was forced to print its competitor's paper under wartime rules. It was during this time that the paper's format changed, from a broadsheet to its current tabloid layout, because of national <b>newsprint</b> shortages.|$|E
5|$|World War I brought its own {{difficulties}} for the Echo. Reporters {{went off to}} battle and, after the cost of <b>newsprint</b> soared, the paper was forced to double in price to a penny. The Echos 50th anniversary in 1923 was marked by a visit from company chairman Samuel Storey. Storey died two years later, three months after his eldest son Fred, and the chairmanship passed to another Samuel—Fred's elder son. In the same year, plans were laid to improve the Bridge Street premises. The work included enlarging the printing works and was completed {{by the end of}} the 1920s.|$|E
5|$|The Second World War brought havoc to Wearside, with Sunderland one of {{the seven}} most heavily bombed towns in the country. Despite the heavy {{shelling}} of the North East coast and River Wear, the Echo offices and printing plant escaped undamaged. The Shields Gazette, the Echo's nearest rival, was not as fortunate. Its premises in Chapter Row, South Shields, were bombed in September 1941 and, under an emergency wartime arrangement, the paper was printed on the Echo presses. The Echo continued to be published throughout the war, despite paper rationing, a lack of reporters and a strict censorship of photographs. The war did have one major impact on the Echo—in the form of its size. Wartime restrictions on <b>newsprint</b> reduced the former broadsheet to its present tabloid size, and this style has been retained ever since.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In {{order to}} explore the {{influence}} of ink viscosity on its permeability inside paper, three <b>newsprints</b> and three offset paper were firstly chosen to test their basis properties, then 5 ink samples including the original ink were prepared via adding different percentage printing varnish and their viscosities were measured. Under the definite printing condition, the 5 ink samples were printed on the surface of 6 papers with a printability tester respectively. At last, the ink penetrations inside these papers were all tested with a metallographic microscope. The study showed that the decreasing of ink viscosity would lead to the increasing of ink penetration depth, and paper properties had some effects on the ink permeability...|$|R
40|$|The {{widespread}} {{view that}} newspapers, even in Australia, are suffering major declines is flawed, reflecting {{in part a}} North American and Eurocentric view of the press. Australian newspapers are faring better than many in the developed countries. Quality newspapers, with their clearly defined and targeted markets, are outperforming their tabloid counterparts. A fair assessment of newspaper performance needs to consider not only the circulation figures, but also readership and newspapers’ online reach. The latter is significant, as unlike the US and the UK, the main newspaper publishers Fairfax and News Limited dominate the online news field. Regardless of quantitative measures, newspapers have unique properties that will probably ensure <b>newsprint’s</b> survival in the digital era...|$|R

5|$|The Docks {{had been}} {{gradually}} declining from the 18th century; the larger ships being built found The Thames difficult to navigate, and Deptford was under {{competition from the}} new docks at Plymouth, Portsmouth and Chatham. When the Napoleonic Wars ended in 1815 {{the need for a}} Docks to build and repair warships declined; the Docks shifted from shipbuilding to concentrate on victualling at the Royal Victoria Victualling Yard, and the Royal Dock closed in 1869. From 1871 until the First World War the shipyard site was the City of London Corporation's Foreign Cattle Market, in which girls and women butchered sheep and cattle until {{the early part of the}} 20th century. At its peak, around 1907, over 234,000 animals were imported annually through the market, but by 1912 these figures had declined to less than 40,000 a year. The yard was taken over by the War Office in 1914, and was an Army Supply Reserve Depot in the First and Second World Wars. The site lay unused until being purchased by Convoys (<b>newsprint</b> importers) in 1984, and eventually came into the ownership of News International. In the mid-1990s, although significant investment was made on the site, it became uneconomic to continue using it as a freight wharf. In 2008 Hutchison Whampoa bought the 16ha site from News International with plans for a £700m 3,500-home development scheme. The Grade II listed Olympia Warehouse will be refurbished as part of the redevelopment of the site.|$|E
25|$|Only {{ten percent}} of the <b>newsprint</b> {{production}} could be sold domestically. The main Norwegian competitors, Union Co. and Follum, had joined forces with Swedish and Finnish counterparts to form the <b>newsprint</b> sales organization Scannews. Nordenfjelske was barred for entering the cartel and instead chose to ally with Borregaard. They formed the joint venture Borregaard & Nordenfjelske on 1 October 1964, in anticipation for Borregaard to start their own <b>newsprint</b> mill. This continued onwards even after Borregaard shelved their <b>newsprint</b> plans.|$|E
25|$|The Valley Press was famed locally {{from the}} late 1950s for its peach-colored <b>newsprint</b> while under the Odett/Markham family ownership. The paper stopped using peach <b>newsprint</b> in 1975 due to expense and the {{increased}} use of color ink.|$|E

30|$|The {{conflict}} in the South China Sea is neither an outcome {{of the rise of}} China nor the return of the US to the Asia Pacific. For centuries, countries have wrestled for their rights to the area. Today, the two main flashpoints of territorial sovereignty are the island chains of the Spratlys and the Paracels and the Scarborough Shoal. The recent tensions in the SCS have been frequently on the radar of <b>newsprints,</b> the media, government think-tanks, academia, and policy analysts. Scholarly articles, books, and policy papers analyzing the recent tensions have flourished, inflaming the debates on the causes of the tensions and its implications to the stability of the East Asian region. Most of these studies, for obvious reasons, have focused on China’s increasingly aggressive foreign policy behavior in the SCS from external and internal sources, how it affects its relations with individual claimant countries or with ASEAN in general, and implications for US–China relations. These perspectives can be broadly categorized into three: realist assessments, which posit the significance of the material dimensions and changes in the international structure; the domestic political approach based on the role of nationalism; and the normative solution process through the UNCLOS.|$|R
40|$|It is {{prerequisite}} to extract Ribonucleic Acid (RNA) with high quality and integrity {{in order to}} carry out molecular biology studies in any plant species. Samples collected from remote fields require preservation before being processed for RNA extraction and downstream process like RT-PCR, real time PCR and genome-wide expression studies. It is therefore important to identify efficient and reliable sample storage methods that stabilize RNA, protecting it from the activities of RNAse in intact samples before analysis. This {{study was designed to}} evaluate the effect of different storage conditions for passion fruit leaves on RNA quality and suitability for RT-PCR for two time-points; one week and two weeks post-harvest. Passion fruit leaf samples with suspected viral symptoms were collected from the field and stored using FTA® cards, RNAlater solution, cold ice followed by transfer to - 80 °C freezer, drying on silica gel and drying in between the sheets of <b>newsprints</b> (as herbarium). The samples were kept for 1 and 2 weeks before RNA extraction and subsequent semi-quantitative RT-PCR to amplify the housekeeping genes AtropaNad and Cowpea Aphid Borne Mosaic Virus(CABMV); one of the major viruses causing passion fruit woodiness disease in Kenya. Good RNA yield and quality were obtained from samples stored in silica gel for 1 and 2 weeks after collection similar to - 80 °C frozen samples a choice preservation method by many laboratories all over the world. Further results confirmed that RNA extracted from samples stored in silica gel was fit for RT-PCR amplification. This study shows that RNA of good yield and quality that is useful for downstream applications can be obtained from passion fruit leaf samples stored in silica gel. Peer Revie...|$|R
