5|$|Lead's high density, atomic number, and {{formability}} {{form the}} basis for use of lead as a barrier that absorbs sound, vibration, and radiation. Lead has no <b>natural</b> <b>resonance</b> frequencies; as a result, sheet-lead is used as a sound deadening layer in the walls, floors, and ceilings of sound studios. Organ pipes are often made from a lead alloy, mixed with various amounts of tin to control the tone of each pipe. Lead is an established shielding material from radiation in nuclear science and in X-ray rooms due to its denseness and high attenuation coefficient.

5|$|The {{mechanism}} may be internal to the Earth system. The Earth's {{climate system}} {{may have a}} <b>natural</b> <b>resonance</b> frequency of 100ka; that is to say, feedback processes within the climate automatically produce a 100ka effect, much as a bell naturally rings at a certain pitch. Opponents to this claim {{point out that the}} resonance would have to have developed 1 million years ago, as a 100ka periodicity was weak to non-existent for the preceding 2million years. This is feasible—continental drift and sea floor spreading rate change have been postulated as possible causes of such a change. Free oscillations of components of the Earth system have been considered as a cause, but too few Earth systems have a thermal inertia on a thousand-year timescale for any long-term changes to accumulate. The most common hypothesis looks to the Northern Hemisphere ice sheets, which might expand through a few shorter cycles until large enough to undergo a sudden collapse. The 100,000-year problem has been scrutinized by José A. Rial, Jeseung Oh and Elizabeth Reischmann who find that master-slave synchronization between the climate systems natural frequencies and the eccentricity forcing started the 100 ky ice ages of the late Pleistocene and explain their large amplitude.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, a new {{classification}} scheme for radar target recognition is described. It uses a MLP neural network as classifier and complex <b>natural</b> <b>resonances</b> as inputs of the net. Benefit of using <b>natural</b> <b>resonances</b> {{is that they}} are aspect angle independent, i. e. scattering responses from different aspect angles of the same target can be represented by the same <b>natural</b> <b>resonances.</b> But the extraction process of <b>natural</b> <b>resonances</b> is an illconditioned problem and noise affects the parameter estimation. To improve the sensitivity to noise, it is proposed an algorithm that extracts the resonances from a reconstructed response generated by a PCA stage over a set of reference targets, prior to the MLP neural network classifier...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The {{detection}} and identification of metal items and, in particular weapons, of linear size ≥ 10 cm, concealed upon the human body, is demonstrated as being entirely feasible {{by using a}} phased array of suitably ultra wide band transceivers. The complex <b>natural</b> <b>resonances</b> and especially the fundamental resonance, are excited by ultra wide band, stepped frequency continuous wave illumination of the target, using a phased array of antennae to focus the radiation. Broadband illumination of the target with microwave radiation of suitable frequency range (Typically 0. 3 – 3 GHz for handgun sized objects) excites low order complex <b>natural</b> <b>resonances</b> and the late time response of the concealed item can be spatially located using phased array imaging techniques. Further processing of the late time response enables classification of the concealed object, based on the complex natural resonant frequencies of the object, so that threat items such as handguns and knives can be differentiated from benign items such as mobile phone handsets and cameras. 1...|$|R
25|$|Dyson also {{produced}} buildings with arced forms. The Lencioni house (1985) in Sanger, California, produced a particularly unique two story oval form {{that was also}} widely recognized. Appearing in popular magazines, professional journals, architectural yearbooks, and most recently in a college textbook, the composition was cited by important critics such as Bruno Zevi as a superior expression of organic architectural principles. In the award-winning Tuxford-Barrett residence (1987) in Richland Center, Wisconsin, curvilinear massing was refined {{through the development of}} two successive schemes. Unfolding in shape from a <b>natural</b> <b>resonance</b> with the slope of the hillside, the curvature of the earth-enclosed foundation wall embraced an interior space divided into living, working, and sleeping areas. A terrace extruded by the use of earth from the construction excavation extended the living space into an arboreal setting of trees rooted down grade of the building. This house was also lauded by Bruno Zevi in the same article where he extolled the Lencioni house design. Two unbuilt house designs by Dyson used similar oval pod forms. The plan for the Carlson residence (1981) in Van Nuys, California, occupied an exceptionally steep building site with an integrated system of cantilevered pods. The Millerton house project (1984) in Madera County, California, for a similarly difficult site grouped the pods with a connecting bridge over a rocky cleft and also responded to an environmentally exposed position by incorporating a Teflon roof covering supported by a steel frame for thermal regulation. Dyson further developed a curvilinear form for the Glynns Restaurant (1984) in Fresno, California, that incorporated round light tower elements which would evolve and feature significantly in later projects.|$|E

5000|$|In {{practice}} an electrically small antenna is {{one that}} is operated at a frequency below its <b>natural</b> <b>resonance.</b> [...] Small antennas are characterised by low radiation resistance and relatively high reactance, so that a tuning component must be added in series with the antenna to cancel its reactance and assist matching to the circuit to which it is connected. The addition of this extra component creates a tuned circuit, with a Q-factor that potentially limits the instantaneous bandwidth available for signals passing through the antenna. This is a fundamental limit that sets a minimum size for any antenna used at a given frequency and with a given required bandwidth.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{important}} consideration is that head tension can greatly impact the ease or unease of the player, and generally a looser drumhead {{can lead to}} hand injury more than a tighter one, because a looser drumhead has less rebound and more muffling effect (hence potentially bruising joints and bones under spirited playing). Also, producing a crisp slap tone is nearly impossible on a loose head.
