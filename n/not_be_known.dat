25|$|By {{a similar}} token, Cocoa {{provides}} a pervasive data manipulation method called key-value coding (KVC). This allows {{a piece of}} data or property of an object to be looked up or changed at runtime by name. The property name acts {{as a key to}} the value. In traditional languages, this late binding is impossible. KVC leads to great design flexibility. An object's type need <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>known,</b> yet any property of that object can be discovered using KVC. Also, by extending this system using something Cocoa terms key-value observing (KVO), automatic support for undo-redo is provided.|$|E

With current technology {{leading to the}} globalization of information, this is becoming increasingly less of a challenge provided the TCKs use modern technology in their host cultures to connect to their home culture. Understanding a culture’s sense of humor, however, is a commonly cited difficulty with the transition back to a home culture. There are also general societal norms and practices that will <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>known</b> when a TCK is first re-introduced to his/her home culture but those are eventually learned.|$|E
25|$|In the August 20, 2006 Chiapas state {{election}} for governor claims {{of fraud and}} irregularities {{were made by the}} parties opposing Juan José Sabines Guerrero who represented the Coalition for the Good of All (PRD, PT, Convergence).

Media articles at that time noted that final results would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>known</b> until the state Electoral Institute had resolved the large number of result review filings that were lodged, chiefly by the PRI-led Alliance for Chiapas (PRI and PVEM). Media articles noted that this election mirrored the presidential election in that it was a close election where fraud and irregularities were claimed, but that the roles of the right- and left-wing parties were reversed.|$|E

25|$|At midday on 2 June, German {{authorities}} {{released a}} press statement claiming a victory, including {{the destruction of}} a battleship, two battlecruisers, two armoured cruisers, a light cruiser, a submarine and several destroyers, for the loss of Pommern and Wiesbaden. News that Lützow, Elbing and Rostock had been scuttled was withheld, on the grounds this information would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>known</b> to the enemy. The victory of the Skagerrak was celebrated in the press, children were given a holiday and the nation celebrated. The Kaiser announced a new chapter in world history. Post-war, the official German history hailed the battle as a victory and it continued to be celebrated until after World War II.|$|E
25|$|Spontaneous {{fluctuations}} in global climate might explain past variability. It {{is very difficult}} to know what the true level of variability from only internal causes might be since other forcings, as noted above, exist whose magnitude may <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>known</b> either. One approach to evaluating internal variability is to use long integrations of coupled ocean-atmosphere global climate models. They have the advantage that the external forcing is known to be zero, but the disadvantage is that they may not fully reflect reality. The variations may result from chaos-driven changes in the oceans, the atmosphere, or interactions between the two. Two studies have concluded that the demonstrated inherent variability is not great enough to account for the Little Ice Age.|$|E
25|$|If {{the final}} image is viewed under normal {{conditions}} (e.g., an 8″×10″ image viewed at 10″), it may suffice {{to determine the}} f-number using criteria for minimum required sharpness, {{and there may be}} no practical benefit from further reducing the size of the blur spot. But this may not be true if the final image is viewed under more demanding conditions, e.g., a very large final image viewed at normal distance, or a portion of an image enlarged to normal size (Hansma 1996). Hansma also suggests that the final-image size may <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>known</b> when a photograph is taken, and obtaining the maximum practicable sharpness allows the decision to make a large final image to be made at a later time.|$|E

25|$|The Franco-Spanish fleet was {{involved}} in the indecisive Battle of Cape Finisterre in fog off Ferrol with Admiral Sir Robert Calder's squadron on 22 July, before taking refuge in Vigo and Ferrol. Calder on 14 August and Nelson on 15 August joined Admiral Cornwallis's Channel Fleet off Ushant. Nelson continued on to England in Victory, leaving his Mediterranean fleet with Cornwallis who detached twenty of his thirty-three ships of the line and sent them under Calder to find the combined fleet at Ferrol. On 19 August came the worrying news that the enemy had sailed from there, followed by relief when they arrived in Cádiz two days later. On the evening of Saturday, 28 September, Lord Nelson joined Lord Collingwood's fleet off Cádiz, quietly, so that his presence would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>known.</b>|$|E
25|$|CP {{is not a}} {{progressive}} disorder (meaning the brain damage does not worsen), but the symptoms can become more severe over time. A person with the disorder may improve somewhat during childhood {{if he or she}} receives extensive care, but once bones and musculature become more established, orthopedic surgery may be required. The full intellectual potential of a child born with CP will often <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>known</b> until the child starts school. People with CP {{are more likely to have}} learning disabilities, although these may be unrelated to IQ, including varying degrees of intellectual disability. Intellectual level among people with CP varies from genius to intellectually impaired, as it does in the general population, and experts have stated that it is important not to underestimate the capabilities of a person with CP and to give them every opportunity to learn.|$|E
25|$|DNA {{sequencing}} theories often {{invoke the}} assumption that certain random variables in a model are independent and identically distributed. For example, in Lander–Waterman Theory, a sequenced fragment is presumed {{to have the same}} probability of covering each region of a genome and all fragments are assumed to be independent of one another. In actuality, sequencing projects are subject to various types of bias, including differences of how well regions can be cloned, sequencing anomalies, biases in the target sequence (which is not random), and software-dependent errors and biases. In general, theory will agree well with observation up to the point that enough data have been generated to expose latent biases. The kinds of biases related to the underlying target sequence are particularly difficult to model, since the sequence itself may <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>known</b> a priori. This presents a type of Catch-22 (logic) problem.|$|E

25|$|Although {{originally}} pioneered in the 1960s, dynamic linking did {{not reach}} operating systems used by consumers until the late 1980s. It was generally available in some form in most operating systems by the early 1990s. During this same period, object-oriented programming (OOP) was becoming {{a significant part of}} the programming landscape. OOP with runtime binding requires additional information that traditional libraries don't supply. In addition to the names and entry points of the code located within, they also require a list of the objects they depend on. This is a side-effect of one of OOP's main advantages, inheritance, which means that parts of the complete definition of any method may be in different places. This is more than simply listing that one library requires the services of another: in a true OOP system, the libraries themselves may <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>known</b> at compile time, and vary from system to system.|$|E
25|$|The age {{required}} {{to have the right}} to vote had been reduced from 18 to 16 prior to the election in an electoral law reform enacted in 2007, which also had reduced the age {{required to}} stand in the election from 19 to 18, had introduced easier access to postal balloting and had lengthened the legislative term from four to five years. Another change was that different list names in the different states were no longer possible; the BZÖ had stood under a different name in Carinthia than in the rest of Austria in 2006. Turnout was initially expected to increase from the all-time low of 78.5% in 2006; more than 80% were expected to participate in the election according to early estimates, but it expectations changed to a decrease of turnout as the election day came closer. Postal balloting was expected to make up 7%–8% of the total vote; due to postal votes, the final result of the election would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>known</b> until a week after the elections (on 6 October 2008). Postal ballots had to be sent to electoral commission together with a signed piece of paper stating the time and place when the vote had taken place; at a spot check in Salzburg, 20% of postal ballots were invalid because they lacked the signature or time and place. 9.27% of the voters (586,759 of 6,332,931 voters) had requested postal ballots, which meant that postal ballots could decisively change the election outcome.|$|E
