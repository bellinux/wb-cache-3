40|$|Twenty-five lead-exposed Danish battery {{production}} {{workers and}} 25 -age-matched controls were examined to evaluate subclinical effects on blood formation. Blood lead levels averaged 2. 14 mumol/L and 0. 35 mumol/L {{in the two}} groups; the lead workers also showed high levels of erythrocyte protoporphyrin, {{as compared to the}} controls. Otherwise, the hematological parameters indicated an appropriate iron status and no other deviations. From all subjects, 0. 45 L of blood was bled as part of a <b>normal</b> <b>blood</b> <b>donation.</b> Five and 11 days later, reticulocyte counts were significantly higher in the control group than in the lead-exposed workers. On day 15, the lead workers showed a significant delay in blood regeneration, as evidenced by lower hemoglobin concentration, and erythrocyte and reticulocyte counts. The lead exposure {{in the present study was}} within legal limits, and lead-induced anemia would be expected only at much higher exposure levels. Thus, despite the normal hematological findings in the initial examination, the lead exposure caused a decreased reserve capacity for blood formation, and this effect became evident only after the blood loss...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: It is {{necessary}} to understand whether some humans possess natural humoral-immune protection for avian-H 5 N 1 influenza. To broadly assess an exposure naïve cohort we have examined intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIGs) isolated from pools of many thousands of <b>normal</b> Australian <b>blood</b> <b>donations.</b> In studies of the anti-H 5 N 1 antibody poten-tial of these highly purified IVIG therapeutics and of individual donor sera we have identified antibodies that bind to both H 5 N 1 surface envelope and internal viral proteins and neutralize in vitro MDCK and Vero cell infections by highly pathogenic avian influenza clade I and II and human-derived H 5 N 1 isolates. As this reactivity is removed by adsorption with purified H 3 N 2 and H 1 N 1 strains, anti-H 5 N 1 cross-reacting hetero-typic antibodies are implicated. These findings support that some individuals do contain low levels of specific and neutralizing anti-H 5 N 1 antibodies. The protective relevance of this in vivo remains yet to be determined...|$|R

This study {{examines}} the influence of culture and communication on <b>blood</b> <b>donation</b> in Sub-Saharan Africa, with particular focus on Ghana. The literature was systematically reviewed for aspects of culture and communication that influence <b>blood</b> <b>donation</b> in Sub-Saharan Africa. Also, key informant interviews and focus group discussions with physicians, media professionals, and voluntary blood donors in Ghana were used, both to identify barriers to <b>blood</b> <b>donation</b> and to obtain some recommendations for designing interventions to boost <b>blood</b> <b>donation.</b> Literature searching yielded 3020 publications, including conference abstracts. Of them, 41 publications?representing 36 studies?met inclusion criteria and were critically appraised. Aspects of culture that were identified as influencing <b>blood</b> <b>donation</b> in Sub-Saharan Africa included blood donation-related misconceptions, religious beliefs, and influence of relatives. Communication channels that were identified for increasing <b>blood</b> <b>donation</b> included mass media, mobile phones, and face-to-face contacts. In Ghana, beliefs and attitudes of the public that were identified as barriers to <b>blood</b> <b>donations</b> included misconceptions about <b>blood</b> <b>donation,</b> such as the erroneous belief that hospital authorities were using donated blood for rituals. Some respondents perceived that health professionals have not educated the public and journalists enough about <b>blood</b> <b>donation.</b> Another perceived barrier to <b>blood</b> <b>donation</b> was negative media reporting, such as indicating the percentage of blood donors found to be HIV-positive. The lack of mutual trust between health professionals and journalists {{also served as a}} barrier to using the mass media to promote <b>blood</b> <b>donation.</b> To promote <b>blood</b> <b>donation,</b> respondents in Ghana suggested several strategies, including broadcasting radio or television dramas about <b>blood</b> <b>donation</b> in English and local languages to engage both literate and illiterate populations; providing media recognition of donors who achieve blood donation-related milestones; having blood donors serve as ambassadors of blood donor drives; using social media to engage prospective younger blood donors; and using mobile telephone caller tunes or ringback tones to publicize <b>blood</b> <b>donation.</b> Thus, many culture- and communication-related factors influence <b>blood</b> <b>donation</b> in Sub-Saharan Africa.

Education had {{positive influence on}} attitudes towards <b>blood</b> <b>donation</b> as well as blood donors’ satisfaction to the time and location of donation. The most common misconceptions about <b>blood</b> <b>donation</b> were the risk of infection; selling donated blood to patients, and that <b>blood</b> <b>donation</b> believed to cause physical weakness. AIMSThis paper is a report of a study of <b>blood</b> <b>donation</b> knowledge, attitudes and barriers. The aims {{of the study were}} to determine: (1) Jordanian blood donors’ level of knowledge of <b>blood</b> <b>donation.</b> (2) Jordanian <b>blood</b> donors’ attitudes towards donation. (3) Barriers influence <b>blood</b> <b>donation</b> in Jordan. METHODSA cross-sectional survey design was used to collect data from 500 blood donors between August 2011 and November 2011 using self-reported questionnaire. RESULTSRelatively inadequate knowledge about <b>blood</b> <b>donation</b> was found as only 28. 6 % of participants scored their knowledge above the average.

40|$|Research {{suggests}} that African migrants are often positively predisposed towards <b>blood</b> <b>donation,</b> but are under-represented in participation. A culturally-tailored intervention targeting the African migrant community in Australia {{was developed and}} implemented, to enhance knowledge about <b>blood</b> <b>donation,</b> improve attitudes towards donating, increase intentions to donate blood, and {{increase the number of}} new African donors in Australia. Four weeks after a targeted campaign, a survey evaluation process commenced, administered face-to-face by bilingual interviewers from the African community in Melbourne and Adelaide, Australia (community survey). The questionnaires covered demographics, campaign awareness, <b>blood</b> <b>donation</b> knowledge and intentions, medical mistrust and perceived discrimination, and were analysed to evaluate changes in knowledge and intention. Sixty-two percent of survey participants (n = 454) reported being aware of the campaign. With increasing campaign awareness, there was a 0. 28 increase in knowledge score (p =. 005); previous <b>blood</b> <b>donation</b> was also associated with an increased <b>blood</b> <b>donation</b> knowledge score. <b>Blood</b> <b>donation</b> intention scores were not associated with campaign awareness (p = 0. 272), but were associated with previous <b>blood</b> <b>donation</b> behaviour and a positive <b>blood</b> <b>donation</b> attitude score. More positive scores on the <b>blood</b> <b>donation</b> attitude measure were associated with increasing <b>blood</b> <b>donation</b> intentions, self-efficacy and campaign awareness (score increases of 0. 27, 0. 30 and 0. 04, respectively, all p< 0. 05). Data were collected on the ethnicity of new blood donors in six blood collection centres before and after the intervention, and independent of the intervention evaluation survey. These data were also used to assess behavioural changes and the proportions of donors from different countries before and after the survey. There was no difference in the number of new African migrant donors, before and after the intervention. The culturally-relevant marketing campaign was associated with improved <b>blood</b> <b>donation</b> knowledge and attitudes, but there was no short-term change in <b>blood</b> <b>donation</b> intentions or the number of African donors...|$|R
40|$|The study {{explores the}} {{relationship}} between public relations strategies regarding <b>blood</b> <b>donation</b> in Thailand and audience responses to <b>blood</b> <b>donation</b> {{on the part of}} blood donors and non-donors as a comparative case study in terms of a) demographics, media exposure to <b>blood</b> and <b>blood</b> <b>donation</b> messages, knowledge of <b>blood</b> and <b>blood</b> <b>donation,</b> attitudes towards <b>blood</b> <b>donation,</b> and practices of <b>blood</b> <b>donation</b> and nondonation and b) <b>blood</b> and <b>blood</b> <b>donation</b> media messages. A variety of literature regarding public relations, communication, persuasion, and <b>blood</b> <b>donation</b> was reviewed and explained under a two-way, cyclical process of public relations, starting with analysing the situation, the programming and planning of communication objectives and goals and the defined target audiences, and communicating and implementing public relations strategies. The process ended with feedback and evaluation. To accomplish the objectives of the study, a mixed strategy of semi-structured in-depth interviews and documentary research was used for examining the communication source. Four hundred questionnaires and eight focus groups, divided equally to compare blood donors and non-donors, were employed to investigate responses to <b>blood</b> <b>donation.</b> The study revealed the importance of distributing <b>blood</b> and <b>blood</b> <b>donation</b> messages targeted to raise knowledge, inform attitudes and motivate behaviour change, through the controlled media supplemented by uncontrolled means and personal channels. Similarly, levels of education and knowledge, together with attitudes are all indicative factors in donating blood, while non-donors were lacking those variables. Important reasons for <b>blood</b> <b>donation</b> or non-donation were also, respectively, altruism and fear. Otherwise blood donors and non-donors mainly reflected similar responses to the media messages; however, non-donors made more requests for fear reduction and statistics and attached greater importance to message repetition.

40|$|Background: There is {{a serious}} {{mismatch}} between demand and availability of blood in our country. One of the important factors motivating people for donating blood is their interaction with staff of health facilities including support staff. The knowledge and perceptions of support staff about <b>blood</b> <b>donation</b> have not been studied adequately. Methodology: Data was collected from randomly selected 100 healthcare support staff using a pretested questionnaire. The questionnaire was based on prior qualitative analysis of perceptions of few of the potential participants. Results: 91 % of the respondents felt that <b>blood</b> <b>donation</b> was not safe. Only 16 % had adequate knowledge about eligibility for <b>blood</b> <b>donation</b> {{and all of them}} were females. 39 % respondents had donated blood themselves and 79 % had family history of <b>blood</b> <b>donation.</b> None of the socio-demographic factors except young age were found to be associated with better knowledge or positive perceptions about <b>blood</b> <b>donation.</b> Many among those who had donated blood also did not perceive <b>blood</b> <b>donation</b> as safe. Apprehension about blood being not properly used and not having been approached by anyone were commonest reasons for not donating. Conclusions: The knowledge about safety, eligibility and motivation for <b>blood</b> <b>donation</b> is very poor among the healthcare support staff. Efforts must be made to educate these employees and promote voluntary <b>blood</b> <b>donation</b> among them. Various incentives as suggested by employees themselves and several international bodies may be considered to promote <b>blood</b> <b>donation</b> among healthcare support staff...|$|R
