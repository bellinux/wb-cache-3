5|$|Sabrina {{asked her}} friends <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>discuss</b> her past as she {{believed}} her humble beginnings, and Day's mistreatment of her, would tarnish her reputation. Anna Seward nevertheless wrote about Sabrina's upbringing in her 1804 work Memoirs on the Life of Dr. Darwin. As Seward publicly identified Sabrina in the book, it was criticised by the press, and Sabrina's son John {{was very angry}} to learn of his mother's past. In his 1820 memoirs, Edgeworth stated his belief that Sabrina and Day made a good match and that she loved him. Sabrina disagreed with these accounts, saying that Day had made her miserable, {{and that she had}} effectively been a slave.|$|E
5|$|The crew celebrated Christmas aboard Monitor while berthed at Hampton Roads in {{what was}} {{described}} as a most merry fashion, while many other celebrations were occurring along the shore. The ship's cook was paid one dollar to prepare a meal for the crew befitting the day; it was received with mixed opinion. That day, Monitor was made ready for sea, her crew under strict orders <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>discuss</b> the impending voyage with anyone, but bad weather delayed her departure until 29 December.|$|E
5|$|As {{the head}} of research, Kaspersky {{authored}} papers on viruses and went to conferences to promote the software. He was often quoted in the technology press as an antivirus expert. He helped establish the company's Global Research and Expert Analysis Team (GReAT), which helps corporations and governments investigate IT security threats. Initially he told his team <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>discuss</b> cyber-terrorism publicly, to avoid giving governments {{ideas on how to}} sabotage their political opponents. After the American film Live Free or Die Hard (AKA Die Hard 4.0) (2007) was released, Kaspersky said the idea was now public. He hired the researcher that identified the Stuxnet worm, which {{is believed to be the}} first instance of state-sponsored cyberweapon. Afterwards, the company exposed the Flame virus at the request of the International Telecommunication Union. The virus was believed to have been used for cyber-espionage in Middle-Eastern countries.|$|E

25|$|Some (like the Liberals) of Sweden's {{major parties}} {{continue}} to believe {{it would be in}} the national interest to join, but all parties have pledged to abide by the results of the referendum, and none have shown any interest in raising the issue again. There was an agreement among the parties <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>discuss</b> the issue before the 2010 general election. In a poll from May 2007, 33.3% were in favour, while 53.8% were against and 13.0% were uncertain.|$|E
25|$|Lieutenant Colonel Steven L. Jordan {{became the}} second highest-ranking officer to have charges brought {{against him in}} {{connection}} with the Abu Ghraib abuse on April 29, 2006. Prior to his trial, eight of the twelve charges against him were dismissed, including two of the most serious, after Major General George Fay admitted that he did not read Jordan his rights before interviewing him. On August 28, 2007, Jordan was acquitted of all charges related to prisoner mistreatment, and received a reprimand for disobeying an order <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>discuss</b> a 2004 investigation into the allegations.|$|E
25|$|On June 3, 2010, the U.S. District Court of Northern Alabama charged Van der Sloot with {{extortion}} {{and wire}} fraud. On June 30, 2010, {{a federal grand}} jury formally indicted Van der Sloot of the two charges. The indictment filed with the U.S. District Court seeks the forfeiture of the $25,100 that had been paid to Van der Sloot from Holloway's private funds. Van der Sloot was apprehended on June 3 in Chile and is presently serving a 28-year prison sentence in a Peruvian prison for robbing and murdering 21-year-old Stephany Flores in Lima on the fifth anniversary of Natalee's disappearance. Although Twitty made television appearances as new developments arose, she was directed by the FBI <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>discuss</b> her daughter's case or that of Flores.|$|E

25|$|On July 29, Garfield {{met with}} his Cabinet for the only time during his illness; the members were under strict {{instruction}} from the doctors <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>discuss</b> anything upsetting. Garfield became increasingly ill {{over a period of}} several weeks due to infection, which caused his heart to weaken. He remained bedridden in the White House with fevers and extreme pains. Garfield's weight dropped from over two hundred pounds (90.7 kilograms) to 135 pounds (61.2 kilograms) as his inability to keep down and digest food took its toll. Because of his inability to digest food, nutrient enemas were given in an attempt to extend his life. Blood poisoning and infection set in and for a brief period the President suffered from hallucinations. Pus-filled abscesses spread all over Garfield's body as the infections raged.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the ensuing}} months, because of regular visits {{by the army}} during which they were threatened, harassed, and intimidated, most of the {{survivors}} abandoned the village for the mountains, other towns and villages, or Guatemala City. In 1985, they began to trickle back and were allowed to resettle in Plan de Sánchez and work their land, provided that they served in the PACs and remained subject at all times to military oversight. By 1987, some 20 families were again living in the village, albeit under strict orders from the military <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>discuss</b> the massacre. The harassment and threats from the military and paramilitaries continued, and the requirement that they patrol with the PACs was enforced, until the peace accords were signed and the civilian self-defence patrols were dissolved in 1996.|$|E
25|$|Global warming {{remains an}} issue of {{widespread}} political debate, often split along party political lines, especially in the United States. Many {{of the issues that}} are settled within the scientific community, such as human responsibility for global warming, remain the subject of politically or economically motivated attempts to downplay, dismiss or deny them—an ideological phenomenon categorised by academics and scientists as climate change denial. The sources of funding for those involved with climate science—both supporting and opposing mainstream scientific positions—have been questioned by both sides. There are debates about the best policy responses to the science, their cost-effectiveness and their urgency. Climate scientists, especially in the United States, have reported official and oil-industry pressure to censor or suppress their work and hide scientific data, with directives <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>discuss</b> the subject in public communications. Legal cases regarding global warming, its effects, and measures to reduce it have reached American courts. The fossil fuels lobby has been identified as overtly or covertly supporting efforts to undermine or discredit the scientific consensus on global warming.|$|E

25|$|Sadler {{presented}} {{this development}} to the group, and they generated hundreds of questions without full seriousness, but their claim {{is that it}} resulted in the appearance of answers {{in the form of}} fully written papers. They became more impressed with the quality of the answers and continued to ask questions, until all papers now collected together as The Urantia Book were obtained. The group was known as the Forum, and was formalized as a closed group of 30 members in 1925 who pledged <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>discuss</b> the material with others. Over time, some participants left and others joined, leading to a total membership of 486 people over the years from diverse backgrounds and a mix of interest levels. A smaller group of five individuals called the Contact Commission, including the Sadlers, was responsible for gathering the questions from the Forum, acting as the custodians of the handwritten manuscripts that were presented as answers, and arranging for proofreading and typing of the material. Bill Sadler, Jr. is noted to have composed the table of contents that is published with the book.|$|E

Grissom was intrigued by the program, but knew that competition for the final spots would be fierce.|$|E
500|$|The Washington Post {{reported}} that South Park fans [...] "struck back", in March 2006, {{and threatened to}} boycott Mission: Impossible III until Comedy Central put [...] "Trapped in the Closet" [...] back on its schedule. Melissa McNamara of CBS News later questioned whether this boycott hurt the Mission: Impossible III box office debut. The South Park creators did not comment directly on Comedy Central's decision to pull the episode, reportedly {{because they had been}} told <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>discuss</b> the matter to avoid embarrassing Cruise. Instead, they issued a statement to Variety on March 17, 2006, signing the statement, [...] "Trey Parker and Matt Stone, servants of the dark lord Xenu".|$|E

Ann explains her proficiency during Ron's self-defense training courses results from her strong interest in female-centric original movies on the women's television network Lifetime. While describing how Tom would react to the news that Jerry dislocated his shoulder reaching for a breakfast burrito, Leslie said, [...] "What would you do for a Klondike bar? Kill your wife?"

While Rasputin's visits to the children were, by all accounts, completely innocent in nature, the family was scandalized. Tyutcheva told Nicholas's sister, Grand Duchess Xenia Alexandrovna of Russia, that Rasputin visited the girls, talked with them while they were getting ready for bed, and hugged and patted them. Tyutcheva said the children had been taught <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>discuss</b> Rasputin with her and were careful to hide his visits from the nursery staff. Xenia wrote on March 15, 1910 that she couldn't understand [...] "...the attitude of Alix and the children to that sinister Grigory (whom they consider to be almost a saint, when in fact he's only a khlyst!)" ...|$|E

500|$|Late in 1953, Fisher {{moved to}} Brooklyn and rented {{a room in}} a {{boarding}} house on Hicks Street. He also rented a fifth-floor studio at the Ovington Studios Building on Fulton Street. Since he was posing {{as an artist and}} photographer, nobody questioned his irregular working hours and frequent disappearances. Over time his artistic technique improved and he became a competent painter, though he disliked abstract painting, preferring more conventional styles. He mingled with New York artists, who were surprised by his admiration for the Russian painter Isaak Levitan, although Fisher was careful <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>discuss</b> Stalinist [...] "socialist realism". The only visitors to Fisher's studio were artist friends with whom he felt safe from suspicion. In particular, he became a friend of Burton Silverman. Fisher would sometimes relate made-up stories of previous lives, as a Boston accountant and a lumberjack in the Pacific Northwest.|$|E
