Episodes would evolve from basic questions, including: [...] "what if someone {{had a crush on}} Lana, and acted on that obsession"; [...] "what if someone found out Clark's secret"; [...] "what if someone else had Clark's powers?" [...] These three questions developed into the episodes [...] "Metamorphosis", [...] "Rogue", and [...] "Leech", respectively. [...] "Stray", episode 16, answered the question, [...] "what if Clark had been adopted by the wrong parents and his powers were exploited?" [...] "X-Ray" [...] director Mark Verheiden {{and the rest of the}} crew realized divergent, unrelated storylines were <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>way</b> to create episodes for Smallville.

500|$|For Sesame Streets 30th {{anniversary in}} 1999, its {{producers}} researched {{the reasons for}} the show's lower ratings. [...] For {{the first time since the}} show debuted, the producers and a team of researchers analyzed Sesame Street content and structure during a series of two-week-long workshops. [...] They also studied how children's viewing habits had changed in the past thirty years. [...] They found that although the show was produced for those between the ages of three and five, children began watching it at a younger age. Preschool television had become more competitive, and the CTW's research showed the traditional magazine format was <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>way</b> to attract young children's attention. The growth of home videos during the '80s and the increase of thirty-minute children's shows on cable had demonstrated that children's attention could be sustained for longer periods of time, but the CTW's researchers found that their viewers, especially the younger ones, lost attention in Sesame Street after 40 to 45 minutes.|$|E

Finland's official stance is that the borders may be changed through peaceful negotiations, although there is currently no need to hold open talks, as Russia has shown no intention of returning the ceded areas, or discussing the question. In 1994 Boris Yeltsin commented that [...] "seizure of Finnish Karelia" [...] {{was an example of}} Stalin's totalitarian and aggressive politics. Later in 1997 he stated that the matter was closed. In 2000 President Putin stated that such discussions may endanger Finnish–Russian relations, and in 2001 he said that [...] "changing borders is <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>way</b> to resolve problems", but that possible solutions would be [...] "integration and cooperation".|$|E

40|$|Our {{common sense}} seems to regard hedonism as an unworthy theory of value. Two main arguments, resting on our intuitions, are {{commonly}} presented against it. The first ridicules hedonism as “a theory fit for pigs”, {{that is for}} people who care only about simple physical pleasures. The second seeks to refute hedonism {{on the assumption that}} no one would like to live a life that is nothing else but a hedonic reflection of her or his mind. Robert Nozick used this intuition to build his famous “experience machine example”. The {{purpose of this article is}} to suggest that the intuitions underlying these arguments, are based on nonrational presuppositions and therefore are <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>ways</b> to confront hedonism.

In this book he describes radical nanotechnology (as advocated by Drexler) as a deterministic/mechanistic idea of nano engineered [...] machines that {{does not take into}} account the nanoscale challenges such as wetness, stickness, Brownian motion, and high viscosity. He also explains what is soft nanotechnology or more appropriatelly biomimetic nanotechnology which is the way forward, if <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>way,</b> to design functional nanodevices that can cope with all the problems at a nanoscale. One can think of soft nanotechnology as the development of nanomachines that uses the lessons learned from biology on how things work, chemistry to precisely engineer such devices and stochastic physics to model the system and its natural processes in detail.|$|E
2500|$|Since the {{beginning}} of the Global War on Terrorism in late 2001 and the subsequent U.S. invasion of Afghanistan to oust the Taliban and al-Qaeda movement, the U.S. has launched several air strikes across into northwest Pakistan to target militants connected with the Afghanistan war who it alleges have fled the country and sought temporary shelter in Pakistan's bordering tribal areas. These strikes have been protested against by Pakistan, as a violation of national sovereignty, and have resulted in tense diplomatic relations between the two countries. They have also caused an uproar among Pakistan's civilian population and politicians and have fueled anti-American sentiments. Since June 2004, [...] the United States military has launched dozens of unmanned aerial vehicle strikes against presumed Taliban targets, killing hundreds of militants and civilians, increasing in intensity post-2009. These drone strikes have been subject to heavy criticism from Pakistan, which maintains that they are <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>way</b> to fight terror and that they will have the inevitable result of uniting the tribesmen along the border with Taliban and against the U.S.|$|E
2500|$|Though Schleicher {{approved}} of Papen's politics, a certain tension had emerged partly because Papen had proved himself far more aggressive and assertive than Schleicher had expected as the goofy Fränzchen {{had become a}} man who saw himself as one of history's Great Men and partly because Schleicher dis{{approved of}} Papen's style of provoking ordinary people with the general telling the chancellor that insulting people was <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>way</b> to make them like you. Schleicher wanted the [...] "New State" [...] to enjoy popular legitimacy, and was increasing convinced that Papen's massive unpopularity would denude the [...] "New State" [...] of any legitimacy. On 27 October 1932, the Supreme Court of Germany in a convoluted ruling declared that Papen's coup deposing the Prussian government was illegal as Papen's lawyers had failed to prove his claim that the coup was necessary because the Social Democrats and Communists were allegedly about to merger, but also allowed for Papen to retain his control of Prussia, giving no means for Braun to resume office as {{the court ruled that}} the Reich government could depose a Land government if law and order were threatened. In November 1932, Papen showed his contempt for the terms of the Treaty of Versailles by passing an umbau (rebuilding) programme for the German Navy of one aircraft carrier, six cruisers, six destroyer flotillas, sixteen U-boats and six battleships, intended to allow Germany to control both the North Sea and the Baltic. Versailles had forbidden Germany to have battleships, aircraft carriers and submarines.|$|E

In the second place, I was not sure that I had been carrying out my contract with Mr. Colbert in exactly the right spirit; for although he had said nothing about my duties, I knew that he expected me {{to take care of his}} son, and paid me for that. And I felt pretty sure that helping a fellow climb up a knotted rope into an old fort by night was <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>way</b> of taking care of him. The third thing that troubled me in regard to this matter was the feeling I had that Rectus had led me into it; that he had been the leader and not I. Now, I did not intend that anything of that kind should happen again. I did not come out on this expedition to follow Rectus around; indeed, it was to be quite the other way. But, to tell the truth, I had not imagined that he would ever try to make people follow him. He never showed at school that such a thing was in him. So, for these three reasons, I determined that there were to be no more scrapes of that sort, which generally came to nothing, after all.|$|E
