25|$|Past floods have {{resulted}} in both deepening and reduction in river depth, creation of <b>new</b> <b>sand</b> banks and shoals as well as increased transport of suspended sediment from upstream. Before the invention of modern dredging techniques the sediment deposited by flooding created hazards to ships navigating the river. Even medium-sized vessels no longer travel up the Brisbane River beyond the city reach, and dredging of the upper reaches has ceased, allowing the river to recover substantially from the fine silt dislodged by gravel and sand extraction.|$|E
25|$|Beach {{nourishment}} {{has significant}} impacts on local ecosystems. Nourishment may cause direct mortality to sessile organisms {{in the target}} area by burying them under the <b>new</b> <b>sand.</b> Seafloor habitat in both source and target areas are disrupted, e.g., when sand is deposited on coral reefs or when deposited sand hardens. Imported sand may differ in character (chemical makeup, grain size, non-native species) {{from that of the}} target environment. Light availability may be reduced, affecting nearby reefs and submerged aquatic vegetation. Imported sand may contain material toxic to local species. Removing material from near-shore environments may destabilize the shoreline, in part by steepening its submerged slope. Related attempts to reduce future erosion may provide {{a false sense of security}} that increases development pressure.|$|E

After the breakwaters were constructed in 1992, less sand was added to replenish the beaches.

500|$|The French term presqu'île, {{the origin}} of the park's name, means [...] "peninsula", or, literally, [...] "almost an island". Despite the name, Presque Isle has been an island for brief periods of time after it has been cut off from the {{mainland}} several times since 1819the longest stretch was from 1832 to 1864. In the 1950s to combat erosion, the state and federal governments built sets of concrete seawalls and perpendicular groins. In 1992, a series of 58breakwaters were also constructed to have capture sand and significantly slowed its movement eastward. Even with the substantial engineering projects, sand has to be relocated from tombolos that form behind the breakwaters, and <b>new</b> <b>sand</b> has to be brought in annually to replenish the beaches.|$|E
2500|$|The quick {{drainage}} of {{the reservoir}} flushed {{a large amount}} of sediment quickly, helping to create a new river channel above the dam. The remaining sediment will continue to erode until vegetation takes root.

2500|$|On January 18, 2012, SPRB Arquitectos, a Jalisco-based {{architecture}} {{group led}} by Laura Sánchez Penichet and Carlos Rodríguez Bernal, won a contest sponsored by the International Hotel Awards and Bloomberg Television in London. They won the award for helping redesign Hotelito Desconocido's interior design and external architecture; the award granted Hotelito Desconocido a five-star status, and was voted by the contest organizers as the best hotel in terms of architecture in Mexico and Latin America for the 2011–2012 edition. Among the contest judges were employees from Google, Royal Bank of Scotland, Bloomberg Television, among others. The two Mexican architects explained that their work at Hotelito Desconocido started in 2009 after the owners recognized that the hotel needed a major reconstruction. Since the hotel was initially built using the [...] model, which uses guayabillo trunks tied together and compressed with mud, the owners decided to demolish the original construction and build the hotel on palafittes. In the original model, the architects explained that Hotelito Desconocido's rooms were exactly the same (in terms of size and interior design) {{and did not have}} specific themes like the new models did. For the landscape design, they kept the agave and fruit gardens; they decided to change the look of the entrance and beach by adding 200 palm trees. They also added additional gardens and <b>new</b> <b>sand.</b>|$|E

Sanding in rail transport is application of most commonly silica sand into wheel-rail contact.

Sanding devices were developed in cooperation with corporation, which deals with production of rail transport equipment, among other things. The most important part of sanding device is sand dispenser. Dispensers were experimentally developed at the test station in the cooperating corporation. Dispensers were tested for utilization conditions on the locomotive of the train and conditions for trams and light rail vehicles. Furthermore, sand boxes have been designed for specific type of rail vehicle and <b>new</b> type of <b>sand</b> discharge tube, which directs sand directly into wheel-rail contact was designed too...|$|R
