5|$|Male {{and female}} guinea pigs do <b>not</b> <b>differ</b> in {{external}} appearance apart from general size. The {{position of the}} anus {{is very close to}} the genitals in both sexes. Female genitals are distinguished by a Y-shaped configuration formed from a vulvar flap, while the male genitals may look similar, with the penis and anus forming a like shape, the penis will protrude if pressure is applied to the surrounding hair. The male's testes may also be visible externally from scrotal swelling.|$|E
5|$|Most {{aspects of}} the {{gameplay}} did <b>not</b> <b>differ</b> from the previous two titles. Wipeout {{is based on a}} futuristic anti-gravity setting where pilots would race against each other or computer-controlled AI opponents to finish in the highest position possible. Wipeout gameplay takes inspiration from Formula One parallels; rather than using aerodynamics to increase wheel grip by down-force for faster turning speeds, Wipeout uses a fictionalised method of air braking for ever greater turning force.|$|E

5|$|The flag does <b>not</b> <b>differ</b> {{significantly}} from {{the flag of the}} Byelorussian SSR, other than the removal of the hammer and sickle and the red star, and the reversal of red and white in the hoist pattern. While there is no official interpretation for the colors of the flag, an explanation given by President Alexander Lukashenko is that red represents freedom and the sacrifice of the nation's forefathers, while green represents life.|$|E

On its release, the record received mixed reviews from music critics; several critics praised {{the production of the}} disc as well as Miguel's vocals and the compositions, while others felt it did <b>not</b> <b>differ</b> from his earlier recordings and found the music outdated. Miguel received several accolades, including a Grammy nomination for Best Latin Pop Performance and the Latin Grammy Awards for Album of the Year and Best Pop Vocal Album.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{scarcity}} of water, the Namib Desert Horse sometimes goes without water {{for as long}} as thirty hours in summer and has been known to go close to 72 hours without water during the winter, significantly longer than most horses, even other feral herds. A 1991 study suggested that in 75 years of genetic isolation and water scarcity the population had developed physiological mechanisms which improved their ability to conserve water. In 1993, a second study showed that the physiological water-conservation ability did <b>not</b> <b>differ</b> between Namib Desert Horses and other populations when dehydrated for periods of up to 60 hours, but suggested that the Namib Desert Horse would show improved conservation ability when dehydration periods were extended to upwards of 72 hours, a common occurrence in their feral state.|$|E

The Soviet finance ministry was a heavily centralised structure, while its predecessor was not. During its humble beginnings, the main task of the People's Commissariat of Finance were: confiscation of property, robbery and requisition; printing and creating money; and taxation.|$|E

By 19871988, Centrumtaal {{was more or less}} succeeded by CD-info, and Middenkoers by CD-actueel.

In a Spanish study, boxes {{made from a}} mixture of wood and concrete (woodcrete) had a much higher occupancy rate than wooden boxes (76.5% versus 33.5%), and birds nesting in woodcrete sites had earlier clutches, a shorter incubation period and more breeding attempts per season. Clutch size and chick condition did <b>not</b> <b>differ</b> between nest box types, but reproductive success was higher in woodcrete, perhaps because the synthetic nests were 1.5°C warmer than their wooden counterparts.|$|E
5|$|The Colombian {{tariff system}} {{is defined in}} the Ley de Servicios Públicos or Public Services Law from 1994. It is applied in public, mixed and private companies.

The basic tariff is calculated on the basis of economic costs according to a methodology defined at the national level by CRA (Law 287 of 2004). Therefore, in principle, tariffs in different municipalities do <b>not</b> <b>differ</b> due to local government’s decisions to raise tariffs or not, but only because of the different costs of the services.|$|E
