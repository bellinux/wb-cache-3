Also, several Change to Win unions also concluded that they were <b>not</b> <b>getting</b> <b>any</b> significant advantage from being in a separate labor federation, and that a fragmented labor union was doing more harm than good.

The five CtW unions present included the Laborers, SEIU, the Teamsters, UFCW, and UNITE HERE.

Oliver appeared to ruin his chances with Daisha when he encouraged a patient to complain about her diagnosis – though Anderson noted, [...] "he does apologise to Daisha, and sweetly gives her a cupcake". This left Chrissie free to pursue Oliver. Before their relationship began, Anderson opined [...] "She's gorgeous, and Oliver would be a fool not to go out with her."

500|$|However, {{the extent}} that Ignition were {{willing to go to}} control access to the album {{generated}} more hype than could normally have been expected, and served to alienate members of both the print and broadcast media, as well as most Creation staff members. When [...] "D'You Know What I Mean?" [...] was planned as the first single, Ignition decided on a late release to radio so as to avoid too much advance exposure. However, three stations broke the embargo, and Ignition panicked. According to Greengrass: [...] "we'd been in these bloody bunker meetings for six months or something, and our plot was blown. 'Shit, it's a nightmare'." [...] BBC Radio 1 received a CD containing three songs ten days before the album's release, on condition that disc jockey Steve Lamacq talked over the tracks to prevent illegal copies being made by listeners. The day after Lamacq previewed the album on his show, he {{received a phone call from}} Ignition informing him that he would not be able to preview further tracks because he didn't speak enough over the songs.

[...] According to Creation's head of marketing John Andrews, [...] " [...] made people despise Oasis within Creation.

2500|$|According to {{the bonus}} DVD of Still <b>Not</b> <b>Getting</b> <b>Any...,</b> while making the CD {{the members of}} Simple Plan thought of many names {{including}} Get Rich or Die Trying, Enema of the State, and In The Zone. The group decided on the name Still <b>Not</b> <b>Getting</b> <b>Any...</b> {{for a list of}} explained reasons. The most popular and most likely reason is that the members of Simple Plan thought that they were <b>not</b> <b>getting</b> <b>any</b> good reviews, Bouvier once noting that the band only had one recent good review in Alternative Press. Still <b>Not</b> <b>Getting</b> <b>Any...</b> was a musical departure from the group's previous album. The band still kept its style of downbeat lyrics matched to upbeat music, but managed to transcend from the standard pop punk genre. Although many of the tracks on this CD still carry the feeling of teen angst that is probably most noticeable in the song [...] "I'm Just a Kid" [...] from No Pads, No Helmets...Just Balls, the general slant of this album tends toward slightly deeper and more mature lyrical themes, as well as a more mainstream sound that edges away from the pure pop punk style of the group's last album. Some critics have pointed towards the inclusion of [...] "classic" [...] or [...] "mainstream" [...] rock elements, claiming the album [...] "de-emphasizes punk-pop hyperactivity in favor of straightforward, well-crafted modern rock".|$|E
