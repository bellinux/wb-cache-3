The implementation of such achange is likely to enable radical new applications that cannot be foreseen today. Large-scale deployment, however, involves signi cant challenges in interoperability, security, and scalability. In this paper we de ne an active networking architecture in which users control the invocation of pre-de ned, network-based functions through control information in packet headers. After de <b>ning</b> <b>our</b> active networking architecture, we consider a problem (namely, network congestion) that may bene t in the near-term from active networking, and thus may help justify migration to this new paradigm. Given an architecture allowing applications to exercise some control over network processing, the bandwidth allocated to each application's packets can be reduced {{in a manner that is}} tailored to the application, rather than being applied generically. Our results show that the ability to gracefully adapt to congestion makes a good case for active networking...|$|E

Unfortunately in the general case this hope is too vague and there is no direct way to extract such information from the algebraic description of X: Even the problem to decide whether X is empty or not is far from an easy visualization and requires some complicated algebraic machinery. A fi rst step observation is that as long as we are interested only in the topology of X, we can replace, using some Veronese embedding, the original ambient space with a much bigger RPn and assume that X is cut by quadratic equations.

40|$|Establishment of {{pairwise}} keys between sensor nodes in {{a sensor}} network {{is a difficult}} problem due to resource limitations of sensor nodes as well as vulnerability to physical captures of sensor nodes by the enemy. Public-key cryptosystems are not much suited for most resource-constrained sensor networks. Recently, elliptic curve cryptographic techniques show that public key cryptosystem is also feasible for resource-constrained sensor networks. However, most researchers accept that the symmetric key cryptosystems are viable options for resource-constrained sensor networks. In this paper, we first develop a basic principle to address the key pre-distribution problem in mobile sensor networks. Then, using this developed basic principle, we propose a scheme which takes {{the advantage of the}} post-deployment knowledge.

From our establishment in 1984, we have performed basic and applied research to support Digital's business objectives. Our current work includes exploring distributed personal computing on multiple platforms, networking, programming technology, system modelling and management techniques, and selected applications. Our strategy is to test the technical and practical value of our ideas by building hardware and software prototypes and using them as daily tools. Interesting systems are too complex to be evaluated solely in the abstract; extended use allows us to investigate their properties in depth. This experience is useful in the short term in re <b>ning</b> <b>our</b> designs, and invaluable in the long term in advancing our knowledge. Most of the major advances in information systems have come through this strategy, including personal computing, distributed systems, and the Internet. We also perform complementary work of a more mathematical avor. Some of it is in established elds of theoretical computer science, such as the analysis of algorithms, computational geometry, and logics of programming. Other work explores new ground motivated by problems that arise in our systems research. We have a strong commitment to communicating our results; exposing and testing our ideas in the research and development communities leads to improved understanding. Our research report series supplements publication in professional journals and conferences. We seek users for our prototype systems among those with whom we have common interests, and we encourage collaboration with university researchers. Robert W.

40|$|How can we, our {{partners}} and {{society as a}} whole spark a transformative dynamic that reaches hundreds of millions of poor? In these times of constant change, how can we change and re-orient ourselves to continue to ask the right questions and fi nd appropriate long-lasting solutions? These are the questions we, as ICRISAT, recently posed when defi <b>ning</b> <b>our</b> strategic plan for 2011 – 2020. Our process to answer this question resulted in Inclusive Market-Oriented Development (IMOD) – a unifying conceptual framework that has at its heart the ability to create opportunities for farmers to reinvest in agriculture by harnessing the power of markets. This year’s Eastern and Southern Africa Annual Report goes beyond accounting for our work at the project level. Instead, we show how various themes and work areas across disciplinary and project boundaries merge into a higher level narrative illustrating the processes that drive the creation of sustainable change. We present three examples that have already been started with markets as their core inspiration. Work done in Ethiopia on chickpea describes highly complex value chains with numerous players and steps between the farmer and the fi nal consumer in countries far from Africa. The core lesson here lies in understanding international market needs, facilitating local markets, and providing farmers with the right germplasm to access these markets. The story on groundnuts in Malawi describes how challenges in market access can be solved through local level collective action and also exemplifi es ICRISAT’s role and responsibility to fi nd solutions to associated problems such as afl atoxin. Finally, the story on the systems approach followed in Zimbabwe illustrates how livestock markets stimulate technology adoption and reinvestment in both crop and livestock production, resulting in more resilient mixed systems. This report illustrates IMOD in action. IMOD helps to create market-based incentives for improving technology adoption and facilitating eff ective value chain development; it also defi nes the role of upstream research and provides a framework that dire cts our research {{to address the needs of}} the poor. The systems perspective through the lens of IMOD is ICRISAT’s most promising answer to igniting a spark of transformation that will reach many thousands in the semi-arid tropics...|$|E

40|$|Principal {{components}} analysis (PCA) is {{a classical}} method for {{the reduction of}} dimensionality of data {{in the form of}} n observations (or cases) of a vector with p variables. Contemporary data sets often have p comparable to, or even much larger than <b>n.</b> <b>Our</b> main assertions, in such settings, are (a) that some initial reduction in dimensionality is desirable before applying any PCA-type search for principal modes, and (b) the initial reduction in dimensionality is best achieved by working in a basis in which the signals have a sparse representation. We describe a simple asymptotic model in which the estimate of the leading principal component vector via standard PCA is consistent if and only if p(n) /n → 0. We provide a simple algorithm for selecting a subset of coordinates with largest sample variances, and show that if PCA is done on the selected subset, then consistency is recovered, even if p(n) ≫ <b>n.</b> <b>Our</b> main setting is that of signals and images, in which the number of sampling points, or pixels, is often comparable with or larger than the number of cases, <b>n.</b> <b>Our</b> particular example here is the electrocardiogram (ECG) signal of the beating heart, but similar approaches have been used, say, for PCA on libraries of face images...|$|R
