40|$|Present {{study was}} aimed to {{evaluate}} the liquid inoculation of ten Bradyrhizobium japonicum with fungi Aspergillus <b>niger</b> (<b>plant</b> growth promoting) in pot experiments for determination of nitrogen fixation potential. Commonly grown JS- 335 cultivar of Soybean around Ujjain region was used as host plant. Nodule number, shoot length, root length and their dry weight were taken as criteria for nitrogen fixation. Inoculation in pot along with fertilizer significantly increase the nodulation, shoot and root length at 5 % of probability over inoculation of only B. japonicum and uninoculated. Total 12 treatments (10 tests + 2 controls) with three replicates were set and total 36 pots were arranged. Results revealed that B. japonicum increases the nitrogen fixation in combination with A. niger and induces the plant growth directly like phosphate solubilization, through IAA production, ammonia production and indirectly by inhibiting the pathogenic fungi. Co-inoculation was found suitable and effective over single inoculums. The present study supports that liquid inoculum {{of more than one}} organism results in increase in nodulation, and can effectively increase the crop productivity...|$|E

Treatments included three levels of humic acid (1, 3, and 6 liters of humic acid per hectare), iron (4 parts per million, ppm), zinc (4 parts per million, ppm) and control (without humic acid iron, and zinc). In this experiment, traits {{of the number of}} heads per plant, seeds number per head, 1000 seeds' weight, grain yield, and also oil and protein content were evaluated. The findings showed that foliar application of humic acid, zinc and iron resulted in a significant increase in all analyzed traits. The most significant plant response was obtained with the use of 6 liters humic acid per hectare, and the second most significant plant response was seen with the sprayed zinc treatment which was probably due to limited absorption and deficiency of these elements in the tested soil...|$|E

This study intended {{to indicate the}} impacts of nano-sized titanium dioxide particles (NT) and bulk (BT) on antioxidant enzymes activities including superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POX) and catalase (CAT), and variations of two major tropane alkaloids such as hyoscyamine (HYO) and scopolamine (SCO) in Hyoscyamus <b>niger</b> L. <b>Plants</b> were treated with different concentrations of NT and BT (0, 20, 40 and 80 mg l - 1). Alkaloids extracted were identified by gas chromatography (GC) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. Results showed that SOD activity increased with increasing titanium dioxide concentration in both nano-particles and bulk treated plants. However, the highest and the lowest POX activity were observed in plants exposed to NT at 40 mg l - 1 and control, respectively. Generally, all tested enzymes activities were higher in NT treated plants that those of BT except CAT activity at 80 mg l - 1. The highest alkaloids content values, HYO: 0. 286 g kg - 1 and SCO: 0. 126 g kg - 1, were achieved in plants treated with NT at 80 and 20 mg l - 1, respectively. The maximum and minimum plant biomass and subsequently total alkaloids yield were obtained in plants exposed to NT at 40 mg l - 1 and controls, respectively.

50|$|Vegetation {{patterns}} such as {{tiger bush}} and fir waves form for different reasons. Tiger bush consists of stripes of bushes on arid slopes {{in countries such}} as <b>Niger</b> where <b>plant</b> growth is limited by rainfall. Each roughly horizontal stripe of vegetation absorbs rainwater from the bare zone immediately above it. In contrast, fir waves occur in forests on mountain slopes after wind disturbance, during regeneration. When trees fall, the trees that they had sheltered become exposed and are in turn more likely to be damaged, so gaps tend to expand downwind. Meanwhile, on the windward side, young trees grow, protected by the wind shadow of the remaining tall trees.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis {{study is}} focused on the use of coal bottom ash from Tefereyre (<b>Niger)</b> power <b>plant</b> coal-fuelled, as a fine {{aggregate}} in cementitious mortar. Various volume fractions of natural sand (0 %, 10 %, 20 %, 30 %, 40 %, 50 %, 75 %, and 100 %) were replaced by the same volume of fine aggregates of coal bottom ash. In order to determine the effect of coal bottom ash incorporation on the composites obtained, fresh and dry density water absorption, porosity, thermal conductivity, ultrasonic pulse velocity, gas permeability and microstructure analyses were investigated. The results show that incorporating coal bottom ash in mortar causes an increase in the apparent porosity and that leads to an increase of the water absorption and the apparent permeability of the samples at 28  days curing age. The densification of bottom ash mortar during the curing age contributed to significantly reduce the increase in the porosity and the apparent permeability. This densification was confirmed by SEM analysis and ultrasonic velocity measurement. However, the use of coal bottom ash reduces the specific weight and the thermal conductivity of cementitious materials. Overall, the mortars containing coal bottom ash offer an opportunity to recycle (by-product) wastes. © 2016 Elsevier Lt...|$|R

XlnR homologs are commonly found in filamentous ascomycetes and often assumed to have the same function in different fungi. However, a comparison of the saprobe Aspergillus <b>niger</b> and the <b>plant</b> pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae showed different phenotypes for deletion strains of XlnR. In this study wild type and xlnR/xlr 1 /xyr 1 mutants of five fungi were compared: Fusarium graminearum, M. oryzae, Trichoderma reesei, A. niger and Aspergillus nidulans. Growth profiling on relevant substrates and a detailed analysis of the secretome as well as extracellular enzyme activities demonstrated a common role of this regulator in activating genes encoding the main xylanolytic enzymes. However, large differences were found in the set of genes that is controlled by XlnR in the different species, resulting in the production of different extracellular enzyme spectra by these fungi. This comparison emphasizes the functional diversity of a fine-tuned (hemi-) cellulolytic regulatory system in filamentous fungi, which might be related to the adaptation of fungi to their specific biotopes.

40|$|AbstractPyromorphite (Pb 5 (PO 4) 3 Cl), {{the most}} stable lead mineral under {{a wide range of}} geochemical {{conditions}} [1], can form in urban and industrially contaminated soils [2 – 5]. It has been suggested that the low solubility of this mineral could reduce the bioavailability of lead, and several studies have advocated pyromorphite formation as a remediation technique for lead-contaminated land [3, 5, 6], if necessary using addition of phosphate [6]. Many microorganisms can, however, make insoluble soil phosphate bioavailable [7 – 10], and the solubilisation of insoluble metal phosphates by free-living and symbiotic fungi has been reported [11 – 15]. If pyromorphite can be solubilised by microbial phosphate-solubilising mechanisms, the question arises of {{what would happen to the}} released lead. We have now clearly demonstrated that pyromorphite can be solubilised by organic-acid-producing fungi, for example Aspergillus <b>niger,</b> and that <b>plants</b> grown with pyromorphite as sole phosphorus source take up both phosphorus and lead. We have also discovered the production of lead oxalate dihydrate by A. niger during pyromorphite transformation, which is the first recorded biogenic formation of this mineral. These mechanisms of lead solubilisation, or its immobilisation as a novel lead oxalate, have significant implications for metal mobility and transfer to other environmental compartments and organisms. The importance of considering microbial processes when developing remediation techniques for toxic metals in soils is therefore emphasised...|$|R

40|$|Plant biomass {{contains}} complex polysaccharides {{that can}} be divided into structural and storage polysaccharides. Plant biomass is a major carbon source utilized by chemoheterotrophic microorganisms, such as filamentous fungi to grow and produce energy. Plant biomass-degrading fungi secrete a wide range of extracellular enzymes to convert complex plant biomass into metabolizable compounds. As a result, they are able to colonize and degrade a wide range of organic materials. The industrially and biotechnologically important fungal genera Penicillium and Aspergillus are among the best-studied decomposers of plant biomass polysaccharides. The focus of this study was on two ascomycete fungi, Penicillium subrubescens (FBCC 1632) and Aspergillus niger N 402 (ATCC 64947), and their potential for producing extracellular enzymes for the decomposition of plant biomass polysaccharides. Here, a new species, native Finnish isolate, P. subrubescens sp. nov. was described. It belongs to the section Lanata-Divaricata subgenus Aspergilloides. P. subrubescens was selected amongst 200 fungal strains screened for their ability to produce polyfructan inulin-degrading enzymes. Inulin is a storage polysaccharide located in the roots and tubers of flowering plants. P. subrubescens was identified based on the combined analysis of phenotype together with molecular phylogenetic analysis and extrolite data. P. subrubescens produced inulinase more efficiently than it did invertase. Only fructose, not fructo-oligosaccharides was detected as the endproduct of inulin hydrolysis indicating exo-type inulinase activity. The ability of P. subrubescens and A. <b>niger</b> to produce <b>plant</b> structural polysaccharide-degrading enzymes was studied by growth profiling and in plant biomass-containing liquid cultures. These data indicated similar (hemi-) cellulolytic capacities for these fungi. The extracellular enzyme mixtures of P. subrubescens and A. niger were used in the hydrolysis of wheat bran, sugar beet pulp and a mixture of these. Its favourable ability to hydrolyse complex plant-derived biomasses indicated that P. subrubescens has the potential to produce biotechnologically important enzyme mixtures. A new feruloyl esterase, FaeC of A. niger was cloned and heterologously produced from the plant biomass-acting enzymes. The biochemical properties of recombinant FaeC (rFaeC) were characterized, and the hydrolysis of wheat arabinoxylan and sugar beet pectin by rFaeC released both ferulic and p-coumaric acid. The synergistic activity of rFaeC and xylanase was detected in hydrolysis of plant biomass-derived substrates. The induction of faeA, faeB and faeC gene expression in the presence of various phenolic compounds and complex polysaccharides was examined. The differing expression levels of the three fae genes suggests that the corresponding enzymes can act cooperatively, leading to improvement in the efficiency of plant biomass decomposition.
