5000|$|There are {{a number}} of {{recommended}} steps to explain to people their diagnosis in a sensitive and open manner. A <b>negative</b> <b>diagnosis</b> experience may cause frustration and could cause a person to reject any further attempts at treatment. Ten points recommended to explain the diagnosis to the person and their caregivers are: ...|$|E
5000|$|In Lost, Hurley tells Jack Shephard {{that his}} bedside manner [...] "sucks". Later in the episode, Jack is told {{by his father}} to put more hope into his sayings, which he does when {{operating}} on his future wife. The comments continue in other episodes of the series with Benjamin Linus sarcastically telling Jack that his [...] "bedside manner leaves something to be desired" [...] after Jack gives him a harsh <b>negative</b> <b>diagnosis.</b>|$|E
50|$|In the {{beginning}} of 1943 {{he was diagnosed with}} a malignant lymphoma but accepted this <b>negative</b> <b>diagnosis</b> with courage and interpreted it as the will of God and so abandoned himself to this. He died several months later and was interred at the La Almudena cemetery; his remains were reinterred on 6 October 2009 to the church of Saint Albertus Magnus on 9 Benjamin Palencia Street in Madrid {{in the presence of the}} Cardinal Archbishop of Madrid Antonio María Rouco Varela.|$|E
30|$|To {{assess the}} {{strength}} of agreement between the radiographic and clinical definitions of OA, and between radiographic and self-reported definitions of OA, sensitivity, specificity and relative risk statistics were calculated. This approach regards a radiographic diagnosis of OA as the ‘gold standard’. Sensitivity is the proportion of those with radiographic diagnosis of OA who also have a positive OA diagnosis according to the alternative definition of interest (i.e. clinical or self-reported). Specificity is the proportion of those with a <b>negative</b> radiographic <b>diagnosis</b> of OA who also have a <b>negative</b> OA <b>diagnosis</b> according to the alternative definition of interest. Relative risk (RR) is {{the ratio of the}} risk of having an OA diagnosis according to the alternative definitions of interest in individuals with and without radiographic OA.|$|R

40|$|A 65 -year-old {{woman had}} an eschar after a holiday to Spain. A skin biopsy showed {{findings}} consistent with an ulcer but tested negative for fungi, atypical mycobacteria and Leishmania parasites.

5000|$|Kibel {{had been}} feeling ill {{for some time}} before his {{exhibition}} in 1937. He refused to see a doctor, fearing that a <b>negative</b> <b>diagnosis</b> would derail the exhibition. The exhibition contained 45 works, including a tempera portrait of his wife, bought by the South African National Gallery. Melvin Simmers commented on his coloured monotypes in the Cape Times of 24 June 1937: [...] Kibel has a very clear power of extracting essential rhythms and finding low, harmonious keys of colour with which to reinforce them.|$|E
50|$|Most {{cases of}} ALS, however, are {{correctly}} diagnosed, with the error rate of diagnosis in large ALS clinics {{is less than}} 10%. One study examined 190 people who met the MND/ALS diagnostic criteria, complemented with laboratory research in compliance with both research protocols and regular monitoring. Thirty of these people (16%) had their diagnosis completely changed during the clinical observation development period. In the same study, three people had a false <b>negative</b> <b>diagnosis</b> of MG, which can mimic ALS and other neurological disorders, leading to a delay in diagnosis and treatment. MG is eminently treatable; ALS is not.|$|E
5000|$|In 1909 Abderhalden {{found that}} on {{identification}} of a foreign protein in the blood, the body reacts with a [...] "defensive fermentation" [...] (in modern terms, a protease reaction) that causes disintegration of the protein. He developed the test in 1912. This test became a subject of contention soon after its development, and a significant body of work was published both in support of and refuting the test's reliability. One such publication concluded [...] "...the individual variations of both pregnant and non-pregnant sera make the results from both overlap so completely as to render the reaction, even with quantitative technique, absolutely indecisive for either positive or <b>negative</b> <b>diagnosis</b> of pregnancy." [...] (Van Slyke et al. 1915). The test's overall unreliability led to its being superseded in 1928 by the Aschheim-Zondek test. Due to Abderhalden's high reputation, it was not internationally acknowledged until long after his death that the underlying theory of [...] "defensive enzymes" [...] (Abwehrfermente) was entirely fraudulent (Deichmann & Müller-Hill 1998).|$|E

30|$|Among the 89 {{patients}} {{for whom the}} bedside ultrasound did not find a surgical pathology, there were four false <b>negative.</b> The <b>diagnosis</b> was corrected by surgeon on duty for {{two of them and}} by a CT scan for two others. For the other eighty-five patients (true negative), none had to later undergo an operation or be re-hospitalized.|$|R
5000|$|Enzyme based DNA {{computers}} are usually {{of the form}} of a simple Turing machine; there is analogous hardware, in {{the form of a}}n enzyme, and software, in the form of DNA. Benenson, Shapiro and colleagues have demonstrated a DNA computer using the FokI enzyme and expanded on their work by going on to show automata that diagnose and react to prostate cancer: under expression of the genes PPAP2B and GSTP1 and an over expression of PIM1 and HPN. Their automata evaluated the expression of each gene, one gene at a time, and on positive diagnosis then released a single strand DNA molecule (ssDNA) that is an antisense for MDM2. MDM2 is a repressor of protein 53, which itself is a tumor suppressor. On <b>negative</b> <b>diagnosis</b> it was decided to release a suppressor of the positive diagnosis drug instead of doing nothing. A limitation of this implementation is that two separate automata are required, one to administer each drug. The entire process of evaluation until drug release took around an hour to complete. This method also requires transition molecules as well as the FokI enzyme to be present. The requirement for the FokI enzyme limits application in vivo, at least for use in [...] "cells of higher organisms". It should also be pointed out that the 'software' molecules can be reused in this case.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. After {{a trip to}} Zambia, a {{previously}} healthy adult traveler presented with a prolonged illness characterized by low-grade fevers and fatigue. Although malaria smears and antibody tests results for Plasmodium species were <b>negative,</b> a <b>diagnosis</b> of malaria was ultimately determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and species-specific nucleic acid hybridization techniques.

40|$|A 62 -year-old woman {{complaining}} of severe malabsorption {{was diagnosed with}} celiac disease {{based on the findings}} of flat, small intestinal mucosa and HLA-DQ 2 positivity, although celiac serology was <b>negative.</b> This <b>diagnosis</b> was questioned {{due to the lack of}} clinical and histological improvement after a long period of strict gluten-free diet. The detection of enterocyte autoantibodies guided to the correct diagnosis of autoimmune enteropathy, leading to a complete recovery of the patient following an appropriate immunosuppressive treatment.
