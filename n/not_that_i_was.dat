6000|$|... "Thank you; {{but it is}} <b>not</b> <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> only thinking--Are you {{likely to}} see my cousin, Mr. Marmaduke Lind, whilst you are in London?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She knew <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> unhappy! She thought {{only to make}} me wretched, but I wept {{not until}} I was alone," [...] she sobbed, triumphantly.|$|E

60|$|I kept my temper. <b>Not</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{a patient}} woman: <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> possess a meek disposition. Very far from it, I regret to say. Nevertheless, I kept my temper--so far.|$|R
6000|$|This {{was strong}} language, and I hardly {{knew what to}} say in reply. <b>Not</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> frightened by his threat, but what made the man take such a strong {{personal}} interest in the matter? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "To fight me!" [...] Bertram exclaimed. [...] "Oh, surely <b>not</b> <b>that!</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> told {{by those}} who ought best to know, you English had got far beyond the stage of private war and murderous vendetta." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah! Yes. There was {{no harm in}} that, of course; {{only when}} any thing of that kind happens, people had better keep out of each other's way afterwards. <b>Not</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> ever jealous, you know." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am sure <b>that</b> you <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> sure <b>that</b> {{you love}} him better than all the world besides. I can feel what that is myself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{then he went}} {{afterwards}} to Gatherum Castle. <b>Not</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> vexed {{with him}} at all now, you understand. But {{it is such a}} dangerous house, you know." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do not know," [...] {{answered}} the Laird, doggedly, [...] "whether I should conclude or not, if it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> too far forwards to leap back." ...|$|R
6000|$|At this {{there came}} a sweet musical voice from the cottage:--"Ships, brother! Did I not tell you that I had a dream about two ships, and said I <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> sure {{something}} was going to happen?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Tarzan laughed. [...] "No," [...] he said. [...] "I {{know what}} you are trying to say. It is <b>not</b> <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> born in the jungle. I have lived all my life in the jungle, and I shall die in the jungle. I do not wish to live or die elsewhere." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{looked at}} her for a moment. [...] "Aren't you a little afraid, after all, of keeping such a sum as that in the house?" [...] It was <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> annoyed at her avidity but I was really struck with the {{disparity}} between such a treasure and such scanty means of guarding it.|$|E
50|$|<b>I</b> can assert <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{a certain}} way, e.g. believing {{it was raining}} when it wasn't, and that you, he, or they, are <b>that</b> way but <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>that</b> way.|$|R
6000|$|... "Home! Thank you, Rachel, pray do. <b>Not</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> hurt," [...] {{she added}} in her natural voice, [...] "only these rags would tell tales, {{and there would}} be an {{intolerable}} fuss." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'When the Emperor saw me he frowned, {{and said}} to me, [...] "What is thy name? Knowest thou <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> Emperor of this city?" [...] But I made him no answer.|$|R
6000|$|... 'And {{you knew}} <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> your sister?' said Lilias. 'No wonder you {{received}} me so coldly. What a strange, wild, forward young person {{you must have}} thought me--mixing myself in the fortunes of a stranger whom I had only once spoken to--corresponding with him by signs--Good Heaven! what can you have supposed me?' ...|$|E
60|$|It was a bribe of kings; {{it was an}} act, paltry and contemptible, {{that was}} demanded of me in return. Still I did not speak. It was <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> in {{confusion}} or in any doubt. I was merely sad--greatly and suddenly sad, in that I knew I held in my arms what I would never hold again.|$|E
60|$|<b>Not</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> vindictive. Not that I {{wanted to}} punish the man. No; I shrank terribly from the task. But to relieve myself from this {{persistent}} sense of surrounding mystery, and to free others from suspicion, I felt compelled to discover him. It seemed {{to me like a}} duty laid upon me from without. I dared not shirk it.|$|E
6000|$|... "It <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> ashamed--not as you think! But {{it seems}} such a terribly tragic thing to bring beings into the world--so presumptuous--that I {{question}} {{my right to}} do it sometimes!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, thank God; <b>not</b> <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> in no man's power. He cannot do me any {{material}} harm. Anything which may happen {{would have happened}} whether he had come or not. But <b>I</b> <b>am</b> unhappy." ...|$|R
60|$|But Tom did {{worse than}} laugh. <b>Noting</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> getting quite near the wood, he rode {{between me and}} it, trying to turn me into the open, for he wished to see me killed.|$|R
6000|$|... "I said <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a brigand," [...] {{returned}} the stranger, quietly; [...] "I said I was an outlaw. What else I am, and my motives of action, I {{choose not to}} tell. You say truly--I have you in my power. That {{is one reason why}} I would befriend you, if you will trust me." [...] The outlaw rose up as he spoke.|$|E
60|$|The {{only part}} I was a {{stranger}} to was the Gulf of Siam. And I mentioned this to Captain Giles. <b>Not</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> concerned very much. It belonged to the same region the nature of which I knew, into whose very soul I seemed to have looked during {{the last months of}} that existence with which I had broken now, suddenly, as one parts with some enchanting company.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} told," [...] said Mr. Crawley, [...] "that you shall take a cock which is {{lord of the}} farmyard,--the cock of all that walk,--and when you have daubed his {{feathers}} with mud, he shall be thrashed by every dunghill coward. I say <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> ever the cock of the walk, but I {{know that they have}} daubed my feathers." [...] Then he went down among the other poultry into the farmyard.|$|E

6000|$|... “I {{was having}} {{a bit of a}} laugh at the thought of the change that has come over my position. <b>Not</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{conceited}} about it, but it all seems so strange <b>that</b> <b>I</b> should <b>be</b> here and second in command.” ...|$|R
60|$|Yet he {{was sick}} with fatigue and over-exhaustion. His eyes were quite dark, sightless: {{he seemed to have}} lost the power of seeing, to be {{virtually}} blind. He hung his head forward when he had to write a post card, as if he felt his way. But he turned his post card so that I should not see to whom it was addressed; <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> interested; only I noticed his little, cautious, English movement of privacy.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{ran against}} him by accident," [...] Wulf said, looking up fearlessly in the prelate's face. [...] "I apologized, though I know <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> more in fault than he; {{but instead of}} taking my apology as one of gentle blood should do, he spoke like a churl, and {{threatened}} me with chastisement, and then I did say that I hoped he and all other Normans in the land would some day be packed across the Channel." ...|$|E
6000|$|It is true I {{had promised}} my showman to think over his {{invitation}} {{to me to}} [...] "sign on" [...] as a permanent member of his troupe of clowns, acrobats, wild beasts, and monstrosities.
