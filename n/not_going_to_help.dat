500|$|Crash: Mind over Mutant {{takes place}} {{a year later}} after the events of where Crash of the Titans left off. The Titans, free from the control of Doctor Neo Cortex, have spread {{throughout}} the Wumpa Islands and cultivated their own societies and towns. All seems well until a rejuvenated Doctor Neo Cortex teams up with his old partner Doctor Nitrus Brio to invent a personal digital assistant, the [...] "NV", that can control the minds of both mutants and bandicoots by transmitting bad Mojo, forcefully siphoned from Cortex's former boss Uka Uka. Crash and Aku Aku are not affected by the device, but their family members Coco and Crunch, are soon transformed into monstrous version of themselves who seek Crash's destruction. After Coco is freed from the NV's control, the Bandicoots learn of Doctor Cortex's plot by accessing his blog, and decide {{to go to the}} Evil Public School, where Nina was placed by Doctor Cortex. Nina in return for Crash saving her science fair project, informs the heroes of Cortex's and Brio's alliance and reveals their location in the Junkyard, where Brio is recycling parts to create a new space station, the [...] "Space Head", for Cortex and new NV devices. Crash and Aku Aku find Crunch and Brio at the Junkyard and manage to break Crunch free from the NV's control. After learning of Uka Uka's whereabouts from Brio, Crash and Aku Aku go to Mount Grimly, where Uka Uka is being drained of all his Mojo. After being freed, Uka Uka informs Crash that his voodoo bones, his source of power, have been stolen and given to six of the worst Titans on the Island, and tells them to go and retrieve the bones for him. When the bones have been gathered, Uka Uka uses his restored power to send Crash to the Space Head and Crash can enact Uka Uka's vengeance on Cortex. Crash engages in a fight against Cortex, who uses a mutation formula stolen from Brio to empower himself for the battle. Upon losing to the Bandicoot, Cortex throws a tantrum, causing the Space Head to fall towards the Earth. Cortex, having returned to normal, makes his escape from the plummeting Space Head, while Crash and Aku Aku brace themselves for a crash-landing on Wumpa Island. Crash and Aku Aku manage to survive the crash and reunite with Coco and Crunch as parts of the Space Head rain down from the sky. As the story ends, Coco tells Aku Aku that they're <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> clean up, much to his chagrin.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThere {{have been}} many studies {{in the field of}} {{information}} behavior. Recently Du and Spink (2011) presented a model, which simulates multitasking, cognitive coordination and cognitive shifts on web. However, this model does not incorporate personal variables and the impact of task or web design. This research addresses this gap. Information and psychological scientists have shown that information behavior (IR) is affected by: the affective domain, cognitive attributes, psychological factors, personality dimensions and sociological factors. This study investigates how IR is affected by working memory (wm), cognitive coordination, cognitive shifts and various artifacts and task variables influenced by the PAT model (Personal, Artifact and Task characteristics) of flow. The research is exploratory and takes a pragmatic, mixed method approach. Thirty University students will participate. The research tools include: pre and post questionnaires, working memory tests, Flow State Scale test, think aloud data, observations, audio-visual data, web search logs and use of the Critical Decision Method. The qualitative data will be coded and analyzed thematically and will be related to the quantitative data. This study is expected to identify the impact of all these variables on multitasking IR in the web and provide a new integrated framework, which is <b>not</b> only <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> information scientists <b>to</b> better understand this behavior but also web companies to develop more effective web products...|$|R

2500|$|After the {{disastrous}} First Test in Brisbane the tour selectors {{sent back to}} London for the 41-year-old Cowdrey as a replacement batsmen. Cowdrey was highly regarded by the MCC team and in particular by Mike Denness, who had succeeded him as captain of Kent. In his 20-year Test career he had faced the Australian fast bowlers Keith Miller, Ray Lindwall, Alan Davidson, Ian Meckiff, Gordon Rorke and even the young Dennis Lillee. Although the Australian press was aghast at such a recall – Cowdrey had not played a Test in four years – the tourists were keen to have a man with the technique and strength of purpose to play the fastest of bowlers. He arrived in Perth with the wives of the MCC team after a 19-hour delay in Bombay, too late to play a practice match, and was called up for the Second Test two days after he arrived and with three hours in the nets. This was his sixth tour of Australia matching {{the record of the}} Lancashire spinner Johnny Briggs. Cowdrey walked to the crease to an ovation from the 16,000 crowd at the WACA, but not from Jeff Thomson.

2500|$|On April 3, 2007, Agnihotri {{became the}} first MLA to be named - that is, asked by the Speaker to leave the {{assembly}} - in Ken Kowalski's nine years as speaker. This occurred as result of questions he asked Minister of Tourism, Parks, Recreation and Culture Hector Goudreau about the Community Initiatives Program, which dispenses grants to community groups. Agnihotri began by noting that, despite a rule that unmatched grants could not exceed ten thousand dollars, forty-three groups had received unmatched grants exceeding that amount. He then asked if these groups included any who had made donations to the leadership campaigns of Ed Stelmach, Dave Hancock, Lyle Oberg, or Ted Morton - {{all of whom were}} cabinet ministers and all of whom had refused to disclose full lists of donors from their leadership campaigns: [...] "Can this minister assure this house that groups receiving this special treatment are not secret friends of top Tories?" [...] Hancock rose on a point of order, and Kowalski ruled that Agnihotri's question impugned the integrity of the ministers, and that the question was a party matter that had no place in the legislature. He asked Agnihotri three times to apologize and, after Agnihotri refused, he named him. Agnihotri was not to be allowed back into the Legislature until he apologized and all members of the assembly agreed to re-admit him. He apologized the next day, saying that his constituents wanted him to and that [...] "if you stay outside, you're <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> Albertans, so better you go inside and fight for it." ...|$|E

Once it was secured, the Fifth Air Force could bring fighters and bombers over from Japan to operate more easily against North Korea. The attack on Kimpo airfield was carried out by 2nd Battalion 5th Marines. That night at Kimpo, the North Koreans under the command of Brigadier General Wan Yong (the commander of the North Korean air force) were organizing their defense of the airfield. His troops were a conglomeration of half-trained fighting men and service forces. Several North Korean troops had already fled across the Han River toward Seoul to escape the fight. The North Koreans' defense was almost as bad as the morale of the men who realized that they were <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> get any <b>help</b> from the North Korean officials in Seoul.|$|R

This is where the Abbot resides, the {{announcement}} of who will build the pagoda is given, and where the pagoda will be built. Most of the temple was renovated by Genta; who was expected to build the pagoda there as well. However, this task was left to Jūbei who poured his heart and soul into it. His pagoda was then tested against a storm of epic proportions which assaulted the temple grounds. During the storm, Genta stormed around scrutinizing everything, waiting for something to fail, while Jūbei waited {{at the top of the}} pagoda; hoping that it would survive. Genta’s HouseThe place where Genta and Okichi interact. It is a necessary setting to display the Katagi of the wife since, as the wife, she should not leave the house. This is also where Seikichi all but lives, and is where Okichi nudges Seikichi to avenge Genta; leading him to attack Jūbei. Jubei’s HouseAlso acts as a way to display the Katagi of the wife; it is the only time we see interactions with Onami. Here Jūbei’s obsession about the pagoda is revealed, where he spends countless, sleepless nights perfecting his model. His son then builds his own version of his father’s pagoda and predicts the attack on his father in a dream. An important fight between Jūbei and Genta takes place here, in which Jūbei refuses his master’s offer to share the pagoda project.
