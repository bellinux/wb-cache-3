Some students have criticized ASMSU for <b>not</b> <b>having</b> <b>enough</b> electoral participation to gain a student mandate.

5|$|By 1986, {{the company}} was once again in serious {{financial}} trouble. During 1985 they had taken the show outside Quebec to a lukewarm response. In Toronto they performed {{in front of a}} 25% capacity crowd after <b>not</b> <b>having</b> <b>enough</b> money to properly market the show. Gilles Ste-Croix, dressed in a monkey suit, walked through downtown Toronto as a desperate publicity stunt. A later stop in Niagara Falls turned out to be equally problematic.|$|E
5|$|A diver {{missing a}} {{required}} decompression stop {{increases the risk}} of developing decompression sickness. The risk is related to the depth and duration of the missed stops. The usual causes for missing stops are: <b>not</b> <b>having</b> <b>enough</b> breathing gas to complete the stops, or accidentally losing control of buoyancy. An aim of most basic diver training is to prevent these two faults. There are also less predictable causes of missing decompression stops. Diving suit failure in cold water may force the diver to choose between hypothermia and decompression sickness. Diver injury or marine animal attack may also limit the duration of stops the diver is willing to carry out.|$|E

5|$|Even before Bradford City were {{guaranteed}} {{a place in}} the Football League, the club made its first acquisitions by signing Jack Forrest and Ben Prosser from Stoke on 1 May. These were followed by four more players joining the club; Sam Bright, George Robinson, Peter O'Rourke and Jimmy Millar. Despite <b>not</b> <b>having</b> <b>enough</b> players to field a full side, four club representatives travelled to London by the end of May for a league management committee meeting, when the club was elected into the Second Division. Money was raised to fund the club, including at least £2,000 from sponsors, a balance of £500 from Manningham FC and proceeds from a summer archery tournament. Bradford City also took over Manningham's Valley Parade ground for their home fixtures.|$|E
5|$|Nadodi Mannan was {{released}} on 22 August 1958. The expenses made for the film resulted in Ramachandran <b>not</b> <b>having</b> <b>enough</b> money to buy release prints. Hence, Veerappan and Chakrapani decided to acquire a legal loan of 50,000 from AVM Productions. However, Ramachandran's signature was required for the loan contract. When they consulted with him on this issue, he asked Veerappan and Chakrapani to tell the studio's founder A. V. Meiyappan that they would repay the loan and keep the price paid by the production company, Cinemas Limited, for distribution rights for the film's release in Sri Lanka as collateral. Meiyappan agreed to provide the loan, which was repaid by Veerappan immediately after the film's release.|$|E
5|$|The inaugural champions were Sarita and Wilde, who {{defeated}} The Beautiful People (Rayne and Sky) in {{the finals}} of an eight-team tournament to crown the first TNA Knockouts Tag Team Champions.

Awesome Kong's and Hamada's only reign holds the record for the shortest reign in the title's history at 63 days. As of June 27, 2013, the championships are retired due to TNA <b>not</b> <b>having</b> <b>enough</b> female talent for a Tag Team Division. Young is the first and only male wrestler to have held the title. Overall, there have been nine reigns shared between 15 wrestlers and nine teams.|$|E

5|$|While {{majoring in}} drama at Northwestern University, Gittings {{developed}} a close but non-sexual friendship with another female student, prompting {{rumors that the}} two were lesbians, which led Gittings to examine her own sexual orientation. In her attempts to understand it, she had her suspicions confirmed by a psychiatrist who offered to cure her. <b>Not</b> <b>having</b> <b>enough</b> money to make regular visits, {{she was unable to}} get the money from her father, who reasoned there were no problems a psychiatrist could solve that a priest could not. A close friend suggested they see less of each other so as not to further encourage the rumors about them.|$|E
5|$|Cannon Fodder 2 is a military-themed action {{game with}} {{strategy}} and shoot 'em up elements. The player controls a small squad {{of up to}} four soldiers. These soldiers are armed with machine guns which kill enemy infantry with a single round. The player's troops are similarly fragile, and while they possess superior fire-power at the game's outset the enemy infantry becomes more powerful as the game progresses. As well as foot soldiers, the antagonists include vehicles and missile-armed turrets. The player must also destroy buildings which spawn enemy soldiers. For these targets, which are invulnerable to machine gun fire, the player must use secondary, explosive weaponry: grenades and rockets. Ammunition for these weapons is limited and the player must find supply crates to replenish his troops. Wasting these weapons can potentially result in the player <b>not</b> <b>having</b> <b>enough</b> to fulfil the mission objectives. The player can opt to shoot crates – destroying enemy troops and buildings in the ensuing explosion – at less risk to his soldiers than retrieving them, but again at {{a greater risk of}} depleting ammunition.|$|E

25|$|In 1788, Americans held {{inaccurate}} {{and often}} contradicting {{views of the}} Muslim world, and used that in political arguments. For example, the anti-Federalists compared a strong central government to the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire and the American army to Turkish Janissaries, arguing against a strong central government. On the other hand, Alexander Hamilton argued that despotism in the Middle East {{was the result of}} the Sultan <b>not</b> <b>having</b> <b>enough</b> power to protect his people from oppressive local governors; thus he argued for a stronger central government.|$|E
25|$|Prodi's {{appointment}} was somewhat delayed, as the outgoing President of the Republic, Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, ended his mandate in May, <b>not</b> <b>having</b> <b>enough</b> {{time for the}} usual procedure (consultations made by the President, appointment of a Prime Minister, the motion of confidence and oath of office). After the acrimonious election of Giorgio Napolitano to replace Ciampi, Prodi could proceed with his transition to government. On 16 May he was invited by Napolitano to form a government. The following day, 17 May 2006, Prodi and his second cabinet were sworn into office.|$|E

25|$|United Nations: Fundamentally, {{poverty is}} the {{inability}} of having choices and opportunities, a violation of human dignity. It means lack of basic capacity to participate effectively in society. It means <b>not</b> <b>having</b> <b>enough</b> to feed and clothe a family, not having a school or clinic to go to, not having the land on which to grow one's food or a job to earn one's living, not having access to credit. It means insecurity, powerlessness and exclusion of individuals, households and communities. It means susceptibility to violence, and it often implies living in marginal or fragile environments, without access to clean water or sanitation.|$|E
25|$|Despite this {{impressive}} form, Messina {{still were}} in danger of being relegated from Serie A {{at the end of the}} season due to a possibility of <b>not</b> <b>having</b> <b>enough</b> finances available to compete in the league. Eventually, though, they successfully managed to stay in the Serie A league. In the 2005–06 season Messina were however unable to repeat their previous impressive season, leading this to the sacking of Mutti, who was replaced by Giampiero Ventura; despite all, they looked to be mathematically relegated from the top division after Day 36 losing the derby against Reggina 3–0. However, due to the Serie A scandal of 2006, Messina avoided relegation to Serie B despite finishing 18th.|$|E
25|$|Once {{the hook}} has been removed, return the trout into the water. Support the trout until it stabilizes. This {{includes}} holding {{the fish in}} water deep enough to submerge its gills. After long fights, {{it may be necessary}} to manually move water past its gills. This can be done either by holding the trout in moving water with its head facing upstream, or, in calm water, moving the trout backwards and forwards repeatedly. Once stabilized, the trout will swim off on its own. If released prematurely, the trout, <b>not</b> <b>having</b> <b>enough</b> energy to move, will sink to the bottom of the river and suffocate.

25|$|A small Jewish {{community}} {{existed on}} the island of Penang. Jews first came into contact with the Malay peninsula during the 11th century when Jewish traders traded with the Kedah Sultanate and Langkasuka. Many Jews in Malaysia came from Persia. After the communist revolution in China, more Jews fled to Southeast Asia. However, the Jewish community declined, with many emigrating to countries such as Australia. Due to <b>not</b> <b>having</b> <b>enough</b> members to hold some Jewish rituals, the only synagogue in Penang, established in 1932, was shut down in 1976. The last burial in Penang's Jewish cemetery took pace in 1978. By the 1990s the community had disappeared, and it is now thought that there are only two Jews who hold Malaysian passports.|$|E
25|$|In April 1920, {{together}} with the Lithuanian Popular Socialist Democratic Party (LPSDP), she established publishing company AB Varpas (bell) that she headed until 1930.

In February 1922, she revived the publication of Lietuvos žinios and Lietuvos ūkininkas. The publications were outspoken about their ideals and did not shy from criticism of the government for which Bortkevičienė faced fines and arrests. In 1923 alone there were 17 lawsuits where Bortkevičienė was named as the responsible party. For publishing a caricature of Prime Minister Vytautas Petrulis and Minister of Defense Leonas Bistras in October 1925, she was fined 2,000 litas or imprisonment for 1.5 months. <b>Not</b> <b>having</b> <b>enough</b> funds, she was imprisoned until her friends raised enough money.|$|E
25|$|Spina bifida is {{believed}} to be due to a combination of genetic and environmental factors. After having one child with the condition or if one of the parents has the condition, there is a 4% chance that the next child will also be affected. <b>Not</b> <b>having</b> <b>enough</b> folate in the diet before and during pregnancy also plays a significant role. Other risk factors include certain antiseizure medications, obesity, and poorly controlled diabetes. Diagnosis may occur either before or after a child is born. Before birth if a blood test or amniocentesis finds a high level of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), there is a higher risk of spina bifida. Ultrasound examination may also detect the problem. Medical imaging can confirm the diagnosis after birth. It is a type of neural tube defect with other types including anencephaly and encephalocele.|$|E
