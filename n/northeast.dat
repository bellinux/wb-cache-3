5|$|From October to December each year, a {{very large}} area of south India, {{including}} Tamil Nadu, the coastal regions of Andhra Pradesh and the union territory of Puducherry, receives up to 60 percent of its annual rainfall from the <b>northeast</b> monsoon (or winter monsoon). The <b>northeast</b> monsoon {{is the result of}} the annual gradual retreat of monsoonal rains from northeastern India. Unlike during the regular monsoon, rainfall during the <b>northeast</b> monsoon is sporadic, but typically far exceeds the amount produced by the regular monsoon by up to 90 percent. This excessive rainfall can be exacerbated by an El Nino year, which 2015 was.|$|E
