500|$|By {{the end of}} 1898 Dresser {{reported}} that nearly one million copies of sheet music would soon be sold, making [...] "Wabash" [...] a [...] "sensation", the [...] "great hit of the day." [...] In a newspaper interview Dresser said, [...] "I can’t tell you just how much I have cleared off of the song, but the $50,000 estimate I have seen in some papers is very modest. You see I am a publisher {{as well as a}} composer and have a big printing house of my own in New York. I also write the words for all my songs, dictate the circumstances and stage settings for their public introductions, write my own ads, and sometimes sing my own songs. <b>Now</b> <b>what</b> <b>do</b> you think of that for a monopoly. Eh?" [...] Dresser earned a substantial income from the song, including royalties through the sale of sheet music.|$|E
500|$|The Simpsons uses a {{floating}} timeline {{in which the}} characters do not age or age very little, and as such, the show is always assumed to be set in the current year. In several episodes, events {{have been linked to}} specific times, though sometimes this timeline has been contradicted in subsequent episodes. Bart's year of birth was stated in [...] "I Married Marge" [...] (season three, 1991) as being in the early 1980s. In [...] "Simpsorama" [...] (season 26, 2014) Bart states his birthday as February 23. He lived with his parents in the Lower East Side of Springfield until the Simpsons bought their first house. When Lisa was born, Bart was at first jealous of the attention she received, but he soon warmed to her when he discovered that [...] "Bart" [...] was her first word. Bart's first day of school was in the early 1990s. His initial enthusiasm was crushed by an uncaring teacher and Marge became worried that something was truly wrong with Bart. One day during recess, Bart met Milhouse and started entertaining him and other students with various gestures and rude words. Principal Skinner told him [...] "you've just started school, and the path you choose now may be the one you follow {{for the rest of your}} life! <b>Now,</b> <b>what</b> <b>do</b> you say?" [...] In his moment of truth, Bart responded, [...] "eat my shorts". The episode [...] "That '90s Show" [...] (season nineteen, 2008) contradicted much of the backstory's time frame; for example, it was revealed that Homer and Marge were childless in the early 1990s.|$|E

All the people came to him and he sat down and began to teach them. 3 The scribes and the Pharisees brought a woman who had been caught in adultery; and making her stand before all of them, 4 they said to him, ‘Teacher, this woman was caught in the very act of {{committing}} adultery. 5 Now in the law Moses commanded us to stone such women. <b>Now</b> <b>what</b> <b>do</b> you say?’ 6 They said this to test him, so that they might have some charge to bring against him. Jesus bent down and wrote with his finger on the ground. 7 When they kept on questioning him, he straightened up and said to them, ‘Let anyone among you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her.’ 8 And once again he bent down and wrote on the ground. 9 When they heard it, they went away, one by one, beginning with the elders; and Jesus was left alone with the woman standing before him. 10 Jesus straightened up and said to her, ‘Woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?’ 11 She said, ‘No one, sir.’ And Jesus said, ‘Neither do I condemn you. Go your way, and from now on do not sin again.’ ...|$|E
