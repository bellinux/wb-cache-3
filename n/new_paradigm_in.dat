25|$|The Tübingen {{paradigm}} was formulated {{and thoroughly}} defended {{for the first}} time by Hans Joachim Krämer. He published the results of his research in a 1959 monograph that was a revised version of a 1957 dissertation written under the supervision of Wolfgang Schadewaldt. In 1963, Konrad Gaiser, who was also a student of Schadewaldt, qualified as a professor with his comprehensive monograph on the unwritten doctrines. In the following decades both these scholars expanded on and defended the <b>new</b> <b>paradigm</b> <b>in</b> a series of publications while teaching at Tübingen University.|$|E
25|$|Social network {{analysis}} {{is an example}} of a <b>new</b> <b>paradigm</b> <b>in</b> the positivist tradition. The influence of social {{network analysis}} is pervasive in many sociological sub fields such as economic sociology (see the work of J. Clyde Mitchell, Harrison White, or Mark Granovetter, for example), organizational behavior, historical sociology, political sociology, or the sociology of education. There is also a minor revival of a more independent, empirical sociology in the spirit of C. Wright Mills, and his studies of the Power Elite in the United States of America, according to Stanley Aronowitz.|$|E

40|$|Several decades ago, the {{scientific}} status {{of knowledge is}} based on logical positivism. In the next periods, logical positivism begin to be questioned by philosophers.

25|$|In the Six-Day War, Sharon, {{in command}} of an armored {{division}} on the Sinai front, drew up his own complex offensive strategy that combined infantry troops, tanks and paratroopers from planes and helicopters to destroy the Egyptian forces Sharon's 38th Division faced when it broke through to the Kusseima-Abu-Ageila fortified area. Sharon's victories and offensive strategy in the Battle of Abu-Ageila led to international commendation by military strategists; he was judged to have inaugurated a <b>new</b> <b>paradigm</b> <b>in</b> operational command. Researchers at the United States Army Training and Doctrine Command studied Sharon's operational planning, concluding that it involved a number of unique innovations. It was a simultaneous attack by a multiplicity of small forces, each with a specific aim, attacking a particular unit in a synergistic Egyptian defense network. As a result, instead of supporting and covering {{each other as they}} were designed to do, each Egyptian unit was left fighting for its own life.|$|E
500|$|Toward {{the end of}} the 20th century, {{some social}} and {{political}} analysts were arguing that the New Age political perspective had something to offer mainstream society. In 1987, some political scientists launched the [...] "Section on Ecological and Transformational Politics" [...] of the American Political Science Association, and an academic book prepared by three of them stated that the [...] "transformational politics" [...] concept was meant to subsume such terms as new age and <b>new</b> <b>paradigm.</b> <b>In</b> 2005, British researcher Stuart Rose urged scholars of alternative religions {{to pay more attention to}} the New Age's interest in such topics as [...] "new socio-political thinking" [...] and [...] "New Economics", topics Rose discussed in his book Transforming the World: Bringing the New Age Into Focus, issued by a European academic publisher.|$|E
2500|$|Minsky {{wrote the}} book Perceptrons (with Seymour Papert), which became the {{foundational}} work {{in the analysis of}} artificial neural networks. This book is the center of a controversy in the history of AI, as some claim it to have had great importance in discouraging research of neural networks in the 1970s, and contributing to the so-called [...] "AI winter". He also founded several other famous AI models. His book A framework for representing knowledge created a <b>new</b> <b>paradigm</b> <b>in</b> programming. While his Perceptrons is now more a historical than practical book, the theory of frames is in wide use. Minsky has also written on the possibility that extraterrestrial life may think like humans, permitting communication. He was an adviser on Stanley Kubrick's movie one of the movie's characters, Victor Kaminski, was named in Minsky's honor and Minsky himself is mentioned in the movie and in Arthur C. Clarke's derivative novel of the same name: ...|$|E

40|$|TXL is a {{special-purpose}} {{programming language}} designed for creating, manipulating and rapidly prototyping language descriptions, tools and applications. TXL {{is designed to}} allow explicit programmer control over the interpretation, application, order and backtracking of both parsing and rewriting rules. Using first order functional programming at the higher level and term rewriting at the lower level, TXL provides for flexible programming of traversals, guards, scope of application and parameterized context. This flexibility has allowed TXL users to express and experiment with both new ideas in parsing, such as robust, island and agile parsing, and <b>new</b> <b>paradigms</b> <b>in</b> rewriting, such as XML markup, rewriting strategies and contextualized rules, without any change to TXL itself. This paper outlines the history, evolution and concepts of TXL with emphasis on its distinctive style and philosophy, and gives examples of its use in expressing and applying recent <b>new</b> <b>paradigms</b> <b>in</b> language processing...|$|R
