40|$|In the {{regulation}} of food contact articles and flavouring substances, the TTC concept (Threshold of Toxicological Concern) has been developed {{as a substitute for}} substance-specific information. The TTC concept is based on the analysis of the toxicological and/or structural data of a broad range of different chemicals, with the aim to set an exposure-value below which no toxicity testing is necessary. Recently, application of the TTC concept has been proposed as a tool in risk assessment of industrial chemicals within REACH, both for defining when <b>no</b> <b>testing</b> <b>is</b> <b>needed</b> based on exposure information and as a substitute for effect values. The proposal concerns both {{human health and the environment}}. The present report does not advocate the use of TTC instead of substance specific toxicity data for risk assessment of industrial chemicals within REACH at time being. This conclusion is based on current knowledge and understanding of the concept, and on limitations and uncertainties in the derivation of TTCs. Furthermore, the suitability of the TTC concept so far has not been evaluated for the diverse group of industrial chemicals. In addition, the possible consequences for the level of protection of human health and the environment resulting from applying the TTC concept in the risk assessment should be examined...|$|E

The results are thus interpreted in relation to animal survival and evident toxicity (5) and it becomes possible to assign the chemical to one of the OECD classification categories.|$|R

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{performing}} transformations from geocentric to geodetic coordinates has received {{an inordinate amount}} of attention in the literature. Numerous approximate methods have been published. Almost none of the publications address the issue of efficiency and in most cases there is a paucity of error analysis. Recently there has been a surge of interest in this problem aimed at developing more efficient methods for real time applications such as DIS. Iterative algorithms have been proposed that are not of optimal efficiency, address only one error component and require a small but uncertain number of relatively expensive iterations for convergence. In this paper a well known rapidly convergent iterative approach is modified to eliminate intervening trigonometric function evaluations. A total error metric is defined that accounts for both angular and altitude errors. The initial guess is optimized to minimize the error for one iteration. The resulting algorithm yields transformations correct to one centimeter for altitudes out to one million kilometers.

The results show that although the current ADS- 33 C coupling criterion discriminates against those types of coupling typical of conventionally controlled helicopters, it is not always suited for the prediction of handling qualities of helicopters with modern control systems. Based on the observation that high frequency inputs during tracking are used to alleviate coupling, a frequency domain pitch-roll coupling criterion that uses the average coupling ratio between the bandwidth and neutral stability frequency is formulated. This criterion provides a more comprehensive coverage with respect to the different types of coupling, shows excellent consistency, and has the additional benefit that compliance <b>testing</b> data <b>are</b> obtained from the bandwidth/phase delay <b>tests,</b> so that <b>no</b> additional flight <b>testing</b> <b>is</b> <b>needed...</b>|$|R

Currently, cultivated GM crops include cotton, maize, rapeseed and soybean, carrying agronomic traits such as herbicide tolerance and insect resistance. Following the genetic modification of crops, three possible outcomes can be anticipated: these outcomes include the GM crop produced being equivalent to its untransformed counterpart, the GM crop differing from its untransformed counterpart with several well-defined characteristics, and the GM crop differing from its untransformed counterpart with a multitude of complex characteristics.

Further evidence is essential, as part of GM crop safety assessment, on the molecular characterisation of these crops.

With this approach, the potential advantages of self-timed asynchronous systems are explored for their practical use in a classical MCM testing application.

Re-evaluation of the TTC values of Cramer class I to III with the FhG database RepDose, that focus on existing chemicals, revealed that the thresholds are in the same range as those initially derived by Munro et al. Thus, the TTC concept is also applicable to existing chemicals and can be applied e. g. for exposure based waiving under REACH. However, only about 4 % of all chemicals in both databases were classified as being moderately toxic so that a reliable threshold for this class could not be derived. The analysis of the NOEL distributions showed that Cramer class I and III overlap to some extend indicating that the Cramer classification fails to discriminate toxic from low toxic chemicals. The observed toxic chemicals in Cramer class I lead to a conservative threshold for low toxic compounds, whereas low toxic chemicals in Cramer class III lead to a less conservative threshold for toxic compounds, indicating that a refinement of the Cramer decision tree regarding the structural classification <b>is</b> <b>needed.</b> The databases RepDose (FhG), Munro, Toxbase (TNO) and ToxRefDB (USEPA) were pooled to increase the applicability domain and the relevance of the Cramer Classes. Assessment factors for time and interspecies extrapolation were applied to L(N) OEL values to reduce data variability. The TTC values for oral exposure were determined and appear to be more conservative than those values of Munro. For the identification of outliers cut-off values were applied to exclude high toxic chemicals from Cramer class I and low toxic chemicals from Cramer class III. Analysis of the outliers regarding their structural and physico-chemical properties was performed using the OECD (Q) SAR Application Toolbox, STATISTIKA and ToxMatch.

5000|$|Kierkegaard {{stuck to}} his concept of Christianity as an inner {{struggle}} where the single individual stands before God rather than before others. Because standing before God is where the decisive struggle occurs for each single individual. Each single individual who has an [...] "interest" [...] in becoming a Christian has a God-relationship which is {{different from any other}} individual. The more we look to [...] "others" [...] for our God-relationship the more we have a simulated, mediated relationship with an idea. The idea, or ideal, isn't the highest. But getting the idea off the paper or the drawing board and putting it to use in life is the absolute for the Christian. In Works of Love (1847) he wrote, [...] "Love for the neighbor {{does not want to be}} sung about, it wants to be accomplished." [...] Christ didn't say one should think about loving the neighbor, he said, [...] "You shall love your neighbor as yourself." [...] (Matthew 22.39) He put it this way in Three Discourses on Imagined Occasions (1845) in Concluding Unscientific Postscript (1846) in Sickness Unto Death (1849) and again in Works of Love (1847). [...] Ah, it is much easier to look to the right and to the left than to look into oneself, much easier to haggle and bargain just as it is also much easier to underbid than to be silent-but the more difficult is still the one thing needful. Even in daily life everyone experiences that it is more difficult to stand directly before the person of distinction, directly before his royal majesty, than to move in the crowd; to stand alone and silent directly before the sharp expert is more difficult than to speak in a common harmony of equals-to say nothing of being alone directly before the Holy One and being silent. Søren Kierkegaard, Three Discourses on Imagined Occasions p. 31Where is the boundary for the single individual in his concrete existence between what is lack of will and what is lack of ability; what is indolence and earthly selfishness and what is the limitation of finitude? For an existing person, when is the period of preparation over, when this question will not arise again in all its initial, troubled severity; when is the time in existence that is indeed a preparation? Let all the dialecticians convene-they will not be able to decide this for a particular individual in concreto. Søren Kierkegaard Concluding Unscientific Postscript, Hong p. 490The lowest form of offense, humanly speaking the most innocent, is to leave the whole issue of Christ undecided, to pronounce in effect: 'I don't presume to judge the matter; I do not believe, but I pass no judgement." ..... The next form of offense is the negative, but passive form. Certainly it feels it cannot take no notice of Christ, leaving this business of Christ in abeyance and carrying on a busy life is something it is incapable of. But believing is something it cannot do either; so it stays staring at one and the same point, at the paradox. .... The final stage of offense is the positive form. It declares Christianity to be untruth and a lie. It denies Christ (that he has existed and that he is the one he claims to be) either Docetically or rationalistically, so that either Christ does not become a particular human being, but only appears to do so, or he becomes only a particular human being.

Therefore, if someone wanted to test whether he has faith, or try to attain faith, this really means he will prevent himself from attaining faith; he will bring himself into the restlessness of craving where faith is never won, for “You shall believe.” Works of Love, p. 33 [...] Suppose that there were two men: a double-minded man, who believes he has gained faith in a loving Providence, because he had himself experienced having been helped, even though he had hardheartedly sent away a sufferer whom he could have helped; and another man whose life, by devoted love, was an instrument in the hand of Providence, so that he helped many suffering ones, although the help he himself had wished continued to be denied him from year to year. Which of these two was in truth convinced that there is a loving Providence that cares for the suffering ones? Is it not a fair and a convincing conclusion: He that planted the ear, shall he not hear.(Psalms 94:9). But turn it around, and is the conclusion not equally fair and convincing: He whose life is sacrificing love shall he not trust that God is love? Yet in the press of busyness there is neither time nor quiet for the calm transparency which teaches equality, which teaches the willingness to pull in the same yoke with other men, that noble simplicity, that is in inner understanding with every man. There is neither time nor quiet to win such a conviction. Therefore, in the press of busyness even faith and hope and love and willing the Good become only loose words and double-mindedness. Or is it not double-mindedness to live without any conviction, or more rightly, to live in the constantly and continually changing fantasy that one has and that one has not a conviction!In this fashion feeling deceives the busy one into double-mindedness. Perhaps after the flaming up of the contrition of repentance, if this turns into emptiness, he had a conviction, at least so he believed, that there is a mercy that forgives sins. But even in the forgiveness he strongly denied any implication that he had been guilty of anything. Hence he had, so he thought, believed in a conviction that such a mercy exists, and yet in practice he denied its existence; in practice his attitude seemed designed to prove that it did not exist. Suppose that there were two men, that double-minded one, and then another man who would gladly forgive his debtor, if he himself might only find mercy. Which of these two was in truth convinced that such a mercy exists? The latter had indeed this proof that it exists, that he himself practices it, the former has no proof at all for himself, and only meets the contrary proof which he himself presents. Or the double-minded one perhaps had a feeling for right and wrong. It blazed strongly in him, especially if someone would describe in a poetical manner the zealous men, who by self-sacrifice in the service of truth, maintained righteousness and justice. Then some wrong happened to this man himself. And then it seemed to him as if there must appear some sign in heaven and upon earth since the world order could no more sleep than he until this wrong was put right again. And this was not self-love that inflamed him, but it was a feeling for justice, so he thought. And when he obtained his rights, no matter how much wrong it had cost those around him, then once again he praised the perfection of the world. Feeling had indeed carried him away, but also it had so enraptured him that he had forgotten the most important of all: to support righteousness and justice with self-sacrifice in the service of the truth. For which of these two is really convinced that justice exists in the world: the one that suffers wrong for doing the right, or the one that does wrong in order to obtain his right?
