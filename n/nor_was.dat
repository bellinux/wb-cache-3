5|$|By 1903 {{the synagogue}} was well {{established}} on Rivington Street, and, {{due to its}} capacity and prominence, was often the site of significant or mass meetings. In April 1903 a service to honor the memory of Reform rabbi and Zionist leader Gustav Gottheil was held there, and a similar service was held for Theodore Herzl the following year. At the latter service, which was boycotted by Orthodox rabbis, Herzl was not eulogized, <b>nor</b> <b>was</b> his name mentioned.|$|E

5|$|In September 1951, Oliphant {{applied for}} a visa {{to travel to the}} United States for a nuclear physics conference in Chicago. The visa was not refused, <b>nor</b> <b>was</b> Oliphant accused of subversive activities, but neither was it issued. This was the height of the Red Scare. The American McCarran Act {{restricted}} travel to the United States, and in Australia the Menzies government was attempting to ban the Communist Party, and was not inclined to support Oliphant against the American government. A subsequent request to travel to Canada via Hawaii in September 1954 was refused by the United States Department of State. Although Oliphant was granted a special waiver that allowed him to transit the US, he preferred to cancel the trip rather than accept this humiliation. The Menzies government subsequently excluded him from participating in or observing the British nuclear tests at Maralinga, <b>nor</b> <b>was</b> he allowed access to classified nuclear information for fear of antagonising the US.|$|E

5|$|The {{acquisition}} of the Hunter had solved part of the Swiss dilemma of needing to support both its ground forces and to deploy an air-to-air capability, but while the Hunter could provide some counter-air defense over a battlefield and escort ground-support fighters it was not supersonic <b>nor</b> <b>was</b> it capable of defending Swiss airspace. In 1961, the Swiss Parliament voted to procure 100French Dassault Mirage IIICs for this purpose and 67BL-64 Bloodhound surface-to-air missiles from the British.|$|E

5|$|Abdulwahab Hussain {{was also}} a member of Al Wefaq who {{resigned}} in 2005. Unlike Mushaima and al-Singace, Hussain left politics in 2005. He returned in 2009 when he co-founded Al Wafa' opposition group and became its official spokesperson. He played a bigger role in the uprising; he was not arrested when the uprising began <b>nor</b> <b>was</b> he outside the country. Hussain led the first demonstration in the uprising {{in the early hours of}} 14 February. He is also credited with suggesting autonomous action and total decentralization of the protest movement which was adopted by February 14 Youth Coalition, the group behind the call for an uprising in order to avoid getting infiltrated by government.|$|E
5|$|After the Invasion of Poland in 1939, Goebbels {{used his}} {{propaganda}} ministry and the Reich chambers to control {{access to information}} domestically. To his chagrin, his rival Joachim von Ribbentrop, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, continually challenged Goebbels' jurisdiction over the dissemination of international propaganda. Hitler declined to make a firm ruling on the subject, so the two men remained rivals {{for the remainder of}} the Nazi era. Goebbels did not participate in the military decision making process, <b>nor</b> <b>was</b> he made privy to diplomatic negotiations until after the fact.|$|E

He went to live with his brother, Solomon, in Vilnius, and although Gens was on a list to be sent to Soviet labor camps, he managed to secure an unregistered job at the Vilnius health department through an old military colleague, Colonel Juozas Ūsas. Gens was not on the official payroll, which meant that the political officer attached to the hospital {{did not need to be}} informed of his employment. During June 1941, when thousands of the Lithuanian elites were exiled to Siberia, Gens remained in hiding and was not deported.|$|E
