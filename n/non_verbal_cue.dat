40|$|An {{investigation}} into whether the colour red has more impact or leads to common perceptions {{about the price}} or value of retail products in advertising. ABSTRACT Colour is often an important <b>non</b> <b>verbal</b> <b>cue</b> in advertising. Much research has been dedicated to the creative aspects of advertising generally and to factors affecting consumer response in relation to marketing, advertising and pricing. This study looks at the colour red and investigates whether use predominant use of red in sale promotions print advertising is justified {{on the basis of}} its ability to impact cognitively or affectively. The study comprises of two experiments, one for awareness and one for price perception and purchase intent. In each experiment, red is compared to other colours in order to establish any significant differences. The second experiment goes further to examine whether the intensity of colour, verbal cues or demographic differences have an impact on the results. The literature review begins with an examination of price theory and the role of sales promotions in organizations. It considers advertising response models with focus on the persuasive hierarchy AIDA model. The impact of colour is then considered along with consumer psychology and behavior as well as theories relating to demographic and cultural responses to colour in advertising. Argument from the sources is then put forward to suggest that research into the effects of colour in advertising is underexplored and that the role of colour in affecting response is complex and is over oversimplifies by advertising practitioners. The research results are presented revealing few significant differences between red and alternative colours for awareness, price perception or purchase intent. The result for awareness is blurred by research limitations, but red does not emerge as a candidate for exacting higher levels of awareness than a number of other colours. In the second experiment, red is found to be inferior to blue in affecting purchase intent. Red at 50 % saturation is shown to have a more positive impact on purchase intent that a red hue at full saturation. Demographic splits do not show conclusive results, but it is suggested that a larger sample size would induce a better price perception of red for the black community than for other racial groupings. Discussion and recommendations follow. In this study, red shows no qualities to justify its predominant use in price promotion advertising and more benefit might be obtained for the brand by differentiating through use of alternative colours that may stand out in a sea of red over traditional sale periods. The principle recommendations are, firstly, the need to acquire a deeper understanding of the effect of colour in advertising. In the more complex, competitive global marketplace competition for customer attention is high and the margin of error for irrelevant advertising appeals are low. Secondly, the argument is made for colour usage to be built around long term branding concerns rather than short term requirements for advertising response...|$|E

Here {{we focus on}} the advantages of using rhythmic feedback as implicit marker during interactions. Through two different experimental studies with naive subjects and robots we show the utility of using and modelling rhythmic adaptation but also desynchronisation. We found out that rhythmical adaptation and bidirectional entrain-ment are imperative to reach synchronisation. Yet, we discovered that desynchronisation can be perceived as an implicit marker and hence be used to predict an issue in the interaction, making this interaction more pleasant. This shows that rhythmic cues such as synchronisation and desynchronisation are important elements for the development of interaction capabilities.

Most of these aspects are part of a category called social cognition. However, most tasks that are related to social cognition involve emotional processing, empathy, and social norms knowledge. When dealing with facial expression recognition, recent research has found that people with this disorder are unable to recognize facial expressions that exhibit negative emotions, including fear, sadness, anger, and disgust. As a result, Schizophrenic people have trouble comprehending situations that involve different types of empathy, especially situations that require empathy for pain.|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{understand}} ironic meanings, {{the interaction}} of <b>verbal</b> and <b>non</b> <b>verbal</b> information within a situational social context is necessary. The analysis of situational cues, including contextual and emotional <b>non</b> <b>verbal</b> <b>cues,</b> is considered crucial for the understanding of ironic intention and connected implied meanings (Utsumi, 2000; Wakusawa, 2007). However, previous ERP studies did not focus on such interactive dimension {{with the exception of}} the prosodic component (Cornejo et al., 2007; Regel et al., 2009; Balconi & Amenta, 2007, 2009). Participants and Methods: In this study we aimed to investigate irony elaboration by providing subjects with socially relevant contextual cues. Through auditory stimulation, enforced by iconic representation of the situational context, we studied ERP responses to ironic and non-ironic remarks. 20 subjects explored 50 scripts where the final remark could reach either an ironic or a non ironic effect. Results: ERP responses were analyzed as a function of prosody and type of sentence. Waves morphology indicated a clear P 200 component followed by a P 600 -effect. ANOVA performed on peak amplitudes indicated that P 200 and P 600 increasing for ironic sentences were statistically significant. Conclusions: Our data indicate that emotional components of prosody are early processed and influence the interpretation of upcoming information, as evidenced by the P 200 effect indicating an early categorization of ironic sentences as hedonically negative (Carretié et al., 2001; Alexandrov, 2007). On the other side, cognitive costs required to integrate multiple information (iconic, verbal, prosodic) into a coherent representation of discourse are evidenced by the increase of pragmatic-P 600 effect in ironic condition (Kuperberg, 2007) ...|$|R

Poor peer relationships can contribute to major depression, criminality, school failure, and substance use disorders. Adolescents with ADHD are more likely to find it difficult in making and keeping friends due to their attention deficits causing impairments in processing verbal and nonverbal language which is important for social skills and adolescent interaction; this may result in such adolescents being regarded by their peers as immature or as social outcasts. Romantic relationships are usually difficult in the adolescent and college age because of the lack of attention of <b>non</b> <b>verbal</b> <b>cues</b> such as flirting gestures, tone of voice, which may include misinterpretation if whether the person is romantically attracted to that person, along with the impulsiveness of [...] "jumping into" [...] relationships.|$|R

40|$|Background: There is a {{considerable}} literature that identifies emotion recognition deficits in {{people who have been}} diagnosed with schizophrenia. These findings remain unsubstantiated, particularly when one considers the findings from studies using genuine emotions. These studies suggest poor performance might be a result of an increased sensitivity to underlying emotions which {{have been shown to be}} important in deception detection. This study aimed to investigate whether people with persecutory ideation may be better at detecting deception than people without persecutory ideation. It was also proposed that people with persecutory ideation would have a deception bias, Le. guess that people were lying more often. Method: A lie detection test was devised with 'actors' lying and telling the truth about an activity they had undertaken that induced an emotional response. Two student samples (n= 21, n= 17) were recruited using the extreme groups methodology from an on line questionnaire that measured persecutory ideation. The two groups observed the clips of 'actors' and were compared on accuracy (how many they got right), bias (the predictions they made) and the level of confidence with which they made their judgement. Results: There were no significant differences on overall accuracy although the group high in persecutory ideation performed better on the clips in which the lie was presented first. Neither group showed a bias toward predicting that people were deceptive or truthful. People with high persecutory ideation were much more confident in their judgements about whether the 'actor' was being deceptive or truthful but in general levels of confidence were not related to being more accurate. Conclusion: The results were inconclusive due to the small sample size and concerns about whether the lie detection tool actually measured abilities to detect lies, bias and confidence. The indication that people high in persecutory ideation were slightly better at detecting lies was considered in the context of whether they had more accurate beliefs about what to look for in a 'liar', increased sensitivity to <b>non</b> <b>verbal</b> <b>cues</b> or a difficulty to engage with the social choreography associated with the truth bias. These areas warrant further investigation. Differences in the levels of confidence expressed about 'actors' trustworthiness could be a result of the jumping to conclusions and disconfirmatory biases, or it could be a consequence of the measure itself. The clinical implications in relation to engagement with people with persecutory ideation and <b>non</b> <b>verbal</b> behaviour of the therapist were discussed.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to examine {{linguistic}} and social processing in autism and Asperger syndrome (AS), through computer-mediated communication. The first investigation used conversational analysis, on a corpus of computer-mediated dialogue, generated by two adults with AS. The results revealed {{that one of the}} two individuals had problems asking questions. Hence, an inability to ask questions may be one aspect of AS communication, though it may be not universal in this population. The second study used a computer program called Bubble Dialogue (Gray, Creighton, McMahon & Cunningham, 1991) to investigate the working understanding of nonliteral language and responses to inappropriate requests in individuals with AS and high-functioning autism (HFA). The AS/HFA group showed poorer understanding of a figure of speech and were more likely to consent to socially inappropriate requests compared to their typically developing peers. In contrast, understanding of sarcasm was predicted neither by verbal ability, executive ability nor clinical diagnosis. The results suggest that having AS/HFA does not, a priori, dispose someone to having problems with communication and socialisation, and that verbal ability protects the individual to a certain extent. Additionally, executive ability also seems important in mediating socialisation and communication ability. The third experiment tested the hypothesis that an autistic preference for internet-based communication {{may be due to the}} absence of <b>verbal</b> and <b>non</b> <b>verbal</b> <b>cues,</b> physical distance, and slower rate of information exchange through that medium. To test this, participants worked out predetermined map routes by asking the experimenter closed questions either via text chat, or through telephone conversations. An initial examination of the results suggested that AS performance may in fact have been better via the telephone. However, a detailed look at the strategies employed by some individuals with AS suggests that their executive problems may have resulted in their use of a less than systematic way to solve the task in both media. The results of this study also indicate a relation between executive and mentalising ability because both are required to solve the task. Interestingly, many of the participants with AS could generate novel closed questions to successfully solve the map task in both media, though they were slower than controls. Using computer mediated communication has therefore given us greater detail into the nature of, and the factors that influence, communication in autism...|$|R

We cued prior learned Dutch words either during non-rapid eye movement sleep (NonREM) or during active or passive waking. Re-exposure to Dutch words during sleep improved later memory for the German translation of the cued words when compared with uncued words.

40|$|Prisoner {{defined as}} a person against the law, sentenced guilty by the court, and must undergo the {{punishment}} in jail. Prison has its own purpose as a place for prisoner to change, develop and to recognise themself, never again break the law and become a better man for family, God, and country. Exceeding prison capacity and violence through prisoner can escalate phyisical or <b>non</b> <b>verbal</b> aggresivitiy. This research has purpose {{to find out the}} relation between the perception to mental improvement to <b>non</b> <b>verbal</b> agresivity on prisoner in Kedungpane prison Semarang. Population in this research is 329 prisoner and with 220 prisoner as subject. Random sampling technique is used in this research. Participants were ask to complete 28 item of <b>non</b> <b>verbal</b> aggresivity scale (α= 0. 925) and 45 item perception of mental improvement scale (α= 0. 934). Analysis used simple regresion found that rxy= - 0. 698 with p= 0. 001 (p< 0. 05). Based on this result, concluded that perception of mental improvement has significant negative correlation with <b>non</b> <b>verbal</b> aggresivity. It means <b>non</b> <b>verbal</b> aggresivity could be lower if the prisoner have greater perception of mental improvement and vice versa. Perception of mental improvement has 44. 8 % effect to nonverbal aggresivity while 55. 2 % is effected by others.

40|$|Two divided-attention {{experiments}} {{were performed to}} evaluate the effectiveness of <b>verbal</b> and symbolic <b>cuing</b> on the primary task of editing flight route-way-point information. Cuing conditions were contrasted with a no-cue control. Symbolic cuing consisted of directing the operators to the appropriate keys throughout the sequence of primary task steps. <b>Verbal</b> <b>cuing</b> consisted of a short instruction displayed on the CRT just prior to the next step. In Experiment I, symbolic cuing proved effective in improving editing accuracy. In Experiment 2, symbolic cuing resulted in reduced early-trial edit-completion time. <b>Verbal</b> <b>cuing,</b> however, was not effective on these tasks in either experiment. It is theorized that symbolic cuing lightened the cognitive load, whereas <b>verbal</b> <b>cuing</b> did not reduce the cognitive load since it still required attention to read the verbal message...|$|R

This is primarily due to asymmetry information between doctor and patient since in most cases patients heavily rely on <b>non</b> <b>verbal</b> communication {{as a tool to}} get information they need. This research is aimed to analyze the effect of <b>non</b> <b>verbal</b> communication to patient's satisfaction from different point of view of demograph ic perspectives. The research was carried out in inpatient of selected hospitals in Makassar city of Indonesia involving 420 respondents taken using proportional stratified random sampling technique. The research design is quantitative research using cross sectional study. Data collected using questionna ires. The research's result shows that the influence of physician's <b>non</b> <b>verbal</b> communication consisting of artifact, haptic, kinesics, chronemics, proxemics, and vocalic to patient's satisfaction are varied from different demographics perspectives...|$|R
40|$|This study {{explored}} {{the effects of}} <b>verbal</b> <b>cueing</b> on the eye gaze behaviors of two school-aged children (6 : 1 and 5 : 2 years old) with autism during social interactions (i. e. turn-taking activities). Participants took part in three turn-taking activities with the experimenter across two different conditions. In the verbal condition the experimenter offered <b>verbal</b> <b>cues</b> that were designed to help the participants predict {{what was going to}} happen next during the activity. In the nonverbal condition, the same activities and protocol were used except the experimenter gave no <b>verbal</b> <b>cues.</b> An alternating treatments design utilizing two conditions (verbal, nonverbal) was used. Results indicated that there was not a significant difference in the eye gaze behaviors of the participants in the verbal and nonverbal conditions. This supports some research that indicates <b>verbal</b> <b>cues</b> do not benefit children with autism in regards to joint attention. The nature of the activities, motivation of the participants, and design related limitations may have further contributed to the lack of differences in eye gaze behaviors across conditions. ...|$|R
40|$|Research in Human-Robot {{interaction}} {{stresses the}} importance of <b>non</b> <b>verbal</b> behaviours in order to enforce credibility and believability in robots. When using small and cheap entertainment robots, <b>verbal</b> <b>cues</b> are very limited, gaze and facial gestures can be absent, whereas body gestures comprise – {{as a matter of fact}} – only stereotyped behaviours. The main contribution of this article is an evaluation study about the effects of pure body gestures when entertainment robots are observed by humans in an interaction process. Robots are required to execute a sequence of behaviours, as if they were playing on a stage. To this aim, a model for composing behaviour primitives for entertainment humanoid robots using AND/OR graphs is presented. Both single and multi robot scenarios are considered. The framework can sequence robot behaviours using complex scripts, which can be easily programmed using standard ontology-based knowledge representation mechanisms. Procedures are used to operate on the ontology representation in order to execute behaviours in a fully hierarchical and recursive fashion. Experimental validation with an interview campaign has been carried out using toy Kondo robots...|$|R
