Fibrillin, the {{major component of}} 10 – 12 -nm microfibrils, appeared 5 days after grafting in a band-like fashion similar to collagen VII at the prospective basement membrane, and then formed the characteristic microfibrillar candelabra at the dermo-epidermal junction by fusion of several fine microfibrils to communicating microfibrils projecting downward into the reticular layer of the <b>neodermis.</b> Four to five months after grafting, several communicating microfibrils were connected to a web of horizontally undulating microfibrils of the <b>neodermis</b> which had developed independently.

40|$|PURPOSE: Trauma to the digits often leaves {{soft tissue}} defects with exposed bone, joint, and/or tendon that require soft tissue replacement. The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effectiveness of acellular dermal regeneration template combined with full-thickness skin grafting for soft tissue reconstruction in digital injuries with soft tissue defects. METHODS: Acellular dermal regeneration template was used to reconstruct digital injuries with exposed bone, joint, tendon, and/or hardware not amenable to treatment with healing by secondary intention, rotation flaps, or primary skin grafts. Acellular dermal regeneration template was applied to 21 digits in 17 patients. Nineteen digits had exposed bone, 8 digits had exposed tendon, 6 digits had exposed joints, and 2 digits had exposed hardware. The acellular dermal regeneration template was sutured over the soft tissue defect. Over 3 weeks, a <b>neodermis</b> formed. The superficial silicone layer of the acellular dermal regeneration template was removed, and the digits received full-thickness epidermal autografting with cotton bolster. RESULTS: The duration of postoperative follow-up extended to a minimum of 12 months. For the injury sites where acellular dermal regeneration template was applied, the total area of application ranged from 1 cm(2) to 24 cm(2), with the largest individual site measuring 12 cm(2). Twenty of 21 digits demonstrated 100 % incorporation of the acellular dermal regeneration template skin substitute. One digit that had sustained multilevel trauma developed necrosis requiring revision amputation. Full-thickness epidermal autografting was performed an average of 24 days after acellular dermal regeneration template skin substitute application and demonstrated a 100 % take in 16 of 20 digits and partial graft loss of 15 % to 25 % in 4 of 20 digits that did not require further treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Acellular dermal regeneration template combined with secondary full-thickness skin grafting is an effective method of skin reconstruction in complex digital injuries with soft tissue defects involving exposed bone, tendon, and joint. The <b>neodermis</b> increases tissue bulk and facilitates epidermal autografting with digital injuries that otherwise would require flap coverage or skeletal shortening of the digit.

40|$|Numerous {{techniques}} {{have been described}} {{for the treatment of}} pilonidal disease, yet there remains no consensus on the optimal management of recurrent pilonidal disease.

40|$|Background: The {{multifunctional}} transforming {{growth factor}} beta (TGF-β) is a glycoprotein {{that exists in}} three isoforms.

While conservative methods (e. g. topical or systemic antibiotics, retinoids) are effective for the treatment of acne rosacea, a surgical intervention is appropriate and required in established rhinophyma. A variety of surgical techniques to reduce proliferated tissue have been reported. However, a surgical “gold standard” for treating the distorting phymatous skin alterations has not yet been established. PRESENTATION OF CASEThis case report details a novel surgical approach: the combination of a bovine collagen–elastin with simultaneous autologous non-meshed split-thickness skin grafting. DISCUSSIONOur approach was based on the following considerations: deep excision facilitates complete removal of diseased tissue that ultimately reduces the risk of recurrence in contrast to commonly applied methods relying predominantly on superficial lesion removal with subsequent spontaneous re-epithelialization. The application of a dermal substitute to create a <b>neodermis</b> covered by split-thickness autologous skin grafting may serve as a functionally and aesthetically appropriate model without requiring the recruitment of donor sites for full-thickness skin grafts or even local flaps. CONCLUSIONThe combination of deep excision and single-step replacement of epidermal–dermal components may ultimately avoid the recurrence of rhinophyma and contribute to a full skin repair leading to satisfactory functional and aesthetic outcome...|$|E
40|$|ACL- 92; MMNPInternational audienceWe have {{previously}} shown {{the importance of}} dermal fibroblasts within skin substitutes for promoting {{the emergence of a}} functional <b>neodermis</b> after grafting in humans. However, the use of fibroblasts from sources other than the dermis needs to be evaluated for patients with extensive skin loss. Here we examined the capacity of human bone marrow-derived cells (BMDCs), selected for their ability to adhere to plastic culture dishes, to behave like human dermal fibroblasts when incorporated within a 3 D in vitro reconstructed tissue that promotes dermal fibroblast differentiation. Like dermal fibroblasts, BMDCs contracted a collagen matrix and were growth regulated by the matrix environment. They had the same shape and their nuclei had the same form factor as dermal fibroblasts. In addition, both cell types expressed desmin and vimentin but not alpha-smooth muscle actin. BMDCs deposited collagen types I and III, and fibrillin- 1 with similar efficiency to dermal fibroblasts. In addition, BMDCs have the potential to regulate this deposition, as they produced metalloproteinases (MMP 1, MMP 2, and MMP 9) and metalloproteinase inhibitors (TIMP 1) very similarly to dermal fibroblasts. BMDCs can thus be induced to express functions resembling those of dermal fibroblasts, including those involved in the wound healing process...|$|E
40|$|BackgroundTo {{minimize}} the inflammatory reaction and improve healing, a new modified dermal substitute composed of an atelocollagen, chondroitin- 6 -sulfate, and amniotic membrane (AM) {{was applied to}} full-thickness skin defects in a pig. Atelocollagen was extracted from bovine skin, and two modified dermal substitutes were generated according to the cross-linking type. MethodsThe AM-collagen dermal substitutes were characterized and compared with currently used dermal substitutes in a pig skin defect model. There were five experimental groups: dehydrothermal (DHT) cross-linking atelocollagen with the AM on the top (AM-DHT), DHT and chemical cross-linking atelocollagen with the AM on the top (AM-DHT/chemical), Terudermis, Integra, and AlloDerm. After 3 × 3 cm full-thickness skin defects {{on the back of}} a pig were created, each dermal substitutes dermal substitutes was randomly grafted on the defects. Two weeks after grafting, autologous partial-thickness skin was over-grafted on the <b>neodermis.</b> The take rate of the dermal substitutes, skin, and histological sections were all assessed at 1, 2, and 4 weeks postoperatively. ResultsMore rapid healing and a higher take rate were evident in the AM-DHT and Terudermis groups. Histological examination revealed fewer inflammatory cells and more fibroblast hyperplasia in these two groups. Four weeks after surgery, the amount of newly formed collagen was significantly more appropriate in the AM-DHT group.

In both normal and steroid-impaired pigs, CRT increased granulation tissue formation. Immunohistochemical analyses of the wounds 5 and 10 days after injury revealed marked up-regulation of transforming growth factor-β 3 (a key regulator of wound healing), a threefold increase in macrophage influx, {{and an increase in}} the cellular proliferation of basal keratinocytes of the new epidermis and of cells of the <b>neodermis.</b> In vitro studies confirmed that CRT induced a greater than twofold increase in the cellular proliferation of primary human keratinocytes, fibroblasts, and microvascular endothelial cells (with 100 pg/ml, 100 ng/ml, and 1. 0 pg/ml, respectively). Moreover, using a scratch plate assay, CRT maximally induced the cellular migration of keratinocytes and fibroblasts (with 10 pg/ml and 1 ng/ml, respectively). In addition, CRT induced concentration-dependent migration of keratinocytes, fibroblasts macrophages, and monocytes in chamber assays.

The {{origins of}} {{parasitism}} in the Platyhelminthes: a summary interpreted {{on the basis}} of recent literature, International Journal for Parasitology 27 : 739 - 746. A summary is given of the 4 contributions on the origins of parasitism in the Platyhelminthes. Recent ecological literature is used to interpret some of the findings. In particular, recent findings on rugged fitness landscapes, the increasing difficulty of long-jump adaptations, complexity catastrophes, and empty phenotypic space are discussed in order to find an explanation for the large number of Neodermata and the scarcity of parasitic turbellarians; it is concluded that evolutionary stasis of symbiotic turbellarians that are “trapped ” in their particular niches is responsible for the small number of symbiotic species of turbellarians, rather than competitive exclusion by the numerous neodermatans. The earliest neodermatans were probably already dependent on the production of many offspring; hence the protoneodermatan was probably a species preadapted to parasitism by high fecundity. Monogenea produce few offspring in spite of their rich and secure food supply; the protomonogenean was either a species with a complex behaviour pattern for habitat selection or, alternatively, a species with high fecundity subsequently reduced to permit the evolution of more complex behaviour patterns (switch from r- to K-strategy).

40|$|A well-characterized collagen-glycosaminoglycan matrix (CGM) {{that has}} been shown to {{function}} as a dermal analog was seeded with freshly disaggregated autologous keratinocytes and applied to full-thickness wounds in a porcine model. CGM were impregnated with 50, 000 keratinocytes per cm 2, a seeding density that produces a confluent epidermis within 19 d post-grafting and affords a 60 -fold surface expansion of the donor epidermis. In this study, the temporal sequence of events in epidermal and neodermal formation was analyzed histopathologically and immunohistochemically from 4 to 35 d post-grafting. The epidermis was observed to form from clonal growth of individual keratinocytes into epithelial cords and islands that gradually enlarged, coalesced, differentiated to form large horn cysts, and finally reorganized at the graft surface to form a fully differentiated, normally oriented epidermis with rete ridges. Simultaneously, a <b>neodermis</b> formed from migration of endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and macrophages into the CGM from the underlying wound bed, resulting in formation of blood vessels, the production of abundant extracellular matrix, and the degradation of the CGM fibers, respectively. Gradually, the stromal cellularity of the CGM decreased and collagen deposition and remodeling increased to form a neodermal connective tissue matrix beneath the newly formed epidermis. Complete dissolution of the CGM occurred, {{partly as a result of}} degradation by an ongoing foreign-body giant cell reaction that peaked at 8 – 12 d post-grafting, but neither acute inflammation nor evidence of immune stimulation were observed.

40|$|In {{order to}} effect {{permanent}} closure in burns patients suffering from full thickness wounds, replacing their skin via split thickness autografting, is essential. Dermal substitutes {{in conjunction with}} widely meshed split thickness autografts (+/- cultured keratinocytes) reduce scarring at the donor and recipient sites of burns patients by reducing demand for autologous skin (both surface area and thickness), without compromising dermal delivery at the wound face. Tissue engineered products such as Integra consist of a dermal template which is rapidly remodelled to form a <b>neodermis,</b> at which time the temporary silicone outer layer is removed and replaced with autologous split thickness skin. Whilst provision of a thick tissue engineered dermis at full thickness burn sites reduces scarring, it is hampered by delays in vascularisation which results in clinical failure. The ultimate success of any skin graft product is dependent upon a number of basic factors including adherence, haemostasis {{and in the case}} of viable tissue grafts, success is ultimately dependent upon restoration of a normal blood supply, and hence this study. Ultimately, the goal of this research is to improve the therapeutic properties of tissue replacements, through impregnation with growth factors aimed at stimulating migration and proliferation of microvascular endothelial cells into the donor tissue post grafting. For the purpose of my masters, the aim was to evaluate the responsiveness of a dermal microvascular endothelial cell line to growth factors and haemostatic factors, in the presence of the glycoprotein vitronectin. Vitronectin formed the backbone for my hypothesis and research due to its association with both epithelial and, more specifically, endothelial migration and proliferation. Early work using a platform technology referred to as VitroGro (Tissue Therapies Ltd), which is comprised of vitronectin bound BP 5 /IGF- 1, aided keratinocyte proliferation. I hypothesised that this result would translate to another epithelium - endothelium. VitroGro had no effect on endothelial proliferation or migration. Vitronectin increases the presence of Fibroblast Growth Factor (FGF) and Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) receptors, enhancing cell responsiveness to their respective ligands. So, although Human Microvascular Endothelial Cell line 1 (HMEC- 1) VEGF receptor expression is generally low, it was hypothesised that exposure to vitronectin would up-regulate this receptor. HMEC- 1 migration, but not proliferation, was enhanced by vitronectin bound VEGF, as well as vitronectin bound Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF), both of which could be used to stimulate microvascular endothelial cell migration for the purpose of transplantation. In addition to vitronectin's synergy with various growth factors, it has also been shown to play a role in haemostasis. Vitronectin binds thrombin-antithrombin III (TAT) to form a trimeric complex that takes on many of the attributes of vitronectin, such as heparin affinity, which results in its adherence to endothelium via heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSP), followed by unaltered transcytosis through the endothelium, and ultimately its removal from the circulation. This has been documented as a mechanism designed to remove thrombin from the circulation. Equally, it could be argued that it is a mechanism for delivering vitronectin to the matrix. My results show that matrix-bound vitronectin dramatically alters the effect that conformationally altered antithrombin three (cATIII) has on proliferation of microvascular endothelial cells. cATIII stimulates HMEC- 1 proliferation in the presence of matrix-bound vitronectin, as opposed to inhibiting proliferation in its absence. Binding vitronectin to tissues and organs prior to transplant, in the presence of cATIII, will have a profound effect on microvascular infiltration of the graft, by preventing occlusion of existing vessels whilst stimulating migration and proliferation of endothelium within the tissue...|$|E
40|$|To date, the {{reconstructive}} approach addressing chronic non-healing wounds, deep tissue damage, {{and severe}} wound defects relies upon avascular dermal grafts and autologous flap techniques.

These products fail to include an inherent vascular network and the supporting cells necessary to ensure adequate incorporation and graft survival beyond the most optimal wound beds. Herein, we fabricate a pre-vascularized full-thickness cellularized skin equivalent containing a three-dimensional vascularized network of interconnected macro and microchannels lined with vascular cells, within a collagen <b>neodermis</b> populated with fibroblasts, and an epidermis comprised of human keratinocytes capable of providing whole tissue perfusion.

Utilizing a type-I collagen hydrogel matrix, vascular cells were seeded within pre-fabricated channels and allowed to proliferate to generate an endothelialized microvasculature. These collagen scaffolds were subsequently anastomosed into rat models to demonstrate the clinical feasibility of such approach. The present study aims to more closely recapitulate the in vivo structure of human skin via the incorporation of vital epidermal and dermal components of native skin into a biocompatible construct containing a complex hierarchical vasculature, which may be anastomosed using standard microsurgical techniques and immediately perfused. Pluronic F 127 {{was used as the}} sacrificial material: 1. 5 mm diameter “U” shaped macrofibers and 100 - 500 µm-interwoven microfibers were heat extruded and then embedded within type-I collagen into which Cyan Fluorescent Protein (CFP) -tagged human placental pericytes and human foreskin fibroblasts (HFF 1) had been encapsulated. Following pluronic sacrifice, resultant channels were intraluminally seeded with Red Fluorescent Protein (RFP) -tagged human aortic smooth muscle cells, Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) -tagged human umbilical vein endothelial cells, and topically seeded with human epidermal keratinocytes (HEK). Construct microstructure was analyzed using multiphoton microscopy (MPM) after 7, 14 and 28 days of culture. Additionally, after 14 and 28 days of culture, endothelial cells were extracted from the construct using collagenase digestion and Real Time (RT) -qPCR performed to analyze expression of markers of angiogenesis and maturation of the vascular network. MPM demonstrated a hierarchical vascular network containing macro and microvessels lined by endothelial and smooth muscle cells, supported by perivascular pericytes, all in appropriate microanatomic arrangement. Neodermal HFF 1 proliferated throughout the observation period and the HEK neoepidermis developed into a stratified epidermis along the superior aspect of the construct. Angiogenic sprouting from the nascent vascular network into neovessel like structures was noted. RT- qPCR revealed relative expression of Jagged 1, Dll 4, Ve-Cadherin, and CD 31. We have successfully fabricated a novel tissue-engineered pre-vascularized full thickness skin flap, which recapitulates the inherent hierarchical vasculature found within human skin and is suitable for in vivo perfusion. We provide the platform for an on- demand, geometrically tunable tissue engineered skin equivalent with an anastomosable vascular network. This tissue-engineered skin flap holds the potential to transform reconstructive surgical practice by eliminating the consequences of donor site morbidity, and enabling rationally designed, patient-specific flaps for each unique wound environment and anatomic location. 2017 - 06 - 16 T 00 : 00 : 00...|$|E
40|$|Tissue {{engineering}} (TE), one of {{the most}} rapidly growing fields of life science, is an interdisciplinary area in which technical, biological and medical expertise co-fertilize on another with the ultimate aim of restoring, maintaining or improving tissues and/or organs. This purpose links TE closely to research concerning reconstructive plastic surgery. At present, TE utilizes two major approaches: I. Autologous cells are cultivated outside the body in vitro and returned as autotransplants to the patient. II. Autologous cells are stimulated to regenerate in the patient - in vivo usually together with a suitable carrier structure or substances that regulates cell function. This approach is referred to as guided tissue regeneration. With regards to full thickness skin wounds, such as deep burn wounds, the belief today is that optimal treatment must achieve restoration of both the dermal and the epidermal regions of the skin. At present, the treatment considered to be the gold standards for treatment of full thickness wounds only restore the epidermis of the wound, with either split thickness skin grafts or cultured keratinocytes. This thesis focuses on approaches allowing restoration of both the dermis and the epidermis. In order to achieve this, different dermal matrices have been characterised and evaluated. A suitable dermal matrix should fulfil a number of demands: I. It should be biodegradable II. Epithelial cells should be able to attach to this matrix III. Epithelial cells should be able to migrate and proliferate on the matrix IV. The dermal matrix should stimulate regeneration of an autologous <b>neodermis</b> (i. e. ingrowth of fibroblasts and angiogenesis) V. It should be possible to store the matrix for long period of time without loss of function VI. Production, use and storage of the matrix should be cost-effective In Paper I and II cell-free dermis was used as a carrier for epithelial cells cultured in vitro. Cell-free dermis fulfils most of the demands enumerated above, and reliable techniques for the cultivation of both keratinocytes and urothelial cells for autotransplantation were developed. A disadvantage associated with the use cell-free dermis is its limited ability to be maintained as a ready-to-use product, primarily due to the complicated and, to date, costly process of production. In Paper III the possibility to harvest urothelial cells with a non-invasive technique was investigated. The majority of patients suffering from hypospadia are children. To be able to harvest cells for transplantation through bladder-washing, without loss of proliferative capacity would be a great advantage. In search for a more convenient product, a poly urethane urea scaffold (PUUR) was investigated in paper IV. An in vitro study followed by a pilot study- in vivo-on healthy volunteers, revealed that the PUUR scaffold possesses great potential as template for dermal regeneration. Unfortunately, this scaffold is not rapidly degraded in vivo. In paper V the suitability of a three-dimensional system consisting of biodegradable macroporous gelatine spheres as carriers for transplantation of keratinocytes into full-thickness wounds was examined in an in vivo study, involving nude rats. Gelatine is an autologous material and thus, biodegradable and the small size of the spheres allow them to be injected with a syringe at location where they are needed. In addition, the pores greatly increase the number of keratinocytes that can be cultured on these spheres. In comparison to treatment with split-thickness skin grafts and cultured keratinocytes in single-cell solution, macroporous gelatine spheres coated with keratinocytes promoted an earlier wound closure and better skin quality. Accordingly, such spheres represent a highly promising and interesting matrix for dermal regeneration and for co-cultivation with epithelial cells...|$|E
40|$|TGF-β isoforms are {{important}} signalling molecules in wound repair in the skin. Transforming growth factor β 3 (TGF-β 3) has {{been implicated in}} scarless healing. In both animal and human models the application of exogenous TGF-β 3 causes {{a reduction in the}} inflammatory response and improves the architecture of the <b>neodermis.</b> Research into the influence of TGF-β on scarring has tended to focus on fibroblasts. However, keratinocytes {{play a major role in}} scarring both indirectly, as a result of their influence over the behaviour of fibroblasts and also by directly influencing wound contraction. Thus, experiments were carried out to investigate the influence of TGF-β 3 on the behaviours of a keratinocyte cell line (HaCaT). Incubation with TGF-β 3 increased cell spreading and appeared to reduce cell-surface contacts indicated by both SPR imaging and a detachment assay. TGF-β 3 also caused a decreased cell alignment response to microcontact printed protein patterns, in part due to the deposition of laminin which is associated with the TGF-β induced cell migration. There is evidence that TGF-β isoforms differentially influence the outcome of wound healing. Similar to the results produce following addition of exogenous TGF-β 3, the neutralisation of TGF-β 1 and 2 has been shown to reduce scar formation in the adult wounds. During reepithelialisation keratinocytes experience a dynamic environment. Both extracellular matrix proteins and growth factors influence the progression of wound repair which includes both cell migration and proliferation. Few studies have examined collective cell behaviour in response to TGF-β isoforms and ECM coated substrates. Thus both wound closure and cell proliferation assays were conducted for different ECM proteins fibronectin, laminin and collagen type I and for TGF-β 1, 2 and 3. Rates of wound closure were significantly reduced on laminin coated substrates while cell proliferation rates were increased. TGF-β 2 and 3 induced significant increases in wound closure rates. This appeared to correspond with an increase in the number of cells independently migrating out from the wound margins. Only TGF-β 3 caused a significant decrease in cell proliferation over a 4 day period. Laminin 332 deposition is central to the reepithelialisation process and is known to be induced in response to TGF-β. Thus experiments were carried out to investigate HaCaT cell laminin 332 deposition in response to TGF-β 1, 2 and 3. Both an immunofluorescence staining technique and an ELISA based semi-quantification method was used. Following 4 day incubation all TGF-β isoforms significantly increased laminin 332 deposition; however TGF-β 2 and 3 caused the most significant increases. Integrin receptors enable cell-matrix interactions during wound repair. TGF-β is known to influence the expression of integrin subunits. Thus, experiments were carried out to compare the influence of each TGF-β isoform on the expression of subunits α 3, α 2, α 5, β 1 and β 4. All TGF-β isoforms significantly increased all subunit expression. TGF-β 3 caused the most significant increase in β 4 and both TGF-β 2 and 3 caused the most significant increase in α 2. While there were differences in cell responses to each isoforms, TGF-β 3 did not stand out from the other two isoforms. Interestingly, TGF-β 2 shared more similarities with TGF-β 3 than it did with TGF-β 1, in its role in enhancing wound closure and LN 332 deposition. These comparative studies have shown that differences exist in the way TGF-β isoforms influence HaCaT cell behaviour, namely migration, laminin deposition and integrin expression.

40|$|Tissue {{engineering}} {{is becoming an}} important field {{for the development of}} new tissues in vitro for replacement of diseased or worn out parts of the body. This thesis describes some characteristics of cultured human cells seeded on transplantable materials for skin repair and cardiovascular surgery. Transplantation of sheets of cultured epidermal cells have been widely used for the treatment of large bums and has saved many lives. However, there are some negative features in conjunction with such grafting, e. g. extensive scarring, {{due to the lack of}} a functioning dermis at the time of transplantation. To improve the understanding of wound healing in humans, we studied the early events occurring during the reepithelialization process in a human, partial thickness in vitro wound model. The wounds were incubated either submerged in cell culture medium or elevated to the air-liquid interface. The time-course for deposition of a basement membrane was similar between both types of wounds. Collagen type VII and laminin was deposited beneath the migrating keratinocytes while collagen type IV was became detectable after reepithelialization. Terminal differentiation, on the other hand, was complete only in elevated wounds, as indicated by immuno-labeling of involucrin and filaggrin. A biodegradable bovine collagen membrane was studied as a dermal support for healing of human in vivo full thickness wounds and results were obtained 7, 21 or 42 days after grafting. Reepithelialization was complete at day 7, and terminal differentiation was normalized from day 21. A <b>neodermis</b> was generated and matured evident by an increasing number of fibroblasts and a diminishing procollagen-content. A neovasculature was apparent on day 21. To study the potential use of this collagen membrane as a skin substitute, epithelial cells (keratinocytes) and fibroblasts, isolated simultaneously from a biopsy of human skin, were cultured and seeded onto opposite sides of the membrane. Growth characteristics and differentiation were comparable to those on tissue culture plastics, and the technique appeared suitable to achieve a transplantable graft with a confluent or subconfluent epithelium and dermal fibroblasts. This biocompatible collagen membrane may be used as a true dermal implant and also as a supporting matrix for the transplantation of autologous keratinocytes and fibroblasts, and possibly to be used as a novel skin substitute. In order to improve the outcome of cardiovascular prostheses, especially synthetic vascular grafts with small inner diameters, the effects of pre-forming an endothelial cell lining have been investigated. Problems such as thrombus formation and late graft failure can thereby be partly avoided, but little functional data exist, especially from endothelial cells on bioprosthetic tissue. Cultured human saphenous vein endothelial cells were used to in vitro endothelialize ePTFE, a synthetic vascular graft material, and a photooxidized biologic pericardial tissue aimed for use as prosthetic heart valve material. Endothelial cells seeded to achieve immediate confluency were shown to deposit basement membrane proteins within 6 hours after seeding on both types of matrices. The reendothelialization of a 4 -mm wide denuded area was shown to comprise both migration and proliferation of endothelial cells, and the process was completed within 4 days on uncoated biologic tissue and 15 days on serum-precoated ePTFE. After complete endothelialization of intact heart valve prostheses, they were exposed to a pulsatile flow in a specially designed flow-device that mediated opening and closing of the valve under conditions that partly mimicked physiological flow conditions. The cell monolayer on the cusps was shown to be intact and the adaptation of cells to the pulsatile flow was verified by the change in morphology and rearrangement of actin-stress fibers. To exclude any procoagulant activity of HSVECs after endothelialization, the expression of tissue factor (TF) was determined. TF mRNA and TF-protein levels were shown to be lower in HSVECs on bioprosthetic material compared to normal cell culture plastic, whereas only a minor difference was seen in levels of functional TF. In conclusion, we showed that cultured HSVECs seeded on bioprosthetic materials withstand pulsatile flow, heal denuded areas and are not apparently procoagulant. This technology may thus be used to enhance the performance of bioprosthetic heart valve prostheses...|$|E
