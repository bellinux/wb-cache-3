25|$|Gas {{blending}} for {{scuba diving}} (or Gas mixing) is the filling of diving cylinders with <b>non-air</b> breathing gases such as nitrox, trimix and heliox. Use of these gases is generally intended to improve overall {{safety of the}} planned dive, by {{reducing the risk of}} decompression sickness and/or nitrogen narcosis, and may improve ease of breathing.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in 1968, ACTS {{provided}} airframe, {{engine and}} component solutions to <b>non-Air</b> Canada customers, helping them expand their maintenance, repair, and operations (MRO) reach to new carriers. With Air Canada entering bankruptcy protection in 2003, {{the relation between}} the airline and others subsidiaries like ACTS was affected and transformed. In 2004, ACE Aviation Holdings became the parent company of Air Canada and with this restructuring, a decision was taken to separate Air Canada Technical Services from Air Canada the airline. In 2005, ACTS {{became one of the first}} members of Airbus MRO Network.|$|E
25|$|But ASR is {{not limited}} to the {{intertidal}} environment. Most tropical and temperate fish species living in stagnant waters engage in ASR during hypoxia. One study looked at 26 species representing eight families of <b>non-air</b> breathing fishes from the North American great plains, and found that all but four of them performed ASR during hypoxia. Another study looked at 24 species of tropical fish common to the pet trade, from tetras to barbs to cichlids, and found that all of them performed ASR. An unusual situation in which ASR is performed is during winter, in lakes covered by ice, at the interface between water and ice or near air bubbles trapped underneath the ice.|$|E
500|$|Commercial {{transportation}} of breathing gas cylinders {{with a combined}} weight of more than 1000 pounds may only be done by a commercial HAZMAT transportation company. Transport of cylinders with a combined weight of less than 1000 pounds requires a manifest, the cylinders must have been tested and inspected to federal standards, and the contents marked on each cylinder. Transportation must {{be done in a}} safe manner, with the cylinders restrained from movement. No special licence is required. DOT regulations require content labels for all cylinders under the regulations, but according to PSI, labelling of breathing air will not be enforced. Oxygen or <b>non-air</b> oxidizing (O2≥23.5% [...] ) mixtures must be labelled. Private (non-commercial) transport of scuba cylinders is not covered by this regulation.|$|E
2500|$|City buses {{cost about}} R$3.80 to ride. They come in both <b>non-air</b> {{conditioned}} (R$3.80) and air conditioned versions (R$3–R$5.40). The {{system may be}} relatively safe by day but less so at night. Integration of bus lines has been recently implemented, allowing users to take two <b>non-air</b> conditioned bus rides in two hours paying just one ticket. It is necessary to have a registered electronic card (the [...] "Bilhete Único Carioca (BUC)") in order to benefit of this system.|$|E

2500|$|From 1951 to 1962, C-119C, F and G models {{served with}} U.S. Air Forces in Europe (USAFE) and Far East Air Forces (FEAF) as the {{first-line}} Combat Cargo units, and did yeoman work as freight haulers with the 60th Troop Carrier Wing, the 317th Troop Carrier Wing and the 465th Troop Carrier Wing in Europe, based first in Germany {{and then in}} France with roughly 150 aircraft operating anywhere from Greenland to India. A similar number of aircraft served in the Pacific and the Far East. In 1958, the 317th absorbed the 465th, and transitioned to the C-130s, but the units of the former 60th Troop Carrier Wing, the 10th, 11th and 12th Troop Carrier Squadrons, continued to fly C-119s until 1962, the last <b>non-Air</b> Force Reserve and <b>non-Air</b> National Guard operational units to fly the [...] "Boxcars." ...|$|E
2500|$|The German {{military}} {{followed a}} practice whereby the different {{branches of the}} military were responsible for all POWs of equivalent branches. Hence the Luftwaffe [...] was normally responsible for any Allied aircrew taken prisoner. This included captured naval aviators, such {{as members of the}} British Fleet Air Arm. In a few cases, other <b>non-air</b> force personnel were also held at Stalag Luft III.|$|E
2500|$|Heat and {{humidity}} of Houston make air conditioning important in day-to-day life. [...] Most indoor workers spend the hottest {{part of the}} day in air conditioning. After World War II, air conditioning stimulated the growth of Houston, called the most air-conditioned city in the world in 1950. For construction workers, landscapers, and others who must work outdoors, there is little relief from the summer heat {{and humidity}}. Industrial workers, automobile mechanics and others who usually work in <b>non-air</b> conditioned indoor spaces often rely on large electric fans to provide some relief.|$|E
2500|$|In September 1995, five of {{the first}} batch of 11 <b>non-air</b> {{conditioned}} panorama cars were thoroughly overhauled, air conditioning and a new-style seat (as in the third three-car Northerner and Overlander set) were installed. Two of these were permanently allocated to the Southerner, the second two temporarily, [...] with the fifth juggling duties between Invercargill, Greymouth and Picton. The two original servery/observation cars were similarly refurbished. The third TranzAlpine/Coastal Pacific and {{the first of the}} two Southerner 11kW power/baggage vans were fitted with newer, more powerful generators (though less powerful than their NIMT counterparts) and the Southerner van had its public viewing module re-enclosed for luggage carriage again. Later that year, when the Bay Express was re-equipped with two of those seven refurbished cars, the original two Bay Express cars were similarly refurbished and permanently allocated to the Southerner.|$|E

The <b>non-air</b> recognition can be for distinguished lifetime achievement in production, management, manufacturing, or technology. The NRHOFSC may also make additional inductions that they deem appropriate and {{in the best interests}} of the National Radio Hall of Fame.|$|E
5000|$|During 1972 the Public Transport Commission {{advised the}} users of <b>non-air</b> coal wagons that {{they planned to}} ban the {{operation}} of these wagons to Port Waratah in the near future. Due {{to the number of}} loading points at the various Coal & Allied operations that would have needed converting as they were designed accept <b>non-air</b> type wagons only, the company decided to build a [...] "Unit Train Loading System" [...] at the Hexham Coal Preparation Plant and load all of the company's export coal through this system. The PTC would still work <b>non-air</b> wagons from East Greta Junction to Hexham, but from Hexham onwards the trains had to consist of air braked wagons.|$|E

50|$|The <b>non-air</b> wagons {{continued}} to be used between East Greta Junction and Hexham, but by 1977 the PTC was planning to change over this traffic to the older BCH type wagons that had been released from the longer distance coal trains with the changeover to occur during Easter 1977. Because of this planned changeover large numbers of <b>non-air</b> wagons were scrapped, however by August 1977 with many <b>non-air</b> wagons scrapped and the promised BCH wagons yet {{to appear on the}} East Greta to Hexham trains, it become necessary for the SMR, RVR and coal preparation plant at Hexham to work Saturdays to ensure that sufficient wagons were returned to the collieries to allow loading to take place on the following Monday. By late October sufficient BCH trains had been made available to eliminate the need for Saturday workings. By early 1978 it was planned to end the use on non-airs on the main line and the last train ran on 8 February 1978. From this date onwards the remaining 1,000 wagons were used on the RVR between Stockrington and Hexham only.|$|E

50|$|At {{the end of}} the 1930s, {{the line}} {{suffered}} a severe reduction in its passenger service owing to the bus competition and also the difficulty in running sufficient coal trains to clear the collieries as, the hoppers all being <b>non-air,</b> much time was occupied in applying and releasing hand brakes en route.|$|E
