5|$|Mother and I agreed, when {{we talked}} about it, that Dad <b>never</b> <b>meant</b> his poem to apply to one {{particular}} tree, or to the trees of any special region. Just any trees or all trees that might be rained on or snowed on, {{and that would be}} suitable nesting places for robins. I guess they'd have to have upward-reaching branches, too, for the line about 'lifting leafy arms to pray.' Rule out weeping willows.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} <b>never</b> <b>meant</b> to {{be a true}} biographical film to Ip Man's life, but to broadly touch on the {{elements}} from his life. Most of the central turns of the plot are there only for the purpose of making a movie more exciting, including the scenes depicting duels between Ip Man and the Japanese, including Consul General Miura Yoshiaki (三浦義秋), as well as Ip Man encountering hardship during the Second Sino-Japanese War.|$|E
5|$|I went to New York {{and we were}} in {{the studio}} and came to a break. I was sitting at the piano and told Mariah about this movie. Within two hours, we had this {{incredible}} seed for this song, 'Hero'. It was <b>never</b> <b>meant</b> for Mariah to sing. In her mind, we were writing a song for Gloria Estefan for this movie. And we went into an area that Mariah didn't really go into-in her words, {{it was a little bit}} too schmaltzy or too ballady or too old-fashioned as far as melody and lyrics.|$|E

5|$|It {{may be that}} in {{the mind}} of their self-celebrated Svengali...the Sex Pistols were <b>never</b> <b>meant</b> {{to be more than a}} nine-month wonder, a cheap vehicle for some fast money, a few laughs, a touch of the old épater la bourgeoisie. It may also be that {{in the mind of}} their chief {{terrorist}} and propagandist, anarchist veteran...and Situational artist McLaren, the Sex Pistols were meant to be a force that would set the world on its ear...and finally unite music and politics. The Sex Pistols were all of these things.|$|E
5|$|Presently Alcibiades {{sailed to}} Tissaphernes with a {{detachment}} of ships. According to Plutarch, the supposed {{purpose of this}} mission was to stop the Persian fleet from coming {{to the aid of}} the Peloponnesians. Thucydides is in agreement with Plutarch that the Persian fleet was at Aspendus and that Alcibiades told the troops he would bring the fleet to their side or prevent it from coming at all, but Thucydides further speculates that the real reason was to flaunt his new position to Tissaphernes and try to gain some real influence over him. According to the historian, Alcibiades had long known that Tissaphernes <b>never</b> <b>meant</b> to bring the fleet at all.|$|E
5|$|Smith {{replied that}} in his {{interpretation}} Rhodesia was required to keep Whitehall informed, but prior British concurrence was not necessary; if Britain contested this, the Prime Minister said, then surely the 1957 entrustment had <b>never</b> <b>meant</b> anything. Dupont then spoke again, rejecting {{the idea that the}} Rhodesian mission should be a mere subsidiary consulate of the British Embassy. Hughes replied firmly that the 1957 despatch did not give the Rhodesians free rein over external matters, and warned them to be more flexible if they intended to find common ground. Eager to avoid open confrontation, Smith told Dupont to reconsider his tone, and changed the subject.|$|E

5|$|En {{route to}} Isabella, Clear {{and the other}} realize {{that all of them}} are still alive due to the Flight 180 {{survivors}} having gotten off the plane. While driving to the hospital, they are involved in a car accident that leaves Eugene needing medical help and eventually leads to the deaths of Kat and Rory. Following their deaths, Clear, Kimberly and Thomas go to the hospital to save Isabella. While they do succeed in finding her in time and ensuring her infant survives, Kimberly has another premonition that reveals to her Isabella was <b>never</b> <b>meant</b> to die in the pileup, meaning they're still in danger. Understanding the situation, Clear tries to find Eugene's room. Finding him contained by an oxygenated room, she opens the door, subsequently loosening the plug of Eugene's defibrillator, creating a spark that incinerates Eugene's room, burning her and Eugene.|$|E
5|$|Peter {{brings the}} fat men {{back to his}} home to protect them, but after {{learning}} from Brian that Patrick is the killer, a chase between the fat men and Patrick ensues. Brian, still at the house, shows Patrick's room to Lois, where several of his victims are either deceased or had been left for dead, and photographic evidence of Patrick killing them. Lois continues to make crazy excuses, still wanting to believe her brother is a sane person, but ultimately she snaps out of her denial and realizes that Patrick is dangerous. Lois and Brian pursue Patrick and Peter into the woods, where Patrick is strangling Peter. Patrick quickly releases Peter after Lois threatens to stab Marion, his imaginary wife. Patrick apologizes, telling Lois that he <b>never</b> <b>meant</b> to hurt her, and the two agree he should be sent back to the mental hospital, where Lois and the family plan to visit him once a month.|$|E
5|$|Senators Organa, Mon Mothma, and Garm Bel Iblis meet on Corellia {{to plan a}} {{rebellion}} against the Empire, but are interrupted when Darth Vader arrives and arrests them and Kota. Vader attacks Starkiller and reveals that he was <b>never</b> <b>meant</b> to overthrow the Emperor; from the beginning, he was the Emperor's tool to expose his enemies, and that Vader's plans to overthrow the Emperor did not include Starkiller. Surviving Vader's attack, Starkiller uses the Force to ascertain the senators' and Kota's location: the Death Star. Inside the space station, Starkiller duels Darth Vader and manages to defeat his former master. As the Emperor goads Starkiller into killing Vader, Kota attempts to fight the Emperor, but is incapacitated by the Emperor's Force lightning.|$|E

5|$|Martin {{was fired}} from the band later that year due to musical differences, via a fax from {{keyboard}} player Roddy Bottum; and Mr. Bungle guitarist Trey Spruance {{was brought in to}} record their next album. However, Spruance left the band before the subsequent tour, and was replaced by the band's keyboard roadie, Dean Menta. Reasons given for the change differ—the band claim Spruance was unwilling to commit to a long touring schedule in support of the album, whilst Spruance claims he was <b>never</b> <b>meant</b> to be a permanent member in the first place. Roddy Bottum also claims to have been mostly absent during this period, owing to the deaths of his father and Kurt Cobain, whose wife Courtney Love was a close friend of his and one of the temporary lead singers of the band before Chuck Mosely joined. Bottum's absence led to the album being written largely without keyboards. Around the recording of the album in 1994, Mike Patton also got married to Italian woman Cristina Zuccatosta.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{returns to}} the present day. Margaret prepares some orange juice and {{paracetamol}} for Glynis's migraine. She finds a scrap book of press cuttings surrounding Victor's death in Glynis's kitchen drawer and realises that her new friend is responsible for his demise. As ominous music plays, Margaret thoughtfully looks at the box of paracetamol. She drops some tablets into the glass {{and hands it to}} Glynis, who realises that her secret has been uncovered. Glynis explains that the night she was driving she had been told that her husband was close to death and wasn't concentrating on the road properly. As a result, she didn't realise she was about to hit Victor {{until it was too late}} and had stopped, but left when she saw Margaret arrive. She also tells Margaret how sorry she is and how she <b>never</b> <b>meant</b> to hurt anyone, seeking Margaret out in order to try and help her get over Victor's death. Margaret watches her drink some of the orange juice before leaving the house and driving away, with it never being revealed if she'd followed through with her promise to kill the person responsible for Victor's demise.|$|E
25|$|Although he is {{best known}} for his oil paintings, Hopper {{initially}} achieved recognition for his watercolors and he also produced some commercially successful etchings.

25|$|Zille later apologized {{and said}} she was “very, very sorry about the impact of those words”. She was “sorry because it was <b>never</b> <b>meant</b> in that context at all, and it was never said in that way at all. She said “What I was trying to show up was what (Basic) Education Minister Angie Motshekga calls a ‘horror story’ of {{education}} in much of the Eastern Cape”.|$|E
25|$|The works {{employ a}} stream of {{consciousness}} narrative style, and some critics believe that Picasso <b>never</b> <b>meant</b> for the plays to be staged, only read. Desire Caught by the Tail was first performed as a reading. Jean-Paul Sartre, Valentine Hugo and Simone de Beauvoir starred alongside Picasso, while Albert Camus directed. It was restaged in 1984 (with David Hockney acting) by the Guggenheim Museum.|$|E
25|$|The crown {{is wrong}} in the Queen's {{portrait}}. When the new coin portrait was first issued in 1990 (see above), a legend surfaced that the artist had simply added {{the image of a}} crown to a portrait of the Queen, and that she was <b>never</b> <b>meant</b> to be seen wearing that headgear. This is patently false; she posed personally for the portrait wearing one of her usual crowns.|$|E

5000|$|The first part, {{published}} after Mickiewicz's emigration to France, {{was probably}} {{written in the}} early 20s, though <b>never</b> finished. <b>Meant</b> to be a picture of [...] "emotion of the 19th century people", it was immediately given up by the author. It shows a young girl and boy, feeling confused with and trying {{to choose between the}} sentimental idea of love, adjustment to the society and respect to own nature.|$|R

25|$|Because the h-index was <b>never</b> <b>meant</b> {{to measure}} future {{publication}} success, recently, {{a group of}} researchers has investigated the features that are most predictive of future h-index. It is possible to try the predictions using an online tool. However, later work has shown that since h-index is a cumulative measure, it contains intrinsic auto-correlation that led to significant overestimation of its predictability. Thus, the true predictability of future h-index is much lower compared {{to what has been}} claimed before.|$|E
25|$|Khan later {{clarified}} {{his comments}} in January 2016, {{saying that he}} <b>never</b> <b>meant</b> that India was intolerant or he thought about leaving the country. He said that his comments were {{taken out of context}} and the media was responsible for it to some extent. Despite this, he continued to face backlash later in the year, with calls for protests and boycotts against his film Dangal. In October 2016, the Vishva Hindu Parishad called for protests against the film. Following its release in December 2016, #BoycottDangal was trending on Twitter, and BJP general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya called for protests against the film.|$|E
25|$|This {{legislation}} {{received more}} Congressional opposition than the 1982 amendments did, {{most of it}} from Republicans. Proponents argued {{that the lack of}} bilingual assistance hindered recently naturalized citizens from exercising their voting rights and that the country had a history of acceptance toward linguistic pluralism. Opponents argued that the Voting Rights Act was <b>never</b> <b>meant</b> to protect language minorities and that the bilingual assistance provision was a costly unfunded mandate. Opponents proposed several amendments to weaken the legislation, including limiting the extension to 5 years, requiring the federal government to pay for the bilingual voting materials, and completely removing the bilingual provisions. These amendments failed, and Congress passed the legislation with mostly Democratic support; the House passed it by a 237-125 vote, and the Senate passed it by a 75-20 vote. President George H. W. Bush signed the legislation on August 26, 1992.|$|E
