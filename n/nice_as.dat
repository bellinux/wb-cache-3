5|$|Euskaltel-Euskadi has {{in their}} history been reticent to ride the Giro d'Italia, favoring the Tour de France and the Vuelta a España instead. After first {{indicating}} a reluctant willingness to participate as per the requirements of holding a ProTeam license, the team later stated that they intended to seek overall victory in the race with Antón. Antón was named {{as the leader of}} the squad, which included Nieve, Oroz, Isasi, Aramendía, Azanza, Cazaux, Sesma and Minguez to ride in support. Antón tempered the expectations somewhat, saying that a stage win would be <b>nice,</b> <b>as</b> would General Classification success should it come, but that he was only banking on riding for the overall at the Vuelta a España.|$|E

25|$|In {{the case}} of {{conflict}} resolution, the tit-for-tat strategy is effective for several reasons: the technique is recognized as clear, nice, provocable, and forgiving. Firstly, It is a clear and recognizable strategy. Those using it quickly recognize its contingencies and adjust their behavior accordingly. Moreover, it {{is considered to be}} <b>nice</b> <b>as</b> it begins with cooperation and only defects in following competitive move. The strategy is also provocable because it provides immediate retaliation for those who compete. Finally, it is forgiving as it immediately produces cooperation should the competitor make a cooperative move.|$|E
25|$|In 1998, {{burned out}} from the hectic pace, Iuzzini took {{a break from the}} kitchen to travel the world. He visited Hong Kong, Australia and Italy. In France he studied pastry {{technique}} while staging at several of the country's finest patisseries including Ladurée in Paris, École du Grand Chocolat et Patisserie in Tain l’Hermitage, and Patisserie Chereau in <b>Nice,</b> <b>as</b> well as the Hotel Paris in Monte Carlo. After eight months around the world, he returned to New York to work for chef/owner Daniel Boulud, opening Café Boulud and the new Daniel as Executive Sous Chef. In 2001 Boulud promoted the 26-year-old Iuzzini to Executive Pastry Chef.|$|E
25|$|There are notable {{differences}} between the various LM-1 revisions. The Rev. 1 LM-1 is recognizable by its engraved buttons and lack of Shuffle and Auto-Correct LEDs. The drum buttons were engraved with a small symbol of the drum it represented (the bass drum button had a small engraving of a bass drum on it). These buttons were later discontinued {{because they were too}} expensive to manufacture. Internally it was different as well. It had single chips for the kick, tom, and conga sounds, and double chips for the clap. The Rev. 1 LM-1's did not have the filter on the kick, toms, and congas that Rev. 2 and later machines had. As a result, it didn't sound as <b>nice</b> <b>as</b> the Rev. 2 and later machines, but the toms and congas could be played simultaneously.|$|E

500|$|The war {{arose from}} {{the failure of the}} Truce of Nice, which ended the Italian War of 1536–38, to resolve the long-standing {{conflict}} between Charles and Francis—particularly their conflicting claims to the Duchy of Milan. [...] Having found a suitable pretext, Francis once again declared war against his perpetual enemy in 1542. [...] Fighting began at once throughout the Low Countries; the following year saw the Franco-Ottoman alliance's attack on <b>Nice,</b> <b>as</b> well as a series of maneuvers in northern Italy which culminated in the bloody Battle of Ceresole. [...] Charles and Henry then proceeded to invade France, but the long sieges of Boulogne-sur-Mer and Saint-Dizier prevented a decisive offensive against the French.|$|E

500|$|The {{soundtrack of}} the game was less well received. Critics panned the music as [...] "easily the worst Castlevania soundtrack" [...] and [...] "muddy, plodding, and {{reminiscent}} of the days of four-channel NES soundtracks". Conversely, GameSpot found that the music was [...] "decent" [...] and occasionally [...] "fitting or even catchy", but {{failed to live up}} to the high expectations of the series. IGN felt that while not [...] "quite as bad as importers have made it out to be", the songs [...] "aren't nearly as <b>nice</b> <b>as</b> they have been in past Castlevania adventures." [...] Reviewers also disliked the lack of difficulty with GamePro describing it as the game's [...] "biggest flaw". Other criticism included predictable and easy boss battles, and [...] "a much smaller explorable area and somewhat less compelling map design".|$|E
500|$|As a stop-gap measure, the {{fortified}} vaults in {{the basement}} of the United States Treasury Building were converted into living quarters for the president and his family, to be used in the event an attack came prior to the bunker's completion. Unlike the White House, which was a fragile structure with what was then a shallow basement, the Treasury Building has a deep basement built into a foundation of granite and its vaults are nested into stone. The ten-room presidential suite sat two floors below the cash room behind a steel bank door and was described as [...] "every bit as <b>nice</b> <b>as</b> a suite at the Mayflower Hotel". The tunnel, connecting the White House to the open areaway of the Treasury Building, was excavated to allow the evacuation of the president from one building to the other without the need to make the crossing outdoors.|$|E
500|$|The {{penultimate}} {{stage of}} the race was also its longest of the 2013 edition, with a [...] itinerary for the peloton as the race moved towards the coast and Nice itself. There were five categorised climbs on the route, {{the first of which}} commenced just after the [...] point of the stage, with the third-category Côte du Bois de Rousset climb, an ascent of [...] and a 4.5% average gradient. The tougher climbs came {{in the second half of}} the stage, with a pair of first-category climbs– the Côte de Cabris, [...] at 5.8% and the Col du Ferrier, [...] at 6.8%– but with the summit of the Col du Ferrier still being over [...] from the finish, on the Promenade des Anglais in <b>Nice.</b> <b>As</b> a result, it was still expected to come down to a sprint finish at the end, but the severity of the climbs was certain to rule out many of the pure sprinters from the finish.|$|E

[...] In a 2006 article in USA Today, [...] "Dumbbell Indemnity" [...] was highlighted among the six best episodes of The Simpsons season 9, along with [...] "Trash of the Titans", [...] "The Last Temptation of Krust", [...] "The Cartridge Family", [...] "The Joy of Sect", and [...] "Das Bus". IGN ranked Hail to the Chimp, the film Homer goes to see in the episode, as the seventh best fictional film within another work.

2500|$|Computerized {{cognitive}} behavioral therapy (CCBT) {{has been}} described by <b>NICE</b> <b>as</b> a [...] "generic term for delivering CBT via an interactive computer interface delivered by a personal computer, internet, or interactive voice response system", instead of face-to-face with a human therapist. It is also known as internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy or ICBT. CCBT has potential to improve access to evidence-based therapies, and to overcome the prohibitive costs and lack of availability sometimes associated with retaining a human therapist. In this context, {{it is important not to}} confuse CBT with 'computer-based training', which nowadays is more commonly referred to as e-Learning.|$|E
