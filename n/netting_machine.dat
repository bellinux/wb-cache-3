50|$|The Princess lace is also {{a needle}} work. It's an {{application}} on a <b>netting.</b> <b>Machine</b> made nettings are used since 1850 {{in the production of}} lace. These first nettings were produced in the hope it could save time and that lacemakers could be able to finish a work faster. In the early 20th century the machine made netting that could be produced were from a different quality, more regular, bigger quantities. The production of Princess lace started at that time, but it was after world war II that this lace really became famous. It's the last handmade lace work that's still fine enough to be used for wedding veil and christening gowns.As these 2 types of laces are using a machine made base (the tape or the netting) some purists don't accept these techniques received the 'Handmade Belgian lace' tag. Discussions are not closed about this. Only thing everybody agrees : these 2 modern technics of lace making asks a lot of handwork (80%) to be realized, they're art works and it's unfortunately a dying art.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The {{researches}} {{have shown}} that not all the Petri <b>Net</b> <b>machines</b> {{can be used to}} describe attack behavior. When Petri <b>Net</b> <b>machines</b> adapted for attack behavior modeling are detecting the network, for some event of current status, if there is matching event in the model, it has only one corresponding transition; otherwise that may cause errors. Since sharing synthesis and synchronization synthesis of traditional machines cannot ensure synthetic model reserves original detection capability, we propose the novel concept for synthesis operation and colored synthetic operation. By the analysis on the relation among these operations, the ability to reserve original detection is verified. Then an improved colored judgement Petri <b>Net</b> <b>machine</b> is adopted for modeling and renewing the knowledge repository. The inductive learning method is used to extend the attack modes. It creates a four-layered concept space, which actually provides a depth-first search path for matching. To solve the problems in multi-pattern matching and incremental learning, various modes are generalized by colored operation. We also adopt the decomposition and synthesis operation to handle the pattern matching of distributed attack behavior and attack information fusion. Finally the actual cases verify that our algorithm is feasible...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe growing {{importance}} of cooperation among organizations, {{as a result}} of globalization, current market opportunities and technological advances, encourages organizations to dynamically establish inter-organizational collaborations. These collaborations are carried out by executing collaborative business processes among the organizations. In this work we propose an agent-based software architecture for managing inter-organizational collaborations. Two types of agents are provided: the Collaboration Administrator Agent and the Process Administrator Agent. The former allows organizations setting up collaborations. The latter allows organizations executing collaborative business processes. A Colored Petri Net model specifying the role, which an organization fulfills in a collaborative process, is used to carry out the behavior of the Process Administrator Agent that represents the organization. Planning and execution of the actions of the Process Administrator Agents are driven by a Colored Petri <b>Net</b> <b>machine</b> embedded to them. Thus, Process Administrator Agents do not require to have defined at design-time the protocols they can support. In addition, we propose a model-driven development method for generating Colored Petri Net models from a collaborative process model defined as interaction protocol. Finally, an implementation of the agent-based software architecture and methods based on model-driven development are presented...|$|R

40|$|In telecooperating systems, it {{is often}} {{necessary}} to ensure authenticity and confidentiality between different pairs of principals (people, computers, services, smart cards, cellular phones). A common way to approach this problem is by using authentication protocols, using encryption and digital signatures. Although the encryption algorithms are good enough to prevent unauthorised decryption, {{it is often}} possible to attack protocols. The fundamental problem protocol designers {{have to deal with}} is the presence of a hostile opponent, who can control the complete communication between principals. For example, messages of ancient protocol runs can be repeated or parallel runs can be started, with exchange of messages between different runs. Also principals can be used as oracle to answer their own challenges. Since the variety of possible ways to attack protocols is enormous, formal methods are necessary to examine whether a protocol meets its security goals. This research work aims at supporting the verification of cryptographic protocols by applying formal methods used in the verification of distributed systems. The tool used for this purpose is the Product <b>Net</b> <b>Machine</b> (PNM), a tool developed by GMD - German National Research Center for Information Technology GmbH. Due to the complexity of the problem, it is useful to start with a restricted computational model which then can be be extended in a stepwise fashion {{in order to get a}} powerful method. In our research we use the restrictions used by Burrows, Abadi and Needham for their logic of authentication known as BAN logic [4]. Two different approaches to use product nets for the analysis of cryptographic protocols are presented. One approach is based on a product net model of a possible attacker. The second approach is the implementation of an automated "bottom-up" proof method for BAN-Logic...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} a novel connectionist machine utilizing induction by a Hilbert hypercube representation. This representation offers {{a number of}} distinct advantages which are described. We construct a theoretical and practical learning machine which lies {{in an area of}} overlap between three disciplines - neural <b>nets,</b> <b>machine</b> learning and knowledge acquisition - hence it is refered to as a "coalesced" machine. To this unifying aspect is added the various advantages of its orthogonal lattice structure as against less structured nets. We discuss the case for such a fundamental and low level empirical learning tool and the assumptions behind the machine are clearly outlined. Our theory of an orthogonal lattice structure the Hilbert hypercube of an n-dimensional space using a complemented distributed lattice as a basis for supervised learning is derived from first principles on clearly laid out scientific principles. The resulting "subhypercube theory" was implemented in a development machine which was then used to test the theoretical predictions again under strict scientific guidelines. The scope, advantages and limitations of this machine were tested in a series of experiments. Novel and seminal properties of the machine include: the "metrical", deterministic and global nature of its search; complete convergence invariably producing minimum polynomial solutions for both disjuncts and conjuncts even with moderate levels of noise present; a learning engine which is mathematically analysable in depth based upon the "complexity range" of the function concerned; a strong bias towards the simplest possible globally (rather than locally) derived "balanced" explanation of the data; the ability to cope with variables in the network; and new ways of reducing the exponential explosion.
