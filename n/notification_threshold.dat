40|$|Surveillance for {{gonorrhoea}} {{antimicrobial resistance}} (AMR) is compromised by a {{move away from}} culture-based testing in favour of more convenient nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) tests. We assessed the potential benefit of a molecular resistance test {{in terms of the}} timeliness of detection of gonorrhoea AMR. An individual-based mathematical model was developed to describe the transmission of gonorrhoea in a remote Indigenous population in Australia. We estimated the impact of the molecular test on the time delay between first importation and the first confirmation that the prevalence of gonorrhoea AMR (resistance proportion) has breached the WHO-recommended 5 % threshold (when a change in antibiotic should occur). In the remote setting evaluated in this study, the model predicts that when culture is the only available means of testing for AMR, the breach will only be detected when the actual prevalence of AMR in the population has already reached 8 - 18 %, with an associated delay of ~ 43 - 69 months between first importation and detection. With the addition of a molecular resistance test, the number of samples for which AMR can be determined increases facilitating earlier detection at a lower resistance proportion. For the best case scenario, where AMR can be determined for all diagnostic samples, the alert would be triggered at least 8 months earlier than using culture alone and the resistance proportion will have only slightly exceeded the 5 % <b>notification</b> <b>threshold.</b> Molecular tests have the potential to provide more timely warning of the emergence of gonorrhoea AMR. This in turn will facilitate earlier treatment switching and more targeted treatment, which has the potential to reduce the population impact of gonorrhoea AMR...|$|E

40|$|The {{market for}} {{corporate}} control {{plays an important}} role in ensuring that assets are deployed in an efficient and effective manner. However, on occasion, mergers might lead to a reduction in competition and a consequent rise in prices and/or other anticompetitive effects. The Competition Act 2002 provides that all mergers that meet certain financial thresholds must be notified to the Competition Authority in order that they are subject to a competitive effects assessment. However, there are concerns that the <b>notification</b> <b>thresholds</b> result in many mergers with little or no nexus to Ireland being notified. While it is the case that the vast majority of merger notifications do not raise competition concerns, Ireland is not out of line with other jurisdictions which have mandatory <b>notification</b> <b>thresholds</b> such as the EU and the US. Nevertheless, that should not lead to complacency. The paper quantifies the impact of reforms made in 2006 and 2007 by the Competition Authority and the Minister of Enterprise, Trade and Employment to the merger <b>notification</b> <b>thresholds.</b> The evidence suggests that these tighter better specified thresholds led to a reduction of at least 40 - 50 per cent in the number of merger notifications. However, more could be done, albeit probably to a lesser extent than the earlier reforms. Applying the International Competition Network 2 ̆ 7 s Recommended Practices for Merger Notification Procedures, a series of proposals are made in the paper for revising the merger <b>notification</b> <b>thresholds</b> to better select mergers with a nexus to Ireland. Such moves should facilitate a more effective and efficient market for merger control by reducing transaction costs involved in the merger process as well as allowing Competition Authority resources to be deployed elsewhere, a not inconsiderable advantage in a period of austerity...|$|R

40|$|There’s {{one area}} where the free trade {{agreement}} could make a big difference, argues John Edwards BECAUSE Australian and US manufacturing tariffs are already very low and because the US concessions in agriculture are limited, I doubt {{the free trade agreement}} between Australia and the US announced last week will have much more than a marginal impact on Australian trade with the US, let alone on economic growth. It is a useful agreement but both its opponents and supporters have wildly exaggerated its significance. It should over time be somewhat easier for Australian firms to compete in the US services markets and new access to the US government procurement market will be helpful, but nothing in the agreement on goods and services will validate Prime Minister John Howard’s claim that it will set Australia up for the next half century. There is, however, {{one area where}} the agreement will make a difference, and that is in the liberalisation of Australia’s foreign investment regime. It is true that Australia has continued to reserve urban land, air transport, telecommunications, defence and media from the new rules, and that it will maintain existing foreign ownership restrictions for Telstra, Qantas, CSL and airports. It is also true that even under the agreement the Australian Treasurer retains the right to reject on national interest grounds proposed takeovers of Australian firms by US firms, although the threshold at which a bid needs to be notified to the Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB) has been increased from $ 50 m to $ 800 m. And finally it is true that of 4747 foreign investment applications made to FIRB last financial year, only 79 or 2 per cent were rejected, a rate which suggests the FIRB constraint was not binding. All that said, the changes are much more sweeping than has been generally understood. Once the agreement comes into force, there will be no requirement to notify FIRB of any US investment in Australia which does not involve the takeover of any existing company. Currently any such investment of over $ 10 million needs to be notified, which means it is potentially subject to the Treasurer’s power to determine if it is in the national interest. It does not mean the usually environmental or other policies would not apply, but it does mean the proposed US investment would be treated exactly like a proposed Australian investment. While the Treasurer retains the right to reject takeover proposals from US interests for Australian companies, the increase in the <b>notification</b> <b>threshold</b> from $ 50 million to $ 800 million makes a big difference. Most major Australian companies have a market capitalisation considerably greater than $ 800 million. But there are 1400 listed companies on the ASX, and once the top 100 are excluded the average market of the remainder is $ 70 million. This is above the existing threshold, but nowhere near the new threshold. US companies will now be able to make offers for the great majority of Australian listed companies without needing to notify the FIRB. It has been rightly the FIRB approves nearly every application made to it. But of those approved last year, three-quarters were approved only with conditions. For takeovers of industrial companies these conditions may include requirements for a local board, a local CEO, or for commitments to R&D or manufacturing facilities. Under the new rules there will be no conditions for bids under $ 800 m, and no notification will be required. And while a takeover above that threshold requires approval, the acquisition of a blocking sake against other predators may not. Under Australian law an interest can acquire 19 per cent of a listed company before being required to make an offer for the remainder. Under the proposed FTA rules, a US company would presumably acquire 19 per cent of a $ 3. 2 billion company without being required to notify FIRB. Since FIRB notification automatically involves the disclosure to the targeted company of the predators intention, the new rules will be considerably more convenient for predators. When the new rules are operating they will be extremely discriminatory, since they apply only to US firms. When an Australian target is defending against a foreign predator it is quite common to make the case to FIRB that the offer is against the national interest. The target knows the case will be rejected, but it also knows it will achieve a delay which allows it to construct a more effective defence. Under the new rules the US firm will not face this impediment. But if the Australian firm seeks a white knight which happens to be British or New Zealand or German or Japanese, the white knight will be compelled to go through the FIRB processes. It seems to me this is not a sustainable position. It is all the more delicate because Australia already has understandings with New Zealand and with Japan that those countries will enjoy the most favourable investment rules into Australia which apply to any other country. It is highly likely therefore that within a few years the newly liberal rules will apply to all intending investors, and the role of FIRB will be whittled down to very large transactions, and those sectors which continue to be reserved. There is even a possibility that the Treasurer’s discretionary authority to refuse takeovers on national interest grounds will be exposed to some public review, which is not the case today.

The value of the threshold for the aggregate turnover has been obtained by benchmarking the rules set in the EU Member States through a simple econometric exercise. The value of the threshold for the individual turnover is then calculated applying the theoretical framework and the estimated costs of Type I and Type II errors...|$|R
40|$|Daily within-flock {{mortality}} data, from a {{few days}} before until a few days after onset of increased mortality, from H 7 N 7 -infected flocks were analyzed with nonlinear regression for layer (organic and free-range or caged), broiler, and turkey flocks. The following <b>notification</b> <b>thresholds</b> were recommended for the Netherlands: 1) organic layer flocks, broiler flocks, and turkey flocks 11 wk of age: 0. 5 % mortality/day for two consecutive days; 2) layer flocks with birds housed in cages: 0. 25 % mortality/day for two consecutive days; 3) turkey flocks 16 wk of age: 1 % mortality/day for two consecutive days. Notification of increased mortality to the veterinary authorities should take place {{on the second day of}} increased mortality. Interpretation of mortality thresholds should be on the level of the poultry barn in which clinical problems arise.

40|$|China {{is among}} the most recent {{entrants}} into global competition enforcement, having adopted the first competition law of general application, the Anti-Monopoly Law (AML) {{after more than a decade}} of drafting. The AML and Merger <b>Notification</b> <b>Thresholds,</b> rules issued by decree of the State Council, became effective on August 3, 2008. Both the law and the guidelines were subject to public review and comment, and went through a number of drafts before final adoption. This article is a comprehensive comparison of merger standards across jurisdictions, with particular focus on the evolution of merger regulation in China. It comprises six parts; after an introduction, part two analyzes the AML with respect to mergers, part three examines predecessor pre-merger notification guidelines for foreign acquisitions and the 2 ̆ 2 legislative history 2 ̆ 2 of the AML pre-merger <b>notification</b> <b>thresholds,</b> which went through successive drafts and significant amendments between March and August, 2008. Part four addresses international benchmarking, raises unanswered questions and issues, and part five concludes. A variety of international organizations advocate strong national competition policy and use the substance and deployment of national antitrust law to evaluate a jurisdiction 2 ̆ 7 s economic regulation. With the adoption of the AML, China joined a growing number of states that have adopted comprehensive competition laws, but the test of the AML will be in its application. The challenges facing new enforcement agencies are vast: organizational, establishing enforcement procedures that comport with the existing Chinese legal system, allocating appropriate functions to three entities and coordinating process and substance, and, finally, establishing policies and priorities. Given the choice of where to begin enforcement, an agency should weigh the destructiveness of the restraint, importance and ability to enforce, and its own proficiency or readiness to enforce the particular category of violations. China chose to promulgate its first set of AML Guidelines on the subject of pre-merger notification. In a different system, pre-merger notification and enforcement may not be an obvious first step for a new competition agency implementing a new antitrust law. On the one hand, since the AML itself requires pre-merger notification but does not provide sufficient information to comply, Guidelines are needed. On the other hand, the relevant enforcement agency could have paced its enforcement of mergers. In addition, the enforcement mechanism in China will involve three different government ministries, each responsible for enforcing different segments of the AML. The SAIC, the State Administration of Industry and Commerce, will be responsible for enforcing the provisions against abuse of dominant positions, the NDRC, National Development and Reform Commission, will be entrusted with anti-cartel enforcement, and MOFCOM, the Ministry of Commerce, will have jurisdiction over the merger review provisions of the AML. The organizational structure of three entities with separate responsibilities under the AML may complicate the priority-setting process and set up incentives for maximum activity by each as it competes for position. Additionally, given China 2 ̆ 7 s rapid economic growth and pace of mergers, including foreign investments, there may have been a felt need to assert enforcement power in this arena early. MOFCOM has already begun to issue additional draft Guidelines and review proposed mergers. Emerging from a lengthy drafting process, the operative agencies appear to be moving with alacrity. Going forward, clarity, transparency and predictability would be recommended in the refinement of the notification procedures and promulgation of substantive merger standards. The AML is indeterminate and judicial interpretation is unavailable, so a clear articulation of the appropriate methodology and controlling legal standard is an unfinished project. Retrospectively, the experience of the AML and Guideline process has revealed notable receptivity to international commentary on the substance and procedures of merger review. The now-adopted Notification Guidelines went through several public drafts and comments were affirmatively solicited from 2 ̆ 2 all sectors of society 2 ̆ 2 including domestic and foreign scholars and lawyers. Viewing the various official drafts and public comments suggests that some of the recommendations were taken on board. Additionally, the solicitation itself refers to the consensus-based international benchmarks of the ICN and asserts consistency with international standards. The application of the AML, Notification Guidelines and additional Guidelines continues to be a work in progress...|$|R

40|$|Air quality, {{especially}} in urban areas, deteriorated with {{the industrial revolution}} and the following centuries. It is only during the last 60 years, following e. g. the infamous London smog (1952), that the health impacts of air pollution have been recognised and acted upon. In the developed world, abatement strategies and closure of major industries have led to significant air quality improvements (Harrison, 2004; Lamarque et al., 2010; Monks et al., 2009; Smith et al., 2011). Even so, the evaluation of current research within the Clean Air for Europe (CAFE) process has clearly shown that, even today, investments in further air quality improvements will have a beneficial return financially, in terms of population health, environmental improvements and in quality of life (EEA, 2007; Stern, 2006). The measurement of air quality changed dramatically during the last century reflecting the concurrent knowledge about the adverse effects of air pollution, {{as well as the}} technological developments. The earliest measurement methods were often labour intensive, needed long analysis times and had a low time resolution. Routine measurements of air quality {{can be traced back to}} the Montsouris Manuscript Click here to download Manuscript: AMT_AtmosEnv_NewDirection_ 19 _ 09 _ 2013. docx Click here to view linked References 2 Observatory in Paris, where ozone was measured between 1876 and 1910 (Volz and Kley, 1988). Since then, scientists have pursued the concept of making measurements of air pollutants at fixed monitoring sites using well established, calibrated and comparable methods. Developments in air quality monitoring techniques during the second half of the 20 th century enabled higher data quality to be obtained, with lower detection limits, using automated, continuous methods. One of the first real-time measurement techniques was initially developed by Fowler as early as 1949 for the measurement of e. g. CO 2 (Keeling, 1960). Developments in online air quality monitoring enabled the development of public warning systems and immediate <b>notifications</b> if alert <b>thresholds</b> were exceeded. Short-term measures could then be taken to reduce emissions during pollution episodes. Measures included traffic reductions and closure of industrial facilities during e. g. winter smog episodes in Germany in the early 80 ’s (Bruckmann et al., 1986). Such reactive measures are now commonplace in new legislation (EC Directive, 2008; CFR 40, 2011; JAPC, 2011), along with public information to help vulnerable people to cope with pollution episodes (Kelly et al., 2012).
