40|$|Barrier fences {{have been}} used to control animal and human depredations since ancient times. They have exerted {{considerable}} influence upon the culture of the 2 ̆ 2 protected 2 ̆ 2 areas even though protection was rarely complete. The following materials {{have been used}} in construction of fences: earth, vegetative materials, wire, electric shock, and synthetic materials. Fence designs must consider the size, strength, intelligence and/or instinct, and physical agility of the species to be repelled as well as the attraction of the crop or area for potential depredators. Against deer, the 8 -foot upright, vertical overhanging, outrigger and sloping fences are more successful than electric fences. The larger predators are difficult to control with fencing. <b>Net</b> <b>wire</b> fencing of 1 / 2 -inch mesh is needed to keep all small predators out of the poultry yard. An L-shaped poultry netting fence topped with a hot wire has been found generally successful in protecting field crops against both carnivores and rodents. Lagomorphs can be contained with fences 30 to 36 inches high, but must be buried at least 6 inches underground to prevent digging under...|$|E
40|$|Fish {{cage culture}} is a rapid aquacultural {{practice}} of producing fish with more yield compared to traditional pond culture. Several species cultured by this method include Cyprinus carpio, Orechromis niloticus, Sarotherodon galilaeus, Tilapia zilli, Clarias lazera, C. gariepinus, Heterobranchus bidorsalis, Citharinus citharus, Distochodus rostratus and Alestes dentes. However, the culture of fish in cages has some problems that are due to mechanical defects of the cage or diseases due to infection. The mechanical problems which may lead to clogged net, toxicity and easy access by predators depend on defects associated with various types of nets which include fold sieve cloth <b>net,</b> <b>wire</b> net, polypropylene net, nylon, galvanized and welded net. The diseases problems are of two types namely introduced diseases due to parasites. The introduced parasites include Crustaseans, Ergasilus sp. Argulus africana, and Lamprolegna sp, Helminth, Diplostomulum tregnna: Protozoan, Trichodina sp, Myxosoma sp, Myxobolus sp. the second disease problems are inherent diseases aggravated by the very rich nutrient environment in cages for rapid bacterial, saprophytic fungi, and phytoplanktonic bloom resulting in clogging of net, stagnation of water and low biological oxygen demand (BOD). The consequence is fish kill, prevalence of gill rot and dropsy conditions. Recommendations on routine cage hygiene, diagnosis and control procedures to reduce fish mortality are highlighte...|$|E
40|$|The uptake and/or release {{rates of}} carbon (C), {{nitrogen}} (N), phosphorus (P) and sulphur (S) during Ulva rigida growth and/or decomposition were determined {{in two different}} nutrient-enriched areas of the Venice lagoon. The field investigation included 20 experiments subdivided in four different seasonal periods. Experiments were carried out by suspending 150 g fw of Ulva biomass in 12 <b>net</b> <b>wire</b> cages, 6 fixed at the surface and 6 {{at the bottom of}} each area studied. Weight determinations and collection of samples from the cages for the nutrient tissue analysis were carried out at 4 - 10 day intervals, depending on the season. Temperature, light and the nutrient concentrations in the whole water column {{as well as in the}} surface sediment porewater were also determined. The daily cage and in situ biomass variations (DBVs) were up to 23 % and 137 %, respectively. The rates of biomass production were 2 - 3 times higher in the more nutrient-enriched area and within the cages suspended close to the water surface. The rates of the daily nutrient uptake by Ulva tissue were up to 43 % for P, 19 % for N, 6. 8 % for C and 9. 3 % for S. Significant (P < 0. 01) correlation coefficients between the environmental and tissue nutrient concentrations and the biomass increase and/or decrease were found. However, besides interesting data suggesting a phosphorus (from tissue N:P atomic ratios up to 61 : 1 and P water concentrations < 1 mu mol L(- 1)) or a nitrogen (from critical biomass N concentrations < 20 mg g dw(- 1)) growth limitation, no effective limitations in the biomass production were monitored. These results confirm previous results on the key role of the water renewal by tides and of the nutrient fluxes from the water-sediment interface as the main factors controlling the availability of nutrient elements for the algal growth in the Venice lagoon...|$|E

At high densities, elephants potentially have negative impacts on the environment, specifically to large trees. Because of this, recent increases of elephants in the Associated Private Nature Reserves (APNR) on the Western Boundary of Kruger National Park, South Africa have caused concern regarding the health of several species of tree. My objective {{was to assess the}} effectiveness of wrapping protective <b>wire</b> <b>netting</b> around the trunk of the tree in preventing and reducing bark stripping by elephants. 2, 668 trees, 1352 marula (Sclerocarya birrea), 857 knobthorn (Acacia Nigrescens), and 459 false marula (Lannea schweinfurti), were assessed for elephant impact in the APNR, 1387 (52 %) of which had previously been wrapped in protective <b>wire</b> <b>netting</b> (789, 548, and 50 respectively). For knobthorn and marula, <b>wire</b> <b>netting</b> significantly decreased the number of the trees that were bark stripped. For all trees, <b>wire</b> <b>netting</b> decreased the level of bark stripping especially for the highest impact levels. No trees wrapped with wire were ringbarked, compared to 23 unwired trees. In addition, <b>wire</b> <b>netting</b> had an effect on the distribution of damage for the highest impact class incurred regardless of type. A higher relative frequency of wired trees were found in lower impact categories compared to unwired trees. <b>Wire</b> <b>netting</b> is a low maintenance and ecologically valuable technique that alleviates bark stripping for some species.

At high densities, elephants potentially have negative impacts on the environment, specifically for large trees. Because of this, recent increases of elephants in the Associated Private Nature Reserves (APNR) on the western boundary of the Kruger National Park (KNP), South Africa, have caused concern regarding the survival of several tree species. Our objective {{was to assess the}} effectiveness of wrapping protective <b>wire</b> <b>netting</b> around the trunk of the tree for preventing and reducing bark stripping, branch breaking, and felling by elephants. We assessed 2668 trees – 1352 Sclerocarya birrea (marula), 857 Acacia nigrescens (knobthorn), and 459 Lannea schweinfurthii (false marula) – for elephant impact in the APNR, 1387 (52 %) of which had previously been wrapped in protective <b>wire</b> <b>netting</b> (789, 548 and 50, respectively). <b>Wire</b> <b>netting</b> was effective in reducing the severity of bark stripping and the relative proportion of trees that were bark stripped. In addition, <b>wire</b> <b>netting</b> had an effect on the level of impact, with a higher relative frequency of wire-net-protected trees found in lower impact categories compared with unprotected trees. Since tree mortality has been attributed to high levels of elephant impact, the use of <b>wire</b> <b>netting</b> could serve to maintain individual trees or populations particularly vulnerable to elephant impact in areas with locally high densities of elephants. Conservation implications: Since <b>wire</b> <b>netting</b> is a relatively low cost and ecologically unobtrusive strategy, it could be used to reduce elephant impact in problem areas. This method focuses on protecting trees rather than some other strategies such as environmental manipulation, translocation, contraceptives, and culling that instead focus on reducing elephant numbers.
