500|$|In the mid-1990s, the New Age {{was found}} {{primarily}} in the United States and Canada, Western Europe, and Australia and New Zealand. The fact that most individuals engaging in New Age activity do not describe themselves as [...] "New Agers" [...] renders it difficult {{to determine how many}} practitioners there are. Heelas highlighted the range of attempts to establish the number of New Age participants in the U.S. during this period, noting that estimates ranged from 20,000 to 6 million; he believed that the higher ranges of these estimates were greatly inflated by, for instance, an erroneous assumption that all Americans who believed in reincarnation were part of the movement. He nevertheless suggested that over 10 million people in the U.S. had had some contact with <b>New</b> <b>Age</b> <b>practices</b> or ideas. In 2006, Heelas stated that <b>New</b> <b>Age</b> <b>practices</b> had grown {{to such an extent that}} they were [...] "increasingly rivalling the sway of Christianity in western settings".|$|E
500|$|The {{degree to}} which {{individuals}} {{are involved in the}} New Age varies. Heelas argued that those involved could be divided into three broad groups; the first comprised those who were completely dedicated to it and its ideals, often working in professions that furthered those goals. The second consisted of [...] "serious part-timers" [...] who worked in unrelated fields but who nevertheless spent much of their free time involved in movement activities. The third was that of [...] "casual part-timers" [...] who occasionally involved themselves in New Age activities but for whom the movement was not a central aspect of their life. MacKian instead suggested that involvement could be seen as being layered like an onion; at the core are [...] "consultative" [...] practitioners who devote their life to <b>New</b> <b>Age</b> <b>practices,</b> around that are [...] "serious" [...] practitioners who still invest considerable effort into New Age activities, and on the periphery are [...] "non-practitioner consumers", individuals affected by he general dissemination of New Age ideas but who do not devote themselves more fully to them. Many <b>New</b> <b>Age</b> <b>practices</b> have filtered into wider Western society, with a 2000 poll for instance revealing that 39% of the UK population had tried alternative therapies.|$|E
500|$|In 1989 and 2003, the Vatican issued two documents: Aspects of Christian {{meditation}} and [...] "A Christian {{reflection on the}} New Age," [...] that were mostly critical of eastern and <b>New</b> <b>Age</b> <b>practices.</b> The 2003 document was published as a 90-page handbook detailing the Vatican's position. The Vatican warned that concentration on the physical aspects of meditation [...] "can degenerate into a cult of the body" [...] and that equating bodily states with mysticism [...] "could also lead to psychic disturbance and, at times, to moral deviations." [...] Such {{has been compared to}} the early days of Christianity, when the church opposed the gnostics' belief that salvation came not through faith but through a mystical inner knowledge. The letter also says, [...] "one can see if and how [...] might be enriched by meditation methods developed in other religions and cultures" [...] but maintains the idea that [...] "there must be some fit between the nature of [...] prayer and Christian beliefs about ultimate reality." [...] Some fundamentalist Christian organizations consider yoga to be incompatible with their religious background, considering it a part of the New Age movement inconsistent with Christianity.|$|E

[...] In response to a question asking if the magic presented in the Harry Potter series should be considered in the same light as some <b>New</b> <b>Age</b> <b>practices</b> warned against in the document, Fleetwood stated, [...] "If I have understood well the intentions of Harry Potter's author, they help children to see the difference between good and evil. And she is very clear on this." [...] He added that Rowling is [...] "Christian by conviction, is Christian in her mode of living, even in her way of writing." [...] This comment was seized on by the media as an endorsement of the novels from the Catholic Church, and by extension, the Pope at that time, John Paul II, though {{there is no evidence that}} the Pope officially approved of the novels.|$|E
500|$|Some Christians {{integrate}} {{yoga and}} other aspects of Eastern spirituality with prayer and meditation. This has been attributed to a desire to experience God in a more complete way. In 2013, Monsignor Raffaello Martinelli, servicing Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, having worked for over 23 years with Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger (Pope Benedict XVI), said that for his Meditation, a Christian can learn from other religious traditions (zen, yoga, controlled respiration, Mantra), quoting Aspects of Christian meditation: [...] "Just as [...] "the Catholic Church rejects nothing of what is true and holy in these religions," [...] neither should these ways be rejected out of hand simply because they are not Christian. On the contrary, one can take from them what is useful so long as the Christian conception of prayer, its logic and requirements are never obscured. It is within the context of all of this that these bits and pieces should be taken up and expressed anew." [...] Previously, the Roman Catholic Church, and some other Christian organizations have expressed concerns and disapproval with respect to some eastern and <b>New</b> <b>Age</b> <b>practices</b> that include yoga and meditation.|$|E

Gerald Gardner's publication of Witchcraft Today was foundational in the promulgation of nature-based religions, most popularly Wicca.

In order to bring some new light to this debate we compared <b>New</b> <b>Age</b> with Roman Catholic and atheist/agnostic participants on a battery of social-psychological measures, including values, self-concepts, and individualism/collectivism. Results indicate that <b>New</b> <b>Age</b> individuals adopt an individualist outlook similar to that of nonreligious people, but also define themselves using a set of abstract holistic self-concepts, show avoidance of competitive goals, and stress values of universalism.
