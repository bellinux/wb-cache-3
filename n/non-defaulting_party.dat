50|$|The Court of Appeal {{confirmed}} {{that because the}} non-occurrence of an Event of Default was a condition precedent to payment under the Master Agreement, this meant that if an Event of Default was continuing that no party could be under an obligation to make payment even if payment was otherwise due unless the <b>non-Defaulting</b> <b>Party</b> exercised its right to early termination. Effectively, under the contractual terms of the ISDA Master Agreement, the <b>non-Defaulting</b> <b>Party</b> was able to preclude its own liability to pay by relying upon the occurrence of an Event of Default {{in relation to the}} other party and simply not exercising the right to terminate. They rejected any argument that there was an implied term {{on the part of the}} <b>non-Defaulting</b> <b>Party</b> to terminate within a reasonable period of time or at all after the occurrence of an Event of Default.|$|E
5000|$|The facts {{varied between}} the {{individual}} appeals, but the common theme in each of them was that an Event of Default (as defined) had occurred under an ISDA Master Agreement, but the Defaulting Party (as defined) was [...] "in the money", {{in the sense that}} if the open positions were all to be terminated, the <b>non-Defaulting</b> <b>Party</b> would have had to pay over considerable sums to the Defaulting Party to close out the various positions. However, in each case the relevant Master Agreements had not provided for automatic early termination upon an Event of Default. Accordingly, each <b>non-Defaulting</b> <b>Party</b> could simply elect not to terminate {{on the basis of the}} Event of Default and avoid paying the sums otherwise due to the Defaulting Party.|$|E
5000|$|For example, a {{contract}} may {{state that the}} recording of a lien against certain property is a default. If the default is left uncured after notice and the passage of time, it may ripen into an event of default, which creates in the <b>non-defaulting</b> <b>party</b> certain rights, such as acceleration of a debt or the right to exit {{a contract}}.|$|E
5000|$|This {{problem was}} then {{compounded}} by the drafting of the ISDA Master Agreement which stated that non-occurrence of an Event of Default was a [...] "condition precedent" [...] to any payment obligation. In the cases before the court, because the Event of Default was continuing up until {{the time when the}} financial contracts would naturally have come due for payment, the <b>non-Defaulting</b> <b>Parties</b> argued that they never had to pay the sums due because the condition precedent was not satisfied; in essence they were entitled to a windfall and could avoid their liabilities under the relevant derivative contracts because of the other party's default.|$|R
5000|$|Accordingly, the Court held, {{following}} {{the decision of}} the Supreme Court of New South Wales in Enron Australia v TXU Electricity 2003 NSWSC 1169, that the underlying debt remains in existing even though the payment obligation is inoperable. Accordingly, if the provisions preventing the operation of the payment obligation fall away, the [...] "payment obligation will spring up under a pre-existing trade once the relevant condition is satisfied, and in that sense it might be said (with only approximate accuracy) that the payment obligation is 'suspended' while the condition remains unfulfilled." [...] It {{is important to note that}} these issues only arose in the first two appeals because the parties elected not to utilise the automatic early termination (AET) provisions in the Master Agreement. Accordingly, early termination could only by election, and that left the <b>non-Defaulting</b> <b>Parties</b> free to withhold making that election and crystallising their payment obligations. However the underlying analysis would be relevant to issues raised in the second two appeals.|$|R
5000|$|In Lomas v JFB Firth Rixson Inc it {{was argued}} that certain {{provisions}} in standard form ISDA Master Agreement might offend against the rule; specifically {{that if an}} Event of Default (as defined) suspended {{the right of the}} Defaulting Party to receive payment indefinitely, then that would mean that if the <b>Non-Defaulting</b> <b>Party</b> went into liquidation, the operating effect of the provision was to deprive the company's creditors of assets as a consequence of it going into liquidation. However the Court of Appeal considered the principles outlined in Belmont Park Investments Pty Ltd v BNY Corporate Trustee Services Ltd, and held that [...] "If this is the touchstone then {{it is difficult to see}} how Section 2(a)(iii) of the Master Agreement can be said to offend against the anti-deprivation principle. ... There is no suggestion that it was formulated in order to avoid the effect of any insolvency law or to give the <b>non-defaulting</b> <b>party</b> a greater or disproportionate return as a creditor of the bankrupt estate." ...|$|E
5000|$|At first {{instance}} {{it was held}} that the payment obligation of the <b>non-Defaulting</b> <b>Party</b> was suspended during the currency of the transaction, the suspension ended on maturity whereupon the liability was then extinguished. The court at {{first instance}} appeared to feel compelled to so hold, as otherwise the obligation would remain outstanding but not due for payment indefinitely. After considerably analysis of the various issues the Court of Appeal held however that this in fact the result: ...|$|E
5000|$|The Court further {{held that}} there is no {{necessary}} implication that the payment right must inevitably revive at some point, after effluxion of time or otherwise. Arguments to the effect that there should be an implied term in the ISDA Master Agreement to that effect were dismissed. [...] Although it might be administratively inconvenient, the result of the factual situation was that the <b>non-Defaulting</b> <b>Party</b> would remain liable to the Defaulting Party potentially forever, but never be under an obligation to make actual payment with respect to that liability.|$|E
5000|$|Close-out netting: In {{the event}} of {{counterparty}} bankruptcy or any other relevant event of default specified in the relevant agreement if accelerated (i.e. effected), all transactions or all of a given type are netted (i.e. set off against each other) at market value or, if otherwise specified in the contract {{or if it is}} not possible to obtain a market value, at an amount equal to the loss suffered by the <b>non-defaulting</b> <b>party</b> in replacing the relevant contract. The alternative would allow the liquidator to choose which contracts to enforce and which not to (and thus potentially [...] "cherry pick"). There are international jurisdictions where the enforceability of netting in bankruptcy has not been legally tested. Bare bants.|$|E
5000|$|In {{one of the}} cojoined appeals it {{was argued}} that if an Event of Default {{suspended}} {{the right of the}} Defaulting Party to receive payment indefinitely, then that would be a breach of the anti-deprivation rule. [...] Because in this case the Event of Default was one party going into liquidation, that meant that the operating effect of the provision was to deprive the company's creditors of assets as a consequence of it going into liquidation. The Court referred to the recent decision of the Supreme Court in Belmont Park Investments Pty Ltd v BNY Corporate Trustee Services Ltd 2011 UKSC 38 and held that relevant test was to consider each transaction on its merits to see whether the shift in interests complained of could be justified as a genuine and justifiable commercial response to the consequences of insolvency. The Court of Appeal held that [...] "If this is the touchstone then {{it is difficult to see}} how Section 2(a)(iii) of the Master Agreement can be said to offend against the anti-deprivation principle. ... There is no suggestion that it was formulated in order to avoid the effect of any insolvency law or to give the <b>non-defaulting</b> <b>party</b> a greater or disproportionate return as a creditor of the bankrupt estate." ...|$|E
5000|$|In {{the fourth}} appeal the Court of Appeal had to {{consider}} a Master Agreement where the parties had selected automatic early termination (AET). They had to therefore consider a separate point raised whereby whether the AET provisions necessarily assumed that all conditions precedent were satisfied (i.e. amongst other things, there was no Event of Default) {{for the purposes of}} carrying out the calculation of the amounts payable (defined as [...] "Loss" [...] under the agreement). The Court framed the question thus: [...] "is Bulk as the <b>Non-defaulting</b> <b>Party</b> obliged to calculate its loss by reference to sums which would have become due to Britannia Bulk had Britannia Bulk not remained subject to an Event of Default after Automatic Early Termination?" [...] The Court held not, and upheld the existing line of authority on this point, most notably in the decision of Gloster J in Pioneer Freight Co Ltd v TMT Asia Ltd 2011 2 Lloyds Rep 96. [...] In line with its decision on the earlier points in the decision, the Court of Appeal held that absence of a condition precedent preventing the payment mechanism working, but it did not otherwise affect the underlying debt accruing and being calculated in accordance with the terms of the agreement.|$|E
40|$|The current default {{judgment}} {{system is}} filled with problems. Default judgments are routinely set aside based upon the party’s “excusable neglect” for failing to timely answer. In such cases, the defaulting party’s negligence is essentially condoned because the <b>non-defaulting</b> <b>party</b> is not properly compensated for the delay and the defaulting party is not adequately reprimanded. Even after obtaining a default judgment, the nondefaulting party may have its victory disappear if a motion to set aside is filed shortly thereafter. On the other hand, some parties involved in litigation are ambushed with a default based on improper service. By sitting on the judgment without giving notice or attempting to collect, the nondefaulting party can even manipulate the one-year cutoff date in Rule 60 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure regarding the arguments {{that can be made}} in the motion to set aside. Fortunately, there are some simple solutions to improve the default judgment framework...|$|E
40|$|Special bail-in powers, {{similar to}} those of the EU Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (the BRRD), have been in the {{legislative}} sights of HM Treasury (HMT) since the Independent Commission on Banking reported in 2011. Consequently, many of the bail-in tools called for by the BRRD have already found legislative enactment (if not full commencement) in the UK with 2013 ’s amendments to the Banking Act 2009. The specific treatment of the bail-in of derivatives, however, remained an exception. Aware of this difference, and, it will be conjectured, concerned about the scope of the BRRD’s attempts to bail-in derivatives, HMT have enacted secondary legislation dealing with this matter. Having discussed the route to today’s secondary legislation on derivatives bail-in in Part 2. 1, we will consider inter alia the following issues raised by the power to bail-in derivatives in the secondary legislation in Part 2. 2 including: (i) what is a ‘derivative,’ and does HMT agree with the BRRD’s definition; (ii) the critical role of close-out netting, and whether this is appropriate for all derivatives in the widest sense; (iii) the appropriateness of safeguards for protected liabilities and excluded liabilities e. g. secured interests; and (iv) practical matters like valuation. In Part 2. 3 this chapter will consider the systemic effects of bail-in; that is, firstly, the shockwaves caused by bailing in a derivative which is hedged by the <b>non-defaulting</b> <b>party,</b> and secondly, the effect of bailing in bank securities which will (following ISDA’s 2014 amendments to the Credit Derivatives Definitions) trigger a Credit Event for Credit Default Swaps...|$|E
