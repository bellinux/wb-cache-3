But their losses were heavy, over 2,000 {{men had been}} killed, almost half the force while the allies had lost 1,900 men. The defenses at Nyborg was in no condition to withstand a siege. There was <b>nothing</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Swedish to do but to surrender, forcing 5,000 men into captivity; Sweden had suffered a devastating defeat.|$|E
5|$|In 1969 {{the large}} Allied Breweries combine {{initiated}} a {{hostile takeover bid}} for Boddingtons, which valued the company at £5million. Charles Boddington took {{the unusual step of}} issuing a spirited defence of the company to the shareholders: You will be only too aware that present-day pressures bear heavily towards the elimination of individuality and character in many consumer goods. There is an inexorable progression towards the mass-produced nationwide product of standardised quality. You, however, are still, at this moment in time, a shareholder in one of the remaining independent brewery companies whose traditional draught beers have a reputation for quality and individual character beyond the immediate area of the North of England in which we operate... The takeover of Boddingtons and its consequent elimination can achieve very little. It will do <b>nothing</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> national economy, add nothing to the nation's exports, and contribute nothing at all to the quality of life that we are all used to enjoy.|$|E

5|$|The {{ship was}} torpedoed twice by British submarines; the first, in July 1941, necessitated {{three months of}} repairs. The second, in August 1942, caused {{extensive}} damage and ended the ship's career. She was eventually towed back to La Spezia, where repairs were to be completed. Resources were unavailable, however, and Bolzano remained there, out of action. Plans to convert her into a hybrid cruiser-aircraft carrier came to <b>nothing</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> same reason. After Italy surrendered to the Allies in September 1943, La Spezia was occupied by German forces; {{to prevent them from}} using her as a blockship, Italian and British frogmen sank Bolzano using Chariot manned torpedoes in June 1944. The Italian Navy ultimately raised the ship in September 1949 and broke her up for scrap.|$|E
5|$|William Mauditt left {{a son and}} heir, Warin, a minor, whose custody was {{assigned}} by Henry III to his brother Richard, Earl of Cornwall. During this time, Richard temporarily held the manor of Shalden from Henry until his death 1272. Consequently, Warin Mauditt held the manor {{until his death in}} either 1299 or 1300. Interest in the manor passed down to his son Thomas, in which he granted a sum of land at Shalden to a Knight named Walter Stoner and his freeman, in gratitude for his homage and services. At that time Sir Nicholas de Boys held the manor of Shalden as a tenant for life. In 1297 the Earl of Cornwall, in consideration of the services of Sir Nicholas, granted the manor to him and his heirs indefinitely. Sir Nicholas paid <b>nothing</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> manor, though his heirs were to pay £12 a year.|$|E
5|$|Six {{months after}} The Inquirer was founded, with {{competition}} from eight established daily newspapers, {{lack of funds}} forced Norvell and Walker to sell the newspaper to publisher and United States Gazette associate editor Jesper Harding. After Harding acquired The Pennsylvania Inquirer, it was briefly published as an afternoon paper before returning to its original morning format in January 1830. Under Harding, in 1829, The Inquirer moved from its original location between Front and Second Streets to between Second and Third Streets. When Harding bought and merged the Morning Journal in January 1830, the newspaper was moved to South Second Street. Ten years later The Inquirer again was moved, this time to its own building {{at the corner of}} Third Street and Carter's Alley. Harding expanded The Inquirers content and the paper soon grew into a major Philadelphian newspaper. The expanded content included the addition of fiction, and in 1840, Harding gained rights to publish several Charles Dickens novels for which Dickens was paid a significant amount. At the time the common practice was to pay little or <b>nothing</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> rights of foreign authors' works.|$|E

5|$|Sources for William's actions between 1082 and 1084 are meagre. According to the {{historian}} David Bates, this probably means that little happened of note, and that because William {{was on the}} continent, there was <b>nothing</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Anglo-Saxon Chronicle to record. In 1082 William ordered the arrest of his half-brother Odo. The exact reasons are unclear, as no contemporary author recorded what caused the quarrel between the half-brothers. Orderic Vitalis later recorded that Odo had aspirations to become pope. Orderic also related that Odo had attempted to persuade some of William's vassals to join Odo on an invasion of southern Italy. This {{would have been considered}} tampering with the king's authority over his vassals, which William would not have tolerated. Although Odo remained in confinement for the rest of William's reign, his lands were not confiscated. More difficulties struck in 1083, when William's eldest son Robert rebelled once more with support from the French king. A further blow was the death of Matilda, William's wife, on 2 November 1083. William was always described as close to his wife, and her death would have added to his problems.|$|E

25|$|Forgetting the raw gas {{burns on}} his own arm, Haile Selassie retired into his Palace for a final conference with his chieftains. It was clear {{to him that the}} Government of the Ethiopian Empire would have to move from Addis Ababa. One {{possibility}} was for the government to relocate to Gore in the southwest and he sought comment on this plan. Initially his bearded chiefs said nothing at all. But, when the chiefs did talk, they explained that the one effective Ethiopian army left was fighting for its life under Ras Nasibu Emmanual in the Ogaden. This army was pitted against General Rodolfo Graziani's relentless advance on Harar. They added that the tribes to the west were in an ugly mood. One after another, the chiefs rose to tell how hopeless the situation was and to say that there was <b>nothing</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Emperor to do but run for his life.|$|E
25|$|The steam {{turbines}} were plagued with problems {{from the time}} the ship first entered service and, despite being technically advanced and fuel-efficient in 1968, her consumption of 600 tons of fuel oil every twenty four hours was more than expected for such a ship by the 1980s. After seventeen years of service the availability of spare parts was becoming difficult due to the outdated design of the boilers and turbines, and Cunard decided that the options were to either do <b>nothing</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> remainder of the ship's life, re-configure the existing engines, or re-engine the vessel with a more efficient diesel-electric powerplant. Ultimately it was decided to replace the engines, as it was calculated that the savings in fuel costs and maintenance would pay for themselves over four years, and give the vessel a minimum of another twenty years of service, whereas the other options would only provide short-term relief. Her {{steam turbines}} had taken her to a record breaking total of 2,622,858 miles in 18 years.|$|E
25|$|Basket weaving was {{the highest}} form of art and utility, and canoes were the peak in man made products. Local trade between Indian tribal groups enabled them to acquire {{seasonings}} such as salt, or foodstuffs and other goods that might be rare in certain locales, such as flint for making spear and arrow points. The high and rugged Sierra Nevada mountains located behind the Great Basin Desert east of California, extensive forests and deserts on the north, the rugged and harsh Sonoran Desert and Mojave Desert {{in the south and}} the Pacific Ocean on the west effectively isolated California from any easy trade or tribal interactions with Indians {{on the rest of the}} continent. The Indians located in the core of California are much different in culture than any other Indian cultures in North America. Cabrillo and his men found that there was essentially <b>nothing</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Spanish to easily exploit in California, and located at the extreme limits of exploration and trade from Spain it would be left essentially unexplored and unsettled for the next 234 years.|$|E

500|$|By {{the late}} 1970s, American {{companies}} were producing simple home computer kits {{such as the}} MITS Altair and IMSAI 8080.

New Scientist stated in 1977 that [...] "the price of an American kit in dollars rapidly translates into the same figure in pounds sterling by the time it has reached the shores of Britain". Off-the-shelf personal computers were also available for {{the high end of the}} market but were extremely expensive; Olivetti's offering cost £2,000, and the Commodore PET, launched in 1979, sold for £700.

500|$|On September 10 in Springfield, Illinois, {{speaking}} {{on behalf of}} Republican Senator Ralph Smith, Agnew began his campaign, which would be noted for harsh rhetoric and memorable phrases. Agnew attacked the [...] "pusillanimous pussyfooting" [...] of the liberals, including those in Congress, who Agnew said cared <b>nothing</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> blue- and white-collar workers, the [...] "Forgotten Man of American politics". Addressing the California Republican Convention in San Diego, Agnew targeted [...] "the nattering nabobs of negativism. They have formed their own 4-H Club—the 'Hopeless, Hysterical, Hypochondriacs of History'." [...] He warned that candidates of any party who espoused radical views should be voted out, a reference to New York Senator Charles Goodell, who was on the ballot that November, and who opposed the Vietnam War. Believing that the strategy was working, Nixon met with Agnew at the White House on September 24, and urged him to continue.|$|E

Coach Joachim Löw stated his team had [...] "a clear, persistent game-plan", and as they realised Brazil were [...] "cracking up", they took advantage as in contrast to the Brazilians' nervousness the German players were [...] "extremely cool". Toni Kroos, who was chosen as Man of the Match, added that as the Germans felt that in [...] "no game of the Cup, [...] played their best", the squad entered with the tactical knowledge on how to counter Brazil: [...] "we took all the balls, and scored the goals". Löw also declared the team had [...] "no euphoria" [...] during or after the game, as they knew that the 7–1 win meant <b>nothing</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> upcoming final, saying [...] "We didn't celebrate.

500|$|All but {{a handful}} of Smetana's {{compositions}} before his departure for Gothenburg had been piano works. Some of these early pieces have been dismissed by music historian Harold Schonberg as [...] "bombastic virtuoso rhetoric derived from Liszt". Under Proksch, however, Smetana acquired more polish, as revealed in works such as the G minor Sonata of 1846 and the E-flat Polka of the same year. The set of Six Characteristic Pieces of 1848 was dedicated to Liszt, who described it as [...] "the most outstanding, finely felt and finely finished pieces that have recently come to my note." [...] In this period Smetana planned a cycle of so-called [...] "album leaves", short pieces in every major and minor key, after the manner of Chopin's Preludes. The project became somewhat disorganised; in the pieces completed, some keys are repeated while others are unrepresented. After Smetana's final return from Gothenburg, when he committed himself primarily to the development of Czech opera, he wrote <b>nothing</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> piano for 13years.|$|E
