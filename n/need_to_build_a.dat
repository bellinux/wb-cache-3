He ordered the 3rd Parachute Brigade to secure the start point along the Dives canal and railway line, while the 5th Parachute Brigade assaulted the artillery position at Putot.|$|E

25|$|On September 11, 2001, a {{terrorist}} attack destroyed the World Trade Center, located slightly {{to the north of}} South Ferry and the Battery. Since the entire WTC site was destroyed in the attacks, this meant that the segment of the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line that ran through the WTC, including the Cortlandt Street station two stops north of South Ferry, was also destroyed. This changed 1, 2 and 3 service and led to reduced service in Manhattan and Brooklyn until the WTC section of the line reopened in September 2002. Concurrent with the rebuilding of that section of the line, MTA officials recognized the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>a</b> more efficient terminal for the 1 and 9 trains at South Ferry, since it was anticipated that the line would be heavily used in the long-term aftermath of the attacks.

Adams used his authority as bandleader and Chief Petty Officer with the navy as a source of power, wealth, and influence. Their induction not only helped to defuse the racial tension that plagued the navy’s presence on the island during World War I, but the band, and Adams in particular, functioned as educators to naval administrators about the needs and attitudes of Virgin Islanders. Further, Adams continued to grow into his role as a social leader on the islands, serving as an officer of the local chapter of the Red Cross, helping to found the public library in Charlotte Amalie, and developing the islands’ public school music education program.|$|E

500|$|As {{expansion}} of the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad (DL) continued westward from Hoboken, the railroad company saw the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>a</b> new bridge over the Delaware River. Reaching the community of Delaware (named after the river nearby), DL built a train station previously in the community, denoted as Delaware Station. The new wood bridge was constructed on the railroad mainline during 1855. The structure lasted a short time, until DL replaced the wooden crossing for a new [...] long iron bridge. The new bridge had two tracks to cross the river, serving the local area with coal cars and boxcars crossing. The new bridge survived the floods in 1903 that destroyed many bridges (including the nearby Riverton-Belvidere Bridge) along the Delaware and continued to prosper.|$|E
500|$|The lack of {{importance}} placed on military matters in Australian political circles continued for some time, {{and the size}} of the Australian military in this time continued to fall, in part due to the emphasis placed upon mounted units in the new command structure. However, following a number of strategic and political [...] "scares", defence matters slowly began to take on more primacy in the Australian psyche before a review of defence needs was made in 1909 by Field Marshal Lord Kitchener. The result of this review was the realisation of the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>a</b> credible defence force that could not only defend the nation, but also possibly contribute to the Imperial defence system (although this later realisation remained little more than a consideration on paper only). The review also validated the compulsory military training scheme that was to be introduced in 1910, which was directly responsible for expanding the Citizens Forces by up to 50 percent in the three years prior to the outbreak of World War I.|$|E
500|$|During the {{protracted}} negotiations, {{the company}} had also {{been talking to the}} Aire and Calder about compartment boats, which resulted in a proposal to jointly fund and build a canal from Bramwith to the Aire and Calder. The [...] New Junction Canal was authorised in 1891, and finally opened in 1905. This removed the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>a</b> new port at Keadby, and the planned upgrade to take larger vessels was also shelved, because the company were unable to raise significant working capital. Despite the lack of investment and the difficulties of the First World War, the waterways were still quite busy, with traffic recovering from 381,727 tons in 1926, the year of the general strike, to over 800,000 tons in 1937. Bramwith lock, the first on the Stainforth and Keadby, was lengthened in 1932, and a new colliery layby was constructed to enable compartment boats to reach Hatfield Main Colliery. Stainforth lock, which connected the canal to the River Don, was closed in 1939. The winter of 1947 was particularly severe, and the Stainforth and Keadby was closed for a period due to ice. After the Second World War, the canals of the Sheffield and South Yorkshire Navigation were nationalised on 1 January 1948, together with most other operational canals in Britain.|$|E

2500|$|Chalmers' {{argument}} is that it seems plausible that such a being could exist because {{all that is needed}} is that all and only the things that the physical sciences describe and observe about a human being must be true of the zombie. None of the concepts involved in these sciences make reference to consciousness or other mental phenomena, and any physical entity can be described scientifically via physics whether it is conscious or not. The mere logical possibility of a p-zombie demonstrates that consciousness is a natural phenomenon beyond the current unsatisfactory explanations. Chalmers states that one probably could not build a living p-zombie because living things seem to require a level of consciousness. However (unconscious?) robots built to simulate humans may become the first real p-zombies. Hence Chalmers half-joking calls for the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>a</b> [...] "consciousness meter" [...] to ascertain if any given entity, human or robot, is conscious or not.|$|E

Meetings between state transportation officials (Mn/DOT), Rybak, State Transportation Commissioner Carol Molnau, and Governor Tim Pawlenty yielded a desire to build a 10 lane bridge that will last 100 years, with the possibility of bus rapid transit or light rail lines. Rybak said, [...] "Transit needs to play some role in this or otherwise we would <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>a</b> much wider bridge in the future." [...] At a public forum in Roseville, hundreds of Twin Cities residents participated in a discussion about the bridge design. The overriding theme of the crowd was a desire to plan for the bridge's use of mass transit. Commissioner Molnau, in conjunction with Metropolitan Council Chairman Peter Bell, recommended that light rail not be incorporated in the new bridge design. [...] But Pawlenty, responding to constituents and the mayor, directed Mn/DOT to design the bridge to be light rail-ready. He said the estimated additional $20 to $35 million would be paid for by the state.|$|E
2500|$|By 1880 the Staten Island Railway {{was barely}} operational, {{and as a}} result New York State sued, through Attorney General Hamilton Ward, to have the company {{dissolved}} in May of the same year. The suit said that the Company had become [...] "insolvent in September 1872, to have then surrendered its rights to others, and have failed to exercise those rights." [...] The legal proceedings proceeded for a while after an injunction was obtained, which restrained the creditors of the railway company from proceeding against it until after the determination of the suit of the people. While the railroad was not doing well, it become the centerpiece for a plan to develop the island by a Canadian, Erastus Wiman. In 1867, Wiman arrived in New York to oversee the main office of Dun, Barlow, and Company in New York. Wiman {{became one of the most}} prominent residents of Staten Island after locating his residence in a mansion on the island.
