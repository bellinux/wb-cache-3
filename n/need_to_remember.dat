25|$|According to the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Spinoza's God is an “infinite intellect” (Ethics 2p11c) — all knowing (2p3), {{and capable}} of loving both himself—and us, insofar as {{we are part of}} his {{perfection}} (5p35c). And if the mark of a personal being is that it is one towards which we can entertain personal attitudes, then we should note too that Spinoza recommends amor intellectualis dei (the intellectual love of God) as the supreme good for man (5p33). However, the matter is complex. Spinoza's God does not have free will (1p32c1), he does not have purposes or intentions (1 appendix), and Spinoza insists that “neither intellect nor will pertain to the nature of God” (1p17s1). Moreover, while we may love God, we <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> that God is really not the kind of being who could ever love us back. “He who loves God cannot strive that God should love him in return,” says Spinoza (5p19).|$|E

5000|$|The four kasaya are: krodha (anger), lobha (greed), mana (ego) and maya (deceit). Out of {{the many}} causes of bondage, {{emotions}} or passions are considered as {{the main cause of}} bandha or bondage. The karmas are literally bound on account of the stickiness of the soul due to existence of various passions or mental dispositions. The passions like anger, pride, deceit and greed are called sticky (kaṣāyas) because they act like glue in making karmic particles stick to the soul resulting in bandha. The karmic inflow on account of yoga driven by passions and emotions cause a long term inflow of karma prolonging the cycle of reincarnations. On the other hand, the karmic inflows on account of actions that are not driven by passions and emotions have only a transient, short-lived karmic effect. Hence the ancient Jain texts talk of subduing these negative emotions: Negating kashayas can be done by remembering the opposites of kasahayas : Opposite of Krodha (Anger) is Kshama (Forgiveness). To avoid Krodha kashayas, one <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> <b>to</b> forgive. Opposite of lobha (greed) is Daan (Charity), one <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> <b>to</b> give away. Opposite of Mana(Ego) is humility, one <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> be humble. Opposite of Deceit is <b>to</b> honesty, one <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> be honest in all conditions to not get deceit kashayas.|$|R

2500|$|Serial {{recall in}} {{long-term}} memory (LTM) differs from serial recall in short-term memory (STM). [...] To store a sequence in LTM, the sequence is repeated over time {{until it is}} represented in memory as a whole, {{rather than as a}} series of items. [...] In this way, there is no <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> the relationships between the items and their original positions. [...] In STM, immediate serial recall (ISR) has been thought to result from one of two mechanisms. [...] The first refers to ISR as a result of associations between the items and their positions in a sequence, while the second refers to associations between items. [...] These associations between items are referred to as chaining, and is an unlikely mechanism, according to research. [...] Position-item relationships do not account for recency and primacy effects, or the phonological similarity effect. [...] The Primacy Model moves away from these two assumptions, suggesting that ISR results from a gradient of activation levels where each item has a particular level of activation that corresponds to its position. Research has supported the fact that immediate serial recall performance is much better when the list is homogenous (of the same semantic category) than when they are heterogeneous (of different semantic category). This suggests that semantic representations are beneficial to immediate serial recall performance. Short-term serial recall is also affected by similar-sounding items, as recall is lower (remembered more poorly) than items that do not sound alike. This is true when lists are tested independently (when comparing two separate lists of similar-sounding and not similar-sounding items) as well as when tested using a mixed list. Alan Baddeley first reported such an experiment in which items within a list were either mutually dissimilar or highly similar.|$|E
