25|$|The {{most current}} {{reliable}} evidence strongly indicates that initial settlement of New Zealand occurred around 1280 CE {{at the end}} of the medieval warm period. Previous dating of some kiore (Polynesian rat) bones at 50–150CE has now been shown to have been unreliable; new samples of bone (and now also of unequivocally rat-gnawed woody seed cases) match the 1280 date of the earliest archaeological sites and the beginning of sustained deforestation by humans. Māori oral history describes the arrival of ancestors from Hawaiki (the mythical homeland in tropical Polynesia), in large ocean-going waka. Migration accounts vary among tribes (iwi), whose members may identify with several waka in their genealogies (whakapapa). In the last few decades mitochondrial DNA research has allowed an estimate to be made of the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> <b>in</b> the founding population—between 50 and 100.

25|$|Several factors {{affect the}} feminization of poverty, and these factors place women {{at high risk}} of poverty. Multiple factors {{contribute}} to women’s economic insecurity, including the gender wage gap, women’s prevalence in low-paid occupations, a lack of work-family supports, and the challenges involved in accessing public benefits. Though low income is the major cause, there are many interrelated facets of this problem. Lone mothers are usually at the highest risk for extreme poverty because their income is insufficient to rear children. It then lowers their children's possibilities for good education and nourishment. Low income is a consequence of the social bias women face in trying to obtain formal employment, which in turn deepens the cycle of poverty. As the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> <b>in</b> poverty increases, the diverse causes affecting their poverty must be examined. Poverty is multidimensional, and therefore economic, demographic, and socio-cultural factors all overlap and contribute to the establishment of poverty. It is a phenomenon with multiple root causes and manifestations.|$|E
40|$|The low and {{shrinking}} <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> <b>in</b> higher {{computer science}} educa-tion {{is a well-known}} problem in most Western countries. The dominant Western perception {{of the relationship between}} gender and computer science codes the latter as “masculine, ” and the low <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> is seen at least partly as an effect of that coding. Malaysia represents a different case. There are large <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> <b>in</b> computer science, and computer science is not perceived as “masculine. ” Rather, it is deemed as providing suitable jobs and good careers for women. This reflects an understanding of gender where femininities are constructed by association to office work, commonly recog-nized as a woman-friendly space because it is seen as more safe and protected than, for example, construction sites and factories. The findings suggest that gender and computer science may be more diversely coproduced than commonly believed in Western research.
