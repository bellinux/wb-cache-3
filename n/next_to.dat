In {{the latter}} case the radiative corrections are evaluated in a special scheme {{that allows us to}} employ the predictive power of conformal symmetry.

Beyond <b>next</b> [...] <b>to</b> [...] leading order we find, in contrast, that the corrections for an input scale of few GeV^ 2 are small enough to justify the uses of perturbation theory. For ξ > 5 10 ^- 3 the modification of the scale dependence is also small. However, with decreasing ξ it becomes moderate or even large, in particular for the phase. Comment: 17 pages, 2 figure...|$|R
