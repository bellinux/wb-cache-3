5|$|As {{a result}} of Hodgson's appeal, Operation Iceberg {{was created by the}} Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) with the aim of using DNA {{evidence}} in pre-1990 rape or murder cases.

In September 2009, on the basis of DNA evidence from his exhumed body, police <b>named</b> <b>David</b> Lace as the likely killer. Lace, who was 17 {{at the time of the}} murder, had confessed to police in 1983 that he had raped and killed DeSimone, but officers refused to believe him.

His first jobs included selling magazines for spending money. Growing up in Carlyle, Dean was the town's main paperboy for The Saturday Evening Post.|$|E
5|$|There are {{differences}} between the German and French releases of the film. The character Allan Grey is <b>named</b> <b>David</b> Gray for the German release, which Dreyer attributed to a mistake. The German censors ordered cuts to the film that still exist today in some prints. The scenes {{which had to be}} toned down include the doctor's death under the milled flour and the vampire's death from the stake. There are other scenes that were shot and included in the script that do not exist in any current prints of Vampyr. These scenes reveal the vampire in the factory recoiling against a shadow of a Christian cross as well as a ferryman guiding Gray and Gisèle by getting young children to build a fire and sing a hymn to guide them back to the shore.|$|E

5|$|In 1879, Camille Flammarion {{noted that}} the comets 1862 III and 1889 III had aphelia of 47 and 49AU, respectively, {{suggesting}} that they might mark the orbital radius of an unknown planet that had dragged them into an elliptical orbit. Astronomer George Forbes concluded {{on the basis of}} this evidence that two planets must exist beyond Neptune. He calculated, based on the fact that four comets possessed aphelia at around 100AU and a further six with aphelia clustered at around 300AU, the orbital elements of a pair of hypothetical trans-Neptunian planets. These elements concorded suggestively with those made independently by another astronomer <b>named</b> <b>David</b> Peck Todd, suggesting to many that they might be valid. However, sceptics argued that the orbits of the comets involved were still too uncertain to produce meaningful results. George Forbes is today considered to be the first describing Planet Nine.|$|E
5|$|Solanas {{said that}} she {{regularly}} suffered sexual abuse {{at the hands of}} her father. Her parents divorced when she was young, and her mother remarried shortly afterwards. Solanas disliked her stepfather and began rebelling against her mother, becoming a truant. As a child, she wrote insults for children to use on one another, for the cost of a dime. She beat up a boy in high school who was bothering a younger girl, and also hit a nun. Because of her rebellious behavior, her mother sent her to be raised by her grandparents in 1949. Solanas said that her grandfather was a violent alcoholic who often beat her. When she was 15, she left her grandparents and became homeless. In 1953, she gave birth to a son, fathered by a married sailor. The child, <b>named</b> <b>David</b> (later David Blackwell by adoption), was taken away from Solanas and she never saw him again.|$|E
