40|$|Abstract Background The {{time varying}} flows of biomass and energy in tsetse (Glossina) can be {{examined}} through {{the construction of}} a dynamic mass-energy budget specific to these flies but such a budget depends on efficiencies of metabolic conversion which are unknown. These efficiencies of conversion determine the overall yields when food or storage tissue is converted into body tissue or into metabolic energy. A biochemical approach to the estimation of these efficiencies uses stoichiometry and a simplified description of tsetse metabolism to derive estimates of the yields, for a given amount of each substrate, of conversion product, by-products, and exchanged gases. This biochemical approach improves on estimates obtained through calorimetry because the stoichiometric calculations explicitly include the inefficiencies and costs of the reactions of conversion. However, the biochemical approach still overestimates the actual conversion efficiency because the approach ignores all the biological inefficiencies and costs such as the inefficiencies of leaky membranes and the costs of molecular transport, enzyme production, and cell growth. Results This paper presents estimates of the <b>net</b> <b>amounts</b> of ATP, fat, or protein obtained by tsetse from a starting milligram of blood, and provides estimates of the <b>net</b> <b>amounts</b> of ATP formed from the catabolism of a milligram of fat along two separate pathways, one used for resting metabolism and one for flight. These estimates are derived from stoichiometric calculations constructed based on a detailed quantification of the composition of food and body tissue and on a description of the major metabolic pathways in tsetse simplified to single reaction sequences between substrates and products. The estimates include the expected amounts of uric acid formed, oxygen required, and carbon dioxide released during each conversion. The calculated estimates of uric acid egestion and of oxygen use compare favorably to published experimental measurements. Conclusion This biochemical analysis provides reasonable first estimates of the conversion efficiencies for the major pathways used by tsetse metabolism. These results now enable a deeper analysis of tsetse ecology based on the construction of a dynamic mass-energy budget for tsetse and their populations. </p...|$|E
40|$|The fluxes of {{dissolved}} reactive, organic, {{and total}} phosphorus {{into and out}} of non-feeding corals were measured by chemical and radiochemical techniques. A net uptake of reactive phosphorus from seawater by corals containing zooxanthellae was not, at typical ambient phosphorus levels, sufficient to offset simultaneous losses of organic P. Consequently, there was a net loss of total P. A coral without zooxanthellae was unable to remove <b>net</b> <b>amounts</b> of reactive P from solution even at levels above ambient. Reactive phosphorus uptake was light sensitive, was highly temperature dependent, showed char-acteristics of Michaelis-Menten kinetics, and could be inhibited by arsenate. An active transport mechanism appears to be involved. The kinetics of net reactive phosphorus uptake were described by a Michaelis-Menten equation modified to include a correction for an efflux of reactive P accompanying uptake. The mean half-saturation constant (K) for uptake was 377 nM and the mean maximum rate of uptake (unlax) was 293 ng atoms P * mg Chl a-l. h-l.

Anthony Liu provided skillful research assistance. This paper studies demographic differences between lower-income, less developed countries (the “South”) and higher-income developed countries (the “North”). The specific objective is to analyze the implications of demographic asymmetries for aggregate saving-investment imbalances, exchange rates, and the resulting net capital flows between North and South. An optimistic view of asymmetric demographic transitions among Southern and Northern economies suggests that the North can run a current-account surplus sizable in relation to the Northern economy, thereby transferring large <b>net</b> <b>amounts</b> of financial capital to the South. The analysis here argues that the optimistic view is a plausible summary of demographic influences on North-South capital flows in the historical period between 1950 and the mid- 1970 s. For historical decades after the 1970 s and for the initial decades of the 21 st century, however, the analysis argues instead that demographic forces considered by themselves are likely to diminis...|$|E
40|$|Upon activation, {{neutrophils}} release DNA fibers {{decorated with}} antimicrobial proteins, forming neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). Although NETs are bactericidal {{and contribute to}} innate host defense, excessive NET formation {{has been linked to}} the pathogenesis of autoinflammatory diseases. However, the mechanisms regulating NET formation, particularly during chronic inflammation, are poorly understood. Here we show that the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) CXCR 2 mediates NET formation. Downstream analyses showed that CXCR 2 -mediated NET formation was independent of NADPH oxidase and involved Src family kinases. We show the pathophysiological relevance of this mechanism in cystic fibrosis lung disease, characterized by chronic neutrophilic inflammation. We found abundant NETs in airway fluids of individuals with cystic fibrosis and mouse cystic fibrosis lung disease, and <b>NET</b> <b>amounts</b> correlated with impaired obstructive lung function. Pulmonary blockade of CXCR 2 by intra-airway delivery of small-molecule antagonists inhibited NET formation and improved lung function in vivo without affecting neutrophil recruitment, proteolytic activity or antibacterial host defense. These studies establish CXCR 2 as a receptor mediating NADPH oxidase-independent NET formation and provide evidence that this GPCR pathway is operative and druggable in cystic fibrosis lung diseas...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1971 Chloride is {{actively}} transported across {{the skin of}} the intact leopard frog, Rana pipiens. The influx and efflux in 0. 2 mM NaC 1 are 0. 67 and 0. 72 μeq/ 10 g-hr, respectively. The renal efflux of chloride is 0. 02 μeq/ 10 g-h. The transepithelial potential differences (TEP) range from - 1 to + 32 mV (sign refers to the inside). The mean measured ratio of influx to efflux is 0. 93. The flux ratio predicted from the flux ratio equation is 0. 005. Clearly, chloride {{is actively}} transported. With 0. 2 mM KC 1 in the external bath, the influx and efflux of chloride (0. 57 and 1. 05 μeq/ 10 g-hr, respectively) are not significantly different from the values obtained in 0. 2 mM NaC 1. The measured and predicted flux ratios are 0. 54 and 0. 002, respectively. Chloride is actively transported, and this transport is not dependent on the movement of sodium. The TEP is independent of the concentration of anion (chloride or sulfate) in the external bath. With increasing sodium concentration (NaC 1 or Na₂SO₄) in the external medium, the body fluids become more electropositive relative to the bath (the slope of the line is 22 mV /log[mM]). At high sodium concentrations (50 mM), the magnitude of the TEP is reduced with increasing bath concentration probably as a result of increased permeability of the skin to chloride. The TEP is independent of the K⁺ concentration in the external medium. The influx of chloride increases with increasing chloride concentration in the external bath at lower concentrations. The transporting system shows Michaelis-type kinetics. For NaC 1, V[subscript]max = 1. 3 μeq/ 10 g-hr and K[subscript]m = 0. 18 mM. For KC 1, V[subscript]max = 1. 2 μeq/ 10 g-hr and K[subscript]m = 0. 38 mM. Salt-depleted animals absorb <b>net</b> <b>amounts</b> of chloride (0. 78 μeq/ 10 g-hr) from 1. 0 mM KC 1 and lose <b>net</b> <b>amounts</b> of sodium and potassium (1. 10 and 0. 58 μeq/ 10 g-hr, respectively). When animals "pump" chloride from 1. 0 mM KC 1, the bath becomes more alkaline. The pH increases at the rate of 0. 056 pH units/hr. The animals excrete net quantities of base (3. 23 μeq/ 10 g-hr). The pK[subscript]b of the base excreted is 6. 0. The pK[subscripted]b of KHCO₃ in KC 1 is 6. 1. The excreted base is probably bicarbonate ion which exchanges for the absorbed chloride...|$|E

Using a breathing hood to isolate dermal from inhalation uptake, we measured urinary metabolites of diethylphthalate (DEP) and di-n-butylphthalate (DnBP) from an individual exposed to known concentrations of these compounds for 6 [*]h in an experimental chamber. The individual wore either clean (fresh) cotton clothes or cotton clothes that {{had been exposed to}} the same chamber air concentrations for 9 days. For a 6 -h exposure, the <b>net</b> <b>amounts</b> of DEP and DnBP absorbed when wearing fresh clothes were, respectively, 0. 017 and 0. 007 [*]μg/kg/(μg/m 3); for exposed clothes the results were 0. 178 and 0. 261 [*]μg/kg/(μg/m 3), respectively (values normalized by air concentration and body mass). When compared against the average results for bare-skinned participants, clean clothes were protective, whereas exposed clothes increased dermal uptake for DEP and DnBP by factors of 3. 3 and 6. 5, respectively. Even for non-occupational environments, wearing clothing that has adsorbed/absorbed indoor air pollutants can increase dermal uptake of SVOCs by substantial amounts relative to bare skin...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{ionophore}} A 23187 on cellular Ca 2 + fluxes, glycogenolysis and respiration was examined in perfused liver. At low extracellular Ca 2 + concentrations (less than 4 microM), A 23187 induced {{the mobilization of}} intracellular Ca 2 + and stimulated the rate of glycogenolysis and respiration. As the extracellular Ca 2 + concentration was elevated, biphasic cellular Ca 2 + fluxes were observed, with Ca 2 + uptake preceding Ca 2 + efflux. Under these conditions, both the glycogenolytic response and the respiratory response also became biphasic, allowing the differentiation between the effects of extracellular and intracellular Ca 2 +. Under all conditions examined the rate of Ca 2 + efflux induced by A 23187 was much slower than the rate of phenylephrine-induced Ca 2 + efflux, although the <b>net</b> <b>amounts</b> of Ca 2 + effluxed were similar for both agents.

40|$|The {{terrestrial}} {{distribution of}} U, Th, and K abundances governs the thermal evolution, traces the differentiation, and reflects the bulk {{composition of the}} earth. Comparing the bulk earth composition to chondritic meteorites estimates the <b>net</b> <b>amounts</b> of these radiogenic heat-producing elements available for partitioning to the crust, mantle, and core. Core formation enriches the abundances of refractory lithophile elements, including U and Th, in the silicate earth by 1. 5. Global removal of volatile elements potentially increases this enrichment to 2. 8. The K content of the silicate earth follows from the ratio of K to U. Variable enrichment produces a range of possible heat-producing element abundances in the silicate earth. A model assesses the essentially fixed amounts of U, Th, and K in the approximately closed crust reservoir. Subtracting these sequestered crustal amounts from the variable amounts in the silicate earth results {{in a range of}} possible mantle allocations, leaving global dynamics and thermal evolution poorly constrained. Terrestrial antineutrinos from β-emitting daughter nuclei in the U and Th decay series traverse the earth with negligible attenuation. The rate at which large subsurface instruments observe these geo-neutrinos depends on the distribution of U and Th relative to the detector. Geo-neutrino observations with sensitivity to U and Th in the mantle are able to estimate silicate earth enrichment, leading to a more complete understanding of the origin, accretion, differentiation, and thermal history of the planet.
