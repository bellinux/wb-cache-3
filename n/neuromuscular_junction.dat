5|$|In normal neuromuscular function, a {{nerve impulse}} is carried down the axon (the long {{projection}} of a nerve cell) from the spinal cord. At the nerve ending in the <b>neuromuscular</b> <b>junction,</b> where the impulse {{is transferred to}} the muscle cell, the nerve impulse leads {{to the opening of}} voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCC), the influx of calcium ions into the nerve terminal, and the calcium-dependent triggering of synaptic vesicle fusion with plasma membrane. These synaptic vesicles contain acetylcholine, which is released into the synaptic cleft and stimulates the acetylcholine receptors on the muscle. The muscle then contracts.|$|E
5|$|Lambert–Eaton myasthenic {{syndrome}} (LEMS) {{is a rare}} autoimmune disorder {{characterized by}} muscle weakness of the limbs. It {{is the result of}} an autoimmune reaction in which antibodies are formed against presynaptic voltage-gated calcium channels, and likely other nerve terminal proteins, in the <b>neuromuscular</b> <b>junction</b> (the connection between nerves and the muscle that they supply). The prevalence is 3.4 cases per million. Around 60% of those with LEMS have an underlying malignancy, most commonly small-cell lung cancer; it is therefore regarded as a paraneoplastic syndrome (a condition that arises as a result of cancer elsewhere in the body).|$|E
5|$|The muscle {{weakness}} and {{increased risk of}} irregular heart beat in TPP result from markedly reduced levels of potassium in the bloodstream. Potassium is not in fact lost from the body, but increased Na+/K+-ATPase activity (the enzyme that moves potassium into cells and keeps sodium in the blood) leads to shift of potassium into tissues, and depletes the circulation. In other types of potassium derangement, the acid-base balance is usually disturbed, with metabolic alkalosis and metabolic acidosis often being present. In TPP, these disturbances are generally absent. Hypokalemia leads to hyperpolarization of muscle cells, making the <b>neuromuscular</b> <b>junction</b> less responsive to normal nerve impulses and leading to decreased contractility of the muscles.|$|E
40|$|Regeneration of <b>neuromuscular</b> <b>junctions</b> after trauma {{occurs in}} an orderly way and relies on {{communication}} between nerve and muscle. This paper summarizes evidence that factors which direct the growth and differentiation of both pre- and postsynaptic components of regenerating <b>neuromuscular</b> <b>junctions</b> {{are associated with the}} extracellular matrix of muscles...|$|R
40|$|Agrin {{is thought}} to mediate the motor neuron-induced {{aggregation}} of synaptic proteins {{on the surface of}} muscle fibers at <b>neuromuscular</b> <b>junctions.</b> Recent experiments provide direct evidence in support of this hypothesis, reveal the nature of agrin immunoreactivity at sites other than <b>neuromuscular</b> <b>junctions,</b> and have resulted in findings that are consistent with the possibility that agrin plays a role in synaptogenesis throughout the nervous system. ...|$|R

5|$|The {{vagus nerve}} is a long, {{wandering}} nerve {{that emerges from}} the brainstem and provides parasympathetic stimulation to {{a large number of}} organs in the thorax and abdomen, including the heart. The nerves from the sympathetic trunk emerge through the T1-T4 thoracic ganglia and travel to both the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes, {{as well as to the}} atria and ventricles. The ventricles are more richly innervated by sympathetic fibers than parasympathetic fibers. Sympathetic stimulation causes the release of the neurotransmitter norepinephrine (also known as noradrenaline) at the <b>neuromuscular</b> <b>junction</b> of the cardiac nerves. This shortens the repolarization period, thus speeding the rate of depolarization and contraction, which results in an increased heart rate. It opens chemical or ligand-gated sodium and calcium ion channels, allowing an influx of positively charged ions. Norepinephrine binds to the beta–1 receptor.|$|E
5|$|Gerald D. Fischbach (born November 15, 1938) is an American neuroscientist. He {{received}} his M.D. from the Weill Cornell Medical College of Cornell University in 1965 before beginning his research {{career at the}} National Institutes of Health in 1966, where his research focused on the mechanisms of neuromuscular junctions. After his tenure at the National Institutes of Health, Fischbach was a professor at Harvard University Medical School from 1972–1981 and 1990–1998 and the Washington University School of Medicine from 1981–1990. In 1998, he was named {{the director of the}} National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke before becoming the Vice President and Dean of the Health and Biomedical Sciences, the Dean of the Faculty of Medicine, and the Dean of the Faculty of Health Sciences at Columbia University from 2001–2006. Gerald Fischbach currently serves as the scientific director overseeing the Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative. Throughout Fischbach's career, much of his research has focused on the formation and function of the <b>neuromuscular</b> <b>junction,</b> which stemmed from his innovative use of cell culture to study synaptic mechanisms.|$|E
5|$|The nerve {{dysfunction}} in Guillain–Barré {{syndrome is}} caused by an immune attack on the nerve cells of the peripheral nervous system and their support structures. The nerve cells have their body (the soma) in the spinal cord and a long projection (the axon) that carries electrical nerve impulses to the <b>neuromuscular</b> <b>junction</b> where the impulse is transferred to the muscle. Axons are wrapped in a sheath of Schwann cells that contain myelin. Between Schwann cells are gaps (nodes of Ranvier) where the axon is exposed. Different types of Guillain–Barré syndrome feature different types of immune attack. The demyelinating variant (AIDP, see below) features damage to the myelin sheath by white blood cells (T lymphocytes and macrophages); this process is preceded by activation {{of a group of}} blood proteins known as complement. In contrast, the axonal variant is mediated by IgG antibodies and complement against the cell membrane covering the axon without direct lymphocyte involvement.|$|E

5|$|Fischbach {{began his}} {{research}} {{career at the}} National Institutes of Health, where {{he served as a}} senior surgeon at the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) before becoming a fellow at the National Institute of Child Health from 1966 to 1973. Much of Fischbach’s research concentrated on the mechanisms controlling action potentials and synapses, from which he pioneered the use of neuron and muscle cell culture to study neuromuscular junctions. Fischbach used this technique to reconstruct neuromuscular junctions from dissociated spinal cord and muscle cells from chick embryos to show that functional synaptic connections reformed and were capable of sending spontaneous or induced action potentials. However, cultures containing isolated spinal cord cells were unable to send similar action potentials. This technique proved to be an important model for further studies to determine the essential mechanisms controlling <b>neuromuscular</b> <b>junction</b> development and maintenance. Towards the end of his tenure at the National Institutes of Health, Fischbach began to search for motor neuron molecules responsible for regulating the number of acetylcholine receptors on postsynaptic cells. This research project culminated in 1993 with the isolation of the ARIA (acetylcholine receptor inducing activity) protein, which {{is a member of the}} neuregulin family and is responsible for stimulating the production of acetylcholine receptors in postsynaptic muscle tissue.|$|E
25|$|Diseases that impair {{signaling}} between α-MNs and extrafusal muscle fibers, namely {{diseases of}} the <b>neuromuscular</b> <b>junction</b> have similar signs to those that occur with α-MN disease. For example, myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disease that prevents signaling across the <b>neuromuscular</b> <b>junction,</b> which results in functional denervation of muscle.|$|E
25|$|The axon of an α-MN {{connects with}} its extrafusal muscle fiber via a <b>neuromuscular</b> <b>junction,</b> a {{specialized}} type of chemical synapse that differs both in {{structure and function}} from the chemical synapses that connect neurons to each other. Both types of synapses rely on neurotransmitters to transduce the electrical signal into a chemical signal and back. One way they differ is that synapses between neurons typically use glutamate or GABA as their neurotransmitters, while the <b>neuromuscular</b> <b>junction</b> uses acetylcholine exclusively. Acetylcholine is sensed by nicotinic acetylcholine receptors on extrafusal muscle fibers, causing their contraction.|$|E
40|$|Acetylcholinesterase is {{the enzyme}} that terminates {{neurotransmission}} by hydrolyzing the acetylcholine {{released by the}} motoneurons at the <b>neuromuscular</b> <b>junctions.</b> Although acetylcholinesterase has been studied for almost a century, the underlying relationship between exercise-induced fatigue and acetylcholinesterase activity at the synaptic cleft is not clear. The {{purpose of this study}} was to assess the effects of exercise-induced fatigue on the expression and activity of acetylcholinesterase at the <b>neuromuscular</b> <b>junctions.</b> The expression and activity of acetylcholinesterase at the gastrocnemius <b>neuromuscular</b> <b>junctions</b> was decreased transiently by exercise-induced fatigue and then gradually increased over 24 hr. The expression of acetylcholinesterase in the 24 hr recovery group returned to the level of the control (non-exercised) group, but the activity of acetylcholinesterase remained significantly lower. These data suggest that the decrease of acetylcholinesterase expression and activity may be involved in the production and/or maintenance of exercise-induced fatigue...|$|R

The muscle fiber is of the banded myofibril type; with paired mitochondria and abundant endoplasmic reticulum. The peripheral nerve branches are multiaxonal with large central axon and several small peripheral tunicated axons. Tracheoblasts closely accompany the nerve branches. The multiple <b>neuromuscular</b> <b>junctions</b> show typical axonal vesicles, muscle aposynaptic granules, and close plasma membrane apposition with no interposition of basement membrane material...|$|R
40|$|Clustering of {{acetylcholine}} receptors (AChR) at the post-synaptic membrane is {{a crucial}} step {{in the development of}} <b>neuromuscular</b> <b>junctions</b> (NMJ). During development and after denervation, aneural AChR clusters form on the sarcolemma. Recent studies suggest that these receptors are critical for guiding and initiating synaptogenesis. The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate the effect of agrin and laminin- 1; agents with known AChR clustering activity; on NMJ formation and muscle maturation. Primary myoblasts were differentiated in vitro on collagen, laminin or collagen and laminin-coated surfaces in the presence or absence of agrin and laminin. The pre-treated cells were then subject to innervation by PC 12 cells. The number of <b>neuromuscular</b> <b>junctions</b> was assessed by immunocytochemical co-localization of AChR clusters and the pre-synaptic marker synaptophysin. Functional <b>neuromuscular</b> <b>junctions</b> were quantitated by analysis of the level of spontaneous as well as neuromuscular blocker responsive contractile activity and muscle maturation was assessed by the degree of myotube striation. Agrin alone did not prime muscle for innervation while a combination of agrin and laminin pre-treatment increased the number of <b>neuromuscular</b> <b>junctions</b> formed and enhanced acetylcholine based neurotransmission and myotube striation. This study has direct clinical relevance for treatment of denervation injuries and creating functional neuromuscular constructs for muscle tissue repair...|$|R

25|$|Myasthenia gravis is a {{neuromuscular disease}} leading to {{fluctuating}} muscle weakness and fatigability during simple activities.

Methods: The rats with lumbar nerve root compression were given Yiqi Huayu Recipe for 10, 20 and 30 days respectively. The distribution of N-CAM in <b>neuromuscular</b> <b>junctions</b> of soleus muscle in rats was examined with immunohistochemical method and confocal laser scanning microscopy technique. The acetylcholine receptor (AChR) was visualized with fluorescein-conjugated α-bungarotoxin (α-BTX). The overlap areas of N-CAM and AChR sites were measured with NIH image technique. Results: The aggregates, sprouts and extensions of N-CAM in the <b>neuromuscular</b> <b>junctions</b> and the overlap areas of N-CAM and AChR sites in the Yiqi Huayu Recipe-treated group were all better improved than those in the untreated group.

40|$|Electrophysiological and {{pharmacological}} properties of <b>neuromuscular</b> <b>junctions</b> formed in tissue culture between chick ciliary ganglia and chick skeletal muscle cells have been studied. Functional <b>neuromuscular</b> <b>junctions</b> are formed already within 24 h. No functional acetylcholine (ACh) esterase is present at these endplates. The neurites conduct action potentials to the <b>neuromuscular</b> <b>junctions,</b> where EPPs are generated. Tetrodotoxin (TTX) blocks this nerve conduction {{but in the}} presence of TTX MEPP-like potentials remain whose amplitudes are lowered when the Mg 2 +/Ca 2 + ratio in the medium is raised. It is speculated that these large TTX-resistant potentials are multiquantal. The relatively high resting membrane potential in non innervated muscle fibers was not changed by innervation. ACh-sensitivity was determined by iontophoretical application of ACh to the myotubes. Non-innervated myotubes exhibited an evenly distributed ACh-sensitivity. Local differences in ACh-sensitivity were always gradual and never exceeded a factor of 3. Innervation did not alter the overall ACh-sensitivity, but on functionally innervated muscle cells loci hypersensitive to ACh were found. Hypersensitivity was located within sharply defined areas. Apparently the para-sympathetic neurons of the ciliary ganglion are able to form functional <b>neuromuscular</b> <b>junctions</b> with skeletal muscle cells in tissue culture and to induce the formation of regions of high ACh-sensitivity.
