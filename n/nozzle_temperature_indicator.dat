A gas mixture of H 2 : N 2 = 2. 8 : 1. 5 in volume at a total flow rate of 4. 3 slm {{was used as the}} propellant with an input power fixed at 860 W. The time-dependent thrust, <b>nozzle</b> <b>temperature</b> and inlet pressure of the propellant were measured simultaneously.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Dissolution {{pressure}} and <b>nozzle</b> <b>temperature</b> effects on particle size and distribution were investigated for RESS (Rapid Expansion of Supercritical Solution) process. Supercritical CO 2 {{was used as}} solvent and Ibuprofen was applied as the model component in all runs. The resulting Ibuprofen nano-particles (about 50 nm in optimized runs) were analyzed by SEM and laser diffraction particle size analyzer systems. Results show that in low supercritical pressure ranges, depending on the solvent and solid component properties (Lower than 105 bar for Ibuprofen-CO 2 system), <b>nozzle</b> <b>temperature</b> should be {{as low as possible}} (80 - 90 ˚C for Ibuprofen-CO 2 system). In the other hand in high supercritical pressure ranges (above 105 bar), high <b>nozzle</b> <b>temperatures</b> work better. The border line of these two areas depends on the solvent phase behavior. Rapid Expansion of Supercritical Solution into a liquid solvent (RESOLV) was also studied with and without the presence of surfactant and compared with RESS process by measuring of formed particles size, size distribution and dissolution rate. Results show that the RESS process generally creates better conditions for achieving fine and uniform organic powders (with mean particles siz...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{relationship}} between temperature and mortality has been explored {{for decades and}} many <b>temperature</b> <b>indicators</b> have been applied separately. However, few data are available {{to show how the}} effects of different <b>temperature</b> <b>indicators</b> on different mortality categories, particularly in a typical subtropical climate. OBJECTIVE: To assess the associations between various <b>temperature</b> <b>indicators</b> and different mortality categories in Brisbane, Australia during 1996 - 2004. METHODS: We applied two methods to assess the threshold and <b>temperature</b> <b>indicator</b> for each age and death groups: mean temperature and the threshold assessed from all cause mortality was used for all mortality categories; the specific <b>temperature</b> <b>indicator</b> and the threshold for each mortality category were identified separately according to the minimisation of AIC. We conducted polynomial distributed lag non-linear model to identify effect estimates in mortality with one degree of temperature increase (or decrease) above (or below) the threshold on current days and lagged effects using both methods. RESULTS: Akaike's Information Criterion was minimized when mean temperature was used for all non-external deaths and deaths from 75 to 84 years; when minimum temperature was used for deaths from 0 to 64 years, 65 - 74 years, ≥ 85 years, and from the respiratory diseases; when maximum temperature was used for deaths from cardiovascular diseases. The effect estimates using certain <b>temperature</b> <b>indicators</b> were similar as mean temperature both for current day and lag effects. CONCLUSION: Different age groups and death categories were sensitive to different <b>temperature</b> <b>indicators.</b> However, the effect estimates from certain <b>temperature</b> <b>indicators</b> did not significantly differ from those of mean temperature...|$|R

40|$|The {{primary goal}} of the USAF JP- 8 + 100 thermal {{stability}} additive (TSA) program {{is to increase the}} heat-sink capacity of JP- 8 fuel by 50 %. Current engine design is limited by a fuel <b>nozzle</b> <b>temperature</b> of 325 °F (163 °C); JP- 8 + 100 has been designed to allow a 100 °F increase in <b>nozzle</b> <b>temperatures</b> up to 425 °F (218 °C) without serious fuel degradation leading to excessive deposition. Previous studies have shown that TSA formulations increase the electrical conductivity of base jet fuel.

The most described are <b>temperature</b> <b>indicators</b> which the authors of papers study most frequently. Also the precipitation forms a separate chapter, while other elements are all summarized in one chapter, because there are not that many studies about them. The average annual temperature and precipitation trends calculated for Europe or the world were similar to those in Central Europe. As for the <b>temperature</b> <b>indicators,</b> during the 2 nd half of the 20 th century warming was found in most cases and insignificant trends prevailed for precipitation indicators. Among the seasonal changes in climate, autumn stood out. Its trends were in some cases (especially for <b>temperature</b> <b>indicators)</b> different from the other seasons. Whilst there is warming in Central Europe in spring, summer and winter, it cools in autumn. Keywords: climate elements, long-term changes, Central Europe, autum...|$|R
