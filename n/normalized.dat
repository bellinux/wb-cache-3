According to the World Meteorological Organization, “recent increase in societal impact from tropical cyclones has largely been caused by rising concentrations of population and infrastructure in coastal regions.” Pielke et al. (2008) <b>normalized</b> mainland U.S. hurricane damage from 1900–2005 to 2005 values and found no remaining trend of increasing absolute damage. The 1970s and 1980s were notable because of the extremely low amounts of damage compared to other decades. The decade 1996–2005 has the second most damage among the past 11 decades, with only the decade 1926–1935 surpassing its costs.

After welding, the components have to be submitted to a <b>normalizing</b> heat treatment in order to recover its original mechanical properties. In this work four different low alloy steel weld metals (WM) both in the as welded condition and after <b>normalizing</b> heat treatment have been studied.

30|$|Our goal is {{estimating}} the <b>normalizing</b> constant 1 /c_π via Monte Carlo simulation, when λ= 0 and ν= 2. In general, {{it is difficult}} to estimate a <b>normalizing</b> constant using MCMC outputs [2, 58, 59]. However, in the sticky MCMC algorithms (with update rules as R 1 and R 3 in Table  2), the <b>normalizing</b> constant of the adaptive non-parametric proposal approaches the <b>normalizing</b> constant of the target. We compare AISM-P 4 -R 3 and different Multiple-try Metropolis (MTM) schemes. For the MTM schemes, we use the following procedure: given the MTM outputs obtained in one run, we use these samples as nodes, then construct the approximated function using the construction P 4 (considering these nodes), and finally compute the <b>normalizing</b> constant of this approximated function. Note that we use the same construction procedure P 4, for a fair comparison.|$|R
