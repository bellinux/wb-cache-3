40|$|The essay {{concerns}} issues {{connected with}} modelling of flow in a <b>non-return</b> <b>flap</b> and determination of force {{effects on the}} flap disc. The task was researched in collaboration with ARMATURY Group, a. s. The flow is non-compressible and the flow medium is water. Boundary conditions determined by a measurement were applied in the modelling. The target of the project is finding a suitable mathematical model and comparison of the measured and calculated values dissipation factor of the <b>non-return</b> <b>flap</b> for various opening angles of the flap disc...|$|E
50|$|This {{prompted}} UK Deputy Prime Minister (and Hull MP) John Prescott {{to ask the}} Marine Accident Investigation Branch of the Department for Transport {{to carry}} out extensive surveys of the wreck, which it did in 1998 and 2002. During {{the latter part of}} the underwater survey in 2002, samples of bones and other human remains were recovered from the wreck, DNA tests conducted by the Forensic Science Service established that the remains came from four of the Gauls crew. This finding quelled suspicions that the crew had been taken from the vessel by the Russians during cold war hostilities. After reviewing the factual evidence gained from the underwater surveys, the MAIB concluded that there was enough new evidence to warrant a new formal inquiry. The surveys revealed that some of Gauls hatches and doors were open and, specifically, the outer <b>non-return</b> <b>flaps</b> and the inner covers to the duff and offal waste chutes were open. Additionally, the inner cover to the duff chute appeared to be secured open and the ships steering gear (kort nozzle) was found to be full over to port. John Prescott concurred and a new investigation was launched (the 2004 Re-opened Formal Investigation (RFI)).|$|R
