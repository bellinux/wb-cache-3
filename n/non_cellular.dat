This thesis explored the use of both the conventional and unconventional techniques for modelling land use change. Two conventional methods (ordinary least squares and geographically weighted regression) were based on geographic information systems, while four unconventional methods (logistic regression, artificial neural networks, and two proposed types of support vector machine) were based on cellular automata. These techniques were evaluated using three land use epochs: 1963 - 1978, 1978 - 1984, and 1984 - 2000. The conventional methods make quite strong statistical assumptions, {{some of which are}} shown not to be met by the land use data at hand. Despite this, these methods do exhibit substantial agreement between observed and the predicted maps. The <b>non</b> <b>cellular</b> automata and cellular automata modelling were then implemented with the logistic regression, artificial neural network, support vector machine, and fuzzy support vector machine models, with model parameters set by k-fold cross-validation. The cellular automata predicted maps were more accurate than those of the <b>non</b> <b>cellular</b> automata. The cellular automata modelling results from the proposed support vector machine and fuzzy support vector machine were compared with those from the geographic information systems based geographically weighted regression, logistic regression, and artificial neural network.

40|$|Hepatocellular {{carcinoma}} (HCC) is {{the sixth}} most prevalent cancer {{and the third}} most frequent cause of cancer-related death. Unlike most solid tumors the incidence and mortality of HCC have increased in the United States and Europe in the past decade. Most patients are diagnosed at advanced stages, so there is an urgent need for new systemic therapies [1, 2]. To improve the delivery of therapeutic agents to tumor cells in vivo it’s necessary to overcome several problems, such as drug resistance at the tumor level due to physiological barriers (<b>non</b> <b>cellular</b> based mechanism), drug resistance at the cellular level (cellular mechanism), drug distribution, biotransformation and clearance of anticancer drugs in the body. At the purpose to increase selectivity of drugs towards cancer cells while reducing their toxicity towards normal tissues, a promising strategy could be to entrap antitumor drugs into colloidal nanoparticles. Nanosystems may act as drug vehicles able to target tumor tissues or cells, protecting it from premature inactivation during its transport. At the tumor level the accumulation mechanism of intravenously injected nanoparticles relies on a passive diffusion or convection across the leaky hyperpermeable tumor vasculature [3 - 5]. For the treatment of HCC several drugs are under development, but {{the only one with}} proven survival benefit is sorafenib. This agent is a multikinase inhibitor that blocks Raf signaling and VEGF, PDGF and c-Kit. It has antiproliferative and antiangiogenic activity and delays tumor progression [1, 2]. In order to produce a new colloidal system able to deliver this drug in the tumor tissue and decrease its side effects, nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) were developed using tripalmitin, Miglyol 812 and sorafenib. The obtained nanosystems were characterized in terms of size, polidispersity index, zeta potential and morphology using Scanning Electron Microscopy. Moreover, technological-pharmaceutical characterization of NLC was made. Stability studies showed that the systems were stable up to 60 days, while particle aggregation occurred after a period of storage of 90 days. Afterwards, for this reason, the same systems were prepared with the addition of two cryoprotectors (threalose and glycerol) before freezing and lyophilization. Finally, in vitro biological studies were carried out by MTS assays using human hepatocellular carcinoma HepG 2, Hep 3 B, Huh 7 and PLC/PRF/ 5 cells. Results obtained demonstrate an improved efficacy of sorafenib-loaded NLC compared to the free drug in Huh 7 cells, whereas in HepG 2 and PLC/PRF/ 5 cells sorafenib-loaded NLCs maintain an antitumor activity comparable to free drug. Considering that solid tumours present much more favourable conditions for preferential accumulation of colloidal sized drug delivery systems, sorafenib-loaded NLC can be useful for application in liver cancer therapy.

Plant tissues are very rich in proteases and interfering compounds such as secondary metabolites (Wang et al. 2008), thus comparatively to other organisms, extraction of proteins is of great challenge (Görg et al. 2004;Isaacson et al. 2006). Two protocols, TCA-acetone and phenol, are generally used with some optimization related to the specific tissue, in function of the amounts of indigenous contaminants (organic acids, lipids, polyphenols, pigments or terpenes among others). The TCA-acetone protocol was initially developed by Damerval et al. (1986) {{and is based on}} protein denaturation and precipitation under acidic/hydrophobic conditions, which help to concentrate proteins and remove contaminants (Wang et al. 2008). Up to date, this is the most used protocol for protein extraction from plant tissues for proteomic analysis (Jorrín et al. 2007;Jorrín-Novo et al. 2009). For recalcitrant tissues, the phenol-based method has the potential to generate samples of higher purity than TCA-acetone, as compounds such as polysaccharides and other water-soluble contaminants are separated from the proteins that are solubilized in the phenolic layer (Hurkman and Tanaka 1986).|$|R

Altered signaltransduction as caused by overexpression, mutations or autokrine stimulation of protein kinases is interrelated with a multitude of pathophysiological processes {{in the development and}} the spreading of tumors. Recently kinase inhibitors have been developed to mediate cancers through inhibition of the kinase activity of c-Abl and c-Src. Previously the research team of Prof. Borlak has demonstrated that overexpression of c-myc/c-raf in a double transgenic mouse model results in the development of <b>non</b> small <b>cellular</b> lung carcinoma. From these transgenic tumors progenitor cells were isolated and used to study experimental c-Src and c-Abl dual kinase inhibitors. A screening based on the determination of mitochondrial reductase activity, fluorescence activated cell sorting as well as the detection of reactive oxygen allowed a classification of the kinase inhibitors. Five of theses inhibitors were characterised in more detail by the detection of caspase- 3 / 7 -activity, gene expression analyses and immunoblots. Two of these experimental dual kinase inhibitors were used in Microarray experiments to optain in depth information of gene regulatory net workes.

40|$|Actin {{polymerization}} is {{a fundamental}} cellular process regulating immune cell functions and the immune response. The Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASp) is an actin nucleation promoting factor, which is exclusively expressed in hematopoietic cells, where it plays a key regulatory role in cytoskeletal dynamics. WASp interacting protein (WIP) was first discovered as the binding partner of WASp, {{through the use of}} the yeast two hybrid system. WIP was later identified as a chaperone of WASp, necessary for its stability. Mutations occurring at the WASp homology 1 domain (WH 1), which serves as the WIP binding site, were found to cause the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) and X-linked thrombocytopenia (XLT). WAS manifests as an immune deficiency characterized by eczema, thrombocytopenia, recurrent infections, and hematopoietic malignancies, demonstrating the importance of WIP for WASp complex formation and for a proper immune response. WIP deficiency was found to lead to different abnormalities in the activity of various lymphocytes, suggesting differential cell-dependent roles for WIP. Additionally, WIP deficiency causes cellular abnormalities not found in WASp-deficient cells, indicating that WIP fulfills roles beyond stabilizing WASp. Indeed, WIP was shown to interact with various binding partners, including the signaling proteins Nck, CrkL and cortactin. Recent studies have demonstrated that WIP also takes part in <b>non</b> immune <b>cellular</b> processes such as cancer invasion and metastasis, in addition to cell subversion by intracellular pathogens.

The immune system during pregnancy and the exchange of immunity from mother to newborn are unique events in immunological physiology. The peripartum hormonal changes contribute to impaired immune function. The physical and metabolic stresses of pregnancy, calving and lactation contribute to the decrease of host resistance and the subsequent increase in disease incidence. Pregnancy and peripartum period result in nonspecific immunosuppression of the dairy cow. The magnitude and timing of this reduction depend on many factors such as not adequate hygienic and sanitary management, not appropriate feed and housing and genetic differences.

The non etiolated hypocotyls of both varieties showed a significantly higher percentage of callus induction compared to the etiolated ones.

40|$|The {{enhancement}} of existing {{and development of}} new nanoparticular probes is a promising field of research, emanating from the increasing demand on nanoparticular contrast agents for luminescence and CT imaging. The first developed system is an ultra small inorganic semiconductor based nanoparticle with unique optical properties, ranging from size tunable emission to very high photostability. The second investigated nanoparticulate system is a lot less prominent {{on the field of}} molecular imaging till now. Nevertheless, the inherent properties of gadolinium oxide nanoparticles are as unique as those of the quantum dots. These nanoparticles are not only applicable in fluorescence imaging, but open up the way to combined multi-modal imaging and therapy. Following this evolution, herein, an organometallic synthesis for long-wavelength emitting quantum dots with an effective surface passivation of the semiconductor core was developed. The synthesis parameters were optimized with respect to the emission wavelength and quantum yield. Moreover the most prominent influence factors could be dedicated. The further modification of these particles rendering them water-soluble was achieved using different surface ligands. The developed procedure allowed the preparation of long-term stable, water-soluble quantum dots in a simple ligand exchange reaction. Furthermore, it could be shown that the coated nanocrystals have very small diameters of sub- 10 nm. Moreover, the functionalization of the nanocrystal surface with amino groups, and therefore the prerequisite for further modification with e. g. targeting functions, was achieved. Furthermore, a way to tune the amount of amino ligands, and hence, functionizable groups on the surface was developed. The examination of the cytotoxicity of as well the quantum dots, the ligands, as free cadmium ions, showed that the observed toxicity {{can be attributed to the}} attached ligands, and not to the released cadmium ions. However, the tested dilutions of quantum dots exceeded the usually applied ones about three orders of magnitude, suggesting that the quantum dots can be regarded as <b>non</b> toxic for <b>cellular</b> experiments. Therefore, this preparation method turned out to be an easy way to stable biocompatible and functionizable quantum dots for biomedical applications. Concerning the second nanoparticulate system, two different routes were applied o synthesize those particles. One route yields bigger particles for CT contrast agent use only, the other synthesis procedure leads to particles for bimodal fluorescence- and CT-imaging. The “polyol” mediated synthesis yielded nanoparticles of bigger sizes. However, the coating step was already included into the particle formation. Herein, four ligands giving different particle properties were applied. All those particle species were investigated in terms stability after high pressure homogenization, freeze drying and redispersion in different media, to fabricate a stable, storable and redisperable powder for CT imaging applications. One of those as-coated nanoparticle systems was investigated in an animal experiment, resulting in very good contrast properties in vivo. The precipitation synthesis, on the other hand, gave smaller nanoparticles with very good luminescent properties. The luminescence was achieved by doping the nanocrystals with different lanthanide elements, yielding blue, green and red emission wavelengths. The parameters for optimal doping amount and annealing temperature were investigated. Moreover, the influence of the reaction time, reducing agent concentration and overall concentration on the nanoparticle size was studied. Therefore, highly luminescent and, independently size tunable, particles could be successfully prepared. The coating of these nanocrystals was achieved using a bisphosphonate functionalized PEG ligand, giving very good stabilization against aggregation of the particles. These coated particles were applied in an in vitro CT experiment, testing the X-ray attenuation of the nanocrystals in aqueous environment. This resulted in a very good CT contrast of about 60 HU per milligram of gadolinium. The testing of the cytotoxicity of all coated particles proved that there is no observable toxicity. Therefore, a successful preparation of stable, biocompatible, size-tunable, luminescence-tunable and CT active nanoparticles was achieved. ...|$|R
