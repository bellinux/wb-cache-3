In keeping with the thrust to rebuild the country following the 2010 earthquake and earlier 2004 political crisis, work has also continued on preparing Haiti to participate effectively in the CSME. It is being assisted in its preparations by the Secretariat, led by the CARICOM Representation Office in Haiti (CROH) which was re-opened in 2007 with funding from the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA). The CROH, in 2007 started the Haiti CSME Project, the objective of which [...] was to assist the Government of Haiti in accelerating its participation in the CSME as a means of enabling Haiti to fully re-engage in the process of regional integration in the Caribbean Community.|$|E

The CROH, in 2007 started the Haiti CSME Project, the objective of which was to assist the Government of Haiti in accelerating its participation in the CSME as a means of enabling Haiti to fully re-engage in the process of regional integration in the Caribbean Community. [...] As a first step towards the CSME, Haiti was due to enter the trade in goods regime of the Single Market in January 2010 (earlier targets had been for some time in 2009) but could not do so because of the earthquake. Up until that point much work had been done by CROH and its Haitian government counterpart, the Bureau de Coordination et de Suivi or BCS (Office of Coordination and Monitoring), on the technical work necessary to bring the Haitian national tariff in line with the Caricom Common External Tariff (CET). The next step that had to be taken for Haiti to commence full free trade in goods within the CSME was therefore for the Haitian Parliament to pass legislation adopting the Caricom External tariff as Haiti’s national tariff. In mid 2009, the Government of Haiti announced that it would be ready to participate fully in free trade in goods within the CSME by 1 January 2010; and in fact through a revised Custom Act adopted by the Haitian Parliament in late 2009, 20-30% of the Caricom CET was incorporated into the Haitian national tariff. However soon after Haiti's progress towards full adoption of the CET began to stall with the dismissal of the Government of Prime Minister Michèle Pierre-Louis in November 2009 and was then put on hold {{as a result of the}} January 2010 earthquake. To assist in stimulating economic activity, the Council for Trade and Economic Development (COTED) in December, approved a request for some Haitian products to be exported within the Single Market on a non-reciprocal preferential basis for three years. Consultations are on-going towards approval of additional items from an original list which Haiti submitted. The concession became effective from 1 January 2011. CARICOM Secretariat officials are continuing their training exercises with Haitian customs officials to facilitate their understanding of the CSME’s trading regime.|$|E

It first analyses the constitutional constraints which have to be observed in the member states, distinguishing between ratification according to ordinary legislative procedure and according to a special procedure, the possibility to chose between a parliamentary authorisation or a referendum, the possibility of judicial review of the constitutionality <b>of</b> <b>ratification</b> and {{the powers of the}} Head of State. It then examines more deeply the different procedures followed for the authorisation <b>of</b> <b>ratification,</b> the referenda which took place or were foreseen and the delays in ratification, as well as the decisions of constitutional courts and the constitutional amendments adopted in view <b>of</b> <b>ratification</b> <b>of</b> the Constitution for Europe. The paper concludes with an appraisal of the so-called 'period of reflection' and the reactions in member states...|$|R

40|$|The Pacific {{region has}} the lowest {{regional}} rate <b>of</b> <b>ratification</b> <b>of</b> international human rights treaties in the world. There is currently considerable pressure on Pacific Island states from various quarters to ratify the core human rights treaties.

This paper explores whether ratifying human rights treaties is a useful way to advance the cause of human rights in the Pacific. Part I of the paper takes a current “snapshot” <b>of</b> the <b>ratification</b> project in the Pacific by setting out the current levels <b>of</b> <b>ratification,</b> looking at the reasons for low ratification, and noting the recent calls for greater ratification. Part II sets out the key consequences for states of ratifying international human rights treaties, and then looks at the benefits and drawbacks <b>of</b> <b>ratification.</b> In light <b>of</b> this context, Part III considers strategies Pacific states might adopt in responding to the call for ratification...|$|R

50|$|In a state's legislature, the {{ratification}} method is procedurally simple - merely propose a resolution, memorial, or proclamation <b>of</b> <b>ratification</b> and vote {{it up or}} down in each chamber of that state legislature. But using the convention method <b>of</b> <b>ratification</b> {{is a bit more}} complicated because it is, by necessity, separate and different from a state legislature. As early as the 1930s, state lawmakers enacted laws to prepare for the possibility of Congress specifying the convention method <b>of</b> <b>ratification.</b> Many laws refer to a one-off event, with an ad-hoc convention convened solely {{for the purposes of the}} 21st amendment. Other laws, however, provided guidelines for ratifying conventions in general.|$|R

My work is based on concept saying that foreign policy of Czech Republic and Slovakia was given by domestic and foreign policy factors. 1 In Slovakia it was mainly the determination to change suverenistic foreign policy of former prime ministr Vladimír Mečiar. On the other hand in Czech Republic politics were convinced that Czech Republic belongs to Europe and so they can dare to criticize EU's decisions. After analysis of stances of all important political parties in both countries, I can conclude, that concept I am using, is applicable also to the process <b>of</b> <b>ratification,</b> and therefore it was also the main reasons of different lenght and complexity <b>of</b> <b>ratification.</b> 1 Petr Drulák, Michal Kořan a Jan Růžička, "Außenpolitik in Ostmitteleuropa", Osteuropa 58 (červenec 2008) : 139 - 152...|$|R
