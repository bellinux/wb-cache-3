It is based on Spread Out Bragg Peak entrance dose measurement with alanine detectors. The entrance dose is well correlated with the dose at the facility isocenter, where, during the therapeutic irradiation, the tumour is placed. The unique alanine detector features namely keeping the dose record in a form of stable radiation induced free radicals trapped in the material structure, and the <b>non</b> <b>destructive</b> <b>read</b> out makes this type of detector {{a good candidate for}} additional documentation of the patient s exposure over the therapy cours...|$|E

40|$|<b>Non</b> <b>destructive</b> test {{systems are}} {{increasingly}} {{applied in the}} industrial context for their strong potentialities in improving and standardizing quality control. Especially in the intermediate manufacturing stages, early detection of defects on semi-finished products allow their direction towards later production processes according to their quality, with consequent considerable savings in time, energy, materials and work. However, the raw data coming from <b>non</b> <b>destructive</b> test systems are not always immediately suitable for sophisticated defect detection algorithms, due to noise and disturbances which are unavoidable, especially in harsh operating conditions, {{such as the ones}} which are typical of the steelmaking cycle.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} experimental tests {{carried out}} on steel fibre reinforced concrete samples, including mechanical tests {{as well as with}} <b>non</b> <b>destructive</b> techniques: electrical resistivity and X-ray. Samples are round panels poured in the laboratory in different ways in order to influence the fibre distribution. Electrical resistivity measurements are done as a blind test, to characterise the electrical anisotropy and deduce the orientation of fibres. These results are compared to X-Ray imaging to check the quality of <b>non</b> <b>destructive</b> evaluation. Then, mechanical tests are done to assess the influence of fibres distribution on concrete properties. Flexural and compressive strength are measured on specimens. The influence of fibres orientation is clearly shown. <b>Non</b> <b>destructive</b> characterisation of samples allows the fibres distribution in the concrete to be determined. The influence of this parameter is also clearly shown by the mechanical approach. Résumé Les travaux présentés dans cet article portent sur une campagne expérimentale visant...|$|R
