5|$|Æthelred usually {{acted with}} the {{permission}} of or in association with King Alfred, but occasionally he acted independently of him. Although sometimes described as plain dux or ealdorman, his status was clearly quite different from that of other duces, for he is also accorded styles which aspire to divine grace and which appear to verge on the royal. In other words, there is <b>no</b> <b>mistaking</b> that the Mercians retained a conception of their ruler as a rightful successor to earlier kings, and a conception of their land as a kingdom with its own identity; but there is also <b>no</b> <b>mistaking</b> that Æthelred moved in an Alfredian world.|$|E
500|$|Hischak {{described}} the original cast album as [...] "surprisingly lively and mostly enjoyable for a musical {{that was considered}} so dull on stage." [...] He pointed to [...] "Intermission Talk" [...] as a number which probably works better in a recording than on stage and states that [...] "there is <b>no</b> <b>mistaking</b> the hypnotic power of 'No Other Love'". The original cast recording was released on compact disc in 1993.|$|E

Naman Ramachandran {{considered}} Rajinikanth's Kali an effective {{portrayal of a}} challenging, complex character. He praised Balu Mahendra's cinematography, especially his use of natural light. In December 2014, Gautaman Bhaskaran of the Hindustan Times wrote: [...] "On watching [...] recently, there was <b>no</b> <b>mistaking</b> the brilliance of [...] acting ability. In both, he essays shades of deep grey, and yet there was something captivating about Rajinikanth." ...|$|E

The lyrics are unwieldy and uncouth. That's what happens when you're not a boy, but not yet a man: One Direction can't go straight from the G-rated sweetness of “What Makes You Beautiful” to something akin to Enrique Iglesias's [...] "Tonight, I’m F****** You," [...] so instead they’re stuck with this in between clumsiness that the not-so-little girls will understand." [...] Grady Smith of Entertainment Weekly characterised it as [...] "not-so-innocent" [...] and a [...] "party jam". Jason Lipshutz of Billboard felt that its sexual suggestive lyricism [...] "arrives too soon after the more accomplished puppy-love odes of previous hits [...] "What Makes You Beautiful" [...] and [...] "One Thing" [...] to further the conversation." ...|$|E
500|$|In February 2013, Daniel Kilkelly from Digital Spy {{reported}} that Chris {{would be shocked}} when he realises that Scotty Boland (Rhys Uhlich) [...] "may have a romantic interest in him." [...] During a charity camp-out, which has been organised by Scotty's girlfriend, Georgia (Saskia Hampele), Scotty visits Chris' tent and says something that makes Chris believe he is making a move on him. Mason commented that the storyline has [...] "a serious side" [...] because everyone believes Scotty is straight, especially his girlfriend. However, he added {{that there would be}} some funny moments in the lead up to the big revelation. Not long after the camp-out incident, Scotty lets his attraction to Chris get the better of him and he tries to kiss Chris. Uhlich explained [...] "There's <b>no</b> <b>mistaking</b> this as Scotty hitting on Chris. He's really put it out there now, but Chris doesn't go for it. So he kicks Scotty out of the house, but even then Scotty doesn't realise what the kiss means." [...] A shocked Chris then confides in his housemate, Kyle Canning (Chris Milligan), about the kiss and they decide that they need to tell Georgia about it. However, they soon learn that Scotty has proposed to Georgia and decide to remain silent to stop her from having her heart broken.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Stephen Holden from The New York Times, Madonna explained {{the significance of the}} performance: [...] "Finally, right when you think I'll end [...] on a happy note, I come out with my family to do a Bob Fosse-meets-'Clockwork Orange' rendition of 'Keep It Together'. It's the show's ultimate statement about the family, because we're absolutely brutalizing with each other, while there's also <b>no</b> <b>mistaking</b> that we love each other deeply." [...] Author Lynne Layton complimented the performance, saying that [...] "as in her double attitude to materialism, femininity, and everything else, what marks the performance is not that Madonna is in control, but that she is open about {{the pros and cons of}} family life and obviously echoes the experience of many." [...] Her thoughts were shared by John LeLand from Newsday, who complimented the aerobics performed onstage by Madonna and her dancers. Conversely, author Allen Metz commented that although the performance was tightly choreographed, the overall feel was marred due to the song's own [...] "shortcomings". Greg Kot from Chicago Tribune felt that the addition of lines from [...] "Family Affair" [...] underlined the [...] "home-is-where-the-heart-is" [...] theme of [...] "Keep It Together". Louis Virtel from The Backlot praised the performance of the song, stating that it served as the [...] "perfect concluding performance." [...] Two different performances were recorded and released on video: the Blond Ambition – Japan Tour 90, filmed in Yokohama, Japan, on April 27, 1990, and the Blond Ambition World Tour Live, filmed in Nice, France, on August 5, 1990. It was also shown on the HBO special titled Madonna Live! – Blond Ambition World Tour, and was added in her 1991 documentary, [...]|$|E

2500|$|B– {{would have}} been more in keeping if he had abided by the faith of his forefathers. There is a fine scorn in his face, which nature meant to be of - Christians.

There is <b>no</b> <b>mistaking</b> him. – B– has a strong {{expression}} of sense in his countenance, and it is confirmed by his singing. The foundation of his vocal excellence is use. He sings with understanding, as Kemble delivered dialogue. He would sing the Commandments, and give an appropriate character to each prohibition.|$|E
2500|$|The album {{received}} polarizing reviews. Rock Sound {{gave the}} album an 8/10 rating, remarking that [...] "It {{may not be}} perfect, but Korn have thrown caution to the wind and set out an impressive template for a future sound, for a band doing that nearly 20 years into their career, they deserve your respect". They do note however that the album sounds [...] "a little formulaic" [...] and [...] "monotonous" [...] at times. Spin gave the album a 7/10, saying [...] "Thing is, dubstep's slithering textures actually suit Davis' demented croon". Henry Northmore from The List gave the album a rating of 4/5 saying that [...] "the purists (both metal and dubstep) will probably hate it, {{but if you are}} willing to have your brain assaulted from every direction by a new Frankensteinian metal/beats hybrid, you’ll find an album packed with pure adrenaline". Allmusic gave the album 4/5 saying that [...] "despite all the electronics, there’s <b>no</b> <b>mistaking</b> The Path of Totality as a Korn album...and one of their better ones to boot".|$|E

2500|$|By {{the time}} he came to compose his account of Malthus for The Spirit of the Age, Hazlitt had {{acquired}} perspective and achieved a more balanced view of his subject. He notes {{at the outset that}} [...] "Mr. Malthus ... attained a scientific reputation in questions of moral and political philosophy." [...] There is <b>no</b> <b>mistaking</b> what the man stands for: [...] "In weighing his merits we come at once {{to the question of what}} he has done or failed to do." [...] We know immediately that we are speaking of his [...] "'Essay on Population' [...] distinct leading proposition" [...] which [...] "has changed the aspect of political economy in a decided and material point of view": the proposition [...] "that 'the population cannot go on perpetually increasing without pressing on the limits of the means of subsistence, and that a check of some kind or other must, sooner or later, be opposed to it.' This is the essence of the doctrine which Mr. Malthus has been the first to bring into general notice, and as we think, to establish beyond the fear of contradiction." ...|$|E
2500|$|The New York Times {{said the}} closure allowed Francis {{to settle a}} {{confrontation}} started by his predecessor that [...] "created an uproar among American Catholics," [...] who energetically defended the nuns {{in the face of}} Vatican interference, signing petitions and sending letters to the Vatican. Father James Martin, who wrote frequently about the conflict as an editor of the Jesuit magazine America, said: [...] "What you see with the sisters is true courage, which is being faithful to the church authority and also to who they are." [...] On April 17, 2015, the editorial board of The New York Times editorialized that, [...] "The Vatican's misguided investigation of American Catholic nuns seemed thoroughly steeped in chauvinism from its inception three years ago by the church's male-dominated bureaucracy. Rome's move against widely respected churchwomen was puzzling and provocative in an era of scandal by male priests committing child rape and being repeatedly shielded by their male superiors....There was <b>no</b> <b>mistaking</b> the message that the reforming spirit of Francis's fresh broom had poked sharply into another corner of the Vatican. The extraordinary effort to have the Vatican take control of the sisters' main communal voice – the Leadership Conference of Women Religious – ended with none of the aggressive bombast of Rome's initial announcement of the inquiry under Francis's predecessor, Benedict XVI." ...|$|E
