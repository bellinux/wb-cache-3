5|$|At {{the time}} of formation, high clouds {{indicated}} the presence of intense convection, and the cyclone featured an axisymmetric cloud structure, with a distinct, cloud-free eye and rainbands spiraling around the disturbance as a whole. Soon thereafter, the parent low separated from the medicane entirely and continued eastward, meandering toward the Aegean Sea and Turkey. Initially remaining stationary between Greece and Sicily with a minimum atmospheric pressure of 1002mbar (29.59inHg), the newly formed system began to drift southwest-to-south in the following days, influenced by northeasterly flow incited by the initial low, now far to the east, and a high-pressure area above central and eastern Europe. The system's atmospheric pressure increased throughout 15January {{due to the fact}} it was embedded within a large-scale environment, with its rising pressure due to the general prevalence of higher air pressures throughout the region, and was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> of deintensification.|$|E

25|$|Ahmet Albayrak {{explains}} in The Qur'an: An Encyclopedia that regarding apostasy as a wrongdoing is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> of intolerance of other religions, {{and is not}} aimed at one’s freedom to choose a religion or to leave Islam and embrace another faith, but that on the contrary, it is more correct {{to say that the}} punishment is enforced as a safety precaution when warranted if apostasy becomes a mechanism of public disobedience and disorder (fitna). At this point, what is punished is the action of ridiculing the high moral flavour of Islam and posing a threat to public order.

25|$|While {{endorsing}} {{some aspects}} of Dobrogeanu-Gherea's theories regarding {{the ways in which}} serfdom was allegedly prolonged, in a discreet form, even after the 20th century, Pătrășcanu challenged his refusal to investigate the effects of capitalism in rural areas. According to Pătrășcanu, the establishment of estate leaseholders, which he viewed as the cause for the 1907 revolt and other, more minor, peasant rebellions, was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> of prolonged feudalism, but one of capitalist penetration into agriculture. Contradicting the Social Democratic ideologists Lothar Rădăceanu and Șerban Voinea (whom he accused of having lost contact with the working class), Pătrășcanu theorized that the Romanian petite bourgeoisie was shrinking under pressure from successful capitalists, while rejecting the notion that civil servants belonged to the middle class.|$|E
25|$|Contemporary {{and modern}} historians have viewed the {{creation}} of a school of medicine for women and the position of hakima as an example of modernization and reform for women under Muhammad Ali. Khaled Fahmy argues against this view. Fahmy states that, because the reasons for {{the creation of}} the school are primarily for the maintenance of a healthy army, the school was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> of reform but Ali furthering his military goals. For example, their treatment of venereal diseases was intended to curb its incidence among soldiers and smallpox vaccinations increased the pool of potential soldiers by reducing childhood mortality rate. Furthermore, the hakimas allowed for increased state control over social life. This is observed in the use of hakimas to collect statistics on childbirth, either personally or through dayas, {{as well as in the}} cases where a hakima was used to examine a woman.|$|E

25|$|Behind {{the title}} races, however, {{there were signs}} of trouble brewing in Formula One. Long-established, highly {{respected}} names like Brabham and Lotus vanished from the starting grids. French manufacturer Ligier found themselves in desperate straits, and were sold to Alain Prost. Ken Tyrrell's team foundered on, despite dismal results, until 1998, when BAR bought the team. And the colourful era of the small, private teams finally came to an end. Names like Larrousse, Dallara, Simtek, Pacific, MasterCard Lola, Life Racing Engines, March Engineering, Onyx Grand Prix, Coloni, Andrea Moda, Fondmetal, Osella, Footwork, AGS, Lambo, Leyton House Racing, EuroBrun and Forti would no longer be seen on the starting grids, with only Jordan, Sauber, Arrows and Minardi managing to survive somehow. The flourishing of Jordan in 1998 and 1999, under the leadership of Damon Hill, Heinz-Harald Frentzen and Ralf Schumacher (Michael's younger brother) proved to be a last hurrah of the privateer, <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> of health in the sport.

One suggestion is that the darkness is a deliberate inversion of the transfiguration; alternately, Jesus's earlier discourse about a future tribulation mentions the sun being darkened, and can be seen as foreshadowing this scene. Striking details such as the darkening of the sky and the tearing of the temple veil may be a way of focusing the reader away from the shame and humiliation [...] of the crucifixion; one professor of biblical theology concluded, [...] "it is clear that Jesus is not a humiliated criminal but a man of great significance.

500|$|In {{a feature}} for 1UP.com, Jeremy Parish states that many Metroid fans were {{disappointed}} by the game's story, power-up restrictions and its [...] "awkward handling of its leading lady". Video game scholar Luke Arnott argued that players were dissatisfied with Other M {{because it did not}} consistently balance gameplay constraints with player agency, and because it failed at what he calls “imperative” storytelling. Arnott suggested that studying how games like Other M create meaning in virtual spaces may help design better games and situate them within wider theories of postmodern subjectivity. Clyde Mandelin of Legends of Localization noted that the game received mixed-to-positive reactions from Japanese fans. Kotakus Luke Plunkett wrote that Team Ninja was blamed by [...] "many people" [...] for the game's story; Hayashi later clarified that Sakamoto wrote the story himself.

2500|$|Although {{many critics}} of China's {{reproductive}} restrictions {{approve of the}} policy's abolition, an Amnesty International spokesperson said that the move to the two-child policy would not end forced sterilizations, forced abortions, or government control over birth permits. Others also state that the abolition is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> of the relaxation of authoritarian control in China. A reporter for CNN said, [...] "It was <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> that the party will suddenly start respecting personal freedoms more than {{it has in the}} past. [...] No, this is a case of the party adjusting policy to conditions. ... The new policy, raising the limit to two children per couple, preserves the state's role." [...] The abolition may not achieve a significant benefit, as the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation analysis indicates: [...] "Repealing the one-child policy may not spur a huge baby boom, however, in part because fertility rates are believed to be declining even without the policy's enforcement. Previous easings of the one-child policy have spurred fewer births than expected, and many people among China's younger generations see smaller family sizes as ideal." [...] The CNN reporter adds that China's new prosperity is also a factor in the declining birth rate, saying, [...] "Couples naturally decide to have fewer children as they move from the fields into the cities, become more educated, and when women establish careers outside the home." ...|$|E

2500|$|Afw ( [...] {{is another}} term for {{forgiveness}} in Islam; it occurs 35 times in Quran, {{and in some}} Islamic theological studies, it is used interchangeably with ghufran. Afw means to pardon, to excuse for a fault or an offense. According to Muhammad Amanullah, forgiveness ('Afw) in Islam is derived from three wisdoms. First {{and the most important}} wisdom of forgiveness is that it is merciful when the victim or guardian of the victim accepts money instead of revenge. The second wisdom of forgiveness is that it increases honor and prestige of the one who forgives. Forgiveness is <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> of weakness, humiliation or dishonor. Forgiveness is honor, raises the merit of the forgiver in the eyes of Allah, and enables a forgiver to enter paradise. The third wisdom of forgiveness is that according to some scholars, such as al-Tabari and al-Qurtubi, forgiveness expiates (kaffarah) the forgiver from the sins he or she may have committed at other occasions in life. Forgiveness is a form of charity (sadaqat). Forgiveness comes from taqwa (piety), a quality of God-fearing people.|$|E
2500|$|While in London {{for discussions}} with Churchill, Wavell signalled to Cairo that the {{evacuation}} of British Somaliland had not been the cause of recriminations but after more details of the Battle of Tug Argan arrived in London, Churchill questioned why the British had retreated and if the Italian superiority was really overwhelming {{if they had not}} exploited their advantage. Churchill complained that the defence of the Tug Argan Gap had been [...] "precipitately discontinued" [...] and that Godwin-Austen had exaggerated the number of British casualties. Churchill blamed the local commanders for failing adequately to conduct a fighting retreat. Wavell replied that high casualties were <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> of good leadership and Churchill never forgave the slight and began to plan his dismissal. Aosta later wrote that the invasion plan depended on speed but supply difficulties and unexpectedly poor weather and rains blocked some roads slowed the advance. During the delay caused by the British defence of Tug Argan, Aosta tried to send a force of 300 volunteers by aircraft to capture Berbera by coup de main but the scheme was cancelled, because the British still occupied the only landing ground. The Italians had failed to exploit the opportunity and given the haphazard nature of the evacuation and the lack of defences, the withdrawal might have prevented.|$|E
