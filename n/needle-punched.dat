40|$|The {{nonwoven}} waste {{coming from}} textile industry takes up 5 % {{of the total}} waste amount, so to recycle and to regenerate the waste is the prior obligation of the factory to reduce the waste. Nonwoven selvages waste can be buried or burnt but these two methods result in environmental pollution. This research proposes to reuse these waste nonwoven selvages effectively, and is designed as follows. Each piece of thermal-bonding material comprised a sandwich structure, with two layers of 7. 0 d PET matrices enclosing a layer of PP nonwoven selvage and nylon geogrid. After <b>needle-punching</b> and thermal-pressing, it forms a laminate structure of PET nonwoven / PP selvage/ PET nonwoven in that it decreases the impact by the environmental pollution and protects the environment ultimately. In addition, thermal-bonding reinforces the mechanical properties of the composite fabric structure.

30|$|Nonwoven fabrics are low density fabrics {{characterized}} by a high ratio of thickness to {{weight per unit area}} ([Parikh et al. 2003]). Intermingled fibers are compressed or densified by the process of either <b>needle-punching,</b> stitch-bonding or thermal-bonding. The term nonwoven is used in the textile manufacturing industry to denote fabrics that are neither woven nor knitted. Nonwoven barrier materials are generally less expensive than woven and knitted barrier fabrics. However, disadvantages associated with their manufacturing techniques, such as uneven blending, regions with uneven area density etc., affect their performance as barrier materials. Nonwoven materials typically lack strength (tensile and bursting) unless densified or reinforced by a backing. Due to their structural characteristics, nonwovens also have challenges associated with their mechanical performance and thermal shrinkage when exposed to heat. Thus, good quality control measures are critical during manufacturing.|$|R

During the process, PET fibers and Kevlar fibers are blended with various ratios and the density of the PU foams is varied.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Torsional ring shear {{tests were}} {{performed}} to evaluate the effect of shear displacement rate on the internal shear strength of a <b>needle-punched</b> geosynthetic clay liner (GCL) under different normal stresses. The test {{results suggest that the}} internal shear strength of the <b>needle-punched</b> GCL depends on the following three factors: (i) resistance against reinforcement fibers pulling out and/or tearing; (ii) amount of posi-tive pore-water pressure induced during shear; and (iii) bentonite water content at the time of shearing. The laboratory tests indicate that the net effect of these three factors result in the peak internal shear strength being less sensitive to shear displacement rate at normal stresses between 200 and 400 kPa than at normal stresses less than 200 kPa. Shear displacement rate appears to have little influence on the residual internal shear strength regardless of normal stress.

Three types of nonwovens were developed using <b>needle-punching</b> technique by blending bamboo, banana, and jute fibers with polypropylene staple fibers in the ratio of 50 : 50. Sound absorption coefficient was tested by impedance tube method (ASTM E 1050). Comparison of physical properties such as areal density, thickness, stiffness, tensile strength, elongation, structural properties, and comfort properties such as air permeability and thermal conductivity were performed for all samples. It is observed that the bamboo/polypropylene nonwoven with its compact structure showed, higher tensile strength, higher stiffness, lower elongation, lower thermal conductivity, lower air permeability, and good absorption coefficient than others and it is suitable for the automotive interior noise control. At 800 Hz, the absorption coefficient of bamboo/polypropylene and jute/ polypropylene is equivalent to the target level but it is lower by 22 % in banana/ polypropylene. But at higher frequencies (1600 Hz), there is a reduction from the target level in all the nonwovens, which could be improved by increasing the thickness of the nonwovens.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Nonwovens form a significant and rapidly growing sector of the textiles industry. The nonwovens sector originally set out to provide economical alternatives to traditional textiles for functional product components such as interlinings and carpet backings. Through constant growth and development nonwovens are now considered as sophisticated engineered fabrics that economically meet specific functional needs. Since the 1970 's, however, the potential to use nonwoven fabrics and technologies within design has been under consideration by textile researchers, textile artists and fashion and textile designers and makers. The resulting fabrics have found application in mass marketable products such as gift and flower wrap and as one-off designer products such as scarves. In comparison to traditional sectors of the textile industry such as woven textiles, however, in regard to design {{there seems to be}} little middle ground between these two production contexts. Further to this, the range of nonwoven technologies that have been explored by textile designers, makers and artists is relatively limited and focuses predominantly on the <b>needle-punching</b> method of manufacture to produce felt-like fabrics. This situation presents a potentially missed opportunity within the nonwovens sector of textile manufacture. The research presented in this thesis aims to identify and explore the undeveloped opportunities to design nonwoven materials from an aesthetic perspective using a specific range of production processes and materials. The work is set within the context of designer maker practice and as such considers both industrial and craft perspectives on the design and manufacture of nonwovens. In doing so the relationship between craft and industry within the sphere of nonwovens is brought into question and the opportunities and limitations of working as a designer maker within this sphere are explored. The development of textile products for niche, high-end markets is of growing importance within the European textiles industry. This research explores the potential to develop design-led nonwovens for high-end markets. The work was conducted using a practice led research approach which revolved around the development of innovative new fabrics suitable for high-end markets. The work focuses on the use of carding, <b>needle-punching</b> and thermal bonding technologies that utilize heat and pressure and subsequent decorative finishing processes including devore, embossing and laser cutting. The ability to design nonwoven fabric structures specifically for use in these processes formed a central part of the contribution to knowledge made within the work. In particular, the development of devore and laser techniques for nonwovens made from contrasting fibre layers or with decorative materials embedded within them. The fabrics produced evidence new design concepts within the sphere of nonwovens. The suitability of the designs for production within different manufacturing contexts was assessed through a series of interviews with nonwoven manufacturers and their suitability for the high-end markets was evaluated through a series of focus groups and interviews with textile and product designers. The qualitative nature of the analysis made provides a new perspective on the design value of nonwovens. The results of the research confirmed the aesthetic appeal of certain fabrics within the collections produced and their suitability for high-end markets. The findings identified key factors in regard to how value is attributed to nonwovens within this market and suggested that further research into developing high-value nonwovens is required.

40|$|The use {{of natural}} fibers as {{reinforcement}} in thermoplastics presents an interesting alternative {{for the production of}} low cost and ecologically friendly composites. One of the advantages of using natural fibres is their low specific weight, resulting in higher specific strength and stiffness when compared to glass reinforced composites. Natural fibres also present safer handling and working conditions. They are non-abrasive to mixing and can contribute to significant cost reduction. This work is divided into two phases: Phase 1 deals with developing nonwoven mats composites from flax/polypropylene (PP) and evaluating their properties. Flax/polypropylene fibres (at different weight ratios) were processed by <b>needle-punching</b> technique in order to form nonwoven mats. The mats were compression-molded at a temperature of 180 oC to form composite materials. The mechanical, thermal and viscoelastic properties of the composites were analyzed. Composites (untreated and silane-treated) were also subjected to varying conditions of temperature and humidity and the tensile properties of the conditioned and unconditioned composites were investigated. The mechanical properties (tensile, flexural and impact) of flax/PP composites were found to increase and reach maximum values at 30 per cent fibre loading and then decrease at higher fibre content. Thermal studies revealed that the composites were stable up to 320 oC and samples containing 40 per cent flax fibres were found to exhibit greater thermal stability than neat PP. The dynamic mechanical analyses of the composites showed that the incorporation of flax in the composites resulted in an increase of the storage modulus with a maximum value exhibited by composite containing 40 per cent fibre loading. Composites containing chemically modified fibres exhibited low tensile modulus after conditioning. Phase 2 is based on the investigation of the effect of nano-calcium carbonate (CaCO 3) on the properties of two types of polymer matrices: recycled PP and virgin PP. In this case, composites were prepared by melt-mixing and injection molding. The mechanical and thermal properties of the composites were characterized. The tensile modulus of the nano-CaCO 3 filled PP (virgin and recycled) composites were found to increase and reach maximum at 30 per cent nano-CaCO 3 loading, while the tensile strength decreased with increasing filler content. Thermal studies showed that the nano-CaCO 3 filled PP samples exhibited a one-step degradation pattern and are thermally stable up to 450 oC. The thermal stability of the samples was found to decrease following the addition of nano-CaCO 3.
