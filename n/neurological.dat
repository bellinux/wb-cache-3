5|$|George Allan Ross {{designed}} the Pathology Building, 1922–23; the <b>Neurological</b> Institute, 1933; <b>Neurological</b> Institute addition 1938 at McGill University. Jean Julien Perrault (architect) {{designed the}} McTavish Street residence for Charles E. Gravel, {{which is now}} called David Thompson House (1934).|$|E
5|$|The {{diagnosis}} may be suspected on {{the basis}} of the symptoms, for example the combination of headache, signs of raised intracranial pressure and focal <b>neurological</b> abnormalities, or when alternative causes of headache and <b>neurological</b> abnormalities, such as a subarachnoid hemorrhage, have been excluded.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} more recent {{scholars}} attempted {{to explain her}} visions in psychiatric or <b>neurological</b> terms. Potential diagnoses have included epilepsy, migraine, tuberculosis, and schizophrenia.|$|E
5|$|At {{the level}} of the aortic arch, the {{distribution}} of blood likely to carry bubbles to <b>neurological</b> tissue such as the brain or the spinal cord.|$|E
5|$|Differences in {{vulnerability}} to lead-induced <b>neurological</b> damage {{between males and}} females have also been found, but some studies have found males to be at greater risk, while others have found females to be.|$|E
5|$|Focal <b>neurological</b> signs such {{as these}} might reflect the effects of some {{prescribed}} psychiatric medications, chronic drug or alcohol use, head injuries, tumors or other brain disorders.|$|E
5|$|Furthermore, {{acetylcysteine}} {{has been}} confirmed, {{in a recent}} double-blind placebo-controlled trial conducted by the US military, to reduce the effects of blast induced mild traumatic brain and <b>neurological</b> injury in soldiers. Multiple animal studies have also demonstrated its efficacy in reducing the damage associated with moderate traumatic brain or spinal injury, and also ischemia-induced brain injury. In particular, it has been demonstrated through multiple studies to significantly reduce neuronal losses and to improve cognitive and <b>neurological</b> outcomes associated with these traumatic events. Acetylcysteine has been safely used to treat paracetamol overdose for over forty years and is extensively used in emergency medicine.|$|E
5|$|In {{the initial}} phase of decompression, the {{critical}} event {{is assumed to}} be the arrival of an arterial bubble in a de-saturating <b>neurological</b> tissue. The bubble exchanges gas with the surrounding tissue and the blood. If the bubble does not exceed a critical radius, it will eventually leave the site without growing, otherwise it will block the blood circulation and cause ischemia. The critical parameter is bubble radius. This criterion is used to prevent type II <b>neurological</b> symptoms. The strategy for a safe rate of ascent at this stage is to balance gas exchange.|$|E
5|$|Midazolam is {{sometimes}} used in {{neonatal intensive care}} units. When used, additional caution is required in newborns; midazolam {{should not be used}} for longer than 72 hours due to risks of tachyphylaxis, and the possibility of development of a benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome, as well as <b>neurological</b> complications. Bolus injections should be avoided due to the increased risk of cardiovascular depression, as well as <b>neurological</b> complications.|$|E
5|$|Neuroacanthocytosis is a label {{applied to}} several <b>neurological</b> {{conditions}} in which the blood contains misshapen, spiculated red blood cells called acanthocytes.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the major}} {{concerns}} following acute carbon monoxide poisoning is the severe delayed <b>neurological</b> manifestations that may occur. Problems may include difficulty with higher intellectual functions, short-term memory loss, dementia, amnesia, psychosis, irritability, a strange gait, speech disturbances, Parkinson's disease-like syndromes, cortical blindness, and a depressed mood. Depression may occur in {{those who did not}} have pre-existing depression. These delayed <b>neurological</b> sequelae may occur in up to 50% of poisoned people after 2 to 40 days. It is difficult to predict who will develop delayed sequelae; however, advanced age, loss of consciousness while poisoned, and initial <b>neurological</b> abnormalities may increase the chance of developing delayed symptoms.|$|E
5|$|Other <b>neurological</b> {{disorders}} {{have been}} reported in the context of dengue, such as transverse myelitis and Guillain–Barré syndrome. Infection of the heart and acute liver failure are among the rarer complications.|$|E
5|$|She {{explains}} the <b>neurological</b> basis for reasoning and cognition in the brain, and brings the point across that the self itself is changeable. She describes the physiology behind <b>neurological</b> pathways which include webs of neurons containing dendrites, axons, and synapses; and explains that certain brains with more rigid pathways {{will be less}} susceptible to new information or creative stimuli. Taylor utilizes <b>neurological</b> science to show that brainwashed individuals have more rigid pathways, and that rigidity can make it unlikely that the individual will rethink situations or be able to later reorganize these pathways. She explains that repetition {{is an integral part}} of brainwashing techniques because connections between neurons become stronger when exposed to incoming signals of frequency and intensity. She argues that people in their teenage years and early twenties are more susceptible to persuasion. Taylor explains that brain activity in the temporal lobe, the region responsible for artistic creativity, also causes spiritual experiences in a process known as lability.|$|E
5|$|Similarly, {{arterial}} bubbles {{may reach}} {{the spinal cord}} and grow on site from local gas and produce spinal <b>neurological</b> symptoms.|$|E
5|$|The Dayton {{region has}} several key institutes and centers for health care. The Center for Tissue Regeneration and Engineering at Dayton {{focuses on the}} science and {{development}} of human tissue regeneration. The National Center for Medical Readiness (NCMR) {{is also in the}} Dayton area. The center includes Calamityville, which is a state-of-the-art disaster training facility. Over a period of five years, Calamityville is estimated to have a regional economic impact of $374million. Also, the <b>Neurological</b> Institute at Miami Valley Hospital is an institute focused on the diagnosis, treatment, and research of <b>neurological</b> disorders.|$|E
5|$|The World Federation of Neurosurgeons (WFNS) {{classification}} uses Glasgow coma score (GCS) and focal <b>neurological</b> {{deficit to}} gauge severity of symptoms.|$|E
5|$|The city is {{also home}} to {{numerous}} other institutions of higher learning. Notable institutions include: Barrow <b>Neurological</b> Institute, the world's largest <b>neurological</b> disease treatment and research institution; Grand Canyon University, a private Christian university initially founded in 1949 as a non-profit school, it now operates as a for-profit institution; the University of Phoenix is the nation's largest for-profit university with over 300,000 students at campuses throughout North America, as well as online; and the Arizona Summit Law School, a private, for-profit law school located in downtown Phoenix.|$|E
5|$|The {{combination}} of <b>neurological</b> symptoms, Kayser–Fleischer rings {{and a low}} ceruloplasmin level is considered sufficient for the diagnosis of Wilson's disease. In many cases, however, further tests are needed.|$|E
5|$|The university's {{athletic}} facilities, including Molson Stadium, {{are located}} on Mount Royal, near the residence halls and the Montreal <b>Neurological</b> Institute. The Gymnasium is named in honour of General Sir Arthur William Currie.|$|E
5|$|A 1973 {{report found}} that CVST could be found on autopsy (examination of the body after death) in nine percent of all people. Many of these were elderly and had <b>neurological</b> {{symptoms}} in the period leading up to their death, and many suffered from concomitant heart failure.|$|E
5|$|Abnormalities of behavior, {{also called}} {{abnormalities}} of activity, include observations of specific abnormal movements, {{as well as}} more general observations of the patient's level of activity and arousal, and observations of the patient's eye contact and gait. Abnormal movements, for example choreiform, athetoid or choreoathetoid movements may indicate a <b>neurological</b> disorder. A tremor or dystonia may indicate a <b>neurological</b> condition or the side effects of antipsychotic medication. The patient may have tics (involuntary but quasi-purposeful movements or vocalizations) which may be a symptom of Tourette's syndrome. There are a range of abnormalities of movement which are typical of catatonia, such as echopraxia, catalepsy, waxy flexibility and paratonia (or gegenhalten). Stereotypies (repetitive purposeless movements such as rocking or head banging) or mannerisms (repetitive quasi-purposeful abnormal movements such as a gesture or abnormal gait) may be a feature of chronic schizophrenia or autism.|$|E
5|$|After the {{publication}} of Carr's essay, a developing view unfolded in the media as sociological and <b>neurological</b> studies surfaced that were relevant to determining the cognitive impact of regular Internet usage. Challenges to Carr's argument were made frequently. As the two most outspoken detractors of electronic media, Carr and Birkerts were both appealed to by Kevin Kelly to each formulate a more precise definition of the faults they perceived regarding electronic media so that their beliefs could be scientifically verified. While Carr firmly believed that his skepticism about the Internet's benefits to cognition was warranted, he cautioned in both his essay and his book The Big Switch that long-term psychological and <b>neurological</b> studies were required to definitively ascertain how cognition develops {{under the influence of}} the Internet.|$|E
5|$|Although ten {{men died}} {{during the course of}} the hunger strike, {{thirteen}} others began refusing food but were taken off hunger strike, either due to medical reasons or after intervention by their families. Many of them still suffer from the effects of the strike, with problems including digestive, visual, physical and <b>neurological</b> disabilities.|$|E
5|$|Amnesic {{shellfish}} poisoning (ASP) {{was first}} reported in eastern Canada in 1987. It {{is caused by}} the substance domoic acid found in certain diatoms of the genus Pseudo-nitzschia. Bivalves can become toxic when they filter these microalgae out of the water. Domoic acid is a low-molecular weight amino acid that is able to destroy brain cells causing memory loss, gastroenteritis, long-term <b>neurological</b> problems or death. In an outbreak in the western United States in 1993, finfish were also implicated as vectors, and seabirds and mammals suffered <b>neurological</b> symptoms. In the United States and Canada, a regulatory limit of 20µg/g of domoic acid in shellfish meat is set.|$|E
5|$|As the {{structure}} of the back is complex and the reporting of pain is subjective and affected by social factors, the diagnosis of low back pain is not straightforward. While most low back pain is caused by muscle and joint problems, this cause must be separated from <b>neurological</b> problems, spinal tumors, fracture of the spine, and infections, among others.|$|E
5|$|Because {{tumor cells}} are inefficient in {{processing}} ketone bodies for energy, the ketogenic diet {{has also been}} suggested {{as a treatment for}} cancer, including glioma, as well as multiple sclerosis and other <b>neurological</b> disorders.|$|E
5|$|Catastrophic {{injuries}} are not common in American football. According to the National Center for Catastrophic Sport Injury Research, there were 468 non-fatal injuries resulting in permanent <b>neurological</b> damage across all {{high school sports}} in the United States from 1982 to 2011. In football, catastrophic {{injuries are}} rare but are devastating when they occur. The rate of catastrophic head injuries has remained low since {{the introduction of the}} modern football helmet in the 1970s, but rates of injury are much higher {{at the high school level}} than the college level. A 2007 study found that, in high school and college football, there are an average of 7.23 catastrophic head injuries per year: there were 0.67 injuries per 100,000 high school players and 0.21 injuries per 100,000 college players. Over a 13-year period from September 1989 to June 2002, there were 94 players who sustained catastrophic head injuries—8 of these players died as a result of the injury, 46 sustained permanent <b>neurological</b> damage, and 36 made a full recovery. Fifty-nine percent of these players had a history of head injuries, 71% of them occurring in the same season as their catastrophic injury, and most of the catastrophic injuries resulted from being tackled or making a tackle. The study recommended that players exhibiting <b>neurological</b> symptoms should be strongly discouraged from returning to play.|$|E
5|$|Cerebellar atrophy {{has been}} {{observed}} in many other <b>neurological</b> disorders including Huntington's disease, multiple sclerosis, essential tremor, progressive myoclonus epilepsy, and Niemann–Pick disease. Cerebellar atrophy can also occur {{as a result of}} exposure to toxins including heavy metals or pharmaceutical or recreational drugs.|$|E
5|$|Cerebral malaria {{is defined}} as a severe P.falciparum-malaria {{presenting}} with <b>neurological</b> symptoms, including coma (with a Glasgow coma scale less than 11, or a Blantyre coma scale greater than 3), or with a coma that lasts longer than 30 minutes after a seizure.|$|E
5|$|Cerebral malaria {{is one of}} {{the leading}} causes of <b>neurological</b> disabilities in African children. Studies {{comparing}} cognitive functions before and after treatment for severe malarial illness continued to show significantly impaired school performance and cognitive abilities even after recovery. Consequently, severe and cerebral malaria have far-reaching socioeconomic consequences that extend beyond the immediate effects of the disease.|$|E
5|$|Data {{collected}} in the North Sea {{have shown that the}} overall incidence of decompression sickness for in-water and surface decompression is similar, but surface decompression tends to produce ten times more type II (<b>neurological)</b> DCS than in-water decompression. A possible explanation is that during the final stage of ascent, bubbles are produced that are stopped in the lung capillaries. During recompression of the diver in the deck chamber, the diameter of some of these bubbles is reduced sufficiently that they pass through the pulmonary capillaries and reach the systemic circulation on the arterial side, later lodging in systemic capillaries and causing <b>neurological</b> symptoms. The same scenario was proposed for type II DCS recorded after sawtooth profile diving or multiple repetitive diving.|$|E
5|$|Diagnosis is {{suspected}} based on lesion circumstances and clinical evidence, most prominently a <b>neurological</b> examination, for example checking whether the pupils constrict normally {{in response to}} light and assigning a Glasgow Coma Score. Neuroimaging helps in determining the diagnosis and prognosis and in deciding what treatments to give.|$|E
5|$|Diagnosis of MTBI {{is based}} on {{physical}} and <b>neurological</b> examination findings, duration of unconsciousness (usually less than 30minutes) and post-traumatic amnesia (PTA; usually less than 24hours), and the Glasgow Coma Scale (MTBI sufferers have scores of 13 to 15). Neuropsychological tests exist to measure cognitive function and the international consensus meeting in Zurich recommended {{the use of the}} SCAT2 test.|$|E
5|$|During childhood, malaria causes anemia {{during a}} period of rapid brain development, and also direct brain damage {{resulting}} from cerebral malaria. Some survivors of cerebral malaria have an increased risk of <b>neurological</b> and cognitive deficits, behavioural disorders, and epilepsy. Malaria prophylaxis was shown to improve cognitive function and school performance in clinical trials when compared to placebo groups.|$|E
5|$|Epilepsy {{is one of}} {{the most}} common serious <b>neurological</b> {{disorders}} affecting about 39 million people as of 2015. It affects 1% of the population by age 20 and 3% of the population by age 75. It is more common in males than females with the overall difference being small. Most of those with the disorder (80%) are in the developing world.|$|E
5|$|Examples {{of common}} human {{diseases}} caused by viruses include the common cold, influenza, chickenpox, and cold sores. Many serious {{diseases such as}} Ebola virus disease, AIDS, avian influenza, and SARS are caused by viruses. The relative ability of viruses to cause disease is {{described in terms of}} virulence. Other diseases are under investigation to discover if they have a virus as the causative agent, such as the possible connection between human herpesvirus 6 (HHV6) and <b>neurological</b> diseases such as multiple sclerosis and chronic fatigue syndrome. There is controversy over whether the bornavirus, previously thought to cause <b>neurological</b> diseases in horses, could be responsible for psychiatric illnesses in humans.|$|E
