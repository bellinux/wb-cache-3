50|$|<b>Neonicotinoids</b> {{have been}} {{registered}} {{in more than}} 120 countries. With a global turnover of €1.5 billion in 2008, they represented 24% of the global market for insecticides. After {{the introduction of the}} first <b>neonicotinoids</b> in the 1990s, this market has grown from €155 million in 1990 to €957 million in 2008. <b>Neonicotinoids</b> made up 80% of all seed treatment sales in 2008.|$|R
50|$|A 2015 {{systematic}} review (Lundin et al., 2015) {{of the scientific}} literature on <b>neonicotinoids</b> and bees concluded that despite considerable research efforts, there are still significant knowledge gaps concerning the impacts of <b>neonicotinoids</b> on bees.|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn {{less than}} 20 years, <b>neonicotinoids</b> {{have become the}} most widely used class of {{insecticides}} with a global market share of more than 25 %. For pollinators, this has transformed the agrochemical landscape. These chemicals mimic the acetylcholine neurotransmitter and are highly neurotoxic to insects. Their systemic mode of action inside plants means phloemic and xylemic transport that results in translocation to pollen and nectar. Their wide application, persistence in soil and water and potential for uptake by succeeding crops and wild plants make <b>neonicotinoids</b> bioavailable to pollinators at sublethal concentrations for most of the year. This results in the frequent presence of <b>neonicotinoids</b> in honeybee hives. At field realistic doses, <b>neonicotinoids</b> cause a wide range of adverse sublethal effects in honeybee and bumblebee colonies, affecting colony performance through impairment of foraging success, brood and larval development, memory and learning, damage to the central nervous system, susceptibility to diseases, hive hygiene etc. <b>Neonicotinoids</b> exhibit a toxicity that can be amplified by various other agrochemicals and they synergistically reinforce infectious agents such as Nosema ceranae which together can produce colony collapse. The limited available data suggest that they are likely to exhibit similar toxicity to virtually all other wild insect pollinators. The worldwide production of <b>neonicotinoids</b> is still increasing. Therefore a transition to pollinator-friendly alternatives to <b>neonicotinoids</b> is urgently needed {{for the sake of the}} sustainability of pollinator ecosystem services...|$|R
5|$|The 2009 {{documentary}} Vanishing of the Bees {{pointed to}} <b>neonicotinoid</b> pesticides {{as being the}} most likely culprit, though the experts interviewed concede that no firm data yet exists.|$|E
5|$|In March 2013, {{two studies}} were {{published}} showing that neonicotinoids affect bee long-term and short-term memory, suggesting {{a cause of}} action resulting in failure {{to return to the}} hive. In another study done in 2013, scientists reported that experiments suggested that exposure to the <b>neonicotinoid</b> pesticides clothianidin and imidicloprid results in increased levels of a particular protein in bees that inhibits a key molecule involved in the immune response, making the insects more susceptible to attack by harmful viruses.|$|E
5|$|To date, {{most of the}} {{evaluation}} of possible roles of pesticides in CCD have relied {{on the use of}} surveys submitted by beekeepers, but direct testing of samples from affected colonies seems likely to be needed, especially given the possible role of systemic insecticides such as the <b>neonicotinoid</b> imidacloprid (which are applied to the soil and taken up into the plant's tissues, including pollen and nectar), which may be applied to a crop when the beekeeper is not present. The known effects of imidacloprid on insects, including honey bees, are consistent with the symptoms of CCD; for example, the effects of imidacloprid on termites include apparent failure of the immune system, and disorientation.|$|E
5000|$|An October 2015 study {{demonstrated}} {{significant effects}} on the survival and reproductive capacities of honey bee queens exposed to <b>neonicotinoids.</b> Those exposed to <b>neonicotinoids</b> had 60% survival rates, as compared to 80% for control groups. Lower worker egg production and alterations to surviving queens' reproductive anatomy [...] "likely corresponded to reduced queen success (alive and producing worker offspring)." [...] The authors further claim [...] "our study suggests that these substances <b>neonicotinoids</b> are, at least partially, responsible for harming queens and causing population declines of social bee species. Failure of queens exposed to <b>neonicotinoids</b> during development to successfully lay fertilised eggs that subsequently develop into workers or queens is worrisome; both castes are vital to colony survival..." ...|$|R
50|$|Most <b>neonicotinoids</b> are {{water-soluble}} {{and break}} down {{slowly in the}} environment, {{so they can be}} taken up by the plant and provide protection from insects as the plant grows.Independent studies show that the photodegradation half-life time of most <b>neonicotinoids</b> is around 34 days when exposed to sunlight. However, it might take up to 1,386 days (3.8 years) for these compounds to degrade in the absence of sunlight and micro-organism activity. Some researchers are concerned that <b>neonicotinoids</b> applied agriculturally might accumulate in aquifers.|$|R
25|$|<b>Neonicotinoids</b> are a {{class of}} neuro-active {{insecticides}} chemically similar to nicotine. Imidacloprid, of the neonicotanoid family, is {{the most widely used}} insecticide in the world. In the late 1990s <b>neonicotinoids</b> came under increasing scrutiny over their environmental impact and were linked in a range of studies to adverse ecological effects, including honey-bee colony collapse disorder (CCD) and loss of birds due to a reduction in insect populations. In 2013, the European Union and a few non EU countries restricted the use of certain <b>neonicotinoids.</b>|$|R
500|$|Bumblebees are {{in danger}} in many {{developed}} countries due to habitat destruction and collateral pesticide damage. The European Food Safety Authority ruled that three <b>neonicotinoid</b> pesticides (clothianidin, imidacloprid, and thiamethoxam) presented a high risk for bees. While most work on <b>neonicotinoid</b> toxicity has looked at honeybees, a study on B. terrestris showed that [...] "field-realistic" [...] levels of imidacloprid significantly reduced growth rate and cut production of new queens by 85%, implying a [...] "considerable negative effect" [...] on wild bumblebee populations throughout the developed world.|$|E
500|$|However, {{in another}} study, {{following}} chronic exposure to field-realistic {{levels of the}} <b>neonicotinoid</b> pesticide thiamethoxam, colony weight gain was not affected, nor were the number or mass of sexuals produced. Low levels of neonicotinoids can {{reduce the number of}} bumblebees in a colony by as much as 55%, and cause dysfunction in the bumblebees' brains. The Bumblebee Conservation Trust considers this evidence of reduced brain function [...] "particularly alarming given that bumblebees rely upon their intelligence to go about their daily tasks." [...] A study on B. terrestris had results that suggests that use of <b>neonicotinoid</b> pesticides can affect how well bumblebees are able to forage and pollinate. Bee colonies that had been affected by the pesticide released more foragers and collected more pollen than bees who had not been dosed with <b>neonicotinoid.</b> Although the bees affected by the pesticide were able to collect more pollen, they took a longer amount of time doing so.|$|E
500|$|Early in 2013, the European Food Safety Authority {{issued a}} {{declaration}} that three specific <b>neonicotinoid</b> pesticides pose an acute risk to honey bees, and the European Commission (EC) proposed a two-year ban on them. David Goulson, who led {{one of the}} key 2012 studies at the University of Stirling, said the decision [...] "begs the question {{of what was going on}} when these chemicals were first approved." [...] The chemical manufacturer Bayer said it was [...] "ready to work with" [...] the EC and member states. [...] In April 2013, the European Union voted for a two-year restriction on <b>neonicotinoid</b> insecticides. [...] The ban will restrict the use of imidacloprid, clothianidin, and thiamethoxam for use on crops that are attractive to bees. Eight nations voted against the motion, including the British government, which [...] argued that the science was incomplete. The ban can be seen as an application of the [...] "precautionary principle", established at the 1992 Rio Conference on the Environment and Development, which advocates that [...] "lack of full scientific certainty shall not be used as a reason for postponing cost-effective measures to prevent environmental degradation." ...|$|E
5000|$|A 2013 review {{concluded}} that <b>neonicotinoids,</b> {{as they are}} typically used, harm bees and that safer alternatives are urgently needed. [...] An October 2013 study by Italian researchers demonstrated that <b>neonicotinoids</b> disrupt bees' immune systems, making them susceptible to viral infections to which the bees are normally resistant.|$|R
50|$|In Montreal, Quebec, {{nearly all}} corn seeds and a {{majority}} of soybeans get treated with <b>neonicotinoids.</b> In the summer of 2015, Montreal passed a law to reduce the presence of <b>neonicotinoids.</b> Montreal’s regulations were written to reduce the percent of seeds and beans covered with neonicotoids to 20 percent within two years.|$|R
50|$|As all <b>neonicotinoids</b> were {{registered}} after 1984, {{they were not}} subject to reregistration, but due to environmental concerns, especially concerning bees, the EPA opened dockets to evaluate them. The registration review docket for imidacloprid opened in December 2008, and the docket for nithiazine opened in March 2009. To best take advantage of new research as it becomes available, the EPA moved ahead the docket openings for the remaining <b>neonicotinoids</b> on the registration review schedule (acetamiprid, clothianidin, dinotefuran, thiacloprid, and thiamethoxam) to FY 2012. The EPA {{has said that it}} expects to complete the review for the <b>neonicotinoids</b> in 2018.|$|R
500|$|Also, in 2012, {{researchers}} in Italy published findings that the pneumatic drilling machines that plant corn seeds coated with clothianidin and imidacloprid release {{large amounts of}} the pesticide into the air, causing significant mortality in foraging honey bees. According to the study, [...] "Experimental {{results show that the}} environmental release of particles containing neonicotinoids can produce high exposure levels for bees, with lethal effects compatible with colony losses phenomena observed by beekeepers." [...] Commonly used pesticides, such as the imidacloprid, reduce colony growth and new queen production in experimental exposure matched to field levels. [...] Lu et al. (2012) reported they were able to replicate CCD with imidacloprid. Another <b>neonicotinoid,</b> thiamethoxam, causes navigational homing failure of foraging bees, with high mortality.|$|E
2500|$|The , {{issued by}} the Task Force on Systemic Pesticides, {{provides}} [...] "conclusive" [...] evidence that <b>neonicotinoid</b> pesticides are damaging {{a wide range of}} beneficial species and are a key factor in the decline of bees.|$|E
2500|$|Research is {{beginning}} to determine the causes of CCD, {{with the weight of}} evidence leaning towards CCD being a syndrome rather than a disease, as it seems to be caused by a combination of various contributing factors rather than a single pathogen or poison. However, in April 2013, after [...] by the European Food Safety Authority identifying the significant risks of the class of pesticides called neonicotinoids, the European Union called for a two-year restriction on <b>neonicotinoid</b> pesticides.

50|$|As of 2011, seven <b>neonicotinoids</b> from {{different}} companies {{are on the}} market.|$|R
40|$|European Union (EU) {{has banned}} {{the use of}} three pesticides: clothianidin, {{thiamethoxam}} and imidacloprid in bee attractive crops. These pesticides all belong to a pesticide group called <b>neonicotinoids,</b> and they {{are believed to be}} a contributing factor in the declining bee population. The ban was enforced in EU the 1 st of December 2013. <b>Neonicotinoids</b> (clothianidin and thiamethoxam) {{are an important part of}} the control of pests in oilseed rape production in Danish agriculture. The <b>neonicotinoids</b> are generally used as a seed treatment in oilseed rape. The coatings of the rape seeds prevent young plants from pest attack. The seed treatment of oilseed rape helps controlling Cabbage stem flea beetle (Psylliodes chrysocephala). The lack of seed treatment in oilseed rape could result in extra treatments with pyrethroids (lambda-cyhalothrin, Gamma cyhalothrin and Cypermethrin). 	 This project aims to identify if the banning of the three <b>neonicotinoids</b> (clothianidin, thamethoxam and imidacloprid), seems to result in a farming practice that puts more or less pressure on the Danish environment, with special emphasis on honey bees. In Denmark there has not been reported poisoning of honey bees from either pyrethroids or <b>neonicotinoids.</b> Pesticides are among the Danish apiculturist not seen as a major concern, which indicates little identified negative effect of the <b>neonicotinoids</b> on honey bees. When treatment with <b>neonicotinoids</b> in oilseed rape is substituted with a treatment with pyrethroids, the time of application should pose no threat to honey bees, as the crop are not flowering and the application period will be in the autumn, where few flowers are present in the Danish environment. 	The change in oilseed farming practice does not necessarily increase the load on the Danish environment (based on calculation of Area Load). If the Danish farmers substitute the <b>neonicotinoids</b> seed treatment with an extra treatment of the pyrethroid with the least Area Load (Karate WG (Lambda-cyhalothrin)). If Danish farmers based on the higher taxation, in the future solely will use Karate WG in oilseed rape, the Area Load can actually decrease compared to before the ban of <b>neonicotinoids</b> even with three applications. Findings of resistance in Cabbage stem flea beetle in Germany towards pyrethroids makes a plausible scenario being breakdown of control of this pest in oilseed rape. Previously the control of Cabbage stem flea beetle has been based on <b>neonicotinoids</b> and pyrethroids, which have different modes of action in Cabbage stem flea beetle. Resistance among Cabbage stem flea beetle towards pyrethroids would result in the need of stronger doses and more applications, which would give rise to higher load on the environment including bees (increase in AL). A worst case scenario could be the need to abandon cultivation of rape in Denmark...|$|R
