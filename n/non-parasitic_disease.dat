40|$|Several <b>non-parasitic</b> <b>diseases</b> are {{of primary}} {{significance}} for olive trees {{growing in the}} Mediterranean area and other warm-temperate regions of the world. As for other crops, they are generally poorly understood and often completely unrecognized, especially in olive which is considered a crop of marginal lands. The origin may rest with a lack/excess of essential nutrients or an excess of non-essential elements; {{it may be an}} unsatisfactory environment: too cold or hot, too wet or dry, or too windy; there may be unsuitable soil characteristics such as poor physical condition, water-logging, salinity, improper pH, and so on. Also pollution in the environment, spray and fire damage, and climatic extremes like lightning, hail, and snow can cause heavy losses to olive. This review focuses on the most important disorders of olive caused by environmental, physical, and chemical stresses that can affect the normal physiological processes in trees. An integrated view is utilized to highlight interactions with plant healthiness, production, and quality...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{performance}} of the rK 39 strip test in the diagnosis of Tunisian visceral leishmaniasis (VL) was evaluated and {{compared with that of}} immunofluorescent antibody test (IFAT). A total of 929 sera, including 574 from VL patients, 54 from cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) patients, 42 from patients with other protozoan diseases, 152 from patients with <b>non-parasitic</b> <b>diseases</b> and 107 from healthy controls, were used in the study. The sensitivity and specificity of the rK 39 strip test were 87. 1 and 94. 4 %, respectively. Sixteen CL sera showed positive results, suggesting that the rK 39 strip test is not restricted to Leishmania donovani complex detection. IFAT was comparatively more sensitive (98. 9 %) but slightly less specific (90. 7 %). Despite cross-reactivity shown by CL sera, the rK 39 strip test can be recommended for the routine diagnosis of VL in Tunisia, as VL and CL are distinct clinical. entities.

40|$|Background: Paragonimiasis is a food-borne {{trematode}} infection {{acquired by}} eating raw or undercooked crustaceans. It {{is a major}} public health problem in the far East, but it also occurs in South Asia, Africa, and in the Americas. Paragonimus worms cause chronic lung disease with cough, fever and hemoptysis that can be confused with tuberculosis or other <b>non-parasitic</b> <b>diseases.</b> Treatment is straightforward, but diagnosis is often delayed {{due to a lack}} of reliable parasitological or serodiagnostic tests. Hence, the purpose of this study was to use a systems biology approach to identify key parasite proteins that may be useful for development of improved diagnostic tests. Methodology/Principal Findings: The transcriptome of adult Paragonimus kellicotti was sequenced with Illumina technology. Raw reads were pre-processed and assembled into 78, 674 unique transcripts derived from 54, 622 genetic loci, and 77, 123 unique protein translations were predicted. A total of 2, 555 predicted proteins (from 1, 863 genetic loci) were verified by mass spectrometric analysis of total worm homogenate, including 63 proteins lacking homology to previously characterized sequences. Parasite proteins encoded by 321 transcripts (227 genetic loci) were reactive with antibodies from infected patients, as demonstrated by immunoaffinity purification and high-resolution liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Serodiagnostic candidates were prioritized based on several criteria, especially low conservation with proteins in other trematodes. Cysteine proteases, MFP 6 proteins and myoglobins were abundant among the immunoreactiv...|$|R

The transcriptome, proteome and immunolome of adult P. kellicotti represent a major advance in the study of Paragonimus species. These data provide a powerful foundation for translational research to develop improved diagnostic tests.

40|$|Simple hepatic cysts (SHC), polycystic {{liver disease}} (PCLD) and cystadenomas (CA) share in common {{clinical}} features, difficulties in diagnosis, radiological investigations and surgical management. The surgical management of <b>non-parasitic</b> cystic liver <b>disease</b> (NPCLD) remains controversial. The {{aim of the}} study was to compare and assess the surgical management in the 3 groups. We reviewed the. records of 42 patients with NPCLD who had 66 surgical procedures over a 25 year period. There were | 2 cases of SHC, | | PCLD and 19 CA. Mean age was 47 years and 88 % were females. The most common symptom was chronic abdominal pain in all groups. Polycystic kidney disease was associated with 45 % of PCLD. CT and US were diagnostic in 80 % for SHC, 100 % for PCLD and only 60 % for CA. Cyst(s) were right-sided in 83 % of SHC and 57 % of CA.

40|$|ALTHOUGH <b>non-parasitic</b> cystic <b>disease</b> of {{the liver}} is a {{comparatively}} rare pathologic entity, it is encountered with sufficient frequency that the internist should certainly be aware of its manifestations. From {{a review of the}} literature it would appear that this condition can make itself evident at any period of life. Witzel * and Sanger and Klopp x in 1880 reported cases of large solitary cysts {{of the liver}} found in fetuses which, in both instances, were of such a size as to complicate delivery of the child. Bagot 3 in 1892 reported a similar case of a liver cyst containing 2 % gallons of fluid and complicating delivery. At the other extreme of life we find the oldest case in the literature reported in a patient of 82 by McCaughan and Rassieur. 4 These last authors analyzed 80 cases and found the average age at diagnosis to be 33 years. Beattie and Robertson 5 reviewed 62 cases and found that the diagnosis was made most commonly between the fourth and sixth decades. The female sex appears to have some predisposition to this condition. Various authors quote the incidence as varying between 3 : 1 and 4 : 1 of females over males. Heredity seems to play some part in certain instances. In a case of con-genital polycystic disease of the kidney and liver reported by Campbell, 6 two siblings of the patient were definitely known to have had cystic kidneys. Other congenital malformations, such as spina bifida, meningocele, polydactylism, vesical anomalies and hypospadias, have been found in association with cases of cystic liver disease. The concurrence of cystic disease of the liver and cystic disease of other organs, particularly the kidney, is well known and has been commented upon by several authors. Moschcowitz x reviewed 85 cases of cystic disease of the liver and found that in only 10 of these cases was the liver alone affected. In 19 % * Received for publication May 19, 1954...|$|R
