2500|$|The god Tyr defends Freyr, {{to which}} Loki replies that Tyr should be silent, for Tyr cannot [...] "deal {{straight}} with people," [...] {{and points out}} that it was Loki's son, the wolf Fenrir, who tore Tyr's hand off. (According to the prose introduction to the poem Tyr is now one-handed from having his arm bitten off by Loki's son Fenrir while Fenrir was bound.) Tyr responds that while he may have lost a hand, Loki has lost the wolf, and trouble has come to them both. Further, that Fenrir must <b>now</b> <b>wait</b> in shackles until the onset of Ragnarök. Loki tells Tyr to be silent a second time, and states that Tyr's wife (otherwise unattested) had a son by Loki, and that Tyr never received any compensation for this [...] "injury," [...] further calling him a [...] "wretch." ...|$|E
2500|$|Teachings about Jesus and testimonies {{about what}} he {{accomplished}} during his three-year public ministry are found throughout the New Testament. [...] Core biblical teachings about the person of Jesus Christ may be summarized that Jesus Christ was and forever is fully God (divine) and fully human in one sinless person at the same time, and that through the death and resurrection of Jesus, sinful humans can be reconciled to God and thereby are offered salvation {{and the promise of}} eternal life via his New Covenant. [...] While there have been theological disputes over the nature of Jesus, Christians believe that Jesus is God incarnate and [...] "true God and true man" [...] (or both fully divine and fully human). [...] Jesus, having become fully human in all respects, suffered the pains and temptations of a mortal man, yet he did not sin. [...] As fully God, he defeated death and rose to life again. [...] Scripture asserts that Jesus was conceived, by the Holy Spirit, and born of his virgin mother Mary without a human father. [...] The Biblical accounts of Jesus' ministry include miracles, preaching, teaching, healing, Death, and resurrection. [...] The apostle Peter, in what has become a famous proclamation of faith among Christians since the 1st century, said, [...] "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God." [...] Most Christians <b>now</b> <b>wait</b> for the Second Coming of Christ when they believe he will fulfill the remaining Messianic prophecies.|$|E
