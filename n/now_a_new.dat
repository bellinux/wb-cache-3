5|$|Helena, knowing Ruiz is soon {{scheduled}} to testify, makes {{a deal with}} Juan Obregón (Bratt), lord of the drug cartel, who forgives the Ayala family's debt and has Ruiz poisoned. Ayala is released, much to the dissatisfaction of Gordon, who is still angry over his partner's death. During a phone conversation between Ayala and Metzger, Ayala deduces that it was Metzger who originally informed on Ruiz. Evidently in a bid for power with another drug cartel in Mexico, Metzger accepted $3 million to inform on Ruiz to the FBI and facilitate the Ayala organization's downfall. Ayala says that Metzger was planning on taking over Ayala's empire completely. As Ayala hangs up the phone, Metzger {{looks up to see}} two hit men entering his office. Soon after Ayala's release, Gordon bursts into the Ayala home during his homecoming celebration. Bodyguards wrestle him to the ground, but Gordon is able to surreptitiously plant a listening bug under Ayala's desk. Gordon is forced from the property, with the satisfaction of knowing that there is <b>now</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> opportunity to trap Ayala.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Scully {{notices that}} Miles (now on life support) has two heartbeats. At the FBI, Kersh unsuccessfully tries to {{convince}} Doggett to stop investigating Mulder's apparent death. A short while later, as Skinner walks down a hallway, rogue agent Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea) activates nanobots {{that he had}} previously placed in Skinner's bloodstream as blackmail. Skinner stumbles in pain, and in an elevator, Krycek reveals himself to Skinner and explains {{that he has a}} vaccine which could save Mulder's life. However, he will only give it if Skinner can ensure that Scully does not give birth to her baby for reasons that he does not disclose. Later, alone in his hospital bed, Miles regains consciousness and goes to take a shower. While doing so, his decaying flesh falls away, revealing a healthy body beneath. He tries to persuade Scully and Doggett that the aliens who abducted him are trying to save humanity. Scully, however, gets a lab report which reveals that Miles's DNA has substantially changed; he is <b>now</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> being. Skinner later tells Scully that there is a cure for Mulder's disease, but does not explain Krycek's demands.|$|E

25|$|As of 2014, TARC has a {{fleet of}} 225 buses. 32 are hybrid buses, which combine a {{traditional}} diesel engine and an electric motor to reduce emissions and eliminate tailpipe exhaust during acceleration, but cost nearly {{twice as much as}} a conventional bus. The hybrids were provided through Federal highway bill earmarks by U.S. Senator Jim Bunning. In 2007, a new TARC bus cost $285,000, while a hybrid bus cost $504,000. <b>Now</b> <b>a</b> <b>New</b> clean diesel costs $405,000 dollars a bus while a hybrid costs $600,000 dollars a bus.|$|E

25|$|If a batsman is caught, the bowler is {{credited}} with the batsman's wicket and the catching fielder {{is credited}} for the dismissal, there is no catch assists for a saving boundaries before catch, or deflecting the ball to a different fielder in the slips cordon. If the two batsmen cross each other, in attempting to take a run, before the catch was taken, the non-striking batsman at the time remains {{at the opposite end}} of the pitch as the new incoming batsman comes to the crease at his former end. This means, unless it is <b>now</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> over, he is now on strike and the incoming batsman is not.|$|E
25|$|In December 1936, King Edward VIII abdicated {{the throne}} {{in favour of}} his brother, who would become King George VI.

These coins fulfilled demand for coins until new coinage tools with the effigy of King George VI were ready.

25|$|Dot – In December 1936, King Edward VIII abdicated {{the throne}} {{in favour of}} his brother, who became King George VI. The {{problem was that the}} Royal Mint had been {{designing}} the effigy of King Edward VIII, and <b>now</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> effigy had to be created. The 1¢, 10¢ and 25¢ pieces in 1937 were struck from dies with a 1936 date on the reverse.

These coins fulfilled demand for coins until new coinage tools with the effigy of King George VI were ready. While the 10¢ and 25¢ coins are more common, the 1¢ coins are rare, with about a half-dozen known to exist. The dot after the date on the 1937 5¢ coin is a mint error caused by a chip in the master dies.|$|E
25|$|From 2012 onwards any repeat {{airing of}} the music video on {{television}} is <b>now</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> re-edited version which takes out the appearance of Jimmy Savile. In October 2012, revelations emerged which revealed that Savile {{was one of the}} worst paedophile sex abusers in Britain, and so his appearance on this charity video which helped raised funds for disadvantaged children in Africa and Britain had to be edited out for future broadcasts. The re-edited version is mainly the same as the original except the short 15 second scene with Savile who joined Peter Kay and actress Sally Lindsay is now re-edited to show Sally and Peter only, with a slowed down and repeated showing of Sally on her own next to Peter to fill the gap left by the absence of Savile, thus eliminating Savile from the 15 second section. The original version remains on YouTube.|$|E
25|$|At first, the Metropolitan had {{advocated}} a new underground line roughly following {{the line of}} the Edgware Road between the tube station and a point near Willesden Green. Indeed, construction advanced as far as the rebuilding of Edgware Road station to accommodate 4 platforms of 8-car length. Things changed, though, with the formation of the London Passenger Transport Board (LPTB) and the subsequent absorption of the Metropolitan. The solution was <b>now</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> branch of the Bakerloo line from Baker Street to serve new stations at St. John's Wood and Swiss Cottage, thereby rendering the existing stations of Lord's, Marlborough Road and Swiss Cottage on the parallel route redundant, and negating the need for the Met's extension from Edgware Road station. It was originally proposed that Swiss Cottage (Metropolitan) would remain open during peak hours for interchange with the Bakerloo, and that Lord's station would open for special cricketing events, but both were closed permanently as economy measures during the Second World War. The new line rose between the Metropolitan tracks at Finchley Road, providing cross-platform interchange with the Metropolitan line. Continuing north to Wembley Park, the new Bakerloo was to provide intermediate service on the Metropolitan line, allowing Metropolitan line trains to run non-stop between Finchley Road and Wembley Park, cutting seven minutes from journey times. At Wembley Park, the new Bakerloo would run on to serve Kingsbury, Queensbury, Canons Park and Stanmore, taking over the former Metropolitan branch. The Bakerloo extension, built as above, opened in 1939.|$|E

500|$|August 16 is a {{legal holiday}} in Vermont, known as Bennington Battle Day. The battlefield, <b>now</b> <b>a</b> <b>New</b> York state {{historic}} site, was designated a National Historic Landmark on January 20, 1961, and added to the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 1966. In the 1870s, the local historic society in Bennington commissioned the design and construction of the Bennington Battle Monument, which was complete in 1889 and dedicated in 1891 with ceremonies attended by President Benjamin Harrison. The Monument, an obelisk [...] high, is also listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Although the monument was not ready in time to mark the centennial of the battle, the 100th anniversary of the battle was marked by speeches attended by President Rutherford B. Hayes.|$|E
500|$|Having been {{released}} by Stevenage {{at the end}} of the 2010–11 season, Odubade signed for Conference National side Gateshead on 7 June 2011. He joined Gateshead on a free transfer, signing for the club alongside Eddie Odhiambo; the two had previously played alongside each other at Oxford United, Stevenage, and Newport County. On joining Gateshead, Odubade said [...] "I have parted company with Stevenage on good terms and this is <b>now</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> chapter for me. Gateshead is a good club that is moving in the right direction and I'm sure we can kick on next season. I don't look back with any regrets as things happen for a reason. I am always looking forward. Gateshead is a new challenge for me and I can only see good things coming from it". He made his Gateshead debut on 13 August 2011 in the club's 3–2 away win against Kidderminster Harriers at Aggborough, assisting Kris Gate's goal in the 80th minute. Odubade scored his first goal for Gateshead three days later at Gateshead International Stadium in Gateshead's 3–0 win against Mansfield Town, which was voted Goal of the Season in the club's end of season awards. His first season at Gateshead was disrupted by two-foot injuries midway through the campaign, with Odubade breaking his metatarsal bone on two occasions, subsequently missing a total of 18 games. Despite the injuries, he made 34 appearances throughout the season, scoring seven times. He signed a one-year contract extension with Gateshead in May 2012.|$|E
