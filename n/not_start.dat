5|$|Sounders coach Schmid made {{adjustments}} to his usual starting lineup. Pappa did <b>not</b> <b>start</b> {{due to a}} recent return from international duty with Guatemala, while star striker Martins was on the bench as well. Although he won the Golden Boot for most goals scored, Cooper was primarily a bench player throughout the year and did <b>not</b> <b>start</b> the match. Although lacking those playmakers, the Sounders came out attacking, and their first big chance came in the 10th minute when Rose slung a low cross near {{the face of the}} goal to Dempsey, whose resulting shot was off-frame.|$|E

5|$|The {{timing of}} black vultures' {{breeding}} season {{varies with the}} latitude at which they live. In the United States, birds in Florida begin breeding as early as January, for example, while those in Ohio generally do <b>not</b> <b>start</b> before March. In South America, Argentinian and Chilean birds begin egg-laying as early as September, while those further north on the continent typically wait until October. Some in South America breed even later than that—black vultures in Trinidad typically do <b>not</b> <b>start</b> until November, for example, and those in Ecuador may wait until February. Pairs are formed following a courtship ritual which is performed on the ground: several males circle a female with their wings partially open as they strut and bob their heads. They sometimes perform courtship flights, diving or chasing each other over their chosen nest site.|$|E

5|$|After taking {{only seven}} wickets at 61.00 {{in the first}} four Tests, Johnson was dropped for the Fifth Test at The Oval; Ring {{replaced}} him as the team's spinner. English skipper Norman Yardley won the toss and elected to bat on a rain-affected pitch, which was regarded as a surprising move by the majority of the press corps. Precipitation in the previous week caused an extremely wet outfield, which meant that the Test could <b>not</b> <b>start</b> until midday had passed. Former Australian Test batsman Jack Fingleton speculated that the Australians would have bowled if they had won the toss.|$|E
5|$|After the Olympics, Kerry took an {{extended}} break from competitive swimming. He {{was asked to}} return for the 1982 Commonwealth Games in Brisbane, so he made a comeback, but only did two weeks of solid training and missed selection, failing to win either of the backstroke events. In 1983, he began preparing for the Olympics, but did <b>not</b> <b>start</b> serious work until October. Kerry was confident {{in his ability to}} perform at international standards with sporadic preparation after long sabbaticals. He attributed this to his technique and ability to keep his 190cm, 80kg body in shape while not training.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of {{construction}} the hospital was Scotland's largest ever NHS construction project, cost £300million to build, most of which was provided by a private finance initiative arrangement; it {{was built on the}} site of the old Royal Scottish National Hospital. Originally to be called Forth Valley Hospital, it was granted royal status by Queen Elizabeth II, becoming Forth Valley Royal Hospital. It was hoped the new hospital would be ready by 2009, but medical services did <b>not</b> <b>start</b> to be transferred until August 2010, when the first patients were admitted. The process was completed in June 2011, and the queen officially opened the hospital on 6July 2011.|$|E

5|$|Before the 2009 season, Fredrikstad told Tegström {{that he was}} {{not part}} of the club's {{long-term}} plans and that he was welcome to find another club. Fredrikstad turned down an offer from Stabæk to buy the striker. He did <b>not</b> <b>start</b> a single match in the pre-season, but he came on as a substitute and scored a goal against Strømsgodset in the second match of the 2009 season. Tegström spent most of the 2009 season on the bench, but in the 2009 Norwegian Football Cup tie against Ranheim, he came on as a substitute and scored two goals in the extra time.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the race}} started, 78 riders {{had signed up}} for the race. Eighteen of those did <b>not</b> <b>start</b> the race, so the Tour began with 60 riders, {{including}} former winner Henri Cornet and future winners René Pottier and Lucien Petit-Breton. The riders were not grouped in teams, but most of them rode with an individual sponsor. Two of the cyclists—Catteau and Lootens—were Belgian, all other cyclists were French. Leading up {{to the start of the}} Tour, Wattelier, Trousselier, Pottier and Augereau were all considered the most likely contenders to win the event.|$|E
5|$|C.maxima {{originated}} in South America over 4,000 years ago, probably in Argentina and Uruguay. The plants {{are sensitive to}} frost, and they prefer both bright sunlight and soil with a pH of 6.0 to 7.0. C.maxima did <b>not</b> <b>start</b> to spread into North America until after the arrival of Columbus. Varieties were in use by native peoples of the United States by the 16th century. Types of C.maxima include triloba, zapallito, zipinka, Banana, Delicious, Hubbard, Marrow (C.maxima Marrow), Show, and Turban.|$|E

5|$|Ciomadul {{has been}} active for over half a million years, with the oldest {{activity}} between 1,000,000 and 750,000 years ago forming lava domes. Older estimates indicate that activity did <b>not</b> <b>start</b> before 250,000 years ago, while more recent research indicated a start of volcanism over 600,000 years ago. Volcanism at Ciomadul consisted mostly of the extrusion of lava domes, their collapse forming block-and-ash flows and subplinian and Vulcanian eruptions.|$|E
5|$|Copper {{was first}} used in ancient Britain in about the 3rd or 2nd Century BC. In North America, copper mining began with {{marginal}} workings by Native Americans. Native copper {{is known to have}} been extracted from sites on Isle Royale with primitive stone tools between 800 and 1600. Copper metallurgy was flourishing in South America, particularly in Peru around 1000 AD. Copper burial ornamentals from the 15th century have been uncovered, but the metal's commercial production did <b>not</b> <b>start</b> until the early 20th century.|$|E
5|$|Duquesne opened conference play on January 6 in a {{match against}} the Richmond Spiders, a team which the Dukes had not {{defeated}} since the Spiders joined the Atlantic 10in 2001. This game marked {{the return of}} Melquan Bolding, though he did <b>not</b> <b>start</b> and scored only three points in fourteen minutes of playing time. Richmond managed to extend their streak, defeating the Dukes 86–80, while Saunders maintained his nation-leading position and now placed eighth in both blocks and steals. Duquesne then traveled to Dayton, Ohio where they lost to the Dayton Flyers 72–78 in overtime {{in front of a}} crowd of 13,435, the largest crowd the team would see all season. Senior Jason Duty was fouled on a 3-point attempt {{at the end of the}} game when his team was down by one, but made only one of three foul shots, sending the game into overtime. Melquan Bolding scored 13 points in 36 minutes, though he did <b>not</b> <b>start,</b> and Saunders came into the game now leading the nation in rebounds.|$|E
