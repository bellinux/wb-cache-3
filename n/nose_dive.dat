25|$|Two and a {{half minutes}} after the initial collision, the {{outboard}} section of the right wing above engine number four exploded, causing parts of the wing to break off. Six seconds after this explosion, another explosion occurred {{in the area of the}} number three engine, causing the pylon and engine to both break off and fall to the ground in flames. Six {{and a half}} seconds after the second explosion, a third explosion occurred, destroying most of the right wing, including the wing tip. The aircraft then went into a violent <b>nose</b> <b>dive,</b> striking the ground at a high velocity of about 220 knots (407km/h) and killing all 100 passengers and the nine crew members on board.|$|E
25|$|That same day, {{a search}} party was formed and {{dispatched}} to the site {{under the command of}} Captain Harry Cobb RCAF. With no access to the site, the group had to trail-blaze its way through the forest guided by an observation plane which would <b>nose</b> <b>dive</b> to indicate the location of the wreckage. According to Cobb's testimony, all passengers were killed on impact, which was also confirmed by Dr. J.-A. Melançon, the coroner, who reported the deaths as being accidental. The aircraft had caught fire with only some assemblies, the rear fuselage and the engines having been spared by the blaze. Of the crew and passengers, only three bodies could be identified.|$|E
25|$|The 2.5 TL was {{positioned}} as the sporty {{model and the}} 3.2 focused more upon a luxurious ride. There were minimal styling differences between the two, but the 3.2 TL had larger tires despite the 2.5 TL's more sporty marketing. Moreover, the added power in the 3.2 TL gave it better acceleration. The V6 engine in the 3.2 TL was mounted in a front-rear, or longitudinal position. This contrasted with the more typical transverse engine mount style, and was intended to provide better weight distribution and reduce <b>nose</b> <b>dive.</b> The engine mount design resulted in an elongated hood for the first generation TL. The inline-5 engine in the 2.5 TL competed with similar 5-cylinder engines offered in Audi and Volvo models.|$|E

25|$|In March 1993, AVM Farooq Umar became MD PIA {{and also}} open skies from Karachi to Dubai were {{declared}} and 12 private air lines {{were allowed to}} operate domestically in Pakistan. Both steps came simultaneously and put great pressure on PIA's financial performance. Farooq Umar to meet the challenge, fought the battle of open skies and opened up six new routes to the Persian Gulf and CIS countries along with tourists attraction 'air safari'. He also made major changes in routes and schedules and started non stop flights from Lahore and Islamabad to JFK and Canada. PIA added Jakarta, Fujairah, Baku and Al-Ain to its destinations in 1994. In addition, PIA became a client of three flight-reservation systems, namely: Sabre, Galileo and Amadeus. 'Air Safari' flights were launched in 1994 using Boeing 737–300 aircraft that used to fly over the Karakoram mountain range. Farooq Umar handed over PIA to another MD in March 1996, closing his tenure with great success and leaving PIA profitable with a profit for the previous six months of more than 55 million PKR. After his departure PIA started to <b>nose</b> <b>dive.</b> PIA purchased a Boeing 747 flight simulator to train its pilots. It also purchased another used Airbus A300 aircraft. A Tupolev Tu-154 aircraft was also leased briefly in 1996 {{to cope with a}} surge in passenger traffic during summer 1996. Flights to Beirut were resumed the same year as well.|$|E

500|$|While {{heading south}} down river, the {{airplane}} {{was seen to}} be behind the sightseeing helicopter, which was going about half the speed. The pilot of another helicopter (who was refueling at the heliport) saw the impending accident, and attempted to warn both the airborne helicopter and the plane by radio, but received no response. At 11:53:14a.m., the Piper's right wing crashed into the Eurocopter, severing {{the right wing of}} the airplane and multiple rotor blades from the helicopter. Most witnesses reported the plane entering a <b>nose</b> <b>dive</b> while spiraling into the river, whilst the helicopter simply dropped into the water. The collision occurred at approximately [...] MSL altitude and was caught on tape by an Italian tourist. Less than a minute after the collision occurred, the Teterboro controller contacted the Newark tower to inquire about the airplane, and was told that the airplane had not contacted Newark.|$|E

500|$|In 1912–1913 {{a series}} of fatal crashes of Wright {{airplanes}} bought by the U.S. Army called into question their safety and design. The death toll reached 11 by 1913, half {{of them in the}} Wright model C. All six model C Army airplanes crashed. They had a tendency to <b>nose</b> <b>dive,</b> but Orville insisted that stalls were caused by pilot error. He cooperated with the Army to equip the airplanes with a rudimentary flight indicator to help the pilot avoid climbing too steeply. A government investigation said the Wright C was [...] "dynamically unsuited for flying", and the American military ended its use of airplanes with [...] "pusher" [...] type propellers, including models made by both the Wright and Curtiss companies, in which the engine was located behind the pilot and likely to crush him in a crash. Orville resisted the switch to manufacturing [...] "tractor"-type propeller aircraft, worried that a design change could threaten the Wright patent infringement case against Curtiss.|$|E

50|$|The key {{hallmark}} of the Oriental Roller is its flying style.

Some breeds fly up to 1000 m high, others stay in the air for several hours.|$|R
50|$|Barnstormers {{performed}} {{a variety of}} stunts, with some specializing as stunt pilots or aerialists.

On the 30th, six combats were engaged in, with two enemy aircraft being shot down. Lieutenants Strahm and Jervey and Lambert and Pope started on a photographic mission between Montmedy and Longuyon when they were attacked by 14 enemy Fokkers. A wild combat followed in which two enemy aircraft were shot down and another went into a straight <b>nose</b> <b>dive</b> into the ground. The squadron's formation, however, had been driven off-course during the mission and one squadron aircraft {{had to return to}} Vavincourt, being badly shot-up. Lieutenants Strahm and Jervey, however continued their mission, taking a total of 66 photographs. Bad weather kept the squadron grounded until 4 November when operations resumed. On that day, three German aircraft were shot down.|$|E

50|$|By way of example, when {{a vehicle}} accelerates, a weight {{transfer}} {{toward the rear}} wheels can occur. An outside observer might witness this as the vehicle visibly leans to the back, or squats. Conversely, under braking, weight transfer {{toward the front of}} the car can occur. Under hard braking it might be clearly visible even from inside the vehicle as the <b>nose</b> <b>dives</b> toward the ground (most of this will be due to load transfer). Similarly, during changes in direction (lateral acceleration), weight transfer to the outside of the direction of the turn can occur.|$|R

60|$|Apart {{from the}} procreative necessity, was woman an {{unavoidable}} evil? The doctor's untrammelled thoughts {{began to climb}} high, spin, <b>nose</b> <b>dive</b> and loop the loop.

Given the power of determining sex that science was slowly winning today, and why should we have so many women about? A drastic elimination of the creatures would be quite practicable. A fantastic world to a vulgar imagination, no doubt, but to a calmly reasonable mind by no means fantastic. But this was where the case of Sir Richmond became so interesting. Was it really true that the companionship of women was necessary to these energetic creative types? Was it the fact that the drive of life towards action, as distinguished from contemplation, arose out of sex and needed to be refreshed by the reiteration of that motive? It was a plausible proposition: it marched with all the doctor's ideas of natural selection and of the conditions of a survival that have made us what we are. It was in tune with the Freudian analyses.|$|E

50|$|Usually {{seen on the}} ground, but {{sometimes}} perching on wires, these birds are not secretive.

They also call while perched. The nest is built in a depression in the ground and two to four eggs form the typical clutch. The eggs are broad oval with some gloss.
