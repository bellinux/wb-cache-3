5|$|Stegosaurus madagascariensis from Madagascar {{is known}} solely from teeth and was {{described}} by Piveteau in 1926. The teeth were variously attributed to a stegosaur, the theropod Majungasaurus, a hadrosaur or even a crocodylian, but is <b>now</b> <b>considered</b> a possible ankylosaur.|$|E
5|$|The Kerinci Seblat National Park, Sumatra's largest, was {{estimated}} to contain a population of around 500 rhinos in the 1980s, but due to poaching, this population is <b>now</b> <b>considered</b> extinct. The survival of any animals in Peninsula Malaysia is extremely unlikely.|$|E

5|$|The black drongo {{was once}} {{considered}} a subspecies of the fork-tailed drongo (Dicrurus adsimilis), {{a close relative}} that diverged relatively recently. The two are <b>now</b> <b>considered</b> distinct species, with the fork-tailed drongo restricted to Africa and separated from the Asian range of the black drongo.|$|E
5|$|The film is <b>now</b> <b>considered</b> lost. It {{is unknown}} {{when the film}} was lost, {{but if it was}} in Universal's vaults it would have been {{deliberately}} destroyed along with the remaining copies of Universal's silent era films in 1948.|$|E
5|$|The {{species was}} first {{mentioned}} in the scientific literature as Tremella auricula by Carl Linnaeus in his 1753 Species Plantarum, and later (1789) described by Jean Baptiste François Pierre Bulliard as Tremella auricula-judae. However, the genus Tremella is now reserved for fungal species that live as parasites on other fungi. Tremella auricula-judae is <b>now</b> <b>considered</b> a basionym. In 1791, Bulliard transferred the species to the genus Peziza. In 1822, Elias Magnus Fries transferred the species to Exidia, and, in so doing, sanctioned the name. In 1860, Miles Joseph Berkeley described the species {{as a member of}} Hirneola, a genus described by Fries in 1848, <b>now</b> <b>considered</b> synonymous with Auricularia.|$|E

5|$|The taxonomic {{history of}} Eucteniza spiders {{includes}} nearly 20 named species and four genera; the three additional generic names are <b>now</b> <b>considered</b> taxonomic synonyms of Eucteniza, and several named species have similarly {{been determined to}} be synonyms of previously described species.|$|E
5|$|While it was {{formerly}} considered a megaloolithid, Cairanoolithus is <b>now</b> <b>considered</b> to belong its own monotypic oofamily, Cairanoolithidae. It {{belongs to the}} dinosauroid-spherulitic basic type, a group including sauropod eggs and ornithischian eggs, but paraphyletically excluding theropod eggs.|$|E
5|$|With the {{exception}} of Lambis and Terebellum, the remaining taxa were previously allocated in the genus Strombus, including L.gigas. However, according to Simone, only Strombus gracilior, Strombus alatus and Strombus pugilis, the type species, remained within Strombus, as they constituted a distinct group based on at least five synapomorphies (traits that are shared by two or more taxa and their most recent common ancestor). The remaining taxa were previously considered subgenera and were elevated to genus level by Simone. Genus Eustrombus (<b>now</b> <b>considered</b> a synonym of Lobatus), in this case, included Eustrombus gigas (<b>now</b> <b>considered</b> a synonym of Lobatus gigas) and Eustrombus goliath (= Lobatus goliath), which were thus considered closely related.|$|E

5|$|Acer pseudoplatanus {{was first}} {{described}} by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in his Species Plantarum in 1753. It is the type species in the maple genus Acer. Many forms and varieties have been proposed, including natural varieties such as var. macrocarpum Spach, var. microcarpum Spach, and var. tomentosum Tausch, and forms such as f. erythrocarpum (Carrière) Pax, f. purpureum (Loudon) Rehder, and f. variegatum (Weston) Rehder. These are all <b>now</b> <b>considered</b> to be synonyms of Acer pseudoplatanus L.|$|E
5|$|Aetosaur remains {{have been}} found since the early 19th century, {{although}} the very first remains that were described were mistaken for fish scales. Aetosaurs were later recognized as crocodile relatives, with early paleontologists considering them to be semiaquatic scavengers. They are <b>now</b> <b>considered</b> to have been entirely terrestrial animals. Some forms have characteristics {{that may have been}} adaptations to digging for food. There is also evidence that some if not all aetosaurs made nests.|$|E
5|$|After its {{discovery}} in 1897, {{it has never}} been recorded again and it is <b>now</b> <b>considered</b> extinct; the presence of introduced black rats on María Madre may have contributed to its extinction. Oryzomys nelsoni was a large species, distinguished in particular by its long tail, robust skull, and large incisors. It was reddish to yellowish above and mostly white below. Its diet may have included plant material and small animals.|$|E

5|$|Allosaurus sibiricus was {{described}} in 1914 by A. N. Riabinin {{on the basis of}} a bone, later identified as a partial fourth metatarsal, from the Early Cretaceous of Buryatia, Russia. It was transferred to Chilantaisaurus in 1990, but is <b>now</b> <b>considered</b> a nomen dubium indeterminate beyond Theropoda.|$|E
5|$|Although Stegosaurus is {{undoubtedly}} <b>now</b> <b>considered</b> {{to have been}} quadrupedal, some discussion has occurred over whether it could have reared up on its hind legs, using its tail to form a tripod with its hind limbs, and browsing for higher foliage. This has been proposed by Bakker and opposed by Carpenter. A study by Mallison (2010) found support a rearing up posture in Kentrosaurus, though not for ability for the tail {{to act as a}} tripod.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of release in Denmark in 1886, critics from the daily {{newspapers}} were generally enthusiastic about Ved Vejen. It is <b>now</b> <b>considered</b> {{an important contribution to}} Danish literature, listed in the Danish Culture Canon. In 1988 it was made into a feature film Katinka, directed by Max von Sydow.|$|E
