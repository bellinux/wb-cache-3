Though <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> executed for blasphemy yet in Pakistan, the accused often remain imprisoned for an extensive amount of time while the case is being processed.

5|$|In Stockholm, Sweden, {{journalist}} Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig), {{co-owner of}} Millennium magazine, {{has lost a}} libel case brought against him by businessman Hans-Erik Wennerström (Ulf Friberg). Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara), a brilliant but troubled investigator and hacker, compiles an extensive background check on Blomkvist for business magnate Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer), who has a special task for him. In exchange for the promise of damning information about Wennerström, Blomkvist agrees to investigate the disappearance and assumed murder of Henrik's grandniece, Harriet, 40 years ago. After moving to the Vanger family's compound, Blomkvist uncovers a notebook containing {{a list of names}} and numbers that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> able to decipher.|$|E
5|$|Within {{days of the}} murder, D.C. police {{alleged that}} the crime scene had been {{tampered}} with, but no charges were filed for over two years. In late 2008, police charged Price, Zaborsky and Ward with obstruction of justice and conspiracy related to alleged tampering with the crime scene. The men were acquitted of the charges in June 2010. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> charged with Wone's killing. In November 2008, Wone's widow filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Price, Zaborsky and Ward; the suit was settled on August 3, 2011 for an undisclosed sum and agreement.|$|E

25|$|There {{have been}} about 100 {{significant}} earthquakes annually from 2010 to 2012. Past averages were 21 a year. This {{is believed to be}} due to the deep disposal of wastewater from fracking. None has exceeded a magnitude of 5.6, and <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> killed.|$|E
60|$|While this {{conversation}} <b>was</b> going on <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> idle. Each {{took up his}} station at a loop-hole, and several shots were fired whenever the movement of a blade of corn showed the lurking place of an Indian.|$|R
60|$|This {{proved to}} <b>be</b> the case. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> {{hit by the}} fire from the boats and, now that the {{shooting}} had ceased, the natives, with shouts of triumph, ran out from the forest. There were some hundreds of them.|$|R

25|$|This {{accomplishment}} led to {{a federal}} investigation and caused some to think Jackson was wrongly targeted because of his efforts. Indeed, some of his supporters deride the scrutiny of his casual friendships as a racist effort to undermine a prominent black official and several respected black businessmen, noting that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> charged with a crime.|$|E
25|$|According to Orville H. Schell, Chairman of the Americas Watch Committee, and Head of Amnesty International's 1982 {{fact-finding mission}} to Sri Lanka, the UNP {{government}} {{at that time}} did not institute an independent investigation to establish responsibility for these killings in May and June 1981 and take measures against those responsible. although <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> indicted for the crimes yet.|$|E

Their families have since set up an organization dedicated to bringing the kidnappers to justice, and if possible, locating the missing mineworkers' remains. The mineworkers' whereabouts are unknown as of June 2014, as is the location of their remains (if any). <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> convicted of their deaths.|$|E

25|$|Atiyah {{and others}} have {{suggested}} that the classification ought to be simplified by constructing some geometric object that the groups act on and then classifying these geometric structures. The problem is that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> able to suggest an easy way to find such a geometric structure associated to a simple group. In some sense the classification does work by finding geometric structures such as BN-pairs, but this only comes {{at the end of a}} very long and difficult analysis of the structure of a finite simple group.|$|E
25|$|Due {{to lack of}} evidence, Zoran Stojanović was pardoned in 2007 and {{released}} from custody. In late 2009, President of Serbia Boris Tadić pardoned Zoran Stojanović, declaring that the trial was unjust, which opened {{the question as to}} whether he had jurisdiction because Stojanović was sentenced by an international High court. Stojanović's ethnic Albanian wife and their two children have been exposed to intensified intimidation, most notably because other Albanians consider her a traitor for marrying a Serb. As of 2011, <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> found guilty of participation in the Račak massacre and no known investigations are currently being held.|$|E

With a single blow of his giant paw he kills the largest and best animal he can find and he usually takes the pick of a herd. He makes a single meal of the animal, and it is usually a meal that would provide a camp full of men for a week, and disappears, never to return to that locality again that season.|$|E

25|$|According to polls, most {{computer}} {{scientists believe that}} P≠NP. A key reason for this belief is that after decades of studying these problems <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> {{able to find a}} polynomial-time algorithm for any of more than 3000 important known NP-complete problems (see List of NP-complete problems). These algorithms were sought long before the concept of NP-completeness was even defined (Karp's 21 NP-complete problems, among the first found, were all well-known existing problems at the time they were shown to be NP-complete). Furthermore, the result P = NP would imply many other startling results that are currently believed to be false, such as NP = co-NP and P = PH.|$|E

25|$|In October 2009, workmen {{clearing}} vegetation {{from the}} bottom of the M5 at Junction 14 discovered human bones in a black bin bag dumped in the bushes at the side of the motorway. The police were called soon after, and it was soon established that the bones were those of a young female. A few days later, DNA found on the remains confirmed that the body was that of Melanie Hall, who disappeared in June 1996 after a night out in Bath, Somerset, and who had been declared dead in absentia in 2004. Dental records confirmed that the body was hers, and the police began a formal investigation into her murder.
