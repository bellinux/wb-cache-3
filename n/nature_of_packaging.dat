40|$|The {{economic}} analysis of packaging law is driven {{largely by the}} view that packaging provides consumers with credible information about the attributes and origin of goods. However, multiple empirical observations suggest that the <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>packaging</b> is more complex. In this paper, I develop a theoretical decision model that concisely explains these observations and makes a variety of novel predictions. The model provides an economic basis {{for the use of}} "anti-dilution " laws, which broadly protect the cues of a …rm’s trademark. Interestingly, the model suggests that nature’s cues can be “diluted” if copied by lower-quality …rms, providing justi…cation for anti-dilution protection for nature’s cues.

For 35 years, {{it has been}} popularly believed that viral dsDNA-packaging apparatuses are pentameric rotation motors. Recently, a third class of hexameric motor {{has been found in}} bacteriophage phi 29 that utilizes a mechanism of revolution without rotation, friction, coiling, or torque. This review addresses how packaging motors control dsDNA one-way traffic; how four electropositive layers in the channel interact with the electronegative phosphate backbone to generate four steps in translocating one dsDNA helix; how motors resolve the mismatch between 10. 5 bases and 12 connector subunits per cycle of revolution; and how ATP regulates sequential action of motor ATPase. Since motors with all number of subunits can utilize the revolution mechanism, this finding helps resolve puzzles and debates concerning the oligomeric <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>packaging</b> motors in many phage systems.

The partition coefficients of a set of 44 systems consisted of 4 food simulants, 6 migrants and 2 packaging materials were investigated. A set of 6 molecular descriptors representing various structural characteristics of food simulants (2 descriptors), migrants (3 descriptors) and polymers (1 descriptor) was used as data set. This data set was divided into three subsets: training, test and prediction. ANFIS as a new modeling technique was applied for the first time in this field.

At IKEA, the product and the packaging are developed concurrently with the aim of lowering the total cost from the supplier to the customer. During the years 2002 to 2004, a pckaging redesign project was conducted at IKEA. The purpose of the project was to redesign the packaging for an existing product in order to minimize empty space. Very early on, it was evident that the suggested new packaging solution required a product redesign along with new manufacturing and packaging equipment. The product, tealights, was a complicated product due to safety regulations, standard sizes, etc. The project group not only had to involve different functions within IKEA but also had to convince a tealight manufacturer to collaborate.

40|$|Several {{patients}} with severe combined immunodeficiency-X 1 disease and adenosine deaminase deficiency have been cured by retroviral-mediated gene therapy. Despite the earlier success, {{the production of}} retroviral vectors for clinical gene therapy is cumbersome, costly and lacks safety features because of the adherent <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>packaging</b> cells and the necessity to supplement the culture media with bovine serum. The {{aim of this study}} was to generate a retrovirus packaging cell line that could be used for the production of large clinical batch vectors. Bicistronic vectors containing an internal ribosomal entry site followed by a selection gene were used to express Moloney murine leukemia gag-pol and amphotropic envelope viral proteins in HEK 293 cells. The candidate clone (293 GP-A 2) that was selected as the packaging cell line could release recombinant green fluorescent protein retroviruses at 4 times 107 infectious viral particles per ml. Similar titers were achieved after these cells were adapted to grow in suspension and serum-free media. Furthermore, using the same culture conditions viral titers proved to be stable for a 3 -month culture period. The 293 GP-A 2 packaging cell line has the potential to be cultured in bioreactors, opening the possibility for large-scale use of retroviral vectors in late stage clinical trials.

40|$|The {{construction}} sector {{is responsible for}} around 28 % of the total waste volume generated in Europe, which exceeds the amount of household waste. This {{has led to an}} increase of different research studies focusing on construction waste quantification. However, within the research studies made, packaging waste has been analyzed to a limited extent. This article focuses on the packaging waste stream generated in the {{construction sector}}. To this purpose current on-site waste packaging management has been assessed by monitoring ten Mediterranean residential building works. The findings of the experimental data collection revealed that the incentive measures implemented by the construction company to improve on-site waste sorting failed to achieve the intended purpose, showing low segregation ratios. Subsequently, through an analytical study the generation patterns for packaging waste are established, leading to the identification of the prevailing kinds of packaging and the products responsible for their generation. Results indicate that plastic waste generation maintains a constant trend throughout the whole construction process, while cardboard becomes predominant {{towards the end of the}} construction works with switches and sockets from the electricity stage.

40|$|Purpose_ Packaging is a {{strategic}} tool that merits holistic management. Three managerial disciplines {{have the potential}} to significantly influence packaging strategy: marketing, logistics, and ethics. Despite the multidimensional <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>packaging,</b> the academic literature tends to analyse these three dimensions separately. To address this shortcoming of a more integrated approach, the aim of the study is to identify the main integration areas among marketing, logistics, and ethics in packaging innovation projects in the retail grocery sector. Design/methodology/approach_ 186 cases of packaging design were selected and the data collected were analysed by quantitative content analysis (cross-tabulation). Findings_ Results show that simultaneous integration among marketing, logistics and ethics recurs in only one third of the cases. The main area of integration is between marketing and ethics. To a lesser extent, there is a significant degree of integration between marketing and logistics as well as between logistics and ethics. Nevertheless, the findings of this initial analysis suggest that the potential in terms of integration has yet to be exploited. Practical implications_ Taking a holistic view of innovation in packaging, the study could assist managers participating in packaging management by providing a conceptual instrument for the integrated evaluation of the multidimensional relationships among the three perspectives. Originality/value_ The paper provides the first empirical exploration in this field and an original conceptual framework that could serve both as a theoretical reference point for future research and as a managerial tool, recognising the urgent need for a careful understanding of how marketing, logistics, and ethics may be integrated in innovation projects...|$|E
40|$|To date, {{most studies}} on the fate and removal of {{endocrine}} disrupting compounds (EDCs) and pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) in wastewater focus on their fate in municipal wastewater treatment plants, and mostly under aerobic condition. There are limited studies related to anaerobic condition and (to our knowledge) no study on the removal of EDCs in landfill leachate by AnMBR. Moreover, for most studies under anaerobic condition, the removal of EDCs was only reported in the liquid phase; solid phase extraction was not reported, thereby preventing mass balance in the studies. This research was conducted to investigate the potential of AnMBR for reduction of organic strength and removal of EDCs in landfill leachate. A novel lab-scale upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor equipped with dual-flat sheet ultrafiltration and microfiltration membrane modules was designed and constructed to test the potential to remove EDCs and traditional landfill leachate constituents (COD, turbidity). The target EDC was 17 β-estradiol (E 2), a prevalent female hormone used for contraceptives and hormone replacement therapy. Due to the <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>packaging</b> and widespread use in households, the entry of E 2 into landfills is highly likely, and has been reported. The quantification of E 2 from liquid phase in this project is performed {{by the use of}} solid-phase microextraction (SPME) with GC/MS. Batch assays were conducted to determine the anaerobic biodegradability of E 2 as well as to measure the respective distribution coefficients of E 2 to PAC, colloids and anaerobic sludge biomass. In the adsorption batch assays, {{it was found that the}} PAC has stronger adsorption potential than anaerobic sludge. The adsorption potential of E 2, E 1 and EE 2 on sludge follows the order E 23 ̆eEE 23 ̆eE 1 which correlates to the Kow values (4. 01, 3. 67, 3. 1, respectively). However, all three compounds showed the same adsorption potential to the Norit 20 B PAC. The biodegradability of E 2 was investigated in both liquid and solid phase and under several conditions such as methanogenesis, methanogenesis with aid from PAC, and methanogenesis with additional alternative electron acceptors added (sulfate and nitrate). E 2 was found to transform to E 1 under all tested conditions. The compounds are present in both liquid and solid phase. E 2 and E 1 were not detected (3 ̆c 4 ng/L and 3 ̆c 10 ng/L, respectively) in the liquid phase after 25 days in most cases except the case of adding additional sulfate. The AnMBR was designed, fabricated and operated for 2 years. During the stable condition period of the AnMBR, the high removal efficiencies of COD and E 2 achieved were around 92...|$|E
40|$|New food {{packaging}} protects the product, seduces the consumer, and follows the law. The challenge {{is in keeping}} up with the latest trends. At Owino market in Kampala, Uganda, there are times when the market becomes flooded in more ways than one. First with the rains, and then with an excess of produce due to over-production after the rains. Crop production and yields in Uganda, like elsewhere, depend very much on the rainy seasons. In the market, Sarah Masaaba beats her competitors by cleaning her fresh produce and then wrapping it in fine green leaves and dry produce in transparent polythene sheets. It gives her produce that added attraction for some customers. Packaging {{is as important as the}} product itself. It protects the product against damage and spoilage, improves handling, transport, informs the buyers about the contents and will make the produce easier to use. Sarah Masaaba and thousands of other tradeswomen know that the crucial determinants for profitable and safe trade in horticultural produce, as with all other perishable goods, are that the goods reach the consumer safe and whole. In many ACP countries, the packaging of horticultural produce for the domestic market is usually carried out at the production area, but some farmers transport their produce from farms to go downs or retailer shops in containers not specifically designed to carry produce. This affects the nutritional and storage quality. More still, in particular in larger enterprises, or where produce is pooled for export, it is packed in containers that facilitate accumulation of ethylene gases in storage. This accelerates the aging of produce. In Uganda, post harvest losses account for 30 % of cost of production in agricultural produce. In Senegal, research has shown that half the failures of small-scale food enterprises are due to bad distribution, and spoilage from poor packaging. The boxes box It is not just customer care and being economical with your produce that make it necessary for food processors and retailers to pay more attention to {{food packaging}}. There is also a growing volume of legislation. Each country has its own requirements for local and imported produce, and its standards are often derived from the guidelines of the international Codex Alimentarius Commission. This has drawn up standards for processing, labelling, presentation, advertising, weights, hygiene, and practices in processing and handling as well as packaging material requirements. They are complex, and sometimes hard for the small-scale operator to obtain, but they are available in national bureaux of standards, ministries, chambers of commerce, university food science departments, and embassies. Importing countries also require evidence that processed food has had a Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point check. The HACCP check examines critical points on the path taken by food from the farm-gate to the final distributor: purchase, storage, pre-preparation, cooking, cooling and packaging. It is in the West that Codex Alimentarius and HACCP standards are applied most stringently, but since they directly affect exports from ACP countries, they will soon be incorporated into the laws of most ACP countries. They may not be rigorously applied, for lack of adequate mechanisms, but they will be there, in a statute book near you. The role of technology A similar trickle-down effect will affect the <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>packaging,</b> and its production, from the paradoxal perspective of environmental laws. Many Western nations are reducing the amount of material and energy used in packaging food and non-foods, while respecting hygiene laws. The use of non-recyclable plastics is being minimised, with recyclable materials such as cloth and non-wood paper being preferred. An extreme example: a factory in Wageningen in The Netherlands, about two kilometres from the Spore offices, produces degradable waste-bags from maize cobs, for the collection of household organic waste to central composting sites. Here lies a future business opportunity for a resourceful ACP packager! The concern for dematerialisation is not, though, always anti-plastic. In Switzerland, consumers shopping bags in plastic are about twenty times thicker than the ubiquitous thin blue plastic bags which now pollute cities and green belts the whole world over. The reason: a thicker bag will be used more often, and the energy used in production will be lower. Similar calculations lie behind recent changes in the shape of juice cartons in Europe. Taller and thinner, more can be shipped in a lorry, and more placed on shop shelves all requiring less energy. Banana leaf, or banana skin? The sums guiding the choice of packaging are complex, and in the future rare will be the times that a banana leaf wins over something manufactured. Yet for ACP processors and shippers, it is not just a question of getting proper information about laws and trade trends. It is much more about accessing the technology to produce the right cartons and cans. The sale of obsolete packing plants to ACP entrepreneurs, and the adoption of complex HACCP practices, may not be deliberate ploys to exclude some produce from Western markets, but one can see how the idea arises. While trade barriers fall, the technology barriers get higher. That requires a different strategy than demanding exemptions and quotas. It requires machines.

40|$|Random winding {{is widely}} used for the {{preparation}} <b>of</b> yarn <b>packages</b> used {{in a variety of}} textile processes. Ribboning caused by overwinding of yarn turns at certain places within the package is a basic problem encountered in this process. Standard random winders incorporate some means of ribbon breaking, which strictly speaking have limited effectiveness. The research reported in thesis was undertaken to realise a random winder capable of detecting the occurrence of ribboning, and taking the ribbon breaking action at these precise times, and thereby achieve 'active' ribbon breaking. Such a winder was realised by the addition of suitable transducers to a standard random winder, which could be controlled by a PC. Winding trials carried out using this equipment established the effectiveness of the concept and also the greater freedom from ribboning the method achieved in comparison with other available methods. Unwinding trials carried out by suitably modifying the winder for measuring yarn unwinding tension were also used to establish the effectiveness of active ribbon breaking. Preliminary experiments carried out on the above apparatus showed the possibility of constructing a Angle of Double Traverse (ADT) diagram on the VDU of the PC during winding operations, which could serve as a useful aid to follow the progress of the winding operation. It was very useful for showing the occurrence of major and minor ribboning in the wound package, and also for visually indicating the effectiveness of the ribbon breaking procedures. The diagram was of further use in studying the <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>package</b> driving by the grooved drum. The case of driving a deformable body such as a yarn package on a comparatively non-deformable grooved drum is important for understanding how the package rotates without any obvious slipping. By varying the winding conditions, it was in fact shown that some measurable slip occurs, and these relationships were experimentally established. Computer simulation is useful to determine the stresses within a wound package, particularly as these cannot be measured using conventional techniques. The results of such a simulation carried out on a random wound package and the comparison of the results with those obtained for a precision wound package are also presented...|$|R

A gap exists in the experience literature on the package holiday, a high value, unique and complex service that provides a fragmented experience which can take place over several months or more. The research sits within a marketing management and consumer behaviour theoretical framework and focuses on the 'grey' market segment, of particular interest to industry. The aim is to critically evaluate these holiday makers‘ experiences. Design/methodological/approach A Literature review discussed the <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> the <b>package</b> holiday and the experience as it relates to travel. The methodology takes a social constructionist epistemological orientation with an interpretive phenomenological philosophy. A qualitative, inductive approach ensued. Interviews in Tenerife were conducted with Thomson Holidays consumers, part of TUI Plc, and the largest international providers <b>of</b> <b>package</b> holidays. Template analysis was applied to the transcriptions. An interview took place with the Corporate Director of TUI, the objective being to evaluate management‘s perspectives of the provision of the experience. These findings will be analysed to add further depth and insights to the research. Limitations and ethical procedures are discussed. Findings Preliminary findings identified the importance of security, familiarity, value for money, local airport departures and socialising. Brand loyalty and repeat visits are exceptionally high. Originality/value The research provides new insights into the 'grey' market‘s package holiday experience which is of value to tour operators and academics specialising in this area...|$|R
