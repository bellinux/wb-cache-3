5|$|Today {{the former}} Victorian Railways {{locomotive}} fleet has {{been split into}} two, with the N, A and P classes utilised by V/Line on passenger services, with the remainder with Pacific National or other private operators in freight use. No new passenger locomotives have been built since the 1980s, with Diesel Multiple Units being acquired instead. Freight operations have seen the re-powering of the G and X classes, {{as well as the}} restoration to service of stored locomotives, <b>now</b> <b>up</b> to 50 years old.|$|E
5|$|By 1910, {{there were}} 18 daily {{services}} along the Clevedon branch, four on Sundays. A GWR pagoda hut {{was built in}} the 1910s at the east end of the eastbound platform, but this was removed some ten years later. By the 1920s Yatton had 40 staff employed, including a boy selling chocolate and cigarettes, and issued almost 60,000 tickets. Traffic on the Clevedon branch was still climbing, <b>now</b> <b>up</b> to 21 services on weekdays and five on Sundays. However, despite this success, there were some problems. Better road transport was reducing traffic along the Wrington line, and the main line was stretched to capacity. To combat this latter problem, goods loops were laid either side of the station – east for 1.25 miles to Claverham from 6 April 1925 and west for 1.75 miles to Huish level crossing on 26 May 1925. The station itself however remained a two-track pinch point.|$|E

25|$|With {{the first}} {{production}} car {{shown to the}} public in 1993, Porsche had only to meet certain design criteria--the requirement that production-based cars have storage space for a typical suitcase had already been fulfilled, as the Dauer road car was able to carry luggage. The flat bottom of the 962 Le Mans also fit with GT rules. Three more modifications were necessary to fully comply: Narrower tires than the 962 had run in Group C, a larger fuel tank (<b>now</b> <b>up</b> to 120 litres), and the reinstallation of a restrictor for the engine, although this one would be larger than the one they had run in Group C.|$|E

By July the 46th was back in Italy, <b>now</b> <b>up</b> to strength (largely from anti-aircraft gunners who had been retrained as infantrymen), as part of Lieutenant General Sir Oliver Leese's British Eighth Army's V Corps, under Lieutenant General Charles Keightley, on the Adriatic coast. The division was involved in heavy fighting during Operation Olive, the Eighth Army's major assault on the Gothic Line defences in September and October.|$|E

25|$|Unfortunately, Stibor de Beckov died {{suddenly}} in battle against Hussite forces {{soon after the}} agreement between Emperor Sigismund, Albert II of Germany and the Piast dynasty had been made. Just a few weeks later, a peace agreement with the Hussites was signed. It was <b>now</b> <b>up</b> to Katarina to marry Duke Przemyslaw II in accordance with her father's wish. However, this was not to happen as Katarina later married Lord Pál Bánffy of Alsolindva. Soon after, Stibor the Bishop of Eger lost his office and the Wawrzyniec lost all their offices and properties including the Castle of Košecy (which had previously been granted by Stibor of Stiboricz). All this {{was a result of}} their support for the Hussites. According to the testament, all lands possessed by the Ostoja clan in Upper Hungary was to be passed to the closest family of Stibor.|$|E
25|$|The distributing company Viz Media has {{licensed}} {{the series}} for English in the United States.

25|$|<b>Now</b> <b>up</b> 14-0 with 9:25 left in {{the second}} quarter, Washington squandered {{multiple}} chances to build a 3-score lead. A blitz from Washington cornerback A. J. Johnson caused Miller to throw a wobbly pass that was intercepted by Martin Mayhew on the Falcons 29-yard line. But after driving to the 10, Rypien returned the favor with an interception to Atlanta safety Brian Jordan. The Redskins quickly got another chance to score due to an interception by linebacker Kurt Gouveia, but this drive also ended with no points, due to a missed 37-yard field goal attempt from Chip Lohmiller. Atlanta then drove 80 yards to score on Tracy Johnson's 1-yard touchdown run with 57 seconds {{left in the}} half, while Lohmiller missed a 44-yard field goal attempt as time in the second quarter ran out, his third miss of the day. So despite three first half turnovers, Atlanta went into their locker room trailing only 14-7.|$|E

25|$|Less Than {{a minute}} {{into the game}} Brady Quinn proved just why he's {{one of the top}} QBs in College Football today and he didn't stop there going 14 of 19 for 207 yards passing and 4 TDs. At :54 seconds Quinn hit Jeff Samardzija for a 51-yd TD pass and a 7-0 lead. Less than five minutes later he threw a 1-yd pass to John Carlson to put Notre Dame up 14-0. At 8:40 into the game Air Force got on the board when Zach Sasser kicked a 32-yd field goal to shrink the deficit to 14-3. But Quinn would respond with a 24-yd pass to Rhema McKnight. Air Force was able to block the Extra Point Attempt and Notre Dame was <b>now</b> <b>up</b> 20-3 to finish up the 1st quarter. The second quarter showed off a lot of good defense {{including}} a blocked FG attempt that saw Terrail Lambert return the blocked kick 76-yds for a TD to put Notre Dame up 27-3 at the half.|$|E
25|$|Giovnazzi spun at the Melco hairpin but recovered. The safety car's {{deployment}} was necessitated {{to allow}} the track to be cleaned. At {{the end of the}} first lap, Lynn led from Derani, Félix da Costa, Marciello, Sims, Coletti, Buller, King, Sainz and Latifi. At the restart, Lynn held on to the lead and Derani was passed by Félix da Costa on the outside line at Lisboa corner. Sims lined up an manoevure on Marciello but realised the move could not be completed and eased off. King fell to ninth when Sainz overtook him. Lynn increased his lead to two laps in the following laps, Marciello attempted to force his way through Derani but the Italian resisted his attempts at being overtaken. Sainz moved in front of both Coletti and Buller but the two drivers retook their lost positions. Marciello made it past Derani's who made his car wide at Lisboa corner to take over third place. On lap seven, Coletti and Buller collided which caused the latter's retirement but the latter was able to restart racing although he lost positions as a consequence of being forced to spin onto the escape road. King benefited from the incident and was <b>now</b> <b>up</b> to seventh and both he and Carlin teammate Jaafar passed Sainz after a battle for sixth position ended. Sun spun off at Fisherman's Bend and prompted the brief waving of localised yellow flags.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, {{almost a}} decade after their {{victories}} at Talikota, the Deccan sultanates of Bijapur and Ahmadnagar agreed in 1573 not to interfere in each other's future conquests by reserving regions to the south for Bijapur. In 1577, Bijapur forces attacked again and overwhelmed all opposition along the western coast. Easily taking Adoni, a former Vijayanagara stronghold, they attempted next to take Penukonda, the new Vijayanagara capital. (See [...] ).) There, however, they were repulsed by an army led by the Vijayanagara ruler's father-in-law, Jagadeva Raya, who had traveled north for the engagement from his base in Baramahal. For his services, Jagadeva Raya's territories within the crumbling empire were vastly expanded, extending westward <b>now</b> <b>up</b> to the Western Ghats, the mountain range running along the southwestern coast of India, and with a new capital in Channapatna (See [...]) ...|$|E

500|$|While {{the issue}} was still pending in court, the SP decided to {{change the course of}} the route, {{claiming}} that was its prerogative, despite the Department of the Interior having already granted homestead rights. Those who had been building homes along the previous course were distraught. Settlers argued in court that by not building the line where the federal government had deeded the land, SP forfeited the title. On the other hand, the SP was convinced of its legal ownership of the land and felt it should have the freedom to set whatever prices it deemed fit for its property. Others took the opportunity to move onto the SP's parcels, anticipating that the courts would rule against the company, thus allowing them to get the land for free. The Supreme Court finally ruled in Schulenberg v. Harriman 21 Wall. 44 (1874) that SP still owned the lands and as such, the SP was justified to reclaim the land without compensation unless the settlers were willing to pay their asking price, <b>now</b> <b>up</b> to $35/acre. [...] Still, the Settler's League, which was formed in 1878 in opposition to the SP's Mussel Slough actions, even attempted to appeal directly to President Rutherford B.

500|$|Engineering wise, Holden {{kept the}} changes low key. A revised {{steering}} system and tweaked suspension tuning were {{among some of}} the changes to sharpen handling precision. Further improvements were made to the Generation III V8 engine to produce peak power of [...] for sports variants. In a bid to recapture the market for low-cost, high-performance cars, Holden created a new SV8 specification level. Based on the entry-level Executive, the SV8 inherited the V8 mechanical package from the SS but made do without the luxury appointments and was sold at a correspondingly lower price. Holden also experimented by releasing a limited edition wagon version of its high-performance SS variant, of which only 850 were built. The Series II update added a front strut bar as standard to the SS, which was claimed to increase rigidity and hence handling. As became the trend, the update raised V8 power, <b>now</b> <b>up</b> [...] Amendments in the remaining models were confined to new wheels, trims and decals, however, the Calais has taken on a sports-luxury persona as opposed to the discrete luxury character seen in previous models. This repositioning in turn affected the Berlina's standing. The once second-tier model now became the sole luxury model, only overshadowed by the more expensive Calais. Coinciding with the VY II models was the first four-door utility model dubbed the Holden Crewman. Crewman's underpinnings and body structure while somewhat unusual, shared a fair amount in common with the Statesman/Caprice, One tonner and the two-door Ute.|$|E
