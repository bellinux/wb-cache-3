30|$|Acetaminophen is {{primarily}} metabolized into sulfate and glucuronide metabolites. A minor pathway through CYP 450 had been also reported {{to yield a}} highly reactive metabolite, <b>N-acetyl-p-benzoquinonimine</b> (NAPQI). This metabolite is generally stabilized through conjugation with glutathione by glutathione s-transferase (GST) (Henderson et al. 2000) and eliminated via the kidney. Following overdose, and possibly also in extensive and ultrarapid metabolizers, this detoxification pathway becomes saturated, and, as a consequence, NAPQI accumulates (Dong et al. 2000; Hendrickson and Kenneth 2006; Borne 1995). Too much acetaminophen can overwhelm the way the liver normally functions leading to organ failure (Khashab et al. 2007; Hawkins et al. 2007; Larson et al. 2005). Our recent studies together with others indicated that reactive oxygen and nitrogen intermediates, produced by hepatic paranchymal and non-paranchymal cells {{are believed to be}} important factors contributing to APAP-induced injury (Dadkhah et al. 20062007; Michael et al. 1999; Laskin et al. 1995; Sener et al. 2003). There is increasing interest in the antioxidants of natural origin because they could suppress the oxidative damage of a tissue by stimulating the natural defence system. Consequently, application of natural antioxidants without any side effects for modulation of liver oxidative damages can not be ruled out.|$|E
40|$|Acetaminophen is {{the leading}} cause of acute hepatic failure in many {{developed}} nations. Acetaminophen hepatotoxicity is mediated by the reactive metabolite <b>N-acetyl-p-benzoquinonimine</b> (NAPQI). We performed a “discovery” genome-wide association study using a cell line–based model system to study the possible contribution of genomics to NAPQI-induced cytotoxicity. A total of 176 lymphoblastoid cell lines from healthy subjects were treated with increasing concentrations of NAPQI. Inhibiting concentration 50 values were determined and were associated with “glutathione pathway” gene single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and genome-wide basal messenger RNA expression, as well as with 1. 3 million genome-wide SNPs. A group of SNPs in linkage disequilibrium on chromosome 3 was highly associated with NAPQI toxicity. The p value for rs 2880961, the SNP with the lowest p value, was 1. 88 × 10 − 7. This group of SNPs mapped to a “gene desert,” but chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated binding of several transcription factor proteins including heat shock factor 1 (HSF 1) and HSF 2, at or near rs 2880961. These chromosome 3 SNPs were not significantly associated with variation in basal expression for any of the genome-wide genes represented on the Affymetrix U 133 Plus 2. 0 GeneChip. We have used a cell line–based model system to identify a SNP signal associated with NAPQI cytotoxicity. If these observations are validated in future clinical studies, this SNP signal might represent a potential biomarker for risk of acetaminophen hepatotoxicity. The mechanisms responsible for this association remain unclear...|$|E
