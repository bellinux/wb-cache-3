5|$|<b>NATO</b> <b>has</b> added {{new members}} seven times since its {{founding}} in 1949 to include twenty-nine members. Twelve countries were part of the founding of NATO: Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The early years of the Cold War saw a stark divide between Capitalist ideologies, backed by NATO, and Communist satellite states of the Soviet Union. This divide encouraged the anti-Communist governments of Greece and Turkey to join NATO in 1952. Greece would suspend its membership in 1974, over the Turkish invasion of Cyprus, but rejoined in 1980 with Turkey's cooperation.|$|E
5|$|NATO leaders {{endorsed}} {{measures to}} improve NATO’s {{ability to take}} on operations when and where necessary, committing themselves to be able at all times to deploy and sustain larger proportions of their forces on operations {{in order to ensure}} that <b>NATO</b> <b>has</b> a permanently available pool of assets and forces that can deployed. They also endorsed changes to NATO’s defence planning, hoping that the Alliance’s long-term defence planning process would become more flexible, thereby helping member countries generate forces that can reach further, faster and still take on the full range of missions.|$|E
5|$|The 1995 NATO {{bombing of}} Bosnia and Herzegovina {{targeted}} the Bosnian Serb Army and together with international pressure {{led to the}} resolution of the Bosnian War and the signing of the Dayton Agreement in 1995. Since then, <b>NATO</b> <b>has</b> led the Implementation Force and Stabilization Force, and other peacekeeping efforts in the country. Bosnia and Herzegovina joined the Partnership for Peace in 2006, and signed an agreement on security cooperation in March 2007.|$|E

50|$|<b>NATO</b> <b>had</b> barracks for SHAPE {{here from}} 1959-1967, and the American School of Paris was located nearby from 1959 to 1967.|$|R
50|$|In 1999 the Defence Training Estate {{was formed}} and units {{from all over}} the UK and <b>NATO</b> <b>have</b> trained on the ranges.|$|R
5|$|Ukraine's {{present and}} future {{relationship}} with <b>NATO</b> <b>has</b> been politically divisive, and {{is part of a}} larger debate between Ukraine's political and cultural ties to both the European Union and Russia. It established ties to the alliance with a NATO–Ukraine Action Plan on 22 November 2002, and became the first Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) country to join NATO's Partnership for Peace initiative in February 2005. Then in April 2005, Ukraine entered into the Intensified Dialogue programme with NATO.|$|E
5|$|From the 1950s to 2003, the Strategic Commanders {{were the}} Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR) and the Supreme Allied Commander Atlantic (SACLANT). The current {{arrangement}} is to separate responsibility between Allied Command Transformation (ACT), responsible for transformation {{and training of}} NATO forces, and Allied Command Operations (ACO), responsible for NATO operations worldwide. Starting in late 2003 <b>NATO</b> <b>has</b> restructured how it commands and deploys its troops by creating several NATO Rapid Deployable Corps, including Eurocorps, I. German/Dutch Corps, Multinational Corps Northeast, and NATO Rapid Deployable Italian Corps among others, as well as naval High Readiness Forces (HRFs), which all report to Allied Command Operations.|$|E
5|$|The {{creation}} of NATO brought about some standardization of allied military terminology, procedures, and technology, which {{in many cases}} meant European countries adopting US practices. The roughly 1300Standardization Agreements (STANAG) codified many of the common practices that <b>NATO</b> <b>has</b> achieved. Hence, the 7.62×51mm NATO rifle cartridge {{was introduced in the}} 1950s as a standard firearm cartridge among many NATO countries. Fabrique Nationale de Herstal's FAL, which used the 7.62mm NATO cartridge, was adopted by 75 countries, including many outside of NATO. Also, aircraft marshalling signals were standardized, so that any NATO aircraft could land at any NATO base. Other standards such as the NATO phonetic alphabet have made their way beyond NATO into civilian use.|$|E

50|$|The European Union, the United States, and <b>NATO</b> <b>have</b> issued {{statements}} {{saying these}} organisations consider the elections illegal, and have rejected their results.|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to BIKINI alerts that applied to individual installation <b>NATO</b> <b>had</b> a [...] "Counter-Surprise" [...] Military Alert System to mobilise its military forces.|$|R
5|$|A poll {{following}} the 2008 summit showed that 82.5 percent of citizens surveyed opposed changing the constitutional name {{in order to}} join NATO. Elections were called {{following the}} 2008 summit, resulting in further support for the centre-right pro-NATO party, VMRO-DPMNE. The elections were marred by violence that was criticized by NATO members. Ethnic tensions have persisted in Macedonia, and <b>NATO</b> <b>has</b> called for dialogue following clashes {{such as those in}} the city of Kumanovo in 2015, which were blamed in part on the delay in NATO and European integration. NATO membership in general is supported by 81 percent according to a November 2014 poll. On 12 June 2017, Prime Minister Zoran Zaev signaled that he will consider alternatives names for the country in order to strike a compromise with Greece, settle the naming dispute, and lift Greek objections to Macedonia joining the alliance. Zaev also floated the idea of Macedonia joining the alliance under the provisional name it uses at the United Nations.|$|E
25|$|EU did not {{participate}} in the Yugoslav Wars, and was divided on supporting the United States in the 2003–2011 Iraq War. <b>NATO</b> <b>has</b> been part of the war in Afghanistan, but at a much lower level of involvement than the United States.|$|E
25|$|The Italian Navy in 2008 had 35,200 active {{personnel}} with 85 commissioned {{ships and}} 123 aircraft. It is a blue-water navy. In modern times the Italian Navy, {{being a member}} of the EU and <b>NATO,</b> <b>has</b> taken part in many coalition peacekeeping operations around the world.|$|E

5000|$|As in the {{previous}} two games, an AI [...] "player" [...] was available for one side only: the Soviets. <b>NATO</b> <b>had</b> to have a human player.|$|R
25|$|Turkey {{has chosen}} a Chinese defence firm to co-produce a US$4 billion {{long-range}} air and missile defence system FD-2000, rejecting rival bids from Russian, US and European firms. The Turkish defence minister announced {{the decision to}} award the contract to China Precision Machinery Import and Export Corp (CPMIEC) in a statement on Thursday, September 26, 2013. <b>NATO</b> <b>has</b> said that missiles should be compatible.|$|E
25|$|NATO is reallocating {{resources}} to the Mediterranean {{to deal with the}} immigrant crisis and human smuggling but believes that the efforts put into the gulf of Aden will help stem the tide of returning piracy or prevent it altogether. As with the change in the political environment and world new problems have arisen where <b>NATO</b> <b>has</b> had to allocate resources. Therefore, it justifies the funding of the Mediterranean operation.|$|E
25|$|<b>NATO</b> <b>has</b> added {{new members}} seven times since its {{founding}} in 1949, and since 2017 <b>NATO</b> <b>has</b> had 29 members. Twelve countries were part of the founding of NATO: Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, the United Kingdom, and the United States. In 1952, Greece and Turkey became members of the Alliance, joined later by West Germany (in 1955) and Spain (in 1982). In 1990, with the reunification of Germany, NATO grew to include the former country of East Germany. Between 1994 and 1997, wider forums for regional cooperation between NATO and its neighbors were set up, including the Partnership for Peace, the Mediterranean Dialogue initiative and the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council. In 1997, three former Warsaw Pact countries, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Poland, were invited to join NATO. After this fourth enlargement in 1999, the Vilnius group of The Baltics and seven East European countries formed in May 2000 to cooperate and lobby for further NATO membership. Seven of these countries joined in the fifth enlargement in 2004. The Adriatic States Albania and Croatia joined in the sixth enlargement in 2009, Montenegro in 2017.|$|E

25|$|Of the 29 member {{countries}}, two {{are located}} in North America (Canada and the United States) and 27 are European countries while Turkey is in Eurasia. All members have militaries, except for Iceland which {{does not have a}} typical army (but does, however, have a coast guard and a small unit of civilian specialists for NATO operations). Three of NATO's members are nuclear weapons states: France, the United Kingdom, and the United States. <b>NATO</b> <b>has</b> 12 original founding member nation states, and from 18 February 1952 to 6 May 1955, it added three more member nations, and a fourth on 30 May 1982. After the end of the Cold War, NATO added 13 more member nations (10 former Warsaw Pact members and three former Yugoslav republics) from 12 March 1999 to 5 June 2017.|$|E
500|$|Upgrading NATO's E-3 fleet is {{complicated}} by the heterogeneity of the fleet's equipment. [...] Each NATO member's E-3 aircraft are configured differently, and <b>NATO</b> <b>has</b> not finalized upgrade or replacement plans. [...] The airplanes themselves can be flown to 2050 with appropriate maintenance, but as the worldwide fleet of 707 aircraft dwindles, supporting the E-3 becomes more difficult.|$|E
500|$|Since the 1991 Rome summit, {{when the}} {{delegations}} of its member states officially offered cooperation with Europe's newly democratic states, <b>NATO</b> <b>has</b> addressed and further defined the expectations and procedure for adding new members. The 1994 Brussels Declaration reaffirmed the principles in Article 10 {{and led to}} the [...] "Study on NATO Enlargement." [...] Published in September 1995, the study outlined the [...] "how and why" [...] of possible enlargement in Europe, highlighting three principles from the 1949 treaty for members to have: [...] "democracy, individual liberty, and rule of law." ...|$|E
50|$|In 1978, after prodigious {{diplomatic}} efforts, <b>NATO</b> <b>had</b> {{convinced the}} Warsaw Pact states {{to sign an}} international convention on hijacking, in which each signatory state promised to punish hijackers who landed in their territory.|$|R
50|$|According to the press, Eastern European Member States of <b>NATO</b> <b>have</b> {{resisted}} {{the withdrawal of}} the shared nuclear bombs from Europe, fearing it would show a weakening of the US commitment to defend Europe against Russia.|$|R
50|$|Government {{authorities}} and <b>NATO</b> <b>have</b> built bombing-practice ranges in Sami areas in northern Norway and Sweden. These regions {{have served as}} reindeer calving and summer grounds for thousands of years, and contain many ancient Sami sacred sites.|$|R
500|$|<b>NATO</b> <b>has</b> twenty-nine members, {{mainly in}} Europe and North America. Some of these {{countries}} also have territory on multiple continents, which can be covered only {{as far south as}} the Tropic of Cancer in [...] the Atlantic Ocean, which defines NATO's [...] "area of responsibility" [...] under Article 6 of the North Atlantic Treaty. During the original treaty negotiations, the United States insisted that colonies such as the Belgian Congo be excluded from the treaty. French Algeria was however covered until their independence on 3 July 1962. Twelve of these twenty-nine are original members who joined in 1949, while the other seventeen joined in one of eight enlargement rounds. Few members spend more than two percent of their gross domestic product on defence, with the United States accounting for three quarters of NATO defense spending.|$|E
2500|$|... the Hellenic Republic, by {{objecting to}} the {{admission}} of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to <b>NATO,</b> <b>has</b> breached its obligation under Article 11, paragraph 1, of the Interim Accord of 13 September 1995; ...|$|E
2500|$|NATO General Petr Pavel said <b>NATO</b> <b>has</b> [...] "no legal platform" [...] to {{intervene}} militarily in the South China Sea territorial disputes, and NATO will not interfere in other region's issues. NATO supports any regional solutions based on political and diplomatic negotiations, “rules-based international system” and peaceful means for resolving discord.|$|E
50|$|In December 2013, Dnevne Novine {{reported}} that <b>NATO</b> <b>had</b> decided that Montenegro would join NATO {{at the same}} time as Macedonia, whose membership has been vetoed by Greece over the Macedonia naming dispute, making accession unlikely in 2014.|$|R
25|$|The NATO bombing {{marked the}} second major combat {{operation}} in its history, following the 1995 NATO bombing campaign in Bosnia and Herzegovina. It {{was the first time}} that <b>NATO</b> <b>had</b> used military force without the approval of the UN Security Council.|$|R
25|$|On April 14, NATO planes bombed ethnic Albanians near Koriša who {{had been}} used by Yugoslav forces as human shields. Yugoslav troops took TV crews to the scene shortly after the bombing. The Yugoslav {{government}} insisted that <b>NATO</b> <b>had</b> targeted civilians.|$|R
