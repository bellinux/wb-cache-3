5|$|The {{velvet belly}} is grouped with the Caribbean lanternshark (E. hillianus), fringefin lanternshark (E. schultzi), brown lanternshark (E. unicolor), broadbanded lanternshark (E. gracilispinis), combtooth lanternshark (E. decacuspidatus), and dwarf lanternshark (E. perryi) in having irregularly arranged, <b>needle-shaped</b> dermal denticles. Its common {{name comes from}} this shark's black ventral surface, which is sharply {{delineated}} {{from the rest of}} its body like a patch of velvet.|$|E
25|$|It is {{sometimes}} mistaken for Toxicodendron radicans (poison ivy), despite having five leaflets (poison ivy has three). While {{the leaves of}} P. quinquefolia do not produce urushiol, the sap within the leaves and stem contains raphides (<b>needle-shaped</b> crystals of calcium oxalate) which can puncture the skin causing irritation and blisters in sensitive people.|$|E
500|$|The granite {{mountains}} around Chamonix {{have been}} eroded into steep <b>needle-shaped</b> peaks (known as [...] ). Known locally as protogine, these rocks are {{lower in the}} mineral biotite mica and richer in quartz than the granites commonly found elsewhere.|$|E
500|$|The spores are {{narrowly}} , nonamyloid, {{and measure}} 6–7 by 3–3.5µm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are four-spored and measure 20–22 by 6–7µm. The [...] and [...] (cystidia {{found on the}} edges and faces, respectively, of the gills) are abundant and similar in shape and markings, 40–58 by 10–15µm, tapering somewhat on either end and usually with a long <b>needle-shaped</b> neck (which is branched in some). The cystidia are generally smooth, but when dried material is mounted in potassium hydroxide for observation under light microscopy, an amorphous substance apparently holds spores and debris around the neck or apex, making them appear encrusted. The flesh of the gill is very faintly vinaceous-brown when stained in iodine. The cap flesh has a thin, poorly differentiated pellicle with a region of slightly enlarged cells beneath it; the remainder is filamentous, and the filamentous portion stains vinaceous-brown in iodine.|$|E

2500|$|American ichthyologists Stewart Springer and George H. Burgess {{described}} the dwarf lanternshark from specimens collected via trawling by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service research ship Oregon in 1964. They dubbed the new species {{in honor of}} noted shark biologist Perry W. Gilbert, and published their findings in a 1985 Copeia paper. The type specimen is a [...] long female caught in the Caribbean Sea {{off the coast of}} Colombia. This species is grouped with the velvet belly lantern shark (E. spinax), Caribbean lanternshark (E. hillianus), fringefin lanternshark (E. schultzi), brown lanternshark (E. unicolor), broadbanded lanternshark (E. gracilispinis), and combtooth lanternshark (E. decacuspidatus) in having irregularly arranged, <b>needle-shaped</b> dermal denticles.|$|E
2500|$|Galen was {{a skilled}} surgeon, {{operating}} on human patients. Many of his procedures and techniques {{would not be}} used again for centuries, such as the procedures he performed on brains and eyes. To correct cataracts in patients, Galen performed an operation similar to a modern one. Using a <b>needle-shaped</b> instrument, Galen attempted to remove the cataract-affected lens of the eye. His surgical experiments included ligating the arteries of living animals. [...] Although many 20th century historians have claimed that Galen believed the lens {{to be in the}} exact center of the eye, Galen actually understood that the crystalline lens is located in the anterior aspect of the human eye.|$|E
2500|$|The brown lanternshark {{was first}} {{described}} by Robert Engelhardt as Spinax unicolor in 1912, {{in the scientific}} journal Zoologischer Anzeiger. The type specimen was a 55-cm-long female from Sagami Bay, Japan. In 1965, Tokiharu Abe redescribed this species and moved it to the genus Etmopterus. The Australian Etmopterus [...] "sp. B" [...] (known as the [...] "bristled lanternshark") is now tentatively {{believed to be the}} same as this species. It is grouped with the velvet belly lantern shark (E. spinax), Caribbean lanternshark (E. hillianus), fringefin lanternshark (E. schultzi), broadbanded lanternshark (E. gracilispinis), combtooth lanternshark (E. decacuspidatus), and dwarf lanternshark (E. perryi) in having irregularly arranged, <b>needle-shaped</b> dermal denticles. Etmopterus compagnoi is a questionably valid species as it may be based on the brown lanternshark or Etmopterus baxteri.|$|E
60|$|So rang {{forth the}} supplication, echoing from rock and fell, {{as the people}} of Claudiodunum {{streamed}} forth in the May sunshine to invoke a blessing on the cornlands, olives, and vineyards that won vantage- ground on the terraces carefully kept up {{on the slopes of}} the wonderful <b>needle-shaped</b> hills of Auvergne.|$|E
6000|$|... "Doubtless----" [...] and I began some {{explanation}} which I have forgotten, when {{a passing}} cloud, or I know not what, {{cut off the}} light so that both the pinnacle and she who stood on it became invisible. A minute later it returned for a little while, {{and there was the}} point of the <b>needle-shaped</b> rock, but it was empty, as, save for the birds that rested on it, it had been {{since the beginning of the}} world.|$|E
60|$|As {{confirmation}} of the fact, that vegetation is but a kind of crystallization, every one may observe how, upon {{the edge of the}} melting frost on the window, the <b>needle-shaped</b> particles are bundled together so as to resemble fields waving with grain, or shocks rising here and there from the stubble; on one side the vegetation of the torrid zone, high-towering palms and widespread banyans, such as are seen in pictures of oriental scenery; on the other, arctic pines stiff frozen, with downcast branches.|$|E
60|$|Three {{days after}} passing the volcano, we found {{ourselves}} a few miles to windward of an island of considerable size and luxuriant aspect. It consisted of two mountains, {{which seemed to be}} nearly four thousand feet high. They were separated from each other by a broad valley, whose thick-growing trees ascended a considerable distance up the mountain-sides; and rich, level plains or meadow-land spread round the base of the mountains, except at the point immediately opposite the large valley, where a river seemed to carry the trees, as it were, along with it down to the white, sandy shore. The mountain-tops, unlike those of our Coral Island, were sharp, <b>needle-shaped,</b> and bare, while their sides were more rugged and grand in outline than anything I had yet seen in those seas. Bloody Bill was beside me when the island first hove in sight.|$|E
60|$|The symbol vanished, {{the fire}} sank. Again it blazed up more {{fiercely}} than {{before and the}} loop appeared afresh, then once more disappeared. A third time the fire shone, and with such intensity, that no lightning could surpass its brilliance. All around the heavens were lit up, and, through the black <b>needle-shaped</b> eye of the symbol, as from the flare of a beacon, or the search-light of a ship, one fierce ray shot across the sea of mountain tops and the spaces of the desert, straight as an arrow to the lofty peak on which we lay. Yes, it lit upon the snow, staining it red, and upon the wild, white faces of us who watched, though {{to the right and}} left of us spread thick darkness. My compass lay before me on the snow, and I could even see its needle; and beyond us the shape of a white fox that had crept near, scenting food. Then it was gone as swiftly as it came. Gone too were the symbol and the veil of flame behind it, only the glow lingered a little on the distant sky.|$|E
60|$|On this occasion, in {{the side}} of the high bank of the river, {{wherever}} the water or other cause had formed a cavity, its throat and outer edge, like the entrance to a citadel, bristled with a glistening ice-armor. In one place you might see minute ostrich-feathers, which seemed the waving plumes of the warriors filing into the fortress; in another, the glancing, fan-shaped banners of the Lilliputian host; and in another, the <b>needle-shaped</b> particles collected into bundles, resembling the plumes of the pine, might pass for a phalanx of spears. From the under side of the ice in the brooks, where there was a thicker ice below, depended a mass of crystallization, four or five inches deep, in the form of prisms, with their lower ends open, which, when the ice was laid on its smooth side, resembled the roofs and steeples of a Gothic city, or the vessels of a crowded haven under a press of canvas. The very mud in the road, where the ice had melted, was crystallized with deep rectilinear fissures, and the crystalline masses {{in the side}}s of the ruts resembled exactly asbestos in the disposition of their needles. Around the roots of the stubble and flower-stalks, the frost was gathered into the form of irregular conical shells, or fairy rings. In some places the ice-crystals were lying upon granite rocks, directly over crystals of quartz, the frost-work of a longer night, crystals of a longer period, but to some eye unprejudiced by the short term of human life, melting as fast as the former.|$|E

50|$|Hakea lissosperma {{is a type}} of {{spreading}} shrub with almost 4 metres height, <b>needle-shaped</b> leaves and white flowers. In 1999 it was recognised that it grows commonly in over 1200 m rocky mountains, in subalpine woodland. And common names include needle bush and mountain needlewood. What is more, this species is a favourite of birds due to the dense clusters of flowers and pungent rigid <b>needle-shaped</b> leaves which can be a shelter against predators. It is also resistant to wildlife browsing due to its unpalatability but not suitable below powerlines.|$|E
