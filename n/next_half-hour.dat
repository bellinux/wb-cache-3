5|$|After the eulogies, {{the three}} {{speakers}} each laid a wreath at the casket, and the Senate Chaplain, the Reverend Barry Black, gave the benediction. Cheney escorted Nancy Reagan to the casket, where {{she said her}} goodbyes. The dignitaries in the room paid their respects during the <b>next</b> <b>half-hour.</b> In a rare instance, {{the doors of the}} Capitol were then opened to the public, who stood in lines stretching many blocks to view the casket.|$|E
5|$|At 11:30 Sefik told Kemal {{that the}} ANZACs had a beachhead of around , {{and that he}} would attack towards Ari Burnu, in {{conjunction}} with the 19th Division. Around midday Kemal was appraised that the 9th Division was fully involved with the British landings at Cape Helles, and could not support his attack, so at 12:30 he ordered two battalions of the 77th Infantry Regiment (the third battalion was guarding Suvla Bay) to move forward between the 57th and 27th Infantry Regiments. At the same time he ordered his reserve 72nd Infantry Regiment to move further west. Within the <b>next</b> <b>half-hour</b> the 27th and 57th Infantry Regiments started the counter-attack, supported by three batteries of artillery. At 13:00 Kemal met with his corps commander Esat Pasha and convinced him of the need to react in strength to the ANZAC landings. Esat agreed and released the 72nd and 27th Infantry Regiments to Kemal's command. Kemal deployed the four regiments from north to south; 72nd, 57th, 27th and 77th. In total, Turkish strength opposing the landing numbered between ten thousand and twelve thousand men.|$|E
5|$|Before take-off, D'Mario placed three cloth-covered foam {{cushions}} {{on top of}} {{a heating}} vent under the instructor navigator's seat in the aft section of the lower deck. Shortly after take-off, another cushion was placed under the seat. The flight was uneventful until the scheduled mid-air refueling from a KC-135 Stratotanker, which had to be conducted manually because of an error with the B-52G's autopilot. About one hour after refueling, while the aircraft was circling above its designated area, Captain Haug directed co-pilot Svitenko to take his rest period. His seat was taken by the spare pilot, D'Mario. The crew was uncomfortable because of the cold, although the heater's rheostat was turned up, so D'Mario opened an engine bleed valve to draw additional hot air into the heater from the engine manifold. Because of a heater malfunction, the air barely cooled as it traveled from the engine manifold to the cabin's heating ducts. During the <b>next</b> <b>half-hour,</b> the cabin's temperature became uncomfortably hot, and the stowed cushions ignited. After one crew member reported smelling burning rubber, they looked for a fire. The navigator searched the lower compartment twice before discovering the fire behind a metal box. He attempted to fight it with two fire extinguishers, but could not put it out.|$|E

50|$|Initial episodes narrowed 50 semi-finalists down to 18 finalists. After the {{audition}} stage, {{the program was}} a one-hour show, in which movies were screened: Film Premiere. The <b>next</b> day featured <b>half-hour</b> episodes of viewer reaction, entitled Box Office. Viewers could vote each week for their favorite directors, {{which resulted in the}} elimination of the directors with the lowest vote totals. Votes could be made online at thelot.com, in addition to landline calls and Verizon text messages, and were permitted for two hours after the show.|$|R
60|$|No {{words of}} ours can {{describe}} the grateful sense of coolness, {{in spite of}} the boiling blood in his veins, that Mark Woolston experienced when he stepped beneath the shade of the poop-deck of the Rancocus. The young man knew {{that he was about to}} be seriously ill and his life might depend on the use he made of the <b>next</b> hour, or <b>half-hour,</b> even. He threw himself on a settee, to get a little rest, and while there he endeavoured to reflect on his situation, and to remember what he ought to do. The medicine-chest always stood in the cabin, and he had used its contents too often among the crew, not to have some knowledge of their general nature and uses. Potions were kept prepared in that depository, and he staggered to the table, opened the chest, took a ready-mixed dose of the sort he believed best for him, poured water on it from the filterer, and swallowed it. Our mate ever afterwards believed that draught saved his life. It soon made him deadly sick, and produced an action in his whole system. For an hour he was under its influence, when he was enabled to get into his berth, exhausted and literally unable any longer to stand. How long he remained in that berth, or near it rather--for he was conscious of having crawled from it in quest of water, and for other purposes, on several occasions--but, how long he was confined to his cabin, Mark Woolston never knew. The period was certainly to be measured by days, and he sometimes fancied by weeks. The first probably was the truth, though it might have been a fortnight. Most of that time his head was light with fever, though there were intervals when reason was, at least partially, restored to him, and he became painfully conscious of the horrors of his situation. Of food and water he had a sufficiency, the filterer and a bread-bag being quite near him, and he helped himself often from the first, in particular; a single mouthful of the ship's biscuit commonly proving more than he could swallow, even after it was softened in the water. At length he found himself indisposed to rise at all, and he certainly remained eight-and-forty hours in his berth, without quitting it, and almost without sleeping, though most of the time in a sort of doze.|$|R
25|$|At {{approximately}} 4 p.m. on Sunday, Zavistonovičius armed {{himself with}} a Russian hunting rifle IZH-12 and a Czech carbine ZKK-601 with telescopic sight – both weapons were held legally with permit renewed {{less than a year}} prior to the incident. Within the <b>next</b> <b>half-hour,</b> he went to four houses where he killed nine of his neighbours and their relatives, all of them with single shots to the head or chest.|$|E
25|$|The initial tephra {{production}} {{rate in the}} first 30minutes of the eruption was 75,000m3·s−1, dropping to 22,000m3·s−1 for the <b>next</b> <b>half-hour.</b> The initial phase produced 0.18km3 of tephra, equating to 4.5×107m3 of solid rock, covering 3,130km2 of land and sea. 98 farms were damaged by the eruption, but only 2 were no longer farmed in 1970. A large volunteer effort was mobilized to clear the tephra – around 1000man-days {{by the end of}} July. The eruption produced around 3ML of water (snowmelt and directly from the fissure) which caused flooding of the Ytri Rangá river.|$|E
25|$|At the {{beginning}} of August, the insurgents took the customs house at Kasteli Panormos. On the morning of 7 August, the Russian gunboat Khrabry, with 200 Imperial Guards aboard, {{as well as several}} Cretan gendarmes, laid anchor off Kastelli. Two Russian officers and an Italian lieutenant of the gendarmerie went to meet the rebels in order to engage in negotiations. The Italian gendarme ordered the insurgents to wave the white flag of surrender in the <b>next</b> <b>half-hour</b> or else face shelling. An hour and a half later, the Khrabry opened fire. This incident caused greater unrest.|$|E
500|$|Victorious {{was also}} hit, Captain Clark forced to retire wounded after being {{struck in the}} thigh by debris at 08:00. At 08:30 the {{rearmost}} French ship, Prudente, passed {{out of range of}} Arrogant leaving the ship isolated. With Lucas unable to participate, Lieutenant William Waller on Victorious assumed command and ordered his ship to engage the French at 08:40, a string of signal flags hoisted on Arrogant unreadable in the light winds. Victorious was soon surrounded by the French, with two frigates on the port bow and four on the port beam, all firing into the ship of the line from approximately [...] By 10:15, when the wind suddenly returned, Victorious had been badly damaged. Using the wind to turn towards the distant Arrogant, Waller exposed his ship's stern and was repeatedly raked. The winds remained unreliable, and Victorious took further damage for the <b>next</b> <b>half-hour,</b> the French ships remaining outside the arcs of fire from the British ship.|$|E
2500|$|The American author Nathaniel Hawthorne {{writes of}} Cathay as a remote, exotic and {{difficult}} to reach location in [...] "Footprints on the Seashore", a short story from his 1837 collection Twice-Told Tales. On listening to the sea's unchanging voice the solitary author writes: [...] "This is wisdom, and therefore will I spend the <b>next</b> <b>half-hour</b> in shaping little boats of driftwood and launching them on voyages across the cove, with the feather of a seagull for a shade. If the voice of ages tell me true, this is as wise an occupation as to build ships of five hundred tons and launch them forth upon the main, bound to 'Far Cathay'. Yet how would the merchant sneer at me!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Those runs {{were taken}} by Shaun Pollock and Mark Boucher, who put on 77 {{together}} in a stand described as [...] "sizzling" [...] by Vaidyanathan – the two hit six fours in four overs after tea, before Lee returned to have Pollock bowled off the inside edge. Boucher put on 18 in the <b>next</b> <b>half-hour</b> with André Nel, and Makhaya Ntini hit 12 from ten balls as South Africa closed on 296, with a lead of 38. Those runs were exactly matched by Australia, but once again Hayden was dismissed for a sub-25 score, as he top edged to wicket-keeper Boucher for 20. Brett Lee was left as nightwatchman, and Langeveldt bowled a no-ball to level the scores two balls {{before the end of}} the day.|$|E
2500|$|However, some BBC World News {{programmes}} {{are available}} to UK audiences. There is a simulcast of the 05:00 UK edition of BBC World News on BBC One and the BBC News channel, followed by an edition of World Business Report. This programme was previously branded as 'The World Today'. [...] While international audiences see advertisements during the break, UK viewers see domestic headlines. [...] This simulcast is in addition to overnight simulcasts {{at the top of}} the hour from 00.00 to 05.00 UK time on both BBC World News and BBC News Channel and are simply branded as BBC News (except for Newsday which simulcasts at 00.00 UK time weekdays), even if they are produced by BBC World News. The 11:30 UK edition of BBC World News was shown on BBC Two Mon-Fri (but not on Wednesdays when Parliament is sitting and there is Prime Minister's Questions), but was discontinued as of December 2015, having been quietly replaced by the <b>next</b> <b>half-hour</b> of national BBC News (now known as Newsroom Live). This had formed BBC News at 11 on BBC Two, which was made up of half an hour of BBC News and then half an hour of BBC World News. Nowadays, this also happens on rare occasions during big news events and the News Channel presenter will join the BBC World News presenter in Studio C as it used by both channels. This was done for example for coverage of events such as the Glasgow Helicopter Crash, Election of Pope Francis and Boston Marathon Bombings. Previously GMT was shown at 12:30 on the channel.|$|E

60|$|The {{vouchers}} were produced, {{and for the}} <b>next</b> <b>half-hour</b> Mr Fledgeby concentrated his sublime {{attention on}} them. They and the accounts were all found correct, and the books and the papers resumed their places in the bag.|$|E
60|$|It is {{unnecessary}} to dwell more {{particularly on the}} occurrences at the farm-house. The worthy people did what they could to make us comfortable, {{and we were all}} warm in bed, {{in the course of the}} <b>next</b> <b>half-hour.</b>|$|E
60|$|He shuffled {{forward with}} lowered head, while Blake came behind, helping Harding {{as best he}} could. All three long remembered the <b>next</b> <b>half-hour.</b> Once they lost the trail and were seized with despair, but, searching anxiously, they found it again.|$|E

60|$|What {{occurred}} within the inner cell of the Conciergerie prison within the <b>next</b> <b>half-hour</b> of that 16th day of Pluviose {{in the year}} II of the Republic is, perhaps, too well known to history to need or bear overfull repetition.|$|E
60|$|For the <b>next</b> <b>half-hour</b> he exerted himself savagely, {{and when}} at last he dropped the handspike, his face was damp with perspiration. He smiled grimly when Laura, who had hauled {{one or two of}} the logs away, came back tapping the plodding oxen.|$|E
6000|$|Basil grew restless, and Isabel said, with a subtile {{interpretation}} of his uneasiness, [...] "I don't {{want anything to}} eat, Basil, but I think I know the weaknesses of men; and you had better go and pass the <b>next</b> <b>half-hour</b> over a plate of something indigestible." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{clock was}} ticking so mercilessly on. It was long past midnight, {{and even the}} Prince of Wales was {{thinking}} of leaving the supper-table.

60|$|The colour {{had come}} back to her cheeks. Indeed, she felt marvellously cheerful now and reassured. She knew that Andor would fulfil his share of the bargain, and the heavy cloud of trouble and of terror would be {{permanently}} lifted from her within the <b>next</b> <b>half-hour.</b>|$|E
60|$|She found {{a splendid}} trout, {{a packet of}} tea, and a little bag of self-raising flour, among other sundries, and for the <b>next</b> <b>half-hour</b> she kept Nasmyth busy making flapjacks and frying the trout.

60|$|With that hearty commendation, {{her father}} left her, {{to see that}} all was safe, and Abby found that another sort of courage was needed to support her through the <b>next</b> <b>half-hour</b> of trial; for her hands were badly burned, {{and each of the}} {{excellent}} relatives suggested a different remedy.|$|E
60|$|He {{passed the}} <b>next</b> <b>half-hour</b> with Torrance amicably, {{and it was}} not until he was {{returning}} to the hall with Clavering that he found an opportunity of expressing himself freely.

60|$|He {{spent the}} <b>next</b> <b>half-hour</b> in issuing invitations, and at half-past three every chair was filled by fellow-strikers.

Glasses and teacups were filled.|$|E
60|$|With {{that we all}} plied our paddles {{with our}} utmost might. The chase soon became very exciting.
