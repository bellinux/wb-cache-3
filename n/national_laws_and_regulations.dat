It outlines remedial actions against features that facilitate collusion and examines to what extent authorities [...] such as Directorate General (DG) for Competition, National Competition Authorities and regulators [...] have the powers and ability to take these actions. The analysis covers a number of legal tools including the theory of harm of coordinated effects in European merger control, Articles 101 and 102 Treaty for the Functioning of the European Union, stricter <b>national</b> <b>laws</b> <b>and</b> <b>regulation.</b> I conclude that DG Competition has little powers to act, except for merger control.

5000|$|International debt {{collection}} is a specialised field. Not many companies specialize {{in this sort}} of collection as there may be a need to speak different languages and have a knowledge of the different legal systems and laws. International collection calls are often made in a different language than used in the collecting company. Few companies offer a network of local {{debt collection}} specialists. Via this network, creditors are served in their own language via their [...] "own" [...] collection agency, and debts are collected via the local partner abroad. The local partner is aware of the <b>national</b> <b>laws</b> <b>and</b> <b>regulations,</b> and often aware of the debtor profiles in their region. Due to this approach, international debts can be successfully collected via local debt collection specialists.|$|E
30|$|The {{comparisons}} in {{this paper}} show that the United States has a more mature and unified reclamation bonding system than the other three countries. Although controversies and problems still exist where companies do not secure enough bonds, do not update their liabilities during mining process, the system in the United States has been highly successful in helping companies be responsible for reclamation liabilities. More than 80 % of the land disturbed since 1977 has been reclaimed. As a country that implemented mine reclamation bonding system only recently, China can adopt <b>laws</b> <b>and</b> <b>regulations</b> that clearly work well {{from the experience of}} other countries and improve many aspects of the reclamation bonding system including the passage of a <b>national</b> <b>law</b> <b>and</b> <b>regulations,</b> creating a <b>national</b> administrative authority, expanding bond types, unifying bond calculation methods to determine the size of bonds, establishing bond release criteria, and allowing for full public participation in the reclamation system. Recommendations for the above aspects outlined {{in this paper}} are beneficial {{for the establishment of a}} healthy and sustainable bonding system in China and a healthy and competitive mining industry.|$|R

50|$|The {{restriction}} {{of the budget}} made stabilization and consolidation of ILO programmes and activities necessary. That, in turn, had positive spillover effects. Between 1922 and 1931, the Conference continued to meet each year but adopted only 15 Conventions and 21 Recommendations. The limitation of the standard-setting work of the ILO allowed national governments to devote adequate attention to applying {{the provisions of the}} international agreements in <b>national</b> <b>laws</b> <b>and</b> <b>regulations.</b> More and more countries ratified ILO Conventions and ILO standards began to exercise an effective influence in the improvements of conditions of life and work. In 1926, an important innovation was introduced when the International Labour Conference set up a supervisory system on the application of its standards, which still exists today. It created the Committee of Experts composed of independent jurists responsible for examining government reports and presenting its own report each year to the Conference.|$|E
5000|$|Part 1 {{consists}} of ten articles which outline {{the rights of}} both worker and employers to [...] "join organisations of their own choosing without previous authorisation."

There is also an explicit expectation placed on these organizations. They are required, {{in the exercise of}} these rights, to respect the law of the land. In turn, the law of the land, [...] "shall not be such as to impair, nor shall it be so applied as to impair, the guarantees provided for in this Convention." [...] Finally, article 9 states that these provisions are applied to both armed forces and police forces only as determined by <b>national</b> <b>laws</b> <b>and</b> <b>regulations,</b> and do not supersede previous national laws that reflect the same rights for such forces. Article 1 states all ILO members must give effect to the following provisions.|$|E

Those resources especially fish attracts neighboring {{states as well}} as distant-fishing vessels to come and exploit it.

On the other hand, the very same convention stipulated that in managing the resources sustainably, the coastal state and competent International organizations, whether sub regional, regional or global shall cooperate to this end.
