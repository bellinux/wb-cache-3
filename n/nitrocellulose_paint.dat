40|$|In {{order to}} {{overcome}} the difficulties associated to the solubility and mechanical integrity of polyaniline (PAni) films, in this work we develop a binder by mixing PAni in the oxidized and undoped state (emeraldine base form) with 4 -chloro- 3 -methylphenol, a plasticizer, and solvent. This binder {{has been used as}} a coating alone or combined with a conventional <b>nitrocellulose</b> <b>paint</b> to formulate the called Smart Paint. The characterization of binder films, which are cohesive and self-standing, shows the preservation of PAni properties, indicating that they satisfy the typical characteristics of anticorrosive coatings. Electrochemical assays have been carried out in H 2 SO 4 solution using AISI 1006 steel plates coated with the binder and the Smart Paint. Results indicate that the binder and the Smart Paint promote the passivation of the metal substrate, reflecting their protecting abilities against corrosion. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V.

50|$|Figoni used <b>nitrocellulose</b> {{lacquers}} to <b>paint</b> his cars in {{brilliant and}} metallic colours, often {{two or three}} colours in designs which flowed with the body lines., Dashboards made of rich, golden wood were a Figoni et Falaschi signature.|$|R

The doors, roof, forward bulkhead, and front windscreen were kept the same, leaving the bonnet and rear end to be restyled. At the start of M Series production, the fibreglass sections were baked at [...] after being moulded, then given an etch coat, six coats of primer, and three coats of <b>nitrocellulose</b> lacquer <b>paint.</b> Partway through M Series production, the paint shop changed to a two-pack acrylic paint process. Graphic artist John Bailie designed the contrasting side stripe that was first introduced on the turbocharged cars in 1976 (and was available by customer request on all M Series cars in the following years.) ...|$|R
50|$|The film pull {{technique}} {{is a means}} of recovering carbonaceous compression fossils for study under transmitted light microscopy. An acid is applied {{to the surface of the}} rock to etch away the matrix from the surface, leaving carbonaceous tissue protruding. (Surfaces not to be etched can be coated in a wax (e.g. Vaseline) or grease.) This is usually accomplished by placing the rock upside-down in a weak, continually stirred acid, so that any debris can be washed away. <b>Nitrocellulose</b> is then <b>painted</b> on to the fossil-bearing surface, and once dry may be peeled from the rock, or the rock dissolved in hydrofluoric acid.|$|R
40|$|Uralkyd {{oligomers}} {{are considered}} to be promising film-forming. They are widely used in the production of high-quality paints and varnishes for vari ous purposes (primeres, paints, priming-paints). The success of these materials is due to the high properties of coatings formed. These coatings have high adhesion, strength properties and corrosion resistance. The advanages of these materials is feed-stock availability, low cost compared to other polyurethanes, their usability. Uralkyd materials is one-component and low-toxicity system. So they are promising in the protection of various metal from corrosion. Uralkyd oligomers sufficiently versatile in use. They can be applied a lot of methods and combined with many types of <b>paints</b> (<b>nitrocellulose,</b> chlorinated rubber and oily alkyd oligomers). They can be used at the factory painting and refit painting of metal products...|$|R
40|$|In This research, {{the scratch}} {{strength}} (Cross-Cut Test) of clear <b>paints</b> (<b>nitrocellulose</b> lacquers and acid catalyst lacquers) of wood species Beech, Elm, Alder and spruce were studied {{as a function}} of moisture content (MC) of the samples. For this purpose, lumbers (550 × 110 × 12 mm) were cut from sapwood in tangential surfaces and were air dried for one month according to wood drying procedures. Then, for pre-conditioning of moisture content, at the levels of 8 %, 12 % and 15 %, the samples were placed in three clima rooms. Then, finish applied and strength tests were performed. The results revealed that for acid catalyst lacquers the highest scratch strength (10. 4 %) belongs to Elm wood with 8 % moisture content, and the lowest scratch strength (53. 6 %) belongs to Spruce wood with nitrocellulose lacquers having 15 % moisture content...|$|R
