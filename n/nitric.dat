5|$|Aqua regia, {{a mixture}} {{consisting}} of hydrochloric and <b>nitric</b> acids, prepared by dissolving sal ammoniac in <b>nitric</b> acid, {{was described in}} the works of Pseudo-Geber, a 13th-century European alchemist. Other references suggest that the first mention of aqua regia is in Byzantine manuscripts dating {{to the end of the}} 13th century.|$|E
5|$|Arginine is a {{precursor}} of <b>nitric</b> oxide.|$|E
5|$|It {{reacts with}} <b>nitric</b> acid to make bismuth(III) nitrate.|$|E
5|$|Lead(II) nitrate is soluble {{in water}} but is almost {{insoluble}} in <b>nitric</b> acid.|$|E
5|$|Nitrogen {{compounds}} have a {{very long}} history, ammonium chloride having been known to Herodotus. They were well known by the Middle Ages. Alchemists knew <b>nitric</b> acid as aqua fortis (strong water), {{as well as other}} nitrogen compounds such as ammonium salts and nitrate salts. The mixture of <b>nitric</b> and hydrochloric acids was known as aqua regia (royal water), celebrated for its ability to dissolve gold, the king of metals.|$|E
5|$|Due to incompatibilities, it is {{recommended}} to keep acetic acid away from chromic acid, ethylene glycol, <b>nitric</b> acid, perchloric acid, permanganates, peroxides and hydroxyls.|$|E
5|$|In bulk {{form and}} at room {{temperature}} and atmospheric pressure, the element resists alkalis, sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, dilute (but not concentrated) <b>nitric</b> acid, and aqua regia.|$|E
5|$|In <b>nitric</b> acid {{treatment}} of lead-containing wastes, e.g., in {{the processing of}} lead–bismuth wastes from lead refineries, impure solutions of lead(II) nitrate are formed as by-product. These solutions are reported {{to be used in}} the gold cyanidation process.|$|E
5|$|The phrase {{acid rain}} {{was first used}} by Scottish chemist Robert Augus Smith in 1852. The pH of rain varies, {{especially}} due to its origin. On America's East Coast, rain that {{is derived from the}} Atlantic Ocean typically has a pH of 5.0-5.6; rain that comes across the continental from the west has a pH of 3.8-4.8; and local thunderstorms can have a pH as low as 2.0. Rain becomes acidic primarily due to the presence of two strong acids, sulfuric acid (H2SO4) and <b>nitric</b> acid (HNO3). Sulfuric acid is derived from natural sources such as volcanoes, and wetlands (sulfate reducing bacteria); and anthropogenic sources such as the combustion of fossil fuels, and mining where H2S is present. <b>Nitric</b> acid is produced by natural sources such as lightning, soil bacteria, and natural fires; while also produced anthropogenically by the combustion of fossil fuels and from power plants. In the past 20 years the concentrations of <b>nitric</b> and sulfuric acid has decreased in presence of rainwater, which {{may be due to the}} significant increase in ammonium (most likely as ammonia from livestock production), which acts as a buffer in acid rain and raises the pH.|$|E
5|$|Thulium {{reacts with}} {{hydrogen}} chloride to produce hydrogen gas and thulium chloride. With <b>nitric</b> acid it yields thulium nitrate, or Tm(NO3)3.|$|E
5|$|Among the actinides, thorium and uranium are {{the easiest}} to isolate. Thorium is {{extracted}} mostly from monazite: thorium pyrophosphate (ThP2O7) is reacted with <b>nitric</b> acid, and the produced thorium nitrate treated with tributyl phosphate. Rare-earth impurities are separated by increasing the pH in sulfate solution.|$|E
5|$|An {{oxide layer}} forms around {{beryllium}} that prevents further reactions with air unless heated above 1000°C. Once ignited, beryllium burns brilliantly forming {{a mixture of}} beryllium oxide and beryllium nitride. Beryllium dissolves readily in non-oxidizing acids, such as HCl and diluted H2SO4, but not in <b>nitric</b> acid or water as this forms the oxide. This behavior {{is similar to that}} of aluminium metal. Beryllium also dissolves in alkali solutions.|$|E
5|$|At {{standard}} temperature and pressure, thorium is slowly attacked by water, {{but does not}} readily dissolve in most common acids, {{with the exception of}} hydrochloric acid, where it dissolves leaving a black insoluble residue of ThO(OH,Cl)H. It dissolves in concentrated <b>nitric</b> acid containing a small amount of catalytic fluoride or fluorosilicate ions; if these are not present, passivation can occur, as with uranium and plutonium.|$|E
5|$|Blue dinitrogen {{trioxide}} (N2O3) is only {{available as a}} solid because it rapidly dissociates above its melting point to give <b>nitric</b> oxide, nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and dinitrogen tetroxide (N2O4). The latter two compounds are somewhat difficult to study individually because of the equilibrium between them. although sometimes dinitrogen tetroxide can react by heterolytic fission to nitrosonium and nitrate in a medium with high dielectric constant. Nitrogen dioxide is an acrid, corrosive brown gas. Both compounds may be easily prepared by decomposing a dry metal nitrate. Both react with water to form <b>nitric</b> acid. Dinitrogen tetroxide is very useful for the preparation of anhydrous metal nitrates and nitrato complexes, and it became the storable oxidiser of choice for many rockets in both the United States and USSR by the late 1950s. This is {{because it is a}} hypergolic propellant in combination with a hydrazine-based rocket fuel and can be easily stored since it is liquid at room temperature.|$|E
5|$|Chemists {{who studied}} {{platinum}} dissolved it in aqua regia (a mixture of hydrochloric and <b>nitric</b> acids) to create soluble salts. They always observed {{a small amount}} of a dark, insoluble residue. Joseph Louis Proust thought that the residue was graphite. The French chemists Victor Collet-Descotils, Antoine François, comte de Fourcroy, and Louis Nicolas Vauquelin also observed the black residue in 1803, but did not obtain enough for further experiments.|$|E
5|$|Iron {{is by far}} {{the most}} {{reactive}} element in its group; it is pyrophoric when finely divided and dissolves easily in dilute acids, giving Fe2+. However, it does not react with concentrated <b>nitric</b> acid and other oxidizing acids due to the formation of an impervious oxide layer, which can nevertheless react with hydrochloric acid.|$|E
5|$|Lead metal resists sulfuric and {{phosphoric acid}} but not {{hydrochloric}} or <b>nitric</b> acid; the outcome depends on insolubility and subsequent passivation {{of the product}} salt. Organic acids, such as acetic acid, dissolve lead {{in the presence of}} oxygen. Concentrated alkalis will dissolve lead and form plumbites.|$|E
5|$|Many {{saltwater}} fish manufacture {{large amounts of}} trimethylamine oxide {{to protect them from}} the high osmotic effects of their environment; conversion of this compound to dimethylamine is responsible for the early odour in unfresh {{saltwater fish}}. In animals, free radical <b>nitric</b> oxide (derived from an amino acid), serves as an important regulatory molecule for circulation.|$|E
5|$|Mercury {{does not}} react with most acids, such as dilute sulfuric acid, {{although}} oxidizing acids such as concentrated sulfuric acid and <b>nitric</b> acid or aqua regia dissolve it to give sulfate, nitrate, and chloride. Like silver, mercury reacts with atmospheric hydrogen sulfide. Mercury reacts with solid sulfur flakes, {{which are used}} in mercury spill kits to absorb mercury (spill kits also use activated carbon and powdered zinc).|$|E
5|$|Next {{studies of}} the {{chemistry}} of dubnium were reported over a decade later, in 1988. Studies at Berkeley examined whether the most stable oxidation state of dubnium in aqueous solution was +5. Dubnium was fumed twice and washed with concentrated <b>nitric</b> acid; then, its sorption of dubnium on glass cover slips was {{compared with that of}} tracers of the group 5 elements niobium and tantalum and the group 4 elements zirconium and hafnium produced on‐line under similar conditions. The group 5 elements are known to sorb on glass surfaces while the group 4 elements do not. Dubnium was confirmed as a group 5 member. However, it was surprising that behavior on extraction from mixed <b>nitric</b> acid/hydrofluoric acid solution into methyl isobutyl ketones differed between dubnium, tantalum, and niobium. Dubnium did not extract and its behavior resembled niobium more closely than tantalum, indicating that details of complexing behavior could not be predicted based only on simple extrapolations of trends within a group in the periodic table.|$|E
5|$|<b>Nitric</b> oxide (NO) is the {{simplest}} stable molecule {{with an odd}} number of electrons. In mammals, including humans, {{it is an important}} cellular signaling molecule involved in many physiological and pathological processes. It is formed by catalytic oxidation of ammonia. It is a colourless paramagnetic gas that, being thermodynamically unstable, decomposes to nitrogen and oxygen gas at 1100–1200°C. Its bonding is similar to that in nitrogen, but one extra electron is added to a π* antibonding orbital and thus the bond order has been reduced to approximately 2.5; hence dimerisation to O=N–N=O is unfavourable except below the boiling point (where the cis isomer is more stable) because it does not actually increase the total bond order and because the unpaired electron is delocalised across the NO molecule, granting it stability. There is also evidence for the asymmetric red dimer O=N–O=N when <b>nitric</b> oxide is condensed with polar molecules. It reacts with oxygen to give brown nitrogen dioxide and with halogens to give nitrosyl halides. It also reacts with transition metal compounds to give nitrosyl complexes, most of which are deeply coloured.|$|E
5|$|Nitrogen forms nine {{molecular}} oxides, some {{of which}} were the first gases to be identified: N2O (nitrous oxide), NO (<b>nitric</b> oxide), N2O3 (dinitrogen trioxide), NO2 (nitrogen dioxide), N2O4 (dinitrogen tetroxide), N2O5 (dinitrogen pentoxide), NO3 (nitrogen trioxide), N4O (nitrosylazide), and N(NO2)3 (trinitramide).)3 |journal=Angewandte Chemie International Edition |volume=50 |issue=5 |pages=1145–8 |doi=10.1002/anie.201007047}} All are thermally unstable towards decomposition to their elements. One other possible oxide that has not yet been synthesised is oxatetrazole (N4O), an aromatic ring.|$|E
5|$|Palladium is a soft silver-white {{metal that}} resembles {{platinum}}. It {{is the least}} dense and has the lowest melting point of the platinum group metals. It is soft and ductile when annealed and is greatly increased in strength and hardness when cold-worked. Palladium dissolves slowly in concentrated <b>nitric</b> acid, in hot, concentrated sulfuric acid, and when finely ground, in hydrochloric acid. It dissolves readily at room temperature in aqua regia.|$|E
5|$|Retrograde {{signaling}} {{is currently}} a contentious subject as some investigators {{do not believe the}} presynaptic cell contributes at all to the expression of LTP. Even among proponents of the hypothesis there is controversy over the identity of the messenger. Early thoughts focused on <b>nitric</b> oxide, while most recent evidence points to cell adhesion proteins.|$|E
5|$|Rhodium is a hard, silvery, durable {{metal that}} has a high reflectance. Rhodium metal does not {{normally}} form an oxide, even when heated. Oxygen is absorbed from the atmosphere only at the melting point of rhodium, but is released on solidification. Rhodium has both a higher melting point and lower density than platinum. It is not attacked by most acids: it is completely insoluble in <b>nitric</b> acid and dissolves slightly in aqua regia.|$|E
5|$|Scandium is a {{soft metal}} with a silvery appearance. It {{develops}} a slightly yellowish or pinkish cast when oxidized by air. It {{is susceptible to}} weathering and dissolves slowly in most dilute acids. It does not react with a 1:1 mixture of <b>nitric</b> acid (HNO3) and 48% hydrofluoric acid (HF), possibly due {{to the formation of}} an impermeable passive layer. Scandium turnings ignite in air with a brilliant yellow flame to form scandium(III) oxide.|$|E
5|$|Schaeffer's {{chemical}} test {{is often used}} to help identify and differentiate Agaricus species. In this test, aniline plus <b>nitric</b> acid are applied {{to the surface of the}} fruit body, and if positive, a red or orange color forms. Agaricus deserticola has a positive Schaeffer's reaction, similar to species in section Arvensis in the genus Agaricus.|$|E
5|$|Separation of the 3+ {{actinides}} {{can also}} be achieved by solvent extraction chromatography, using bis-(2-ethylhexyl) phosphoric acid (abbreviated as HDEHP) as the stationary organic phase, and <b>nitric</b> acid as the mobile aqueous phase. The actinide elution sequence is reversed {{from that of the}} cation-exchange resin column. The einsteinium separated by this method has the advantage to be free of organic complexing agent, as compared to the separation using a resin column.|$|E
5|$|Several {{chemical}} tests {{can be used}} to confirm the identify of the mushroom. A drop of ferrous sulfate (FeSO4) on the flesh turns it greenish, while potassium hydroxide (KOH) turns it brown. The cap cuticle turns yellow with <b>nitric</b> acid (HNO3), and yellow with ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH).|$|E
5|$|Several {{chemical}} tests {{can be used}} to help confirm the identify of the mushroom: a drop of dilute (3–10%) potassium hydroxide (KOH) solution will turn the tubes pale red whereas <b>nitric</b> acid (HNO3) on the tubes produces orange-yellow; a solution of Iron(II) sulfate (FeSO4) applied to the flesh results in a pale grey color.|$|E
5|$|The oxalate of americium(III), vacuum dried at room temperature, has the {{chemical}} formula Am2(C2O4)3·7H2O. Upon heating in vacuum, it loses water at 240°C and starts decomposing into AmO2 at 300°C, the decomposition completes at about 470°C. The initial oxalate dissolves in <b>nitric</b> acid with the maximum solubility of 0.25g/L.|$|E
5|$|The {{production}} process was {{and still is}} chemically straightforward, effectively dissolving lead in aqua fortis (<b>nitric</b> acid), and subsequently harvesting the precipitate. However, the production remained small-scale for many centuries, and the commercial production of lead(II) nitrate as raw material for the manufacture of other lead compounds was not reported until 1835. In 1974, the U.S. consumption of lead compounds, excluding pigments and gasoline additives, was 642tons.|$|E
5|$|The {{reaction}} yield {{is about}} 2% of the radium weight. 227Ac can further capture neutrons resulting {{in small amounts}} of 228Ac. After the synthesis, actinium is separated from radium and from the products of decay and nuclear fusion, such as thorium, polonium, lead and bismuth. The extraction can be performed with thenoyltrifluoroacetone-benzene solution from an aqueous solution of the radiation products, and the selectivity to a certain element is achieved by adjusting the pH (to about 6.0 for actinium). An alternative procedure is anion exchange with an appropriate resin in <b>nitric</b> acid, which {{can result in a}} separation factor of 1,000,000 for radium and actinium vs. thorium in a two-stage process. Actinium can then be separated from radium, with a ratio of about 100, using a low cross-linking cation exchange resin and <b>nitric</b> acid as eluant.|$|E
5|$|The {{relative}} abundance of 14N and 15N is practically constant {{in the atmosphere}} but can vary elsewhere, due to natural isotopic fractionation from biological redox reactions and the evaporation of natural ammonia or <b>nitric</b> acid. Biologically mediated reactions (e.g., assimilation, nitrification, and denitrification) strongly control nitrogen dynamics in the soil. These reactions typically result in 15N enrichment of the substrate and depletion of the product.|$|E
5|$|To extract plutonium, neutron-irradiated uranium is {{dissolved}} in <b>nitric</b> acid, and a reducing agent (FeSO4, or H2O2) {{is added to}} the resulting solution. This addition changes the oxidation state of plutonium from +6 to +4, while uranium remains in the form of uranyl nitrate (UO2(NO3)2). The solution is treated with a reducing agent and neutralized with ammonium carbonate to pH = 8 that results in precipitation of Pu4+ compounds.|$|E
5|$|Uranium is {{extracted}} from its ores in various ways. In one method, the ore is burned and then reacted with <b>nitric</b> acid to convert uranium into a dissolved state. Treating the solution {{with a solution}} of tributyl phosphate (TBP) in kerosene transforms uranium into an organic form UO2(NO3)2(TBP)2. The insoluble impurities are filtered and the uranium {{is extracted}} by reaction with hydroxides as (NH4)2U2O7 or with hydrogen peroxide as UO4·2H2O.|$|E
