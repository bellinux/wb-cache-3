The {{aircraft}} was not equipped with ground proximity warning system, nor was this required. There was no requirement for the aircraft to have a flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder (CVR), but the airline had chosen to install the latter. Interviews with the surviving passengers showed {{that none of them}} perceived that there was any problems with the flight until the sudden impact. One of the passengers was a navigation professional and could see parts of the cockpit from his seat; he was thus able to confirm some of the navigational display readings. Interviews with locals indicated that the aircraft followed a <b>normal</b> <b>path.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Occlusion {{is defined}} most simply as [...] "contacts between teeth", {{and is the}} meeting of teeth during biting and chewing. The term does not imply any disease. Malocclusion is a medical term {{referring}} to less than ideal positioning of the upper teeth relative to the lower teeth, which can occur both when the upper jaw is ideally proportioned to the lower jaw, or {{where there is a}} discrepancy between the size of the upper jaw relative to the lower jaw. Malocclusion of some sort is so common that the concept of an [...] "ideal occlusion" [...] is called into question, and it can be considered [...] "normal to be abnormal". An occlusal interference may refer to a problem which interferes with the <b>normal</b> <b>path</b> of the bite, and is usually used to describe a localized problem with the position or shape of a single tooth or group of teeth. A premature contact is one part of the bite meeting sooner than other parts, meaning {{that the rest of the}} teeth meet later or are held open, e.g., a new dental restoration on a tooth (e.g., a crown) which has a slightly different shape or position to the original tooth may contact too soon in the bite. A deflective contact/interference is an interference with the bite that changes the <b>normal</b> <b>path</b> of the bite. A common example of a deflective interference is an over-erupted upper wisdom tooth, often because the lower wisdom tooth has been removed or is impacted. In this example, when the jaws are brought together, the lower back teeth contact the prominent upper wisdom tooth before the other teeth, and the lower jaw has to move forward to allow the rest of the teeth to meet. The difference between a premature contact and a deflective interference is that the latter implies a dynamic abnormality in the bite.|$|E
2500|$|Following the {{draining}} of Lake Delton, the U.S. Department of Agriculture and Natural Resources Conservation Service allocated $160,000 to the Village of Lake Delton {{to redirect}} Dell Creek {{back to its}} <b>normal</b> <b>path</b> and through the Lake Delton Dam. [...] The reconstruction took about 10 days to complete. A cofferdam was built to intercept the water and stop further erosion. A bipartisan congressional effort worked to provide emergency federal funds to midwest areas affected by the June 2008 floods. [...] A bill was signed on June 30, 2008, that provided $390 million for the Emergency Watershed Program, which provides assistance on a matching-fund basis {{to state and local}} governmental entities.

2500|$|When Williams was nine, {{her family}} and she moved from Compton to West Palm Beach, Florida, {{so that she could}} attend the tennis academy of Rick Macci; Macci began to provide {{additional}} coaching. Macci did not always agree with Williams's father, but respected that [...] "he treated his daughters like kids, allowed them to be little girls". Richard stopped sending his daughters to national junior tennis tournaments when Williams was 10, since he wanted them to take it slow and focus on school work. Experiences of racism also drove this experience, as Richard Williams had heard white parents talk about the Williams sisters in a derogatory manner during tournaments. At that time, Williams had a 46–3 record on the United States Tennis Association junior tour and was ranked number one among under-10 players in Florida. In 1995, when Williams was in the ninth grade, her father pulled his daughters out of Macci's academy and, from then on, took over all coaching at their home. When asked in 2000 whether having followed the <b>normal</b> <b>path</b> of playing regularly on the junior circuit would have been beneficial, Williams responded: [...] "Everyone does different things. I think for Venus and I, we just attempted a different road, and it worked for us." ...|$|E
2500|$|Stewart enlisted as {{a private}} but applied for an Air Corps {{commission}} and Service Pilot rating as both a college graduate and a licensed commercial pilot. Soon to be 33, he was almost six years beyond the maximum age restriction for Aviation Cadet training, the <b>normal</b> <b>path</b> of commissioning for pilots, navigators and bombardiers. The now-obsolete auxiliary pilot ratings (Glider Pilot, Liaison Pilot and Service Pilot) differed from the Aviation Cadet Program in that a higher maximum age limit and corrected vision were allowed upon initial entry. Stewart received his commission as a second lieutenant on January 1, 1942, [...] shortly after the attack on Pearl Harbor, while a corporal at Moffett Field, California. He received his Service Pilot rating at that time, under the Service Pilot program established in March 1942 for experienced former civilian pilots. Although Service Pilots were normally restricted to noncombat flying, they were permitted to fly overseas on cargo and utility transports, typically with Air Transport, Ferry or Troop Carrier Commands. Under the regulations of the period, a Service Pilot could obtain an unrestricted Pilot rating after one year of USAAF service on flying status, provided he met certain flight experience requirements and passed an evaluation board, and some did in fact go on to combat flying assignments. Stewart's first assignment was an appearance at a March of Dimes rally in Washington, D.C., but Stewart wanted assignment to an operational unit rather than serving as a recruiting symbol. He applied for and was granted advanced training on multi-engine aircraft. Stewart was posted to nearby Mather Field to instruct in both single- and twin-engine aircraft.|$|E

In this paper, we attempt to validate whether it is beneficial to have distinct algorithmic treatments of <b>normal</b> and backup <b>path</b> calculation, configuration and maintenance. We present a modular suite of algorithms that enable us to manage <b>normal</b> and protection <b>paths</b> differently. We incorporate a distributed algorithm to separately calculate <b>normal</b> and backup <b>paths</b> in the network, using link state information, and present an asynchronous dynamic reorganization of backup paths to reduce congestion in the network.

Some landowners allow access over their land without dedicating a right of way.

40|$|Abstract: Event {{detection}} {{plays an}} essential role in video content analysis. On the other hand, according to our analy-sis, the coding structures in new video coding standard High Efficient Video Coding (HEVC) have a high correlation with video contents. Hence there is large potential to identi-fy events by reusing coding structures in HEVC, which can save a huge amount of computational resources. In this pa-per, we proposed a new compressed-domain feature for ab-normal event detection, namely Motion Intensity Count (MIC), which makes use of motion vectors, coding unit and prediction unit modes in HEVC with little computational cost. MIC can well predict the <b>normal</b> <b>paths</b> of moving ob-jects, which enables us to identify motions in unexpected locations where abnormal events are likely to happen. Our experiments show that MIC can correctly detect abnormal events at about 1250 fps...|$|R
