In this paper, a <b>network</b> <b>adapter</b> compatible with OCP interface protocol is designed to enable the integration of IP cores from different providers into an on-chip interconnection network. In order to tradeoff communication performance with complication, the design of <b>network</b> <b>adapter</b> is based on a single global address space and supports burst transmission and virtual channel technology. With the goal of reducing transport latency, the processes of encapsulation and decapsulation are executing simultaneously with packet transmitting and receiving.

25|$|Internet {{telephony}} {{is another}} common communications service {{made possible by}} the creation of the Internet. VoIP stands for Voice-over-Internet Protocol, referring to the protocol that underlies all Internet communication. The idea began in the early 1990s with walkie-talkie-like voice applications for personal computers. In recent years many VoIP systems have become as easy to use and as convenient as a normal telephone. The benefit is that, as the Internet carries the voice traffic, VoIP can be free or cost much less than a traditional telephone call, especially over long distances and especially for those with always-on Internet connections such as cable or ADSL. VoIP is maturing into a competitive alternative to traditional telephone service. Interoperability between different providers has improved and the ability to call or receive a call from a traditional telephone is available. Simple, inexpensive VoIP <b>network</b> <b>adapters</b> are available that eliminate the need for a personal computer.|$|E
500|$|The user {{base for}} the PlayStation 2 version was {{truncated}} initially because of limited sales of the PlayStation 2's hard drive and <b>network</b> <b>adapters</b> that were needed for the game. The Japanese release of Rise of the Zilart was the number one selling game when it debuted in 2003 with 90,000 copies sold in the first week. The Treasures of Aht Urhgan, released three years later, sold over 103,000 copies for the PlayStation 2 in Japan during 2006. In the United States, Final Fantasy XIs computer version sold 340,000 copies ($15.5 million) by August 2006, after its release in October 2003. It was the country's 51st best-selling computer game between January 2000 and August 2006. The Final Fantasy XI All-in-One Pack was number 36 and Wings of the Goddess was number 40 on the top 50 best-selling Xbox 360 games in Japan as of December 2007. For the AprilSeptember 2004 financial period, Square Enix saw online gaming, particularly Final Fantasy XI, sales increase by 101 percent and operating profit increase by 230.9 percent. Revenues held steady from subscription services {{in the summer of}} 2006; in the fall, however, Square acknowledged that online subscription revenues were [...] "unsatisfactory", despite the steady performance of Final Fantasy XI. In December 2003, Square Enix president Yoichi Wada announced that there were over 200,000 subscribers to Final Fantasy XI, allowing the company to break even and start making a profit. There were between 200,000 and 300,000 active players daily in 2006. As of August 14, 2006 the Xbox 360 version was the sixth most played game on Xbox Live. In June 2012, Square Enix president Yoichi Wada announced that Final Fantasy XI had become the most profitable title in the Final Fantasy series. While many MMOs have switched to some form of free-to-play, including World of Warcraft, the base monthly subscription price point for Final Fantasy XI has remained the same since its debut in 2002.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{emergence}} of fast, cheap embedded processors presents {{the opportunity for}} processing to occur on the <b>network</b> <b>adapter.</b> We are investigating how a system design incorporating such an intelligent <b>network</b> <b>adapter</b> {{can be used for}} applications that benefit from being tightly integrated with the network subsystem. We are developing a safe, extensible operating system, called SPINE, which enables applications to compute directly on the <b>network</b> <b>adapter.</b> We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach with two applications: a video client and an Internet Protocol router. As a result of our system structure, image data is transferred only once over the I/O bus and places no load on the host CPU to display video at aggregate rates exceeding 100 Mbps. Similarly, the IP router can forward roughly 10, 000 packets per second on each <b>network</b> <b>adapter,</b> while placing no load on the host CPU. Based on our experiences, we describe three hardware features useful for improving performance. Finally, we conclude that offloading work to the <b>network</b> <b>adapter</b> can make sense, even using current embedded processor technology. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the implementation {{and performance of}} a hardware-VIA-based <b>network</b> <b>adapter</b> on Gigabit Ethernet. VIA is a user-level communication interface for high performance PC clustering. The <b>network</b> <b>adapter</b> is a 64 -bit/ 66 MHz PCI plug-in card containing an FPGA for the VIA Protocol Engine and a Gigabit Ethernet chip to construct a high performance system area <b>network.</b> The <b>network</b> <b>adapter</b> performs virtual-to-physical address translation, doorbell, RDMA write, and send/receive completion operations in hardware without kernel intervention. In particular, the Address Translation Table (ATT) is stored on the local memory of the <b>network</b> <b>adapter,</b> and the VIA Protocol Engine efficiently controls the address translation process by directly accessing the ATT. In addition, Address Prefetch Buffer is used to reduce the time of address translation process in the receiver. As a result, the communication overhead during send/receive transactions is greatly reduced. Our experimental results show a minimum latency of 8. 2 Âµs, and a maximum bandwidth of 112. 1 MB/s. In terms of minimum latency, the hardware-VIA-based <b>network</b> <b>adapter</b> performs 2. 8 times and 3. 3 times faster than M-VIA, which is a software implementation of VIA, and TCP/IP, respectively, over Gigabit Ethernet. In addition, the maximum bandwidth of the hardware-VIA-based <b>network</b> <b>adapter</b> is 24 % and 55 % higher than M-VIA and TCP/IP, respectively. These {{results show that the}} performance of HVIA-GE is far better than that of ServerNet II, which is a hardware version of VIA developed by Tandem/Compaq...|$|R

50|$|In {{computing}} the SCSI RDMA Protocol (SRP) is {{a protocol}} that allows one computer to access SCSI devices attached to another computer via remote {{direct memory access}} (RDMA). The SRP protocol {{is also known as}} the SCSI Remote Protocol. The use of RDMA makes higher throughput and lower latency possible than what is possible through e.g. the TCP/IP communication protocol. RDMA is only possible with <b>network</b> <b>adapters</b> that support RDMA in hardware. Examples of such <b>network</b> <b>adapters</b> are InfiniBand HCAs and 10 GbE <b>network</b> <b>adapters</b> with iWARP support. While the SRP protocol has been designed to use RDMA networks efficiently, it is also possible to implement the SRP protocol over networks that do not support RDMA.|$|E
