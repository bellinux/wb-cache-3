5000|$|Any early {{interest}} in fiction {{was replaced by}} the sheer urgency of communication that Kgositsile felt.

5|$|In {{three of}} the {{previous}} five years, the legislature had {{failed to meet the}} June 30 deadline. On each of those occasions an agreement had been reached by the morning of July 2. Aides to Corzine claimed that the governor felt he had <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> but to order the shutdown under the state's Constitution.|$|E
5|$|Lancaster {{negotiated}} a truce with Harclay, and withdrew to the town. During the night {{a great number}} of the rebels deserted, and the next day the sheriff of York arrived from the south with additional forces. Lancaster, now greatly outnumbered and with no chance of retreat, had <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> but to surrender to Harclay.|$|E
5|$|Maben {{subsequently}} {{did some}} of the editing of the final cut at home, due to financial constraints. He regretted doing this, as he felt it was important to separate his work and home life, but, at the time, he had <b>no</b> <b>choice.</b>|$|E

5|$|The group {{searching for}} Sophia {{returns to the}} highway, where Daryl reveals {{that he has a}} bag {{containing}} painkillers and doxycycline antibiotics that T-Dog can take. Shane and Otis retrieve the supplies, but are spotted by walkers. The two have <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> but to barricade themselves in the high school.|$|E
5|$|A melancholic Darryl finally assembles {{a conference}} room meeting with several {{potential}} new hires, but utters several discouraging remarks about the job and exits, leaving Andy alone {{to take charge of}} the process. Andy does not know what he is doing and all of the applicants walk out. Darryl blames himself for the failure and demands that Andy fire him, leaving Andy baffled and with <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> but to handle the hiring of new warehouse staff himself.|$|E
5|$|If {{there is}} a clause both of whose {{variables}} are already set, {{in a way that}} falsifies the clause, then the algorithm backtracks to its most recent choice point, undoing the assignments it made since that choice, and reverses the decision made at that choice. If there is <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> point, or if the algorithm has already backtracked over the most recent choice point, then it aborts the search and reports that the input 2-CNF formula is unsatisfiable.|$|E

While saying goodbye, Chitti apologises to Vaseegaran and Sana before dismantling itself.|$|E
5|$|It {{was about}} this time that an {{incident}} occurred that temporarily clouded his career. In a moment of anger he struck one of the Thalias lieutenants, Robert Forbes. He was brought to court-martial on 12 June 1798 aboard , and the offence being proved, the court had <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> but to dismiss him from the service. In view of the mitigating circumstances, the court recommended that Paulet be considered for clemency by King George III. The King was pleased to follow the recommendation and reinstated Paulet in the service.|$|E
5|$|On 7 September 2007, {{following}} the security breach {{on the previous}} day, Taylor, Reucassel, Dominic Knight and their film crew were detained and questioned over a follow-up stunt. This incident involved running near and attempting to enter the APEC protected zone dressed in cardboard cars mounted with Canadian flags, {{a reference to the}} flags' earlier use to disguise the successful breach by the real motorcade. Police had <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> but to release all members involved in this stunt, as they were outside the prohibited area. This stunt also aired on the 12 September episode.|$|E
50|$|Stevens was {{selected}} by his hometown Seattle Seahawks as their first-round pick in the 2002 NFL Draft; he was the 28th player taken overall. Seattle traded its first-round (No. 20) and fifth-round (<b>No.</b> 156) <b>choices</b> to Green Bay for the Packers' first-round (No. 28) and second-round (<b>No.</b> 60) <b>choices.</b> Green Bay used the picks to select Javon Walker and Aaron Kampman.|$|R

Prevention literature provided by the Center for Disease Control was distributed.|$|R
50|$|Those {{points on}} a {{sociogram}} who have many choices are called Stars. Those with few or <b>no</b> <b>choices</b> are called isolates.

Cliques are groups of three or more people within a larger group who all choose each other (Mutual Choice).|$|R
5|$|On November 11, 1793, Charles IV {{dissolved}} the society. Soon {{the newspaper}} disappeared as well. Espejo had <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> but {{to work as}} a librarian in the National Library. Because of his liberal ideas, he was imprisoned on January 30, 1795, being allowed to leave his cell only to treat his patients as a doctor and, on December 23, to die at his home from the dysentery he acquired during his imprisonment. Eugenio Espejo died on December 28. His death certificate was registered in the book for Indians, mestizos, blacks and mulattoes.|$|E
5|$|Richard now had <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> but {{to comply}} with the appellants' demands; Brembre and Tresilian were {{condemned}} and executed, while de Vere and de la Polewho had by now also left the countrywere sentenced to death in absentia at the Merciless Parliament in February 1388. The proceedings went further, and a number of Richard's chamber knights were also executed, among these Burley. The appellants had now succeeded completely in breaking up the circle of favourites around the king.|$|E
5|$|Their {{cattle and}} oxen were now {{exhausted}} and lean, but the Donner Party crossed the next stretch of desert relatively unscathed, and the journey {{seemed to get}} easier, particularly through the valley next to the Ruby Mountains. Despite their near hatred of Hastings, they had <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> but to follow his tracks, which were weeks old. On September 26, two months after embarking on the cutoff, the Donner Party rejoined the traditional trail along a stream that {{became known as the}} Humboldt River. The shortcut had probably delayed them by a month.|$|E

50|$|Thus, we can {{interpret}} Boltzmann's constant {{as being}} simply the expression (in terms of more standard physical units) of the abstract logarithmic unit e {{that is needed}} to convert the dimensionless pure-number quantity ln W (which uses an arbitrary choice of base, namely e) to the more fundamental pure logarithmic quantity Log(W), which implies <b>no</b> particular <b>choice</b> of base, and thus <b>no</b> particular <b>choice</b> of physical unit for measuring entropy.|$|R
50|$|The {{design of}} the game's levels is linear; there are <b>no</b> <b>choices</b> about how to proceed or of what to say during the {{interactions}} with other characters. The levels feature energy bridges and gates, neon-glowing contours, vibrant colors, floating boxes and tiles, teleports and deep chasms. Jet will be harmed if he falls from a height (or killed if the height is great enough), or be crushed by certain moving objects in the digital world.|$|R
5|$|Umar, {{apparently}} {{wanting to}} defeat the Byzantines first, employed the best Muslim troops against them. The continuing stream of Muslim reinforcements worried the Byzantines, who fearing that the Muslims with such reinforcements would grow powerful, decided that they had <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> but to attack. The reinforcements that {{were sent to the}} Muslims at Yarmouk arrived in small bands, giving the impression of a continuous stream of reinforcements, in order to demoralize the Byzantines and compel them to attack. The same tactic would be repeated again during the Battle of Qadisiyah.|$|E
5|$|Unable {{to remain}} in one place long enough to receive provisions, Black Hawk's group were in poor health {{and some of them}} starved to death on the road. Black Hawk stated in his account of the battle that {{at this point in the}} war he had every {{intention}} of escaping with his people back across the Mississippi River, but on encountering the large U.S. force at Wisconsin Heights he was left with <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> but to fight. His intention was to allow the non-combatants in his band to escape across the Wisconsin River.|$|E
5|$|When Lancaster {{arrived at}} the town of Boroughbridge, Harclay was already in {{possession}} of the bridge crossing the river. The rebel forces counted probably no more than 700 knights and men-at-arms, against the 4,000 or so soldiers in the royal army. Lancaster initially tried to negotiate, but Harclay could not be swayed. Since there was no realistic alternative place to cross the river, and with the royal forces in pursuit from the south, the rebels had <b>no</b> <b>choice</b> but to fight. The ensuing battle was short and one-sided.|$|E
