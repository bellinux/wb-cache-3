But that, so far as one's fellow wayfarers were concerned, would still be possible. Only the State would share the secret of one's little concealment. To the {{eighteenth-century}} Liberal, to the old-fashioned nineteenth-century Liberal, {{that is to say}} to all professed Liberals, brought up to be against the Government on principle, this organised clairvoyance will be the most hateful of dreams. Perhaps, too, the Individualist would see it in that light. But these are only the mental habits acquired in an evil time. The old Liberalism assumed bad government, the more powerful the government the worse it was, just as it assumed the natural righteousness of the free individual. Darkness and secrecy were, indeed, the natural refuges of liberty when every government had in it the <b>near</b> <b>possibility</b> of tyranny, and the Englishman or American looked at the papers of a Russian or a German as one might look at the chains of a slave. You imagine that father of the old Liberalism, Rousseau, slinking off from his offspring {{at the door of the}} Foundling Hospital, and you can understand what a crime against natural virtue this quiet eye of the State would have seemed to him. But suppose we do not assume that government is necessarily bad, and the individual necessarily good--and the hypothesis upon which we are working practically abolishes either alternative--then we alter the case altogether. The government of a modern Utopia will be no perfection of intentions ignorantly ruling the world.... [Footnote: In the typical modern State of our own world, with its population of many millions, and its extreme facility of movement, undistinguished men who adopt an alias can make themselves untraceable with the utmost ease. The temptation of the opportunities thus offered has developed a new type of criminality, the Deeming or Crossman type, base men who subsist and feed their heavy imaginations in the wooing, betrayal, ill-treatment, and sometimes even the murder of undistinguished women. This is a large, a growing, and, what is gravest, a prolific class, fostered by the practical anonymity of the common man. It is only the murderers who attract much public attention, but the supply of low-class prostitutes is also largely due to these free adventures of the base. It is one of the bye products of State Liberalism, and at present it is very probably drawing ahead in the race against the development of police organisation.] ...|$|E

Our experiments were focused on the application of nanorobot (red cells) to make them immune resistant against viruses and making them as useful contrast agents in magnetic resonance imaging use based on their behavior in nanomagnetic fields. It consists of an injection of perhaps a few cubic centimeters of nano-sized nanorobots suspended in specific pH fluid (probably a water/saline suspension). The typical therapeutic concentration was up to 1 - 10 trillion (1 trillion = 10 raise to power 12) individual nanorobots, although in some cases treatment only require a few million or a few billion individual nanodevice-like red cells to be injected.

40|$|Background: Speaker {{recognition}} systems plays {{a pivotal}} role in the field of forensics, security and biometric authentication for verifying or identifying the speaker from the group of speakers. Methods: This paper gives a brief introduction about developing a hardware based speaker recognition system using Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) which are extracted from input speech signal to linearize the frequency scale at higher frequencies and Perceptron Neural Networks to provide layer weights for verifying the speaker identity to compare the output in the database of stored speaker identities. Findings: The input speech features are extracted using blocking and windowing to reduce noise and get the audio samples to store in the RAM where sampled data is converted into frequency domain using FFT to get the Cepstral Coefficients which are normalised and fed to neural network tool box present in the MATLAB to obtain layer weights for given set of data and the output is compared with the saved speaker identities to find a match. The decision making logic is written in NIOS II processor of FPGA where the taken input features are compared to the existing database of speaker identities with the help of perceptron neural network layer weights which gives the <b>nearest</b> <b>possibility</b> of the match in the database of the group of speakers. The designed system has been tested using two speakers as reference where the vowels spoken by them are taken into account to compare with the database of speakers already stored in FPGA. Conclusion/ Improvements: The probability of detection of the speakers is 80 % and verifying the speaker is quite accurate in hardware based systems than in software based systems where performance factor is less. The given performance in the designed system can be increased by retraining the neural networks which can provide nearly 90 % in detecting the speaker. *Author for correspondenc...|$|R

The use of paste backfill is gaining popularity, however various technical, environmental and regulatory constraints complexify the study of its behaviour.

Moreover, this study explores data mining, statistical analysis, and semantic analysis methods to obtain valuable information on public opinion and requirements based on Chinese microblog data. Typhoon Chan-hom is used as an example. Semantic analysis on microblog data is conducted and high-frequency keywords in different provinces are extracted for different stages of the event.
