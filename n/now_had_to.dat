5|$|Having {{managed to}} quietly depose their father, the {{brothers}} <b>now</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> deal with Constantine VII. Unfortunately for them, rumours soon spread around Constantinople, {{to the effect}} that, following Romanos's deposition, Constantine VII's life was in danger. Before long, crowds gathered before the palace, demanding to see their emperor in person. The contemporary Lombard historian Liutprand of Cremona notes that the ambassadors and envoys from Amalfi, Gaeta, Rome, and Provence present in the capital also supported Constantine VII. Stephen and his brother had to succumb to the inevitable, recognizing their brother-in-law as the senior emperor.|$|E

5|$|The {{trade with}} the North German towns lasted until the 1707 Act of Union, when high salt duties {{prevented}} the German merchants from trading with Shetland. Shetland then went into an economic depression, as the local traders were not as skilled in trading salted fish. However, some local merchant-lairds took up where the German merchants had left off, and fitted out their own ships to export fish from Shetland to the Continent. For the independent farmers of Shetland this had negative consequences, as they <b>now</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> fish for these merchant-lairds.|$|E
5|$|By {{the morning}} of 29 April it was {{estimated}} that approximately 10,000 people had gathered around the Embassy, while some 2,500 evacuees were in the Embassy and consular compounds. The crowds prevented the use of buses for transporting evacuees from the Embassy to the DAO Compound for evacuation and the Embassy gates were closed to prevent the crowd from surging through. Eligible evacuees <b>now</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> make themselves known to the Marine guards or Embassy staff manning the walls and were then lifted over the walls and into the Embassy compound. Among those arriving at the Embassy were Dr Phan Quang Dan, former Deputy Prime Minister and Minister responsible for social welfare and refugee resettlement, and Lieutenant-General Dang Van Quang.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, {{tensions}} faded, but {{a bigger}} decision awaited Robert Breckinridge in 1828. He {{was chosen to}} sit on a committee that would draft Kentucky's response to the Nullification Crisis. Because much of South Carolina's reasoning for their actions was based on the logic of the Kentucky Resolutions, which had been supported by Senator John Breckinridge, Robert Breckinridge <b>now</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> determine whether he should support the words of his late father or refute them. In the end, his Unionist sympathies overrode his sense of loyalty to his father; he sided with the committee's majority in condemning South Carolina's actions.|$|E

Shetland then went into an economic depression as the Scottish and local traders were not as skilled in trading with salted fish.

5|$|In 1503, Cairano {{made the}} last {{deliveries}} in the Caesar cycle {{for the front}} of the Loggia palace, and finished up the bulk of his work on the site; no further records of his presence exist. For the artist, this was the end of his big public commissions, which he probably gained before establishing his career and subsequent success. He <b>now</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> reorganise his business and set up closer ties with the contacts he made during his work at the Loggia, including co-workers and other artists in and around Brescia, looking for major commissions. However, his path appeared to lead him increasingly toward sacred art. In 1504, the canon of the Basilica of San Pietro de Dom, Francisco Franzi of Orzinuovi bequeathed the construction of a chapel in the cathedral. Nothing further is known of this commission.|$|E
5|$|Marlborough <b>now</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> {{turn his}} {{attention}} from the fleeing enemy to direct Churchill to detach more infantry to storm Blenheim. Orkney's infantry, Hamilton's English brigade and St Paul's Hanoverians moved across the trampled wheat to the cottages. Fierce hand-to-hand fighting gradually forced the French towards the village centre, {{in and around the}} walled churchyard which had been prepared for defence. Hay and Ross's dismounted dragoons were also sent, but suffered under a counter-charge delivered by the regiments of Artois and Provence under command of Colonel de la Silvière. Colonel Belville's Hanoverians were fed into the battle to steady the resolve of the dragoons, and once more went to the attack. The Allied progress was slow and hard, and like the defenders, they suffered many casualties.|$|E

Fifty Egyptians surrendered at Mutanah, near Humaidat. They were eventually allowed to evacuate to San'a with their arms. Mohamed's policy was to keep officers as prisoners for exchange, and to allow soldiers to go {{in return for their}} arms.

5|$|Nicol {{made his}} major league debut for the Browns on September 23, 1890, {{starting}} the {{game against the}} Philadelphia Athletics {{that resulted in a}} 21–2 win. He did not allow a single hit to the Athletics through seven innings, after which the game was called off due to darkness. Although the game was previously considered a no-hitter, a rule change made by the MLB's Committee on Statistical Accuracy in 1991 redefined the definition of a no-hitter; a no-hit game <b>now</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> span a minimum of nine innings. As a result, Nicol's debut was one of fifty no-hitters deleted from the official record books.|$|E
5|$|Robert Ferrers, Earl of Derby, was {{singled out}} in {{particular}} for his central {{involvement in the}} rebellion, and for him the multiple was seven rather than five.

Those who had not taken part in the fighting themselves, but had incited others to rise up against the king, were fined at two years' value, while those who had been compelled to fight, or played only a minor part, had to pay one year's value of their land. The proceedings from the fines were awarded to royal supporters, some of whom had already been awarded parts of the rebels' land, and <b>now</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> give it back.|$|E

Hurdt and Amangkurat's column re-assembled in Godong on the Serang River and stayed there for six days. Their artillery and supplies were brought there by river, but <b>now</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> join the southward march overland through enemy territory. This column then joined Tack's column in the Solo River valley (the river was then called the Semanggi River). Meanwhile, van Renesse and Mulder's column passed Pati, was joined by the VOC troops there, and marched through a different route towards Kediri.|$|E
5|$|The McDonnell {{design was}} {{therefore}} reworked into an all-weather fighter-bomber with 11 external hardpoints for weapons and on 18 October 1954, the company {{received a letter}} of intent for two YAH-1 prototypes. On 26 May 1955, four Navy officers arrived at the McDonnell offices and, within an hour, presented the company with an entirely new set of requirements. Because the Navy already had the Douglas A-4 Skyhawk for ground attack and F-8 Crusader for dogfighting, the project <b>now</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> fulfill {{the need for an}} all-weather fleet defense interceptor. A second crewman was added to operate the powerful radar.|$|E
5|$|The convoy was {{protected}} by two frigates, the Vestale and the Brun. The French finally {{came out on the}} evening of the fifteenth day, and were engaged by Southampton, despite the French possessing considerably more firepower. After a sustained engagement Southampton forced Vestale to strike her colours while the Brun escaped with the convoy, leaving Vestale to her fate. But as Southampton prepared to lower her boats to take possession of the French ship, her fore-mast, which had been damaged during the engagement, went by the board. Taking advantage of this, Vestale raised her colours and escaped from the scene. Victory over the Vestale should have brought promotions for Southamptons officers, including Lydiard, but her escape deprived them of this. Lydiard <b>now</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> secure another triumph to ensure his promotion.|$|E

5|$|The return match saw Celta Vigo's Jesuli {{level the}} tie on {{aggregate}} after 24 minutes. Celtic rallied, and on 37 minutes John Hartson used his body strength to force {{his way into}} the Spanish penalty box and score with a powerful shot. Crucially, due to the away goals rule, Celta Viga <b>now</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> score twice to avoid losing the tie. Benni McCarthy scored early in the second half for Celta Vigo but, despite a glaring miss from Jesuli near the end, Celtic held on to win the tie on away goals.

5|$|With air {{supremacy}} attained, Luftflotte 2 turned to support of ground operations, particularly guarding the flanks of the armoured spearheads, without which the rapid advance was not possible. When enemy counterattacks threatened, Kesselring threw {{the full weight}} of his force against them. Now that the Army was convinced of the value of air support, units were all too inclined to call for it. Kesselring <b>now</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> convince the Army that air support should be concentrated at critical points. He strove to improve army–air cooperation with new tactics and the appointment of Colonel Martin Fiebig as a special close air support commander. By 26 July, Kesselring reported the destruction of 165 tanks, 2,136 vehicles and 194 artillery pieces.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the output}} of copper {{currency}} had expanded immensely by 1085, some fifty copper mines were shut down between the years 1078 and 1085. Although there were on average more copper mines found in Northern Song China {{than in the previous}} Tang dynasty, this case was reversed during the Southern Song with a sharp decline and depletion of mined copper deposits by 1165. Even though copper cash was abundant in the late 11th century, Chancellor Wang Anshi's tax substitution for corvée labor and government takeover of agricultural finance loans meant that people <b>now</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> find additional cash, driving up the price of copper money which would become scarce. To make matters worse, large amounts of government-issued copper currency exited the country via international trade, while the Liao dynasty and Western Xia actively pursued the exchange of their iron-minted coins for Song copper coins. As evidenced by an 1103 decree, the Song government became cautious about its outflow of iron currency into the Liao Empire when it ordered that the iron was to be alloyed with tin in the smelting process, thus depriving the Liao of a chance to melt down the currency to make iron weapons.|$|E
