In this case combined mechanical and environmental actions may act simultaneously and their synergetic influences {{have to be taken}} into consideration. In this contribution results of tests on two different types of concrete and mortars are presented and discussed. Capillary absorption of <b>not</b> <b>carbonated</b> and carbonated concrete has been determined. The influence of mechanical load on capillary suction has been studied separately. A moderate compressive load reduces the coefficient of capillary suction, while capillary suction is enhanced by higher mechanical loads as micro-cracks are formed. Chloride diffusion has been measured by means of the diffusion cell test. The diffusion coefficient observed in carbonated concrete is roughly speaking one order of magnitude higher than the value measured on <b>not</b> <b>carbonated</b> concrete. ...|$|E
40|$|Carbonation is a naturally-occurring {{process whereby}} Ca-containing cement phases lose their {{hydration}} water and are converted to carbonate minerals by reaction with atmospheric CO 2. As these secondary minerals {{develop in the}} microstructure of hydrated cement, porosity, pore-size distribution and permeability are decreased. These are all considered desirable properties in a wasteform. The objective {{of this study was}} to examine the effect of carbonation and different pozzolans on the leach performance and mechanical strength of ordinary Portland cement (OPC) wasteforms. Two methods of accelerated cement carbonation were used: 1. A "vacuum" carbonation method, where wasteforms are placed in an evacuated, sealed cell and subjected to small additions of CO 2 over several days at near vacuum conditions; and 2. A "one-step" carbonation method, where CO 2 gas is added to the wasteform paste as it is being mixed. Thirteen elemental constituents of interest to the safety assessments of long-term management of Ontario Power Generation's radioactive waste (Cl, N, S, Se, C, Th, Pb, Co, Ni, Cu, Sr, Ba and Cs) were stabilised/solidified via cement mix water. Wasteforms were produced with only OPC, OPC and fly ash, or OPC and silica fume. Most wasteforms were carbonated using one of the carbonation methods. Some wasteforms were <b>not</b> <b>carbonated</b> and served as controls. Wasteforms were subjected to either standard leach tests or compressive strength tests.

50|$|Listwanite (also {{sometimes}} spelled listvenite, listvanite, or listwaenite) {{is unusual}} rock type that forms when ultramafic rocks (most commonly mantle peridotites) are completely carbonated. The pyroxene and olivine minerals found in peridotite commonly alter to form carbonate and serpentine minerals. However, peridotites are usually <b>not</b> completely <b>carbonated.</b> Rather, they typically contain carbonate veins (primarily magnesite; also calcite, dolomite, and other carbonates). Complete carbonation of peridotite means {{that every single}} atom of magnesium and calcium {{as well as some}} of the iron atoms has combined with CO2 to form secondary carbonate minerals such a magnesite and calcite. The silica atoms in listwanite are found in quartz. Thus, liswanites consist of quartz (a rusty red color) and carbonate and also sometimes talc and Cr-muscovite (a mineral known as mariposite/fuchsite).|$|R

40|$|Alkali-activated {{materials}} (AAM) {{have received}} increasing interest {{during the past}} few decades due to their environmental and technological advantages. However the durability of these binders is still considered as an unproven issue {{that needs to be addressed}} before their commercial adoption and large-scale production. The present work is focussed on the investigation of durability performances of concretes manufactured through the alkaline activation of fly ash and slag blends using a low-concentrated activating solution (formulated by blending commercial sodium silicate and sodium hydroxide). The aim of this study is to provide new insights on durability properties of AAM and to assess their resistance under severe conditions. For that purpose, concrete specimens have been exposed to accelerated carbonation (varying the curing and the exposure times from 7 to 28 days). After 28 days curing, their chloride resistance has been assessed using the non-steady-state chloride migration experiments following the NordTest method (NT Built 492). Prior to durability test, the compressive strength of investigated mixtures was determined at early ages (1, 7 days) and after 28, 56, 90 days curing. The slag-rich mixtures have shown high compressive strength values (~ 45 MPa after 1 day and ~ 80 MPa after 28 days curing). Excellent mechanical properties have been also found for the fly ash-rich mixtures at early and late curing ages (15 MPa after only 1 day and ~ 50 MPa after 28 days curing). From carbonation test, it has been found that the carbonation depth increases as increasing fly ash/slag ratio or the exposure time. However when curing time is increased, a decrease on carbonation depth was observed. Slag-rich concretes were practically <b>not</b> <b>carbonated</b> after 7, 14 days exposure and showed 3 - 7 mm carbonation depth after 28 days exposure. A higher carbonation depth (~ 18 mm) was observed in fly ash-rich mixture. When the concrete specimens were exposed to chloride ingress, a high chloride permeability associated with higher concrete porosity was found for fly ash-rich mixtures with a chloride penetration depth of 18 mm and chloride migration coefficient near 15 - 17 × 10 - 12 m 2 s- 1. These parameters decreased considerably as increasing slag content reaching values near 5 mm and 2 × 10 - 12 m 2 s- 1, respectively. Materials and Environmen...|$|E

Thirteen elemental constituents of interest to the safety assessments of long-term management of Ontario Power Generation's radioactive waste (Cl, N, S, Se, 13 C, Th, Pb, Co, Ni, Cu, Sr, Ba and Cs) were stabilised/solidified via cement mix water. Wasteforms were produced with only OPC, OPC and fly ash, or OPC and silica fume. Most wasteforms were carbonated using one of the carbonation methods. Some wasteforms were <b>not</b> <b>carbonated</b> and served as controls. Wasteforms were subjected to either standard leach tests or compressive strength tests. The extent of carbonation was found to be about 20 % for vacuum carbonation method, substantially higher than that for one-step treatment (up to about 10 %). For vacuum carbonated wasteforms, carbonation occurred at the outer selvages of the wasteforms, whereas one-step treatment resulted in homogenous carbonation. Generally, compared to uncarbonated OPC wasteforms, vacuum carbonation increased leaching of elements that are anionic in cementitious conditions (Cl, N, S, Se, 13 C, Th), decreased leaching of large metal cations (Sr, Ba, Cs, Pb) and had negligible effect on the leaching of the elements that form hydroxyl complexes (Co, Ni, Cu). 13 C was the only anionic element whose leachability was reduced by vacuum carbonation, as it may be precipitated in the form CO 32 - in the large quantity of secondary carbonate minerals produced during the vacuum carbonation process. One-step carbonation did not result in substantial reductions in leachability, compared to uncarbonated OPC wasteforms. However, it had an interesting inverse effect on large metal cation leachability from fly ash- and silica fume-containing wasteforms. A model is presented that proposes that porewater pH changes can have an effect on waste element leachability because 1) the C-S-H Ca/Si ratio is dependent on the equilibrating porewater pH and 2) the degree of ion sorption on C-S-H is dependent on the C-S-H Ca/Si ratio. This model should be tested experimentally as it has important implications on wasteform design. Because of this inverse behaviour, overall neither pozzolan outperformed the other with respect to leachability. Generally, for uncarbonated wasteforms, OPC retained the elements more effectively than OPC with pozzolans. For pozzolans, the leachability of these elements from OPC with fly ash was lower than that of OPC with silica fume. Leaching of Cs was anomalously low from uncarbonated OPC wasteforms, but follow-up experimentation did not corroborate this anomaly. Further testing of these wasteforms to determine how the mineralogical fate of Cs can differ between wasteforms is recommended. All wasteforms tested were of acceptable strength (< 0. 689 MPa). Fly ash, and, to a greater degree, silica fume, improved wasteform strength when compared to OPC wasteforms. Carbonation treatments had little effect on wasteform strength. This study has provided much information about the leaching characteristics of a representative set of waste elements from several cement-based wasteform treatments. Although it has not indicated a wasteform design that is ideal for all elements studied, it does suggest that some treatments may be effective for certain groups of elements. Most notably, vacuum carbonation shows promise in improving the immobilisation of isotopes of large metal cations such as Sr, Ba, Cs and Pb as well as 14 C (as suggested by 13 C here) in cement-based wasteforms...|$|E

40|$|International audiencePurposeAlexander Randall {{identified}} {{calcium phosphate}} plaques in renal papillae as {{the origin of}} kidney stones. However, {{little is known about}} the early steps of Randall’s plaque formation, preceding the onset of urolithiasis. Our objectives were to characterize the composition and the initial formation site of incipient Randall’s plaque in non-stone formers living patients. Material and MethodsMedian age of the patients was 67. 7 years. Fifty-four healthy papillae from kidneys removed for cancer and without stones have been analyzed by immunohistochemistry and Von Kossa staining, Field Emission-Scanning Electron Microscopy with Energy Dispersive X-ray analysis, μ-Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy, Cryo-Transmission Electron Microscopy coupled to Selected-Area Electron Diffraction and Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy. ResultsIncipient Randall’s plaque has been observed in 72. 7 % of kidneys. Carbonated apatite was as expected the main component of microcalcifications but amorphous calcium phosphate and whitlockite have been identified in 80 % and 40 % of the papillae, respectively. Incipient plaques stood in the deepest part of the papillae, around the loop of Henle tip but also around vasa recta (respectively 62. 4 % and 37. 2 % of microcalcifications) and rarely close to collecting ducts. At the nanoscale level, incipient calcifications were often made of several nanocrystals inside organic material looking like microvesicles. ConclusionsIncipient Randall’s plaque is frequent and appears at the extreme tip of renal papillae, around the hairpin structure of the loop of Henle but also around vasa recta. Nanoscale analyses suggest a local nucleation process promoting nanocrystal growth in a supersaturated milieu. In addition, plaques contain various calcium and magnesium phosphates and <b>not</b> only <b>carbonated</b> apatite...|$|R

The tests were carried out under 3 different exposure conditions: at high relative humidity (C-HRH); partially immersed in 3. 5 % NaCl (C-PD; and with CaCl 2 added during mortar mixing and exposed to high relative humidity (C-HRHCl). Corrosion potential (Ecorr) measurements and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were used to monitor the behavior during the first 8 years of exposure. Then, anodic polarization tests were carried out and the exposure was extended for another additional year. Stainless steels do <b>not</b> corrode in <b>carbonated</b> conditions without chlorides, but some grades can suffer localized corrosion if they are submitted to high anodic polarizations. Low-Ni, austenitic S 20430 corrugated bars are especially prone to suffer a low-intensity corrosive attack in carbonated mortars with chlorides. Moreover, the corrosion rate of S 20430 bars can easily increase under moderate anodic polarizations.

The results of surviving CFU showed that the fungal growth is mostly determined by the carbonation level and the type of the mold strain. Neither the inoculation level nor the mineral content had any significant effect on the survival of the different mold strains. Results showed decreased CFU numbers in carbonated waters, while slow decreasing, stagnation or even some growth in still waters. A. fumigatus was the most resistant test species.

40|$|Chlorides {{have been}} {{reported}} to be present in several field cases where thaumasite attack has occurred. However, no published systematic research dealing with the role of chloride in the thaumasite form of sulfate attack could be found in the literature. This research project has been designed through a comprehensive experimental programme to address this issue. This investigation studies the following: the formation of thaumasite in long-term exposure of carbonated systems to sulfate environment; whether or not the presence of chloride affects the thaumasite form of sulfate attack (TSA); the effect of long-term and short-term carbonation on the precipitation of thaumasite; the composition of thaumasite formed in chloride containing solutions; the chloride binding capacity of thaumasite-affected cement matrix; and the use of metakaolin to prevent TSA in carbonated mortar. Mortar samples were cast using siliceous sand and Portland cement replaced by different amounts (0, 5 and 15 %) of limestone filler, and by 10 % metakaolin. Mortar cubes were subsequently stored in deionised water, magnesium sulfate solution, combined sulfate and sodium chloride solution and simulated seawater at 5 °C and 20 °C. Long-term specimens consisted of Portland cement mortars containing 15 % limestone filler, which were exposed to atmospheric carbonation at 5 and 20 °C for 5 years, were also immersed in these salt solutions at both temperatures. The mortar cubes were examined regularly every month, and the results of visual assessment recorded. The mineralogy of the deteriorated products was determined by x-ray diffraction (XRD), infrared spectroscopy (IRS). The pH of the solutions was also measured periodically. The composition of the thaumasite and the deteriorated cement matrix was assessed by means of the determination of the unit cell parameters of the crystal, by quantitative infrared spectroscopy (IRS); scanning electron microscopy (SEM); backscattered electron image (BEI) and chemical analyses by energy dispersive X-ray and quantitative x-ray microanalyses. The results indicate that the effect of chloride on sulfate attack is affected by temperature, because it affects the solubility of some minerals and increases the activity of carbonates. At 20 °C, the presence of chlorides appears to mitigate sulfate attack by combining with the aluminates of the cement forming Friedel's salt. At this temperature, the main carbonate phases were calcite and aragonite, whereas thaumasite was predominant in all samples at 5 °C, which caused damage that increased with increase in the chloride concentration in solution and the carbonate content, as evidenced by increased loss of mass and pH. Because of the demand for an alkaline environment, thaumasite did not precipitate within the long-term carbonated surface areas, but immediately underneath. The formation of thaumasite was <b>not</b> prevented in <b>carbonated</b> specimens after short-term. In the presence of chloride, thaumasite precipitated with lower lattice parameter c, indicative of a higher carbonate to sulfate ratio, and its composition shifted towards the thaumasite end-member of the solid- solution series. Thus, chloride does not seem to enter into thaumasite crystal structure. In addition, the chloride binding capacity of thaumasite-affected areas of the cement is reduced as the residual CSH phase both decalcifies and loses its silicon to give place to the deposition of thaumasite. The performance of metakaolin containing mortars in salt solutions was improved by the pozzolanic effect, but also by an increase in the chloride binding capacity, which reduced the deleterious effect of the chloride on the formation of thaumasite. However, metakaolin-containing samples in magnesium sulfate developed some signs of damage that were detected after 18 months. The interaction between chloride and other ionic species on thaumasite formation in the cement matrix is very complex, and can have some implications to the CaC 03 threshold for durable concretes under TSA prone environments and also to the steel corrosion of concrete reinforcement...|$|R
