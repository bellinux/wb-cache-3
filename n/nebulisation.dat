40|$|Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) {{is one of}} the commonest {{long-term}} conditions worldwide. It is characterised by chronic airflow limitation, pathological {{changes in}} the lung and significant extra-pulmonary manifestations. The treatment of an acute exacerbation of COPD (AECOPD), involves glucocorticoids and bronchodilators supplemented by antibiotics if needed. In-hospital, oxygen, which has potential risks as well as benefits, and additional respiratory support can be given if the patient deteriorates. Clinicians need to decide which treatment to provide and who can be safely discharged. This has led to the advent of scoring systems to define severity in COPD This thesis examines the evidence base for the use of magnesium in airways disease and presents the results of the first randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial using nebulised magnesium in the treatment of AECOPD. 116 patients were randomised, but after 3 <b>nebulisations</b> over 90 minutes, {{there was no significant difference}} in FEV 1 compared to placebo (p= 0. 67). In a second study, the CRB 65 score was retrospectively assigned to a cohort of patients presenting to the emergency department with AECOPD, using data collected from a previous audit. Patients with a CRB 65 score of 0 or 1 had a low risk of in-hospital and 30 - day mortality and could be considered for discharge, whereas those with scores between 2 - 4 required admission with mortality increasing with the score. The CRB 65 score showed a similar utility in AECOPD as it does in pneumonia. Finally, 18 subjects with stable but severe COPD were randomised in a crossover study to two <b>nebulisations</b> with salbutamol and ipratropium over 15 minutes with a five minute interval between <b>nebulisations,</b> using air or oxygen as the driving gas. When oxygen was used there was a 3. 1 mmHg difference (p< 0. 001) at 35 minutes, compared to air, illustrating the potential risks of repeated <b>nebulisations</b> to those with severe COPD...|$|R
30|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} that prolonged use of IV colistin predisposes to VAP caused by pandrug-resistant bacteria, probably related to colistin poor lung tissue penetration and low concentrations at the infection site [39, 40], whereas nebulised colistin with a higher tissue concentrations in infected lung regions prevent selection of resistant strains [11]. On the other hand, acquisition of colistin resistance or increase in MICs was also reported and likely due to the incomplete destruction of the bronchial epithelium by colistin <b>nebulisations</b> and to production of a biofilm that constitute a protective space for bacteria and facilitate selection of resistant mutants [41, 42]. Low rates of acquisition of resistance were reported in recent studies [9, 29, 43]. As well, the current study did not detect an emergence of strains resistant to colistin acquisition. Yet, this finding must be interpreted reservedly because of the short follow-up in our series.|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} the effects of bodyweight (BW) gain on respiratory function and airway responsiveness in healthy Beagles using barometric whole body plethysmography (BWBP). Six adult dogs were examined before and after a fattening diet. The high-energy diet induced a mean increase in BW of 41 ± 6 %. BWBP basal parameters were recorded prior to airway reactivity testing (using increasing concentrations of histamine <b>nebulisations).</b> An airway responsiveness index (H-Penh 300) was calculated as the histamine concentration necessary to reach 300 % of basal enhanced pause (Penh, bronchoconstriction index). The same dogs underwent a doxapram hydrochloride (Dxp) stimulation testing 2 weeks later. Basal measurements showed that obese dogs had tidal volume per kg (TV/BW) that was significantly decreased whilst respiratory rate (RR) increased significantly. H-Penh 300 decreased significantly in obese Beagles, indicating increased bronchoreactivity. Dxp administration induced {{a significant increase in}} TV/BW, minute volume per kg (MV/BW), peak inspiratory and expiratory flows per kg (PIF/BW and PEF/BW) in both normal and obese dogs although the TV/BW increase was significantly less marked in the obese group. In conclusion, obesity induced changes in basal respiratory parameters, increased bronchoreactivity and a blunted response to Dxp-induced respiratory stimulation. This combination of basal respiratory parameters, bronchoreactivity testing and pharmacological stimulation testing using non-invasive BWBP can help characterize pulmonary function and airway responsiveness in obese dogs.

40|$|SummaryNebulised {{iloprost}} {{is established}} therapy of severe pulmonary hypertension; however, {{the effects on}} the bronchoalveolar compartment have not been investigated so far. We studied the short- and long-term effects of nebulised iloprost on pulmonary function tests and gas exchange in 63 patients with severe pulmonary hypertension (idiopathic n= 17, chronic thromboembolism n= 15, connective tissue disease n= 12, congenital heart disease n= 11, respiratory diseases n= 8). Patients received iloprost in increasing dose up to 140 μg iloprost/ 24 h via an ultrasonic nebuliser. Short-term effects were assessed before and after every nebulisation: peak expiration flow decreased in mean by 1. 9 % (423 ± 98 to 415 ± 98) and percutaneous oxygen saturation increased in mean by 0. 7 % (90 ± 6 to 91 ± 5) post-nebulisation. There {{were no significant differences}} concerning underlying diagnosis or dose of nebulised iloprost. Within 3 months, 9 patients stopped treatment due to non-compliance with frequent <b>nebulisations</b> (n= 3), or severe side effects (n= 4); 2 patients with additional obstructive lung disease developed bronchoconstriction. Long-term effects were assessed by pulmonary function tests and gas exchange parameters at baseline and after 3 months treatment. There were no significant differences after 3 months therapy neither in FEV 1, FVC, TLC, residual volume nor in diffusions capacity, SO 2 at rest and during 6 min walking test, also in respect of the underlying diseases. However, there was a significant increase in 6 min walking distance (6 MWD) after 3 months (246 ± 113 to 294 ± 115 m, P< 0. 05). In conclusion, treatment with nebulised iloprost leads to functional improvement in severe pulmonary hypertension without systematic adverse short- and long-term effects on pulmonary function test or gas exchange. Patients with additional obstructive lung disease might develop bronchoconstriction. Severe side effects leading to discontinuation of treatment occurred in 9 % of patients...|$|R

40|$|Objective: The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were, to select a nebuliser first, that operates safely in a neonatal ventilator setting and, second, that is most efficient. Thirdly, we studied the particle sizes of the surfactant aerosol. Fourthly, we studied where the nebulised surfactant is deposited in the tubing system of the ventilator. Finally, we studied whether <b>nebulisation</b> influences the composition and biophysical properties of surfactant. Measurements and results: Safety was assessed by measuring ''mean airway pressures'' in a test lung before, during and after surfactant <b>nebulisation,</b> for three jet nebulisers. The MiniNEB did not alter these pressures, and is thus safe, whereas the other two nebulisers (Intersurgical and Flo-Thru) increased these pressures. The efficiency of <b>nebulisation</b> was assessed by measuring the amount of phospholipid deposited in the test lung. The MiniNEB showed the highest efficiency: 10 % versus 1 - 3 % {{of the other two}} nebulisers. The particle sizes of surfactant aerosol were assessed by the laser diffraction method. Seventy percent of the particles were 1 - 5 mu m. The deposition of surfactant aerosol in the tubing system was assessed by nebulising surfactant that was labelled with Tc- 99 m Nanocoll. Afterwards the tubing system was imaged using a gamma camera. The majority of surfactant was deposited in the expiratory hose (28 %), nebuliser (20 %), Y-piece (16 %) and expiratory filter (12 %). Finally the phospholipid composition, spreading velocity, static and dynamic surface tensions were assessed for the nebulised surfactant and compared to the stock surfactant. In addition, nebulised surfactant was instilled in premature rabbits and tidal volumes were measured to assess the dose-response relation. We found that neither the composition nor biophysical properties had been altered by <b>nebulisation.</b> Conclusions: The MiniNEB nebulised surfactant safely in a neonatal ventilator setting with respect to airway pressures. The efficiency of <b>nebulisation</b> is low: the majority of the surfactant aerosol is deposited in the expiratory tubing. The surfactant composition and function is not altered by <b>nebulisation.</b> Therefore the <b>nebulisation</b> of surfactant is feasible, but efforts should be made to improve the efficiency of this procedure...|$|E

Studies on the efficiency of nebuliser systems are constantly required in view of the large number of compressor/drug/nebuliser combinations which are possible and the development of new systems and drugs. Six combinations of three commercially available compressors were compared (PortaNeb 50 (Medic-Aid; 5. 4 - 6. 1 l/min), Turboneb (Medix; 8. 3 - 9. 1 l/min), and CR 60 (Medic-Aid; 7. 3 - 7. 8 l/min)) and two jet nebulisers (Microneb III (Lifecare) and System 22 Acorn (Medic-Aid)) for the <b>nebulisation</b> of colomycin, gentamicin, and ciprofloxacin.

Turboneb and CR 60 reduced the <b>nebulisation</b> time and produced higher proportions of 'respirable' (< 5 microns diameter) antibiotic aerosols. The residual volume of the Microneb III was lower than that of the System 22 Acorn. It was found that the Turboneb and CR 60, when coupled with either Microneb III or System 22 Acorn, were suitable for the <b>nebulisation</b> of all three antibiotics.

40|$|The {{preparation}} of Chitosan (CHT) -coated liposomes and their applicability as a carrier for delivery of drugs to the lungs by <b>nebulisation</b> was investigated. Empty SUV (small unilamellar) liposomes were initially prepared (with different lipid compositions) and coated with CHT by dropwise addition of CHT solution in the liposome dispersion. CHT-coating efficiency was calculated after separation of coated/non-coated liposomes by centrifugation, and measurement of lipid in each fraction. After establishing the best conditions for CHT-coating (concentration of CHT in the solution), RIF-loaded CHT-coated liposomes,with different lipid compositions (negatively charged and non-charged) were constructed, and their encapsulation efficiency (EE) and <b>nebulisation</b> efficiency (NE%) /stability (NER%) were evaluated. Charged liposomes (containing phosphatidylglycerol [PG]) can be coated with CHT better compared to non-charged ones. The EE of CHT-coated liposomes (that contain PG) is slightly increased while their stability after <b>nebulisation</b> is significantly increased (NER%). Mucoadhesive properties of CHT-coated liposomes were substantially better (compared to non-coated ones) while the toxicity of liposomal RIF towards A 549 epithelial cells was lower compared to free drug {{for all the}} types of vesicles evaluated, and especially the CHT-coated ones. Thereby, it is concluded that CHT-coated liposomes have advantages (compared to non-coated) when the delivery of drugs to the lungs by <b>nebulisation</b> is considered. (C) 2009 Elsevier B. V.

The aerosol output, droplet size, and <b>nebulisation</b> time were assessed for four common brands of jet nebuliser (Bird, DeVilbiss, Inspiron, and Upmist) used to nebulise 2 ml (80 mg) and 4 ml (160 mg) of gentamicin solution (Garamycin, Kirby-Warrick) at four compressed gas flow rates (6, 8, 10, and 12 1. min- 1). There were considerable variations between the nebulisers, DeVilbiss and Upmist being most efficient in the release of respirable (less than 5 micron diameter) droplets. Droplet size and <b>nebulisation</b> time were inversely proportional to gas flow rate. Aerosol output and <b>nebulisation</b> time were increased by raising the volume fill from 2 to 4 ml, although <b>nebulisation</b> time could still be restricted to 12 minutes or less with DeVilbiss and Upmist at 12 1. min- 1.

Recently, rapid fluctuations of haemodynamics and cerebral perfusion following surfactant instillation have beer, described and an {{association with the}} development of intraventricular haemorrhage has been proposed. Therefore, alternative methods of surfactant therapy that reduce the effects on cerebral perfusion have to be explored. Does instillation of surfactant influence blood pressure and cerebral blood flow in rabbits with severe respiratory failure?

Interventions: Surfactant (Alveofact, 100 mg/kg body weight) was nebulised using the MiniNEB nebuliser, or instilled, in 12 rabbits with severe respiratory failure induced by lung lavage. Assessed were blood gasses, mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) and cerebral blood flow over the left carotid artery, using ultrasonic transit-time flow probes. Results: Partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood increased quickly after instillation, from 8. 7 +/- 1. 3 to 24. 9 +/- 6. 4 kPa after 15 min, and increased gradually during <b>nebulisation</b> from 8. 0 +/- 0. 5 to 24. 5 +/- 4. 6 after 120 min.

40|$|BACKGROUND [...] Several {{factors have}} been {{identified}} which improve nebulised aerosol delivery in vitro. One {{of these is the}} addition of a spacer to the ventilator circuit which improves aerosol delivery from a jet nebuliser to a model lung by approximately 30 %. The current study was designed to demonstrate whether similar improvements could be demonstrated in vivo. METHODS [...] Ten patients (seven men) were studied during mechanical ventilation (Siemens Servo 900 C) after open heart surgery. Aerosol was delivered using a Siemens Servo 945 nebuliser system (high setting) driving a System 22 Acorn jet nebuliser (Medic-Aid) containing 3 ml technetium- 99 m labelled human serum albumin (99 mTc-HSA (50 micrograms); activity in the first <b>nebulisation,</b> 90 MBq; in the second <b>nebulisation,</b> 185 MBq). Central and peripheral lung aerosol deposition and the time to complete deposition were measured using a gamma camera and compared when the nebuliser was connected to the inspiratory limb using a simple T-piece or a 600 ml spacer. RESULTS [...] The addition of the spacer increased total lung deposition (mean (SD) percentage initial nebuliser activity) from 2. 2 (0. 7) % to 3 (0. 8) %. There was no difference in the time required to complete <b>nebulisation</b> (18. 2 min v 18. 3 min respectively for T-piece and spacer) or in the retention of activity in the nebuliser (46. 2 % v 47. 1 % respectively).

The specific settings were: a volume controlled mode with a tidal volume < 8  ml/kg, respiratory rate at 12 cycles/min, I/E: 1 / 1 and an end inspiratory break > 20  %.|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: Naked plasmid DNA (pDNA) is a {{potential}} gene transfer agent for lung gene therapies but cannot be aerosolised without degradation using conventional <b>nebulisation</b> devices. This study investigated the viability of an alternative <b>nebulisation</b> technique, electrohydrodynamic (EHD) comminution for the aerosol delivery of naked DNA in vivo. METHODS: Naked pDNA was aerosolised using jet and ultrasonic nebulisers, and by EHD comminution. Degradation associated with the aerosolisation process was investigated using gel electrophoresis and by transfection studies in cell culture. Optimised formulations for EHD aerosolisation of pDNA were developed and in vivo deposition and reporter gene expression were investigated in mice. RESULTS: Unlike conventional <b>nebulisation</b> devices, EHD comminution of plasmids up to 15 kb in size resulted in no detectable pDNA degradation. EHD formulations containing up to 1 mg/ml pDNA were developed and shown to produce monodisperse aerosols suitable for targeted lung delivery in humans. Aerosolisation studies in vivo demonstrated detectable levels of pDNA deposition and measurable luciferase reporter gene expression in the lungs of exposed mice. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates {{for the first time}} that respirable aerosols of naked pDNA can be generated without plasmid degradation and that EHD comminution is an appropriate technique for the aerosolisation of delicate gene transfer agents...|$|E
40|$|Objective: Surfactant <b>nebulisation</b> is a {{promising}} alternative to surfactant instillation in newborns with the respiratory distress syndrome. Although less surfactant is {{deposited in the}} lung, it improves gas exchange, probably due to a superior distribution. We hypothesize that a more uniform distribution of nebulised surfactant results in a more uniform pulmonary blood flow and consequently a more efficient gas exchange. We asked whether the pulmonary blood flow changes after surfactant replacement, {{and to what extent}} pulmonary blood flow is influenced by the amount of surfactant deposition. Furthermore, we investigated whether sufficient nebulised surfactant is deposited in the lungs to achieve a sustained improvement in lung function, Interventions: Surfactant was nebulised or instilled, or saline was nebulised, in 18 lung-lavaged rabbits. After 2 h the rabbits were weaned from mechanical ventilation to continuous positive airway pressure: 40 % oxygen. We measured blood gasses, dynamic lung compliance, surfactant distribution using 99 m technetium nanocoll label, and the pulmonary blood flow distribution, using microspheres. Results: Partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood and lung compliance were significantly higher after surfacfant <b>nebulisation</b> than after saline <b>nebulisation.</b> Surfactant instillation gave a superior effect with respect to these variables, Nebulised surfactant was distributed more uniformly over the lungs than instilled surfactant. Although pulmonary blood flow changed over time, it remained uniformly distributed following both modes of surfactant treatment, Surfactant deposition was neither strongly related to pulmonary blood now nor strongly related to the change in blood flow. Conclusions: Although nebulised surfactant is uniformly distributed, we can provide no evidence that: this results in a more uniform pulmonary blood flow distribution, Therefore, other than a superior surfactant distribution, no additional reason tvas found for the efficient gas exchange after <b>nebulisation...</b>|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Rates {{of fresh}} gas flow (FGF) {{commonly}} used when continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is delivered by face mask theoretically reduce the delivery {{and availability of}} therapeutic aerosols. As it may be hazardous for patients with acute respiratory failure to interrupt mask CPAP, the effects of CPAP on aerosol kinetics and bronchodilator efficacy were investigated. METHOD: The effect of CPAP at 10 cm H 2 O at a FGF rate of 50 l/min on the delivery of technetium labelled aerosol generated from a readily available jet nebuliser was measured using a bench model of spontaneous respiration. In a separate clinical study the bronchodilator responses to incremental doses of nebulised salbutamol were measured in nine stable asthmatic subjects in a random sequence of conventional <b>nebulisation</b> (control) or <b>nebulisation</b> whilst receiving CPAP via a tight fitting face mask. Each patient acted as {{his or her own}} control. RESULTS: CPAP significantly reduced total aerosol delivery to the face mask from 6. 85 (1. 52) % to 1. 3 (0. 37) % of the initial nebuliser charge. In the clinical study a significant bronchodilator response to nebulised salbutamol was seen during both conventional <b>nebulisation</b> and <b>nebulisation</b> whilst receiving CPAP by face mask. The shape of the dose-response curves and the magnitude of the total increase in the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) was identical for CPAP and control conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Despite a reduction in aerosol presented to the proximal airway, the bronchodilator response to inhaled beta 2 agonists in stable asthmatic subjects was not affected when CPAP was delivered by face mask. Despite a high rate of FGF, nebulised beta 2 agonists are effective when administered in conjunction with CPAP delivered by face mask. ...|$|E

40|$|Inhaled Colistimethate sodium (CMS) {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} to be efficacious {{in the treatment of}} recurrent bacterial infections of the lower respiratory tract of CF patients. Results of this study show that a wide range of in-vitro Respirable Doses can result if the same formulation is used with different nebulisers and that eFlow ® rapid can deliver an approximate two fold in-vitro respirable dose compared to other nebuliser systems. This difference needs to be taken into account, particularly with the delivery of antibiotics, where a low dose may be less efficacious and lead to resistance formation against the applied drug. The in-vitro respirable dose can be used as an efficacy indicator and the <b>nebulisation</b> time as a compliance indicator. A shorter <b>nebulisation</b> time of a high respirable dose, improves treatment adherence and the probability that patients will inhale the required dose into the lungs...|$|E
