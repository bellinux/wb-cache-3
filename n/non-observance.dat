40|$|When we {{converse}} we constantly fail {{to observe}} the rules of conversation {{in order to simplify}} and make dialogues more effective. The scriptwriters who work with TV shows use <b>non-observances</b> of maxims in order to evoke different feelings from their viewers. The aim of this paper was to investigate how frequently <b>non-observances</b> of maxims occurred in the TV shows Desperate Housewives and That 70 ’s Show. I examined where and why they were used as well as how often flouting was used compared to violations. The base of the study was a drama and a comedy show. Research has shown that the maxim of relevance is most frequently used to create different comical or dramatic situations. The scriptwriters have their characters ignore what is relevant to the situations in order to make them come off as flustered, odd and stupid in humorous situations and as mysterious, cowardly, respectful or bold in dramatic situations. Also research shows that flouting occurs more frequently than violations when it comes to breaking maxims. Violations occur most often with the maxim of quality when the characters lie to mislead in order to direct blame away from him/herself. In Conclusion, this investigation has shown that <b>non-observances</b> of maxims are important for scriptwriters in order to create humorous and dramatic situations in verbal interaction...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} studies {{the types of}} humor appeared in the comedy film FRIENDS, in the episode of “The One With That Could Have Been” {{and its relation to}} Grice’s Maxims. It is conducted to find out the types of humor, which appear in this episode and define whether those humors obey or disobey the Grice’s Maxims as the standard conversational norms. This research deals with a pragmatic approach. It is a descriptive study and it employs a purposive sampling as the sampling technique. The data are all the humor utterances, which are able to arouse laughter from the audiences that have significant relationship with the problem statement. From forty data available, there are thirty data, which will be analyzed since they have the same characteristics with the types of humor used, and the other ten will be excluded from this research. They are classified by using Audrieth’s humor theory and further analyzed by the theory of maxims proposed by Grice. The result of this research reveals that there are eight types of humor which can be found in this episode. They are Banter, Blunder, Chain, Freudian Slip, Irony, Mistaken identity, Relapse and Repartee. Concerning with the maxims, it is found that the humors, which are used in every utterances, tend to disobey {{at least one of the}} maxims. The analysis of the maxims is conducted through the context of situation available in each data. The researcher also found that there are three <b>non-observances</b> of the maxims, which are done by the characters in delivering the humor. They are flouting, violating, and infringing the maxims. The result of this research is expected to provide an additional view and information in the study of humor and its types for the students, lecturer, and other researchers who are interested in the study of humor...|$|R
25|$|Supporters of {{daylight}} saving time and a common time zone in Indiana often claim Indiana must adopt the time-keeping system of the Eastern United States to preserve interstate business with that region. Some believe that Indiana businesses have lost hours of productive time with out-of-state colleagues because the time quirks are too confusing {{to keep track of}} on a daily basis. The confusion caused to outsiders featured prominently in the plot of an episode of The West Wing in which presidential aides unfamiliar with Indiana's <b>non-observance</b> of DST miss their return flight to Washington, D.C., on Air Force One and express consternation with the variances in the state's time measurement.|$|E

2500|$|Members of the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers), as part {{of their}} {{historic}} testimony against times and seasons, do not celebrate or observe Easter or any other Christian holidays, believing instead that [...] "every day is the Lord's day", and that elevation of one day above others suggests that it is acceptable to do un-Christian acts on other days. During the 17th and 18th centuries, Quakers were persecuted for this <b>non-observance</b> of Holy Days.|$|E
2500|$|Some of the {{differences}} that mark Alevis from mainstream Twelver Shias and Sunnis are the use of wine for religious ceremonial functions; <b>non-observance</b> of the five daily Salat prayers and prostrations (they only bow twice {{in the presence of}} their spiritual leader), fixed ritual donation for Zakat, Ramadan, and the Hajj (they consider the pilgrimage to Mecca an external pretense, the real pilgrimage being internal in one's heart); and non-attendance of mosques.

2500|$|Some of the {{differences}} that mark Alevis from mainstream Muslims are the use of cemevi halls rather than mosques; [...] worship ceremonies that feature music and dancing, and where {{both women and men}} participate; [...] <b>non-observance</b> of the five daily salat prayers and prostrations (they only bow twice in the presence of their spiritual leader), Ramadan, and the Hajj (considering true pilgrimage to be internal one). Alevis have some links with Twelver Shia Islam (such as importance of the Ahl al-Bayt, the day of Ashura, the Mourning of Muharram, commemorating Karbala), [...] but do not follow taqlid towards a Marja [...] "source of emulation". Some practices of the Alevis are based on Sufi elements of the Bektashi ...|$|E
2500|$|The harsh {{treatment}} {{he received}} from the Pharisees was due to his having deserted their ranks at such a critical time. Quite in harmony with this supposition are the other sins laid to his charge; namely, that he rode in an ostentatious manner {{through the streets of}} Jerusalem on a Day of Atonement which fell upon a Sabbath, and that he was bold enough to overstep the [...] "teḥum" [...] (the limits of the Sabbath-day journey). Both the Jerusalem and the Babylonian Talmuds agree here, and cite this as proof that Elisha turned from Pharisaism to heresy. It was just such <b>non-observance</b> of customs that excited the anger of Akiva (Sotah 27b). The Jewish Encyclopedia writes that the mention of the [...] "Holy of Holies" [...] in this passage is not an anachronism, as Grätz thinks, for {{while it is true that}} Eliezer and Joshua were present as the geonim par excellence at Elisha's circumcisionwhich must, therefore, have occurred after the death of Johanan ben Zakkai (80)it is also true that the [...] "Holy of Holies" [...] is likewise mentioned in connection with Rabbi Akiva (Makkot, end); indeed, the use of this expression is due to the fact that the Rabbis held holiness to be inherent in the place, not in the building (Yevamot 6b).|$|E
6000|$|... [63] The <b>non-observance</b> of a {{regulation}} of police was always heavily punished by barbarous nations; a slighter punishment was inflicted upon {{the commission of}} crimes. Among the Saxons moat crimes were punished by fine; wandering from the highway without sounding an horn was death. So among the Druids,--to enforce exactness in time at their meetings, he that came last after the time appointed was punished with death.|$|E
60|$|Observation and {{experiment}} upon the phenomena of society soon taught men that, {{in order to}} obtain the advantages of social existence, certain rules must be observed. Morality commenced with society. Society is possible only upon the condition that the members of it shall surrender more or less of their individual freedom of action. In primitive societies, individual selfishness is a centrifugal force of such intensity that it is constantly bringing the social organisation to the verge of destruction. Hence the prominence of the positive rules of obedience to the elders; of standing by the family or the tribe in all emergencies; of fulfilling the religious rites, <b>non-observance</b> of which is conceived to damage it with the supernatural powers, belief in whose existence is one of the earliest products of human thought; and of the negative rules which restrain each from meddling with the life or property of another.|$|E
6000|$|Many of {{the absurd}} {{practices}} which have been deemed to possess medicinal efficacy, have been indebted for their reputation to <b>non-observance</b> of some accompanying circumstance which was the real agent in the cures ascribed to them. Thus, of the sympathetic powder of Sir Kenelm Digby: “Whenever any wound had been inflicted, this powder {{was applied to the}} weapon that had inflicted it, which was, moreover, covered with ointment, and dressed {{two or three times a}} day. The wound itself, in the mean time, was directed to be brought together, and carefully bound up with clean linen rags, but, above all, to be let alone for seven days, at the end of which period the bandages were removed, when the wound was generally found perfectly united. The triumph of the cure was decreed to the mysterious agency of the sympathetic powder which had been so assiduously applied to the weapon, whereas it is hardly necessary to observe that the promptness of the cure depended on the total exclusion of air from the wound, and upon the sanative operations of nature not having received any disturbance from the officious interference of art. The result, beyond all doubt, furnished the first hint which led surgeons to the improved practice of healing wounds by what is technically called the first intention.”(251) “In all records,” adds Dr. Paris, of “extraordinary cures performed by mysterious agents, there is a great desire to conceal the remedies and other curative means which were simultaneously administered with them; thus Oribasius commends in high terms a necklace of Pæony root for the cure of epilepsy; but we learn that he always took care to accompany its use with copious evacuations, although he assigns to them no share of credit in the cure. In later times we have a good specimen of this species of deception, presented to us in a work on scrofula by Mr. Morley, written, as we are informed, for the sole purpose of restoring the much-injured character and use of the Vervain; in which the author directs the root of this plant to be tied with a yard of white satin ribbon around the neck, where it is to remain until the patient is cured; but mark—during this interval he calls to his aid the most active medicines in the materia medica.”(252) ...|$|E
