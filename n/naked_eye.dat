5|$|<b>Naked</b> <b>eye</b> {{observations}} of Venus during daylight hours exist in several anecdotes and records. Astronomer Edmund Halley calculated its maximum <b>naked</b> <b>eye</b> brightness in 1716, when many Londoners were alarmed by its {{appearance in the}} daytime. French emperor Napoleon Bonaparte once witnessed a daytime apparition of the planet while at a reception in Luxembourg. Another historical daytime observation of the planet {{took place during the}} inauguration of the American president Abraham Lincoln in Washington, D.C., on 4 March 1865. Although <b>naked</b> <b>eye</b> visibility of Venus phases is disputed, records exist of {{observations of}} its crescent.|$|E
5|$|Chinese astronomical records {{report that}} in 365 BC, Gan De {{detected}} {{what appears to}} have been a moon of Jupiter, probably Ganymede, with the <b>naked</b> <b>eye.</b> However, Gan De reported the color of the companion as reddish, which is puzzling since the moons are too faint for their color to be perceived with the <b>naked</b> <b>eye.</b> Shi Shen and Gan De together made fairly accurate observations of the five major planets.|$|E

60|$|Away on {{the western}} rim, where we could look down upon a long rugged iron-gray ridge of mountain, our guide using the glass, found two big stags. We all had our fill of looking. I could see them plainly with <b>naked</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|R

60|$|It took Carley a {{full hour}} of slow body-bending labor to climb to the summit of that hill. High, steep, and rugged, it {{resisted}} ascension. But at last she surmounted it and sat alone on the heights, with <b>naked</b> <b>eyes,</b> and an unconscious prayer on her lips.|$|R
3000|$|Sheet Erosion: It is {{a common}} problem {{resulting}} from loss of topsoil. The soil particles are removed from the whole soil surface on a fairly uniform basis {{in the form of}} thin layers. The severity of the problem is often difficult to visualize with <b>naked</b> <b>eyes</b> in the field.|$|R
25|$|Most {{inclusions}} {{present in}} gem-quality diamonds do {{not affect the}} diamonds' performance or structural integrity and are not visible to the <b>naked</b> <b>eyes.</b> However, large clouds can affect a diamond's ability to transmit and scatter light. Large cracks close to or breaking the surface may reduce a diamond's resistance to fracture.|$|R

5|$|As {{seen from}} Earth, Kepler-4 has an {{apparent}} magnitude of 12.7. It is, as a result, not visible with the <b>naked</b> <b>eye.</b>|$|E
5|$|At a {{distance}} of 613 parsecs, Kepler-11d has an apparent magnitude of 14.2. It is, thus, not visible with the <b>naked</b> <b>eye.</b>|$|E
60|$|The rangers rode {{on and the}} {{escarpment}} {{began to}} loom. The desert floor inclined perceptibly upward. When Gale got an unobstructed view of {{the slope of the}} escarpment he located the raiders and horses. In another hour's travel the rangers could see with <b>naked</b> <b>eyes</b> a long, faint moving streak of black and white dots.|$|R
5000|$|Gore had {{no formal}} {{training}} in astronomy, and began to study the sky while working in India. While there, he relied on his <b>naked</b> <b>eyes,</b> binoculars, a three-inch telescope and a ten centimeter telescope on an equatorial mount. [...] His first book [...] "Southern Stellar Objects for Small Telescopes" [...] was published in India in 1877.|$|R
40|$|A simple {{colorimetric}} method with high sensitivity and selectivity {{was developed for}} sensing of nitrite as low as 4. 0 mu M by <b>naked</b> <b>eyes,</b> {{which is based on}} etching of gold nanorods accompanied by shape changes in aspect ratios (length/width) and a visible color change from bluish green to red and then to colorless with the increase of nitrite...|$|R
5|$|Diamonds may be etched by laser with marks {{invisible}} to the <b>naked</b> <b>eye.</b> Lazare Kaplan, a US-based company, developed this method. However, whatever is marked on a diamond can readily be removed.|$|E
5|$|HAT-P-33 has an {{apparent}} magnitude of 11.89. It cannot {{be seen from}} Earth with the <b>naked</b> <b>eye</b> {{because it is so}} dim.|$|E
5|$|Kepler-10 has an {{apparent}} magnitude of 11.2, {{which means that}} the star is invisible to the <b>naked</b> <b>eye</b> from the perspective of an observer on Earth.|$|E
50|$|The {{phases of}} the planet Venus are the {{different}} variations of lighting seen on the planet's surface, similar to lunar phases. The first recorded observations of them were telescopic observations by Galileo Galilei in 1610. Although the extreme crescent phase of Venus has been observed with the <b>naked</b> <b>eyes,</b> there are no indisputable historical pre-telescopic records of it being observed.|$|R
40|$|Eu-doped BaTiO 3 xerogel {{thin films}} of pseudo-cubic {{perovskite}} phase were successfully fabricated on MgO substrates {{by using a}} high concentration sol-gel process, in which a gel-aging process on substrate (GAPS) was employed. Strong photoluminescence in the xerogels is visible to the <b>naked</b> <b>eyes</b> under UV excitation at room temperature. Influences of europium concentration, hydrolysis and aging conditions on the photoluminescence were investigated quantitatively...|$|R

40|$|We {{report an}} ultrasensitive and {{colorimetric}} assay for Cu(II) via enzymatic amplification strategy. The enzymatic activity of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) is strongly inhibited by Cu(I), {{which can be}} used indirectly to assay Cu(II). The limit of detection (LOD) is 0. 37 nM, and the detection of 20 nM Cu(II) in solution can be achieved with <b>naked</b> <b>eyes.</b> This assay can be used to construct a colorimetric logic gate...|$|R
50|$|The aashram was {{established}} by Param Pujya Dada Gurudev Sacchidananda Maharaj. This aashram lies near the Mansarovar lake and the Kailash. Siddha yogis and sanyasis are meditating in this place for thousands of years. Like many mystical places mentioned in different religions this place can't be seen with <b>naked</b> <b>eyes,</b> it's an experience and only through the path of meditation and spiritual awareness we can experience this place.|$|R
40|$|A novel {{class of}} organic {{nanoparticles}} as biolabels that can generate an instant visible signal {{was applied to}} immunodipsticks. A new principle for signal generation based on hydrolysis of colourless signal precursor molecules to produce coloured signal molecules followed by signal precipitation and localization was demonstrated. The nanoparticle biolabels were applied to sandwich immunoassays {{for the detection of}} mouse immunoglobulin G (M IgG). In the presence of M IgG, a nanoparticle-immunocomplex was formed and bound on the test zone immobilized with goat anti M IgG (Gt Î± M IgG). A blue line was developed on the test zone upon the addition of a signal developing reagent. An optical signal could be simply assessed using <b>naked</b> <b>eyes</b> or quantified using a reading device. The lowest visible signal that could be observed using <b>naked</b> <b>eyes</b> was found to be 1. 25 Î¼gL- 1 M IgG. The nanoparticle biolabel also showed a better sensitivity (signal-to-noise ratio) compared with the conventional colloidal gold biolabel. This novel class of organic nanoparticles offers an alternative biolabel system for the development of point-of-care immunodipsticks. Â© 2010 Elsevier B. V...|$|R
