In 1115, however, he refused to consecrate Bernard as Bishop of St David's in the royal chapel, although Robert of Meulan, the king's chief counsellor, advocated that the consecration must {{take place in the}} royal chapel according to ancient custom. The king did not insist and Ralph won the confrontation. He was also involved in ecclesiastical affairs in Normanday, as he attended the provincial synod, or Council of Rouen, held in 1118.|$|E
5|$|Graffham was {{suggested}} and planned by the London Controlling Section (LCS) {{with the aim}} of convincing the Swedish government that the Allies intended to invade Norway, in support of Operation Fortitude North. During the war Sweden maintained a <b>neutral</b> <b>position,</b> and had relations with both Axis and the Allied nations. It was therefore assumed that if Sweden believed in an imminent threat to Norway this would be passed on to German intelligence. Graffham was envisioned as an extension of existing pressure the Allies were placing on Sweden to end their neutral stance. By increasing this pressure the head of the LCS, Colonel John Bevan, hoped to further convince the Germans that Sweden was preparing to join the Allied nations.|$|E
5|$|The {{rules of}} {{baseball}} {{require that the}} official scorer view the game only from the press box, for two basic reasons. First, this ensures that every scorer has nearly the same perspective of the game. One of the intentions of this rule is to improve consistency in scorekeeping decisions between different official scorers working on different games at the same stadium, and between scorers in different stadiums. Second, the press box is the most <b>neutral</b> <b>position</b> within the stadium. Seated in the press box, the official scorer is surrounded by writers and broadcasters who are ostensibly neutral, and the scorer {{is less likely to}} be unduly influenced by the players, the coaches, and the crowd.|$|E
40|$|Magnetic {{resonance}} imaging (MRI) {{was used to}} study shape, area, and volume changes of KFP between ankle plantarflexion and <b>neutral</b> <b>positions.</b> Although area in the saggital plane appeared to decrease on average by 10 % (SD = 2. 4 %) between ankle plantarflexion and <b>neutral</b> <b>positions,</b> no obvious volume changes were detected as the area of KFP in the transverse plane increased from ankle plantarflexion to <b>neutral</b> <b>positions</b> by approximately 10. 2 % (SD = 2. 14 %), which indicates that KFP is a non-compressible tissue in-vivo. This, {{in addition to the}} existence of fibrosis in PW's tip, support hypotheses that PW can assist in load bearing within the AT enthesis organ. AT bends were observed in this study using US scanning, and were typically found when the ankle was flexed passively or actively against low loads (0 - 1 kg). AT kinds were found typically below the KFP anchorage to AT and only momentarily (max of 0. 2 s), suggesting KFP can reduce AT kinking during flexion.

It was therefore assumed that if Sweden believed in an imminent threat to Norway this would be passed on to German intelligence.

5|$|The game {{features}} monaural {{sound and}} pixel graphics on a 19inch CRT monitor. The initial concept was conceived by John Kotlarik, who aimed {{to create a}} non-violent game. Inspired by Pac-Man, he envisioned similar gameplay in an open playing field {{rather than in a}} maze. Python Anghelo furthered the concept by creating artwork and a scenario. Kotlarik designed the protagonist to have fluid movement like it was traveling on a slick surface. The control scheme allows the digital input to operate similar to an analogue one. He programmed the bubble to accelerate in the direction the joystick is held. Once the joystick returns to its <b>neutral</b> <b>position,</b> the bubble will coast as the velocity slowly decreases. Anghelo designed the artwork for the wooden cabinets as well as a new cylindrical, plastic cabinet. Gary Berge, a mechanical engineer, created the new cabinets with a rotational molding process.|$|E
5|$|As {{the crew}} began {{to prepare for}} arrival at Sioux City, they {{questioned}} whether they should deploy the landing gear or belly-land the aircraft with the gear retracted. They decided that having the landing gear down would provide some shock absorption on impact. The complete hydraulic failure left the landing gear lowering mechanism inoperative. Two options were available to the flight crew. The DC-10 is designed such that if hydraulic pressure to the landing gear is lost, the gear will fall down slightly and rest on the landing gear doors. Placing the regular landing gear handle in the down position will unlock the doors mechanically, and the doors and landing gear will then fall down into place and lock due to gravity. An alternative system is also available using a lever in the cockpit floor to cause the landing gear to fall into position. This lever has {{the added benefit of}} unlocking the outboard ailerons, which are not used in high-speed flight and are locked in a <b>neutral</b> <b>position.</b> The crew hoped that there might be some trapped hydraulic fluid in the outboard ailerons and that they might regain some use of flight controls by unlocking them. They elected to extend the gear with the alternative system. Although the gear deployed successfully, there was no change in the controllability of the aircraft.|$|E

Certain actions, such as {{stopping}} to help injured citizens or killing them to restore Cole's health, {{will affect the}} Karma level in either direction. Normal story missions may also alter the Karma level. During the game the player will encounter Karma moments, the Karma moments are delivered with 3D cutscenes and character-driven dialogue, the action pauses and the player has two actions that can be taken, always a Good and Evil option. There are also Good and Evil side missions in the game as well as random events which provide Karma decisions. Completion of Karma awarding missions helps gain access to unique powers based on the Karma level. The player is not locked into choosing either Karma path, and may opt to play towards one extreme and later switch to the other mid-game. Karma also influences the way that citizens view Cole in addition to altering Cole's appearance and {{certain aspects of the}} game's story. Citizens may throw rocks at and turn on Cole if he has Evil Karma or take pictures of and compliment Cole if he has Good Karma.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{static bending}} model of microcantilever with {{monolayer}} molecules {{has been established}} based on energy method, in which the change in <b>neutral</b> layer <b>position</b> caused by adsorption-induced stress is introduced. On this basis, we have analyzed {{the relationship between the}} bending curvature radius of a microcantilever with its thickness, Young’s modulus and molecule-molecule distance of adsorbed molecules when it is adsorbed with monolayer water molecules. Additionally, we have investigated the effect of change in <b>neutral</b> layer <b>position</b> on the static behavior of microcantilever sensors. The results show that 1) the bending curvature radius of microcantilever is the linear, quadratic and eight approximation function of its Young’s modulus, thickness and distance of adsorbed molecules, respectively; 2) the predicted error of bending curvature radius caused by the change in <b>neutral</b> layer <b>position</b> slightly increases with decreasing Young’s modulus and thickness, whereas the effect of distance between adsorbed molecules on the error is significant; 3) the change in <b>neutral</b> layer <b>position</b> can cause a significant effect on the sensitivity and surface strain of the microcantilever. 1.

40|$|Our {{choice of}} the duplex {{criteria}} of a greater than 50 % increase or decrease in peak systolic (PS) velocity between the <b>neutral</b> head <b>position</b> and contralateral rotation position was based on Haynes (2000) study in which he suggests marked changes in PS velocity could be considered abnormal (his 2000 study reported decreases between 35 % and 68 %) and Freed's et al.

In our study the average PS values in the <b>neutral</b> head <b>position</b> for {{the left and right}} vertebral arteries were 33. 6 and 35. 16 cm/s respectively and we did not observe the high values which the authors suggested may have made a 50 % change less significant.
