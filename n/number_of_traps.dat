50|$|CPUE has {{a number}} of {{advantages}} over other methods of measuring abundance. It does not interfere with routine harvesting operations, and data are easily collected. The data are also easy to analyse, even for non-specialists, in contrast to methods based on transects.

40|$|The advent <b>of</b> {{microfabricated}} ion <b>traps</b> for {{the quantum}} information community has allowed research groups to build traps that incorporate an unprecedented <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>trapping</b> zones.

40|$|We {{report on}} a simple {{anisotropic}} magneto-optical trap for neutral atoms that produces a large sample of cold atoms confined in a cylindrically-shaped volume with a high aspect ratio (100 : 1). Due to the large <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>trapped</b> atoms, the laser beams that propagate along the optically thick axis <b>of</b> the <b>trap</b> to cool the atoms are substantially attenuated.
