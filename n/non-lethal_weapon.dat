25|$|In {{respect to}} the other <b>non-lethal</b> <b>weapon</b> effects from an IND detonated {{on or near the}} surface, the detonation's blast wave would likely produce a {{momentary}} electric grid blackout due to the loss of a large portion of a city's electrical equipment drawing power/electrical load, while the electromagnetic pulse(EMP) from a surface/ground-burst explosion would cause little damage outside the blast area, so cell phone towers that survive the blast should be capable of carrying communications. Although if communications during the 9/11 attacks or after a major hurricane are anything to go by, and the cell phone network towers survive, the service would be overloaded(a Mass call event) and thereby made useless soon after; however, if prior arrangements between the cell network and emergency responders are made to give them priority and bar access to all other individuals, then it may be an effective service. However, as Civil defense(CD) shelters, as depicted in the film, were stocked for such an eventuality, they contained amongst other things, at least one CDV-715 radiation survey meter and a CD emergency radio receiver which would respectively be used to facilitate a safe delayed evacuation, regardless of outside help and if communications continued, inform them of the outside situation as it developed.|$|E

A {{couple of years ago}} the Swedish Armed Forces had no <b>non-lethal</b> <b>weapons,</b> but today the Swedish soldier has a number of tools to choose from. The {{purpose of this paper is}} for the reader to get a presentation of which <b>non-lethal</b> <b>weapons</b> are used today by the Swedish Armed Forces and a sample of what <b>non-lethal</b> <b>weapons</b> are out on the market today. My main question is which <b>non-lethal</b> <b>weapons</b> do the Swedish Armed Forces’ miss in their non-lethal capabilities set. I have collected information from a wide selections of sources like reports from the Swedish Defence Research Agency, the Swedish Armed Forces’ own regulations and the Internet. The information is then processed and divided into five chapters: The development of <b>non-lethal</b> <b>weapons,</b> description of technologies, <b>non-lethal</b> <b>weapons</b> in the Swedish Armed Forces, <b>Non-lethal</b> <b>weapons</b> on the market and Results. This paper is limited to handheld, portable and man to man <b>non-lethal</b> <b>weapons,</b> all <b>non-lethal</b> <b>weapons</b> in the Swedish Armed Forces or on the international market are not covered.

"Skunk" [...] is a malodorant, <b>non-lethal</b> <b>weapon</b> {{used for}} crowd control by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) and marketed to militaries and law {{enforcement}} around the world.

The liquid's strong odor is marketed as an improvement over other crowd control weapons (CCWs) such as rubber bullets and tear gas used by the IDF against Palestinian protestors.

50|$|<b>Non-lethal</b> <b>weapons,</b> {{also called}} less-lethal weapons, less-than-lethal weapons, non-deadly weapons, {{compliance}} weapons, or pain-inducing weapons are weapons {{intended to be}} less likely to kill a living target than conventional weapons such as knives and firearms. It is often understood that unintended or incidental casualties are risked wherever force is applied, but <b>non-lethal</b> <b>weapons</b> try to minimise the risk as much as possible. <b>Non-lethal</b> <b>weapons</b> are used in policing and combat situations to limit the escalation of conflict where employment of lethal force is prohibited or undesirable, where rules of engagement require minimum casualties, or where policy restricts the use of conventional force.|$|R
50|$|Recognizing {{the need}} to limit the {{escalation}} of force, {{research and development of}} a range of <b>non-lethal</b> <b>weapons</b> has since been undertaken internationally by governments and weapons manufacturers to fill the need for such <b>weapons.</b> Some <b>non-lethal</b> <b>weapons</b> may provide more effective riot control than firearms, truncheons or bayonets with less risk of loss of life or serious injury. Before the general availability of early military <b>non-lethal</b> <b>weapons</b> in the mid 1990s, war-fighters had few or no casualty-limiting options for the employment of scalable force and were continually at risk whenever lethal force was prohibited during sensitive missions.|$|R

At the same time, a shift to <b>non-lethal</b> <b>weapons</b> increases the frequency of situations in which a person’s use of force is authorized because defenders with <b>non-lethal</b> <b>weapons</b> are freed from the special proportionality requirements that limit the use of deadly force.
