5|$|After awakening, Jon Snow {{is greeted}} by Davos Seaworth and Melisandre. When asked by Davos {{what he can}} remember, Jon says he remembers only his {{assassination}} but <b>nothing</b> <b>from</b> being dead. Melisandre tells Jon that her religion prophesies the return of a heroic prince and suggests that this prince may not be Stannis, as she first thought, but Jon. Jon enters the courtyard {{to meet with the}} wildlings. He meets with and embraces Tormund Giantsbane and Dolorous Edd, Tormund saying the Wildlings think he is a god.|$|E
5|$|Octopuses {{are highly}} intelligent, but {{the extent of}} their {{intelligence}} and learning capability are not well defined. Maze and problem-solving experiments have shown evidence of a memory system that can store both short- and long-term memory. It is not known precisely what contribution learning makes to adult octopus behaviour. Young octopuses learn <b>nothing</b> <b>from</b> their parents, as adults provide no parental care beyond tending to their eggs until the young octopuses hatch.|$|E
5|$|Sydneys {{failure to}} reach Fremantle on 20 November was not {{initially}} cause for concern, as several factors might have delayed the cruiser, {{none of which}} were sufficient reason to break the order to maintain wireless silence. However, {{with no sign of}} the cruiser by 23 November, shore-based wireless stations began transmitting orders for Sydney to break silence and report in. A raft of German survivors was recovered by a British tanker on 24 November, at which point a large-scale air and sea search began. During this search, which lasted until the evening of 29 November, 318 survivors from Kormorans 399 personnel were found, but apart from a carley float and a lifebelt, <b>nothing</b> <b>from</b> Sydney or the 645 aboard was recovered.|$|E
40|$|According to Wittgenstein in the Tractatus, {{contradictions and}} tautologies are not propositions. They convey no information. It is here argued {{that we can}} reason without using contradiction [...] <b>nothing</b> follows <b>from</b> <b>nothing.</b> ((x) (x ϵ R & ~(x ϵ x)) is a contradiction, so we cannot derive from it a false and {{unacceptable}} conclusion; <b>nothing</b> follows <b>from</b> it...|$|R

5|$|On 6 May 1872, Drache was recommissioned {{for service}} as a survey vessel, having had her 21cm gun removed and a deck house erected in its place. From May until 22 October, she {{surveyed}} the eastern coast of Holstein, operating from her base in Kiel. In November, Drache, Meteor, and the transport ship Rhein searched the eastern Baltic for any merchant ships {{that might have been}} damaged in a heavy storm. On 12 December, Drache returned to Wilhelmshaven, where she was again decommissioned. On 15 April 1874, the vessel was recommissioned for visits to British and Norwegian ports before being decommissioned again on 23 November in Wilhelmshaven. It was planned to send her to Spain in response to attacks on German nationals there, but the plan came to <b>nothing.</b> <b>From</b> 1875 to 1880, Drache made visits to Britain and Norway in the summer months. During this period, she underwent several additional modifications. In 1876, her masts were removed to improve her stability, and her remaining two guns were removed in 1878. Over the winter of 18791880, new boilers were installed, along with a barquentine sailing rig.|$|E
5|$|Written by Christopher Priest, the {{opportunity}} to write this four-part story was offered to Priest after his previous script, Sealed Orders, had been cancelled. The scene breakdown was commissioned on 5 December 1980 and the scripts on 6 February 1981. Priest's story idea dealt with the 'secret' of what actually powered the TARDIS, in this case fear. Somewhere hidden inside the TARDIS was the one being the Doctor feared above all others, and the psychic {{tension between the two}} of them produced the energy to move through space and time. The story involved the Doctor having to confront and ultimately defeat this fear, and was designed to write out the character of Adric. After hearing <b>nothing</b> <b>from</b> the production office with regard to his completed scripts or his payment for them, Priest made contact with John Nathan-Turner. He was told that the scripts were unusable and that he would not be paid. After a bitter dispute Priest was paid and both Nathan-Turner and Eric Saward forced to pen a letter of apology over their treatment of the writer. The script was replaced by Saward's script Earthshock.|$|E

6000|$|Yours to Secretary of War [received] {{asking for}} {{something}} cheering. We have <b>nothing</b> bad <b>from</b> anywhere. I {{have just seen}} a despatch of Grant, of 11 P.M., May 23, on the North Anna and partly across it, which ends as follows: [...] "Everything looks exceedingly favorable for us." [...] We have <b>nothing</b> later <b>from</b> him.|$|R
25|$|Although {{both sides}} lost heavily {{in men and}} material, and neither gained a decisive {{military}} advantage, India had the better of the war. New Delhi achieved its basic goal of thwarting Pakistan's attempt to seize Kashmir by force. Pakistan gained <b>nothing</b> <b>from</b> a conflict which it had instigated.|$|E
25|$|After hearing <b>nothing</b> <b>from</b> {{his various}} {{applications}} to the BBC, Harper {{wrote to his}} former director Shaun Sutton, who was by now Head of Drama Serials at the BBC. With Sutton's assistance Harper gained an interview for the position of floor assistant, in which role he began working at BBC Television Centre in London in September 1966.|$|E
25|$|During {{the period}} of Dutch {{colonization}} in South Africa, a distinctive type of architecture, known as Cape Dutch architecture, was developed. These style of architecture {{can be found in}} historical towns such as Stellenbosch, Swellendam, Tulbagh and Graaff-Reinet. In the former Dutch capital of Cape Town, nearly <b>nothing</b> <b>from</b> the VOC era have survived except the Castle of Good Hope.|$|E

25|$|Les Shannon was {{appointed}} as Mortensen's successor on 1 May 1969, and the Liverpudlian succeeded {{in taking the}} club back to the First Division in his first season. Shannon brought in players such as Mickey Burns, who had cost <b>nothing</b> <b>from</b> Skelmersdale United, Dave Hatton and the veteran Fred Pickering, with Harry Thomson becoming the latest in Blackpool's line of Scottish goalkeepers.|$|E
25|$|We {{are clear}} {{that not only}} does a stock {{dividend}} really take <b>nothing</b> <b>from</b> {{the property of the}} corporation and add nothing to that of the shareholder, but that the antecedent accumulation of profits evidenced thereby, while indicating that the shareholder is richer because of an increase of his capital, at the same time shows he has not realized or received any income in the transaction.|$|E
25|$|The army, however, did {{not hold}} a unified opinion about the Febreristas. Several {{attempted}} coups served to remind President Félix Paiva (the former dean {{of law at the}} National University) that although the February Revolution was out of power, it was far from dead. People who suspected that the Liberals had learned <b>nothing</b> <b>from</b> their term out of office soon had proof: a peace treaty signed with Bolivia on July 21, 1938, fixed the final boundaries behind the Paraguayan battle lines.|$|E

25|$|Another {{claim was}} {{put forth by}} a young boy who stated {{that he had been}} hit by a small (~3-gram) stone of the Mbale {{meteorite}} fall from Uganda, and who stood to gain <b>nothing</b> <b>from</b> this assertion. The stone reportedly fell through banana leaves before striking the boy on the head, causing little to no pain, as it was small enough to have been slowed by both friction with the atmosphere as well as that with banana leaves, before striking the boy.|$|E
25|$|In {{the report}} of the Air Court of Inquiry into the 1948 crash of the DC-3 Lutana, Mr Justice William Simpson was {{strongly}} critical of the Department of Civil Aviation's air navigation policy. The Minister, Mr Drakeford, vigorously defended his Department against Justice Simpson's criticism. Justice Simpson was attacked in the Senate. An editorial in the Courier-Mail attacked the secrecy surrounding the Queensland Airlines accident and claimed that by not publishing his Department's report the Minister, Mr Drakeford, showed he had learned <b>nothing</b> <b>from</b> Justice Simpson's inquiry into the crash of the Lutana.|$|E
25|$|Middlesbrough were on top {{for much}} of the game at Sunderland's Stadium of Light, but {{ultimately}} came away with <b>nothing</b> <b>from</b> the 2–0 defeat. Mido was set to start, but was injured in the warm-up and was replaced by the initially-benched Alves. Downing and Alves created a host of good chances but none were converted. With sixteen minutes to go before the final whistle, Aliadière was brought down in the penalty area, but Downing sent his penalty kick flying over the bar for his second penalty miss of the season. The visitors were punished for their inability to score when Michael Chopra scored two goals in the final ten minutes.|$|E
50|$|The {{problems}} {{found with}} emergentism are often cited by panpsychists as grounds to reject physicalism. This {{argument can be}} traced back to the Ancient Greek philosopher Parmenides, who argued that ex nihilo nihil fit — <b>nothing</b> comes <b>from</b> <b>nothing</b> and thus the mental cannot arise from the non-mental.|$|R

25|$|When Shirley Sherrod {{addressed}} the Federation of Southern Cooperatives/Land Assistance Fund on August 21, 2010, she {{claimed to have}} been aware of the videos on July 14, 2010; five days before they were posted on Andrew Breitbart's BigGovernment.com website. Sherrod says that she immediately notified the USDA about the videos, saying that they did not convey the entire or accurate story. She heard <b>nothing</b> <b>from</b> the USDA until Monday, July 19, 2010, when she was put on administrative leave and then asked to resign. Released White House emails show the Obama administration was aware of the situation, but {{there was no evidence that}} the dismissal of Sherrod was under orders of the White House.|$|E
25|$|Detention {{could take}} three forms. First, the Gelinder Arrest (“mild detention”) {{of up to}} nine weeks simply {{involved}} locking up the prisoner, but theoretically with no further deprivation. Second was the Mittelarrest, lasting up to three weeks. The prisoner could receive <b>nothing</b> <b>from</b> the outside except 10000 g of potato bread and a supplement {{on the fourth day}} of captivity. Finally, the Strenger Arrest, lasting two weeks, was similar to the Mittelarrest but included light deprivation. If no detention cell was available in the camp, standing at a post was used as punishment, in which case German military regulations specified that prisoners punished with Strenger Arrest must also stand at a post for two hours a day.|$|E
25|$|On 16 September 1725, Ruđer Bošković left Dubrovnik for Rome. He was in {{the care}} of two Jesuit priests who took him to the Society of Jesus, famous for its {{education}} of youth and at that time having some 800 establishments and 200,000 pupils under its care throughout the world. We learn <b>nothing</b> <b>from</b> Bošković himself until the time he entered the novitiate in 1731, but it was the usual practice for novices to spend the first two years not in the Collegium Romanum, but in Sant'Andrea delle Fratte. There, he studied mathematics and physics; and so brilliant was his progress in these sciences that in 1740 he was appointed professor of mathematics in the college.|$|E

50|$|Respighi {{had written}} the ballet La Boutique fantasque for Léonide Massine in 1919, basing it on short piano pieces from Rossini's {{collection}} Péchés de vieillesse (Sins of Old Age). In 1925, he returned to Rossini's music, but not as a ballet, simply as concert music. He again used Sins of Old Age, specifically Quelques riens (Various <b>nothings)</b> <b>from</b> Volume XII, and applied {{what he called a}} trascrizione libera (free transcription) to them.|$|R
