40|$|The present {{work was}} carried out to {{retrieve}} the origin of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) in sourdough. To this purpose, wheat LAB were monitored from ear harvest until {{the first step of}} fermentation for sourdough development. The influence of the geographical area and variety on LAB species/strain composition was also determined. The ears of four Triticum durum varieties (Duilio, Iride, Saragolla and Simeto) were collected from several fields located within the Palermo province (Sicily, Italy) and microbiologically investigated. In order to trace the transfer <b>of</b> <b>LAB</b> during the consecutive steps of manipulation, ears were transformed aseptically and, after threshing, milling and fermentation, samples of kernels, semolinas and doughs, respectively, were analysed. LAB were not found to dominate the microbial communities of the raw materials. In general, kernels harboured lower levels of microorganisms than ears and ears than semolinas. Several samples showing <b>no</b> development <b>of</b> <b>LAB</b> colonies acidified the enrichment broth suggesting the presence <b>of</b> <b>LAB</b> below the detection limit. After fermentation, LAB loads increased consistently for all doughs, reaching levels of 7. 0 – 7. 5 Log CFU/g on M 17. The values of pH (5. 0) and TTA (5. 6 mL NaOH/ 10 g of dough) indicated the occurrence of the acidification process for several doughs. LAB were phenotypically and genotypically differentiated by randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) -PCR into eight groups including 51 strains belonging to the species Lactobacillus brevis, Lactobacillus coryniformis, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactococcus lactis, Lactococcus garvieae, Enterococcus casseliflavus, Enterococcus faecium, Leuconostoc citreum, and Pediococcus pentosaceus. Lactobacilli constituted a minority the LAB community, while lactococci represented more than 50 % <b>of</b> strains. Lower <b>LAB</b> complexity was found on kernels, while a richer biodiversity was observed in semolinas and fermented doughs. For broader microbiota characterisation in doughs before fermentation, the 16 S rRNA gene fragment profiling was conducted on the unfermented doughs using MiSeq Illumina. LAB group was represented by Enterococcus, Lactococcus and members of Leuconostocaceae family whose relative abundances differed according to both geographical area and variety of wheat. The culture-independent approach confirmed that pediococci and lactobacilli constituted low abundance members <b>of</b> the semolina <b>LAB</b> microbiota and that although some strains may pass from wheat ear to fermented doughs, most are likely to come from other sources...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{was carried out}} to investigate the effect of combination of starter, storage time and the interaction between both factors on viability <b>of</b> <b>LAB,</b> acidity and melting time of pro-biotic ice cream. The Design of experiment used was Randomized Completely Block Design (RCBD) with factorial pattern (3 x 3 x 4). The mean differences were tested by Duncan’s Multiple Range Test (DMRT). The first factor was the combination of L casei and B. bifidum (T 1 = 1 : 1, T 2 = 2 : 1 and T 3 = 1 : 2). The second factor was the storage times (10, 20 and 30 days). The {{results showed that the}} combination of starter affected significantly on viability <b>of</b> <b>LAB,</b> and acidity but did not affect on melting time. The storage time affected significantly on viability <b>of</b> <b>LAB,</b> acidity and melting time. The interaction between both factors did not affect on viability, acidity and melting time. The conclusion of this {{research was}} that the combination of l. casei and B. bifidum 1 : 2 had highest viability <b>of</b> <b>LAB</b> on pro-biotic ice cream.

40|$|Several {{lactic acid}} {{bacteria}} (LAB) isolates from the Lactobacillus genera have been applied in food preservation, partly due to their antimicrobial properties. Their application in the control of human pathogens holds promise provided appropriate strains are scientifically chosen and a suitable mode of delivery is utilized. Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a global problem, affecting mainly diabetic patients and women. Many uropathogens are developing resistance to commonly used antibiotics.

The stress physiology <b>of</b> <b>LAB</b> {{has been studied}} in depth for over 2 decades, fueled mostly by the technological implications <b>of</b> <b>LAB</b> robustness in the food industry. Survival <b>of</b> probiotic <b>LAB</b> in the host and the potential relatedness <b>of</b> <b>LAB</b> virulence to their stress resilience have intensified interest in the field. Thus, {{a wealth of information}} concerning stress responses exists today for strains as diverse as starter (e. g., Lactococcus lactis), probiotic (e. g., several Lactobacillus spp.), and pathogenic (e. g., Enterococcus and Streptococcus spp.) LAB. Here we present {{the state of the art}} for LAB stress behavior. We describe the multitude <b>of</b> stresses that <b>LAB</b> are confronted with, and we present the experimental context used to study the stress responses <b>of</b> <b>LAB,</b> focusing on adaptation, habituation, and cross-protection as well as on self-induced multistress resistance in stationary phase, biofilms, and dormancy. We also consider stress responses at the population and single-cell levels. Subsequently, we concentrate on the stress defense mechanisms that have been reported to date, grouping them according to their direct participation in preserving cell energy, defending macromolecules, and protecting the cell envelope. Stress-induced responses <b>of</b> probiotic <b>LAB</b> and commensal/pathogenic LAB are highlighted separately due to the complexity of the peculiar multistress conditions to which these bacteria are subjected in their hosts. Induction of prophages under environmental stresses is then discussed.
