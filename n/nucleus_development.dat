40|$|Ciliates {{have evolved}} highly complex and {{intricately}} controlled pathways {{to ensure the}} precise and complete removal of all genomic sequences not required for vegetative growth. At the same time, they retain a reference copy of all their genetic information for future generations. This chapter describes how different ciliates use RNA-mediated DNA comparison processes to form new somatic nuclei from germline nuclei. While these processes vary in their precise mechanisms, they all use RNA to target genomic DNA sequences—either for retention or elimination. They also all consist {{of more than one}} individual pathway acting cooperatively—the two subsets of small RNAs in Paramecium and the guide RNAs and Piwi-interacting RNAs in Oxytricha—to ensure a strong belt-and-braces approach to consistent and precise somatic <b>nucleus</b> <b>development.</b> Nonetheless, this genome comparison approach to somatic <b>nucleus</b> <b>development</b> provides an elegant method for trans-generational environmental adaptation. Conceptually, it is easy to imagine how somatic changes that occur during vegetative growth could be transferred to meiotic offspring, while an unaltered germline genome is retained. Further research in this area will have far-reaching implications for the trans-generational adaptation of more distantly related eukaryotes, such as humans...|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn the hindbrain, {{generation}} of the facial nucleus involves complex developmental processes {{that will lead to}} the formation of a structure composed of motor neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. The implication of LIF-related cytokines in the development of this nucleus came to light with the analysis of mice mutant for the receptor of these cytokines, LIFRβ, which exhibit a massive loss of facial branchiomotor (fbm) neurons at birth and a severe decrease in GFAP expression, a marker of astrocytes. To uncover the cellular mechanisms regulated by LIFRβ during facial <b>nucleus</b> <b>development,</b> we first analyzed its expression pattern in the hindbrain. lifrβ is first expressed at E 11. 5 in the hindbrain neuroepithelium. The receptor is absent during the migration of fbm post-mitotic neurons but is strongly expressed when fbm neurons have reached rhombomere 6 at E 12. 5, and its expression is maintained until E 18. 5. From the analysis of lifrβ mutant embryos, we established that LIFRβ is necessary for fbm neurons’ identity determination. We also show that LIFRβ is implicated in astrocyte and oligodendrocyte differentiation, specifically within the facial nucleus...|$|E
40|$|Neural {{activity}} is often {{required for the}} final stages of synaptic refinement during brain development. It is thought that learning rules acting at the individual synapse level, which specify how pre- and postsynaptic activity lead to changes in synaptic efficacy, underlie such activity-dependent development. How such rules might function in vivo can be addressed in the retinogeniculate system because the input activity from the retina and its importance in development are both known. In fact, detailed studies of retinal waves have revealed their complex spatiotemporal properties, providing insights into the mechanisms that use such activity to guide development. First of all, the information useful for development is contained in the retinal waves and can be quantified, placing constraints on synaptic learning rules that use this information. Furthermore, knowing the distribution of activity over the entire set of inputs makes it possible to address a necessary component of developmental refinement: rules governing competition between synaptic inputs. In this way, the detailed knowledge of retinal input and lateral geniculate <b>nucleus</b> <b>development</b> provides a unique opportunity to relate the rules of synaptic plasticity directly to their role in development.

40|$|The first {{proposed}} hypothesis about {{the mechanism of}} chloroquine (CQ) action on malaria parasites is DNA intercalation hypothesis which indicates that the site of CQ action is within the nucleus. Later on the interest of research was shifted from nucleus to lysosome due to the report of CQ accumulation within lysosome. The current opinions about CQ action and resistance are mainly {{based on the results}} of more than 30 -year studies on lysosome, which can be used to explain some facts but still remains incomplete and controversial. Based on recently published papers and our related data it is possible that the key CQ target protein may exist in the <b>nucleus.</b> <b>Development</b> of CQ resistance is probably mainly due to the alteration in the CQ target protein or certain mechanism which prevents CQ from reaching its target protein in the nucleus. In conclusion, the key site of CQ action may be in the nucleus though it has not been well explored while CQ action in lysosome which has been well studied may be secondarily important in CQ action and resistance.

40|$|Ecological {{theories}} of facilitation and nucleation are proposed {{as a basis}} for environmental restoration in tropical ecosystems. The main goal {{of this paper is to}} present restoration techniques based on the concept of nucleation, in which small nuclei of vegetation are established within a degraded land. The nucleation techniques (artificial shelters for animals, planting of herbaceous shrub life forms, soil and seed bank translocation, seed rain translocation, soil and seed rain translocation's seedling set, artificial perches, planting of native trees in groups, and ecological stepping-stones with functional groups) promote the landscape connectivity on two flows: inward: receiver connectivity and outward: donor connectivity.

40|$|Mammalian {{spermatogenesis}} comprises three successive phases: mitosis phase, meiosis phase, and spermiogenesis. During spermiogenesis, round spermatid undergoes dramatic morphogenesis to {{give rise}} to mature spermatozoon, including the condensation and elongation of <b>nucleus,</b> <b>development</b> of acrosome, formation of flagellum, and removal of excessive cytoplasm. Although these transformations are well defined at the morphological level, the mechanisms underlying these intricate processes are largely unknown. Here, we report that Iqcg, which was previously characterized {{to be involved in}} a chromosome translocation of human leukemia, is highly expressed in the spermatogenesis of mice and localized to the manchette in developing spermatids. Iqcg knockout causes male infertility, due to severe defects of spermiogenesis and resultant total immobility of spermatozoa. The axoneme in the Iqcg knockout sperm flagellum is disorganized and hardly any typical (" 9 + 2 ") pattern of microtubule arrangement could be found in Iqcg knockout spermatids. Iqcg interacts with calmodulin in a calcium dependent manner in the testis, suggesting that Iqcg may play a role through calcium signaling. Furthermore, cilia structures in the trachea and oviduct, as well as histological appearances of other major tissues, remain unchanged in the Iqcg knockout mice, suggesting that Iqcg is specifically required for spermiogenesis in mammals. These results might also provide new insights into the genetic causes of human infertility...|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanisms}} used by {{the cerebral}} cortex to modulate the cutaneous information at prethalamic level have been scarcely studied. This article reviews experimental evidence leading {{to a better understanding}} of this issue at the level of the cuneate nucleus (Burdach <b>nucleus).</b> <b>Development.</b> The primary afferents and the corticocuneate fibers make synaptic contact with cuneothalamic neurons and with inhibitory interneurons in the middle cuneate nucleus. By stimulating the skin at different places while recording the cuneothalamic intracellular activity in anaesthetized animals with the cortex intact, with the cortex pharmacologically inactivated, or in absence of a cerebral cortex it was possible to ascertain the functional role of the corticocuneate fibers. The primary afferents activated by stimulating a particular zone of the skin induce monosynaptic excitation on a group of cuneothalamic cells at the same time at which inhibit, through intranuclear interneurons, neighboring cuneothalamic cells with unmatched receptive fields. Similarly, the corticocuneate cells receiving information from the stimulated skin further increase the excitation of the cuneothalamic neurons with matched receptive fields while inhibiting others with unmatched fields. The cortex exaggerates an excited center surrounded by an inhibited periphery thus increasing the tactile discrimination both spatially and temporally which is essential for exploratory and manipulative purpose...|$|E
40|$|Microstructure {{can have}} a {{significant}} effect on the materials' resistance to intergranular environment assisted cracking. Certain grain boundaries are susceptible to degradation by stress corrosion while others have high resistance, and it is recognised that increasing the fraction of resistant boundaries has a beneficial effect. A modelling investigation is reported in this work, which focuses on the effect of these boundaries on short crack growth rates in a microstructure corresponding to a sensitised austenitic stainless steel. The model uses a regular representation of the materials' microstructure and a simplified categorisation of grain boundaries as either resistant or susceptible to environment assisted cracking. While the resistant boundaries may fail only after a significant amount of plastic deformation, the rate of failure of the susceptible boundaries is a positive function of the local strain energy density. Results are presented to demonstrate the effect of increased fraction of resistant boundaries on crack propagation rates. Variation of the degree of sensitisation of the susceptible boundaries will have a similar effect. These support the expectation that grain boundary engineering may improve the material's resistance to environment-assisted cracking, with a significant effect on the incubation period for crack <b>nucleus</b> <b>development.</b> © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Proneural factors {{represent}} < 10 transcriptional regulators {{required for}} specifying {{all of the}} different neurons of the mammalian nervous system. The mechanisms by which such {{a small number of}} factors creates this diversity are still unknown. We propose that proteins interacting with proneural factors confer such specificity. To test this hypothesis we isolated proteins that interact with Math 1, a proneural transcription factor essential {{for the establishment of a}} neural progenitor population (rhombic lip) that gives rise to multiple hindbrain structures and identified the E-protein Tcf 4. Interestingly, haploinsufficiency of TCF 4 causes the Pitt–Hopkins mental retardation syndrome, underscoring the important role for this protein in neural development. To investigate the functional relevance of the Math 1 /Tcf 4 interaction in vivo, we studied Tcf 4 −/− mice and found that they have disrupted pontine <b>nucleus</b> <b>development.</b> Surprisingly, this selective deficit occurs without affecting other rhombic lip-derived nuclei, despite expression of Math 1 and Tcf 4 throughout the rhombic lip. Importantly, deletion of any of the other E-protein-encoding genes does not have detectable effects on Math 1 -dependent neurons, suggesting a specialized role for Tcf 4 in distinct neural progenitors. Our findings provide the first in vivo evidence for an exclusive function of dimers formed between a proneural basic helix–loop–helix factor and a specific E-protein, offering insight about the mechanisms underlying transcriptional programs that regulate development of the mammalian nervous system...|$|E
40|$|During postembryonic {{development}} of Caenorhabditis elegans, the heterochronic gene lin- 14 controls {{the timing of}} developmental events in diverse cell types. Three alternative lin- 14 transcripts are predicted to encode isoforms of a novel nuclear protein that differ in their amino-terminal domains. In this paper, we report that the alternative amino-terminal domains of LIN- 14 are dispensable and that a carboxy-terminal region within exons 9 to 13 is necessary and sufficient for in vivo LIN- 14 function. A transgene capable of expressing {{only one of the}} three alternative lin- 14 gene products rescues a lin- 14 null mutation and is developmentally regulated by lin- 4. This shows that the deployment of alternative lin- 14 gene products is not critical for the ability of LIN- 14 to regulate downstream genes in diverse cell types or for the in vivo regulation of LIN- 14 level by lin- 4. The carboxy-terminal region of LIN- 14 contains an unusual expanded nuclear localization domain which is essential for LIN- 14 function. These results support the view that LIN- 14 controls developmental timing in C. elegans by regulating gene expression in the <b>nucleus.</b> <b>Development</b> of multicellular organisms requires the precise spatial and temporal control of developmental events, including cell fate determination and cell division and differentiation.

40|$|BACKGROUND: A {{major event}} in the post-meiotic {{development}} of male germ cells is {{the formation of the}} acrosome. This process can be perturbed in C 57 BL/ 6 mice by administration of the small molecule miglustat (N-butyldeoxynojirimycin, NB-DNJ). The miglustat-treated mice produce morphologically abnormal spermatozoa that lack acrosomes and are poorly motile. In C 57 BL/ 6 mice, miglustat can be used to maintain long-term reversible infertility. In contrast, when miglustat was evaluated in normal men, it did not affect spermatogenesis. To gain more insight into this species difference we have now evaluated the reproductive effects of miglustat in rabbits, in multiple mouse strains and in interstrain hybrid mice. METHODS: Male mice of 18 inbred strains were administered miglustat orally or via miniosmotic pumps. Rabbits were given the compound in their food. Fourth-generation interstrain hybrid mice, bred from C 57 BL/ 6 and FVB/N mice (which differ in their response to miglustat), also received the drug. Data on fertility (natural mating), sperm motility and morphology, acrosome status, and serum drug levels were collected. RESULTS: In rabbits the drug did not induce aberrations of sperm shape or motility, although the serum level of miglustat in rabbits far exceeded the level in C 57 BL/ 6 mice (8. 4 microM and 0. 5 microM, respectively). In some strains of the Swiss and Castle lineages of inbred mice miglustat did not cause infertility, severe morphological sperm aberrations or reduced sperm motility. In these strains miglustat only had milder effects. However, miglustat strongly disturbed acrosome and sperm <b>nucleus</b> <b>development</b> in AKR/J and BALB/c mice and in a number of C 57 BL/ 6 -related strains. The consequences of drug administration in the interstrain hybrid mice were highly variable. Judging by the number of grossly abnormal spermatozoa, these genetically heterogeneous mice displayed a continuous range of intermediate responses, distinct from either of their parental strains. CONCLUSION: The effects of miglustat on spermatogenesis in mice are strain-dependent, while in rabbits the drug is ineffective. Evaluation of interstrain hybrid mice indicated that the sensitivity of spermatogenesis to miglustat is a quantitative trait. These studies pave the way for identifying the genetic factors underlying the strain/species differences in the effect of miglustat...|$|E
