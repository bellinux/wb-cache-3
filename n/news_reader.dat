40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{peculiar}} properties of rhythmic organization, {{which includes the}} description of rhythmic devices and their percentage, basic principles of their arrangement. The study defines reading of pre-written text as a main characteristic of <b>news</b> <b>reader's</b> speech. We used tapes of the popular TV news programs which were broadcasted by the main Russian channels in 2000 as a material for this research. The study describes rhythmic devices of different language levels. Quantitative analysis helped to make the conclusion about the predominance of super-segmental devices in <b>news</b> <b>reader's</b> speech of 2000. For example, lexical rhythmic devices amount to 6 %, syntactic rhythmic devices amount to 8 % {{and the number of}} super-segmental rhythmic devices reaches 86 %. This article characterizes the main principles of super-segmental rhythmic devices arrangement, such as symmetry and proportion. Structural dependence exists in rhythmic organization of <b>news</b> <b>reader's</b> speech. The feature of structural dependence consists in regular reproduction of rhythmic devices in the initial and final parts of information announcement and partial reproduction – in the central part. Semantic, expressive, arranging and composition functions are the basic functions of the rhythm in <b>news</b> <b>reader's</b> speech; moreover, the semantic function which helps to mark certain words important in terms of information, dominates in <b>news</b> <b>reader's</b> speech of 2000. We noticed the dominance of using high degree rhythmically arranged information announcements, which are characterized by using different language level rhythmic devices in more than 50 % of syntagmas of sounding text. Consequently, rhythmic organization of <b>news</b> <b>reader's</b> speech reflects displacing of argumentative way of verbal influence by the suggestive way of verbal influence as a current trend in modern communicatio...|$|R
40|$|The {{electronics}} newspaper {{becomes a}} main source for online <b>news</b> <b>readers.</b> When facing the numerous stories {{of a series}} of events, <b>news</b> <b>readers</b> need some supports in order to review a topic in an efficient way. Besides identifying events and presenting the search results with news titles and keywords the TDT (Topic Detection and Tracking) is used to do, a summarized text to present event evolution is necessary for general <b>news</b> <b>readers</b> to review events under a news topic. This paper proposes a topic retrospection process and implements the SToRe system that identifies various events under a news topic, and composes a summary that <b>news</b> <b>readers</b> can get the sketch of event evolution in the topic. It consists of three main functions: event identification, main storyline construction and storyline-based summarization. The constructed main storyline can remove the irrelevant events and present a main theme. The summarization extracts the representative sentences and takes the main theme as the template to compose summary. The summarization not only provides enough information to comprehend the development of a topic, but also serves as an index to help readers to find more detailed information. A lab experiment is conducted to evaluate the SToRe system in the question-and-answer (Q&A) setting. The experimental results show that the SToRe system enables <b>news</b> <b>readers</b> to effectively and efficiently capture the evolution of a news topic...|$|R

40|$|A {{variety of}} news {{recommender}} systems based on different strategies {{have been proposed}} to provide news personalization services for online <b>news</b> <b>readers.</b> However, little research work has been reported on utilizing the implicit “social” factors (i. e., the potential influential experts in news reading community) among <b>news</b> <b>readers</b> to facilitate <b>news</b> personalization. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of integrating content-based methods, collaborative filtering and information diffusion models by employing probabilistic matrix factorization techniques. We propose PRemiSE, anovelPersonalized news Recommendation framework via implicit Social Experts, in which the opinions of potential influencers on virtual social networks extracted from implicit feedbacks are treated as auxiliary resources for recommendation. Empirical results demonstrate the efficacy and effectiveness of our method, particularly, on handling the socalled cold-start problem...|$|R
