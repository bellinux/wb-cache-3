40|$|The {{objective}} was to evaluate whether removal of <b>neutralising</b> <b>antibodies</b> potentially resensitises a secondary non-responder to botulinum neurotoxin A (BoNT/A). <b>Neutralising</b> <b>antibodies</b> directed against BoNT/A are produced during long term treatment with BoNT/A-hemagglutinin complex in up to 10 % of patients with cervical dystonia. These patients become secondary non-responders. Other serotypes of BoNT are not yet generally available and may also bear the risk of inducing antibody formation. Plasma exchange (PE) (one treatment cycle) and immunoadsorption on a protein A column (IA-PA; three treatment cycles) was employed over 15 months to remove <b>neutralising</b> <b>antibodies</b> from a severely disabled secondary non-responder with cervical dystonia. After plasma exchange or IA-PA, BoNT/A was reinjected. Antibodies were measured with a sensitive functional toxin neutralising test.   Repeated use of plasma exchange and IA-PA depleted <b>neutralising</b> <b>antibodies</b> to below the detection limit and subsequently allowed successful BoNT/A injection into dystonic muscles. No serious side effects were found related to the depletion of IgG.   In conclusion PE or IA-PA performed before BoNT/A readministration may provide an alternative strategy in treating selected secondary non-responders who are severely disabled. ...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{study of}} heterosubtypic {{antibody}} responses directed against influenza A haemagglutinins in human populations {{is an important}} facet of pandemic preparedness. The evaluation of the ability of vaccines to increase heterosubtypic antibody responses to confer broad protection against different influenza subtypes is one approach to this. Classic serological assays, such as haemagglutination inhibition and microneutralisation, have demonstrated low sensitivity {{for the detection of}} cross-neutralising antibodies, especially those directed against epitopes in the haemagglutinin HA 2 stalk region. For this reason {{there is a need for}} new assay formulations that are able to detect and quantify these heterosubtypic antibody responses. Influenza pseudotypes represent safe tools to study the <b>neutralising</b> <b>antibody</b> response since they are replication-defective viruses and they harbour on their envelope only the haemagglutinin that is the major target of this response. Materials and Methods: We have generated a panel of group 2 influenza A pseudotypes (H 3 A/Udorn/ 307 / 1972, H 4 A/duck/Czechoslovakia/ 1956, H 7 A/chicken/Italy/ 1082 / 1999, H 10 A/chicken/Germany/N 49, H 14 A/mallard/Astrakhan/ 263 / 1982, H 15 A/shearwater/West Australia/ 2576 / 1979) and we have used them as surrogate antigens in neutralisation assays to study the presence and magnitude of heterosubtypic <b>neutralising</b> <b>antibody</b> responses in human sera collected before and after the 2007 - 2008 seasonal influenza vaccination. Results: In the human sera tested, <b>neutralising</b> <b>antibody</b> responses are detected against not only human influenza viruses, but also against influenza pseudotypes harbouring avian haemagglutinins belonging to group 2 viruses. After seasonal vaccination, the pseudotype neutralisation assays detect variation in the <b>neutralising</b> <b>antibody</b> titres against avian influenza pseudotypes. Conclusions: The increased sensitivity of the pseudotype neutralisation assay performed using a panel of influenza A pseudotypes permits the detection of heterosubtypic antibody responses before and after seasonal influenza vaccination.

40|$|The {{absence of}} an {{effective}} humoral response contributes {{to the failure of}} controlling HIV- 1 infection. Methods to elicit a potent <b>neutralising</b> <b>antibody</b> response is still underway and this thesis explores three aspects that can affect neutralisation. The pseudovirus-based assay is now recommended as the standard assay for assessing <b>neutralising</b> <b>antibody</b> response. However, recent studies have reported discrepancies between pseduovirus-based assay and conventional PBMCs or other cell-based assays. The first aim is to investigate possible causes behind this difference. The effect of virus producer cell type and virus platform (pseudovirus vs. replication-competent) was examined and both parameters can affect neutralisation. The second aim was to study the the <b>neutralising</b> <b>antibody</b> response in patients with primary HIV- 1 infection. A panel of 6 patients were selected from the SPARTAC clinical trial. Pseudoviruses were constructed with the env gene derived from patient samples at week 0 (baseline) and week 52. The evolutionary history and the neutralisation sensitivity of these primary isolates against a panel of broadly neutralising antibodies and heterologous and autologous sera were studied. The week 52 isolates escaped from antisera neutralisation rapidly, most likely at the glycan level. In addition, viral load was found to correlate directly with intra-patient viral diversity and evolutionary divergence over time. Finally, the effect of Nef on HIV- 1 neutralisation was investigated. Recent reports suggest that Nef modifies HIV- 1 envelope glycoprotein. Hence, <b>neutralising</b> <b>antibody</b> response might also be modified in the absence of Nef. When subjected to neutralisation with a panel of monoclonal antibodies, the Nef-deleted (ΔNef) HIV- 1 was more readily neutralised than the wild-type (WT) virus. Immunoprecipitation assays showed that neutralising antibodies can capture ΔNef virus more efficiently than WT virus. However, the enhanced neutralisation of ΔNef virus was neither due to CD 4 -down regulation nor difference in glycosylation.

Four well-characterised cell lines are analysed for their responsiveness to exogenous EGF and transforming growth factor alpha (TGF-alpha) as well as for coexpression of EGFR and EGF/TGF-alpha. Both growth factors are able to stimulate DNA synthesis in three cell lines, although the degree of responsiveness is very variable, but neither EGF nor TGF-alpha has an effect on the cell line ZL 34. In contrast, no heterogeneity is observed in the expression of EGFR, which is similarly high in all cell lines. Analysis of cell supernatants reveals that, whereas no EGF is detected, TGF-alpha is released by two cell lines. Furthermore, these two cell lines, ZL 5 and ZL 34, are shown to express the membrane anchored precursor pro-TGF-alpha. Thus, coexpression of EGFR and TGF-alpha is observed on two mesothelioma cell lines.
