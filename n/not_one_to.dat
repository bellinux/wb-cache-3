He {{was said to have}} been a quiet person, and unlike other athletes of his era was <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> talk about his exploits, except with close friends. Loughlin, his wife, came from Quebec; around 1903 they were married and had two {{children}} together.|$|E
5|$|Before 1902, Manchester United {{were known}} as Newton Heath, during which time they first played their {{football}} matches at North Road and then Bank Street in Clayton. However, both grounds were blighted by wretched conditions, the pitches ranging from gravel to marsh, while Bank Street suffered from clouds of fumes from its neighbouring factories. Therefore, following the club's rescue from near-bankruptcy and renaming, the new chairman John Henry Davies decided in 1909 that the Bank Street ground was not fit {{for a team that}} had recently won the First Division and FA Cup, so he donated funds {{for the construction of a}} new stadium. <b>Not</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> spend money frivolously, Davies scouted around Manchester for an appropriate site, before settling on a patch of land adjacent to the Bridgewater Canal, just off the north end of the Warwick Road in Old Trafford.|$|E
5|$|Several years later, a {{new power}} had emerged in Asia. In 88 BC, a Roman army {{was sent to}} put down that power, king Mithridates VI of Pontus, but was defeated. Over the {{objections}} of the former Consul Gaius Marius, the Consul for the year, Lucius Cornelius Sulla was ordered by the senate to assume command of the war against Mithridates. Marius, {{a member of the}} democratic ("populare") party, had a Tribune revoke Sulla's command of the war against Mithridates, so Sulla, a member of the aristocratic ("optimate") party, brought his army back to Italy and marched on Rome. Marius fled, and his supporters either fled or were murdered by Sulla. Sulla had become so angry at Marius' Tribune that he passed a law that was intended to permanently weaken the Tribunate. He then returned to his war against Mithridates, and with Sulla gone, the populares under Marius and Lucius Cornelius Cinna soon took control of the city. The populare record was <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> be proud of, as they had reelected Marius Consul several times without observing the required ten-year interval. They also transgressed democracy by advancing un-elected individuals to magisterial office, and by substituting magisterial edicts for popular legislation. Sulla soon made peace with Mithridates, and in 83 BC, he returned to Rome, overcame all resistance, and captured the city again. Sulla and his supporters then slaughtered most of Marius' supporters, although one such supporter, a 17-year-old populare (and the son-in-law of Cinna) named Julius Caesar, was ultimately spared.|$|E

She {{made sure}} that her company had a {{constant}} supply of talent, and in later years it had such stars as Svetlana Beriosova, Antoinette Sibley, Nadia Nerina, Lynn Seymour, and, most sensationally, Rudolf Nureyev. She also invited choreographers like Sir Kenneth MacMillan and George Balanchine {{to work with her}} company. She formally retired from the Royal Ballet in 1963, but her presence continued to loom large in the company.|$|E
25|$|Frank Sinatra, who had {{declared}} Presley and {{rock and roll}} a disgrace in the 1950s, was keen to have him appear on his show. Parker, <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> forget harsh criticism, stated that the fee would be $125,000 for two songs, a total of eight minutes on screen; Sinatra himself was receiving a lower sum for the whole show, but he agreed. The show, entitled “Welcome Home, Elvis”, was Presley's first national television appearance since The Ed Sullivan Show in January 1957.|$|E

This time his reference was his own infant son, Peter. The intent was to do something nontheatrical and sincere, {{to try to put}} the personality of a human child into that of an elephant so that it rings true. His son, Peter Tytla, has grown up to become a collage artist focusing on images made from photographs of junk cars.|$|E

The 22 All Blacks missing from New Zealand teams started to have a visible effect on the kiwi sides with only the Hurricanes claiming a tight win over the Blues. Another relatively low scoring match saw even the last years powerhouse champions the Crusaders beaten by last years 13th placed Lions, it was the first match in six years the Crusaders hadn't scored a single try.|$|E

In 1854, his second son, William D. Moore (Billie), was born at Callao. However, Hendrika was frightened by the ongoing revolutions in Peru, and they returned to San Francisco in 1856. Moore purchased property on Goat Island and raised goats. Also in 1856, his third child, daughter Henrietta, was born.|$|E
25|$|Lubbers {{ended his}} {{international}} career {{on a high}} note at the 1996 World Cup, where the Netherlands played their first ever ODIs. In the first of these, against New Zealand at Baroda, he took the first ever ODI wicket by a Dutchman when Craig Spearman was caught by Bas Zuiderent. (This was actually the second wicket to fall, as Nathan Astle had earlier been run out.) His batting was poor, however, as he failed to reach double figures in four attempts. His final game for his country was <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> remember: Lubbers scored just 2 not out and conceded 50 runs from eight wicketless overs as South Africa crushed the Dutch by 160 runs at Rawalpindi.|$|E

25|$|Even though Sandridge had {{no formal}} {{training}} or art education, his intuitively unique style and hand painted talent of billboards {{caught the attention}} of The Coca-Cola Company in the early 1970s. Working for an outdoor sign company, Sandridge painted a realistically, eye-catching image of Niagara Falls featuring the iconic Coca-Cola bottle and logo design on a 14ft x 48ft billboard. So popular was the sight that the billboard won an award, prompting representatives from The Coca-Cola Company to drive from Atlanta, Georgia, to Gadsden, Alabama, to preview Sandridge's artwork. Feeling proud of the attention his craftsmanship had attracted, Sandridge recognized that the weight of the adverse racial overtones of the time would not allow him the recognition he deserved. He was not even given a formal introduction to the men who were captivated by his work. But <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> sit idly by and accept racism or tolerate blatant disrespect towards his work ethic and creative abilities, he soon left that company.|$|E

There's <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> be seen."

500|$|Dowd, however, had two {{problems}} during the recording. [...] "What'd I Say" [...] lasted over {{seven and a}} half minutes when the normal length of radio-played songs was around two and a half minutes. Furthermore, although the lyrics were not obscene, the sounds Charles and the Raelettes made in their calls and responses during the song worried Dowd and the producers. A previous recording called [...] "Money Honey" [...] by Clyde McPhatter had been banned in Georgia and Ahmet Ertegun and Wexler released McPhatter's song despite the ban, risking arrest. Ray Charles was aware of the controversy in [...] "What'd I Say": [...] "I'm <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> interpret my own songs, but if you can't figure out 'What I Say', then something's wrong.

500|$|Notre Dame offered Lavelli a scholarship, and he {{committed}} {{to attend the}} school. After {{he had a chance}} encounter with Eddie Prokop, however, an able running back who was a fifth-string player for Notre Dame, Lavelli was convinced to look elsewhere. [...] "If Eddie Prokop were a fifth-string player, I was <b>not</b> <b>one</b> <b>to</b> sit on anyone's bench," [...] he later said. Lavelli enrolled at Ohio State University in 1941 after learning that Paul Brown was appointed the football team's new head coach. Brown had developed a sterling reputation as the high school coach at Massillon Washington High School in Massillon, Ohio, losing only eight games in nine years there. Lavelli's catching ability had made him a star infielder in high school, and the Detroit Tigers of Major League Baseball recruited him to play second base in the low minor leagues. He refused the invitation, opting to concentrate on football.|$|E

There's a serial killer who has killed four or five people, who calls himself Zodiac, who's threatened to take a high-powered rifle and shoot out the tires of a school bus, and then shoot the children as they come off the bus. For Fincher as a young boy, the killer [...] "was the ultimate boogeyman". The director was also drawn to the unresolved ending of Vanderbilt's screenplay because it felt true to real life, as cases are not always solved. Toschi later stated that he had watched Zodiac several times and added [...] "I thought Ruffalo did a good job," [...] but also reported that the film reminded him of old frustrations that the case was never closed.|$|E
