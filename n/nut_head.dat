5000|$|Due to the {{twisting}} or cam {{action of the}} socket on a bolt or <b>nut</b> <b>head,</b> {{nearly all of the}} torque is applied at or near the corners of the nut or bolt. Whether one uses either a twelve or six point socket the same stresses are applied in the same locations. Under load, nearly all of the flats of the nut are not touching the socket at all, it is only a small amount of the surfaces near the fastener corners which bears the torque loads. In nearly all applications over-stressing a bolt or nut will result in stripping the bolt or nut threads or breaking the bolt long before the socket will break. Tougher, thicker impact sockets are made for impact gun use. Occasionally when the corners of a bolt head or nut begin to become worn or damaged, the material the nut is made from can eventually smear or tear under load and create a situation where the corners are effectively [...] "rounded off". Some socket users believe that six point sockets are less likely to damage a fastener head, but tool evaluations and lab tests document that there is no difference in performance. A distorted or corroded fastener head may not fit a six-point socket but a twelve-point socket can be made to fit. When a fastener head is [...] "rounded off" [...] the nut or bolt can often no longer be turned without special repair or extraction tools. These rounded-off heads can incur substantial penalties, both direct and indirect. Deteriorated fasteners often inhibit the routine assembly and disassembly of the host components that rely on them, which can in turn deter users from performing normal maintenance procedures. Addressing the problem may require cost and effort, and potentially sidelining valuable equipment until the component's damaged fasteners have been replaced.|$|E

5000|$|When {{working with}} common 6-point {{hexagonal}} fasteners, the 12-point shaped socket offers {{double the amount}} of starting points or possible positions by which to put the socket on the nut. This is of large importance on a box wrench which is typically adjustable in 15 or 30 degree increments. This versatility of fitting position is normally of small importance on a socket wrench which can be easily rotated in small increments regardless of socket type. Since loading contact points between the nut and socket are at the corner points (not the flats), twelve point sockets have more than adequate strength for most applications where nut and socket are in good condition. If the nut or socket is rounded by wear, using a [...] "double" [...] shaped socket {{is more likely to}} results in slippage or further rounding off and possible stripping of either the bolt <b>head,</b> <b>nut</b> or socket. This versatility is the main purpose of the 12-point shape found in common sockets, but is essential when working with 12-point bolt and <b>nut</b> <b>heads.</b> Socket strength is mainly a function of the alloys and heat treatments used to make the socket along with wall thickness of the socket wrench as measured at the corner points (thinnest section).|$|R

50|$|Over the years, {{nearly all}} {{manufacturers}} of quality sockets have introduced convex walls {{and other similar}} optimizations to the socket geometry {{in an effort to}} minimize such problems. These changes are intended to spread the applied torque away from the corners of fasteners and instead target the thicker, more reinforced areas of the <b>nut</b> or bolt <b>head.</b> Successful designs can greatly reduce the likelihood of eroding the vulnerable corner areas of the fastener, with the benefits increasing as the <b>nut</b> or bolt <b>head</b> is subjected to higher and higher loads.

However, in the cold-formed assemblies, particularly in trusses, the single bolt goes through {{both sides of the}} connected sections, making the connected sheets on each side unrestrained. the warping of the unrestrained sheet may reduce the bearing strength of the bolted connection. This research investigates the behavior and strength of bearing failure in bolted connections in cold-formed steel trusses.

It was found that the AISI S 100 works well for thick connections but provides unconservative predictions for thin materials. Based on the experimental results, a modified bearing strength method is proposed for calculating the bearing strength of bolted truss connections. the proposed method can be used for any cold-formed steel connections with unrestrained sheet...|$|R

5000|$|There are {{two main}} types of socket wrenches: impact sockets and hand sockets. Common sockets are colloquially {{referred}} to by {{counting the number of}} [...] "points" [...] (pointed corners of walls) present {{in the shape of the}} socket nut opening. For example, the hexagon shape is commonly called a [...] "6 point" [...] socket because the hexagon forms 6 [...] "points" [...] where walls intersect to create six sharp pointed corners. This system of description using [...] "points" [...] generally works well in avoiding confusion, with the exception of [...] "8-point" [...] and [...] "12-point" [...] where two very incompatible shapes exist with both having 8 [...] "points" [...] and 12 [...] "points". The vast majority of larger common <b>nut</b> and bolt <b>heads</b> are produced with the 6-point hexagonal gripping shape. Less frequently used shapes include the square 4-point, triple square 12-point (not to be confused with 12-point double hexagon), octagonal 8-point (not to be confused with the more common 8-point double square shape). These less common shapes are typically found in special applications or particular industries such as aircraft, PVC plumbing fittings or German and UK made automobiles. With rail cars, valve adjustment screws and pipe plugs the 4-point square shaped driver can still be found in wide use both male and female configurations. <b>Nuts</b> and bolt <b>heads</b> are also produced in 12-point double hexagon shapes and various types of splines more common to aircraft and aerospace applications. Most manufacturers of sockets for larger bolts produce them in 6-point (hexagonal) and limited sizes of 12-point (double-hexagonal) configurations.|$|R

The first to be added and most obvious is a locking plate on the <b>head</b> <b>nut,</b> tightened with a hex key to fix the strings at this point after tuning.

50|$|An {{impact socket}} wrench is a {{cylindrical}} shaped tool {{with a female}} opening to fit over a <b>nut</b> or bolt <b>head,</b> and is most commonly 6-point hexagonal shaped; generally used with the assist of a power tool such as an Impact wrench or hydraulic torque wrench.

25|$|The preload {{achieved}} by torquing a bolt {{is caused by}} the part of the torque that is effective. Friction in the threads and under the <b>nut</b> or bolt <b>head</b> use up some fraction of the applied torque. Much of the torque applied is lost overcoming friction under the torqued bolt <b>head</b> or <b>nut</b> (50%) and in the threads (40%). The remaining 10% of the applied torque does useful work in stretching the bolt and providing the preload. Initially, as the torque is applied, it must overcome static friction under the head of the bolt or nut (depending on which end is being torqued) and also in the threads. Finally, dynamic friction prevails and the torque is distributed in a 50/40/10 % manner as the bolt is tensioned. The torque value is dependent on the friction produced in the threads and under the torqued bolt <b>head</b> or <b>nut</b> and the fastened material or washer if used. This friction can be affected by the application of a lubricant or any plating (e.g. cadmium or zinc) applied to the threads, and the fastener's standard defines whether the torque value is for dry or lubricated threading, as lubrication can reduce the torque value by 15% to 25%; lubricating a fastener designed to be torqued dry could over-tighten it, which may damage threading or stretch the fastener beyond its elastic limit, thereby reducing its clamping ability.|$|R
50|$|The first {{prototype}} for the Esquire (and the later Telecaster) {{was completed by}} Leo Fender {{in the fall of}} 1949. The prototype shared with these guitars the now-familiar slab body shape with single cutaway to allow easier access to the upper frets. It likewise featured the distinctive combination bridge and pickup assembly, with a slanted pickup with individual pole pieces for each string, and three bridge saddles which allowed adjustment of string length in pairs and individual string height. The neck, like the first Esquires manufactured in 1950, was made from a single piece of maple without a truss rod. The neck was attached to the body with four screws and an anchor plate, unlike in traditional guitar construction, where a tenon on the neck is glued into the body. Unlike the Esquire, the neck was wider at the <b>nut,</b> and the <b>head</b> had 3 tuners on each side. The prototype differed from the later production guitars in several other respects: the body was made of pinewood, it was painted opaque white, its pickguard did not extend above the strings, it lacked a selector switch, and its volume and tone knobs were mounted on a slanted plate. Like the production models, it had a removable pickup cover, but unlike the production models, the cover had straight sides. The prototype had only one pickup, as did Esquires manufactured from 1951 onwards.|$|R
40|$|The wide {{choice of}} {{cross-sectional}} shapes obtainable by extrusion provides {{the possibility to}} individuate new joining solution for aluminium profiles. These joints, named “special” or “non-conventional” joints, are very competitive with respect to conventional solutions because {{of the possibility of}} rapid execution, optimization of parent material, treatments and machining reduction. For these reasons, the aluminium industry is very interested to enhance the knowledge about the structural behaviour of this joint typology. The work is focused on two different special joint systems: screw ports and bolt-channel joints. In particular, the first joint typology consists in a screw engaged in an open or closed slot of an extruded profile. The latter system consists in a track or channel section profile in which a bolt <b>head,</b> <b>nuts</b> or plates with threaded holes can be located. Special joints are used in several structural and non applications under low and moderate loads such as façades, door and window fixtures. But, in the last years, other structural applications like staircases, floors, pedestrian bridge, industrial furniture and shelves have been developed involving special joints. Nevertheless, very little literature is available for this system and no specifications are provided by aluminium structures codes. The main objective of this work is to overcome the lack of information about the mechanical behaviour of special joints. In order to evaluate the structural behaviour of such joint, a wide experimental campaign has been carried out. In addition, on the basis of experimental results, non-linear finite element models have been developed and calibrated...|$|R

These Pearl gathered, and was pleased with their wild flavour. The small denizens of the wilderness hardly took pains to move out of her path. A partridge, indeed, with a brood of ten behind her, ran forward threateningly, but soon repented of her fierceness, and clucked to her young ones not to be afraid. A pigeon, alone on a low branch, allowed Pearl to come beneath, and uttered a sound as much of greeting as alarm.

A wolf, it is said--but here the tale has surely lapsed into the improbable--came up and smelt of Pearl's robe, and offered his savage head to be patted by her hand. The truth seems to be, however, that the mother-forest, and these wild things which it nourished, all recognised a kindred wilderness in the human child.|$|R
