5000|$|In 1996, after tests {{conducted}} {{on more than}} 50 municipalities, the Brazilian Electoral Justice has launched their [...] "voting machine". Since 2000, all Brazilian voters are {{able to use the}} electronic ballot boxes to choose their candidates. In 2010 presidential election, which had more than 135 million voters, the result was defined 75 minutes after the end of voting. The electronic ballot box is made up of two micro-terminals (one located in the voting cabin and the other with the voting board representative) which are connected by a 5-meter cable. Externally, the micro-terminals have only a <b>numerical</b> <b>keyboard,</b> which does not accept any command executed by the simultaneous pressure of more than one key. In case of power failure, the internal battery provides the energy or it can be connected to an automotive battery. The Brazilian electronic ballot box serves today as a model for other countries.|$|E

In this work it is shown that index finger positions can be differentiated from non-invasive electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings in healthy human subjects. Using a leave-one-subject-out cross-validation procedure, a random forest distinguished different index finger positions on a <b>numerical</b> <b>keyboard</b> above chance-level accuracy. Among the different spectral features investigated, high β-power (20 - 30 Hz) over contralateral sensorimotor cortex carried most information about finger position. Thus, these findings indicate that finger position is in principle decodable from non-invasive features of brain activity that generalize across individuals. Comment: accepted manuscrip...|$|E

40|$|Authentication {{and privacy}} in {{wireless}} systems {{is becoming an}} increasingly important field: More {{and more people are}} using more and more wireless system on personal devices that process vast amounts of personal data, at home and abroad, and on a daily basis. Laptops, smartphones, and tablet PCs are examples for devices in a world of ubiquitous wireless services. With the growing amount of personal data at risk, awareness for this issue is picking up with some users. The goal of this thesis is to extend the state-of-the-art in the field of security and privacy for wireless services and to show that achieving security and privacy is possible even on hardware with a minimum of computational capabilities, and in scenarios where it has not been considered at all so far to foster new research directions. We will present self-contained and thorough solutions for authentication and privacy challenges in three different scenarios. All these solutions fulfill security and privacy goals not achieved by prior works. All solutions are analyzed on a theoretical and a practical level, i. e., the theoretical background of the solution shows its feasibility and that it achieves the security and privacy goals desired. Furthermore, all solutions are implemented on inexpensive commercially available hardware and benchmarked for performance. Where possible, our new solutions were compared to existing solutions. All the proposed solutions are meant to be useful in the real world, i. e., we consider performance and user experience. We first propose a protocol suite for wireless roaming. It allows clients of certain home operators to access wireless networks of other local operators without disclosing their personal data to the local operators, and it prevents the home operators from obtaining any information on the services used beyond the amount paid. The roaming solution includes electronic payment and does not require prepaid credit. Attacks on the wireless connection are prevented. When connected, users may also allow their devices act as access points for others user and earn money therewith. We present solutions with and without the participation of the home operator in each connection. We next propose a protocol suite for electronic health monitoring. It allows secure and privacy preserving handling of real-time measured data on bodily functions, e. g., the heart rate. The data never leaves the control of the user unless explicitly authorized. Finally, we present a solution for time synchronization in wireless sensor networks, which is the first to guarantee the privacy of the nodes taking part in the synchronization. The individual nodes are unobservable and cannot be influenced by an attacker through modifications on the wireless channel. Beyond the work on privacy, as an excursus, we present the implementation of an attack on the authentication in Bluetooth, which, {{to the best of our}} knowledge and belief, is the first implemented attack on the Bluetooth versions 2. 1, 3. 0, or 4. 0. The attack targets devices with <b>numerical</b> <b>keyboards,</b> e. g., wireless keyboards for tablet computers, when the same PIN is used twice. Potential victims are also devices with fixed PINs...|$|R
40|$|PINs {{are one of}} {{the most}} popular methods to perform simple and fast user authentication. PIN stands for Personal Identification Number, which may have any number of digits or even letters. Nevertheless, 4 -digit PIN is the most common and is used for {{instance}} in ATMs or cellular phones. The main advantage of the PIN is that it is easy to remember and fast to enter. There are, however, some drawbacks. One of them - addressed in this paper - is a possibility to steal PIN by a technique called `shoulder surfing'. To avoid such problems a novel method of the PIN entering was proposed. Instead of using a <b>numerical</b> <b>keyboard,</b> the PIN may be entered by eye gazes, which is a hands-free, easy and robust technique. References...|$|E
40|$|International audienceDu-Vote is a {{recently}} presented remote electronic voting scheme. Its {{goal is to}} be malware tolerant, i. e., provide security even in the case where the platform used for voting has been compromised by dedicated malware. For this it uses an additional hardware token, similar to tokens distributed in the context of online banking. The token is software closed and does not have any communication means other than a <b>numerical</b> <b>keyboard</b> and a small display. Du-Vote aims at providing vote privacy as long as either the vote platform or the vote server is honest. For verifiability, the security guarantees are even higher, as even if the token's software has been changed, and the platform and the server are colluding, attempts to change the election outcome should be detected with high probability. In this paper we provide an extensive security analysis of Du-Vote and show several attacks on both privacy as well as verifiability. We also propose changes to the system that would avoid many of these attacks...|$|E
