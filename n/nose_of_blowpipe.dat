5000|$|The term {{blowpipe}} is {{also used}} to refer to the pipe used to blow deliver air to the tuyeres of a forge or blast furnace. [...] The <b>blowpipe</b> <b>of</b> a forge may be considered to be a large bellows operated version <b>of</b> a mouth-blown <b>blowpipe,</b> directing air through a coal or charcoal flame.|$|R
5000|$|After playing {{several times}} in London (the first of which {{included}} a visit and constructive critique from Damon Albarn) Octopus were spotted by Levitation drummer David Francolini. He passed their demo to Food Records boss Andy Ross, who signed the band, releasing their debut single, [...] "Magazine" [...] in March 1996. While retaining the four-piece creative core, the band onstage had by now expanded to an octet {{with the addition of}} trumpeters James Donaldson and Andrew Blick (the latter also <b>of</b> <b>Blowpipe),</b> pianist Mike Servent and harmonica player Nick Reynolds (son of Great Train Robber Bruce Reynolds).|$|R

25|$|The {{earliest}} {{evidence of}} glassblowing {{was found by}} Roman Ghirshman in Chogha Zanbil, where many glass bottles {{were found in the}} excavations of the 2nd millennium BC site. Later evidence comes from a collection of waste from a glass shop, including fragments of glass tubes, glass rods and tiny blown bottles, which was dumped in a mikvah, a ritual bath in the Jewish Quarter of the Old City of Jerusalem, dated from 37 to 4 BC. Some of the glass tubes recovered are fire-closed at one end and are partially inflated by blowing through the open end while still hot to form a small bottle; thus they are considered as a rudimentary form <b>of</b> <b>blowpipe.</b>|$|R
50|$|After {{the death}} of Ferdinand Magellan, the remnant of his fleet landed in Palawan. Magellan's chronicler, Antonio Pigafetta, in his writings, {{described}} the cultivated fields of the native people populating the Palawan Islands. He also mentioned that these people use weapons consisting <b>of</b> <b>blowpipes,</b> spears and bronze ombard. During his stay in the area, he witnessed {{for the first time}} cockfighting and fistfighting. He also discovered that the natives had their own system of writing consisting of 13 consonants and 3 vowels, and they had a dialect of 18 syllables. He further wrote that in Palawan, the local King had 10 scribes who wrote down the King's dictation on leaves of plants.|$|R

50|$|Aerial torpedo {{experts in}} all modern navies had {{previously}} thought that torpedo attacks against ships {{must be in}} water at least 75 ft deep. Taranto harbour had a depth of only about 39 ft; but the Royal Navy had developed a new method of preventing torpedoes from diving too deep. A drum was attached beneath the <b>nose</b> <b>of</b> the aircraft, from which a roll of wire led to the <b>nose</b> <b>of</b> the torpedo. As it dropped, the tension from the wire pulled up the <b>nose</b> <b>of</b> the torpedo, producing a belly-flop rather than a nose dive.|$|R
