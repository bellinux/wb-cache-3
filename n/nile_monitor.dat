25|$|A {{number of}} {{non-native}} snakes and lizards {{have been released}} in the wild. In 2010 the state created a hunting season for Burmese and Indian pythons, African rock pythons, green anacondas, and <b>Nile</b> <b>monitor</b> lizards. Green iguanas have also established a firm population {{in the southern part}} of the state.|$|E
50|$|<b>Nile</b> <b>monitors</b> {{are not for}} beginners; {{they are}} often found in the pet trade despite a highly {{aggressive}} demeanor and resistance to taming. Juvenile monitors will tail whip as a defensive measure, and as adults {{they are capable of}} inflicting moderate to serious wounds from biting and scratching. <b>Nile</b> <b>monitors</b> require a large cage as juveniles quickly grow when fed a varied diet, and large adults often require custom-built quarters. Soil, sand, or bark chippings can be used as substrate and should be deep enough that the monitor can replicate natural digging and foraging behavior. The enclosure should contain things to make a suitable habitat such as rocks, driftwood, plastic plants or hollow logs. A water dish large enough for the lizard to completely submerge should be provided. <b>Nile</b> <b>monitors</b> have a tendency to defecate in the water dish, which requires frequent cleaning. A healthy diet will be varied and contain insects, fish, birds, eggs, and rodents. An insect-heavy diet should be supplemented with calcium powder.|$|R
50|$|The {{goliath frog}} can {{live up to}} 15 years in the wild. In captivity, they can live up to 21 years. It is preyed upon by snakes, Nile crocodiles, and <b>Nile</b> <b>monitors,</b> among other predators.|$|R
5000|$|The total {{potential}} {{yield of}} {{fish from the}} reservoir has been estimated at over 50 tonnes per year. The reservoir is used for subsistence, commercial and sports fishing, and also by a sailing club. Turtles, fish, otters, <b>Nile</b> <b>monitors</b> and many different birds inhabit the reservoir.|$|R
25|$|In the Florida Everglades, {{where the}} African rock python is an {{invasive}} species and posing {{a threat to}} indigenous wildlife, it has no protected status {{and is one of}} the species listed on a hunting program recently authorized by state officials to eradicate non-native reptiles, the others being the Burmese python, reticulated python, green anaconda, and <b>Nile</b> <b>monitor.</b>|$|E
500|$|The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) {{initiated}} {{a task force}} to concentrate on identifying the most invasive animals. The agency created a list of [...] "Reptiles of Concern" [...] for the Burmese python, African rock python (Python sebae), amethystine python (Morelia amethystinus), reticulated python (Python reticulatus), green anaconda (Eunectes murinus), and the <b>Nile</b> <b>monitor.</b> Florida also began requiring owners to pay a permit fee of $100 a year and place microchips on the animals. These predators are included on the list for their formidable size and aggressive natures; animals that were in the Everglades before the list was created, however, are breeding in the wild. To combat the number of exotic snakes in the U.S., and specifically in South Florida, the U.S. Department of the Interior added four species of snakes—Burmese pythons, two subspecies of African rock pythons (northern and southern), and the yellow anaconda (Eunectes notaeus)—to Lacey Act provisions, making their import into the U.S. illegal, in 2012. Exotic birds do not attract the same amount of attention. They too have been brought to Florida as part of the pet trade and escape, get released by dealers attempting to avoid quarantine restrictions, or escape from damaged cages and artificial habitats during tropical storms. Typically, however, most nonindigenous birds live closer to populated areas; some populations of birds establish themselves but decline for unapparent reasons.|$|E
2500|$|This is the heaviest-bodied lizard in Africa, as {{adult males}} average about [...] and females weigh from [...] Large mature males can attain [...] It {{is the second}} longest African lizard after the <b>Nile</b> <b>monitor,</b> Varanus albigularis reaches [...] in length, with its tail and body being of equal size. Mature {{specimens}} more typically will measure [...] The head and neck are the same length, and are distinct from each other. [...] Their bulbous, convex snouts give an angular, box-like appearance. [...] Their forked tongues are pink or bluish, [...] and their scales are usually a mottled gray-brown with yellowish or white markings.|$|E
50|$|Monitor lizards {{have become}} a staple in the reptile pet trade. The most {{commonly}} kept monitors are the savannah monitor and Ackies monitor, due to their relatively small size, low cost, and relatively calm dispositions with regular handling. Among others, black-throated monitors, timor monitors, Asian water <b>monitors,</b> <b>Nile</b> <b>monitors,</b> mangrove monitors, emerald tree monitors, black tree monitors, roughneck monitors, dumeril's monitors, peach-throated monitors, crocodile monitors and Argus monitors have been kept in captivity.|$|R
50|$|Their {{nostrils}} {{are placed}} high on their snouts, indicating {{these animals are}} highly aquatic. They are also excellent climbers and quick runners on land. <b>Nile</b> <b>monitors</b> feed on fish, snails, frogs, crocodile eggs and young, snakes, birds, small mammals, insects, and carrion.They are also the second largest reptile in the Nile river.|$|R
50|$|There are 40 snake species, nine {{of which}} are venomous, such as cobras, puff adders and mambas, genus Dendroaspis; the first two are common. The non-venomous {{reptiles}} are pythons, bush snakes, lizards agamas and skinks (with brown and orange flanks); Bose’s <b>monitor,</b> <b>Nile</b> <b>monitors</b> (Varanus niloticus), which are voracious predators; tree geckos; and chameleon.|$|R
2500|$|Opened in 1991, the Africa Rainforest exhibit covers [...] and {{was built}} {{at a cost}} of $4.3 million. In {{addition}} to animals, the exhibit includes artwork and the Kongo Ranger Station, a mock up of a safari expedition. Animals in the exhibit include Rodriguez fruit bats, straw-colored fruit bats, Egyptian fruit bats, colobus monkeys, Allen's swamp monkey, hadada ibis, white-faced whistling ducks, slender-snouted crocodile, <b>Nile</b> <b>monitor</b> lizard, lungfish, cichlids, lesser flamingos, geckos, chameleons, African crested porcupines, African clawed frogs, and hooded vultures. The rainforest includes four main areas: the Bamba Du Jon Swamp, which houses the lungfish, cichlids, frogs and reptiles; the rainforest aviary, which houses the birds; the monkey habitat which houses the monkeys and chameleon; and the bat habitat.|$|E
2500|$|The Northern Lakes of Egypt are {{important}} to preserve biodiversity. From west to east the lakes in the Nile Delta are Lake Mariout south of Alexandria, Lake Edku east of Alexandria, Lake Burullus east of Rosetta and Lake Manzala between Damietta and Port Said. Another important Northern Lake is Lake Bardawil in northern Sinai that is not fed by the Nile. Several hundred thousand water birds winter in these lakes, including the world’s largest concentrations of little gulls and whiskered terns. Other birds making {{their homes in the}} delta include grey herons, Kentish plovers, shovelers and cormorants. Also found are egrets and ibises. Lake Bardawil and Lake Burullus are protected wetlands of international importance under the Ramsar Convention. Despite of the flourishing fish production in Egypt, only 17 species remain as of 1995 out of 47 species in 1948. The Nile perch {{is one of the more}} prominent fish species in the Egyptian Nile. It is found in Lake Nasser and in Lake Mariout in the Nile Delta. [...] Other fish found in the delta include the striped mullet and soles. Other animals found in the delta include frogs, turtles, tortoises, mongooses, and the <b>Nile</b> <b>monitor.</b>|$|E

50|$|While birds, {{including}} raptors, {{wading birds}} and roadrunners, and mammals {{are known to}} prey on reptiles, the major predator is other reptiles. Some reptiles eat reptile eggs, for example the diet of the <b>Nile</b> <b>monitor</b> includes crocodile eggs, and small reptiles are preyed upon by larger ones.|$|E
50|$|Shoebills {{are largely}} piscivorous but are assured predators of a {{considerable}} range of wetland vertebrates. Preferred prey species have reportedly included marbled lungfish (Protopterus aethiopicus) and Senegal bichir (Polypterus senegalus) {{as well as}} various Tilapia species and catfish, the latter mainly in the genus Clarias. Other prey eaten by this species has included frogs, water snakes, <b>Nile</b> <b>monitors</b> (Varanus niloticus) and baby crocodiles. More rarely, turtles, snails, rodents and small waterfowl have reportedly been eaten. There exists a single report of shoebills feeding on lechwe (Kobus leche) calves, although this would need confirmation. Given its sharp-edged beak, huge bill and wide gape, the shoebill can hunt large prey, often targeting prey bigger than other large wading birds. Fish eaten by this species are commonly {{in the range of}} 15 to 50 cm long and weigh around 500 g, though lungfish of as much as 1 m have been attacked. Snakes preyed upon are commonly from 50 to 60 cm long. In the Bangweulu Swamps of Zambia, the main prey items fed to young by the parents consisted of the catfish Clarias gariepinus (syn. C. mossambicus) and water snakes. In Uganda, lungfish and catfish were mainly fed to the young. The big beak is sometimes used to dig into pond-bottom mud to extract lungfish from their aestivation burrows.|$|R
