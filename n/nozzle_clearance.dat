50|$|As stated above, the {{cylinders}} in a diesel engine are fed by a unit injector, {{which in turn}} is fed by a crankshaft or charger driven injection pump. Maximum pump RPM (and thus the pressure of fuel supplied to the injectors) is regulated by a centrifugal governor. The operator regulates the <b>nozzle</b> <b>clearance</b> of the injector and the governor thus adjusts the fuel pressure to keep stable RPM. Failure of any part of the mechanism, particularly the governor can cause an uncontrolled amount of fuel to enter the nozzles creating a positive feedback loop.|$|E
40|$|The {{clearances}} of {{the nozzle}} and volute have significant {{influences on the}} unsteady flow, blade load distribution and thermodynamic performance of downstream radial turbine. The unsteady flow and blade loads are intensified due to the interactions among shock, leakage flow and nozzle wake. Few {{studies have been conducted}} to date to investigate these effects in detail. This work focuses on the tip leakage flow effects on the nozzle wake and shock. Furthermore, the blade loads of the downstream rotor are considered by evaluating the effects of shock, leakage flow and nozzle wake, and the fluctuating pressures are presented in a novel space-time diagram. To reveal the flow mechanism in a variable radial turbine, two <b>nozzle</b> <b>clearance</b> sizes were chosen for investigation via numerical simulation of the unsteady flow and the interaction...|$|E

A Yb:YAG laser is used with 4  kW laser power in an active cutting process with oxygen as cutting gas. For 10  mm thick constructional steel plates a process window is determined with the focus on robustness for distance interferences. The examined parameter sets include the <b>nozzle</b> <b>clearance,</b> focus positioning and cutting gas pressure adjustment, as they are significant factors of influence in underwater laser cutting. By adjusting the developed parameter sets, sheets with thicknesses up to 50  mm, as well as plates that are fixed to a concrete backing are cut. The used equipment, which completely consists of standard components, is presented along with its preparation for underwater operation...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Variable nozzle turbine (VNT) {{has become}} a popular {{technology}} for diesel application. While {{one of the major}} challenges for VNT is resonant vibration due to the fluctuating pressure in unsteady flow. Both the leakage flow forms inside the <b>nozzle</b> <b>clearances</b> and the shock produces under small nozzle openings increase the flow unsteadiness inside downstream rotor tunnel. In this paper, the unsteady simulation of the turbine was conducted to investigate the effects of <b>nozzle</b> <b>clearances</b> and openings on the transient load fluctuation of the blades. Then a finite element model of turbine wheel was built and blade forced response was simulated with harmonic analysis. The results showed that the decrease of nozzle opening would intensify rotor vibration and increase the blade dynamic stress. The simulation of blade resonance showed that the 1 st order resonance located at the blade trailing edge while the 2 nd order resonance happened at the leading edge, which was consistent with the blade actual crack...|$|R

40|$|The {{factors that}} affect the {{stability}} of the melt stream during the casting of wire directly from the melt have been investigated. It is shown that the criticality of process parameters centres mostly on the forces imposed on the melt stream at confluence with the cooling water. The analysis of these forces indicated that the shear component of the disturbance is dependent on the ratio of the velocity of the melt stream (vm) to that of the cooling water (vw) in accord with results obtained from previous experiments. The role of oxide-forming elements in widening the process parameters range is attributed to the increased stability of the melt stream due to the additional shear force resistance offered by the solid oxide layer. The roles of Cr and Si oxides in stabilising the melt stream are confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) of wire indicating the presence of these oxides on fresh as-cast wires. Melt superheat and <b>nozzle</b> <b>clearance</b> distance are not strictly stream stability factors, but rather their role in glass formation prescribes optimal limits for fully amorphous wire...|$|E
40|$|The casting of {{amorphous}} iron-based wires of sub-millimetre diameters {{have been}} studied in a multiple jet casting condition. The effects of process parameters; melt jet to water velocity ratio (νr), melt super heat, nozzle diameter, <b>nozzle</b> <b>clearance</b> distance, and alloy composition on {{the stability of the}} melt jet and consequently {{on the quality of the}} wire has been studied. In order to increase the output rate, a multiple-nozzle crucible was designed for the casting process. Three nozzle designs were considered. It was found that when other cast variables were optimised, the nozzle types affected the flow and coherency of the jet. The best multi-nozzle crucible was made by using laser-drilled quartz platelets. The nozzle spacing did not affect the rapid cooling of the melt jet and thus the amorphous structures in the wires were retained for the closest spacing of 1 mm. It is demonstrated that the use of a multiple-nozzle crucible can effectively be used to increase by many folds the casting rate in the rotating water bath wire casting process...|$|E
40|$|The {{clearance}} flow {{between the}} nozzle and endwall in a variable geometry turbine (VGT) has been numerically investigated {{to understand the}} clearance effect on the VGT performance and internal flow. It {{was found that the}} flow rate through turbine increases but the turbine efficiency decreases with height of clearance. Detailed flow field analyses indicated that most of the efficiency loss resulting from the leakage flow occurs at the upstream of the rotor area, that is, in the <b>nozzle</b> endwall <b>clearance</b> and between the nozzle vanes. There are two main mechanisms associated with this efficiency loss. One is due to the formation of the local vortex flow structure between the clearance flow and the main flow. The other is due to the impact of the clearance flow on the main flow after the nozzle throat. This impact reduces the span of shockwave with increased shockwave magnitude by changing the trajectory of the main flow...|$|R

40|$|As {{a part of}} the {{preliminary}} design work being performed for the Orion vehicle, the Orion to Spacecraft Adaptor (SA) separation mechanism mechanism was analyzed and sized, with findings presented here. Sizing is based on worst case abort condition {{as a result of an}} anomaly driving the launch vehicle engine thrust vector control hard-over causing a severe vehicle pitch over. This worst case scenario occurs just before Upper Stage Main Engine Cut-Off (MECO) when the vehicle is the lightest and the damping effect due to propellant slosh has been reduced to a minimum. To address this scenario and others, two modeling approaches were invoked. The first approach was a detailed Simulink model to quickly assess the Service Module Engine <b>nozzle</b> to SA <b>clearance</b> for a given separation mechanism. The second approach involved the generation of an Automatic Dynamic Analysis of Mechanical Systems (ADAMS) model to assess secondary effects due to mass centers of gravity that were slightly off the vehicle centerline. It also captured any interference between the Solar Arrays and the Spacecraft Adapter. A comparison of modeling results and accuracy are discussed. Most notably, incorporating a larger SA flange diameter allowed for a natural separation of the Orion and its engine nozzle even at relatively large pitch rates minimizing the kickoff force. Advantages and disadvantages of the Simulink model vs. a full geometric ADAMS model are discussed as well...|$|R
40|$|Selenium Technologies {{has been}} {{conducting}} preliminary design work on a manned lunar lander for use in NASA's First Lunar Outpost (FLO) program. The resulting lander is designed to carry a crew of four astronauts to a prepositioned habitat on the lunar surface, remain on the lunar surface for up to 45 days while the crew is living in the habitat, then return the crew to earth via direct reentry and land recovery. Should the need arise, the crew can manually guide the lander to a safe lunar landing site, {{and live in the}} lander for up to ten days on the surface. Also, an abort to earth is available during any segment of the mission. The main propulsion system consists of a cluster of four modified Pratt and Whitney RL 10 rocket engines that use liquid methane (LCH 4) and liquid oxygen (LOX). Four engines are used to provide redundancy and a satisfactory engine out capability. Differences between the new propulsion system and the original system include slightly smaller engine size and lower thrust per engine, although specific impulse remains the same despite the smaller size. Concerns over <b>nozzle</b> ground <b>clearance</b> and engine reliability, as well as more information from Pratt and Whitney, brought about this change. The power system consists of a combination of regenerative fuel cells and solar arrays. While the lander is in flight to or from the moon, or during the lunar night, fuel cells provide all electrical power. During the lunar day, solar arrays are deployed to provide electrical power for the lander as well as electrolyzers, which separate some water back into hydrogen and oxygen for later use by the fuel cells. Total storage requirements for oxygen, hydrogen, and water are 61 kg, 551 kg, and 360 kg, respectively. The lander is a stage-and-a-half design with descent propellant, cargo, and landing gear contained in the descent stage, and the main propulsion system, ascent propellant, and crew module contained in the ascent stage. The primary structure for both stages is a truss, to which all tanks and components are attached. The crew module is a conical shape {{similar to that of the}} Apollo Command Module, but significantly larger with a height and maximum diameter of six meters...|$|R
40|$|Wire is a {{versatile}} product that offer the highest strength in any material and has therefore been a product form {{that is highly}} valued in engineering alloys. The idea of direct casting wire directly from metallic alloy melt {{has been around for}} long but for many reasons has not progressed to large scale commercialization. The main problem had been the difficulty of maintaining a stable melt stream while melt jet can be quenched and continuously solidified into unbroken wire product. Here, we consider the factors responsible for stabilizing a liquid metallic melt jet and the optimization of these. Experimentation with Fe-Si-B-Cr melts for single and multi-strand is reported. It is demonstrated that high strength metallic glass wires were castable using up to five strands. The role of oxide forming elements in stabilizing and widening the range of process parameters is emphasized. X-ray photon electron spectroscopy (XPS) of direct cast wires showed that stable Cr/Si oxide were formed and the evaluation of experimental cast data suggest that a minimum concentration of oxide former is required to maintain continuity in wire products. Other significant process parameters to be optimized for continuous wire formation in multi-streaming wire casting were, <b>nozzle</b> spacing, nozzle-water <b>clearance,</b> and the cast temperature. The multi-streaming of the wire casting process was achieved using laser drilled nozzles and thus provided a credible path for increasing the throughput in a wire casting process...|$|R
