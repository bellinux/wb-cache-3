25|$|Islamabad is a <b>net</b> <b>contributor</b> to the Pakistani economy, as whilst {{having only}} 0.8% of the country's population, it {{contributes}} 1% to the country's GDP. Islamabad Stock Exchange, founded in 1989, is Pakistan's third largest stock exchange after Karachi Stock Exchange and Lahore Stock Exchange, and was merged to form Pakistan Stock Exchange. The exchange had 118 members with 104 corporate bodies and 18 individual members. The average daily turnover {{of the stock}} exchange is over 1 million shares.|$|E
25|$|By {{the early}} 2000s, the Republic {{had become the}} second richest (in terms of GDP per capita, {{adjusted}} for purchasing power parity) member of the European Union, had moved from being a net recipient of EU funds to a <b>net</b> <b>contributor,</b> and {{from a position of}} net emigration to one of net immigration. In 2005, its per capita GDP (adjusted for purchasing power parity) became the second highest in the world (behind Switzerland) with 10 percent of the population born abroad. The population grew to an all-time high for the state of about 4.5 million.|$|E
5000|$|This {{financial}} {{scheme is}} known as the [...] "common regime". In essence, fiscal equalization implies that richer communities become <b>net</b> <b>contributors</b> to the system, while poorer communities become net recipients.

40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{efficiency}} of the pattern of public spending when two asymmetric economies are not perfectly integrated and their pri-vate sectors are imperfectly competitive. We show that tax harmoniza-tion constrains the low productivity country to set higher subsidies for firms. Moreover, while households located in the low productivity country seem to be the <b>net</b> <b>contributors</b> of their public sector regard-less the level of trade costs, residents of the more advanced country may shift from a position of <b>net</b> <b>contributors</b> to <b>net</b> recipients when trade costs are low enough. Finally, we isolate two main externalities suggesting that a coordinated policy increasing the public spendings for households in both countries will be beneficial. Thus, with a very different framework, our results seem to confirm the robustness of the main conclusion of Keen and Marchand (1997) : governments could spend too much for firms and the inefficiency arising from competition for multinationals concerns both the level of taxation and the resulting pattern of public spending...|$|R

2500|$|In {{the post-war}} period, Italy was {{transformed}} from an agricultural based economy {{which had been}} severely affected by {{the consequences of the}} World Wars, into one of the world's most industrialized nations, and a leading country in world trade and exports. According to the Human Development Index, the country enjoys a very high standard of living, and has the world's 8th highest quality of life according to The Economist. Italy owns the world's third-largest gold reserve, and is the third <b>net</b> <b>contributor</b> to the budget of the European Union. The country is also well known for its influential and innovative business economic sector, an industrious (Italy is the second largest manufacturer in Europe behind Germany) and competitive agricultural sector (Italy is the world's largest wine producer), and for its creative and high-quality automobile, naval, industrial, appliance and fashion design.

2500|$|Albertans are the lowest-taxed {{people in}} Canada, {{mostly because of}} the province's {{considerable}} oil and gas income {{as well as the}} more conservative financial philosophies of successive governments. [...] It is also the only province in Canada where there is no provincial sales tax. Unlike the other provinces, which use a progressive income tax regime, Alberta used a flat rate income tax (currently at 10%), while equal for all, it also puts a higher burden of taxes on the lower-classes versus the upper-classes than found elsewhere. As a campaign promise, the New Democratic Party implemented a progressive system in 2015 after their electoral success. Alberta is one of few provinces that consistently has not received equalization payments from the federal government since 1962 (the others being British Columbia and (until 2008) Ontario, the original benchmark provinces). Alberta is now the largest <b>net</b> <b>contributor</b> to the program, which is intended to ensure that all provinces are able to provide similar levels of public services. [...] The province's wealth is largely due to the abundance of natural resources, and the provincial government's generous policies toward oil and wood pulp companies, etc. that have harvested the natural resources for export markets at a very high rate. As a result, Alberta is the only province in Canada that has (recently) eliminated its provincial debt.|$|E

5000|$|Auto-financing {{of basic}} income: {{although}} basic income {{is paid to}} everyone universally, people whose earnings are above the mean income are in fact <b>net</b> <b>contributors</b> to the basic income scheme, mainly through an income tax.

5000|$|Equalization {{payments}} happen via {{the federal}} treasury. As an example, a wealthy citizen in New Brunswick, a so-called [...] "have not" [...] province, pays more into equalization than a poorer citizen in Alberta, a so-called [...] "have" [...] province.

50|$|The European Union (EU) also {{illustrates}} {{the role of}} tax competition. The barriers to free movement of capital and people were reduced close to nonexistence. Some countries (e.g. Republic of Ireland) utilized their low levels of corporate tax to attract large amounts of foreign investment while paying for the necessary infrastructure (roads, telecommunication) from EU funds. The <b>net</b> <b>contributors</b> (like Germany) strongly oppose the idea of infrastructure transfers to low tax countries. <b>Net</b> <b>contributors</b> have not complained, however, about recipient nations such as Greece and Portugal, which have kept taxes high and not prospered. EU integration brings continuing pressure for consumption tax harmonization as well. EU member nations must have a value-added tax (VAT) of at least 15 percent (the main VAT band) and limits the set of products and services that can {{be included in the}} preferential tax band. Still this policy does not stop people utilizing the difference in VAT levels when purchasing certain goods (e.g. cars). The contributing factor are the single currency (Euro), growth of e-commerce and geographical proximity.|$|R

50|$|During the NEP years, 1980-1985, {{only one}} other {{province}} was a <b>net</b> <b>contributor</b> per capita {{to the federal government}}. It was Saskatchewan, another oil producer. In 1980 and 1981 Saskatchewan was a net per capita contributor to the federal government with their peak in 1981 at a mere $514 in comparison to Alberta's peak of $12,735 that same year, both values being 2004 inflation adjusted dollars. Thus, during the NEP years from 1980 to 1985 the province of Alberta was the sole overall <b>net</b> <b>contributor</b> to the federal government while all other provinces enjoyed being net recipients.|$|E

50|$|The {{impact of}} the 1995 {{enlargement}} was smaller than most as the members were wealthy and already culturally aligned with existing members. It did however create a Nordic block in the Council, with Sweden and Finland backing up Denmark on environmental and human rights issues (which Austria also backed up) and the Nordic countries also called for membership of the Baltic states. As <b>net</b> <b>contributors</b> to the EU budget, they also increased the voice for budgetary reform.|$|R

50|$|With Brexit, the EU {{would lose}} its second-largest economy, {{the country with}} the third-largest population.

50|$|Britain pays {{more into}} the EU budget than it receives. The net {{contribution}} figures range from £5.7 billion (2014) to £8.8 billion (2014/15) depending on sources and the time frame. In 2014, the UK was the third biggest <b>net</b> <b>contributor</b> to the EU budget, or the 8th highest by net contributions per head.|$|E
50|$|Thus, the {{departure}} of Britain would result in an additional financial burden for the remaining <b>net</b> <b>contributors,</b> unless the budget is reduced accordingly: Germany, for example, {{would have to pay}} an additional €4.5 billion for 2019 and again for 2020; in addition, the UK would no longer be a shareholder in the European Investment Bank, in which only EU members can participate. Britain's share amounts to 16%, €39.2 billion (2013), which Britain would withdraw unless there is an EU treaty change.|$|R
50|$|Several {{commentators}} {{have pointed out}} that the states that benefit the most by federal spending are the very states whose populations tend to vote for leaders who promise to reduce federal spending, while those that benefit the least from large government vote for politicians who promise to make it even larger at their expense. In other words, Democratic-leaning states tend to be <b>net</b> <b>contributors</b> to the federal budget while Republican-leaning states are more often net recipients of federal spending. Various explanations for this seemingly contradictory situation exist.|$|R
5000|$|Equalization {{payments}} do not, technically, involve wealthy provinces making {{payments to}} poor provinces, although in practice {{this is what}} happens, via the federal treasury.

40|$|This paper {{traces the}} main {{features}} of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), and of the transition process in the agricultural sectors of Central and Eastern European countries. We argue that currently the main challenge is to extend the CAP to the new members without upsetting the <b>net</b> <b>contributors</b> to the EU budget, and we analyse the effects of different schemes that would allow some cost sharing between EU and national budgets. The main conclusion is that the CAP for an enlarged Union {{should be based on}} decentralization of expenditures and a system of subsidies and transfers among countries. ...|$|R
5000|$|Equalization {{payments}} do {{not involve}} wealthy provinces making direct payments to poor provinces as the money comes from the federal treasury.

However, because of Alberta's greater population and wealth, the citizens of Alberta as a whole are <b>net</b> <b>contributors</b> to equalization, while the government of New Brunswick, therefore the citizens, are net receivers of equalization payments.|$|R
40|$|The {{majority}} of immigrants stay only temporarily {{in the host}} country. When many migrations are temporary, {{it is important to}} know who leaves and who stays, and why. The key questions for the host country are whether immigrants are <b>net</b> <b>contributors</b> to the welfare system and whether migrants assimilate quickly. The key questions for the home country are whether migrants return and who returns. The host country gains when unsuccessful migrants leave, while the home country may gain when successful migrants leave. Empirical evidence reveals that both low-income-earning and high-income-earning migrants leave the host country quite soon. Published: April 2015...|$|R

40|$|This paper investigates how the {{feasibility}} of migration affects governments' optimal fiscal policies. We assume that households migrate toward economies where their welfare is higher, governments choose taxes and public expenditures to maximize a weighted sum of the households' welfare, welfare is increasing in public expenditures, and only distortionary labor income taxes are available. In isolated economies, the optimal fiscal policy implies that some households are <b>net</b> fiscal <b>contributors,</b> while other households are net fiscal beneficiaries. When households can migrate, however, governments compete for the households which are <b>net</b> fiscal <b>contributors,</b> and modify the fiscal policy in their favor, lowering their taxes and net fiscal contribution, and increasing their welfare. The magnitude of the effect increases with the sensitivity of migration to welfare. In the limiting case of free mobility, all households are zero <b>net</b> fiscal <b>contributors.</b> As to the patterns of migration, the model predicts that, with high migration costs, all households migrate toward the same high-productivity countries, which benefits low-productivity households, whereas with low migration costs, households with different productivities migrate toward different countries, which benefits high-productivity households. ...|$|R
