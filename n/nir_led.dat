40|$|This {{dissertation}} develops biosensors {{for rapid}} detection of pathogens for environmental monitoring and food safety applications and utilizes the multidisciplinary and multi-application characteristics of biosensors {{to develop a}} lesson plan that can be implemented in secondary education classrooms. The detection methods evolve from particle immunoagglutination assay, PDMS optofluidic lab-on-a-chip, and spectrum analysis to smartphone and image analysis without any reagent; the potential application in secondary education also underlines the extended value of biosensors. In the first paper presented here, an optofluidic lab-on-a-chip system and subsequent sampling procedure were developed for detecting bacteria from soil samples utilizing Mie scattering detection of particle immunoagglutination assay. This system and protocol detected the presence of Escherichia coli K 12 from soil particles in near real-time (10 min) with a detection limit down to 1 CFU mL⁻¹ and {{has the potential to}} be implemented in the field. We also compared the interaction between E. coli and soil particles to the two-step protein-surface interaction. In the second paper, a smartphone-utilized biosensor consisting of a near-infrared (<b>NIR)</b> <b>LED</b> (wavelength of 880 nm) and a digital camera of a smartphone was developed for detecting microbial spoilage on ground beef, without using any reagents. The method was further improved by programming a smartphone application that allows the user to position the smartphone at an optimum distance and a range of angles utilizing its internal gyro sensor to measure a series of scatter intensities against the detection angle. This handheld device can be used as a preliminary screening tool to monitor microbial contamination on meat products. In the third paper, we designed a lesson plan for secondary education classrooms using biosensors as a core and branching out to different applications and fields of study with the goal of heightening students' interest and motivation toward attaining degrees and careers in STEM fields. Results revealed that the lesson was more effective in affecting younger students than older students, and more effective in teaching about the applications of biosensors than about the techniques of biosensor development...|$|E

In some visions of future operating rooms, however, this process is to be replaced by an automated system. We previously presented work for localizing near-surface veins via near-infrared (NIR) imaging in combination with structured light ranging for surface mapping and robotic guidance. In this paper, we describe experiments to determine the best NIR wavelengths to optimize vein contrast for physiological differences such as skin tone and/or the presence of hair on the arm or wrist surface.

40|$|A {{steerable}} low-noise {{source of}} illumination is described for shadow-sensors having a displacement sensitivity of ∼ 100 pm (rms) /√Hz, at 500 Hz, over a measuring span {{of at least}} ± 0. 5 mm. These sensors were designed to detect lateral "Violin-Mode" resonances in the highly tensioned fused-silica suspension fibres of the test-masses/mirrors for the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory gravitational wave detectors. The shadow sensors—one intended {{for each of the}} four fibres in a suspension—comprised a source of Near InfraRed (NIR) radiation (emitter) and a differential shadow-displacement sensor (detector), these bracketing the fibre under test. The suspension fibres themselves were approximately 600 mm long by 0. 4 mm in diameter, and when illuminated from the side, they cast narrow, vertical, shadows onto their respective detectors—these being located at an effective distance of 50 fibre diameters behind the axes of the fibres themselves. The emitter described here was designed to compensate for a significant degree of mechanical drift or creep over time in the mean position of its suspension fibre. This was achieved by employing five adjacent columns of 8 × miniature <b>NIR</b> <b>LEDs</b> (Light Emitting Diodes, λ = 890 nm), with one column being activated at a time. When used in conjunction with a "reverse Galilean" telescope, the LED sources allowed the collimated beam from the emitter to be steered azimuthally in fine angular increments (0. 65 ◦), causing the fibre's shadow to move laterally, in a step-wise manner, across the plane of its facing detector. Each step in shadow position was approximately 0. 23 mm in size, and this allowed the fibre's shadow to be re-centred, so as to bridge once again both elements of its photodiode detector—even if the fibre was off-centred by as much as ± 0. 5 mm. Re-centring allowed Violin-Mode vibrations of the fibre to be sensed once again as differential AC photocurrents, these flowing in anti-phase in the two elements of the "split-photodiode" detector.

30|$|The {{chemical}} and physical properties of 19 th and 20 th century Chinese papers were investigated {{using a variety}} of material characterisation methods. A reference collection of 178 Chinese papers, dating from 1799 to 1990 was used, and properties such as pH, degree of polymerisation (DP), lignin content, and tensile strength (zero-span) were determined. Most of the papers were of approximately neutral pH, had a low lignin content and DP similar to pre- 19 th century European rag paper. It was found that the high inhomogeneity and the typical paper thinness affected tensile testing and as a result, a modified method for zero-span tensile strength test was developed. Using near infrared spectroscopy (NIR), proof-of-concept partial least squares (PLS) applications were developed for determination of tensile strength, pH, DP and for dating of the samples. For the latter, using post- 1900 papers, the error of cross validation was 13  years. The presence of lignin was modelled using linear discriminant analysis (LDA), where the model could distinguish between high and low lignin content with 88 % accuracy. Using one or multiple sheets for transmission <b>NIR</b> spectroscopy <b>led</b> to PLS results of similar quality, which was attributed to material inhomogeneity.|$|R
40|$|Methods for {{efficient}} {{detachment of}} cells avoiding damage are required in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. We introduce a bottom-up approach to build plasmonic substrates using micellar block copolymer nanolithography {{to generate a}} 2 D array of Au seeds, followed by chemical growth leading to anisotropic nanoparticles. The resulting plasmonic substrates show a broad plasmon band covering a wide part of the visible and near-infrared (NIR) spectral ranges. Both human and murine cells were successfully grown on the substrates. A simple functionalization step of the plasmonic substrates with the cyclic arginylglycylaspartic acid (c-RGD) peptide allowed us to tune the morphology of integrin-rich human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). Subsequent irradiation with a <b>NIR</b> laser <b>led</b> to highly efficient detachment of the cells with cell viability confirmed using the MTT assay. We thus propose {{the use of such}} plasmonic substrates for cell growth and controlled detachment using remote near-IR irradiation, as a general method for cell culture in biomedical applications. Cell harvesting: Tailored plasmonic substrates can be used to capture various types of cells, which can be further released by irradiation with near-infrared (NIR) light without being damaged.

In this paper we demonstrate that PTT in a murine melanoma model using gold nanorods (GNRs) and near-infrared (NIR) light decreases tumor volume and increases animal survival to an extent that {{is comparable to the}} current generation of melanoma drugs. GNRs, in particular, have shown a strong ability to reach ablative temperatures quickly in tumors when exposed to NIR light. The current research tests the efficacy of GNRs PTT in a difficult and fast growing murine melanoma model using a <b>NIR</b> light-emitting diode (<b>LED)</b> light source.

40|$|The Marsokhod 1999 field {{experiment}} in the Mojave Desert included a simulation of a rover-based sample selection mission. As part of this mission, a test was made of strategies and analytical techniques for identifying past or present life in environments expected to be present on Mars. A combination of visual clues from high-resolution images and the detection of an important biomolecule (chlorophyll) with visible/near-infrared (<b>NIR)</b> spectroscopy <b>led</b> to the successful identification of a rock with evidence of cryptoendolithic organisms. The sample was identified in high-resolution images (3 times {{the resolution of the}} Imager for Mars Pathfinder camera) {{on the basis of a}} green tinge and textural information suggesting the presence of a thin, partially missing exfoliating layer revealing the organisms. The presence of chlorophyll bands in similar samples was observed in visible/NIR spectra of samples in the field and later confirmed in the laboratory using the same spectrometer. Raman spectroscopy in the laboratory, simulating a remote measurement technique, also detected evidence of carotenoids in samples from the same area. Laboratory analysis confirmed that the subsurface layer of the rock is inhabited by a community of coccoid Chroococcidioposis cyanobacteria. The identification of minerals in the field, including carbonates and serpentine, that are associated with aqueous processes was also demonstrated using the visible/NIR spectrometer. Other lessons learned that are applicable to future rover missions include the benefits of web-based programs for target selection and for daily mission planning and the need for involvement of the science team in optimizing image compression schemes based on the retention of visual signature characteristics...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{present the}} first {{complete}} infrared spectrum of a molecular cloud core covering the wavelength region from 2. 4 up to 200 µm {{together with a}} map at 1. 3 mm wavelength and near-infrared (NIR) images. The core {{is located in the}} northern part of M 17 and shows strong evidence for on-going star formation. These data are the first step towards a complete characterization of M 17 -North. The spectrum has been obtained with the Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) using the short- and long-wavelength spectrometers (SWS/LWS) with a resolution from 150 to 300. The spectrum of the core displays the unidentified infrared bands (UIBs). The continuum is rising rapidly for wavelengths larger than 15 µm which is typical for objects with stronger UV radiation fields. This continuum is probably produced by the emission from very small grains (VSGs) heated transiently. Many low-excitation fine structure lines were detected which are typical for the emission from an H ii region. They are produced by an electron gas with a density and temperature of about 100 cm− 3 and 5000 K, respectively. The mapping of the continuum radiation at 1. 3 mm revealed the presence of a compact cloud core, whereas <b>NIR</b> imaging <b>led</b> to the detection of embedded IR objects. The observed spectral energy distribution (SED) is used to model the cloud core emission with radiative transfer (RT) calculations including the emission from VSGs. This calculation shows that the cloud core is mainly heated by an outer radiation field but needs an additional inner heating source with a luminosity of about 8000 L⊙ to explain the measurements...|$|R
40|$|Context. With {{the latest}} {{infrared}} surveys, {{the number of}} massive protostellar candidates has increased significantly. New studies have posed additional questions on important issues about the formation, evolution, and other phenomena related to them. Complementary to infrared data, radio observations are a good tool to study {{the nature of these}} objects, and to diagnose the formation stage. Aims. Here we study the far-infrared source IRAS 16353 - 4636 with the aim of understanding its nature and origin. In particular, we search for young stellar objects (YSOs), possible outflow structure, and the presence of non-thermal emission. Methods. Using high-resolution, multi-wavelength radio continuum data obtained with the Australia Telescope Compact Array, we image IRAS 16353 - 4636 and its environment from 1. 4 to 19. 6 GHz, and derive the distribution of the spectral index at maximum angular resolution. We also present new JHKs photometry and spectroscopy data obtained at ESO NTT. 13 CO and archival HI line data, and infrared databases (MSX, GLIMPSE, MIPSGal) are also inspected. Results. The radio continuum emission associated with IRAS 16353 - 4636 was found to be extended (~ 10 arcsec), with a bow-shaped morphology above 4. 8 GHz, and a strong peak persistent at all frequencies. The <b>NIR</b> photometry <b>led</b> us to identify ten near-IR sources and classify them according to their color. We used the HI line data to derive the source distance, and analyzed the kinematical information from the CO and NIR lines detected. Conclusions. We have identified the source IRAS 16353 - 4636 as a new protostellar cluster. In this cluster we recognized three distinct sources: a low-mass YSO, a high-mass YSOs, and a mildly confined region of intense and non-thermal radio emission. We propose the latter corresponds to the terminal part of an outflow. Comment: To appear in A&A. 10 pages, 8 figure...|$|R

40|$|Venous and {{arterial}} access {{are among}} the most widespread medical procedures performed in children. Especially in young children venous and arterial access can be problematic due to tiny blood vessels that are difficult to localize beneath a layer of baby fat. This thesis describes the development and clinical evaluation of the VascuLuminator, a guidance tool for peripheral venous and arterial access by visualizing blood vessels underneath the skin with near-infrared light. In a third to a fifth of the pediatric patients, more than one attempt is required for a successful intravenous cannulation. Arterial cannulation is successful in one attempt in only 20 % of the patients. To facilitate localization of blood vessels, near-infrared light can be used to visualize blood vessels underneath the skin. Based on this knowledge, we developed a device (the VascuLuminator) to facilitate peripheral access to the blood vessels. The VascuLuminator consists of a <b>NIR</b> emitting <b>LED</b> which is placed underneath the puncture site. The light, absorbed by blood and scattered by other tissue, is processed by a NIR-sensitive camera. An LCD display shows an image of the blood vessels as dark lines against a light background of tissue. The VascuLuminator was able to visualize blood vessels in most patients, and was clinically useful in venipunctures. There was a tendency to an increase in success at first attempt in arterial cannulation with the VascuLuminator. However, the VascuLuminator was not clinically beneficial for intravenous cannulation in a general pediatric population. Only in children with a dark skin and anticipated as difficult to cannulate, the VascuLuminator increased success at first attempt. Further research is required to affirm or refute clinical effectiveness of the VascuLuminator in this specific population. The main problem with difficult peripheral venous and arterial access is advancement of the cannula into the vessel, rather than localizing the vessel. Future research should focus on methods to facilitate successful cannula advancement within the vesse...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Improvements in {{high-throughput}} phenotyping {{technologies are}} rapidly expanding {{the scope and}} capacity of plant biology studies to measure growth traits. Nevertheless, the costs of commercial phenotyping equipment and infrastructure remain prohibitively expensive for wide-scale uptake, while academic solutions can require significant local expertise. Here we present a low-cost methodology for plant biologists {{to build their own}} phenotyping system for quantifying growth rates and phenotypic characteristics of Arabidopsis thaliana rosettes throughout the diel cycle. Results We constructed an image capture system consisting of a near infra-red (<b>NIR,</b> 940  nm) <b>LED</b> panel with a mounted Raspberry Pi NoIR camera and developed a MatLab-based software module (iDIEL Plant) to characterise rosette expansion. Our software was able to accurately segment and characterise multiple rosettes within an image, regardless of plant arrangement or genotype, and batch process image sets. To further validate our system, wild-type Arabidopsis plants (Col- 0) and two mutant lines with reduced Rubisco contents, pale leaves and slow growth phenotypes (1 a 3 b and 1 a 2 b) were grown on a single plant tray. Plants were imaged from 9 to 24  days after germination every 20  min throughout the 24  h light–dark growth cycle (i. e. the diel cycle). The resulting dataset provided a dynamic and uninterrupted characterisation of differences in rosette growth and expansion rates over time for the three lines tested. Conclusion Our methodology offers a straightforward solution for setting up automated, scalable and low-cost phenotyping facilities {{in a wide range of}} lab environments that could greatly increase the processing power and scalability of Arabidopsis soil growth experiments...|$|R
40|$|The {{efficient}} {{treatment of}} cancer with chemotherapy is {{challenged by the}} limited penetration of drugs into the tumor. Nanoparticles (10 – 100 nanometers) have emerged as a logical choice to specifically deliver chemotherapeutics to tumors, however, their transport into the tumor is also impeded owing to their bigger size compared to free drug moieties. Currently, monolayer cell cultures, as models for drug testing, cannot recapitulate the structural and functional complexity of in-vivo tumors. Furthermore, strategies to improve drug distribution in tumor tissues are also required. In this study, we hypothesized that hyperthermia (43 °C) will improve the distribution of silica nanoparticles in three-dimensional multicellular tumor spheroids. Tumor spheroids mimic the functional and histomorphological complexity of in-vivo avascular tumors and are therefore valuable tools to study drug distribution. Ovarian cancer (Skov 3) and uterine sarcoma (MES-SA/Dx 5) spheroids were generated using the liquid overlay method. The growth ratio and cytotoxicity assays showed that the application of adjuvant hyperthermia with Doxorubicin (DOX) did not yield higher cell killing compared to DOX therapy alone. These results illustrated the role of spheroids in resistance to heat and DOX. In order to study the cellular uptake kinetics of nanoparticles under hyperthermia conditions, the experimental measurements of silica nanoparticle uptake by cells were fitted using a novel inverse estimation method based on Bayesian estimation. This was coupled with advection reaction transport to model nanoparticle transport in spheroids. The model predicted an increase in Area Under the Curve (AUC) and penetration distance (W 1 / 2) that were validated with in-vitro experiments in spheroids. Based on these observations, a novel multifunctional theranostic nanoparticle probe was created for generating highly localized hyperthermia by encapsulating a Near Infrared (NIR) dye, IR 820 (for imaging and hyperthermia) and DOX in Organically modified silica nanoparticles (Ormosil). Pegylated Ormosil nanoparticles had an average diameter of 58. 2 ± 3. 1 nm, zeta potential of - 6. 9 ± 0. 1 mV and high colloidal stability in physiological buffers. Exposure of the IR 820 within the nanoparticles to <b>NIR</b> laser <b>led</b> to the generation of hyperthermia as well as release of DOX which translated to higher cell killing in Skov 3 cells, deeper penetration of DOX into spheroids and complete destruction of the spheroids. In-vivo bio-distribution studies showed higher fluorescence from organs and increased plasma elimination life of IR 820 compared to free IR 820. However, possible aggregation of particles on laser exposure and accumulation in lungs still remain a concern...|$|R
40|$|We {{studied the}} {{diversity}} of Chloroflexus-like bacteria (CLB) in a hypersaline phototrophic microbial mat and assayed their near-infrared (NIR) light-dependent oxygen respiration rates. PCR with primers that were reported to specifically target the 16 S rRNA gene {{from members of the}} phylum Chloroflexi resulted in the recovery of 49 sequences and 16 phylotypes (sequences of the same phylotype share more than 96 % similarity), and 10 of the sequences (four phylotypes) appeared to be related to filamentous anoxygenic phototrophic members of the family Chloroflexaceae. Photopigment analysis revealed the presence of bacteriochlorophyll c (BChlc), BChld, and γ-carotene, pigments known to be produced by phototrophic CLB. Oxygen microsensor measurements for intact mats revealed a NIR (710 to 770 nm) light-dependent decrease in aerobic respiration, a phenomenon that we also observed in an axenic culture of Chloroflexus aurantiacus. The metabolic ability of phototrophic CLB to switch from anoxygenic photosynthesis under NIR illumination to aerobic respiration under non-NIR illumination was further used to estimate the contribution of these organisms to mat community respiration. Steady-state oxygen profiles under dark conditions and in the presence of visible (VIS) light (400 to 700 nm), NIR light (710 to 770 nm), and VIS light plus NIR light were compared. <b>NIR</b> light illumination <b>led</b> to a substantial increase in the oxygen concentration in the mat. The observed impact on oxygen dynamics shows that CLB {{play a significant role in}} the cycling of carbon in this hypersaline microbial mat ecosystem. This study further demonstrates that the method applied, a combination of microsensor techniques and VIS and NIR illumination, allows rapid establishment of the presence and significance of CLB in environmental samples...|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} I {{focus on the}} results of the data modelings and {{simulations}} of near-infrared (NIR) observations of the Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*) counterpart associated with the super-massive black hole at the Galactic Center (GC). My goal is to investigate and understand the physical processes behind the variability associated with the NIR flaring emission from Sgr A*. The NIR observations have been carried out using the NACO adaptive optics (AO) instrument at the European Southern Observatory's (ESO's) Very Large Telescope (VLT) and the CIAO NIR camera on the Subaru telescope (13 June 2004, 30 July 2005, 1 June 2006, 15 May 2007, 17 May 2007 and 28 May 2008). I used a model of synchrotron emission from relativistic electrons in the inner parts of an accretion disk. The relativistic simulations have been carried out using the Karas-Yaqoob (KY) ray-tracing code. I also probed the existence of a correlation between the modulations of the observed flux density light curves and changes in polarimetric data. Furthermore, I confirmed that the same correlation is also predicted by the so-called hot spot model. Correlations between intensity and polarimetric parameters of the observed light curves, as well as a comparison of predicted and observed light curve features through a pattern recognition algorithm result in the detection of a signature of orbiting matter under the influence of strong gravity. This pattern is proved to be statistically significant against randomly polarized red noise. The observed correlations between flux modulations and changes in linear polarization degree and angle can be a sign that the NIR flares have properties that are not expected from purely random red-noise. I found that the geometric shape of the emitting region {{plays a major role in}} the predictions of the model. From fully relativistic simulations of a spiral shaped emitting region, I concluded that the observed swings in polarization angle during NIR flares support the idea of compact orbiting spots instead of extended patterns. The effects of gravitational shearing, fast synchrotron cooling of the components, and confusion from a variable accretion disk have been taken into account. Furthermore, I discussed the expected results from future observations of VLT interferometry (VLTI) like the GRAVITY experiment. Simulated centroids of <b>NIR</b> images <b>led</b> me to the conclusion that a clear observation of position wander of the center of NIR images with future infrared interferometers will prove the existence of orbiting hot spots in the vicinity of our Galactic super-massive black hole. Finally, I described a novel approach to constrain the physical parameters of the Galactic black hole by using time resolved NIR polarimetric observations. Even though basically the method is developed for Sgr A*, it can be used to test intrinsic properties of several types of compact objects with QPO behavior...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: NIR was {{identified}} as an inhibitor of histone acetyltransferase and it represses transcriptional activation of p 53. NIR is predominantly localized in the nucleolus and known as Noc 2 p, which {{is involved in the}} maturation of the 60 S ribosomal subunit. However, how NIR functions in the nucleolus remains undetermined. In the nucleolus, a 47 S ribosomal RNA precursor (pre-rRNA) is transcribed and processed to produce 18 S, 5. 8 S and 28 S rRNAs. The 18 S rRNA is incorporated into the 40 S ribosomal subunit, whereas the 28 S and 5. 8 S rRNAs are incorporated into the 60 S subunit. U 3 small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) directs 18 S rRNA processing and U 8 snoRNA mediates processing of 28 S and 5. 8 S rRNAs. Functional disruption of nucleolus often causes p 53 activation to inhibit cell proliferation. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Western blotting showed that NIR is ubiquitously expressed in different human cell lines. Knock-down of <b>NIR</b> by siRNA <b>led</b> to inhibition of the 18 S, 28 S and 5. 8 S rRNAs evaluated by pulse-chase experiment. Pre-rRNA particles (pre-rRNPs) were fractionated from the nucleus by sucrose gradient centrifugation and analysis of the pre-RNPs components showed that NIR existed in the pre-RNPs of both the 60 S and 40 S subunits and co-fractionated with 32 S and 12 S pre-rRNAs in the 60 S pre-rRNP. Protein-RNA binding experiments demonstrated that NIR is associated with the 32 S pre-rRNA and U 8 snoRNA. In addition, NIR bound U 3 snoRNA. It is a novel finding that depletion of NIR did not affect p 53 protein level but de-repressed acetylation of p 53 and activated p 21. CONCLUSIONS: We provide the first evidence for a transcriptional repressor to function in the rRNA biogenesis of both the 40 S and 60 S subunits. Our findings also suggested that a nucleolar protein may alternatively signal to p 53 by affecting the p 53 modification rather than affecting p 53 protein level...|$|R
