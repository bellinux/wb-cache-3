40|$|This study {{demonstrates}} a vegetation mapping methodology that relates the reflectance {{information contained in}} multispectral imagery to traditionally accepted ecological classifications. Key elements of the approach used are (a) the use of cover rather than density or presence/absence to quantify the vegetation, (b) the inclusion of physical components as well as vegetation cover to describe and classify field sites, (c) development of an objective land cover classification from this quantitative data, (d) use of the field sample sites as training areas for the spectral classification, and (e) {{the use of a}} discriminant function to effectively tie the two classifications together. Land cover over 39000 ha of Australian chenopod shrubland was classified into nine groups using agglomerative hierarchical clustering, a discriminant function developed to relate cover and spectral classes, and the vegetation mapped using a maximum likelihood classification of multi-date Landsat TM imagery. The accuracy of the mapping was assessed with an independent set of field samples and by comparison with a map of land systems previously interpreted from aerial photography. Overall agreement between the digital classification and the land system map was good. The units that have been mapped are those derived from <b>numeric</b> vegetation <b>classification,</b> demonstrating that accepted ecological methods and sound image analysis can be successfully combined.

40|$|In this paper, {{we apply}} various data mining {{techniques}} including continuous <b>numeric</b> and discrete <b>classification</b> prediction models of base oils biodegradability, {{with emphasis on}} improving prediction accuracy. The results show that highly biodegradable oils can be better predicted through numeric models. In contrast, classification models did not uncover a similar dichotomy. With the exception of Memory Based Reasoning and Decision Trees, tested classification techniques achieved high classification prediction. However, the technique of Decision Trees helped uncover the most significant predictors. A simple classification rule derived based on this predictor resulted in good classification accuracy. The application of this rule enables efficient classification of base oils into either low or high biodegradability classes with high accuracy. For the latter, a higher precision biodegradability prediction can be obtained using continuous modeling techniques...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Producing {{estimates}} of classification confidence is surprisingly difficult. One {{might expect that}} classifiers that can produce <b>numeric</b> <b>classification</b> scores (e. g. k-Nearest Neighbour or Naive Bayes) could readily produce confidence estimates based on thresholds. In fact, this proves {{not to be the}} case, probably because these are not probabilistic classifiers in the strict sense. The numeric scores coming from k-Nearest Neighbour or Naive Bayes classifiers are not well correlated with classification confidence. In this paper we describe a case-based spam filtering application that would benefit significantly from an ability to attach confidence predictions to positive classifications (i. e. messages classified as spam). We show that ‘obvious ’ confidence metrics for a case-based classifier are not effective. We propose an ensemble-like solution that aggregates a collection of confidence metrics and show that this offers an effective solution in this spam filtering domain. ...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of a study of cyanobacteria and green algae assemblages occurring in various tundra types determined on the basis of mosses and vascular plants and habitat conditions. The research was carried out during summer in the years 2009 - 2013 on the north sea-coast of Hornsund fjord (West Spitsbergen, Svalbard Archipelago). 58 sites were studied in various tundra types differing in composition of vascular plants, mosses and in trophy and humidity. 141 cyanobacteria and green algae were noted in the research area in total. Cyanobacteria and green algae flora is a significant element of many tundra types and sometimes even dominate there.

40|$|Abstract—Researchers {{have embraced}} {{a variety of}} machine {{learning}} (ML) techniques {{in their efforts to}} improve the quality of learning programs. The recent evolution of hybrid architectures for machine learning systems has resulted in several approaches that combine rule-induction methods with case-based reasoning techniques to engender performance improvements over more-traditional one-representation architectures. We briefly survey several major rule-induction and case-based reasoning ML systems. We then examine some interesting hybrid combinations of these systems, and explain their strengths and weaknesses as learning systems. We present a balanced approach to constructing a hybrid architecture, along with arguments in favor of this balance and mechanisms for achieving a proper balance. Finally, we present some initial empirical results from testing our ideas and draw some conclusions based on those results.

40|$|Indexing {{of cases}} is an {{important}} topic for MemoryBased Reasoning(MBR). One key problem is how to assign weights to attributes of cases. Although several weighting methods have been proposed, some methods cannot handle numeric attributes directly, so {{it is necessary to}} discretize <b>numeric</b> values by <b>classification.</b> Furthermore, existing methods have no theoretical background, so little can be said about optimality. We propose a new weighting method based on a statistical technique called Quantification Method II. It can handle both numeric and symbolic attributes in the same framework. Generated attribute weights are optimal {{in the sense that they}} maximize the ratio of variance between classes to variance of all cases. Experiments on several benchmark tests show that in many cases, our method obtains higher accuracies than some other weighting methods. The results also indicate that it can distinguish relevant attributes from irrelevant ones, and can tolerate noisy data. Introduction In [...] ...|$|R

The primiparous cows show about 3. 2 BCS points at calving, their BCS decreases slightly during first 90 milking days but, after this period, the BCS increases until 3. 5 BCS points at the end of first lactation. Sires with larger EBVs guarantee a slower decrease of BCS during the first part of lactation, which is preferred to the strong decrease exhibited by the daughter of low EBV sires. The pseudo-genetic correlations, correlations values estimated among EBV, confirmed the relationships between BCS and other important traits like milk yield (- 0. 20), final score, dairyness and udder.

The {{study was conducted in}} 44 communities equitably distributed among 22 towns (populations) and geographically widespread in the 10 phytodistricts of Benin. Per population, at least 30 individuals of the species spaced at least 20 meters apart were randomly selected for the collection of morphological data. In total, 840 individuals, 714 leaves, 2294 fruits and 3465 seeds of Jatropha curcas were measured in all the country. The part of the variability of Jatropha curcas morphological traits due to individual, populations, phytodistricts, climatic zones were determined using the variance component analysis. The stepwise discriminant analysis was performed on Jatropha curcas populations to identify the morphological traits which discriminate them and the <b>numeric</b> <b>classification</b> was realized to regroup Jatropha curcas populations. The results show that variability of Jatropha curcas morphological traits is generally larger at individual level or between individuals of the same population than between populations, phytodistricts and climatic zones except fruits and seeds weight whose variability is larger between populations.

40|$|ABSTRACT Objective. Evaluate the {{acid-base balance}} (ABB) in bovines with diarrheic {{backgrounds}} in four areas of Montería, Colombia. Materials and methods. From {{a total of}} 300 pregnant cows, 60 were selected with their newborns. A direct inspection was performed of vital signs on the calves and the ABB indicators were determined using a gasometric method. Data were processed by means of descriptive statistics and the Duncan {{test was used to}} differentiate between the averages. The degree of association was established between the ABB indicators in cows and calves by using the Pearson correlation and a comparison of proportions was performed on the indexes of the newborns. Results. Regarding the cows, the ABB indicators were found within the reference values; however, in the calves the pH, pCO 2, HCO 3 -, the anion gap (AG) and the bases excess (BE) varied. A correlation was found between AG, BE and metabolic hydrogen ions (M*H). The AG in cows and calves showed notable differences (p< 0. 05) among the farms in the study. According to the <b>numeric</b> <b>classification</b> system, the suction reflect indicated a greater percentage of calves in group one. Conclusions. The ABB analyte measurement in cows was similar to the consulted reference; however, in calves some analytes did not coincide. This suggests metabolic acidosis in newborn calves due to the increase of AG and the decrease of BE. Additionally, its correlation with M*H opens the possibility of new proposals to determine ABB in bovines...|$|E
40|$|Algorithms for <b>numeric</b> data <b>classification</b> {{have been}} applied for text classification. Usually the vector space model is used to {{represent}} text collections. The characteristics of this representation such as sparsity and high dimensionality sometimes impair the quality of general-purpose classifiers. Networks {{can be used to}} represent text collections, avoiding the high sparsity and allowing to model relationships among different objects that compose a text collection. Such network-based representations can improve the quality of the classification results. One of the simplest ways to represent textual collections by a network is through a bipartite heterogeneous network, which is composed of objects that represent the documents connected to objects that represent the terms. Heterogeneous bipartite networks do not require computation of similarities or relations among the objects and can be used to model any type of text collection. Due to the advantages of representing text collections through bipartite heterogeneous networks, in this article we present a text classifier which builds a classification model using the structure of a bipartite heterogeneous network. Such an algorithm, referred to as IMBHN (Inductive Model Based on Bipartite Heterogeneous Network), induces a classification model assigning weights to objects that represent the terms for each class of the text collection. An empirical evaluation using a large amount of text collections from different domains shows that the proposed IMBHN algorithm produces significantly better results than k-NN, C 4. 5, SVM, and Naive Bayes algorithms.

50|$|Initially {{candidates}} were only awarded a {{pass or fail}} classification, though the independent exam boards soon offered competing <b>numeric</b> and alphabetic <b>classifications,</b> for example 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 would be a pass, while grades 7, 8 and 9 were fails from the JMB. From 1975 standardized alphabetic grades where introduced with grades A, B, C, D, and E were passes, and f and U (Unclassified) were fails. Between 1965 and 1985 grades were allocated primarily on a norm-referenced basis, assigning a fixed proportion of each cohort to each grade (A 10%, B 15%, C 25-30%, D 5-10%, E 5-10%, U 15-20%). Though some exceptions existed, both at the subject and Exam Board level, with Latin and Greek pass rates being consistently higher than other subjects, with 75.4% passing in 1976, in contrast to an average 59% pass rate across all subjects e.g. Biology 56.4%, History 57%. The pass rate and top awards by the Oxford & Cambridge board were also consistently higher than the other boards e.g. In 1976, 27% of Latin entrants gained an A, and ~17% of French, German and Music candidates, this was attributed to the O&C board being primarily used by the Independent schools. The proportion obtaining a pass, A-D, or equivalent was initially fixed at 57% - 58%, and remained under 60% through the 1970s, though there was regional variation with Northern Ireland awarding consistently more pass grades than Wales e.g. In 1982, the pass rates were: Northern Ireland 62%, England 58% Wales 53%. In 1984 a decision was taken, by the Secondary Examinations Council, to replace the norm referencing with criteria referencing, where 16+ and 18+ grades would in future be awarded on Examiner Judgement, this change was implemented, at O-Level, in June 1986. In the final year DES statistics were available 6.8% achieved an A, and 39.8% an A-C grade.|$|R

MÉTODOS: Incluídos 50 pacientes com cirrose alcoólica, diagnosticada por biópsia ou critérios clínico-bioquímicos, excluídos aqueles com hepatocarcinoma ou hemorragia digestiva, infecção ou ingestão alcoólica continuada nos últimos 30 dias. A idade média do grupo foi 51, 3 ± 12, 6 anos, 72 % deles do sexo masculino e classificados 17 como Child-Pugh A, 18 como B e 15 como C. Os valores das bilirrubinas foram dosados pelo método automatizado, eletroforese de proteínas em acetato de celulose e o tempo de protrombina pelo método de Quick. A FN plasmática foi dosada por imunodifusão radial, com anticorpos contra FN humana em géis de agarose a 1 %. RESULTADOS: Um paciente foi excluído por óbito de causa não natural e 12 foram a óbito por doença hepática. Os melhores preditores de óbito foram a pontuação de Child-Pugh [escore> 10, risco relativo (RR) de 11, 33) e os valores de bilirrubina (> 2, 5 mg/dL, RR= 9, 47). A concentração de FN foi significantemente maior nos sobreviventes que naqueles que foram a óbito (185 ± 66 mg/L x 131 ± 38 mg/L, p 165 mg/L foram melhores indicadores de sobrevida que a classificação de Child-Pugh e seus parâmetros bioquímicos isolados.

In this region, 15 pastures were selected to characterize species composition of isolated trees, {{as well as to}} describe species composition, growth form patterns, and patterns of dispersal units in the vegetation growing under their canopies. The 65 recorded pasture trees belonged to 20 species and 11 families, of which Fabaceae and Moraceae were the most species-rich. Coccoloba barbadensis (Polygonaceae) and Enterolobium cyclocarpum (Fabaceae) were the most abundant and frequent trees in the studied pastures. More than half (55 %) of isolated tree species were fleshy-fruited. In the vegetation sampled under pasture trees, 134 species and 45 families were found. Fabaceae and Poaceae had the largest numbers of species. Herbs were the predominant growth form (46. 3 %), followed by shrubs (23. 9 %), trees (23. 1 %), and lianas (2. 2 %); 6 species could nor be placed in any growth form category. Most species of this flora were fleshy-fruited (43. 3 %), followed by heavy, gravity-dispersed fruits (17. 9 %). The analysis of dispersal units by growth form category confirmed the prevalence of fleshy fruits, although their predominance was not so obvious among herb species. Almost half (49. 2 %) of the flora under pasture trees was typical of secondary vegetation this pattern was true for herbs but not for most woody species, which were typical of primary vegetation. A <b>numeric</b> <b>classification</b> of the vegetation samples taken under pasture trees produced eight floristic groups, all of which were independent of the specific identity of pasture trees.

40|$|Aim To {{develop a}} {{systematic}} and generic framework for biogeographical regionalizations that {{can assist in}} reconciling different approaches and advance their application as a research tool. Location The Australian continent {{is used as a}} case study. Methods A review of approaches to biogeographical regionalization revealed two basic methodologies: the integrated survey method and the parametric approach. To help reconcile these different approaches, we propose a simple, four-step, flexible and generic framework. (1) Identification of the thematic foci from the three main themes (composition and evolutionary legacy; ecosystem drivers; ecosystem responses). (2) Proposal of a theory defining the purpose. (3) Application of a <b>numeric</b> agglomerative <b>classification</b> procedure that requires the user to make explicit assumptions about attributes, the number of classification groups, the spatial unit of analysis, and the metric for measuring the similarity of these units based on their attribute values. (4) Acquisition of spatial estimates of the required input attribute data. For this case study, an agglomerative classification strategy was applied using the functions within patn 3. 03, a software package facilitating large-scale, multivariate pattern analysis. The input data to the classifications were continental coverages of 11 environmental variables and three indices of gross primary productivity stored at a grid cell resolution of c. 250 m. The spatial units of analysis were surface hydrological units (SHU), which were derived from a continental digital elevation model based on the contributing areas to stream segments or the area draining into a local sink where there is no organized drainage. The Minkowski series (Euclidean distance) was selected as the association measure to allow weightings to be applied to the variables. Results Two new biogeographical regionalizations of the Australian continent were generated. The first was an environmental domain classification, based on 11 climatic, terrain and soil attributes. This regionalization can be used to address hypotheses about the relationship between environmental distance and evolutionary processes. The classification produced 151 environmental groups. The second was a classification of primary productivity regimes based on estimates of the gross primary productivity of the vegetation cover calculated from moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data and estimates of radiation. This classification produced 50 groups, and can be used to examine hypotheses concerning productivity regimes and animal life-history strategies. The productivity classification does not capture all the properties related to biological carrying capacity, process rates and differences in the characteristic biodiversity of ecosystems. Some of these ecologically significant properties are captured by the environmental domain classification. Main conclusions Our framework can be applied to all terrestrial regions, and the necessary data for the analyses presented here are now available at global scales. As the spatial predictions generated by the classifications can be tested by comparison with independent data, the approach facilitates exploratory analysis and further hypothesis generation. Integration of the three themes in our framework will contribute to a more comprehensive approach to biogeography. No Full Tex...|$|R
