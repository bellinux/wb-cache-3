40|$|Interactive free {{viewpoint}} video {{offers the}} possibility for each user to independently choose the views of a 3 D scene to be displayed at the decoder. The visual content is commonly represented by N tex-ture and depth map pairs that capture different viewpoints. A server selects an appropriate subset of M ≤ N views for transmission, so that the user can freely navigate in the corresponding window of viewpoints without being affected by network delay. During nav-igation, a user can synthesize any intermediate virtual view image in the <b>navigation</b> <b>window</b> via depth-image-based rendering (DIBR) using two nearby camera views as references. When the available bandwidth {{is too small to}} transmit all camera views typically used to synthesize views in the <b>navigation</b> <b>window,</b> we propose to synthesize intermediate virtual views as new references for transmission—a re-sampling of viewpoints for the 3 D scene—so that the synthesized view distortion within the <b>navigation</b> <b>window</b> is minimized. We for-mulate a combinatorial optimization problem to find the best set of M virtual views to synthesize as new references, and show that the problem is NP-hard. We approximate the original problem with a new reference view equivalence model and derive in this case an op-timal dynamic programming algorithm to determine the best set of M views to be transmitted to each user. Experimental results show that synthesizing virtual views as new references for client-side view synthesis can outperform simple selection from camera views by up to 0. 73 dB in synthesized view quality.

40|$|International audienceWe {{consider}} an interactive multiview video streaming (IMVS) system where clients select their preferred viewpoint {{in a given}} <b>navigation</b> <b>window.</b> To provide high quality IMVS, many high quality views should be transmitted to the clients. However, {{this is not always}} possible due to the limited and heterogeneous capabilities of the clients. In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive IMVS solution based on a layered multiview representation where camera views are organized into layered subsets to match the different clients constraints. We formulate an optimization problem for the joint selection of the views subsets and their encoding rates. Then, we propose an optimal and a reduced computational complexity greedy algorithms, both based on dynamic-programming. Simulation results show the good performance of our novel algorithms compared to a baseline algorithm, proving that an effective IMVS adaptive solution should consider the scene content and the client capabilities and their preferences in navigation...|$|E

The {{response}} of the Apalachicola River and Bay to sudden, relatively large changes in stage and flow due to navigation windows on the ACF system is examined using data collected over the summer of 1993 and a one-dimensional (river) hydrodynamic model. Of interest is the change in salinity in the East Bay portion of Apalachicola Bay {{as a function of}} changes in river flows. The summer of 1993 encompassed five navigation windows. The river model indicated that flow patterns associated with a <b>navigation</b> <b>window</b> were maintained through the distributaries and data from salinity stations in East Bay indicated freshwater pulses caused by these navigation windows modified the salinity structure of this portion of the estuary over both short and long term time scales.

40|$|To enable Interactive {{multiview}} video {{systems with}} a minimum view-switching delay, multiple camera views are sent to the users, which are used as reference images to synthesize additional virtual views via depth-image-based rendering. In practice, bandwidth constraints may however restrict the number of reference views sent to clients per time unit, which may in turn limit {{the quality of the}} synthesized viewpoints. We argue that the reference view selection should ideally be performed close to the users, and we study the problem of in-network reference view synthesis such that the navigation quality is maximized at the clients. We consider a distributed cloud network architecture where data stored in a main cloud is delivered to end users with the help of cloudlets, i. e., resource-rich proxies close to the users. In order to satisfy last-hop bandwidth constraints from the cloudlet to the users, a cloudlet re-samples viewpoints of the 3 D scene into a discrete set of views (combination of received camera views and virtual views synthesized) to be used as reference for the synthesis of additional virtual views at the client. This in-network synthesis leads to better viewpoint sampling given a bandwidth constraint compared to simple selection of camera views, but it may however carry a distortion penalty in the cloudlet-synthesized reference views. We therefore cast a new reference view selection problem where the best subset of views is defined as the one minimizing the distortion over a view <b>navigation</b> <b>window</b> defined by the user under some transmission bandwidth constraints. We show that the view selection problem is NP-hard, and propose an effective polynomial time algorithm using dynamic programming to solve the optimization problem. Simulation results finally confirm the performance gain offered by virtual view synthesis in the network...|$|E

The {{purpose of}} {{resource}} sensitivity is to integrate {{understanding about the}} stresses on river basin systems into the comprehensive planning and management process. Understanding how fluctuating natural conditions affect water resources {{and the ability of}} users to manage them in an economically and ecologically feasible fashion is useful to charting the future course for planning and ultimately managing the whole river basin system. This brief paper outlines the sensitivity affecting <b>navigation</b> <b>windows</b> and the Eufaula wildlife refuge to illustrate the need to consider how key sectors adjust to climate changes in the ACF river basin. The two sectors are further illustrative of how operations to facilitate <b>navigation</b> <b>windows</b> can increase the risks from natural hazards to other sectors like wildlife habitats.

25|$|The first {{versions}} of Windows (1.0 through to 3.11) were actually just programs run from MS-DOS which then {{took over the}} screen and launched an application called Program Manager; later on, Windows 95, though still being based on MS-DOS, was its own operating system, using a 16-bit DOS-based kernel and a 32-bit user space. Windows 95 introduced many staple features that remain in current {{versions of}} Windows today, including the Start menu, the taskbar, and Windows Explorer (renamed File Explorer in Windows 8). In 1997, Microsoft released Internet Explorer 4 which included the (at the time) controversial Windows Desktop Update, which aimed to integrate Internet Explorer and the web into the user interface and also brought many new features into Windows, {{such as the ability}} to display JPEG images as the desktop wallpaper and single <b>window</b> <b>navigation</b> in <b>Windows</b> Explorer, all of which still exist in Windows today. In 1998, Microsoft released Windows 98, which also included the Windows Desktop Update and Internet Explorer 4 by default. The inclusion of Internet Explorer 4 and the Desktop Update led to an infamous anti-trust case. Windows 98 also included plug and play, which allowed devices to simply work when plugged in instead of requiring a system reboot, and USB support out of the box, which was previously only available in specially updated versions of Windows 95 which were only shipped to OEMs and not available to the general public. Windows ME, the last DOS-based version of Windows, was aimed at consumers and released in 2000. It introduced the Help and Support Center, System Restore, and updated user-friendly versions of the Disk Defragmenter and other system tools.|$|R

The Start charm invokes or dismisses the Start screen. Other charms invoke context-sensitive sidebars that can be used to access app and system functionality. Because of the aforementioned changes involving the use of hot corners, user interface <b>navigation</b> in <b>Windows</b> 8 is fundamentally different when compared with previous versions of Windows. To assist new users of the operating system, Microsoft incorporated a tutorial that appears during the installation of Windows 8, and also during the first sign-in of a new user account, which visually instructs users to move their mouse cursor into any corner of the screen (or swipe the corners on devices with touchscreens) to interact with the operating system.

40|$|Abstract. In this work, {{we present}} a Flow Stealing attack, where a victim’s browser is {{redirected}} during a legitimate flow. One scenario is redirecting the victim’s browser as it moves from a store to a payment provider. We discuss two attack vectors. Firstly, browsers have long admitted an attack allowing a malicious web page to detect whether the browser has visited a target web site by using CSS to style visited links and read out the style applied to a link. For a long time, this CSS history detection attack was perceived as having small impact. Lately, highly efficient implementations of the attack have enabled malicious web sites to extract large amounts of information. Following this, browser developers have deployed measures {{to protect against the}} attack. Flow stealing demonstrates that the impact of history detection is greater than previously known. Secondly, an attacker who can mount a man-in-the-middle attack against the victim’s network traffic can also perform a flow stealing attack. Noting that different browsers place different restrictions on cross-frame <b>navigation</b> through JavaScript <b>window</b> handles, we suggest a stricter policy based on pop-up blockers to prevent Flow Stealing attacks...|$|R
40|$|Background Interpretation {{of large}} volumes of data that has {{information}} about genes, regulons, gene ontology and probes are important for {{the identification of the}} functionality of individual genes and their role with respect to the organism. Many software tools are available today, but they become difficult to interpret when visualizing {{large volumes of}} data and representing relationships between them. Results MetViz is an interactive web-based tool that uses novel visualization techniques to represent regulons, genes and the gene ontology hierarchy. The tool provides easier accessibility by making it available as a website requiring no download. Instead of displaying all data and the relationship with each other at once, {{as is the case with}} many software tools like Cytoscape, MetViz incrementally displays and associates them based on the user?s interaction with the tool. One can radially visualize and organize data based on different quantitative properties such as Intra regulon density, gene count in a regulon and degree of regulons. It minimizes <b>navigation</b> between different <b>windows</b> and pages by maximizing screen utilization. It is also aimed at reducing the number of clicks performed to view and obtain information by providing easily accessible buttons to different functionalities, multiple ways to interact with data and perform the same function, and also making use of unique techniques such as a modified version of the icicle graph to display gene ontology information. Conclusions MetViz allows users to search for Gene Ontology terms, Regulons or Genes of interest and obtain information regarding them. It helps in understanding the relationship between Gene Ontology Terms and Regulons, Genes and Regulons 2 ̆ 6 Gene Ontology terms and Genes. It provides vital statistics like the genes present in a particular regulon, their count, evidence data, the pearson correlation matrix between the probes associated with genes, shortest path between regulons to show how closely they are related etcetera.

The software was compatible with many types of devices, including PDAs and Pocket PCs. The software could also be installed on PCs running Windows 95/NT.In 1999 a software product addressed to airplane pilots was launched that added specific functionalities such as runway details and radio frequencies.In the late 1990' and early 2000 the company partnered with Geographic Data Technologies (GDT) which was later acquired by TeleAtlas, one of the market leaders for digitized maps, an agreement which made street level maps of U.S., Canada and 14 European countries available to TeletType Co. The company implemented these maps in its navigation solutions for the Apple Newton and Windows and Windows CE based systems. Currently the company parters with Navteq for U.S., Canada, and Mexico mapping. TeleType continued its development efforts offering the first solution to combine land, air, and water navigation in one integrated program. The company expanded to create a vehicle tracking solution called PocketTracker, combining GPS tracking and <b>navigation</b> in a <b>Windows</b> CE based PDA. The solution was launched in 2001. The software {{took advantage of the}} CDPD technology, one of the first wireless data technologies, allowing users to track in real time the positions of devices running TeleType's software and hardware. From 2000 to 2007 the company introduced a series of portable navigation devices for street navigation. In 2008, TeleType launches one of the first GPS solutions aimed specifically at commercial drivers.
