5000|$|In its ruling, the SEC {{countered that}} NASD {{had created a}} new {{interpretation}} of Rule 3040 without providing prior <b>notice</b> <b>to</b> the <b>applicants.</b> “This lack of notice alone raises sufficient concerns to warrant dismissal of the charges,” said the commission, adding that the SRO also failed to establish {{a connection between the}} reps’ referrals and the e2 stock transactions. “There was no proof that they were making introductions for investment purposes. Plus there was a significant time period between the introductions and the purchases,” said Brian Rubin, a Washington D.C.-based partner in law firm Sutherland Asbill & Brennan (now renamed [...] "Sutherland") who represented Browne in the appeal. Rubin added that he has been unable to find another instance of the SEC reversing an NASD ruling for at least a decade.|$|R

We evaluate what is known regarding the receptive and expressive communicative capacities of these individuals. We attempt to evaluate what is known about the communicative strategies to determine how the literature may inform a set of evidence-based best practices regarding for effective and efficient communication with individuals with ID and PD...|$|R
