2500|$|Ceramics: Glazed ceramics, such as porcelain, {{provide a}} <b>nonstick</b> <b>cooking</b> surface. [...] Historically some glazes used on ceramic {{articles}} contained levels of lead, which can possess health risks; {{although this is}} not a concern with the vast majority of modern ware. Some pottery can be placed on fire directly.|$|E
50|$|Lecithin {{can easily}} be {{extracted}} chemically using solvents such as hexane, ethanol, acetone, petroleum ether, benzene, etc., or extraction can be done mechanically. It is usually available from sources such as soybeans, eggs, milk, marine sources, rapeseed, cottonseed, and sunflower. It has low solubility in water, but is an excellent emulsifier. In aqueous solution, its phospholipids can form either liposomes, bilayer sheets, micelles, or lamellar structures, depending on hydration and temperature. This results in a type of surfactant that usually is classified as amphipathic. Lecithin is sold as a food additive and dietary supplement. In cooking, it is sometimes used as an emulsifier and to prevent sticking, for example in <b>nonstick</b> <b>cooking</b> spray.|$|E
30|$|Begley et al. [35] {{showed that}} <b>nonstick</b> <b>cooking</b> {{utensils}} contribute less to PFC exposure to food than coated papers or cardboard boxes. Residual amounts of PFOA {{in the range}} of a few micrograms per kilogram or nanograms per gram were all that could be detected in PTFE cooking utensils. Of the total amount of PFOA in a PTFE strip, 17 % (30 ng/dm 2) migrated into the food simulant heated to 175 °C for 2 h. In contrast, some paper and cardboard surface coatings contained large amounts of PFCs. For example, microwave popcorn bags were found to contain 3 to 4 mg/kg (11 μg/dm 2).|$|E

30|$|Sinclair et al. [36] {{examined}} the emission of residual PFOA and FTOH from <b>nonstick</b> <b>cooking</b> utensils and microwave popcorn bags upon heating to normal cooking temperatures (179 °C to 233 °C surface temperature). Heating nonstick frying pans released 7 ng to 337 ng (0.11 to 5.03 ng/dm 2) PFOA {{in the gas}} phase. Furthermore, concentrations of 6 : 2 FTOH and 8 : 2 FTOH of < 0.15 to 2.04 ng/dm 2 and 0.42 to 6.25 ng/dm 2 were detected. Repeated use of some frying pans was observed {{to result in a}} reduction in PFOA concentrations emitted in the gas phase. However, {{this was not the case}} for all frying pans from all of the manufacturers tested. In addition, 5 to 34 ng PFOA and 223 ± 37 ng (6 : 2 FTOH) as well as 258 ± 36 ng (8 : 2 FTOH) per bag were detected in the emitted vapor from microwave popcorn bags [36].|$|E
40|$|What are inhalants? Inhalants are {{breathable}} chemical vapors or gases {{that produce}} psychoactive (mind-altering) effects when abused or misused. These include volatile organic solvents, fuel gases, nitrites, and anesthetic gases. They {{do not include}} inhaled medicinal drugs that are taken as prescribed. Once {{commonly referred to as}} “glue sniffing, ” inhalant abuse now includes a broad range of volatile solvents and gas products (e. g., model airplane glue, paint thinner, gasoline, and nail polish remover), aerosols (e. g., <b>nonstick</b> <b>cooking</b> spray and hair spray), anesthetics (e. g., nitrous oxide or “laughing gas ” and ether), and nitrites (e. g., amyl, butyl, and isobutyl nitrites, often marketed as “poppers ” or room odorizers). (Other powdered drugs, such as heroin, cocaine, and methamphetamine, can be inhaled but are not considered inhalants.) Although the chemicals involved and their effects vary, the route of administration is the common factor. What are the most common modes of administration? Inhalants are abused either by “sniffing ” through the nose or inhaling fumes through the open mouth (“huffing”) much like a smoker inhales cigarette smoke. Usually the open tube of glue, nail polish, or marker is placed close to the nose and the fumes are inhaled. People who abuse inhalants may also spray the substance into a plastic or paper bag and huff that way (“bagging”) or even place the bag over the entire head. Often a product will be poured or sprayed on a piece of cloth, a rag, a towel, or a shirt sleeve or into a soda can and inhaled in that manner. Another method is to paint the fingernails with a product such as correction fluid and inhale the substance from the nails. Sometimes an aerosol substance is sprayed directly into the mouth. Substances also can be placed into alternative containers (e. g., balloon filled with nitrous oxide) or heated and then inhaled (Synergies 2002). Who is likely to abuse inhalants? Contrary to popular perception, people who abuse inhalants are found throughout the population and no one group can be categorized as “inhalant abusers. ” In 2001, more than 18. 2 million Americans reported ever having used an inhalant, and 141, 000 were estimated to need treatment because they were dependent on or abused inhalants. According to the 2001 Nationa...|$|E
