50|$|The {{traditional}} town of Uchiko {{is surrounded}} by much natural beauty and is located about 42 kilometers southwest of Matsuyama in the Ehime prefecture. Three streams run through the area: the Oda, the Nakayama and the Fumoto. Uchiko has few flat areas and about 70% {{of the land is}} forest. The soil is fertile and the main industry is agriculture, particularly leaf tobacco, shiitake mushrooms, and fruits such as persimmons, grapes and <b>nashi</b> <b>pears.</b> The riversides are used mainly by farms and farmland can extend to the hills and the steep mountainsides. As of April 2005, the population in Uchiko was approximately 20,650.All year round, the stunning views and the very green, fertile mountains and valleys give the people of Uchiko both the feeling of restfulness and economic sustenance.|$|R

40|$|A técnica de ensacamento da pêra japonesa, além de evitar a poluição {{ambiental}} causada por defensivos agrícolas, ainda proporciona melhoria na qualidade organoléptica dos frutos, reduzindo os danos provocados por mosca-das-frutas e grafolita. No presente trabalho, utilizaram-se as cultivares Hosui e Nijisseiki, cujos frutos foram ensacados logo após o raleio para evitar-se o desenvolvimento do "russeting" e o contato com insetos. Para a 'Housui', foi necessário um só ensacamento, ao custo de R$ 4. 075, 00 /ha, considerando 110. 000 frutos/ha. Já para a 'Nijisseiki', são necessários dois ensacamentos, resultando um custo de R$ 4. 118, 00 /ha, considerando-se 73. 370 frutos/ha. O custo aproximado do ensacamento em 'Housui' foi de R$ 0, 04 /fruto e em 'Nijisseiki', R$ 0, 06 /fruto. Mesmo sendo maior o custo do ensacamento para a 'Nijisseiki', esta cultivar obteve preços comerciais inferiores ao da 'Housui' no mercado brasileiro. O aumento do custo de produção devido ao ensacamento é passível de ser assimilado pelo produtor, desde que obtenha frutos de maior qualidade para, assim, vender os frutos ensacados com preços superiores. The bagging {{technique of}} <b>Nashi</b> <b>pears</b> not only insures good environmental effects by avoiding inseticide use, but also improves {{the flavor of}} fruits by decreasing the damages caused by fruit-fly and oriental fruit moth. This study was carried out with the cultivars Housui and Nijisseiki. The fruits were bagged just after thinning {{in order to avoid}} the development of russeting and to protect them against insects attack. For cv. Housui a single bag was enough. The total cost of bagging was R$ 4, 075. 00 /ha, considering 110. 000 fruits/ha. For cv. Nijisseiki it was necessary to use a double bagging, with a total cost of R$ 4, 188. 00 /ha to protect 73. 370 fruits/ha. The estimated bagging cost per fruit was R$ 0. 04 for cv. Housui and R$ 0. 06 for cv. Nijisseiki. Not only the bagging cost of 'Nijisseiki' fruits was higher compared to 'Housui' fruits, but also the price of 'Nijisseiki' is being lower at the Brazilian market as compared to 'Housui' price. The higher production cost by using fruit bagging should be assimilated by fruit growers considering it improves fruit quality that insures better price at market place...|$|R

40|$|Irregular pagination: missing pp. 206, 221 The {{effects of}} mild water stress and {{physical}} root restriction on leaf parameters and assimilate partitioning {{have been studied}} {{in order to understand}} and refine orchard management techniques which utilise both of the above stress elements (e. g. regulated deficit irrigation (RDI)). Initially, a system for applying a controlled level of water stress was developed and plant responses within this system defined. The system involved using aeroponic tanks with water stress generated by cycling the misting pumps on and off (intermittent misting). Similar systems have been used by other workers to stimulate hormonal changes but no work has been reported detailing vegetative growth responses. The intermittent misting technique was compared to polyethylene glycol (PEG) generated water stress, using tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill. cv. Virosa Fl) as a model plant. Water stress studies were then carried out on Pyrus betulaefolia (an important root-stock for the asian <b>pear</b> (<b>nashi)</b> fruit crop (Pyrus serotina)) using intermittent misting. These results were compared to those from a root restriction trial involving P. betulaefolia in a circulating hydroponic system. The performance of polyethylene glycol in the aeroponic system appeared to be better than in the various hydroponic systems which have been reported. Polyethylene glycol 4000 gave the best results (from PEG 1000, 4000 and 6000), in terms of in minimum level of phytotoxicity, up to a total nutrient solution water potential ('Pw) of around - 6 bar. Under an intermittent misting regime, tomato plants were subjected to a range of misting pump off-times up to 1. 55 hours, with a constant on-time of 1 minute (to saturate the root system). It was found that important plant parameters could be related in a negative logarithmic fashion to misting pump off-time (e. g. leaf Ww, p lant part dry weights, allometric k value, net photosynthetic · rate and stomatal conductance). For P. betulaefolia trees, exposed to misting pump off-times of up to two hours, plant parameters were also related to the negative logarithm of the misting pump off-time. This was {{despite the fact that the}} tomato seedlings grew approximately exponentially while P. betulaefolia plants grew in a more linear fashion. Hence it was concluded that intermittent misting was an ideal method for generating a controlled water stress (under which plant responses could be predicted) in both pure and applied experimental work. Under physical root restriction (with water stress minimized), no significant differences were found in several important parameters, including net photosynthetic rate. Also, in contrast to the water stress response, assimilate partitioning to the shoot system increased (increase in the allometric k value). The relative increase in partitioning was greatest in the stem component, this being the plant part most severely affected by water stress. - Under both water stress and physical root restriction the allometric k value appeared to change rapidly, following application of the treatment, and then remain constant. This constancy was tested by using a previously unutilized plot involving the shoot/root ratio versus time linearized plant dry weight. The results of pl ant responses to both water stress and physical root restriction are discussed in relation to vegetative growth control measures in frui t crops such as RDI. Consideration is also given to the overall mechanisms behind observed growth responses under the two stress regimes...|$|R
50|$|Three species {{account for}} the vast {{majority}} of edible fruit production, the European pear Pyrus communis subsp. communis cultivated mainly in Europe and North America, the Chinese white pear (bai li) Pyrus ×bretschneideri, and the <b>Nashi</b> <b>pear</b> Pyrus pyrifolia (also known as Asian pear or apple pear), both grown mainly in eastern Asia. There are thousands of cultivars of these three species.

40|$|Abstract Background Erwinia pyrifoliae is a newly {{described}} necrotrophic pathogen, {{which causes}} fire blight on Asian (<b>Nashi)</b> <b>pear</b> and is geographically restricted to Eastern Asia. Relatively {{little is known}} about its genetics compared to the closely related main fire blight pathogen E. amylovora. Results The genome of the type strain of E. pyrifoliae strain DSM 12163 T, was sequenced using both 454 and Solexa pyrosequencing and annotated. The genome contains a circular chromosome of 4. 026 Mb and four small plasmids. Based on their respective role in virulence in E. amylovora or related organisms, we identified several putative virulence factors, including type III and type VI secretion systems and their effectors, flagellar genes, sorbitol metabolism, iron uptake determinants, and quorum-sensing components. A deletion in the rpoS gene covering the most conserved region of the protein was identified which may contribute to the difference in virulence/host-range compared to E. amylovora. Comparative genomics with the pome fruit epiphyte Erwinia tasmaniensis Et 1 / 99 showed that both species are overall highly similar, although specific differences were identified, for example the presence of some phage gene-containing regions and a high number of putative genomic islands containing transposases in the E. pyrifoliae DSM 12163 T genome. Conclusions The E. pyrifoliae genome is an important addition to the published genome of E. tasmaniensis and the unfinished genome of E. amylovora providing a foundation for re-sequencing additional strains that may shed light on the evolution of the host-range and virulence/pathogenicity of this important group of plant-associated bacteria. </p...|$|E
