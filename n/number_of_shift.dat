40|$|This paper {{presents}} a technology-independent design and simulation of a modified {{architecture of the}} Carry-Save Adder. This architecture is shown to produce {{the result of the}} addition fast and by requiring a minimum number of logic gates. Binary addition is carried out by a series of XOR, AND and Shift-left operations. These operations are terminated with a completion signal indicating that the result of the addition is obtained. Because the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>shift</b> operations carried out varies from 0 to n for n-bit addends, a behavioral model was developed in which all the possible addends having 2 - to 15 -bits were applied. A mathematical model was deducted from the data and used to predict the average <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>shift</b> required for standard binary numbers such as 32, 64 or 128 -bits. 4 -bit prototypes of this adder were designed and simulated in both synchronous and asynchronous modes of operation...|$|E

By noting some simple properties of number theory and the DFT, the total number of real multiplications for a length-P DFT is reduced to (P — 1).

For a proper choice of transform length and NTT, the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>shift</b> adds per point is approximately the same as the number of additions required for FFT algorithms. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract:- Multiple {{constant}} multiplication (MCM) is {{an efficient}} way of implementing several constant multiplications {{with the same}} input data. The coefficients are expressed using shifts, adders, and subtracters. By utilizing redundancy between the coefficients the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> adders and subtracters is reduced resulting in a low complexity implementation. However, for digit-serial arithmetic a shift requires a flip-flop, and, hence, the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>shifts</b> {{should be taken into}} consideration as well. In this work we investigate the area, speed, power trade-offs for implementation of FIR filters using MCM and digit-serial arithmetic.

A traditional PRBS generator uses a linear feedback shift register (LFSR) which generates a single {{maximum length sequence}} pattern having a fixed period. In this paper, three shift registers with feedback connections are employed in which the preset inputs of the shift registers are changed only on completion of their length sequences. These preset inputs are changed by employing a counter, the time period of the clock of which equals {{the time of the}} length sequence. Thus, by employing a limited <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>shift</b> registers, a considerable increase in the length sequence is possible.
