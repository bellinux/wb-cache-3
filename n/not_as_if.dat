25|$|Notably, it was <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> Italians {{had never}} {{migrated}} before, internal migration between North and Southern Italy before unification was common. Northern Italy {{caught on to}} the global industrialization sooner than Southern Italy, therefore it was considered more modern technologically, and tended to be inhabited by the bourgeoisie. Alternatively, rural and agro-intensive Southern Italy was seen as economically backward and was mainly populated by lower class peasantry. Given these disparities, prior to unification (and arguably after) the two sections of Italy, North and South were essentially seen by Italians and other nations as separate countries. So, migrating {{from one part of}} Italy to next could be seen as though they were indeed migrating to another country or even continent.|$|E

Not a pleasant sound but it's the noise we had. We pressed it up and stuck it out. A celebration of sorts." [...] Jimmy Cauty defended sampling as an artistic practice: [...] "It's <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> we're taking anything away, just borrowing and making things bigger. If you're creative you aren't going to stop working just because there is a law against what you are doing." ...|$|E

They try to extend their views of the world, how the world should work and how democracy works in another country." [...] They also felt that China should be given due credit for undisputed improvements in {{human rights and the}} economy over the last 10 years. Novoselov questioned: [...] "What is a dictatorship? It is <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> people are being constantly killed there," [...] The pair were rebutted by 2010 Nobel literature laureate Mario Vargas Llosa, who said it was a timely reminder that China was still a dictatorship and quite monolithic regarding politics, and that the award was [...] "a tribute to all Chinese dissidents and all Chinese who want not just economic but also political growth and progress in China." ...|$|E

Collins {{retired from the}} music industry as an active musician that year in favour of family commitments and has stated {{he can no longer}} play the drums due to medical issues. Hackett has said [...] "I would say it's possible, but highly improbable. I've always been open to it. I'm not the guy who says no." [...] Gabriel addressed the possibility of a reunion: [...] "I never say never. It really didn't happen last time. I think there's a small chance, but I don't think it's very high." [...] In 2014, Collins reiterated, [...] "Have people thought it through? It’s <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> you’re going to get Peter as the singer, me as the drummer. I can’t play any more, so it’s never going to happen," [...] adding it would not be likely for Gabriel to perform songs Collins originally sang lead on.|$|E

I believe in equal rights for women. Things should be decided by ability, not sex". [...] At odds with Nagle's view, in her court case Lord Justice Salmon commented that [...] "No doubt there are occupations, such as boxing, which may be reasonably regarded inherently unsuitable for women", and Lord Denning had gone on to say that [...] "It is <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> the training of horses could be regarded as an unsuitable occupation for a woman, like that of a jockey or speedway-rider"; it was another eight years before Jockey Club rules permitted women jockeys in 1972. When asked by a journalist in the late 1970s if she thought women could ever match men on the racecourse, Nagle replied: [...] "My dear man, it used to be said women couldn't stand up to three-day-eventing. Now they're beating the men regularly– and the same will happen in racing. Give them time." [...] Her endeavours led to her being described as [...] "the Mrs Pankhurst of British horse racing" [...] in Stud & Stable Magazine and [...] "Racing's Emily Pankhurst".|$|E

2500|$|In 2005, Tim Stier, priest at the Corpus Christi Catholic Church in Fremont, California, {{stepped down}} from his 25-year service with the Oakland diocese in protest at its failure to address {{sexuality}} problems in priests.

He said, [...] "It's <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> I'm a perfect person and I don't have weaknesses and sin.

2500|$|Local radio stations' initial {{reception}} of Pupil's music, though, was relatively limited (with {{the exception of}} NU 107) due to the band's genre and musical style. While the band's carrier single, [...] "Nasaan Ka?" [...] was played often and achieved quite a popularity among listeners, other singles released from their album encountered more hurdles. The song [...] "Nasaan Ka?" [...] was used as main theme and [...] "story" [...] (based on lyrics) for the first episode of the second season of Your Song. Frontman Ely Buendia says, [...] "Some pop radio stations are still making up their minds on 'Dianetic' which I personally don’t understand since it’s really {{just one of those}} straightforward love songs medyo on the noisy side nga lang (just {{a little bit on the}} noisy side)." [...] "Then again, minsan talaga hindi mo maintindihan ang ibang radio stations (sometimes you cannot understand some radio stations). It’s <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> they don’t play songs by foreign artists like Nirvana with music heavier on distorted electric guitar than ours. Pero okay lang (But that's okay), that’s the reality of things." [...] He speculates that xenocentrism has something to do about the double standard these radio stations go by. Consequently, they were forced to release an acoustic version of their second single, [...] "Dianetic". The acoustic version of [...] "Nasaan Ka?" [...] was then used as a Bonus Track for Sony BMG's CD Sampler 2006 Volume 3.|$|E

2500|$|Black's oral {{arguments}} were heard June 5, 2008, by {{a three-judge panel}} of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. Andrew Frey argued that Black and his co-defendants did not steal from Hollinger when they authorized individual non-competition payments. Frey asserted that the monies were [...] "management fees" [...] and that Hollinger International shareholders were not hurt by the payments. Appeals judge Richard Posner said, [...] "The bulk of the evidence [...] {{has to do with}} pretty naked fraud." [...] Posner was skeptical about defense arguments that Black did not obstruct justice by removing boxes from his Toronto office, commenting, [...] "The timing was bizarre, the removal of the documents {{in the middle of an}} investigation." [...] Three weeks later, on June 25, 2008, the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the convictions. and rejected all of the arguments raised by the defense. The circuit court found that [...] "the evidence established a conventional fraud, that is, a theft of money or other property from Hollinger by misrepresentations and misleading omissions..." [...] The panel affirmed the jury's findings stating that, [...] "It is <b>not</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> Black had merely been using his power as controlling shareholder to elect a rubber-stamp board of directors or to approve a merger favorable to him at the expense of the minority shareholders ... He was acting in his capacity as the CEO of Hollinger when he ordered (Mark) Kipnis to draft the covenants not to compete and when he duped the audit committee and submitted a false 10-K." [...] Black, for his part, maintained the form in question was simply improperly, and not falsely, submitted.|$|E
