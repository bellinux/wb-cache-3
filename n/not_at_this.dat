5|$|At 06:30 the No. 5 Wing {{attacked}} the Ottoman defences, drawing some fire which revealed {{the locations of}} machine guns, trenches and five redoubts. The redoubts were arranged around the village, which protected the only available water supply in the area. During the day, pilots and their observers provided frequent reports; fourteen were received between 07:50 and 15:15, giving estimated positions, strength, and movements of the Ottoman garrison. These were most often given verbally by the observer, after the pilot landed near Chauvel's headquarters, as the aircraft did <b>not</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> time have wireless communication.|$|E
5|$|It {{was very}} soon after their arrival that they {{learned of the}} death of Paul I. Louis hoped that Paul's successor, Alexander I, would {{repudiate}} his father's banishment of the Bourbons (which he later did). Louis XVIII then intended to set off to the Kingdom of Naples. The Count of Artois asked Louis to send his son, Louis Antoine, and daughter-in-law, Marie-Thérèse, to him in Edinburgh, but they did <b>not</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> time. Artois had an allowance from King George III of Great Britain and sent some money to Louis. Louis XVIII's court in exile was being spied on by French police. The court-in-exile was being financed mainly by interest owed from Francis II on valuables his aunt, Marie Antoinette, had removed from France and had to cut its expenses significantly.|$|E
5|$|There was a {{long history}} of {{painting}} candlelit scenes in Western art, although as Wright had <b>not</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> date travelled abroad, there remains uncertainty as to what paintings he might have seen in the original, as opposed to prints. Nicolson, who made studies of both Wright and other candlelight painters such as the 17th-century Utrecht Caravaggisti, thought their paintings, among the largest in the style, those most likely to have influenced Wright. However Judy Egerton wonders if he could have seen any, preferring as influences the far smaller works of the Leiden fijnschilder Godfried Schalcken (1643–1706), whose reputation was much greater in the early 18th century than subsequently. He had worked in England from 1692 to 1697, and several of his paintings can be placed in English collections in Wright's day.|$|E

25|$|Pliny's {{letter is}} the {{earliest}} pagan account {{to refer to}} early Christians and provides a key description of Roman administrative process and problems.

Although Emperor Trajan gave Pliny specific advice about disregarding anonymous accusations, for example, he was deliberate in not establishing any new rules {{in regards to the}} Christians.

25|$|In 1928 Pears went to Keble College, Oxford, {{to study}} music. He was <b>not</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> stage sure whether his musical future {{was as a}} singer or as player; during his brief time at the {{university}} he was appointed temporary assistant organist at Hertford College, which was useful practical experience. Headington comments that a musical conservatoire such as the Royal College of Music would have suited Pears better than the Oxford course, {{but at the time}} it was seen as a natural progression for an English public school boy to continue his education at Oxford or Cambridge. In the event Pears did not take to Oxford's academic regime, which required him to study a range of subjects before specialising in music. He failed the first-year examinations (Moderations) and though he was entitled to resit them he decided against doing so, and went down from Oxford.|$|E

25|$|In 1798 Murdoch {{returned}} to Birmingham {{to work in}} the Soho foundry and continued his experiments with gas, as part of which he lit the interior of the Soho main building, although it is likely that it was lit only in part and <b>not</b> (<b>at</b> <b>this</b> time) permanently. In 1802 as part of the public celebrations of the Peace of Amiens he made a public exhibition of his lighting by illuminating the exterior of the Soho Foundry. The first industrial factory to be illuminated by gas was the Philips and Lee cotton mill in Manchester which was fully lit by Murdoch in 1805, four years after the idea was first broached. Initially this mill contained 50 gas lights, although this soon grew to 904. The length of time taken to complete this project was partly due to experimentations and improvements in the process developed by Murdoch to make the lighting of a large factory by gas practicable and cost effective – such as purifying the gas with lime to remove the smell and determining the best temperature to heat coal to obtain the maximum quantity of gas – although Murdoch continued to be involved in other engine work for Boulton and Watt, which took up much of his time.|$|E

After ten days of inactivity the ship’s fires were banked, to save fuel. Strenuous efforts were made to release her; on 14 February Shackleton ordered men onto the ice with ice-chisels, prickers, saws and picks, to try and force a passage, but the labour proved futile. Shackleton did <b>not</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> stage abandon all hope of breaking free, but was now contemplating the [...] "possibility of having to spend a winter in the inhospitable arms of the pack".|$|E
500|$|General Archibald Wavell, the {{commander}} of British Army forces in the Middle East, when in Greece from 11–13 April had warned Wilson that he must expect no reinforcements and had authorised Major General Freddie de Guingand to discuss evacuation plans with certain responsible officers. Nevertheless, the British could <b>not</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> stage adopt or even mention this course of action; the suggestion had {{to come from the}} Greek Government. The following day, Papagos made the first move when he suggested to Wilson that W Force be withdrawn. [...] Wilson informed Middle East Headquarters and on 17 April, Rear admiral H. T. Baillie-Grohman was sent to Greece to prepare for the evacuation. [...] That day Wilson hastened to Athens where he attended a conference with the King, Papagos, d'Albiac and Rear admiral Turle. In the evening, after telling the King that he felt he had failed him in the task entrusted to him, Prime Minister Koryzis committed suicide. [...] On 21 April, the final decision to evacuate Empire forces to Crete and Egypt was taken and Wavell—in confirmation of verbal instructions—sent his written orders to Wilson.|$|E
500|$|The {{couple had}} ten illegitimate children—five sons and five daughters—nine {{of whom were}} named after William's siblings; each was given the surname [...] "FitzClarence". Their affair lasted for twenty years before ending in 1811. Mrs. Jordan had no doubt as to {{the reason for the}} break-up: [...] "Money, money, my good friend, has, I am {{convinced}} made HIM at this moment the most wretched of men," [...] adding, [...] "With all his excellent qualities, his domestic virtues, his love for his lovely children, what must he <b>not</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> moment suffer?" [...] She was given a financial settlement of £4,400 (equivalent to £ today) per year and custody of her daughters on condition that she did not resume the stage. When she resumed acting in an effort to repay debts incurred by the husband of one of her daughters from a previous relationship, William took custody of the daughters and stopped paying the £1,500 (equivalent to £ today) designated for their maintenance. After Mrs. Jordan's acting career began to fail, she fled to France to escape her creditors, and died, impoverished, near Paris in 1816.|$|E
