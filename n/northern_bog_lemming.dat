40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{distribution}} and ecology of 26 mammals, 6 birds, and 1 amphib-ian are described. Northern range extensions are recorded for the pygmy shrew, arctic shrew, muskrat, heather vole, <b>northern</b> <b>bog</b> <b>lemming</b> and wood frog. A southern range {{extension of the}} arctic ground squirrel is noted following its being observed {{for the first time}} in Manitoba. Observation of a great blue heron at Churchill, far from its usual range in southern Manitoba, is also recorded. The number of species of small mammals on two-hectare quadrats in marsh, prairie, shrub, and savanna along the grassland-coniferous forest transition in southern Mani-toba was 1. 8 to 3. 0 times greater than in beach-meadow, tundra, shrub, and open-forest quadrats along the coniferous forest-tundra transition of northern Manitoba, while the total population was 1. 8 to 3. 4 times greater.

It also inhibits wetter and drier sites when meadow voles are scarce or absent. The southern bog lemmings create a maze of interconnecting tunnels and runways and build nests from plant fibers.

50|$|Lycopodiella inundata is {{a species}} of club moss known by the common names {{inundated}} club moss, marsh clubmoss and <b>northern</b> <b>bog</b> club moss. It has a circumpolar and circumboreal distribution, occurring throughout the northern Northern Hemisphere from the Arctic to montane temperate regions in Eurasia and North America. It grows in wet habitat, such as bogs, ponds, moist spots on the tundra, and longstanding borrow pits. It is a small plant forming patches on the ground, its leafy sterile stems branching and lying horizontal along the ground and fertile conebearing stems erect a few centimeters high. The leaves are curving, green, narrow, and sharply pointed, measuring a few millimeters long.|$|R
50|$|These {{animals are}} found in wet <b>{{northern}}</b> forests, <b>bogs,</b> tundra, and meadows in Canada, Alaska, northern Washington, and New England.

40|$|Part of {{the missing}} sink in the global CO 2 budget has been {{attributed}} to the positive effects of CO 2 fertilization and N deposition on carbon sequestration in Northern Hemisphere terrestrial ecosystems. The genus Sphagnum {{is one of the most}} important groups of plant species sequestrating carbon in temperate and <b>northern</b> <b>bog</b> ecosystems, because of the low decomposability of the dead material it produces. The effects of raised CO 2 and increased atmospheric N deposition on growth of Sphagnum and other plants were studied in bogs at four sites across Western Europe. Contrary to expectations, elevated CO 2 did not significantly affect Sphagnum biomass growth. Increased N deposition reduced Sphagnum mass growth, because it increased the cover of vascular plants and the tall moss Polytrichum strictum. Such changes in plant species composition may decrease carbon sequestration in Sphagnum -dominated bog ecosystems...|$|R
