His consequent violent and estranged relationship with his father and increasing internal conflict making him shift alliances between protagonists and antagonists forms the storyline for his character. Towards the end of season four, events take their toll on Connor's sanity, and his memories are rewritten to give him a <b>normal</b> <b>life.</b> The next time he appears in season five, Connor is a well-adjusted person. At the return of his memories, Connor finally reconciles with Angel in the series finale.

60|$|In {{order to}} do so it has been {{convenient}} to coin two expressions, and to employ them with a certain defined intention. They are firstly: The <b>Normal</b> Social <b>Life,</b> and secondly: The Great State. Throughout this essay these expressions {{will be used in}} accordance with the definitions presently to be given, {{and the fact that they}} are so used will be emphasised by the employment of capitals. It will be possible for anyone to argue that what is here defined as the <b>Normal</b> Social <b>Life</b> is not the <b>normal</b> social <b>life,</b> and that the Great State is indeed no state at all. That will be an argument outside the range delimited by these definitions.|$|R
5|$|Schubert {{had been}} {{struggling}} with syphilis since 1822–23, and suffered from weakness, headaches and dizziness. However, {{he seems to have}} led a relatively <b>normal</b> <b>life</b> until September 1828, when new symptoms such as effusions of blood appeared. At this stage he moved from the Vienna home of his friend Franz von Schober to his brother Ferdinand's house in the suburbs, following the advice of his doctor; unfortunately, this may have actually worsened his condition. However, up until the last weeks of his life in November 1828, he continued to compose an extraordinary amount of music, including such masterpieces as the three last sonatas.|$|E
5|$|The {{menstrual cycle}} is the regular natural change {{that occurs in}} the female {{reproductive}} system (specifically the uterus and ovaries) that makes pregnancy possible. The cycle {{is required for the}} production of ovocytes, and for the preparation of the uterus for pregnancy. Up to 80% of women report having some symptoms during the one to two weeks prior to menstruation. Common symptoms include acne, tender breasts, bloating, feeling tired, irritability and mood changes. These symptoms interfere with <b>normal</b> <b>life</b> and therefore qualify as premenstrual syndrome in 20 to 30% of women. In 3 to 8%, they are severe.|$|E

Further tremors near dawn caused the population to abandon the village and caused disastrous wave action in the Bay of Naples.|$|E

60|$|All written {{history is}} the story of a {{minority}} and their peculiar and abnormal affairs. Save in so far as it notes great natural catastrophes and tells of the spreading or retrocession of human life through changes of climate and physical conditions it resolves itself into an account of a series of attacks and modifications and supplements made by excessive and superfluous forces engendered within the community upon the <b>Normal</b> Social <b>Life.</b> The very invention of writing is a part of those modifying developments. The <b>Normal</b> Social <b>Life</b> is essentially illiterate and traditional. The <b>Normal</b> Social <b>Life</b> is as mute as the standing crops; it is as seasonal and cyclic as nature herself, and reaches towards the future only an intimation of continual repetitions.|$|R

Clark's season-one problems include his inability to share his secret and his desire for a <b>normal</b> <b>life.</b> After months of scouting, Welling was cast as Clark. Although David Nutter had to convince his manager that the role would not hurt the actor's film career to persuade Welling to read the pilot script, after reading the script Welling agreed to audition.|$|E
5|$|Although he was {{of royal}} blood, his family was {{relatively}} obscure and lived a comparatively <b>normal</b> <b>life</b> by royal standards. In 1852, however, George's father was designated the heir presumptive to the childless King Frederick VII of Denmark, and the family became princes and princesses of Denmark. George's siblings were Frederick (who succeeded their father as King of Denmark), Alexandra (who became wife of King Edward VII of the United Kingdom {{and the mother of}} King George V), Dagmar (who, as Empress Maria Feodorovna, was consort of Emperor Alexander III of Russia and the mother of Emperor Nicholas II), Thyra (who married Prince Ernest Augustus, 3rd Duke of Cumberland and Teviotdale) and Valdemar.|$|E
5|$|Among the Romani people, mullo (literally {{one who is}} dead) are {{believed}} to return from the dead and cause malicious acts as well as drink human blood, most often that of a relative or {{the person who had}} caused their death. Other potential victims were those who did not properly observe the burial ceremonies or kept the deceased's possessions instead of properly destroying them. Female vampires could return, lead a <b>normal</b> <b>life</b> and even marry but would eventually exhaust the husband with their sexual appetite. Similar to other European beliefs, male vampires could father children, known as dhampirs, who could be hired to detect and get rid of vampires.|$|E
40|$|In the {{introduction}} to his Allgemeine Psychopathologie, published in 1913, Karl Jaspers stated that psychology has little value for the psychopathologist because it focuses {{on all kinds of}} interesting matters, but not on <b>normal</b> psychic <b>life.</b> In this article we argue that today, in the year 2013, little has changed in this respect. During the past century, <b>normal</b> psychic <b>life</b> (non-pathological psychic life) has rarely been a topic of research. Clinical psychology has focused primarily on studying three other topics: the mind-body problem (does the mind actually exist, or are we exclusively the result of brain function?), the methodological debate (should psychology use quantitative or qualitative research results as a basis for its expertise?) and the psychotherapy debate (Is psychotherapy effective? If so, which form is the most effective?). Due to this focus, our knowledge in the above-mentioned areas has increased significantly, but the issue raised by Karl Jaspers about <b>normal</b> psychic <b>life</b> has still not been addressed. In this article, we propose that <b>normal</b> psychic <b>life</b> should indeed become the new focus of clinical psychology. We illustrate the importance of this new focus with three examples from clinical psychology: the Global Assessment of Functioning scale, empathy and the emergence of positive psychology during the past decade. We then explore the efficacy of phenomenology for studying this <b>normal</b> psychic <b>life,</b> thereby discovering a useful epistemological basis in Husserl’s systematic phenomenology. Various phenomenological research methods are evaluated in the light of this systematic phenomenology...|$|R

50|$|The <b>Normal</b> Christian <b>Life</b> {{is one of}} Nee's most {{well known}} books. It is {{considered}} by many to be a spiritual classic of Christianity. It has been reprinted and reissued in many editions and in many languages. The book's enduring appeal is not only due to Nee's exposition of Romans but also to the many illustrations, personal accounts, and anecdotes that Nee used. The <b>Normal</b> Christian <b>Life</b> has impacted millions of Christians since Nee spoke it and is a major contributor to the house church movement today. Nee was recognized in the United States House of Representatives by Christopher H. Smith of New Jersey in 2009. He recognized Nee as having been one of the most influential Chinese Christians of his era. In the Congressional record, The <b>Normal</b> Christian <b>Life</b> is highlighted by Smith as being among his most popular and influential books.|$|R
