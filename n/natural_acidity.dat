25|$|The upper {{sandstone}} {{member is}} known as the Big Clifty Sandstone: thin, sparse layers of limestone interspersed within the sandstones give rise to an epikarstic zone, in which tiny conduits (cave passages too small to enter) are dissolved by the <b>natural</b> <b>acidity</b> of groundwater. The epikarstic zone concentrates local flows of runoff into high-elevation springs which emerge at the edges of ridges. The resurgent water from these springs typically flows briefly on the surface before sinking underground again at elevation of the contact between the sandstone caprock and the underlying massive limestones. It is in these underlying massive limestone layers that the human-explorable caves of the region have naturally developed.|$|E
25|$|The Barbera vine is very {{vigorous}} {{and capable of}} producing high yields if not kept in check by pruning and other methods. Excessive yields can diminish the fruit quality in the grape and accentuate Barbera's <b>natural</b> <b>acidity</b> and sharpness. In Piedmont, the vine was prized for its yields and ability to ripen two weeks earlier than Nebbiolo even on vineyard sites with less than ideal exposure. This allowed the Piedmontese winemakers in regions like Alba to give their best sites over to the more difficult to cultivate Nebbiolo and still produce quality wine with Barbera that could be consumed earlier while the Nebbiolo ages. Harvest for Barbera usually takes place in late September-early October, usually two weeks after Dolcetto has been picked. In recent times, winemakers have been experimenting with harvesting Barbera later at higher sugar levels to produce heavier, more fruit forward wines. In some vintages, these producers may even harvest their Barbera after Nebbiolo.|$|E

40|$|Spring flood is an {{occasion}} for transient hydrochemical changes that profoundly effect the biodiversity of the aquatic ecosystem. Spring flood is also very susceptible to anthropogenic acidification. Belief that acid deposition is primarily responsible for pH decline during spring flood {{has been an important}} factor in the decision to spend close to one billion Swedish crowns to lime surface waters in northern Sweden during the last decade. The objective of this work is to present an operational tool, the Boreal Dilution Model (BDM), for separating and quantifying the anthropogenic and natural contributions to episodic acidification during spring flood episodes in northern Sweden. The limited data requirements of 10 - 15 stream water samples before and during spring flood make the BDM suitable for widespread use in environmental monitoring programs. This creates a possibility for distinguishing trends and spatial patterns in the human impact as well as natural pH decline. The results from applying the BDM, and a one point "pBDM" version of the model, in northern Sweden demonstrate that the anthropogenic component associated with spring flood episodes is now generally limited. Instead it is the combination of <b>natural</b> organic <b>acidity</b> and dilution of the buffering capacity that is the major driving mechanism of episodic acidity during spring flood events in the region. While the anthropogenic component of episodic acidification generally contributes 0. 1 to 0. 3 pH units to the natural pH decline of up to 2. 5 pH units, the current regional extent of areas that are severely affected by anthropogenically driven episodes is approximately 6...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examined}} the <b>natural</b> organic <b>acidity</b> of throughfall in French forests {{in order to determine}} the natural and anthropogenic contributions to the total acidity. The first results presented here were achieved from 64 open field precipitation and throughfall samples, collected from June to December 1996 at 7 RENECOFOR stations (French permanent plot network for the monitoring of forest ecosystems). A titration method was developed to quantify the organic contribution to the acid neutralizing capacity (ANC), to the charge balance and to the weak <b>acidity.</b> The <b>natural</b> organic acids occurring in throughfall samples were characterized by a mean site density of either 7. 3 or 10. 2 μeq/mg of C, considering only titratable organic acidity or total organic acidity, respectively. The mean charge density was 5. 2 μeq/mg of C and, as a linear relationship exists between the charge density and pH, an estimate of the organic anion concentration can be obtained directly from dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and pH measurements. The organic contribution to the ANC, and thus to the buffering capacity, is of prime importance for those waters which have pH values between 3. 8 and 6. 6, and characterized by a low bicarbonate content and a high DOC concentration. The mean organic contribution to the titrated ANC was 2. 2 μeq/mg of C, which is less than half the charge density. These first results show that the acid-base properties of DOC are similar for all studied samples, despite different geographical situations, climates, and vegetation types. Furthermore, when comparing these results to literature data (obtained for stream, lake, and soil solution samples), it appears clearly that, unless a methodological artifact exists, the organic acids dissolved in throughfall are weaker...|$|R

The aim of this research for the fututure is to prepare the best characters catalyst for the conversion of waste plastics fraction to gasoline fraction (C 5 -C 12 hydrocarbons). The preparation of catalysts was performed by reacting a natural zeolite with the precursor of Ni(NO 3) 2. 9 H 2 O and PdCl 2 in an ammonia solution (25 %). The modifications were performed by varying the rasio of Ni/Pd loaded to the zeolite, whereas the Pd was previously loaded and total metal content was 1 wt. % based on the zeolite. The characterization of catalysts included determination of acidity gravimetrically by adsorption of ammonia or pyridine vapour  base method, metal content by Atomic Adsorption Spectrophotometer (AAS) and X-ray Fluoresence (XRF) and crystallinity by X-ray Diffraction (XRD). The treatment of catalysts using Etilene Diamine Tetra Acetic acid  (EDTA) was performed to study the metal distribution on the outer or inner surface of the zeolite. The characterization results showed that the loading of metals to the zeolite increased its acidity and decreased its spesific surface area, however, did not defect its crystallnity.   The metals loaded on the zeolite were distributed inside the pore and at outer surface of the zeolite. For all catalyst samples, the acidities determined using ammonia were higher than those of pyridine, and the acidities determined before the EDTA treatment was lower than those after the treatment.   Metal contents of the zeolite before the EDTA treatment were higher than those after the treatment. The EDTA treatment enhanced the crystallinity of the sampel. The relationship between the metal rasio towards the acidity of the catalyst samples were in variation. Catalyst samples produced in this research have good characters, thus promisingly can be used for conversion process of waste plastics to gasoline fraction.     Keywords: <b>natural</b> zeolite, <b>acidity,</b> metal content, crystallinity, EDT...|$|R
40|$|Global {{climate models}} predict {{increased}} temperature and precipitation in the Georgia Basin, British Colmbia; however, {{little is known}} about the impacts on high-elevation regions. In the current study, fifty-four high-elevation lakes (754 – 2005 [*]m a. s. l.) were studied to investigate the potential influence of climate change on surface water acid-sensitivity. Redundancy analysis indicated that the concentration of nitrate, dissolved organic carbon, and associated metals was significantly influenced by climate parameters. Furthermore, these components differed significantly between biogeoclimatic zones. Modelled soil base cation weathering for a subset of the study lakes (n= 11) was predicted to increase by 9 % per 1 °C increase in temperature. Changes in temperature and precipitation may potentially decrease the pH of surface waters owing to changes in anthropogenic deposition and organic acid production. In contrast, increased soil base cation weathering may increase the critical load (of acidity) of high-elevation lakes. Ultimately, the determining factor will be whether enhanced base cation weathering is sufficient to buffer changes in <b>natural</b> and anthropogenic <b>acidity.</b> Mountain and high-elevation regions are considered early warning systems to climate change; as such, future monitoring is imperative to assess the potential ramifications of climate change on the hydrochemistry and acid-sensitivity of these surface waters...|$|R
40|$|The near-stream zone {{has been}} {{identified}} as an important control of runoff chemistry. In northern forested areas, near-stream zones {{have been found to be}} both natural sources and sinks for acidity. The near-stream zone can be a buffer against acidity by cation exchange and sulphate reduction. Oxidation of sulphide and leaching of organic acids are <b>natural</b> sources of <b>acidity</b> from the near-stream zone. A relatively high pH and base saturation in the near-stream zone favours nitrogen cycling processes. Hence, the near-stream zone has a potential to control nitrogen leaching from the catchment. Nitrogen can be retained by denitrification, microbial immobilisation and plant uptake. On the other hand, mineralisation, nitrification and leaching of organic matter can make the near-stream zone into a source for nitrogen to the stream water. The geomorphology and the hydrological flow paths are likely to be crucial for the function of the near-stream zone. This thesis reports the results from an investigation on a small forested catchment in central south Sweden, designed to clarify the effect of processes in the nearstream zone on acidity and nitrogen chemistry in runoff. Both hydrological and water chemistry data suggested that runoff was dominated by superficial ground water, which agrees with what is commonly found in Swedish till soils. The Kindla catchment is heavily affected by acidification with a pH in the stream water between 4. 4 and 4. 6. Despite the severe acidification, there were no indications of forest decline at the Kindla catchment that retains nitrogen in deposition efficiently.
