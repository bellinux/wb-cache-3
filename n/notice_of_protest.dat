5000|$|On 1 December 2009, it was {{announced}} that the Ambleside Campus would be 'mothballed' at the end of July 2010, and will no longer take new undergraduate students. The action by the University of Cumbria, if seen through, will end over 175 years of heritage and a protest was held on 1 December 2009 by the student body, with more action to follow. This is despite fierce opposition from the Ambleside students, the townspeople of Ambleside, and in spite of the support that Tim Farron MP has pledged to the campus and students. [...] "Hundreds of local people have signed this petition and that shows how committed the community is to stopping this closure from happening.

40|$|After the January 2015 {{attacks in}} Paris, Muslims {{from all over}} the world showed {{impressive}} solidarity with the victims. This was the more surprising given that the victims included cartoonists working for the satirical magazine "Charlie Hebdo", whose caricatures of Mohammed had previously caused mass protests in predominantly Muslim states. However, European media took more <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> the <b>protests</b> against the new edition of the satirical magazine than of the declarations of solidarity. This selective perception can partly be explained by the fact that European societies constantly expect Muslims to distance themselves from violent acts committed in the name of Islam. These demands reinforce negative associations of Islam with terrorism and violence, and nourish threat perceptions and anti-Islamic prejudices, which in turn contribute to Muslims feeling increasingly excluded in Europe. Extremists can take advantage of this alienation for recruiting purposes. To counter this danger, politicians and the media must act decisively against negative portrayals of Islam and reduce the pressure put on Muslims to justify themselves, a pressure that deepens the division of European societies.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to analyze current {{legislation}} <b>of</b> <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> termination and refer {{to some of the}} questionable area of this termination. The thesis also offers some of the proposals of amendments de lege ferenda. Reasons of these proposals are that <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> termination of employment as unilateral legal act brings negative aftermath mainly for employee, but in some cases also for employer and legislation should prevent these negative effects or at least minimized them. The thesis is divided into seven chapters. The first chapter deals with position of labor law and his relationship with the civil law, due to subsidiary using of the civil code. The second chapter describes the legal facts that lead to the <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> termination, with an emphasis on legal act, because <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> termination is an unilateral legal act which must fulfill the statutory requirements. The third chapter discusses national and international sources of law <b>of</b> regulation <b>of</b> <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> termination. The main part of the thesis is contained in chapter four, which deals with the current legislation <b>of</b> <b>notice</b> <b>of</b> termination.
