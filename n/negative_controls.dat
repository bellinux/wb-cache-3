5|$|Holocaust deniers {{claim that}} Zyklon B gas {{was not used}} in the gas chambers, relying for {{evidence}} on the research of Fred A. Leuchter, who found low levels of Prussian blue in samples of the gas chamber walls and ceilings. Leuchter attributed its presence to general delousing of the buildings. Leuchter's negative control, a sample of gasket material taken from a different camp building, had no cyanide residue. In 1999, James Roth, the chemist who had analyzed Leuchter's samples, stated that the test was flawed because the material that was sent for testing included large chunks, and the chemical would only be within 10 microns of the surface. The surface that {{had been exposed to}} the chemical was not identified, and the large size of the specimens meant that any chemical present was diluted by an undeterminable amount. In 1994, the Institute for Forensic Research in Kraków re-examined Leuchter's claim, stating that formation of Prussian blue by exposure of bricks to cyanide is not a highly probable reaction. Using microdiffusion techniques, they tested 22 samples from the gas chambers and delousing chambers (as positive controls) and living quarters (as <b>negative</b> <b>controls).</b> They found cyanide residue in both the delousing chambers and the gas chambers but none in the living quarters.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{evaluate}} the effect of relaxin on fertility parameters of buffalo frozen/thawed sperm. Sperm were incubated {{in the absence of}} capacitating agents (<b>negative</b> <b>control),</b> with a known capacitating agent such as heparin (positive control) and with 50 and 100 ng/ml relaxin for 2 and 4 h. Sperm viability, motility, capacitation and the effect of relaxin on the fertilizing ability after heterologous IVF were evaluated. Although viability was not affected, relaxin increased (p < 0. 05) sperm motility compared to the <b>negative</b> and positive <b>controls</b> both after 2 h (60. 0 ± 2. 0, 60. 0 ± 3. 1, 68. 3 ± 1. 7 and 69. 4 ± 2. 7, respectively, in <b>negative</b> <b>control,</b> positive control, 50 and 100 ng/ml relaxin) and 4 h (55. 0 ± 2. 5, 53. 3 ± 3. 0, 62. 2 ± 3. 0 and 65. 0 ± 3. 2, respectively, in <b>negative</b> <b>control,</b> positive control, 50 and 100 ng/ml relaxin) incubation. When sperm were incubated with both 100 ng/ml relaxin and heparin, a decrease (p < 0. 01) of pattern A, that is low capacitation level, was observed compared to the <b>negative</b> <b>control</b> both after 2 h (54. 4, 34. 3 and 36. 4 %, respectively, in <b>negative</b> <b>control,</b> positive control and 100 ng/ml relaxin) and 4 h (51. 9, 35. 0 and 34. 3 %, respectively, in <b>negative</b> <b>control,</b> positive control and 100 ng/ml relaxin). Moreover, an increase (p < 0. 01) of pattern EA, that is high capacitation level, was recorded with 100 ng/ml relaxin and heparin compared to the <b>negative</b> <b>control</b> both after 2 h (44. 1, 59. 3 and 57. 7 %, respectively, in <b>negative</b> <b>control,</b> positive control and 100 ng/ml relaxin) and after 4 h (43. 0, 54. 4 and 56. 0 %, respectively, in <b>negative</b> <b>control,</b> positive control and 100 ng/ml relaxin). Finally, relaxin increased (p < 0. 01) cleavage rate compared to the <b>negative</b> <b>control</b> (57. 1 ± 4. 4, 72. 5 ± 6. 0, 71. 4 ± 5. 5 and 73. 6 ± 2. 9, respectively, in <b>negative</b> <b>control,</b> positive control, 50 and 100 ng/ml relaxin). In conclusion, relaxin has a beneficial effect on motility, capacitation and fertilizing ability of frozen-thawed buffalo sperm...|$|R

25|$|The {{enzyme-linked}} immunosorbent assay or ELISA is {{a diagnostic}} method for quantitatively or semi-quantitatively determining protein concentrations from blood plasma, serum or cell/tissue extracts in a multi-well plate format (usually 96-wells per plate). Broadly, proteins in solution are adsorbed to ELISA plates. Antibodies specific for the protein of interest are used to probe the plate. Background is minimised by optimising blocking and washing methods (as for IHC), and specificity is ensured via the presence of positive and <b>negative</b> <b>controls.</b> Detection methods are usually colorimetric or chemiluminescence based.|$|E
25|$|The {{labelled}} {{product is}} generated via reverse transcription and sometimes with an optional PCR amplification. The RNA is reverse transcribed with either polyT primers (which amplify only mRNA) or random primers (which amplify all RNA, {{most of which}} is rRNA); miRNA microarrays ligate an oligonucleotide to the purified small RNA (isolated with a fractionator), which is then reverse transcribed and amplified. The label is added either during the reverse transcription step, or following amplification if it is performed. The sense labelling {{is dependent on the}} microarray; e.g. if the label is added with the RT mix, the cDNA is antisense and the microarray probe is sense, except in the case of <b>negative</b> <b>controls.</b> The label is typically fluorescent; only one machine uses radiolabels. The labelling can be direct (not used) or indirect (requires a coupling stage). For two-channel arrays, the coupling stage occurs before hybridization, using aminoallyl uridine triphosphate (aminoallyl-UTP, or aaUTP) and NHS amino-reactive dyes (such as cyanine dyes); for single-channel arrays, the coupling stage occurs after hybridization, using biotin and labelled streptavidin. The modified nucleotides (usually in a ratio of 1 aaUTP: 4 TTP (thymidine triphosphate)) are added enzymatically in a low ratio to normal nucleotides, typically resulting in 1 every 60 bases. The aaDNA is then purified with a column (using a phosphate buffer solution, as Tris contains amine groups). The aminoallyl group is an amine group on a long linker attached to the nucleobase, which reacts with a reactive dye. A form of replicate known as a dye flip can be performed to remove any dye effects in two-channel experiments; for a dye flip, a second slide is used, with the labels swapped (the sample that was labeled with Cy3 in the first slide is labeled with Cy5, and vice versa). In this example, aminoallyl-UTP is present in the reverse-transcribed mixture.|$|E
500|$|On the trial's third day, {{the plaintiffs}} {{presented}} their next argument, {{which was that}} the Uhlmann paper, which had reported the presence of vaccine-strain measles virus in the GI tract of children with autism, used reliable PCR techniques to detect said virus.

[...] She also contended that the two studies that had failed to replicate the Uhlmann paper's results were flawed for two reasons: because they looked at cells of children with autism rather than in their GI tract, and {{because they did not}} test children with autism with gastrointestinal dysfunction.|$|E
40|$|Aim The {{present study}} {{examined}} the relationship between parenting and the sibling relationship quality and the potential moderating effect of gender combination of sibling pairs. Method Online questionnaires were completed by 392 Dutch parents concerning their warm and <b>negative</b> <b>controlling</b> parenting and concerning the amount of warmth and conflict in the sibling relationship of their children. Target children were between 4 - 6 years old and had at least one (older/ younger) sibling. Results The results indicate that warm parenting is positive associated with warmth in the sibling relationship whereas <b>negative</b> <b>control</b> is not associated with warmth. Also, <b>negative</b> parental <b>control</b> is positive with more sibling conflict whereas warm parenting is not associated with sibling conflict. Brother-brother pairs received significantly more paternal <b>negative</b> <b>control</b> and had more sibling conflict. It appears that maternal <b>negative</b> <b>control</b> is associated with less sibling warmth only in brother pairs and paternal <b>negative</b> <b>control</b> is associated with less sibling warmth only in sister pairs. Maternal <b>negative</b> <b>control</b> is also associated with more sibling conflict only in heterogeneous gender combination pairs. Conclusion We found several significant links between parenting and sibling relationship quality, and indications for moderation effects of sibling gender combination. Future research should include this moderator. Some limitations and implications for future research are mentioned in the discussion...|$|R

Dietary treatments consisted of: (1) a positive control diet formulated to provide 90 % of the standardized ileal digestible (SID) lysine requirement for these pigs; (2) a <b>negative</b> <b>control</b> diet formulated to provide 90 % of the SID lysine requirement minus the expected nutrient release (both amino acids and dietary energy) from the protease enzyme (CIBENZA DP 100, Novus International, Inc., St. Charles, MO), and (3) the <b>negative</b> <b>control</b> diet with the addition of 0. 05 % CIBENZA DP 100. The diets were formulated such that the <b>negative</b> <b>control</b> diet containing the protease enzyme had calculated nutrient concentrations similar to the positive control. Pens of pigs were randomly allotted to 1 of 3 treatments with 26 pigs per pen and 15 replicates per treatment. Overall (d 0 to 131), pigs fed the positive control diet had increased (P < 0. 05) ADG compared with pigs fed the <b>negative</b> <b>control</b> diet. Pigs fed the <b>negative</b> <b>control</b> diet plus CIBENZA DP 100 had improved (P < 0. 05) ADFI and a tendency for improved (P = 0. 09) ADG compared with pigs fed the <b>negative</b> <b>control</b> diet without the enzyme. No differences were observed in ADG, ADFI, or F/G between pigs fed the positive control diet and those fed the <b>negative</b> <b>control</b> diet plus the protease enzyme, which suggests that the release values attributed to the enzyme are accurate. The only observed effect on carcass characteristics was for yield, in which the pigs fed the <b>negative</b> <b>control</b> diet with the enzyme had lower (P < 0. 05) carcass yield than pigs fed the <b>negative</b> <b>control</b> diet without the enzyme. Although differences did exist in feed cost per pig and feed cost per pound of gain, no differences were observed for income over feed cost (IOFC) between treatments. These data suggest that the protease enzyme CIBENZA DP 100 will elicit improved growth performance when added to diets formulated at 90 % of the pig’s estimated SID lysine requirement...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{development}} of approaches for synthesis and optimization of reversible circuits received significant {{attention in the}} past. This {{is partly due to}} the increasing emphasis on low power design methodologies, and partly motivated by recent works in quantum computation. While most of them relied on a gate library composed of multiple-control Toffoli (MCT) gates with positive control lines, some initial works also exist which additionally incorporate <b>negative</b> <b>control</b> lines. This usually leads to smaller circuits with respect to the number of gates as well as the corresponding quantum costs. However, despite these benefits, <b>negative</b> <b>control</b> lines have hardly been considered in post-synthesis optimization of reversible circuits so far. In this paper, we address this issue. We are presenting an optimization scheme inspired by template matching which explicitly makes use of <b>negative</b> <b>control</b> lines.
