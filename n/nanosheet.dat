40|$|The {{synthesis}} of Cu-doped ZnO <b>nanosheets</b> {{at room temperature}} was reported in our previous paper. The effects of annealing temperature on Cu-doped ZnO <b>nanosheets</b> were studied in this paper. Cu-doped ZnO <b>nanosheets</b> were annealed at 200 - 500 degrees C in air. The annealed specimens were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The results show that Cu concentration in Cu-doped ZnO <b>nanosheets</b> reduced with increasing annealing temperature. When annealing temperature was lower than Zn melting point (410 degrees C), the morphologies of the Cu-doped ZnO <b>nanosheets</b> remained nearly {{the same as that}} before annealing. However, when the annealing temperature was over Zn melting point, Cu-doped ZnO <b>nanosheets</b> changed to nanowires, wormlike <b>nanosheets</b> or did not change. The change of Cu concentration in Cu-doped ZnO <b>nanosheets</b> is explained by oxidation thermodynamics. A physical model is suggested to explain the morphology changes of Cu-doped ZnO <b>nanosheets,</b> based on the existence of Cu-rich layer beneath Cu-doped ZnO <b>nanosheets.</b> Department of Mechanical Engineerin...|$|R

40|$|Ferroelectric {{perovskite}} KNbO 3 (KNO) <b>nanosheets</b> with cubic and orthorhombic phases were synthesized by {{a simple}} soft chemistry exfoliation at room temperature. KNO <b>nanosheets</b> could be simply obtained by peeling off the layered precursor K 2 NbO 3 F in water, while the phase structure of KNO could be controlled by using different precursors. The cubic KNO <b>nanosheets</b> were formed by exfoliating-restacking, while the orthorhombic <b>nanosheets</b> were produced by nucleation-ripening. The photocatalytic performance of these <b>nanosheets</b> has been exploited in degradation Rhodamine B dye. The cubic KNO <b>nanosheets</b> showed obviously better photocatalytic activity, which could be ascribed to its highest symmetry in the bulk structure and its unique electron structure.

50|$|Chemical vapor {{deposition}} of molybdenum disulfide <b>nanosheets</b> involves reacting molybdenum and sulfur precursors on a substrate at high temperatures. This technique {{is often used}} in the preparing electrical devices with molybdenum disulfide components because the <b>nanosheets</b> are applied directly on the substrate; unfavorable interactions between the substrate and the <b>nanosheets</b> that would have occurred had they been separately synthesized are decreased. In addition, since the thickness and area of the molybdenum disulfide <b>nanosheets</b> can be controlled by the selection of specific precursors, the electrical properties of the <b>nanosheets</b> can be tuned.|$|R

30|$|In summary, MoS 2 <b>nanosheets</b> of {{different}} sizes were fabricated by exfoliation of bulk MoS 2 in DMF solution. Magnetic measurements indicate that all the fabricated MoS 2 <b>nanosheets</b> show obvious RT FM, and the enhanced FM was observed as {{the size of the}} <b>nanosheets</b> decreases.

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} a facile synthetic method to prepare lateral size controlled molybdenum diselenide (MoSe 2) <b>nanosheets</b> using liquid phase exfoliated few-layer MoSe 2 <b>nanosheets</b> {{as a starting}} material. By precisely controlling the centrifugation condition, preparation of MoSe 2 <b>nanosheets</b> with a narrow size distribution ranging from several hundred nanometers to several micrometers could be realized. The accurate size control of MoSe 2 <b>nanosheets</b> offers us {{a great opportunity to}} examine the size dependent sensing properties. The sensing test results demonstrate that the MoSe 2 <b>nanosheets</b> provide competitive advantages compared with conventional graphene based sensors. A tradeoff phenomenon on sensing response and recovery as the lateral size of MoSe 2 <b>nanosheets</b> varies is observed. First principles calculations reveal that the ratio of edge-surface sites is responsible for this phenomenon.

It is similar in geometry to its all-carbon analog graphene, but has very different chemical and electronic properties - contrary to the black and highly conducting graphene, BN nanosheets are electrical insulators with a band gap of ~5.9 eV, and therefore appear white in color.|$|E
50|$|This {{makes them}} {{one of the}} {{thinnest}} known two-dimensional organic crystalline materials with an area to thickness ratio of greater than 109 nm. Peptoid nanosheets were discovered in the laboratory of Dr. Ron Zuckermann at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in 2010. Due {{to the ability to}} customize peptoids and therefore the properties of the peptoid <b>nanosheet,</b> it has possible applications in the areas of drug and small molecule delivery and biosensing.|$|E

The size of the PbO <b>nanosheet</b> can be tuned by gold NPs and [...] concentration in the growth solution. No organic surfactants were employed in the synthesis process. Oriented attachment, in which the sheets form by aggregation of small nanoparticles that each has a net dipole moment, and ostwald ripening are the two main reasons {{for the formation of}} the PbO nanosheets.|$|E

He reported the organosilane-directed synthesis route to the mesoporous zeolites in Nature Materials (2006). Ryoo also released {{an article on the}} synthesis of single-unit-cell thick <b>nanosheet</b> zeolites in Nature (2009). In this approach, a surfactant chemically incorporating a zeolite structure-directing head group was used, which can generate zeolite micropores as well as mesoporous structures simultaneously in a single synthesis step.|$|E
50|$|The most {{commonly}} used <b>nanosheet</b> synthesis methods use a bottom-up approach, e.g., pre-organization and polymerization at interfaces like Langmuir-Blodgett films, solution phase synthesis and chemical vapor deposition (CVD). For example, CdTe (cadmium telluride) nanosheets could be synthesized by precipitating and aging CdTe nanoparticles in deionized water. The formation of free-floating CdTe nanosheets was due to directional hydrophobic attraction and anisotropic electrostatic interactions caused by dipole moment and small positive charges. Molecular simulations through a coarse-grained model with parameters from semi-empirical quantum mechanics calculations {{can be used to}} prove the experimental process.|$|E

Doped graphene layers {{have also}} shown the similar surface plasmon effects {{to that of}} metallic thin films. Through the engineering of metallic substrates or nanoparticles (e.g., gold, silver and copper) with graphene, the plasmonic properties of the hybrid structures could be tuned for improving the optoelectronic device performances. It {{is worth noting that}} the electrons at the metallic structure could transfer to the graphene conduction band. This is attributed to the zero bandgap property of graphene <b>nanosheet.</b>|$|E

50|$|Graphene is a 2D <b>nanosheet</b> with atomic thin {{thickness}} {{in terms}} of 0.34 nm. Due to the ultrathin thickness, graphene showed many properties that are quite different from their bulk graphite counterparts.

Thus, it exhibits potential for applications in optics and electronics especially for the development of wearable devices as flexible substrates. More importantly, the optical absorption rate of graphene is 2.3% in the visible and near-infrared region. This broadband absorption characteristic also attracted great attention of the research community to exploit the graphene-based photodetectors/modulators.|$|E

50|$|For assembly, a {{purified}} amphiphilic polypeptoid {{of specific}} sequence is dissolved in aqueous solution. These form a monolayer (Langmuir-Blodgett film) on the air-water interface with their hydrophobic side chains oriented in air and hydrophilic side chains in the water. When this mono-layer is shrunk, it buckles into a bilayer with the hydrophobic groups forming the interior {{core of the}} peptoid <b>nanosheet.</b> This method has been standardized in the Zuckermann laboratory by repetitively tilting vials of peptoid solution at 85° before returning the vials to the upright position. This repetitive vial “rocking” motion lessens the interfacial area of the air-water interface inside the vial, compressing the peptoid mono-layer {{by a factor of}} four and causing the mono-layer to buckle into peptoid nanosheets. Using this method, nanosheets are produced in high yield, and 95% of the peptoid polymer starting material is efficiently converted into peptoid nanosheets after rocking the vials several hundred times.|$|E
