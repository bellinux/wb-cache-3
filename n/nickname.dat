40|$|The aim of {{the study}} is to examine the modern {{everyday}} use of <b>nicknames.</b> The study is based on two different types of material – questionnaires and interviews. In contrast to previous nicknames-studies in Sweden, this study considers, not only different sorts of <b>nicknames,</b> even though this has been taken into consideration, but the function of the <b>nicknames</b> in everyday communication. The observations are based on the name-bearer’s own estimation of his or her <b>nickname(s).</b> The theoretical framework is a combination of onomastics, sociolinguistic, identity-theoretical, and interactional theories. The results demonstrate that the use of <b>nicknames</b> is an important social act that can be either positive or negative for the nickname-users. Six naming environments have been identified for the nicknames’ occurrence: childhood family, childhood friends, sports context, adulthood friends, partner and other. It appears that <b>nicknames</b> are co-creators of a gender and a youth identity. Three different functions for <b>nicknames</b> have been identified: affective function, relation function and positioning function. Finally, this study argues that there are two dimensions, public–private and exclusive–inclusive, that are useful in describing the use of <b>nicknames...</b>|$|R

The intention of this article is twofold: to contribute to research on African <b>nicknaming,</b> often limited to <b>nicknaming</b> as mere verbal play, by illustrating their communicative utility and to present the common functions <b>nicknames</b> fufill in particular relationships and situations.

The forms <b>nicknames</b> take and <b>nicknaming</b> patterns depend on the social distance between the participants, their relative social status, the context of <b>nicknaming</b> and the speaker's intention. The data for this article come from (a) field noted from participant observations taken of naturally occurring in public and private spheres over a period of one year (from September 2003 to September 2004) in and around the city of Harare and (b) transcriptions of semi-structured indepth interviews conducted with 60 Shona native speakers of varying age, gender, social status, occupations and religious affiliation...|$|R
