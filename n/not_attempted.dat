5|$|A last {{option was}} to attack fighter factories, which was <b>not</b> <b>attempted</b> on 18 August. Only the Spitfire factory at Southampton and the Hawker factory in Surrey were {{within range of}} escorted bombers. Without the Bf 109s, the bombers would suffer heavy {{casualties}} attempting to attack factories further north in daylight. Still, {{the attacks on the}} southern factories would require large concentrations of bombers and fighters which would be powerful enough to destroy them without sustaining heavy losses.|$|E
5|$|A {{subsequent}} {{federal investigation}} into the incident found that the error coins had been struck accidentally, but two former Mint employees were guilty of selling some of the dollars, resulting in imprisonment and fines for both individuals. In 2002, Mint officials announced {{that two of the}} ten coins then reported had entered circulation through legal channels, but the other eight were of dubious origins and might be seized. However, as of 2011, the federal government has <b>not</b> <b>attempted</b> to seize the eight examples considered of dubious origin.|$|E

While the Saudi 8th Battalion continued operations in the southern portion of the city, the 7th Battalion began to clear the northern sector of the city. Iraqi resistance was sporadic and most Iraqi soldiers surrendered on sight; as a result, the city was recaptured on 1 February 1991.|$|E

5|$|Fliegerkorps II sent 650 sorties against Pedestal from 11–14 August {{and claimed}} 12 {{aircraft}} shot down for 18 losses. Total Axis losses were 62 aircraft, 42 Italian and 19 German, including losses {{on the ground}} and those shot down by their own side. Royal Navy gunners and Fleet Air Arm fighters claimed 74 aircraft shot down but actually destroyed 42 Axis aircraft, 26 from the Regia Aeronautica and 16 Luftwaffe aircraft. The Fleet Air Arm lost thirteen aircraft on operations and sixteen Sea Hurricanes when Eagle was sunk, the RAF lost a Beaufighter and five Spitfires and a Sunderland was shot down by Giada. The Allies could not risk such losses again and another large convoy to Malta was <b>not</b> <b>attempted</b> until November 1942, when the re-capture of airfields in Egypt and Libya after the Second Battle of El Alamein made it much easier to provide land-based air cover.|$|E
5|$|In October 2005, Foyt {{announced}} {{that at the}} end of the 2005 season, he would leave Foyt Enterprises and drive in the NASCAR Busch Series for the #38 Akins Motorsports team and was signed as a developmental driver for Evernham Motorsports. He ran several events in the #38 late in 2005, but failed to produce results. In 2006, he was scheduled to run the entire Busch Series schedule in the #38 and be a competitor for the Rookie of the Year award. However, early in the 2006 season, Akins was purchased by Braun Racing, which switched the #38 from Dodge to Chevrolet bodies. Foyt had an exclusive contract with Dodge that prevented him from continuing with the team. After a week off, Ray Evernham found him a ride with FitzBradshaw Racing, but he failed to qualify for his first race with the team and has <b>not</b> <b>attempted</b> a NASCAR race since.|$|E
5|$|Jerusalem {{had been}} well-fortified after Heraclius recaptured {{it from the}} Persians. After the Byzantine defeat at Yarmouk, the Patriarch of Jerusalem Sophronius {{repaired}} its defenses. The Muslims had so far <b>not</b> <b>attempted</b> any siege of the city. However, since 634, Saracen forces {{had the potential to}} threaten all routes to the city. Although it was not encircled, it had been in a state of siege since the Muslims captured the neighboring forts of Pella and Bosra. After the Battle of Yarmouk, the city was severed from the rest of Syria, and was presumably being prepared for a siege that seemed inevitable. When the Muslim army reached Jericho, Sophronius collected all the holy relics including the True Cross, and secretly sent them to the coast, to be taken to Constantinople. The Muslim troops besieged the city some time in November 636. Instead of relentless assaults on the city, they decided to press on with the siege until the Byzantines ran short of supplies and a bloodless surrender could be negotiated.|$|E

5|$|King's first {{target was}} the smaller and slower Waakzaamheid, which was {{windward}} of Furie and thus {{would have to}} sail into the wind to link with Pletz's ship. King rapidly closed with the corvette, avoiding contact with the larger Furie as he did so. At 09:00 Sirius came alongside Waakzaamheid and fired a gun at her, prompting van Neirop to immediately surrender. Furie had <b>not</b> <b>attempted</b> {{to come to the}} flagship's aid and resistance against the much larger Sirius would have been futile. King despatched boats containing a prize crew and removed most of the prisoners from Waakzaamheid, placing them below decks on Sirius. Once the prize was secure, King immediately set off in pursuit of Furie, which was attempting to flee to the west and had nearly disappeared over the horizon. For {{the rest of the day}} the pursuit continued, Furie unable to escape the faster British ship, which steadily gained during the afternoon until at 17:00 was within range of the Dutch frigate.|$|E
