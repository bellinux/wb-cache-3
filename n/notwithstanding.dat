5|$|<b>Notwithstanding</b> his conviction, Hastert {{continues}} to receive his congressional pension, which amounts to about $73,000 a year.|$|E
5|$|<b>Notwithstanding</b> the {{competition}} between those two states, in 1937 the Wrights' final bicycle shop and home were moved from Dayton to Greenfield Village in Dearborn, Michigan, where they remain.|$|E
5|$|<b>Notwithstanding</b> the hiatus {{after moving}} from Frankfurt, the 1870s {{were one of}} Busch's most {{productive}} decades. In 1874 he produced the short illustrated tale Diddle-Boom! (Dideldum!).|$|E
5|$|As 2015 began, Ruf {{once again}} {{had to fight}} for playing time; there was no clear opening {{for him on the}} Phillies' roster, <b>notwithstanding</b> {{the fact that he was}} one of the few players on the roster with the ability to hit for power.|$|E
5|$|For {{those who}} remained, new {{economic}} opportunities emerged through {{the export of}} cattle, commercial fishing and tourism. Nonetheless emigration and military service became the choice of many and the archipelago's populations continued to dwindle throughout the late 19th century and {{for much of the}} 20th century. Lengthy periods of continuous occupation <b>notwithstanding,</b> many of the smaller islands were abandoned.|$|E
5|$|In Caplin & Drysdale v. United States (1989), the Court {{held that}} there is no Sixth Amendment {{exception}} to criminal forfeiture; i.e., after conviction, the government can seek forfeiture of already paid legal fees under a forfeiture statute, <b>notwithstanding</b> the effect on the defendant's ability to retain counsel of choice.|$|E
5|$|National Rail {{services}} {{are available for}} onward journeys, from stations at Oban, which has direct services to Glasgow. However, parliamentary approval <b>notwithstanding,</b> plans in the 1890s to lay a railway connection to Ullapool were unable to obtain sufficient funding.|$|E
5|$|<b>Notwithstanding</b> these varied {{aspects of}} his public life, Rockefeller may {{ultimately}} be remembered simply for the raw size of his wealth. In 1902, an audit showed Rockefeller was worth about $200 million—compared to the total national GDP of $24 billion then.|$|E
5|$|The {{basic variant}} of the {{national}} flag is a plain white-and-red horizontal bicolor. A variant defaced with the coat of arms is restricted to official use abroad and at sea. Legal restrictions <b>notwithstanding,</b> the two variants are often treated as interchangeable in practice.|$|E
5|$|With {{the arrival}} of the year 2012, Nostradamus's prophecies started to be co-opted (especially by the History Channel) as {{evidence}} suggesting {{that the end of the}} world was imminent, <b>notwithstanding</b> the fact that his book never mentions the end of the world, let alone the year 2012.|$|E
5|$|Although this {{campaign}} ultimately secured Ælfgar's reinstatement, Ælfgar (then Earl of Mercia) was again exiled from England in 1058, {{and proceeded to}} ally himself with Gruffudd ap Llywelyn and a Norse fleet. <b>Notwithstanding</b> the fact that Scandinavian sources fail to report this operation, the Annals of Tigernach reveals that {{the leader of the}} fleet was Magnús (died 1069), son of Haraldr Sigurðarson, King of Norway (died 1066), and further reports that Magnús' forces were composed of Orcadians, Islesmen, and Dubliners.|$|E
5|$|Association {{football}} in {{itself does not}} have a classical history. <b>Notwithstanding</b> any similarities to other ball games played around the world FIFA has recognised that no historical connection exists with any game played in antiquity outside Europe. The modern rules of association football are based on the mid-19th century efforts to standardise the widely varying forms of football played in the public schools of England. The history of {{football in}} England dates back to at least the eighth century AD.|$|E
5|$|At Hanford, top {{priority}} was initially {{given to the}} installations in the 300 area. This contained buildings for testing materials, preparing uranium, and assembling and calibrating instrumentation. One of the buildings housed the canning equipment for the uranium slugs, while another contained a small test reactor. <b>Notwithstanding</b> the high priority allocated to it, work on the 300 area fell behind schedule due to the unique and complex nature of the 300 area facilities, and wartime shortages of labor and materials.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the {{tendering}} process, {{the four}} G3 battlecruisers were ordered on 24 October 1921, without names, from John Brown, Swan Hunter, William Beardmore and Fairfield. Following the visit of an Admiralty delegation, detailed constructional drawings were sent to John Brown on 3 November with a request that copies be urgently circulated to the other successful contractors. Work at John Brown progressed on the keel blocks and hull plates for the subsequent two weeks. <b>Notwithstanding</b> other events, instructions and amendments continued to arrive from various departments within the Admiralty until 25 November.|$|E
5|$|Augustus {{bestowed}} only {{properties and}} possessions to his designated heirs, as an obvious system of institutionalized imperial inheritance would have provoked resistance and hostility among the republican-minded Romans fearful of monarchy. With {{regards to the}} Principate, {{it was obvious to}} Augustus that Marcellus was not ready to take on his position; nonetheless, by giving his signet ring to Agrippa, Augustus intended to signal to the legions that Agrippa was to be his successor, and that constitutional procedure <b>notwithstanding,</b> they should continue to obey Agrippa.|$|E
5|$|Children {{stayed at}} the orphanage for up to 10 years, graduating {{at the age of}} 18. They came from all parts of Palestine as well as Syria, Egypt, Ethiopia, Armenia, Turkey, Russia, Iran, and Germany. They were also of differing {{religious}} denominations, including Protestant, Greek Orthodox, Catholic, Coptic, and Maronite. <b>Notwithstanding</b> the ethnic diversity of the student body, the language of instruction was German and Arabic. Most of the teachers employed during the orphanage’s first 50 years were German, with some Armenians and Arabs.|$|E
5|$|Depressed by {{his lack}} of {{widespread}} appreciation and suffering from writer's block, Ochs did not record any further albums. He slipped deeper into depression and alcoholism. His personal problems <b>notwithstanding,</b> Ochs performed at the inaugural benefit for Greenpeace on October 16, 1970, at the Pacific Coliseum in Vancouver, BC. A recording of his performance, along with performances by Joni Mitchell and James Taylor, was released by Greenpeace in 2009.|$|E
5|$|In 1758 the State of New Jersey {{purchased}} the Indian title to lands in that State, {{and as a}} consideration for the purchase, bought a tract of land as a residence for the Indians, having previously passed an act declaring that such lands should not be subject thereafter to any tax by the State, any law or usage, or law then existing, to the contrary <b>notwithstanding.</b> The Indians, {{from the time of}} purchase, lived upon the land until the year 1801, when they were authorized, by an act of the Legislature, to sell the land.|$|E
5|$|<b>Notwithstanding</b> Aaronson's small readership, V. Gollancz {{published}} a second verse collection in 1933, titled Poems. Despite being little {{known to the}} general public, Aaronson gained a cult following of dedicated readers. His third collection, The Homeward Journey and Other Poems, was published in 1946 by Christophers, a small London publisher. Some of his works also appeared in journals and anthologies such as the 1953 Faber Book of Twentieth Century Verse.|$|E
5|$|<b>Notwithstanding</b> Godley's {{efforts to}} placate him, Allen again raised his {{concerns}} over the extent of New Zealand's contributions to the war relative to Australia's and sought further explanation for the New Zealand losses of 12 October. Allen was also beginning to query the quality of British generalship. Godley raised {{the prospect of being}} replaced as commander of the NZEF, and proposed Major General Andrew Hamilton Russell, the commander of the New Zealand Division, as his successor. This never eventuated and Godley remained the commander of the NZEF until its disbandment in late 1919.|$|E
5|$|<b>Notwithstanding</b> that in NASA's {{judgment}} {{the contractor}} later made {{significant progress in}} overcoming the problems, the committee believes {{it should have been}} informed of the situation. The committee does not object to the position of the Administrator of NASA, that all details of Government/contractor relationships should not be put in the public domain. However, that position in no way can be used as an argument for not bringing this or other serious situations {{to the attention of the}} committee.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} side, the cement {{industry}} in Iran {{is one of}} the economic sectors that will be hit the hardest in Iran following of the subsidy reform plan, because many Iranian cement factories are energy inefficient (<b>Notwithstanding</b> possible adjustment and/or liberalization of commodities prices by the government during implementation). Taxi, delivery and truck drivers have also been adversely affected by the recent gas price increase. Experts believe that the removal of subsidies is likely to have an adverse impact on the profitability of the automotive sector {{for at least the next}} 2–3 years.|$|E
5|$|Over {{his four}} years as Secretary of Defense, Cheney {{downsized}} the military and his budgets showed negative real growth, despite pressures to acquire weapon systems advocated by Congress. The Department of Defense's total obligational authority in current dollars declined from $291 billion to $270 billion. Total military personnel strength decreased by 19 percent, from about 2.2 million in 1989 to about 1.8 million in 1993. <b>Notwithstanding</b> the overall reduction in military spending, Cheney directed {{the development of a}} Pentagon plan to ensure U.S. military dominance in the post-Cold War era.|$|E
5|$|Owing {{to a lack}} of {{confidence}} in the local currency, the US dollar is widely accepted as a medium of exchange alongside the Somali shilling. Dollarization <b>notwithstanding,</b> the large issuance of the Somali shilling has increasingly fueled price hikes, especially for low value transactions. This inflationary environment, however, is expected {{to come to an end}} as soon as the Central Bank assumes full control of monetary policy and replaces the presently circulating currency introduced by the private sector.|$|E
5|$|The ISA has its {{constitutional}} basis in Article 149 of the Constitution, which sanctions preventive detention {{and allows for}} laws passed by the legislature against subversion to override the Articles protecting the personal liberties of the individual. Specifically, Article 149(1) declares such legislation to be valid <b>notwithstanding</b> any inconsistency with five of the fundamental liberty provisions in the Constitution, including Article 9. Thus, detentions under the ISA cannot be challenged {{on the basis of}} deprivation of these rights.|$|E
5|$|The {{case was}} remanded to the Ninth Circuit, which {{declared}} the arbitration agreement unconscionable under California law. That precluded arbitration proceedings and allowed Adams {{to pursue a}} regular lawsuit in California courts. Adams was then able to pursue the original claims <b>notwithstanding</b> the decision by Justice Kennedy. In {{the aftermath of the}} case, legal analysts said that this case would be important for future arbitration case law.|$|E
5|$|The {{enactment}} specifies {{the amount}} of time which must elapse after a person is released from prison for serving time for particular groups of crimes. Ex-convicts punished for committing selected crimes, such as public endangerment, or participation in organized crime group or murder, if sentenced to more than 12 years imprisonment, may never fulfill this condition. There is a central registry of criminal offenses in the Czech Republic. The criminal integrity is reviewed <b>notwithstanding</b> any possible expungement of the records for other purposes.|$|E
5|$|The euro {{is divided}} into 100 cents (sometimes {{referred}} to as euro cents, especially when distinguishing them from other currencies, and referred to as such on the common side of all cent coins). In Community legislative acts the plural forms of euro and cent are spelled without the s, <b>notwithstanding</b> normal English usage. Otherwise, normal English plurals are sometimes used, with many local variations such as centime in France.|$|E
5|$|The {{success of}} Cleopatra <b>notwithstanding,</b> Etty {{remained}} {{a student at}} the RA and continued with a rigorous programme of study. Now in his mid 30s, he felt that for his work to progress beyond mere competence he needed a chance to study those European masters whose styles he most admired, despite his unpleasant experiences the last time he left England.|$|E
5|$|There are 11 {{recognised}} tiger subspecies. Two, the Trinil and Japanese tigers, became {{extinct in}} prehistoric times. The remaining subspecies all survived at least into the mid-20th century; {{three of these}} are also considered extinct. Their core historical range in South Asia (Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India, Pakistan), Eastern Asia (China, Mongolia, North Korea, Siberia, South Korea) and South East Asia, including three Indonesian islands, is severely constricted today, <b>notwithstanding</b> key extinct populations in the Black Sea (Iran, Georgia, Southern Russia, Turkey) and Central Asia (Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan).|$|E
5|$|After {{leaving his}} first wife, Elizabeth, he married {{for the second}} time, on 20 September 1858, to Adeline de Horsey, {{achieving}} still greater notoriety {{as he had been}} conducting an affair with her as his wife was dying. This, however, was a happy union, <b>notwithstanding</b> the disparity in their ages and Cardigan's disappointment that there were, again, no children. Adeline, excluded from fashionable society {{for the rest of her}} days, accustomed herself to life in the country, happily forsaking her previous interests of books, painting and music, while Brudenell spent large sums of money making their home together comfortable. Adeline even remained on good terms with Brudenell's principal mistress, Maria Marchioness of Ailesbury, and tolerated his other affairs.|$|E
5|$|After six weeks' {{training}} in the capital, the 1st Rhodesia Regiment travelled south by railway in late October 1914. During its stopover in Bulawayo, it paraded in front of about 90% of the town's population; Plumtree, the last stop before crossing the border, provided the soldiers with a lavish parting banquet. <b>Notwithstanding</b> these grand farewells, the Maritz Rebellion was all but over {{by the time the}} Southern Rhodesian contingent reached its destination at Bloemfontein. The vast majority of South African troops, including most of Boer origin, had remained loyal to the Union government, and the uprising had been quashed. The Rhodesians garrisoned Bloemfontein for about a month, then redeployed to Cape Town, where they underwent further training for the South-West Africa Campaign as part of South Africa's Northern Force, which Botha personally commanded.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there is}} no stand-your-ground law, the fact that {{necessary}} defense (unlike utmost necessity) {{is not subject to}} subsidiarity means that there is also no duty to retreat. The mere fact that a defender uses a weapon against unarmed attacker {{does not mean that the}} defense is disproportionate (and thus not legitimate) to the manner of the attack and the proportionality of defense does not depend on the relative effectiveness of the defender's weapon compared to the intensity of the attack, but on the manner in which the weapon is used (aiming at leg, i.e. intended non-deadly defense, may be proportionate where aiming at chest may be manifestly disproportionate, <b>notwithstanding</b> if the slug hits a leg artery and the attacker bleeds to death).|$|E
5|$|Anna Maria Luisa and Johann Wilhelm, <b>notwithstanding,</b> {{shared a}} {{harmonious}} marriage. The Electress spent her time enjoying balls, musical performances and other festivities. He commissioned a theatre for her where the comedies of French playwright Molière were performed. Because Anna Maria Luisa patronised many musicians, the contemporary Palatine court enjoyed regard {{as an international}} centre of music. She invited Fortunato Chelleri to court and appointed him maestro di cappella ("music teacher"). Agostino Steffani, a polymath, {{was sponsored by the}} Electress from his arrival in Düsseldorf, in 1703, until her return to Tuscany; the Conservatorio library in Florence houses two editions of his chamber duets.|$|E
5|$|Another problem {{encountered}} when {{applying the}} rational nexus test {{is that of}} over- and under-inclusiveness. Under-inclusiveness occurs when the legislative classification fails to embrace all persons within the ambit of the objective sought to be achieved by the law. On the other hand, over-inclusiveness occurs when the classification not only embraces persons within the ambit of the legislative objective, but also persons outside it. Both over- and under-inclusiveness are currently tolerated in Singapore under the rational nexus test, as a classification can still bear a rational relation to the legislative objective <b>notwithstanding</b> that it embraces more or less persons than its object requires.|$|E
