25|$|Kayaking – {{use of a}} kayak {{for moving}} across water. It is {{distinguished}} from canoeing by the sitting position of the paddler and the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>blades</b> on the paddle. A kayak is a boat where the paddler faces forward, legs in front, using a double-bladed paddle. Most kayaks have closed decks.|$|E

40|$|Fans {{are one of}} {{the types}} of turbo {{machinery}} which are used to move air continuously with slight increase in static pressure. Fans are widely used in industrial and commercial applications from shop ventilation to material handling, boiler applications, transporting gas or materials and most use in the HVAC industry today. In this paper it describes the different techniques which may help to increase the pressure of air. Flow in centrifugal impeller is simulated by Navier-stokes eq. and performance curved is obtained. The experimental data has been collected from Industry. Now the parameter considered is <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>blade,</b> inlet and outlet angle, diameter ratio Performance analysis has been carried out by experimental and ANSYS CFX software. It observed that <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>blade</b> increase, so that reduce in flow passage and more enlarged flow developed. Finally, the result of this total pressure and efficiency increase compared with original centrifugal fan...|$|R
25|$|The turbine and {{impeller}} wheel sizes also dictate {{the amount of}} air or exhaust that can flow through the system, and the relative efficiency at which they operate. In general, the larger the turbine wheel and compressor wheel the larger the flow capacity. Measurements and shapes can vary, as well as curvature and <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>blades</b> on the wheels.|$|E
25|$|Rotary vane {{compressors}} {{consist of}} a rotor with a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>blades</b> inserted in radial slots in the rotor. The rotor is mounted offset in a larger housing that is either circular or a more complex shape. As the rotor turns, blades slide {{in and out of}} the slots keeping contact with the outer wall of the housing. Thus, a series of increasing and decreasing volumes is created by the rotating blades. Rotary Vane compressors are, with piston compressors one of the oldest of compressor technologies.|$|E
25|$|Kayaks are {{generally}} differentiated from canoes by the sitting {{position of the}} paddler and the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>blades</b> on the paddle. In a kayak the paddler faces forward, legs in front, using a double bladed paddle. In a canoe the paddler faces forward and sits or kneels in the boat, using a single bladed paddle. In {{some parts of the}} world, such as the United Kingdom, kayaks are considered a subtype of canoe. Continental European and British canoeing clubs and associations of the 19th Century used craft similar to kayaks, but referred to them as canoes.|$|E
40|$|Dynamic {{properties}} <b>of</b> <b>blades</b> in {{the blade}} cascade excited by steam {{flow from the}} stationary bladed disk are investigated with the aim to explain origin and behaviour of running waves. It is shown {{that one of the}} most important reasons for existence of running waves is the running periodic forces from steam wakes due to different <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>blades</b> <b>of</b> stationary and rotating wheels. On a simplified computational model of disk with closed 10 -blades bundle are presented resulting velocities, theirs directions and modes of forced running waves. The effect of these forced running waves on the existence of flutter waves will be shortly mentioned as well...|$|R

A trustee of the temple described the protesters as [...] "fanatical extremists". Authorised Firearms Officers responded to the scene, arresting 55 men, and seizing [...] "a significant <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>bladed</b> weapons", {{all but one of}} which were kirpans, later determined to be ceremonial rather than functional.|$|R
30|$|The {{condition}} of the low axial velocity at the high rotational speed for the turbine with high blade number could be the blockade effect created by the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>blade</b> area interacted with fluid. For the turbines with lower blade number, the blockade effect is relatively less. This makes the lower bladed turbines possible to obtain a relatively higher attack angle at the high rotational speed {{than that of the}} high-bladed turbine.|$|R
25|$|By {{designing}} the fan blades with proper hub-to-tip ratio and analyzing {{performance on the}} <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>blades</b> so that the flow doesn't separate on the blade surface these effects can be reduced. Some of the methods to overcome these effects are re-circulation of excess air through the fan, axial fans are high specific speed devices operating them at high efficiency and to minimize the effects {{they have to be}} operated at low speeds. For controlling and directing the flow use of guide vanes is suggested. Turbulent flows at the inlet and outlet of the fans cause stalling so the flow should be made laminar by the introduction of a stator to prevent the effect.|$|E
25|$|An {{axial fan}} {{is a type}} of a {{compressor}} that increases the pressure of the air flowing through it. The blades of the axial flow fans force air to move parallel to the shaft about which the blades rotate. In other words, the flow is axially in and axially out, linearly, hence their name. The design priorities in an axial fan revolve around the design of the propeller that creates the pressure difference and hence the suction force that retains the flow across the fan. The main components that need to be studied in the designing of the propeller include the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>blades</b> and the design of each blade. Their applications include propellers in aircraft, helicopters, hovercraft, ships and hydrofoils. They are also used in wind tunnels and cooling towers. If the propeller is exercising propulsion, then efficiency is the only parameter of interest and other parameters like power required and flow rate are considered of no interest. In case the propeller is used as a fan, the parameters of interest includes power, flow rate, pressure rise and efficiency.|$|E

Various configurations of counterrotation for equal <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>blades</b> per disk have been tested along with single-rotation propellers, underscoring the fundamental acoustic differences between single and counterrotation propeller operation. In addition it is shown that, as the loading on the counterrotating system is increased, the overall sound-pressure level is also increased in both the disk plane and axial direction...|$|R

2500|$|In {{addition}} to general {{criticisms of the}} singularity concept, several critics have raised issues with Kurzweil's iconic chart. One line of criticism is that a log-log chart of this nature is inherently biased toward a straight-line result. Others identify selection bias in the points that Kurzweil chooses to use. For example, biologist PZ Myers points out {{that many of the}} early evolutionary [...] "events" [...] were picked arbitrarily. Kurzweil has rebutted this by charting evolutionary events from 15 neutral sources, and showing that they fit a straight line on [...] The Economist mocked the concept with a graph extrapolating that the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>blades</b> on a razor, which has increased over the years from one to as many as five, will increase ever-faster to infinity.|$|E
2500|$|The American windmill, or wind engine, {{was invented}} by Daniel Halladay in 1854 and was used mostly for lifting water from wells. Larger {{versions}} were also used for tasks such as sawing wood, chopping hay, and shelling and grinding grain. In early California and some other states, the windmill {{was part of a}} self-contained domestic water system which included a hand-dug well and a wooden water tower supporting a redwood tank enclosed by wooden siding known as a tankhouse. During the late 19th century steel blades and steel towers replaced wooden construction. [...] At their peak in 1930, an estimated 600,000 units were in use. Firms such as U.S. Wind Engine and Pump Company, Challenge Wind Mill and Feed Mill Company, Appleton Manufacturing Company, Star, Eclipse, Fairbanks-Morse, Dempster Mill Manufacturing Company and Aermotor became the main suppliers in North and South America. These windpumps are used extensively on farms and ranches in the United States, Canada, Southern Africa, and Australia. They feature a large <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>blades,</b> so they turn slowly with considerable torque in low winds and are self-regulating in high winds. [...] A tower-top gearbox and crankshaft convert the rotary motion into reciprocating strokes carried downward through a rod to the pump cylinder below. Such mills pumped water and powered feed mills, saw mills, and agricultural machinery.|$|E

This is most apparent in pictures taken in the dark with small bright spots, for example night cityscapes. Some cameras, such as the Olympus XA or lenses such as the MC Zenitar-ME1, however, use a two-bladed diaphragm with right-angle blades creating a square aperture.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the relationships among}} rotation speed of runner, setting angle <b>of</b> <b>blade,</b> chord length, <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>blade,</b> chord length, <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>blade,</b> and the necessary swimming velocity of fish which pass through the runner theoretically. With fish experiment, the swimming velocity of fish is examined by many video films. Comparing with the data of theoretical prediction and experiment, in non-load operation, both are consistent. But in load operation, the fish velocity of experiment is {{less than that of}} theoretical prediction. The main reason is that most of fishes which passed through the runner are touched by blade. Fishes spend the time to swim away from the blade after touching the blade. We also investigated the hit position of fish body. In the condition of rotation speed below 200 rpm, except the head and the upper half of the body, the damage and mortality of fish will not happen. But the actual swimming velocity becomes slower. The higher is the rotation speed and the less is the blades number, the faster is the fish swimming velocity. The fish goes through the runner with the best speed which they decide and they choose the easiest course in the passage and regulate the swimming velocity themselves. The results supply the data for the study of biology co-exist water turbine...|$|R

40|$|A laboratory-scale Tweedy-type {{mechanical}} dough development mixer {{was modified}} to monitor work inputs of dough during mixing through a computerised data acquisition system. Recorded torque showed a curve that increased to a peak about midway through mixing. Using this system, {{the effects of}} mixing speed and pressure {{on the development of}} doughs made from strong and weak flours mixed to a work input of 40 kJ kg− 1 were studied. Mixing was characterized in terms of peak torque and torque at the end of mixing (end torque), and in terms <b>of</b> the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>blade</b> revolutions at these two reference points. The peak torque and the end torque both increased with increasing mixing speed. The peak torque increased with increasing mixer headspace pressure, but the end torque did not. The <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>blade</b> revolutions to both the point of peak torque and to the end of mixing decreased with increasing mixing speed for both flours, implying dough development at higher speeds was more efficient. Increasing headspace pressure reduced the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> revolutions to the peak, but not to the end of mixing. These results provide evidence that achieving dough development is not independent of mixing speed in Tweedy-type mixers, and that dough aeration, as affected by mixer headspace pressure, affects dough rheology and hence development in the mixer.
