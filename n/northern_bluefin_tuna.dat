50|$|The Atlantic {{bluefin tuna}} (Thunnus thynnus) is {{a species of}} tuna in the family Scombridae. It is {{variously}} known as the <b>northern</b> <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> (mainly when including Pacific bluefin as a subspecies), giant bluefin tuna (for individuals exceeding 150 kg) and formerly as the tunny.|$|E
50|$|In {{the past}} {{it was often}} {{included}} in T. thynnus, the 'combined' species then known as the <b>northern</b> <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> (when treated as separate, T. thynnus is called the Atlantic bluefin tuna). It may reach as much as 3 m in length and 450 kg in weight.|$|E
40|$|The genus Thunnus of {{the family}} Scombridae {{includes}} three species of <b>bluefin</b> <b>tunas</b> (Atlantic <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> – T. thynnus, Pacific <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> - T. orientalis and southern <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> - T. maccoyii). The <b>bluefin</b> <b>tunas</b> were first recognized as two independent species (<b>Northern</b> and Southern <b>bluefin)</b> based on subtle differences in morphological characters. <b>Northern</b> <b>bluefin</b> <b>tunas</b> are now recognized as morphologically, geographically and genetically separate species located in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. The Pacific bluefin (T. orientalis) is the only species which remains unmanaged; this lack of management persists despite intensive fisheries {{on both sides of}} the Pacific. The current life history model indicates that these fish spawn in the western Pacific (Sea of Japan, Philippine Sea and East China Sea). Either late in the first year or early in the second year, a portion of the population migrates to the western coast of the United States and Mexico, a journey of over 8700 km (Bayliff et al., 1991). The young fish that have migrated into the eastern Pacific are thought to remain there for several years, feeding on sardines and anchovies in regions of intense upwelling (Bayliff et al., 1991, Bayliff, 1993). While these tuna are fished only seasonally off California and Mexico, they may be a year-round resident (Bayliff, 1991). The migrants then travel back to the western Pacific to spawn. Why some bluefin remain in the western Pacific while others migrate across the ocean basin is unresolved. How long they stay in the eastern Pacific, what habitats are most important, what triggers their return to the west is unclear...|$|R

5000|$|It is {{commonly}} known as the longtail tuna or <b>northern</b> <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna.</b> The usage of the latter name, mainly in Australia to distinguish it from the southern bluefin tuna, leads to easy confusion with Thunnus thynnus of the Atlantic and Thunnus orientalis of the North Pacific.

5000|$|By far {{the largest}} {{consumer}} of SBT is Japan, with USA coming in second, followed by China. Japanese imports of fresh bluefin tuna (all 3 species) worldwide increased from 957 tons in 1984 to 5,235 tons in 1993 7. The price peaked in 1990 at $34 per kilogram when a typical 350 pound fish sold for around $10,000. As of 2008, bluefin was selling for $23 a kilogram. The drop in value {{was due to the}} drop in the Japanese market, an increase in supply from <b>northern</b> <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> from the Mediterranean, and more and more tuna being stored (tuna frozen with the special [...] "flash" [...] method can be kept for up to a year with no perceivable change in taste).The Tsukiji Market in Tokyo is the largest wholesale market of SBT in the world. Tsukiji handles more than 2,400 tons of fish, worth about US$20 million, a day, with pre-dawn auctions of tuna being the main feature. No tourists are allowed to enter the tuna wholesale areas, which they say is for purposes of sanitation and disruption to the auction process. Higher prices are charged for the highest quality fish; bluefin tuna worth over $150,000 have been sold at Tsukiji. In 2001, a 202-kilogram wild Pacific bluefin tuna caught in Tsugaru Straight near Omanachi I Aomori Prefecture sold for $173,600, or about $800 a kilogram. In 2013, a 222-kilogram Pacific bluefin tuna was sold at Tsukiji for $1.8 million, or about $8,000 per kilogram.|$|E
40|$|The genetic {{population}} {{structures of}} Atlantic <b>northern</b> <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> (Thunnus thynnus thynnus) and albacore (T. alalunga) were examined using allozyme analysis. A total of 822 Atlantic <b>northern</b> <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> from 18 different samples (16 Mediterranean, 1 East Atlantic, 1 West Atlantic) and 188 albacore from 5 samples (4 Mediterranean, 1 East Atlantic) were surveyed for genetic variation in 37 loci. Polymorphism and heterozygosity reveal a moderate level of genetic variability, {{with only two}} highly polymorphic loci in both Atlantic <b>northern</b> <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> (FH* and SOD- 1 *) and albacore (GPI- 3 * and XDH*). The level of population differentiation found for Atlantic <b>northern</b> <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> and albacore fits the pattern that has generally been observed in tunas, with genetic differences on a broad rather than a more local scale. For Atlantic <b>northern</b> <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna,</b> no spatial or temporal genetic heterogeneity was observed within the Mediterranean Sea or between the East Atlantic and Mediterranean, indicating {{the existence of a}} single genetic grouping on {{the eastern side of the}} Atlantic Ocean. Very limited genetic differentiation was found between West Atlantic and East Atlantic/Mediterranean <b>northern</b> <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna,</b> mainly due to an inversion of SOD- 1 * allele frequencies.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the optimal {{management of the}} <b>Northern</b> Atlantic <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna,</b> both eastern and western stocks. The analysis {{is based on a}} deterministic multi-gear and age-structured bioeconomic model. In order to assess the importance of the gear structure in this fishery, the model is optimized in two scenarios. In the first, the strategies are restricted to the gear mix of the base year, whereas in the second, the optimal gear mix is estimated. For both scenarios, optimal constant strategies are determined. The corresponding optimal use is then compared with an open-access scenario. Also, optimal non-constant strategies are explored. As expected, the gear structure of the fishery proved to be highly relevant in the optimal payoffs. In particular, the unrestricted strategies yield rents substantially higher than the restricted ones. Also, the optimal management of the <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> fishery, in both the East and West Atlantic, would imply significant reallocation of the gear shares.

In doing so it has become clear that much more research needs to be undertaken on the physiology of the species (southern, <b>northern</b> and Pacific <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna)</b> currently used in aquaculture in order for the pathogenesis of some conditions to be properly understood.

50|$|Initially, {{difficulties}} in closing {{the life cycle}} of the species dissuaded most from farming them. However, in 2007, using hormonal therapy developed in Europe and Japan (where they had already succeeded in breeding <b>northern</b> Pacific <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> to third generation) to mimic the natural production of hormones by wild fish, researchers in Australia managed {{for the first time to}} trigger spawning in landlocked tanks. This was done by the Australian aquaculture company, Clean Seas Tuna Limited. who collected its first batch of fertilized eggs from a breeding stock of about 20 tuna weighing 160 kg. They were also the first company in the world to successfully transfer large SBT over large distances to its onshore facilities in Arno Bay which is where the spawning has taken place. This led Time magazine to award it second place in the 'World's Best Invention' of 2009.|$|R
40|$|The <b>northern</b> <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> (Thunnus thynnus) is {{a highly}} mobile apex {{predator}} in the Gulf of Maine. Despite current stock assessments that indicate historically high abundance of its main prey, Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus), commercial fishermen have observed declines in the somatic condition of <b>northern</b> <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> during the last decade. We examined this claim by reviewing detailed logbooks of <b>northern</b> <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> condition from a local fishermen’s cooperative and applying multinomial regression, a robust tool for exploring how a categorical variable {{may be related to}} other variables of interest. The data set contained > 3082 observations of condition (fat and oil content and fish shape) from fish landed between 1991 and 2004. Energy from stored lipids is used for migration and reproduction; therefore a reduction in energy acquisition on bluefin tuna feeding grounds could diminish allocations to growth and gamete production and have detrimental consequences for rebuilding the western Atlantic population. A decline in <b>northern</b> <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> somatic condition could indicate substantial changes in the bottom-up transfer of energy in the Gulf of Maine, shifts in their reproductive or migratory patterns, impacts of fishing pressure, or synergistic effects from multiple causes...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, {{there has}} been {{considerable}} debate about whether the Atlantic <b>northern</b> <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> (Thunnus thynnus) exist as a panmictic unit. This question is addressed by examining both mitochondrial DNA control region nucleotide sequences and nuclear gene ldhA allele frequencies in replicate samples of <b>northern</b> <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> from the Mediterranean Sea and the northwestern Atlantic Ocean.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to study the {{implications}} of introducing a stochastic stock in a multi-gear and age structured bio-economic model for the <b>Northern</b> Atlantic <b>Bluefin</b> <b>tuna.</b> In order to account for variations on the recruitment, uncertainty is introduced on a bilinear recruitment function, and it is represented by an exponential random error term leading the stock to be, on average, higher than in the deterministic case. Both the bionomic equilibrium and the optimal management of this species are examined. In the latter, two alternative instruments are studied: the constant total allowable catch and the constant effort and the purpose is to maximize the expected total net present value. The conclusions enhance that the results do not differ significantly from those in the deterministic model, that is, the fishing effort should be the policy instrument to adopt, both in the East and the West Atlantic. Despite the previous reasoning, the shock on recruitment should be taken into account, as certain realizations of the random variable may lead to different results. In particular, for low <b>Bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> stock levels, it is optimal to regulate the caches instead of the fishing effort, to ensure the stock recovery...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} the new member problem {{faced by the}} {{regional}} fisheries management organisations is discussed for a typical highly migratory species: the <b>northern</b> Atlantic <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna.</b> The analysis is based on simulation and optimisation results from a bio-economic model. The results, for both the East and the West Atlantic stocks, show that presently {{the threat of the}} new members is not relevant for the breakdown of the cooperative management. This is due to the very low level of the stock, which makes non-cooperation a low payoff strategy. As the optimal cooperative strategy calls for an initial harvest moratorium the threat becomes progressively more relevant, showing that this is a dynamic problem which is aggravated in the long run. Two possible solutions for this problem are simulated: “transferable membership ” and “waiting period”. The simulation results show that a “transferable membership ” scheme, if properly implemented, is fully efficient in protecting the cooperative agreements of the regional fisheries organisations from the free rider actions of the prospective new members. The “waiting period”, although protecting the member countries generally does not preclude such behaviours...|$|R
40|$|The International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) is a {{regional}} fisheries management organization (RFMO) comprised of over fifty cooperating states and fishing entities. It manages <b>Northern</b> Atlantic <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> (Thunnus thynnus) in the Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea. Due to overfishing and ineffective management, the stock abundance {{of this species}} has declined to about thirty percent of its unfished biomass in the Atlantic Ocean and Mediterranean Sea. Many publications point to this poor stock status as evidence of failed fisheries management. To maintain <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> stocks {{at a level that}} can support maximum sustainable yield (MSY), ICCAT has implemented unique tools to manage this important fishery, {{which is one of the}} oldest-recorded in the world. ^ In this thesis research, I examine the factors that contribute to the tools utilized to manage the fishery in the ICCAT Convention Area to shed light on why they are managed differently than other ICCAT stocks. To do this, I conducted a literature review on publicly available ICCAT reports, governmental and non-governmental documents, peer reviewed scientific literature, and other sources to understand and explain the relevant importance of each contributing factor to the management of the species. I utilized key informant interview methodology to obtain insights from twelve <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> experts representing a variety of interests that attend ICCAT official meetings. I transcribed and collected insights from semi-structured interviews, which I used to ground-truth the findings of the literature review. ^ No single factor is responsible for the unique management in place to govern ICCAT 2 ̆ 7 s <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> fishery. Rather, a nuanced interaction of many important factors contributes to the species 2 ̆ 7 poor stock status and unique management. The history and complex nature of the fishery, unique biology of the species, strong demand in the world sushi market, impact of Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated (IUU) fishing, and political will of ICCAT member countries to enforce Recommendations and Resolutions influence which measures are adopted and implemented. This finding contrasts peer reviewed literature and other information to the contrary that attribute the unique management and poor stock status of <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> to such factors as high market value of the species 2 ̆ 7 meat, ineffective ICCAT management, Hardin 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 2 Tragedy of the Commons, 2 ̆ 2 or the 2 ̆ 2 free riding 2 ̆ 2 of non-cooperating fishing entities fully. ^ Based on key informant interviews, expert respondents share a high level of agreement that the special, 2 ̆ 2 iconic 2 ̆ 2 status that <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> have attained in popular media, scientific publications, and in general public opinion are important factors that contribute to their management. Further, experts mostly agree that more scientific research on the biology and life history of the species needs to be conducted to inform more effective and appropriate management such as updating the current two-stock management framework. Experts recommend that ICCAT prioritize setting Total Allowable Catch (TAC) Recommendations based on the advice of their Standing Committee on Research and Statistics (SCRS) to sustain healthy stocks.

40|$|Although <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> {{are found}} {{throughout}} the Atlantic Ocean, spawning in the western Atlantic has been recorded predominantly in the Gulf of Mexico (GOM) in spring. Larval <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> abundances from the northern GOM are formulated into an index used to tune the adult stock assessment, and the variability of this index is currently high. This study investigated whether some of the variability in larval <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> abundances was related to environmental conditions, by defining associations between larval <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> catch locations, and a suite of environmental variables. We hypothesized that certain habitat types, as defined by environmental variables, {{would be more likely}} to contain <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> larvae. Favorable habitat for <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> larvae was defined using a classification tree approach.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The use of DNA {{barcodes}} for {{the identification}} of described species {{is one of the}} least controversial and most promising applications of barcoding. There is no consensus, however, as to what constitutes an appropriate identification standard and most barcoding efforts simply attempt to pair a query sequence with reference sequences and deem identification successful if it falls within the bounds of some pre-established cutoffs using genetic distance. Since the Renaissance, however, most biological classification schemes have relied on the use of diagnostic characters to identify and place species. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we developed a cytochrome c oxidase subunit I character-based key for {{the identification of}} all tuna species of the genus Thunnus, and compared its performance with distance-based measures for identification of 68 samples of tuna sushi purchased from 31 restaurants in Manhattan (New York City) and Denver, Colorado. Both the character-based key and GenBank BLAST successfully identified 100 % of the tuna samples, while the Barcode of Life Database (BOLD) as well as genetic distance thresholds, and neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree building performed poorly in terms of species identification. A piece of tuna sushi {{has the potential to be}} an endangered species, a fraud, or a health hazard. All three of these cases were uncovered in this study. Nineteen restaurant establishments were unable to clarify or misrepresented what species they sold. Five out of nine samples sold as a variant of "white tuna" were not albacore (T. alalunga), but escolar (Lepidocybium flavorunneum), a gempylid species banned for sale in Italy and Japan due to health concerns. Nineteen samples were <b>northern</b> <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> (T. thynnus) or the critically endangered southern bluefin tuna (T. maccoyii), though nine restaurants that sold these species did not state these species on their menus.

40|$|ENGLISH: The {{spawning}} of Pacific <b>northern</b> <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna,</b> Thunnus thynnus, {{takes place}} {{only in the}} western Pacific Ocean (WPO), but substantial numbers of the juveniles migrate to the eastern Pacific Ocean (EPO), where they remain for several months, or longer, and the. n return to the WPO. Lengthfrequency and tagging data show that many bluefin arrive in the EPO as 1 -and 2 -year olds, and remain there {{for one or two}} fishing seasons before returning to the WPO. The proportion of the fish which make the west-to-east migration varies among years. The numbers of 1 -, 2 -, 3 -, 4, and > 4 –year olds in the catches of the EPO are estimated for most years of the 1952 - 1991 period.

40|$|Data {{recovered}} from 11 popup satellite archival tags and 3 surgically implanted archival tags {{were used to}} analyze the movement patterns of juvenile <b>northern</b> <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> (Thunnus thynnus orientalis) in the eastern Pacific. The light sensors on archival and pop-up satellite transmitting archival tags (PSATs) provide data on the time of sunrise and sunset, allowing the calculation of an approximate geographic position of the animal. Light-based estimates of longitude are relatively robust but latitude estimates are prone to large degrees of error, particularly near the times of the equinoxes and when the tag is at low latitudes. Estimating latitude remains a problem for researchers using light-based geolocation algorithms and {{it has been suggested that}} sea surface temperature data from satellites may be a useful tool for refining latitude estimates. Tag data from bluefin tuna were subjected to a newly developed algorithm, called “PSAT Tracker,” which automatically matches sea surface temperature data from the tags with sea surface temperatures recorded by satellites. The results of this algorithm compared favorably to the estimates of latitude calculated with the lightbased algorithms and allowed for estimation of fish positions during times of the year when the lightbased algorithms failed. Three near one-year tracks produced by PSAT tracker showed that the fish range from the California−Oregon border to southern Baja California, Mexico, and that the majority of time is spent off the coast of central Baja Mexico. A seasonal movement pattern was evident; the fish spend winter and spring off central Baja California, and summer through fall is spent moving northward to Oregon and returning to Baja California...|$|E
40|$|The stomach {{contents}} of 68 Atlantic <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> (Thunnus thynnus) landed in Port Hood and Canso, Nova Scotia, in 2010, were analyzed {{to characterize the}} diet of <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> at the two locations. Of the sampled fish, 54 stomachs had contents. Pelagic schooling fish such as herring (Clupea harengus) and mackerel (Scomber scombrus) dominated the diets in both regions. However, a number of rare species, including demersal species, were also observed. Despite the difference in location and the significantly larger size of the Atlantic <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> landed in Port Hood, the diets of the Atlantic <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> landed at both sites were similar...|$|R

The Pacific <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> is targeted by the fishing industry mainly for its use in sushi. [...] A stock assessment released in 2013 by the International Scientific Committee for Tuna and Tuna-Like Species in the North Pacific Ocean (ISC) shows that the Pacific <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> population dropped by 96 percent in the Pacific Ocean. According to the ISC assessment, 90 percent of the Pacific <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> caught are juveniles that have not reproduced.|$|R
40|$|Abstract This article {{assesses the}} {{economic}} feasibility of capture-based <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> aquaculture on the US East Coast and examines {{the potential of}} this hybrid form of aquaculture production to increase the net economic value generated in the US East Coast <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> fishery. A bioeconomic model of an offshore capture-based <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> aquaculture facility is {{used to evaluate the}} economic feasibility of this form of production on the US East Coast under a variety of economic, biological, and regulatory assumptions. The results suggest that of the three proposed farming sites along the US East Coast, the expected net present value (NPV) of the operation over a 10 -year operating horizon is highest at the Gray’s Reef, GA, site. The second part of this article assesses {{the extent to which the}} opportunity to engage in capture-based <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> aquaculture production could improve the net economic value gener-ated in the US East Coast <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> fishery. The results suggest that if the fishery had the opportunity to engage in capture-based <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> aquaculture production, there would be an increase in the net revenue generated in the fishery. Depending on how the seasonal quota was enforced, economic improvement in the fishery ranged from a 52 – 142 % improvement in net revenue. Even when the cost per fish associated with capture-based <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> aquaculture production was doubled, the results still indicated that the opportunity to engage in capture-based <b>bluefin</b> <b>tuna</b> aquaculture production would lead to a 12 % increase in net revenue in the fishery.
