40|$|Purpose of {{the present}} {{investigation}} was to evaluate six terpene-containing essential oils for their capacity to promote permeation of estradiol (ES) through hairless mouse skin in vitro. Tests on cajuput, cardamom, melissa. myrtle, niaouli and orange oil, all used at the 10 % w/w concentration in propylene glycol (PG), evidenced <b>niaouli</b> <b>oil</b> (NIA) as the best permeation promoter for ES. Tests on the main terpene components of NIA (1. 8 cineole, alpha-pinene, alpha-terpineol and D-limonene). evaluated neat (10 % w/w in PG) or in admixture. confirmed the better promoting activity of whole NIA. The present data point to the validity of complex terpene Mixtures. Such as that composing NIA, as transdermal penetration enhancers for moderately lipophilic drugs like ES...|$|E
40|$|Melaleuca quinquenervia is a {{small to}} medium sized tree (8 - 12 m) that is native to the coastal region of eastern Australia, {{southern}} Papua New Guinea and New Caledonia between latitudes 8 and 340 S. It has been planted as an exotic in the tropical lowlands of several countries {{and has become a}} serious weed in Florida, USA. The leaves are a source of the cineole-rich essential oil called <b>niaouli</b> <b>oil</b> or goman oil used in pharmaceutical preparations. It is often grown as a windbreak and as an ornamental. A strong flavoured honey is produced from the abundant flowers. The wood is an excellent fuel and makes good quality charcoal. It is suitable for pit props, fence posts, flooring and pulp. The paper-like bark may be used as mulch in potting mixes, for packaging and insulation. The paper describes the botanical features, aspects of its growth and development, its ecology, pests and diseases, harvesting and genetic resources. It concludes that the best prospects for the use of Melaleuca quinquenervia are on swampy sites, as more productive species are already available for better-drained habitats. It has a demonstrated ability to grow quite rapidly in areas of the humid and subhumid tropics that may be inundated for many months. Further research on this species and its close relatives is advocated and this should proceed with care in view of its potential to become a serious weed...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{studies in}} vitro had {{identified}} <b>niaouli</b> essential <b>oil</b> (NEO) {{as a valuable}} transdermal permeation promoter for estradiol (ES). Subsequent considerations on the complex issue of NEO provenance and composition stimulated the present investigation, which was aimed at defining the composition of NEOs obtained from four different sources, at evaluating their influence on transdermal permeation of ES through hairless mouse skin, and at formulating and evaluating simpler terpene mixtures mimicking the NEOs' composition. While all oils contained 1, 8 -cineol (eucalyptol) as the main component, appreciable variations in composition could be evidenced, originating differences on the ES cutaneous permeation. Two artificial mixtures containing the same proportions of the main terpenes present in each oil (except the commercially unavailable y-terpineol) proved equal or significantly superior in activity {{when compared with the}} original oils. It is felt that this study might contribute to the formulation of terpene mixtures acting more efficiently and reproducibly with respect to natural NEOs, whose complex and variable composition, depending on growing place, season, and extraction process, is well documented in the relevant literature...|$|R
40|$|In {{continuation}} of a previous study dealing with the promoting effect of <b>niaouli</b> essential <b>oil</b> (NIA) on transdermal permeation of estrogens, the effect of vehicle composition on permeation of estradiol (ES) ex vivo across hairless mouse skin was investigated using a diffusion cell technique. Three types of gel vehicles possessing suitable esthetic and spreading characteristics, formulated with Carbopol 1342 and containing NIA at two concentrations (1. 0 and 10. 0 %) were tested. Promoter-free vehicles and two commercial alcohol-based gels (Gelestra and Sandrena) were used as reference. The solubility of ES in the solvent phase of the gels and the rheological properties of all formulations were also evaluated. The mean transdermal fluxes of ES at steady state from Gelestra and Sandrena were not significantly different, although Gelestra showed a shorter lag time and a greater amount of ES permeated after 30 It compared with Sandrena. In the gels under test, the presence of 1. 0 % NIA significantly increased the ES transdermalflux over the reference vehicles only when in association with ethanol and water. The present results may warrant further investigations on other drugs and skin models, aimed at optimizing the promoting activity of NIA, and the synergistic effect of solvents...|$|R
40|$|In a {{previous}} study, <b>niaouli</b> essential <b>oil</b> (NIA) {{was found to}} enhance the permeation of estradiol (ES) through hairless mouse skill in vitro. In this study we evaluated in vivo, on female hairless rats, the trandermal penetration of ES from alcoholic get-vehicles containing 1. 0 or 5. 0 % NIA (Gel 2 and 3, respectively). One NIA-free gel (Get 1) and a commercial formulation, Sandrena gel, were used as reference. The ES serum levels after single or multiple cutaneous application of the gel-vehicles were determined, and the in vivo data were compared with new in vitro data obtained using hairless mouse skin. Both the in vitro and the single-dosing in vivo tests demonstrated the superiority of Gel 2 over all other gels. When tested in the multiple-dosing study against Sandrena gel, Gel 2 produced a 0 - 96 h plasma AUC two times {{greater than that of}} the reference. The absolute bioavailability values of ES from the vehicles under investigation were also in the order Gel 2 > Gel 3 > Sandrella gel > Gel 1. This study indicates that, in the presently investigated animal species, a relatively small percentage of NIA (1. 0 %) in association with ethanol (57. 8 %) promotes transdermal penetration of ES {{to a greater extent than}} ethanol (65 %) in association with propylene glycol (10. 5 %), the enhancers present in the commercial gel Sandrena...|$|R
