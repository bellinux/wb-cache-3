5|$|Over the centuries, {{the tree}} grows thicker and taller as {{successive}} rings develop around its trunk and new buds grow on the branches. The tree {{becomes part of}} an old growth forest with a shaded and damp understory of broadleaf trees, shrubs, and ferns. In the canopy, a mat of dead <b>needles</b> and lichen accumulate on the wide upper branches. Exposed to light, air, and rain, the <b>needles</b> decompose and the mat becomes colonized by insects, fungus, and new plants.|$|E
5|$|The {{diagnosis}} is usually made on electromyography (EMG), {{which is one}} of the standard tests in the investigation of otherwise unexplained muscle weakness.

5|$|The first {{reaction}} of the host tree is traced to the adult wasp and occurs after 10 to 14 days. A phytotoxic secretion of the wasp impairs metabolism in the shoots and <b>needles,</b> causing loss of water balance. The result is brown coloration of the <b>needles</b> and leaf drop. As with many other wood pests, fine resin drops in wasp boreholes {{are found in the}} central trunk. Attacked pines tend to develop flagging. Tip dieback begins with the <b>needles</b> becoming chlorotic and changing from green to yellowish-red, finally turning completely brown over a three- to six-month period. The wasp bores 1/8- to 3/8-inch-diameter holes in the tree. Unstressed trees may be attacked uniformly along the main stem, while trees with low osmotic phloem pressure are preferentially attacked, with denser clusters of boreholes.|$|E
5|$|The {{piercing}} needle: The {{standard method}} in the United States involves making an opening using a beveled-tip hollow medical needle, {{which is available}} in different lengths, gauges and even shapes. While straight <b>needles</b> are useful for many body parts, curved <b>needles</b> are manufactured for areas where straight <b>needles</b> are not ideal. The needle selected is typically the same gauge (or sometimes larger as with cartilage piercings) as the initial jewellery to be worn, with higher gauges indicating thinner <b>needles.</b> The needle is inserted into the body part being pierced, frequently by hand but sometimes {{with the aid of}} a needle holder or pusher. While the needle is still in the body, the initial jewellery to be worn in the piercing is pushed through the opening, following the back of the needle. Jewellery is often inserted into the hollow end of a needle, so that as the needle pulls through the jewellery is left behind.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} investigates <b>needle</b> insertion through soft tissue, {{enabling the}} development and validation of force models and insertion techniques for accurate <b>needle</b> tip placement. During <b>needle</b> insertion into the prostate, the <b>needle</b> deflects {{en route to the}} target which leads to seed misplacement and suboptimal dose to cancerous cells. Many researchers have studied slow <b>needle</b> insertion speed and axial - <b>needle</b> insertion direction - force distribution and components. However, little work has been performed on stiffer <b>needle</b> material properties, tissue deformation with <b>needle</b> deflection, and normal - perpendicular to <b>needle</b> insertion direction - force distribution. This lack of knowledge have led to tissue deformation, <b>needle</b> deflection, and misplaced target when performing <b>needle</b> insertion procedures. 	This research aims to quantify the impact of an optimized <b>needle</b> grid, insertion techniques, and needle-tissue force interaction leading to <b>needle</b> deflection and phantom deformation. First, an improved grid used to guide the <b>needle</b> was investigated and inserted via different hand insertion techniques to acquire <b>needle</b> deflection. To measure <b>needle</b> deflection, a measurement apparatus with acceptable gauge repeatability and reproducibility (GR&R) and documented accuracy was introduced. Next, stiffer <b>needle</b> properties were explored and inserted at much faster speed via a high-speed device, when compared to hand insertion or current robotic devices. Finally, finite element analysis (FEA) models were developed to predict relative needle-phantom motion using measured force data, while simultaneously obtaining experimental <b>needle</b> deflection and phantom deformation. The <b>needle</b> and phantom FEA models and the normal force distribution on the <b>needle</b> shaft were validated with separate experimental results. Findings from this dissertation include a 40 % decrease in average <b>needle</b> deflection with the improved grid (and the same fast hand insertion technique), in addition to a 60 % decrease in average <b>needle</b> deflection with the stiffer <b>needle</b> at the faster speed (compared to the less stiff <b>needle</b> and slow speed). Also, the <b>needle</b> and phantom FEA models are reasonably accurate to the experimental data, having a difference of 7 % and 18 %, respectively. These findings can be used to improve <b>needle</b> insertion techniques, while understanding force distribution effect on <b>needle</b> bending and compensate during the insertion path...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In {{this paper}} we propose an {{automated}} method to reconstruct the 3 D <b>needle</b> shape during <b>needle</b> insertion procedures using only 2 D transverse ultrasound (US) images. Using a set of transverse US images, image processing and random sample consensus (RANSAC) is used to locate the <b>needle</b> within each image and estimate the <b>needle</b> shape. The method is validated with an in-vitro <b>needle</b> insertion setup and a transparent tissue phantom, where two orthogonal cameras are used to capture the true 3 D <b>needle</b> shape for verification. Results showed {{that the use of}} at least 3 images obtained at 75 % of the maximum insertion depth or greater allows for maximum <b>needle</b> shape estimation errors of less than 2 mm. In addition, the <b>needle</b> shape can be calculated consistently as long as the <b>needle</b> can be identified in 30 % of the transverse US images obtained.

30|$|When {{a biopsy}} <b>needle</b> is {{misplaced}} {{in the normal}} lung parenchyma distinct from the target, the operator usually removes the <b>needle</b> and re-attempts targeting. However, in select patients, instead of removing a malpositioned <b>needle,</b> we re-attempted lesion targeting using a second <b>needle</b> through another puncture site while the first <b>needle</b> was in position. The malpositioned <b>needle</b> retained in lung parenchyma was beneficial in performing the second attempt. First, when the patient did not reproduce designated respiration and re-targeting could not depend on CT images, the operator determined the lesion location based on {{the location of the}} malpositioned <b>needle.</b> Although the patient’s respiration was irregular, the relative position between the lesion and inserted <b>needle</b> did not change; thus, the operator calculated the distance of the lesion relative to the malpositioned <b>needle</b> and determined a new puncture site and <b>needle</b> direction. Second, the malpositioned <b>needle</b> acted as an anchor to hold the lung. In a patient with pre-existing pneumothorax, the first <b>needle</b> failed to target the lesion because of the movability of the lung. In the second trial using another <b>needle,</b> the malpositioned <b>needle</b> held the lung in place, which was helpful for accurate lesion targeting by the second <b>needle.</b> When the patient’s respiratory movement was large and variable, the inserted <b>needle</b> restricted the patient’s respiratory motion to a limited range, enabling the operator to estimate the lesion location. Furthermore, the operator could control the patient’s respiratory movement by observing the <b>needle</b> movement. Because pneumothorax did not occur or progress while the malpositioned <b>needle</b> was ‘holding’ the lung, the operator could proceed with another biopsy attempt.|$|R

40|$|Introduction. In {{traditional}} Chinese acupuncture, <b>needle</b> sensation (deqi) is {{purported to}} contribute to a therapeutic outcome. While researchers have attempted to define deqi qualitatively, few have examined the effects of <b>needling</b> parameters on its intensity. Methods. 24 healthy subjects completed eight interventions scheduled at least one week apart, which involved manual acupuncture to LI 4 or a designated nonacupoint (NAP) on the hand, with real or simulated manipulation each three minutes and <b>needle</b> retentions of one or 21 minutes. Intensities of <b>needling</b> sensation and pain were reported every three minutes and sensation qualities were reported post-intervention. Results. Immediately after <b>needle</b> insertion, similar levels of mean <b>needle</b> sensation and of pain were reported independent of intervention. At subsequent measurement times, only two interventions (one at LI 4 and one at NAP) maintained statistically significantly elevated <b>needle</b> sensation and pain scores and reported higher numbers of <b>needle</b> sensation descriptors. For both, the <b>needle</b> was retained for 21 minutes and manipulated every three minutes. Neither intervention differed significantly in terms of levels of pain, and <b>needle</b> sensation or numbers and qualities of <b>needle</b> sensation described. Conclusion. In this group of healthy subjects, the initial <b>needling</b> for all eight interventions elicited similar levels of <b>needle</b> sensation and pain. These levels were only maintained if there was ongoing of <b>needle</b> manipulation and retention of the <b>needle.</b> By contrast, the strength of <b>needle</b> sensation or pain experienced was independent of insertion site...|$|R

40|$|Background—Image-guided robots are {{manipulators}} {{that operate}} based on medical images. Perhaps the most common class of image-guided robots are robots for <b>needle</b> interventions. Typically, these robots actively position and/or orient a <b>needle</b> guide, but <b>needle</b> insertion is still done by the physician. While this arrangement may have safety advantages and keep the physician in control of <b>needle</b> insertion, actuated <b>needle</b> drivers can incorporate other useful features. Methods—We first present a new <b>needle</b> driver that can actively insert and rotate a <b>needle.</b> With this device we investigate the use of <b>needle</b> rotation in controlled in-vitro experiments performed with a specially developed revolving <b>needle</b> driver. Results—These experiments show that <b>needle</b> rotation can improve targeting and may reduce errors {{by as much as}} 70 %. Conclusion—The new <b>needle</b> driver provides a unique kinematic architecture that enables insertion with a compact mechanism. Perhaps the most interesting conclusion of the study is that lesions of soft tissue organs may not be perfectly targeted with a <b>needle</b> without using special techniques, either manually or with a robotic device. The results of this study show that <b>needle</b> rotation may be an effective method of reducing targeting errors...|$|R
