40|$|The {{present study}} {{concerns}} certain phenomena {{that take place}} in the <b>needle</b> roller <b>bearing.</b> The friction that generates the anti-torque of a friction pair is the major factor that influences the <b>needle</b> <b>bearing’s</b> wear. In the <b>needle</b> <b>bearing</b> there occur two predominant types of friction: the rolling friction and the sliding friction, and both are subject to examination. The study presents recordings and analysis of the movements of all <b>needle</b> <b>bearing’s</b> rolling elements. The examination was carried out on a special examination stand that precisely emulates the real conditions of the <b>needle</b> <b>bearing’s</b> work. Carefully prepared examination methods enable recording and analyzing frictions in the bearing, estimating a sphere within which the load is shifted, and calculating the coefficient of friction...|$|R

50|$|A cam follower, {{also known}} as a track follower, is a {{specialized}} type of roller or <b>needle</b> <b>bearing</b> designed to follow cam lobe profiles. Cam followers come in a vast array of different configurations, however the most defining characteristic is how the cam follower mounts to its mating part; stud style cam followers use a stud while the yoke style has a hole through the middle.|$|R
50|$|It is {{also used}} as bearing in {{applications}} where electrical conduction is necessary. It is used in when high frequency current degrades ball or <b>needle</b> <b>bearings.</b> Examples of applications include packaging machines, radar joints, and welding equipment.|$|E
50|$|Compared to ball {{bearings}} and ordinary roller bearings, <b>needle</b> <b>bearings</b> {{have a greater}} surface area {{in contact with the}} races, so they can support a greater load. They are also thinner, so they require less clearance between the axle and the surrounding structure.|$|E
50|$|In {{the second}} stage, the {{bearings}} of Structures 1 through 5 were repaired. The heavily polluted roller bearings were completely replaced. The <b>needle</b> <b>bearings</b> (compact roller bearings) were opened and cleaned and the abrasive contact surfaces were reground. The bearings were then greased and closed again.|$|E

The air-intake is next to the engine intake manifold. The crankcase is not divided, the crankshaft is forged and has two ball bearings. The pushrod is housed in a <b>needle</b> <b>bearing,</b> the piston journal has a plain bearing pressed into the push rod bore. The piston has two piston rings and one oil control ring. Lubrication is done by a dry sump lubrication system, the compressor valves are poppet valves.|$|R
50|$|The {{person charged}} with {{drumming}} up new business during the Depression {{was a research}} engineer named Edmund K. Brown. He developed {{a new type of}} bearing for the company—a needle bearing—that eventually predicated the bulk of Torrington's business. On the heels of Brown's discovery came an important acquisition in 1935, when Torrington acquired the Bantam Ball Bearing Company. Brown's <b>needle</b> <b>bearing</b> and the addition of Bantam Ball Bearing signalled {{the beginning of a new}} era for Torrington, a future in which the production of bearings would fuel the company's growth and lift Torrington into the upper echelon of U.S. manufacturers.|$|R
50|$|The first Styluses used a {{modified}} Fury chassis, afterwards a purpose built chassis {{was made to}} accommodate the lowered doors. The front rocker arms were upgraded with <b>needle</b> <b>bearings</b> and the front lower arms got redesigned to prevent the lower ball joints being damaged. As with most Sylva models, various engines can be fitted.|$|E
5000|$|A {{needle roller}} bearing is a special type of roller bearing which uses long, thin {{cylindrical}} rollers resembling needles. Ordinary roller bearings' rollers are only slightly longer than their diameter, but <b>needle</b> <b>bearings</b> typically have rollers that are {{at least four times}} longer than their diameter. [...] Like all bearings, they are used to reduce the friction of a rotating surface.|$|E
5000|$|Vigier Floyd Rose {{created by}} Vigier guitars at the {{beginning}} of the 90s, this system uses force-tolerant <b>needle</b> <b>bearings</b> for improved wear on the bridge and enhanced tuning stability.

40|$|Evidences {{suggest that}} the engine failure was {{progressive}} in nature. Examination revealed constant rubbing of the <b>needle</b> <b>bearing</b> cage with the rotor sleeve inner surface. Analysis shows that this was possible due to undersize of the bearing seating area on the eccentric shaft. The rubbing of the cage resulted in removal of the material from the rotor sleeve and thereby, making space for lateral movement of the shaft. The lateral movement of the shaft and the resultant induced vibration {{were responsible for the}} various damages seen on the engine components. A detailed analysis of the failure is presented in this report with a few recommendations for preventing recurrence of similar failures...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The article {{analyses}} {{the process}} of friction in the <b>needle</b> <b>bearing</b> as {{the function of the}} alterations of geometrical parameters, namely the diameter of the shaft – D, the needle – d and the bearing clearance. The change in the relation between the diameters D and d results in the change of the contact area of the friction pair; in the case of two shafts with parallel axes (the <b>needle</b> of the <b>bearing</b> and the shaft pin) the contact area, if compared with the analogical process in the ball bearing, alters significantly and leads to resistance in motion. There are two types of friction in the needle bearing: the rolling friction and the sliding friction; the analysis of the movement of the bearing elements enabled the estimation {{of the extent to which}} the sliding friction matters in the overall balance of motion resistance. The article also defines the type of wear as the function of initial clearance...|$|R

5000|$|Cannondale {{has also}} {{developed}} a suspension fork called the Lefty. It started with the [...] "Headshok" [...] (a.k.a. [...] "Fatty") forks. It uses 88 <b>needle</b> <b>bearings</b> to reduce friction for smooth travel with the bearings telescoping inside the steerer tube of the fork. This minimizes flexing of the fork legs and also reduces static friction, which must be overcome before the fork begins to travel.|$|E
50|$|The 1991 Supersports were {{produced}} with white chrome molybdenum steel frames and white wheels. The swingarms used <b>needle</b> <b>bearings</b> instead of bushings {{as in the}} past. Brakes from the Ducati 851 were used on the Supersport vastly improving braking performance. All new bodywork and a pivoting fuel tank were elegantly shaped. The revised Supersports were met with immediate success and became wildly popular. Even though the 1991 Supersport was extremely well developed, Ducati would continue to refine the bike over the years.|$|E
50|$|This {{new chapter}} {{in the history of}} Torrington began with a decided {{flourish}} during World War II when the company once again manufactured surgical needles to supply the nation's war-time needs. In contrast to World War I, however, Torrington invested considerable effort toward manufacturing its new line of products—bearings. <b>Needle</b> <b>bearings</b> were supplied to the government for a variety of purposes, especially for uses in military aircraft and in B-29 bombers in particular, giving the company's bearing business sufficient momentum to emerge during the postwar era as the driving force propelling the company's growth.|$|E
50|$|The {{pantograph}} was, {{in keeping}} with most pantographs at the time, spring operated with an elementary head suspension.
