5|$|On December 8, 1980, Mark David Chapman {{shocked the}} world by murdering 40-year-old {{musician}} and activist, John Lennon, outside The Dakota, his <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>apartment</b> building. Chapman's motives were fabricated from pure delusion, fueled by an obsession with the fictional character Holden Caulfield and his similar misadventures in J.D. Salinger's The Catcher in the Rye. In one instant, an anonymous, socially awkward and mentally unstable 25-year-old fan of The Beatles, who had fluctuated between idealizing Lennon and being overcome {{with a desire to}} kill him, altered the course of the history of music.|$|E
5|$|Six-year-old Maisie (Onata Aprile) {{lives in}} a <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>apartment</b> with her parents, Susanna (Julianne Moore), a singer in a rock band, and Beale (Steve Coogan), an {{international}} art dealer. Susanna and Beale argue with each other viciously and constantly, often ignoring Maisie and leaving her {{in the care of}} their nanny, Margo (Joanna Vanderham). Maisie does not always understand her parents' actions, such as when Susanna hires a locksmith to change the lock on the apartment's front door to keep Beale out. When they decide to separate, both parents are granted joint custody of Maisie.|$|E
5|$|Gaga {{directed}} the music video, which was filmed in New York City. It {{tells the story}} of when she was signed by her label Interscope Records after being dropped from her former record label, Def Jam Recordings, with scenes in a clinic, a dance studio, her own <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>apartment</b> and on a car's rooftop at a parking lot. She sports outfits by Calvin Klein Collection, Yves Saint Laurent and Stéphane Rolland. Prior to its release, the music video was teased with video stills and previews. Critics wrote positively on the clip, deeming it creative and ambitious, while lauding its narrative theme. Gaga has performed the song in India's Formula One, the MTV Europe Music Awards, The X Factor, and others. She also recorded an acoustic version for her Thanksgiving Day special, A Very Gaga Thanksgiving.|$|E
25|$|In 1997 and {{throughout}} his Assembly career, Silver {{was a key}} advocate of state-administered rent regulation of <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>apartments.</b> This complex and highly politicized system made the Speaker a central figure, continually courted by major participants in the real-estate industry.|$|R

5|$|Johnson's negotiators {{hoped to}} reach a truce in Vietnam prior to the election. Nixon {{received}} astute analysis on the talks from Henry Kissinger, then a consultant to U.S. negotiator Averell Harriman, and his campaign was in regular contact with Anna Chennault (at a July 1968 meeting in Nixon's <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>apartment</b> with South Vietnamese ambassador Bùi Diễm, he had been informed that Chennault would represent Nixon during the campaign). She advised South Vietnamese president Thieu {{not to go to}} Paris to join the talks, hinting that Nixon would give him a better deal if elected. Johnson was aware of what was going on, as he had both Chennault and the South Vietnamese ambassador to Washington bugged, and was enraged by what he considered an attempt by Nixon to undermine U.S. foreign policy. On October 31, with no agreement, Johnson announced a unilateral halt to the bombing, and that peace negotiations would start in Paris on November 6, the day after Election Day. On November 2, after speaking with Chennault again, Thieu stated he would not go to Paris. Johnson telephoned Nixon, who denied any involvement; the President did not believe him. Johnson felt he could not publicly mention Chennault's involvement, which had been obtained by wiretapping, but told Humphrey, who chose not to use the information.|$|E

25|$|The quiet streets {{perpendicular}} to Irving Place have maintained {{their status as}} fashionable residential blocks reminiscent of London's West End. In 1912, a multiple dwelling planned specifically for bachelors appeared at 52 Irving Place.

25|$|In Paris during 1933, Caresse had met Henry Miller. When he {{returned}} to the U.S. in 1940, he confessed to Caresse his lack of success in getting his work published. Miller's autobiographical book Tropic of Cancer was banned in the U.S. as pornographic, and he could get no other work published. She invited him to take a room in her spacious <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>apartment</b> on East 54th Street, where she infrequently lived, which he accepted, though she did not provide him with money.|$|E

Howard relates to the pair being trapped in a world he never made, and wanders off.|$|E
25|$|The {{play was}} {{inspired}} by the real-life story of David Hampton, a con man and robber who managed to convince a {{number of people in the}} 1980s that he was the son of actor Sidney Poitier. The writer John Guare was a friend of Inger McCabe Elliott and her husband Osborn Elliott. In October 1983 Hampton came to the Elliott's <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>apartment</b> and they allowed him to spend the night. The next morning Inger Elliott found Hampton in bed with another man and later called the police. The Elliotts told Guare about the story and it inspired him to write the play years later.|$|E
25|$|His widow Valerie {{attempted}} {{to pay back}} the borrowed option money to Margaret Scott, who had also paid off Pascal's debt to his mistress and his hospital bills. However, by the time the settlement came through Scott had fallen from a <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>apartment</b> building window to her death, just two years after Pascal's. Valerie therefore paid the money to Margaret's daughter instead. After Pascal's death, Valerie married the publisher and philanthropist George T. Delacorte, Jr. and spent {{the rest of her life}} supporting charitable foundations under the name Valerie Delacorte. The Disciple and His Devil, her biography of Pascal, was published by McGraw-Hill in 1970 and reissued by iUniverse in 2004.|$|E
60|$|In Alcala, {{as in most}} of <b>New</b> <b>York's</b> <b>apartment</b> houses, the {{schedule}} of prices is like a badly rolled cigarette--thick {{in the middle and}} thin at both ends. The rooms half-way up are expensive; some of them almost as expensive as if Fashion, instead of being gone for ever, were still lingering. The top rooms are cheap, the ground-floor rooms cheaper still.|$|R

25|$|Sage did {{the bulk}} of her mature work between 1940, when she married Tanguy, and 1955, when he died {{suddenly}} from a cerebral hemorrhage. During {{most of that time}} the two artists lived at Town Farm in Woodbury, Connecticut. (They leased a house in the area beginning in 1941 but maintained a <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>apartment</b> for a while as well; in 1946 they purchased the farm and moved to Woodbury permanently.) They converted a barn on the farm into his-and-hers studios, separated by a partition with a door. Their large home was decorated with numerous pieces of Surrealist art and a variety of unusual objects, including a stuffed raven in a cage and an Eskimo mask.|$|E
25|$|On May 9, 1952, Garfield {{moved out}} of his <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>apartment</b> for the last time, {{indicating}} to friends {{it was not a}} temporary separation from his wife Roberta. He confided to columnist Earl Wilson that he would soon be divorced. Close friends speculated that it was his wife's opposition to his planned confession in Look magazine that triggered the separation. He heard that a HUAC investigator was reviewing his testimony for possible perjury charges. His agent reported that 20th Century-Fox wanted him for a film called Taxi, but would not even begin talks unless the investigation concluded in his favor. Three actor friends, Canada Lee, Mady Christians and J. Edward Bromberg, had all recently died after being listed by the committee.|$|E
25|$|After 1900, {{around the}} time of his father's death, Ryder's {{creativity}} fell dramatically. For {{the rest of his life}} he spent his artistic energy on occasionally re-working existing paintings, some of which lay scattered about his <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>apartment.</b> Visitors to Ryder's home were struck by his slovenly habits—he never cleaned, and his floor was covered with trash, plates with old food, and a thick layer of dust, and he would have to clear space for visitors to stand or sit. He was shy and did not seek the company of others, but received company courteously and enjoyed telling stories or talking about his art. He gained a reputation as a loner, but he maintained social contacts, enjoyed writing letters, and continued to travel on occasion to visit friends.|$|E

500|$|Gaga's {{creative}} team Haus of Gaga {{were later}} chosen {{to direct the}} video instead. Chancler Haynes, Kahn's on-set editor revealed that the mermaid-themed performance of the song, on Le Grand Journal was the actual theme of the video, and included sets built for a hospital scene, Brooklyn Bridge, and a big underwater mermaid scene. However, {{at the last minute}} before shooting, Gaga changed her mind regarding the whole concept, leading to a disagreement with Kahn, and hence it was cancelled. She then shot the scenes with Clarence Clemons in a New York City set. She later explained that her idea was to create a [...] "sweater set of a video". She wanted to acknowledge herself and the success she had experienced in her music career, with a simplified video showing her dancing outside her <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>apartment</b> from her early days. The music video premiered on June 16, 2011, on the eighth season of US reality television show, So You Think You Can Dance.|$|E
500|$|By 1873, Hay was wooing Clara Stone, {{daughter}} of Cleveland multimillionaire railroad and banking mogul Amasa Stone. The {{success of his}} suit (they married in 1874) made the salary attached to office a small consideration {{for the rest of}} his life. Amasa Stone needed someone to watch over his investments, and wanted Hay to move to Cleveland to fill the post. Although the Hays initially lived in John's <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>apartment</b> and later in a townhouse there, they moved in June 1875 to Stone's ornate home on Cleveland's Euclid Avenue, [...] "Millionaire's Row", and a mansion was quickly under construction for the Hays next-door. The Hays had four children, Helen Hay Whitney, Adelbert Barnes Hay, Alice Evelyn Hay Wadsworth Boyd, and Clarence Leonard Hay.
