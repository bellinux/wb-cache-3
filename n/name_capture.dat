5000|$|As a Lisp dialect, Clojure {{supports}} {{functions as}} first-class objects, a read-eval-print loop (REPL), and a macro system.

Clojure does not allow user-defined reader macros, but the reader supports a more constrained form of syntactic extension.

40|$|Binding and {{substitution}} of bound variables are major {{issues in the}} design of languages. Generally, various efforts are made to avoid the phenomenon of <b>name</b> <b>capture.</b> For example, in the -calculus, the reduction of the term (x:x+y) (x) needs first to ff-convert the bound variable x to a new fresh variable z to give the term (z:z + y) (x) which can then be reduced.

We discuss the semantics and the imple-mentation of string origins using the Rascal meta programming language as an example.

40|$|Abstract. We present MMC, a model checker for mobile systems {{specified}} {{in the style of}} the π-calculus. MMC’s development builds on our experience gained in developing XMC, a model checker for an extension of Milner’s value-passing calculus implemented using the XSB tabled logic-programming system. MMC, however, is not simply an extension of XMC; rather it is virtually a complete re-implementation that addresses the salient issues that arise in the π-calculus, including scope extrusion and intrusion, and dynamic generation of new names to avoid <b>name</b> <b>capture.</b> We show that tabled logic programming is especially suitable as an efficient implementation platform for model checking π-calculus specifications, and can be used to obtain an exact encoding of the π-calculus’s transitional semantics. Moreover, MMC is easily extended to handle process expressions in the spi-calculus. Our experimental data shows that MMC outperforms other known tools for model checking the π-calculus. ...|$|E
40|$|Since {{the end of}} {{frequency}} scaling, the programming languages community has started to embrace multi-core and even distributed systems. One paradigm that lends itself well to distribution is stream processing. In stream processing, an application consists of a directed graph of streams and operators, where streams are infinite sequences of data items, and operators fire in infinite loops to process data. This model directly exposes parallelism, requires no shared memory, and is a good match for several emerging application domains. Unfortunately, streaming languages have so far been lacking in abstraction. This paper introduces higher-order composite operators, which encapsulate stream subgraphs, and contracts, which specify pre- and post-conditions for composites. Composites are expanded at compile time, {{in a manner similar}} to macros. Their contractual obligations are also checked at compile-time. We build on existing work on macros and contracts to implement higherorder composites. The user-visible language features provide a consistent look-and-feel for the streaming language, whereas the underlying implementation provides high-quality static error messages and prevents accidental <b>name</b> <b>capture...</b>|$|E

40|$|Language extensions, such as {{embedded}} domain-specific languages, {{are often}} implemented by assimilating (rewriting) the extended language constructs {{to the host}} language. The result can then be compiled by a standard compiler. This approach {{is limited by the}} host language, which may not be designed with code generation in mind. An example of this is Java, which provides insufficient protection against <b>name</b> <b>capture</b> of host language identifiers, and does not provide the same low-level primitives that exist in the underlying Java Virtual Machine. For example, it does not provide equivalents for a jump or jump subroutine instruction, unbalanced synchronization, stack manipulation, or specification of debugging information. Code generated from a language that does not match Java’s structure can therefore require inefficient or laborious alternatives instead. We propose a new open compiler model to provide generators direct access to the underlying compiled code. With conventional open compilers, leveraging the bytecode-generating back-end is an intricate process, requiring adaptations tangled throughout the system. The result is hard to develop, understand, and maintain. By providing a mixed source language of Java and the underlying bytecode instruction language, we can provide access to the back-end at the source-level. Compiled instructions can be used in place of statements or expressions, which can aid language extensions but also applications of separat...|$|E
40|$|Refactoring is {{the process}} of reorganising or {{restructuring}} code by means of behaviour-preserving program transformations, themselves called refactorings. Most modern development environments come with built-in support for refactoring in the form of automated refactorings that the user can perform at the push of a button. Implementing refactorings is notoriously complex, however, and even state-of-the-art implementations have very low standards of correctness and can introduce subtle changes of behaviour into refactored programs. In this thesis, we develop concepts and techniques that make it possible to give concise, modular specifications of refactorings. These specifications are precise enough to cover all details of the object language, and thus give rise to full featured, high-quality refactoring implementations. Their modularity, on the other hand, makes them amenable to formal proof, and hence opens the door to the rigorous verification of refactorings. We discuss a disciplined approach to maintaining name bindings and avoiding <b>name</b> <b>capture</b> by treating the binding from a name to the declaration it refers to as a dependency that the refactoring has to preserve. This approach readily generalises to other types of dependencies for capturing control flow, data flow and synchronisation behaviour. To implement complex refactorings, it is often helpful for the refactoring to internally work on a richer language with language extensions that make the transformation easier to express. We show how this allows the decomposition of refactorings into small microrefactorings that can be specified, implemented and verified in isolation. We evaluate our approach by giving specifications and implementations of many commonly used refactorings that are concise, yet match the implementations in the popular Java development environment Eclipse in terms of features, and outperform them in terms of correctness. We give detailed informal correctness proofs for some of our specifications, which are greatly aided by their modular structure. Finally, we discuss a rigorous formalisation of the central name binding framework used by most of our specifications in the theorem prover Coq, and show how its correctness can be established mechanically...|$|E
