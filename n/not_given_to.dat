5|$|Most modern {{historians have}} noted how the Gregorian missionaries come across in Bede's account as {{colourless}} and boring, {{compared to the}} Irish missionaries in Northumbria, and this is related directly to the way Bede gathered his information. The historian Henry Mayr-Harting argues that in addition, most of the Gregorian missionaries were concerned with the Roman virtue of gravitas, or personal dignity <b>not</b> <b>given</b> <b>to</b> emotional displays, and this would have limited the colourful stories available about them.|$|E
5|$|The Belgians and French {{remained}} {{confused about}} {{what was expected of}} each other if or when, hostilities commenced. The Belgians were determined to hold the border fortifications along the Albert Canal and the Meuse, without withdrawing, until the French Army arrived to support them. Gamelin was not keen on pushing his Dyle plan that far. He was concerned that the Belgians would be driven out of their defences and would retreat to Antwerp, as in 1914. In fact, the Belgian divisions protecting the border were to withdraw and retreat southward to link up with French forces. This information was <b>not</b> <b>given</b> <b>to</b> Gamelin.|$|E
5|$|The {{careers of}} Brahmins usually related to education, the judiciary, astrology, mathematics, poetry and {{philosophy}} or {{the occupation of}} hereditary administrative posts. Also Brahmins increasingly practiced non-Brahminical professions (agriculture, trade in betel nuts and martial posts). Capital punishment, although widespread, was <b>not</b> <b>given</b> <b>to</b> the royal Kshatriya sub-castes or to Brahmins found guilty of heinous crimes (as {{the killing of a}} Brahmin in medieval Hindu India was itself considered a heinous crime). As an alternate punishment to enforce the law a Brahmin's right hand and left foot was severed, leaving that person disabled.|$|E

5|$|Under John, {{the monks}} of Bath became {{known for their}} scholarship, {{although}} he was not particularly noted for learning. William of Malmsebury claimed he was generous and affable, although the chronicler acknowledged that the bishop treated the canons of Wells abominably. William also recorded that John was a heavy drinker and <b>not</b> <b>given</b> <b>to</b> self-restraint, but that his health was good and he lived to be old. At first he treated the monks at Bath with contempt and confiscated much of the lands of the abbey for his own use, but in 1106 he restored their lands to them. John's canons of Wells disliked him because he reduced their income and destroyed some of their buildings {{as part of the}} movement of the see to Bath. A layman official of the diocese, Hildebert, was probably John's brother; and he held the offices of steward of the diocese and was also the provost of Wells, an inheritable office. John gave much of the revenues of Wells to Hildebert. Another relative, a nephew also named John, was named archdeacon in the diocese.|$|E

25|$|Italy's {{demands in}} the Paris peace {{settlement}} of 1919 were not fully achieved, Italy did attain Trentino, Trieste, the Istrian peninsula, and South Tyrol from Austria-Hungary, though other territories previously promised to Italy were <b>not</b> <b>given</b> <b>to</b> it.|$|E

25|$|In {{anonymous}} peer review, reviewers {{are known}} to the journal editor or conference organiser but their names are <b>not</b> <b>given</b> <b>to</b> the article's author. In some cases, the author's identity can also be anonymised for the review process, with identifying information is stripped from the document before review. The system is intended to reduce or eliminate bias.|$|E
25|$|The {{makers of}} the show insist that the answers are <b>not</b> <b>given</b> <b>to</b> the panelists beforehand. The host is given a list of {{questions}} about an hour before the show, for preparatory purposes, but the guests are forbidden to ask for preparatory materials or other help. Alan Davies never does any preparation.|$|E
25|$|The Secular Franciscan charism is <b>not</b> <b>given</b> <b>to</b> an {{individual}} person {{but to a}} group of brothers and sisters. As times change, it has to adapt to the needs and expectations of the Holy Church. Thus from the outset, it is a group that is shaped by the Holy Church, and it is only in this context that the charism can thrive.|$|E

25|$|It {{has been}} {{alleged that the}} British, Irish and US {{intelligence}} agencies had information which could have prevented the bombing, most of which came from double agents inside the Real IRA. This information was <b>not</b> <b>given</b> <b>to</b> the local police, the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC). In 2008 {{it was revealed that}} British intelligence agency GCHQ was monitoring conversations between the bombers as the bomb was being driven into Omagh.|$|E
25|$|Unlike the Academy Award for Best Picture, which officially goes to {{the winning}} film's producers, the Foreign Language Film Award is <b>not</b> <b>given</b> <b>to</b> a {{specific}} individual but is considered an award for the submitting country as a whole. For example, the Oscar statuette won by the Canadian film The Barbarian Invasions (2003) was until recently {{on display at the}} Museum of Civilization in Quebec City. It is now on display at the TIFF Bell lightbox.|$|E
25|$|In 2005 Giovanni Galloni, former {{national}} vice-secretary of Christian Democracy, said that during {{a discussion with}} Moro about the difficulty to find the Red Brigades' bases Moro {{told him that he}} knew of the presence of US and Israeli intelligence agents infiltrated within the BR. However the information obtained was <b>not</b> <b>given</b> <b>to</b> the Italian investigators. He also declared that the reason of the assassination of journalist Carmine Pecorelli was the same information, perhaps coming from the United States.|$|E

25|$|Thus as the Apostle Paul advises {{that the}} Mosaic Covenant of Sinai {{does not in}} itself prevent Jews from sinning and dying, and is <b>not</b> <b>given</b> <b>to</b> Gentiles at all (only the Noahic {{covenant}} is unique in applying to all humanity), Christians believe the New Covenant ends the original sin and death for everyone who becomes a Christian and cannot simply be a renewal of the Mosaic Covenant since it seemingly accomplishes new things. See types of Supersessionism for details.|$|E
25|$|U.S. International {{ended their}} hockey program in 1988 for similar reasons as Northern Arizona. Historically UAF and in-state rival Alaska-Anchorage have had {{difficulty}} scheduling opponents {{due to the}} large distances between schools and increased travel expenses. All four GWHC schools required opponents to fly in and fly out. To combat scheduling difficulties, especially with out of conference scheduling, NCAA gives the Alaska schools scheduling advantage, games in Alaska don't count against teams' NCAA game limit. This advantage was <b>not</b> <b>given</b> <b>to</b> NAU or USIU, both schools in the Lower 48.|$|E
25|$|In Italy, the Lombards then imposed {{themselves}} at first {{as the dominant}} caste {{in place of the}} former lineages, who were subsequently extinguished or exiled. The products of the land were allocated to his Roman subjects that worked it, giving to the Lombards a third (tertia) of crops. The proceeds were <b>not</b> <b>given</b> <b>to</b> individuals but to the family, which administered them in the halls (a term still used in the Italian toponymy). The economic system of late antiquity, which focused on large estates worked by peasants in semi-servile condition, was not revolutionized, but modified only to benefit the new rulers.|$|E
25|$|After {{the release}} of The Ninth Gate, Artisan sued Polanski for taking more than $1 million from the budget, refunds of France's {{value-added}} tax that he did <b>not</b> <b>give</b> <b>to</b> the completion bond company guaranteeing Artisan Entertainment a completed film.|$|R

25|$|Article 26 of the Schengen Convention {{says that}} {{carriers}} which transport {{people into the}} Schengen area shall, if they transport people who are refused entry into the Schengen Area, be responsible {{to pay for the}} return of the refused people, and pay penalties. Further clauses on this topic are found in EU directive 2001/51/EC. This has had the effect that migrants without a visa are not allowed on aircraft, boats or trains going into the Schengen Area, so migrants without a visa have resorted to migrant smugglers. Humanitarian visas are in general <b>not</b> <b>given</b> <b>to</b> refugees who want to apply for asylum.|$|E
25|$|On January 20, 2011 Ryan {{proposes to}} Greenlee and she happily accepts. Soon after, Greenlee and Ryan {{announce}} their engagement to Erica and Jack, and later Kendall. All {{of them seem}} to be very happy for Ryan and Greenlee. After receiving a call from David, Erica convinces Greenlee to confront David and get the divorce papers signed. Later, Greenlee confronts David, who notices she is wearing a ring, one that he had <b>not</b> <b>given</b> <b>to</b> her. After talking with David and revealing that she is now engaged to Ryan, she convinces David to sign the divorce papers.|$|E
25|$|NY355 was {{assigned}} by 1946 {{to a short}} connector highway between NY66 in North Greenbush and NY154 (Spring Avenue) {{in the town of}} Poestenkill. From there, NY154 continued east to the hamlet of Poestenkill, where it ended at a junction with Round Top and White Church Roads. On April1, 1980, ownership and maintenance of NY154 from the Troy city line to NY355 was transferred from the state of New York to Rensselaer County as part of a highway maintenance swap. The NY154 designation was completely removed on May14, 1980, and the portion of NY154's routing that was <b>not</b> <b>given</b> <b>to</b> Rensselaer County became an eastward extension of NY355.|$|E
