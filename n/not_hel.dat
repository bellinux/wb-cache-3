40|$|Progenitor cell {{failure in}} the erythroid lineage is a {{particular}} problem in bone marrow failure. To provide insight into early erythopoietic development we used sensitive techniques {{to examine the effects}} of SCF, IL- 3 and MIP- 1 alpha on two developmentally arrested progenitor cell lines, HEL and K 562. Quantitative flowcytometric analysis showed that both expressed receptors (SCF > MIP- 1 alpha > IL- 3). Qualitative analysis revealed HEL cells expressed more receptors than K 562 cells. Clonogenic assays with sensitive haemoglobin detection showed that SCF and IL- 3 did <b>not</b> support <b>HEL</b> development and reduced haemoglobin production. MIP- 1 alpha reduced partially developed HEL colonies and haemoglobin in developed colonies. SCF increased development, but not haemoglobin in K 562 cells, with IL- 3 being more effective in both. MIP- 1 alpha increased the proportion of well-developed K 562 colonies but not haemoglobin. This suggests SCF, IL- 3 and MIP- 1 alpha all have a role to play in early erythroid cellular development, with differing actions depending on the stage of development...|$|R

40|$|Myeloproliferative {{neoplasms}} (MPN) {{are multiple}} disease entities characterized by clonal expansion {{of one or}} more of the myeloid lineages (i. e. granulocytic, erythroid, megakaryocytic and mast cell). JAK 2 mutations, such as the common V 617 F substitution and the less common exon 12 mutations, are frequently detected in such tumor cells and have been incorporated into the diagnostic criteria published by the World Health Organization since 2008. However, the mechanism by which these mutations contribute to MPN development is poorly understood. We examined gene expression profiles of MPN patients focusing on genes in the JAK–STAT signaling pathway using low-density real-time PCR arrays. We identified the following 2 upregulated genes in MPN patients: a known target of the JAK–STAT axis, SOCS 3, and a potentially novel target, SPI 1, encoding PU. 1. Induction of PU. 1 expression by JAK 2 V 617 F in JAK 2 -wildtype K 562 cells and its downregulation by JAK 2 siRNA transfection in JAK 2 V 617 F-positive HEL cells supported this possibility. We also found that the ABL 1 kinase inhibitor imatinib was very effective in suppressing PU. 1 expression in BCR-ABL 1 -positive K 562 cells but <b>not</b> in <b>HEL</b> cells. This suggests that PU. 1 expression is regulated by both JAK 2 and ABL 1. The contribution of the two kinases in driving PU. 1 expression was dominant for JAK 2 and ABL 1 in HEL and K 562 cells, respectively. Therefore, PU. 1 may be a common transcription factor upregulated in MPN. PU. 1 is a transcription factor required for myeloid differentiation and is implicated in erythroid leukemia. Therefore, expression of PU. 1 downstream of activated JAK 2 may explain why JAK 2 mutations ar...|$|R
40|$|We {{analyzed}} {{the role of}} Ab affinity on Ab-mediated Ag uptake and presentation to T cells. Hen egg white lysozyme (HEL) was captured by bifunctional hybrid proteins (Fv-MalE) in which the variable fragment (Fv) of the anti-HEL mAb D 1. 3 was covalently linked to the Escherichia coli MalE protein. These complexes were targeted via two anti-MalE mAbs to an APC expressing a receptor for the Ab constant region. The combination of Fv-MalE and anti-MalE mAbs increased, specifically, HEL presentation. With this experimental system, we evaluated the impact of six different mutations, affecting the Fv-MalE complementarity de-termining regions, on the increase of HEL presentation by the corresponding hybrids. These mutations increase the dissociation rate constant (koff), and, thus, the dissociation constant of the HEL/Fv-MalE interaction, up to 650 -fold, {{as compared with the}} wt Fv-MalE. Increasing the koff from 7 3 1024 s 21 up to 300 3 1024 s 21 did not interfere with the enhancement of HEL presentation. A mutant with a koff of 600 3 1024 s 21 had a reduced enhancement ability, and mutants with koff higher than 5700 3 1024 s 21 did <b>not</b> enhance <b>HEL</b> presentation at all. These results show that affinity determines the efficiency of Ab-mediated Ag presentation to T cells. One consequence is that affinity maturation in specific B lymphocytes can drastically enhance their ability to collaborate with T cells in an MHC-restricted way. This may contribute to the selection of high affinity B cell clones. The Journal of Immunology, 1998, 161 : 4542 – 4548.

40|$|Decitabine is a {{hydrophilic}} {{drug that}} acts by hypomethylating DNA. Decitabine {{is used in}} Europe {{for the treatment of}} acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in patients aged ≥ 65 years. However, it can only be administered intravenously due to very low oral bioavailability and a large distribution volume. Oral administration would allow outpatient treatment, improving quality of life and reducing treatment costs. The present study proposes to develop lipid nanocapsules (LNCs), originally designed for lipophilic drugs, to encapsulate decitabine. Two different formulations of LNCs were designed: LNCs based on a high proportion of Transcutol® HP (THP-LNCs) and LNCs associated with a mixture of Transcutol® HP and Tween® 80 (THP-T 80 -LNCs). The second formulation had a diameter of 26. 5 ± 0. 5  nm, high encapsulation efficiency (> 85 %), and a drug payload of 472 ± 64 µg/mL. Decitabine-loaded THP-T 80 -LNC cytotoxicity was evaluated on two AML cell lines depending on their decitabine resistance: <b>HEL</b> (<b>not</b> resistant) and HL- 60 (resistant). The permeability of decitabine-loaded THP-T 80 -LNCs was also evaluated on Caco- 2 cell monolayers. Decitabine cytotoxicity against HEL and HL- 60 was higher when decitabine was loaded in THP-T 80 -LNCs than when free. Apparent permeability on Caco- 2 cell monolayers was also increased, suggesting a potentially useful formulation to increase the oral bioavailability of decitabine...|$|R

40|$|In view {{of further}} elucidating the {{cytotoxic}} {{mechanism of the}} tumor necrosis factor (TNF), {{the relationship between the}} number of TNF receptors and susceptibility to its cytotoxicity on TNF-sensitive tumor cells and on certain normal cells was firstly studied by a specific binding assay. A fairly good correlation was shown between the receptor number and the sensitivity of the tumor cells. However, for normal cells, despite the existence of TNF receptors, no cytotoxic effect was observed. Furthermore, certain normal diploid cells underwent a proliferation as a result of TNF stimulation. The internalization process and intracellular distribution of 125 I labeled TNF in L-M cell (murine tumorigenic fibroblasts, highly sensitive to TNF cytotoxicity) and HEL cell (human embryonic lung cells, non-sensitive to TNF cytotoxicity), were elucidated by pulse labeling and Percoll density gradient centrifugation. In both L-M and HEL cells, receptor-bound 125 I-TNF was rapidly internalized and delivered to lysosomes within 15 - 30 min., followed by a degradation and release into the culture medium. The impairment of the cytotoxic process by cytoskeletal disrupting or lysosomotropic agents also indicated that internalization of TNF into cells, followed by the fusion of pinosomes with lysosomes, is essential in the cytolytic mechanism of TNF. Effect of TNF treatment on the RNA and protein synthesis of target cells was then studied using 3 H-UDR and 35 S-methionine incorporation. RNA synthesis and protein synthesis were markedly enhanced by TNF treatment in L-M cells, but <b>not</b> in <b>HEL</b> cells. By treating the L-M cells with actinomycin D or cycloheximide which inhibit RNA or protein synthesis, their susceptibility to TNF was rather increased. And even in TNF non-sensitive HEL cells, the cytotoxic activity of TNF was newly evoked by using actinomycin D or cycloheximide. These results suggest that TNF, bound on the surface receptors of tumor cells, is rapidly internalized into the cells and delivered to lysosomes, and that the lysosomal enzyme seemed to play an essential role in the cytolytic reaction since lysosomotropic agents impair the cytotoxic activity of TNF. Normal cells, on the other hand, always are equipped with a defence system which protects them from cytotoxic attack of TNF. Although tumor cells are also provided with this defence system, produced by the stimulation of TNF, they eventually undergo cytolysis by the attack of TNF due to its relative insufficiency...|$|R
40|$|B 10 (H- 2 b) mice are genetic nonresponders to hen egg-white {{lysozyme}} (HEL) and the distantly related human lysozyme (HUL). However, anti-HEL or anti-HUL {{primary antibody}} responses in vivo or in vitro {{can be obtained}} in B 10 mice by immunization with the appropriate lysozyme coupled to erythrocytes. T cells able to suppress either anti-lysozyme plaque-forming cells (PFC) response are induced in B 10 mice after immunization with HEL-complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) or HUL-CFA. This cross-reactivity of HEL and HUL in the induction and the expression of suppressive activity is {{in marked contrast to}} their very low cross- reactivity at the PFC level. These results suggest that either HEL or HUL can stimulate a suppressor T cell which recognizes a particular epitope present on both lysozymes. Suppressor cells induced by HEL or HUL bear the same predominant idiotype found on the majority of anti- HEL antibodies, and on the small proportion of anti-HUL antibodies cross-reactive with HEL.

40|$|Ascorbic acid {{is widely}} used as a {{prophylactic}} and therapeutic agent against the common cold, and is in fact often recommended for this purpose by medical practitioners. It may be administered as a large dose {{as soon as possible}} after the first symptoms are felt, and this dosage is then continued for a few days in order to " abort " the cold. Though many people use this treatment on themselves and believe it is effective, it is impossible to assess its efficacy. Untreated subjects may experience symptoms such as sneezing or a mild sore throat, which then disappear without going on to a full cold, and patients' assessments of their colds are much influenced by any treatment owing to the placebo effect (Diehl et a/., 1938). In these studies we attempted to show by in-vitro experiments that exposure of cells to ascorbic acid increased their resistance to infection with viruses.

According to a previous formulation developed by Vrignaud et al. (2), LNCs associated with a mixture of Transcutol® HP and Tween® 80 (THP-T 80 -LNCs) were designed. Size and drug payload (determined after an ultracentrifugation to collect the free decitabine and the decitabine loaded in THP-T 80 -LNCs) were determined.   A size of 26. 5 ± 0. 5 nm, a high encapsulation efficiency (over 85 %), and a drug payload of 472 ± 64 µg/mL were obtained. Then, a plasma stability of free-decitabine and decitabine-loaded THP-T 80 -LNCs was performed. After encapsulation, decitabine degradation was slowed down in comparison to the free-drug. Finally, decitabine-loaded THP-T 80 -LNC cytotoxicity was evaluated on two AML cell lines depending on their decitabine resistance: <b>HEL</b> (<b>not</b> resistant) and HL- 60 (resistant).

Apparent permeability on Caco- 2 cell monolayers was also increased after encapsulation. To conclude, THP-T 80 -LNCs were able to encapsulate a hydrophilic drug, decitabine.
