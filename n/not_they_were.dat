5|$|George's {{arrangement}} remained current until 2007, when Austin Mast and Kevin Thiele transferred Dryandra into Banksia. They {{also published}} B.subg. Spathulatae for the Banksia taxa having spoon-shaped cotyledons, thus redefining B.subg. Banksia as comprising {{those that do}} <b>not.</b> <b>They</b> <b>were</b> not ready, however, to tender an infrageneric arrangement encompassing Dryandra, so as an interim measure they transferred Dryandra into Banksia at series rank. This minimised the nomenclatural disruption of the transfer, but also caused George's rich infrageneric arrangement to be set aside. Thus under the interim arrangements implemented by Mast and Thiele, B.sessilis is placed in B.subg. Banksia, ser. Dryandra.|$|E
5|$|Weather ship {{observations}} {{proved to}} be helpful in wind and wave studies, as commercial shipping tended to avoid weather systems for safety reasons, whereas the weather ships did <b>not.</b> <b>They</b> <b>were</b> also helpful in monitoring storms at sea, such as tropical cyclones. Beginning in the 1970s, their role was largely superseded by weather buoys because of the ships' significant cost. The removal of a weather ship became a negative factor in forecasts {{leading up to the}} Great Storm of 1987. The last weather ship was Polarfront, known as weather station M ("Mike"), which was removed from operation on January 1, 2010. Weather observations from ships continue from a fleet of voluntary merchant vessels in routine commercial operation.|$|E
5|$|With the film's Laserdisc release, Variety first {{reported}} in March 1994 that observers uncovered several scenes of antics from the animators that supposedly featured brief nudity of the Jessica Rabbit character. While undetectable when {{played at the}} usual rate of 24 film frames per second, the Laserdisc player allowed the viewer to advance frame-by-frame to uncover these visuals. Whether or <b>not</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> actually intended to depict the nudity of the character remains unknown. Many retailers said that within minutes of the Laserdisc debut, their entire inventory was sold out. The run was fueled by media reports about the controversy, including stories on CNN and various newspapers.|$|E

5|$|Although the use {{of small}} private vessels for {{personal}} transport undoubtably extends back into prehistory, large ships capable of braving the open ocean were typically dedicated to trade or fishing for most of human history. Even military campaigns would often simply hire or commandeer these private fleets to serve as troop transports, as did the traders, pilgrims, and wealthy tourists of antiquity and the Middle Ages. The voyages of exploration and colonization were often provided for by the crown out of naval funds; where they were <b>not,</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> usually chartered or else purchased and then used for shipping supplies after the initial settlement. Dedicated and scheduled local passenger services came to be offered in the 16th and 17th centuries, but the 1817 Black Ball was the first trans-Atlantic passenger line. In the Age of Sail, the duration of such passages depended much on the prevailing winds and the weather. The 18th-century coastal Margate hoys began the popularization of leisure travel in Britain and Ireland that later gathered steam with Thomas Cook's package tours in the next century. During the 19th century, steam-powered ocean liners connected the railroad networks of the world. By 1900, the Atlantic crossing took about five days and the passenger lines competed to win the Blue Riband, an unofficial accolade accorded to the fastest liner in regular service. For twenty years from 1909, the prize went to the RMS Mauretania for its average speed of 26.06 knots (48.26km/h). This era waned as cheaper and faster intercontinental flights became available, most importantly the 1958 New York City–Paris route.|$|E
5|$|Dixon then {{travelled}} to Australia {{with his}} wife to engage in itinerant preaching there. Dixon hoped to find Jenner there, although Dixon did not yet {{know the name of}} the man he was looking for. In Adelaide, Dixon told the stories of Culver and Stanton while preaching. Murray Wilkes then approached Dixon and said that he had also become a Christian after having been asked Jenner's question on George Street. At a Methodist church in Perth, Dixon told Culver's, Stanton's, and Wilkes' stories again, and met yet another person who had become a Christian after an encounter with Jenner. Finally arriving in Sydney, Dixon asked Alec Gilchrist of Campaigners for Christ if he knew a man who asked strangers on George Street whether or <b>not</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> headed for heaven or hell. Gilchrist was familiar with Jenner and informed Dixon about how to contact Jenner. Dixon visited Jenner at his house and told him about all the people he had met who had become Christians because of Jenner's evangelism. Jenner, now fifty years old, had never before heard of even one person living their lives as Christians {{as a result of his}} evangelism, and he cried upon hearing that there were several.|$|E
5|$|Han society {{below the}} level of kings was divided into twenty ranks, which awarded certain {{privileges}} such as exemption from certain laws, the nineteenth being a marquess and the twentieth being a full marquess—the difference being the former was only given a pension while the latter was given a marquessate (houguo 侯國)—typically the size of a county. If the kings' sons were grandsons of the emperor, they were made full marquesses; if <b>not,</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> considered commoners. However, this rule was changed in 127 BC so that all the kings' sons were made full marquesses. It is unknown whether early Western-Han marquessates enjoyed the same level of autonomy as early Western-Han kingdoms; by 145 BC, all marquessates' staff were appointed by the central government. The marquess had no administrative role over his marquessate; he merely collected a portion of the tax revenues. His Chancellor was the equivalent of a county Prefect.|$|E

5|$|Henry of Huntingdon {{records that}} noblemen sent their {{children}} to be educated at Bloet's household, whether or <b>not</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> destined {{for a career in}} the church. King Henry's illegitimate son Robert of Gloucester was educated in Bloet's care. Another illegitimate son of Henry's, Richard of Lincoln, was also in Bloet's household for an education. Gilbert of Sempringham, who founded the Gilbertine Order, was also educated in Bloet's household, entering it before Bloet's death and continuing there under Bloet's successor Alexander of Lincoln. Besides educating laymen, Bloet educated his own household clergy, including sending some of them to study under Ivo, Bishop of Chartres. He was known for his ostentatious manner of living, and served personally in war when needed. The medieval chronicler William of Malmesbury claimed that he hated monks. Henry of Huntingdon, however, remembered him as handsome, cheerful and affable. Earlier in his episcopate, Bloet had aided Christina of Markyate's family in their attempts to get the religious hermit to marry, at one point giving a judicial judgement that she must marry, which she refused to do. It was only after Bloet's death that Christina was able to be consecrated as a recluse at St Albans Abbey.|$|E

The prosecution had discharged two potential jurors who refused to say whether or <b>not</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> living in polygamy.
