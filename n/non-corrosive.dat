25|$|From an {{electrical}} {{point of view}} the electrolyte in an electrolytic capacitor is the actual cathode of the capacitor and must have good electrical conductivity, which is actually ion-conductivity in liquids. But {{it is also a}} chemical mixture of solvents with acid or alkali additives, which must be <b>non-corrosive</b> (chemically inert) so that the capacitor, whose inner components are made of aluminum, remains stable over its expected lifetime. In addition to the good conductivity of operating electrolytes, there are other requirements, including chemical stability, chemical compatibility with aluminum, and low cost. The electrolyte should also provide oxygen for the forming processes and self-healing. This diversity of requirements for the liquid electrolyte results in a broad variety of proprietary solutions, with thousands of patented electrolytes.|$|E
25|$|The {{water is}} {{pressurized}} in two stages, and flows {{through a series}} of six or seven intermediate feed water heaters, heated up at each point with steam extracted from an appropriate duct on the turbines and gaining temperature at each stage. Typically, {{in the middle of this}} series of feedwater heaters, and before the second stage of pressurization, the condensate plus the makeup water flows through a deaerator that removes dissolved air from the water, further purifying and reducing its corrosiveness. The water may be dosed following this point with hydrazine, a chemical that removes the remaining oxygen in the water to below 5 parts per billion (ppb). It is also dosed with pH control agents such as ammonia or morpholine to keep the residual acidity low and thus <b>non-corrosive.</b>|$|E
500|$|On December 27, 1999, {{the state}} awarded a $85.7million {{contract}} (equivalent to $ in [...] ) for {{the replacement of}} the S-Curve on US131. Deposits of gypsum under the roadway were dissolving and causing it to settle. A deteriorating bridge also forced the reconstruction of the freeway through the area. Construction began on January 15, 2000, diverting the roughly 115,000vehicles per day that used the stretch of road to detours through the downtown area. As part of the project, a $1.2million (equivalent to $ in [...] ) de-icing system was installed. The system is designed to spray a de-icing fluid on the roadway that would be carried by car tires up to a mile (1.6km) along the road surface. This fluid is expected to melt ice at temperatures below the [...] at which salt stops working. [...] Unlike salt, the <b>non-corrosive</b> de-icer does not harm the bridge, but it is more costly. The system is designed to be activated manually, or automatically via sensors along the road. However, plowing would still be required on the roadway. The idea behind the de-icing system is to keep the pavement wet and prevent the formation of ice.|$|E
500|$|Seeing {{stellite}} as a {{far more}} valuable metal, he decided to keep its patent for himself and founded the Haynes Stellite Company in Kokomo to produce the metal in September 1912. Many of his initial requests for the metal were from medical tool manufacturers who saw the alloy as the best for surgical tools. Because his company could not produce enough of the metal to satisfy demand, Haynes issued licenses to several companies in the United States, Canada, and Europe to produce the alloy and pay him royalties. Haynes strictly controlled production, and did not permit the other licensees to sell stellite in its raw form, but to only sell it as specific finished products. In that way, he remained the only vendor who could sell sheets of the metal. As World War I broke out, his company received large government contracts {{for use of the}} material. Stellite was found to have excellent applications in airplanes, and because it was <b>non-corrosive</b> and could protect its contents indefinitely, it proved to be the best metal available for ammunition casing. In 1916 alone, the company registered $1.3million in sales. The rapid growth of the business made Haynes increasingly wealthy and he became a millionaire that year. Despite his large income, he refused to provide his employees a year-end bonus, causing a significant stir in the factory. When a foreman demanded to know the reason that their wages were not raised, he told him, [...] "It doesn't pay to give the working man too much moneyit makes him too independent." [...] His statement was widely repeated and, although he claimed to have made it in jest, it alienated a large part of his workforce and began a period of labor problems.|$|E

2500|$|Since 1975, Greece {{has been}} {{restoring}} the Acropolis. This restoration has included replacing {{the thousands of}} rusting iron clamps and supports {{that had previously been}} used, with <b>non-corrosive</b> titanium rods; removing surviving artwork from the building into storage and subsequently into a new museum built specifically for the display of the Parthenon art; and replacing the artwork with high-quality replicas. This process has come under fire from some groups as some buildings have been completely dismantled, including the dismantling of the Temple of Athena Nike and for the unsightly nature of the site due to the necessary cranes and scaffolding. But the hope is to restore the site to some of its former glory, which may take another 20 years and 70 million euros, though the prospect of the Acropolis being [...] "able to withstand the most extreme weather conditionsâ€“ earthquakes" [...] is [...] "little consolation to the tourists visiting the Acropolis" [...] according to The Guardian.
