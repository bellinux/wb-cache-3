The use of Adaptive Noise Cancellation to remove <b>background</b> <b>noise</b> at measurement microphones is compromised when the reference sensor measures both <b>background</b> and desired <b>noise.</b> The technique proposed modifies the classical processing configuration {{based on the}} cross-correlation between the reference and primary microphone. <b>Background</b> <b>noise</b> attenuation is achieved using a cross-correlation sample width that encompasses only the <b>background</b> <b>noise</b> and a matched delay for the adaptive processing. A present limitation of the method is that a minimum time delay between the <b>background</b> <b>noise</b> and desired signal must exist {{in order for the}} correlated parts of the desired signal to be separated from the <b>background</b> <b>noise</b> in the crosscorrelation.

50|$|The {{background}} noise {{present in the}} ocean, or ambient noise, has many different sources and varies with location and frequency. At the lowest frequencies, from about 0.1 Hz to 10 Hz, ocean turbulence and microseisms are the primary contributors to the <b>noise</b> <b>background.</b> Typical noise spectrum levels decrease with increasing frequency from about 140 dB re 1 μPa²/Hz at 1 Hz to about 30 dB re 1 μPa²/Hz at 100 kHz. Distant ship traffic {{is one of the}} dominant noise sources in most areas for frequencies of around 100 Hz, while wind-induced surface noise is the main source between 1 kHz and 30 kHz. At very high frequencies, above 100 kHz, thermal noise of water molecules begins to dominate. The thermal noise spectral level at 100 kHz is 25 dB re 1 μPa²/Hz. The spectral density of thermal noise increases by 20 dB per decade (approximately 6 dB per octave).|$|E
5000|$|The waterhole, {{or water}} hole, is an {{especially}} quiet band {{of the electromagnetic spectrum}} between 1,420 and 1,666 megahertz, corresponding to wavelengths of 21 and 18 centimeters respectively. It is a popular observing frequency used by radio telescopes in radio astronomy. The term was coined by Bernard Oliver in 1971. The strongest hydroxyl radical spectral line radiates at 18 centimeters, and hydrogen at 21 centimeters. These two molecules, which combined form water, are widespread in interstellar gas, and their presence absorbs radio noise at these frequencies. Therefore, the spectrum between these frequencies form a [...] "quiet" [...] channel in the interstellar radio <b>noise</b> <b>background.</b> Bernard M. Oliver theorized that the waterhole would be an obvious band for communication with extraterrestrial intelligence, hence the name, which is a form of pun: in English, a watering hole is a vernacular reference to a common place to meet and talk. Several programs involved in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence, including SETI@home, search in the waterhole radio frequencies.|$|E
5000|$|Although not {{a formal}} part of HPM, signal {{detection}} theory has {{an influence on}} the method, especially within the Integrated Models. SDT is almost certainly the best-known and most extensively used modeling framework in human factors, and is a key feature of education regarding human sensation and perception. In application, the situation of interest is one in which a human operator has to make a binary judgement about whether a signal is present or absent in a <b>noise</b> <b>background.</b> This judgement may be applied in any number of vital contexts. Besides the response of the operator, there are two possible [...] "true" [...] states of the world - either the signal was present or it was not. If the operator correctly identifies the signal as present, this is termed a hit (H). If the operator responds that a signal was present when there was no signal, this is termed a false alarm (FA). If the operator correctly responds when no signal is present, this is termed a correct rejection (CR). If a signal is present and the operator fails to identify it, this is termed a miss (M).|$|E

40|$|The {{interaction}} between the telegraph <b>noise</b> and <b>background</b> voltage fluctuations in the current induced dissipative state of high-Tc BiSrCaCuO thin films has been investigated. Experimental time records of the voltage drop across current biased thin film strips show markedly different <b>background</b> <b>noise</b> traces in {{the up and down}} telegraph states. Detailed analysis demonstrates that fluctuations around the telegraph voltage levels are due to a unique <b>background</b> <b>noise</b> process. The apparent quiet and noisy voltage states are due only to differences in the effective frequency bandwidth at which <b>background</b> <b>noise</b> is seen at distinct telegraph levels.

30|$|The {{results with}} and without the OM-LSA {{estimator}} show same tendency. When the <b>background</b> <b>noise</b> exists, the speech modeling accuracy of the LTP filter is degraded by the <b>background</b> <b>noise.</b> However, the LTP analysis and synthesis process does not amplify the <b>background</b> <b>noise</b> component because the LTP method prevents the over-estimating of the signal. Since the pitch prediction gain is restricted to a certain constant, e.g., 1.2, the synthesized signal does not become {{much larger than the}} input [12]. The results utilizing the OM-LSA estimator show much higher objective scores because the <b>background</b> <b>noise</b> reduction process improves the output quality and pitch estimation efficiency. Though the proposed system works well even when <b>background</b> <b>noise</b> exists as shown in Tables 2 and 3, we recommend to remove the <b>background</b> <b>noise</b> before the LTP analysis and the transient noise reduction process.|$|R
5000|$|An electron-multiplying CCD (EMCCD, {{also known}} as an L3Vision CCD, a product commercialized by e2v Ltd., GB, L3CCD or Impactron CCD, a now-discontinued product offered in the past by Texas Instruments) is a {{charge-coupled}} device in which a gain register is placed between the shift register and the output amplifier. The gain register is split up into {{a large number of}} stages. In each stage, the electrons are multiplied by impact ionization in a similar way to an avalanche diode. The gain probability at every stage of the register is small (P < 2%), but as the number of elements is large (N > 500), the overall gain can be very high (...) , with single input electrons giving many thousands of output electrons. Reading a signal from a CCD gives a <b>noise</b> <b>background,</b> typically a few electrons. In an EMCCD, this noise is superimposed on many thousands of electrons rather than a single electron; the devices' primary advantage is thus their negligible readout noise. It is to be noted that the use of avalanche breakdown for amplification of photo charges had already been described in the [...] in 1973 by George E. Smith/Bell Telephone Laboratories.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{discusses}} {{the problem of}} automatic word boundary detection {{in the presence of}} variable-level <b>background</b> <b>noise</b> in cars. Commonly used robust word boundary detection algorithms always assume that the <b>background</b> <b>noise</b> level is fixed and sets fixed thresholds to find the boundary of word signal. In fact, the <b>background</b> <b>noise</b> level in cars varies in the procedure of recording due to speed change and moving environment, and some thresholds should be tuned according to the variation of <b>background</b> <b>noise</b> level. This is the major reason that most robust word boundary detection algorithms cannot work well in the condition of variable <b>background</b> <b>noise</b> level. To solve this problem, we propose a minimum mel-scale frequency band (MiMSB) parameter which can estimate the varying <b>background</b> <b>noise</b> level in cars by adaptively choosing one band with minimum energy from the mel-scale frequency bank.

40|$|<b>Background</b> <b>noise</b> is the {{irregular}} variation across repeated measurements of human performance. <b>Background</b> <b>noise</b> remains after task and treatment effects are minimized. <b>Background</b> <b>noise</b> refers to intrinsic sources of variability, the intrinsic dynamics {{of mind and}} body, and the internal workings of a living being. Two experiments demonstrate 1 /f scaling (pink noise) in simple reaction times and speeded word naming times, which round out a catalog of laboratory task demonstrations that <b>background</b> <b>noise</b> is pink noise. Ubiquitous pink noise suggests processes of mind and body that change each other’s dynamics. Such interaction-dominant dynamics are found in systems that self-organize their behavior. Self-organization provides an unconventional perspective on cognition, but this perspective closely parallels a contemporary interdisciplinary view of living systems.
