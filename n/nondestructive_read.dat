40|$|An {{alternative}} to the single floating gate on a standard EEPROM device could be a continuous semi insulating layer in which the distribution of charge can be controlled. By partial oxidation of porous silicon, a new material named Oxide Passivated Nanocrystalline Silicon (OPNSi) is formed, which has embedded Si nanocrystals in a porous glass structure. With oxide barriers between silicon nanocrystals, carriers can be confined to the silicon crystallites or trapped at interface states {{on the surface of}} these nanocrystals. With the assistance of an electric field, carriers can undergo direct tunneling through the very thin barriers and alter the charge distribution within the OPNSi layer. The placement of charge within the layer will determine the field-effect on the underlying silicon substrate. A <b>nondestructive</b> <b>read</b> would take place at low control-gate bias, and possibly result in faster write/erase cycles compared to traditional EEPROM. Another fundamental limitation of today’s flash EEPROM is that each memory cell requires a pass-gate and a 3 -terminal transistor structure, which limits the size of each cell. The OPNSi Diode will also be investigated as a possible candidate for a 2 -terminal X point array memory device...|$|E
40|$|Cosmic {{rays are}} a known problem in astronomy, causing both loss {{of data and}} data inaccuracy. The problem becomes even more extreme when {{considering}} data from a high-radiation environment, such as in orbit around Earth or outside the Earth's magnetic field altogether, unprotected, as {{will be the case}} for the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). For JWST, all the instruments employ nondestructive readout schemes. The most common of these will be "up the ramp" sampling, where the detector is read out regularly during the ramp. We study three methods to correct for cosmic rays in these ramps: a two-point difference method, a deviation from the fit method, and a y-intercept method. We apply these methods to simulated <b>nondestructive</b> <b>read</b> ramps with single-sample groups and varying combinations of flux, number of samples, number of cosmic rays, cosmic-ray location in the exposure, and cosmic-ray strength. We show that the y-intercept method is the optimal detection method in the read-noise-dominated regime, while both the y-intercept method and the two-point difference method are best in the photon-noise-dominated regime, with the latter requiring fewer computations.

40|$|The {{results of}} a number of {{theoretical}} and experimental studies relating to multiple hologram recording in lithium niobate are reported. The analysis of holographic gratings stored in lithium niobate has been extended to cover a more realistic range of physical situations. A new successful dynamic (feedback) theory for describing recording, <b>nondestructive</b> <b>reading,</b> erasure, enhancement, and angular sensitivity has been developed. In addition, the possible architectures of mass data storage systems have been studied...|$|R
40|$|A {{principle}} of organic memory device using a bistable photochromic molecule is presented that allows extremely high bit densities and very low power consumption. This device {{is based on}} an isomerization reaction of photochromic diarylethene molecule via its excited state by an electric carrier injection, not by photon absorption. Experimental data show that the reversible writing and <b>nondestructive</b> <b>reading</b> of information by the carrier injection is feasible. The advantages and properties of such an organic semiconductor memory using a bistable molecule are discussed...|$|R
40|$|We present here an {{experiment}} of optical information storage of bacteriorhodopsin (BR) polymer film made from variant M 1 B. A recording system of three-wavelength {{has been set}} up in the experiment. The photoexcited P(490) state shows a permanent storage property confirmed by our contrast ratio experiments. It is found out that the readout contrast ratio is very sensitive to the intensity and wavelength of probe beam and the recorded data can be readout from 530 - 630 nm with different contrast ratio. Within the range 570 - 600 nm, a better contrast ratio can be obtained. Considering the erasing effect for the reason of absorption of P state, by using 594 nm as the readout wavelength both higher contrast ratio and <b>nondestructive</b> <b>reading</b> can be realized.

40|$|Molecular {{logic gates}} process {{physical}} or chemical "inputs" to generate "outputs" {{based on a}} set of logical operators. We report the design and operation of a chemical ensemble in solution that behaves as integrated AND, OR, and XNOR gates with optical input and output signals. The ensemble is composed of a reversible merocyanine-type photoacid and a ruthenium polypyridine complex that functions as a pH-controlled three-state luminescent switch. The light-triggered release of protons from the photoacid is used to control the state of the transition-metal complex. Therefore, the two molecular switching devices communicate with one another through the exchange of ionic signals. By means of such a double (optical-chemical-optical) signal-transduction mechanism, inputs of violet light modulate a luminescence output in the red/far-red region of the visible spectrum. <b>Nondestructive</b> <b>reading</b> is guaranteed because the green light used for excitation in the photoluminescence experiments does not affect the state of the gate. The reset is thermally driven and, thus, does not involve the addition of chemicals and accumulation of byproducts. Owing to its reversibility and stability, this molecular device can afford many cycles of digital operation...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. We derive general {{equations}} for nonlinearity corrections and statistical uncertainty (variance) estimates for data acquired with near-infrared detectors employing correlated double sampling, multiple correlated double sampling (Fowler sampling), and uniformly spaced continuous readout techniques. We compare our equation for the variance on each pixel associated with Fowler sampling with data {{taken with the}} array installed in the near-infrared cross-dispersed spectrograph (SpeX) at the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility and find that it provides an accurate representation of the empirical results. This comparison also reveals that the read noise associated with a single readout of the SpeX array increases {{with the number of}} <b>nondestructive</b> <b>reads,</b> nr, as 0. 16 � 0. 34 nr. This implies that the effective read noise of a stored image decreases as nr, shallower than the expected � 0. 5 rate of nr. The cause of this read noise behavior is uncertain but it may be due to heating of the array {{as a result of the}} multiple readouts. Such behavior may be generic to arrays that employ correlated or multiple correlated double sampling readouts. 1...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{an investigation into}} a novel group of GaAs charge storage devices. These devices, which are an integration of bipolar and {{junction field effect transistor}} structures were conceived, designed, fabricated, and tested within this study. The purpose was to analyse new types of charge storage devices, which are suitable for fabrication and lead to the development of dynamic and nonvolatile memories in III-V compound semiconductors. Currently, III-V semiconductor storage devices consist only of capacitors, where data is destroyed during reading and electrical erasure is difficult. In this work, four devices types were demonstrated that exhibit <b>nondestructive</b> <b>reading,</b> and three of the prototypes can be electrically erased. All types use the junction field effect transistor (JFET) for charge sensing, with each having different bipolar or epitaxial layer structure controlling the junction gate. The bottom epitaxial layer in each case served as the JFET channel. Two of the device types have three alternately doped layers, while the remaining two have four alternately doped layers. In all cases, removal of majority carriers from the middle layers constitutes stored charge. The missing carriers deplete the current carrying a region of the JFET channel. Drain current of the JFET becomes an indicator of stored charge. The basic function of each JFET memory element type is independent of interchanging n- and p- type doping within the structure type. Some performance advantage can be realized, however, by sensing with an n-type channel as compared to p- type due to increased carrier mobility. All device types exhibit storage time characteristics of order ten seconds. Devices are constructed in epitaxial layers grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) reactors. The design of the epitaxial layers is an intrinsic part, together with the electrical design, of the storage device concept. These concepts are implemented first with photolithography masks which are used in device fabrication. The fabrication methods employ wet chemical etching and ohmic metal liftoff techniques. Electrical dc and charge retention time characteristics along with functionality read/write operations for the memory element group are measured using commercial electronic test equipment...|$|R
40|$|Multiferroism implies {{simultaneous}} {{presence of}} more than one ferroic characteristics such as coexistence of ferroelectric and magnetic ordering. This phenomenon has {{led to the development of}} various kinds of materials and conceptions of many novel applications such as development of a memory device utilizing the multifunctionality of the multiferroic materials leading to a multistate memory device with electrical writing and <b>nondestructive</b> magnetic <b>reading</b> operations. Though, interdependence of electrical- and magnetic-order parameters makes it difficult to accomplish the above and thus rendering the device to only two switchable states, recent research has shown that such problems can be circumvented by novel device designs such as formation of tunnel junction or by use of exchange bias. In this paper, we review the operational aspects of multiferroic memories as well as the materials used for these applications along with the designs that hold promise for the future memory devices...|$|R
