5|$|At {{about the}} same time, Winnie Johnson sent Hindley another letter, again {{pleading}} with her to assist the police in finding the body of her son Keith. In the letter, Johnson was sympathetic to Hindley over the criticism surrounding her first visit. Hindley, who had not replied to the first letter, responded by thanking Johnson for both letters, explaining that her decision not to reply to the first resulted from the negative publicity that surrounded it. She claimed that, had Johnson written to her 14years earlier, she would have confessed and helped the police. She also paid tribute to Topping, and thanked Johnson for her sincerity. Hindley made her second visit to the moor in March 1987. This time, the level of security surrounding her visit was considerably higher. She stayed overnight in Manchester, at the flat of the police chief in charge of GMP training at Sedgley Park, Prestwich, and visited the moor twice. She confirmed to police that the two areas {{in which they were}} concentrating their search—Hollin Brown Knoll and Hoe Grain—were correct, although she was unable to locate either of the graves. She later remembered that as Pauline Reade was being buried she had been sitting <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>on</b> a patch of grass and could see the rocks of Hollin Brown Knoll silhouetted against the night sky.|$|E

25|$|Light has an {{associated}} frequency, and this frequency {{may be used}} to drive the workings of a clock. The gravitational redshift leads to an important conclusion about time itself: Gravity makes time run slower. Suppose we build two identical clocks whose rates are controlled by some stable atomic transition. Place one clock on top of the tower, while the other clock remains on the ground. An experimenter on top of the tower observes that signals from the ground clock are lower in frequency than those of the clock <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>on</b> the tower. Light going up the tower is a just a wave, and it is impossible for wave crests to disappear on the way up. Exactly as many oscillations of light arrive {{at the top of the}} tower as were emitted at the bottom. The experimenter concludes that the ground clock is running slow, and can confirm this by bringing the tower clock down to compare side-by-side with the ground clock. For a 1km tower, the discrepancy would amount to about 9.4nanoseconds per day, easily measurable with modern instrumentation.|$|E

500|$|Wendy {{learns that}} her sister Julie {{and a friend}} had also been on the roller coaster but got off {{following}} her vision, and rushes to the county fair to save them. She and Kevin prevent Julie from being impaled on a harrow while being dragged by a panicked horse, and Wendy asks Julie who was sitting <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>on</b> the roller coaster, since they are next on Death's list. Her question is quickly answered when Julie's friend, Perry Malinowski, is impaled by a flagpole launched by a rope tied to the horse. Wendy saves Kevin from an exploding propane canister and is confronted by a deranged Ian, who blames her for Erin's death and is determined to ensure that she will not survive from her impending demise. Fireworks go off and nearly hit Wendy, but she dodges and they strike a nearby elevating work platform instead. Ian shouts that Death cannot kill him, and the platform collapses and crushes him.|$|E

2500|$|In February 2016, an Israeli {{woman named}} Renee Rabinowitz {{filed a lawsuit}} against El Al after being {{involved}} in an incident where an ultra-Orthodox man refused to sit <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>on</b> a flight from Newark International Airport to Tel Aviv and the flight attendants asked her to move seats. By her own admission though, she was happy to oblige after talking to her seatmate. [...] She was however upset that [...] "The flight attendant treated me as if I was stupid”. El Al has insisted that there was no gender discrimination on El Al flights, that the flight attendant had made it clear to Ms. Rabinowitz that she was in no way obligated to move. [...] Much as with any seating issue on flights, including overweight or disabled passengers, the airline always tries to find amicable solutions.|$|E

2500|$|Homer and Bart {{participate}} at an [...] "Ugliest Dog" [...] {{contest in}} Springfield" [...] contest, entering Santa's Little Helper. At the contest, Moe feels neglected because {{nobody wants to}} let him sit next to them (Agnes Skinner even sets the chair <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>on</b> fire). Moe sits on the ground until he notices that the judge, Krusty the Clown, is not managing to entertain the crowd due to his lack of enthusiasm over his work. He taunts and insults Krusty for his inability to be funny, despite being a clown. Angry, Krusty leaves and offers his job to Moe, much {{to the delight of}} the crowd, who then urges him to replace Krusty, and to which Moe agrees as he now has a place to sit. During the competition, Moe makes sardonic, offensive but undoubtedly funny comments about all the ugly dogs, but chooses the Simpsons' dog (under the alias of Satan's Little Helper) was the winner because the Simpsons disguised their dog's buttocks as if it were his face, leaving Santa's Little Helper upset over his appearance until Lisa comforts him later. After that, Moe becomes the judge of most Springfield competitions (including a bully competition at the beach) and is offered a job as one of jurors of American Idol, since that several other programs with the opportunity of this kind of job were suddenly cancelled.|$|E
60|$|Dick {{was sitting}} <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>on</b> the right side, {{and on the}} side of the table {{opposite}} to her father. Fancy had laid her right hand lightly down upon the table-cloth for an instant, and to her alarm Dick, after dropping his fork and brushing his forehead as a reason, flung down his own left hand, overlapping a third of Fancy's with it, and keeping it there. So the innocent Fancy, instead of pulling her hand from the trap, settled her eyes on her father's, to guard against his discovery of this perilous game of Dick's. Dick finished his mouthful; Fancy finished her crumb, and nothing was done beyond watching Geoffrey's eyes. Then the hands slid apart; Fancy's going over six inches of cloth, Dick's over one. Geoffrey's eye had risen.|$|E
60|$|Frank {{seemed to}} be much less at his ease. He {{attempted}} to chat easily with the countess, and to listen pleasantly to the would-be witticisms of the earl; {{but he was not}} comfortable, he did not amalgamate well with the family; had there been a larger party, he could have talked all dinner-time to his love; but, as it was, he hardly spoke a word to her during the ceremony, and indeed, but few during the evening. He did sit <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>on</b> the sofa, to be sure, and watched the lace she was working; but he could not talk unreservedly to her, when old Lady Cashel was sitting close to him on the other side, and Lady Selina on a chair immediately opposite. And then, it is impossible to talk to one's mistress, in an ordinary voice, on ordinary subjects, when one has not seen her for some months. A lover is never so badly off as in a family party: a tête-à-tête, or a large assembly, are what suit him best: he is equally at his ease in either; but he is completely out of his element in a family party. After all, Lady Cashel was right; it would have been much better to have asked the O'Joscelyns.|$|E
