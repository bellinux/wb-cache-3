The disclosure practices currently being used in South Africa were evaluated to determine to what extent financial statements comply with the relevant standard of accounting practice. The objective of translation used as basis for the problem of foreign currency translation is compatible with the concept of economic decision-making usefulness. The acceptance of an objective of translation is a prerequisite for a specific methcx 1 of translation. The temporal method and the closing rate method are both, depending on the specific circumstances, conceptually accounted for. There are material differences between the approach suggested by Jean Miller and current international practice. All translation differences are, according to this approach, accounted for in the inccme statement. Miller's approach has certain advantages and should be supplied to the business sector for commentary. There are no material differences between the standards of the Accounting Practice Board, the Financial Accounting standards Board, the International Accounting standards Camzi. ttee and the Accounting standards Camzi. ttee when it comes to the translation of the financial statements of foreign operations. Against this backgrexmd, the financial statements of selected ccmpani. es were evaluated for ccmpliance wi th statement RE 112 and exposure draft 83. The evaluation indicated that the closing rate method 1 is being used by the majority of companies. Translation differences are directly accounted for against <b>non-distributable</b> <b>reserves.</b> The assumption is that the business sector would not support: Miller's approach, due to the fact that all translation differences are exempted for in the income statement...|$|E
40|$|M. B. A. A {{share buyback}} scheme is a {{situation}} where a company buys back its shares from shareholders and then cancels them or creates treasury shares. The Companies Act, 1973 (Act 61 of 1973), previously limited the {{reduction in the number of}} shares to preference shares which could only be redeemed by a transfer of the equal amount to the capital redemption <b>reserve</b> fund, a <b>non-distributable</b> <b>reserve</b> in order to maintain the capital levels. Section 85 of the Companies Act now allows a company to buy back its ordinary shares and cancel them without replacing them with a capital redemption reserve fund. The only requirement is that the company must prove that they will be liquid and solvent after undertaking such a share buyback. This has far-reaching consequences for the creditors who rely on the capital maintenance rule as the only protection afforded to them should the company go bankrupt. The reduction in the number of shares after the share buyback also creates problems. Firstly, the company's operating capabilities can be reduced, damaging the remaining and future shareholders and secondly, the company's earnings per share (EPS) can improve without any improvement in the actual performance. This tends to make the Annual Financial Statements (AFS) unreliable as the users still rely on the EPS for an indication of whether the company is growing or not. Companies use a share buyback for various other reasons, the most important of which being that they want to distribute excess cash back to shareholders. Some of these companies, however, go back to the lending houses to borrow money to finance their current operations immediately after the share buyback. It is imperative to investigate the real reason why companies undertake a share buyback and what effect this has on the profitability and the earnings per share of listed companies in South Africa...|$|R
