25|$|Surgical {{consultation}} — The {{plastic surgeon}} explains {{the technical and}} aesthetic considerations of the breast lift operation to the woman. That the B technique mastopexy yields improved aesthetic results with a breast-skin pedicle created with a curvilinear incision (an inverted, upper-case letter-B). That said curvilinear incision technique eliminates the medial vertical incision of the Anchor mastopexy, and so creates a lifted bust with breasts of <b>natural</b> <b>size,</b> appearance, and contour, and few surgical scars. The consultation includes detailed, pre-operative, post-operative, and healing-stage photographs that illustrate {{the nature and extent}} of the mastopexy incisions and the resultant scars. That the full healing (scar maturation) might require approximately one year to establish the final contour of the lifted breasts, after the suspensory ligaments and the parenchymal tissue have settled into and upon the chest as an aesthetically satisfactory bust of <b>natural</b> <b>size,</b> appearance, and contour.|$|E
25|$|I {{have removed}} the skin {{from a man}} who was so shrunk by illness that the muscles were worn down and {{remained}} in a state like thin membrane, {{in such a way that}} the sinews instead of merging in muscles ended in wide membrane; and where the bones were covered by the skin they had very little over their <b>natural</b> <b>size.</b>|$|E
25|$|Reduction mammoplasty, {{surgery or}} lipectomy, is the {{technically}} reliable method for diminishing {{the size and}} volume of the enlarged breast. The traditional, surgical techniques for breast reduction remodel the breast mound using a skin and glandular (breast tissue) pedicle (inferior, superior, central), and then trim and re-drape the skin envelope into a new breast of <b>natural</b> <b>size,</b> shape, and contour; yet it produces long surgical scars upon the breast hemisphere. In response, L. Benelli, in 1990, presented the round block mammoplasty, a minimal-scar periareolar incision technique that produces only a periareolar scar — around the nipple-areola complex (NAC), where the dark-to-light skin-color transition hides the surgical scar.|$|E

25|$|The {{documentary}} {{evidence for the}} construction of ancient galleys is fragmentary, particularly in pre-Roman times. Plans and schematics in the modern sense did not exist until the 17th century and nothing like them has survived from ancient times. How galleys were constructed has therefore been a matter of looking at circumstantial evidence in literature, art, coinage and monuments that include ships, some of them actually in <b>natural</b> <b>size.</b> Since the war galleys floated even with a ruptured hull and virtually never had any ballast or heavy cargo that could sink them, not a single wreckage of one has so far been found. The only exception has been a partial wreckage of a small Punic liburnian from the Roman era, the Marsala Ship.|$|E
25|$|The {{subjects}} of the statues were to be mutually agreed upon with Adolph Scherrer, architect of the Indiana State House. Doyle created half <b>natural</b> <b>size</b> plaster models of the proposed sculptures, and sent photographs {{of them to the}} Board of Commissions in early August 1887. On August 17, 1887, a contract for the sculptures was prepared and sent to Doyle. The contract stipulated that the Board of Commissions had the right to “alter, modify, or change” the {{subjects of}} the models, and that work on the pieces would not begin until they had approved the designs. Between August 18 and 19, 1887, the Board of Commissions accepted the proposed designs based on the plaster models, and Doyle was authorized to begin work on the sculptures.|$|E
25|$|In realizing {{a breast}} lift, a {{conservative}} surgical technique produces the fewest, least visible scars after excising (cutting) excess folds of {{skin from the}} skin-envelope, when either replacing or rearranging or augmenting the internal breast tissues (parenchymal and adipose). Breast lift techniques are known according {{to the number of}} scars produced, which is related to the achievable degree of breast-lift. Pre-operatively, the patient and the surgeon decide upon the appropriate surgical technique (superior, medial, or inferior pedicle) that will achieve the best degree of breast lift. Generally, breast ptosis (sagging) is determined by the locale of the nipple-areola complex upon the breast; the lower the nipple-areola complex, the greater the degree of breast prolapsation (ptosis). Nonetheless, in breast-lift surgery, the primary consideration is the tissue viability of the nipple-areola complex, so that the outcome is a functionally sensate breast of <b>natural</b> <b>size,</b> contour, and feel.|$|E

25|$|Mastopexic {{correction}} {{results in}} surgical scars on the lifted breasts; the periareolar mastopexy outcome often is a breast of bottom-heavy appearance, with puckered surgical scars; and the Anchor mastopexy outcome is an aesthetic breast of <b>natural</b> <b>size,</b> look, and feel, but with many scars. Whereas, {{advocates of the}} mechanical principle of the B technique mastopexy propose {{that the creation of}} a rotational pedicle (with an elevated epidermal flap that rotates around the nipple-areola complex), lifts the breasts with an incision plan with vertical and horizontal incisions that eliminate the medial incision (and its vertical scar), whilst providing good projection of the corrected bust from the chest, and a viable nipple-areola complex. Furthermore, advocates of the B technique mastopexy report that it usually does not require secondary correction, because it allows for the better transposition of excess lateral tissues of the breasts by means of curvilinear incision (inverted, upper-case, letter-B) to the skin envelope.|$|E

2500|$|In {{cutting the}} folds of excess skin from the sagging, inelastic skin-envelope of the breast (and {{occasionally}} reducing the nipple-areola complex diameter), the three-incision technique of the Anchor mastopexy allows maximal corrections to the breasts, thereby producing an elevated bust with breasts of <b>natural</b> <b>size,</b> look, and feel. Moreover, {{each of the three}} scars to the breast hemisphere produced by the Anchor-pattern mastopexy has a characteristic healing pattern: ...|$|E

Being an admirer of Auguste Rodin and Michelangelo’s sculptures, {{as well as a}} tireless reader of Cervantes’s novels, Cayetano Hilario expresses part of his artistic inspiration by materializing the main characters of Cervantes’ book into “realistic” personages in <b>natural</b> <b>sizes.</b> In order to do so, he used the people around him basically his family and native friends as models.|$|R

2500|$|I made a {{whole series}} of studies to prepare this portrait. Drawings and washes in china ink. I {{analysed}} the architecture of the head in monumentally sized enlargements, two or three times the <b>natural</b> <b>size,</b> I made a certain number of drawings of the hands, I studied the organisation and the overall effect, volumes and the relations of the formal elements between themselves. Finally, I reduced the colour to a harmony of blacks and greys supported by some flashes of light red which set up a contrast, at once breaking with and supporting the interplay of harmonious colour relations. Nayral came regularly to the studio, I worked directly on him, naturally, {{but more often than not}} the work consisted in friendly conversation, in walks in the garden, during which I studied him, watching what was his natural way of walking and what were his usual gestures, above all arming my memory with essential characteristics, trying to isolate his true likeness from the accumulation of details and picturesque superfluities which always interfere with the permanent reality of a being. The portrait was executed without turning to the model, it was finished some weeks before the Automne and I decided to show it... if the jury would be willing to accept it, as I was not yet a member.

50|$|After 1662, Gijsbrechts {{abandoned}} the pure vanitas still life paintings {{to allow the}} vanitas motifs to enter into more complex trompe l’oeil compositions as partial elements, e.g. in the so-called studio walls, letter racks (the notice boards of the era), board walls with hunting implements and musical instruments, and “chantournés” (cut-outs).

The Spanish authorities bear part in this traffic, by receiving a bribe from every individual passing the Lines, their persons and their purposes being thoroughly known to them. Some of these people take hardware goods, as well as cotton and tobacco, into Spain.|$|R
