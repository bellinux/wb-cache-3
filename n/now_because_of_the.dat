25|$|Where {{herbicides}} {{cannot be}} used, mowing may be repeated about every three weeks, as it grows back rapidly. In the past, ragweed was usually cut down, left to dry, and then burned. This method is used less often <b>now,</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pollution caused by smoke. Manually uprooting ragweed is generally ineffective, and skin contact can cause allergic reaction. If uprooting is {{the method of}} choice, it should be performed before flowering. There is evidence that mechanical and chemical control methods are actually no more effective {{in the long run}} than leaving the weed in place.|$|E
25|$|They used {{spider silk}} fibers {{to create a}} nerve conduit with Schwann cells and acellularized xenogenic veins. The Schwann cells formed columns along the silk fibers in {{a short amount of}} time, and the columns were similar to bands of Bungner that grow in vivo after PNS injury. Spider silk has not been used in tissue {{engineering}} until <b>now</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> predatory nature of spiders and the low yield of silk from individual spiders. It has been discovered that the species Nephila clavipes produces silk that is less immunogenic than silkworm silk; it has a tensile strength of 4 x 109 N/m, which is six times the breaking strength of steel. Because spider silk is proteolytically degraded, there is not a shift in pH from the physiological pH during degradation. Other advantages of spider silk include its resistance to fungal and bacterial decomposition for weeks {{and the fact that it}} does not swell. Also, the silk's structure promotes cell adhesion and migration. However, silk harvest is still a tedious task and the exact composition varies among species and even among individuals of the same species depending on diet and environment. There have been attempts to synthetically manufacture spider silk. Further studies are needed to test the feasibility of using a spider silk nerve conduit in vitro and in vivo.|$|E

500|$|The first truly native Neolithic {{culture was}} the Funnelbeaker culture, {{named after the}} shape of their typical clay vessels. It {{developed}} starting around 4400 BCE and lasted some two thousand years. Like other post-Mesolithic cultures, the Funnelbeaker culture was Megalithic. They built tombs of large stones, some of them huge (for example trapezoidal structures up to 150 meters long) and resembling pyramids. Few survived until <b>now</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> demand for stone as building material, but a well-preserved one from {{the first half of}} 4th millennium BC was found in Wietrzychowice near Włocławek. From this place and period came the skull, on which the trepanation procedure was performed for medical or magic reasons. Timewise the beginnings of the post-Mesolithic cultures in Poland coincide with the beginnings of the Eneolithic period in the Balkans. Copper objects, mostly ornamental or luxurious items, were traded and then developed locally, first by the Danubian and then by the indigenous people. Copper metallurgy facilities were identified in Złota near Sandomierz. Clay decorative objects include realistic representations of animals and containers with images engraved on them. A pot from Bronocice, Pińczów County (3400 BCE) has a unique narrative scene and the world's oldest semblance of a four-wheeled cart drawn on its surface. Stone tools became most highly developed and acquired their then characteristic smooth surfaces. Well preserved settlements with rectangular buildings were unearthed in Gródek Nadbużny near Hrubieszów (where remnants of a vertical loom for weaving were found), in Niedźwiedź near Kraków, and in northern Poland in Barłożno, Starogard Gdański County, where the structures are similar to the ones in Niedźwiedź. In Barłożno three post supported houses were discovered, the largest of which had the main part 16 meters long and 6.5 meters wide. As dated from the ceramics found, they represent the developed, [...] "Wiórecka" [...] phase of the Funnelbeaker culture.|$|E

By and large, {{he simply}} grafted the prevailing decentralized administration system, which barely worked for petty states like his native Toungoo, to the largest polity ever in the region. Indeed, it did not work for mid-size kingdoms like Ava, Hanthawaddy, Lan Na, and Siam. (Ava had always {{had to contend with}} Prome and Toungoo; Pegu with Martaban and Bassein; Chiang Mai with Chiang Saen and Nan; Ayutthaya with Phitsanulok; etc.) <b>Now,</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sheer size of the empire, the system was even more decentralized and stretched thinner still.

2500|$|The Toungoo Empire was “in {{theory and}} fact, a poly-ethnic {{political}} formation.” The Toungoo kings largely employed then prevailing Southeast Asian administrative model of solar polities {{in which the}} high king ruled the core while semi-independent tributaries, autonomous viceroys, and governors actually controlled day-to-day administration and manpower.

2500|$|The Bradshaw {{paintings}} predominantly depict human silhouette {{figures that}} appear to be suspended in the air or in a dynamic style that suggests running, hunting or dancing. While gender is rarely portrayed in the paintings, limb, arm and shoulder muscles are often well defined in addition to stomach paunches. The question of gender representation in Bradshaw art was illuminated recently by the discovery that figures are depicted as if they are facing into the rock face. This perspective has been overlooked until <b>now</b> <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Western bias toward images that “face out”, but also because the “facing in” perspective is more evident in depictions with excellent delineation of body contours, such as the rare, Classic Realistic style, which is also earliest in superposition studies;|). If one appreciates the “facing in” perspective, it becomes evident that the many attributions of “paunches’ by [...] are incorrect, both because they can now be seen to be located at the rear of these figures, but also because it is anatomically incorrect to attribute the belly to gluteal structures located more inferiorly. Furthermore, the figures are ornamented with a diversity of objects such as belts, headdresses, bags and tassels, while other material culture is sometimes depicted, such as boomerangs and wands. While Bradshaw initially described the colour of the art as having shades of pale blue and yellow, most figures have a deep purple-red hue, mulberry colour or a red to yellow-brown colour. However, Donaldson notes that there are rare examples of multi-coloured figures that retain some yellow and white pigment. The height of the art is variable; most are between 40 and 50cm in length with some examples up to 2 metres in height.|$|E
