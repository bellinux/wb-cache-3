5|$|Aligned ZnO <b>nanowires</b> on pre-seeded silicon, glass, and {{gallium nitride}} {{substrates}} have been grown using aqueous zinc salts such as zinc nitrate and zinc acetate in basic environments. Pre-seeding substrates with ZnO creates sites for homogeneous nucleation of ZnO crystal during the synthesis. Common pre-seeding methods include in-situ thermal decomposition of zinc acetate crystallites, spincoating of ZnO nanoparticles {{and the use}} of physical vapor deposition methods to deposit ZnO thin films. Pre-seeding can be performed in conjunction with top down patterning methods such as electron beam lithography and nanosphere lithography to designate nucleation sites prior to growth. Aligned ZnO <b>nanowires</b> can be used in dye-sensitized solar cells and field emission devices.|$|E
5|$|Nanostructures of ZnO can be {{synthesized}} into {{a variety}} of morphologies including <b>nanowires,</b> nanorods, tetrapods, nanobelts, nanoflowers, nanoparticles etc. Nanostructures can be obtained with most above-mentioned techniques, at certain conditions, and also with the vapor-liquid-solid method. The synthesis is typically carried out at temperatures of about 90°C, in an equimolar aqueous solution of zinc nitrate and hexamine, the latter providing the basic environment. Certain additives, such as polyethylene glycol or polyethylenimine, can improve the aspect ratio of the ZnO <b>nanowires.</b> Doping of the ZnO <b>nanowires</b> has been achieved by adding other metal nitrates to the growth solution. The morphology of the resulting nanostructures can be tuned by changing the parameters relating to the precursor composition (such as the zinc concentration and pH) or to the thermal treatment (such as the temperature and heating rate).|$|E
5|$|In 2008 the Center for Nanostructure Characterization at the Georgia Institute of Technology {{reported}} {{producing an}} electricity generating device (called flexible charge pump generator) delivering alternating current by stretching and releasing zinc oxide <b>nanowires.</b> This mini-generator creates an oscillating voltage up to 45 millivolts, converting close to {{seven percent of}} the applied mechanical energy into electricity.

30|$|The {{resistances}} of Si <b>nanowire,</b> Ni-silicide nanocrystal-modified Si <b>nanowire,</b> and Ni-silicide/Si multi-stacked heterostructure <b>nanowire</b> at 250  °C in vacuum were 2 [*]×[*] 1010, 2.5 [*]×[*] 1010, and 3.3 [*]×[*] 109  Ω, respectively. The resistances of the Ni-silicide nanocrystal-modified Si <b>nanowire</b> and Ni-silicide multi-stacked heterostructure <b>nanowire</b> were {{a little}} higher and much {{lower than that of}} the Si <b>nanowire,</b> for the following reason. Since the Ni-silicide grew into Si <b>nanowire,</b> two factors affect the resistance of that <b>nanowire.</b> One is the formation of Ni-silicide/Si interface with a Schottky characteristic, which can increase the resistance of <b>nanowire.</b> Furthermore, the formation of the nanoscopic depletion region in the Schottky junction reduces the cross-sectional area for carrier transmission in the Si region, increasing the resistance of <b>nanowire.</b> The other factor is that <b>nanowire</b> contains a low resistance Ni-silicide phase. Since the resistivity of Ni-silicide is much lower than that of Si, according to the resistivity-mixture rule, the resistance of the <b>nanowire</b> can be reduced. Thus, in the Ni-silicide nanocrystal-modified Si <b>nanowire,</b> the former factor has a greater effect on the resistance of <b>nanowire</b> than the latter factor. However, the amount of the Ni-silicide phase in the multi-stacked heterostructure <b>nanowire</b> is much more than that in the Ni-silicide nanocrystal-modified Si <b>nanowire.</b> The latter factor dominates.|$|R

However, the shear strains in the zincblende and wurtzite <b>nanowire</b> heterostructures can be very different. All the studied <b>nanowire</b> heterostructures are found to exhibit a piezoelectric field along the <b>nanowire</b> axis.

One of the major advantages to apply <b>nanowire</b> arrays and superlattice <b>nanowire</b> arrays as optic and optoelectronic devices is that the optical response of the array structures can be tuned and modulated via varying sample parameters such as the diameter of the wire and the pattern of the array structure. Due to potential applications of the <b>nanowire</b> arrays and superlattice <b>nanowire</b> arrays as optical devices, it is of importance and significance to examine their basic optical properties.
