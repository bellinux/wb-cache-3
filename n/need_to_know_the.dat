To figure out the distance of the landmark from the ship's position in the morning (C) is a matter of treating the distance BC as the calculated ritorno.

If a small addition of x, equal to ∆x, results in increasing y by ∆y, so that y = f(x) becomes y + ∆y = f(x+∆x), the value of dy/dx = 2x is f(x) = x² (proven after simplifying to y + ∆y), which means that a small a addition of x, ∆x, has reduced dy/dx.|$|E

In {{the first edition of}} this book, he considers genetic drift as important as natural selection. As an example, he argued that drift was the reason for racial variations that were observed in Partula, a land snail, so these variations had no adaptive advantage. He argued that most such variations, which he called microgeographic race, was nonadaptive.

Moments after Higgins enters the building, it explodes, killing Higgins. In the aftermath, Navarro returns Reed to Dixon's command. She tells him he can keep his recently earned promotion and work plainclothes, but is not to investigate Higgins' death, as Navarro wants the investigation to remain internal to OCU. Shortly thereafter, Reed is contacted by FBI Special Agent Gabriel Whitting (Christopher Walken), who informs him there is a mole in the OCU. Whitting believes Higgins was about to reveal the identity of the mole, which is why he was killed. Prior to his death, Higgins told Whitting to bring Reed into the investigation should anything happen. All Whitting knows about the mole is that they are in contact with four major crime organizations in Manhattan.|$|E

[...] For [...] "Maraindhirundhu" [...] she said, [...] "The nadaswaram and thavil back-ups for this song and the jathi-s give it its typical classical flavour. 'Thooyane mayavaa mayane velava ennai aalum Shanmuga vaa'– these lines represent the ideal confluence of raga, bhava and lyric, a perfect foil to each other." [...] Ashish Rajadhyaksha and Paul Willemen in their Encyclopedia of Indian Cinema, referred to [...] "Nalandhana" [...] as [...] " [...] major song hit".

[...] Following Viswanathan's death in July 2015, the news agency, Press Trust of India wrote that [...] "Ninaipadhellam" [...] was [...] "memorable for the deep sense of solace it offered to wounded hearts." [...] Anand Venkateswaran of The Wire noted, [...] "MSV’s style is less about making words sit in a meter than about a musical empathy with the meaning. Could anyone else have set to tune the first line of ‘Sonnadhu nee daana‘, of Nenjil Or Alayam (Muthuraman, 1962)?"

500|$|The soundtrack {{received}} {{positive response}} from critics; {{all the songs}} were successful, especially [...] "Engey Nimmadhi". Film historian Randor Guy stated, [...] "The movie has excellent music (Viswanathan-Ramamurthy; lyrics by Kannadasan) and many songs became hits— Paartha Gnaabakam Illayo...!, Unnai ondru ketpen (...) and Engey nimmathee (T. M. Soundararajan)." [...] Malathi Rangarajan of The Hindu said, [...] "Who can forget the everlasting flavour of MSV’s expertise that emanated through each and every number, beginning with ‘Unnai Ondru Kaetpaen’!" [...] Film critic Baradwaj Rangan called it a [...] "stylish musical bonanza". According to singer Charulatha Mani, [...] "Unnai Ondru Ketpen" [...] {{was based on the}} Harikambhoji raaga and further wrote, [...] "In the phrase, ‘Ennai Pada Sonnal’, the notes SRGR,S S,N set the mood for the raga." [...] whilst also calling the song a [...] "super-hit piece". Music director and singer Ramesh Vinayakam said [...] "Engey Nimmadhi" [...] was an example of [...] "the unconscious yet natural and healthy fusion that was happening to cinema music at the hands of music directors." [...] The Hindu included [...] "Engey Nimmadhi" [...] in its list, [...] "Immortal songs of TMS". P. K.

[...] She also wrote that given who their parents are, [...] "that can only mean trouble". Fenmore has dated Summer, to which Ehrich stated: [...] "Everything he does is for his love for Summer. He has this obsession with her. Every action he does stems from that." [...] In another interview, he stated of their relationship: [...] "I think Fen’s first love is Summer; he falls in love; he’s infatuated with her. She plays games with him, and where it’s going is – will Fen get into her ways, or will he stand his ground? Everything Fenmore does is coming from his love for Summer, so he’s still the same kid, it’s just sometimes love makes you do some crazy thing Fenmore later began to enter a rebellious phase." [...] Tracey Bregman (who portrays his mother Lauren) stated that she [...] "was always hoping they would show the dark side of our child, because both Lauren and Michael have dark sides. That is something they both work hard on to suppress, that comes out now and them." [...] Christian LeBlanc (who portrays his father Michael) stated Michael has [...] "troubled youth to deal with", saying: [...] "It’s the first time on Y that such a young storyline has pulled such focus. It’s going to be really fascinating. The whole family gets drawn in. The trouble with Fenmore affects Lauren and Michael. [...] rippling effect, like every good story." [...] The character was later involved in a cyberbullying storyline with Summer and Jamie Vernon (Daniel Polo). Michael Logan of TV Guide previewed the storyline, writing: [...] "Adding fuel to the fire is young Fen Baldwin (Max Ehrich), who is so infatuated with Summer that he becomes her partner in crime — in fact, he takes things a few dangerous steps further once he sees Summer's growing fondness for Jamie." [...] Ehrich liked the plot as he was bullied as a child, stating: [...] "Kids do it out of their own sadness or insecurity, but needless to say that doesn’t matter when you’re a victim of it - you feel so isolated and so alone. To have a storyline that addresses it, it’s like, [...] "This is real; this is what happens". People <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> truth {{of what is going on}} out there." ...|$|E
