The aim of this contribution is to evaluate possible ageing of PEO solution (polyethylen e oxide (M w = 300, 000 g/mol) dissolved in water at 10 wt. % concentration) based both on rheological characterization and on quality of electrospun fibres. Rheological measurements in steady shear and oscillatory modes were carried out using a rota tional rheometer MCR 501 (Anton Paar, Austria) equipped with the concentric cylinders geometry. The electrospinning measurements were executed {{with the help of a}} proposed laboratory device. The tip - to - collector distance attained 20 cm, applied voltage rang ed from 20 to 30 kV. The obtained electrospun fibres were analysed using a scanning electron microscope (VEGA 3, Tescan, Czech Republic). Both types of measurements were carried out in the period of several months during which the solution studied was plac ed in a dark and tempered box (25 °C).

Currently there are various methods such felting, stitching, use of binder/adhesive for joining the <b>non</b> <b>woven</b> meshes of PGA polymer in order to make suitable three dimensional scaffolds. The existing methods for joining the <b>non</b> <b>woven</b> meshes of PGA polymer are usually time consuming and not very flexible.
