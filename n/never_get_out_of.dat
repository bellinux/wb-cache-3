25|$|Earle is a vocal {{opponent}} of capital punishment, which he considers his primary area of political activism. Several {{of his songs}} have provided descriptions of the experiences of death row inmates. He is also pro-choice on abortion, and has argued that rich Americans have always had access to abortions, and that the political issue in the US is really whether poor women should have access. His novel I'll <b>Never</b> <b>Get</b> <b>Out</b> <b>of</b> This World Alive describes {{the life of a}} morphine-addicted doctor in San Antonio before Roe v. Wade who treats gunshot wounds and provides illegal abortions to poor women.|$|E

500|$|In June 1952, he {{recorded}} [...] "Jambalaya," [...] "Window Shopping," [...] "Settin' the Woods on Fire," [...] and [...] "I'll <b>Never</b> <b>Get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> this World Alive." [...] In early July, Audrey Williams divorced Hank. The next day {{he recorded}} [...] "You Win Again" [...] and [...] "I Won't be Home No More." [...] About this time he met Billie Jean Jones, a girlfriend of country singer Faron Young, at the Grand Ole Opry. As a girl, Billie had lived {{down the street from}} Hank when he was with the Louisiana Hayride, and now Hank began to visit her frequently in Shreveport, causing him to miss many Grand Ole Opry appearances.|$|E
500|$|In June 1952, Williams {{moved in}} with his mother, even as he {{released}} numerous hit songs, such as [...] "Half as Much" [...] in April, [...] "Jambalaya (On the Bayou)" [...] in July, [...] "Settin' the Woods on Fire"/"You Win Again" [...] in September, and [...] "I'll <b>Never</b> <b>Get</b> <b>Out</b> <b>of</b> This World Alive" [...] in November. His substance abuse problems continued to spiral out of control as he moved to Nashville and officially divorced his wife. A relationship with a woman named Bobbie Jett during this period resulted in a daughter, Jett Williams, who was born five days after Williams' death. His mother adopted Jett, who was made a ward {{of the state and}} then adopted by another couple after her grandmother died. Jett Williams did not learn that she was Hank Williams' daughter until the early 1980s.|$|E
500|$|His {{body was}} transported to Montgomery, Alabama, on Friday January 2 {{and placed in}} a silver coffin that was first shown at his mother's {{boarding}} house for two days. His funeral took place on Sunday January 4 at the Montgomery Auditorium, with his coffin placed on the flower-covered stage. [...] An estimated 15,000 to 25,000 people passed by the silver coffin, and the auditorium was filled with 2,750 mourners. His funeral was said to have been far larger than any ever held for any other citizen of Alabama and the largest event ever held in Montgomery. Williams' remains are interred at the Oakwood Annex in Montgomery. The president of MGM told Billboard magazine that the company got only about five requests for pictures of Williams during the weeks before his death, but over three hundred afterwards. The local record shops sold out of all of their records, and customers were asking for all records ever released by Williams. His final single, released in November 1952 while he was still alive, was ironically titled [...] "I'll <b>Never</b> <b>Get</b> <b>Out</b> <b>of</b> This World Alive". [...] "Your Cheatin' Heart" [...] was written and recorded in September 1952 but released in late January 1953 after Williams' death. The song, backed by [...] "Kaw-Liga," [...] was number one on the country charts for six weeks. It provided the title for the 1964 biographical film of the same name, which starred George Hamilton. [...] "Take These Chains From My Heart" [...] was released in April 1953 and went to #1 on the country charts. [...] "I Won't Be Home No More," [...] released in July, went to #3, and an overdubbed demo, [...] "Weary Blues From Waitin,'" [...] written with Ray Price, went to #7.|$|E

2500|$|During party purges, {{the secret}} police became so entrenched within the party that they became their own elite within the elite of the party. [...] State police {{organizations}} were vast. [...] The East German Stasi became the Soviet KGB's most important surrogate following Lenin's statement that [...] "the principal link {{in the chain of}} revolution is the German link, and the success of world revolution depends more on Germany than upon any other country." [...] In 1947, Stalin told Edvard Kardelj, then prime minister of Yugoslavia, [...] "We Russians will <b>never</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Germany." [...] The NKVD at first maintained a number of former Nazi concentration camps, such as Buchenwald and Sachsenhausen, to house former Nazis. [...] After the forced merger of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany thousands of anti-Nazi social democrats and communists that opposed the merger also ended up in those camps. Erich Mielke, a key operator for the Soviets after the war, built the Stasi into a vast secret police and espionage organization. Mielke became the longest serving state security chief in the Eastern bloc, and his relationship with the Soviet secret police dated back to 1931, when he had fled Germany for Moscow after murdering two Berlin policemen. [...] Although Mielke's Stasi was superficially granted independence in 1957, until 1990 the KGB continued to maintain liaison officers in all eight main Stasi directorates, each with his own office inside the Stasi's Berlin compound, and in each of the fifteen Stasi district headquarters around East Germany. [...] Collaboration was so close that the KGB invited the Stasi to establish operational bases in Moscow and Leningrad to monitor visiting East German tourists and Mielke referred to the Stasi officers as [...] "Chekists of the Soviet Union." [...] In 1978, Mielke formally granted KGB officers in East Germany the same rights and powers they enjoyed in the Soviet Union.|$|E

60|$|With the {{exception}} of a few fine freaks, such as Turveydrop and Chadband, all the figures in this book are touched more delicately, even more faintly, than is common with Dickens. But if the figures are touched more faintly, it is partly because they are figures in a fog--the fog of Chancery. Dickens meant that twilight to be oppressive; for it was the symbol of oppression. Deliberately he did not dispel the darkness at the end of this book, as he does dispel it at the end of most of his books. Pickwick <b>gets</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the Fleet Prison; Carstone <b>never</b> <b>gets</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Chancery but by death.
