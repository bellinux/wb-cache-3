In late February 2009, newly elected U.S. President Barack Obama announced an 18-month withdrawal window for combat forces, with approximately 50,000 soldiers remaining in the country. In November 2013 Obama met with Iraqi prime minister Nouri Maliki. He vowed a continuing partnership but {{said there would be}} <b>no</b> <b>public</b> <b>aid,</b> and urged to prime minister to be more inclusive, especially with regards to the Sunni population. Obama also encouraged wider political participation and passing an election law. They discussed how to curb a resurgent al-Qaeda and how to more thoroughly incorporate democracy in the country. President Obama changed the timeline of withdrawing troops from Iraq within 16 months of his taking office as outlined in the election to 19 months after taking office.|$|E

40|$|<b>Public</b> <b>aids</b> towards {{renewable}} energy sources in Spain have had the consequence of a great increase in their use. This is particularly true for the case of wind generation. For the year 2007, we show that the savings in social costs due to carbon emissions account for a figure between 25 % and 78 % of total aids. Since some of the <b>public</b> <b>aids</b> are just a money transfer with no effect on total social welfare the justification of the net costs of the aids is higher. For the particular case of wind generation, we find that in the worst case scenario 45 % of the social cost implied by the <b>public</b> <b>aids</b> is justified by the reduction in carbon emissions, and {{that the benefits of}} CO 2 reductions are 135 % higher than the costs in the best case scenario. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} Zweistufentheorie, a two-step theory {{developed}} in the doctrine of German public law. The theory {{is based on a}} thesis that in the event of <b>public</b> <b>aid</b> granted in a legal form of a civil law agreement a public administration law body is asked to establish whether such agreement has been concluded or renounced, a decision issued by this administrative body states a decision made under public law regulations and takes a legal form of an individual administrative act. The two-step theory emerged in German public law in the fi fties of the 20 th century and was a reaction of the German public law doctrine to the insuffi cient legal protec-tion of subjects seeking state-provided <b>public</b> <b>aid.</b> Before that theory was developed, <b>public</b> <b>aid</b> had been granted in the form of civil law agreements. This meant that such agreements were only under the supervision of common courts of law. Such legal protection was, however, unsatisfactory and only the exercise of the two-step theory made it possible to regard a decision establishing whether an agreement has been concluded or renounced as an individual administrative act, consequently subjected to the cognition of administrative courts. Apart from creating a concept of an administrative law agreement, the devel-opment of a two-step theory constitutes one of the important accomplishments of the German civil law doctrine, which continues to be used in German <b>public</b> <b>aid</b> law notwithstanding the introduction in 1977 of an administrative law agreement. In this paper, the leading opinions on the two-step theory present in the German public law doctrine have been presented...|$|R
