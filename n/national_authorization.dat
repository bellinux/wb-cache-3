40|$|The {{purpose of}} {{introducing}} the <b>national</b> <b>authorization</b> system of private qualification by an enactment of Framework Act on Qualifications was {{to improve the}} general level of private qualification by improving an excellent private qualification and to support a personal ability development and recognition through mutually supplementing the national qualification. Since the <b>national</b> <b>authorization</b> system of private qualification was enacted in 2000, 67 subjects of private qualification by 39 institutions have been authorized and utilized as of August 2007. Also, the total of 2, 981, 868 persons acquired the authorized private qualification as of August 2007. The {{number of people who}} acquire the authorized private qualification tends to increase with the increase of authorized subjects each year. However, it has been investigated that the utilizing degree of the national authorized private qualification doesn't considerably meet the original purpose even though such national authorized private qualification is quantitatively extended. As a reason why the degree of national authorized private qualification is low, there is a problem of private qualification and a lack of government's activation efforts. ...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} was conducted to evaluate {{the performance of the}} <b>National</b> <b>Authorization</b> System of Private Qualifications (hereinafter referred to as "the Authorization System") and to suggest implemental remedies. By reviewing the introduction purpose and management situation of the Authorization System the range and method of performance analysis were determined. Tool for performance analysis was devised through analysing preceding studies on policy evaluation and performance analysis with the aspect of input and output. Questionnaire survey was adopted to gather data for performance analysis from 1, 412 respondents who have an authorized private qualification, 78 assessment committee members for authorization and 123 personnel manager in firms. Utilization status of private qualifications and implemental remedies for the Authorization System were surveyed through in-depth interview with the administrators of private qualification (authorized 38, unauthorized 35). ...|$|E
40|$|Article 13 (4) of the Services Directive {{provides}} that subject to certain conditions, member states {{have an obligation}} to introduce a system whereby tacit authorization is granted if an application is not processed within the set time limit. This article discusses the implications of this provision for national administrative law in the Netherlands, Germany and France. How have the national lawmakers dealt with this European obligation? The study in this contribution examines {{the extent to which these}} countries have opted to make exceptions for <b>national</b> <b>authorization</b> schemes to the basic European rule that tacit authorization will be granted if a decision is not made on time. Overriding reasons relating to the public interest, including the legitimate interests of third parties, play a major role. There is a particular focus on the way the various member states have determined when and on what conditions tacit authorization can be granted, how the administrative authority in question can protect the public interests involved after such a tacit authorization is deemed granted and how any third parties involved can seek legal protection against the tacit authorization. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{feasibility}} of collecting {{detailed information on}} the marketing authorization of new medicines in the European Union was investigated by conducting a study to ob-tain data {{on the use of}} the concertation procedure. Ten pharmaceutical companies provided information on 13 biotechnology or high technology products going through the procedure between 1988 and 1993. The main reason fo r choosing the rapporteur state was for its experience. Discussions with the rapporteur were consid-ered useful, particularly for guidance, facilitating timely responses to questions and forestalling divergence of opinion. The total length of time of the procedure ranged from 272 - 882 days. The length of time to national marketing authorization following a favorable Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products (CPMP) opinion ranged from 5 - 1. 374 days. The rapporteur authority tended overall to be the quickest, and conversely, authorities dissenting in the original CPMP opinion were among the slowest to grant <b>national</b> <b>authorization.</b> In general, good harmonization of the sum-mary of product characteristics was achieved. This study provides companies with useful in formation on the concertation procedure and will also be helpful for design-ing future studies of the newly established centralized and mutual recognition proce-dures...|$|E
40|$|In 1999, the National Transuranic (TRU) Waste Program (NTP) {{achieved}} {{two significant}} milestones. First, the Waste Isolation Plant (WIPP) opened in March for the permanent disposal of TRU waste generated by, and temporarily stored at, various sites supporting the nation's defense programs. Second, the Hazardous Waste Facility Permit, {{issued by the}} New Mexico Environment Department, for WIPP became effective in November. While the opening of WIPP brought to closure a number of scientific, engineering, regulatory, and political challenges, achieving this major milestone led to {{a new set of}} challenges-how to achieve the Department of Energy's (DOE's) NTP end-state vision: All TRU waste from DOE sites scheduled for closure is removed All legacy TRU waste from DOE sites with an ongoing nuclear mission is disposed 0 All newly generated TRU waste is disposed as it is generated The goal is to operate the national TRU waste program safely, cost effectively, in compliance with applicable regulations and agreements, and at full capacity in a fully integrated mode. The existing schedule for TRU waste disposition would achieve the NTP vision in 2034 at an estimated life-cycle cost of $ 16 B. The DOE's Carlsbad Field Office (CBFO) seeks to achieve this vision early-by at least 10 years- while saving the nation an estimated $ 48 to $ 6 B. CBFO's approach is to optimize, or to make as functional as possible, TRU waste disposition. That is, to remove barriers that impede waste disposition, and increase the rate and cost efficiency of waste disposal at WIPP, while maintaining safety. The Mobile/Modular Deployment Project (MMDP) is the principal vehicle for implementing DOE's new commercial model of using best business practices of <b>national</b> <b>authorization</b> basis, standardization, and economies of scale to accelerate the completion of WIPP's mission. The MMDP is one of the cornerstones of the National TRU Waste System Optimization Project (1). The objective of the MMDP is to increase TRU waste shipment and disposal rates from currently certified sites as well as to provide a means to remove TRU waste from sites that have no characterization capability...|$|E
