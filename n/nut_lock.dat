40|$|The {{present study}} aims at {{optimizing}} the rotatory torque {{of the automobile}} brake drum (as the response variable) getting help from the discussions {{in the design of}} experiments and response surface methodology. Considering the crucial function of Axle assy, especially the automobile brake drum due to its relevance to the safety of the automobile passengers, the study of the producing and assembling processes and conducting the quality control experiments during these stages is of great importance. With regard to the great significance of three main factors, namely, seal-oil spindle diameter, seal-oil internal diameter and <b>nut</b> <b>lock</b> torque as independent variables, the present research attempts to optimize the rotatory torque of the automobile brake drum. In the following parts the amount of the optimum torque has been calculated using the non-linear programming model...|$|E

50|$|Further {{investigations}} by the HSE {{found that}} heavy and constant vibrations on the stretcher bars and their bolts caused them {{in turn to}} vibrate and oscillate until their nuts literally fell off the bolts. These have since been replaced by two-part <b>locking</b> <b>nuts</b> instead of the main <b>nuts</b> having half-size <b>locking</b> <b>nuts</b> to hold them in place.|$|R
5000|$|Ibanez Fixed Edge {{while it}} still uses the <b>locking</b> <b>nut</b> and <b>locking</b> bridge, it was mounted {{on top of}} the body, and was used not as a vibrato system, but to provide a {{familiar}} feel to vibrato users, and even more tuning stability on a hardtailed guitar.|$|R
50|$|A locknut, {{also known}} as a <b>lock</b> <b>nut,</b> <b>locking</b> <b>nut,</b> {{prevailing}} torque nut, stiff nut or elastic stop nut, is a nut that resists loosening under vibrations and torque. Elastic stop nuts and prevailing torque nuts are of the particular type where some portion of the nut deforms elastically to provide a locking action. The first type used fiber instead of nylon and was invented in 1931.|$|R
50|$|Headset {{wrenches}} are oversized (32 - 36 mm) flat open-end wrenches for tightening headset {{cups and}} <b>lock</b> <b>nuts</b> on threaded steering tubes. May {{be designed to}} contact 7 sides of an 8 sided (8-point) <b>lock</b> <b>nut.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{countries}} where the theft of alloy wheels is a serious problem, <b>locking</b> <b>nuts</b> (or bolts, as applicable) are available - or already fitted by the vehicle manufacturer - which require a special adaptor ("key") between the nut and the wrench to fit and remove. The key is normally unique to each set of <b>nuts.</b> Only one <b>locking</b> <b>nut</b> per wheel is normally used, so they are sold in sets of four. Most designs can be defeated using a hardened removal tool which uses a left-hand self-cutting thread to grip the <b>locking</b> <b>nut,</b> although more advanced designs have a spinning outer ring to frustrate such techniques.|$|R

Some jurisdictions, including West Germany, prohibited eared hubcaps. Some manufacturers (e.g. Maserati) preferred to hold the wheel on the splined hub by capping with a single conventional unwinged nut requiring a special large spanner.|$|R
50|$|A {{non-locking}} version, Edge II, {{appeared on}} the Vinnie Moore signature guitar in 1989. The guitar employed a low-friction <b>nut</b> and <b>locking</b> tuners.|$|R
50|$|Locknut {{types are}} available, which utilize {{deformed}} threads or a nylon locking element, {{much like a}} nyloc <b>nut.</b> These <b>locking</b> plate <b>nuts</b> are used when the nut is subjected to constant changes in environment or to vibration. The nylon insert expands and stops vibrations of the nut and acts as a locking arrangement. Other types have a floating <b>nut</b> or replaceable <b>locking</b> elements. A typical U.S. military specification for plate nuts is MS21047.|$|R

5000|$|Another type is a <b>locking</b> <b>nut.</b> This nut—usually used in {{conjunction}} with a locking vibrato system such as a Floyd Rose or Kahler—clamps the strings against the nut. This improves tuning stability when using the vibrato bar. A drawback however, is that the <b>locking</b> <b>nut</b> must be loosened using an Allen wrench to tune outside the range of the fine tuners on the bridge (if present).|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to identify the main design parameters contributing to loosening of bolts due to vibration and to identify their relative importance and degree of contribution to bolt loosening. Vibration testing was conducted on a shaketable with a controlled-random input in the dynamic testing laboratory of the Structural Test Division of MSFC. Test specimens which contained one test bolt were vibrated for a fixed amount of time and percentage of pre-load loss was measured. Each specimen tested implemented some combination of eleven design parameters as dictated by the design of experiment methodology employed. The eleven design parameters were: bolt size (diameter), lubrication on bolt, hole tolerance, initial pre-load, <b>nut</b> <b>locking</b> device, grip length, thread pitch, lubrication between mating materials, class of fit, joint configuration and mass of configuration. These parameters were chosen for this experiment because they are believed to be the design parameters having the greatest impact on bolt loosening. Two values of each design parameter were used and each combination of parameters tested was subjected to two different directions of vibration and two different g-levels of vibration. One replication was made for each test to gain some indication of experimental error and repeatability and to give some degree of statistical credibility to the data, resulting in a total of 96 tests being performed. The results of the investigation indicated that <b>nut</b> <b>locking</b> devices, joint configuration, fastener size, and mass of configuration were significant in bolt loosening due to vibration. The results of this test can be utilized to further research the complex problem of bolt loosening due to vibration...|$|R

50|$|Designed {{to restore}} Fender's {{reputation}} after {{a group of}} employees led by William C. Schultz took over ownership from CBS in the early 1980s. The pickups used in early models were dual humbucking Red Lace Sensors in the bridge position and a single Blue Lace Sensor in the neck position. Later models (post-1995 or so) used three Gold Lace Sensors or a Red/Silver/Blue set in a Strat-like configuration, as well as low-friction roller <b>nuts,</b> <b>locking</b> synchronized vibrato bridge and tuners, and a bound contoured alder body with ash veneers. These instruments were discontinued in 1998 {{with the advent of}} the American Deluxe series. In 2011 Fender released the Modern Player Telecaster Plus as a part of the Modern Player series. The guitar has a humbucker in the bridge, a Strat pickup in the middle, and a Tele pickup in the neck positions.|$|R
50|$|Guitars and basses have {{stainless}} steel frets, a zero fret, a teflon <b>nut,</b> oversized <b>locking</b> tuners, DiMarzio potentiometers, and Switchcraft jacks. Cavities are shielded.

50|$|The RGX 621D had a Yamaha height-adjustable <b>locking</b> <b>nut.</b> This allowed {{players to}} {{customize}} {{the action and}} feel of their guitar based on playing style and string gauge preference.|$|R
50|$|Center <b>lock</b> <b>nuts</b> {{are similar}} to {{elliptical}} offset nuts, except that they are distorted {{in the middle of}} the nut. This allows the nut to be started from either side.|$|R
50|$|The body {{is small}} {{with a deep}} double cutaway similar to the Fender Swinger. The tuning {{machines}} are found on the upper edge of the triangular headstock and a <b>locking</b> <b>nut</b> clamps the strings behind a plastic nut, as typically found on Fender guitars. The rosewood fretboard has 24 jumbo frets and features a <b>locking</b> <b>nut.</b> The bridge is a floating System I tremolo. The controls have inset rubber grips, the tuning heads have fully enclosed gears, and the jack socket is an enclosed, not 'skeleton', type, in contrast to many other Fender products with 'economy' hardware. A variety of metallic poly finishes were available including a sunburst pattern (non-metallic).|$|R
50|$|V2 - Introduced in 2000, {{discontinued}} 2002. Has a side jack, back-routed control cavity, reverse headstock, licensed Floyd Rose bridge, bolt-on 24 fret neck, and a <b>locking</b> <b>nut.</b> Versions were HH, HSS, HSH. These 2-octave {{models were}} made in three colors: Black Metallic (565), Cobalt Blue Metallic (587), and Purple Metallic (593). The V2 models also offered HH 7-string versions. The 7 string version came in two models: a Floyd Rose bridge with <b>locking</b> <b>nut</b> (7FR) and a hard tail fixed bridge (7HT) with a regular nut. The 7 string models came in three colors: Black Metallic (565), Cobalt Blue Metallic (587) and Purple Metallic (593). All came with black hardware.|$|R
