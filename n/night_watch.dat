5|$|Following {{the sack}} of Constantinople by the Fourth Crusade in 1204, the office's {{continuity}} was broken, {{and when it}} reappears in {{the sources of the}} Palaiologan period, it had lost any judicial functions and resembled more its original military character: according to the mid-14th century Book of Offices of Pseudo-Kodinos, the Grand Droungarios of the Watch was a subordinate of the Grand Domestic, charged with the <b>night</b> <b>watch</b> and with supervising the army's scouts. In reality, however, it had become more of a sinecure and was essentially a court dignity devoid of any but ceremonial duties.|$|E

500|$|The {{second story}} {{takes place in}} the far north of Westeros, where an 8,000-year-old wall of ice, simply called [...] "the Wall", defends the Seven Kingdoms from the Others. The Wall's sentinels, the Sworn Brotherhood of the <b>Night's</b> <b>Watch,</b> also protect the realm from the incursions of the [...] "wildlings" [...] or [...] "Free Folk", who are humans living north of the Wall. The <b>Night's</b> <b>Watch</b> story is told {{primarily}} through {{the point of view of}} Jon Snow, Eddard's bastard son. Jon follows the footsteps of his uncle Benjen Stark and joins the Watch at a young age, rising quickly through the ranks, eventually becoming Lord Commander of the <b>Night's</b> <b>Watch.</b> In the third volume, A Storm of Swords, the <b>Night's</b> <b>Watch</b> storyline becomes increasingly entangled with the War of the Five Kings.|$|R
5|$|The short fifth {{passage is}} a {{continuation}} of the previous events and relates an exchange of courtesies between court ladies and a monk who had kept <b>night</b> <b>watch</b> telling religious and other stories. Murasaki Shikibu tells him: You cannot see such a lovely thing every day, to which he replies: Indeed! indeed! clapping his hands in joy and neglecting his Buddha. The illustration shows an elderly priest near the left border of the painting pushing open a folding screen beyond which three court ladies are seated. Murasaki Shikibu is seated closest to the monk directly behind the screen.|$|E
5|$|This {{increase}} {{of interest in}} vampiric plotlines led to the vampire being depicted in films such as Underworld and Van Helsing, and the Russian <b>Night</b> <b>Watch</b> and a TV miniseries remake of Salem's Lot, both from 2004. The series Blood Ties premiered on Lifetime Television in 2007, featuring a character portrayed as Henry Fitzroy, illegitimate son of Henry VIII of England turned vampire, in modern-day Toronto, with a female former Toronto detective in the starring role.

50|$|In Europe, {{firefighting}} {{was quite}} rudimentary until the 17th century. In 1254, a royal decree of King Saint Louis of France created the so-called guet bourgeois ("burgess watch"), allowing {{the residents of}} Paris to establish their own <b>night</b> <b>watches,</b> separate from the king's <b>night</b> <b>watches,</b> to prevent and stop crimes and fires. After the Hundred Years' War, the population of Paris expanded again, and the city, much larger than any other city in Europe at the time, {{was the scene of}} several great fires in the 16th century. As a consequence, King Charles IX disbanded the residents' <b>night</b> <b>watches</b> and left the king's watches as the only one responsible for checking crimes and fires.|$|R
