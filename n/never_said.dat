5|$|Paul Brown {{integrated}} {{pro football}} without uttering {{a single word}} about integration. He just went out, signed a bunch of great black athletes, and started kicking butt. That's how you do it. You don't talk about it. Paul <b>never</b> <b>said</b> one word about race. But {{this was a time}} in sports when you'd play in some cities and the white players could stay at the nice hotel, but the blacks had to stay in the homes of some black families in town. But not with Paul. We always stayed in hotels that took the entire team. Again, he <b>never</b> <b>said</b> a word. But in his own way, the man integrated football the right way – and no one was going to stop him.|$|E
5|$|Twilight confronts Discord, {{accusing him}} of {{cheating}} since he destroyed the labyrinth before they {{could get to the}} end of the game. However, Discord counters this by reminding her that, while he had hinted at where the Elements were, he <b>never</b> <b>said</b> anything about them being in the labyrinth. As he disappears and teases the ponies with another storm of chocolate rain, Twilight realizes that a line from Discord's riddle actually refers to Ponyville itself.|$|E
5|$|During {{the summer}} before the 1953 season, the Browns' {{original}} owners sold the team for a then-unheard-of $600,000. The buyers were a group of prominent Cleveland men: Dave R. Jones, a businessman and former Cleveland Indians director, Ellis Ryan, a former Indians president, Homer Marshman, an attorney, and Saul Silberman, owner of the Randall Park race track. McBride had been called in 1950 {{to testify before the}} Kefauver Committee, a congressional body investigating organized crime, which partly exposed his ties to mafia figures but did not result in any charges. While McBride <b>never</b> <b>said</b> so, the Kefauver hearings and the growing public association between him and the mafia may {{have played a role in}} his decision to get out of football.|$|E

2500|$|In March 1928, Nevers {{announced}} that he would not return to professional football that fall, opting instead to serve as an assistant coach to Pop Warner at Stanford. <b>Nevers</b> <b>said</b> of professional football: [...] "I hurt my back last year and don't care to take any more chances." [...] He returned to Stanford in September 1928 as coach of the reserve football players.|$|R
5000|$|Proponents {{of the law}} {{state that}} {{it is meant to}} promote {{critical}} thinking and improve education. State Senator Ben <b>Nevers</b> <b>said</b> the law is intended to allow educators to create an environment that [...] "(promotes) critical thinking skills, logical analysis, and open and objective discussions of scientific theories such as evolution, the origins of life, global warming, and human cloning." ...|$|R
5|$|Matthews went on {{to release}} her first solo album, Cockahoop, in May 2003. Her second album <b>Never</b> <b>Said</b> Goodbye was {{released}} in August 2006. In November 2007 she released a mini-album of Welsh language songs Awyren=Aeroplane on the My Kung Fu label. Matthews returned in late 2009 as the first recording artist to release albums simultaneously in both Welsh and English (Paid Edrych I Lawr and Don't Look Down, respectively). Powell {{has gone on to}} write songs, including for Duffy, and from 2007 onwards has presented a Welsh language show on Radio Cymru. He also replaced drummer Stuart Cable from the Stereophonics, following his death, in the supergroup The Stand. They released a charity single in 2010 to fund construction of a statue of Welsh footballer Fred Keenor in Cardiff city centre.|$|E

25|$|The third series aired from 14 October to 25 November 2006. There {{had been}} {{speculation}} {{that this would}} be the final series; however, Tate explained in an interview on This Morning that she had <b>never</b> <b>said</b> this and would like to at least do specials in the future.|$|E
25|$|His {{far more}} ample prose writings, {{peppered}} with many aphorisms and bons mots, reveal a conservative and skeptical outlook on human nature, verging on the cynical. However, he <b>never</b> <b>said</b> or wrote anything giving aid or comfort to {{any form of}} totalitarianism popular during his lifetime.|$|E
25|$|Asher's scars are {{hesitant}} {{around the}} face and groin, noted by Anita that {{it was as if}} the Priests flinched at the destruction of such beauty. The Priests (<b>never</b> <b>said</b> which denomination, but it is assumed Catholic) used Holy Water in an attempt to save Asher's soul (from what is <b>never</b> <b>said,</b> either). Asher is moody with a sadistic mean streak, lashing out at everyone in his fits of melancholic pain. He wants most to be loved and devoted by Jean-Claude, more a lover of men than women. Asher knows that it is through Anita's attraction to him combined with Jean-Claude's that Jean-Claude returns the love. Without Anita's acceptance, Jean-Claude could never bring himself to nearly be consumed for want of Asher again. That coupled with the incident of Asher nearly bleeding Anita to death during their first and only exclusive sexual experience leads to Asher's emotional neglect. Neither Anita nor Jean-Claude trust themselves alone with Asher, but as a trio, they live in nearly perfect love.|$|E

25|$|On June 7, 1978, Gaggi {{and nine}} other mobsters {{were charged with}} racketeering, conspiracy, and fraud charges {{as a result of}} a year-long federal {{investigation}} into the bankruptcy of a theatre in New York. The majority of the evidence in this case came from wiretapped conversations; fortunately for Gaggi, he <b>never</b> <b>said</b> anything incriminating. In December 1978, Gaggi was cleared of all charges.|$|E
25|$|Zille later apologized {{and said}} she was “very, very sorry about the impact of those words”. She was “sorry because it was never meant in that context at all, and it was <b>never</b> <b>said</b> in that way at all. She said “What I was trying to show up was what (Basic) Education Minister Angie Motshekga calls a ‘horror story’ of {{education}} in much of the Eastern Cape”.|$|E
25|$|On June 1, 1993, CBS News {{correspondent}} Connie Chung began co-anchoring {{the broadcast}} with Dan Rather. Chung normally co-anchored {{in the studio}} with Rather, but sometimes one of them appeared on location, while the other remained in the studio. Though Rather <b>never</b> <b>said</b> so publicly, CBS News insiders said he did not approve of her appointment. Chung's last broadcast as co-anchor was on May 18, 1995.|$|E

25|$|Rabbi Akiva (or {{some say}} Rabban Johanan ben Zakai) <b>never</b> <b>said</b> {{in the house}} of study {{that it was time to}} stop studying, except on the eve of Passover and the eve of the Yom Kippur. On the eve of Passover, it was because of the {{children}}, so that they might not fall asleep, and on the eve of the Day of Atonement, it was so that they should feed their children before the fast.|$|E
25|$|Both sides {{brought on}} many witnesses, {{including}} several historians. A notable {{witness for the}} defence was Haia Greenberg (aged 29), a local nurse who survived the Proskurov pogroms (now, Khmelnytskyi, Ukraine) and testified about the carnage. She <b>never</b> <b>said</b> that Petliura personally participated in the event, but rather some other soldiers who did {{said that they were}} directed by Petliura. Several former Ukrainian officers testified for the prosecution, including Red Cross representative who witnessed Semesenko's report to Petliura.|$|E
25|$|Phelps finally set out {{to return}} to Cairo, passing Commander Henry Walke and the USS Carondelet who had been ordered by General Grant to wait for Phelps’ gunboats and then {{together}} proceed towards Fort Donelson. However, when Walke ordered Phelps to proceed to the next fort with him, Phelps refused, having already received a message to rendezvous with Commander Foote at Cario. Walke felt that Phelps refusal amounted to “insubordination” but Foote <b>never</b> <b>said</b> anything about the disagreement.|$|E

25|$|The Lausanne conference {{convened in}} late 1922 {{to settle the}} terms of a new treaty that would take the place of the Treaty of Sèvres. Inönü became famous for his {{stubborn}} resolve in determining Ankara's position as the legitimate, sovereign government of Turkey. After delivering his position, Inönü turned off his hearing aid during the speeches of British foreign secretary Lord Curzon. When the secretary had finished, Inönü reiterated his position as if Lord Curzon had <b>never</b> <b>said</b> a word.|$|E
25|$|A cryptic {{message from}} Paramount has Norma certain that DeMille {{is eager to}} discuss her script. She drops in {{on the set of}} his current film and is greeted warmly by former colleagues and the famed {{director}} himself, but DeMille is noncommittal about Salome. Meanwhile, Max discovers the studio had called to ask about Norma's exotic car, not her screenplay. However, a delusional Norma leaves the lot convinced she'll soon be back {{in front of the cameras}} and begins to prepare for the role ("As If <b>Never</b> <b>Said</b> Goodbye").|$|E
25|$|Beginning {{to think}} he was {{indispensable}} at Radio 1, the first big falling-out with management came in December 1995 after taking his crew out on a 17-hour pub-crawl which ended two hours before they were due on air: Evans was fined one day's pay, £7,000. In 1996, broadcasting watchdogs investigated a continual trail of complaints against the show: Radio 1 refused to comment, Evans <b>never</b> <b>said</b> sorry. Evans also made increasing public demands of the Radio 1 management: after taking an extra week of unplanned holiday, Evans chose to turn up half an hour late for his 06:30 show and then demanded that his hours were changed so that it was a permanent fixture – this request was accepted.|$|E
