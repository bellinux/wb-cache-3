Even after three nuclear tests the international discussion continues to tiptoe around this crucial question for the nuclear non-proliferation regime.

40|$|The {{conflict}} over the Iranian nuclear programme represents {{the greatest challenge}} for international efforts to prevent nuclear proliferation. For decades Iran has been violating obligations contained in its safeguards agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) {{in order to become}} nuclear weapons capable. But what impact does the {{conflict over}} Tehran’s nuclear programme have on the nuclear non-proliferation regime? In three areas there is significant overlap between efforts to find a solution with Iran and broader discussions about strengthening non-proliferation norms, rules and procedures: verification of civilian nuclear programmes, limiting the ability to produce weapons-grade fissile materials, and nuclear fuel supply guarantees. The nuclear dispute with Tehran is likely to have specific effects in each of these fields on the non-proliferation regime’s norms, rules and procedures. The ninth NPT review conference, which will take place from 27 April to 22 May 2015, offers an opportunity to draw lessons from the nuclear conflict and discuss ideas for further strengthening the regime.

40|$|Australia is tacitly {{endorsing}} India 2 ̆ 7 s maverick approach, argues ANDY BUTFOY IT APPEARS Australia has ditched its longstanding {{insistence that}} the nuclear weapons non-proliferation treaty (NPT) should be the principal benchmark in arms control. This is an obvious interpretation of Canberra’s decision {{to pave the way}} for uranium sales to India, a country which rejects established treaties aimed at stopping the nuclear arms race. The government believes boosting mining profits, and following Washington’s lead on nuclear cooperation with India, are more important than reinforcing global non-proliferation rules. Consequently, many people around the world will view Canberra as abandoning the high ground in nuclear diplomacy and pulling the rug from under the NPT and some related measures. Of course, there is a case for selling uranium to India. It’s one that often reflects the views of the US neocons who laid much of the groundwork for the idea. This case can be explained in terms of the following six points. First, advocates play the global warming card. Indian energy demand is set to sky-rocket and it’s said that unless the bulk of this is met by nuclear energy, the fight against greenhouse gases will be severely set back. For analysts who have watched the United States shift toward supporting Indian nuclear ambitions over the years, though, this putative concern mostly looks like tactical positioning rather than a genuine or driving motive. Second, advocates say it’s a moral nonsense for the rules to ban civil nuclear sales to a democracy like India while simultaneously permitting sales to an authoritarian state like China just because Beijing has signed arms control agreements. Neocons, and some others, think the essential basis for discrimination in uranium sales should be the character of the recipient government, rather than whether or not it’s a fully signed up member of the non-proliferation regime. There is some merit in this argument - as long as it isn’t pushed too far, and as long as other parts of the picture aren’t ignored, such as the damage that would result from trashing a widely supported treaty. Treaty adherence and political character both need to be looked at. Here it should be noted that critics of the Indian deal are not necessarily enthusiastic about sales to China, whatever treaties it has signed. In any case, don’t expect many of those politicians, consultants and firms eager to export uranium to India to develop many qualms about trading with semi-fascist China. Third, it’s sometimes said (although not by Canberra, at least not in public) that the NPT has passed its use-by date. This is usually simplistic rhetoric rather than analysis, but it serves the purpose of making it easier to paint India’s refusal to sign as irrelevant. Unfortunately, this approach risks turning the collapse of the NPT into a reckless self-fulfilling prophecy. It echoes the broader neocon approach to much multilateral arms control, an approach which often looks more like vandalism than prudent management of international security. Fourth, some arm-chair strategists think India can be used to balance the growing power of China. They believe the West, especially the US, should develop and expand a strategic relationship with the country, and they see nuclear cooperation as part of this grand design. Fifth, we are told Australia’s hands are clean because inspections will ensure our material won’t find its way into Indian weapons. But imports from here can be used to free up other sources of uranium for India’s military, thus facilitating an expansion of its nuclear arsenal. In addition, the inspection regime will almost certainly be riddled with holes. Some facilities will probably be held up as models of cooperation, but this could be quite misleading. Any suggestion that India’s nuclear infrastructure will be subject to world’s best practice as far as inspections and controls are concerned (on a par with Canada, Germany or Japan, for instance) is complete nonsense, as Canberra well knows. Sixth, it’s asserted India has a good record and acts in a manner consistent with the spirit of the NPT. This last claim has been repeatedly served up for public consumption and has been a favourite mantra of media supporters of the deal eager to display their supposed expertise on the subject. The government seems to have settled on this line as the key selling point of its policy. It has a point because, as far as we know, India has behaved much better than, say, Pakistan and China. This point has also been pushed too far. To a large extent the “India-as-good-global-citizen” line is a marketing pitch. It’s as much a product of spin as of examination. It needs to be put into perspective, an exercise which also reveals how far Foreign Minister Downer has been prepared to twist around on the topic. Here it’s worth stepping back a few years. In the 1990 s Australia, more than any other country, was responsible for getting near-universal backing for the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) - despite strong opposition from India. The Labor and Liberal governments of the time had much to be proud of as the treaty was widely seen as the key next step in reinforcing the NPT. In 1998 Downer said: “The pivotal role we played in the negotiation and adoption of the CTBT is a reflection of our commitment to the global nuclear non-proliferation regime. This regime is central to our national security. ” As Downer explained “One of the great achievements of the CTBT is to provide a codified international benchmark against which the actions of individual members of the international community can be judged. Countries which defy this code of behaviour, as India and Pakistan have done, know that they can expect to feel the full weight of international opprobrium. ” Just two years ago Downer was president of an international conference tasked with bringing the CTBT into legal force, something which requires, among other things, a reversal of Indian policy. He spoke of his “unwavering support” for the treaty and his determination to take it forward, saying it would be “a decisive contribution to world peace and stability for generations to come. ” He explicitly argued that a suspension of tests was not an acceptable substitute for full treaty ratification. Moreover, he said of those not ratifying: “we have over the years heard many reasons why this is so. The time for excuses is past. It is time for them to act. ” India ignored the appeal. No matter. The Australian government has now sold out, and backs a rewrite of the rules on nuclear trade for the sake of a country that has repeatedly spat on the CTBT. Even today India insists that deals with foreign governments will not constrain its nuclear weapons program, including its stance on testing. And this stance has been reckless, bloody minded and provocative. Only India signing and ratifying the CTBT will help fix the damage. For the sake of both keeping multilateral arms control on the rails and Australian self-respect, ratification of the test-ban should have been made one of the conditions of any deal. (There would be an embarrassing problem with this approach, however: a close Australian ally and recipient of our uranium - the US under President George W. Bush - also opposes ratification of the CTBT.) Accepting the fact that India is a nuclear armed state with legitimate nuclear energy needs is one thing, but we should have still kept the bar on uranium deals at a reasonable height. Failing to do so has surrendered leverage and compromised our standing as leaders in non-proliferation. The internationally agreed regulations on nuclear exports are laid down by the Nuclear Suppliers Group. The NSG keeps countries that refuse to sign the NPT on the outer. If the US and Australia have their way, this provision will be blown apart. Downer should reflect on a key line from the NSG’s website, which says: “The NSG was created following the explosion in 1974 of a nuclear device by a [previously] <b>non-nuclear-weapon</b> <b>State,</b> which demonstrated that nuclear technology transferred for peaceful purposes could be misused. ” The country in question was India; it had lied and bombed its way into the nuclear club. Unfortunately, and however much it was clearly not the intention of Downer and his colleagues, Australia will now be seen as tacitly endorsing this gate-crashing strategy. • Andy Butfoy is a senior lecturer in international relations at Monash University.

40|$|The classic {{security}} framework {{from the}} time of the East–West conflict no longer exists. NATO no longer faces any conventional threat. The relationship between Russia and the West, though not constituting a security community, is certainly no longer characterized by hostility. As a result, the nuclear arsenals of both sides are dwindling: more than one third of the strategic warheads existing in the 1980 s have been done away with; according to the stated goals of the START II treaty, by the middle of the next decade, stocks will stand at less than a quarter of their historic highs. Types of tactical nuclear weapons have decreased dramatically in number; more than 90 per cent have been deactivated, and a large number dismantled. Britain and France have also reduced their stocks of nuclear weapons, albeit by a much more modest extent. Soon Britain will possess only one type of nuclear weapon, and France only two. The flexibility of the various arsenals has markedly diminished as a result of this reduction in variety. These developments have cleared the view to a long-obscured goal of nuclear arms control: a nuclearweapon- free world. Our subject here is the international discourse about nuclear disarmament. In tackling it, we wish to distance ourselves from a view that sees politics merely as an exchange of blows between 2 ̆ 7 robust interests 2 ̆ 7 in the arena of power politics, with the accompanying rhetoric serving merely to spread an ideological and legitimatory smoke-screen over this 2 ̆ 7 hard core 2 ̆ 7. Whether comprehensive nuclear disarmament has any chance of being achieved is, in our view, signalled firstly—though not exclusively and entirely—by the way in which it is discussed in international politics. It is this discussion that we shall examine here. We shall try, firstly, to establish how the justification for, and military and political role of, nuclear weapons is dealt with in various international forums, in the nuclear-weapon states themselves, and in Germany; secondly, we shall try to gauge whether, within these debates, any changes can be identified which would permit some kind of diagnosis and prognosis of trends. The NPT Extension Conference constitutes a dividing-line in this regard. The contracting parties themselves were at odds about the importance of nuclear disarmament from the outset. A brief account of the course of this dispute is therefore given, before the NPT Review and Extension Conference of spring 1995 is analysed in detail. This conference was of great importance in setting the agenda for the global discussion about nuclear weapons. The decision to extend the treaty also marks the start of a new era in the debate about nuclear disarmament. The extent to which the disarmament obligations of the nuclear-weapon states, which are not laid down anywhere else but in the NPT, were endorsed and concretized was striking. Whereas previously, the rather ambiguous wording of Article VI could have given the impression that the NWS were duty-bound to enter into negotiations but not to produce results, and that disarmament was a process but not necessarily an end-point, the Principles and Objectives agreed during the Extension Conference preclude this interpretation: they talk unequivocally of the complete elimination of nuclear weapons. In addition, fixing 1996 as the deadline for the halting of tests marked the nuclear-weapon states 2 ̆ 7 firstever acceptance of a fixed date for an arms-control measure; and the demand for the immediate commencement of negotiations on a 2 ̆ 7 cut-off 2 ̆ 7 is tantamount to another deadline. Lastly, there was a call for the 2 ̆ 7 determined pursuit …of systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally 2 ̆ 7; this is more precise than the vague call to pursue negotiations 2 ̆ 7 in good faith 2 ̆ 7 contained in Article VI of the NPT. In his final statement to the conference, the American representative acknowledged this fact: the ultimate goal, he said, was a nuclear-weapon-free world. Following the end of the Extension Conference, there was no more disputing the fact that the ultimate objective was comprehensive nuclear disarmament. However, at the debates conducted within the framework of the United Nations and the Geneva Conference on Disarmament, the various parties now got stuck into deciding 2 ̆ 7 how 2 ̆ 7, 2 ̆ 7 how fast 2 ̆ 7, and 2 ̆ 7 in which forum 2 ̆ 7. In this matter, the nuclear-weapon states and the threshold countries that were not party to the NPT occupied the extreme ends of the spectrum, whilst the non-nuclear-weapon industrialized countries and non-aligned states, with their various political variants, occupied the space in between. An overview of all the multilateral forums that deal with nuclear disarmament produces a strangely ambivalent impression. On the one hand, the nuclear-weapon states do not reject the aim of comprehensive disarmament; on the other hand, they fight shy of any concession, even verbal, that might propel them into unforeseen, undesired measures. In so doing, however, they also signal that they have clearly become sensitive to this kind of pressure—whether it emanates from diplomatic sources or from world opinion. Their ostentatiously intransigent attitude is therefore as much an expression of political uncertainty and vulnerability as of strength resulting from de facto power. Where this pressure becomes extremely strong, and extends unequivocally to their own allies—as in the case of the test ban—opportunities arise for concessions that were initially held to be impossible, as in the 2 ̆ 7 zero threshold 2 ̆ 7 modalities of the ban. The non-aligned countries still display the weakness of frequently going for a traditional disarmament purism that preserves the cohesiveness of their otherwise disparate movement, rather than for practical political demands that would do more to advance nuclear disarmament than does 1950 s- or 1960 s-style rhetorical self-gratification. However, there is a new median position (e. g. that of South Africa) which may in the long run present more of a threat to the hardliners amongst the NWS than do unrealistic New-Delhi-style conjurations. The effects stemming from the increase in nuclear-weapon-free zones merit considerable attention. This increase entails a restriction in the scope of the NWS to move freely over the world 2 ̆ 7 s oceans, and to deploy nuclear weapons outside their own territories. This could eventually further undermine the legitimacy of nuclear-weapons ownership. The signature of the relevant protocols by the NWS has, in the last two years, led to an ever greater number of states coming to enjoy binding security assurances from them. The geographical area within which the threat to use, and the use of, nuclear weapons would even be legally permissible has thus considerably diminished in size. Two major international institutions—the Canberra Commission for Nuclear Disarmament, created by a Western-oriented government, namely Australia, and the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which is addressing the question of the legality of nuclear weapons—constitute new forums for discussion of the issue. They will undoubtedly help advance the discussion about the future of nuclear weapons. But how far they can make a practical contribution on the path to a nuclear-weapon-free world remains to be seen. That contribution will stand or fall according to how the International Court of Justice 2 ̆ 7 s ruling and the recommendations of the Canberra Commission are received, and the extent to which account is taken of them in future disarmament discourse. We end our study with a short overview of the national policies and discourses of some of the major players. The aim of this is not to provide a full, in-depth analysis of the various national debates, but to highlight the main positions and—where appropriate—identify changes in relation to the status quo ante. The positions of the nuclear-weapon states and of the most important of the non-nuclear-weapon states, Germany, betray a remarkable ambivalence. In the nuclear-weapon states, the desire to preserve national status clearly predominates. However, this desire is being overlaid by the growing realization that nuclear weapons can no longer be decreed a purely national affair, and therefore a taboo subject, and that disarmament is part and parcel of the transitional legitimation for continued nuclear status. This paradoxical state of affairs leads to a situation in which the nuclear-weapon states, albeit reluctantly, are subordinating themselves to requirements which, although not a sufficient condition for nuclear disarmament, are none the less a necessary one—namely, transparency and a restricted scope for action. But the ambivalence remains: the process is fragile and could easily be reversed; on the other hand, the fact that it is now acceptable to raise certain topics in the internal American debate suggests that a nuclear-weapon state may consider that its long-term interests are better safeguarded in a nuclear-weapon-free world. As far as Germany is concerned, the question it faces is to decide where it stands in this debate, given its status as a major <b>non-nuclear-weapon</b> <b>state.</b> No clear line is at present discernible, and the debate is extremely rudimentary. Between Nibelungen-like loyalty to the Western alliance 2 ̆ 7 s first-use option and a spirited attempt to secure greater transparency in the nuclear powers 2 ̆ 7 nuclear-weapon complex, there is a palette of opinions and attitudes for which no clear common denominator is yet discernible. This is all the more regrettable in that, in this debate more than any other, Germany 2 ̆ 7 s voice carries great weight, and its absence is constantly being used by advocates of nuclear weapons in its partner countries to prove the necessity of their existing arsenals, because otherwise—so they claim—Germany, feeling itself insecure, could institute its own nuclear option. The opening-up of a discussion on German security-needs, and the contribution which nuclear weapons make, or do not make, to it, is unavoidable. It has essentially already been rendered inevitable by the French offer of 2 ̆ 7 extended deterrence 2 ̆ 7. It should not be sidestepped...|$|E
50|$|On {{the other}} hand, some governments, {{especially}} <b>non-nuclear-weapon</b> <b>states</b> {{belonging to the}} Non-Aligned Movement, have interpreted Article VI's language as being anything but vague. In their view, Article VI constitutes a formal and specific obligation on the NPT-recognized nuclear-weapon states to disarm themselves of nuclear weapons, and argue that these states have failed to meet their obligation. The International Court of Justice (ICJ), in its advisory opinion on the Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, issued 8 July 1996, unanimously interprets the text of Article VI as implying that"There exists an obligation to pursue in good faith {{and bring to a}} conclusion negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament in all its aspects under strict and effective international control."The ICJ opinion notes that this obligation involves all NPT parties (not just the nuclear weapon states) and does not suggest a specific time frame for nuclear disarmament.|$|R

More than the violations of the NPT by 'rogue' states like North Korea or Iran, I argue that the failure of the de jure nuclear-weapon powers since 2001 to uphold their informal and some formal NPT commitments suggests the possibility of material breach and/or institutional subversion. If NPT subversion were to occur, the non-nuclear-weapon states' collective responsibility to avoid complicity in that subversion leads them to choose between (a) individually seeking nuclear weapons capability for state security; or, more preferably, (b) a publicly announced and collective withdrawal from the NPT that simultaneously refuses to pursue the nuclear weapons option...|$|R
