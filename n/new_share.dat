This soured the relationship between the Rangers board and King and ended negotiations, with the latter accusing the club of deliberately delayed the publishing of the review until after the renewal period and the Union of Fans remained aligned with King. Indeed, the fans group demanded the board reveal details of the executive bonus entitlements, which it refused to do. Around the same time, Rangers announced a three-year agreement with online casino company 32Red to be the club's new shirt sponsor. On the eve of the business review's publication it was reported that Rangers second highest appearance maker Sandy Jardine had died aged just 65 after a long battle with throat cancer. There was a high degree of anticipation surrounding the review with journalists noting an eight-day delay and the fans hopes for detail and clarity regarding the boards future plans while Rangers director Sandy Easdale acknowledged that the club financial situation was fragile. Upon its publication the review stated the club needed to raise £30m by 2017, including a <b>new</b> <b>share</b> issue, for it to compete in the top league and the board aimed to make the business sustainable by season 2015/16 but required savings to be made including staff redundancies.

6000|$|When we {{two were}} born, {{this country was}} still {{dominated}} by a selected class bred by political marriages. The commercial class had not then completed the first twenty-five years of its <b>new</b> <b>share</b> of political power; and it was itself selected by money qualification, and bred, if not by political marriage, at least by a pretty rigorous class marriage. Aristocracy and plutocracy still furnish the figureheads of politics; but they are now dependent on the votes of the promiscuously bred masses. And this, if you please, {{at the very moment}} when the political problem, having suddenly ceased to mean a very limited and occasional interference, mostly by way of jobbing public appointments, in the mismanagement of a tight but parochial little island, with occasional meaningless prosecution of dynastic wars, has become the industrial reorganization of Britain, the construction of a practically international Commonwealth, and the partition of the whole of Africa and perhaps the whole of Asia by the civilized Powers. Can you believe that the people whose conceptions of society and conduct, whose power of attention and scope of interest, are measured by the British theatre as you know it to-day, can either handle this colossal task themselves, or understand and support the sort of mind and character that is (at least comparatively) capable of handling it? For remember: what our voters are in the pit and gallery they are also in the polling booth. We are all now under what Burke called [...] "the hoofs of the swinish multitude." [...] Burke's language gave great offence because the implied exceptions to its universal application made it a class insult; and it certainly was not for the pot to call the kettle black. The aristocracy he defended, in spite of the political marriages by which it tried to secure breeding for itself, had its mind undertrained by silly schoolmasters and governesses, its character corrupted by gratuitous luxury, its self-respect adulterated to complete spuriousness by flattery and flunkeyism. It is no better to-day and never will be any better: our very peasants have something morally hardier in them that culminates occasionally in a Bunyan, a Burns, or a Carlyle. But observe, this aristocracy, which was overpowered from 1832 to 1885 by the middle class, has come back to power by the votes of [...] "the swinish multitude." [...] Tom Paine has triumphed over Edmund Burke; and the swine are now courted electors. How many of their own class have these electors sent to parliament? Hardly a dozen out of 670, and these only under the persuasion of conspicuous personal qualifications and popular eloquence. The multitude thus pronounces judgment on its own units: it admits itself unfit to govern, and will vote only for a man morphologically and generically transfigured by palatial residence and equipage, by transcendent tailoring, by the glamor of aristocratic kinship. Well, we two know these transfigured persons, these college passmen, these well groomed monocular Algys and Bobbies, these cricketers to whom age brings golf instead of wisdom, these plutocratic products of [...] "the nail and sarspan business as he got his money by." [...] Do you know whether to laugh or cry at the notion that they, poor devils! will drive a team of continents as they drive a four-in-hand; turn a jostling anarchy of casual trade and speculation into an ordered productivity; and federate our colonies into a world-Power of the first magnitude? Give these people the most perfect political constitution and the soundest political program that benevolent omniscience can devise for them, and they will interpret it into mere fashionable folly or canting charity as infallibly as a savage converts the philosophical theology of a Scotch missionary into crude African idolatry.|$|E
