5|$|Manganese {{overexposure}} is {{most frequently}} associated with manganism, a rare <b>neurological</b> <b>disorder</b> associated with excessive manganese ingestion or inhalation. Historically, persons {{employed in the}} production or processing of manganese alloys have been at risk for developing manganism; however, current health and safety regulations protect workers in developed nations. The disorder was first described in 1837 by British academic John Couper, who studied two patients who were manganese grinders.|$|E
5|$|Most {{people on}} {{antipsychotics}} have side effects. People on typical antipsychotics {{tend to have}} a higher rate of extrapyramidal side effects, while some atypicals are associated with considerable weight gain, diabetes and risk of metabolic syndrome; this is most pronounced with olanzapine, while risperidone and quetiapine are also associated with weight gain. Risperidone has a similar rate of extrapyramidal symptoms to haloperidol. It remains unclear whether the newer antipsychotics reduce the chances of developing neuroleptic malignant syndrome or tardive dyskinesia, a rare but serious <b>neurological</b> <b>disorder.</b>|$|E
5|$|Abnormalities of behavior, {{also called}} {{abnormalities}} of activity, include observations of specific abnormal movements, {{as well as}} more general observations of the patient's level of activity and arousal, and observations of the patient's eye contact and gait. Abnormal movements, for example choreiform, athetoid or choreoathetoid movements may indicate a <b>neurological</b> <b>disorder.</b> A tremor or dystonia may indicate a neurological condition or the side effects of antipsychotic medication. The patient may have tics (involuntary but quasi-purposeful movements or vocalizations) which may be a symptom of Tourette's syndrome. There are a range of abnormalities of movement which are typical of catatonia, such as echopraxia, catalepsy, waxy flexibility and paratonia (or gegenhalten). Stereotypies (repetitive purposeless movements such as rocking or head banging) or mannerisms (repetitive quasi-purposeful abnormal movements such as a gesture or abnormal gait) may be a feature of chronic schizophrenia or autism.|$|E

40|$|Although the {{relationship}} between psychological trauma and medically unexplained symptoms (MUS) is well established, this relationship is less well understood in people with medically unexplained neurological symptoms. In the present study, {{we set out to}} compare people with functional <b>neurological</b> <b>disorders,</b> and organic <b>neurological</b> <b>disorders,</b> in terms of childhood and adulthood traumatic events, traumatic stress, emotional dysregulation and symptoms of depression and anxiety. We have hypothesised that those with functional <b>neurological</b> <b>disorders</b> {{would be more likely to}} report childhood and adulthood traumatic life events, traumatic symptomatology, emotional dysregulation and symptoms of anxiety and depression, compared to those with organic <b>neurological</b> <b>disorders.</b> Sample consisted of a consecutive series of people with functional <b>neurological</b> <b>disorders</b> and with organic <b>neurological</b> <b>disorders</b> (n = 82) recruited from a hospital in Scotland. Participants completed measures of life events, traumatic stress, emotional regulation, anxiety and depression. The two groups were found to significantly differ in relation to all measures, with the MUS group being more likely to report childhood and adulthood life events, more severe emotional dysregulation, traumatic stress and symptoms of anxiety and stress. Logistic regression analysis revealed that exposure to childhood traumatic life events, specifically childhood sexual abuse, and childhood physical neglect, were the only factors which were significantly associated with membership of the medically unexplained neurological symptoms group. Although further research is required to confirm our findings, our results suggest that identifying and addressing the impact of childhood trauma, may alleviate distress and aid recovery from functional <b>neurological</b> <b>disorders...</b>|$|R

40|$|Background Comparable data on {{the global}} and {{country-specific}} burden of <b>neurological</b> <b>disorders</b> and their trends are crucial for health-care planning and resource allocation. The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors (GBD) Study provides such information but does not routinely aggregate results that are of interest to clinicians specialising in neurological conditions. In this systematic analysis, we quantified the global disease burden due to <b>neurological</b> <b>disorders</b> in 2015 and its relationship with country development level. Methods We estimated global and country-specific prevalence, mortality, disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs), years of life lost (YLLs), and years lived with disability (YLDs) for various <b>neurological</b> <b>disorders</b> that in the GBD classification have been previously spread across multiple disease groupings. The more inclusive grouping of <b>neurological</b> <b>disorders</b> included stroke, meningitis, encephalitis, tetanus, Alzheimer's disease and other dementias, Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, motor neuron disease, migraine, tension-type headache, medication overuse headache, brain and nervous system cancers, and a residual category of other <b>neurological</b> <b>disorders.</b> We also analysed results based on the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a compound measure of income per capita, education, and fertility, to identify patterns associated with development and how countries fare against expected outcomes relative to their level of development. Findings <b>Neurological</b> <b>disorders</b> ranked as the leading cause group of DALYs in 2015 (250 · 7 [95 % uncertainty interval (UI) 229 · 1 to 274 · 7] million, comprising 10 · 2 % of global DALYs) and the second-leading cause group of deaths (9 · 4 [9 · 1 to 9 · 7] million], comprising 16 · 8 % of global deaths). The most prevalent <b>neurological</b> <b>disorders</b> were tension-type headache (1505 · 9 [UI 1337 · 3 to 1681 · 6 million cases]), migraine (958 · 8 [872 · 1 to 1055 · 6] million), medication overuse headache (58 · 5 [50 · 8 to 67 · 4 million]), and Alzheimer's disease and other dementias (46 · 0 [40 · 2 to 52 · 7 million]). Between 1990 and 2015, {{the number of deaths}} from <b>neurological</b> <b>disorders</b> increased by 36 · 7 %, and the number of DALYs by 7 · 4 %. These increases occurred despite decreases in age-standardised rates of death and DALYs of 26 · 1 % and 29 · 7 %, respectively; stroke and communicable <b>neurological</b> <b>disorders</b> were responsible for most of these decreases. Communicable <b>neurological</b> <b>disorders</b> were the largest cause of DALYs in countries with low SDI. Stroke rates were highest at middle levels of SDI and lowest at the highest SDI. Most of the changes in DALY rates of <b>neurological</b> <b>disorders</b> with development were driven by changes in YLLs. Interpretation <b>Neurological</b> <b>disorders</b> are an important cause of disability and death worldwide. Globally, the burden of <b>neurological</b> <b>disorders</b> has increased substantially over the past 25 years because of expanding population numbers and ageing, despite substantial decreases in mortality rates from stroke and communicable <b>neurological</b> <b>disorders.</b> The number of patients who will need care by clinicians with expertise in neurological conditions will continue to grow in coming decades.

40|$|Artesunate is an {{important}} agent for cerebral malaria {{and all kinds of}} other severe malaria because it is highly efficient, lowly toxic, and well-tolerated.
