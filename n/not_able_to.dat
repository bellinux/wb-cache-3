5|$|Over {{the next}} two weeks more skirmishes {{occurred}} and the Allies were <b>not</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> cut off a major portion of the German forces, but the Germans were also <b>not</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> maintain any stable defense line as planned. On 10September forward units of the VI Corps were able to establish contact with units from Patton's Third Army. Truscott hoped to be able to push through the Belfort Gap, but on 14September he received orders from the Allied High Command to halt the offensive. Army GroupG was finally able to establish a stable defense line at the Vosges mountains, thwarting further Allied advances. This, combined with the Allied need to reorganise their command structure as the forces from northern and southern France have now linked up, forced the Allies to stop their pursuit of the Germans, ending the offensive here.|$|E
