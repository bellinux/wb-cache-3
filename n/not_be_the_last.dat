5|$|Gilmore had {{suspected}} that C. fragilis and C. agilis were the same, but Ostrom {{was able to}} demonstrate this synonymy. This greatly expanded the known material pertaining to C. fragilis, and Ostrom was able to demonstrate that Ornitholestes was quite different from Coelurus. At the time, Dale Russell had proposed that C. agilis was a species of Elaphrosaurus based on the incomplete information then published; Ostrom was also able to demonstrate {{that this was not}} the case. Additionally, he showed that one of the three vertebrae Marsh had illustrated for C. fragilis was actually a composite of two vertebrae, one of which was later shown to come from another quarry and belonged not to Coelurus but to another, unnamed small theropod. This unnamed genus would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> small theropod from the Morrison Formation to be confused with Coelurus; a later discovery (1995) of a partial skeleton in Wyoming was first thought to be a new larger specimen of Coelurus, but further study showed it belonged to a different but related genus, Tanycolagreus.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the first}} {{questions}} considered by the new Legislative Assembly of Alberta was the choice of provincial capital. The terms of autonomy had made Edmonton the provisional capital, {{but there was a}} movement to make Calgary the permanent choice. This movement was led in the legislature by Minister of Public Works William Henry Cushing, Cross's cabinet colleague, who argued that it would be cheaper to build a legislature building in Calgary than in Edmonton and that Calgary was the economic centre of the province and therefore ought to be capital. Cross countered that Edmonton's history as capital of the Canadian fur trade and its geographic location close to the centre of the province gave it the stronger claim. Edmonton was eventually selected by a vote of 16 to 8. It would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> issue on which Cross and Cushing disagreed.|$|E

The convoy's four ships were commanded by Admiral Sir Don Arturo O'Byrne, an Irish nobleman who had previously served in the Spanish Navy Marines. This was an odd occurrence at the time and many people thought it boded ill for an Irishman to control an English fleet. Indeed, the voyage was soon in trouble, as the flag captain, John Strong, a career mariner who had previously served with Sir William Phips, died while the ship was still in port. Although he was replaced by Captain Charles Gibson, this would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> of the venture's misfortunes.|$|E

25|$|However, {{during that}} same season Finley's wife sought a divorce, and would not accept {{a stake in the}} A's in a {{property}} settlement. With most of his money tied up in the A's or his insurance empire, Finley had to sell the team. He agreed in principle to sell to businessman Marvin Davis, who would have moved the Athletics to Denver. However, just before Finley and Davis were due to sign a definitive agreement, the Raiders announced their move to Los Angeles. Oakland and Alameda County officials {{let it be known that}} they would not allow any prospective owner to break the Coliseum lease, forcing Davis to call off the deal. Forced to turn to local buyers, Finley sold the A's to San Francisco clothing manufacturer Walter A. Haas, Jr., president of Levi Strauss & Co. prior to the 1981 season.

25|$|Bridgeton's most {{successful}} times were now behind them, {{and though they}} maintained their league status for the next 20 years, they never challenged for major honours again. In 1960, New Barrowfield was subject to another housing CPO by the city fathers and Waverley were again forced to move, this time to Carntyne Stadium a mile to the north, which was more suited to greyhound racing and speedway. By this point, many of the local Junior clubs were in financial difficulty; distractions of modern living had made attending matches less appealing, and Glasgow's housing improvement programme was in full swing, {{with much of the}} population of the crowded, substandard tenements decanted to new overspill estates on the edge of town – for East End residents this typically meant Easterhouse and Cranhill, although no new Junior teams were established in these vast schemes. Shawfield had folded in 1960, and Bridgeton Waverley followed in 1962. They would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>last,</b> with Parkhead ceasing operations in 1963, Strathclyde in 1965 and Dennistoun Waverley in 1968. Housing was never built on New Barrowfield as had been planned; it became the training ground for Celtic for the next 40 years and still contains football pitches. Housing now occupies the Carntyne site as well as the Dennistoun ground, the hospital and the Strathclyde ground (which formed part of the Athletes' Village for the 2014 Commonwealth Games), while the Parkhead site is a public park and the Shawfield F.C. ground was bulldozed for the M74 motorway extension.|$|E
25|$|In 1863, Edgerton was appointed, by President Abraham Lincoln, {{to be the}} Chief Justice of the Territory of Idaho. His {{salary was}} to be $2,500 a year (about $34,000 in 2009). He left with his wife, his children, his niece, Lucia Darling, his nephew, Wilbur F. Sanders, Sanders' wife, Sanders' children, a family friend, Henry Tilden, and a young woman named Almarette Greer. Edgerton's group first {{travelled}} to Cleveland, Ohio, by train, they then traveled, by boat, across Lake Erie, continuing, by train, to St. Joseph, Missouri, they then travelled, by steamboat, to Omaha, Nebraska. They then bought their provisions, and began their trip on ox-drawn wagons. The party was met by good weather, and no bad confrontations with Native Americans. The group stopped at Chimney Rock, to visit. They then started off again, on their trip. One incident that did happen was when Edgerton fell {{from one of the}} wagons, and was almost crushed by one of the wheels. The group arrived at South Pass, in August 1863. After arriving in South Pass City, Edgerton received a telegraph message saying that the capital of the Territory of Idaho had yet to be decided. On August 15, as the group was heading west, a man arrived with a telegraph message saying that the capital of the Territory of Idaho was to be at Lewiston. The message was welcome news to the group, but knew that to get to Lewiston, before the snows, would be difficult. As the group descended the western slopes of the Rocky Mountains, it was discovered that Mary Edgerton was pregnant. In September, the group arrived at the trail, beginning at the Blackfoot River. Edgerton realized, {{that it would not be}} possible to make it to Lewiston, before the snows. The group then changed its course for Bannack. The party crossed the Snake River, by ferry, on September 6. After crossing, they met Sheriff Henry Plummer. This would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> meeting between Edgerton and Plummer. The group continued, and crossed Monida Pass. The group finally made it to Bannack, on September 16.|$|E

500|$|Regardless of who {{posed for}} Longacre, the facial {{features}} of the [...] "Indian" [...] are essentially Caucasian, meaning that a White woman wears the headdress of a Native American man. Longacre had, in 1854, designed the three-dollar piece with a female with similar features (also supposedly based on the museum sculpture) but a more fanciful headdress, and adapted that design for the gold dollar. Officials were aware of this artistic license {{at the time of}} issue; Snowden, in his November 1858 letter to Cobb, characterizes the two earlier coins as [...] "the artists at the Mint evidently not realizing the absurd incongruity of placing this most masculine attribute of the warrior brave on the head of a woman". Longacre would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> to juxtapose the features of a White woman with an Indian headdress reserved for men; Augustus Saint Gaudens, for the Indian Head eagle (1907), produced a similar design. [...] Later issues depict more accurate Indians, including Bela Lyon Pratt's Indian Head gold pieces (1908), the Buffalo nickel (1913) by James Earle Fraser, who worked from Native American models, and the Oregon Trail Memorial half dollar (1926), designed by Fraser and his wife Laura.|$|E
