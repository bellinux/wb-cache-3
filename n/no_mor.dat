The median spatial separation of galaxy pairs contributing to a fraction p of the angular correlation signal in a galaxy survey is denoted by r p eff (§ 3) and compared with the perpendicular distance, r⊥, at the median redshift, zmed, of the galaxies.

Methods: From September 1999 to May 2003, 11, 447 consecutive colonoscopic exam-inations were performed in 9864 patients, totaling 5355 endoscopic polypec-tomies for colorectal polypoid neoplasms. According to the macroscopic characteristics, the neoplasms were classified into protruded (n = 3953) and sessile (n = 1402) ones. A snare polypectomy {{was conducted on}} 3987 lesions and hot biopsy forceps removal on 1368 lesions. Results: Histological diagnoses included 4456 neoplastic lesions (4282 adenomas and 174 adenocarcinomas) and 899 non-neoplastic lesions (889 hyperplastic and 10 inflamed polyps).

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to investigate the relationship between the arrangement of wood strands at the surface of oriented strand board (OSB) and the modulus of rupture (MOR) determined by applying the technique of image analysis (IA). Fiber orientation was measured manually. In addition a CCD (charge coupled device) digital camera was used to automatically measure the fiber orientation at the surface of OSB. The total number of OSB samples evaluated was equal to 55, but variation in density was small and the coefficient of variation was only 4 %. In contrast, the variation in MOR is wide and the coefficient of variation is 17 %. Thus, the variation in density of OSB does not reflect variations in MOR. The relationship between the MOR and the average angle of fiber orientation resulted in a weak negative correlation (r = - 0. 44) as might be expected, as better axial orientation should improve MOR. The average strand area gave <b>no</b> correlation with <b>MOR.</b> Clearly, large strands which should enhance MOR may be heavily disoriented, whereas small strands which have less influence on the MOR might be well oriented. Hence <b>no</b> correlation between <b>MOR</b> and average strand area is observed. The prediction of MOR by using a multiple linear regression equation including density and fiber orientation factors is only moderately successful. Hence another factor must be identified to predict MOR accurately. The CCD camera measures fiber orientation at the OSB surface effectively...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the more}} disconcerting “negative ” results {{in the theory of}} welfare {{economics}} was articulated by Richard Lipsey and Kelvin Lancaster in 1956 in their paper “The General Theory of Second Best”. They demonstrated that if there are “distortions ” in more than one market, even in a one-consumer economy, it may not be beneficial to remove a distortion in a single market if distortions remain in other markets. To policy economists this observation might seem a devastating criticism of recommendations for “piecemeal reform”. In 1970, Edward Foster and Hugo Sonnenschein discovered a remarkable result that removes some of the sting of the Lipsey-Lancaster observation. They proved that under reasonably general circumstances, at least one kind of “piecemeal reform”, namely “radial ” or proportional reductions in all distortions, would improve welfare in a oneconsumer, general equilibrium economy. This paper by Trout Rader extends the Foster-Sonnenschein result in important and interesting ways. 1 Foster and Sonnenschein required that the production possibility set be the intersection of a half-space with the non-negative orthant.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} periodic graph exploration in which a mobile entity with constant memory, an agent, has to visit all n nodes of an input simple, connected, undirected graph in a periodic manner. Graphs {{are assumed to be}} anonymous, that is, nodes are unlabeled.

We are interested in algorithms for assigning the port numbers together with traversal algorithms for agents using these port numbers to obtain short traversal periods. Periodic graph exploration is unsolvable if the port numbers are set arbitrarily, see [1]. However, surprisingly small periods can be achieved by carefully assigning the port numbers. Dobrev et al.

30|$|It is {{apparent}} that {{there are very few}} islands close to divergent plate boundaries in the Pacific, largely because both the crests and (steep-sided) flanks of most mid-ocean (or back-arc basin) ridges are in deep ocean. Following island formation at the crests, islands are generally carried into deeper water and often may not reach the surface until they cross a lithospheric swell, for instance, which may be thousands of kilometers from the plate boundary at which they originated. For this reason, divergent plate boundary islands are comparatively few and usually emergent only when other processes have contributed to their upgrowth. Examples from the Pacific Basin were once thought to include Easter Island, which is close to the mid-ocean ridge (MOR) named the East Pacific Rise, but <b>no</b> evidence of <b>MOR</b> basalts is found there (Ray et al. 2012).

In this investigation, gene expression of Hsp 70 and other heat shock genes in the rat brain was studied in response to morphine. Twenty milligrams per kilogram morphine intraperitoneally resulted in a marked induction of Hsp 70 messenger RNA (mRNA) expression in the frontal cortex with a maximum increase of 13. 2 -fold after 2 hours. A moderate increase of Hsp 27 mRNA expression (6. 7 -fold) could be observed after 4 hours, whereas mRNA expression of Hsp 90 and of the constitutive Hsc 70 did not exceed a mean factor of 1. 8 -fold during the 24 hours interval. The increase in Hsp 70 mRNA was dose dependent, showing a significant elevation after doses ranging from 10 to 50 mg/kg morphine. In situ hybridization revealed enhanced Hsp 70 mRNA expression mainly in cortical areas, in the hippocampus, in the paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei of the hypothalamus, in the locus coeruleus, {{as well in the}} pineal body. The double in situ hybridization technique revealed increased Hsp 70 mRNA expression mainly in VGLUT 1 -positive neurons {{and to a lesser extent}} in olig 1 -positive oligodendroglia. Immunohistochemistry revealed a marked increase of Hsp 70 protein in neuronal cells and blood vessels after 12 hours. In contrast to animal experiments, morphine did not increase Hsp 70 mRNA expression in vitro in μ-opioid receptor (MOR 1) –expressing human embryonic kidney 293 cells, suggesting <b>no</b> direct <b>MOR</b> 1 -mediated cellular effect. To exclude a body temperature–related morphine effect on Hsp 70 mRNA expression, the temperature was recorded. Five to 20 mg/kg resulted in hyperthermia (maximum 40. 6 °), whereas a high dose (50 mg/kg) that produced the highest mRNA induction, showed a clear hypothermia (minimum 37. 2 °C). These findings argue against the possibility that Hsp 70 induction by morphine is caused by its effect on body temperature. It may be speculated that increased expression of Hsp 70 after morphine application protects brain structures against potentially hazardous effects of opiates...|$|R
40|$|We have earlier {{presented}} a joint source-channel coding (JSCC) method for 2 : 1 bandwidth reduction [1], a method we have called Shannon mappings.

Since the JSCC symbols are continuous-amplitude, some form of digitising or transcoding is necessary before transmission on the digital network. Instead of decoding the JSCC symbols and subsequently applying a digital source coder, we propose using a uniform scalar quantization directly on the received channel symbols. The quantizer can be either be applied at the receiver side, maintaining the scheme from [1], or it can be applied at the transmitter with jointly optimised JSCC and quantization. In the latter case, we give a model for the total distortion and solve this numerically with Matlab’s optimisation toolbox.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that the {{complexity}} of testing the correctness of an arbitrary update to a database view can be far greater than the complexity of testing a corresponding update to the main schema.

The question thus arises as to whether there is a more tractable relationship between these two complexities in the presence of such a protocol. In this paper, this question is addressed for closed update strategies, which are based upon the constant-complement approach of Bancilhon and Spyratos. The approach is to address a more general question — that of characterizing the complexity of axiomatization of views, relative to the complexity of axiomatization of the main schema. For schemata constrained by denial or consistency constraints, that is, statements which rule out certain situations, such as the equalitygenerating dependencies (EGDs) or, more specifically, the functional dependencies (FDs) of the relational model, a broad and comprehensive result is obtained in a very general framework which is not tied to the relational model in any way.

Regression {{analysis of the data}} obtained using natural soil samples showed significant increase in MOR with decrease in clay content (R 2 = 0. 263) and increase in ECe (R 2 = 0. 210), but they rendered very low accountability of the variation of <b>MOR.</b> <b>No</b> correlation was found between MOR and SAR or ESP.

Both models gave a base line MOR value (intercept) that can be used as an index for identifying a hard-setting soil. However, the linear model was preferred because unlike the other one, it gives a sodium sensitivity value (slope) independent of SAR. According to the criterion set previously by Aylmore and Sills (1982), the Aridisol is a hard setting soil; and although the Gezira Vertisols gave relatively high base line MOR value, they did not meet the criterion even under an ionic environment most conducive to dispersion.

Assessing the impact of fungal decay in wood structures poses a major challenge for building inspectors. Although models have been developed to predict degradation rate of building components in varying climatic conditions, most are hampered by the lack of fundamental data on effects of fungal attack on engineering properties. Developing data on degradation rates in differing conditions would help enhance these models. The ability of two brown-rot and one white-rot fungus to degrade wood of three species was assessed in varying temperature and moisture conditions. Modulus of elasticity (MOE) was the most sensitive measure of fungal attack, whereas modulus of rupture (MOR) was affected more slowly. Wood species had <b>no</b> effect on <b>MOR</b> losses, but wood durability did influence fungal effects on MOR. The white-rot fungus caused comparable MOE losses to the brown-rot fungi but had a much decreased effect on MOR. Moisture content, within the range tested, had little influence on decay rates. Fungal effects tended to be slower at the lowest temperature tested (15 °C) but differed little between 25 and 35 °C. Results suggested that removal of wood that has been wet for some time is advisable if dynamic properties are critical. Results also supported incorporating temperature and time of wetting factors into building models...|$|R
40|$|The dopaminergic and opioid peptide systems {{interact}} in many nuclei of the brain. In the striatum, dopamine/opioid peptide interactions modulate locomotor and motivated behaviors {{as well as}} reward, motivational, and tolerance processes in opiate dependence. Dopamine D 4 receptors (D 4 R) and -opioid receptors (MOR) are highly concentrated in the striosomes (islands) of the striatum, suggesting the existence of receptor-receptor interactions between them. In the present work we studied the role of D 4 R in modulating MOR expression in the islands by using immunohistochemistry and image analysis. The activation of D 4 R by the agonist PD 168, 077 (1 mg/kg) decreased MOR immunoreactivity (IR) in the striosomes 6 hours after drug treatment. MOR IR levels had recovered 12 hours later. Treatment with a D 4 R antagonist (L 745, 870, 1 mg/kg) blocked downregulation of MOR IR, showing that the D 4 R agonist effects observed were specific. Furthermore, treatment with the D 2 /D 3 receptor agonist quinpirol (1 mg/kg) and D 2 /D 3 receptor antagonist raclopride (1 mg/kg) had <b>no</b> effect in <b>MOR</b> IR, suggesting that D 4 R is the only D 2 -like receptor producing an MOR downregulation in the islands.

Material and Methods: Ninety-two patients with GTD were evaluated prospectively. Patients were divided into four groups as complete mole, partial mole, invasive mole and choriocarcinoma. All patients were evaluated for persistence by clinical, ultrasound and laboratory findings. Methotrexate+folinic acid were administered to the patients with persistent disease. Combined chemotherapy protocols were applied to patients with <b>no</b> <b>mor</b> minimum response. Hysterectomy was performed on older patients who had no desire for a child. Results: Molar pregnancy and gestational choriocarcinoma rates were 4. 8 / 1000 and 2 / 10, 000 respectively. Mean age and mean beta-hCG levels {{were higher in the}} invasive mole group. Theca–lutein cysts and excessive uterine enlargement were detected in a higher proportion of patients with complete or invasive mole. These findings were seen more frequently in cases with persistence. Conclusion: Persistent GTD can be predicted by clinical and biochemical markers. Risk of the development of persistence is lower in patients under the age of 35, in the absence of theca-lutein cysts and hCG level below 100, 000 IU. In addition, negative predictive value of hCG level shows low risk of persistence to the same extent as negative predictive value of combination of parameters.

40|$|In the brain, the mu-opioid {{receptor}} (MOR) activates neural {{nitric oxide synthase}} (nNOS) through the PI 3 K/Akt pathway. The resulting nitric oxide (NO) enhances {{the function of the}} glutamate N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) /calcium and calmodulin-dependent serine/threonine kinase (CaMKII), which subsequently diminishes MOR signaling strength. Because the ERK 1 / 2 cascade is implicated in opioid tolerance, we analyzed the role of morphine-generated NO in this negative regulation. We found that NO-released endogenous zinc ions recruit the Ras/Raf- 1 /ERK 1 / 2 cassette to histidine triad nucleotide-binding protein 1 (HINT 1). A-Raf and B-Raf showed little or <b>no</b> <b>MOR</b> association. The zinc ions bridge the Raf- 1 cysteine-rich domain (CRD) with HINT 1 at the MOR C-terminus. Morphine also recruits PKCγ via NO/zinc to the MOR-HINT 1 complex. Both Raf- 1 and PKCγ CRDs bind simultaneously to HINT 1, enabling PKCγ to enhance Raf- 1 function to intensify MEK/ERK 1 / 2 activation. Thus, through attached HINT 1, the MOR facilitates the cross-talk of two NO- and zinc-regulated signal-transduction pathways, PKC/Src and Raf- 1 /ERK 1 / 2, implicated in the negative control of morphine effects.

Therefore, the anchor effect of the isocyanate resin was not fully manifested presumably, resulting in reduced bonding strength. Moreover, air injection blew the isocyanate resin away from the particle surface and caused a local reduction of bonding strength, thereby presumably further reducing the bonding strength. The reduced bonding strength was lower than the vapor pressure. As a result, small local blowouts occurred and caused the local destruction of bonding points. Lowering the air pressure could prevent local destruction somewhat, but not entirely. An important future task is to prevent the local destruction of bonding points.|$|R
40|$|We are {{interested}} in the allosteric modulation of neuronal nic-otinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). We have postulated that the anthelmintic morantel (Mor) positively modulates (po-tentiates) rat 32 receptors through a site located at the () /() interface that is homologous to the canonical agonist site (J Neurosci 29 : 8734 – 8742, 2009). On this basis, we aimed to determine the site specificity by studying differences in mod-ulation between 32 and 42 receptors. We also compared modulation by Mor with that of the related compound oxantel (Oxa). Whereas Mor and Oxa each potentiated 32 receptors 2 -fold at saturating acetylcholine (ACh) concentrations, <b>Mor</b> had <b>no</b> effect on 42 receptors, and Oxa inhibited ACh-evoked responses. The inhibition was noncompetitive, but not due to open channel block. Furthermore, {{the nature and extent of}} modulation did not depend on subunit stoichiometry. We studied six positions at the () interface that differ between 3 and 4. Two positions (3 Ile 57 and 3 Thr 115) help mediate the effects of the modulators but do not seem to contribute to specificity. Mutations in two others (3 Leu 107 and 3 Ile 117) yielded receptors with appreciable 4 -character; that is, Mor potentiation was reduced compared with wild-type 32 con-trol and Oxa inhibition was evident. A fifth position (3 Glu 113) was unique in that it discriminated between the two com-pounds, showing <b>no</b> change in <b>Mor</b> potentiation from control but substantial Oxa inhibition. Our work has implications for rational drug design for nicotinic receptors and sheds light on mechanisms of allosteric modulation in nAChRs, especially the subtle differences between potentiation and inhibition...|$|R
40|$|The Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas, {{has been}} present in Europe {{since it was}} {{introduced}} in 1964 for aquacultural purposes in the Netherlands, from where it has since spread extensively. This study revisits eight locations {{in the western part}} of the Limfjord, Denmark, that were examined for the presence of C. gigas in 2006, to determine how the population of Pacific oysters has developed in the five intervening years. Densities where found to have declined at all but two locations on <b>Mors.</b> <b>No</b> systematic differences where found between locations or years on average shell lengths, condition indices or DW. No clear pattern of change is seen in the number or distribution of shell size classes. The similarities between locations on shell sizes, age distributions, dry weights and condition indices point towards one coherent population instead of several distinct populations. Although a survey shows that the population has not moved further eastwards to Fur, the Pacific oyster is still present in the eastern Limfjord. The decrease in densities at most locations may be due to two harsh preceding winters in 2009 / 10 and 2010 / 11. Reproduction in the population appears continuous, however the optimal environmental conditions for settlement and growth do not seem to be met. The present study found no results that indicate that the Pacific oyster is a cause for concern to the Limfjord ecosystem. This is liable to change, though, if rising temperatures and several mild winters make the physical conditions ideal for a rapid population expansion...|$|R
