The surprise strike did <b>not</b> <b>touch</b> Colorado, which was at Puget Sound, and did not hurt Maryland very badly; however, West Virginia was severely damaged and needed a major refit at minimum.|$|E
5|$|Discussions {{proceeded}} rapidly {{during the}} week, but did <b>not</b> <b>touch</b> {{on the issue}} of Lisbon until the fifth day, 26 July, when Hughes and Johnston met with Smith, Deputy Prime Minister Clifford Dupont, and Trade and Industry Minister George Rudland. Dupont opened the discussion by referring to Sandys' statement from 1963, which said the Rhodesian government would retain any rights previously granted to the Federation, which Dupont reasoned surely included the ability given in 1957 to appoint its own overseas agents if it informed Britain. As Portugal had indicated its willingness to accept a Rhodesian diplomat, Dupont said, the Rhodesian government was acting perfectly within its rights.|$|E

5|$|Special state service flags {{are used}} by state-employed civil {{special-purpose}} ships while on duty. These flags all follow the same basic design; a white flag with a horizontal stripe whose width is 1/5 of the flag's width. In the middle, each flag is emblazoned with the national coat of arms superimposed on a golden or yellow anchor whose height is 3/5 of the flag's width. The middle stripe is broken {{in the middle and}} does <b>not</b> <b>touch</b> the anchor or the arms. The type of special service performed by the ship is indicated by the color of the middle stripe.|$|E
5|$|The ritual was {{normally}} performed between Michaelmas and Easter, when {{cold weather}} made it {{less likely to}} contract a disease from the infected subject. It was believed that the treatment {{was more likely to}} be successful if performed on a holy day. English monarchs generally touched less frequently than their French counterparts. Edward I touched up to 1,736 people annually, but did <b>not</b> <b>touch</b> during his frequent military campaigns abroad. His immediate successors followed a similar pattern.|$|E

5|$|On 8 June 1972 the National Assembly of Bhutan {{approved}} Resolution 28, bringing {{into effect}} National Flag Rules {{drafted by the}} Cabinet. The rules have eight provisions covering the description and symbolism of the flag's colouring, fields and design elements. Other rules relate {{to the size of}} the flag as well as flag protocol including the appropriate places and occasions for flying the flag and who may display the flag on cars. In general, the flag is given as much respect as the Bhutanese state and the head of state. As in the United States Flag Code, no other flags must be placed higher than the Bhutanese flag, the flag cannot be used as a cover or drape (with some exceptions) and the flag must <b>not</b> <b>touch</b> the ground. Other provisions include prohibitions on including the design in other objects or in a logo. Exceptionally, the flag may be used to drape coffins, but only those of high-ranking state officials such as ministers or military personnel.|$|E
5|$|Several {{women in}} Carnivàle {{are tied to}} Avatars, but only two have Avataric blood: Belyakov's {{daughter}} Iris is a Vectorus by definition, and Justin's daughter Sofie is the Omega. Although Sofie is {{two years older than}} Ben, her father's Avataric generation places her in the next Avataric generation. The other affected women are human mothers who began to suffer from mental illness or strange behavior after giving birth to an Avatar. Ben's mother Flora was a religious fanatic who would <b>not</b> <b>touch</b> her son. Scudder's mother Emma cut her eyes out and killed several of her family members the night Scudder was born. Sofie's mother Apollonia became catatonic after Sofie's birth. Justin's and his older sister Iris's mother receives no special mention in the series, but the Pitch Document mentions her chronic paranoid schizophrenia after Justin's birth. As far as known, none of these mothers became pregnant after giving birth to an Avatar.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) and Jim Halpert's (John Krasinski) pranking {{has caused}} Cathy Simms (Lindsey Broad) to ask Andy {{to move her}} to a {{different}} desk. In turn, Andy orders Dwight and Jim to quit their childish behavior. He tells them that the next one to pull a prank will lose their Christmas bonus, and {{the target of the}} prank will get the prankster's share. Wanting to double their bonuses, both Dwight and Jim attempt to frame the other. Jim loudly releases his credit card information hoping Dwight will steal it and buy something ridiculous. However, Dwight orders a $200 bouquet of flowers for Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer). Dwight then puts a porcupine in his desk and blames Jim. However, a verbal slip-up causes him to inadvertently reveal his intentions. Jim, in retaliation, defaces a picture of his daughter CeCe, and blames Dwight. After Andy says such vandalism is grounds for termination, Jim admits he staged the crime. Acknowledging that his plan has backfired, Andy tells Jim that he will <b>not</b> <b>touch</b> their bonuses, and just wants their behavior to not interfere with their job performances. Jim assures him he will tell Dwight, but purposefully neglects to do so. Dwight thus continues to pull pranks on himself, to Jim's amusement.|$|E

5|$|Prior to {{the start}} of the game, Derek Jeter and Albert Pujols were named winners of the Hank Aaron Award for their {{offensive}} performances in 2009. This was the first game to test manager Joe Girardi's decision to use a three-man starting rotation, as CC Sabathia started the game on three days rest, a shorter period than he normally got during the regular season. Jeter led the game off with a single and advanced to third base on a double by Johnny Damon. Jeter scored via a Mark Teixeira ground out and Alex Rodriguez was hit by a pitch. Rodriguez was hit twice the night before and the umpires issued warnings to both benches. Jorge Posada then added to the Yankees lead that inning with a sacrifice fly. The Phillies answered quickly, scoring a run on successive doubles by Shane Victorino and Chase Utley in the bottom of the first. Sabathia intentionally walked Jayson Werth, but escaped the inning without further scoring. The Phillies tied the game in the bottom of the fourth as Ryan Howard singled, stole second, and scored on a single by Pedro Feliz. Although the run counted, instant replay of Howard's slide later showed that he did <b>not</b> <b>touch</b> home plate.|$|E
5|$|The Yankees {{opened the}} scoring {{in the first}} inning with two runs, but the Phillies {{answered}} with back-to-back doubles by Shane Victorino and Chase Utley {{in the bottom of the}} inning. The Phillies tied the game in the bottom of the fourth as Ryan Howard singled, stole second, and scored on a single by Pedro Feliz. Replays showed that Howard did <b>not</b> <b>touch</b> home plate as he slid across; however, the Yankees did not appeal. Swisher led off the fifth inning with a walk, scoring on a single by Derek Jeter, and Melky Cabrera scored on a single by Damon. Park relieved Blanton in the seventh and held the Yankees scoreless. Chase Utley hit his third home run of the series in the bottom of the seventh with two outs. Dámaso Marte struck out Howard to end the inning. After a game-tying home run by Feliz, Lidge entered the game in the ninth and gave up a two-out single to Damon. With Teixeira batting, Damon stole second and advanced to third as the base was uncovered due to the pull shift against Teixeira. Rodriguez put the Yankees ahead with a double to left field, scoring Damon. Posada added to that lead with a single which scored Teixeira, who had singled, and Rodriguez. Mariano Rivera entered in the bottom of the ninth and notched his second save of the series.|$|E
5|$|The fair catch kick rule states that, after {{a player}} has {{successfully}} made a fair catch or {{has been awarded}} a fair catch (as {{the result of a}} penalty such as kick catch interference), their team can attempt a kick from the spot of the catch; the NFHS also allows a kick to be made if the down following the fair catch or awarded fair catch has to be replayed. Prior to the kick, the opposing team must be lined up at least ten yards beyond the spot of the ball. The kick itself can be either a place kick or drop kick; a kicking tee cannot be used at the professional level, but use of a tee up to two inches in height is permitted at the high school level. Like other field goal attempts, the kicking team is awarded three points if the kick goes above the crossbar and between the goalposts of the opposing team's goal and did <b>not</b> <b>touch</b> a player of the offensive team after the kick. If the attempt fails, the opposing team is awarded control of the ball from the spot of the kick. The opposing team can also return the kick if it does not go out of bounds.|$|E
