Roys Oatman and his wife were killed, along with four of their children. The son, Lorenzo, was left for dead but survived, while sisters Olive and Mary Ann were later sold to Mojaves as slaves.

5|$|The Hongwu Emperor forbade eunuchs {{to learn}} how to read or engage in politics. Whether or <b>not</b> <b>these</b> {{restrictions}} were carried out with absolute success in his reign, eunuchs during the Yongle Emperor's reign and afterwards managed huge imperial workshops, commanded armies, and participated in matters of appointment and promotion of officials. The eunuchs developed their own bureaucracy that was organized parallel to but was not subject to the civil service bureaucracy. Although there were several dictatorial eunuchs throughout the Ming, such as Wang Zhen, Wang Zhi, and Liu Jin, excessive tyrannical eunuch power did not become evident until the 1590s when the Wanli Emperor increased their rights over the civil bureaucracy and granted them power to collect provincial taxes.|$|E
5|$|The {{move was}} seen as an effort by the US {{military}} to prevent an international incident by not acknowledging that US pilots had violated Chinese airspace. Debate remains as to whether or <b>not</b> <b>these</b> airspace violations were a necessity, as US pilots were able to maintain air superiority despite being outnumbered in the war, and Chinese and Soviet pilots, who could have launched similar strikes on UN ships at sea and on targets in Japan did not do so. Still, many missions into Chinese airspace were authorized during the war. Informally, it was known that US pilots regularly violated the rule in a rush to down MiGs.|$|E
5|$|While {{no studies}} have {{established}} whether or <b>not</b> <b>these</b> ants contain alarm pheromones, its relative Myrmecia gulosa {{is capable of}} inducing territorial alarm using pheromones. If proven, this would explain their ability to attack en masse. Foraging workers are regularly observed on the inflorescences of Prasophyllum alpinum (mostly pollinated by wasps of the subfamily Ichneumonidae). Although pollinia are often seen in the ants' jaw, they have a habit of cleaning their mandibles on the leaves and stems of nectar-rich plants before moving on, preventing pollen exchange. It is unknown whether jack jumper ants contribute to pollination.|$|E

5|$|From these models, {{researchers}} also predict that bee populations will start declining most {{significantly in the}} southern latitudes with lagging range expansion in the north. Kerr and his colleagues found that as the climate has shifted, bumblebees {{have been forced to}} operate outside of their thermal ranges, causing range losses along the species’ southern limits. However, the study also found that while other flora and fauna have expanded their northerly ranges to account for the climate shifts, bumblebees have not expanded farther north. The most important findings in this study came from statistical models built to study whether or <b>not</b> <b>these</b> range shifts were due to confounding factors such as pesticide use or changes in land cover. The researchers found that climate change had the most meaningful impact on range shifts and bee distributions. To support these findings, the scientists note that failure for the bumblebee to respond to thermal changes and expand their northern range underscores the idea that bumblebees are susceptible to climate change.|$|E
5|$|Historians {{and authors}} {{writing about the}} 1954 coup have debated the {{relative}} importance {{of the role of the}} United Fruit Company and the worries about communist influence (whether or <b>not</b> <b>these</b> were grounded in reality) in the U.S.'s decision to instigate the coup in 1954. Several historians have maintained that the lobbying of the UFC, and the expropriation of its lands, were the chief motivation for the U.S., strengthened by the financial ties of individuals within the Eisenhower administration to the UFC. Others have argued that the overthrow was motivated primarily by U.S. strategic interest; the knowledge of the presence of a small number of communists close to Árbenz led the U.S. to reach incorrect conclusions about the extent of communist influence. Yet others have argued that the overthrow was part of a larger tendency within the U.S. to oppose nationalist movements in the Third World. Both the role of the UFC and that of the perception of communist influence continue to be cited as motivations for the U.S.'s actions today.|$|E
5|$|In 1977, while {{a member}} of the Centre Party, Sven-Olle Olsson, a former farmer, was elected as Sjöbo's Municipal commissioner.The Centre Party in Sjöbo, led by Olsson, motioned before Sjöbo's {{municipal}} assembly in June 1987 for a referendum on the acceptance of foreign refugees in the municipality. The motion came after a proposal that fifteen refugees be accepted into the municipality, an idea Olsson disliked. It has been speculated that the reason behind the motion was <b>not</b> <b>these</b> fifteen refugees, a small number for the municipality, but, instead, Olsson's idea to create a protest against Sweden's positive stance on refugees. Despite heavy protests from most of the country, Sjöbo's municipal assembly decided in October 1987 to go through with the referendum in 1988. If the referendum passed, it would completely ban Sjöbo from accepting foreign refugees.|$|E

5|$|One synonym, Iridomyrmex greensladei, was {{described}} as a separate species from the meat ant based on the anatomical differences of its head and pronotum (the dorsal portion of the prothorax's exoskeletal plates), which are the same colour as its mesosoma. In the meat ant, the head and pronotum are usually lighter than the mesosoma. American entomologist Steve Shattuck notes that the two ants are non-sympatric (they exist in the same geographic area and regularly encounter each other), and supporting evidence to separate them as two distinct species emerged when the enzymes esterase and amylase were examined and the results show that they had different amylase allele. These examinations, however, did not take any account of any distinction in colour between populations previously known as I. greensladei and I. purpureus. For example, colonies residing in Western Australia may have lighter heads whereas those living in the eastern states have darker heads. An unpublished study examining the mitochondrial DNA did not find any distinction between eastern and western populations of I. greensladei and I. purpureus. Additional evidence suggests that the populations found in the east and west are the same species. Despite this evidence, there are several problems: forms intended to be I. greensladei were found in the Yorke Peninsula by a 1987 study, which noted that while the ants were morphologically indistinguishable from both I. greensladei and I. purpureus populations, their nests only contained a single nest hole (whereas I. purpureus nests have many). Shattuck also collected workers for his holotype and paratype specimens from Israelite Bay in Western Australia, rather than collecting those from Yorke Peninsula. The forms in Yorke Peninsula have also never been subject to study, so future research may shed light as to whether or <b>not</b> <b>these</b> ants are genetically different from the meat ant.|$|E
5|$|Petrodollar {{recycling}} {{is the international}} spending or investment of a country's revenues from petroleum exports ("petrodollars"). It generally refers to the phenomenon of major petroleum-exporting nations, mainly the OPEC members plus Russia and Norway, earning more money from the export of crude oil than they could efficiently invest in their own economies. The resulting global interdependencies and financial flows, from oil producers back to oil consumers, can reach a scale of {{hundreds of billions of}} US dollars per year – including a wide range of transactions in a variety of currencies, some pegged to the US dollar and some <b>not.</b> <b>These</b> flows are heavily influenced by government-level decisions regarding international investment and aid, with important consequences for both global finance and petroleum politics. The phenomenon is most pronounced during periods when the price of oil is historically high. The first major petrodollar surge (1974–1981) resulted in more financial complications than the second (2005–2014).|$|E
5|$|The Anderson Street {{station is}} located at the {{intersection}} with Anderson Street and Linden Avenue in Hackensack. The station has one track running through it, with one lone asphalt side platform appearing on the northbound side. The station has a nearby parking lot at the same intersection, with fifty parking spaces maintained by Park America (under lease from New Jersey Transit). Two of these fifty parking spaces are handicap accessible, although the station itself is <b>not.</b> <b>These</b> parking spots are permit-only, but are free to use on evenings and weekends. The station is located in New Jersey Transit's fifth fare zone, tickets may be purchased at the station. Except for the Metro-North Railroad Express routes to Spring Valley, all trains serve the Anderson Street station, and there is nearby access to the 175 and 770 New Jersey Transit bus lines. The station is 18 minutes from Secaucus Junction, 21 minutes from Hoboken Terminal, and 39 minutes from Spring Valley.|$|E

5|$|The {{habitat of}} the Mediterranean monk seal {{has changed over}} the years. Prior to the 20th century, Mediterranean monk seals had been known to congregate, give birth, and seek refuge on open beaches. Since sealing had ended, they have left their former habitat and now only use sea caves for such behavior. More often than <b>not,</b> <b>these</b> caves are rather {{inaccessible}} to humans due to underwater entries, and because the caves are often along remote or rugged coastlines. Scientists have confirmed this is a recent adaptation, most likely due to the rapid increase in human population, tourism, and industry, which have caused increased disturbance by humans and the destruction of the species' natural habitat. Because of these seals' shy nature and sensitivity to human disturbance, they have slowly adapted to try to avoid contact with humans completely within the last century, and, perhaps, even earlier. The coastal caves are, however, dangerous for newborns, and are causes of major mortality among pups when sea storms hit the caves.|$|E
5|$|Unlike other Novomessor species, workers forage {{early in}} the morning and late {{afternoon}}, whereas N. cockerelli and N. albisetosus forage during the afternoon and evening. However, it is unknown whether or <b>not</b> <b>these</b> ants are active during the night. Foragers first emerge from their nests at 9 A.M. and return by 5 P.M. They are rarely seen during the middle of the day when temperatures reach 95–100°F (35–38°C), although the ground temperature is considerably higher. Workers are commonly seen foraging between 9 and 11 A.M. and 3 to 5 P.M. Most workers forage on the ground, but sometimes they can be seen walking on low herbage without feeding on the plants or collecting any seeds. Excavated nests showed no evidence that these ants collect seeds, and no workers were seen collecting them or carrying them back to the nest. N. ensifer ants are solitary foragers that work 25 ft (7 m) away from their home nest. N. ensifer predominately feeds on insects they prey on, consuming dead insects such as ichneumon wasps, bembicine wasps and small moths. When a worker discovers a dead insect, it will start to pull and carry it back to the nest immediately, and other nestmates will join once they detect it. Workers do not cooperate with each other and pull the insect from all directions, accidentally tearing it apart. However, the workers will eventually have a piece of the insect left and return it to the nest. The only known predator of N. ensifer is the giant horned lizard (Phrynosoma asio). Mites and Springtail arthropods are known to dwell inside nests, but their function or purpose within a colony is unknown.|$|E
