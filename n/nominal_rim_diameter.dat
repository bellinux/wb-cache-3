5000|$|Vehicle tyres (as in {{the rest}} of the world) mark the <b>rim</b> <b>diameter</b> in inches and the width in millimetres.

50|$|After so {{many changes}} in the prior year, it is no {{surprise}} that there were few changes for 1970. Most US makes including Chrysler adopted bias belted tires. They were a short-lived hybrid that combined familiar soft riding bias body plies with tread stabilizing belts used in European style radial tires. One well known brand name at the time was Goodyear’s Polyglas. All 1970 Chryslers featured standard bias belted tires, with Town & Country wagons wearing size J78-15. J identified the second largest size available in load capacity, 78 indicated a cross-section height-to-width, or aspect ratio of 78%, and 15 being the <b>nominal</b> <b>rim</b> <b>diameter</b> in inches, as before.|$|E

50|$|It is {{classified}} as a complex crater because it features a central uplift, a transition zone, and a ring graben (a ring-shaped trough in the outer part of the crater).

50|$|One way to {{estimate}} wheel diameter {{is to add}} twice the nominal tyre cross-section to the <b>rim</b> <b>diameter.</b> For example, consider a 700c &times; 23 mm tire, which has a nominal cross-section of 23 mm. 700c wheels have a <b>rim</b> <b>diameter</b> of 622 mm. Hence the wheel diameter is (2 &times; 23 mm) + 622 mm = 668 mm which is equal to 26.3 inches (rounded to 1 decimal place). 26 inch mountain bicycle wheels have a <b>rim</b> <b>diameter</b> of 559 mm. This ignores {{factors that contribute to}} the actual rolling radius of the tyre and rim together: the vertical deflection of the tire above the contact patch and the difference between the manufacturer's stated size and the actual tire radius when mounted and inflated.|$|R

40|$|Effects of {{different}} hand <b>rim</b> <b>diameters</b> in wheelchair racing were studied {{with respect to}} physiological and technique parameters at five speed levels (N = 8 wheelchair sportsmen). In each of five subsequent 15 -min exercise tests on a treadmill, a different sized hand rim was mounted to the rear wheels (0. 3, 0. 35, 0. 38, 0. 47, 0. 56 m). In each test, speed increased with 0. 83 m. s- 1 every 3 min, starting at 0. 83 m. s- 1 and ranging up to 4. 17 m. s- 1 (slope: 0. 5 degrees). Cardiorespiratory responses (ventilation, oxygen cost, heart rate, respiratory exchange ratio, mechanical efficiency) and timing data (cycle time, push time, recovery time, push angle, and work per cycle) were obtained every 3 rd min, together with the movement pattern of trunk and arm segments. Clear effects of <b>rim</b> <b>diameter</b> and speed were seen for the physiological parameters (P less than 0. 05). In physiological terms, D 5 appeared the least beneficial, followed by D 4. Moreover, increasing <b>rim</b> <b>diameter</b> {{had a significant effect}} on movement pattern of the upper arm in the sagittal as well the frontal plane of motion. However, no timing effects were seen with changing <b>rim</b> <b>diameter.</b> On the other hand, timing parameters varied markedly with speed, whereas the segmental excursions of the upper limb did not show a "speed-effect". In general, small hand rims show lower cardiorespiratory responses. This {{may be related to the}} decreased segmental excursions of the upper limb and the lower linear hand velocity. Together with a low rolling and air drag, heart rate, and oxygen cost, these are important prerequisites in racing events. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS...|$|R
