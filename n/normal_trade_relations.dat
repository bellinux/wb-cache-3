After employing the simplified static analysis framework, the analysis based on simulations reveals that current demand for Khairpur dates will expand after the FTA and consumer surplus will increase. The drop in the domestic prices of dates will increase the production of many down stream industries, which will have pleasant multiplier effects on the economy. Overview of dates industry and results of economic analysis indicate that Pakistan will get benefit from the FTA by getting the cheaper labor for which will increase their competitiveness, and to reduce the costs of trade diversion in some commodities, the government should reduce MFN tariffs on industrial dates before implementing the FTA a key rule of multilateral trade system is the reduction in trade barriers should be applied, on a most-favored nation basis (MFN), to all WTO members.

The U. S. Con-gress also voted to grant China Permanent <b>Normal</b> <b>Trade</b> <b>Relation</b> (PNTR) status, removing another hurdle of China’s accession to WTO. It is most likely that China will be admitted to the WTO this year. Possible Impacts of WTO Accession Top Chinese leaders regard the WTO accession as {{the second most important}} change in China’s economic policy regime, following Deng Xiaoping’s reform and opening-door policy in the late 1970 s. This change will have undoubtedly profound impacts on the future course of China’s economic development. There are many discussions among academic and policy circles in China regarding the possible impacts of WTO accession on the Chinese economy. Some scholars and policymakers are very positive about the accession. They believe that any drawback will be overwhelmed by the efficiency gains, in-jecting new growth impetus into China’s reform and economic de-velopment. According to them, China will enter an entirely new de-velopment stage. However, other critics are worried that China’s weak economic base, due to the unfinished transition from a planned to a market economy, {{will not be able to}} sustain the tremendous external shocks brought about by entry to the WTO. They argue that the WTO accession will do more harm than good to the Chinese economy...|$|R
40|$|Knowledge, however defined, is {{perceived}} as firms "key" source of competitive advantage and a central determinant of productivity and wealth creation. The value of knowledge as a competitive asset is not intrinsic, but depends instead on its application, i. e. innovation or the transformation of knowledge into new technologies, products and, or services. Therefore, the extent of innovation within an economy depends crucially on the rapid diffusion of new technology and best practice, which it is argued depends in turn on building strong regional networks. So, knowledge, its distribution and diffusion - particularly through the supply chain - form the central focus of this paper. For some economies (e. g. Finland, Israel) {{with high levels of}} domestic R&D spending much of the ''new'' knowledge driving local business competitiveness is created domestically. For Ireland, both North and South, however, historically low levels of domestic R&D spending mean that inward technology transfer - primarily associated with inward investment - has been crucial to recent economic development. This suggests two main questions. First, how does the knowledge transferred to Ireland, North and South, through international inward investment compare to international best practice? And, second, to what extent does this knowledge then diffuse to other manufacturing businesses located in Ireland? A third, and related, question concerns the contrasting experiences of Ireland, North and South, particularly given the very different history of inward investment in the two areas. The analysis in the paper is based on data collected through face-to-face interviews with 94 Multi-national enterprise (MNE) plants in the South and North of Ireland. The relatively high response rates achieved {{and the fact that the}} final sample coverage resembles relatively closely that of the underlying population suggests that the sample is likely to provide results which are representative of the whole population of large MNE plants in both the South and North of Ireland. The research findings demonstrate that the potential to transfer knowledge from MNE plants to local firms through the supply chain is higher in the South of Ireland than in the North. Yet, Northern suppliers' adoption of a range of best practice techniques lags further behind their MNE plants than in the South. Therefore, larger average knowledge gaps suggest a greater potential benefit from knowledge transfers in the North of Ireland. Yet, while general contact as part of <b>normal</b> <b>trading</b> <b>relations</b> between MNE plants and their suppliers is more common in the North, contact in the South of Ireland is characterised by developmental interactions such as collaboration on product developments and quality assurance systems. Furthermore, southern MNE plants report having had a significantly greater impact on both the performance and the competitiveness of local suppliers than their Northern counterparts. ...|$|R
