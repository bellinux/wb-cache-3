However, collision risk {{is very high}} on multi axes machines when performing <b>non-cutting</b> <b>traverse</b> moves. If available, CAM systems offer limited setting options for non-cutting tool moves. In this paper an approach is presented that allows to automatically generating non-cutting tool paths. Process planners {{will not only be}} released from developing and simulating time-consuming multi axes traverse moves. The automatically calculated traverse moves will also machine-specifically optimized with respect to various optimization criteria...|$|E
