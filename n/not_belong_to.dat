5|$|The second {{approach}} {{to the problem of}} sets belonging to themselves took as its base the notion of class, and defines a set as a class which belongs to other classes, while a proper class is defined as a class which does <b>not</b> <b>belong</b> <b>to</b> other classes. Under the Zermelo–Fraenkel approach, the axioms impede the construction of a set of all sets which do <b>not</b> <b>belong</b> <b>to</b> themselves. In contrast, under the von Neumann approach, the class of all sets which do <b>not</b> <b>belong</b> <b>to</b> themselves can be constructed, but it is a proper class and not a set.|$|E

5|$|Although the heme {{proteins}} are {{the most}} important class of iron-containing proteins, the iron-sulfur proteins are also very important, being involved in electron transfer, which is possible since iron can exist stably in either the +2 or +3 oxidation states. These have one, two, four, or eight iron atoms that are each approximately tetrahedrally coordinated to four sulfur atoms; because of this tetrahedral coordination, they always have high-spin iron. The simplest of such compounds is rubredoxin, which has only one iron atom coordinated to four sulfur atoms from cysteine residues in the surrounding peptide chains. Another important class of iron-sulfur proteins is the ferredoxins, which have multiple iron atoms. Transferrin does <b>not</b> <b>belong</b> <b>to</b> either of these classes.|$|E

Ross personally through their joint connection with the club, {{it may have been}} the political connections that Joe Boyle had with the government Interior Minister of the time, Clifford Sifton, that got Dawson City the series.|$|E
