40|$|Abstract In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} the response of weed seeds to light, two experiments, at two different locations were conducted at Ferdowsi university of Mashhad in 2009. At the first experiment, field was ploughed in day and night. Weed density was evaluated 70 d after plough, with 1 × 1 quadrate. At the second experiment, at <b>night</b> <b>treatment,</b> ploughing, potato planting and weeding with cultivator were done at night. Weed sampling was done twice at 43 and 130 days after planting with 1 × 1 quadrate and weeds were identified and counted. Result showed pigweed (Amaranthus retroflexus L.), sowthistle (Sonchus oleraceus L.), crabgrass (Digitaria sanguinalis (L.) scop), jimsonweed (Datura stramonium L.) and mallow (Hibiscus trionum L.) did not observed at night plough, in contrast, night plough has no significance influence on common lambsquarters (Chenopodium album L.), and black nightshade (Solanum nigrum L.). Only common lambsquarters had similar appearance in two treatments, indicating insusceptibility of this weed to time of plough. Interestingly, at the second experiment, result was very similar. Potato yield was higher at <b>night</b> <b>treatment,</b> but not significant. This research showed that some cultural practice like plough, planting and weeding with cultivator in night can reduce weed density and weed dry matter.

40|$|Dairy Research, 2005 {{is known}} as Dairy Day, 2005 Heat stress in hot and humid environments reduces milk production, {{decreases}} reproduction, and increases health-related problems. The summertime environment in north-central Florida is especially difficult because the combination of high relative humidity and high temperature results in a temperaturehumidity index (THI) above the critical value of 72 for significant portions of the day. Previous work at Kansas State University had shown {{that the combination of}} soaking and evaporative air cooling could effectively cool heat-stressed cattle. Effectiveness of this feedline soaking, either in the afternoon and at night, or only at night, in combination with evaporative cooling was evaluated on a commercial dairy located in north-central Florida. A high-pressure fogging system and feedline soakers were installed in a typical 4 -row freestall barn equipped with tunnel ventilation creating a north to south airflow of 6 to 8 mph at the cow level. Eight lactating Holstein cows in each of two, 292 -stall pens were selected and fitted with vaginal temperature probes. Data on vaginal temperature and respiration rate were used to evaluate two cooling treatments. Barn temperature averaged 74. 8 ± 5. 4 ºF, relative humidity was 84. 6 ± 15. 4 %, and THI was 74. 7 ± 5. 3 during the study. The evaporative cooling system reduced average barn temperature by 0. 9 ºF and reduced afternoon temperatures by a maximum of 9. 2 ºF. Average respiration rates were less (58. 5 vs. 66. 9 breaths/min) in the afternoon and <b>night</b> soaking <b>treatment,</b> compared with the respiration rate of cattle in the <b>night</b> soaking <b>treatment.</b> Differences were greatest at the 10 : 00 p. m. observation (55. 0 vs. 73. 3 breaths/min). Average vaginal temperature was also less (102. 0 vs. 102. 6 °F) in the afternoon and <b>night</b> soaking <b>treatment.</b> Our results indicate that the combination of cooling the air via a highpressure fogging system and feedline soaking reduced heat stress experienced by dairy cattle.

40|$|Our {{objective}} {{was to investigate the}} physiological mechanisms involved in the sleep restriction treatment of insomnia. A multiple baseline across subjects design was used. Sleep of five participants suffering from insomnia was assessed throughout the experimentation by sleep diaries and actigraphy. Ten nights of polysomnography were conducted over five occasions. The first two-night assessment served to screen for sleep disorders and to establish a baseline for dependent measures. Three assessments were undertaken across the treatment interval, with the fifth and last one coming at follow-up. Daily cortisol assays were obtained. Sleep restriction therapy was applied in-lab for the first two <b>nights</b> of <b>treatment</b> and was subsequently supervised weekly. Interrupted time series analyses were computed on sleep diary data and showed a significantly decreased wake time, increased sleep efficiency, and decreased total sleep time. Sleepiness at night seems positively related to sleep variables, polysomnography data suggest objective changes mainly for stage 2, and power spectral analysis shows a decrease in beta- 1 and - 2 powers for the second <b>night</b> of <b>treatment.</b> Cortisol levels seem to be lower during treatment.

There are enough protein/antibody complexes commercially available that each GWSS in a field cage can be marked with a specific protein. We marked two GWSS adults and two GWSS nymphs, each separately with a unique protein and released them into small field cages (N= 60) placed in a citrus orchard for 8 hours. Each cage also contained a sentinel GWSS egg mass and an assemblage of six potential GWSS predators. The experiment contained a day and <b>night</b> <b>treatment.</b> Observed mortality for each GWSS life stage and predator species was determined by simply counting the number of survivors remaining in each cage after 8 hours. Results showed that GWSS adults were preyed upon three times more frequently than nymphs and mostly during the day light cycle. Ultimately, the gut contents of each predator will be analyzed by four protein-specific ELISAs to determine how many GWSS each individual predator consumed (note: we are currently conducting these assays). Additionally, the gut contents of each predator will be examined by a GWSS egg-specific sandwich ELISA to determine the frequency of predation on GWSS eggs...|$|E
40|$|Objective To {{evaluate}} the Bedtime Pass Program (BPP), an extinction-based procedure for treating bedtime resistance in typically developing children. Methods A randomized, controlled trial in which nineteen 3 - to 6 -year-old children demonstrating bedtime resistance {{were randomly assigned}} to a Bedtime Pass or Monitoring Control group. The experimental condition involved parent monitoring plus the Bedtime Pass: a card exchangeable for one parental visit or excused departure from the room after bedtime, with parents ignoring subsequent bids for attention. Results Children in the Bedtime Pass condition left their rooms and called and cried out significantly less frequently than controls. They demonstrated significant reductions in the time required to quiet each <b>night.</b> <b>Treatment</b> effects were maintained at 3 -month follow-up.

Effects on wild animals have been less investigated, but light at night has often been assumed to affect seasonal cycles of urban dwellers. Using light loggers attached to free-living European blackbirds (Turdus merula), we first measured light intensity at night which forest and city birds are subjected to in the wild. Then we used these measurements to test for the effect of light at night on timing of reproductive physiology. Captive city and forest blackbirds were exposed to either dark nights or very low light intensities at night (0. 3 lux). Birds exposed to light at night developed their reproductive system up to one month earlier, and also moulted earlier, than birds kept under dark nights. Furthermore, city birds responded differently than forest individuals to the light at <b>night</b> <b>treatment,</b> suggesting that urbanization can alter the physiological phenotype of songbirds.

Methods Eleven long-term compliant CPAP-treated 50 – 75 -year-old male OSA participants completed a 2 -h afternoon, simulated, realistic monotonous drive in an instrumented car, twice, following one night: (1) normal sleep with CPAP and (2) nil CPAP. Drifting out of road lane (‘incidents’), subjective sleepiness every 200 s and continuous electroencephalogram (EEG) activities indicative of sleepiness and compensatory effort were monitored. Results Withdrawal of CPAP markedly increased sleep disturbance and led to significantly more incidents, a shorter ‘safe’ driving duration, increased alpha and theta EEG power and greater subjective sleepiness. However, increased EEG beta activity indicated that more compensatory effort was being applied.

40|$|Background: Nausea and {{vomiting}} are distressing and relatively common symptoms in palliative care populations. Adequate control {{may be difficult}} to achieve, requiring multiple agents. Although a growing literature supports the use of olanzapine in management of chemotherapy induced nausea {{and vomiting}}, the published literature in palliative care populations is less extensive. Objective: The study objective was to assess the efficacy of olanzapine in the management of difficult to control nausea and vomiting in a palliative care patient population. Methods: Patients whose nausea and vomiting had not responded adequately to other antiemetics were treated with olanzapine 5 mg as a single dose at <b>night.</b> <b>Treatment</b> was considered to be successful if the patient reported an adequate improvement in their symptoms. Duration of observed treatment ranged from three days to five months. Results: Sixteen patients were treated with an evaluable outcome in 14. Of these, 13 reported a self-evaluated adequate ongoing improvement in their symptoms. One patient experienced no relief and one other experienced a return of nausea after two weeks; this patient requested a change of treatment due to unacceptable sedative effects. There were no other reports of significant adverse events. Conclusions: Olanzapine provided adequate, ongoing relief of nausea and vomiting with an acceptable adverse effect profile in 13 of 14 evaluable patients. Particularly in comparison with metoclopramide and haloperidol, olanzapine should be considered for first-line therapy for nausea and vomiting in this population.

40|$|Since years, {{research}} on SnRK 1, the major cellular energy sensor in plants, {{has tried to}} define its role in energy signalling. However, these attempts were notoriously hampered by the lethality of a complete knockout of SnRK 1. Therefore, we generated an inducible amiRNA::SnRK 1 α 2 in a snrk 1 α 1 knock out background (snrk 1 α 1 /α 2) to abolish SnRK 1 activity to understand major systemic functions of SnRK 1 signalling under energy deprivation triggered by extended <b>night</b> <b>treatment.</b> We analysed the in vivo phosphoproteome, proteome and metabolome and found that activation of SnRK 1 is essential for repression of high energy demanding cell processes such as protein synthesis. The most abundant effect was the constitutively high phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S 6 (RPS 6) in the snrk 1 α 1 /α 2 mutant. RPS 6 is a major target of TOR signalling and its phosphorylation correlates with translation. Further evidence for an antagonistic SnRK 1 and TOR crosstalk comparable to the animal system was demonstrated by the in vivo interaction of SnRK 1 α 1 and RAPTOR 1 B in the cytosol and by phosphorylation of RAPTOR 1 B by SnRK 1 α 1 in kinase assays. Moreover, changed levels of phosphorylation states of several chloroplastic proteins in the snrk 1 α 1 /α 2 mutant indicated an unexpected link to regulation of photosynthesis, {{the main energy source}} in plants.

Two different treatments in the nighttime solution concentration (D 25 /N 75, EC: 1. 8 dS m- 1; and D 25 /N 50, EC: 1. 2 dS m- 1), a day nutrient solution of EC 0. 6 dS m- 1, plus a day and <b>night</b> <b>treatment</b> with constant EC (D 50 /N 50, EC: 1. 2 dS m- 1) were applied.

Root biomass was lower with D 25 /N 75 (0. 14 vs. 0. 85 g in the other treatments). The maximum rate of leaf photosynthesis was 66 % lower with D 25 /N 75 than in the other treatments. Nitrogen, P, K, Ca, and Mg were lower in leaf tissue in the treatments with different solution concentrations where leaf NO 3 - content was reduced by approximately 75 %.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the mechanism by which oligodendrogliomas cause neuronal damage, media conditioned by G 26 / 24 oligodendroglioma cells, were fractionated into shed vesicles and vesicle-free supernatants, and added to primary cultures of rat fetal cortical neurons. After one <b>night</b> <b>treatment</b> with vesicles, a reproducible, dose-dependent, inhibitory effect on neurite outgrowth was already induced and, after 48 - 72 h of incubation, neuronal apoptosis was evident. Vesicle-free supernatants and vesicles shed by NIH- 3 T 3 cells had no inhibitory effects on neurons. Western blot analyses showed that treated neurons expressed a decreased amount of neurofilament (NF), growth-associated protein (GAP- 43) and microtubule-associated protein (MAP- 2). Moreover procaspase- 3 and - 8 were activated while Bcl- 2 expression was reduced. Vesicles were found positive for the proapoptotic molecule, Fas-ligand (Fas-L), and for the B isoform of Nogo protein, a myelin component with inhibitory effects on neurons. Nogo B involvement in the vesicle effects was analyzed both by testing the neutralizing capability of anti-Nogo antibodies and by removing the Nogo receptor from neurons by phospholipase C digestion. These treatments did not revert the vesicle effects. To test the role of Fas-L, vesicles were treated with functional anti-Fas-L monoclonals. Vesicle inhibitory and proapoptotic effects were reduced. Vesicles shed by ovarian carcinoma cells (OvCa), which are known to vehicle biologically active Fas-L, had similar effects on neurons to those of oligodendroglioma vesicles, and their inhibitory effects were also reduced by anti Fas-L antibodies. We therefore conclude that vesicles shed by G 26 / 24 cells induce neuronal apoptosis at least partially by a Fas-L mediated mechanism...|$|E

Twenty-eight multiparous cows averaging 70 ± 10 day postpartum were used in four treatments from January to March 2003. The treatments were: Day (cooling from 7 : 00 a. m. to 7 : 00 p. m.); Night (cooling from 7 : 00 p. m. to 7 : 00 a. m.); 24 -hour (cooling 24 -hour); and Control (no cooling). Wired cup test was used for clinical mastitis diagnosis, and the California Mastitis Test (CMT) was used to identify subclinical mastitis. Blood and milk samples were taken weekly for microbiological and hormonal analyses. The cortisol levels were higher than normal values in all treatment groups, suggesting stress conditions, but T 3 and T 4 levels remained normal in all groups. The occurrence of subclinical mastitis was lower in Day and Night groups than in Control and 24 -hour groups. Regarding the microbiological analyses, in all groups the isolation of Corynebacterium sp. from milk samples increased while negative coagulase staphylococci (CNS) declined as etiological agents of subclinical mastitis. However, in Day and 24 -hour groups, coagulase positive staphylococci (CPS) increased mainly Staphylococcus aureus (49. 8 % and 47. 7 % respectively).

40|$|Background: Global {{climate change}} will noticeably affect plant {{vegetative}} and reproductive development. The recent increase in temperatures has already impacted yields {{and composition of}} berries in many grapevine-growing regions. Physiological processes underlying temperature response and tolerance of the grapevine fruit have not been extensively investigated. To date, all studies investigating the molecular regulation of fleshly fruit response to abiotic stress were only conducted during the day, overlooking possible critical night-specific variations. The present study explores the night and day transcriptomic response of grapevine fruit to heat stress at several developmental stages. Short heat stresses (2 h) were applied at day and night to vines bearing clusters sequentially ordered according to the developmental stages along their vertical axes. The recently proposed microvine model (DRCF-Dwarf Rapid Cycling and Continuous Flowering) was grown in climatic chambers in order to circumvent common constraints and biases inevitable in field experiments with perennial macrovines. Post-véraison berry heterogeneity within clusters was avoided by constituting homogenous batches following organic acids and sugars measurements of individual berries. A whole genome transcriptomic approach was subsequently conducted using NimbleGen 090818 Vitis 12 X (30 K) microarrays. Results: Present work reveals significant differences in heat stress responsive pathways according to day or <b>night</b> <b>treatment,</b> in particular regarding genes associated with acidity and phenylpropanoid metabolism. Precise distinction of ripening stages led to stage-specific detection of malic acid and anthocyanin-related transcripts modulated by heat stress. Important changes in cell wall modification related processes as well as indications for heat-induced delay of ripening and sugar accumulation were observed at véraison, an effect that was reversed at later stages. Conclusions: This first day - night study on heat stress adaption of the grapevine berry shows that the transcriptome of fleshy fruits is differentially affected by abiotic stress at night. The present results emphasize the necessity of including different developmental stages and especially several daytime points in transcriptomic studies...|$|E
40|$|Protraction {{headgear}} {{has been}} used in conjunction with a palatal expansion appliance to correct Class III malocclusion with maxillary deficiency and/or mandibular prognathism. In general, 800 gm of orthopedic force is used to protract the maxilla, and 75 % of this force is transmitted to the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) area via the mandible. The effect of this heavy intermittent force on the TMJ has not been reported in the literature. The objectives of this study were to determine the level of masticatory muscle pain and EMG activity in patients treated with maxillary protraction headgear. Ten patients with skeletal Class III malocclusion whose treatment plan called for maxillary protraction headgear treatment participated in this study. Nocturnal masticatory muscle activity was determined using a portable electromyographic (EMG) recording device. Subjects wore the EMG device 14 <b>nights</b> before <b>treatment,</b> 14 <b>nights</b> during <b>treatment,</b> and 14 <b>nights</b> 1 month after active treatment.

40|$|Preliminary work {{in humans}} {{suggests}} that extraocular light can shift circadian phase. If confirmed, extraocular light {{may be of}} therapeutic benefit {{in the treatment of}} circadian-related sleep disorders with the advantage over ocular exposure that it can be administered while subjects are asleep. In sleeping subjects, however, the effect of extraocular light exposure on circadian phase has yet to be fully tested. Likewise, there is limited data on the acute effects of extraocular light on sleep and body temperature that may influence its clinical utility. Thirteen subjects [3 F, 10 M; mean (SD) age = 22. 1 (3. 0) y] participated in a protocol that totaled 7 nights in the laboratory consisting of a screening phase measurement night followed 1 week later by two counterbalanced experimental sessions each of 3 consecutive <b>nights</b> (habituation, <b>treatment,</b> and posttreatment phase measurement night) separated by 4 days. Saliva was collected for melatonin measurement every half hour from 1800 to 0300 h on the screening night and both the posttreatment phase measurement <b>nights.</b> On the <b>treatment</b> <b>nights,</b> continuous measures of rectal temperature and polysomnographic sleep were collected and overnight urine for measurement of total nocturnal urinary 6 -sulphatoxymelatonin excretion. To test for the phase-delaying effects of extraocular light, subjects received either placebo or extraocular light (11, 000 lux) behind the right knee from 0100 to 0400 h. Treatment had no significant effect on the onset of saliva melatonin secretion, phase of nocturnal core body temperature, or urinary 6 -sulfatoxymelatonin excretion, but a small increase was observed in wakefulness over the light administration period. In summary, extraocular light was not shown to delay circadian phase but was shown to increase wakefulness.

30|$|The Crigler-Najjar {{syndrome}} is extremely rare genetic disease affecting the metabolisms of bilirubin, {{resulting in a}} form of non-hemolytic jaundice [1]. This disease is caused by lack of expression of UDP glucuronosyltransferase 1 -A 1. Hence, there is no response to treatment with phenobarbital. The only available treatment is phototherapy, which involves radiation of patients with the blue light for an extensive time every day, usually whole <b>night.</b> Similar <b>treatment</b> is used for jaundice in new born babies. However, the blue light treatment is fully effective only with babies and youngsters, as with older people the blue light skin penetration is decreasing. Thus, {{there is a need}} for alternative treatments for Crigler-Najjar syndrome.|$|R
40|$|Activated sludge {{obtained}} from the <b>night</b> soil <b>treatment</b> plant was immobilized using acrylamide and nitrification and the BOD removal of the sewage were studied by using the immobilized activated sludge which was packed in a single treatment tank. The findings indicated that the ratio of nitrification in the immobilized gel tank was larger than that in the free activated sludge tank in every operation period, {{and the rate of}} BOD removal in the immobilized gel tank was roughly equal to that in the free activated sludge tank in this condition. The findings indicated that the application of immobilized activated sludge to the sewage treatment enabled the sewage treatment process to be more efficiency and compact...|$|R
40|$|Wheat {{residues}} {{management and}} modification in tillage time are among suggested practices in weed control. To evaluate {{the effects of}} wheat residues and tillage time on weed dry matter and leaf area, corn dry matter and corn grain yield, a study was conducted at Darab Agriculture and Natural Resource College, Shiraz University during growing season of 2008 - 2009. This experiment was conducted in a split plot arrangement based on randomized complete block design with four replications. Tillage time was considered as main plot at two levels of plowing at day time and during the night and residue rates were sub plot at four levels; 0 (control), 25 %, 50 % and 75 % of left wheat residues (3 t. ha- 1). The {{results showed that the}} tillage time had significant effects on corn dry matter and corn grain yield and also on weed dry matter. The highest grain yield and dry matter of corn and the lowest weed dry matter was obtained from <b>night</b> tillage <b>treatment.</b> The final number of common lambsquarter (Chenopodium album L.), foxtail (Setaria spp.) at <b>night</b> tillage <b>treatment</b> was 38. 6 and 22 % lower than that of day tillage, respectively. These differences were significant at 5 % probability level. Final number and dry matter of weed, were reduced significantly (p≤ 0. 01) by using wheat residues. The interactive effects of tillage and crop residue on measured traits were not significant. It was concluded that to achieve the highest grain yield of corn and to suppress the weed on the similar agro-climatic conditions, night tillage and application of 50 % of wheat residues might be recommended...|$|R
40|$|This article {{describes}} {{the case of a}} 16 -year-old boy with cystic fibrosis who presented with difficulty seeing in the dark. He had a history of bowel surgery at birth, and he developed cystic fibrosis liver disease and osteopenia during his teenage years. He always had good lung function. When his serum vitamin A level was checked, it was undetectable in sample. He was diagnosed with night blindness and commenced on high-dose vitamin A. His symptoms resolved within 3 days. However, it took over 1 year for his vitamin A level to return to normal. This case emphasizes the importance of monitoring vitamin levels in cystic fibrosis to detect deficiency and prevent long-term consequences, and it highlights the challenges encountered during the course of <b>night</b> blindness <b>treatment...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} removal efficiencies of contaminants in <b>night</b> soil <b>treatment</b> plant using the B 3 system. The samples were collected from retaining tank and settlement tank in Yechon night soil plant. We experimented concentrations of BOD, COD, SS, TN and TP. Concentration data were processed using removal efficiencies by season and correlation analysis with pilot running parameters. Removal efficiencies of total organic carbon was over 96 %, TN was 98 % during summer, 80. 9 % during winter. In the case of TP, the highest removal efficiencies was 94. 1 % during fall and the lowest removal efficiencies was 82 % during spring. Results of correlation analysis showed two positive correlation groups and one negative group. Positiv...|$|R
