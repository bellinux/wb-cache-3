5|$|In 1969, Wilder {{relocated}} to Paris, accepting {{a leading role}} in Bud Yorkin's Start the Revolution Without Me, a comedy that took place during the French Revolution. After shooting ended, Wilder returned to New York, where he read the script for Quackser Fortune Has a Cousin in the Bronx and immediately called Sidney Glazier, who produced The Producers. Both men began searching for the perfect director for the film. Jean Renoir was the first candidate, but he would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> the film for at least a year, so British-Indian director Waris Hussein was hired. With Margot Kidder co-starring with Wilder, it was filmed on location in Dublin, and at the nearby Ardmore Studios, in August and September 1969.|$|E
5|$|Casting {{began in}} October 2007, when Priyanka Chopra signed {{to play the}} lead role in the film. Chopra {{initially}} refused the role, feeling she would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it justice. Six months later, she agreed {{to appear in the}} film because of Bhandarkar's confidence in her. The media reported that Chopra was unhappy with the first draft of the film and wanted script changes before signing the film. Bhandarkar was also unhappy with the first draft and agreed to rewrite the script. Kangana Ranaut was cast as the film's second lead; she was pleased with the script and found it challenging, interesting and exciting. In December 2007, Arbaaz Khan and Arjan Bajwa were cast opposite Chopra. After confirming the principal cast, the media reported that Bhandarkar was having difficulty casting the male roles, including that of a homosexual clothing designer. Samir Soni and Harsh Chhaya were cast as the homosexual designers, and model Mugdha Godse was cast in a supporting role. According to Godse, Bhandarkar offered her a part when they were shooting a jewellery advertisement; a year later, she agreed to appear in the film. The Hindustan Times said that several models and designers played themselves, giving the film the appearance of a documentary.|$|E
5|$|During the {{beginning}} of World War II, President Franklin D. Roosevelt had re-introduced the draft (conscription) in September 1940, and Koval registered for it on January 2, 1941. Raven Electric Company secured him a year's deferment from service until February 1942. According to historian Vladimir Lota, Koval's handlers wanted him to steal information about chemical weapons, and felt that he would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so while drafted. When the deferment expired, Koval {{was inducted into the}} United States Army. He received basic training at Fort Dix in New Jersey before being sent to the Citadel in Charleston, South Carolina. There, Koval served as a private in the 3410th Specialized Training and Reassignment Unit. On August 11, 1943, he was transferred to the Army Specialized Training Program, a unit established in December 1942 to provide talented enlistees with an education and technical training. Koval attended the City College of New York (CCNY) and studied electrical engineering. His CCNY classmates looked up to the older Koval as a role model and father figure who never did homework and was a noted ladies' man, never knowing about his Soviet education and wife. Colleagues recalled that he never discussed politics or the Soviet Union.|$|E

5|$|Ripley's {{performance}} in the first series won her a nomination for Best TV Comedy Actress at the British Comedy Awards 1999. For her {{performance in}} the third series (2000), in which her character separates from her husband and dates another man (played by Ben Miles), she was nominated for the British Academy Television Award for Best Actress. During pre-production of the fourth series (2001), Ripley announced to the producers {{that she would be}} leaving the show, partly because {{she did not want to}} spend five months living in Manchester away from her home in London and wanted to spend more time with her husband, and partly to take other roles which she would otherwise <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> She asked the writer Mike Bullen to either kill off Jenny or have her lose a limb. Bullen refused and instead wrote a plot in which Jenny moves to New York. Ripley returned to the series for a guest appearance in the final episode (2003). She had originally planned not to return to the show, but reprised the role so she could have an on-screen record of the final stages of her pregnancy with her first child.|$|E

25|$|Wilson seems {{from his}} diary {{not to have}} {{particularly}} welcomed the suggestion that he become CIGS. When told by Milner of rumours {{that he was to}} be given Robertson’s job he said that he preferred to be given ever more power at Versailles where he was building up a prestigious post for himself, with Robertson reduced “from the position of a Master to that of a servant”. Milner told Wilson (10 February) that Lloyd George wanted to move Robertson to Versailles. Ironically, if he became CIGS he wanted Robertson (whom he thought would refuse) or whoever else replaced him at Versailles to report to himself. There was talk of the government falling, Rawlinson writing to H.A.Gwynne (14 February 1918) that the best solution was to give Robertson a powerful role at Versailles and have Wilson as a weak CIGS in London “where he will <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> much mischief – especially if Squiff replaced LG as PM”.|$|E

The Queen persuaded the Prime Minister, Lord Palmerston, to vote Alice a dowry of £30,000 [...] (£ as of [...] ). Although the amount was considered generous at the time, Prince Albert remarked that [...] "she will <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> great things with it" [...] in the little realm of Hesse, compared to the riches that her sister Victoria would inherit as future Queen of Prussia and German Empress. Furthermore, the couple's future home in Darmstadt, the Grand Ducal seat, was uncertain. Although Queen Victoria expected that a new palace would be built, the people of Darmstadt {{did not want to}} meet that expense, and the resulting controversy caused resentment there. This meant that Alice was unpopular in Darmstadt before she even arrived.|$|E

Nash only played in three preseason games before he started to feel more pain in his back. Nash on injuring his back: [...] "Being on the court this season has been my top priority, and it is disappointing to <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> that right now.

500|$|Early {{traditions and}} stories explain this verse as a miracle {{performed}} by Muhammad, following requests of {{some members of}} the Quraysh. Most Muslim commentators accept the authenticity of those traditions. The following verse 54:2, [...] "But if they see a Sign, they turn away, and say, 'This is (but) transient magic'" [...] is taken in the support of this view. The classical commentator Ibn Kathir provides a list of the early traditions mentioning the incident: A tradition transmitted on the authority of Anas bin Malik states that Muhammad split the moon after the pagan Meccans asked for a miracle. Another tradition from Malik transmitted through other chains of narrations, mentions that the mount Nur was visible between the two parts of the moon (Mount Nur is located in Hijaz. Muslims believe that Muhammad received his first revelations from God in a cave on this mountain, Cave Hira'). A tradition narrated on the authority of Jubayr ibn Mut'im with a single chain of transmission says that the two parts of the moon stood on two mountains. This tradition further states that the Meccan responded by saying [...] "Muhammad has taken us by his magic... If he was able to take us by magic, he will <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so with all people." [...] Traditions transmitted on the authority of Ibn Abbas briefly mention the incident and do not provide much details.

2500|$|The planned {{follow-up}} to Jesus Christ Superstar was a musical comedy {{based on the}} Jeeves and Wooster novels by P. G. Wodehouse.

After doing some initial work on the lyrics, he {{pulled out of the}} project and Lloyd Webber subsequently wrote the musical with Alan Ayckbourn, who provided the book and lyrics. Jeeves failed to make any impact at the box office and closed after a short run of only three weeks. Many years later, Lloyd Webber and Ayckbourn revisited this project, producing a thoroughly reworked and more successful version entitled By Jeeves (1996). Only two of the songs from the original production remained ("Half a Moment" [...] and [...] "Banjo Boy").|$|E
