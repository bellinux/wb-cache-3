The Beveridge Report proposed a series of measures to aid those who were in need of help, or in poverty and recommended that the government find ways of tackling what the report called [...] "the five giants": Want, Disease, Ignorance, Squalor, and Idleness. It urged the government to take steps to provide citizens with adequate income, adequate health care, adequate education, adequate housing, and adequate employment, proposing that [...] "All people of working age should pay a weekly <b>National</b> <b>Insurance</b> <b>contribution.</b> In return, benefits would be paid to people who were sick, unemployed, retired, or widowed." ...|$|E

50|$|The Merchant Navy Welfare Board was {{established}} in 1948 following a review initiated, five years earlier, by the Government. As a consequence it took over and enhanced the role of its predecessor, the Seamen’s Welfare Board which, in 1938, {{had taken over the}} work of the British Council for the Welfare of Merchantile Marine dating back to 1927. The membership of its Council, as now, came from ship owners, seafarers' trade unions and nautical charities, but also Government. Originally, funding was provided by the Government via levies imposed on British ship owners employing the many non-domiciled seamen. These companies were required to contribute the equivalent of the employer’s <b>national</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>contribution</b> for each overseas seafarer they employed. Fifty percent of the income was given to the Board, the remainder to another maritime charity.|$|E
40|$|The ways benefits, {{tax credits}} and income tax and <b>National</b> <b>Insurance</b> <b>contribution</b> {{thresholds}} are uprated each year have major long-term consequences for the relative living standards of different groups. Continuing current practice for 20 years, other things staying the same, could result in substantial increases in poverty, including a near doubling of the child poverty rate, alongside a substantial gain to the public finances. At the same time, pensioners are largely protected by the earnings indexation of pensioner benefits. We illustrate the distributional implications of alternative targeted policy reforms, financed by part of the resources that would be released through continuing current uprating practices...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the difficulties which {{people with mental}} health conditions may experience in establishing and maintaining entitlement to the social security benefits which underwrite incapacity for work. Two regimes are currently operating simultaneously, the incapacity benefits regime, introduced in 1995, and employment and support allowance (ESA), introduced in October 2008. The thesis identifies the main barriers to incapacity for work benefits for people with mental health problems as the symptoms of mental illness, administrative procedures, <b>national</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>contribution</b> conditions, assessment, conditionality, appeals {{and complexity of the}} welfare system. It compares the two regimes and concludes that although problems arise with both incapacity benefits and ESA, problems with ESA are greater. The ESA scheme and ongoing reforms appear to have worked well for people who are at the most severe end of the spectrum of mental illness, since they receive more money and are relieved of conditionality. For claimants with lesser mental health problems the situation has worsened. The thesis makes a number of recommendations for change. It suggests that mental health teams should include welfare benefits advisers, recommends better training in mental health issues for DWP staff, and improved communication between the DWP and claimants, in particular lesser reliance on telephony. Consideration should also be given to removal of <b>national</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>contribution</b> conditions for incapacity for work benefits, and replacement by a universal benefit. The thesis points out that assessment of incapacity is the most significant obstacle to entitlement and suggests a return to the informal procedure used pre- 1995, as well as payment for partial capacity. It also recommends voluntary, rather than mandatory participation in work-related activity by claimants with mental health problems, and questions whether it is appropriate to use the welfare system to coerce claimants, particularly those with mental health problems, into employment.
