40|$|This report {{investigates the}} {{possibility}} to use <b>non-petroleum</b> <b>based</b> adhesive (biobitumen) in asphalt. The main reasons for replacing bitumen are the fact that oil prices are rising, the threat of peak oil {{and the fact that}} the asphalt industry is becoming more environmentally friendly. The main purpose of this report is to investigate whether there are any <b>non-petroleum</b> <b>based</b> adhesives on the market. If so, how can they be used? The questions covered are: • Are there any other alternative asphalt coatings available? • Can bio-oils be used in asphalt? • If the bio-oils can be used, what are the details their properties? • How does a cold climate affect the bio binders? • What is the Swedish asphalt industry’s opinion about bio asphalt? The project was concluded through literature studies, consultations with people in the asphalt industry and through several interviews. The conclusion of this report is that there are some existing <b>non-petroleum</b> <b>based</b> adhesives on the market. They are mainly used for bike paths, sidewalks and parkareas. The biggest problem for greater use is the fact that it is expensive and performance in cold climate is unknown.

25|$|Furfural is an {{important}} renewable, <b>non-petroleum</b> <b>based,</b> chemical feedstock. Hydrogenation of furfural provides furfuryl alcohol (FA) which is a useful chemical intermediate in for example the manufacture of furan resin prepolymers exploited in thermoset polymer matrix composites, cements, adhesives, casting resins and coatings. Further hydrogenation of furfuryl alcohol leads to tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (THFA) which {{is used as a}} nonhazardous solvent in agricultural formulations and as an adjuvant to help herbicides penetrate the leaf structure. Furfural is used to make other furan chemicals, such as furoic acid, via oxidation, and furan itself via palladium catalyzed vapor phase decarbonylation.

40|$|Biodiesel is an {{alternative}} <b>non-petroleum</b> <b>based</b> fuel, consisting of alkyl esters obtained either by esterification of free fatty acids with low molecular weight alcohols, or by transesterification of triglycerides.

The realization of a biodiesel unit can pose several safety issues and inherent safety application opportunities as the production involves the transport, use and storage of hazardous materials, either flammable or toxic. A key goal of inherent safety via substitution is the provision of a clear, unambiguous information on hazardous materials and how to properly select them. To this end, in the experimental phase, we studied different alkali catalysts and the relevant reaction parameters, at laboratory scale. A simple kinetic modelling approach was developed and applied to the transesterification process allowing to provide possible minimization and simplification plant options...|$|R
30|$|Other very {{important}} platform molecules are HMF and furfural. HMF is a versatile platform chemical. HMF {{could be easily}} transformed into maleic anhydride because it contains a furyl ring in its basic structure. This transformation could be achieved via oxidative C–C bond cleavage of HMF. Furfural is an important renewable, <b>non-petroleum</b> <b>based,</b> chemical feedstock. It could be easily transformed into furfuryl alcohol (FAlc), via hydrogenation, {{which is a very}} useful chemical intermediate [precursor of tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (THFA)]. It could be also transformed into maleic anhydride or maleic acid, via oxidation, as we will discuss later in the present paper. The by-product of furfural oxidation in gas phase is furan. This molecule {{is also one of the}} important intermediates in chemical industry. Moreover, as indicated below, furan is also the first intermediate in the mechanism of the furfural oxidation. Even if it cannot be produced directly from biomass (it can be produced from furfural) due to its presence in the reaction mechanism we have decide to include it into the present review.|$|R

40|$|Work {{sponsored}} by the John and Jane Bradley gift to the MIT Energy Initiative. <b>Non-petroleum</b> <b>based</b> liquid fuels are essential for reducing oil dependence and greenhouse gas generation. Increased substitution of alcohol fuel for petroleum based fuels could be achieved by 1) use in high efficiency spark ignition engines that are employed for heavy duty as well as light duty operation and 2) use of methanol as well as ethanol. Methanol is the liquid fuel that is most efficiently produced from thermo-chemical gasification of coal, natural gas, waste or biomass. Ethanol can also be produced by this process but at lower efficiency and higher cost. Coal derived methanol is in limited initial use as a transportation fuel in China. Methanol could potentially be produced from natural gas at an economically competitive fuel costs, and with essentially the same greenhouse gas impact as gasoline. Waste derived methanol could also be an affordable low carbon fuel. In this paper we describe modeling studies of alcohol fuel operation in highly turbocharged direct injection spark ignition engines operated at high compression ratio.

40|$|The use of high Reclaimed Asphalt (RA) content {{mixtures}} {{together with}} binders produced from renewable resources (biobinders) {{is one of}} the current challenges in pavement engineering research. On one hand, RA has been used for decades but there are still some concerns about its performance, especially when high contents are used (> 30 %). On the other hand, biobinders are relatively new materials which have to be deeply characterised and studied in order to develop good-practices for their use. In this paper, linear viscoelastic properties of biobinders and bio-mixtures manufactured with high-RA content and biobinders are analysed and discussed. High-modulus mixtures with 50 % RA were selected for the mix design. Binders and mixtures were tested over a wide range of asphalt service temperatures and frequencies by means of DSR and two-point bending tests respectively. Results show that biobinders have an important effect on mixtures behaviour. However, no direct links between their linear viscoelastic properties were found.

The models, developed in this paper, are modifications of those described in [1]. After the compilation of liquid fuel properties, the existing detailed mechanism of methyl butanoate ester, C 5 H 10 O 2 [2, 3] oxidation was supplemented by sub-mechanisms for two proposed fuel constituent components, C 7 H 16 and C 7 H 8 O (and, then, by mp 2 d and propyne, C 3 H 4) to represent the combustion model of RME described by the chemical formula, C 19 H 34 O 2 (or C 19 H 36 O 2).

40|$|This {{thesis is}} about the {{toughening}} of poly lactide (PLA). PLA {{has the potential to}} be of great importance to the materials world, not only as a solution to address pollution wastes of plastics, but also as a best candidate to be derived from <b>non-petroleum</b> <b>based</b> and renewable resources. The most significant drawback of PLA is its brittleness, which is the focus of the present thesis. Chapter 1 is literature review that focuses mainly on available data on the connections between structure-property relationship of PLA and PLA nanocomposites, and toughening. Chapter 2 entitled: “Improving the Mechanical Properties of Polylactide: Embrittlement or Plasticization?” investigates two conventional methods. These methods are adding nanoclays and plasticizer to control mechanical properties. In Chapter 3, entitled: “Toughening of Polylactide: Single or Hybrid Fillers?” the first steps towards finding a feasible method for improvement in PLA toughness are introduced. The main aim is to improve toughness without sacrificing mechanical properties such as tensile strength and modulus. New ternary PLA nanocomposites introduced in chapter 3 are comprehensively investigated as a main idea in Chapter 4 entitled: “Tensile properties of ternary PLA/EGMA/nanoclay hybrid composites with controlled morphology”.

40|$|Objectives:Biocompatibility is an {{important}} desirable property for a dental polymer {{and it can be}} achieved by utilizing more materials from natural sources. The flexural strength of an experimental polymer prepared from MMA monomer modified with palm-oil polyol was compared to two commercial resins,namely the Lucitone 199 Â? (Dentsply Trubyte, USA) and Impact (Ivoclar Vivadent, Liechtenstein). Methods: The experimental polymer was prepared by copolymerizing MMA monomer and palm oil polyol. The resulting polymer was cast into a plate form and sectioned using a precision diamond saw (Buhler, Germany) to form 10 specimens of dimension, 65 mm x 11 mm x 5 mm. These specimens were then polished to achieve a nominal dimension of 64 mm x 10 mm x 3. 3 mm. Another 10 specimens were prepared using Lucitone 199 Â? and Impact according to the manufacturers' instructions and were polished by the same procedure. Their flexural strengths were determined using a three point bend test on an Instron Universal Testing Machine (Anytown, Australia) according to the procedure of test method ISO 1567. Data obtained was analysed using Oneway ANOVA (SPSS 12. 0) at 95 confidence interval. Results: The mean flexural strength of Lucitone 199 Â? was 127. 39 MPa (Â± 16. 54), Impact was 177. 57 MPa (Â± 11. 44) and experimental polymer was 51. 62 MPa (Â± 4. 21). Although the experimental polymer has exhibited higher flexural strength than PMMA homopolymer, it has lower flexural strength when compared to Lucitone 199 Â? and Impact denture base resins, both of which were filler-reinforced materials. Conclusions:In this preliminary study, the experimental polymer contained a significant proportion of <b>non-petroleum</b> <b>based</b> materials derived from palm oil.

In addition, it was shown that the cellulose I structure of BC is not converted to cellulose II. BC is an interesting material for in-vivo studies. However, to make it an interesting biological composite a suitable resin must be found. Poly (vinyl alcohol) (PVA) is a known water soluble polymer and is therefore a suitable candidate material. In this study BC was grown in PVA solution to produce an in-situ composite. The concluding work for this project is an in-vitro study of BC for scaffolds for tissue engineering.

Vehicular storage of gaseous fuels is a key enabling technology for the two pillars of a <b>non-petroleum</b> <b>based</b> transportation economy natural-gas vehicles and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. My research focuses on the development of nanoporous carbons as high-capacity storage materials for natural gas (methane) and molecular hydrogen. The carbons have surface areas of up to 3500 m²/g, porosities of up to 0. 8. Extensive characterizations of the surface and pore structure of samples were performed. Characterizations include surface areas and pore-size distributions from nitrogen adsorption at 77 K; pore-size distribution from methane adsorption at 293 K; scanning and transmission electron microscopy; and chemical composition analysis. In two case studies, it was found that 40 % of all surface sites reside in pores of width ~ 0. 7 nm and binding energy ~ 9 kJ/mol, and 60 % of sites in pores of width > 1. 0 nm and binding energy ~ 5 kJ/mol. It was furthermore found that we can experimentally distinguish between the situation in which molecules do (mobile adsorption) or do not (localized adsorption) move parallel to the surface, how such lateral dynamics affects the hydrogen storage capacity, and how the two situations are controlled by the vibrational frequencies of adsorbed hydrogen molecules parallel and perpendicular to the surface: in the two case studies, adsorption is mobile at 293 K, and localized at 77 K. These findings make a strong case that, and how, hydrogen storage capacities in nanoporous carbons can be optimized by suitable engineering of the nanopore space...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} decade, the {{interest}} towards <b>non-petroleum</b> <b>based</b> fuels is strongly increased {{due to the}} current concerns {{about the impact of}} the transport system on atmospheric pollutions, mainly due to CO 2 emissions. Ethanol, either blended with conventional fuels or in its pure form, is one of such fuels already in use in the automotive industries. As an example, the flex-fuel engines are designed to employ gasoline from 10 % up to 85 % of ethanol (E 10, E 85). In this work, the oxidation kinetics of ethanol with air has been considered and analyzed in an ambient at high pressure, ranging from 4 to 6 MPa, by means of a Computational Singular Perturbation methodology. This study starts from a detailed kinetic reaction mechanism, which is extensively used in the literature and is made up by 235 reversible reactions among 46 chemical species. This mechanism has been used to get several families of simplified (skeletal) mechanisms by considering equivalence ratios in the range 0. 2 - 2. 0 and two sets of initial temperatures (900 - 1200 K and 1200 - 1700 K). The skeletal mechanisms have been validated by comparing the temperature and major chemical species profiles and the ignition delay time with those obtained by employing the detailed mechanism. Advantages and limitations of these mechanisms are highlighted. The accuracy of the skeletal mechanisms is very good in the range of equivalence ratio and temperature considered in the simplification procedure. Moreover, it is shown that a further simplification of the reaction mechanism is obtained by narrowing the range of equivalence ratio instead of the range of temperature. The most simplified skeletal mechanisms show an error in the prediction of temperature and fuel profiles lower than 3 %, except for the case of low temperature and lean mixtures, where the maximum error increases up to 14 %. Finally, the main reaction pathways are analyzed to show how the most important intermediate chemical species and products characterize the skeletal mechanisms for different values of equivalence ratio and temperature. The skeletal mechanisms are given as Supplementary data. The reader can refer to such data for the entire set of the retained reactions and species for each skeletal mechanism. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of field experiments on the potential water quality impacts from the application of dust suppressants to disturbed lands in Clark County, Nevada. This is an important issue not only in the southwest, but in all of the U. S. since there are currently minimal guidelines for the use of dust suppressants. The use of dust suppressants is driven by the need of communities to comply with air quality standards of PM- 10 (particulate matter less than 10 μm in diameter) emissions. There is, however, concern that the solution of this air pollution problem will have other unanticipated environmental and human health consequences. Dust suppressants include water, fiber mulches, water-absorbing materials (e. g., calcium chloride, magnesium chloride), petroleum based organics (e. g., asphalt emulsion), <b>non-petroleum</b> <b>based</b> organics (e. g., vegetable oil, molasses), synthetic polymer emulsions, and lignin products. These materials are generally effective in minimizing dust; however, {{little is known about the}} effects of the products on the environment and human health. In Clark County, there is the potential for dust suppressants to be used on large areas to minimize the PM- 10 emissions from lands that are disturbed from construction activities and on unpaved roads. Furthermore, all of the Las Vegas Valley drains to Lake Mead which is a drinking water source for many communities in the southwest. It is undesirable to allow the application of dust suppressants that could potentially contribute contaminated runoff to Lake Mead. The agencies sponsoring this research (Clark County Health District, Clark County Air Quality Management Agency, Las Vegas Valley Water District, Southern Nevada Water Authority, Clark County Flood Control District, and the City of Las Vegas) recognize that research on all the potential environmental impacts is important; however, impacts of dust suppressants on water quality were given the highest priority for this study. Therefore, the overall objective of this research was to generate basic data for evaluating the water quality impacts of major categories of dust suppressants. This information will serve as a scientific basis for proposed guidelines on the application of dust suppressants to disturbed lands...|$|R
40|$|Cellulose {{nanomaterials}} (CNs) {{have become}} attractive materials {{in recent years}} as a result of renewed interests from consumers, industry and governments to use renewable/sustainable, carbon neutral, and <b>non-petroleum</b> <b>based</b> materials. CNs have been considered as a reinforcement phase in polymer composites, protective coatings, barrier/filter membrane systems, network structures for tissue engineering and substrates for flexible electronics because of good mechanical properties, low density, low thermal expansion and surfaces that can be readily chemically functionalized. Two types of CNs extracted from wood (cellulose nanofibrils (CNF) and cellulose nanocrystals (CNC)) were used in multilayer laminates and polyurethane nanocomposite. Neat CNF films were boned on the wood flake or adhered with polymer interlayer to fabricate CNF-WF laminate and CNF-polymer multilayer laminate. Similarly, high quality CNC films were also prepared to stack with polymer to fabricate CNC-polymer multilayer laminate. Moreover, the freeze-dried CNCs used as reinforced nanofiller were re-dispersed in the thermoplastic polyurethane to fabricate polymer nanocomposite. ^ Homogeneous and transparent CNF films fabricated from (2, 2, 6, 6 -tetramethylpiperidin- 1 -yl) oxyl (TEMPO) based CNF suspension were adhered on the wood flake (WF) to form CNF-WF laminate with phenol-formaldehyde resin via a lamination process. The mechanical properties of CNF-WF laminate had improved as compared to the neat WF, especially in the transverse direction, because of the anisotropic properties of WF. Linear polystyrene-poly(ethylene/butylenes) -polystyrene (SEBS) triblock copolymer and polyvinyl butyral (PVB resin) were also adhered with CNF films to fabricate CNF-polymer multilayer laminates. Though the mechanical performance of the laminates was reduced by incorporating the polymer interlayer, the toughness (work of fracture) of the laminates was improved because polymer interlayer can dissipate more energy when breaking the laminates. ^ CNC-polymer multilayer laminates were also prepared with PVB and SEBS interlayer via lamination process. In the CNC laminate system, all the properties of the laminates with different polymer volume fraction were reduced. However, an attractive result was observed in the CNC-maleated SEBS laminate with high polymer volume fraction. In testing, the maleated SEBS laminate presented multiple breaking steps and large elongation, which would suggest that the maleated SEBS interlayer can stop crack propagation throughout the entire laminate and can dissipate more energy during failure. Except for fabricating CNF and CNC laminates, freeze-dried CNCs were also re-dispersed in thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) to fabricate CNC reinforced nanocomposites. The elastic modulus and thermal stability of the nanocomposite were improved with increasing CNC content in the TPU matrix. The improved properties were due to the formation of hydrogen bonding between CNCs and TPU matrix. Moreover, the ductility (strain of failure) of the nanocomposite was similar to pure TPU which would suggest that CNCs only hindered the mobility of hard domains, but had no influence on the chain movement of soft domains in nanocomposites. ...|$|R
40|$|Part 1 : The {{emergence}} of environmentally friendly commercial products {{and their impact}} on fire debris analysis. Environmentally friendly products (i. e. green products) are environmentally preferable choices relative to comparable commercial products. They are readily available to the public, often highly flammable, and can be used by criminals as accelerants to facilitate the start and/or spread of fire. It is critical for analysts to have an understanding of their composition and chromatographic characteristics. Green products include paint thinners, solvents, removers, and cleaning and surface preparation products. As the composition of commercial products continually change over time, the fire debris community needs {{to be aware of the}} variety of environmentally friendly ignitable liquids that could be encountered during casework. Traditionally, when fire debris analysts have been trained, they are taught that most of the ignitable liquid residues they will encounter in casework are petroleum-based products. With the increasing {{emergence of}} <b>non-petroleum</b> <b>based</b> green products in the consumer marketplace, such products may be encountered more often than ever before in fire debris evidence submitted to forensic laboratories. Analysts should become familiar with the chromatographic features of these products as neat liquids as well as when present in fire debris samples. The purpose of this study is to introduce fire debris analysts to the prevalence of green products and increase knowledge regarding a variety of green product compositions and the characteristics they exhibit when analyzed as neat liquids and in "mock" fire debris samples. Several green products were analyzed as neat liquid samples and subsequently extracted from fire debris samples using typical fire debris extraction and analysis techniques in order to familiarize fire debris analysts with the chromatographic and mass spectral features of these products. General information about different types of green commercial products, their chromatographic and mass spectral characteristics, and their interpretation will be summarized. Analytical methods were developed for the analysis of environmentally friendly products and included considerations of gas chromatography oven temperature and ramp rate, hold times, and flow rate, as well as the scan rate and range of the mass spectrometer. Analyses involving common substrates were performed, including spiking green products onto various substrates with subsequent analysis and comparison of burned and unburned samples. Part 2 : Application of fast GC/MS analysis for the identification of ignitable liquids in fire debris samples. Fire debris samples that contain ignitable liquid residues undergo a two-step process of extraction, most commonly via passive adsorption elution (PAE) onto an activated carbon strip, and instrumental analysis by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Upon completion of PAE, adsorbed compounds are eluted from the adsorbent with a suitable solvent and analyzed using (GC/MS) for the potential identification of ignitable liquid residues. A thorough evaluation of the literature revealed the average run time for gas chromatography of fire debris samples that contain hydrocarbon or petroleum based ignitable liquids to be 30 minutes. Additionally, a blank sample is run before an evidentiary sample to ensure solvent purity and to ensure any chromatographic carry over has not occurred between subsequent injections. The average run time, along with case volume, extraction times and case reviews contributes significantly to the backlog of samples to be analyzed in most crime laboratories around the country. Fast-GC/MS would significantly reduce analysis time, lower operating costs and would use less consumables. Based on a process known as pattern recognition, an initial goal of a fire debris analyst is to identify a pattern that is consistent with an ignitable liquid class. The standard method followed by most fire debris analysts use or base standard operating procedures (SOPs) on the American Society of Testing and Materials (ASTM) E 1618, which defines the classes of commercial ignitable liquids based on chemical composition and boiling point range (or volatility). This study was conducted to optimize current methods of ignitable liquid detection and to optimize fast-GC/MS conditions for the identification of ignitable liquids in fire debris samples. Additionally, this study was conducted to determine if fast-GC/MS can reduce chromatographic separation times without sacrificing peak resolution and subsequently allow for ignitable liquid discrimination. Method development included considerations of flow rate, initial GC oven temperature, ramp rate, and mid and end temperature hold times. Fast-GC/MS conditions were tested on neat ignitable liquids from all nine ASTM E 1618 classes. Optimizing fast-GC/MS method parameters led to an increase in sample throughput in comparison to traditional GC/MS methods. As a result, the GC/MS identification of ignitable liquids and their residues was performed in a quarter of the amount of time when compared to traditional methods...|$|R
