In 1968 he joined the Ministry of Science and Higher Education of Iran as Deputy minister for research. In 1973 he was appointed chancellor of the French language Bu Ali Sina University. In a meeting with the prime minister of Iran Amir Abbas Hoveida, Etemad proposed that an independent national organization for scientific research needed to be established. Hoveida approved the proposal and Etemad was made the head of Iran's Institute for Planning and Research in Science. On April 10, 1974 he was appointed Deputy Prime Minister of Iran and the first president of its atomic energy organization. After becoming the president he ensured that all decision-making powers were given to him, right from the budget to the selection of staff.

40|$|Abstract The present thesis {{deals with}} the nuclear {{magnetic}} resonance (NMR) spectroscopy of small solutes applied to the studies of liquid crystals and molecular sieves. In this method, changes induced by the investigated environment to the static spectral parameters (i. e. <b>nuclear</b> <b>shielding,</b> indirect and direct spin-spin coupling and quadrupole coupling) of the solute are measured. The <b>nuclear</b> <b>shielding</b> of dissolved noble gases is utilized for the studies of thermotropic liquid crystals. The relation between the symmetry properties of mesophases and the <b>nuclear</b> <b>shielding</b> is described. The different interaction mechanisms perturbing the observed noble gas <b>nuclear</b> <b>shielding</b> are discussed, particularly, the role of long-range attractive van der Waals interactions is brought out. The suitability of the noble gas NMR spectroscopy to the studies of lyotropic liquid crystals is investigated in terms of <b>nuclear</b> <b>shielding</b> and quadrupole coupling interactions. In molecular sieve systems, the effect of inter- and intracrystalline motions of solutes on their NMR spectra is discussed. A novel method for the measurement of the intracrystalline motions is developed. The distinctions in the 13 C shielding of methane adsorbed in AlPO 4 - 11 and SAPO- 11, two structurally similar molecular sieves differing in composition, are indicated...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} a {{dielectric}} medium on the magnetizabilities and <b>nuclear</b> <b>shielding</b> constants of the fluoromethanes are calculated in a gauge-origin independent approach. It is shown {{that in order to}} model the {{effects of a}} dielectric medium properly, we have to go beyond the dipole approximation and the geometry has to be optimized for each value of the dielectric constant. Geometrical distortions play an important role, as is clearly demonstrated for the magnetizability of the CH 3 F molecule where the geometrical distortions alter the sign of the dielectric contribution to the solvent shift. The effects on the <b>nuclear</b> <b>shielding</b> constants from a dielectric medium are interpreted in terms of the polarization of the charge distribution and the change in geometry. Other medium effects on <b>nuclear</b> <b>shielding</b> constants are discussed, and it is demonstrated that they must be included in order to reproduce the experimental gas-to-liquid chemical shift of the CH 3 F and CHF 3 molecules.

40|$|A gauge {{transformation}} of the vector potential AmI, associated to the magnetic dipole mI of nucleus I in a molecule, has been studied. The conditions for gauge invariance of <b>nuclear</b> magnetic <b>shielding,</b> <b>nuclear</b> spin/electron orbit contribution to spin-spin coupling between two nuclei, I and J, and electronic current density induced by mI, have been expressed via quantum mechanical sum rules that are identically satisfied for exact and optimal variational wavefunctions. It is shown that separate diamagnetic and paramagnetic contributions to the properties transform into {{one another in the}} gauge transformation, whereas their sum is invariant. Therefore, only total response properties have a physical meaning. In particular, the disjoint diamagnetic and paramagnetic components of nuclear spin/electron orbit contributions to coupling constants are not uniquely defined. The diamagnetic contribution to the nuclear spin-spin coupling tensor, evaluated as an expectation value in the Ramsey theory, can alternatively be expressed as a sum-over-states formula, by rewriting the second-order Hamiltonian in commutator form à la Geertsen, as previously reported by Sauer. Other sum-over-states formulae are obtained via a gauge transformation, by a procedure formally allowing for a continuous translation of the origin of the mI -induced current density, analogous to those previously proposed for magnetizabilities and <b>nuclear</b> magnetic <b>shielding...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{environmental}} {{modifications of}} the polarizability, the diamagnetic {{contribution to the}} susceptibility, and the <b>nuclear</b> <b>shielding</b> of the sodium anion (Na-) in the cryptand salt Na-·Na-C 222 (C 222 = cryptand 222) are deduced from ab-initio quantum chemistry computations. The point charge electrostatic contribution to the anion environment in the cryptand reduces to 643 au, the free anion polarizability of 1090 au predicted taking account of electron correlation using the coupled electron pair approximation. This polarizability {{is found to be}} further diminished to around 400 au on introducing a realistic model of the full environment in the cryptand. The electron correlation contribution to the polarizability is largely suppressed on entering the condensed phase. The diamagnetic contribution to the susceptibility is found to be reduced in magnitude by 32 % on introducing a model for the full environment in the cryptand. This result, combined with an average energy approximation analysis of the ab-initio polarizabilities, shows that environmental modifications of the ground-state wave functions are responsible for about one-third of the polarizability reductions, with two-thirds arising from environmental modifications of the excited states and their excitation energies. The contribution of the two 3 s electrons to the diamagnetic part of the <b>nuclear</b> <b>shielding</b> is found to be enhanced by 9 % when the free anion experiences the present model for the environment in the cryptand, the core contribution remaining essentially unchanged. The nucleus in the cryptated anion is predicted to be shielded by 3. 58 ppm relative to that in an isolated gaseous sodium atom, compared with the 2. 88 ppm <b>nuclear</b> <b>shielding</b> in the free anion relative to that in the free atom. This comparative insensitivity of the shielding is consistent with the experimental observation that the Na- shielding (uncorrected for bulk susceptibility) almost always lies within ± 1 ppm of a 1. 5 ppm shielding relative to the free sodium atom. This explains how the <b>nuclear</b> <b>shielding</b> can be so comparatively environment insensitive in a species interacting sufficiently strongly with its surroundings as to experience a reduction in polarizability by a factor of 2. 7...|$|E
