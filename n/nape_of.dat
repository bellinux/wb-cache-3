5|$|Three other, {{significantly}} smaller, nuthatches have ranges which overlap that of white-breasted, {{but none}} has white plumage completely surrounding the eye.

5|$|If {{traditional}} Hunanese customs were adhered to, the baby's {{head would}} have been shaved after four weeks, with a small tuft of hair left on the crown and at the <b>nape</b> <b>of</b> the neck; {{it was at this}} point that the child {{would have been}} officially given its name. According to tradition, visitors probably would have gathered for this ceremony, bringing gifts of money, pork, fish, fruit, and decorated eggs.|$|E
5|$|Both sexes become {{sexually mature}} {{by the time}} they are a year old. Females enter oestrus (typically five days long) from January to March. In males, {{spermatogenesis}} occurs mainly in February and March. In southern Turkmenistan, mating occurs from January to early February. The mating season is marked by noisy fights among males for dominance. Mating behaviour is similar to that in the domestic cat: the male pursues the female in oestrus, seizes her by the <b>nape</b> <b>of</b> her neck and mounts her. Vocalisations and flehmen are prominent during courtship. After a successful copulation, the female gives out a loud cry and reacts with aversion towards her partner. The pair then separate.|$|E

5|$|The Cuban macaw had a red {{forehead}} fading {{to orange}} {{and then to}} yellow at the <b>nape</b> <b>of</b> the neck. It had white unfeathered areas around the eyes, and yellow irises. The face, chin, chest, abdomen and thighs were orange. The legs were brown. The upper back was brownish red with feathers scalloped with green. The rump, undertail feathers, and lower back were blue. The wing feathers were brown, red and purplish blue. The upper surface of the tail was dark red fading to blue at the tip, and the under surface of the tail was brownish red. The beak has variously been described as dark, all-black, and greyish black. The sexes were identical in external appearance, as with other macaws.|$|E
5|$|Wrecking and {{smuggling}} supplemented local incomes.

A ship claimed to be from France unloaded illicit tea and brandy at Aberdaron in 1767, and attempted to sell its cargo to the locals; a Revenue cutter discovered salt being smuggled at Porth Cadlan in 1809; and a schooner en route from Guernsey to Scotland was reported to have offloaded lace, tea, brandy and gin at Y Rhiw in 1824.|$|E

40|$|In animal tissues, NAEs (N-acylethanolamines), {{including}} N-arachidonoylethanolamine (anandamide), {{are primarily}} formed from their corresponding NAPEs (N-acylphosphatidylethanolamines) by a phosphodiesterase of the PLD (phospholipase D) type (NAPE-PLD). Recently, we cloned cDNAs of NAPE-PLD from mouse, rat and human [Okamoto, Morishita, Tsuboi, Tonai and Ueda (2004) J. Biol. Chem. 279, 5298 – 5305]. However, it remained unclear whether NAPE-PLD acts on endogenous NAPEs {{contained in the}} membrane of living cells. To address this question, we stably transfected two mammalian cell lines (HEK- 293 and CHO-K 1) with mouse NAPE-PLD cDNA, and investigated the endogenous levels and compositions <b>of</b> <b>NAPEs</b> and NAEs in these cells, compared with mock-transfected cells, {{with the aid of}} GC-MS. The overexpression of NAPE-PLD caused a decrease in the total amount <b>of</b> <b>NAPEs</b> by 50 – 90 % with a 1. 5 -fold increase in the total amount of NAEs, suggesting that the recombinant NAPE-PLD utilizes endogenous NAPE as a substrate in the cell. Since the compositions <b>of</b> NAEs and <b>NAPEs</b> <b>of</b> NAPE-PLD-overexpressing cells and mock-transfected cells were very similar, the enzyme did not appear to discriminate among the N-acyl groups <b>of</b> endogenous <b>NAPEs.</b> These results confirm that overexpressed NAPE-PLD is capable of forming NAEs, including anandamide, in living cells...|$|R
5|$|Typically diurnal, {{the jungle}} cat hunts {{throughout}} the day. Solitary in nature, jungle cats do not interact appreciably {{except in the}} mating season. The only prominent interaction is the mother-kitten bond. Territories are maintained by urine spraying and scent marking. The cat is primarily a carnivore, and prefers small mammals (gerbils, hares and rodents) and birds. It hunts by stalking its prey, followed by a sprint or a leap; the sharp ears help in pinpointing the location of prey. Both sexes become sexually mature {{by the time they}} are a year old; females enter oestrus from January to March. Mating behaviour is similar to that in the domestic cat: the male pursues the female in oestrus, seizes her by the <b>nape</b> <b>of</b> her neck and mounts her. Gestation lasts nearly two months. Births take place between December and June, though this might vary geographically. Kittens begin to catch their own prey at around six months and leave the mother after eight or nine months.|$|E

25|$|Mating occurs from May through June.

Copulation generally lasts from 30 to 90 seconds, and a pair is rarely observed mating more than once or twice a day. Anywhere from two to eighteen eggs are usually laid in June or July depending on the size and age of the female, in nests excavated in pockets of earth exposed to the sun. The eggs go through a 90- to 100-day incubation period hatching in September and October. It has been noted that Cyclura eggs are some of the largest eggs laid by any lizard.|$|E
