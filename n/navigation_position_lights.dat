50|$|A <b>position</b> <b>light</b> {{signal is}} one where the <b>position</b> of the <b>lights,</b> rather than their colour, determines the meaning. The aspect {{consists}} solely of a pattern of illuminated lights, which are all of the same colour (typically a lemon yellow colour on mast signals with a frosted white on the dwarfs in U.S. service, colour having been added on the N&W, now Norfolk Southern's, <b>position</b> <b>lights).</b> In many countries, small <b>position</b> <b>light</b> signals are used as shunting signals, while the main signals are of colour light form.

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} discard some {{disadvantages}} of traditional astronomical <b>navigation</b> <b>positioning,</b> such as manual computation and time-consuming, we design a special calculator for locating ship's position, {{which not only}} make astronomical <b>navigation</b> <b>positioning</b> calculation quickly and operate instrument simply, but also convenient to carry. The system based on the theory of sun shift line positioning principle use the 32 -bit microcontrollers based on ARM Cortex-M 3 kernel as the core controller. In this paper, we give hardware design and software process of the system. Through actual test, {{the results of the}} testing value and actual value can tally well.

40|$|This paper compares {{autonomous}} relative {{navigation performance}} for formations in eccentric, medium and high-altitude Earth orbits using Global Positioning System (GPS) Standard Positioning Service (SPS), crosslink, and celestial object measurements. For close formations, the relative navigation accuracy is {{highly dependent on}} {{the magnitude of the}} uncorrelated measurement errors. A relative <b>navigation</b> <b>position</b> accuracy of better than 10 centimeters root-mean-square (RMS) can be achieved for medium-altitude formations that can continuously track at least one GPS signal. A relative <b>navigation</b> <b>position</b> accuracy of better than 15 meters RMS can be achieved for high-altitude formations that have sparse tracking of the GPS signals. The addition of crosslink measurements can significantly improve relative navigation accuracy for formations that use sparse GPS tracking or celestial object measurements for absolute navigation...|$|R

30|$|Even though {{driving into}} sidings/the depot is a {{frequent}} task for drivers working shifts around rush hours, it {{does not account for}} a significant percentage of their shift. Hence, when the large percentage of all category A SPaDs and the low percentage of the shift spent in these locations are considered, this suggests that there are issues {{in the design of the}} locations and operational procedures. The signalling is the main difference at the depot and the sidings compared to the rest of the network with the majority of the signals being ground <b>position</b> <b>lights.</b> Even though the majority of the drivers disagree with added complexity of those locations and ground <b>position</b> <b>lights,</b> they gave this type of signals the lowest mark. Moreover, participants’ involvement in category A SPaDs does not influence the attitudes of the drivers towards the ground <b>position</b> <b>lights</b> (U =  28, p =  0.663). The respondents mention that the ground <b>position</b> <b>lights</b> are hard to see at times due to low brightness and a poor choice of location. It is possible that the drivers do not see any hazard in this type of signalling in the context of day-to-day driving. However, when compared with different types of signals, they perceive the ground <b>position</b> <b>lights</b> as the hardest to interact with. It is also possible that the ground <b>position</b> <b>lights</b> are the hardest to interact with in the beginning of a shift before driving in passenger service.|$|R

40|$|Goddard Space Flight Center is {{currently}} developing advanced spacecraft systems to provide autonomous navigation {{and control of}} formation flyers. This paper discusses autonomous relative navigation performance for formations in eccentric, medium and high altitude Earth-orbits using Global Positioning System (GPS) Standard Positioning Service (SPS) and intersatellite range measurements. The performance of several candidate relative navigation approaches is evaluated. These analyses indicate that the relative navigation accuracy is primarily {{a function of the}} frequency of acquisition and tracking of the GPS signals. A relative <b>navigation</b> <b>position</b> accuracy of 0. 5 meters root-mean-square (RMS) can be achieved for formations in medium-attitude eccentric orbits that can continuously track at least one GPS signal. A relative <b>navigation</b> <b>position</b> accuracy of better than 75 meters RMS can be achieved for formations in high-altitude eccentric orbits that have sparse tracking of the GPS signals. The addition of round-trip intersatellite range measurements can significantly improve relative navigation accuracy for formations with sparse tracking of the GPS signals. ...|$|R
40|$|Flight {{tests were}} {{conducted}} jointly by NASA Langley Research Center and Honeywell, Inc., on a B- 737 research aircraft to record a data base for evaluating {{the performance of a}} differential DGPS/inertial navigation system (INS) which used GPS Course/Acquisition code receivers. Estimates from the DGPS/INS and a Microwave Landing System (MLS) /INS, and various aircraft parameter data were recorded in real time aboard the aircraft while flying along the final approach path to landing. This paper presents the mean and standard deviation of the DGPS/INS and MLS/INS <b>navigation</b> <b>position</b> errors computed relative to the laser tracker system and of the difference between the DGPS/INS and MLS/INS velocity estimates. RMS errors are presented for DGPS/INS and MLS/INS guidance errors (localizer and glideslope). The mean <b>navigation</b> <b>position</b> errors and standard deviation of the x position coordinate of the DGPS/INS and MLS/INS systems were found to be of similar magnitude while the standard deviation of the y and z position coordinate errors were significantly larger for DGPS/INS compared to MLS/INS...|$|R
5000|$|A {{standard}} high <b>position</b> <b>light</b> {{consists of}} two heads; the bottom head can remain dark unless it is needed. In addition to the high <b>position</b> <b>light</b> signals the PRR developed a dwarf <b>position</b> <b>light,</b> as with many railroads, these dwarf signals are {{also referred to as}} a [...] "pot," [...] a tradition carried over from the 19th century revolving [...] "Pot Type Signal." [...] Four plain white lamps are able to display four low-speed aspects each with two lamps. In 1930, close clearances of the Philadelphia Suburban Station complex spurred development of the pedestal-type position, which consisted of two position dwarf signals in a common cast backing.|$|R
50|$|In 1954, the PRR experimented {{installing}} red lenses in {{the horizontal}} {{position of the}} upper head to help increase the at distance visibility of absolute Stop signals at Overbrook interlocking. Under the Penn Central and later Conrail it became standard practice to add these red lenses to high <b>position</b> <b>lights</b> and even some pedestal signals. The Norfolk and Western modified its signals to use red and green lenses in the upper head Stop and Clear positions and yellow lenses everywhere else. In the 1980s Amtrak modified most of its former-PRR <b>position</b> <b>lights</b> to use the equivalent color light colors {{in all of the}} positions of both heads. Internally referred to as <b>position</b> color <b>lights,</b> these are {{not to be confused with}} color <b>position</b> <b>lights</b> described below, which while functionally similar are structurally considerably different.|$|R
