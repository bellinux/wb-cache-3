40|$|In {{order to}} realize the {{characteristics}} of the <b>numerical</b> <b>control</b> system including expandability and reconfigurability and to construct open CNC system platform with higher reliability, this paper established a component assembly model for <b>numerical</b> <b>control</b> system based on reliability. The <b>numerical</b> <b>control</b> system is divided into functional components which are relatively independent in logic. The <b>numerical</b> <b>control</b> system model is constructed based on the main evaluation indicator, the software reliability parameter of the <b>numerical</b> <b>control</b> system. The method is used in the interpolation module of the <b>numerical</b> <b>control</b> system with high requirement on timeliness. A solution is proposed based on improved particle swarm optimization (PSO), in which the rapid convergence of global optimal solution is guaranteed through flexible weighting method. According to the analytical result of the interpolation component assembly, a reliable and optimal open <b>numerical</b> <b>control</b> system can be constructed effectively and objectively based on the component assembly model in line with different evaluation indicator requirements...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the last}} 50 years, the {{development}} of computer <b>numerical</b> <b>controlled</b> machines has seen a plethora of part programming languages being developed. The large majority of these languages {{are based on the}} ISO 6983 standard which is commonly known as G&M codes, but other languages from machine tool suppliers are also used for programming machine tools. These programming languages have provided major barriers for the interoperability of such information between computer <b>numerical</b> <b>controlled</b> machines and also from computer <b>numerical</b> <b>controlled</b> machines to computer-aided systems. Thus, the process knowledge in existing part programs cannot be recycled and reused easily, due to an inability to interpret these forms of data. In this article, a new meta-model of computer <b>numerical</b> <b>controlled</b> part programming languages has been proposed. The meta-model aims to abstract the characteristics of computer <b>numerical</b> <b>controlled</b> machine activities and interpret/represent process information within computer <b>numerical</b> <b>controlled</b> part programs written in different languages or dialects. Realising the translation between the meta-model and different part programming languages, it is possible to capture the shopfloor knowledge from computer <b>numerical</b> <b>controlled</b> machines without the need to develop individual interpreting interfaces for each programming language. The valuable process knowledge can thus be captured from the part programs and represented in a neutral presentation to facilitate the knowledge accumulation and management, which is vital for manufacturing companies to gain competitive advantages in the globalised market...|$|R
