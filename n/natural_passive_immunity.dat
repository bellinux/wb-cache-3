40|$|<b>Passive</b> <b>immunity</b> {{is defined}} as a {{particular}} antigen resistance provided by external antibodies. It can be either naturally or artificially acquired. <b>Natural</b> <b>passive</b> immunization occurs during pregnancy and breast-feeding in mammals and during hatching in birds. Maternal antibodies are passed through the placenta and milk in mammals and through the egg yolk in birds. Artificial <b>passive</b> <b>immunity</b> is acquired by injection of either serum from immunized (or infected) individuals or antibody preparations. Many independent research groups worked on selection, verification and detailed characterization of polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies against the influenza virus. Numerous antibody preparations were tested in a variety of in vitro and in vivo experiments for their efficacy to neutralize the virus. Here, we describe types of antibodies tested in such experiments and their viral targets, review approaches resulting in identification of broadly neutralizing antibodies and discuss methods used to demonstrate their protective effects. Finally, we shortly discuss the phenomenon of maternal antibody transfer as a way of effective care for young individuals and as an interfering factor in early vaccination...|$|R

5|$|Some immune deficiencies, such as X-linked {{agammaglobulinemia}} and hypogammaglobulinemia, {{result in}} partial or {{complete lack of}} antibodies. These diseases are often treated by inducing a short term form of <b>immunity</b> called <b>passive</b> <b>immunity.</b> <b>Passive</b> <b>immunity</b> is achieved through the transfer of ready-made antibodies {{in the form of}} human or animal serum, pooled immunoglobulin or monoclonal antibodies, into the affected individual.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Passive</b> <b>immunity</b> is temporary, {{because the}} {{antibodies}} which are transferred have a lifespan {{of only about}} 3–6 months. Every placental mammal (which includes humans) has experienced temporarily induced immunity by transfer of homologous antibodies from its mother across the placenta, giving it <b>passive</b> <b>immunity</b> to whatever its mother became immune to.

2500|$|<b>Passive</b> <b>immunity</b> is the {{transfer}} of active immunity, {{in the form of}} readymade antibodies, from one individual to another. [...] <b>Passive</b> <b>immunity</b> can occur naturally, when maternal antibodies are transferred to the foetus through the placenta, and can also be induced artificially, when high levels of human (or horse) antibodies specific for a pathogen or toxin are transferred to non-immune individuals. Passive immunization is used when there is a high risk of infection and insufficient time for the body to develop its own immune response, or to reduce the symptoms of ongoing or immunosuppressive diseases. <b>Passive</b> <b>immunity</b> provides immediate protection, but the body does not develop memory, therefore the patient is at risk of being infected by the same pathogen later.|$|R

40|$|Pregnant swine {{were exposed}} to {{transmissible}} gastroenteritis (TGE) virus by different routes, and their serum, colostrum, and mild were examined for titer and immunoglobulin (Ig) class of antibodies. When 2 to 4 days old, the litters of most of these animals were challenged with virulent TGE virus to determine the effectiveness of <b>passive</b> <b>immunity.</b> After two oral/intranasal exposures to attenuated virus, none of the six pregnant animals became sick. TGE antibodies in milk were primarily or solely of the IgG class, although low levels of IgA antibodies were detected in three animals. Pigs in the five challenged litters received some <b>passive</b> <b>immunity,</b> the mortality being 25 %. After intramuscular injection of six pregnant swine with virulent virus, two types of clinical and immunological responses were observed, presumably dependent on whether the gut was infected by an hematogenous spread of the virus. Three became sick, showing typical clinical signs of TGE, and their immunological response was characterized by the occurrence in milk of antibodies of the IgA class. A good degree (0 % mortality) of <b>passive</b> <b>immunity</b> occurred upon challenge of the suckling pigs. In contrast, in three pregnant animals that did not sicken, antibody in milk was primarily of the IgG calss, and poor (69 % mortality) <b>passive</b> <b>immunity</b> occurred. After intramammary injections of three pregnant swine with virulent virus, no sickness was observed and the immunological response was characterized by the occurrence in colostrum of high titers of TGE antibodies that were primarily or solely of the IgG class; good (0 % mortality) <b>passive</b> <b>immunity</b> occured. The occurrence in milk of TGE antibodies of the IgA class was associated with an intestinal infection, whereas antibodies of the IgG class resulted from a parenteral antigenic stimulation. The role of antigenic stimulation of the intestinal tract for providing antibodies in milk of the IgA class is discussed. <b>Passive</b> <b>immunity</b> against intestinal infection with TGE virus was generally more complete in pigs ingesting antibodies of the IgA than of the IgG class...|$|R

30|$|In this MSIRS model, {{the flow}} of disease {{transmission}} is as follows.

40|$|The {{consequences}} of the vaccination of neonatal calves with the widely used live-attenuated temperature-sensitive (ts) bovine herpesvirus type 1 (BHV- 1) were investigated. The ts strain established acute and latent infections in all vaccinated calves either with or without <b>passive</b> <b>immunity.</b> Four of seven calves vaccinated under <b>passive</b> <b>immunity</b> became clearly BHV- 1 seronegative by different serological tests, as did uninfected control calves after the disappearance of maternal antibodies, and they remained so for long periods. A cell-mediated immune response was detected by a BHV- 1 gamma interferon assay, but this test failed to detect the seronegative latent carriers (SNLCs). While they are not detected, SNLCs represent a threat for BHV- 1 -free herds or countries. This study demonstrates that SNLCs can be easily obtained by inoculation with a live-attenuated BHV- 1 under <b>passive</b> <b>immunity</b> and that latent carrier animals without any antibody do exist.

40|$|Despite {{of their}} {{great impact on}} animal welfare and on farm incomes, {{morbidity}} and mortality rates of dairy replacement animals are often underestimated by dairy farmers. The highest risk {{of morbidity and mortality}} is usually recorded within the first months of the calf life. Because calves are born nearly deprived of antibodies, they strictly depend on colostrum ingestion to acquire the immune protection against infectious pathogens. Improper colostrum provision could lead to failure of transfer of <b>passive</b> <b>immunity</b> (FTPI), which is recognized to be the first relevant factor that affect calf health and survival. There is a lack of knowledge on mortality rates of young stock in Italian dairy farms and on the prevalence of FTPI in Italian dairy calves. Aims of this thesis were to preliminary investigate mortality rates of calves and heifers in Italian dairy farms, and then to evaluate different colostrum management practices in relationship to FTPI. Finally, it was investigated the association between <b>passive</b> <b>immunity</b> and health in calves. The median value of mortality rate in dairy farms was 5 % in young stock of less than 20 % in 71 % of the 21 enrolled farms). Colostrum management practices, in terms of delivery time, amount, and quality of the first colostrum meal, were strictly related to calf serum Ig concentration: the level of <b>passive</b> <b>immunity</b> in calves increased linearly as the management of colostrum improved. To allow the calf to nurse colostrum from the dam, supported by the farmer assistance, was the best practice of colostrum provision in terms of transfer of <b>passive</b> <b>immunity.</b> However, it implied considerable calf-dam separation distress. The use of commercial colostrum supplements (CS) could be valuable in improving the transfer of <b>passive</b> <b>immunity</b> in calves. However, the CS tested in this thesis failed to prevent FTPI and to reduce the occurrence of calf neonatal diseases. Finally, outcomes of this thesis confirmed the importance of <b>passive</b> <b>immunity</b> to calf health, and particularly to calf neonatal diarrhea. In conclusion, great improvements are needed in newborn calf management in Italian dairy farms, and proper colostrum provision is the first step to improve calf health and welfare...|$|R
