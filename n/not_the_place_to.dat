5|$|This is <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> pass judgements, {{but perhaps}} I may say that, {{as it seems}} to me, both the monks and Tischendorf deserve our deepest gratitude, Tischendorf for having alerted the monks to the {{importance}} of the manuscript, and the monks for having undertaken the daunting task of searching through the vast mass of material with such spectacular results, and then doing everything in their power to safeguard the manuscript against further loss. If we accept the statement of Uspensky, that he saw the codex in 1845, the monks must have worked very hard to complete their search and bind up the results in so short a period.|$|E
500|$|A Fast-Track {{audition}} {{that was}} to be held at SM City Sta. Mesa was canceled, leading to complaints from hopefuls and their parents. [...] After hours of waiting, a representative of ABC arrived and relocated each of the 160 frustrated applicants to other scheduled screening. [...] Meanwhile, Filipinos living in Mindanao reacted negatively to what Philippine Idol judges said after a low Gold Pass turnout at the Davao Main Auditions, with Corrales (a Cebuana herself) saying that [...] "Davao is <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> look for an Idol" [...] and [...] "all the good ones are in Cebu". [...] Corrales later clarified in the Wildcard Round that she said such a statement because of the low turnout in the Davao auditions and the even lower Gold Pass output. She added that [...] "Davao's best talents" [...] might have probably auditioned earlier in Manila.|$|E
500|$|As captain, McCauley {{tried hard}} {{to settle the dispute}} and reach a {{compromise}} with the claim-jumpers who [...] "had no desire for a peaceful settlement." [...] He was involved in a brief altercation with a claim jumper whom he approached and ordered to move. The man was armed with two revolvers and refused to move, therefore McCauley and his crew jacked the shack off its foundation and sent it down the riverbank. [...] The Protective Association, however was involved in a legal problems brought up by the claim jumpers, for [...] "willful damage to property." [...] The brief trial resulted in McCauley, as the captain being fined 40 dollars, and six other members of the committee found guilty, but being let off with court costs and an order to replace the damaged property. The Protective Association eventually managed to restore peace and order in Edmonton, and claim jumpers eventually decided that the area was <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> build on once the land for the townsite was surveyed by the Hudson's Bay Company.|$|E

Rather, the meeting offers an opportunity to bring a range of complex and sometimes inter-related issues.

2500|$|In 2013, Weir became {{involved}} in the discussion of whether the US should boycott the Sochi Olympics because of Russia's anti-gay laws. After publicly expressing his opinion, he received personal threats. He was picketed by Queer Nation outside an appearance at Barnard College in December for his position that “the Olympics are <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> make a political statement” about Russia’s anti-gay laws and “you have to respect the culture of a country you are visiting.” Weir called the experience [...] "eye-opening," [...] and went on to respond through further media interviews. Subsequently, NBC named Weir and Tara Lipinski to its figure skating coverage team in Sochi. Weir commented, [...] "I’m a gay American...I plan to be there in full support of our brothers and sisters there and not be afraid." ...|$|E
2500|$|As the {{previous}} election had been close, the by-election campaign was an intense {{one in which}} the candidates addressed meetings [...] "at breakfast time, during the dinner hour, and in the evening". One of the main campaign issues was the Clerical Tithes Bill, which the Conservative-dominated government was promoting; the Bill gave additional help to Church of England clergy and to Church schools. Oldham included many non-conformists who were opposed to the Bill. When the issue of the Bill was raised, the Liberal candidates opposed it, arguing that Parliament was <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> discuss matters of faith; Churchill initially supported it on the basis that legislation was needed to maintain law and order. A Protestant delegation representing several organisations was pleased with the pledge to support the Bill and strongly endorsed Churchill and Mawdsley. However, when Churchill (who later admitted that he knew nothing of the issue) found out how unpopular the Bill was, he declared in a speech three days before polling day that he would have voted against it in accordance with the wishes of his constituents.|$|E

2500|$|This {{preference}} for book learning {{and lack of}} intense involvement {{in the world around}} him were detrimental to Mackintosh's later career, even though he drifted back to a more liberal political stance. Hazlitt, who heard him speak in Parliament, observes that, just as his previous appointment as a judge in India was unsuited to a man who worked out his thought in terms of [...] "school-exercises", Mackintosh's mind did not fit well the defender of political causes, which needed more passionate engagement. [...] "Sir James is by education and habit and ... by the original turn of his mind, a college-man [...] in public speaking the logician takes place of the orator". Hazlitt recalls having heard him speak publicly in the House of Commons [...] "seldom ... without pain for the event." [...] The House is <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> speak only the truth. Too much [...] "interest" [...] rather than pure [...] "love of truth" [...] enters into the decisions made in Parliament. And [...] "the judgment of the House is not a balance to weigh scruples and reasons to the turn of a fraction. ... Sir James, in detailing the inexhaustible stores of his memory and reading, in unfolding the wide range of his theory and practice, in laying down the rules and the exceptions, in insisting upon the advantages and the objections with equal explicitness, would be sure to let something drop that a dexterous and watchful adversary would easily pick up and turn against him...." ...|$|E
2500|$|Liquidation is the final, most frequent, {{and most}} basic {{insolvency}} procedure. Since registered companies became {{available to the}} investing public, the Joint Stock Companies Winding-Up Act 1844 and all its successors contained a route for a company's life {{to be brought to}} an end. The basic purpose of liquidation is to conclude a company's activities and to sell off assets (i.e. [...] "liquidate", turn goods into [...] "liquid assets" [...] or money) to pay creditors, or shareholders if any value remains. Either the company (its shareholders or directors) can initiate the process through a [...] "voluntary liquidation", or the creditors can force it through a [...] "compulsory liquidation". In urgent circumstances, a provisional liquidation order can also be granted if there is a serious threat to dissipation of a company's assets: in this case, a company may not be notified. By contrast, a voluntary liquidation begins if the company's members vote to liquidate with a 75 per cent special resolution. If the directors can make a statutory declaration that the company is solvent, the directors or shareholders remain in control, but if the company is insolvent, the creditors will control the voluntary winding up. Otherwise, a [...] "compulsory liquidation" [...] may be initiated by either the directors, the company, some shareholders or creditors bringing a petition for winding up to the court. In principle, almost any member (this is usually shareholders, but can also be anyone registered on the company's member list) can bring a petition for liquidation to begin, so long as they have held shares for over six months, or there is only one shareholder. In Re Peveril Gold Mines Ltd Lord Lindley MR held that a company could not obstruct a member's right to bring a petition by requiring that two directors consented or the shareholder had over 20 per cent of share capital. A member's right to bring a petition cannot be changed by a company constitution. However, in Re Rica Gold Washing Co the Court of Appeal invented an extra-statutory requirement that a member must have a sufficient amount of money (£75 was insufficient) invested before bringing a petition. For creditors to bring a petition, there must simply be proof that the creditor is owed a debt that is due. In Mann v Goldstein the incorporated hairdressing and wig business, with shops in Pinner and Haverstock Hill, of two married couples broke down in acrimony. Goldstein and his company petitioned for winding up, claiming unpaid directors fees and payment for a wig delivery, but Mann argued that Goldstein had received the fees through ad hoc payments and another company owed money for the wigs. Ungoed Thomas J held the winding-up petition was <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> decide the debt actually existed, and it would be an abuse of process to continue.|$|E
