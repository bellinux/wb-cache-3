40|$|At last {{since the}} {{publication}} of Chomsky's Lectures on Gov-ernment and Binding (1981), it has been customary to acknow-ledge the existence of a typological distinction between «confi-gurational » and «nonconfigurationah languages.

50|$|The film {{is based}} on a novel which had been adapted for {{television}} by ITV in 1960. It was intended to use the TV script with some embellishing, but investors required several changes and a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>writers</b> <b>had</b> to work on it. Filming took place at Pinewood Studios.|$|R
50|$|A <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>writers</b> <b>have</b> {{worked with}} Kara on the {{production}} of Demon Diary. The story for volume 1 was written by Lee Chi-hyong. Lee stopped writing, {{because he had to}} prepare for the upcoming high school exams. The stories for volumes 2 through 7 were written by Lee Yun-hee.|$|R
2500|$|A <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>writers</b> <b>have</b> [...] {{produced}} {{books and}} articles that incorporate and elaborate the ideas on which health realization is based.

In addition, Sydney Banks has written several books, listed below, presenting his ideas, and his lectures are reproduced in a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> videotapes and audio CDs.|$|R
50|$|In {{the fall}} of 1989, Bart Everson was arrested for public indecency (streaking) and {{assigned}} to community service at Community Access Television Services (then Bloomington Community Access Television) in Bloomington, Indiana. It was here that Everson learned how to produce videos for local cablecast, which a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>writers</b> <b>have</b> suggested was key {{to the development of}} the series.|$|R
50|$|Although a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>writers</b> <b>have</b> {{suggested}} that Charles Walton had lent Potter money and its repayment was overdue, {{there is no}} proof that this was the case. Edith clearly did not believe it and the £300 that Walton was said to have inherited from his wife, Isabella, in 1927, was all but gone by the time he and Potter first crossed paths.|$|R
50|$|A <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>writers</b> <b>have</b> {{alleged that}} the United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) was {{involved}} in cocaine trafficking during the 1980s. These claims have led to investigations by the United States government, including hearings and reports by the United States House of Representatives, Senate, Department of Justice, and the CIA's Office of the Inspector General. The subject remains controversial.|$|R
50|$|By contrast, {{the accusations}} of {{deliberate}} textual tampering and forgery for doctrinal purposes {{are based on}} scribes making deliberate changes away from the original text. A <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>writers</b> <b>have</b> theories <b>of</b> direct forgery as the motive for the insertion of the Comma into the text. Some of these theories were developed after the 1883 Priscillian discovery and fingered Priscillian as the culprit.|$|R
50|$|Sranan as {{a written}} {{language}} has existed {{since the late}} 19th century, and was given an official spelling {{by the government of}} Suriname on July 15, 1986 (resolution 4501). A small <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>writers</b> <b>have</b> used Sranan in their work, most notably the poet Henri Frans de Ziel ("Trefossa"), who also wrote Suriname's national anthem (the second verse is sung in Sranan Tongo).|$|R
50|$|Initially it {{had been}} the purpose to publish work <b>of</b> <b>writers</b> <b>of</b> Algerian soil only. Hellal and Hadjadj noticed though, that the civil war had caused that a great <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>writers</b> <b>had</b> fled abroad. For this reason the focus changed to publish work of authors that lived in exile as well as giving a chance to authors who {{otherwise}} probably wouldnt have had a chance.|$|R
50|$|During the criminalization of the Kurdish {{language}} {{after the}} coup d’état of 1980, dengbêj (singers) and çîrokbêj (tellers) were silenced, {{and many of the}} stories had become endangered. In 1991, the language was decriminalized, yet the now highly available radios and TV’s had as an effect a diminished interest in traditional storytelling. However, a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>writers</b> <b>have</b> made great strides in the preservation of these tales.|$|R
5000|$|Fisher's {{analysis}} {{gave rise}} to the Mendelian Paradox, a paradox that remains unsolved to this very day. Thus, on the one hand, Mendel's reported data are, statistically speaking, too good to be true; on the other, [...] "everything we know about Mendel suggests that he was unlikely to engage in either deliberate fraud or in unconscious adjustment of his observations." [...] A <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>writers</b> <b>have</b> attempted to resolve this paradox.|$|R

50|$|Alternatively, {{collective}} intelligence might be constructible by better organizing humans at present levels of individual intelligence. A <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>writers</b> <b>have</b> suggested that human civilization, or {{some aspect of}} it (e.g., the Internet, or the economy), is coming to function like a global brain with capacities far exceeding its component agents. If this systems-based superintelligence relies heavily on artificial components, however, it may qualify as an AI {{rather than as a}} biology-based superorganism.|$|R
500|$|The 8th-century [...] {{contains}} a waka poem by Kakinomoto no Hitomaro that mentions a group <b>of</b> shishi; a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>writers</b> <b>have</b> concluded this animal is the serow, but others {{have pointed out}} the serow is normally solitary. [...] Heian period (794–1185) documents record gifts of serow horns brought to the capital. [...] Japan's earliest extant medical work, the [...] (808), appears to record the use of serow horn and flesh for medicinal purposes.|$|R
40|$|In the United Kingdom and the European Union, {{social policy}} {{is losing its}} {{economic}} rationalist spots at an increasingly rapid pace. Today a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>writers</b> <b>have</b> been searching {{for a way to}} name just what it is that is taking its place. In this paper Daniel Perkins, Lucy Nelms and Paul Smyth introduce the concept of the 2 ̆ 7 social investment state 2 ̆ 7, which many are finding apt to describe this transformation of social policy...|$|R

Its longest-running editor in chief was writer Boghos Snabian from 1964 to 2003 when writer Hagop Balian took over the responsibility. A <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>writers,</b> <b>have</b> contributed including Haroutioun Keghart, Dikran Vosgouni, Papken Papazian, and Vahe Oshagan.

40|$|A <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>writers</b> <b>have</b> attempted, since Mach, Boltzman and the psychologists {{of the end}} of the XIXth century, to give an {{evolutionary}} account of logical norms. Husserl famously argued that this account fails, for it is circular. I examine here some recent accounts, based on evolutionary psychology and game theory, in particular those of Gibbard, Millikan and Cosmides-Tooby. I argue that they suffer for similar circularities, although {{an evolutionary}} account of the cognitive mecanisms which underlie logical norms is feasible...|$|R
40|$|Mirror {{symmetry}} {{is often}} highly salient to human ob-servers (Barlow & Reeves, 1979), and {{the detection of}} symmetry may {{play an important role}} in mammalian vi-sion in general. Some writers view symmetry as one of the most important aspects of early visual analysis (Wage-mans, 1995). The present article examines questions at the interface between symmetry perception and visual at-tention that inquire into the existence and nature of ca-pacity limitations in the detection <b>of</b> symmetry. A <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>writers</b> <b>have</b> proposed a two-stage mode...|$|R
5000|$|Jay W. Richards, {{senior fellow}} at the Christian {{conservative}} Discovery Institute, said in 2012 that Barton's books and videos are full of [...] "embarrassing factual errors, suspiciously selective quotes, and highly misleading claims." [...] The Southern Poverty Law Center describes Barton's work as [...] "anti-gay" [...] "historical revisionism", noting that Barton has no formal training in history. A <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>writers</b> <b>have</b> called Barton's work [...] "pseudohistory", though this designation has been disputed by Robert Knight of the evangelical Coral Ridge Ministries.|$|R
2500|$|By {{the early}} 19th century, a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>writers</b> <b>had</b> {{suggested}} that London Stone was once regarded as London's [...] "Palladium", a talismanic monument in which, like the original Palladium of Troy, the city's safety and wellbeing were embodied. This view {{seemed to be}} confirmed when a pseudonymous contributor to the journal Notes and Queries in 1862 quoted a supposedly ancient proverb about London Stone {{to the effect that}} [...] "So long as the Stone of Brutus is safe, so long shall London flourish".|$|R
40|$|A <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>writers</b> <b>have</b> {{discussed}} {{the potential of}} advanced media technologies to support a more inclusive, democratic society that prioritizes values such as community and the social good. Enzensberger points out that we cannot assume that {{the potential of the}} technology will simply unfold on its own in a capitalist society. This discussion paper is designed to invite participation to share experiences of recent muzzling of Canadian government scientists, librarians and archivists and advocacy strategeis for communication rights to support democracy in Canada...|$|R
50|$|A <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>writers</b> <b>have</b> {{emphasized}} that spheres of exchange {{are set up}} {{in order to protect}} subsistence goods from being monopolized by a few group members who have control of wealth objects. Bloch and Parry alternately phrase this for market based societies; where universal money has been introduced, moral injunctions are introduced to prevent its use within the family. The family, which is responsible for long term social reproduction of individuals and the group, has to be preserved from the short-term morality of market exchange.|$|R
5000|$|Matte Blanco {{hoped that}} his logical {{underpinning}} {{of the unconscious}} would contribute to development {{in other areas of}} knowledge, apart from psychoanalysis. There are applications in theology. Other applications can be found in art and literature. A <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>writers</b> <b>have</b> explored parallels between the work of Matte Blanco and of Gregory Bateson including Margaret Arden, Horacio Etchegoyen and Jorge L. Ahumada. Papers by Arden, Etchegoyen and Ahumada are summarized in Rayner. More contemporary applications may be found in the area of Cognitive informatics.|$|R

25|$|Fantasy is {{commonly}} associated with science fiction, and a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>writers</b> <b>have</b> worked in both genres, while writers such as Anne McCaffrey, Ursula K. Le Guin, and Marion Zimmer Bradley have written works that appear to blur {{the boundary between the}} two related genres. The authors' professional organization is called the Science Fiction and Fantasy <b>Writers</b> <b>of</b> America (SFWA). SF conventions routinely have programming on fantasy topics, and fantasy authors such as J. K. Rowling have won the highest honor within the science fiction field, the Hugo Award.|$|R
50|$|A <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>writers</b> <b>have</b> {{claimed that}} the United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) is or has been {{involved}} in drug trafficking. Books on the subject that have received general notice include works by historian Alfred McCoy, English professor and poet Peter Dale Scott, and journalists Gary Webb, Michael C. Ruppert and Alexander Cockburn. These claims have led to investigations by the United States government, including hearings and reports by the United States House of Representatives, Senate, Department of Justice, and the CIA's Office of the Inspector General. The subject remains controversial.|$|R
40|$|During {{the period}} since the {{popularity}} of uncritical explanations of behavior in terms of instinct began to wane among psychologists, a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>writers</b> <b>have</b> suggested that hunger, or in behavioristic terms the tendency of animals to select and eat an adequate diet, is {{at least in part}} the result of learning (Green, 1925; Harris et al., 1931; Scott, 1947; Ghent, 1949; and Hebb, 1949).

50|$|After Emperor Haile Selassie {{returned}} to Ethiopia, Mengistu became a {{colonel in the}} Ethiopian army, and in April 1956 he was made commander of the Imperial Bodyguard, replacing General Mulugeta Bulli. Considering his later role in the attempted 1960 coup, a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>writers</b> <b>have</b> pointed out the irony that he served as executioner {{of at least one}} group {{of the participants in the}} 1943 Gojjame rebellion led by former Arbegnoch Belay Zelleke, and was entrusted with apprehending the conspirators in the 1951 attempt to assassinate Emperor Haile Selassie which was led by another former Arbegnoch Nagash Bazabeh.|$|R
40|$|Alfred Runte {{has argued}} that US National Parks were only {{established}} where government regarded the lands as worthless for economic development. A <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>writers</b> <b>have</b> applied his theory to the origin of National Parks in other regions of recent European settlement, particularly Australia. This article contests this explanation, through consideration of the establishment of National Parks in the rainforests of Queensland. The declaration of these National Parks were {{the subject of an}} extensive debate over the period of 1895 to 1915, during which it was strongly argued that they had significant potential for farming and logging...|$|R
40|$|A <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>writers</b> <b>have</b> {{suggested}} that men’s health is in ‘crisis’, {{and that we}} need greater urgency in our thinking {{about the ways in which}} health care systems meet the needs of men. 1, 2, 3 Although there is an emerging literature which specifically addresses men’s health needs, this is rela-tively new. In comparison with women’s health, for example, there are few journals on men’s health, and those we have are recent additions- the International Journal of Men’s Health was launched in 2002, whilst the Journal of Men’s Health and Gender came out this year. So is men’s health in crisis? There is...|$|R
