40|$|The {{presence}} of adenovirus DNA in clinical specimens was analyzed by {{nucleic acid hybridization}} assays by both radioactive and enzymatic detection systems. The sensitivity of the hybridization tests was {{in the range of}} 10 to 100 pg of homologous adenovirus DNA. Minimal background was noticed with unrelated viral and nonviral DNA. Twenty-four nasopharyngeal mucus aspirate specimens, collected from children with acute respiratory infection, were assayed in the hybridization tests and also by an enzyme immunoassay for adenovirus hexon antigen which was used as a reference test. Sixteen specimens positive by the enzyme immunoassay also were positive in the two nucleic acid hybridization tests, and the remaining eight specimens were negative in all of the tests. The results indicate that <b>nucleid</b> <b>acid</b> hybridization tests with both radioactive and nonradioactive probes can be used for diagnosis of microbial infections...|$|E

Here, we have tested the efficiency of RNA oligonucleotides annealing downstream of the slippery sequence to induce frameshifting in vitro. Maximal frameshifting was observed with oligonucleotides of 12 – 18 [*]nt. Antisense oligonucleotides bearing locked <b>nucleid</b> <b>acid</b> (LNA) modifications also proved to be efficient frameshift-stimulators in contrast to DNA oligonucleotides. The number, sequence and location of LNA bases in an otherwise DNA oligonucleotide have to be carefully manipulated to obtain optimal levels of frameshifting.

40|$|The diploma {{thesis is}} focused on optimalization of {{temperature}} gradient gel electrophoresis (TGGE) for diagnosing of mutations in the GJB 2 gene. This gene encodes the protein connexin 26, {{which is part of}} the inner ear. Mutation in the gene GJB 2 are the most common cause of congenital deafness, usually with autosomal recessive inheritance. DNA samples with known genotypes, which included the mutation c. 35 delG, W 24 X and c. 358 - 360 delGAG were selected for the optimization heteroduplex analysis TGGE. The samples were provided by the Department of Medical Genetics, University Hospital Hradec Králové. TGGE method is used to separate <b>nucleid</b> <b>acids.</b> Compared to conventional electrophoresis, there is created a temperature gradient across the gel. The sample of DNA moves in an electric field at a speed proportional to their size. However, at the specific temperature, the strands begin to separate, which results in slowing down the speed of migration. The melting temperature is highly dependent on the primary structure of the analyzed segment of DNA, which allows to differentiate the same lenght fragment having different base sequences. Optimization was performed in two overlapping sections of the encoding part of the gene GJB 2. Useful primers and analytical conditions have been found for both sections of [...] ...|$|R

The conditions of the subsequent release absorbed DNA to the elution buffer (pH of elution buffer, temperature and time of elution) were optimized. The quality of eluted DNA and the presence of target DNA were examined by PCR and q-PCR using domain-specific Bacteria and genus-specific Lactobacillus primer set.

40|$|An {{impaired}} {{expression of}} interferon-α regulated genes {{has been reported}} in patients with either systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or Aicardi-Goutières syndrome (AGS), a rare monogenic encephalopathy with onset in infancy. One of mutations causing AGS is located in the TREX 1 gene on chromosome 3. Heterozygous mutations in TREX 1 were reported in SLE patients. TREX 1 is a DNA exonuclease with specificity for ssDNA. An impairment of its activity may result in the accumulation of <b>nucleid</b> <b>acid.</b> A recent study described a significant association between a haplotype including several common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of TREX 1 and neurological manifestations in European SLE patients. Fifty-one SLE patients were screened for TREX 1 gene, and the corresponding data were collected from clinical charts. A novel heterozygous variant (p. Asp 130 Asn) was identified in one patient and in none of 150 controls. A missense variation was located in one of the three active sites of the gene and was classified as probably damaging. Variations of SNP rs 11797 were detected in 33 SLE patients and a variation of rs 3135944 in one. A significantly higher rate of the minor allele (T nucleotide) of SNP rs 11797 was found in SLE patients with neuropsychiatric manifestations [12 / 16 (75 %) vs 28 / 86 (32. 5 %) O= 0. 002, odds ratio= 6. 42 95 % confidence interval (1. 7 - 26. 2) ]. Only 1 out of 8 patients (12. 5 %) with neuropsychiatric SLE carried the wild-type form in homozygosity. Although we analyzed a small number of patients, we found a novel variation of TREX 1, which may be pathogenic.

40|$|Protein {{interactions}} play {{a critical}} role in the regulation of many biological events and their study in a high-throughput format has become a key area of proteomic research. <b>Nucleid</b> <b>Acid</b> Programmable Protein Arrays (NAPPA) technology allows the construction of protein arrays from cDNA expression libraries in high-throughput cell-free systems to study protein interaction and functions. Tick saliva contains antihemostatic, anti-inflammatory, and immunosuppressive proteins that counteract the host hemostatic, immune, and inflammatory responses allowing the ingestion of host blood and facilitating its infection by the tick-borne pathogens. Identification of such proteins and their functions could help in the selection of antigenic targets for the development of antitick and transmission-blocking vaccines. With that aim, we have prepared a cDNA expression library from the salivary glands of Ornithodoros moubata and subsequently produced a self-assembled protein microarray using 480 randomly selected clones from that library. The reproducibility of the array, its representativeness of the tick salivary protein repertoire, and the functionality of the in situ expressed proteins have been checked, demonstrating that it is a suitable tool for the identification and functional characterization of soft tick salivary molecules that interact with host proteins. Several clones in the array were shown to bind to human recombinant P-selectin. One of them was a likely secreted tick phospholipase A 2, which may represent a potential new ligand for P-selectin. As these salivary molecules are likely involved in blood meal acquisition through the modulation of the host immune and hemostatic responses, this new high-throughput tool could open new avenues for development of new therapeutic agents and control strategies against ticks and tick-borne pathogens. © 2012 American Chemical Society.

Suggestions to the negative effect of NSP on digestibility of fat were also elaborated by agar diffusion assays. However, the obtained results of lipase and bile salt hydrolase activity gave no evidence that a relation exists between the activity of these enzymes and the well documented depression in fat digestibility when NSP are added to broiler diets. Higher activities of lipases were expected in samples from birds fed the maize based diet. However, higher activities were observed in animals fed the wheat and rye based diets. This could indicate regulatory processes to compensate inferior fat digestion. Higher activities of lipases in the duodenum of the enzyme supplemented group in comparison to the group with wheat and rye diet indicate a better antiperistaltic movement of digesta. Higher activities of bacte-rial bile salt hydrolases due to high intestinal viscosity as described in literature could not be ob-served. Microbial communities of the digestive tract of broilers were characterized by hybridization of RNA from digesta samples with specific oligonucleotide probes on the level of bacterial groups and species. Hybridization results of oligonucleotide probes have shown that specific hybridization parameters could be achieved for all of the group specific oligonucleotide probes. According to these results the oligonucleotide probes S-D-Bact- 0338 -a-A- 18 (total bacterial 16 S rRNA), S-G-Bact- 0303 -a-A- 17 (Bacteroides-Pretovella-cluster), S-*-Chis- 0150 -a-A- 23 (Clostridium histolyticum-group), 16 E 1 (E. coli and Shigella spp.), S-G-Enc- 038 -a-A- 18 (Enterococcus spp.), S-F-Lact- 0770 -a-A- 24 (Lac-tobacillus spp.) and S-G-Bif- 1432 -a-A- 21 (Bifidobacterium spp.) were used to screen RNA extracts of digesta samples. However, only S-S-Ecaec- 0181 -a-A- 24 (E. caecorum), S-S-Efaes- 1237 -b-A- 17, S-S-Efeas- 203 -a-A- 20 (E. faecalis and E. faecium), and S-S-casflaga- 0185 -a-A- 21 (comprising E. casseliflavus, E. flavescens, E. gallinarum, but specific only for E. gallinarum) that were developed at the Institute of Animal Nutrition, Free University Berlin, have shown specific results on species level. Sequence candidates tested for their applicability as oligonucleotide probes to detect E. asini, E. avium/E. raffinosus, E. columbae, E. faecium and E. hirae could not be used to screen RNA extracts due to their lack of specificity. 23 S rRNA oligonucleotide probes taken from literature references to detect E. faecium (DB 6), E. avium, E. malodoratus, E. pseudoavium and E. raffinosus (DB 9), E. durans and E. hirae (Eduhi 9 b), and E. gallinarum (Ega 9 b) have shown no signals with the tested conditions. S-S-Lacet- 0061 -a-A- 25 (L. acetolerans), S-S-Lacid- 2519 -a-A- 20 (L. acidophilus), S-S-Lamy- 0499 - a-A- 24 (L. amylophilus), S-S-Lfer- 061 -a-A- 26 (L. fermentum), S-S-Lgas- 0054 -a-A- 24 (L. gasseri) and S-S-Lreu- 0485 -a-A- 23 (L. reuteri) had been used successfully in earlier experiments at the Insti-tute of Animal Nutrition, Free University Berlin. Most of the probes presented a linear relationship between chemiluminescence and amount of RNA. This could be used to calculate the amount of specific RNA in the samples per ýg total RNA. In hybridization experiments using RNA extracts from digesta samples S-S-Lfer- 061 -a-A- 26 showed an exponential relationship between amount of RNA and intensity of signals. No relation-ship was observed for the enterobacterial probe 16 E 1. The lack of information about the content of ribosomal RNA of single bacterial cells made it diffi-cult to compare results of hybridization experiments with data from cultivation methods published in literature. Diets with different contents of soluble NSP and supplementation of a wheat and rye based diet led to different amounts of ribosomal RNA of selected bacterial groups and species. In comparison to the maize fed broilers total bacterial metabolic activities and metabolic activities of enterobacteria and enterococci were shifted distal parts of small intestine in birds fed the wheat and rye based diet. Furthermore, metabolic activities of lactobacilli decreased. Xylanase supplementation led to lower metabolic activities of enterobacteria and higher activities of lactobacilli than in the unsupple-mented group with wheat and rye based diet. The shift of total bacterial activities to the lower parts of the intestine was less pronounced. Hybridization of selected species of enterococci and lactoba-cilli showed qualitative modifications within bacterial groups according to different diets.

Urethritis is characterized by discharge, dysuria and/or urethral discomfort but may be asymptomatic. The diagnosis of urethritis is confirmed by demonstrating an excess of polymorpho-nuclear leucocytes (PMNLs) in a stained smear. An excess of mononuclear leucocytes in the smear indicates a viral etiology.

40|$|Uspješna transplantacija bubrega je optimalna metoda liječenja bolesnika koji se nalaze u završnom stadiju kronične bubrežne bolesti. Za uspjeh same transplantacije, kao i dugoročnog preživljenja bolesnika i njegovog transplantata, nužna je detaljna evaluacija primatelja i potencijalnog darivatelja organa, bilo da se radi o kadaveričnom ili živom darivatelju. Poseban problem u sklopu infektivnih bolesti su virusi hepatitisa, osobito virus hepatitisa B (HBV) i C (HCV), a u novije vrijeme sve se više spominje i virus hepatitisa E (HEV) kao značajan uzrok kroničnog hepatitisa u populaciji bolesnika s transplantatom. Unatoč poboljšanju preventivnih mjera posljednjeg desetljeća incidencija virusnih hepatitisa je u bolesnika koji se liječe postupcima hemodijalize značajno smanjena. Međutim, njihova incidencija i dalje je veća u toj skupini bolesnika kao i u bolesnika kojima je transplantiran bubreg u odnosu na opću populaciju. Virusni hepatitisi su značajan čimbenik povećanog morbiditeta i mortaliteta u tim populacijama bolesnika, ali i prema većini studija značajan čimbenik disfunkcije bubrežnog transplantata. Naime, u bolesnika koji su podvrgnuti transplantaciji bubrega primarni cilj je očuvanje dobre funkcije transplantata, uz primjenu učinkovite, a što manje toksične imunosupresivne terapije. Osim toga, nužno je praćenje i adekvatna terapija virusnih hepatitisa, s obzirom na dobro poznatu činjenicu da te infekcije vode prema kroničnom hepatitisu, cirozi jetre i hepatocelularnom karcinomu. Nadalje, HBV i HCV mogu inducirati nastanak de novo membranskog glomerulonefritisa u bubrežnom transplantatu. Renal {{transplantation}} {{has significantly}} improved survival {{of patients with}} end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Transplantation is the best treatment in this population of patients. Despite the introduction of various preventive measures, viral hepatitis, i. e. hepa¬titis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections, are still a major problem because they are common in patients on re¬nal replacement therapy {{as well as in}} allograft recipients. They are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in this patient population. In recent years, hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection has been added as an emergent cause of chronic hepatitis in solid organ transplantation, mainly in renal and liver allograft recipients. Most studies show higher mortality in renal transplant recipi¬ents (RTRs) infected with HBV, compared with RTRs without HBV infection, although this topic is still under debate. Furthermore, HCV infection in RTRs is associated with a significant reduction in patient and graft survival due to liver disease and septic com¬plications related to cirrhosis and immunosuppressive therapy. The immunosuppressive therapy prescribed after transplantation modifies the natural history of chronic HCV infection. Given the high prevalence of HCV and HBV infections in RTRs, a growing incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma and the possible contribution of immunosuppression might be expected in these patients. Therefore, after renal transplantation, early screening with abdominal ultrasound (every 3 months in cirrhotic patients and every 6 - 12 months in non-cirrhotic RTRs) is necessary when the risk factors such as HBV and HCV are present. The European Asso¬ciation for the Study of the Liver (EASL) recommends that all HbsAg-positive patients who are candidates for solid organ trans¬plantation should be treated with nucleoside analogs. The KDIGO guidelines recommend that all HbsAg-positive RTRs receive prophylaxis with tenofovir, entecavir or lamivudine; however, tenofovir and entecavir are preferable to lamivudin. Viral suppres¬sion by inhibiting necro-inflammation may result in reduced fibrosis, thereby improving transplant survival. Active HCV infection in a dialysis patient requires evaluation of liver fibrosis. Antiviral therapy should be given to all HCV-infected dialysis patients in order to achieve a sustained virologic response (SVR) not only to avoid subsequent hepatic deterioration but also to limit the risks of HCV-related posttransplant de novo glomerulonephritis. Systematic vaccination of all HbsAg-negative patients is the best preventive treatment of HBV infection. HbsAg positive donors are only used occasionally, whereas the use of hepatitis B core antibody (HbcAb) +, HbsAg negative donors is more common but remains somewhat controversial. The presence of antibody to HCV is indicative of HCV infection because antibody to HCV appears in peripheral blood within two months of HCV exposure. However, it is important to emphasize that detection of antibody to HCV by serologic screening of the donor is not predictive of HCV transmission. Approximately 50 % of patients positive for antibody to HCV have detectable hepatitis C viremia by PCR analysis of peripheral blood. Therefore, all organ donors with PCR analysis positive for HCV will transmit HCV to RTRs. On the other hand, the risk of transmission from an organ donor with negative PCR analysis is unclear. Another problem in the evalua¬tion of the potential donors of solid organs is the fact that antibody testing by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) will not detect recent infections. The use of <b>nucleid</b> <b>acid</b> testing (NAT) could be useful because it involves amplification of viral gene products and thus is not dependent on antibody formation. Therefore, by using this method the period between the infection and detectability, which is known as the window period, could be reduced. However, this method is expensive and time consuming...|$|E
