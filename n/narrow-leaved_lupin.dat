50|$|The {{disease and}} weed {{spectrum}} of the <b>narrow-leaved</b> <b>lupin</b> is different from most major crops and {{it is able to}} improve the soil (see Use). Therefore, it is a valuable partner in intensive crop rotations.|$|E
50|$|Like other legumes, the <b>narrow-leaved</b> <b>lupin</b> fixes {{nitrogen}} in a symbiotic interaction with different {{bacteria in the}} rhizosphere. Bacteria living in this rhizosphere include Bradyrhizobium lupinii or the newly discovered species Kribbella lupini.The <b>narrow-leaved</b> <b>lupin</b> is an erect, branching herb sometimes exceeding one meter. There are reduced-branching cultivars. Each palmate leaf is divided into 5 to 9 linear leaflets under 4 centimeters long. The herbage is slightly hairy in some areas. The inflorescence bears many flowers in shades of blue, violet, pink, or white. The fruit is a legume pod containing seeds of varying colors from dark gray to brown to white, or speckled or mottled.Lupinus angustifolius has a high content of alkaloids, e.g. lupanin or angustifolin. However, cultivars with a low alkaloid content have been bred. These low alkaloid cultivars are called sweet lupins.|$|E
5000|$|Lupinus angustifolius is {{a species}} of lupin known by many common names, {{including}} narrowleaf lupin, <b>narrow-leaved</b> <b>lupin</b> and blue lupin. It is native to Eurasia and northern Africa and naturalized in parts of Australia and North America. It has been cultivated for over 6000 yearsas a food crop for its edible legume seeds, as a fodder for livestock and for green manure.|$|E
50|$|The <b>narrow-leaved</b> <b>lupin</b> {{needs to}} be {{harvested}} {{as soon as the}} grain reaches a moisture of about 12%. The straw usually isn't ripened at this point, but further delay of harvest would increase losses from shattering of the pods and lodging. The harvest is done with machinery used for cereals. Swathing is not widely applied. However, it can be a good alternative to reduce harvest losses in case harvest is delayed.|$|E
5000|$|He {{also makes}} much use of green manure crops (like {{stinging}} nettle, phacelia, yellow, white and <b>narrow-leaved</b> <b>lupin,</b> garden pea, grass pea, fodder & Kidney vetch, yellow, subterranean, Crimson, Persian, Egyptian, red & white sweet clover, Birdsfoot trefoil, lucerne, black medick, Sainfoin, Serradella, fiddleneck, sunflowers, Jerusalem artichoke, Gold-of-pleasure, ...)and grows these crops extensively on his farm. He leaves them standing in autumn, rather than digging them in. He instead relies on natural decay of the plants. He often {{relies on the}} natural spreading of {{the seeds of the}} crops for their re-sowing.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>narrow-leaved</b> <b>lupin</b> is sown {{as early}} as {{possible}} in the spring, to have the growing season as long as possible. Another reason for early sowing is its sensitivity to high temperature in spring. Lupins react with a higher yield loss, when they are sown late, than other crops (e.g. cereals) do. The optimum seed density depends on the site yield potential [...] and is generally higher in non-branching cultivars than in branching ones. The variance is high, 14 to 138 plants per m2 [...] are an optimal plant density, depending on the yield potential of the site. On most grounds, a plant density around 80 plants per m2 would be the optimum.|$|E
30|$|In sandy soils, the {{beneficial}} effect of grain legumes {{after three years}} of study was registered in terms of higher content of SOC compared with soils with oats (7.21  g kg− 1 DM, on average). Specifically, cultivation of pea exerted the most positive action to organic carbon content (7.58  g kg− 1, after harvest, on average), whereas <b>narrow-leaved</b> <b>lupin</b> had the least effect (7.23  g kg− 1, on average) [30]. In southern America (Argentina), the intercropping of soybean with maize at different rates favoured a SOC accumulation of 23.6  g C kg− 1 versus 21.8  g C kg− 1 of the sole maize; the greatest potential for enhancing SOC stocks occurred in the 2 : 3 (maize:soybean) intercrop configuration [11]. Furthermore, just only amending the soil with soybean residues allows to obtain an increase of 38.5 % in SOC [11].|$|E
40|$|The paper investigates seed coat {{characteristics}} (as {{a percentage}} of overall seed diameter) in Lupinus angustifolius L., a potential forage crop. In the study ten L. angustifolius genotypes, including three Polish cultivars, two Australian cultivars, three mutants originated from cv. 'Emir', and one Belarusian and one Australian breeding line were evaluated. The highest seed coat percentage was recorded in cultivars 'Sonet' and 'Emir'. The lowest seed coat thickness percentage (below 20 %) was noted for breeding lines 11257 - 19, LAG 24 and cultivar 'Zeus' (17. 87 %, 18. 91 % 19. 60 %, respectively). Despite having low seed weight, the Australian line no. 11257 - 19 was characterized by a desirable proportion of seed coat to the weight of seeds. In general, estimation of the correlation coefficient indicated a tendency that larger seeds had thinner coats. Scanning Electron Microscopy images showed low variation of seed coat sculpture {{and the top of}} seeds covered with a cuticle. Most of the studied genotypes were characterized by a cristatepapillate seed coat surface, formed by elongated polygonal cells. Only breeding line no. 11267 - 19 had a different shape of the cells building the surface layer of the coat. In order to illustrate genetic diversity among the genotypes tested, 24 ISSR primers were used. They generated a total of 161 polymorphic amplification products in 10 evaluated <b>narrow-leaved</b> <b>lupin</b> genotypes...|$|E
40|$|World {{phosphorus}} {{resources are}} limited. Therefore recycling of phosphorus from waste materials is important, and struvite (MgNH 4 PO 46 H 2 O) {{is a common}} precipitate recovered from waste water treatments or during anaerobic digestion of manure. Our approach is to evaluate how mobilization of phosphorus may differ when two different species (<b>narrow–leaved</b> <b>Lupin</b> and Maize) are grown in an acidic or alkaline sand with phosphorus added as either struvite or as superphosphate. Nitrogen was applied as ammonium or nitrate as an important factor that could affect phosphorus availability by changing soil pH. The parameters to evaluate the mobilization of phosphorus from struvite were phosphorus uptake, phosphorus present in the soil and comparison of plant performance within the different treatments. Lupines are capable of symbiotically fixing atmospheric nitrogen, {{as well as to}} release phosphate-mobilizing carboxylates. These two traits make lupines good candidates forstudying nutrient mobilization in the rhizosphere. In order to observe if citrate (mimicking root exudates) was able to make the P from the struvite more available compared with water, our study also included a flushing experiment with citrate in columns filled with two different sands of acidic and alkaline pH mixed with struvite. We predict that lupine growing on alkaline sand will have better access to phosphorus in struvite (than on acidic sand) due to its ability to acidify the rhizosphere via exudation of carboxylates. Thus we expect lupine to have higher biomass when growing on alkaline sand with an ammonium supply...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of a 3 -year field experiment designed to evaluate the content of organic carbon in brown soil (Haplic Cambisol Dystric) developed from a light loamy sand under legumes cultivation. Experimental factors were: species of legume crop (colorful-blooming pea (Pisum sativum), chickling vetch (Lathyrus sativus), narrow-leafed lupin (Lupinus angustifolius), methods of legumes tillage (legumes in pure culture and in mixture with naked oats) and mineral N fertilization (0, 30, 60, 90 kg N·ha− 1). Cultivation of legumes on sandy soil did not result in an increase of organic carbon content in the soil after harvest as compared to the initial situation, i. e. 7. 39 vs. 7. 76 g·kg− 1 dry matter (DM), on average, respectively. However, there was the beneficial effect of this group of plants on soil abundance in organic matter, the manifestation of which was higher content of organic carbon in soils after legume harvest as compared to soils with oats grown (7. 21 g·kg− 1 DM, on average). Among experimental crops, cultivation of pea exerted the most positive action to organic carbon content (7. 58 g·kg− 1, after harvest, on average), whereas <b>narrow-leaved</b> <b>lupin</b> had the least effect on organic carbon content (7. 23 g·kg− 1, on average). Pure culture and greater intensity of legume cultivation {{associated with the use of}} higher doses of mineral nitrogen caused less reduction in organic carbon content in soils after harvest...|$|E
