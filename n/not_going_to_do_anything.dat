500|$|On November 21, the {{prosecution}} introduced the letters, telegrams, and checks into evidence. On November 22, Harland testified that Burton had stated: [...] "I am <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> inconsistent with my {{duty as a}} Senator." [...] Mahaney testified to the in-person payment {{and the destruction of}} the letters at Burton's request on March 22, 1902. Inspector Cochran testified that Burton represented Rialto before him.|$|E
500|$|Lin {{sent his}} résumé and a DVD of {{highlights}} {{of his high}} school basketball career to all of the Ivy League schools; the University of California, Berkeley; and his dream schools, Stanford University and the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). The Pac-10 schools wanted him to walk-on, rather than be actively recruited or offered a sports scholarship. Harvard and Brown were the only teams that guaranteed him a spot on their basketball teams, but Ivy League schools do not offer athletic scholarships. Rex Walters, University of San Francisco men's basketball coach and retired NBA player, said NCAA limits on coaches' recruiting visits had reduced Lin's chances. [...] "Most colleges start recruiting a guy in the first five minutes they see him because he runs really fast, jumps really high, does the quick, easy thing to evaluate," [...] Walters said. Lin added, [...] "I just think in order for someone to understand my game, they have to watch me more than once, because I'm <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> that's extra flashy or freakishly athletic." ...|$|E
500|$|As the Wisconsin primary loomed {{in early}} April, Nixon's only {{obstacle}} {{seemed to be}} preventing his supporters from voting in the Democratic primary for Senator Eugene McCarthy of Minnesota as a protest against President Johnson. However, Johnson [...] before the primary, meanwhile Governor Reagan's name was {{on the ballot in}} Wisconsin, but he did not campaign in the state and was still not a declared candidate. Nixon won the primary with 80% followed by Reagan with 11% and Stassen with 6%. With Johnson removed from the race, Nixon fell behind Democratic candidates Eugene McCarthy, Hubert Humphrey and Robert Kennedy in head-to-head match-ups. At the end of April, Nixon called for a moratorium on criticism of the Johnson policy in Vietnam as negotiations were underway: [...] "The one man who can do anything about peace is Lyndon Johnson, and I'm <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> to undercut him." [...] However, the Democratic candidates for president remained fair game for criticism. He argued that [...] "A divided Democratic Party cannot unite a divided country; a united Republican Party can." [...] He also began to discuss economics more frequently, announcing plans to cut spending while criticizing the Democrats' policy of raising taxes. During a question and answer session with the American Society of Newspaper Editors, Nixon spoke out of turn, receiving numerous interruptions of applause. The largest came when he addressed the issue of crime, proclaiming that [...] "there cannot be order in a free society without progress, and there cannot be progress without order." ...|$|E

500|$|Reactions to the {{transmissions}} were mixed, {{triggering a}} media debate concerning the ethical implications of mixing rock entertainment with human tragedy. The Edge said, [...] "A lot of nights {{it felt like}} quite an abrupt interruption that was probably not particularly welcomed {{by a lot of}} people in the audience. You were grabbed out of a rock concert and given a really strong dose of reality and it was quite hard sometimes to get back to something as frivolous as a show having watched five or ten minutes of real human suffering." [...] Mullen worried that the band were exploiting the Bosnians' suffering for entertainment. In 2002, he said, [...] "I can't remember anything more excruciating than those Sarajevo link-ups. It was like throwing a bucket of cold water over everybody. You could see your audience going, 'What the fuck are these guys doing?' But I'm proud to have been a part of a group who were trying to do something." [...] During a transmission for the band's concert at Wembley Stadium, three women in Sarajevo told Bono via satellite, [...] "We know you're <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> for us. You're going to go back to a rock show. You're going to forget that we even exist. And we're all going to die." [...] Some people close to the band joined the War Child charity project, including Brian Eno. Writer Bill Flanagan believes that the link-ups accomplished Bono's goal for Zoo TV of [...] "illustrating onstage the obscenity of idly flipping from a war on CNN to rock videos on MTV". U2 vowed to perform in Sarajevo someday, eventually fulfilling this commitment on their 1997 PopMart Tour.|$|E
500|$|Reactions to the {{transmissions}} were mixed. Many fans {{felt the}} transmissions disrupted {{the flow of}} the concerts. Most of the British press was highly critical. One writer for NME wrote, [...] "The Bosnian linkup was beyond bad taste. It was insulting." [...] Bono thought that they were bringing the public's attention to an important event, though he admitted that the link-ups were the most difficult thing the band had done in their career. Guitarist The Edge said, [...] "We don't normally see that kind of cold hard news. We get a very sanitized, editorialized take on everything... When you watch the television news, you are getting something palatable, whereas this was really quite unpalatable most of the time. And for that reason I think it affected people very much, including us." [...] Mullen worried that the band were exploiting the Bosnians' suffering for entertainment. During a transmission from the band's concert at Wembley Stadium, three women in Sarajevo asked what the band intended to do to help before telling Bono, [...] "We know you're <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> for us. You're {{going to go back to}} a rock show. You're going to forget that we even exist. And we're all going to die." [...] During a transmission to a Glasgow concert, a Bosnian woman told the concert audience, [...] "We would like to hear the music, too, but we hear only the screams of wounded and tortured people and raped women." [...] Some people were upset by the circumstances of Sarajevo and were motivated to join the War Child charity project, including U2 producer Brian Eno. Despite U2's obligation to the tour and their inability to perform in Sarajevo during the war, they vowed to play the city someday.|$|E
2500|$|In August of 2017, University Chancellor Robert Jones {{made the}} {{decision}} to ban the school's [...] "War Chant", in response to critic claims that said the music stereotyped Native Americans and prolonged the divisive debate over Chief Illiniwek. [...] ""Debating it was <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> but kind of re-initiate a lot of the agony and the angst that have been a cancer that has been eating away at this university for more than a decade," [...] Jones said of the closed-session ruling.|$|E
6000|$|... "You're <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> anything," [...] he said half-coherently. [...] "I'll {{give myself}} up. I can't {{stay here and}} make trouble for the boys." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> {{any more}} shouting," [...] said Madden, [...] "even though you propose {{the health of}} the chancellor, vice-chancellor, and two members." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Hopkins, coolly, [...] "I guess you're <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it long. You {{know the}} maxim about fooling the people. It can't be done." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Pecksniff,' cried Martin, in a tremble, 'what {{does all}} this mean? You are <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> in haste, you may regret!' ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'No,' pursued Mr Boffin; 'because {{that would}} express, as I {{understand}} it, {{that you were}} <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> to deserve your money. But you are; you are.' ...|$|E
2500|$|In a July 2010 {{interview}} with Metal Injection, Glenn Danzig {{was asked if}} he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> make another Danzig record after Deth Red Sabaoth. His response was, [...] "I don't know, we'll see. With the way record sales are now...I won't do some stupid pro-tool record in someone's living room where all the drum beats are stolen from somebody and just mashed together...and I'm <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> that if I can't do a record how I want <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it, and if it's not financially feasible, I'm just <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> one." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Come, {{this is not}} bad!' {{said the}} Soldier. 'But what am I to give you, old Witch; for surely you are <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> this for nothing?' ...|$|R

60|$|MRS. HIGGINS. Well, I'm {{very glad}} you're <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> foolish, Mr. Doolittle. For this solves {{the problem of}} Eliza's future. You can provide for her now.|$|E
6000|$|... "Thought I {{was going}} to run away, eh? Well, you're mistaken, Sammy, my son. I'm <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> of the sort. You know how bad I felt yesterday." ...|$|E

6000|$|Prothero {{stuck up}} {{his knees and}} rested his night-shirted arms upon them. [...] "I don't want to leave Moscow," [...] he said, [...] "and I'm <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is {{just what}} I'm <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> I wouldn't have a {{tenement}} house on my conscience for a million dollars not as they are now," [...] said Rose decidedly.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything,</b> except take it ashore {{and hand}} it to the Sailing Committee. That it has been cut is certain. As to who cut it, there is no shadow of evidence." ...|$|E
6000|$|Breckenridge {{twisted in}} his seat, {{and looked at}} him. [...] "Pshaw!" [...] he said. [...] "It {{would be a good}} deal less risky than meeting the Sheriff at the bridge. You are <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> senseless, Larry?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed he's <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> of the kind, Annie," [...] said Mrs. Putney. [...] "I {{shall not}} let him. I shall make him drop {{the whole affair}} now, and let it die out, and let us be at peace again, as Mr. Peck says." ...|$|E
5000|$|Mellencamp {{wrote one}} song {{specifically}} for Room 414 at the Gunter Hotel, {{which is the}} exact room where Johnson recorded in November 1936. He told the San Antonio Express-News, [...] "It's called 'Right Behind Me' or 'Right Behind Us,' I haven't decided yet. I wrote it just for this room. I {{could have done this}} in my studio. But I want <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it this way, and if I can't do what I want at this point, I'm <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it.

6000|$|Dorian Gray {{shook his}} head. [...] "No, Harry, I have done too many dreadful {{things in my}} life. I am <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> any more. I began my good actions yesterday." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But we are <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> anything," [...] said Mr. Peacocke. [...] "I {{have not}} the {{slightest}} idea of shooting the gentleman; and he has just as little of shooting me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Darlington is <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything.</b> My brother {{paid the}} bill at last. George doesn't {{speak to me}} either.... I don't care," [...] he added, with a sigh. [...] "As long as one has this stuff, one doesn't want friends. I think I have had too many friends." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But, Mr. Grey," [...] {{burst out}} Mrs. Curtis, [...] "you don't {{mean that you}} are <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> to that man!

6000|$|... "Of course I do," [...] said Fordham, in a {{much more}} decided tone than he had used in the morning. [...] "I'm <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> so barbarous as to leave them to some German practitioner; and when we are here, I don't see why they should have advice out from home—-not half so good probably." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I guess I'm spoiling yours, too," [...] he answered. [...] "I'm {{not worth}} it. I might have <b>done</b> {{something}} <b>to</b> win you and keep you. I'm <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> much without you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Please do not {{be quite}} idiotic, Bertie. There is one {{head of the family}} who is {{certainly}} <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it, and that is Gussie. And you are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> America to stop him.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well--er--no. The fact is, he's <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it at all, don't you know." [...] Spennie {{inspected}} the red {{end of his}} cigarette closely. [...] "As a matter of fact, it's kind of broken off." ...|$|R
