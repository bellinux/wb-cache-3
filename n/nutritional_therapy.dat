5|$|Hanegraaff {{identified}} the second main healing current in the New Age movement as being holistic health. This {{emerged in the}} 1970s out of the free clinic movement of the 1960s, and has various connections with the Human Potential Movement. It emphasises {{the idea that the}} human individual is a holistic, interdependent relationship between mind, body, and spirit, and that healing is a process in which an individual becomes whole by integrating with the powers of the universe. A very wide array of methods are utilised within the holistic health movement, {{with some of the most}} common including acupuncture, reiki, biofeedback, chiropractic, yoga, kinesiology, homeopathy, aromatherapy iridology, massage and other forms of bodywork, meditation and visualisation, <b>nutritional</b> <b>therapy,</b> psychic healing, herbal medicine, healing using crystals, metals, music, chromotherapy, and reincarnation therapy. The use of crystal healing has become a particularly prominent visual trope within the New Age; this practice was not common in esotericism prior to their adoption in the New Age milieu.|$|E

In the book she discusses <b>nutritional</b> <b>therapy</b> for hundreds of ailments, including heart disease, high cholesterol, ulcers, diabetes, and arthritis, and often contradicts the dietary advice given by many physicians. The book is documented with over 2,000 footnoted references to studies reported in medical journals and books.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES To improve {{malnutrition}} {{awareness and}} management in our department of general internal medicine; to assess patients' nutritional risk; and {{to evaluate whether}} an online educational program leads {{to an increase in}} basic knowledge and more frequent <b>nutritional</b> <b>therapies.</b> METHODS A prospective pre-post intervention study at a university department of general internal medicine was conducted. Nutritional screening using Nutritional Risk Score 2002 (NRS 2002) was performed, and prescriptions of <b>nutritional</b> <b>therapies</b> were assessed. The intervention included an online learning program and a pocket card for all residents, who had to fill in a multiple-choice questions (MCQ) test about basic nutritional knowledge before and after the intervention.

40|$|Nitric oxide (NO) {{is formed}} from {{arginine}} by the enzyme {{nitric oxide synthase}} (NOS). Asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) can inhibit NO production by competing with arginine for NOS binding. Therefore, the net amount of NO might be indicated by the arginine/ADMA ratio. In turn, arginine can be metabolized by the enzyme arginase, and ADMA by the enzyme dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH). While ADMA has been implicated as a cardiovascular risk factor, arginine supplementation has been indicated as a treatment in cardiac diseases. This review discusses the roles of ADMA and arginine in the failing heart and its vasculature. Furthermore, it proposes <b>nutritional</b> <b>therapies</b> to improve NO availabilit...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Modern {{advances}} in <b>nutritional</b> <b>therapies</b> {{have led to}} the specific use of arginine supplementation for protein synthesis, cell signaling through the produc-tion of nitric oxide, and cell proliferation through its metabolism to ornithine and to polyamines. Arginine is classified as a nonessential amino acid that becomes a conditionally essential substrate in stressed adults. Argi-nine has been shown to enhance wound strength and collagen deposition in artificial incisional wounds in rodents and humans. A role for dietary intervention in the form of arginine supplementation has been proposed to normalize or enhance wound healing in humans. Although this hypothesis is frequently discussed, the therapeutic effect of arginine supplementation on chronic wound healing in humans is still undetermined an...|$|R
30|$|This study {{identified}} approximately 453 metabolites {{from the}} rice bran metabolome, {{many of which}} are described herein as cofactors & vitamins, amino acids and secondary metabolites. These metabolic pathways, among others found in rice bran, have shown positive health effects in animals and humans. The wide range of phytochemicals found in rice bran are likely working synergystically to contribute to rice bran’s functional food properties. The ability of rice bran to fight both infectious and chronic diseases may be in part due to synergistic combinations of phytochemicals, and alongside metabolism by the gut microbiota (Borresen et al. 2016; Sheflin et al. 2016; Sheflin et al. 2015). Rice bran biochemical composition merits further investigation for multiple <b>nutritional</b> <b>therapies</b> and medical food applications.|$|R
50|$|The {{variety of}} {{alternative}} medical systems which developed {{during this period}} can be approximately categorised according to the form of treatment advocated. These were: those employing spiritual or psychological therapies, such as hypnosis (mesmerism); <b>nutritional</b> <b>therapies</b> based upon special diets, such as medical botanism; drug and biological therapies such as homeopathy and hydrotherapy; and, manipulative physical therapies such as osteopathy and chiropractic massage. Non-conventional medicine might define health in terms of concepts of balance and harmony or espouse vitalistic doctrines of the body. Illness could be understood as due to the accretion of bodily toxins and impurities, to result from magical, spiritual, or supernatural causes, or as arising from energy blockages in the body such that healing actions might constitute energy transfer from practitioner to patient.|$|R
