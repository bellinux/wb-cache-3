40|$|Introduction The NA 48 {{experiment}} has {{originally been}} designed to precisely measure direct CP violation in the decay of <b>neutral</b> <b>kaons</b> to two pions. It is a typical fixed target experiment: <b>Neutral</b> <b>kaons</b> and hyperons are produced by protons interacting with two targets and decay in a roughly 100 m long decay region (Fig. 1). One target (far target) is located 126 m before the begin of the decay region, a distance large enough that all K S mesons and neutral hyperons have decayed before reaching the final collimator. The other target (near target) is located only 6 m before the decay region. Decays observed from this target therefore are predominantly K S and and neutral hyperon (#, #) decays, but may also be K L decays. In both neutral beams charged particles are deflected from the beam line by sweeping magnets. During the CP violation measurement, both targets were used simultaneously, producing two almost collinear beams of <b>neutral</b> <b>kaons.</b> Apart from the CP violation measurement, s...|$|R

50|$|The kind of CP {{violation}} {{discovered in}} 1964 {{was linked to}} the fact that <b>neutral</b> <b>kaons</b> can transform into their antiparticles (in which each quark is replaced with the other's antiquark) and vice versa, but such transformation does not occur with exactly the same probability in both directions; this is called indirect CP violation.Despite many searches, no other manifestation of CP violation was discovered until the 1990s, when the NA31 experiment at CERN suggested evidence for CP violation in the decay process of the very same <b>neutral</b> <b>kaons</b> (direct CP violation). The observation was somewhat controversial, and final proof for it came in 1999 from the KTeV experiment at Fermilab and the NA48 experiment at CERN.|$|R
50|$|After the {{striking}} evidence for parity violation provided by Wu et al. in 1957, {{it was assumed}} that CP (charge conjugation-parity) is the quantity which is conserved.
