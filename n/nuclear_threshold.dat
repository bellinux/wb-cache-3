5000|$|Israel is {{believed}} to have begun full-scale production of nuclear weapons following the 1967 Six-Day War, although it had built its first operational nuclear weapon by December 1966. A CIA report from early 1967 stated that Israel had the materials to construct a bomb in six to eight weeks and some authors suggest that Israel had two crude bombs ready for use during the war. According to US journalist Seymour Hersh, everything was ready for production at this time save an official order to do so. Israel crossed the <b>nuclear</b> <b>threshold</b> {{on the eve of the}} Six Day War in May 1967. “Minister Levi Eshkol, according to a number of Israeli sources, secretly ordered the Dimona reactor scientists to assemble two crude nuclear devices.

40|$|The major {{technical}} {{obstacle to the}} signing of nuclear test ban treaties {{is the issue of}} verifying compliance. Since the banning of atmospheric and oceanic testing (Limited Test Ban Treaty of 1963) pushed testing underground, seismic monitoring {{has been one of the}} most important technologies available for monitoring compliance with test ban treaties. The goal of these treaties is to progressively reduce the al-lowed yield of <b>nuclear</b> tests (<b>Threshold</b> Test Ban Treaty) and, possibly, eliminate testing completely (Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty). In-creasing the sensitivity of the seismic monitoring requires processing rapidly increasing volumes of naturally occurring background seismici-ty (earthquakes, mine blasts, and so on) that must be discriminated from nuclear tests. Scientists in the nuclear monitoring community re-alized that the key to improving the implied search was to bring to bear the rich body of knowledge used by human seismic analysts.

40|$|The {{authors have}} {{examined}} the experimental and analytic bases for understanding the performance {{of each of the}} weapon types that are currently planned to remain in the US enduring nuclear stockpile.

The starting point for this examination was a detailed review of past experience in developing and testing modern nuclear weapons, their certification and recertification processes, their performance margins, and evidence of aging or other trends over time for each weapon type in the enduring stockpile. The findings, as summarized in Conclusions 1 through 6, are consistent with US agreement to enter into a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) of unending duration, that includes a standard ``supreme national interest`` clause. Recognizing that the challenge of maintaining an effective nuclear stockpile for an indefinite period without benefit of underground tests is an important and also a new one, the US should affirm its readiness to invoke the supreme national interest clause should the need arise as a result of unanticipated technical problems in the enduring stockpile...|$|R
