5|$|By 1954, traffic {{entering}} {{the city by}} the Causeway had doubled, leading to renewed calls for a new bridge further west at The <b>Narrows.</b> That bridge was eventually built as the <b>Narrows</b> Bridge. Opened in 1959, the <b>Narrows</b> Bridge alleviated the traffic problems at the Causeway; the <b>Narrows</b> and the Causeway continued {{to be the only}} road crossings of the Swan River between Fremantle and Maylands until the Windan Bridge of the Graham Farmer Freeway opened in 2000. The opening of the latter eastern bypass coincided with the conversion of the Causeway's two centre lanes to bus lanes. It also lowered traffic levels on the Causeway from 107,000 cars per day to 70,000 within six months. The western roundabout, the state's worst black spot since 1989, was also remodelled in 2000 into a traffic light controlled raindrop roundabout, in conjunction with the other works on the Causeway.|$|E
5|$|Seven trails with round-trip {{times of}} {{half an hour}} (Weeping Rock) to 4 hours (Angels Landing) are found in Zion Canyon. Two popular trails, Taylor Creek (4 hours round trip) and Kolob Arch (8 hours round trip), are in the Kolob Canyons section of the park, near Cedar City. Hiking up into The <b>Narrows</b> from the Temple of Sinawava is popular in summer. However, hiking beyond Big Springs {{requires}} a permit. The entire <b>Narrows</b> from Chamberlain's Ranch is a 16-mile one way trip that typically takes 12 hours of strenuous hiking. A shorter alternative is to enter the <b>Narrows</b> via Orderville Canyon. Both Orderville and the full <b>Narrows</b> require a back country permit. Entrance to the Parunuweap Canyon section of the park downstream of Labyrinth Falls is prohibited. Other often-used backcountry trails include the West Rim and LaVerkin Creek. The more primitive sections of Zion include the Kolob Terrace and the Kolob Canyons.|$|E

40|$|<b>Narrowing</b> is a {{universal}} unification procedure for equational theories defined by a canonical term rewriting system. In its original form it is extremely inefficient. Therefore, many optimizations have been proposed during the last years. In this paper, we present the <b>narrowing</b> strategies for arbitrary canonical systems in a uniform framework and introduce the new <b>narrowing</b> strategy LSE <b>narrowing.</b> LSE <b>narrowing</b> is complete and improves all other strategies which are complete for arbitrary canonical systems.

5|$|Detailed {{design on}} {{the first stage of}} the freeway, from the <b>Narrows</b> Bridge to Sutherland Street at the {{northern}} edge of the city, began in 1960, and took several years to be completed. The design included a complex interchange at the <b>Narrows</b> Bridge that was to be built on reclaimed land that was mostly soft mud. Ground improvement works, which included the installations of 43,000 sand drains, began in 1964; demolition of buildings in the freeway's path commenced in 1965. The freeway was completed in three sections, under three separate contracts. Construction on the central section from Mount Street to Wellington Street started on 18 November 1966, following a groundbreaking ceremony conducted by Premier David Brand. It was opened to traffic two years later, connected to the <b>Narrows</b> Bridge via a temporary Bailey Bridge over Mounts Bay Road. The new road carried up to 1400 vehicles per hour during peak hours.|$|E

5|$|Multiple realignments of {{the road}} that is now Alt US40 have {{occurred}} since it was originally built as the National Road. Most such realignments are minor, such as to bypass an old bridge, but some have significantly affected the path {{of the road}}. One such realignment occurred in 1834, when a new route for the National Road was built through the Cumberland <b>Narrows.</b> The previous route had followed the Braddock Road, a route which is now followed by MD49. The route following Braddock Road passed over Haystack Mountain and was much steeper than the newer route through the <b>Narrows.</b> The route through the <b>Narrows</b> allowed the road to bypass this steep mountain ascent. The stone arch bridge built across Will's Creek for the new alignment remained in service until 1932, when a new bridge which is the present bridge across Will's Creek replaced it. The old bridge was torn down during the construction of the Will's Creek flood control system in the 1950s.|$|E

40|$|<b>Narrowing</b> is {{a method}} for solving {{equations}} in the equational theories of term rewriting systems. Unification and rewriting, the central operations in <b>narrowing,</b> are often implemented on graph-like data structures to exploit sharing of common subexpressions. In this paper, we study the completeness of <b>narrowing</b> in graph-based implementations. We show that the well-known condition for the completeness of tree-based <b>narrowing,</b> viz. a normalizing and confluent term rewrite relation, does not suffice. Completeness is restored, however, if the implementing graph rewrite relation is normalizing and confluent. We address basic <b>narrowing</b> and show its completeness for innermost normalizing and confluent graph rewriting. Then we consider the combination of basic <b>narrowing</b> with two strategies for controlling sharing, obtaining minimally collapsing and maximally collapsing basic <b>narrowing.</b> The former is shown to be complete {{in the presence of}} innermost normalization and confluence, the latter in the presence of termination and confluence. Maximally collapsing <b>narrowing</b> sometimes speeds up <b>narrowing</b> derivations drastically.
