5|$|By 1860, Smith {{was doing}} very well; {{he had moved}} to Leonard Street within the Fifth Ward and had a mansion built by white workmen. His total real {{property}} was worth $25,000. His household included a live-in servant, Catherine Grelis from Ireland. Listed as a separate household at his address were Sara D. Williams, 57, and Mary Hertell (should be Hewlitt, as above), 50. (These were likely the same Sara and Mary as in the 1850 census, although their ages did not change.) <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>on</b> this census page had a racial designation. By the conventions of the time, this means that they were classified as white by the census enumerator; totals of white persons only are given {{at the bottom of}} the page.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Stafford and Cernan, still {{circling}} in {{the clouds}} in the second T-38, {{had no idea what}} had happened to their flight partners. Air traffic controllers were confused by the two planes in flight attempting different abort actions after the initial missed approach, and moreover <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>on</b> the ground knew who was in the crashed plane. After some delay, Stafford and Cernan were asked to identify themselves and given permission to land, but they were not informed of the crash until on the ground. Although personally distraught over the loss of his close colleagues and friends, Stafford acted as NASA's chief contact on the scene until other personnel arrived to relieve him later in the day.|$|E
5|$|Offshore, a 30,000ton freighter, the MV Korean Star, {{sustained}} extreme damage {{during the}} storm.

Although the freighter was in two pieces, the ship did not sink and the wreckage of it came ashore near Cape Cuvier. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>on</b> the ship sustained injury as all 19 crew members abandoned ship. The crew was rescued within a day of sustaining the damage and flown to Carnarvon.|$|E

5|$|United Airlines Flight 93 was a {{domestic}} scheduled passenger flight that was hijacked by four Al-Qaeda terrorists on board, {{as part of}} the September 11 attacks. It crashed into a field in Somerset County, Pennsylvania, during an attempt by the passengers and crew to regain control. All 44 people aboard were killed, including the four hijackers, but <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>on</b> the ground was injured.

5|$|Flight 1 {{crashed into}} Pumpkin Patch Channel, Jamaica Bay, at 10:08:49, while angled at 78 degrees {{and on a}} {{magnetic}} heading of 300 degrees. Passengers aboard a Mohawk Airlines plane bound for Albany that took off immediately after Flight 1 watched the plane plunge into the bay. The jet exploded upon impact, a geyser of brackish water and black smoke erupted from the site, and the scattered debris and fuel caught fire. Long Island residents described hearing explosions which shook the foundations of nearby houses, though <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>on</b> the ground {{is known to have}} witnessed the plane hitting the swamp. However, a few men at Naval Air Station New York / Floyd Bennett Field saw the massive geyser of water rising above the hangars, and one guard—at his post on a bridge that the plane flew over—saw the plane roll over.|$|E

25|$|In 1999, in {{response}} to a fall in profits, there were calls from some Partners for the business to be floated on the stockmarket.

A fatal accident inquiry into the accident later found that the aircraft developed an engine malfunction during take off. Although the captain decided to return to the airfield, he mistakenly identified the working engine as the faulty one and shut it down, causing the aircraft to crash.|$|E

25|$|Prior to the Colonist leaving, Sydney Weaver had endeavoured {{to induce}} {{a friend of}} his to visit an island with him. Weaver related an {{extraordinary}} tale of hidden wealth on the island which was known only to him.

25|$|The Nationals took {{an early}} lead when right fielder Bryce Harper hit a solo home run off Atlanta {{starting}} pitcher Julio Teherán {{in the top}} of the first inning, but the Braves quickly answered with a solo home run of their own off the bat of first baseman Freddie Freeman in the bottom of the first. In the fourth inning, Nationals second baseman Daniel Murphy led off with another home run off Teheran, but once again, the Braves came back in the bottom of the same inning as third baseman Adonis Garcia homered off Scherzer with <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>on</b> base, tying the game at 2–2.|$|E
25|$|Wessely {{influenced}} {{his contemporaries}} in various directions. As a scholar he contributed, by his profound philological researches, to {{the reconstruction of}} the language of the Bible, though his work is marred by prolixity and by his refusal to admit shades of meaning in synonyms. As a poet he possessed perfection of style, but lacked feeling and artistic imagination. No one exerted a greater influence than he on the dissemination of modern Hebrew, and <b>no</b> <b>one,</b> <b>on</b> the other hand, did more to retard the development of pure art and of poetic intuition. Because of his energetic commitment to the cause of Jewish emancipation, Wessely may be regarded as a leader of the Maskilim.|$|E

25|$|The Angels {{returned}} the favor in Game 3 with a walk-off win of their own. Vladimir Guerrero hit a huge game tying two-run homer off Andy Pettitte with two {{out in the}} bottom of the 6th, and Jeff Mathis laced a game-winning RBI double {{in the bottom of}} the 11th to win the game for the Angels, 5-4. This came after a controversial decision from manager Joe Girardi to lift David Robertson for Alfredo Aceves with two out and <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>on</b> in the 11th. Aceves served up a single to Howie Kendrick, followed by the Mathis double. Four solo home runs accounted for the Yankees' scoring, hit by Derek Jeter, Rodriguez, Johnny Damon and Jorge Posada.|$|E
25|$|Doro is the story’s antagonist. He too is a mutant, born in Egypt {{during the}} reign of the Pharaohs. As he {{approaches}} puberty, Doro learns quite accidentally that he is a “body snatcher,” meaning that his life extended by killing the nearest person to him and subsuming his/her physical body. His immortality, therefore, is fueled by cruelty, and a desire for power and control. Long ago he became singularly fixated on breeding superhumans to form a psionic society that will provide him with the human bodies he needs, as well as sexual partners. Doro’s qualities are god-like, inducing members of his society to simultaneously fear and revere him. However, there is <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>on</b> earth that can satisfy his need for companionship, until he meets Anyanwu.|$|E
25|$|The {{weather is}} {{reported}} every half-hour during the program's first three hours, though since Al Roker {{took over as}} weather reporter, an interview is conducted by him {{in place of the}} national weather forecast at least once during the show, leaving only the local weather inserts by NBC stations. Today weather reporters have included Bob Ryan (1978–1980); Willard Scott (1980–1996); and Al Roker (1996–present). Until Ryan's hiring, <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>on</b> the show had practical experience or academic credentials in meteorology. Since NBC's purchase of The Weather Channel in 2008, personnel from that network frequently participate in Today forecast segments, at the site of a weather event or from the cable channel's suburban Atlanta headquarters, or as a fill-in for Roker.|$|E

All were scrapped by 1935, bringing an end to the career of the Barbarossa class.|$|E
25|$|In 2014, on April 14, a {{southbound}} Rail Runner train {{struck and}} killed a 67-year-old woman in southern Albuquerque, {{just south of the}} Bernalillo County/International Sunport station. Passengers on the train were taken to their destinations by bus. Six days later, a 60-year-old cyclist was killed by a southbound train in Santa Fe. Santa Fe Trails, the local transit agency in Santa Fe, provided bus service to all stations south for stranded passengers. Although the Santa Fe area is a quiet zone, witnesses reported that the train was sounding its horn prior to the crossing. On October 10, A Rail Runner train struck a vehicle that was attempting to go around the crossing gates, killing two people. The train had departed the Bernalillo County/Int'l Sunport station and was heading south. <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>on</b> board the train was harmed.|$|E

Damon then stole second base, and with the infield overshift on with Teixeira batting, Damon alertly stole an unoccupied third base. After Teixeira was hit by a pitch, Alex Rodriguez lined a double down the left field line to give the Yankees a 5-4 lead. Jorge Posada added two {{insurance}} runs thereafter, and Mariano Rivera pitched a perfect 9th to put the Yankees one win away from winning the series.|$|E
