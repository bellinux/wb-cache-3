5|$|Welfare was expanded, as {{characterized}} {{by the introduction of}} <b>non-contributory</b> old-age pensions and payments to mothers provided their babies are taken for health checks and that their children attend school. Hundreds of free tractors were also handed out. The prices of gas and many foodstuffs were controlled, and local food producers were made to sell in the local market rather than export. A new state-owned body was also set up to distribute food at subsidized prices. All these measures helped to curb inflation, while the economy grew (partly because of rising public spending), accompanied by stronger public finances which brought economic stability.|$|E
25|$|Families who {{received}} this benefit were exempted from NHS charges while {{the children in}} such families were eligible for free school meals. <b>Non-contributory</b> pensions were also introduced for all persons aged eighty and above, while the Social Security Act 1973 was passed which introduced benefit indexation in the United Kingdom {{for the first time}} by index-linking benefits to prices to maintain their real value.|$|E
25|$|In May 1997, Frank Field {{was made}} Minister for Welfare Reform. He {{approved}} {{of the principle of}} self-help through mutual organisations such as friendly societies, he thought the state should have only a small role to play in the provision of welfare, and he disliked means-testing and <b>non-contributory</b> entitlement. These ideas were out of step with those of the new Chancellor, Gordon Brown, in particular, and Field's ministerial tenure was short-lived.|$|E
25|$|In 1974, after Harold Wilson's {{defeat of}} Edward Heath, Castle became Secretary of State for Health and Social Services. While serving in this position, Castle {{introduced}} {{a wide range}} of innovative welfare reforms, including the introduction of the mobility allowance, the Invalid Care Allowance (July 1976) for single women and others who give up their jobs to care for severely disabled relatives, the introduction of a <b>non-contributory</b> invalidity pension for disabled persons who had not qualified for invalidity pension, reforms in child allowances, and the linking of most social security benefits to earnings rather than prices.|$|E
25|$|On 6 January 2010, Wall gave {{evidence}} to the Iraq Inquiry in which he claimed that troops were vulnerable in their base at Basra Palace and in May 2010, Wall was listed amongst the top 172 government servants that earn more than the Prime Minister, with a salary of £160–165,000, excluding his <b>non-contributory</b> final salary pension. Then on 29 July 2010, Wall was named as the next Chief of the General Staff, the professional head of the British Army. On 15 September 2010 Wall took over the post from General Sir David Richards who became Chief of the Defence Staff in late October 2010.|$|E
500|$|Article 9 of the Covenant recognizes [...] "the {{right of}} {{everyone}} to social security, including social insurance". It requires parties {{to provide some}} form of social insurance scheme to protect people against the risks of sickness, disability, maternity, employment injury, unemployment or old age; to provide for survivors, orphans, and those who cannot afford health care; {{and to ensure that}} families are adequately supported. Benefits from such a scheme must be adequate, accessible to all, and provided without discrimination. The Covenant does not restrict the form of the scheme, and both contributory and <b>non-contributory</b> schemes are permissible (as are community-based and mutual schemes).|$|E

2500|$|Asquith had as {{chancellor}} placed money {{aside for}} the provision of <b>non-contributory</b> old-age pensions; the bill authorising them passed in 1908, during his premiership, despite some objection in the Lords. Jenkins noted that the scheme (which provided five shillings a week to single pensioners aged seventy and over, and slightly less than twice that to married couples) [...] "to modern ears sounds cautious and meagre. But it was violently criticised at the time for showing a reckless generosity." ...|$|E
2500|$|All workers paying FICA (Federal Insurance Contributions Act) and SECA (Self Employed Contributions Act) {{taxes for}} forty {{quarters}} of credit (QC) {{or more on}} a specified minimum income or more are [...] "fully insured" [...] and eligible to retire at age 62 with reduced benefits and higher benefits at full retirement ages, FRA, of 65, 66 or 67 depending on birth date. Retirement benefits depend upon the [...] "adjusted" [...] average wage earned in the last 35 years. Wages of earlier years are [...] "adjusted" [...] before averaging by multiplying each annual salary by an annual adjusted wage index factor, AWI, for earlier salaries. Adjusted wages for 35 years are always used to compute the 35 year [...] "average" [...] indexed monthly salary. Only wages lower than the [...] "ceiling" [...] income are considered in calculating the adjusted average wage. If the worker has fewer than 35 years of covered earnings these <b>non-contributory</b> years are assigned zero earnings. If {{there are more than}} 35 years of covered earnings only the highest 35 are considered. The sum of the 35 adjusted salaries (or less if worker has less than 35 years of covered income) times its inflation index, AWI divided by 420 (35 yrs x 12 months/yr) gives the 35 year covered Average Indexed Monthly salary, AIME.|$|E
60|$|Well now, it is {{said that}} in {{adopting}} the policy of contributory insurance the Government have admitted that they were wrong in establishing old-age pensions upon the <b>non-contributory</b> basis. Now I do not think that is true. There is no inconsistency or contradiction between a <b>non-contributory</b> system of old-age pensions and a contributory system of insurance against unemployment, sickness, invalidity, and widowhood. The circumstances and conditions are entirely different. The prospect of attaining extreme old age, of living beyond threescore years and ten, which is the allotted span of human life, seems so doubtful and remote to the ordinary man, when in the full strength of manhood, that it has been found in practice almost impossible to secure from any very great number of people the regular sacrifices which are necessary to guard against old age.|$|E
60|$|I agree most whole-heartedly {{with those}} who say that in {{attempting}} to relieve distress or to regulate the general levels of employment, we must be most careful not to facilitate the very disorganisation of industry which causes distress. But I do not agree {{with those who}} say that every man must look after himself, and that the intervention by the State in such matters as I have referred to will be fatal to his self-reliance, his foresight, and his thrift. We are told that our <b>non-contributory</b> scheme of old-age pensions, for instance, will be fatal to thrift, and we are warned that the great mass of the working classes will be discouraged thereby from making any effective provision for their old age. But what effective provision have they made against old age in the past? If terror be an incentive to thrift, surely the penalties of the system which we have abandoned ought to have stimulated thrift as much as anything could have been stimulated in this world. The mass of the labouring poor have known that unless they made provision for their old age betimes they would perish miserably in the workhouse. Yet they have made no provision; and when I am told that the institution of old-age pensions will prevent the working classes from making provision for their old age, I say that cannot be, for they {{have never been able to}} make such provision. And I believe our scheme, so far from preventing thrift, will encourage it to an extent never before known.|$|E
50|$|<b>Non-contributory</b> means-tested {{pensions}} {{are targeted}} at low-income households and the disabled.
