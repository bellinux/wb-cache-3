5|$|The Kennet and Avon Canal is a {{waterway}} {{in southern}} England {{with an overall}} length of , made up of two lengths of <b>navigable</b> <b>river</b> linked by a canal. The name is commonly {{used to refer to}} {{the entire length of the}} navigation rather than solely to the central canal section. From Bristol to Bath the waterway follows the natural course of the River Avon before the canal links it to the River Kennet at Newbury, and from there to Reading on the River Thames. In all, the waterway incorporates 105 locks.|$|E
5|$|The River Hull is a <b>navigable</b> <b>river</b> in the East Riding of Yorkshire in Northern England. It {{rises from}} a series of springs to the west of Driffield, and enters the Humber estuary at Kingston upon Hull. Following a period when the Archbishops of York charged tolls for its use, it became a free navigation. The upper reaches became part of the Driffield Navigation from 1770, after which they were again subject to tolls, and the section within the city of Hull came under the {{jurisdiction}} of the Port of Hull, with the same result.|$|E
5|$|The River Severn is {{considered}} a <b>navigable</b> <b>river</b> and Gloucester {{used to be an}} important port, with shipping having to deal with the bore. Vessels can ride the tide up from Sharpness to Gloucester. The tide will outstrip the vessel but by timing the journey correctly, a barge can reach Gloucester at high water. Descending is more difficult, and barges often needed to start their descent with one tide, lay up before crossing Longney Sands, and finish the descent at the next tide. These inconveniences in accessing Gloucester were overcome when the Gloucester and Sharpness Canal was opened in 1827, bypassing the need for shipping to use the river to reach Gloucester.|$|E

5|$|The Sava River {{valley is}} also a route for road and rail traffic. The river valley routes {{are a part of}} the Pan-European Corridor X, and forming {{junctions}} with Pan-European Corridors V, Vb, Vc, Xa and Xb in area of Ljubljana (V), Zagreb (Vb, Xa), Slavonski Šamac (Vc), and Belgrade (Xb). The motorways forming the Pan-European Corridor X in the area—Slovenia's A2, Croatia's A3 and Serbia's A1 motorways—represent a part of European route E70 Bordeaux–Turin–Ljubljana–Zagreb–Belgrade–Bucharest, and the European route E61 Villach–Ljubljana–Trieste–Rijeka. A largely double track railroad with a railway electrification system {{is also a}} part of the Corridor X. The railroad was a part of the Simplon-Orient-Express and Direct-Orient-Express routes. The <b>navigable</b> <b>river</b> course between Belgrade and Galdovo north of Sisak is spanned by 25bridges. The Sava River valley east of Sisak is also used as a route for the Jadranski naftovod, a crude oil pipeline. The system connects the Port of Rijeka oil terminal to oil refineries in Rijeka and Sisak, to Brod in Bosnia-Herzegovina, as well as Novi Sad and Pančevo in Serbia.|$|E
5|$|There are a {{total of}} 105 locks on the Kennet and Avon Canal from Bristol to the River Thames, {{including}} 6 on the navigable section of the River Avon from Bristol to Bath and 9 on the navigable section of the River Kennet to its confluence with the Thames near Reading. The remaining 90 locks lie along the 57miles (92km) of canal. In Bath the canal separates from the river but follows its valley as far as Bradford on Avon. The ornate Bath Locks lead to a stretch through Limpley Stoke valley with few locks. The flight of locks at Devizes, including the Caen Hill Locks, raises the canal to its longest pound, which then ascends the 4 Wooton Rivers locks to the short summit pound which includes the Bruce Tunnel. Pumping stations are used to supply the canal with water. The canal continues through the rural landscape of Wiltshire and Berkshire before joining the River Kennet at Newbury and becoming a <b>navigable</b> <b>river</b> to Reading, where it flows into the River Thames.|$|E

25|$|Just {{north-east}} of {{the midpoint}} of Surrey and at a junction of ancient north–south and east–west roads, elements of the town have been a focus for transport throughout its history.

25|$|The Thames Tunnel is an {{underwater}} tunnel, built beneath the River Thames in London, connecting Rotherhithe and Wapping.

It was the first tunnel known to have been constructed successfully underneath a <b>navigable</b> <b>river</b> and was built between 1825 and 1843 using Marc Isambard Brunel's and Thomas Cochrane's newly invented tunnelling shield technology, by Brunel and his son Isambard Kingdom Brunel.|$|E

25|$|A {{plan for}} the New Zealand Company's new {{settlement}} of Britannia at Pito-one (Petone) had been prepared in England by Samuel Cobham.
