During the Panorama exposé, Brennan—the highest-level African-American in the history of world football governance—joined Jennings, Trinidadian journalist Lisana Liburd and many others in exposing allegedly inappropriate allocations of money at CONCACAF, and drew connections between ostensible CONCACAF criminality and similar behaviors at FIFA. Since then, and in the light of fresh allegations of bribery and corruption and opaque action by FIFA in late 2010, both Jennings and Brennan remain highly critical of FIFA, with Brennan calling directly for an alternative to FIFA to be considered by the stakeholders of the sport throughout the world.|$|E

50|$|In theory, {{misfeasance}} {{is distinct}} from <b>nonfeasance.</b> <b>Nonfeasance</b> is a failure to act that results in harm to another party. Misfeasance, by contrast, is some affirmative act that, though legal, causes harm. In practice, the distinction is confusing and uninstructive. Courts often have difficulty determining whether harm resulted from a failure to act or from an act that was improperly performed.|$|E

50|$|Misfeasance, <b>nonfeasance,</b> and {{malfeasance}} are {{types of}} failure to discharge public obligations existing by common law, custom, or statute.|$|E
50|$|At {{present the}} terms {{misfeasance}} and <b>nonfeasance</b> {{are most often}} used {{with reference to the}} conduct of municipal authorities with reference to the discharge of their statutory obligations; and it is an established rule that an action lies in favour of persons injured by misfeasance, i.e. by negligence in discharge of the duty; but {{that in the case of}} <b>nonfeasance</b> the remedy is not by action but by indictment or mandamus or by the particular procedure prescribed by the statutes.|$|E

50|$|In {{order to}} bring assumpsit, the {{plaintiff}} would plead that, the defendant being indebted to the plaintiff, the defendant had later promised to pay the debt.

50|$|To {{bring the}} claim within {{trespass}} on the case, the plaintiff would characterise the defendant's {{breach of agreement}} as a wrong.

50|$|Jean-Claude Duvalier {{left behind}} a hastily {{constructed}} interim junta, controlled by the armed forces. Lieutenant General Henri Namphy, army chief of staff, became head of the interim National Council of Government (Conseil Nationale de Gouvernement—CNG). Colonel Williams Regala, {{the head of the}} Military Academy; Lieutenant General Prosper Avril of the Presidential Guard; and Colonel Jean-Claude Paul of the regular army were also key figures in the interim government. The CNG officially disbanded the VSN a few days after Duvalier's departure, but it avoided the politically difficult measure of effectively halting the VSN's activities. This <b>nonfeasance</b> prompted angry mobs to murder known members of the VSN and set in motion a cycle of instability from which Haiti had yet to recover in the late 1980s. Despite the popular backlash, some members of the VSN managed to survive by integrating themselves into military circles.|$|E

5000|$|The village {{officials}} did not contest these allegations, but instead challenged the dissolution statute as contrary to the home rule provisions of the Ohio Constitution.

[...] "When the electorate allows key offices to go vacant for unreasonable amounts of time and allows other conditions ... to cause ruin and decay," [...] Cain wrote, [...] "it can easily be inferred that this small group of local citizens has abandoned any right it had to operate a local government unit.

[...] Judge Cain granted the order to formally dissolve New Rome on August 9, 2004, and also ordered the clearing of all unpaid traffic tickets and all drivers licenses suspended by the village. No appeal was filed by the September 9 deadline, and on that date New Rome was irrevocably absorbed into Prairie Township.|$|E
40|$|The Delaware General Corporation Law was amended in 1986 {{to permit}} shareholder-approved exculpatory charter {{provisions}} shielding corporate directors from monetary liability for certain fiduciary duty breaches not including (among other things) breaches of {{the duty of}} loyalty and acts not in good faith. This article examines the development of corporate fiduciary duty doctrine in Delaware leading up to and following this statutory amendment, focusing particularly on the Delaware courts 2 ̆ 7 evolving conception of the meaning anddoctrinal status of the good faith concept employed in recent cases to permit a non-exculpable cause ofaction for conscious <b>nonfeasance.</b> The article argues that Delaware 2 ̆ 7 s good faith case law and statutory exculpation regime rendered the fiduciary duty framework internally contradictory and practically unworkable. A remedy is proposed {{in the form of}} a statutory amendment replacing the exculpation regime with a provision permitting the imposition of monetary liability only for loyalty breaches, defined broadly to reach cases of conscious <b>nonfeasance</b> recently styled by the courts as evidencing a lack of good faith. In so doing, the article argues that good faith should be treated as a component of the fiduciary duty of loyalty, and advocates a doctrinal framework substantially similar to that adopted by the Delaware Supreme Court in its Stone v.

40|$|Abstract Scholars of {{administrative}} ethics {{have recently been}} attentive {{to the problem of}} so-called administrative evil. The authors argue that evil can be understood as a socially constructed category of agents and acts specific to particular circumstances and moral communities, and the authors apply a framework of accountability to reflect the dynamics of that constructed reality. Selected examples of efforts to hold evil actors accountable or otherwise to account for evil acts illustrate a paradox: Responses to so-called evil may themselves be labeled evil in hindsight or by members of other contemporaneous communities. In light of this paradox and attendant ethical dilemmas, the authors argue that conventional ethical and behavioral prescriptions are necessary but insufficient protections against catastrophic mis-, mal-, or <b>nonfeasance</b> in and by organizations...|$|E
40|$|The child sex molestation scandal at Penn State University {{illustrates}} {{mass media}} entertainment logic promoting scan-dal, suffering and retribution, {{on the one}} hand, {{as well as the}} cultural logic of big time university athletic factories, on the other hand.

40|$|Negative and {{positive}} externalities pose symmetrical problems to social welfare. The law internalizes negative externalities by providing general tort liability rules. According to such rules, those who cause harm to others should pay compensation. In theory, {{in the presence}} of positive externalities, negative liability should apply: those who produce benefits should be paid a compensatory award by the gainers. Nevertheless, the legal system does not display such general negative-liability rules. Rather, it tackles the problem of internalizing positive externalities by implementing a set of different and often indirect solutions. My explanation for this asymmetry in legal remedies rests on three features of a negative-liability regime, relating to intent, incentives, and evidence. These features explain the scope and design of restitution rules, liability for <b>nonfeasance,</b> and other mechanisms for the internalization of positive externalities.

40|$|Political murder has, alas, {{never gone}} out of vogue. Is its condemnation, too, in retreat?

40|$|Huan Jie Zheng, Shu Kun Ouyang, Yue Zhao, Kai Lu, Su Xin Luo, Hua Xiao Department of Cardiology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing, People’s Republic of China Background: Oral {{anticoagulants}} (OACs) {{are effective}} for the prophylaxis of stroke {{in patients with}} atrial fibrillation (AF). This cross-sectional study aimed to investigate the status of anticoagulation treatment for hospitalized AF patients in Southwest China. Methods: A total of 4760 hospitalized patients with AF were enrolled from 21 hospitals in Chongqing city from January 1 to December 31, 2013. Results: Among the enrolled patients, 3785 were diagnosed with nonvalvular AF. These patients had {{a mean age of}} 74. 4 ± 10. 1 years. The mean CHADS 2 score of all subjects was 2. 60 ± 1. 34, and 80. 7 % of the patients had CHADS 2 ≥ 2. The use rate of OACs was only 11. 5 % for patients with a high risk for stroke (CHADS 2 ≥ 2) and was much lower in patients from the second-level hospitals than in patients from the third-level hospitals (5. 8 % vs. 16. 9 %, P< 0. 001). The leading reason for the underuse of OACs in high-risk patients was physician’s <b>nonfeasance.</b> Conclusion: This study demonstrated that the underuse of anticoagulation therapy in hospitalized patients with nonvalvular AF was particularly serious in Southwest China, especially in the second-level hospitals. Urgent and effective measures are desperately needed to improve this alarming situation in China.

40|$|An {{introductory}} {{assertion that}} neither the Caddo nor the Wichita had to endure a particularly traumatic relocation experience will startle any reader who has an inkling {{of the history of}} those tribes. Ultimately, it must perplex anyone who perseveres through the ensuing chronicle of repeated dispossession and decimation {{under the aegis of the}} governments of Texas and the United States. The first chapter presents further dubious analysis, sometimes irrelevant to the sources cited, in a quixotic attempt to trace both tribes from the 2 ̆ 71540 s to 1846 in sixteen pages. Happily, the author hits his stride in chapter two, thenceforth relying largely on documentary sources to construct a useful chronology of complex events that have been too long untold in readily accessible studies [...] While the declared focus is Caddo and Wichita relations with the United States government, Smith pays proper attention to their 1859 ouster from their small Texas Reserve by murderous Anglo Texan gangs against whom the United States could not and the government of Texas would not protect them. Also well explained is their succeeding exodus to Kansas to escape the turmoil of the Civil War, only to suffer an even worse ordeal of disease and starvation. Subsequently striving to rebuild their lives on their newly assigned Washita River reservation just west of the 98 th meridian, in socalled Indian Terri tory, the Caddo and Wichita endured endless malfeasance, misfeasance, and <b>nonfeasance</b> by US authorities at whose mercy, necessarily, they existed.
