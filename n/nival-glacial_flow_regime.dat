The inner and outer diameters of the annulus are 19. 1 mm and 38. 1 mm, respectively. The equivalent hydraulic diameter of the flow channel, DH, is 19. 0 mm and the total length is 4. 37 m. The <b>flow</b> <b>regime</b> map includes 1080 local <b>flow</b> <b>regimes</b> identifications in 72 flow conditions within a range of 0. 01 m/s < 〈jg〉 < 30 m/s and 0. 2 m/s < 〈jf〉 < 3. 5 m/s where 〈jg〉 and 〈jf〉 are, respectively, superficial gas and liquid velocities. The local <b>flow</b> <b>regime</b> has been classified into four categories: bubbly, cap–slug, churn-turbulent and annular flows. In order to study the radial and axial development of <b>flow</b> <b>regime</b> the measurements have been performed at five radial locations.

40|$|In {{modeling}} gas-liquid two-phase flows, {{the concept}} of <b>flow</b> <b>regime</b> {{has been used to}} characterize the global interfacial structure of the flows. Nearly all constitutive relations that provide closures to the interfacial transfers in two-phase flow models, such as the two-fluid model, are often <b>flow</b> <b>regime</b> dependent. Currently, the determination of the <b>flow</b> <b>regimes</b> is primarily based on <b>flow</b> <b>regime</b> maps or transition criteria, which are developed for steady-state, fully-developed flows and widely applied in nuclear reactor system safety analysis codes, such as RELAP 5. As two-phase flows are observed to be dynamic in nature (fully-developed two-phase flows generally do not exist in real applications), it is of importance to model the <b>flow</b> <b>regime</b> transition dynamically for more accurate predictions of two-phase flows. The present work aims to develop a dynamic modeling strategy for determining <b>flow</b> <b>regimes</b> in gas-liquid two-phase flows through the introduction of interfacial area transport equations (IATEs) within the framework of a two-fluid model. The IATE is a transport equation that models the interfacial area concentration by considering the creation and destruction of the interfacial area, such as the fluid particle (bubble or liquid droplet) disintegration, boiling and evaporation; and fluid particle coalescence and condensation, respectively. For the <b>flow</b> <b>regimes</b> beyond bubbly <b>flows,</b> a two-group IATE has been proposed, in which bubbles are divided into two groups based on their size and shape (which are correlated), namely small bubbles and large bubbles.

ENERGY DISSIPATION IN NAPPE <b>FLOW</b> <b>REGIME</b> In a nappe <b>flow</b> <b>regime,</b> the total head loss on the spillway ∆E equals the difference between the maximum head available Eo and the residual head at the spillway toe. For an un-gated spillway (fig. 1), the writer (CHANSON 1993) showed that it yields: ∆...|$|R
40|$|During landward migration, {{ridge and}} runnel systems are {{subjected}} to asymmetric oscillatory and/or unidirectional <b>flow</b> <b>regimes,</b> depending {{on the stage of}} development reached by these systems. In the early stages of evolution, when the ridge is situated in the upper shoreface, the whole system is subjected to asymmetric oscillatory flow. The runnel is under lower <b>flow</b> <b>regime</b> conditions and the ridge may be under upper or lower <b>flow</b> <b>regime</b> according to water depth and wave energy. Later, when the ridge has migrated to a position on the foreshore, the runnel is largely under a unidirectional lower <b>flow</b> <b>regime</b> while the ridge itself is under oscillatory upper <b>flow</b> <b>regime.</b> When the ridge welds to berm, it is largely emergent and exposed to high-tide swash action under upper <b>flow</b> <b>regime</b> conditions. The runnel is eventually filled with sand and transformed into a low-lying area. All these types grade laterally into each other. One or more ridge and runnel systems can occur at the same time. Wave energy, tide level and position of the ridge control the variations in the characteristics of the ridge and also the position of the zones of bedforms found at the upper shorefac...|$|R
