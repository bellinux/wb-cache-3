Following a survey, Tindal was selected in May 1963 as being close enough to RAAF Base Darwin to afford mutual protection, but far enough from the coast to be defensible and to avoid the effects of tropical cyclones. Other factors, such as being outside the projected <b>nuclear</b> <b>fall-out</b> zone should Darwin be targeted by a nuclear weapon, as well as an adequate water supply and suitable road and rail connections, also influenced the decision.|$|E

50|$|In 1974, on the {{formation}} of the Metropolitan Borough of Trafford, the new council adopted the town hall as its base, renaming it Trafford Town Hall. It was renovated in the early 1980s, in a schedule of work that included the addition of a 10000 m2 underground <b>nuclear</b> <b>fall-out</b> shelter; the shelter was subsequently used for storage until its closure in 2011. Trafford Town Hall was designated a Grade II listed building in 2007.|$|E
50|$|The corps {{was created}} to provide a system for detecting, {{tracking}} and reporting aircraft over Britain. During World War II it was complementary to and often replaced the radar system in that it provided an 'over land' element while radar handled the 'over water approach' requirement. In 1955 the detection and reporting of <b>nuclear</b> blasts and <b>fall-out</b> was introduced. By 1965 the aircraft role was no longer needed and the corps formed the field force for the United Kingdom Warning and Monitoring Organisation (UKWMO) until both organisations were disbanded after the Cold war ended.|$|R
40|$|The salt {{fraction}} in permafrost soils/sediments of the McMurdo Dry Valleys (MDV) of Antarctica {{can be used}} as a {{proxy for}} cold desert geochemical processes and paleoclimate reconstruction. Previous analyses of the salt fraction in MDV permafrost soils have largely been conducted in coastal regions where permafrost soils are variably affected by aqueous processes and mixed inputs from marine and stratospheric sources. We expand upon this work by evaluating permafrost soil/sediments in University Valley, located in the ultraxerous zone where both liquid water transport and marine influences are minimal. We determined the abundances of Cl(-), NO 3 (-, ClO 4 (-) and ClO 3 (-) in dry and ice-cemented soil/sediments, snow and glacier ice, and also characterized Cl(-) and NO 3 (-) isotopically. The data are not consistent with salt deposition in a sublimation till, nor with <b>nuclear</b> weapon testing <b>fall-out,</b> and instead point to a dominantly stratospheric source and to varying degrees of post depositional transformation depending on the substrate, from minimal alteration in bare soils to significant alteration (photodegradation and/or volatilization) in snow and glacier ice. Ionic abundances in the dry permafrost layer indicate limited vertical transport under the current climate conditions, likely due to percolation of snowmelt. Subtle changes in ClO 4 (-) /NO 3 (-) ratios and NO 3 (-) isotopic composition with depth and location may reflect both transport related fractionation and depositional history. Low molar ratios of ClO 3 (-) /ClO 4 (-) in surface soils compared to deposition and other arid systems suggest significant post depositional loss of ClO 3 (-), possibly due to reduction by iron minerals, which may have important implications for oxy-chlorine species on Mars. Salt accumulation varies with distance along the valley and apparent accumulation times based on multiple methods range from approximately 10 to 30 kyr near the glacier to 70 - 200 kyr near the valley mouth. The relatively young age of the salts and relatively low and homogeneous anion concentrations in the ice-cemented sediments point to either a mechanism of recent salt removal, or to relatively modern permafrost soils (less than 1 million years). Together, our results show that near surface salts in University Valley serve as an end-member of stratospheric sources not subject to biological processes or extensive remobilization...|$|R
50|$|The Couvent Rouru (Rouru Convent), {{near the}} {{southern}} end of the cemetery, is now in ruins, but housed 60 nuns at one time. There is a carving school near the cathedral at Camika CED which features mother of pearl carvings. Here training is provided in the art of shell engraving. Pendants and barrettes created here can be purchased at the centre’s sales outlet. Riktea has a large <b>nuclear</b> <b>fall-out</b> shelter which was built at the time of the French atmospheric testing at Moruroa.|$|E
50|$|From 1946, {{the focus}} was no longer just on photography, but on signals {{intelligence}} and especially on new air sampling methods to detect and analyze <b>nuclear</b> <b>fall-out.</b> The extremely close operating relationship between the RAF and the USAAF (USAF from 1947) would survive the war, and the tactics, technology, terminology and in general the shared intellectual infrastructure in aerial surveillance and analysis would transition into the Cold War, becoming embodied in the National Reconnaissance Office by 1960. By then, no other country, including the Soviet Union, had national technical means for reconnaissance remotely rivaling those the RAF-USAF founded during the war.|$|E

5000|$|Following {{his trip}} to the United States in 1965 he {{produced}} a series of drawings based on American <b>nuclear</b> <b>fall-out</b> shelters, Art Deco cinema interiors and of hot dogs, which he described as being ‘as important a 20th century development as (say) a rocket.’ His highly personal and distinctive style of drawing led the artist Richard Hamilton to call him ‘the best draughtsman in England since William Blake.’ During the 1960s Self showed with the Robert Fraser Gallery, London. As printmaker, Self {{has been a great}} innovator and was a central figure in the 1960s boom in printmaking. Drawing images from a variety of commercial sources, he created the Power and Beauty series of screenprints (1968) at Editions Alecto while his etching suite Prelude to the 1000 Temporary Objects of Our Time (1970-71) sought to provide a unique record of society in the event of its possible destruction ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{basis of}} racial {{discrimination}} and colonialism has been economic, and it is with economic weapons that these evils have been and can be overcome. In pursuance of resolutions adopted at the Addis Ababa summit conference, African states have undertaken certain measures in the economic field which, if adopted by all member states of the United Nations, would soon reduce intransigeance to reason. I ask, today, for adherence to these measures by every nation represented here which is truly devoted to the principles enunciated in the charter.We must act while we can, while the occasion exists to exert those legitimate pressures available to us lest time run out and resort be had to less happy means.The great {{nations of the world}} would do well to remember that in the modern age even their own fates are not wholly in their hands. Peace demands the united efforts of us all. Who can foresee what spark might ignite the fuse?The stake of each one of us is identical-life or death. We all wish to live. We all seek a world in which men are freed of the burdens of ignorance, poverty, hunger and disease. And we shall all be hard-pressed to escape the deadly rain of <b>nuclear</b> <b>fall-out</b> should catastrophe overtake us.The problems which confront us today are, equally, unprecedented. They have no counterparts in human experience. Men search the pages of history for solutions, for precedents, but there are none. This then, is the ultimate challenge. Where are we to look for our survival, for the answers to the questions which have never before been posed ? We must look, first, to the Almighty God, Who has raised man above the animals and endowed him with intelligence and reason. We must put our faith in Him, that He will not desert us or permit us to destroy humanity which He created in His image.And we must look into ourselves, into the depth of our souls. We must become something we have never been and for which our education and experience and environment have ill-prepared us. We must become bigger than we have been : more courageous, greater in spirit, larger in outlook. We must become members of a new race, overcoming petty prejudice, owing our ultimate allegiance not to nations but to our fellow men within the human community.|$|E
40|$|Atmospheric {{particulates}} collected around East Coast Australian {{cities and}} Port Moresby, just {{before and after}} the French Atomic Test Series of 1974 in the Pacific, have been analysed by proton activation using the Melbourne University Cyclotron. A number of elements, namely S, Ca, Ti, Cr, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn, Se and Hg, ranging in concentrations from. 001 ug/m 3 to up to 3. 27 ug/m 3 have been detected. The changes observed in the concentrations of these elements in the two sets of samples, taken just before and just after the Atomic Tests, are attributed to Synoptic rather than <b>Nuclear</b> <b>Fall-Out</b> effects...|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} study {{was made to}} determine the effective shielding provided by a modern reinforced-concrete office building (AEC Headquarters building) from <b>nuclear</b> <b>fall-out.</b> Pocket ionization chambers were used for measurement of the radiation-field strength. Fall-out was simulated with distributed and point-source configurations of Co/sup 60 / and Ir/sup 192 / sources. Four typical sections were selected for study, and experiments were performed on each. These included an external wing with exposed basement walls and an external wing with a buried basement. Roof studies were made on an internal wing with a full basement and on {{the east end of}} wing A, which has a thin-roof construction. The thick-roof construction of 8 in. of concrete and 2 in. of rigid insulation covers all the building except the east end of wing A, which has 4 in. of concrete and 2 in. of insulation. (auth...|$|E
40|$|THE {{problem of}} {{malignancy}} as a complication of radiation {{has become a}} subject of major interest in recent years, primarily due to {{the increased use of}} radioelements in industry, the widespread application of radiation techniques in medicine, and the concern with <b>nuclear</b> <b>fall-out</b> from weapons testing. Data oIn experimental carcinogenesis have emphasised cause and effect relationships and tumour incidence, but have provided little information on the antecedents of tumour induction related to radiation dose and dose rate, tissue response, and changes occurring between radiation exposure and the appearance of neoplasia. Even less information is available from the relatively small amount of human data obtained from clinical studies of radiation-induced cancer. Data gathered from clinical reports, however, particularly on localised radiation, indicate that doses required for cancer induction may be of a magnitude to produce some form of observable tissue damage (Cade, 1957; Cahan, Woodward, Higginbotham, Stewart and Coley, 1948; Glucksmann, Lamerton and Mayneord, 1957). This may not necessarily be associated with the result of architectural o...|$|E
