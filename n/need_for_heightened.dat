50|$|The {{primary purpose}} of a tablet counter (also known as a pill counter or drug counter) is to {{accurately}} count prescription medications in tablet or capsule form to aid the requirement for patient medication safety, to increase efficiency and reduce costs for the typical pharmacy. Newer versions of this counting device include advanced software to continue to improve safety for the patient who is receiving the prescription, ensuring that the pharmacy staff dispense the right medication at correct dosage strength for the right patient. (see also medication safety). Today’s pharmacy industry recognizes the <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>heightened</b> vigilance against medication errors across the entire spectrum. A wealth of {{research has been conducted}} regarding the prevalence of medication errors and the ability of technology to decrease or eliminate such errors. (See the March 2003 landmark study by Auburn University’s Center for Pharmacy Operations and Designs). Prescription dispensing safety and accuracy in the pharmacy are an essential part of ensuring the right patient gets the right medication at the right dosage. A trend in pharmacy is to place a greater reliance on technology and pharmacy automation to minimize the chance of human error and speed up the process of dispensing. Pharmacy management generally sees technology as a solution to industry challenges like staffing shortages, prescription volume increases, long and hectic work hours and complicated insurance reimbursement procedures. Instead of adding more staff, pharmacies employ advanced technologies that help to handle an ever-escalating number of prescriptions, while making dispensing safer and more precise.|$|E

To compare sexual behavior and sexual knowledge of PHIV+ and HIV-uninfected adolescents at an urban, tertiary-care center in New Jersey. Study Design. Modified Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance questionnaire was administered to PHIV+ and HIV-uninfected adolescents to assess and compare sexual behavior and knowledge over a 1 -year-period. Results. Twenty-seven PHIV+ and 100 HIV-uninfected adolescents were studied; 59 % PHIV+ and 52 % HIV-uninfected adolescents were sexually active. A significantly higher proportion of PHIV+ adolescents compared to HIV-uninfected adolescents reported ≥ 1 occasion of unprotected penetrative sex (p 4) sexual partners (p= 0. 037). Significantly more PHIV+ males reported receptive anal intercourse (p 80 % adolescents in both groups did not consider multiple sexual partners a risk factor for HIV transmission. Only 25 % PHIV+ adolescents reported disclosing their seropositive status to their first sexual partners. Conclusions. High risk sexual behaviors were significantly more prevalent among PHIV+ youths; however both groups demonstrated considerable gaps in sexual knowledge. There is an urgent <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>heightening</b> awareness about risky behaviors, interventions for prevention, and reproductive health promotion among adolescents...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{investigates the}} {{experiences}} of three postgraduate students studying on an MA TESOL and Applied Linguistics course in a British university context. It demonstrates how subtle discourses of „ownership‟ of English (Holliday, 2014; Pennycook, 1994, 2001; Kumaravadevelu, 2003) persist in such training contexts, despite the general shift towards internationalizing higher education environments in the UK. The paper will discuss how the participants negotiated the teaching practice components of the course, and the issues they faced through being „non-native‟ speakers of English. It further examines the impact this had on their professional development and self-perceptions of „legitimacy‟ as teachers of English. The different constructs of a TESOL teacher are discussed and the <b>need</b> <b>for</b> a <b>heightened</b> awareness of training <b>needs</b> <b>for</b> teachers across diverse contexts...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the assumptions that commonly underpin {{the design of}} participatory monitoring and evaluation (PM&E) within development programmes through the examination of {{a case study of}} a large rural development programme in Uganda. This case study reveals a mismatch between programme assumptions and participant perceptions, which stymied the implementation of PM&E. In this case, PM&E was based on the assumptions that programme and participant goals were compatible, participants were willing to volunteer and engage themselves for the greater good of their communities, and information sharing and communication was fairly free and open. However, farmers within the programme felt that the bureaucratic and accountability requirements of the programme were not their concern, and were acutely aware of power differences between farmers and programme officials, and between farmers of varying status. The key lesson to be drawn from this case is the <b>need</b> <b>for</b> a <b>heightened</b> awareness of power dynamics and political factors in the design of PM&E.

Symptoms of malaria are nonspecific and can include fever, chills, headache, nausea, and vomiting. There are several drug options for the prevention and treatment of malaria, including chloroquine (CQ). There is no evidence of prophylactic or treatment failures with CQ in Haiti. One study 1 found 6 % of P. falciparum isolates collected in the Artibonite Valley in Haiti in 2006 and 2007 carried a mutation known to confer parasite resistance to CQ.

Thirty-nine cases were diagnosed at the Angkor Hospital for Children, Siem Reap, between October 2005 and December 2008 after {{the introduction of}} microbiology capabilities. Median age was 7. 8 years (range = 1. 6 – 16. 2 years), 15 cases were male (38 %), and 4 cases had pre-existing conditions that may have pre-disposed the patient to melioidosis. Infection was localized in 27 cases (69 %) and disseminated in 12 cases (31 %). Eleven cases (28 %) were treated as outpatients, and 28 (72 %) cases were admitted.

Our findings indicate the <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>heightened</b> awareness of melioidosis in Cambodia, and they have led us to review microbiology procedures and antimicrobial prescribing of suspected and confirmed cases...|$|E
40|$|Electronic {{contractual}} arrangements have raised complex legal issues unprecedented in the law. Technology s impact on traditional contract law doctrines is readily {{apparent in the}} dilemmas generated by recent developments in computer software, hardware, and Internet transactions. In such transactions, sellers have increasingly begun utilizing “clickwrap” agreements, whereby standard terms and conditions are displayed {{on the computer screen}} when the user attempts to access the seller’s services. Not surprisingly, the enforceability of clickwrap terms, which are often not known to the user until after payment, has become a subject of much debate in the courts. Because many of the clickwrap cases have been fact-based decisions with seemingly contradictory conclusions, various scholarly and academic writings have pointed out the <b>need</b> <b>for</b> a <b>heightened</b> degree of certainty concerning the enforceability of clickwrap. The aim of this note is to provide clarity to the clickwrap debate and to argue that the legal reasoning behind the various clickwrap decisions has, in fact, been relatively consistent. More importantly, this note illustrates that clickwrap agreements are a legitimate form of contracting, and that objections to clickwrap are substantially no different from objections to most other forms of contracts...|$|R

The analysis of interview data revealed con-tradictions in two areas: (1) NPs espouse a <b>need</b> <b>for</b> <b>heightened</b> autonomy in their working associations with medical doctors, whereas conversely, MDs emphasize a need for ongoing connection, and (2) MDs argue that NPs should be more proactive problem solvers and frame their working relationships as educational. However, NPs argue that MDs enact patterns of behavior that limit proactive problem solving and curtail the educational potential of those relation-ships, thus reinforcing predictable work routines. Both areas of contradiction constitute what dialectical theorist Leslie Baxter refers to as “oppositions. ” Examples of these oppositions are provided in the analysis.
