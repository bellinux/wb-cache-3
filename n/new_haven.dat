5|$|Along {{this route}} between <b>New</b> <b>Haven</b> and Hartford, the Hartford and <b>New</b> <b>Haven</b> Turnpike was {{chartered}} in 1798 and opened in 1799, beginning at Grove Street in <b>New</b> <b>Haven</b> and leaving on Whitney Avenue, passing via Meriden and Berlin, and entering Hartford on Maple Avenue.

5|$|Although {{the route}} east of <b>New</b> <b>Haven</b> is {{electrified}} under Amtrak's 60 Hz traction power system, Shore Line East currently operates entirely with diesel locomotives.

The diesel trainsets will be moved to service on the Danbury or Waterbury branches, or to the planned Hartford Line from <b>New</b> <b>Haven</b> to Springfield.|$|E

50|$|Lond Daer's shipyards were starved {{of timber}} {{following}} the war, as {{the forces of}} Sauron had burnt almost all of what remained in Enedwaith and Minhiriath. Once its shipbuilding yards were no longer practicable, Lond Daer declined in importance, and the Númenórean hunger for ever more wealth shifted focus {{to the establishment of}} <b>newer</b> <b>havens</b> to the south, Pelargir and Umbar. Following this, Lond Daer was once again renamed, being now one of several major ports in Middle-earth, and was known as Lond Daer Enedh, or 'Great Middle Haven'. Despite this, Númenor still maintained traffic on the Gwathló as far as the city of Tharbad.|$|R

5|$|The <b>New</b> <b>Haven</b> and New London Railroad was {{merged with}} the New London and Stonington in 1857 to form the <b>New</b> <b>Haven,</b> New London and Stonington Railroad. The line was leased by the New York, Providence and Boston Railroad (NYP) in 1859. The NYP bought the section east of Groton {{outright}} in 1864; the section from New London westward was spun off as the Shore Line Railway. In 1870, the Shore Line was leased by the New York and <b>New</b> <b>Haven</b> Railroad, which itself {{became part of the}} New York, <b>New</b> <b>Haven</b> and Hartford Railroad in 1872. At some point during this series of events, the 1852-built station was replaced by a larger, two-story structure, which was also used by some through trains from the north.|$|E
5|$|U.S. Route 5 (US 5), a north–south U.S. Highway that is {{generally}} paralleled by Interstate 91, {{begins at the}} city of <b>New</b> <b>Haven</b> in Connecticut and heads north through western Massachusetts and eastern Vermont to the international border with Canada. Within Connecticut, US 5 proceeds north from <b>New</b> <b>Haven</b> and passes through Meriden and Hartford towards Springfield, Massachusetts.|$|E
5|$|US 5 roughly {{follows the}} route {{used by the}} Upper Boston Post Road, an early colonial highway for {{transporting}} mail between New York City and Boston. The route was first improved in 1798 as the Hartford and <b>New</b> <b>Haven</b> Turnpike, which ran in a nearly straight line between the court houses of <b>New</b> <b>Haven</b> and Hartford. In 1922, the Upper Boston Post Road corridor was designated as Route 2 of the New England road marking system, crossing {{to the east of}} the Connecticut River in Hartford before continuing north to the Massachusetts state line. In 1926, Route 2 was redesignated as U.S. Route 5. Several realignments {{have been made in the}} cities of <b>New</b> <b>Haven</b> and Hartford with the opening of several expressways in these areas. Because it is closely paralleled by Interstate 91 between <b>New</b> <b>Haven</b> and Hartford, US 5 serves mainly as a secondary route today.|$|E
