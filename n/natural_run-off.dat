The flood came before pending flood control legislation was enacted or any significant flood control measures implemented. The narrowness of the valleys and encroachment of buildings on the river banks contributed to record flooding. By the time nightfall came one-third of the city was under 17 ft of water and by the time flooding was over twenty-five people lost their lives. The damages, estimated at $43 million, made it the worst flood since the flood of 1889 and the event is chronicled at the Johnstown Flood Museum ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract]This thesis investigates {{a common}} problem of land use impacts on flood damage costs on a {{catchment}} scale. It does this through a particular case study, to quantify the technical upstream-downstream dependencies and highlights the externalities through hydroeconomic analysis of flood damages and mitigation costs. The substantive content of the project is cross disciplinary. Peak and volume of river flows are functions of the catchment surface characteristics. This means that any impacts to the run-off regime (for example surface sealing or river training) could affect people and land users in the lower catchment. Thus, upstream activities can cause higher flood peaks, and also entail higher damages downstream. These damages are either borne by the affected parties or they are mitigated by state financed flood defence works or offset with financial compensation. These costs are usually {{not included in the}} economic considerations of the upstream land user who is partially causing them. In economic terms, these effects are referred to as unidirectional externalities. This means that a producer can export parts of his production costs to third parties and these are not included in the price of the product. The Herzogbach is a small tributary of the Danube River in Lower Bavaria. It is located in a rural area, dominated by intensive farming practices. Two villages (Bachling and Buchhofen) in the headwaters and middle section of the catchment and one city (Osterhofen) in the lower catchment were analysed to determine the impact of upstream land use practices on the flood situation. A combination of hydrological and hydraulic modelling provided the core data to allow the interpretation of economic data, using methods of cost damage estimation. A hydrological model of the catchment provided hydrograph simulations based on (a) a regionalisation approach, (b) hydrologic flood routing and (c) hydrologic reservoir routing. A two dimensional stream flow model was then used to convert the hydrographs into flood levels, to simulate the run-off in settled areas and determine the flood affected areas, flood levels and flow velocities. Estimates for flood damages or mitigation costs resulting from different hydrological scenarios were compared. The scenarios are based on different land uses and allow economic externalities to be estimated. It was found that intensive farming and river training increase the peaks, shape and volume of flood waves in comparison to extensive land use, grassland or forest. In the study area, especially river training reduced the detention effect of the river bed and the natural flood plain. These significant changes to the <b>natural</b> <b>run-off</b> regime directly affect land use in the lower catchment through flood damages and increased flood risk, and by reducing the effectiveness of planned or existing flood protection works. The thesis concludes with linked technical and economic findings which indicate a rich potential new area for research - “hydroeconomics”. The published literature shows few people have worked in this cross disciplinary area. The technical finding is that changes to land use, especially in agriculture, can increase the flood damages in downstream settlements or increase the cost of flood mitigation works significantly. From an economic point of view, this is a unidirectional externality which should be considered in catchment and flood management. Possible solutions could include the control of land use and instruments such as separate waste water fees for rainwater and sewage or run-off certificates...|$|E
50|$|Regulation causes {{flooding}} to be decreased {{during the}} winter and spring months, and water more consistently flows {{during the summer and}} autumn months. Since the river red gum disperses its seed during spring, regulating the water may affect the species' ability to disperse using water as a dispersing agent, especially in floodplain red gum forests. <b>Natural</b> water <b>run-off</b> can also be affected, leaving some trees permanently flooded due to the build-up of water behind dams, or the permanent water flow. Neither can seeds germinate in constantly flooded areas.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{laboratory studies}} of sulphidic mine tailings remediated by flooding, and a pilot-scale study of dry cover for remediation of unoxidised sulphide-rich tailings. At the Kristineberg Zn-Cu mine in northern Sweden, sulphide-rich, poorly buffered tailings have been deposited in five impoundments located along a valley. By increasing pH by liming, thereby reducing metal mobility, a water-covered downstream impoundment {{is made to}} function as a trap for metals released from the till-covered impoundments upstream. As a result of the liming, a calcite-gypsum sludge has been formed on the tailings. The potential metal release from the sludge during resuspension events and in a long-term perspective was investigated by performing a shake flask test and sequential extraction of the sludge. A laboratory mixing experiment was performed to simulate the flocculation processes that occur in limed tailings ponds if stream water is diverted through a pond {{as a part of a}} remediation programme. The laboratory studies showed that the sequentially extracted carbonate and oxide fractions together contained ≥ 97 % of the total amount of Cd, Co, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn in the sludge. The association of these metals with carbonates and oxides appears to result from sorption and/or co-precipitation reactions at the surfaces of calcite and Fe, Al and Mn oxyhydroxides forming in the impoundment. In the shake flask test, remobilisation of Zn, Cu, Cd and Co (at a pH of 7 - 9) from the sludge resulted in dissolved concentrations of these metals that were significantly lower than those predicted to result from dissolution of the carbonate fraction of the sludge. This may suggest that cationic Zn, Cu, Cd and Co remobilised from dissolving calcite, gypsum and Al oxyhydroxides were readsorbed onto Fe oxyhydroxides remaining stable under oxic conditions. The laboratory mixing experiment showed that the flocculants that settled were rich in C (18 wt%) and acid leachable Fe (14 - 19 wt%). Thus, organic matter and Fe oxyhydroxides appear to form substantial fractions of the flocculants. Trace metal uptake in the flocculants that settled in the mixing bottles resulted in removal of Cd, Co, Cu and Zn from the dissolved phase. Another part this thesis work focuses on the hydrological aspects of dry covers. The water balance in well-defined, pilot-scale systems with various types of dry cover applied on mine tailings at the Kristineberg site has been studied. Experimental studies of water infiltration through dry covers on sulphidic tailings can be used for predicting cover performance and cover design parameters relating to the same climate conditions and the same type of tailings. For this purpose, different multilayer covers have been applied in pilot-scale test cells. Clayey till, sewage sludge, Trisoplast (a mixture of a polymer, bentonite and tailings sand) and fine-grained apatite are used as sealing layers, on top of which a protective cover of unspecified till has been applied. To be able to evaluate the behaviour of the multilayer covers in tailings-impoundment scale, and to predict how the different barrier constructions influence infiltration rate and water balance, the experimental soil covers have been monitored for water percolation, climate conditions and frost penetration. The different infiltration rates in different cells were discussed. The initial results for the first two years of monitoring suggest that the apatite concentrate as a sealing layer is more promising in reducing net infiltration than a 0. 3 m thick clayey till. The high fractions of water percolated through the sealing layers (~ 30 % of precipitation) may be explained by the absence of <b>natural</b> <b>run-off</b> from the experimental cells. The results show that snowmelt, freezing of the soil and differences in soil hydraulic properties appear to have effects on the differences in water balance in the cells.

40|$|Maseru is {{the capital}} of Lesotho and is the country’s main centre for {{commerce}} and industry. The study area {{is located on the}} north-eastern outskir ts of the Maseru urban area. The catchment occupies an area of 44 km 2, with a length of approximately 13 km and channel slope of 0. 4 km/km. The Maqalika Reservoir was built in 1983 to meet the water demand for Maseru until 1995, and its storage ca-pacity was 3. 7 mm 3. The storage is gradu-ally decreasing as sediment, carried by the <b>natural</b> catchment <b>run-off,</b> accumulates in the reservoir. Moreover, water pumped into the reservoir from the Caledon River (which is heavily sedimented) has its own contribution of silt. This paper attempts to find the volume occupied by accumulated sedimentation in the reservoir. For the deter-mination of sedimentation through pumping, hydrological data was generated using two stations upstream, and results were used in Basson and Rooseboom trap efficiency mathematical equations, which yielded 6 789 m 3.

40|$|The Line Islands are calcium {{carbonate}} coral reef platforms located in iron-poor {{regions of the}} central Pacific. <b>Natural</b> terrestrial <b>run-off</b> of iron is non-existent and aerial deposition is extremely low. However, a number of ship groundings have occurred on these atolls. The reefs surrounding the shipwreck debris are characterized by high benthic cover of turf algae, macroalgae, cyanobacterial mats and corallimorphs, as well as particulate-laden, cloudy water. These sites also have very low coral and crustose coralline algal cover and are call black reefs because of the dark-colored benthic community and reduced clarity of the overlying water column. Here we {{use a combination of}} benthic surveys, chemistry, metagenomics and microcosms to investigate if and how shipwrecks initiate and maintain black reefs. Comparative surveys show that the live coral cover was reduced from 40 to 60 % to 0. 75 km). The phase shift occurs rapidly; the Kingman black reef formed within 3 years of the ship grounding. Iron concentrations in algae tissue from the Millennium black reef site were six times higher than in algae collected from reference sites. Metagenomic sequencing of the Millennium Atoll black reef-associated microbial community was enriched in iron-associated virulence genes and known pathogens. Microcosm experiments showed that corals were killed by black reef rubble through microbial activity. Together these results demonstrate that shipwrecks and their associated iron pose significant threats to coral reefs in iron-limited regions...|$|R

40|$|The {{influence}} of aggregate stability on run-off and erosion {{has often been}} reported from experiments on microplots (about 1 m 2) under simulated rain. Our objective was to compare the aggregate stability of topsoil (0 - 10 cm) with run-off and erosion from experiments on run-off plots (about 100 - 1000 m 2) under <b>natural</b> rain. <b>Run-off</b> and soil losses were measured over three years on 14 plots in Benin, Cameroon and Mexico. All plots were under herbaceous vegetation and had moderate slope length and slope declivity, but differed in climate (400 - 1600 mm annual rainfall), soil type (sandly clay loam Nitosol, loamy sand Ferralsol, loamy Regosol), and management (from savanna to long-duration mouldboard ploughing). The stability of aggregates was determined by immersing and wet-sieving 2 -mm sieved air-dried samples into water. Mean annual run-off rate and soil losses generally increased, {{and the proportion of}} stable macroaggregates (greater than 0. 2 mm) decreased, with increasing duration and intensity of tillage, and with decreasing cover on the soil surface. For all 14 plots, run-off and soil losses were closely correlated with aggregate stability; correlations were improved when slope gradient and climate aggressivity were considered in addition to aggregation. Slaking, the main mechanism of aggregate breakdown wich occurs when dry soil is immersed, accounted well for run-off and erosion. The stability of topsoil aggregates seems therefore to be a valuable indicator of field-assessed run-off and erosion for plots on moderate slopes with herbaceous vegetation. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
40|$|Slash-and-burn land {{clearing}} on sloping land {{may lead to}} increased soil run-off following disappearance of the protective vegetative cover. In turn, soil run-off and redeposition affects soil fertility and spatial patterns of fertility parameters in a field. This study seeks to clarify the role of spatial patterns of post-burn dead biomass (necromass) in soil run-off and redeposition and their combined effect on spatial patterns in soil pH and resin-extractable P. The study is carried out on a post-productive rubber (Hevea brasiliensis) agroforest in Sumatra, Indonesia. Soils are classified as Dystric Fluvisols. After slash-and-burn of vegetation, the field was planted with rubber seedlings and rice (Oryza sativa). For comparison the adjacent rubber agroforest site was sampled. Soil run-off is expressed here as the quantity of downward moving soil that passed the specific location of a flow trap. Existing physical soil run-off barriers and crop performance were scored. Despite serious soil run-off from the steeper upper slopes little soil was actually lost because of the slope form of the field, presence of <b>natural</b> soil <b>run-off</b> barriers, and the planted crop. Spatial variability of soil pH decreased {{at the expense of}} small-scale, within-strata, variability mainly because of the patchy distribution of soil run-off barriers. Soil run-off, aggravated by slash-and-burn, did not result in development of a clear soil fertility gradient down slope. In areas of high soil run-off potential, clear burns should be avoided because soil run-off barriers like remnants of slash-and-burn and surface litter maintain the soil and its fertility.

40|$|The {{level of}} land {{consumption}} for housing and transport {{contrasts sharply with}} both the necessity and the legal obligation to maintain the ecological potential afforded by open spaces {{to meet the needs}} of current and future generations in terms of resource protection and climate change. Owing to the increasing intensity of soil usage, in many urban landscapes the soil conditions has deteriorated. The <b>natural</b> filter and <b>run-off</b> regulating functions of soils are impaired or even disappeared altogether by land surfacing. Since such soil functions closely depend on the soil’s biophysical properties, the decline of water balance functionality caused by urbanisation and increasing imperviousness varies. In response to the demand to sustainably secure urban water resources, it needs to be assessed exactly how land surfacing affects the functions concerned. Analysing and evaluating the urban land use change and the respective imperviousness on the long-term water balance ought to improve our general understanding of the water household related impact of urbanisation. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to assess the impact of urban land use change and land surfacing on the long-term water balance over a 130 -year trajectory using the example of Leipzig.

40|$|Graduation date: 1983 Polynuclear {{aromatic}} hydrocarbons (PNAH) classified as noncarcinogens may be photooxidized to mutagenic or toxic products by near-ultraviolet (NUV) wavelengths of sunlight (290 - 320 nm). The {{possibility that this}} represents a major degredation pathway in the aquatic environment is of increasing concern. Large quantities of PNAH from accidental oil spills, anthropogenic and <b>natural</b> combustion, surface <b>run-offs,</b> and industrial discharges are being released into the aquatic ecosystem. In addition there is growing evidence that the stratospheric ozone layer may be diminishing. As a result, more NUV wavelengths from sunlight will reach the earth's surface. The {{purpose of this study}} was to design a system that can measure the effects of simulated sunlight (290 nm) irradiated PNAH on mammalian cells. A second observation was to utilize the system developed, to collect preliminary data on the effects of two PNAH parent compounds, fluoranthene and phenanthrene, on mammalian cells. The first set of experiments, conducted during development of the system, involved the selection of methanol as the most suitable PNAH solvent. Determination of the rate of PNAH degradation was also determined during the initial experiments. Other system-related experiments included an analysis of the effects of (a) plastic tissue-culture dishes, (b) methanol, (c) phosphate buffered saline (PBS), and (d) 5 -bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) on the induction of sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs) and/or cell survivals of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. The experimental results indicated that none of these factors significantly affected either the survival or the number of induced SCEs in the CHO cells. Preliminary data indicated that in the absence of simulated sunlight, PNAH compounds did not cause an increase in SCEs, nor a decrease in cell survival. However, CHO cells exposed to supersaturated concentrations of fluoranthene and a simulated sunlight (290 nm) light dose of 2000 or 3000 j-sec/m² did not survive. At similar light doses and lower fluoranthene concentrations, the induction of SCEs and mutation frequency were increased. The data from phenanthrene studies indicated there was a decrease in survival in cells exposed to super-saturated concentrations and a simulated sunlight (290 nm) dose of 6000 j-sec/m² The number of SCEs was not increased in cells exposed to lower phenanthrene concentrations and light doses of 2000 or 3000 j-sec/m²...|$|R
