40|$|AbstractRapid {{inactivation}} of {{the yeast}} phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase {{in the course}} of aminoacylation of the heterologous E. coli tRNAPhe is observed. This inactivation occurs due to the formation of the tight complex of the enzyme with the pyrophosphate formed during the aminoacylation reaction.

It is concluded that cystathionine gamma-synthetase catalyzes the formation of homocysteine directly from O-succinylhomoserine and an as-yet-unidentified sulfur donor.

40|$|Is {{there an}} {{association}} {{between the number of}} CGG repeats in the FMR 1 gene in the <b>normal</b> and <b>intermediate</b> range and age at natural menopause? The number of CGG repeats in the <b>normal</b> and <b>intermediate</b> range in the FMR 1 gene was not associated with age at natural menopause. Excessive triple CGG repeats in the FMR 1 gene have been widely associated with primary ovarian insufficiency. Recently, the number of CGG repeats in the <b>normal</b> and <b>intermediate</b> range (up to 55 repeats) was found to be associated with serum levels of anti-Mllerian hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone, as markers for ovarian ageing. This suggests that repeats in the <b>normal</b> and <b>intermediate</b> range could be involved in the rate of exhaustion of the ovarian primordial follicle pool and ultimately the timing of menopause. Cross-sectional study in a population-based sample of 3611 Caucasian women with natural menopause. The FMR 1 CGG repeat number was determined by PCR amplification in 3611 women with a known age at natural menopause. A possible relation between CGG repeats in the <b>normal</b> and <b>intermediate</b> range (up to 55 repeats) and menopausal age were analysed in various ways, including linear regression analysis and analysis of variance. The number of CGG repeats in the <b>normal</b> and <b>intermediate</b> range in the FMR 1 gene was not associated with age at natural menopause. The mean age at menopause was 50. 30 (4. 2) years for women with 45 repeats and 50. 64 (3. 4) years for women with intermediate-sized repeats (P 0. 37). Linear regression analysis of the number of CGG repeats showed no association with menopausal age (0. 019, P 0. 16). In our cohort, age at menopause was self-reported and determined retrospectively. Earlier observations suggesting that the number of CGG repeats in the <b>normal</b> and <b>intermediate</b> range is associated with the individual variation of the ovarian ageing process could not be confirmed in the current, large sample size study. A relation between the number of CGG repeats in the <b>normal</b> and <b>intermediate</b> range and age at natural menopause appeared to be absent. This finding questions the role of CGG repeat sizes in the ovarian ageing process. N. C. O. -M., Y. T. S. and H. K. P. A. have nothing to declare. M.

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the role of}} the intermediate filament protein vimentin in the normal differentiation and morphogenesis of the eye lens fiber cells, we generated transgenic mice bearing multiple copies of the chicken vimentin gene. In most cases, the vimentin transgene was overexpressed in the lenses of these animals, reaching up to 10 times the endogenous levels. This high expression of vimentin interfered very strongly with the normal differentiation of the lens fibers. The normal fiber cell denucleation and elongation processes were impaired and the animals developed pronounced cataracts, followed by extensive lens degeneration. The age of appearance and extent of these abnormalities in the different transgenic lines were directly related to the vimentin level.

Among 601 adults referred for DB from 1992 to 2001, 46 were diagnosed with CF. The sweat test was positive in 37 patients and <b>normal</b> or <b>intermediate</b> in nine patients. Two CF mutations were identified in 18 patients (39 %) by screening for 31 mutations and in 36 patients (78 %) after complete genetic analysis. NPD was suggestive of CF in 71 % of the patients. The combination of the sweat test and genetic analysis led to the diagnosis of CF in 45 patients. In the nine patients with <b>normal</b> or <b>intermediate</b> sweat test, the diagnosis was confirmed by screening for 31 mutations in five, by complete genetic screening in three, and by NPD in the remaining patient. Searching for CF should start with sweat test. If the sweat test is <b>normal</b> or <b>intermediate,</b> screening for 31 mutations may help to diagnose CF. A complete genetic analysis is indicated when only one mutation is detected and/or when other clinical features, such as obstructive azoospermia or pancreatic insufficiency, are suggestive of CF.
