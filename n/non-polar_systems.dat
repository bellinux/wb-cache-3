40|$|From {{microscopic}} point-dipole model {{calculations of}} the {{screening of the}} Coulomb interaction in <b>non-polar</b> <b>systems</b> by polarizable atoms, {{it is known that}} screening strongly depends on dimensionality. For example, in one dimensional systems the short range interaction is screened, while the long range interaction is anti-screened. This anti-screening is also observed in some zero dimensional structures, i. e. molecular systems. By means of ab-initio calculations in conjunction with the random-phase approximation (RPA) within the FLAPW method we study screening of the Coulomb interaction in FexOy clusters. For completeness these results are compared with their bulk counterpart magnetite. It appears that the onsite Coulomb interaction is very well screened both in the clusters and bulk. On the other hand for the intersite Coulomb interaction the important observation is made that it is almost contant throughout the clusters, while for the bulk it is almost completely screened. More precisely and interestingly, in the clusters anti-screening is observed by means of ab-initio calculations...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work is to compare two models, which are able to perform Vapor-Liquid Equilibrium (VLE) predictions. The first one, the LCVM model, is an EoS/G(E) one {{and it has been}} {{successfully}} applied in the prediction of the VLE behavior of polar and <b>non-polar</b> <b>systems,</b> as well as, systems of dissimilar component size. such as those containing gases with large n-alkanes. The second one is PHCT, an equation of state based on the perturbed hard chain theory. It has also been successfully applied in binary systems of supercritical fluids and non-polar molecules and in systems containing light gases and large n-paraffins. The comparisons results presented in this paper, proved that the two models are comparable, concerning the ability to predict the VLE, as well as, the volumetric behavior of systems with low to medium component size difference (supercritical fluids with non-polar components up to about 10 carbon atoms). However, as the size difference increases, LCVM performs better, especially in the near critical region of such systems. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

We show that in low dimensions and small finite-size systems this screening deviates strongly from that conventionally assumed. In fact in one dimension the short-range interaction is strongly screened and the long-range interaction is anti-screened thereby strongly reducing the gradient of the Coulomb interaction and therefore the correlation effects. We argue that this effect explains the success of mean-field single-particle theories for large molecules. A very old {{and perhaps the most}} intellectually challenging problem in condensed-matter physics concerns the role of the Coulomb interaction in determining the physical properties of solids. In wide-bandwidth semiconductors the Coulomb interactions give rise to Wannier excitonic states; in narrow band materials the Coulomb interactions can result in insulating and usually magnetic ground states as in the 3 D transition metal oxides, rare earths, or ac-tinides, and very strongly bound excitons well inside the conductivity gap.

40|$|A {{route for}} the compatibilization of aqueous dispersions of {{cellulose}} nanofibrils (CNFs) with a non-polar polymer matrix is proposed {{to overcome a}} major challenge in CNF-based material synthesis. Non-ionic surfactants were used in CNF aqueous dispersions equilibrated with an organic phase (for demonstration, a polystyrene solution, PS, was used). Stable water-in-oil-in-water (W/O/W) double emulsions were produced {{as a result of}} the compromise between composition and formulation variables. Most remarkably, the proposed route for CNF integration with hydrophobic polymers removed the need for drying or solvent-exchange of the CNF aqueous dispersion prior to processing. The rheological behavior of the double emulsions showed strong shear thinning behavior and facilitated CNF-PS co-mixing in solid nanofibers upon electrospinning. The morphology and thermal properties of the resultant nanofibers revealed that CNFs were efficiently integrated in the hydrophobic matrix which was consistent with the high interfacial area of the precursor double emulsion. In addition, the morphology and quality of the composite nanofibers can be controlled by the conductivity (ionic strength) of the CNF dispersion. Overall, double emulsion systems are proposed as a novel, efficient and scalable platform for CNF co-processing with <b>non-polar</b> <b>systems</b> and they open up the possibility for the redispersion of CNFs after removal of the organic phase.

40|$|In this work, the {{interactions}} of a well-studied hydrophobin with different types of nonpolar model substances {{and their impact on}} primary gushing is evaluated. The nature, length, and degree of saturation of nonpolar molecules are key parameters defining the gushing ability or inhibition. When mixed with hydrophobins, the nonpolar molecule-hydrophobin assembly acts as a less gushing or no gushing system. This effect can be explained in the framework of a competition effect between <b>non-polar</b> <b>systems</b> and CO 2 to interact with the hydrophobic patch of the hydrophobin. Interactions of these molecules with hydrophobins are promoted {{as a result of the}} similar size of the nonpolar molecules with the hydrophobic patch of the protein, at the expense of the formation of nanobubbles with CO 2. In order to prove the presence of interactions and to unravel the mechanisms behind them, a complete set of experimental techniques was used. Surface sensitive techniques clearly show the presence of {{the interactions}}, whose nature is not covalent nor hydrogen bonding according to infrared spectroscopy results. Interactions were also reflected by particle size analysis in which mixtures of particles displayed larger size than their pure component counterparts.

40|$|The {{reaction}} of dimethyldioxirane {{with a series}} of cis/trans- 1, 2 -dialkylalkenes was carried out and produced the corresponding epoxides in high yield. As expected, the relative reactivity at 23 ºC of the cis-alkenes was at least 8 -fold greater than that of the trans-counterparts with the magnitude of the relative reactivity increasing with increased steric bulk. Enhanced selectivity for cis- versus trans-alkene epoxidation was observed at lower temperatures. The {{reaction of}} dimethyldioxirane with selected alkenes was carried out in various solvent conditions (dried acetone:acetonitrile (1 : 9), dried acetone:methanol (1 : 9), dried acetone:carbon tetrachloride (1 : 9) and acetone:water (Xwater = 0. 00, 0. 01, 0. 02, 0. 03, 0. 04, 0. 05)) and produced the corresponding epoxides in high yield. The reactivity of dioxirane with simple di- and trialkylalkenes was enhanced as the polarity and hydrogen bonding capability of the solvent system were increased. Little to no change in reactivity was observed in the <b>non-polar</b> solvent <b>system.</b> Epoxidation of trisubstituted alkenes by dioxirane showed a greater rate enhancement in polar protic solvents compared to that for the epoxidation of the disubstituted alkenes. The epoxidation of an allylic alcohol by dimethyldioxirane showed a large increase in the <b>non-polar</b> solvent <b>system</b> compared to that in acetone. The reaction of dimethyldioxirane with the allylic alcohol also exhibited less of a rate increase in polar protic systems than its alkyl counterpart. Activation parameters for the epoxidation of cis/trans- 1, 2 -dialkylalkenes by dioxirane in dried acetone and the previously mentioned solvent systems were determined using the Arrhenius method. In general, the ∆G‡ and ∆H‡ terms were greater for the reaction of dimethyldioxirane with trans-alkenes as compared to those for the corresponding cis-isomers regardless of solvent or alkyl steric bulk. The calculated ∆S‡ terms appeared essentially independent of steric bulk or solvent composition and were roughly identical, within experimental error, for all of the five cis/trans pairs. The ∆∆G‡ values, a comparison of the trans- to the cis-isomer data, yielded values of 1. 2 to 1. 8 kcal/mol in dried acetone for the five pairs of alkenes and appeared to be dependent on relative steric interactions. The ∆∆G‡ values for the epoxidation of cis/trans-alkenes carried out in solvents other than acetone showed no change from the value obtained in acetone.

Silicic acid chromatography yielded two main types of lipid, polar lipid (77 per cent) and glyceride (22 per cent). Thin layer chromatography revealed that the polar lipid consisted of two components, slow polar lipid and fast polar lipid. A solvent system was devised which resolved the two polar lipids on a silicic acid column. The fast polar lipid constituted 54 per cent and the slow polar lipid 23 per cent of the total lipid. Amino nitrogen and choline were not detected in the polar lipids, but the slow lipid contained carbohydrate. The infrared spectra of the fast and slow lipids were consistent {{with that of a}} phosphatide. Chemical analysis of the fast polar lipid indicated n ester:phosporus ratio of 4. 9 : 2 and 3. 75 per cent phosphorous. Paper chromatography of the deacylated lipid before and after hydrolysis suggested that the water-soluble moiety was diglycerophosphorylglycerol (GPGPG).

In the recent years the « heat of transfer » concept has been successfully applied to <b>non-polar</b> <b>systems,</b> but in aqueous systems the situations is more complicated due to charge effects and strong specific cross interactions so that this concept fails. It turns out that this simple non-equilibrium environment created by a temperature gradient can be successfully employed to monitor for example the reaction kinetics of large proteins with small substrate molecules, which {{play an important role in}} living organisms and drug development. The strong sensitivity of the proteins and other water soluble biomolecules is probably caused by a change in the hydration layer, which is influenced by subtle conformation changes induced by the binding of the substrate molecule. To get a better understanding of these phenomena we investigated systematically various small molecules, microemulsions and colloids by a holographic grating method called infrared thermal diffusion forced Rayleigh scattering (IR-TDFRS). Looking at the various systems we can identify certain rules of thumb which will be discussed. Open questions such as the molecular size dependence of the thermal diffusion coefficient and its relation with the interfacial tension and charge effects are considered. Finally we discuss how thermophoresis might be used in the near future as an alternative strategy to design synthetic microswimmers, micromotors, or micropumps, which have become promising tools in the field of microfluidics.

40|$|III-nitrides are {{promising}} materials for intersubband devices {{operating in the}} near- and far-infrared due to the large conduction band offset (3 ̆e 1 eV), longitudinal-optical phonon energy (90 meV), and fast intersubband relaxation time (80 fs). However, several challenges impede progress towards the realization of high performance III-nitride optoelectronic devices. To address these challenges, this thesis investigates the optical properties of intersubband transitions in the III-nitrides. The {{studies were carried out}} across several III-nitride material combinations, including the relatively well developed c-axis AlGaN/GaN material system, the lattice-matched AlInN/GaN <b>system,</b> and the <b>non-polar</b> m-axis AlGaN/GaN <b>system.</b> The latter systems are relatively unexplored, and promise to alleviate specific material challenges, namely the lattice-mismatch and internal polarization fields associated with the well developed c-axis AlGaN/GaN material system. ^ In the c-axis AlGaN/GaN material system, we study the impact of doping profile on the transition energy, linewidth and magnitude. An optimal doping profile is determined and the results are understood through band structure calculations that consider the influence of many-body effects, interface roughness, and the transition lifetime. We also demonstrate quantum well infrared photodetectors and electromodulators on low-defect GaN-on-sapphire and free-standing GaN substrates, proving the suitability of low-defect substrates for III-nitride devices. The optimization and theoretical understanding of the optical properties, along with the successful demonstration of intersubband devices, is an important contribution to the future design of III-nitride devices. For the lattice-matched AlInN/GaN system, we demonstrate direct intersubband absorption for the first time. However, we find the strength of the intersubband absorption to be much smaller than expected. The poor performance of AlInN/GaN superlattices is attributed to columnar alloy inhomogeneity observed in structural characterization data. The impact of these inhomogeneities on the absorption properties is understood using 3 D band structure calculations, and results suggest further optimization of the growth conditions is required. Terahertz intersubband absorption in the <b>non-polar</b> m-axis <b>system</b> is also demonstrated for the first time.

Presently researchers design synthetic microswimmers, micromotors, or micropumps to explore possibilities to recycle waste heat using such microfluidic devices [2]. So far there is only a limited microscopic understanding of thermodiffusion or thermophoresis in simple and complex fluids. In the recent years some progress has been made for <b>non-polar</b> <b>systems,</b> but in aqueous systems the situation is complicated due to charge effects and strong specific cross interactions so that simple thermodynamic concepts fail. On the other hand a detailed understanding of aqueous systems would be valuable due to important applications in biotechnology, where the response to temperature gradients is successfully employed to monitor the reaction kinetics of large proteins with small ligand molecules. The strong sensitivity of proteins and other water soluble biomolecules is probably caused by a change in the hydration layer, which is influenced by subtle conformation changes induced by the binding of the ligand molecule. To get a better understanding we systematically investigated various small water soluble molecules, microemulsions and colloids by a holographic grating method called infrared thermal diffusion forced Rayleigh scattering (IR-TDFRS). In order to elucidate the mechanism in biomolecules we performed systematic measurements of amides, which often serve as model systems for peptide bonds, an essential structure in proteins. Using the experimental data determined for fomamide we perform numerical finite-element simulations in hydrothermal pores and show that a combination of thermophoresis and convection can lead to accumulation of formamide up to concentrations where nucleobases are formed [3], which might serve as an ‘origin-of-life’ scenario. Further we study microemulsion droplets as soft colloids to investigate the relation between the interfacial tension and the Soret coefficient [4]. Other important contributions in aqueous systems are charge effects, which we study systematically for colloidal model systems. Using a theoretical model by Dhont and Briels [5] valid for spherical charged colloids with arbitrary double-layer thicknesses we are able to calculate the surface charge density of the colloid. It turns out that the surface charge density agrees well with electrophoresis measurements. The same holds for an extended model for charged colloidal rods [6].

40|$|Thermophoresis or Thermal diffusion, {{which is}} also known as the Ludwig–Soret effect, is the {{phenomenon}} where mass transport is induced by a temperature gradient in a multi-component system. So far there is no microscopic understanding for fluids. In the recent years the « heat of transfer » concept has been successfully applied to <b>non-polar</b> <b>systems,</b> but in aqueous systems the situations is complicated due to charge effects and strong specific cross interactions so that this concept fails. Recently Dhont and Briels [1] calculated the double-layer contribution to the single-particle thermal diffusion coefficient of charged, spherical colloids with arbitrary double-layer thickness. In this approach three forces are taken into account, which contribute to the total thermophoretic force on a charged colloidal sphere due its double layer: i) the force FW that results from the temperature dependence of the internal electrostatic energy W of the double layer, ii) the electric force Fel with which the temperature-induced non-spherically symmetric double-layer potential acts on the surface charges of the colloidal sphere and iii) the solvent-friction force Fsol {{on the surface of the}} colloidal sphere due to the solvent flow that is induced in the double layer because of its asymmetry. This concept has successfully been used to describe the Soret coefficient of Ludox particles as function of the Debye length [2] (cf. Fig. 1). The surface charge density of the Ludox particles is independently obtained from electrophoresis measurements, the size of the colloidal particles is obtained from electron microscopy, and the Debye length is calculated from the ion concentration. Therefore the only adjustable parameter in the comparison with theory is the intercept at zero Debye length, which measures the contribution to the Soret coefficient of the solvation layer and possibly the colloid core material. Later the concept was extended for charged colloidal rods [3]. As model system we used the charged, rod-like fd-virus. The wild type fd-virus has a contour length L of 880 nm, a radius R of 3. 4 nm, and a persistence length LP of 2. 2 µm. The Soret coefficient of the fd-viruses increases monotonically with increasing Debye length (cf. Fig. 1), while there is a relatively weak dependence on the rod-concentration when the ionic strength is kept constant. Additionally to the intercept at zero Debye length we used the surface charge density as an adjustable parameter. Experimentally we found a surface charge density of 0. 050  0. 003 e/nm 2, which compares well the surface charge density, of 0. 066  0. 004 e/nm 2, which has been determined by electrophoresis measurements taking into account the ion condensation. All experiments so far have been performed with the so-called infrared thermal diffusion forced Rayleigh scattering technique [4], with a writing wavelength of 980 nm, which corresponds to an absorption band of water with an approximate optical density equal to OD= 0. 5 cm- 1. This method uses the refractive index contrast between the different components and is therefore typically limited to binary mixtures. In order to study also biological colloids in buffer solutions we are presently developing a microscopic cell with heated wires. First results for some fluorescently labelled polystyrene lattices in the microwire cell are presented in comparison with thermal diffusion forced Rayleigh scattering measurements.

40|$|A central {{event in}} {{the origin of life}} was the {{self-assembly}} of amphiphilic, lipid-like compounds into closed microenvironments. If a primitive macromolecular replicating system could be encapsulated within a vesicular membrane, the components of the system would share the same microenvironment, and the result would be a step toward true cellular function. The goal of our research has been to determine what amphiphilic molecules might plausibly have been available on the early Earth to participate in the formation of such boundary structures. To this end, we have investigated primitive organic mixtures present in carbonaceous meteorites such as the Murchison meteorite, which contains 1 - 2 percent of its mass in the form of organic carbon compounds. It is likely that such compounds contributed to the inventory of organic carbon on the prebiotic earth, and were available to participate in chemical evolution leading to the emergence of the first cellular life forms. We found that Murchison components extracted into <b>non-polar</b> solvent <b>systems</b> are surface active, a clear indication of amphiphilic character. One acidic fraction self-assembles into vesicular membranes that provide permeability barriers to polar solutes. Other evidence indicates that the membranes are bimolecular layers similar to those formed by contemporary membrane lipids. We conclude that bilayer membrane formation by primitive amphiphiles on the early Earth is feasible. However, only a minor fraction of acidic amphiphiles assembles into bilayers, and the resulting membranes require narrowly defined conditions of pH and ionic composition to be stable. It seems unlikely, therefore, that meteoritic infall was a direct source of membrane amphiphiles. Instead, the hydrocarbon components and their derivatives more probably would provide an organic stock available for chemical evolution. Our current research is directed at possible reactions which would generate substantial quantities of membranogenic amphiphiles. One possibility is photochemical oxidation of hydrocarbons...|$|R
40|$|Numerical {{computations}} on {{the sphere}} in solving problems defined on the sphere suffer from many difficulties near the poles when using spherical polar coordinate {{system for the}} spherical surface. For example, in the computations of global weather prediction models, concentrated grid points near the poles {{increase the amount of}} computations in the pole region where quantities of interest are of less important than {{in other parts of the}} globe. Such problems are collectively called as the 'pole problems'. Avoiding pole problems have attracted some researches in the recent past. One of the recent development in this direction is to define grid meshes on the sphere which do not contain polar concentrated points. Among these the 'cubed sphere' defined from the surface of a unit cube has been used by some authors for approximating weather prediction models by finite difference and finite element methods. In a recent paper, one of the present authors has constructed weakly orthogonal spherical harmonics in a <b>non-polar</b> spherical co-ordinate <b>system</b> based on the cube sphere concept. This can be used for approximating functions on the sphere by spectral methods without the pole problems. In this work, we establish some Lin ear and recurrence relations between these two sets of spherical harmonics. We also exploit linear relations between harmonic components defined in the six faces of the cubed sphere...|$|R

ReVised Manuscript ReceiVed September 5, 1996 X Abstract: The {{parametrization}} {{and testing}} of the OPLS all-atom force field for organic molecules and peptides are described. Parameters for both torsional and nonbonded energetics have been derived, while the bond stretching and angle bending parameters have been adopted mostly from the AMBER all-atom force field. The torsional parameters were determined by fitting to rotational energy profiles obtained from ab initio molecular orbital calculations at the RHF/ 6 - 31 G*//RHF/ 6 - 31 G * level for more than 50 organic molecules and ions. The quality of the fits was high with average errors for conformational energies of less than 0. 2 kcal/mol. The force-field results for molecular structures are also demonstrated to closely match the ab initio predictions. The nonbonded parameters were developed in conjunction with Monte Carlo statistical mechanics simulations by computing thermodynamic and structural properties for 34 pure organic liquids including alkanes, alkenes, alcohols, ethers, acetals, thiols, sulfides, disulfides, aldehydes, ketones, and amides. Average errors in comparison with experimental data are 2 % for heats of vaporization and densities. The Monte Carlo simulations included sampling all internal and intermolecular degrees of freedom. It is found that such <b>non-polar</b> and monofunctional <b>systems</b> do not show significant condensed-phase effects on internal energies in going from the gas phase to the pure liquids...|$|R
40|$|Controlled {{heteroepitaxy}} {{and integration}} of arsenide based III-V compounds onto Si surfaces have been an important enabling technology for high efficiency solar cells and light emitters in satellite and optical interconnect applications. However, obtaining high crystal quality III-V compounds on Si, such as GaAs on Si is still challenging: (1) anti-phase domain (APD) boundary formation {{as the result of}} the polar GaAs growth on <b>non-polar</b> Si <b>system,</b> (2) a high density of threading dislocations generated by 4. 1 % lattice constant mismatch, and (3) the 62 % thermal expansion coefficient mismatch leading to cracks during the cooling process. The objective of this research is to obtain arsenide based III-V compounds monolithically integrated onto Si surfaces being APD-free with chemically abrupt GaAs/Si interfaces and possessing excellent optoelectronic properties. Patterned growth scheme by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) is the approach I undertook to integrate GaAs based III-V compounds onto exactly oriented Si substrates. And the research consists of the following three stages to fulfill the objective. (1) Precise positioning and low defect density selective area epitaxy for self-assembled/catalyst-free GaAs nanodisks on SiO 2 masked exactly oriented Si(100) substrates: Pure zincblende GaAs nanodisks with precise positioning and low defect density are demonstrated by selective area epitaxy. Defects in the epilayers are reduced by strain relaxation through facets formation and by a lateral overgrowth scheme atop the SiO 2 mask. (2) High-quality and defect-free GaAs thin film on SiO 2 masked exactly oriented Si(111) substrates by a two-step growth technique: Taking advantages of low energy for both Si(111) surface and GaAs/Si(111) interface, the two-step grown GaAs of total &# 8764; 175 nm atop patterned Si(111) substrates exhibits atomically smooth surface morphology, single crystallinity and a remarkably low defect density. (3) Successful integration of InGaAs/GaAs double heterostrucure onto SiO 2 masked exactly oriented Si(111) substrates with remarkably reduced thermal stress: The atomically smooth and high crystalline quality InGaAs/GaAs DH is realized. The confined misfit dislocations at the nucleation layer and nearly threading dislocation-free buffer layer contribute to the atomically sharp GaAs/Si interface. The remarkable reduction in the thermally induced stress corroborates the effectiveness of the square shape pattern design.

Effect of {{non-polar}} and polar lipid on {{rainbow trout}} myofibrils during frozen storage Sei-ichi ANDOU*, K 6 z 6 TAKAMA* * and K 6 ichi ZAMA** A model system {{was prepared to}} investigate the effect of lipid on myofibrils during frozen storage at- 20 °C. Changes on protein solubility, in vitro digestibility by trypsin and pepsin, and rheological properties were investigated. The results Were as follows: Salt soluble protein rapidly decreased during frozen storage and the patterns of protein insolubility were almost the same among each model system [untreated myofibrils (MF system), myofibrils treated with <b>non-polar</b> lipid (NPL <b>system)</b> and treated myofibrils with polar lipid (PL system) ]. In the NPL system, {{the result of the}} tryptic digestibility of the precipitate formed during frozen storage and that of the arginine content and free amino acid composition of the tryptic hydrolysate of the precipitate suggested that the degree of protein structural change is small. The precipitate formed during frozen storage was treated with cold a,cetone to obtain the dehydrated precipitate. The tryptic digestibility of this dehydrated precipitate gave the highest value in the PL system and the lowest in the MF system. From the differences of their digestibilities, it was considered that the water surrounding the sites attacked by the digestive enzyme is stabilized by lipid which leads to the control of freezing dehydration. These differences in digestibility also suggested that there is an important interaction between protein, water and lipid...|$|R
40|$|The atomic force {{microscope}} (AFM) is used {{to inject}} a sample, provide shear-driven liquid flow over a functionalized substrate, and detect separated components. This is demonstrated using lipophilic dyes and normal phase chromatography. A significant reduction in both size and separation time scales is achieved with a 25 -micron-length column scale, and one-second separation times. The approach has general applications to trace chemical and microfluidic analysis. The AFM is now a common tool for ultra-microscopy and nanotechnology. It has also been demonstrated to provide a number of microfluidic functions necessary for miniaturized chromatography. These include injection of sub-femtoliter samples, fluidic switching, and sheardriven pumping. The AFM probe tip {{can be used to}} selectively remove surface layers for subsequent microchemical analysis using infrared and tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy. With its ability to image individual atoms, the AFM is a remarkably sensitive detector {{that can be used to}} detect separated components. These diverse functional components of microfluidic manipulation have been combined in this work to demonstrate AFM mediated chromatography. AFM mediated chromatography uses channel-less, shear-driven pumping. This is demonstrated with a thin, aluminum oxide substrate and a <b>non-polar</b> solvent <b>system</b> to separate a mixture of lipophilic dyes. In conventional chromatographic terms, this is analogous to thin-layer chromatography using normal phase alumina substrate with sheardriven pumping provided by the AFM tip-cantilever mechanism. The AFM detection of separated components is accomplished by exploiting the variation in the localized friction of the separated components. The AFM tip-cantilever provides the mechanism for producing shear-induced flows and rapid pumping. Shear-driven chromatography (SDC) is a relatively new concept that overcomes the speed and miniaturization limitations of conventional liquid chromatography. SDC is based on a sliding plate system, consisting of two flat surfaces, one of which has a recessed channel. A fluid flow is produced by axially sliding one plate past another, where the fluid has mechanical shear forces imposed at each point along the channel length. The shear-induced flow rates are very reproducible, and do not have pressure or voltage gradient limitations. SDC opens up a new range of enhanced separation kinetics by permitting the sample confinement with submicron dimensions. Small, highly confined liquid is advantageous for chromatographic separation because the separation rate is known to scale according to the square of the confined sample diameter. In addition, because shear-driven flows are not limited by fluid velocity, shear-driven liquid chromatography may provide up to 100, 000 plate efficiency...|$|R
40|$|The correct {{treatment}} of vibronic effects {{is vital for}} the modeling of absorption spectra of solvated dyes, as many prominent spectral features can often be ascribed to vibronic transitions. Vibronic spectra can be computed within the Franck-Condon approximation for small dyes in solution using an implicit solvent model. However, implicit solvent models neglect specific solute-solvent interactions and provide only an approximate {{treatment of}} solvent polarization effects. Furthermore, temperature-dependent solvent broadening effects are often only accounted for using a broadening parameter chosen to match experimental spectra. On the other hand, ensemble approaches provide a straightforward way of accounting for solute-solvent interactions and temperature-dependent broadening effects by computing vertical excitation energies obtained from an ensemble of solute-solvent conformations. However, ensemble approaches do not explicitly account for vibronic effects and often produce spectral shapes in poor agreement with experiment. We address these shortcomings by combining the vibronic fine structure of an excitation obtained in the Franck-Condon picture at zero temperature with vertical excitations computed for a room-temperature ensemble of solute-solvent configurations. In this combined approach, all temperature-dependent broadening is therefore treated classically through the sampling of configurations, with vibronic contributions included as a zero-temperature correction to each vertical transition. We test the proposed method on Nile Red and the green fluorescent protein chromophore in polar and <b>non-polar</b> solvents. For <b>systems</b> with strong solute-solvent interaction, the approach yields a significant improvement over the ensemble approach, whereas for systems with weaker interactions, both the shape and {{the width of the}} spectra are in excellent agreement with experiment...|$|R

The time course of metabolism of aflatoxin B 1 by microsomal preparations isolated from control and phenobarbitone-pretreated rats was examined. The rate and extent of metabolism was greater with microsomal preparations from the latter. The formation of aflatoxin Q 1 was enhanced 4 [...] 5 -fold by phenobarbitone pretreatment, whereas the production of aflatoxin M 1 was only increased 1 [...] 2 -fold. The formation of the degradation product of aflatoxin B 1 2, 3 -dihydrodiol was increased 4 [...] 5 -fold by the pretreatment with phenobarbitone. 5. The microsomal metabolism of aflatoxins M 1, P 1 and Q 1 was examined. Aflatoxin M 1 apparently underwent very limited microsomal metabolism to more polar compounds. Aflatoxin P 1 was not metabolized. The situation with aflatoxin Q 1 was complicated {{in that it was}} metabolized in the absence of NADPH to an unidentified metabolite.

40|$|Transition {{metal oxides}} exhibit almost every {{physical}} state known however electronic changes at polar interfaces between transition metal oxides offer the tantalizing possibility to stabilize further novel ground states. These interface stabalized phases {{can also cause}} unintended reconstructions in thin films poised for inclusion in next-generation devices. Here we use {{scanning transmission electron microscopy}} (STEM) in conjunction with electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) to directly probe with atomic-resolution the charge distribution across transition metal oxide interfaces. We are particularly interested in quantifying the intrinsic electronic reconstructions while maintaining sensitivity to defects at the interface that could obscure the underlying electronic properties. We first investigate LuFe 2 O 4, purported to be the highest known ferroelectric ferrimagnet. We demonstrate that the local bonding of the oxygen atoms, incorporated into two distinct sites in the crystal, can be determined and mapped with atomic-resolution. We find no evidence for iron charge-ordering claimed to give rise to the ferroelectricity. We then investigate two similar interfaces between polar and <b>non-polar</b> perovskite oxides, <b>systems</b> that are typically considered with the polar catastrophe model framework. In the case of LaAlO 3 /SrTiO 3, we show an exquisite dependence of interface conductivity on the LaAlO 3 film composition. Using EELS, we demonstrate {{that in the case of}} La-rich films, cation vacancies accumulate at the interface to screen the polarization catastrophe without valence changes. In contrast, the La 1 [-]x Sr x MnO 3 /SrTiO 3 system investigated does not show these defect-mediated interfacial screening mechanisms. Rather, we demonstrate a quantitative agreement between interfacial charge transfer present on the manganese sites of the crystal and the polar catastrophe model for x < 0. 3, the insulating regime of the phase diagram. Finally, we investigate a related system to the La 1 [-]x Sr x MnO 3 films: ordered superlattices of (LaMnO 3) 2 n (SrMnO 3) n. Here we show a delocalization of the excess charge on the manganese sites for n [GREATER-THAN OR EQUAL TO] 2 as mapped by EELS spectroscopic imaging. Combined these four systems allow us a unique opportunity to measure electronic properties at oxide interfaces in real space with atomicresolution. 2019 - 05 - 2...|$|R
