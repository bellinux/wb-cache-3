50|$|Wartime {{conditions}} were severe for civilians; famine was rampant as grain production plunged and Germany seized food supplies {{for its own}} needs. Malaria became epidemic. The Germans retaliated brutally for sabotage by the Greek Resistance. Multiple resistance groups organized, but they often opposed each other. They included the National Republican Greek League (EDES), the National and Social Liberation (EKKA). Strongest {{of all was the}} Communist National Liberation Front (EAM); its military arm, the <b>National</b> <b>Popular</b> Liberation <b>Army</b> (ELAS) had 50,000 soldiers.

50|$|Both East and West {{regarded}} Greece as {{a nation}} well within the sphere of influence of Britain. Stalin had respected his agreement with Winston Churchill to not intervene, but Yugoslavia and Albania defied the USSR's advice and sent supplies during the Greek Civil War to the partisan forces of the Communist Party of Greece, the ELAS (<b>National</b> <b>Popular</b> Liberation <b>Army).</b> The UK had given aid to the royalist Greek forces and ELAS leaders who, failing {{to realize that there}} would be no Soviet aid and having boycotted the elections, were at a disadvantaged position. However, by 1947, the near-bankrupt British government could no longer maintain its massive overseas commitments. In addition to granting independence to India and handing back the Palestinian Mandate to the United Nations, the British government decided to withdraw from both Greece and nearby Turkey. This would have left the two nations, in particular Greece, on the brink of a communist-led revolution.|$|R
5000|$|During {{the war he}} {{remained}} the internationally recognized head of state, backed by the exiled government and Greek forces serving in the Middle East. In occupied Greece, however, the leftist partisans of the National Liberation Front (EAM) and <b>National</b> <b>Popular</b> Liberation <b>Army</b> (ELAS), now unfettered by Metaxas' oppression, had become the largest Greek Resistance movement, enjoying considerable popular support. As liberation drew nearer, however, {{the prospect of the}} King's return caused dissensions both inside Greece and among the Greeks abroad. Although the King effectively renounced the Metaxas regime in a radio broadcast, a large section of the people and many politicians rejected his return on account of his support of the dictatorship. In November 1943 George wrote to the Prime Minister-in-exile Emmanouil Tsouderos, [...] "I shall examine anew the question of the date of my return to Greece in agreement with the Government". Either deliberately or accidentally, the version released for publication omitted the words [...] "of the date", creating the impression that George had agreed to a further plebiscite on the monarchy, even though a retraction was issued.|$|R

2500|$|Elections {{where the}} winning {{candidate}} loses the <b>national</b> <b>popular</b> vote typically result when the winner builds the requisite configuration of states (and thus captures their electoral votes) by small margins, but the losing candidate secures large voter margins {{in the remaining}} states. In this case, the very large margins secured by the losing candidate in the other states would aggregate to a plurality of the ballots cast nationally. However, commentators question the legitimacy of this <b>national</b> <b>popular</b> vote; {{pointing out that the}} <b>national</b> <b>popular</b> vote observed under the Electoral College system does not reflect the popular vote observed under a <b>National</b> <b>Popular</b> Vote system; as each electoral institution produces different incentives for, and strategy choices by, presidential campaigns. Because the <b>national</b> <b>popular</b> vote is irrelevant under the electoral college system, it is generally presumed candidates base their campaign strategies around the existence of the Electoral College; any close race has candidates campaigning to maximize electoral votes by focusing their get-out-the-vote efforts in crucially needed swing states and not attempting to maximize <b>national</b> <b>popular</b> vote totals by using limited campaign resources to run up margins or close up gaps in states considered [...] "safe" [...] for themselves or their opponents, respectively. Conversely, the institutional structure of a <b>national</b> <b>popular</b> vote system would encourage candidates to pursue voter turnout wherever votes could be found, even in [...] "safe" [...] states they are already expected to win, and in [...] "safe" [...] states they have no hope of winning.|$|R
