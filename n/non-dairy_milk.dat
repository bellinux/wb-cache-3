Other popular milks in the US are rice and coconut. In Europe soy and oat milk are popular. There is also hemp milk, cashew milk, hazelnut milk, and milk from peas and lupin.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Non-dairy</b> <b>milks</b> {{that are}} {{fortified}} with calcium, such as soymilk and almond milk can also contribute {{a significant amount}} of calcium in the diet. [...] The calcium found in broccoli, bok choy, and kale have also been found to have calcium that is well absorbed in the body. [...] Though the calcium content per serving is lower in these vegetables than a glass of milk, the absorption of the calcium into the body is higher. [...] Other [...] foods that contain calcium include calcium-set tofu, blackstrap molasses, turnip greens, mustard greens, soybeans, tempeh, almonds, okra, dried figs, and tahini. Though calcium can be found in Spinach, swiss chard, beans and beet greens, they are generally not considered to be a good source since the calcium binds to oxalic acid and is poorly absorbed into the body. [...] Phytic acid found in nuts, seeds, and beans may also impact calcium absorption rates. [...] See the National Institutes of Health Office of Dietary Supplements for calcium needs for various ages, the Vegetarian Resource Group and the Vegetarian Nutrition Calcium Fact Sheet from the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics [...] for more specifics on how to obtain adequate calcium intake on a vegetarian or vegan diet.|$|R
50|$|One French {{variation}} adds {{egg yolk}} for pommes duchesse or Duchess potatoes; piped through a pastry tube into wavy ribbons and rosettes, brushed {{with butter and}} lightly browned. Pomme purée (potato puree) uses considerably more butter than normal mashed potato - up to two parts potato for one part butter. In low-calorie or <b>non-dairy</b> variations, <b>milk,</b> cream and butter may be replaced by soup stock or broth. Aloo Bharta, an Indian sub-continent variation, uses chopped onions, mustard (oil, paste or seeds), chili pepper, coriander leaves and other spices.|$|R
50|$|The milk in bubble tea is optional, {{though many}} tea stores use it. Some cafés use a <b>non-dairy</b> creamer <b>milk</b> {{substitute}} instead of milk because many East Asians are lactose intolerant {{and because it}} is cheaper and easier to store and use than perishable milk. In Western countries, soy milk options are widely available for those who avoid dairy products. This adds a distinct flavor and consistency to the drink.Flavorings can be added to bubble tea. Some widely available fruit flavors include strawberry, green apple, passion fruit, mango, lemon, watermelon, grape, lychee, peach, pineapple, cantaloupe, honeydew, banana, avocado, coconut, kiwifruit, and jackfruit. Other popular non-fruit flavors include taro, pudding, chocolate, coffee, mocha, barley, sesame, almond, ginger, lavender, rose, caramel, violet, and Thai tea. Some of the sour fruit flavors are available in bubble tea without milk as the acidity tends to curdle the milk.|$|R
5000|$|Soy milk is {{possibly}} {{one of the}} most popular <b>non-dairy</b> <b>milk</b> products on the shelf. It is made from soybeans and it contains about the same amount of protein as dairy milk. Although it is claimed by some to contain twice as much sugar and saturated fats [...] however, when enriched by the manufacturer it may be a source of calcium and vitamin D and some B vitamins such as B12, however this is not in all brands of soy milk.|$|E

40|$|The {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} the issue of food consumption behavior in connection with vegan food preferences. This thesis characterizes the influence veganism has on purchasing behavior, captures the vegan food market growth, reviews the range of vegan food in Czech Republic (concretely the range of plant-based meat and meat products altenatives, <b>non-dairy</b> <b>milk</b> and milk products altenatives) and the retail supply. Survey research is used to detect basic consumer behavior aspects of vegans and non-vegans, to compare differences between these consumers and to identify their demand for specific vegan foods...|$|E
40|$|This {{information}} {{was presented at}} the 2017 Cornell Nutrition Conference for Feed Manufacturers, organized by the Department of Animal Science In the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences at Cornell University. Softcover copies of the entire conference proceedings may be purchased at [URL] cheese and yogurt products are made from sheep milk, with most originating from Europe. Due to limitations on imports, dairy sheep in the US are highly inbred and farmers milk them in one group lactation of 180 days or fewer per year. In October 2016, we began testing an innovative model for sheep milk and lamb production with <b>non-dairy</b> ewes <b>milked</b> in short, frequent lactations. The lambs have been raised on the cold-milk lambar system. In our fourth 73 -day lactation group, milk production per day is about {{the same as that of}} dairy sheep during early lactation. Health, fertility, and lamb survival have been excellent and we are finding surprising results about the best level of fiber in diets of lactating ewes...|$|R
50|$|Tully's uses {{standard}} hot cup sizes: 8 USfloz ml short, 12 USfloz ml tall, 16 USfloz ml grande, and 20 USfloz ml veinte. Until October 2009, iced drinks were 4 USfloz ml {{larger in}} order to accommodate the addition of ice to the drinks. All of its espresso drinks were made using organic and fair trade beans, but this was discontinued near the end of 2008. Tully's signature drink is the Bellaccino - similar to Starbucks's Frappuccino, it consists in a blend of <b>milk</b> (<b>non-dairy</b> options included), ice, and other base ingredients such as flavorings and sauces; it is usually topped with whipped cream.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{phenotypic}} and genotypic diversity of non-dairy L. lactis strains and their application to dairy fermentations. A bank of non-dairy lactococci were isolated from grass, vegetables and the bovine rumen. Subsequent {{analysis of these}} L. lactis strains revealed seven strains to possess cremoris genotypes which did not correlate with their observed phenotypes. Multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) and average nucleotide identity (ANI) highlighted the genetic diversity of lactis and cremoris subspecies. The application of these non-dairy lactococci to cheese production was also assessed. In <b>milk,</b> <b>non-dairy</b> strains formed diverse volatile profiles and selected strains were used as adjuncts in a mini Gouda-type cheese system. Sensory analysis showed non-dairy strains to be strongly associated {{with the development of}} off-flavours and bitterness. However, microfluidisation appeared to reduce bitterness. A novel bacteriophage, ɸL 47, was isolated using the grass isolate L. lactis ssp. cremoris DPC 6860 as a host. The phage, a member of the Siphoviridae, possessed a long tail fiber, previously unseen in dairy lactococcal phages. Genome sequencing revealed ɸL 47 to be the largest sequenced lactococcal phage to date and owing to the high % similarity with ɸ 949, a second member of the 949 group. Finally, to identify and characterise specific genes which may be important in niche adaptation and for applications to dairy fermentations, comparative genome sequence analysis was performed on L. lactis from corn (DPC 6853), the bovine rumen (DPC 6853) and grass (DPC 6860). This study highlights the contribution of niche specialisation to the intra-species diversity of L. lactis and the adaptation of this organism to different environments. In summary this thesis describes the genetic diversity of L. lactis strains from outside the dairy environment and their potential application in dairy fermentations...|$|R
40|$|Functional {{advantages}} of probiotics combined with interesting composition of oat were considered {{as an alternative}} to dairy products. In this study, fermentation of oat milk with Lactobacillus reuteri and Streptococcus thermophilus was analysed to develop a new probiotic product. Central composite design with response surface methodology was used to analyse the effect of different factors (glucose, fructose, inulin and starters) on the probiotic population in the product. Optimised formulation was characterised throughout storage time at 4 [*]℃ in terms of pH, acidity, β-glucan and oligosaccharides contents, colour and rheological behaviour. All formulations studied were adequate to produce fermented foods and minimum dose of each factor was considered as optimum. The selected formulation allowed starters survival above 107 /cfu ml to be considered as a functional food and was maintained during the 28 days controlled. β-glucans remained in the final product with a positive effect on viscosity. Therefore, a new probiotic <b>non-dairy</b> <b>milk</b> was successfully developed in which high probiotic survivals were assured throughout the typical yoghurt-like shelf life...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} obtain milk like {{products}} from oats, an industrial process to manufacture a palatable, liquefied oat base has been developed (Lindahl et al 1994). This oat base per se has shown to be appreciated as a <b>non-dairy</b> <b>milk</b> alternative in the health market (Anon, 1999). It {{has also been shown}} {{that it is possible to}} obtain fermented oat milk with texture properties resembling that of traditional yoghurt (Mårtensson et al 2001). In this study we have investigated the effects of fermented oat-based products containing both native and microbial -glucans, on plasma lipids and on faecal total bacterial count and Bifidobacterium ssp. Sixty-two volunteers (free-living subjects) with moderately increased plasma cholesterol levels were recruited. One of the oat products (ropy) was co-fermented with an exopolysaccharide (EPS) -producing strain, Pediococcus damnosus 2. 6. A significant (p= 0. 022) reduction in total cholesterol by 6 % was observed in volunteers who had eaten the fermented, ropy oat-based product compared to the control group. A significant increase of total bacterial count (p= 0. 001) and Bifidobacterium ssp. (p= 0. 012) was observed in faecal samples from volunteers in the group who had eaten the fermented, ropy oat-based product. This study shows that a fermented, ropy oat-based product, containing both native and microbial glucans can reduce the cholesterol level and also stimulate the bifidobacteria flora in the gastrointestinal tract.

40|$|Thesis (Master) [...] İzmir Institute of Technology, Food Engineering, İzmir, 2011 Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves: 89 - 101) Text in English; Abstract: Turkish and Englishxii, 119 leavesDuring {{recent years}} <b>non-dairy</b> <b>milk</b> types such as cereal and grain milks {{have been an}} increased demand from consumers due to their functional properties. The cereal and grain milks do not contain cholesterol or lactose; therefore, these milk types are preferred by consumers who are vegetarians, have special diets or are lactose intolerant. In this study, different concentrations of oat milk (0, 15, 30, 45, and 60 %), blueberry aroma(9, 12, 15, 18, and 21 %), and kefir culture(1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 %) {{were used for the}} optimization of the kefir production and samples were stored at 4 C for 21 days. The response surface methodology was used for the optimization process. Sensory characteristics, the pH changes and microbial characteristics of the kefir samples were determined during storage and the concentrations of the oat milk, blueberry aroma and kefir culture for the best three kefir products were chosen based on the optimization results According to optimization results, three kefir samples which contained the highest level of oat milk with optimum organoleptic characteristics, optimum pH and optimum microbial counts were selected and produced. Based on the organoleptic results, kefir samples composed of 20 % oat milk, 4 % kefir culture and 10 % aroma concentration, were produced. According to the pH results kefir samples within 15 % oat milk, 4 % kefir culture and 9 % aroma concentration were produced. Based on the microbiological results kefir samples within 30 % oat milk, 3 % kefir culture and 15 % aroma concentration were produced. The pH, titratable acidity, dry matter, fat, protein, phenol content, beta-glucan content, whey off, viscosity, volatile and organic acid profile of samples, color change, microbiological characteristics and sensory characteristics of these samples were investigated during 21 days of storage...|$|E
