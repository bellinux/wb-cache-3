Traditionally, it is considered an affront and not an honor to have a newborn named after an older relative, so that full names are rarely passed down through a family {{in the manner of}} American English Seniors, Juniors, III, etc. Similarly, it is considered disadvantageous for the child to bear a name already made famous by someone else, although Romanizations might be identical or a common <b>name</b> <b>like</b> Liu Xiang might be borne by tens of thousands.|$|E

The first one is a {{complete}} ring around the centre point. The five figures (Abraham, Echnaton, Jesus, Buddha and Lao Tse) around the centre point are symbolizing different culture of the world. They made the ideas and became founder of main religions of the world.

They are Hamurabi, Justinianus and Shotoku Taishi.|$|E
25|$|Randall, as {{a modern}} given name, is {{regarded}} as being mainly an American name. In Scotland, the name Randal {{has been associated with}} Lord Randal, an Anglo-Scottish border ballad, published by American Francis James Child in 1882 (see Child Ballads). In parts of Ireland in the 19th and early 20th century, the name Randal has been noted being used particularly by families of the surname MacDonnell (the surname was/is spelt variously). There are several notable Irish families, historically unrelated to each other, who bear (forms of) this surname. The chiefly line of one such family relocated to the Glens of Antrim from Scotland in the 16th and 17th centuries, and Randal appears numerous times in their pedigree; this family descends from members of the Scottish Clan Donald; and even today, various Anglicised forms of the Gaelic Raghnall are commonly used by members of this clan. Randal was noted in the early 20th century as being common within the O'Donovan family as well; their <b>name,</b> <b>like</b> that of Clan Donald, originated as an Anglicised form of the etymologically unrelated Raghnall.|$|E

500|$|... "Did I Stutter?" [...] {{was written}} by Justin Spitzer and Brent Forrester. Although the two writers {{initially}} planned to write separate episodes, the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike forced the two to share an episode. Forrester and Spitzer initially disagreed about what the episode's title should be. Forrester wanted to name it [...] "Did I Stutter?"—a phrase popularized by Judd Nelson's character Bender in the 1985 film The Breakfast Club—while Spitzer wanted a <b>name</b> <b>like</b> [...] "The Reprimand" [...] or [...] "Insubordination".

500|$|The {{idea for}} the genetic {{engineering}} story was developed {{with the help of}} the series' science adviser, Anne Simon. Carter visited a friend of Simon, a scientist at Indiana University in Bloomington, who had been able to genetically manipulate flies so that they grew legs from their eyes. After Carter had created the character of The Great Mutato, he discovered that cartoonist Matt Groening had already created a character with the same name—although with different pronunciation—for a comic book entry of The Simpsons. Carter contacted Groening, who gave Carter permission to use the <b>name.</b> <b>Like</b> two-thirds of the episodes of the series, [...] "The Post-Modern Prometheus" [...] is a [...] "Monster-of-the-Week" [...] episode, a stand-alone plot which is unconnected to the overarching mythology of The X-Files.|$|E

Ibrăileanu, who criticized Caragiale for his satirical overview of the social process, believed that the clerks in his work are unnecessarily cynical, and stressed that Inspecţiune was the only one of his works were [...] "one sees at least one glitter of kindness in the souls of the mitici".|$|E
500|$|Gaara's backstory {{became one}} of Kishimoto's {{favorite}} stories from Part I; Kishimoto had to revise his illustrations in such chapters as he wanted readers to understand more of Gaara's mental state. The character was originally {{going to be called}} Kotarou Fuuma, but Kishimoto's editor highly refused to give him that name. As a result, he was given the name Gaara why he felt more suitable to the fact he always uses sand. By 2013, Kishimoto stated he still did not understand why such name was discarded. Nevertheless, he refrained from giving him of giving him a complete <b>name</b> <b>like</b> Gaara Yuzawa. Another early name was a younger child named [...] "Kumomaru" [...] but was avoided by Kishimoto. However, after multiple changes, he became Gaara. Due to his importance in the manga as a result of being Naruto's foil, Kishimoto added the kanji for [...] "love" [...] in his head to complement his name (part of Gaara's name can be read as [...] "love").|$|E
