Nutrients of livestock waste and <b>natural</b> <b>and</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>fertilizers</b> are laden with phosphorus and nitrogen. These elements upset the natural balance of the lake and increase the growth of blue-green algae. The algae is a cyanobacterium, with Planktothrix being a particularly prevalent and problematic species. The bacteria produce toxic peptides that can be harmful to plants and animals. Humans are also affected by the toxins. Microcystin can harm the liver and cause other health problems including mild rashes and sneezing and even severe gastrointestinal ailments. Agriculture runoff is not the only source of pollution in the lake. Industrial and commercial drainage contribute to the problem as does drainage from out of date septic tanks and municipal sewage systems.|$|E

40|$|The general {{objective}} of this thesis was to study the interactions between AM fungi and turfgrass species {{in the presence of}} natural or chemical fertilizers. We had hypothesized that this symbiosis is possible, functional and compatible in the presence of fertilizers. To test this hypothesis, we have set three objectives: (i) estimate colonization rate for three AM fungi: Glomus intraradices, G. mosseae and G. aggregatum on two turfgrass species Poa pratensis L. cv Park and Agrostis stolonifera L. cv Penncross; (ii) evaluate the compatibility between <b>natural</b> <b>and</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>fertilizers</b> and AM fungi, and (iii) compare the effects of AM colonization on different physiological parameters in turfgrass. This study was performed over a period of 17 months between June 1996 and October 1997 on two different sites, Clarence Creek and the Central Experimental Farm (Ottawa), respectively low (46 ppm) and high (270 ppm) in soil phosphorus status. In total, 96 plots were randomly distributed on each sites. To investigate the dynamic of turfgrass community, we performed a greenhouse experiment following the same experimental design as in the field. (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|E

Increased {{concentrations of}} nitrate in drinking water is a serious hazard to human health, causing abnormalities such as cancerous growth in human digestion system, while excessive nitrate intake via drinking water can cause methemoglobinemia in infants. Furthermore, the presence of nitrate in aquifers can stimulate eutrophication, which compromise the growth of algae and depletion of dissolved oxygen. <b>Natural</b> <b>and</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>fertilizers</b> in crop production, detergent manufacturing, uncontrolled land discharge of municipal wastewater, and industrial wastes have been identified as the main sources of nitrate in water sources. Nitrate is a stable, highly soluble ion that is difficult to remove by conventional water treatment methods such as coagulation and flocculation. The ion exchange is the most widely used procedure for removing nitrate from water. In this research the possibility of removing nitrate from water was examined by using commercial ion exchangers: Duolite A 7 and Relite A 490, respectively. The influence of the initial concentration of nitrate (10, 50 and 100 mg/l), the contact time (15 - 1440 min) and the mass of the ion exchanger (0. 1 to 0. 6 g) was also examined...|$|E
