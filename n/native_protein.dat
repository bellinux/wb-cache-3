25|$|Acetylcholine {{receptor}} is a receptor {{linked to}} a cation channel. The protein consists of 4 subunits: α, β, γ, and δ subunits. There are two α subunits, with one acetylcholine binding site each. This receptor can exist in three conformations. The closed and unoccupied state is the <b>native</b> <b>protein</b> conformation. As two molecules of acetylcholine both bind to the binding sites on α subunits, the conformation of the receptor is altered and the gate is opened, allowing for the entry of many ions and small molecules. However, this open and occupied state only lasts for a minor duration and then the gate is closed, becoming the closed and occupied state. The two molecules of acetylcholine will soon dissociate from the receptor, returning it to the native closed and unoccupied state.|$|E

40|$|Overproduction of {{proteins}} from cloned genes using fusion protein expression vectors in Escherichia coli and eukaryotic cells {{has increased the}} quantity of protein produced. This approach has been widely used in producing soluble recombinant proteins for structural and functional analysis. One major disadvantage, however, of applying this approach for clinical or bioindustrial uses is that proteolytic removal of the fusion carrier is tedious, expensive, and often results in products with additional amino acid residues than the <b>native</b> <b>proteins.</b> Here we describe a new method for productions of <b>native</b> <b>proteins</b> with original amino termini in vivo via intracellular self-cleavage of the fusion protein using tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease. Our design allows one to simultaneously clone any gene into multiple fusion protein vectors using two unique cloning sites (i. e., SnaBI and XhoI) without restriction digestion, and then rapidly identifies those constructs producing soluble <b>native</b> <b>proteins.</b> This method will make the fusion protein approach more feasible for protein drug research...|$|R

50|$|Investigators {{should also}} {{consider}} the status of nativity of protein antigens when used as immunogens and reaction with antibodies produced. Antibodies to native proteins react best with native proteins and antibodies to denatured proteins react best with denatured proteins. If elicited antibodies are to be used on membrane blots (proteins subjected to denaturing conditions) then antibodies should be made against denatured proteins. On the other hand, if antibodies are {{to be used to}} react with a <b>native</b> <b>protein</b> or block a protein active site, then antibodies should be made against the <b>native</b> <b>protein.</b> Adjuvants can often alter the nativity of the protein. Generally, absorbed protein antigens in a preformed oil-in-water emulsion adjuvant, retain greater <b>native</b> <b>protein</b> structure than those in water-in-oil emulsions.|$|E

50|$|Prions are an {{exception}} to Anfinsen's dogma. Prions are stable conformations of proteins which differ from the native folding state.

40|$|A small {{globular}} protein, {{the third}} {{repeat of the}} c-Myb DNA-binding domain, which is composed of 54 amino acid residues, was engineered so as to understand the structural uniqueness of <b>native</b> <b>proteins.</b> This small protein has three α-helices that form a helix-turn-helix structure, which is maintained by the hydrophobic core with three Ile residues. One of the mutant proteins, {{with two of the}} buried Ile (Ile- 155 and Ile- 181) substituted with Leu residues, showed multiple conformations, as monitored by heteronuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy for 13 C- and 15 N-labeled proteins. The increase in the side-chain conformational entropy, caused by changing the Ile to a Leu residue on an α-helix, could engender the lack of structural uniqueness. In <b>native</b> <b>proteins,</b> the conformations of not only the β-branched side chains, but also those of the neighboring bulky side chains, can be greatly restricted, depending upon the local backbone structure...|$|R

40|$|Nanoparticles {{displaying}} <b>native</b> <b>proteins</b> {{are attractive}} for many applications, including vaccinology. Virus-based nanoparticles are easily tailored by genetic means, commonly by inserting heterologous sequences into surface-exposed loops. The strategy {{works well with}} short peptides but is incompatible with the structures of most <b>native</b> <b>proteins,</b> except those with closely juxtaposed termini. Here we overcome this constraint by splitting the capsid protein of hepatitis B virus, {{one of the most}} advanced and most immunogenic display platforms, inside the insertion loop (SplitCore). The split parts, coreN and coreC, efficiently form capsid-like particles (CLPs) in E. coli and so do numerous fusions to coreN and/or coreC of differently structured proteins, including human disease related antigens of > 300 amino acids in length. These CLPs induced high-titer antibodies, including neutralizing ones, in mice. The concept was easily expanded to triple-layer CLPs carrying reporter plus targeting domains, and should be applicable to protein-based nanoparticle design in general...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Lambda coli phage is not inactivated by chymotrypsin, trypsin, or ficin. T 2 phage {{is slowly}} inactivated by high {{concentrations}} of a-,-, y-, or A-chymotrypsin, but not by trypsin or ficin. PI phage is slowly inactivated by a-,-, or y-chymotrypsin, or ficin, more rapidly by A-chymotrypsin, and much more rapidly by trypsin. Crystalline egg albumin, crystalline serum albumin, E. coli nucleoprotein, and yeast nucleoprotein are hydrolyzed slowly by a-chymotrypsin. Yeast nucleoprotein, like P phage, is hydrolyzed more rapidly by A-chymotrypsin than by a-chymotrypsin, but not by trypsin or ficin.

40|$|The {{presence}} of β-sheets {{in the core}} of amyloid fibrils raised questions {{as to whether or not}} β-sheet-containing proteins, such as transthyretin, are predisposed to form such fibrils. However, we show here that the molecular structure of amyloid fibrils differs more generally from the β-sheets in <b>native</b> <b>proteins.</b> This difference is evident from the amide I region of the infrared spectrum and relates to the distribution of the φ/ψ dihedral angles within the Ramachandran plot, the average number of strands per sheet, and possibly, the β-sheet twist. These data imply that amyloid fibril formation from <b>native</b> β-sheet <b>proteins</b> can involve a substantial structural reorganization...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT We {{extend our}} {{coarse-grained}} modeling strategy described in parts I and II {{of this investigation}} to account for nonuniform spatial distributions of hydrophobic residues on the solvent-exposed surfaces of <b>native</b> <b>proteins.</b> Within this frame-work, we explore how patchy surfaces can influence the solvent-mediated protein-protein interactions, and the unfolding and self-assembly behaviors of proteins in solution. In particular, we compare the equilibrium unfolding and self-assembly trends for three model proteins that share the same overall sequence hydrophobicity, but exhibit folded configurationswith different solvent-exposed native-state surface morphologies. Our model provides new insights into how directional interactions can affect native-state protein stability in solution. We find that strongly-directional attractions between native molecules with patchy surfaces can help stabilize the folded conformation through the formation of self-assembled clusters. In contrast, <b>native</b> <b>proteins</b> with more uniform surfaces are destabilized by protein-protein attractions involving the denatured state. Finally, we discuss how the simulation results provide insights into the experimental solution behaviors of several proteins that display directional interactions in their native states...|$|R
40|$|Here, {{we report}} a novel method {{consisting}} of capillary electrophoretic separation followed by two-color LIF detection with postcolumn derivatization. The method {{can be used}} to discriminate glycoproteins in a protein mixture containing both glycosylated and unglycosylated proteins.

So, a protein can be assigned as glycosylated if it shows a peak at the same migration time in both electropherograms. According to the proposed principle, in a single run we discriminated a glycosylated protein (thyroglobulin) from an unglycosylated protein (albumin) in the presence of rhodamine-labeled Con A. Because the methodology permits the simultaneous detection of <b>native</b> <b>proteins</b> and their complexes with a fluorescently labeled probe, it should have broad applicability to binding assays...|$|R
