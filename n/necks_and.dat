40|$|Isolates of {{the rice}} blast fungus show {{a range of}} tissue-specificities infecting leaves, nodes, <b>neck</b> <b>and</b> panicles. Although <b>neck</b> <b>and</b> panicle blast cause {{significantly}} greater yield losses than the leaf blast, virulence tests of the blast isolates have been performed only rice leaves instead of <b>neck</b> <b>and</b> panicles. In this study, we have developed a virulence test method for <b>neck</b> <b>and</b> panicle blast. We selected three representative isolates from each of leaf, <b>neck,</b> <b>and</b> panicle blast. We observed that severe disease lesions developed on the <b>neck</b> <b>and</b> the panicles when the infected rice plants were incubated in a dew chamber for 48 h instead of 24 h when tested on leaves. Unlike the leaf blast, a typical lesion on the <b>neck</b> <b>and</b> panicles appeared after 14 days post-infection as opposed to 7 days with leaf blast. This method will be applied to examine tissue-specificity of the rice blast fungus isolates...|$|R

40|$|Objectives The study {{examined}} the course of <b>neck</b> <b>and</b> shoulder pain among a cohort of technical school students entering working life. We also aimed to identify work-related and individual risk factors for <b>neck</b> <b>and</b> shoulder pain during this transition period. Methods The study {{was designed as a}} prospective cohort study following 420 technical school students (167 student hairdressers, 118 student electricians, and 135 media/design students) from school, through their apprenticeship and into working life. Every 4 th month over a 6. 5 year period (2002 – 2009), the participant`s <b>neck</b> <b>and</b> shoulder pain for the preceding four weeks was assessed. Mechanical and psychosocial workplace factors as well as individual factors were evaluated at baseline and/or during the follow-up period. Data were analyzed by generalized estimating equations (GEE). Results We found a significant increase in <b>neck</b> <b>and</b> shoulder pain over time in the transition from technical school to working life. High mechanical workload was associated with <b>neck</b> <b>and</b> shoulder pain among women, while a high level of shoulder muscle endurance capacity was associated with lower rates of <b>neck</b> <b>and</b> shoulder pain among men. Perceived muscle tension and ethnicity were the most consistent predictors for <b>neck</b> <b>and</b> shoulder pain, found among both women and men. Conclusion Increased <b>neck</b> <b>and</b> shoulder pain was found in the transition from technical school to working life, and both work-related and individual factors were associated with pain development.

The patient experienced nonunion of the femoral <b>neck</b> <b>and</b> shaft after the initial operation and therefore underwent reconstruction using a femoral head prosthesis with a long stem and interlocking screws.

50|$|The head is {{supported}} by the lower <b>neck</b> <b>and</b> upper back, and it is these areas that commonly cause neck pain. The top three joints in the neck allow for most movement of the <b>neck</b> <b>and</b> head. The lower joints in the <b>neck</b> <b>and</b> those of the upper back create a supportive structure for the head to sit on. If this support system is affected adversely, then the muscles in the area will tighten, leading to neck pain.|$|R
