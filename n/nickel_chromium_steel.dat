40|$|A {{model is}} {{presented}} which describes {{the effect of}} mechanical and materials parameters on the wear-assisted corro-sion rate of passive metals under sliding wear conditions. The model {{is based on a}} consideration of contact between the sliding surfaces at multiple asperities and it takes into account the passivation behavior of the metal. Wear experiments were carried out in a reciprocating pin-on-plate tribometer permitting the control of mechanical and electrochemical con-ditions. An alumina pin was rubbed on <b>nickel,</b> <b>chromium,</b> stainless <b>steel,</b> and titanium alloy plates, in sulfuric acid or sodium sulfate solution. The relative importance of mechanical and electrochemical metal removal was evaluated while applying an anodic potential. Additional experiments were performed under cathodic polarization. The results show that the proposed model can describe correctly the effect on dissolution rate of different mechanical parameters such as applied normal force, stroke length, frequency, and sliding speed. Qualitative agreement was observed with the predict-ed effect of the materials parameters hardness and passivation charge, but uncertainties concerning the real value of pas-sivation charge and, in some cases, wear of the alumina pin limit the predictive capability of the model when comparing different materials.

The systems studied are steel plated with <b>nickel</b> and <b>chromium,</b> <b>steel</b> coated with sprayed aluminium and steel given dip coating with aluminium and tin-M. S. The study consisted in: a) 	Measurement of galvanic current and potential flowing between the substrate and the coating metals by using zero resistance ammeter method and VTVM. b) 	Potential decay when the current is cut off These were done in several corrosive electrolytes. The most significant results obtained are given below: a) 	In the Fe-Ni-Cr system the presence of nickel undercoat is necessary to eliminate the large galvanic current that flow between iron and chromium unlike the small current flow between <b>nickel</b> and <b>chromium.</b> b) 	At pores in zinc-aluminium coated steel, steel behaves like hydrogen electrode as long as the pore diameter is small. This has been explained due to the well-known propensity of steels to be charged with hydrogen. c) 	Sprayed aluminium gives more negative potential than steel in organic acids and can be considered as substitute for tin coating. The results are published. A Comprehensive investigation into the mechanism of protection by primers so as to get insight into the scientific basis for the formulation of new and better primers. The whole range of chromate primers, red lead red oxide primers with different ratios, primers using CNSL and other resins were all taken up for study.

These investigations lead to the following new results: a) 	The solubility of pigment in aqueous medium differs with nature of the vehicle employed. b) 	Extenders can modify the amount of pigment extracted in aqueous solutions. c) 	The inhibitive character of primers can be attributed to different reasons such as solubility of the pigment, formation of inhibitive soaps, formation of surface complex between the vehicle and metal surface. ...|$|R
