25|$|During 1981 and 1982, Webb {{recorded}} {{her next}} album, I'm <b>Not</b> <b>That</b> <b>Kind</b> <b>of</b> Girl, which was eventually released in 1983. Although {{not based on}} a musical, the album had a running story concerning {{a woman who is}} reunited with a former lover. The album culminates with her on the way to their wedding. The songs were composed by David Hentschel and Don Black and were very much in a contemporary pop vein. Phil Collins played drums on the album and Kiki Dee contributed backing vocals. Despite the album's strong pedigree in terms of personnel, it failed to chart and was Webb's final album on the Polydor label.|$|E

The painting was then superimposed on {{a copy of a}} mass-produced religious poster. Hendrix stated that the cover, which Track spent $5,000 producing, would have been more appropriate had it highlighted his American Indian heritage. He commented: [...] "You got it wrong... I'm <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> Indian." [...] Track released the album in the UK on December 1, 1967, where it peaked at number five, spending 16 weeks on the charts. In February 1968, Axis: Bold as Love reached number three in the U.S.|$|E

[...] Unlike other UMNO politicians, Ismail avoided cultivating a political following: [...] "He was there to build the country. That's it. He was actually a reluctant politician. So he wasn't a politician {{in the sense that}} he didn't cultivate 'my people'. He didn't care whether he made friends or <b>not.</b> <b>That</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> person wasn't very popular".|$|E
2500|$|To {{prepare for}} the role in The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles, Lloyd Owen {{prepared}} by watching numerous Connery films and studied his accent. Owen shared the character's love of medieval history, having studied Geoffrey Chaucer's The Knight's Tale. Owen considered the character [...] "a good father. I think that's obvious by the way Indy has turned out. He even said in the film that he's {{not the kind of}} father that says, 'Eat your food, go to bed, brush your teeth!' He's <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> guy at all. He's a very liberal parent for the 1900s." ...|$|E

2500|$|When {{warned of}} {{potential}} domination by a Stalin dictatorship over part of Europe, Roosevelt {{responded with a}} statement summarizing his rationale for relations with Stalin: [...] "I just have a hunch that Stalin is <b>not</b> <b>that</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> a man[...] [...] [...] I think that if I give him everything I possibly can and ask for nothing from him in return, noblesse oblige, he won't try to annex anything and will work {{with me for a}} world of democracy and peace." [...] While meeting with Stalin and Roosevelt in Tehran in 1943, Churchill stated that Britain was vitally interested in restoring Poland as an independent country. Britain did not press the matter for fear that it would become a source of inter-allied friction.|$|E

[...] During a grand jury investigation in 1976, Felt was called to testify and the prosecutor, Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights J. Stanley Pottinger, discovered that Felt was [...] "Deep Throat", but the secrecy of the proceedings preserved the secrecy of Felt's alter ego from the public.|$|E
