40|$|Aggravation of {{risk and}} failure to take precautionary {{measures}} are focal issues in non-life insurance in terms of potential partial or full release of the insurer from the duty to perform. Not infrequently, {{it is difficult to}} draw a line between the aggravation of risk on the one hand, and <b>non-compliance</b> with precautionary <b>measures</b> on the other, since a particular action by a policyholder may present both situations. At the same time, the legal remedies available to the insurer regarding these two situations are different in scope. The aggravation {{of risk and}} <b>non-compliance</b> with precautionary <b>measures</b> are precisely the bases on which insurers actually reduce indemnity or refuse to compensate for damages. This article explores the differences between insurance laws in the Baltic states—specifically, the Estonian Law of Obligations Act, the Latvian Insurance Contract Law and Lithuanian rules contained in the Civil Code and Insurance Law. The article explores the differences between the Baltic states’ insurance laws and the Principles of European Insurance Contract Law (PEICL) with regard to a policyholder’s duty in relation to aggravation of risk and precautionary measures, as the rights and obligations of policyholders do change where the optional instrument is applied.

The aims of this study were: first, to assess symptom experience in clinically stable adult patients during long-term follow-up after liver transplantation; and second, to study the relationship between symptom experience and medication non-compliance. This cross-sectional study included 123 liver transplant patients. Symptom experience was assessed using the "Modified Transplant Symptom Occurrence and Symptom Distress Scale" (29 -item version) at the annual evaluation. According to the duration of follow-up, patients were divided into a short-term (1 - 4 yr) and a long-term (5 - 18 yr) cohort. Medication <b>non-compliance</b> was <b>measured</b> using electronic monitoring. Results showed that increased hair growth was the most frequent symptom in both sexes. Symptom distress was more serious in women than in men. The most distressing symptom in women was excessive and/or painful periods, while in men this was impotence. Clear differences were revealed at item level between symptom occurrence and symptom distress in relationship with the two time cohorts and between sexes.

40|$|In its {{recently}} completed review of Commonwealth fisheries policy the Australian Government, following submissions from the commercial fishing industry, agreed {{to examine the}} implications of replacing the power in the Fisheries Management Act 1991 (FM Act) to cancel fishing concessions for <b>non-compliance</b> with management <b>measures</b> that increased financial penalties. Industry argued that the cancellation provisions undermine the security of access rights and the Australian Government had accepted that the current provisions may be an impediment to investment in Commonwealth-managed fisheries. This paper reviews these concerns in light of property rights and compliance issues and concludes {{that there are no}} compelling reasons for removing cancellation provisions from the FM Act. On the contrary, these provisions provide a powerful deterrent to non-compliance, which is unlikely to be matched by financial penalties alone. Nevertheless, it is suggested that a review of the way fisheries offences are dealt with under the Act is undertaken and that the level of current financial penalties be reviewed.

30|$|Most {{existing}} papers <b>measuring</b> <b>non-compliance</b> to minimum wages (either statutory or occupation/sectoral minimum wages) {{focus on}} developing countries. Rani et al.

40|$|The {{current study}} {{utilized}} the Atlantic Blue Cross Prescription Drug Database to examine patient: refill compliance to antidepressants from the tricyclic and selective-serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRII classes. The primary {{goals of the}} study were to describe and compare compliance between the tricyclic and SSRI users, to ascertain whether patient age and gender, treatment cost, and regimen complexity were predictors of non-compliance, and to evaluate the problems involved with utilizing the Atlantic Blue Cross Database for compliance research. [...] <b>Non-compliance</b> was <b>measured</b> by using three outcome measures. First the percentage of non-compliant days (defined as the percentage of days during treatment without medication) was found. Second, the early medication 'stoppers' were compared to the medication 'continuers'. Finally, the time course of non-compliance was studied by finding the time till the first non-compliant gap for users. [...] Results showed that the mean percentage of noncompliant days was 8. 4 % (95 % CI; 7. 9 - 8. 9) for the tricyclic and SSRI users who filled more than one prescription. In addition, between 8. 1 - 11. 4 % of users stopped the antidepressant medication early. Survival analysis suggested that the greatest drop in the cumulative probability of having a non-compliant gap occurred early in treatment for both classes. No differences were found in the comparisons of the tricyclics and the SSRI's in terms of non-compliance. The predictor variable age was weakly associated with noncompliance; as age increased, non-compliance decreased. In addition, regimen complexity as measured by the number of concurrent medications and the number at doses per day was also weakly associated with non-compliance. More specifically, as the number of concurrent medications increased, compliance increased and as the number of doses per day increased, compliance decreased. [...] A number of problems were identified with the Blue Cross Database. In a number of cases, data was missing. Data contamination problems were identified that were probably the result of data entry errors. Cleaning protocols were developed to deal with some of these problems. A number of other problems were also identified which were inherent to the database. For example, {{there was a lack of}} documentation concerning dates of entry and exit to the Blue Cross Program...|$|R
40|$|No-take marine {{reserves}} are increasingly popular tools for conservation and fisheries management. While much {{attention has been}} paid to evaluating the effects of design aspects (size, location, etc.) in achieving reserve objectives, less emphasis has been placed on the role of stakeholder compliance. Therefore, the first aim of this study was to evaluate the state of compliance literature and examine the methods used to measure compliance in reserves. The state of compliance literature is limited, although publications with compliance information have increased sixfold in the last decade. However, most studies containing compliance information (63 %) fail to provide quantitative estimates. Furthermore, most (95 %) quantitative estimates of compliance were reported using a single method, which is problematic because each method has biases and limited applicability. Methods used to indicate compliance include (i) direct observation; (ii) indirect observation; (iii) law enforcement records; (iv) direct questioning; (v) expert opinion; and (vi) modelling. Our second aim was to empirically demonstrate the critical role of compliance in reserve outcomes by comparing a mixed-effects model on compliance data synthesized from 63 marine reserves to that of a null model. The model of best fit demonstrated a negative relationship between non-compliance and target species biomass response ratios. Thus, without incorporating any aspects of reserve design, compliance data predicted reserve response ratios of fish biomass. Accordingly, researchers should explore ways to better understand and <b>measure</b> <b>non-compliance.</b> Therefore, future research should triangulate multiple sources of quantitative compliance data collected using standardized techniques and conduct baseline surveys before reserve implementation...|$|R

This study describes the practices associated with raising and slaughtering household poultry to identify {{risk factors for}} H 5 N 1 infection and reasons for <b>non-compliance</b> with preventive <b>measures.</b> |An investigation was conducted of 56 households with household flocks (19 households with human H 5 N 1 cases, 19 with poultry H 5 N 1 cases, and 18 with no reported poultry or human H 5 N 1 cases). Data were collected via structured observations and in-depth interviews. |Half of the households kept at least some free-range poultry and mixed at least some different species of poultry as it was considered beneficial for the poultry. Feeding and cleaning practices exposed children to contact with poultry; slaughtering contaminated homes; use of personal protective barriers was not a norm; waste management exposed the communities to slaughtering waste and dead chickens; and reporting of sick and dead poultry was not a practice. Only minor changes in poultry-handling took place following H 5 N 1 virus outbreaks. |H 5 N 1 virus prevention in Egypt represents both an epidemiological and socio-cultural challenge. Traditional poultry-rearing practices that likely increase exposures to H 5 N 1 -infected poultry are common throughout Egypt. Despite education campaigns following sporadic H 5 N 1 outbreaks, no differences in these practices could be detected between households with previous H 5 N 1 human or poultry cases and those households with any previous experience with H 5 N 1. Development of H 5 N 1 infection-related education campaign strategies should focus on perceptions underlying traditional practices in order to tailor public awareness messages that are meaningful for communities. 23145955 PMC 463426...|$|R
40|$|Quoting James Andreoni, `the {{problem of}} tax {{compliance}} {{is as old}} as taxes themselves'. The sources of missing tax revenues have traditionally concerned tax administrations and particularly now in times when public finances are striving. In the quest for analysing the revenue that is foregone, tax administrations have started to produce a report of their tax gap, understood as the difference between the theoretical tax liability and the actual collection, to obtain a measure of the extent of non-compliance. Due to the complexity of the non-compliance behaviour and the lack of visibility of certain types of income, different methods are usually put in place in order to offer a plausible range for the estimates. This dissertation dedicates its two first chapters to providing an alternative method for estimating the income-gap (de fined to be one minus the proportion of reported to actual income) for two populations: the self-employed and the employees. The underlying data used for both cases is publicly available survey data on expenditures and income that is generated on a timely manner. This carries substantial advantages. First, relying on a general purpose survey dataset means that the estimation can be updated more frequently than if it was to rely solely on either the timing of administrative data or on survey data that is speci fically targeted to <b>measure</b> <b>non-compliance.</b> Second, it provides an alternative estimation using an independent source of data which allows for the triangulation of the estimate obtained using administrative sources. Third, it allows tax administrations which do not have readily available administrative data to perform estimations using a type of survey widespread available in most countries. The third chapter of this thesis explores the role of the extrinsic and intrinsic incentives in explaining engagement in the hidden economy defined as undeclared work practices. This chapter contributes firstly to the literature on shadow economy and to the debate of whether crowding effects are found between extrinsic and intrinsic motivations in a tax environment.

40|$|Anyone who {{proves that}} he or she is in a {{situation}} of danger and who is a potential victim of a violation of a right set forth in the American or the European Convention on Human Rights may be protected by interim measures. Interim measures in the human rights systems may be defined as an instrument, the purpose of which is to prevent irreparable harm to persons who are in a situation of extreme gravity and urgency, which a favourable final judgment would therefore not be able to undo. They result in protection offered by the State in compliance with the legally binding order of the Inter-American or European Court on Human Rights. While this legal figure is nowadays applied more and more frequently and in most cases the American and European countries have complied with the order of their respective Court of Human Rights, the question that this contribution would like to answer is what the legal consequences of incompliance are and whether the difference as to the legal basis of the interim measures in both human rights systems has influenced the legal effect that the respective Courts have given to <b>non-compliance</b> with the <b>measures.</b> After an overview of the case-law, it will be shown that in fact each regional system has given different legal consequences to the incompliance with its interim measures, but paradoxically, the effects are not directly related to the type of legal instrument in which the interim measures are contemplated. The issue is relevant because on the one hand interim measures are mostly adopted in dramatic contexts where the life and personal integrity of human beings are endangered and because a survey of the case-law shows that under the European system the cases of incompliance seem to be on the rise, and on the other hand, because it appears that under the Inter-American system there are many cases in which provisional measures have been issued which will be decided soon on the merits, and therefore during the examination of which it will be decided whether the member States have complied or not with the Inter-American Court’s interim measures and what consequences incompliance entails...|$|R
40|$|The lack of {{compliance}} amongst employers with minimum wage legislation {{is a problem}} faced by many developing countries. South Africa is no exception, informal evidence suggesting that {{a large proportion of}} the employed in the country earn wages below the stipulated minima. This dissertation attempts to <b>measure</b> <b>non-compliance</b> or, in other words, 'violation' of employers in South Africa of minimum wage legislation, and to investigate the determinants of this violation. This study constitutes the first attempt to measure enforcement and compliance in South Africa. In order to measure the strength of government enforcement of minimum wages in South Africa, the number of labour inspectors is used as a proxy measure, while employer noncompliance, or violation, is measured using an approach developed by Kanbur (2007), referred to here as the 'Kanbur Index of Violation'. Derived from the Foster-Greer-Thorbecke (1984) poverty measures, this index is used to measure the share of violated workers receiving sub-minimum wages, as well as the depth of violation, namely, the average gap between the stipulated minima and the actual wage paid. This is the first attempt in the literature on minimum wage enforcement to use the methodology proposed by Kanbur (2007) for the measurement of violation. The estimates obtained for South Africa show that the sectors where violation is most prevalent include the Security, Taxi and Farming sectors. A multivariate analysis is employed, using standard OLS, probit, and quantile regression techniques to investigate the determinants of the probability of a worker being violated by their non-compliant employer, as well as of the depth and extent of the violation, that is, the shortfall of their wage from the minimum. Another innovation of this paper, in addition to the use of the Kanbur index as a measure of violation, is the introduction of a number of spatial/density variables, such as the log of workers per square kilometre, the density of labour inspectors in a District Council, and the unemployment density in the area. The construction of these variables was made possible by mapping the statutory minima, which are location specific, to the geographic units in the Labour Force Survey data for South Africa. The principal findings of this analysis are that violation is an outcome of a range of 8 variables, including individual, firm-level/contractual, sectoral, as well as spatial/density characteristics. A key marker of the probability of minimum wage violation and the depth of violation is the density of labour inspectors in the District Council where the worker is employed. Firm-specific characteristics such as firm size also play a leading role. The results from this dissertation carry important policy implications for minimum wage legislators in South Africa, especially regarding interventions around the enforcement of sectoral minima...|$|R
