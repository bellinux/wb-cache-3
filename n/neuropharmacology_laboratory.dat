The {{efficacy and}} safety of gabapentin enacarbil {{for the treatment of}} moderate to severe primary restless legs syndrome (RLS) has been evaluated in several clinical trials in the United States and Japan. Although most clinical trials assessed gabapentin enacarbil at doses greater than 600 mg/day and demonstrated the overall safety and efficacy (defined as improvements in the coprimary endpoints of the international RLS rating scale [IRLS] total score and Clinical Global Impression-Improvement response), the US Food and Drug Administration approved the 600 mg once-daily dosage because doses higher than 600 mg/day were considered to provide no additional benefits and were associated with higher rates of adverse events, such as somnolence and dizziness. Nonetheless, the results of clinical trials and post hoc meta-analyses have indicated that the 1, 200 mg once-daily dosage was the most validated gabapentin enacarbil treatment for not only subjective RLS symptoms but also severe sleep disturbance associated with RLS. A Japanese dose-finding study showed that 900 mg/day, the intermediate dose between 600 and 1, 200 mg, failed to show a significant improvement in IRLS total score, probably because many of the patients who discontinued treatment did so early, suggesting that a half-landing dose may cause more adverse effects than favorable ones in some RLS patients early in the treatment. Gabapentin enacarbil may have two distinct therapeutic doses for the treatment of RLS: 600 mg/day or lower doses for the treatment of subjective RLS symptoms and 1, 200 mg/day or higher doses for the treatment of both subjective RLS symptoms and associated problems such as severe sleep disturbances.

We investigated a new strategy involving home-visit and phone contact and compared this to usual care in maintenance of PR benefits. Methods: A total of 172 stable COPD patients receiving 8 -week PR program were recruited for this prospective study. Patients were allocated into usual care group (UC) and PR maintenance group (PRMG) randomly. Patients in PRMG participated in maintenance strategy at home under supervision through home-visit and phone contact. The 6 -minute walking test (6 MWT), COPD assessment test (CAT), and modified Medical Research Council scale (mMRC) scores were evaluated every 3 months. Results: Of the total, 151 patients completed 8 -week PR program with satisfactory PR results (p< 0. 001), and 104 patients finished the follow-up. The clinical improvements in 6 MWT, CAT, and mMRC scores were maintained (p< 0. 001) in PRMG. In comparison, the benefit of PR diminished gradually in UC. The differences in 6 MWT, CAT, and mMRC scores between groups were observed 6, 9, and 6 months after PR, respectively (p< 0. 05). Total frequency of exacerbations in PRMG was lower than UC (p= 0. 021). Conclusion: Maintenance strategy involving home-visit and phone contact is superior to usual care to preserve PR benefits, and reduces the acute COPD exacerbation rate.

50|$|Alim Louis Benabid {{was born}} May 2, 1942 in Grenoble, France. The {{son of a}} doctor from Algeria and of a French nurse, Benabid {{was quoted as saying}} he could not easily decide between {{studying}} physics or medicine. He received his medical degree in 1970 and a doctorate in physics in 1978, both from Joseph Fourier University (now part of Universite Grenoble Alpes) in Grenoble. He became a staff neurosurgeon at Joseph Fourier University in 1972, professor of experimental medicine in 1978, and professor of biophysics from 1983 - 2007. Benabid also had a fellowship in 1979 - 1980 in preclinical <b>neuropharmacology</b> in the <b>laboratory</b> of Floyd Bloom at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California. From 1988 - 2007, he directed the preclinical neurosciences unit at the French biomedical and public health research institution INSERM, and from 1989 - 2007, served as head of the neurosurgery department at the University Hospital of Grenoble. In other roles, Benabid coordinated the Claudio Munari Center for Surgery of Epilepsy and Movement Disorders at Ospedale (Hospital) Niguarda in Milan, Italy from 1998 to 2007, and was a staff consultant at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation in Ohio from 2000 to 2003.|$|R
50|$|Booth {{has been}} Professor of Psychology, earlier Reader in Physiological Psychology, Senior Lecturer and {{initially}} Lecturer in the Birmingham School of Psychology since 1972, with research staff funded by MRC, HEC, SERC, MAFF, AFRC and BBSRC. In 1966-72, he was Research Fellow in the Laboratory of Experimental Psychology, School of Biological Sciences, University of Sussex, {{on his own}} funds from SERC, MRC and MHRF. He {{was elected to the}} Experimental Psychology Society in 1967. On joining the British Psychological Society in 1983, he was made a Fellow and later become Chartered Psychologist, {{a founding member of the}} Division of Health Psychology and professionally practising member of the Division for Teachers and Researchers in Psychology, ending as chair. His first employment within Psychology was as a postdoc at the Yale University Graduate School in 1964-6, initiating work on metabolic biochemistry and <b>neuropharmacology</b> in the <b>laboratories</b> of Neal E. Miller on his funds from NIH. From 1959 to 1964 he was employed as a graduate research worker in Henry McIlwain's Department of Neurochemistry at the Institute of Psychiatry (and briefly the Institute of Neurology) in the University of London. After 3 years of registered study for a PhD in Biochemistry, he graduated by thesis in 1964. He registered for two years for a BA in Philosophy and Psychology (with Sociology option) at Birkbeck College, University of London, graduating with First Class Honours in 1962. He went up to Corpus Christi College, Oxford, in 1955 to read Chemistry with Biochemistry, following secondary education at Dulwich College.|$|R
