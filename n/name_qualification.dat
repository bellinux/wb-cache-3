40|$|AbstractInheritance {{provides}} {{object-oriented programming}} {{with much of}} its great reusability power. When inheritance is single, its specifications are simple and everybody roughly agrees on them. In contrast, multiple inheritance yields ambiguities that have prompted long-standing debates, and no two languages agree on its specifications. In this paper, we present a semantics of multiple inheritance based on metamodeling. A metamodel is proposed which distinguishes the “identity” of properties from their “values” or “implementations”. It yields a clear separation between syntactic and semantic conflicts. The former can be solved in any language {{at the expense of}} a common syntactic construct, namely full <b>name</b> <b>qualification.</b> However, semantic conflicts require a programmer’s decision, and the programming language must help the programmer to some extent. This paper surveys the approach based on linearizations, which has been studied in depth, and proposes some extensions. As it turns out that only static typing takes full advantage of the metamodel, the interaction between multiple inheritance and static typing is also considered, especially in the context of virtual types. The solutions proposed by the various languages with multiple inheritance are compared with the metamodel results. Throughout the paper, difficulties encountered under the open-world assumption are stressed...|$|E

40|$|Recently it is {{becoming}} increasingly important to understand the role of information and communication technology factors in shaping social and economic differences. Theoretical as well as practical experiences of analyses confirmed that spatial processes of the diffusion of information and communication technologies (ICTs) largely influenced the economy and society of the 21 st century. In the last couple of decades ICT became an integral part of our everyday life, with lots of effects on social and economic processes, but we may experience other motives of inequalities today {{as they were in the}} past, or we may at least find some new characteristics of inequalities in addition to the existing ones. Basically inequalities are appearing between social groups in dimensions of accessing information. In the background as reasons we could <b>name</b> <b>qualification,</b> age, gender, income and many other factors of differences, and last but not least geography as an important motive. Therefore the first aim of this paper is to emphasize among the complex factors of inequalities the increasing and altering role of space in information age disparities, when speaking about digital access possibilities of different regions and locations. On the other hand, since infrastructure development policies have recognized the necessity of ICT development, an increasing number of people have become able to access the new information channels, resulting that accessibility could now be treated as a background problem. In contrast with accessibility differences, recently a new type of disparity emerges: the differences between users in the quality of usage. This secondary disparity takes place in the virtual world. Therefore the second aim of this paper is to reveal what new elements of inequalities are present in virtual space in connection with usage differences, and how it changed traditional spatial disparities. By analyzing data of Hungarian examples, this paper attempts to make a distinction between first and second order spatial inequalities...|$|E
