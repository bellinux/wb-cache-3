500|$|His work {{promoting}} {{cooperation with}} the WPB's mandates did not still Marcus's competitive instincts. With the fall of Paris, the traditional fashion capital, New York mayor Fiorello LaGuardia began to declare his city the new leader at every opportunity. To this claim, Marcus retorted in the international press, [...] "New York is finished as a manufacturing center. ... They're making clothes in Kansas, Philadelphia and Texas <b>now</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> won't give it up. The day is gone when only a New York dress is a good dress." ...|$|E
500|$|Martello {{thought it}} {{unimportant}} that many Wiccans had lied {{about the origins}} of their beliefs, being quoted by Pagan journalist Margot Adler in her book Drawing Down the Moon as having stated Let's assume that many people lied about their lineage. Let's further assume that there are no covens on the current scene that have any historical basis. The fact remains: they do exist <b>now.</b> <b>And</b> <b>they</b> can claim a spiritual lineage going back thousands of years. All of our pre-Judeo-Christian or Moslem ancestors were Pagans! ...|$|E

500|$|John Brousseau was not {{sent to the}} Hole, {{but what}} he saw of it made him decide to leave Scientology in 2010 after 33 years in the Church. He {{was struck by how}} [...] "dozens of these people , they were just so alive, but I looked at them <b>now</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> were just husks. They wouldn't say or {{originate}} anything, they seemed to have no purpose, they were just like sheep. There's no way 100 people could be evil horrid [...] and DM's the only [...] one. No way." [...] He had known and been friends with some of those in the Hole for decades and could not bear what he was seeing. As he put it, [...] "I can't stop it, but I can at least stop supporting it. So I left." [...] He left a note in his room for his colleagues to find: [...] "By now you've noticed I'm gone. I couldn't stand to see my Sea Org friends so mistreated. I won't support it anymore. Goodbye." ...|$|E
500|$|After a 20-year {{retirement}} {{from the film}} industry, O'Hara returned to the screen in 1991 to star opposite John Candy in the romantic comedy-drama Only the Lonely. She played Rose Muldoon, the domineering Irish mother of a Chicago cop (Candy), who has an indifference to Sicilians. The film reunited her with Anthony Quinn who plays her brief love interest, Nick the Greek. O'Hara stated of her return: [...] "Twenty {{years is a long}} time, but it was surprising how little changed. The equipment is lighter <b>now,</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> work a bit faster, but I hardly felt like I'd been away". She described Candy as [...] "one of my all-time favorite leading men", and was surprised by the extent of his talent, remarking that he was a [...] "comedic genius but an actor with an extraordinary dramatic talent" [...] who very much reminded her of Charles Laughton. In the following years, she continued to work, starring in several made-for-TV films, including The Christmas Box, Cab for Canada and The Last Dance, the latter her last film in which she played a retired teacher who suffers a heart attack, released on television in 2000.|$|E
2500|$|Vibe {{believed}} {{that there would be}} no [...] "all-black female R group having a chemistry, cultural and commercial impact as remotely comparable as TLC" [...] and dubbed CrazySexyCool as [...] "the blueprint for female ensembles to follow". The Philippine Daily Inquirer called TLC [...] "the most influential female group the world has ever seen". Singer Beyonc√©, the former lead singer of Destiny's Child stated that [...] "TLC has influenced just about every female group that's out there <b>now,</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> definitely influenced Destiny's Child." [...] Craig JC from Clutch wrote that TLC were [...] "big and influential" [...] during the 1990s, and that their contemporaries such as SWV, Total, Blaque, 3LW, Brownstone, 702, Jade, Xscape and En Vogue did not have TLC's crossover appeal." [...] David A. Keeps from Rolling Stone explained the impact of TLC: ...|$|E

2500|$|He further {{testified that}} the Dujail attack was [...] "part {{of a series of}} attacks and {{assassination}} attempts by this group, including against me." [...] He said that in 1980, Dawa Party insurgents threw a grenade at him as he visited a Baghdad university, killing civilians around him. [...] "I'm a victim of a criminal act conducted by this party, which is in power right now. So put it on trial. Its leader was the prime minister and his deputy is the prime minister right <b>now</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> killed innocent Iraqis in 1980," [...] he said. The Dawa Party is now a party in the Shiite coalition that dominates the Iraqi government. The party's leader, Ibrahim al-Jaafari, was prime minister until mid-May, when another leading Dawa Party figure, Nouri al-Maliki, was picked {{and he was able to}} form a new government before the end of May 2006.|$|E

60|$|It was <b>now</b> quite dark, <b>and</b> {{the road}} {{appeared}} to be growing rougher. Every <b>now</b> <b>and</b> then <b>they</b> jolted over a big stone, or sunk into a deep rut. Ralph let down the front window.|$|R
