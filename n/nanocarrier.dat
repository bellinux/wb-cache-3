5000|$|Passive {{targeting}} {{refers to}} a <b>nanocarrier's</b> ability to travel down a tumor’s vascular system, become trapped, and accumulate in the tumor. This accumulation {{is caused by the}} enhanced permeability and retention effect which refers to the poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) coating on the outside of many <b>nanocarriers.</b> PEO allows <b>nanocarriers</b> to travel through the leaky vasculature of a tumor, where they are unable to escape. The leaky vasculature of a tumor is the network of blood vessels that form in a tumor, which contain many small pores. These pores allow <b>nanocarriers</b> in, but also contain many bends that allow the <b>nanocarriers</b> to become trapped. As more <b>nanocarriers</b> become trapped, the drug accumulates at the tumor site. This accumulation cause large doses of the drug to be delivered directly to the tumor site.

5000|$|Certain nanocarriers {{will only}} release the drugs they contain in {{specific}} pH ranges. pH specificity also allows nanocarriers to deliver drugs {{directly to a}} tumor site. Tumors are generally more acidic than normal human cells, with a pH around 6.8. Normal tissue has a pH of around 7.4. [...] Nanocarriers that only release drugs at certain pH ranges can therefore be used to release the drug only within acidic tumor environments. High acidic environments cause the drug to be released due to the acidic environment degrading {{the structure of the}} <b>nanocarrier.</b> These nanocarriers will not release drugs in neutral or basic environments, effectively targeting the acidic environments of tumors while leaving normal body cells untouched. This pH sensitivity can also be induced in micelle systems by adding copolymer chains to micelles that have been determined to act in a pH independent manor.These micelle-polymer complexes also help to prevent cancer cells from developing multi-drug resistance. The low pH environment triggers a quick release of the micelle polymers, causing a majority of the drug to be released at once, rather than gradually like other drug treatments. This quick release mechanism significantly decreases the time it takes for anticancer drugs to kill a tumor, effectively preventing the tumor from having time to undergo mutations that would render it drug resistant.|$|E

40|$|Traditional tissue {{regeneration}} {{approaches to}} activate cell behaviors on biomaterials {{rely on the}} use of extracellular-matrix-based or soluble growth-factor cues. In this article, a novel approach is highlighted to dynamically steer cellular phenomena such as cell motility based on nanoscale substratum features of biological ligands. Albumin-derived nanocarriers (ANCs) with variable nanoscale-size features are functionalized with fibronectin III 9 - 10 matrix ligands, and their effects on primary human keratinocyte activation are investigated. The presentation of fibronectin fragments from ANCs significantly enhances cell migration as compared to free ligands at equivalent concentrations. Notably, cell migration is influenced {{by the size of the}} underlying ANCs even for variably sized ANCs covered in comparable levels of fibronectin fragment. For equivalent ligand concentrations, cell migration on the smaller-sized ANCs (30 and 50 nm) is significantly enhanced as compared to that on larger-sized ANCs (75 and 100 nm). In contrast, the enhancement of cell migration on nanocarriers is abolished by the use of immobilized, biofunctionalized ANCs, indicating that "dynamic" <b>nanocarrier</b> internalization events underlie the role of <b>nanocarrier</b> geometry on the differential regulation of cell migration kinetics. Uptake studies using fluorescent ANCs indicate that larger-sized ANCs cause delayed endocytic kinetics and hence could present barriers for internalization during the cell adhesion and motility processes. Motile cells exhibit diminished migration upon exposure to clathrin inhibitors, but not caveolin inhibitors, suggesting the role of clathrin-mediated endocytosis in facilitating cell migratory responsiveness to the nanocarriers. Overall, a monotonic relationship is found between the <b>nanocarrier</b> cytointernalization rate and the cell migration rate, suggesting the possibility of designing biointerfacial features for the dynamic control of cell migration. Thus, the functionalization of a mobile <b>nanocarrier</b> by a biorelevant ligand can be used to sensitize cellular motility activation to the adhesion ligands, and such <b>nanocarrier</b> interfaces can dynamically attune cell migration kinetics by modulating the uptake of the ligand-nanocarrier complex via <b>nanocarrier</b> size...|$|E
