5|$|As {{implemented}} in October 1970, the CDH system {{is divided into}} eight zones: six in the Lower Peninsula and two in the Upper Peninsula. This contrasts to the state highway system that makes no attempt to group designations by geography in the state. The boundaries for each zone are determined by major state trunkline highways on each peninsula. Each highway is given a designation composed of the zone letter followed by a two-digit number. Within the zone, <b>numbers</b> <b>are</b> assigned on a grid system: north–south highways use odd numbers and east–west highways have even numbers. Lower <b>numbers</b> <b>are</b> used to the south or west sides of the zones.|$|E
