5|$|In early 1993, Abraham Quintanilla, Jr.—band {{manager and}} father of Selena, A.B. Quintanilla, and Suzette Quintanilla—sent in a request for EMI Latin to release a live album. After the company accepted, Abraham rented out the Memorial Coliseum for February 7, 1993. It was advertised in local newspapers, while an {{unspecified}} <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>tickets</b> were given to radio programmers and deejays in South Texas for their giveaway promotions.|$|E
5|$|The tour {{ended at}} Earls Court on 29 October 1994, {{and was the}} group's final concert {{performance}} until Live 8. Estimates placed the total <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>tickets</b> sold at over 5.3 million, and gross income at about $100 million. A live album of the tour, named Pulse, and a concert video, also named Pulse, (which was shot on 20 October 1994) were released in June 1995.|$|E
5|$|A {{soup kitchen}} {{was built in}} 1880, {{replacing}} the police station which adjoined the hospital on the west side, by public subscription and dispensed soup to the ‘deserving poor’ until 1891. The soup was not free: it cost half a pence per pint. People who had donated each had a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>tickets</b> which they could give {{to those people who}} they believed qualified for the ration. The deserving poor in Victorian times were those unable to work during the winter months. Those individuals classed as undeserving were those whose poverty was deemed to be caused by indolence and alcoholism.|$|E

5000|$|The ACC {{implemented}} a new ticket policy in hopes {{to sell out}} more of the Greensboro Coliseum's approximately 23,000 seats. [...] In previous years, each school was allotted an equal <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>ticket</b> books for distribution. This left large <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>tickets</b> unsold as some schools, such as Boston College, Miami, and Florida State, do not have large <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> fans who make the trip to Greensboro for the tournament. In response, the ACC issued more ticket books to schools who traditionally sold the majority <b>of</b> their <b>ticket</b> books.|$|R
5|$|Because the 1924 Rose Bowl {{and several}} later Rose Bowls had very high ticket sales, the Tournament of Roses Association decided to close off the {{southern}} end of the Rose Bowl stadium and expand the seating from a horseshoe design to one that surrounded the entire field. The 1924 game was the first in which the Tournament of Roses made participating schools responsible for ticket sales. The strategy has been used since, with only a small <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>tickets</b> allocated to Tournament officials for each yearly edition.|$|E
5|$|For {{activities}} {{open to the}} public, such {{as community}} gatherings, school events, or trade shows, a police- or media-issued press pass may offer little advantage. Free or reduced-price admission, or guaranteed entry, can sometimes be arranged. The benefits may be more extensive, granting access to front-row seats or to press-only rooms. For sporting events, a press pass issued by a stadium grants access to the press box. Because open events are usually funded by paying attendees, the number of press passes may depend on the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>tickets</b> sold.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the video arcade games, Sega Enterprises, Inc. (USA) created a Crazy Taxi themed redemption game which was released in 2003. The player had to roll their coin or token down the sloped playing surface past a moving taxi model {{in the center of}} the playing field in order to hit one of eight targets (representing passengers) at the far end. Passengers were worth different points, from which the operator would then set the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>tickets</b> to be won. The game incorporated music and sounds from the video games.|$|E
50|$|The season 9 tour {{performed}} significantly {{worse than}} {{the last few years}} of the tour. <b>Of</b> the limited <b>number</b> <b>of</b> shows that reported their tour receipts to Billboard, the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>ticket</b> sold averaged 6057 per show with an average revenue of $277,814 per show. While this average <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>ticket</b> sold is around two-third of the previous two seasons, the average revenue was less than half of those seasons due to ticket price reduction and special offers. The ticket price this year averaged $45.87, down by around 25% from the previous two seasons.|$|R
50|$|During January 2011, Southern {{installed}} a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>ticket</b> gates on the Main Concourse {{as well as}} the exit and indoor area in between platforms two and three. Gate-line staff operate at the station also.|$|R
5|$|Tens of {{thousands}} of fans from both teams traveled to the game, often purchasing ticket and travel packages for thousands of dollars. The limited <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>tickets</b> available for the game were in high demand by fans of both teams.|$|R
5|$|Queens Park Rangers's strip for {{the final}} was all-white, instead of their normal white and blue hoops. West Browmwich Albion wore their away strip, which was all-red. Each team's {{supporters}} {{did not have a}} limit on the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>tickets</b> they were allowed to purchase. This was despite a limit of 15,000 for FA Cup finals which were also held at Wembley. A crowd of nearly 100,000 was expected to be inside the stadium, although only highlights were to be shown on television.|$|E
5|$|Since November 2012, an Early Bird {{discount}} of 35% {{has been}} offered for a limited <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>tickets</b> sold no later than 8 days before the departure date. If the 35% off tickets sell out before the deadline, tickets with a discount of 20% off are offered. If these tickets sell out before the deadline, tickets with a discount of 10% off are offered. If all early bird tickets are sold out, then full fare tickets are offered.|$|E
5|$|The {{problem was}} further {{addressed}} in 2014 when Greyhound rolled {{out a new}} yield management computer system. With the new system, Greyhound is now able to more closely manage the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>tickets</b> sold for each departure and dynamically adjust pricing based on sales. Although the amount of overbooked buses has been sharply reduced with this new system, Greyhound still does not explicitly guarantee a seat to everyone with a ticket (except on Greyhound Express routes).|$|E

50|$|Many {{airlines}} at {{one time}} had ticketing offices along Fifth Avenue. In the {{years leading up to}} 1992, the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>ticketing</b> offices along Fifth Avenue decreased. Pan American World Airways went out of business, while Air France, Finnair, and KLM moved their ticket offices to other areas in Midtown Manhattan.|$|R
50|$|In 2015, due to {{unprecedented}} {{demand for}} Super Bowl <b>Tickets,</b> a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>ticket</b> brokers {{failed to deliver}} tickets that they had sold on ticket marketplaces such as TicketCity, Stubhub, and Vividseats. Some TicketCity customers were affected. TicketCity provided affected customers with full refunds and an additional $2,000 per ticket as retribution.|$|R
5|$|The Circus Starring Britney Spears {{generated}} {{positive to}} mixed reception from critics. While some praised its aesthetics and deemed {{it as an}} entertaining show, others criticized Spears' lack of involvement during some segments. The tour was a commercial success, with a total gross of $131.8million. This made The Circus Starring Britney Spears one of the highest-grossing tours of the decade. A great <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>tickets</b> were sold {{within a week of}} the tour's announcement, which prompted supporters to add more dates. The tour also broke attendance records in many cities and all the North American shows were sold out. It became the fifth highest grossing tour of 2009, and the sixth highest grossing tour ever by a female artist. The show generated controversy on the Australian leg after a reporter said that a great number of fans had walked out during the performances.|$|E
5|$|The Wrington Vale line {{closed in}} 1931, with traffic having dropped to only two trains per day with no Sunday service. In 1938 coal traffic {{to the gas}} works ended, though there was some through coal traffic along the Clevedon branch. The Cheddar line was not faring well either: the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>tickets</b> sold along the line had {{decreased}} dramatically since the early 1900s, although {{there was still a}} significant flow of strawberries, milk and cheese to London. The railways were nationalised in 1948, with the GWR becoming the Western Region of British Railways, but this did not halt the decline. The line was closed to passengers in 1963, with the only traffic to serve a private siding near Cheddar, but this too closed in 1969.|$|E
5|$|When the {{nominations}} were announced on January 25, {{the field of}} Best Picture nominees {{did not include a}} bona fide blockbuster at the U.S. box office. It was the first time since 1986 that none of the five films in that category were among the top ten releases in box office prior to {{the nominations}} announcement. Furthermore, before the ceremony, all five films sold the lowest cumulative <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>tickets</b> sold since 1984. Ray was the highest-grossing film among the Best Picture nominees with $73million in domestic box office receipts. The film was followed by The Aviator ($58.4million), Finding Neverland ($32.7million), Sideways ($32.4million), and finally Million Dollar Baby ($8.4million). The combined gross of the five Best Picture nominees when the Oscars were announced was $205million with an average gross of $41.3million per film.|$|E
50|$|The {{relationship}} between tourism companies, transportation operators and hotels {{is a central}} feature of mass tourism. Cook was able to offer prices that were below the publicly advertised price because his company purchased large <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>tickets</b> from railroads. One contemporary form of mass tourism, package tourism, still incorporates the partnership between these three groups.|$|R

50|$|On the {{elevated}} departures concourse, there are designated waiting areas and VIP lounges (with better seating and, in the lounges, free food and snacks) for passengers travelling in CRH Business Class, and a <b>number</b> <b>of</b> restaurants and corner shops. There {{are also a}} <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>ticket</b> counters (where nationwide ticketing services are available) and an increasing <b>number</b> <b>of</b> retail stores and fast food stalls. Ticket machines are available to holders of the PRC ID card and sell tickets for trains departing from this station. 23 sets <b>of</b> <b>ticket</b> gates despatch passengers onto trains.|$|R
5|$|Since Woman of the Year, Hepburn had {{committed}} to a romantic relationship with Tracy and dedicated herself to helping the star, who suffered from alcoholism and insomnia. Her career slowed as a result, and she worked less {{for the remainder of}} the decade than she had done in the 1930s—notably by not appearing on-stage again until 1950. Her only appearance in 1943 was a cameo in the morale-building wartime film Stage Door Canteen, playing herself. She took an atypical role in 1944, playing a Chinese peasant in the high-budget drama Dragon Seed. Hepburn was enthusiastic about the film, but it met with a tepid response and she was described as miscast. She then reunited with Tracy for the film version of Without Love (1945), after which she turned down a role in The Razor's Edge to support Tracy through his return to Broadway. Without Love received poor reviews, but a new Tracy–Hepburn picture was a big event and it was popular on release, selling a record <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>tickets</b> over Easter-weekend 1945.|$|E
5|$|The 2009 Chick-fil-A Bowl {{kicked off}} at 7:37 p.m. EST on December 31, 2009, in the Georgia Dome, Atlanta, Georgia. Bowl {{officials}} announced 73,777 people attended the game, but that figure {{was based on}} the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>tickets</b> sold rather than actual turnstile attendance. That attendance figure was the fourth-largest in Chick-fil-A Bowl history, including when the game was known as the Peach Bowl, and it was the 13th consecutive sellout for the game. The game was broadcast in the United States by ESPN, and was watched by an estimated 4.87 million people, earning it a Nielsen Rating of 4.2. That figure was the 10th highest among bowl games that season, and was a 36 percent increase from the previous year's rating. The sportscasters for the broadcast were Sean McDonough, Matt Millen, and Holly Rowe. Because the game was played indoors, weather was not a factor.|$|E
5|$|The {{two teams}} were {{competing}} for promotion {{to the third}} tier of the English football league system, at the time called the Second Division, a familiar place for both sides. In its previous 68 seasons as a Football League club, Plymouth Argyle competed exclusively {{in the second and}} third tiers, exactly 34 seasons each. While Darlington had featured in the second tier just twice, competing in the third tier on 32 occasions and the fourth tier another 32 times. The official attendance of 43,431 was a record for a play-off final at that level, beating the previous record set in 1994, until it was bettered a year later by 3,373 spectators. There was also a significant disparity in the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>tickets</b> sold to the supporters of the two clubs, with fewer than 10,000 Darlington fans in attendance compared to 35,000 fans representing Plymouth Argyle.|$|E
50|$|The Dons {{shared the}} Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum with the Rams for its home games. Although never filling the mammoth {{facility}} the club {{made a show}} <b>of</b> offering vast <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>tickets</b> for sale at reasonable prices, including 40,000 reserved seats for each home contest priced at $2.50, 15,000 general admission seats costing $1.50, and 8,000 children's tickets priced at just 60 cents.|$|R
50|$|The {{station has}} over 230 train arrivals and departures every day, 4 ticket {{counters}} and 6 <b>ticket</b> machines. The <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>ticket</b> counters and ticket machines has changed after the renovations in 2011, {{as well as}} a customs office for international trains to France and beyond. There are only 8 platforms which makes it relatively small compared, for example, to Zurich's 26 platforms.|$|R
25|$|Depending on {{the amount}} of patrons through the years, each station has {{undergone}} upgrades or expansions that consist of either increasing the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>ticket</b> counters or opening new facilities for use by passengers or railway staff. Taller, wider canopies were erected on the platforms of most stations to replace narrower, original versions in 2006 and 2007. The pace of the upgrades varies by location.|$|R

25|$|A limited <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>tickets</b> for the 2006 festival {{went on sale}} a {{week after}} the 2005 festival on Friday, 15 July. Following a one-week presale in late February, tickets went on sale to the general public on Friday 3 March 2006 at 8am Weekend camping tickets were priced at €160. This {{allocation}} of tickets was completely sold out within 48 hours, leaving many fans disappointed. Growing popularity among younger audiences, massive MTV (UK and Ireland) coverage of the festival, and tickets being on sale for a much longer length of time were said to have been some {{of the reasons for the}} festival selling out earlier than usual. A small <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>tickets</b> went on sale on 4 July 2006 but quickly sold out.|$|E
