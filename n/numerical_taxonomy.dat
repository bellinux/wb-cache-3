500|$|The {{resulting}} {{code was}} formulated {{as a supplement}} to the existing International Code of Botanical Nomenclature. Stearn introduced two important concepts, the terms [...] "cultivar" [...] and [...] "grex". Cultivar, a term first proposed by L. H.

Grex (Latin for [...] "flock" [...] or [...] "herd") refers to a group of hybrids of common parentage, such as Lilium Pink Perfection Group. These concepts contributed a similar clarity to the nomenclature of garden or agricultural plants that Linnaeus had brought to the naming of native plants two centuries earlier. Stearn continued to play an active part in the International Botanical Congresses over many years, where he was remembered for his rhetorical persuasion on nomenclatural matters.

500|$|New {{and revised}} [...] "phylogenetic" [...] {{classification}} {{systems of the}} plant kingdom were produced, perhaps the most notable being that of August Eichler (1839–1887), and the massive 23 volume [...] of Adolf Engler (1844–1930) & Karl Prantl (1849–1893) published over the period 1887 and 1915. Taxonomy based on gross morphology was now being supplemented by using characters revealed by pollen morphology, embryology, anatomy, cytology, serology, macromolecules and more. The introduction of computers facilitated the rapid analysis of large data sets used for <b>numerical</b> <b>taxonomy</b> (also called taximetrics or phenetics). The emphasis on truly natural phylogenies spawned the disciplines of cladistics and phylogenetic systematics. The grand taxonomic synthesis An Integrated System of Classification of Flowering Plants (1981) of American Arthur Cronquist (1919–1992) was superseded when, in 1998, the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group published a phylogeny of flowering plants based on the analysis of DNA sequences using the techniques of the new molecular systematics which was resolving questions concerning the earliest evolutionary branches of the angiosperms (flowering plants). The exact relationship of fungi to plants had for some time been uncertain. Several lines of evidence pointed to fungi being different from plants, animals and bacteria – indeed, {{more closely related to}} animals than plants. In the 1980s-90s molecular analysis revealed an evolutionary divergence of fungi from other organisms about 1 billion years ago – sufficient reason to erect a unique kingdom separate from plants.|$|E

5000|$|An {{operational}} taxonomic unit (OTU) is {{an operational}} definition used to classify groups of closely related individuals. The term was originally introduced by Robert R.

At the State University of New York, Stony Brook, in collaboration with F. James Rohlf, Sokal worked on new statistical methods for the analysis of geographic variation. His interests shifted to anthropology and population genetics, and he directed studies on the population history of Europe as inferred from genetic and ethnohistorical data. Along with Luca Cavalli-Sforza, Sokal pioneered the comparative study of linguistic and genetic variation.|$|E
50|$|<b>Numerical</b> <b>taxonomy</b> is a {{classification}} system in biological systematics {{which deals with}} the grouping by numerical methods of taxonomic units based on their character states. It aims to create a taxonomy using numeric algorithms like cluster analysis rather than using subjective evaluation of their properties. The concept was first developed by Robert R. Sokal and Peter H. A. Sneath in 1963 and later elaborated by the same authors. They divided the field into phenetics in which classifications are formed based on the patterns of overall similarities and cladistics in which classifications {{are based on the}} branching patterns of the estimated evolutionary history of the taxa.|$|E
50|$|Her list {{of formal}} {{research}} papers is relatively modest but influential. Both her MA and PhD theses {{were on the}} corticioid genus Peniophora sect. Tubuliferae (now Tubulicrinis) as were her early publications. She went on to develop an expertise on other corticioid fungi. Well ahead of modern phylogenetic analyses she and Bryce Kendrick published an exploratory paper on <b>numerical</b> <b>taxonomy,</b> “Attempting Neo-Adansonian computer taxonomy at the ordinal level in Basidiomycetes” in 1966. Her studies on corticioid fungi led her to investigated sclerotium-producing Basidiomycetes, first among the corticioid fungi and then among other groups such as Typhula. She whimiscally and imaginatively named the fungus genus Minimedusa for the fungus because of its “medusoid” the mythical decapitated Medusa’s tangled hyphae forming the bulbil.|$|E
50|$|In the 20th century, {{particularly}} after the Second World War, {{we have seen}} extensive developments in the method of isolation, counting and differentiation of microorganisms in environments. The new methodology in taxonomy, like the <b>numerical</b> <b>taxonomy</b> and chemotaxonomy, was soon applied for the identification of environmental isolates. Also, differential staining methods and fluorescent antibody techniques were introduced for in-situ observation of microorganisms. Various new techniques, ranging from the determination of growth and activity of microorganisms in the environments to their isolation and characterization, were assembled in “Modern Methods in the Study of Microbial Ecology” edited by Thomas Rosswall in 1973).

50|$|The Willi Hennig Society {{was founded}} on a {{philosophical}} division among systematic biologists in the late 1970s. A debate created the rift between pheneticists who advocated for statistical or numerical methods that grouped taxa by overall similarity in taxonomy and systematic biologists who adopted a strict cladistic approach to taxonomy, recognizing groups by shared, derived characters alone. The last public clash occurred at the 13th Annual <b>Numerical</b> <b>Taxonomy</b> Conference at the Museum of Comparative Zoology (MCZ), Harvard University in October 1979. Twelve months later, the Willi Hennig Society was founded through invitation by Professor Edward O. Wiley and founding president James S. Farris. Seventy eight systematists from Great Britain, Sweden, Canada, and the United States gathered at the University of Kansas, to inaugurate the Willi Hennig Society. Membership doubled to over 150 by the second meeting.|$|E

40|$|The {{artifacts}} constituting {{a software}} system are sometimes unnecessarily coupled {{with one another}} or may drift over time.

We have applied the technique to: (1) software partitioning at the software architecture design phase; (2) grouping of components based on the source code to recover the software architecture in the reverse engineering process; (3) restructuring of a software to support evolution in the maintenance stage; and (4) improving cohesion and reducing coupling for source code.
