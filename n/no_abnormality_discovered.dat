5|$|Nicholas Sander, a Catholic recusant born c. 1530, was {{committed}} to deposing Elizabeth I and re-establishing Catholicism in England. In his De Origine ac Progressu schismatis Anglicani (The Rise and Growth of the Anglican Schism), published in 1585, {{he was the first}} to write that Anne had six fingers on her right hand. Since physical deformities were generally interpreted as a sign of evil, it is unlikely that Anne Boleyn would have gained Henry's romantic attention had she had any. Upon exhumation in 1876, <b>no</b> <b>abnormalities</b> were <b>discovered.</b> Her frame was described as delicate, approximately 5'3", with finely formed, tapering fingers.|$|R
30|$|Congenital {{absence of}} muscles is rare, {{with those of}} the axial {{skeleton}} being the most frequently absent. Within this group, the most commonly described are pectoralis major and trapezius [3, 4]. The appendicular skeleton, however, is even more rarely affected. Reported absences include thigh muscles [4], gluteal muscles [5], muscles of the anterior compartment of the leg [6] and elbow flexors [7]. In our case, there was absence of the musculature of the superficial posterior compartment of the calf, which only became clinically apparent once the child began walking. The only similar case described an absence of the entire (superficial and deep) posterior compartment musculature in addition to the Achilles tendon. This case was first identified in the immediate postnatal period and thought to be a calcaneus deformity of the foot. In our case, an Achilles tendon was present, and <b>no</b> <b>abnormality</b> was <b>discovered</b> until the child started ambulating.|$|R
40|$|Benign tumours arising in {{peripheral}} nerves are {{not common}} {{and are usually}} either neurilemmomas or neurofibromas. We present a case of an intraneural leiomyoma. Case report. A 65 -year-old housewife presented with a three-month history of pain and paraesthesia in the little and ring fingers of her left hand. Clinically ulnar nerve compression was diagnosed. Investigation, however, revealed normal conduction velocities of the ulnar nerve, but delay in the median nerve, typical of carpal tunnel syndrome. Both nerves were therefore explored in the palm, but <b>no</b> <b>abnormality</b> was <b>discovered</b> in either and the carpal tunnel was simply left decompressed. Unfortunately the symptoms continued, though repeat nerve conduction studies were normal. Three years later the patient again presented with pain and paraesthesia in her little and ring fingers. This time she also complained of a tender nodule in her left upper forearm distal to the medial epicondyle. This was explored and a large fusiform swelling in continuity with the ulnar nerve was identified (Fig 1). The epineurium was incised and the entire swelling easily enucleated. The surrounding fascicles were not involved and the swelling {{was thought to be}} a neurilemmoma. The patient recovered well and has had no recurrence of either the mass or her symptoms. Histology (Fig. 2) revealed the lesion to be well circumscribed and encapsulated. It consisted of interlocking fascicles of spindle-shaped cells with pyro...|$|R
40|$|The {{treatment}} of congenital dislocation {{of the hip}} from birth should give excellent results {{in almost every case}} under adequate supervision. Nevertheless difficulties still arise despite increasing awareness and more regular routine examination of the newborn. Accurate examination and treatment can be organised with less difficulty in large maternity units than in small units, peripheral hospitals or homes. The problems in early management are, first, the missed dislocation; and second, the complications of treatment. THE MISSED DISLOCATION The disorder can escape detection at birth even with adequate staffing arrangements. In the large Simpson Maternity Unit in Edinburgh four dislocations were missed out of 31, 961 births in the seven years 1962 to 1968 inclusive and were diagnosed later after walking began (Table I). This amounted to one missed dislocation per 8, 000 births. All infants were examined soon after birth by the paediatrician, and those with a positive “clunk ” test on one or both sides were re-examined by the orthopaedic surgeon within a few days. When the test was confirmed the condition was classified as a luxation and the hips were held in flexion and abduction by a Malm#{ 246 }splint (von Rosen 1962). When the “clunk ” was not confirmed but when laxity was found the hips were classified as unstable. When <b>no</b> <b>abnormality</b> could be <b>discovered</b> the hips were classified as normal...|$|R

CASE REPORT A. E. T., a Sudanese carpenter, aged 21, living and working in Omdurman was admitted to hospital on 31 st November, 1954 with a history of colicky umbilical pain and pain in the right iliac fossa for seven days, aggravated by meals and accompanied by vomiting and cough for seven days and con-stipation for five days. He had already had a seven-day course of emetine without effect. No significant past history could be obtained at this time, but after the operation he admitted that he had had colicky abdominal pain and occasional diarrhoea for some months. On Examination: He was a wasted and dehydrated young man, with a dry furred tongue. The abdomen was fiat and there was no splash; there was a tender, rounded, moderately mobile mass 3 inches by 2 inches, lying directly under McBumey's point with its long axis parallel to the inguinal ligament. <b>No</b> other <b>abnormality</b> was <b>discovered</b> in abdomen, rectum, chest and lymphatic fields...|$|R

40|$|We {{report a}} case of intraocular gnathostomiasis {{diagnosed}} by western blot assay in a patient with subretinal tracks. A 15 -year-old male patient complained of blurred vision in the right eye, lasting for 2 weeks. Eight months earlier, he had traveled to Vietnam for 1 week and ate raw wild boar meat and lobster. His best-corrected visual acuity was 20 / 20 in both eyes and anterior chamber examination revealed <b>no</b> <b>abnormalities.</b> Fundus examination showed subretinal tracks in the right eye. Fluorescein angiography and indocyanine green angiography showed linear hyperfluorescence of the subretinal lesion observed on fundus in the right eye. Ultrasound examination revealed <b>no</b> <b>abnormalities.</b> Blood tests indicated mild eosinophilia (7. 5 %), and there was <b>no</b> <b>abnormality</b> found by systemic examinations. Two years later, the patient visited our department again for ophthalmologic evaluation. Visual acuity remained 20 / 20 in both eyes and the subretinal tracks in the right eye had not changed since the previous examination. Serologic examination was performed {{to provide a more}} accurate diagnosis, and the patient's serum reacted strongly to the Gnathostoma nipponicum antigen by western blot assay, which led to a diagnosis of intraocular gnathostomiasis.
