5|$|Burrowing seabirds such as petrels, prions, and shearwaters {{share the}} tuatara's island habitat during the birds' nesting seasons. The tuatara use the birds' burrows for shelter when available, or dig their own. The seabirds' guano helps to {{maintain}} invertebrate populations on which tuatara predominantly prey; including beetles, crickets, and spiders. Their diets also consist of frogs, lizards, and bird's eggs and chicks. The eggs and young of seabirds that are seasonally available as food for tuatara may provide beneficial fatty acids. Tuatara {{of both sexes}} defend territories, and will threaten and eventually bite intruders. The bite can cause serious injury. Tuatara will bite when approached, and will <b>not</b> <b>let</b> <b>go</b> easily.|$|E

Elizabeth agreed to send 6,000 men to garrison Le Havre. Ambrose Dudley was chosen to lead the expedition in place of Robert Dudley, whom Elizabeth would <b>not</b> <b>let</b> <b>go</b> despite his strong desire to do so.|$|E

25|$|The wild {{worship of}} {{lawlessness}} and the materialist worship of law {{end in the}} same void. Nietzsche scales staggering mountains, but he turns up ultimately in Tibet. He sits down beside Tolstoy {{in the land of}} nothing and Nirvana. They are both helpless – one because he must not grasp anything, and the other because he must <b>not</b> <b>let</b> <b>go</b> of anything. The Tolstoyan's will is frozen by a Buddhist instinct that all special actions are evil. But the Nietzscheite's will is quite equally frozen by his view that all special actions are good; for if all special actions are good, none of them are special. They stand at the crossroads, and one hates all the roads and the other likes all the roads. The result is – well, some things are not hard to calculate. They stand at the cross-roads.|$|E
25|$|The 1980–81 {{season was}} again a memorable one for CSKA Sofia, winning the Bulgarian title {{once more and}} twice beating European {{champion}} Nottingham Forest, both times with 1–0 scorelines, before being stopped by the future European champions Liverpool with a 6–1 defeat on aggregate in the quarter-finals of the European Cup. The next season, CSKA reached their second-straight European Cup semi-final, eliminating Spanish champions Real Sociedad, Glentoran and Liverpool after losing 0–1 in England and winning 2–0 at home with two goals by Stoycho Mladenov. In the semi-final, the Reds again faced Bayern Munich. The first leg was held in Sofia and started with a full dominance over Bayern, as by the 16th minute, CSKA were leading 3–0 in front of 85,000 jubilant spectators who saw the European final in their dreams. But the final result was 4–3 for CSKA. In Munich, the club suffered a 4–0 defeat, ending what is still the deepest run by a Bulgarian side in the European Cup or UEFA Champions League. In the domestic league, CSKA did <b>not</b> <b>let</b> <b>go</b> of the title until the 1984–85 season, where they finished second behind arch-rivals Levski Sofia, but still managed to reach the Bulgarian Cup final.|$|E

500|$|The duet aria, [...] "" [...] (Take me from {{myself and}} give me to You!), again for soprano and alto, is in triple time. The tune of Johann Heermann's hymn [...] "Meinen Jesum lass ich nicht" [...] (I will <b>not</b> <b>let</b> <b>go</b> of my Jesus) is {{interwoven}} in the texture as a cantus firmus of the upper strings in unison. The movement is a [...] "love duet" [...] characterized by [...] "antiphonal avowals of commitment" [...] to God rather than a carnal desire. The musicologist Julian Mincham compares its presentation to Monteverdi's L'incoronazione di Poppea. The movement begins with sparse scoring and becomes more richly textured as it progresses, adding the chorale tune.|$|E

500|$|The {{technique}} and clothing of Roman charioteers differed significantly from {{those used by}} the Greeks. Roman drivers wrapped the reins round their waist, while the Greeks held the reins in their hands. Because of this, the Romans could <b>not</b> <b>let</b> <b>go</b> of the reins in a crash, so they would be dragged around the circus until they were killed or they freed themselves. In order to cut the reins and keep from being dragged in case of accident, they carried a falx, a curved knife. They also wore helmets and other protective gear. In any given race, {{there might be a}} number of teams put up by each faction, who would cooperate to maximize their chances of victory by ganging up on opponents, forcing them out of the preferred inside track or making them lose concentration and [...] expose themselves to accident and injury.

500|$|Several of the episode's {{scenes and}} motifs have been {{compared}} to popular myths and legends. Michelle Bush, in her book Myth-X, equated Mulder's overall quest {{to that of the}} search for the Holy Grail. She notes that in [...] "The Truth", Mulder and Scully metaphorically [...] "find their way to the Grail castle" [...] only to discover that the Fisher King—the wounded knight charged with protecting the secret—is actually The Smoking Man. Furthermore, Bush compared the final scene of the episode—featuring Mulder musing about hope regarding an alien invasion—to the myth of Pandora's Box. According to legend, the ancient Greek gods gave Pandora a box filled with evils and told her not to open it. Due to her curiosity, she disobeyed and unleashed various calamities unto the world. Bush argues that the Syndicate's tampering with alien technology—such as their alien-human hybrid experiments—are similar to the contents of the box. She notes that, in both cases, [...] "man's curiosity is his downfall". In the end, however, both Pandora's box and the world of The X-Files contain hope, which, in the legend, was the only thing in the box that Pandora did <b>not</b> <b>let</b> <b>go</b> of.|$|E

He passes the second attempt, and begins to distance himself from Lexie, who has fallen in love with him. O'Malley supports Stevens when she discovers she has melanoma, and walks her down the aisle as she marries Karev. O'Malley begins to display a talent for trauma surgery, and is told by the chief of trauma surgery Owen Hunt (Kevin McKidd) that it is definitely his specialty. He then abruptly and inexplicably decides to join the U.S. Army. While his friends at the hospital prepare an intervention to convince O'Malley to stay, they all work on a severely disfigured John Doe, brought in after a horrible bus accident, in which he pushed a woman {{out of the way and}} saved her life. When Meredith goes to check on John Doe, he seems to recognize her and will <b>not</b> <b>let</b> <b>go</b> of her hand. After several attempts at trying, he succeeds in tracing [...] "007" [...] on Meredith's hand. Shocked, she realizes [...] "John Doe" [...] is in fact O'Malley.
