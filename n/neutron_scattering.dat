5|$|Neutron {{diffraction}} is {{an excellent}} method for structure determination, {{although it has been}} difficult to obtain intense, monochromatic beams of neutrons in sufficient quantities. Traditionally, nuclear reactors have been used, although sources producing neutrons by spallation are becoming increasingly available. Being uncharged, neutrons scatter much more readily from the atomic nuclei rather than from the electrons. Therefore, <b>neutron</b> <b>scattering</b> is very useful for observing the positions of light atoms with few electrons, especially hydrogen, which is essentially invisible in the X-ray diffraction. <b>Neutron</b> <b>scattering</b> also has the remarkable property that the solvent can be made invisible by adjusting the ratio of normal water, H2O, and heavy water, D2O.|$|E
5|$|During the Cold War, Swiss {{authorities}} {{considered the}} construction of a Swiss nuclear bomb. Leading nuclear physicists at the Federal Institute of Technology Zürich such as Paul Scherrer made this a realistic possibility. In 1988, the Paul Scherrer Institute was founded in his name to explore the therapeutic uses of <b>neutron</b> <b>scattering</b> technologies. Financial problems with the defence budget and ethical considerations prevented the substantial funds from being allocated, and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty of 1968 was seen as a valid alternative. All remaining plans for building nuclear weapons were dropped by 1988.|$|E
5|$|Semiconductor {{detectors}} made {{of single}} crystal high-purity germanium can precisely identify radiation sources—for example in airport security. Germanium {{is useful for}} monochromators for beamlines used in single crystal <b>neutron</b> <b>scattering</b> and synchrotron X-ray diffraction. The reflectivity has advantages over silicon in neutron and high energy X-ray applications. Crystals of high purity germanium are used in detectors for gamma spectroscopy {{and the search for}} dark matter. Germanium crystals are also used in X-ray spectrometers for the determination of phosphorus, chlorine and sulfur.|$|E

5|$|The {{lipid bilayer}} is very thin {{compared}} to its lateral dimensions. If a typical mammalian cell (diameter ~10 micrometers) were magnified {{to the size}} of a watermelon (~1ft/30cm), the lipid bilayer making up the plasma membrane would be about as thick as a piece of office paper. Despite being only a few nanometers thick, the bilayer is composed of several distinct chemical regions across its cross-section. These regions and their interactions with the surrounding water have been characterized over the past several decades with x-ray reflectometry, <b>neutron</b> <b>scattering</b> and nuclear magnetic resonance techniques.|$|E
5|$|Fermi {{became the}} Charles H. Swift Distinguished Professor of Physics at the University of Chicago on 1 July 1945, {{although}} he did not depart the Los Alamos Laboratory with his family until 31 December 1945. He was elected a member of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences in 1945. The Metallurgical Laboratory became the Argonne National Laboratory on 1 July 1946, the first of the national laboratories established by the Manhattan Project. The short distance between Chicago and Argonne allowed Fermi to work at both places. At Argonne he continued experimental physics, investigating <b>neutron</b> <b>scattering</b> with Leona Marshall. He also discussed theoretical physics with Maria Mayer, helping her develop insights into spin–orbit coupling that would lead to her receiving the Nobel Prize.|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} a novel experimental technique for <b>neutron</b> imaging with <b>scattered</b> <b>neutrons.</b> These <b>scattered</b> <b>neutrons</b> {{are of interest}} for condensed matter physics, because they permit to reveal the local distribution of incoherent and coherent scattering within a sample. In contrast to standard attenuation based imaging, <b>scattered</b> <b>neutron</b> imaging distinguishes between the scattering cross section and the total attenuation cross section including absorption.

25|$|Correlation {{functions}} are typically measured with scattering experiments. For example, x-ray scattering experiments directly measure electron-electron equal-time correlations. From knowledge of elemental structure factors, {{one can also}} measure elemental pair correlation functions. See Radial distribution function for further information. Equal-time spin–spin correlation {{functions are}} measured with <b>neutron</b> <b>scattering</b> as opposed to x-ray scattering. <b>Neutron</b> <b>scattering</b> can also yield information on pair correlations as well. For systems composed of particles larger than about one micrometer, optical microscopy {{can be used to}} measure both equal-time and equal-position correlation functions. Optical microscopy is thus common for colloidal suspensions, especially in two dimensions.|$|E
25|$|If aneutronic fusion is the goal, {{then the}} most {{promising}} candidate may be the Hydrogen-1 (proton)/boron reaction, which releases alpha (helium) particles, but does not rely on <b>neutron</b> <b>scattering</b> for energy transfer.|$|E

Unlike most other systems, {{the configuration of}} the sixteen liquid-scintillator detection cells are arranged to provide omnidirectional (4 π) imaging with sensitivity comparable to a conventional two-plane system. Although designed primarily to operate as a <b>neutron</b> <b>scatter</b> camera for localizing energetic neutron sources, it also functions as a Compton camera for localizing gamma sources. In addition to describing the radionuclide source localization capabilities of this system, we demonstrate how it provides neutron spectra that can distinguish plutonium metal from plutonium oxide sources, in addition to the easier task of distinguishing AmBe from fission sources...|$|R

25|$|Hydrogen is an {{important}} and major component in all materials of organic chemistry and life science, but it barely interacts with X-rays.

25|$|Echo {{phenomena}} {{are important}} features of coherent spectroscopy {{which have been}} used in fields other than magnetic resonance including laser spectroscopy and <b>neutron</b> <b>scattering.</b> Echoes were first detected in nuclear magnetic resonance by Erwin Hahn in 1950, and spin echoes are sometimes referred to as Hahn echoes. In nuclear magnetic resonance and magnetic resonance imaging, radiofrequency radiation is most commonly used.|$|E
25|$|<b>Neutron</b> <b>scattering</b> {{techniques}} particularly {{profit from}} availability of deuterated samples: The H and D cross sections are very distinct and different in sign, which allows contrast variation in such experiments. Further, a nuisance problem of ordinary hydrogen is its large incoherent neutron cross section, which is nil for D. The substitution of deuterium atoms for hydrogen atoms thus reduces scattering noise.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Neutrons</b> are <b>scattered</b> by {{the atomic}} nuclei through the strong nuclear forces, but in addition, the {{magnetic}} moment of neutrons is non-zero. They are therefore also scattered by magnetic fields. When <b>neutrons</b> are <b>scattered</b> from hydrogen-containing materials, they produce diffraction patterns with high noise levels. However, the material {{can sometimes be}} treated to substitute deuterium for hydrogen.|$|R
25|$|An {{alternative}} way of spotting {{land mines}} through nuclear reactions {{with the help}} of neutrons is that of measuring the thermalization of neutrons. In this technique the soil is irradiated by fast neutrons and the flux of thermal <b>neutrons</b> <b>scattering</b> back is measured. The motivation for this technique is that explosives contain much higher concentrations of hydrogen, which is a very effective moderator of neutrons.|$|R
25|$|The NRX was repaired, upgraded, and {{returned}} to service 14 months later and operated for another 40 years, finally being shut down in 1992.

25|$|This first {{very basic}} model of silk was {{introduced}} by Termonia in 1994 who suggested crystallites embedded in an amorphous matrix interlinked with hydrogen bonds.

Sizes of the nanofibrillar structure and the crystalline and semi-crystalline regions were revealed by <b>neutron</b> <b>scattering.</b>|$|E
25|$|A {{variety of}} lab {{techniques}} {{are used to}} determine the properties of polymers. Techniques such as wide angle X-ray scattering, small angle X-ray scattering, and small angle <b>neutron</b> <b>scattering</b> are {{used to determine the}} crystalline structure of polymers. Gel permeation chromatography is used to determine the number average molecular weight, weight average molecular weight, and polydispersity. FTIR, Raman and NMR can be used to determine composition. Thermal properties such as the glass transition temperature and melting point can be determined by differential scanning calorimetry and dynamic mechanical analysis. Pyrolysis followed by analysis of the fragments is one more technique for determining the possible structure of the polymer. Thermogravimetry is a useful technique to evaluate the thermal stability of the polymer. Detailed analysis of TG curves also allow us to know a bit of the phase segregation in polymers. Rheological properties are also commonly used to help determine molecular architecture (molecular weight, molecular weight distribution and branching) as well as to understand how the polymer will process, through measurements of the polymer in the melt phase. Another polymer characterization technique is Automatic Continuous Online Monitoring of Polymerization Reactions (ACOMP) which provides real-time characterization of polymerization reactions. It can be used as an analytical method in R, as a tool for reaction optimization at the bench and pilot plant level and, eventually, for feedback control of full-scale reactors. ACOMP measures in a model-independent fashion the evolution of average molar mass and intrinsic viscosity, monomer conversion kinetics and, in the case of copolymers, also the average composition drift and distribution. It is applicable in the areas of free radical and controlled radical homo- and copolymerization, polyelectrolyte synthesis, heterogeneous phase reactions, including emulsion polymerization, adaptation to batch and continuous reactors, and modifications of polymers.|$|E
