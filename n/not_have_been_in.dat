5|$|Albert Victor's intellect, {{sexuality}} {{and mental health}} {{have been the subject}} of speculation. Rumours linked him with the Cleveland Street scandal, which involved a homosexual brothel, but there is no conclusive evidence that he ever went there or was even homosexual. Some authors have argued that he was the serial killer known as Jack the Ripper, but contemporary documents show that Albert Victor could <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> London at the time of the murders, and the claim is widely dismissed.|$|E

Angels' MLB players of the time did not remember working with Ramírez; catcher José Molina suggested that Ramírez must <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> the Angels' long-term plans, as they had a number of right-handed power pitching relief pitchers in the organization.|$|E
5|$|A harbour {{was built}} {{south-east}} of the castle, which would originally {{have been used}} to receive first building materials, then later senior members of the castle household or important guests. All that remains of the harbour is its 246-foot (75 m) quay, built from basalt boulders, and it may <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> frequent use during the medieval period, since it could only have been safely used during periods of good weather. West of the castle is a later shieling, the earthwork remains of a longhouse. South of this is a rectangular earthwork, with walls over 3-foot 3 inches (1 m) high, which may have been a siege fortification from 1462. If this is in fact such a siege-work, it would be a unique survival in England from this period.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, the German, Austrian and Ottoman {{force was}} now spread from Hill 110 almost to Bir en Nuss, but with their left flank unprotected. They could <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> good shape after {{fighting}} all {{the previous day}} in intense midsummer heat and having to remain in position overnight, far from water and harassed by British infantry. Their situation was now precarious, as their main attacking force was well past {{the right of the}} main British infantry positions; infantry in the 52nd (Lowland) Division was closer to the nearest enemy-controlled water source at Katia than most of the attacking force. Had the British infantry left their trenches promptly and attacked in a south easterly direction, von Kressenstein's force would have had great difficulty escaping.|$|E
5|$|Arkham Asylums boss fights were criticized, {{with many}} reviewers {{labeling}} {{them as the}} game's biggest failing. Reviewers found that the battles often rely on old-fashioned, tedious, and repetitive game tropes that required the player to learn and repeat monotonous routinessome of which, {{in the case of}} Bane, had already been employed on lesser enemiesor to confront repetitive attack patterns and one-hit deaths. Reviewers generally agreed that the fights were anti-climactic to their build-up spectacle. The final boss fight with the Joker was singled out for vapid gameplay, a battle with Killer Croc was labeled boring and overly long, and the reviewers said these should <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> the game. However, the fear toxin-induced hallucination segments of Scarecrow's battles were almost unanimously praised as some of the game's best and most cerebral moments for their fourth wall manipulation, subversion of the game's established narrative and expectations, and meta-textual influences that were compared to the battle against Psycho Mantis in 1998's Metal Gear Solid, and 2002's Eternal Darkness.|$|E
5|$|The loss of Pe-8s to all causes—mechanical, combat, {{friendly}} fire—had steadily {{increased from}} one aircraft per 103 flights in 1942 to one per 46 sorties in 1944. Despite the losses, production {{kept pace with}} need. The number of aircraft belonging to the 45th DBAD continued to rise; 20 were on hand on 1 January 1944 and 30 on 1 June. The Pe-8s flew 276 sorties in 1944 against such targets as Helsinki, Tallinn and Pskov. Aviation historian Yefim Gordon maintains that the Pe-8 flew its last mission {{on the night of}} 1–2 August 1944, but the Statistical Digest of the VVS contradicts this claim, showing 31 Pe-8s assigned to 45th DBAD on 1 January 1945 and 32 on hand on 10 May 1945. However, during this period the 45th DBAD only had three regiments, none of which used the Pe-8 as their primary aircraft, so while the 45th DBAD may have had Pe-8s, these may <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> use as the primary combat aircraft.|$|E

5|$|Though usually {{opposing}} {{each other}} in their reporting of events, reporting by both the Epitaph and the Nugget initially supported the lawmen's version of events. Woods, the publisher of the pro-Cowboy Nugget, was out of town during the hearings, and an experienced reporter, Richard Rule, wrote the story. The Nugget staff had a close relationship with Sheriff Behan, but Rule's story, as printed in the Nugget the day after the shootout, backed up the Earps' version of events. This varied widely from Behan's and the Cowboys' later court testimony. Subsequent stories about the gunfight published in the Nugget after that day supported Behan's and the Cowboys' view of events. Other stories in the Epitaph countered the Nuggets later view entirely and supported the lawmen. In addition, Dr. George Goodfellow, who examined the Cowboys after their death, told the court that the angle of the wound in Billy Clanton's wrist indicated that his hands could <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> the air, or holding his coats open by the lapels, as witnesses loyal to the Cowboys testified.|$|E

25|$|With {{both the}} Browns and Eckford active at Sackets Harbor, {{it has become}} a bit murky as to what extent Eckford was {{involved}} in the building of some of the ships there. He was in charge of all shipbuilding there and probably prepared plans for most of the ships, but the Browns' contracts were independent of his, proposals for the Browns and Eckford to combine forces to build some of the ships do not appear to have borne fruit, and some of the ships the Browns built may have borrowed from Eckford's plans without him being otherwise involved in their construction. Despite tradition that he was, Eckford may <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> involved the construction of New Orleans, but Lady of the Lake, Superior, General Pike, Madison, and Mohawk were his.|$|E
25|$|The {{question}} of Bernard's {{participation in the}} Battle of Hastings and therefore in the Norman Invasion is subject to debate. While Bernard had close family connections to the port of Saint-Valery-sur-Somme from which William's invading fleet launched, Bernard himself was not the ruler of that city and need <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> the fleet. He had later connections with Battle Abbey: he established a cell of that abbey in Brecon, but {{that may have been}} an analogous foundation intended to mark his conquest of Brycheiniog. Bernard's peculiar absence from the Domesday Book more or less damns the case for his presence at Hastings, for it is impossible that a noble participant in the victorious battle should not have received land to be recorded in Domesday if he was still living in 1087.|$|E

25|$|The NTSB {{reviewed}} the 30-knot target track {{to try to}} determine why it did not divert from its course and proceed to {{the area where the}} TWA800 wreckage had fallen. TWA800 was behind the target, and with the likely forward-looking perspective of the target's occupant(s), the occupants would <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> a position to observe the aircraft's breakup or subsequent explosions or fireball(s). Additionally, it was unlikely that the occupants of the target track {{would have been able to}} hear the explosions over the sound of its engines and the noise of the hull traveling through water, even more so if the occupants were in an enclosed bridge or cabin. Further, review of the Islip radar data for other similar summer days and nights in 1999 indicated that the 30-knot track was consistent with normal commercial fishing, recreational, and cargo vessel traffic.|$|E
25|$|Police {{arrested a}} suspect that closely matched the {{description}} on Sunday. The suspect had gloves that Mrs. Harmon {{identified as the}} same gloves worn by her attacker. The man was also wearing blue clothes and khakis. The pocket knife the 33 year-old was carrying, though, had a blade much shorter than five inches. This man was also clean shaven. After investigating the suspect, officers {{did not believe the}} man was the Phantom. According to the man's story about bumming around the country, he could <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> Texarkana during the slaying of Virgil Starks. The man said that he left Pine Bluff {{in the latter part of}} April and went to Colorado. Officers said that they were going to thoroughly check his story.

500|$|Mason and Washington {{were friends}} {{for many years}} until they finally broke over their {{differences}} regarding the federal constitution. Peter R. Henriques, in his journal article on their relationship, suggested that Mason cultivated the friendship more than Washington did, as Mason sent many more letters and gifts, and stayed more often at Washington's plantation, though the last can be explained in part as Mount Vernon lay on the road from Gunston Hall to Alexandria. Henriques suggested that as Mason was older, intellectually superior, {{and the owner of}} a flourishing plantation as Washington struggled to establish Mount Vernon, it would <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> the future president's character to be close to Mason. Washington had a deep respect for Mason's intellectual abilities, several times asking for his advice, and writing in 1777 when learning that Mason had taken charge of an issue before the General Assembly, [...] "I know of no person better qualified... than Colonel Mason, and shall be very happy to hear he has taken it in hand".|$|E
500|$|Eleven British alpine skiers {{took part}} in the Games, ten in the men's events and one in the women's. All five of Britain's medals at the Games were won in alpine skiing events.

Burt almost missed his silver medal run when race officials started prematurely resetting the slalom course, but Burt's sighted guide Keith Hockley noticed and took him up the mountain to complete the race. [...] Matthew Stockford, the reigning world champion in downhill, won three bronze medals in the downhill, super-G and giant slalom events of the LW10 classification. After Stockford won the bronze in downhill, the British delegation filed a protest claiming that the two American skiers ahead of him should <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> the LW10 category.
