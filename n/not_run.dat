5|$|A female P. schultzi {{that sees}} a male may {{approach}} slowly or wait. The male then walks erect and displaying by waving {{his legs and}} palps. If the female does <b>not</b> <b>run</b> away, she gives a propulsive display first. If the male stands his ground and she does <b>not</b> <b>run</b> away or repeat the propulsive display, he approaches and, if she is mature, they copulate. If the female is sub-adult (one moult from maturity), a male may cohabit in the female's capture web. Portias usually mate on a web or on a dragline made by the female. P. schultzi typically copulates for about 100seconds, while other genera can take several minutes or even several hours.|$|E

After the presidential debate, in which Underwood publicly humiliates Sharp in order to go after Dunbar, Sharp retaliates by backing Dunbar's campaign. Ultimately, however, Underwood wins the Iowa caucuses.|$|E
