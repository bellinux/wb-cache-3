In this paper, we estimate the separate impacts of tuition fees and maintenance grants on the decision to enter university in the UK. We use Labour Force Survey data covering 1992 – 2007, a period of important variation in higher education finance, which saw the introduction of up-front tuition fees and the abolition of maintenance grants in 1998, followed some eight years later by a shift to higher deferred fees and the reinstatement of maintenance grants. We create a pseudo-panel of university participation of cohorts defined by sex, region of residence and family background, and estimate {{a number of different}} specifications on these aggregated data. Our findings show that tuition fees have had a significant negative effect on participation, with a £ 1, 000 increase in fees resulting in a decrease in participation of 3. 9 percentage points, which equates to an elasticity of – 0. 14. <b>Non-repayable</b> <b>support</b> in the form of maintenance grants has had a positive effect on participation, with a £ 1, 000 increase in grants resulting in a 2. 6 percentage point increase in participation, which equates to an elasticity of 0. 18. These findings are comparable to, but of a slightly lower magnitude than, those in the related U...|$|E

50|$|From 2012 to 2013, {{following}} Government {{changes to}} student finance, {{there is no}} minimum bursary. In parallel with these changes, which were introduced {{at a time when}} the partners in the UK's Conservative/Liberal Democrat Coalition Government had opposite manifesto commitments over the raising of the fee cap to £9000, a National Scholarship Programme (NSP) was introduced to give <b>non-repayable</b> financial <b>support</b> to lower income students. Independent evaluations of the NSP found that it was of limited effect in widening participation and it was withdrawn after three years.|$|R
