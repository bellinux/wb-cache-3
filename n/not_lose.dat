5|$|A {{day after}} their victory over Birmingham High School, Alabama {{suffered}} their first all-time loss against the Birmingham Athletic Club (B.A.C.) 5–4.

However, the B.A.C. won the game 5–4 late in the second half when J. P. Ross successfully kicked a 63-yard field goal on a drop kick. Alabama would <b>not</b> <b>lose</b> another game by a single point until their 1947 game against Tulane.|$|E

They won all their home games during the 1893–94 season. Liverpool's longest unbeaten streak at home {{extended}} from January 1978 to January 1981, a period encompassing 85 games, in which Liverpool scored 212 goals and conceded 35. Liverpool's worst losing streak at Anfield is three games. This has occurred {{three times in}} the club's history to date (1899–1900, 1906–07 and 1908–09 seasons).|$|E

5|$|On {{their return}} to Martlesham, Dowding {{outlined}} his concerns about night interceptions and {{the characteristics of a}} proper night fighter. Since the interceptions were long affairs, the aircraft needed to have long endurance. To ensure that friendly fire was not an issue, pilots would be required to identify all targets visually. This meant a separate radar operator would be needed, so the pilot would <b>not</b> <b>lose</b> his night vision by looking at the CRTs. And finally, since the time needed to arrange an interception was so long, the aircraft required armament that could guarantee destruction of a bomber in a single pass—there was little chance a second interception could be arranged.|$|E
5|$|The next year, England {{completed}} another Grand Slam and did <b>not</b> <b>lose</b> that year, {{including a}} victory over the Springboks. In the lead up to the 1995 World Cup in South Africa, England completed another Grand Slam – their third in five years. In the World Cup, England defeated Argentina, Italy and Samoa in pool play and then defeated Australia 25–22 in their quarter-final. England's semi-final was dominated by the All Blacks and featured four tries, now worth five points each, by Jonah Lomu; England lost 45–29. They then lost the third/fourth place play-off match against France.|$|E

Due to financial cuts in the health care system, there are few professionals. Doctors and nurses who were trained in Cameroon, emigrate because in Cameroon the payment is poor while the workload is high. Nurses are unemployed even though their help is needed. Some of them help out voluntarily so they will <b>not</b> <b>lose</b> their skills. Outside the major cities, facilities are often dirty and poorly equipped.|$|E

After their former ground was sold, the {{possibility}} of ground sharing with Bolton Wanderers F.C. at the Reebok Stadium (now Macron Stadium) was presented, but the new stadium in Wigan was chosen instead. Their first game there was a play-off match against Castleford Tigers, which they lost, on 19 September. The Warriors did <b>not</b> <b>lose</b> a competitive match at the stadium in 2001.|$|E
5|$|After {{making the}} playoffs in 1989, the Giants entered the 1990 season as a Super Bowl favorite, though most {{believed}} they stood little chance of stopping the 49ers. The Giants began {{the season with a}} 27–20 win over the Philadelphia Eagles, then won their next nine games before losing a rematch to Philadelphia 31–13 in Week 12. The Giants also lost close games to the 49ers on the road and to the Bills at home in the regular season before defeating both teams in playoff rematches. In the Week 15 game against Buffalo, starting quarterback Phil Simms was injured and ultimately lost for the season with a broken foot. He was replaced by Hostetler, who did <b>not</b> <b>lose</b> a game. The Giants' defense led the NFL in fewest points allowed (211), and the team set an NFL record by committing only 14 turnovers in the regular season. After the season, six Giants were selected to the Pro Bowl.|$|E

Once all the cards have been transformed, Eriol tells Sakura that he aided her in converting the cards so they would <b>not</b> <b>lose</b> their magic powers. Syaoran later confesses his love to Sakura, who comes to realize she also loves him. Cardcaptor Sakura concludes with Syaoran returning to Hong Kong with a promise to return.

5|$|Australia's biggest {{challenge}} in the post-Test tour matches was against the H. D. G. Leveson-Gower's XI. During the last tour in 1938, this team was effectively a full-strength England outfit, but on this occasion Bradman insisted that only six current English Test players be allowed to participate. Bradman then fielded a full-strength team, with the only difference from the Fifth Test team being the inclusion of Ian Johnson {{at the expense of}} Doug Ring. The bowlers skittled the hosts for 177, and Hassett came in at No. 10 and made an unbeaten seven as Australia declared at 8/469. The hosts were 2/75 when the match ended in a draw after multiple rain delays. It was the tourists’ last first-class match for the tour and when it became obvious that they would <b>not</b> <b>lose,</b> Bradman let Hassett bowl four overs for twelve runs without taking a wicket. The tour ended with two non-first-class matches against Scotland. Hassett missed both of the matches; Australia won both by an innings.|$|E
5|$|Burnley's 30-game unbeaten streak {{during the}} 1920–21 season stood as a Football League record for 83 years {{until it was}} surpassed by Arsenal, who {{completed}} the entire season without losing in the 2003–04 campaign. After the defeat to Bradford City on 28 August 1920, Burnley did <b>not</b> <b>lose</b> another match at Turf Moor until 11 February 1922, when they were beaten 1–2 by Blackburn Rovers. In the same match, the halfback line of Tommy Boyle, George Halley and Billy Watson—used in 25 first-team games during 1920–21—was seen for the final time, having played {{together for the first}} time in September 1913. The majority of the championship-winning team remained intact going into the 1921–22 season, although players such as David Taylor and Walter Weaver found themselves less involved in first-team matches.|$|E
5|$|Democrats in the General Assembly were outraged.

The Republican Sampson would be outnumbered and outvoted in this group. Confident that the Democrats would <b>not</b> <b>lose</b> another gubernatorial election, Democratic legislators stipulated in the bill that the appointment power {{would return to the}} governor in 1931, the end of Sampson's term. The law passed the House by a vote of 53—42 and the Senate by a vote of 22—15. Sampson vetoed the bill, but the veto was overridden, and Johnson was returned to his former position.|$|E
