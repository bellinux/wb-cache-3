Joseph himself often {{threatened}} to resign as co-regent and emperor, but he, too, was induced <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so.</b> Her threats of abdication were rarely taken seriously; Maria Theresa believed that her recovery from smallpox in 1767 {{was a sign that}} God wished her to reign until death. It was in Joseph's interest that she remained sovereign, for he often blamed her for his failures and thus avoided taking on the responsibilities of a monarch.|$|E
5|$|Both {{halves of}} the road trace their origins to {{the early days of}} Aspen's {{settlement}} in the 1880s during the Colorado Silver Boom. Prospectors who had missed out on the earlier mining boom that built Leadville began to head west, drawn by reports of vast untapped silver deposits in the Roaring Fork Valley just beyond the Continental Divide. They began crossing what was then known as Hunter Pass, in defiance of an order from Governor Frederick Walker Pitkin <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> until the federal government had negotiated a peace treaty with the Ute people.|$|E
5|$|Isaac was {{the only}} patriarch who stayed in Canaan during his whole life and though once he tried to leave, God told him <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so.</b> Rabbinic {{tradition}} gave the explanation that Isaac was almost sacrificed and anything dedicated as a sacrifice may not leave the Land of Israel.

5|$|The {{series was}} created by Japanese manga artist Kazuhiko Katō under the pen name Monkey Punch. His {{inspiration}} for the series was the fictional French gentleman thief Arsène Lupin, created by Maurice Leblanc. Before creating the series he read 15 of Leblanc's stories. The aim of the Lupin III series was to produce a comedy adventure series that reflected the traits of Leblanc's character. Originally the intention {{was to keep the}} blood ties between the two fictional characters secret, however he was convinced by others <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so.</b>|$|E
5|$|Elu Suttina Kote (1987 Kannada film {{starring}} Ambareesh, Ramesh Aravind and Gautami Tadimalla), an Indian Kannada-language film {{which is}} primarily {{based on the}} novel. Few differences can be noted such as the lead actor wants to surrender to police however is said persuaded by his lover <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> {{as there is no}} evidence. In the climax, the lead actor goes running himself to the police when he sees him on the way promising her that he will return with a clear conscience. Although this was an intellectual film with good expectations, it did not see huge commercial success as other films where Ambareesh was the lead actor.|$|E

5|$|Reşadiye and Sultan Osman-ı Evvel {{were then}} pressed into British service. Reşadiye was {{completed}} that month and commissioned as HMS Erin, with Sultan Osman-ı Evvel entering service as HMS Agincourt. In September, Erin joined the 2nd Battle Squadron of the Grand Fleet, where she served {{for the duration}} of the conflict. She took part in the Battle of Jutland on 31 May & 1 June 1916. There, she was the fourth ship in the British line of battle, along with her three surviving King George V-class half-sisters. She did not fire her main battery during the battle, the only British capital ship <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> during the engagement; her secondary battery fired only six shells.|$|E
5|$|The {{case was}} argued {{before the court}} on March 28, 2006. Katyal argued on behalf of Hamdan, and Paul Clement, the Solicitor General of the United States, argued {{on behalf of the}} government. Chief Justice Roberts recused himself because he had {{previously}} ruled on this case as part of the three judge panel on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Critics called for Justice Antonin Scalia to recuse himself, since he had made allegedly improper comments about the decision of the case prior to hearing oral arguments ("I'm not about to give this man who was captured in a war a full jury trial. I mean it's crazy") but he chose <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so.</b>|$|E
5|$|The last non-royal member {{appointed}} to the order was James Hamilton, 3rd Duke of Abercorn in 1922, {{who served as the}} first Governor of Northern Ireland. When the Irish Free State left the United Kingdom that same year, the Irish Executive Council under W. T. Cosgrave chose to make no further appointments to the Order. The British government continued to entertain hopes for the order's revival as a pan-Irish institution. Therefore, while there was no legal or constitutional bar to the British government continuing to make appointments from among British subjects resident in Northern Ireland, it chose <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so.</b>|$|E

5|$|Throughout 1915 and 1916, Kropotkin, {{who lived}} in Brighton, England, was often in poor health. He was unable to travel during the winter, having been ordered <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> by doctors in January 1915, and {{underwent}} two operations to his chest in March. As a result, he was confined to a bed {{for the majority of}} 1915 and to a wheeled bath-chair in 1916. During this time, Kropotkin kept a steady correspondence with other anarchists, including fellow Russian anarchist Marie Goldsmith. Goldsmith and Kropotkin clashed often on their opinions about the World War, the role of internationalism during the conflict, and whether it was possible to advocate antimilitarism during that period (early 1916). As explained above, Kropotkin took firmly pro-war positions during these communiques, as he was predisposed to frequently criticize the German Empire.|$|E
5|$|Two days later, {{with the}} wounded hospitalised in Zanzibar, Goliath and Fox {{returned}} to Dar-es-Salaam and reduced {{most of the}} seafront to rubble, setting fire to several other districts of the town as well. This reprisal served only to turn the hitherto neutral local populace against the British. Feelings ran high in both camps following the raid, with the British claiming that white flags flying from several shore installations should have prevented any German attack, and the Germans insisting that the British had attempted to capture their merchant vessels' crews despite promises <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so.</b> According to Stephen Snelling in The Naval VCs, both sides had entered the operation {{with the intention of}} breaching the predetermined agreements.|$|E
5|$|Despite the Cyclones' ninth-place {{finish in}} the Big 12 with a 3–6 conference record, their record made them the Big 12's last bowl {{eligible}} team (the only team in the conference <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so</b> was the Kansas Jayhawks). They won three of their first four games in September beating Tulsa, Western Illinois, and Iowa. They lost on September 29 to conference foe Texas Tech. In October, the Cyclones went 2–2. They defeated #13 ranked TCU and Baylor, but lost to Kansas State and Oklahoma State. They lost three of their four games in November, but did manage to defeat Kansas, who were the only Big 12 team to finish with a worse in-conference record than Iowa State. 2012 was the Cyclones' second Liberty Bowl, following the 1972 game in which they lost to the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets by a score of 31–30.|$|E

5|$|For the 2006 season, the C Trophy was reorganised {{to include}} a {{round-robin}} stage instead of being entirely knock-out. Whereas Ireland had only one match guaranteed in the tournament before, they now had more fixtures against English county sides. Ireland recorded one win in their nine matches. Ireland participated in the competition until it was restructured again in 2009. In that time they played 25 matches and won two. The latter of those victories was against Worcestershire; in that match Ireland bowled Worcestershire out for 58, which was their lowest ever one-day total. It {{was the first time}} that Ireland had bowled out a county for less than 100. Ireland were invited to participate in the reformatted competition from 2010 onwards, but chose <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so,</b> and instead focused their limited financial resources on international cricket.|$|E
5|$|The final Gallup poll {{before the}} {{election}} showed the Liberals ahead, 48% to 34%. Just {{before the election}}, Maclean's magazine printed its regular weekly issue, to go on sale {{the morning after the}} vote, editorializing that democracy in Canada was still strong despite a sixth consecutive Liberal victory. On election night, the Progressive Conservative advance started early, with the gain of two seats in reliably Liberal Newfoundland. The party picked up nine seats in Nova Scotia, five in Quebec, 28 in Ontario, and at least one seat in every other province. The Progressive Conservatives took 112 seats to the Liberals' 105: a plurality, but not a majority. While the Liberals finished some 200,000 votes ahead of the Tories nationally, that margin was mostly wasted in overwhelming victories in safe Quebec seats. St. Laurent could have legally stayed in office until Diefenbaker could defeat him {{on the floor of the}} Commons. However, with the minor parties pledging to cooperate with a Tory government, St. Laurent chose <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so,</b> making Diefenbaker Prime Minister-designate of Canada.|$|E
5|$|Two {{weeks before}} the primary, Combs was {{endorsed}} by former Vice-President and native Kentuckian Alben W. Barkley, but Combs felt the endorsement came too late to be much help. Chandler defeated Combs in the primary {{by a vote of}} 259,875 to 241,754 and went on to win his second term as governor. Combs returned to Prestonsburg, set up a savings and loan company, and re-established his law practice. During the four years of Chandler's term, Combs accepted a number of speaking engagements, but otherwise remained out of the public eye. Meanwhile, the state's need for funds compelled Chandler to raise the state sales tax and other taxes, despite his campaign promises <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>so.</b> Consequently, Chandler lost credibility and Combs gained a reputation as a courageous, forthright, and honest politician for having acknowledged the state's financial need during the campaign.|$|E
