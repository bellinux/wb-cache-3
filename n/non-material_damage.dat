40|$|One of the {{consequences}} of wrongful dismissal is the damage sustained by the unlawfully dismissed person. It may occur in two forms: as material damage and as non- <b>non-material</b> <b>damage.</b> In the event of a wrongful termination of employment, material damage is reflected in loss of earnings and other income that could have been received if there had been no wrongful dismissal, as well as in failure to pay contributions for mandatory social insurance. The compensation for material damage (pecuniary damages) for wrongful termination of employment {{is not a matter of}} controversy in Serbian theory and practice. Besides material damage, wrongful dismissal may also cause <b>non-material</b> <b>damage.</b> In the spirit of Serbian law, it may be reflected in sustained mental pain (for the violation of dignity and reputation, and/or violation of one's personality rights) and sustained fear. The right to claim compensation for <b>non-material</b> <b>damage</b> (non-pecuniary damages) is a subject matter of debate particularly in legal practice. The major issue of dispute in wrongful dismissal cases is the question whether it is necessary to award non-pecuniary damages for sustained mental pain or distress (in addition to pecuniary damages), or whether the rendered court decision (establishing that the dismissal has been wrongful and that the employee shall return to work) is a sufficient satisfaction. Inter alia, the same question has been posed in respect of the cases involving the unlawfully dismissed judges and prosecutors. The authors advocate the standpoint that a wrongful act cannot be fully remedied in all cases only by awarding declaratory relief and returning the employee to work. Hence, non-pecuniary damages should be awarded as compensation for <b>non-material</b> <b>damage</b> caused by wrongful termination or dismissal whenever it is justified by the circumstances of the case...|$|E
40|$|Many {{countries}} {{today are}} making efforts through legal measures, security enhancements and health protection to improve {{living and working}} conditions and to neutralise especially growing risks of mental health impairment in the workplace. In this paper, we {{are focused on the}} problem of traumatic stress in the working environment, giving special attention to the legislation and problems of compensation of <b>non-material</b> <b>damage</b> in court. Based on practical experience and analysis of legal provisions in our country, the questions whether the traumatic stress reaction, which occurred at work can be treated as an injury in the workplace and whether the effects of chronic stress and psychological trauma in the workplace, can fit into the concept of “work-related illnesses“ are raised. According to recent findings about traumatic stress, there is a reasonable basis for the belief that extreme stress and psychological trauma in the workplace could be considered as <b>non-material</b> <b>damage,</b> which should be compensated in accordance with the basic regulations of the Law of Compensation...|$|E

40|$|Direct {{financial}} costs of accidents are {{the tip of}} the iceberg when compared to the indirect costs. Notwithstanding the difficulties involved, it is very important to estimate the indirect costs borne by society, and the non-material losses due to pain, suffering and loss of enjoyment of life undergone by the victim. This study investigates the pain and suffering costs (non-material losses) of the victims of construction accidents in Hong Kong based on relevant High Court personal injury case judgements in the years 1999 - 2003. The 54 non-fatal accident cases and 14 fatal accident cases analysed indicate that the average percentage of compensation awarded for <b>non-material</b> <b>damages</b> (pain, suffering and loss of enjoyment of life) to that for material damages (loss of earnings, medical and travelling expenses, etc.) during those years is about 30 %. This result enables estimating the pain and suffering costs of the society for a particular year if the total material losses of all construction accidents in that year are known. Based on previous research in which the material losses in Hong Kong were evaluated for the years 1999, 2000 and 2001, the corresponding pain and suffering costs could be estimated as 219 million, 150 million and 107 million Hong Kong dollars, respectively (US$ 1. 00  = HK$ 7. 80). Accidents, construction, costs, damages, Hong Kong losses, pain, suffering,...|$|R
2500|$|The {{second case}} {{concerns}} a former UN interpreter, Hasan Nuhanović, {{and the family}} of Rizo Mustafić, an electrician {{who worked for the}} UN Battalion at Srebrenica. Nuhanović filed a suit against the State of the Netherlands in front of the District Court in The Hague claiming that Dutch troops within the UN peacekeeping contingent that were responsible for security in the then Srebrenica protected zone, allowed VRS troops to kill his family (brother, father and mother), while the family of Mustafić filed the suite because he was killed in similar circumstances. The liability {{of the state of the}} Netherlands was based on the opinion that the Dutch Government (Minister of Defense) had the de facto operational command of the battalion, as established by the Dutch Constitution (Article 97(2)), which grants the government superior command ("oppergezag") over Dutch military forces. On 10 September 2008, the Hague District Court ruled against the plaintiffs, noting that the state of the Netherlands cannot be held responsible for the acts or omissions of Dutchbat, since that contingent of troops was made available to the UN and, as a matter or principle, any of its acts are to be attributed strictly to the UN. At the same time it found that the acts of Dutchbat cannot be concurrently attributed to the Netherlands since, in the view of the Court, no evidence was presented that the Dutch government [...] "cut across the United Nations command structure" [...] by ordering the contingent to ignore or disobey UNPROFOR orders. On 5 July 2011, upon the appeal of the plaintiffs, the Dutch Appellate court held that the Netherlands was responsible for the three deaths indicated in the claim, and that it owns damages to the plaintiffs. On 3 May 2013, the Procurator General of the Supreme Court of the Netherlands concluded in his so-called [...] "advisory opinion" [...] that the appeal against the Judgment of the Court of Appeal of the Hague should be rejected. On 6 September 2009 the Supreme Court of the Netherlands upheld the Appeals Court decision holding the Netherlands liable for the three deaths in this case. The Netherlands decided to award the families of the victims with 20.000 EUR each of <b>non-material</b> <b>damages,</b> while the material damages will be determined at a later date.|$|R

In the circumstances of damage occurred, one side is entitled to demand a repair or a financial compensation, {{and the other side}} is obliged to realise the repair or the payment of the stated sum. The right to file a demand for repair or compensation depends on the result of determination of someone’s liability. In case of bird strike (either with Croatian or foreign registration aircraft) at any airport in the Republic of Croatia, legal grounds for determination of liability are found in the Republic of Croatia Legal Regulations and in international conventions as International Private Air Law.

This thesis is devided to eight chapters. First part of this thesis is a theoretical introduction to the matter of occupational accidents and diseases and the liability for damages caused by them. The target of the first part is to define the institutes of the labor law, which are crucial for the regulation of material and non-material damages in labor law. The theoretical first part consists of Chapter One, Chapter Two and Chapter Three. Chapter One is introductory and defines basic terminology used in the thesis, with the main term being liability in labour law. Chapter Two enumerates various types of liability, such as material liability, non-material liability and other types of liability. Chapter Three defines material and <b>non-material</b> <b>damage</b> in the light of new Civil Code. Chapter Four and Chapter Five are specifying the issue of damage liability, on both sides - employee's and employer's.

40|$|The {{theme of}} the thesis is the injured person and his/her {{procedural}} rights. The thesis defines the injured person, deals with his/her status in criminal proceedings and analyses his/her procedural rights. The injured person's rights are distinguished depending upon the injured person's claim against the accused person for compensation for damage caused by the criminal offense. The injured person often figures in the status of witness in criminal proceedings {{and he or she}} may also have the status of the victim pursuant the Victims of Crime Act. Therefore, the thesis focuses on the injured person's procedural rights with regard to this specific status. In the thesis there is also delineated the issue of adhesion procedure in which the court decides the injured person's claim against the accused person for compensation for <b>damage,</b> <b>non-material</b> harm or obligation to return unjust enrichment. The thesis concurrently compares the Czech legal regulation to the foreign ones - France and Germany. The thesis is divided into six chapters...|$|R
40|$|In its {{judgment}} of 26 February 2007 in the Case concerning the Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, the Court {{by a majority}} of 12 to three found the respondent to be in breach only of its obligations under Article I of the Convention, namely the duties of revention and punishment. Despite the traditional selfrestraint professed by the Court, stressing its intention to ‘ confi ne itself to determining the specific scope of the duty to prevent in the Genocide Convention, {{and to the extent that}} such a determination is necessary to the decision to be given on the dispute before it ’, in the key passage of its judgment the Court stretched the interpretation of Article I to its maximum possible extent. On the one hand, it audaciously decided to disentangle the obligation to prevent in Article I of the Genocide Convention from any territorial link, substituting the traditional concept of ‘ jurisdiction ’ with the new and much more vague one of ‘ capacity to effectively infl uence ’. On the other hand, it endeavoured to fl esh out its general scope. However, after having found Serbia in breach of her duties under Article I of the Genocide Convention, the Court, somehow contradictorily, denied any causal link between Serbia’s conduct and the losses resulting from the Srebrenica massacres, and contented itself with a declaratory judgment as a form of satisfaction. The Court’s reluctance to address the issue of concomitant causes can be partly explained by the uncertain state of practice and doctrine. Furthermore, Bosnia itself had not asked for monetary compensation for breaches of Article I. Even so, the Court could have shown more creativity and sensitivity with regard to the <b>non-material</b> <b>damage</b> suffered by the surviving heirs or uccessors of the Srebrenica victims...|$|E

Darbe buvo atskleidžiamos ir aptariamos problemos, kylančios nagrinėjant baudžiamąsias bylas kartu su civiliniais ieškiniais, remiantis Lietuvos bei užsienio teisės aktais, moksliniais straipsniais, knygomis, teismų praktika. Darbo tikslas – išsiaiškinti ar pagal esamą teisinį reguliavimą Lietuvoje yra užtikrinamas visapusiškas civilinio ieškinio, pareikšto baudžiamojoje byloje išnagrinėjimas. Iškelta hipotezė, kad pagal esamą teisinį reguliavimą yra galimas visapusiškas civilinio ieškinio išnagrinėjimas. Darbe buvo išskirtos dvi pagrindinės struktūrinės dėstymo dalys – „Civilinio ieškinio baudžiamojoje byloje teisinio instituto samprata“ ir „Civilinio ieškinio nagrinėjimo baudžiamojoje byloje probleminiai aspektai“. Pirmoji dalis buvo skirta detaliai atskleisti civilinio ieškinio baudžiamojoje byloje institutą - suprasti ir išaiškinti žalos atlyginimo sampratą, civilinio ieškinio pareiškimo teisinį reglamentavimą, civilinio ieškovo ir civilinio atsakovo teisinę sampratą, civilinio ieškinio nagrinėjimą teisme, jo išsprendimą ir užtikrinimą reglamentuojančias teisės normas. Antroji darbo dalis pagrindinė, didesnės apimties, į kurią įėjo visa išskirta problematika ir jos analizė, reikalinga darbo tikslui pasiekti ir suformuluotai hipotezei patvirtinti arba paneigti. Buvo aptartos tokios problemos, kaip: civilinio ieškinio turinio imperatyvių reikalavimų BPK nenumatymas; trečiojo asmens įtraukimo į baudžiamąją bylą problematika; civilinio ieškinio dalyko keitimo BPK nereglamentavimas; netinkamo civilinio ieškovo ir (ar) atsakovo keitimo BPK nereglamentavimas; kaltinamojo sutikimas su civiliniu ieškiniu siekiant išvengti/sušvelninti bausmę; civilinio ieškinio nagrinėjimo ypatumai, kai byloje dalyvauja juridinis asmuo; civilinio ieškinio nagrinėjimas, kai atsakovui iškelta bankroto byla; civilinio ieškinio išsprendimo klausimas, kai baudžiamoji byla nutraukiama dėl senaties; civilinio ieškovo procesinio veiksnumo nebuvimo problema; negautų pajamų priteisimo problema; civilinio ieškinio tinkamo motyvavimo nebuvimo problema ir civilinio ieškinio perdavimo nagrinėti civilinio proceso tvarka išimtinio atvejo taikymo problema. Kaip matome, problemų nemažai, todėl ir buvo pasirinkta būtent ši tema, turint tikslą viename darbe išsamiai ištirti iš civilinio ieškinio nagrinėjimo baudžiamojoje byloje kylančią problematiką. Darbo pradžioje iškelta hipotezė buvo tik dalinai patvirtinta, kadangi civilinio ieškinio instituto baudžiamojoje byloje reglamentavimas yra nepakankamas ir neišsamus, siekiant visapusiško civilinio ieškinio išnagrinėjimo. This Master Degree‘s final thesis {{presents}} a research that {{was conducted with}} the aim {{to determine whether the}} current regulatory framework of Lithuania ensures a comprehensive consideration of a civil claim in criminal proceedings. In this respect, the research dealt with the issues arising from a trial of criminal cases that involved the examination of civil claims for damages filed by victims of crimes against the accused person or the person bearing financial liability for the actions of the accused. The relevance of the subject {{stems from the fact that}} the examination of case-law has revealed a number of issues related to the absence of or flawed legal regulation in the provisions on civil claims contained in the Code of Criminal Procedure of the Republic of Lithuania (CCP). A hypothesis formulated at the beginning of the thesis – that a comprehensive consideration of civil claims is ensured under the current regulatory framework of Lithuania, was sought to be confirmed or rejected. The main objective of the thesis was to determine whether Lithuania‘s current regulatory framework allows a comprehensive consideration of a civil claim filed in criminal proceedings. To attain this objective, the following tasks were identified: 1. 	Present a notion of the institute of a civil claim in criminal proceedings; 2. 	Analyse the relevant works by foreign and Lithuanian researchers; 3. 	Analyse and compare international and national legal acts that govern the consideration of a civil claim in criminal proceedings; 4. 	Find and analyse criminal cases in which civil claims were considered; 5. 	Assess the legal framework of Lithuania and identify issues arising from the consideration of a civil claim along with a criminal case; 6. 	Propose ways for resolving the issues identified by establishing new legal provisions or by improving the existing ones. The Constitution of the Republic of Lithuania establishes the person‘s right to apply to court in the event of infringement of the person‘s constitutional rights. A person that has suffered material or <b>non-material</b> <b>damage</b> caused by a criminal act is entitled to request indemnification in criminal proceedings in order to avoid two separate judicial proceedings (civil and criminal). However, a number of issues arise in such cases due to the current legal regulation. Identification, description and analysis of the issues have helped to attain the objective of the thesis and to resolve the hypothesis. The thesis has been divided into two structural parts: ‘Notion of the Legal Institute of a Civil Claim in Criminal Proceedings’ and ‘Issues Arising from Consideration of Civil Claim in Criminal Proceedings’. The first part is aimed at a detailed description of the institute of civil claim in criminal proceedings including the understanding and clarification of the notion of damage caused by criminal acts; legal regulation of the filing of a civil claim; a legal notion of a civil claimant and a civil defendant; and legal provisions governing the consideration, deciding and securing of a civil claim in court. This part of the thesis clarifies the understanding of the legal institute and defined its main provisions under the current legal framework. The second part of the thesis is the main part, therefore, it is larger in scope and incorporates all the issues identified as well their analysis required for the attainment of the objective of the thesis and for the confirmation/rejection of the hypothesis. The following issues have been analysed and described in individual sections of this part of the thesis: 1. 	Absence of imperative requirements for the content of a civil claim in the CCP; 2. 	Involvement of third parties in the criminal proceedings as participants, whereas the CCP does not contain legal provisions on the ways to do this; 3. 	Absence of legal provisions on the changing of the subject of a civil claim in the CCP; 4. 	Absence of legal provisions on the replacement of an unsuitable civil claimant and/or defendant in the CCP; 5. 	The accused person‘s agreement to the civil claim in order to avoid or to mitigate a penalty; 6. 	Consideration of a civil claim involving legal persons; 7. 	Consideration of a civil claim when a person against whom bankruptcy proceedings have been instituted is involved in the criminal proceedings in the capacity of a civil defendant; 8. 	Settlement of a civil claim where criminal proceedings are terminated due to application of prescription provisions to criminal liability; 9. 	Absence of procedural capability of the civil claimant; 10. 	Awarding payment of lost income as requested in the civil claim; 11. 	Lack of proper argumentation of a civil claim in the descriptive part of the judgment; 12. 	Application of the exceptional case of referral of a civil case for consideration by way of a civil procedure when this right is being abused. It has been concluded that the objective of the thesis was attained upon fulfilment of all the tasks, and the hypothesis advanced at the beginning of the thesis was confirmed in part. While consideration of a civil claim in criminal proceedings can be appropriate and right according to the current legal framework, the regulation of this institute is insufficient and not detailed enough in some cases. Therefore, a number of potential solutions of the issues have been proposed in order to ensure a comprehensive, fair and complete consideration of a civil claim in criminal proceedings...|$|E
