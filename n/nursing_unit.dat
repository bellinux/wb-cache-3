The shortage of skilled human resources in nursing has indicated the need for mentoring. However, no formalized framework exists on how mentoring {{in the context of}} <b>nurse</b> <b>unit</b> managers should occur, despite mentoring being a legal requirement (South Africa, 2004 : 26). The intention {{of this study was to}} develop a mentoring strategy for <b>nurse</b> <b>unit</b> managers in private hospitals in Gauteng. The mentoring needs of <b>nurse</b> <b>unit</b> managers in private hospitals in Gauteng were determined and conceptualized and a framework developed on which the development of a mentoring strategy could be based. A quantitative descriptive research design was followed to develop a mentoring strategy for <b>Nurse</b> <b>Unit</b> managers in private hospitals in Gauteng. Probability sampling was employed (Burns & Grove, 2005 : 348). A clustered sample (Burns & Grove, 2005 : 348) of private hospitals within the three regions of Tshwane, Johannesburg Central and Ekurhuleni was drawn. From these a random sample of <b>nurse</b> <b>unit</b> managers in private hospitals within the clusters was drawn. A self-developed closed-ended questionnaire (see Annexure 1) was utilized to collect data on the mentoring needs of <b>nurse</b> <b>unit</b> managers. Data was analysed using the Statistical Package of Social Sciences (SPSS), and a statistician at the University of Johannesburg was consulted. Descriptive statistics were employed to analyse data (Burns & Grove, 2005 : 442). Content validity was ensured and the instrument piloted to ensure its reliability. An external statistician was consulted to ensure the credibility or validity of the data analysis and interpretation. Ethical approval was sought and measures implemented to ensure the ethical nature of the study. The descriptive data that was analysed included the biographical data – age, gender, race, home language, highest level of qualification, employment status, length of service, length of position, clinical area and the number of work hours of <b>nurse</b> <b>unit</b> managers. The ANOVA statistical results revealed a moderate need for mentoring of <b>nurse</b> <b>unit</b> managers in all of the management dimensions. Recommendations for further research were outlined and a conclusion on the need for <b>nurse</b> <b>unit</b> managers to be mentored was drawn.

40|$|M. Cur. The overall {{purpose of}} this study is to {{describe}} empowerment strategies for the <b>nurse</b> <b>unit</b> manager to create a climate conducive to clinical learning at the nursing college in the North-West Province. In view of the South African Nursing Council report (1990), it clearly indicates that the <b>nurse</b> <b>unit</b> managers do not apply their theoretical knowledge to clinical practice, and that the student learning in the clinical <b>nursing</b> <b>units</b> are not up to the expected standard, hence the quality of clinical nursing education is questionable. The current education system in South Africa focuses on the provision of quality assurance in order to be in line with international standards. In accordance with the South African Qualifications Authority, the Constitution, South African Nursing Council, Batho-Pele principles, National Plan for Higher Education and outcomes-based education, there is a need to create a climate that is conducive to learning in the <b>nursing</b> <b>units</b> in order to develop the students' abilities regarding analytical, critical, evaluative and creative thinking. The <b>nurse</b> <b>unit</b> manager is experiencing problems with regard to clinical nursing education and the nursing students are also complaining that the clinical learning areas are not conducive to their learning. Therefore, the products that are produced by such an environment lack knowledge, skills, values and attitudes inherent in the nursing profession. Hence this study strives to describe empowerment strategies for the <b>nurse</b> <b>unit</b> manager to create a climate conducive to learning, based on their expert knowledge and experiences. The research questions arising from this problem are: What are the expectations and perceptions of the nursing students about the role of the <b>nurse</b> <b>unit</b> manager in creating a climate conducive to learning at the nursing college in the North-West Province? How can the <b>nurse</b> <b>unit</b> manager be empowered to create a climate conducive to clinical learning? The objectives are: Phase One: Stage one: To explore and describe the expectations of the nursing students regarding the role of the <b>nurse</b> <b>unit</b> manager in creating a climate conducive to learning. Stage two: To explore and describe the expectations and perceptions of the <b>nurse</b> <b>unit</b> manager regarding their role in creating a climate conducive to learning. Phase Two: To describe a conceptual framework. Phase Three: To describe empowerment strategies for the <b>nurse</b> <b>unit</b> manager to create a climate conducive to learning. The research design in this study was qualitative, descriptive, explorative and contextual in nature. In stage one of phase one, descriptive naïve sketches were used as a method of data gathering (Giorgi in Ornery, 1983 : 52) whereby 22 nursing students from the nursing college were selected for the research study. The following open-ended questions were written on the chalkboard, namely: "What are your expectations about the role of the <b>nurse</b> <b>unit</b> manager in creating the clinical <b>nursing</b> <b>units</b> as a climate conducive to learning?" The data was analysed according to Tesch's descriptive method (in Creswell, 1994 : 155). An independent coder who was purposively selected was used in the categorisation of data. The researcher held meetings with the independent coder for consensus discussions reached independently. Trustworthiness was ensured as described by Lincoln and Guba's (1985 : 290 - 326) model of trustworthiness. In order to ensure the credibility of the study, five nursing students who participated in the study were selected to participate in individual interviews to validate the categories and subcategories. In stage two of phase one, focus group interviews were conducted as a method of data gathering whereby 13 <b>nurse</b> <b>unit</b> managers from the clinical learning areas where the nursing students are placed for their clinical learning experiences were selected by the quota sampling technique. The interview was conducted by a nurse educator with a Master's degree, who is also a psychiatric nurse with expertise and experience in interviewing skills. A tape recorder was utilised with the <b>nurse</b> <b>unit</b> manager's permission to collect data. A follow-up interview with five <b>nurse</b> <b>unit</b> managers was conducted to validate the data gathered during the focus group interview. The following open-ended questions was used to obtain data from the <b>nurse</b> <b>unit</b> manager: "What are your perceptions regarding your role in creating an environment conducive to clinical learning?" "How can you be empowered as part of your role, to create clinical <b>nursing</b> <b>units</b> as climates conducive for clinical teaching and learning for nursing students?" Data was analysed according to Tesch's descriptive method (in Creswell, 1994 : 155). An independent coder was purposively selected in the categorisation (iv) of data. Categories were defined and arranged in table form for both participants in order to arrive at final categories. Trustworthiness was ensured as described by Lincoln and Guba's (1985 : 290 - 326) model of trustworthiness. Findings were conceptualised and conclusive statements made through logical deductive, inductive reasoning and inferences. A conceptual framework was developed within Muller's (1998) management process and the legal and professional frameworks. The integrated empowering process was adapted from Muller's management process, Vogt & Murrel's (1990) & Hokanson-Hawks' (1999) empowerment methods. This process comprises planning, organising (providing and structuring), directing (education, leading, mentoring and supporting), and control (actualising). Empowerment strategies for the <b>nurse</b> <b>unit</b> manager were described to create a climate conducive to learning, based on the results of phase one and phase two.
