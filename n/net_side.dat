50|$|Brennan and Scherl {{were aware}} of this problem, and {{implemented}} their balancing systems with pairs of counter rotating gyros, precessing in opposite directions. With this arrangement, all motion of the vehicle with respect to inertial space causes equal and opposite torques on the two gyros, and are consequently cancelled out. With the double gyro system, the instability on bends is eliminated and the vehicle will bank to the correct angle, so that no <b>net</b> <b>side</b> force is experienced on board.|$|E

In order to suppress the transient when the intermediate DC link voltage fluctuation, generally adopt the method of increasing capacitor capacity, the disadvantages of this approach are: slow dynamic response, large volume, low service life, high cost of equipment.

40|$|Abstract: The {{realization}} of power modeling and power control of PWM rectifier with resistive and reactive load {{is based on}} the method of Lyapunov. Firstly, PWM rectifier's mathematical power model is established in d-q synchronous rotating coordinates, and balance point is found according to the control requirement of the system and analysis the stability of the equilibrium point according to the Lyapunov method and invariant theory. Then PWM rectifier's power controller has been gotten through damping injection. The designed power controller realizes fast voltage tracking and makes the <b>net</b> <b>side</b> power factor as 1, which has great inhibitory effect on resistive and inductive disturbance. Influence on the system exerted by different damping injection is analyzed and feasibility of PWM rectifier's power control based on Lyapunov method is verified...|$|E
50|$|This {{method is}} to use two trawls side by side. Three wires attach to this combination. Instead of having {{individual}} wires connected {{to each of the}} <b>nets</b> <b>sides,</b> a common wire attaches to the two inner sides and the outer <b>sides</b> of each <b>net</b> are wired individually. Again otter boards allow the net mouths to spread apart horizontally while floats and ground ropes provide the vertical forces. This gear is usually used for catching target fish such as monkfish, flatfish and nephrops.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} build an {{aggregated}} wind farm model to research on the effect large scale wind power has on the transient performance of the power system, firstly, {{it is necessary to}} build an effective WTGs model.

40|$|A {{system for}} {{cleaning}} and verifying the cleanliness {{of the interior}} surfaces of hollow items, such as small bottles, tanks, pipes and tubes, employs a rotating spray head for supplying a gas-liquid cleaning mixture to the item's surface at a supersonic velocity. The spray head incorporates a plurality of nozzles having diverging cross sections so that the incoming gas-liquid mixture is first converged within the spray head and then diverged through the nozzles, thereby accelerating the mixture to a supersonic velocity. In the preferred embodiment, three nozzles are employed; one forwardly facing nozzle {{at the end of}} the spray head and two oppositely facing angled nozzles exiting on opposite sides of the spray head which balance each other, and therefore impart no <b>net</b> <b>side</b> load on the spray head. A drive mechanism is provided to rotate the spray head and at the same time move the head back and forth within the item to be cleaned. The drive mechanism acts on a long metal tube to which the spray head is fixed, and thus no moving parts are exposed to the interior surfaces of the items to be cleaned, thereby reducing the risk of contamination...|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} years {{important}} improvements are developing in the electrical systems: the process of electrical market liberalization, extended to all the customers, small and residential included, and a strong encouragement towards the energy saving and the installation of small renewable power sources. The regulatory barriers appear insufficient {{to comply with the}} Nearly Zero-Energy Buildings strongly encouraged by European Directives. The actual distribution system for low voltage customers appears inadequate to comply with these improvements. Chaotic phenomena in the existing distribution networks will occur if the penetration of the generators will reach high level of the net energy that saturates the local load exigencies and requires the node <b>net</b> <b>side</b> as load server. The authors suggest the ecodesign of the residential and commercial low voltage distribution as a micro grid that allows to guarantee a reduced impact as ever net load on the net supply at least in a first evolution. Adequate sizing and optimal operation in order to maintain ever net load. Tha paper suggest an evoluted architecture for the micro grid in order to optimize the energy exchanges and to ensure an high level of reliability both for the user and for the distributor. © 2013 IEEE...|$|E
