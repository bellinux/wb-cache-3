Now he's released an album of old pop standards, Stardust (Columbia), and you can almost hear the stirrings of an outlaw uprising between the grooves [...] although is definitively <b>no</b> <b>step</b> forward in Nelson's career, it's still a pleasurable showcase of his considerable artistry as a vocalist.

2500|$|Suetonius' account has Caesar {{return to}} Rome from Hispania hastily without even {{waiting for his}} {{successor}} because he wanted both a triumph and the consulship. As {{the day of the}} election for the consulship had already been set, he had to register his candidacy as a private citizen and had to give up his military command and his triumph. When his intrigues to obtain an exemption caused a fuss he gave up the triumph and chose the consulship. There were two other candidates for the consulship, Lucius Lucceius and Marcus Calpurnius Bibulus. Caesar made entreaties to the former because he was rich and could treat the electorate with largesse. The aristocracy funded Calpurnius Bibulus for his electoral canvassing because he was a staunch opponent of Caesar. He would keep Caesar in check. Even Cato the Younger, who was a very upright man, [...] "did not deny that bribery under such circumstances was {{for the good of the}} republic." [...] Bibulus was elected. Normally the new consuls were assigned important areas of military command. Instead, these two consuls were assigned [...] "mere woods and pastures." [...] This was another measure intended to keep Caesar in check. Caesar was angry about 'this slight'. Thus, he tried hard to win over Pompey, who was aggrieved at the senate for not ratifying the settlements he made after winning the Third Mithridatic War. He succeeded, patched up the relationship between Crassus and Pompey and [...] "made a compact with both of them that <b>no</b> <b>step</b> should be taken in public affairs which did not suit any one of the three." ...|$|E
