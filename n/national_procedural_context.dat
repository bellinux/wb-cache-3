40|$|From the Introduction. By {{virtue of}} Council Regulation No. 1 / 2003, as of 1 st May 2004 the full {{application}} of EC competition law will be entrusted to national competition authorities (hereinafter NCAs) and national courts. The bold reform of EC competition law enforcement adheres {{to the system}} of executive federalism 1 which characterises the EC legal system. The repartition of competences within the Community allocates implementation of Community law mainly at Member States level. Pursuant to Article 10 EC, {{they are responsible for}} the implementation of the measures which have been adopted at Community level for the achievement of the objectives specified in the EC Treaty. Consequently, the attainment of the Community objectives depends very much upon the cooperation of national authorities, which act in accordance with their own <b>national</b> <b>procedural</b> rules. 2 The various <b>national</b> <b>procedural</b> rules present themselves as conduits through which Community law is implemented and enforced. While as a rule Community law is not designed to alter <b>national</b> <b>procedural</b> rules, the Community legal order cannot afford to leave <b>national</b> <b>procedural</b> rules untouched when they are liable to hamper the effective application of Community law [...] For reason of space, this contribution intends only to highlight some aspects of Regulation No. 1 / 2003 with regard to which general principles of Community law are able to condition <b>national</b> <b>procedural</b> rules...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{relationship}} between the so called ‘procedural autonomy’ of the Member States {{on the one hand and}} the principles of effectiveness and effective judicial protection in the European Community law on the other. In Rewe and Comet judgments the ECJ holds that the creation of individual rights is a matter of Community law, while the remedies for the enforcement of these rights are - in the absence of relevant Community legal provisions - to be provided by <b>national</b> (<b>procedural)</b> law. In this context, it is obvious that the effectiveness of Community rights depends on <b>national</b> <b>procedural</b> rules. However, this <b>national</b> <b>procedural</b> autonomy is restricted by two important requirements: firstly, such rules are not less favourable than those governing similar domestic actions (the principle of equivalence) and secondly, they do not render the exercise of Community rights virtually impossible or excessively difficult (the principle of effectiveness). Recent European legislative interventions in procedural matters show that the concept of <b>national</b> <b>procedural</b> and institutional autonomy of the Member States no longer explains the very complicated relationship between the European substantive law and <b>national</b> <b>procedural</b> rules. This is rather a question of division of competences in procedural matters between the Member States and Communities and procedural harmonization than the somewhat obscure concept of autonomy. On the other hand, the principle o f effectiveness starts to play a crucial role in the protection of individual Community rights in national courts, so that it replaces the principle of primacy of Community law in those matters. However, the ECJ has developed the principle of effective judicial protection, which has received the rank of a fundamental Community legal principle. This principle can be regarded as more appropriate than the former one, to protect Community rights at the national level and within <b>national</b> <b>procedural</b> competences...|$|R

40|$|The {{principle}} of <b>national</b> <b>procedural</b> autonomy stipulates that Member states {{are free to}} {{set up their own}} (procedural) rules (and remedies therein) which govern the enforcement of EU law. However, Member states do not enjoy thorough autonomy in doing so, since they are (primarily) limited with the {{principle of}} effectiveness and the principle of equivalence. Because the array of procedural rules is vast and diversified throughout administrative, civil and criminal law, {{it comes as no surprise}} that the actual scope of procedural autonomy differs signifi cantly from one issue to another. Academic discourse has occasionally tackled with the fractured scope of procedural autonomy, attempting to defi ne the principle and its internal workings in various ways, while some authors have even gone so far as to deny its very existence. In this article, the author avoids the pursuit of a unified conceptualization of the subject-matter. Rather, the article fully embraces the fragmented reality of procedural autonomy and ascribes it to the particularities stemming from the demanding goals of procedural law. The article provides the reader with a brief, yet fairly concise descriptive presentation on the current state of play in regards to the understanding of the principle of <b>national</b> <b>procedural</b> autonomy and reinforces the need for pursuing a balanced approach to the principle and its limitations...|$|R

40|$|Regulation 1896 / 2006 {{does not}} provide for {{effective}} debtor protection in cases when a European Order for Payment was not properly served on the debtor. As {{a result of the}} unilateral nature of the procedure for issuing the order, the order will be declared enforceable if the defendant does not challenge it within a period of 30 days. However, the service of the payment order shall safeguard the right to a defense. When the defendant has never been informed about the ongoing procedure, {{he should be able to}} easily contest the Order for Payment even after it has been declared enforceable. Yet, the text of the Regulation {{does not provide}} for a remedy in this situation. In a reference for a preliminary ruling, the Local Court Berlin-Wedding asked the European Court of Justice which remedy should apply. The referring court suggested an application by analogy of the review proceedings provided for in Article 20 of Regulation 1896 / 2006 in order to ensure an effective right to a defense.

40|$|While {{harmonization}} and {{convergence of}} national substantive laws are well advanced in the European Union, a similar convergence and harmonization of the procedural rules and institutional frameworks {{has not taken}} place. The implementation, supervision, and enforcement of EU law are left to the Member States {{in accordance with the}} so-called <b>national</b> <b>procedural</b> and institutional autonomy. This "procedural competence" of the Member States means that the Member States have to provide remedies and procedures governing actions intended to ensure the enforcement of rights derived from EU law. Harmonized substantive rules are implemented through diverging procedures and different kinds of enforcement bodies, but this decentralized enforcement challenges the coherent and uniform application of EU law. In an enforcement system where Member States apply divergent procedures, may impose a variety of sanctions and remedies administered by various actors the effectiveness of EU law, effective judicial protection and effective law administration may be at risk. This chapter analyzes the development of EU law concerning law enforcement and takes a critical look at the EU’s aim to harmonize the <b>national</b> <b>procedural</b> rules when EU law is enforced. It will examine the question of which legal basis can be used in order to harmonize procedural rules, whether harmonizing procedural rules would be more efficient than the existing legal diversity and the economics of harmonization will be applied to assess the top-down harmonization by the EU and comparative law, and economics is applied to evaluate the bottom-up voluntary harmonization of the Member States...|$|R

Appeals or review functions are performed either by other independent administrative bodies or the courts. In the classic regulatory agencies the opposite was the case.

40|$|Background: The Plastic Surgery In-Service Training Exam (PSITE) is a multiple-choice {{examination}} {{taken by}} plastic surgery trainees {{to provide an}} as-sessment of plastic surgery knowledge. Objective: The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate cosmetic questions and determine overlap with <b>national</b> <b>procedural</b> data. Methods: Digital syllabi of six consecutive PSITE administrations (2008 - 2013) were analyzed for cosmetic surgery topics. Questions were classified by taxonomy, focus, anatomy, and procedure. Answer references were tabulated by source. Relationships between tested material and <b>national</b> <b>procedural</b> volume were assessed via Pearson correlation. Results: 301 questions addressed cosmetic topics (26 % of all questions) and 20 required image interpretations (7 %). Question-stem taxonomy favored decision-making (40 %) and recall (37 %) skills over interpretation (23 %, P <. 001). Answers focused on treatments/outcomes (67 %) over pathology/ anatomy (20 %) and diagnoses (13 %, P <. 001). Tested procedures were largely surgical (85 %) and focused on the breast (25 %), body (18 %), nose (13 %), and eye (10 %). The most common surgeries were breast augmentation (12 %), rhinoplasty (11 %), blepharoplasty (10 %), and body contouring (6 %). Minimally invasive procedures were lasers (5 %), neuromodulators (4 %), and fillers (3 %). Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (58 %), Clinics in Plastic Surgery (7 %), and Aesthetic Surgery Journal (6 %) were the most cited journals, with a median 5 -year publication lag. There was poor correlation between PSITE content and procedural volume data (r 2 = 0. 138, P =. 539). Conclusions: Plastic surgeons receive routine evaluation of cosmetic surgery knowledge.
