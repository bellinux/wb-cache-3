Later in the 1980s, enzymes responsible for initiating the formation of, and binding to, Holliday junctions were identified, although as of 2004 the identification of mammalian Holliday junction resolvases remained elusive (however, see section [...] "Resolution of Holliday junctions," [...] above for more recent information). In 1983, artificial Holliday junction molecules were first constructed from synthetic oligonucleotides by Nadrian Seeman, allowing for more direct study of their physical properties. Much of the early analysis of Holliday junction structure was inferred from gel electrophoresis, FRET, and hydroxyl radical and <b>nuclease</b> <b>footprinting</b> studies. In the 1990s, crystallography and nucleic acid NMR methods became available, as well as computational molecular modelling tools.|$|E

Since such sequences {{are known to}} adopt triple stranded-structures under appropriate conditions in vitro, it is of major interest {{to know if they}} occur in vivo, and thus if they can have some biological importance by inducing structural constraints in the genomic DNA. To this end, we have isolated a (TTCCC) 48 sequence, present in the promoter of an avian gene, and tested its ability to form PU-PY-PY and PU-PU-PY triple helices in vitro, through the oligonucleotide gel shift technique and single strand-specific <b>nuclease</b> <b>footprinting.</b> We have then developed an oligonucleotide protection assay, which can be adapted to in vivo investigations.

The drug forms a tight, possibly covalent, complex with the DNA causing a reduction in mobility on nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels and some smearing of the bands consistent with intramolecular cross-linking of DNA duplexes. DNAase I and micrococcal <b>nuclease</b> <b>footprinting</b> experiments suggest that the drug binds best to regions containing alternating A and T residues, although no consensus di- or trinucleotide sequence emerges. Binding to other sites is not excluded and at moderate ligand concentrations the DNA is almost totally protected from enzyme attack.

Orthophenanthroline-copper chemical <b>nuclease</b> <b>footprinting</b> with purified protein has identified high-affinity binding sites for mu EBP-E within the IgH enhancer at the previously identified site E and at sites within IgH promoters {{and in the}} kappa light-chain enhancer. Equilibrium binding studies indicate that the dissociation constants for mu EBP-E binding to site E within the enhancer and to a binding site within the V 1 heavy-chain promoter are quite low, about 2 x 10 (- 11) M.

By means of South-western blotting experiments, we mapped the binding site to a 222 -nucleotide motif within the non-structural transcription unit, {{referred to as}} NUBE (nucleolin-binding element). The specificity of the interaction was confirmed by competitive gel retardation assays. DNaseI and nuclease S 1 probing showed that NUBE folds into a secondary structure, in agreement with a computer-assisted conformational prediction. The whole NUBE may be necessary for the interaction with nucleolin, {{as suggested by the}} failure of NUBE subfragments to bind the protein and by the <b>nuclease</b> <b>footprinting</b> experiments. The present work extends the previously reported ability of nucleolin to form a specific complex with ribosomal RNA, to a defined DNA substrate. Considering the tropism of MVMp DNA replication for host cell nucleoli, these data raise the possibility that nucleolin may contribute to the regulation of the parvoviral life-cycle...|$|E
40|$|Human SWI/SNF (hSWI/SNF) is an {{evolutionarily}} conserved ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complex {{required for}} transcriptional regulation and cell cycle control. The regulatory functions of hSWI/SNF are correlated with {{its ability to}} create a stable, altered form of chromatin that constrains fewer negative supercoils than normal. Our current studies indicate that this change in supercoiling {{is due to the}} conversion of up to one-half of the nucleosomes on polynucleosomal arrays into asymmetric structures, termed “altosomes,” each composed of two histone octamers and bearing an asymmetrically located region of nuclease-accessible DNA. Altosomes can be formed on chromatin containing the abundant mammalian linker histone H 1 and have a unique micrococcal <b>nuclease</b> digestion <b>footprint</b> that allows their position and abundance on any DNA sequence to be measured.

Amino acid starvation does not cause loss of Rap 1 p from the complex; however, in vivo UV-footprinting reveals the occurrence of structural modifications of the complex. Moreover, low-resolution micrococcal nuclease digestion shows that the chromatin of the entire region is devoid of positioned nucleosomes but is susceptible to changes in accessibility to the nuclease upon amino acid starvation. The implications of these results for the mechanism of Rap 1 p action are discussed. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Functional {{interactions}} between gene regulatory factors and chromatin architecture {{have been difficult}} to directly assess. Here, we use micrococcal <b>nuclease</b> (MNase) <b>footprinting</b> to probe the functions of two chromatin-remodeling complexes. By simultaneously quantifying alterations in small MNase footprints over the binding sites of 30 regulatory factors in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs), we provide evidence that esBAF and Mbd 3 /NuRD modulate the binding of several regulatory proteins. In addition, we find that nucleosome occupancy is reduced at specific loci in favor of subnucleosomes upon depletion of esBAF, including sites of histone H 2 A. Z localization. Consistent with these data, we demonstrate that esBAF is required for normal H 2 A. Z localization in ESCs, suggesting esBAF either stabilizes H 2 A. Z-containing nucleosomes or promotes subnucleosome to nucleosome conversion by facilitating H 2 A. Z deposition. Therefore, integrative examination of MNase footprints reveals insights into nucleosome dynamics and functional {{interactions between}} chromatin structure and key gene-regulatory factors...|$|R

Five (Rpp 20, Rpp 21, Rpp 25, Rpp 29 and Pop 5) out of eight of these protein subunits, prepared in refolded recombinant forms, bind to H 1 RNA in vitro. Rpp 20 and Rpp 25 bind jointly to H 1 RNA, even though each protein can interact independently with this transcript. <b>Nuclease</b> <b>footprinting</b> analysis reveals that Rpp 20 and Rpp 25 recognize overlapping regions in the P 2 and P 3 domains of H 1 RNA. Rpp 21 and Rpp 29, which are sufficient for reconstitution of the endonucleolytic activity, bind to separate regions in the catalytic domain of H 1 RNA. Common themes and discrepancies in the RNA-protein interactions between human nuclear RNase P and its related yeast and archaeal counterparts provide a rationale for the assembly of the fully active form of this enzyme...|$|E
40|$|Vaccinia DNA topoisomerase binds duplex DNA {{and forms}} a {{covalent}} adduct at sites containing a conserved sequence element 5 '(C/T) CCTT decreases in the scissile strand. Distinctive aspects of noncovalent versus covalent interaction emerge from {{analysis of the}} binding properties of Topo(Phe- 274), a mutated protein which is unable to cleave DNA, but which binds DNA noncovalently. Whereas DNA cleavage by wild type enzyme is most efficient with 'suicide' substrates containing fewer than 10 base pairs distal to the scissile bond, optimal noncovalent binding by Topo(Phe- 274) requires at least 10 -bp of DNA 3 ' of the cleavage site. Thus, the region of DNA flanking the pentamer motif serves to stabilize the noncovalent topoisomerase-DNA complex. This result {{is consistent with the}} downstream dimensions of the DNA binding site deduced from <b>nuclease</b> <b>footprinting.</b> Topo(Phe- 274) binds to duplex DNA lacking the consensus pentamer with 7 - 10 -fold lower affinity than to CCCTT-containing DNA...|$|E
40|$|The phage Mu C {{gene product}} is a {{specific}} activator of Mu late gene transcription, including activation of the mom operon. Fusion of the C gene to the efficient translation initiation region of the Escherichia coli atpE gene allowed significant overproduction of C protein, which was subsequently purified and assayed for DNA binding by gel retardation and <b>nuclease</b> <b>footprinting</b> techniques. C protein binds to a site immediately upstream of the - 35 region both of the mom promoter and the related phage D 108 mod promoter. The location of the mom promoter has been determined by primer extension. Upstream deletions extending more than 3 base pairs into the C-binding site abolished activation of the mom promoter in vivo.

We have developed various ligation-mediated PCR approaches to analyze mRNAs, all relying on RNA ligation, followed by reverse-transcription and PCR amplification. We have termed these approaches reverse-ligation-mediated PCR (RL-PCR). The ligation event involves either an RNA linker added to the 5 '-end of cleaved RNA or RNA circularization, allowing, respectively, the mapping and quantification of the cleavage points or the simultaneous analysis of the presence or absence of the 5 '-cap structure and the length of the poly(A) tail. These methods enabled us to develop a very efficient 5 '-RACE procedure to map mRNA 5 '-ends, to footprint in permeabilized cells the interaction of regulatory proteins with RNA, to detect the products of cellular ribozyme action and to analyze cellular decay pathways that involve deadenylation and/or decapping.

40|$|Guanine-rich DNAs can fold into four-stranded {{structures}} that contain stacks of G-quartets. Bioinformatics studies {{have revealed that}} G-rich sequences {{with the potential to}} adopt these structures are unevenly distributed throughout genomes, and are especially found in gene promoter regions. With the exception of the single-stranded telomeric DNA, all genomic G-rich sequences will always be present along with their C-rich complements, and quadruplex formation will be in competition with the corresponding Watson-Crick duplex. Quadruplex formation must therefore first require local dissociation (melting) of the duplex strands. Since negative supercoiling is known to facilitate the formation of alternative DNA structures, we have investigated G-quadruplex formation within negatively supercoiled DNA plasmids. Plasmids containing multiple copies of (G 3 T) n and (G 3 T 4) n repeats, were probed with dimethylsulphate, potassium permanganate, and S 1 <b>nuclease.</b> While dimethylsulphate <b>footprinting</b> revealed some evidence for G-quadruplex formation in (G 3 T) n sequences, this was not affected by supercoiling, and permanganate failed to detect exposed thymines in the loop regions. (G 3 T 4) n sequences were not protected from DMS and showed no reaction with permanganate. Similarly, both S 1 nuclease and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of DNA topoisomers did not detect any supercoil-dependent structural transitions.

The cleavage {{activity of the}} parent complex, Cu(phen) 2, occurs according to the following mechanism: a) reduction of Cu(phen) 22 + to Cu(phen) 2 +; b) non-coordinative binding of Cu(phen) 2 + to DNA; c) Cu(phen) 2 + oxidation to Cu(phen) 22 + by H 2 O 2, and formation of Cu-“oxo” and/or Cu-“hydroxyl” species; d) oxidative attack leading to DNA-cleavage. However, the potential clinical use of the parent compound is mainly prevented by two drawbacks: i) the low binding constant of the second phenanthroline; ii) the modest sequence selective DNA cleavage. To improve Cu(phen) 2 efficiency, Pitié et al. used a serinol bridge to link the two phen rings leading to Cu(2 -Clip-phen) and Cu(3 -Clip-phen) derivatives, which cleave the DNA 2 and 60 times more efficiently than Cu(phen) 2. To address the modest sequence selectivity, the amine group of the serinol bridge was functionalized with sequence specific DNA minor/major-groove binding ligands such as cisplatin- and distamycin-like compounds, leading to encouraging results. In this work, a combination of theoretical methods, including DFT, Docking and Molecular Dynamics, was employed to i) characterize the DNA binding of these complexes and ii) to determine the origin of their diverse DNA-cleavage efficiency. Our simulations clearly revealed that several factors such as planarity of the ligand, better interaction with DNA and minor-groove fit, contribute to the enhanced efficiency of Cu(3 -Clip-phen) {{compared to the other}} structurally similar complexes...|$|R

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the role of}} the herpes simplex virus origin-binding protein (UL 9) in the initiation of DNA replication, we have examined the effect of UL 9 binding on the structure of the viral origin of replication. UL 9 loops and alters the DNA helix of the origin regardless of the phasing of the binding sites. DNase I and micrococcal <b>nuclease</b> <b>footprinting</b> show that UL 9 binds two sites in the origin and loops the AT-rich DNA between them independent of the topology of the DNA. KMnO 4 and dimethyl sulfate footprinting further show that UL 9 alters the DNA helix in the AT region. In contrast to the looping reaction, however, helical distortion requires the free energy of supercoiled DNA. UL 9 also loops and distorts the origin DNA of a replication-defective mutant with a 6 -bp insertion in the AT region. Because the helical distortion of this mutant DNA is different from that of functional origins, we conclude that an imperfect tertiary structure of the mutant DNA may contribute to its loss of replication function...|$|E

Here we show that hairpin formation exhibits more stringent DNA sequence requirements at the terminal two base pairs than either transpososome assembly or first strand nicking. We also observe a significant DNA distortion at the terminal base pairs upon transpososome assembly by chemical <b>nuclease</b> <b>footprinting.</b> Interest ingly, mutations at these positions do not necessarily inhibit {{the formation of}} the distortion. However, it remains a possibility that the inhibitory effect of these mutations is due to a defect in protein–DNA interactions subsequent to this deformation. Terminal base pair mutations also inhibited strand transfer, providing evidence that transposase interactions with the terminal residues on both ‘transferred’ and ‘non-transferred’ strands are important for hairpin formation. We also demonstrate that mutation of a highly conserved tyrosine residue that is a component of the YREK motif, Y 285, results in a phenotype comparable to that of the terminal base pair mutations. In contrast, a mutation at another conserved position, W 265, is shown to relax the specificity of the hairpin formation reaction...|$|E
40|$|Hexameric helicases are processive DNA {{unwinding}} machines but {{how they}} engage with a replication fork during unwinding is unknown. Using electron microscopy and single particle analysis we determined {{structures of the}} intact hexameric helicase E 1 from papillomavirus and two complexes of E 1 bound to a DNA replication fork end-labelled with protein tags. By labelling a DNA replication fork with streptavidin (dsDNA end) and Fab (5 ′ ssDNA) we located the positions of these labels on the helicase surface, showing that at least 10 bp of dsDNA enter the E 1 helicase via a side tunnel. In the currently accepted ‘steric exclusion’ model for dsDNA unwinding, the active 3 ′ ssDNA strand is pulled through a central tunnel of the helicase motor domain as the dsDNA strands are wedged apart outside the protein assembly. Our structural observations together with <b>nuclease</b> <b>footprinting</b> assays indicate otherwise: strand separation is taking place inside E 1 in a chamber above the helicase domain and the 5 ′ passive ssDNA strands exits the assembly through a separate tunnel opposite to the dsDNA entry point.

Gp 5 polymerizes nucleotides with low processivity, dissociating after the incorporation of 1 to 50 nucleotides. Thioredoxin (trx) of Escherichia coli binds tightly (Kd =  5  nM) to a unique segment in the thumb subdomain of gp 5 and increases processivity. We have probed the molecular basis for the increase in processivity. A single-molecule experiment reveals differences in rates of enzymatic activity and processivity between gp 5 and gp 5 /trx. Small angle X-ray scattering studies combined with <b>nuclease</b> <b>footprinting</b> reveal two conformations of gp 5, one {{in the free state}} and one upon binding to trx. Comparative analysis of the DNA binding clefts of DNA polymerases and DNA binding proteins show that the binding surface contains more hydrophobic residues than other DNA binding proteins. The balanced composition between hydrophobic and charged residues of the binding site allows for efficient sliding of gp 5 /trx on the DNA. We propose a model for trx-induced conformational changes in gp 5 that enhance the processivity by increasing the interaction of gp 5 with DNA...|$|E

Brf 1 is a modular protein: Its N-proximal half is related to TFIIB and binds similarly to the C-terminal stirrup of TBP; its C-proximal one-third provides most of the affinity for TBP by binding along {{the entire length of}} the convex surface and N-terminal lateral face of TBP. A structure-informed triple fusion protein, with TBP core placed between the N- and C-proximal domains of Brf 1, has been constructed. The Brf 1 -TBP triple fusion protein effectively replaces both Brf 1 and TBP in TFIIIC-dependent and -independent transcription in vitro, and forms extremely stable TFIIIB–DNA complexes that are indistinguishable from wild-type TFIIIB–DNA complexes by chemical <b>nuclease</b> <b>footprinting.</b> Unlike Brf 1 and TBP, the triple fusion protein is able to recruit pol III for TATA box-directed transcription of linear and supercoiled DNA in the absence of Bdp 1.

40|$|AbstractIn mammals, {{a subset}} of genes inherit gametic marks that {{establish}} parent of origin-dependent expression patterns in the soma ([1] and references therein). The currently most extensively studied examples of this phenomenon, termed genomic imprinting, are the physically linked Igf 2 (insulin-like growth factor II) and H 19 genes, which are expressed mono-allelically from opposite parental alleles [1, 2]. The repressed status of the maternal Igf 2 allele is due to cis elements that prevent the H 19 enhancers [3] from accessing the Igf 2 promoters on the maternal chromosome [4, 5]. A differentially methylated domain (DMD) in the 5 ′ flank of H 19 is maintained paternally methylated and maternally unmethylated [6, 7]. We show here by gel-shift and chromatin immunopurification analyses that binding of the highly conserved multivalent factor CTCF ([8, 9] and references therein) to the H 19 DMD is methylation-sensitive and parent of origin-dependent. Selectively mutating CTCF-contacting nucleotides, which were identified by methylation interference within the extended binding sites initially revealed by <b>nuclease</b> <b>footprinting,</b> abrogated the H 19 DMD enhancer-blocking property. These observations suggest that molecular mechanisms of genomic imprinting may use an unusual ability of CTCF to interact with a diverse spectrum of variant target sites, some of which include CpGs {{that are responsible for}} methylation-sensitive CTCF binding in vitro and in vivo...|$|E

Sun and G. N. Godson, J. Biol. Chem. 268 : 8026 - 8039, 1993). Using a small 278 -nucleotide (nt) G 4 ori(c) single-stranded DNA fragment that supported primer RNA synthesis, we now demonstrate by gel shift that E. coli primase can stably interact with the SSB-G 4 ori(c) complex. This stable interaction requires Mg 2 + for specificity. At 8 mM Mg 2 +, primase binds to an SSB-coated 278 -nt G 4 ori(c) fragment but not to an SSB-coated control 285 -nt LacZ ss-DNA fragment. In the absence of Mg 2 +, primase binds to both SSB-coated fragments and gives a gel shift. T 4 gene 32 protein cannot substitute for E. coli SSB in this reaction. Stable interaction of primase with naked G 4 ori(c). single-stranded DNA was not observed. DNase I and micrococcal <b>nuclease</b> <b>footprinting,</b> of both 5 ' and 3 ' 32 P-labeled DNA, demonstrated that primase interacts with two regions of G 4 ori(c) : one covering stem-loop I and the 3 ' sequence flanking stem-loop I which contains the pRNA initiation site and another located on the 5 ' sequence flanking stem-loop III...|$|E
40|$|The {{contribution}} of the ribose 2 '-hydroxyls to RNA structure and function has been analyzed, but still remains controversial. In this work, we report {{the use of a}} mutant T 7 RNA polymerase as a tool in RNA studies, applied to the aspartate and methionine tRNA aminoacylation systems from yeast. Our approach consists of determining the effect of substituting natural ribonucleotides by deoxyribonucleotides in RNA and, thereby, defining the subset of important 2 '-hydroxyl groups. We show that deoxyribose-containing RNA can be folded in a global conformation similar to that of natural RNA. Melting curves of tRNAs, obtained by temperature-gradient gel electrophoresis, indicate that in deoxyribo-containing molecules, the thermal stability of the tertiary network drops down, whereas the stability of the secondary structure remains unaltered. <b>Nuclease</b> <b>footprinting</b> reveals {{a significant increase in the}} accessibility of both single- and double-stranded regions. As to the functionality of the deoxyribose-containing tRNAs, their in vitro aminoacylation efficiency indicates striking differential effects depending upon the nature of the substituted ribonucleotides. Strongest decrease in charging occurs for yeast initiator tRNA(Met) transcripts containing dG or dC residues and for yeast tRNA(Asp) transcripts with dU or dG. In the aspartate system, the decreased aminoacylation capacities can be correlated with the substitution of the ribose moieties of U 11 and G 27, disrupting two hydrogen bond contacts with the synthetase. Altogether, this suggests that specific 2 '-hydroxyl groups in tRNAs can act as determinants specifying aminoacylation identity...|$|E

We mapped the glucocorticoid response element that conferred this hormonal regulation {{and found that it}} is a hormone-dependent transcriptional enhancer, designated Sg; it resides within DNA fragments that also carry a previously described enhancer element (B. Levinson, G. Khoury, G. Vande Woude, and P. Gruss, Nature [London] 295 : 568 - 572, 1982), here termed Sa, whose activity is independent of the hormone. <b>Nuclease</b> <b>footprinting</b> revealed that purified glucocorticoid receptor bound at multiple discrete sites within and at the borders of the tandemly repeated sequence motif that defines Sa. The Sa and Sg activities stimulated the apparent efficiency of cognate or heterologous promoter utilization, individually providing modest enhancement and in concert yielding higher levels of activity. A deletion mutant lacking most of the tandem repeat but retaining a single receptor footprint sequence lost Sa activity but still conferred Sg activity. The two enhancer components could also be distinguished physiologically: both were operative within cultured rat fibroblasts, but only Sg activity was detectable in rat exocrine pancreas cells. Therefore, the sequence determinants of Sa and Sg activity may be interdigitated, and when both components are active, the receptor and a putative Sa factor can apparently bind and act simultaneously. We concluded that MoMSV enhancer activity is effected by at least two distinct binding factors, suggesting that combinatorial regulation of promoter function can be mediated even from a single genetic element...|$|E
40|$|Escherichia coli topoisomerase I (TopA), a {{regulator}} {{of global}} and local DNA supercoiling, is modified by Nε-Lysine acetylation. The sirtuin protein deacetylase CobB can reverse both enzymatic and non-enzymatic lysine acetylation modifications. Here, we explored {{the effect of}} lysine acetylation on E. coli topoisomerase I through analysis of TopA relaxation activity and protein expression in cell extract of wild-type and a ΔcobB mutant strains. We showed {{that the absence of}} deacetylase CobB in a ΔcobB mutant reduced intracellular TopA relaxation activity while elevating TopA expression and topA gene transcripts levels. Acetyl phosphate mediated lysine acetylation decreased the activity of purified TopA in vitro, and the interaction with purified CobB protected TopA from such inactivation. We explored the physiological significance of TopA acetylation on DNA supercoiling by two-dimensional gel analysis and on cell growth rate by growth curve analysis. We found that the absence of CobB increased negative DNA supercoiling. The slow growth phenotype of the ∆cobB mutant can be partially compensated by overexpression of recombinant TopA. In addition, the specific activity of TopA expressed from His-tagged fusion construct in the chromosome was inversely proportional to the degree of in vivo lysine acetylation during growth transition and growth arrest. Investigation of TopA relaxation mechanism using <b>nuclease</b> <b>footprinting</b> and TopA oxidative crosslinking suggested the potential association of TopA acetylation in catalysis. Mass spectrometry analysis of in vitro acetyl phosphate acetylated TopA identified abundant lysine acetylation sites. Substitution of lysine residues by site-directed mutagenesis was used to model the effect of acetylation on individual lysine residues. Our results showed that substitution of Lys- 484 with alanine reduced the relaxation activity, suggesting the reduction of TopA relaxation activity by acetylation was probably in part due to acetylation on Lys- 484. These findings demonstrate that E. coli topoisomerase I is modulated by lysine acetylation and the prevention of TopA inactivation from excess lysine acetylation and consequent increase in negative DNA supercoiling is an important physiological function of the sirtuin deacetylase CobB...|$|E

CRC carcinogenesis progression is based in a continuous accumulation of genetic alterations that leads to variations in the overall gene expression profiles [2].

40|$|Colorectal cancer (CRC) is {{a serious}} health problem due to its high {{incidence}} and mortality rates despite the major advances in cancer therapeutic approaches [1]. CRC carcinogenesis progression is based in a continuous accumulation of genetic alterations that leads to variations in the overall gene expression profiles [2].

Alternative (non-B type) DNA structures are thought to be formed as intermediates in developmentally important mechanisms such as DNA replication, DNA repair, and genetic recombination. It is proposed that these alternative DNA structure(s) and the proteins that recognize them may {{play an important role in}} the regulation of cellular mechanisms. There has been an enhancement in the knowledge of proteins that bind to the DNA by recognizing specific sequence and/or structural aspects of the DNA. lsRFC (large subunit Replication Factor C) is a protein that binds to the DNA in a sequence independent manner and recognizes structural determinant(s) in the DNA structure. lsRFC is an essential part of the five subunit RFC complex involved in the process of eukaryotic DNA replication. RFC complex loads PCNA and DNA polymerase delta onto the replication template during replication and is required both for leading and lagging strand synthesis. Southwestern analyses using synthetic oligonucleotides containing internal complementary sequences to form DNA structures reveal that structural determinants present in the branched DNA structures are most strongly bound by lsRFC. Osmium tetroxide chemical modification of these synthetic DNA structures verifies the formation of the predicted branched structures. Tsurimoto and Stillman (I 99 1) used DNase and micrococcal <b>nuclease</b> <b>footprinting</b> assays to define a primer template junction as a substrate for the RFC complex binding. A synthetic primer-template junction is bound by lsRFC in nitrocellulose filter binding (Southwestern) assays; however, it is bound approximately five fold less efficiently than branched DNA structures but better than single stranded DNA or duplex DNA. This suggests that HP 96 contains a determinant that is preferentially recognized by lsRFC. To investigate the determinant present, chemical probing using osmium tetroxide was performed and reveals either single strand or distorted duplex nature at the proposed primer template junction. Based on the Southwestern assays and the chemical modification data, it is proposed that lsRFC preferentially recognizes and binds angles or bends in the DNA and may recognize the replication fork formed at the junction between parental and daughter strands. This proposed intimate association of lsRFC with the replication fork may influence the progression of the fork...|$|E
40|$|Cosmomycin D (CosD) is an {{anthracycline}} that possesses two trisaccharide chains {{bound to}} its aglycone. This glycosylation pattern is substantially {{different from that}} of anthracyclines used in the clinic such as daunomycin (Dn) and doxorubicin (Dx). A purification method for CosD from culture supernatants of Streptomyces olindensis ICB 20 previously genetically engineered to overproduce CosD was developed. When the bacteria cultures were propagated for several generations, in addition to CosD, different anthracyclines appeared in the crude extracts, most likely as a result of spontaneous mutations. Characterisation by mass spectrometry showed that these anthracyclines were related to CosD in that they had two trisaccharide chains. The sequences of sugars bound to the aglycones were determined by collisionally-activated dissociation using an electrospray ionisation (ESI) quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer. Some of the anthracyclines had the same mass but had different HPLC elution times using a C 4 column. For example, several compounds differed from CosD by the mass of an hydroxyl group. This project coincided with the commercial release of an ESI quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer equipped with a travelling wave ion mobility cell (TWIMS). Some of the isobaric anthracyclines could be resolved by TWIMS providing another example of the types of molecules that can be separated by this ion mobility method. Furthermore, the sequence of the sugars was also determined by fragmentation of the anthracyclines using the TWIMS cell and the results compared to those obtained with the ion trap instrument. Since only small amounts of CosD could be obtained, the sensitivity of mass spectrometry (MS) was exploited in several different ways to characterise its interaction with DNA. ESI mass spectrometry was used to screen the binding of CosD to doublestranded (ds) DNA. The DNA was saturated with CosD at lower concentrations than Dn and Dx. Fewer molecules of CosD were able to bind to DNA suggesting a larger footprint, and all complexes formed with CosD were more stable than those obtained for Dn and Dx. <b>Nuclease</b> <b>footprinting</b> experiments analysed by mass spectrometry showed that CosD was able to protect the DNA {{to a greater extent than}} Dn and Dx consistent with the binding profiles for the DNA sequences. Titration mixtures of dsDNA with increasing amounts of CosD were also analysed by agarose gel electrophoresis (plasmid DNA and 16 mer DNA) and CD spectroscopy (16 mer DNA) to complement the ESIMS studies. Both techniques revealed that a greater change was induced on the DNA conformation upon binding of CosD than for Dn and Dx; this change was most likely caused by partial unwinding of the DNA double-helix upon binding (intercalation) of the drug molecule. In vitro RNA transcription assays showed that CosD was more effective in inhibiting RNA production than Dn and Dx. All the experiments carried out here support that CosD binds more tightly to DNA, exerts a larger footprint on DNA, and has a greater ability to perturb the DNA conformation than Dn and Dx. Since CosD was a purified natural product available only in milligram quantities, synthesis of its aglycone, b-rhodomycinone, was attempted using Dn as starting material owing to the similarity of the aglycone of CosD and Dn. Sugar removal and functional group modification led to the unexpected synthesis of a novel compound, necessitating the devising of an alternative synthetic route. Although the synthesis of the aglycone was not completed owing to time restraints, the DNA-binding studies of the synthesised intermediate compounds were carried out and confirmed the importance of the sugars in DNA-binding. This is the first comprehensive DNA-binding study of CosD. Early studies of CosD showed that it induced differentiation in mouse leukemia cells. This effect was not observed for Dn and Dx. The different effects of CosD on cells related to its structure are yet to be fully investigated. The difference from Dn and Dx may lead to a new chemotherapeutic agent, or alternatively, if the effects on cell differentiation are shown to be reproducible, CosD may serve as a tool to be used to study the process of differentiation in cell culture...|$|E
