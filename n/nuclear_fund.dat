40|$|The {{nuclear power}} {{utilities}} must under the Act on the Financing of the Management of Certain Radioactive Waste etc. (1988 : 1597), {{sometimes referred to}} as the “Studsvik Act”, fund 0, 3 öre 1 per kWh produced by utilisation of <b>nuclear</b> power. The <b>funds</b> are held by the Swedish <b>Nuclear</b> Waste <b>Fund.</b> The Swedish parliament has decided that this fee shall cover all expenses for the decontamination and decommissioning of older historic waste that stems from Swedish nuclear installations and research reactors within the original Swedish Nuclear program. The task to inject enough capital into the Swedish <b>Nuclear</b> Waste <b>Fund</b> is vital and crucial for the long-term sustainability of the Swedish financing system. Therefore it is of prime importance that provisions to the fund reflect the future authentic costs of performing the planned tasks to decontaminate and dismantle these older nuclear facilities. Purpose of the project The aim of this applied study has been to describe in a systematic way an appropriate methodological sequence for cost estimation of crucial parameters in decontamination and decommission processes. The work has been limited to older nuclear installations and facilities. Furthermore, it may be envisaged that the process of estimating the parameters of decommissioning {{is one of the main}} issues in preparatory phases of decommissioning processes. The main aim of the presented project has been to present a comprehensive procedure for how to prepare a file of fundamental and qualified input data in the earlier planning phases of decommissioning and capital budgeting of major decommissioning projects. These parameters include inter alia costs, exposures, duration times, amounts of waste, manpower, personnel and equipment needed Nevertheless, SKI ´s standpoint is that all measures that enhance the overall quality of the calculation of fees to the fund are essential research tasks if the studied object or cost item has a significant impact on the funding under the Studsvik Act...|$|R
