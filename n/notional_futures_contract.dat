The paper {{is focused on}} <b>futures</b> <b>contracts</b> of the world most important agricultural commodities.

The conclusion of the paper for participators undertaking the currency risk is following: The relative change of relevant exchange rate is not usually relevant for the calculation of return on speculative operation.

40|$|Recently, {{calendar}} spread <b>futures,</b> <b>futures</b> <b>contracts</b> whose underlying asset {{is the difference}} of two <b>futures</b> <b>contracts</b> with different delivery dates, have been successfully introduced {{for a number of}} financial <b>futures</b> <b>contracts</b> traded on the Chicago Board of Trade.
