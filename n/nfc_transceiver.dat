40|$|This paper {{present a}} {{transceiver}} for NFC (Near Field Communication) using an inductive powered receiver to enable all type of NFC communication modes {{such as the}} passive, active, RW, and RFID modes. Notably, when the external battery has been fully discharged, the RFID mode can be operated through the inductive powered structure. We have analyzed {{the capacity of the}} inductive powered receiver of the <b>NFC</b> <b>transceiver</b> to achieve power from an RF Signal for an RFID mode. To understand the range of power available, we have simulated the harvesting of power from a loop antenna at 13. 56 MHz. The bandwidth of the receiver is designed to range from 106 kbps to 424 kbps even to a 867 kHz subcarrier of 13. 56 MHz RFID tag. Jung-Hyun Cho, Peter H. Cole and Shiho Ki...|$|E
40|$|Near Field Communication (NFC) {{promises}} to boost mobile transactions and payments. Indeed, NFC-enabled devices can emulate smartcards, so allowing payments, loyalty programs, card access, transit passes and other custom services, through a mobile phone. Although many modern mobile devices mount a <b>NFC</b> <b>transceiver,</b> card emulation {{is still a}} rare feature. The main {{reason is that the}} two available card emulation frameworks, namely Card Emulation and Host-based Card Emulation, have known limitations in terms of usability and security (respectively). This paper proposes a novel approach to card emulation called Trusted Host-based Card Emulation (THCE). THCE relies on the Trusted Execution Environment, currently deployed on most of the CPUs for mobile devices, and implements a secure and usable card emulation framework. Through comparisons, we show that THCE overcomes the limitations of the existing solutions. Moreover, we formally verify that the initialization protocol, used to deploy access credentials on a THCE-enabled device, is not vulnerable to known exploits...|$|E
40|$|DE 102008027096 A 1 UPAB: 20091222 NOVELTY - The {{terminal}} unit (1) has a switch element for partial wireless {{transmission of data}} from and/or to a host computer over a network e. g. internet, wireless network, telephone network and portable radio network. An input unit (9) inputs the data and an output unit (6) outputs the data. Data and/or application software are stored in the host computer and are processed in the host computer for operating the {{terminal unit}}. The data produced by the application software is available in a representation format for a representation by the terminal unit. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The input unit is a keyboard, a computer mouse, a touch pad, a touch screen, a graphic tablet, a digitizer pen, a joystick, a game pad, a microphone, a module for position determination, a camera, a scanner and/or a sensor. The output unit is a screen, a loudspeaker, a headphone, a comparable image, a sound reproduction unit and/or a transmitter. The switch element is an infrared data association transceiver, a Bluetooth transceiver, a ZigBee transceiver, a worldwide interoperability for microwave access (Wi-max) transceiver, a digital enhanced cordless telecommunication (DECT) transceiver and/or a near field communication (<b>NFC)</b> <b>transceiver.</b> The wireless network is a digital enhanced cordless telecommunication (DECT) network, a wireless local area network, a global system for mobile communication (GSM) network and universal mobile telecommunications system (UMTS) network. INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are also included for the following: (1) a system for representing data and/or application software contained in a memory of a host computer (2) a method for working on a host-computer using a portable terminal unit. USE - Portable terminal unit e. g. mobile telephone, personal digital assistant (PDA) and laptop computer (all claimed), for use with a host computer i. e. personal desktop computer, provided at home or office of a user for video conferencing, telephoning and/or hearing music. ADVANTAGE - The terminal unit accesses the host computer by wireless connection over large distance. The portable terminal unit does not require special application software and does not serve as memory element, so that data loss is avoided even if the terminal unit is lost. The terminal unit is lightweight and has small size. The terminal unit consumes less energy and is comfortably transportable...|$|E
40|$|<b>NFC</b> tags and <b>transceivers</b> are {{ubiquitous}} {{and well}} supported. Like many academic research groups, the Communication Systems Group CSG of the University of ZÃ¼rich owns many physical devices, which {{are required for}} research and teaching. Traditionally, a printed, human-readable inventory and attached labels {{have been used to}} keep track of these devices. A new inventory approach was developed with the aim of simplifying the data acquisition using an NFC tag-based system supported by an Android application. This approach was implemented, tested, and used productively. However, due to technical difficulties - namely, a poor response of NFC tags on metallic material - the NFCbased inventory system did not simplify data acquisition and consequently, the NFC-based inventory system was changed back to the label-based system...|$|R
