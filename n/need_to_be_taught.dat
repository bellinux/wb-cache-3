25|$|There are {{two basic}} {{entities}} that <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taught</b> (or programmed): positional data and procedure. For example, in a task to move a screw from a feeder to a hole {{the positions of the}} feeder and the hole must first be taught or programmed. Secondly the procedure to get the screw from the feeder to the hole must be programmed along with any I/O involved, for example a signal to indicate when the screw is in the feeder ready to be picked up. The purpose of the robot software is to facilitate both these programming tasks.|$|E
25|$|For example, {{educational}} {{psychologists have}} conducted {{research on the}} instructional applicability of Jean Piaget's theory of development, according to which children mature through four stages of cognitive capability. Piaget hypothesized that children are not capable of abstract logical thought until they are older than about 11 years, and therefore younger children <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taught</b> using concrete objects and examples. Researchers have found that transitions, such as from concrete to abstract logical thought, do not occur {{at the same time}} in all domains. A child may be able to think abstractly about mathematics, but remain limited to concrete thought when reasoning about human relationships. Perhaps Piaget's most enduring contribution is his insight that people actively construct their understanding through a self-regulatory process.|$|E

60|$|I {{was born}} {{so long ago}} that I grew up before the era of gasolene. As a result, I am old-fashioned. I prefer a sail-boat to a motor-boat, and it is my belief that boat-sailing is a finer, more difficult, and {{sturdier}} art than running a motor. Gasolene engines are becoming fool-proof, and while it is unfair to say that any fool can run an engine, {{it is fair to say}} that almost any one can. Not so, when it comes to sailing a boat. More skill, more intelligence, and a vast deal more training are necessary. It is the finest training in the world for boy and youth and man.

6000|$|There are seventy {{thousand}} (and possibly {{one hundred}} thousand) Chinamen on the Pacific coast. There were {{about a thousand}} in Virginia. They were penned into a [...] "Chinese quarter"--a thing which they do not particularly object to, as they are fond of herding together. Their buildings were of wood; usually only one story high, and set thickly together along streets scarcely wide enough for a wagon to pass through. Their quarter was a little removed {{from the rest of}} the town. The chief employment of Chinamen in towns is to wash clothing. They always send a bill, like this below, pinned to the clothes. It is mere ceremony, for it does not enlighten the customer much. Their price for washing was $2.50 per dozen--rather cheaper than white people could afford to wash for at that time. A very common sign on the Chinese houses was: [...] "See Yup, Washer and Ironer"; [...] "Hong Wo, Washer"; [...] "Sam Sing & Ah Hop, Washing." [...] The house servants, cooks, etc., in California and Nevada, were chiefly Chinamen. There were few white servants and no Chinawomen so employed. Chinamen make good house servants, being quick, obedient, patient, quick to learn and tirelessly industrious. They do not <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taught</b> a thing twice, as a general thing. They are imitative. If a Chinaman were to see his master break up a centre table, in a passion, and kindle a fire with it, that Chinaman would be likely to resort to the furniture for fuel forever afterward.|$|E

60|$|What {{the young}} {{need to have}} taught to them in this too little {{cultivated}} region, {{is that they are}} born not mere atoms floating independent and apart for a season through a terraqueous medium, and sucking up as much more than their share of nourishment as they can seize; nor citizens of the world with no more definite duty than to keep their feelings towards all their fellows in a steady simmer of bland complacency; but soldiers in a host, citizens of a polity whose boundaries are not set down in maps, members of a church the handwriting of whose ordinances is not in the hieroglyphs of idle mystery, nor its hope and recompense in the lands beyond death. They <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taught</b> that they owe a share of their energies to the great struggle which is in ceaseless progress in all societies in an endless variety of forms, between new truth and old prejudice, between love of self or class and solicitous passion for justice, between the obstructive indolence and inertia of the many and the generous mental activity of the few. This is the sphere and definition of the social conscience. The good causes of enlightenment and justice in all lands,--here is the church militant in which we should early seek to enrol the young, and the true state to which they should be taught that they owe the duties of active and arduous citizenship. These are the struggles with which the modern instructor should associate those virtues of fortitude, tenacity, silent patience, outspoken energy, readiness to assert ourselves and readiness to efface ourselves, willingness to suffer and resolution to inflict suffering, which men of old knew how to show for their gods or their sovereign. But the ideal of Emilius was an ideal of quietism; to possess his own soul in patience, with a suppressed intelligence, a suppressed sociality, without a single spark of generous emulation in the courses of strong-fibred virtue, or a single thrill of heroical pursuit after so much as one great forlorn cause.|$|E
6000|$|That {{is a hard}} {{lesson to}} learn and practise, though not a very {{difficult}} one to understand. I will try now to make you understand it--God alone can teach you to practise it. I pray and hope, and I believe too, that He will--that these very hard times are meant to teach people REALLY to believe in God and Jesus Christ, and that they WILL teach people. God knows we need, and thanks be to Him that He DOES know that we <b>need,</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>taught</b> to believe in Him. Nothing shows it to me more plainly than the way we talk about God's visitations, as if God was usually away from us, and came to us only just now and then--only on extraordinary occasions. People have gross, heathen, fleshly, materialist notions of God's visitations, as if He was some great earthly king who now and then made a journey about his dominions from place to place, rewarding some and punishing others. God is not in any place, my friends. God is a Spirit. The heaven and the heaven of heavens could not contain Him if He wanted a place to be in, as, glory be to His name, He does not. If He is near us or far from us, {{it is not that}} He is near or far from our bodies, as the Queen might be nearer to us in London than in Scotland, which is most people's notion of God's nearness. He is near, not our bodies, but our spirits, our souls, our hearts, our thoughts--as it is written, [...] "The kingdom of God is WITHIN you." [...] Do not fancy that when the cholera was in India, God was nearer India than He was to England, and that as the cholera crawled nearer and nearer, God came nearer and nearer too; and that now the cholera is gone away somewhere or other, God is gone away somewhere or other too, to leave us to our own inventions. God forbid a thousand times! As St. Paul says: [...] "He is not far from any one of us." [...] "In Him we live and move and have our being," [...] cholera or none. Do you think Christ, the King of the earth, is gone away either--that while things go on rightly, and governments, and clergy, and people do right, Christ is there then, filling them all with His Spirit and guiding them all to their duty; but that when evil times come, and rulers are idle, and clergy dumb dogs, and the rich tyrannous, and the poor profligate, and men are crying for work and cannot get it, and every man's hand is against his fellow, and no one knows what to do or think; and on earth is distress of nations with perplexity, men's hearts failing them for fear, and for dread of those things which are coming on the earth--do you think that in such times as those, Christ is the least farther off from us than He was at the best of times?--The least farther off from us now than He was from the apostles at the first Whitsuntide? God forbid!--God forbid a thousand times! He has promised Himself, He that is faithful and true, He that will never deny Himself, though men deny Him, and say He is not here, because their eyes are blinded with love of the world, and covetousness and bigotry, and dread lest He, their Master, should come and find them beating the men-servants and maid-servants, and eating and drinking with the drunken in the high places of the earth, and saying: [...] "Tush! God hath forgotten it"--ay, though men have forgotten Him thus, and-- worse than thus, yet He hath said it--"Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world." [...] Why, evil times are the very times of which Christ used to speak as the [...] "days of the Lord," [...] and the [...] "days of the Son of man." [...] Times when we hear of wars and rumours of wars, and on earth distress of nations with perplexity--what does He tell men to do in them? To go whining about, and say that Christ has left His Church? No!
