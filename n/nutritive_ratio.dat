40|$|Garbage is {{the main}} feed for swine in the Territory of Hawaii {{because of the high}} cost of other {{concentrates}} commonly fed to hogs. An extensive study has therefore been made of the value of garbage as a feed for swine. This study has included experiments with weanling pigs, with growing and fattening pigs, with brood sows, and supplementary experiments with rats. Analyses of 622 samples of military garbage and of 50 samples from a civilian cafeteria indicate that military garbage is ordinarily well balanced. at least in respect to <b>nutritive</b> <b>ratio.</b> That from the cafeteria was considerably lower in protein...|$|E

Introduction: This is a farmers family {{consisting}} of four men and two women, all in good healthy condition. The four children attend college and do work enough at home to keep their appetites good. The studies were continued through the month of April 1906. The amount of food used and the amount wasted at each meal was weighed, {{and the cost of}} all material noted. Now {{at the close of the}} month we are able to determine the cost of living for the month and the total amount of material used—and the calorie and <b>nutritive</b> <b>ratio</b> of each meal...|$|E

40|$|These {{experiments}} {{have not been}} continued long enough with each feed to suggest infallible conclusions. The work has been carried through two years, however, under excellent conditions for accurate work, {{and there has been}} in the fundamental effects of the rations a close similarity of results with the different pairs of horses. While the subject merits more extended study, and future work might give somewhat different results, it seems that the results already obtained justify the following conclusions: 1. The health, spirit, and endurance of work horses were the same when fed corn with a moderate amount of oil meal, or gluten feed, or cottonseed meal; as when fed a corn and oats ration supplying a similar <b>nutritive</b> <b>ratio.</b> 2. The ration of corn and oil meal maintained the weight, flesh, and appearance of the horses fully as well and with less expense than the one of similar nutritive value composed of corn and oats...|$|E
40|$|NUMEROUS {{cautions}} and warnings {{have been}} issued by leaders in poul-try husbandry against sudden feed changes. These warnings stated that birds will go off feed and suffer an interruption {{in the rate of}} growth; that laying hens will suffer a loss in egg production, and prob-ably go into a partial or complete molt as the result of sudden feed changes. Other workers have not shared the view that sudden feed changes result in economic losses. Stout (1926) states that: "If changes are made from one feed to another, they should be gradual. " Jaff (1905) in discuss-ing the subject of changing feed expressed the view that even though the <b>nutritive</b> <b>ratio</b> may be maintained, palatability may be changed, and sudden changes may be disastrous. Jones, Davis, and McDonald (1917) expressed the view that feed formulas may be changed to take advan-tage of lower prices and obtain more eco-nomical production. Card and Kirkpatrick (1918) suggested gradual changes of feed to avoid any pos-sible set-back in growth. Spencer (1917) stated that: "Young chicks are quite sensi-tive to any changes of feed or tempera...|$|E
40|$|The {{current study}} {{examined}} the effects of probiotics (Pronifer and More-yeast) supplementation to growing lambs. 25 crossbred (Osimi×Rahmani) growing lambs of about 6 – 8 months age and an average initial live body weight of 25 kg were used. Lambs divided into five groups (5 lambs for each group) and the experimental period lasted for 169 days. The control group T 1 received concentrate feed mixture (CFM), group T 2 and T 3 received 1. 5 and 3 kg Pronifer/Mg (megagram) CFM and group T 4 and T 5 received 2. 5 and 5 kg More-yeast/ Mg CFM, respectively. Rumen liquor and blood samples were taken and digestibility trial was conducted {{at the end of the}} experiment. Results showed higher digestibility values for crude protein (P 3 and T 4 when compared to control. <b>Nutritive</b> <b>ratio</b> was lower (P 3 and T 4 than in group T 2. More-yeast supplementation improved dry matter intake (P < 0. 001), while a reverse trend was observed with Pronifer supplementation. All treatments had little effect on ruminal liquor except ruminal ammonia concentration in T 5 was lower (P < 0. 05) than other treatments. The differences in most blood plasma parameters due to treatment effect were not significant, except plasma urea and globulin concentrations increased (P 5 treatment. The obtained results appear to indicate that Moreyeast supplementation improved lambs performance and digestibility, whereas, Pronifer supplementation enhanced digestibility...|$|E
40|$|Citation: McRae, Alma. A summer's dietry {{study for}} a family of four. Senior thesis, Kansas State Agricultural College, 1906. Introduction: The thesis is an actual {{experiment}} conducted in a family consisting of four people. The experiment began June 24, 1905, and ended September 2, 1905. During the entire time menus were kept of each meal, and for three periods of four days each, the actual weight and cost of the food eaten was noted. From the weight of the food recorded the calorie value per capita and the <b>nutritive</b> <b>ratio</b> has been figured for each meal of the three series. The first of these periods is from June 24 to June 28; the second from July 29 to August 2; the third from August 30 to September 3. The days covered in each case are Saturday, Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday; the diet of these days is a fair representation of the diet during the Summer. The locality is {{the eastern part of the}} state in a small country town. The family kept a garden, therefore the vegetables eaten did not figure as expense; chickens were also kept so only occasionally were the chickens eaten purchased. One quart of milk was bought daily at five cents per quart. The cost of the milk has been divided among the meals where it was used in the menus. Its entire cost was always included. The general health of the family was good at the beginning, and was also good at the end of the experiment...|$|E
40|$|Citation: Dow, Ula May. Catering for two hundred. Senior thesis, Kansas State Agricultural College, 1905. Introduction: During {{the last}} few years, it has been {{generally}} recognized that for the proper nourishment of the human body, {{it is necessary to}} feed what is known as a balanced dietary. It would seem to be difficult to put this into practice, but with very little experience one can determine from the class of foods used, whether, or not, a menu conforms to the dietary standard. A banquet usually means intemperance as far as quantity of food is concerned. Five or six courses as usually served give a calorie value nearly sufficient for an entire day. The effects of an unbalanced menu, therefore, are largely multiplied by the, quantity, thus making a careful consideration of the <b>nutritive</b> <b>ratio</b> necessary. Other elements to be considered in planning are cost, amount and order of preparation. The most practical method of estimating cost and amount is to take each separate food to be served and by actual experiment determine the amount and cost per capita. These could then be multiplied by the number of plates to be served. Taking for example, a brown bread sandwich to be served with a fish course, the process of gathering data is as follows: Once the given recipe is prepared and steamed in a can of suitable size and shape for use. The percentage of swelling in cooking is estimated and from this, the number of times the recipe needed to fill the can. This loaf is steamed, cooled and made into sandwiches. The data obtained from the experiment is then, 1. Amount of materials needed to make a definite sized loaf. 2. Number of sandwiches this loaf will make. 3. Amount of butter necessary to spread the sandwiches...|$|E

Introduction: The growing {{importance}} of the dairy industry in Kansas {{during the past few}} years, has attracted much attention to this new line of business in our state. This interest is manifested in the numerous, animated, discussions, which take place through the leading agricultural and stock journals, upon almost every phase relative to the dairy business. With the increase of the demand for dairy products, there comes an increased {{effort on the part of}} the producers to supply this demand. And this constant aim at improvement and competition has suggested and developed many useful, economical appliances and methods which have contributed to, and acted as a stimulus for the success of the dairy industry in the West. Along this line, we find improved methods of feeding, based on scientific principles, in which, by making use of our knowledge of chemistry of foods, and the comparative <b>nutritive</b> <b>ratio</b> of different foods, we have determined on the method of balanced rations. Of these we will say more presently. While methods of care and feeding are of great importance, there are other factors which exercise a great influence, upon the dairy returns. Paramount among these factors is that of object in breeding. Great attention has been paid of late years to the breeding of cattle for dairy purposes. In most cases, kit has been customary to designate some particular breed as a dairy breed, and another as a beef breed, irrespective of certain peculiar type and individual qualities, any contemplated or proposed improvement in the dairy business or herd, was always to be made within or of some particular breed...|$|E

Introduction: Surely {{no one who}} {{breathes}} the air of liberty-loving America, {{who enjoys}} the protection of its just laws, and who partakes {{of the benefits of}} it's worthy institutions can fail to have it's interests uppermost in every activity of his life. No one who names himself an “American” can disconnect his duties to his country with those of his religion. Yet very frequently through ignorance or unconcern, individuals do not realize what is the basis of their nation's welfare. Laws are enacted in the attempt to diminish wrong doing and institutions are established for the purpose of confining those who are abnormal. But these means prove ineffectual for the root of the evil has not been reached. The diseases of crimnality and imbecility, which are at once the disgrace and bane of this country, can not be cured by legislative enactments nor appropriations. The chief responsibility must unquestionably rest upon the home and more specifically upon the food consumed by the family. It would be narrow to assert that the latter has the sole influence in moulding the character of the individual and subsequently of the state but that it is of paramount importance is made certain both by the history of individuals and of nations. That the excessive consumption of animal food tends greatly to stimulate nervous activity is evidenced by the Englishing-speaking peoples who are the greatest users of animal food {{and at the same time}} the most energetic and the most pugnacious race on the globe. In contrast the uniformly non-aggressive and sluggish tendency of the Orientals whose diet is mostly farinaceous, offers convincining proof of the fact that such a dietary has a non-stimulating effect. Whether the results of these diets are due to their poorly balanced <b>nutritive</b> <b>ratio</b> or to some property peculiar to the animal and vegetable foods respectively, is of little moment here. It is sufficient...|$|E
