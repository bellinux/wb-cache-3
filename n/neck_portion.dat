40|$|Nutritional and {{metabolic}} {{changes in}} the avian pipping muscle have been discussed by previous researchers. However, there are no reports {{in the literature on}} the histology of the embryonic pipping muscle in modern broiler strains. Therefore, the current experiment was conducted to examine histological {{changes in the}} embryonic pipping muscle of a modern broiler strain between d 15 and 19 of incubation. Ross x Ross 708 broiler hatching eggs were incubated on 8 replicate tray levels of an incubator. On d 15 and 19 of incubation, 2 embryos per level were extracted and their head and <b>neck</b> <b>portions</b> were preserved. The tissues were processed and stained using standard histological techniques. Subsequently, longitudinal and transverse sections of the embryonic pipping muscles on each of those days were examined under 2 x, 4 x, 10 x, 20 x and 40 x magnifications. In preparation for hatch between d 15 and 19 of incubation, muscle fiber thickness increased, suggesting protein accretion and nutrient accumulation in the individual muscle fibers. Intra-fascicular muscle fiber density decreased and the inter-fascicular spaces widened and were filled with more cellular and fluid components, suggesting the active and selective infiltration of lymph into the pipping muscle from the surrounding lymph glands. In addition, the inter-fascicular spaces were filled with more cellular debris, which may be a result of muscle cell degeneration, necrosis, or associated apoptotic changes in the actively growing pipping muscle. Results of the current experiment provide an insight into the morphological changes in the pipping muscle during embryogenesis in a modern broiler strain. These together with the other associated changes in the nutritional profiles and the proteome compositions of the pipping muscle, as previously reported from our laboratory, facilitate a more detailed and comprehensive understanding of the various orchestrated cellular, metabolic and physiological events that occur in the pipping muscle of a modern broiler strain during the later part of incubation as the embryo prepares for hatch...|$|R

50|$|Typically, before solvent or {{reagents}} {{are introduced}} into a Schlenk flask, the flask is dried {{and the atmosphere}} of the flask is exchanged with an inert gas. A common method of exchanging {{the atmosphere of the}} flask is to flush the flask out with an inert gas. The gas can be introduced through the side arm of the flask, or via a wide bore needle (attached to a gas line). The contents of the flask exit the flask through the <b>neck</b> <b>portion</b> of the flask. The needle method has the advantage that the needle can be placed {{at the bottom of the}} flask to better flush out the atmosphere of the flask.

40|$|Hip {{resurfacing}} is {{an alternative}} to total hip arthroplasty for the young and active patient likely to outlive traditional means of hip joint replacement. The acetabular cup is implanted {{in much the same}} fashion as an uncemented total hip arthroplasty, however, implantation of the femoral component is unique to hip resurfacing, presenting both distinct benefits and limitations. Hip resurfacing spares much of the proximal femur including the femoral <b>neck</b> and <b>portions</b> of the femoral head. This may be advantageous if the patient requires revision surgery; however, preservation of the femoral neck bears with it the risk of femoral neck fracture. The exact mechanism of neck fracture is not fully understood. Avoiding potential fracture risks is vital to ensuring optimal patient outcomes. The current work investigated mechanical femoral head preparatory factors that may predispose to femoral neck fracture. Intra-operative computer navigation is emerging as the gold-standard in orthopaedic care. In hip resurfacing, navigation may improve the surgeon’s ability to optimally implant the resurfacing prosthesis; however, much of this technology {{is still in its infancy}} and requires investigation into the accuracy and repeatability of this peri-operative tool.

50|$|The {{first major}} form relates to an {{abnormality}} {{of the brain}} called an Arnold-Chiari malformation. This {{is the most common}} cause of syringomyelia, where the anatomic abnormality which may be due to a small posterior fossa causes the lower part of the cerebellum to protrude from its normal location in the back of the head into the cervical or <b>neck</b> <b>portion</b> of the spinal canal. A syrinx may then develop in the cervical region of the spinal cord. Here, symptoms usually begin between the ages of 25 and 40 and may worsen with straining or any activity that causes cerebrospinal fluid pressure to fluctuate suddenly. Some patients, however, may have long periods of stability. Some patients with this form of the disorder also have hydrocephalus, in which cerebrospinal fluid accumulates in the skull, or a condition called arachnoiditis, in which a covering of the spinal cord—the arachnoid membrane—is inflamed.|$|E

40|$|Introduction Portions of {{gastrointestinal}} tract {{may be used}} as microvascular transfers for reconstruction of hypo pharynx and esophagus. Colon, jejunum and portions of stomach have also been successfully used Intestinal transfer by revascularization was reported by Seidenberg in 1959 long before the development of other free tissue transfers. Material and methods When an appropriate piece of jejunum is being selected for transfer the important considerations are its shape and its vascular supply. Because of multiple curves of jejunum, it is difficult to obtain straight lengths longer than 12 - 15 cm without separating it from its mesentery at both ends Discussion Mucous production is very important in the first postoperative days. When edema decreases and patients can swallow fluids well, oral intake can gradually be increased to full fluids and eventual regular diet. It is important to monitor jejunum following its transfer.

This form of metaplasia is unlike those previously described and could cause initial confusion if encountered in a percutaneous renal biopsy. The {{upper part of the}} nephron can be divided into the renal corpuscle, or Bowman's capsule, the <b>neck</b> <b>portion,</b> and the proximal tubule (Rouiller, 1969). In man Bowman's capsule is lined by an inconspicuous layer of flattened squamous cells (Allen, 1962; Brewer, 1964; Heptinstall, 1967); in the mink and mouse the parietal capsular epithelium is cuboidal (Crabtree, 1940; Rouiller, 1969). The <b>neck</b> <b>portion,</b> seen in lower animals but not in man, is lined by an epithelium which has the cytological characteristics of the proximal tubule (DuBois, 1969).

30|$|The {{duodenum}} measures about 25  cm to 30  cm {{in length}} [1]. It does not {{form part of}} the mesenteric small bowel and it has both an extra- and intraperitoneal location [2]. The first portion (duodenal bulb) is suspended intraperitoneally and extends from the gastric pylorus to the gallbladder <b>neck.</b> The second <b>portion</b> (descending duodenum) extends between the superior and inferior duodenal flexures in the anterior pararenal space. The anatomic space between the duodenum and pancreatic head is the pancreaticoduodenal groove. The major and minor duodenal papillae are usually located {{in the second part}} of the duodenum. The third portion (horizontal duodenum) runs behind the peritoneum from right to left, crossing over the inferior vena cava and aorta. The major duodenal papilla is located in the third portion in up to 25 % of cases [3]; however, other series report a much lower percentage (1.4 %) [4]. The fourth portion (ascending duodenum) courses superiorly to the duodenojejunal flexure. The duodenum is supplied by the pancreaticoduodenal arcades. The superior pancreaticoduodenal artery is an anatomic landmark between the descending duodenum and the pancreatic head, and the inferior pancreaticoduodenal artery is an anatomic landmark between the horizontal duodenum and uncinate process of the pancreas.|$|R
