500|$|After the 1880s, a {{eugenics}} movement {{developed on}} ideas of biological inheritance, and for scientific justification of their ideas appealed to some concepts of Darwinism. In Britain, most shared Darwin's cautious views on voluntary improvement {{and sought to}} encourage those with good traits in [...] "positive eugenics". During the [...] "Eclipse of Darwinism", a scientific foundation for eugenics was provided by Mendelian genetics. <b>Negative</b> <b>eugenics</b> to remove the [...] "feebleminded" [...] were popular in America, Canada and Australia, and eugenics in the United States introduced compulsory sterilization laws, followed by several other countries. Subsequently, Nazi eugenics brought the field into disrepute.|$|E
500|$|Before {{the advent}} of the birth control movement, {{eugenics}} had become very popular in Europe and the U.S., and the subject was widely discussed in articles, movies, and lectures.Lynn, Richard, (2001), Eugenics: A Reassessment, Praeger, p. 18.For a detailed discussion of Sanger and Eugenics, see: Ordover, Nancy (2003), American eugenics: race, queer anatomy, and the science of nationalism, University of Minnesota Press, pp. 137–158. Eugenicists had mixed feelings about birth control: they worried that it would exacerbate the birth rate differential between [...] "superior" [...] and [...] "inferior" [...] races, but they also recognized its value as a tool to [...] "racial betterment". Leaders of the birth control movement never considered eugenics to be their primary goal, focusing instead on free speech and women's rights, but around 1920 they started to make common cause with eugenicists, hoping to broaden the support base of the birth control movement.Free speech as primary goal: McCann (2010), pp. 750–751.McCann (1994), p. 59. Eugenics buttressed the birth control movement's aims by correlating excessive births with increased poverty, crime and disease.Engelman, p. 134. Sanger published two books in the early 1920s that endorsed eugenics: Woman and the New Race and The Pivot of Civilization. Sanger and other advocates endorsed <b>negative</b> <b>eugenics</b> (discouraging procreation of [...] "inferior" [...] persons), but did not advocate euthanasia or positive eugenics (encouraging procreation of [...] "superior" [...] persons).Engelman, p. 134. Many eugenicists refused to support the birth control movement because of Sanger's insistence that a woman's primary duty was to herself, not to the state.|$|E
2500|$|In Western Canada, many {{influential}} {{citizens and}} interest groups campaigned for segregation and sterilization of the feebleminded. [...] Perhaps most notable was Emily Murphy, the first female magistrate for the British Empire. [...] Ms. Murphy was a prolific and influential writer who organized meetings and addressed many women’s groups in support of <b>negative</b> <b>eugenics.</b> [...] In addition, J. S. Woodsworth, preacher and Superintendent of All People’s Mission in Winnipeg conducted and published studies on immigration and social response. [...] Woodsworth’s reports concerning the quality of immigrants aided in creating a public crisis. [...] Together, these individuals published numerous articles in popular magazines and spoke at public meetings in support of sterilization.|$|E
5000|$|... • Eugenics in America- A look at {{the history}} of Eugenics in America, {{including}} <b>negative</b> and positive <b>eugenics.</b>|$|R
40|$|Since {{the early}} 1990 s, {{a series of}} studies underscored the {{overwhelming}} presence of positive eugenics in modern Argentina. These works emphasized the marginal role which discourse on eugenics took on violent methods for selection. In recent years, this point of view has shifted, emphasizing the conceptual viscosity of eugenics as well as the presence of <b>negative</b> <b>eugenic</b> discourses. This paper discusses these historiographic trends, and also dwells on the narratives that those perspectives articulated in relation to the question of sterilization and regulation of marriage of those who had tuberculosis in Buenos Aires {{during the first half of}} the twentieth century. This example stresses the need to examine discourse as well as practices in understanding and making sense of the past...|$|R
50|$|Due to the Christian right's views {{regarding}} {{ethics and}} to an extent due to <b>negative</b> views of <b>eugenics</b> common to most ideologies in North America, it {{has worked for the}} regulation and restriction of certain applications of biotechnology. In particular, the Christian right opposes therapeutic and reproductive human cloning, championing a 2005 United Nations ban on the practice, and human embryonic stem cell research, which involves the extraction of one or more cells from a human embryo. The Christian right supports research with adult stem cells, amniotic stem cells, and induced pluripotent stem cells which don't utilise cells from human embryos, as they view the harvesting of biological material from an embryo lacking the ability to give permission as an assault on a living being.|$|R
50|$|Eugenics {{offers two}} approaches: {{positive}} eugenics, and <b>negative</b> <b>eugenics.</b> Positive eugenics aims towards creating better humans by careful mating, based on one's genetic makeup. <b>Negative</b> <b>eugenics,</b> {{on the other}} hand, seeks to prevent those deemed inferior from reproducing, and thus not impeding man's evolution.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Negative</b> <b>eugenics</b> by {{provision}} of information and services, i.e. reduction of unplanned pregnancies and births.|$|E
50|$|Original position, a {{hypothetical}} situation developed by American philosopher John Rawls, {{has been used}} as an argument for <b>negative</b> <b>eugenics.</b>|$|E
50|$|Recently, the {{original}} {{position has been}} modelled mathematically along Wright-Fisher's diffusion, classical in population genetics. The original position has also been used as an argument for <b>negative</b> <b>eugenics.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Eugenic {{policies}} have been conceptually divided into two categories. [...] Positive eugenics is aimed at encouraging reproduction among the genetically advantaged; for example, the reproduction of the intelligent, the healthy, and the successful. Possible approaches include financial and political stimuli, targeted demographic analyses, in vitro fertilization, egg transplants, and cloning. The movie Gattaca provides a fictional example of a dystopian society that uses eugenics to decided what you are capable of and your place in the world. <b>Negative</b> <b>eugenics</b> aimed to eliminate, through sterilization or segregation, those deemed physically, mentally, or morally [...] "undesirable". This includes abortions, sterilization, and other methods of family planning. Both positive and <b>negative</b> <b>eugenics</b> can be coercive; abortion for fit women, for example, was illegal in Nazi Germany.|$|E
50|$|During {{the postwar}} years, one of Osborn's lasting {{influences}} was shifting {{the emphasis of}} American eugenics to positive eugenics, which seeks to achieve eugenic goals through encouraging the spread of desired traits, as opposed to <b>negative</b> <b>eugenics,</b> which seeks to achieve eugenic goals through discouraging the spread of undesired traits.|$|E
50|$|The {{concept of}} {{positive}} eugenics to produce better human beings has existed {{at least since}} Plato suggested selective mating to produce a guardian class. The idea of <b>negative</b> <b>eugenics</b> to decrease the birth of inferior human beings has existed at least since William Goodell (1829-1894) advocated the castration and spaying of the insane.|$|E
50|$|Caird was {{a member}} of the Theosophical Society from 1904 to 1909. Among her later {{writings}} are a large illustrated volume of travel essays, Romantic Cities Of Provence (1906), and novels The Stones Of Sacrifice (1915), which depicts harmful effects of self-sacrifice on women, and The Great Wave (1931), a social science fiction which attacks the racist policies of <b>negative</b> <b>eugenics.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Frederick Osborn's 1937 journal article [...] "Development of a Eugenic Philosophy" [...] framed it as {{a social}} {{philosophy}}—that is, a philosophy with implications for social order. That definition is not universally accepted. Osborn advocated for higher rates of sexual reproduction among people with desired traits (positive eugenics), or reduced rates of sexual reproduction and sterilization of people with less-desired or undesired traits (<b>negative</b> <b>eugenics).</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{fit between}} people and their environments brings up the topic of {{positive}} and <b>negative</b> <b>eugenics</b> {{which has been a}} background challenge in Green theory. Healthy and unhealthy have seemed to replace the theology of good and evil. Holistic health is a popular part of green theories combined with green living. Public health with prevention and health promotion are more consistent with Green theory too.|$|E
50|$|Charles Davenport is {{credited}} with being {{the founder of the}} eugenics movement in the United States. He founds the Eugenics Record Office on Long Island, the purpose being to create a nationwide eugenics register. He trains field workers to visit poor houses, prisons and mental institutions to document, and eventually eliminate through <b>negative</b> <b>eugenics,</b> inferior hereditary characteristics. To justify an aggressive campaign against blacks and immigrants, the eugenics movement used the concept of racial degeneration.|$|E
5000|$|Francis Galton {{began working}} in 1869 {{to find a}} {{statistical}} science of heredity which he believed could encourage voluntary care in selecting partners, and in 1883 he introduced the term [...] "eugenics" [...] for this subject, {{but in the early}} 20th century a eugenics movement adopted ideas of Mendelian genetics and promoted <b>negative</b> <b>eugenics</b> to prevent those thought to be unsuitable from having children, and eugenics was used to legitimise policies of racial hygiene.|$|E
5000|$|Published in 1913, Racial Hygiene in the United States in America {{discussed}} the similarities of eugenics theories such as {{negative and positive}} eugenics and so-called practical social policies like sterilization and immigration. He endorsed “negative” eugenic policies on the practical level, while simultaneously emphasizing their theoretical value, <b>Negative</b> <b>eugenics</b> programs included any activities that discourage or stop the reproduction or continuation of certain peoples deemed inferior. It could also include programs that simply limit certain people to the state. These programs would include sterilization, immigration bans, separate institutions for different groups, marriage restrictions and more. The people typically picked for <b>negative</b> <b>eugenics</b> were placed in racialized groups or somehow physically or mentally deemed [...] "unfit". Positive eugenics entailed any programs that encourage reproduction, success or admittance into the state of certain groups considered superior. These programs could include restricting abortions, providing financial aid for additional children and more. According to his book, he viewed marriage limits, immigration laws, and forced sterilization as {{the best ways to}} practice eugenics as he observed it in the United States. They were all negative, which was the main criticism about both his work and United States' practice of eugenics.|$|E
50|$|Concepts of race {{have long}} been {{connected}} to dealings with Aboriginal peoples in Canada. Eugenic ideology served as a convenient justification for the terrible circumstances created by colonization and was instrumental in determining how to interfere {{in the lives of}} Aboriginal peoples. Interventions were often guided by the view that the less progressed were a hazard to society and this justified drastic invasions in their lives. Initial measures advocated in the spirit of <b>negative</b> <b>eugenics</b> including marriage regulation, segregation and sterilization were all imposed on Aboriginal peoples.|$|E
50|$|The German and Swedish {{implementation}} of eugenics was {{bound by a}} common thread: a profound pride of their Nordic bloodline, and their belief that other ethnic groups were inherently inferior, and those groups should be prevented from interbreeding with the superior one. Hence, <b>negative</b> <b>eugenics</b> was the only logical outcome of Sweden's adoption of eugenics. In pursuit of establishing {{both positive and negative}} heritage, a comprehensive study was done on the Swedish population.Towns, parishes, prisons and correctional institutions were visited, and photographs and physical measurements of each person taken.|$|E
5000|$|A major {{criticism}} of eugenics policies is that, {{regardless of whether}} [...] "negative" [...] or [...] "positive" [...] policies are used, they are susceptible to abuse because the criteria of selection are determined by whichever group is in political power at the time. Furthermore, <b>negative</b> <b>eugenics</b> in particular {{is considered by many}} to be a violation of basic human rights, which include the right to reproduction. Another criticism is that eugenic policies eventually lead to a loss of genetic diversity, resulting in inbreeding depression due to lower genetic variation.|$|E
5000|$|In 1995 and 1996 Pearson {{published}} a trilogy {{of articles in}} Mankind Quarterly regarding the [...] "Concept of heredity in Western thought", a defense of hereditarianism and an denouncement of the [...] "onslaught of egalitarianism". Pearson here repeated his defense for the view of racial groups as subspecies and he repeated his dedication to eugenicist ideas, although with the caveat that <b>negative</b> <b>eugenics</b> ought to take place as a voluntary act of altruistic sacrifice for one's species. The same views were repeated in the 1996 book [...] "Heredity and Humanity: Race, Eugenics and Modern Science".|$|E
5000|$|World War {{erupted in}} 1914 and closed in 1919 with a treaty {{including}} {{a plan of}} reparations that British economist John Maynard Keynes immediately and vehemently predicted had the consequence of crumbling German society via hyperinflation—prediction fulfilled by 1923. [...] Upon 29 May 1919's solar eclipse, Einstein's gravitational theory apparently overthrew Newton's—a revolution in science by astonishing prediction—a revolution bitterly resisted by many scientists but completed nearing 1930. [...] An yet race science flourished, appearing quite scientific to many, not obviously pseudoscience, while overtaking medicine and public health with excesses of <b>negative</b> <b>eugenics.</b>|$|E

5000|$|During {{the early}} twentieth century, {{eugenics}} became a popular method for population control and nation building among many countries in Europe and the Americas. Proponents of the eugenics movement sought to [...] "improve" [...] the human race through {{both positive and negative}} eugenic practices. Positive eugenics encouraged the procreation of the [...] "fit," [...] while <b>negative</b> <b>eugenics</b> advocated for the implementation of more radical actions such as marriage restriction and sterilization of the [...] "unfit." [...] The eugenics movement was not confined to Western European countries and the U.S. By the 1930s, almost every country in Latin America had been impacted by eugenics.|$|E
5000|$|Hoffmann {{was praised}} for {{providing}} insight into eugenicist activities, structures, and attitudes in the United States. [...] He was however, criticized by Fritz Lenz {{who argued that}} Americans had a better <b>negative</b> <b>eugenics</b> operation but not enough positive eugenics. [...] Lenz believed American leaders were not pushing American women to have enough children. Lenz {{said it was a}} problem of “extreme dominance of the ladies." [...] Essentially, according to Lenz, American was doing enough to stop inferior reproduction but needed to encourage superior reproduction. Lenz also believed that women in America had too much choice about reproduction.|$|E
5000|$|Its {{emphasis}} was more upon social class, rather than race. Indeed, Francis Galton expressed these views during a lecture in 1901 {{in which he}} placed British society into groups. These groupings are shown in the figure and indicate the proportion of society falling into each group and their perceived genetic worth. Galton suggested that <b>negative</b> <b>eugenics</b> (i.e. an attempt {{to prevent them from}} bearing offspring) should be applied only to those in the lowest social group (the [...] "Undesirables"), while positive eugenics applied to the higher classes. However, he appreciated the worth of the higher working classes to society and industry.|$|E

50|$|Sanger {{used her}} {{writings}} and speeches primarily to promote {{her way of}} thinking. She was prosecuted for her book Family Limitation under the Comstock Act in 1914. She was afraid of what would happen, so she fled to Britain until {{she knew it was}} safe to return to the US. Sanger's efforts contributed to several judicial cases that helped legalize contraception in the United States. Due to her connection with Planned Parenthood Sanger is a frequent target of criticism by opponents of abortion, although Planned Parenthood did not begin providing abortions until 1970, after Sanger had already died. Sanger, who has been criticized for supporting <b>negative</b> <b>eugenics,</b> remains an admired figure in the American reproductive rights movement.|$|E
50|$|The International Federation of Eugenic Organizations (IFEO) was an {{international}} organization of {{groups and individuals}} focused on eugenics. Founded in London in 1912, where it was originally titled the Permanent International Eugenics Committee, it was {{an outgrowth of the}} first International Eugenics Congress. In 1925, it was retitled. Factionalism within the organization led to its division in 1933, as splinter group the Latin International Federation of Eugenics Organizations was created to give a home to eugenicists who disliked the concepts of <b>negative</b> <b>eugenics,</b> in which unfit groups and individuals are discouraged of prevented from reproducing. As the views of the Nazi party in Germany caused increasing tension within the group and leadership activity declined, it dissolved {{in the latter half of}} the 1930s.|$|E
5000|$|After World War I, Sanger {{increasingly}} {{appealed to}} the societal need to limit births by those least able to afford children. The affluent and educated already limited their child-bearing, while the poor and ignorant lacked access to contraception and information about birth-control. Here she found an area of overlap with eugenicists. She believed that they both sought to [...] "assist the race toward {{the elimination of the}} unfit." [...] They differed in that [...] "eugenists imply or insist that a woman's first duty is to the state; we contend that her duty to herself is her duty to the state." [...] Sanger was a proponent of <b>negative</b> <b>eugenics,</b> which aimed to improve human hereditary traits through social intervention by reducing the reproduction of those who were considered unfit.|$|E
5000|$|The IFEO's {{emphasis}} on <b>negative</b> <b>eugenics,</b> {{in which the}} unfit are eliminated from society through such measures as forced sterilization and laws against reproduction, {{led to the formation}} of a splinter group in 1933, when Italian sociologist Corrado Gini established the Latin International Federation of Eugenics Organizations specifically to give a place to organizations fundamentally opposed to the approach. The Latin International Federation of Eugenics Organizations had its first meeting in 1935 and soon represented groups from Argentina, Brazil, Catalonia, France, Mexico, Portugal, Romania, and Switzerland (French and Italian). Focused on encouraging reproduction of the [...] "fit", the Latin International Federation of Eugenics Organizations was disrupted by the advent of World War II, its second congress cancelled, but Gini continued to promote positive eugenics until his death in 1965.|$|E
5000|$|Later {{readers have}} recoiled at what Lovat Dickson in 1969 called the books {{suggestion}} of [...] "strong-armed fascism." [...] W. Warren Wagar, discussing Anticipations advocacy of racism, eugenics and capital punishment, noted [...] "To Wells credit, {{he would soon}} abandon such thoughts, {{but they were all}} here in plain English in Anticipations and we have no power or licence to wish them away". A number of writers (e.g. Michael Coren and John Carey [...] ) have made even stronger charges against Wells. But in fact Wells responded to criticism and was soon arguing against the <b>negative</b> <b>eugenics</b> advocated in Chapter 9, and he later became a leading advocate of human rights. Sherborne notes within two years of the publication of Anticipations: [...] "Wells would be arguing against negative eugenics; within three defending black people against race prejudice; within four advocating the desirability of a multitracial society".|$|E
5000|$|Although Macklin was {{a pioneer}} in the field of medical genetics, she was also {{involved}} in eugenics which is a belief that the human population can be improved by deterring people with undesirable traits from reproducing and encouraging those the favorable traits to reproduce. By the early 1930s, Macklin had begun to focus her medical attention on hereditary diseases. Since few of these had therapies, often the only viable medical intervention was prevention; i.e., stopping [...] "defective" [...] people from reproducing. Medical genetics, in her mind, was thus tantamount to <b>negative</b> <b>eugenics.</b> She advocated eugenic approaches to many diseases, from cancer to schizophrenia. Over her career, she published over 20 articles on the topic of eugenics, focused on the sterilization of individuals unfit to be parents of the next generation and individuals who had unfavorable attributes. One of her last major research efforts was a large study of the heritability of breast cancer, which still stands as a classic.|$|E
5000|$|Eugenics {{eventually}} {{referred to}} human selective reproduction with an intent to create children with desirable traits, generally through {{the approach of}} influencing differential birth rates. These policies were mostly divided into two categories: positive eugenics, the increased reproduction of those seen to have advantageous hereditary traits; and <b>negative</b> <b>eugenics,</b> the discouragement of reproduction by those with hereditary traits perceived as poor. Negative eugenic policies {{in the past have}} ranged from paying those deemed to have bad genes to voluntarily undergo sterilization, to attempts at segregation to compulsory sterilization and even genocide. Positive eugenic policies have typically taken the form of awards or bonuses for [...] "fit" [...] parents who have another child. Relatively innocuous practices like marriage counseling had early links with eugenic ideology. Eugenics is superficially related to what would later be known as Social Darwinism. While both claimed intelligence was hereditary, eugenics asserted new policies were needed to actively change the status quo towards a more [...] "eugenic" [...] state, while the Social Darwinists argued society itself would naturally [...] "check" [...] the problem of [...] "dysgenics" [...] if no welfare policies were in place (for example, the poor might reproduce more but would have higher mortality rates).|$|E
