25|$|Some smoking {{restrictions}} {{were introduced in}} German hotels, restaurants, and bars in 2008 and early 2009. The restaurant industry has claimed that some businesses in the states which restricted smoking in late 2007 (Lower Saxony, Baden-Württemberg, and Hessen) experienced reduced profits. The German Hotel and Restaurant Association (DEHOGA) claimed that the smoking ban deterred people from {{going out for a}} drink or meal, stating that 15% of establishments that adopted a ban in 2007 saw turnover fall by around 50%. However, a study by the University of Hamburg (Ahlfeldt and Maennig 2010) finds negative impacts on revenues, if any, only in the very short run. In the medium and long run, a recovery of revenues took place. These results suggest either, that the consumption in bars and restaurants is not affected by smoking bans in the long run, or, that <b>negative</b> <b>revenue</b> impacts by smokers are compensated by increasing revenues through non-smokers. Smoking is not permitted in any public transit or in or around railway stations except for the locations expressly indicated for smoking.

40|$|Abstract—High {{resource}} utilization is {{an important}} goal in achieving high return on investment in cloud environments. Guaranteed quality of service (QoS) {{is an important}} goal for web-facing applications such as e-commerce. Achieving both high utilization and high QoS simultaneously is a significant challenge, since high utilization often implies more QoS failures such as long response times. In this paper, we adopt a profit model based on response time (i. e., decreasing or <b>negative</b> <b>revenues</b> for increasing query answer response time) to represent the QoS requirements. Our data shows that such a profit model often yields different analytical results compared to traditional performance metrics such as average throughput. Using extensive experimental measurements (on the same hardware platform and software stack) of the standard RUB-BoS n-tier benchmark, we study the impact of different allocations of software resources such as the size of thread pools in various servers in an n-tier system. First, the profit model {{emphasizes the importance of}} appropriate allocations, showing a difference of up to 48. 6 % when system utilization is high (over 80 %). Second, our experiments show that overallocation of thread pool may lead to unnecessary consumption of critical resources (e. g., CPU) that reduce profits by up to 84. 8 %. Third, we found that under-allocation of thread pool in one server may lead to under-utilization of several servers downstream in an n-tier system, also reducing profits by up to 52. 8 %. Our data shows that the best allocation depends on several system parameters, including resource availability. We designed an adaptive algorithm to find the best allocations and show its effectiveness through our experiments and analyses.

50|$|Several {{countries}} such as Ireland, Latvia, Estonia, the Netherlands, Finland, Norway, Canada, Australia, Sweden, Portugal, Singapore, Italy, Indonesia, India, Lithuania, Chile, Spain, Iceland, United Kingdom, Slovenia, Turkey and Malta have legislated against smoking in public places, often including bars and restaurants. Restaurateurs have been permitted in some jurisdictions to build designated smoking areas (or to prohibit smoking). In the United States, many states prohibit smoking in restaurants, and some also prohibit smoking in bars. In provinces of Canada, smoking is illegal in indoor workplaces and public places, including bars and restaurants. As of March 31, 2008 Canada has introduced a smoke-free law ban in all public places, as well as within 10 metres of an entrance to any public place. In Australia, smoke-free laws {{vary from state to}} state. Currently, Queensland has completely smoke-free indoor public places (including workplaces, bars, pubs and eateries) as well as patrolled beaches and some outdoor public areas. There are, however, exceptions for designated smoking areas. In Victoria, smoking is restricted in railway stations, bus stops and tram stops as these are public locations where second-hand smoke can affect non-smokers waiting for public transport, and since July 1, 2007 is now extended to all indoor public places. In New Zealand and Brazil, smoking is restricted in enclosed public places including bars, restaurants and pubs. Hong Kong restricted smoking on January 1, 2007 in the workplace, public spaces such as restaurants, karaoke rooms, buildings, and public parks (bars which do not admit minors were exempt until 2009). In Romania smoking is illegal in trains, metro stations, public institutions (except where designated, usually outside) and public transport.In Germany, additionally to smoking bans in public buildings and transports, an anti-smoking ordinance for bars and restaurants was implemented in late 2007.

40|$|The {{behavioural}} finance literature expects systematic and significant deviations from efficiency {{to persist in}} securities markets due to behavioural and cognitive biases of investors. These behavioural models attempt to explain the coexistence of intermediate-term momentum and long-term reversals in stock returns based on the systematic violations of rational behaviour of investors. The study investigates the anchoring bias of investors and the profitability of the 52 -week momentum strategy (GH henceforward). The relatively highly volatile OMX Helsinki stock exchange is a suitable market for examining the momentum effect, since international investors tend to realise their positions first from the furthest security markets {{by the time of}} market turbulence. Empirical data is collected from Thomson Reuters Datastream and the OMX Nordic website. The objective of the study is to provide a throughout research by formulating a self-financing GH momentum portfolio. First, the seasonality of the strategy is examined by taking the January effect into account and researching abnormal returns in long-term. The results indicate that the GH strategy is subject to significantly <b>negative</b> <b>revenues</b> in January, but the strategy is not prone to reversals in long-term. Then the predictive proxies of momentum returns are investigated in terms of acquisition prices and 52 -week high statistics as anchors. The results show that the acquisition prices do not have explanatory power over the GH strategy’s abnormal returns. Finally, the efficacy of the GH strategy is examined after taking transaction costs into account, finding that the robust abnormal returns remain statistically significant despite the transaction costs. As a conclusion, the relative distance between a stock’s current price and its 52 -week high statistic explains the profits of momentum investing to a high degree. The results indicate that intermediateterm momentum and long-term reversals are separate phenomena. This presents a challenge to current behavioural theories, which model these aspects of stock returns as subsequent components of how securities markets respond to relevant information...|$|R

30|$|The {{economic}} benefits of adopting local farm surface water retention basins as a strategic water management strategy were investigated using a dynamic modeling system to address the study objectives. The first objective was to determine retention ponds capacity when used for irrigation purposes to provide a net economic advantage for farmers currently without a local farm retention system or irrigation infrastructure. Retention ponds used for irrigation on the study watersheds four main crops from 2002 to 2015 provided an average annual increase in gross crop revenue of $ 12.80 /hectare. However, due to the high cost associated with the installation and maintenance of the retention pond and irrigation equipment, the net cost to the participating farmer was an average of $ 147.00 /hectare each year. Replacing the existing low-value crops within the study area with high-value potato crops also resulted in a <b>negative</b> net <b>revenue.</b> Objective one results indicated that under current climate conditions, installation of retention basins for irrigation purposes remained not an economically viable investment for the farmer.|$|R
40|$|In {{the airline}} industry, spill refers to {{passenger}} demand {{turned away from}} a flight because demand has exceeded capacity. The accurate estimation of spill and the lost revenue it implies is an important parameter in airline fleet assignment models, where improved estimates lead to more profitable assignments. Previous models for spill estimation did {{not take into account}} the effects of passenger choice and airline revenue management. Since revenue management systems protect seats for later-arriving higher fare passengers, revenue management controls will influence the number of spilled passengers and their value because they will restrict availability to lower fare passengers even if seats on the aircraft are available. This thesis examines the effect of various revenue management systems and fare structures on spill, and, in turn, the marginal value of incremental capacity. The Passenger Origin Destination Simulator is used to simulate realistic passenger booking scenarios and to measure the value of spilled demand. A major finding of the research is that in less restricted fare structures and with traditional revenue management systems, increasing capacity on a flight leads to buy-down which can result in <b>negative</b> marginal <b>revenues</b> and therefore revenue losses. This behavior is contrary to conventional wisdom and is not considered in existing spill models. On the other hand, marginal revenues at low capacities are greater than would be predicted by first-choice-only spill models because some passengers will sell-up to higher fares to avoid spilling out. Additionally, because of passenger recapture between flights, adding capacity to one flight can lead to revenue losses on another. Therefore, the marginal value of incremental capacity is not always positive. <b>Negative</b> marginal <b>revenues</b> and associated revenue losses with increasing capacity can at least be partially mitigated by using more advanced revenue management forecasting and optimization algorithms which take into account passenger willingness to pay. The thesis also develops a heuristic analytical method for estimating spill costs which takes into account the effects of passenger sell-up, where previous models tend to underestimate the spill cost by only modeling passengers' first choices. The heuristic demonstrates improved estimates of passenger spill: in particular, in restricted fare structures and for moderate amounts of spill, the model exhibits approximate relative errors on the order of 5 %, a factor of two improvement over previous models. by Michael Abramovich.
