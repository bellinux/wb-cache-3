Long-term unemployment has more than doubled. Especially young workers, unskilled workers and immigrants and <b>non-insured</b> <b>unemployed</b> are severely affected by unemployment.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{raises the}} question: Which {{discourse}} and what rationale is being {{reflected in the}} present employment policy? The thesis emphasizes on the initiatives towards the group of noninsured unemployed that have been implemented since 2001. According to the VK-government, which took over power in 2001, economic profit is decisive for the motivation to seek and maintain a job. The government specifically claims that some groups of <b>non-insured</b> <b>unemployed</b> lack economic incentives. As a consequence, the social security cash benefits for these groups (especially married couples and newly arrived immigrants) have been reduced during {{the last couple of}} years. This thesis originates from the questioning and wondering about the implementation of these tightened and restricted incentives. It is the objective of this project to demonstrate that there are well argued reasons to be critical and concerned about the governments use of economic incentives, in particular toward groups of <b>non-insured</b> <b>unemployed,</b> that are often affected by other problems beyond unemployment. Further, empiric researches indicate that it is not economic incentives that keep most unemployed from entering into employment. In order to understand why this strategy towards the unemployed is still being applied, the thesis focuses on the ideas and assumptions behind the current employment policy. The purpose is to place the employment policy in a relevant political–philosophical frame. Thus, the key theme of the thesis is analysing the relation between the current employment policy and the political– philosophical ideas behind it. The analysis focuses on classical philosophers as John Locke and Adam Smith and ideas from the Chicago School, Ayn Rand, Francis Fukuyama and the Danish prime minister; Anders Fogh Rasmussen. The concept of labour is being analysed by Max Webers’ thesis about the ethic of the Protestantism. The thesis concludes that the current employment policy it based on a neoliberal discourse and rationale; with both an economic and a political-ethical dimension. The economic dimension is oriented at “homo oeconomicus; scientific objectivity and economic effectiveness meanwhile the political dimension takes the shape as a formation project with focus on the individual responsibility and where the objective is to restore the human being in its lost dignity...|$|E
30|$|Unemployment {{insurance}} is usually found to show negative {{effects in the}} transition from unemployment to a new job. However, {{the extent to which}} workers’ careers might improve or deteriorate {{as a result of the}} unemployment insurance system is not immediately clear. This paper addresses the effects of certain aspects of this system on employment stability by jointly accounting for benefits endogeneity, dynamic selection issues and occurrence dependence. The analysis is undertaken for a dual labour market, such as the market in Spain, where temporary and permanent workers differ with respect to numerous individual and labour market characteristics. We find that <b>non-insured</b> <b>unemployed</b> workers experience a greater rate of transition to employment than insured workers. But we also find that benefits encourage job stability for temporary workers not only by increasing subsequent job tenure but also by increasing the probability of entering into a permanent contract. Finally, we get that shortening the duration of the benefit entitlement period does not seem to lead to significant gains in overall employment stability, which increases at most by 4.3  %.|$|E
30|$|In Denmark, {{membership}} of an {{unemployment insurance fund}} is voluntary, and {{membership of}} a given fund may be restricted by education and previous employment. Only members will receive UI benefits if they become <b>unemployed.</b> <b>Non-insured</b> workers who become unemployed may instead receive social assistance benefits which are means-tested. As discussed above, we focus on non-insured immigrants in this paper because there are considerably more non-western immigrants who are non-insured than insured, and, in particular, immigrants are over-represented among long-term recipients of social assistance. Therefore, the effect of programmes aimed at labour market integration of non-western immigrants receiving social assistance is of particular interest.|$|R
30|$|In {{accordance}} with previous literature, {{particularly with the}} results in Boone and Van Ours (2009), our findings show that <b>non-insured</b> <b>unemployed</b> workers experience a greater rate of transition to employment than insured workers, except {{at the time of}} benefit expiration. Incidentally, we find that benefits encourage job stability for temporary workers not only by increasing subsequent job tenure—the pure matching effect—but also by increasing the probability of entering into a permanent contract. Finally, our simulation exercises demonstrate that reducing (or increasing) the benefit entitlement period does not lead to substantial changes in employment stability because, although unemployment duration is being affected in the predicted direction, job turnover also increases (decreases) when unemployment benefits are cut (raised), especially for temporary workers. In sum, job stability hardly varies both when reducing or increasing benefit entitlements, being this result quite novel in the literature. 9 We show that {{the reason for this is}} because the effects on the overall time spent employed and on job turnover tend to cancel each other out making total time employed, our measure of job stability, almost unchanged under any of the two alternative measures. On the contrary, when we simulate a situation where the transition to permanent contracts is more likely, the long-term impact on job stability is much larger. This illustrates that, in terms of enhancing job stability, it might be more important to cope with the strong dual character of the Spanish labour market than to reshape the UI system.|$|E
