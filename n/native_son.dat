In Richard Wright's novel <b>Native</b> <b>Son,</b> Bigger Thomas drives the drunken Jan Erlone and Mary Dalton around Washington Park, as the two embrace.

5|$|Although many Old Court supporters—typically the state's wealthy aristocracy—gravitated to the National Republican Party (later to {{be called}} Whigs) that formed in the 1820s, it is {{inaccurate}} to assume the Anti-Relief Party as a whole became National Republicans and the Relief Party became Democrats. The primary factor in determining which party Kentuckians aligned with was their faith in Whig Party founder and <b>native</b> <b>son,</b> Henry Clay. From the election of Thomas Metcalfe in 1828 to the expiration of John L. Helm's term in 1851, only one Democrat held the office of governor: John Breathitt, who died {{a year and a}} half into his term and was succeeded in office by his lieutenant governor, James Turner Morehead, a National Republican.|$|E

5|$|On April 19, {{after the}} firing on Battle of Fort Sumter and in {{response}} to President Lincoln's call for 75,000 volunteers to suppress the rebellion, Virginia joined three more Southern states in seceding from the Union. <b>Native</b> <b>son</b> Pickett journeyed from Oregon to serve his state.

5|$|In 1832, the Democrats {{selected}} Breathitt and Benjamin Taylor {{as their}} candidates for governor and lieutenant governor, respectively. They faced a Whig (formerly National Republican) ticket of Richard Aylett Buckner and James Turner Morehead. Buckner was hurt by his extremely religious ideals, including opposition to handling mail on Sunday, {{and failed to}} garner the support {{of some of his}} own party's newspapers. Breathitt defeated Buckner by a small margin, but Morehead defeated Taylor, Breathitt's little-known running mate. Breathitt's election marked the first time a Democrat had ascended to the governorship of Kentucky. The election was marred by fraud, however. In Oldham County, the number of votes tallied represented 162.9% of the eligible voters in the county, and these votes broke two-to-one in favor of Breathitt. Most Kentuckians were more concerned about the upcoming presidential election, hoping Whig and <b>native</b> <b>son</b> Henry Clay would defeat Democrat Andrew Jackson. Because of this, most of the other state offices went to Whig candidates.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>Native</b> <b>Sons</b> {{began as}} an {{organization}} [...] "embracing only the sons of those sturdy pioneers who arrived on this coast prior to the admission of California as a state."

However, by contrast, the <b>Native</b> <b>Sons</b> actively fought for California Native American rights. [...] "The Commonwealth Club of San Francisco was looking into the matter of Indian rights under the 18 treaties as early as 1909.

The <b>Native</b> <b>Sons</b> was one of the groups that was active in this area.
