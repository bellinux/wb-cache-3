5|$|A low calorie diet extends median {{and maximum}} {{lifespan}} in many animals. This effect may involve {{a reduction in}} oxidative stress. While {{there is some evidence}} to support the role of oxidative stress in aging in model organisms such as Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans, the evidence in mammals is less clear. Indeed, a 2009 review of experiments in mice concluded that almost all manipulations of antioxidant systems had <b>no</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> aging.|$|E
5|$|According to Peter Woolley, {{director}} of Fairleigh Dickinson University's PublicMind poll, {{the situation of}} the election was similar to the 1990 election, when underdog Senate candidate Christie Whitman, a Republican, nearly defeated well-known Senator Bill Bradley due to Democratic Governor Jim Florio's sales- and income-tax increases. By August, Woolley concluded that the tax increase had had <b>no</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> Menendez's re-election chances.|$|E
5|$|Bacteria {{can also}} be used in the place of {{pesticides}} in the biological pest control. This commonly involves Bacillus thuringiensis (also called BT), a gram-positive, soil dwelling bacterium. Subspecies of this bacteria are used as a Lepidopteran-specific insecticides under trade names such as Dipel and Thuricide. Because of their specificity, these pesticides are regarded as environmentally friendly, with little or <b>no</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> humans, wildlife, pollinators and most other beneficial insects.|$|E

5|$|From {{the point}} of view of the {{domestic}} country, the subsidy is welfare improving. The 20 million subsidy is a transfer from the government to the firm hence it has <b>no</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> national welfare (ignoring costs of taxation; as long as these are not too large the basic insight of the model goes through). Additionally the domestic firm gains 50 million which would have otherwise gone to the foreign firm.|$|E
5|$|Others {{argue that}} there is no {{available}} evidence that demonstrates that any of these organisms are capable of causing aphthous stomatitis by themselves. Some people with aphthous stomatitis may show herpes virus within the epithelium of the mucosa, but without any productive infection. In some persons, attacks of ulceration occur {{at the same time as}} asymptomatic viral shedding and elevated viral titres. However, antiviral medication has <b>no</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> aphthous stomatitis.|$|E
5|$|Some {{substances}} {{which are}} toxic to humans have <b>no</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> bees. If bees obtain their nectar from certain flowers, the resulting honey can be psychoactive, or even toxic to humans, but innocuous to bees and their larvae. Poisoning from this honey is called mad honey disease.|$|E

The number of population in this research is 141 manufacturing companies which are listed in Indonesia Stock Exchange during 2012 to 2014. This research uses purposive sampling technique. The multiple linear regression analysis is used to analyze the data. There are 49 companies used as the samples of this study. Based on the conducted data analysis on this research, it concludes that:(1) the executive competence has <b>no</b> <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> tax avoidance (2) the firm size has <b>no</b> <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> tax avoidance (3) the independent commissioner has <b>no</b> <b>effects</b> <b>on</b> tax avoidance while (4) the institutional ownership affects tax avoidance...|$|R

5|$|The 2012 {{date was}} also loosely {{tied to the}} long-running concept of the Photon Belt, which {{predicted}} a form of interaction between Earth and Alcyone, the largest star of the Pleiades cluster. Critics argued that photons cannot form belts, that the Pleiades, located more than 400 light years away, could have <b>no</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> Earth, and that the Solar System, rather than getting closer to the Pleiades, was in fact moving farther away from it.|$|E

5|$|Viral {{infections in}} animals provoke an immune {{response}} that usually eliminates the infecting virus. Immune responses {{can also be}} produced by vaccines, which confer an artificially acquired immunity to the specific viral infection. However, some viruses including those that cause AIDS and viral hepatitis evade these immune responses and result in chronic infections. Antibiotics have <b>no</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> viruses, but several antiviral drugs have been developed.|$|E
5|$|A 2009 {{consensus}} {{from the}} studies of {{the introduction of the}} euro concluded that it has increased trade within the eurozone by 5% to 10%, although one study suggested an increase of only 3% while another estimated 9 to 14%. However, a meta-analysis of all available studies suggests that the prevalence of positive estimates is caused by publication bias and that the underlying effect may be negligible. Furthermore, studies accounting for time trend reflecting general cohesion policies in Europe that started before, and continue after implementing the common currency find <b>no</b> <b>effect</b> <b>on</b> trade. These results suggest that other policies aimed at European integration might be the source of observed increase in trade.|$|E
