25|$|Kormoran {{then moved}} to waters south of Ceylon, and around midday on 1 September, a large vessel, which Detmers {{determined}} to be an unaccompanied troopship, was spotted. Plans were made to attack that night, but the transport disappeared over the horizon during the afternoon {{and could not be}} relocated. Two days later, Detmers was informed that Kormoran would be replaced by Thor at the end of December, and that he would be resupplied by the supply ship Kulmerland, which had come from Japan and would wait for the raider at a predetermined rendezvous point from 12 October. Late on 23 September, the navigational lights for a ship were sighted. After signalling the merchant ship for her <b>name</b> <b>and</b> <b>nationality,</b> which identified her as the 3,941-ton Greek freighter Stamatios G. Embiricus, the raider shone searchlights on her and ordered her to stop and accept a boarding party. Those aboard the Greek ship assumed they were being pulled up by a British warship for not observing blackout conditions, and {{it was not until the}} armed Germans arrived on the ship that the nature of the 'warship' was revealed. Although captured intact, Stamantios G. Embiricus was a coal-fuelled ship, and did not have enough fuel to reach any destination other than her intended port, Colombo. The ship was scuttled at , but while a lifeboat carrying the ship's master and five crew rowed to Kormoran, a second lifeboat carrying the other 24 avoided capture in the dark. A search using one of the Arado seaplanes found them late the next morning.|$|E

2500|$|The term {{international}} {{child abduction}} is generally synonymous with international parental kidnapping, child snatching, and child stealing. [...] However, the more precise legal usage of {{international child abduction}} originates in private international law and refers to the illegal removal of children from their home by an acquaintance or family member to a foreign country. In this context, [...] "illegal" [...] is normally taken to mean [...] "in breach of custodial rights" [...] and [...] "home" [...] {{is defined as the}} child's habitual residence. As implied by the [...] "breach of custodial rights," [...] the phenomenon of international child abduction generally involves an illegal removal that creates a jurisdictional conflict of laws whereby multiple authorities and jurisdictions could conceivably arrive at seemingly reasonable and conflicting custodial decisions with geographically limited application. Such a result often strongly affects a child's access and connection to half their family and may cause the loss of their former language, culture, <b>name</b> <b>and</b> <b>nationality,</b> it violates numerous children's rights, and can cause severe psychological and emotional trauma to the child and family left behind.|$|E
2500|$|To {{coincide}} with National Poetry Day 1995, the British television programme The Bookworm conducted a poll {{to discover the}} nation's favourite poems, and subsequently published the winning poems in book form.

In some respects it became the nation's favourite poem by proxy... despite it being outside the competition." [...] This was all the more remarkable, since the <b>name</b> <b>and</b> <b>nationality</b> of the American poet did not become known until several years later. In 2004 The Times wrote: [...] "The verse demonstrated a remarkable power to soothe loss. It became popular, crossing national boundaries for use on bereavement cards and at funerals regardless of race, religion or social status".|$|E

2500|$|In August 1914, {{he started}} {{suffering}} from a progressive paralysis of the limbs. At {{the end of the}} war, Chamberlain's paralysis had already befallen much of his body; his chronically bad health had reached its final stage. By the time World War I started in 1914, Chamberlain remained British only by virtue of his <b>name</b> <b>and</b> <b>nationality.</b> When the war started, Chamberlain tried to enlist in the German Army, but was turned down on the account of his age (then 58) and bad health. In August 1914, Chamberlain wrote a letter to his brother, the Japanologist Basil Hall Chamberlain, explaining why he had sided with his adopted country that read: [...] "No war has ever been simpler than this; England has not for a moment reduced her efforts to do everything humanly possible to bring it about and to destroy every peaceful impulse...Germany's victory will not be England's ruin; quite the contrary, it is the only hope for England's rescue from the total ruin in which she now stands. England's victory will be terrible for the whole world, a catastrophe". The same month, Chamberlain published an essay celebrating Wilhelm II as an [...] "Aryan soldier-king" [...] and as a [...] "Siegfried" [...] who had embraced the [...] "struggle against the corroding poison of Jewry". Chamberlain went on to call the war [...] "a life-or-death struggle...between two human ideals: the German and the un-German". Accordingly, the Reich must [...] "for the next hundred years or more" [...] strengthen all things German and carry out [...] "the determined extermination of the un-German". Chamberlain happily welcomed the war, writing in September 1914 to his friend Prince Max of Baden: [...] "I thank God that I have been allowed to experience these two exaltations-1870 and 1914-and that I was both times in Germany and saw the truth with my own eyes." [...] In his 1914 essay, [...] "Whose Fault Is the War?", Chamberlain blamed the war on France, Russia and especially Britain. Chamberlain argued though St. Petersburg and Paris were both seeking war, it was London who had masterminded the war and the French and Russians were just British puppets. [...] Initially Chamberlain expected the war to be over by the end of 1914, and was very disappointed when that did not occur. In 1916 he also acquired German citizenship. He had already begun propagandising on behalf of the German government and continued to do so throughout the war. His vociferous denunciations of his land of birth, it has been posited, were the culmination of his rejection of his native England's capitalism, in favour of a form of German Romanticism akin to that which he had cultivated in himself during his years at Cheltenham. The British historian John C. G. RÃ¶hl wrote the war made the [...] "brutality in general and anti-Semitism in particular" [...] of people like the Kaiser and Chamberlain [...] "more intense".|$|E

5000|$|The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child [...] {{stresses}} {{the value and}} importance of a childâs identity.

The static aspects of identity concern attributes that make one visible to the outside world, for example, physical features, sex, <b>name,</b> genetics, <b>and</b> <b>nationality.</b> Dynamic aspects include morals and religious and cultural characteristics. Under Article 7, a child {{has a right to}} have a [...] "legal" [...] identity by being registered, and has a right to a <b>name</b> <b>and</b> a <b>nationality.</b> These protect mainly the static aspects of identity. However, Article 8 protects and encourages the childâs dynamic aspects of identity through preserving his or her identity in relation to <b>nationality,</b> <b>name</b> <b>and</b> family relations.
