5|$|A small, unisex monastic {{community}} in Bithynia, near Constantinople, may {{have developed the}} cross-in-square plan church during the Iconoclastic period, which would explain the plan's small scale and unified naos. The ruined church of St. John at Pelekete monastery is an early example. Monks had supported the use of icons, unlike the government-appointed secular clergy, and monasticism would become increasingly popular. A <b>new</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> privately funded urban monastery developed from the 9th century on, which may help to explain {{the small size of}} subsequent building.|$|E
25|$|While most robots {{today are}} {{installed}} in factories or homes, performing labour or life saving jobs, many <b>new</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> robot {{are being developed}} in laboratories around the world. Much of the research in robotics focuses not on specific industrial tasks, but on investigations into <b>new</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> robot, alternative ways to think about or design robots, and new ways to manufacture them.

40|$|Coordinate {{measuring}} machines (CMMs) {{have been}} conventionally {{used in industry}} for 3 -dimensional and form-error measurements of macro parts for many years. Ever since the first CMM, developed by Ferranti Co. in the late 1950 s, they have been regarded as versatile measuring equipment, yet many CMMs on the market still have inherent systematic errors due to the violation of the Abbe Principle in its design. Current CMMs are only suitable for part tolerance above 10 μm. With the rapid advent of ultraprecision technology, multi-axis machining, and micro/nanotechnology {{over the past twenty}} years, <b>new</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> ultraprecision and micro/nao-CMMs are urgently needed in all aspects of society. This Special Issue accepted papers revealing novel designs and applications of CMMs, including structures, probes, miniaturization, measuring paths, accuracy enhancement, error compensation, etc. Detailed design principles in sciences, and technological applications in high-tech industries, were required for submission. Topics covered, but were not limited to, the following areas: 1. <b>New</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> CMMs, such as Abbe-free, multi-axis, cylindrical, parallel, etc. 2. <b>New</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> probes, such as touch-trigger, scanning, hybrid, non-contact, microscopic, etc. 3. <b>New</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> Micro/nano-CMMs. 4. <b>New</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> measuring path strategy, such as collision avoidance, free-form surface, aspheric surface, etc. 5. <b>New</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> error compensation strategy...|$|R

The new-found clusters contain {{hundreds of thousands}} of stars, a similar number of stars that can be found in globular clusters. What distinguishes them from the globular clusters is that they are much larger—several hundred light-years across—and hundreds of times less dense. The distances between the stars are, therefore, much greater within the newly discovered extended clusters.|$|E
