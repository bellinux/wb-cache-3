50|$|Local {{changes for}} the Australian model {{included}} front seat modifications which improved headroom, and suspension tuning. The suspension was fully independent, with a coil/strut system fitted, incorporating anti-dive and <b>negative</b> <b>offset</b> <b>geometry</b> to aid stability in slippery conditions and under heavy braking. Anti-roll bars were fitted front and rear. The TX5 suspension also featured electronic variable shock absorbers—adjustable via a dashboard buttons for normal, automatic or sport. Along with the 626, the Telstar was Wheels magazine's Car of the Year for 1983.|$|E
50|$|Power {{steering}} {{helps the}} driver of a vehicle to steer by directing some of its power to assist in swiveling the steered road wheels about their steering axes. As vehicles have become heavier and switched to front wheel drive, particularly using <b>negative</b> <b>offset</b> <b>geometry,</b> along with increases in tire width and diameter, the effort needed to turn the wheels about their steering axis has increased, often {{to the point where}} major physical exertion would be needed were it not for power assistance. To alleviate this auto makers have developed power steering systems, or more correctly power-assisted steering, since on road-going vehicles {{there has to be a}} mechanical linkage as a fail-safe. There are two types of power steering systems: hydraulic and electric/electronic. A hydraulic-electric hybrid system is also possible.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. According to revised Cailikefu’s rolling {{shear force}} formula, motion path {{equation}} of spatial seven-bar path is built, and mechanical model, with such new structural features as asymmetric and <b>negative</b> <b>offset,</b> is thus successfully established for 2800 mm heavy shear of some Iron&Steel Company. Shear force and bar force of steel plate, {{before and after}} adoption of asymmetric and <b>negative</b> <b>offset</b> structure, are analyzed, as well as horizontal force component of mechanism that influences pure rolling shear and back-wall push force that keeps blade clearance. The discovery is that back-wall push force could be kept large enough at rolling start-up (i. e. {{the time that the}} maximum rolling shear produces), meanwhile, back-wall push force is the most approximate to side forces with adoption of 60 mm~ 100 mm offset. Theoretical results and on-site shear quality both indicate that new structural features such as asymmetric and <b>negative</b> <b>offset</b> {{plays an important role in}} ensuring pure rolling shear and keeping blade clearance constant, which provide an effective means to improve quality of steel plate...|$|R

40|$|Interactive 3 D {{applications}} require fast {{detection of}} objects colliding with the environment. One popular method for fast collision detection is to <b>offset</b> the <b>geometry</b> {{of the environment}} according to {{the dimensions of the}} object, and then represent the object as a point (and the object's movement as a line segment). Previously, this <b>geometry</b> <b>offset</b> has been done in a preprocessing step and therefore requires knowledge of the object's dimensions before runtime. Furthermore, an extra copy of the environment's geometry is required for each shape used in the application. This paper presents a variation of the BSP tree collision algorithm that shifts the planes in order to <b>offset</b> the <b>geometry</b> of the environment at runtime. To prevent unwanted cases where <b>offset</b> <b>geometry</b> protrudes too much, extra plane equations, which bevel solid cells of space during expansion, are added by simply inserting extra nodes {{at the bottom of the}} tree. A simple line segment check can be used for collision detection of a moving object of any size against the environment. Only one BSP tree is needed by the application. Successful usage within commercial entertainment software is also discussed...|$|R

Further performance improvement in offset design were achieved using a ground shield, which reduced the spillover noise to 11 K, and adding a dielectric rod within the wideband feed, which illuminated the antenna to improve sensitivity figure of merit from 0. 09 to 0. 12 m^ 2 /K The use of a mesh material for the offset reflector surface was also investigated.

50|$|The offset, {{measured}} in millimeters, can be negative or positive, {{and is the}} distance from the hub-mounting surface to the rim's true centerline. A positive offset means the hub-mounting surface is closer to the outside edge of the wheel, i.e. the wheel wraps around the hub and brake hardware more deeply; a <b>negative</b> <b>offset</b> means the hub-mounting surface is closer to the inside edge of the wheel and wheel sticks outwards more than inwards.|$|R

40|$|Examples of {{subsidence}} {{monitoring of}} multi-seam mining in Australian conditions are relatively limited {{compared to the}} extensive database of monitoring from single seam mining. The subsidence monitoring data now available from the mining of longwall panels in two seams at the Ashton Underground Mine (Ashton) provides an opportunity to significantly advance the understanding of subsidence behaviour in response to multi-seam mining in a regular <b>offset</b> <b>geometry.</b> This paper presents an analysis and interpretation of the multi-seam subsidence monitoring data from the first five panels in the second seam at the Ashton Underground Mine. The methods used to estimate subsidence effects for the planned third seam of mining are also presented. Observations {{of the characteristics of}} multi-seam subsidence indicate that although more complex than single seam mining, the subsidence movements are regular and reasonably predictable. Movements are constrained within the general footprint of the active panel. They are however sensitive to the relative panel geometries in each seam and to the direction of mining. In an <b>offset</b> <b>geometry,</b> tilt and strain levels are observed to remain at single seam levels despite the greater vertical displacement. At stacked goaf edges tilt and strain levels are up to four times greater. Latent subsidence recovered from the overlying seam has been identified as a key contributor to the subsidence outcomes. Some conventional single seam concepts such as angle of draw and subcritical/supercritical behaviour are less meaningful in a multi-seam environment...|$|R
