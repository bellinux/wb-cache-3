50|$|In {{order for}} the <b>cyclic</b> <b>prefix</b> to be {{effective}} (i.e. to serve its aforementioned objectives), {{the length of the}} <b>cyclic</b> <b>prefix</b> must be at least equal to the length of the multipath channel. Although the concept of <b>cyclic</b> <b>prefix</b> has been traditionally associated with OFDM systems, the <b>cyclic</b> <b>prefix</b> is now also used in single carrier systems to improve the robustness to multipath propagation.|$|R

The peak indices are then investigated and the decision for LTE signal existence is based on a majority vote for the number of peaks. The <b>normal</b> <b>cyclic</b> <b>prefix</b> configuration is assumed where the first OFDM symbol in the slot has a CP composed of 160 samples compared to 144 samples for the remaining 6 OFDM symbols.|$|E
30|$|Understanding {{the actual}} effect of RS {{interference}} is important. In a single antenna case, the RS occupies eight REs in each LTE DL resource block. When a <b>normal</b> <b>cyclic</b> <b>prefix</b> is used, the RS takes 4.76 % {{of all the}} REs. Since the RS covers only some of REs, it is not obvious how interference impacts on the end-to-end performance. In the analysis, we used a TD-LTE software radio platform developed at Aalto University [2] to measure this impact.|$|E
30|$|As {{illustrated}} in Fig.  4, the basic time unit for packet scheduling and transmission in LTE {{is called a}} TTI (transmission time interval) with a length of 1  ms. Thus, TTI is the time unit for LBPS to estimate {{the length of the}} sleep cycle in LTE. In each TTI, a scheduling decision is made where each scheduled UE is assigned a certain amount of radio resources in the time and frequency domain. In the time domain, a TTI is split into two 0.5 -ms slots. Each slot comprises seven orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) symbols {{in the case of the}} <b>normal</b> <b>cyclic</b> <b>prefix</b> length. In the frequency domain, resources are grouped in units of 12 subcarriers, such that one unit of 12 subcarriers for a duration of one slot is called a resource block (RB), which is the smallest element of resource allocation. The smallest unit of resource is the resource element (RE), which consists of one subcarrier for a duration of one OFDM symbol. Therefore, an RB is comprised of 84 (7 [*]×[*] 12) REs in the case of the <b>normal</b> <b>cyclic</b> <b>prefix</b> length.|$|E
30|$|In multi-carrier systems, {{information}} is modulated over multiple carriers. The well-known multi-carrier system {{is based upon}} OFDM. 1 In OFDM systems, at the transmitter side, an IFFT is applied to create an OFDM symbol and a <b>cyclic</b> <b>prefix</b> is appended {{to the start of}} an OFDM symbol. At the receiver, the <b>cyclic</b> <b>prefix</b> is removed and an FFT is applied to the received OFDM symbol. Note that frequency domain processing greatly simplifies receiver processing. The length of the <b>cyclic</b> <b>prefix</b> is designed to be larger than the span of the multipath channel. The portion of the <b>cyclic</b> <b>prefix</b> which is corrupted due to the multipath channel from the previous OFDM symbols is known as the inter-symbol interference (ISI) region. The remaining part of the <b>cyclic</b> <b>prefix</b> which is not affected by the multipath channel is known as the ISI-free region. Note that <b>cyclic</b> <b>prefix</b> can mainly remove the ISI and the proper design of the <b>cyclic</b> <b>prefix</b> length has been a design issue under research.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — The {{performance}} of the widely applied timedomain channel estimation for SISO- and MIMO-OFDM systems strongly depends on the preciseness of information regarding maximum channel impulse response (CIR) length. In practice the required CIR length is usually approximated by {{the length of the}} <b>cyclic</b> <b>prefix</b> which is an upper bound for most of the actual instantaneous CIR length. In this article 1, we introduce an appropriate channel length estimation method- named as FCLI (Frequency Domain Channel Length Indicator) which estimates the CIR length minimizing the estimated mean square error of an instantaneous channel estimate. The simulation results present that the FCLI outperforms the approximation of <b>cyclic</b> <b>prefix</b> length. In addition, we investigate two applications of FCLI on 1) <b>cyclic</b> <b>prefix</b> adaptation OFDM systems in which we minimize the overhead of the <b>cyclic</b> <b>prefix</b> by the estimated CIR length and 2) <b>cyclic</b> <b>prefix</b> free OFDM systems in which we directly re-construct the structure of cyclic repetition with reduced error. Compared to the traditional channel estimation with the approximation of <b>cyclic</b> <b>prefix</b> length, the overall system throughput of either <b>cyclic</b> <b>prefix</b> adaptation or <b>cyclic</b> <b>prefix</b> free OFDM transmission scheme is significantly enhanced regardless of perfect synchronization or practical distribution of time offsets.

40|$|Abstract—Reliable channel {{estimation}} {{is indispensable}} for orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) systems employing coherent detection and adaptive loading {{in order to}} achieve high data rate communications. Several options exist in practical OFDM systems—including training symbols, <b>cyclic</b> <b>prefix,</b> virtual carriers, pilot tones, and receiver diversity—to facilitate channel estimation. In this paper, a subspace blind channel estimation method based on exploiting the presence of virtual carriers is proposed for OFDM systems over a time-dispersive channel. The method can be applied to conventional OFDM systems with <b>cyclic</b> <b>prefix</b> as well as OFDM systems with no <b>cyclic</b> <b>prefix.</b> The reduction/elimination of <b>cyclic</b> <b>prefix</b> thereby provides the OFDM systems the potential to achieve higher channel utilization than most previously reported <b>cyclic</b> <b>prefix</b> based estimators. Sufficient channel identifiability condition is developed as well. Comparison with two other recently reported subspace methods is presented via computer simulations to support the effectiveness of the proposed method.

In particular, the {{downlink}} {{physical layer}} of the LTE specification [1] defines a symbol period T of 66.67 μ s, which corresponds to a subcarrier spacing Fsc= 1 /T of 15 kHz. The transmission grid is defined in time and frequency by resource blocks (RB), which are the minimum resource allocation unit formed by seven OFDM symbols and 12 subcarriers in the <b>normal</b> <b>cyclic</b> <b>prefix</b> configuration. The system bandwidth is scalable from 1.4 to 20 MHz, but the guard bands are left {{at the edges of}} the spectrum; thus, only a minimum transmission bandwidth of 6 RB (i.e. 1.08 MHz) and a maximum of 100 RB (i.e. 18 MHz) can be configured [6].|$|E
30|$|Finally, {{the packet}} {{aggregation}} method {{can be easily}} applied to LTE/LTE-A with minimal modifications (no modification to PHY/MAC layers). It is an efficient yet simple technique {{that can be used}} to improve the performance for the current and future cellular systems along with the following directions. First, when there are massive number of devices in a cell, the preamble collision rate becomes high, and as a result, the reliability of random access becomes lower (the network becomes congested [31]). With packet aggregation, the collision rate can be greatly reduced and the network congestion can be avoided. Second, it reduces the number of random access attempts in the end devices, which in turn saves power. Third, the packet aggregation method is highly applicable when the packet size is very small, e.g., less than 30 bytes, in which case the signaling overhead to schedule the packet becomes dominant with respect to the payload. Moreover, the minimum resource block in LTE/LTE-A contains 12 subcarriers with a duration of 1 ms (14 OFDM symbols for <b>normal</b> <b>cyclic</b> <b>prefix</b> length), which might be too large for transmission of small-sized packet. By the use of packet aggregation, packet size becomes larger, which alleviates the signaling overhead.|$|E
