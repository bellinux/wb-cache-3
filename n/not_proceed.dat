5|$|After Quatermass and the Pit Kneale {{felt that}} it was time to rest the character. By the early 1970s he had decided there were new avenues to explore, and the BBC planned a fourth Quatermass serial in 1972. The BBC did <b>not</b> <b>proceed</b> with the project, and Kneale's scripts were {{produced}} in 1979 as a four-part serial for Thames Television titled Quatermass.|$|E
5|$|Developed {{alongside}} the subsonic and smaller Hawker Siddeley P.1127/Kestrel, the P.1154 {{was derived from}} the P.1150. The P.1150 proposal did not meet NATO Basic Military Requirement 3 and, consequently, the P.1154 was born. This Mach 2-capable aircraft retained plenum chamber burning previously designed for the P.1150. Although the technical winner of eleven submissions, follow-on testing and production for the P.1154 did <b>not</b> <b>proceed</b> as a result of political strife.|$|E
5|$|Even so, {{and partly}} because of Sickles's {{unexpected}} location, Longstreet's assault did <b>not</b> <b>proceed</b> according to Lee's plan. Instead of wheeling left to join a simultaneous two-division push {{on either side of the}} Emmitsburg Road, Hood's division attacked in a more easterly direction than intended, and McLaws's and Anderson's divisions deployed brigade by brigade, in an en echelon style of attack, also heading more to the east than the intended northeast.|$|E

In April 2010, Kieftenbeld was being linked with a move to AZ, the reigning Dutch champions. By the beginning of June, all parties had agreed terms, but the financial situation at AZ and a change of ownership meant the deal did <b>not</b> <b>proceed.</b>|$|E
5|$|Shiller {{defeated}} Reed {{again in}} 2003, {{this time with}} 58% of the vote. Shiller again joined in unanimous support for Daley's 2004 budget. Shiller was the only alderman who did not cast {{a vote on the}} passage of the Big Box Ordinance, which required large retailers to pay a living wage. Target sent a letter to Mayor Daley and alderman indicating that if the ordinance were not overturned, they would <b>not</b> <b>proceed</b> on projects in Chicago. Shiller voted to sustain Daley's veto.|$|E
5|$|The two Mercedes {{exchanged}} new {{track record}} times as Rosberg, then Hamilton, {{and once again}} Rosberg set fast times during Q2. Bottas was again the fastest non-Mercedes runner, but teammate Felipe Massa was hindered by traffic and did <b>not</b> <b>proceed</b> into Q3. Also eliminated were Pastor Maldonado, Jenson Button, Felipe Nasr, and Daniil Kvyat, the latter two being bettered by a late fast lap from Max Verstappen.|$|E

5|$|When the German-led Axis {{invasion}} of Yugoslavia began on 6 April 1941, she {{was located in}} the Bay of Kotor on the southern Adriatic coast along with the three other submarines of the Submarine Division. On 10 April, Osvetnik and Hrabri received orders for an operation against the Italian enclave of Zara on the Dalmatian coastline, but the mission did <b>not</b> <b>proceed.</b> On 17 April, she was captured by the Italian XVII Corps at the Bay of Kotor.|$|E
5|$|At room temperature, it is a {{colourless}} gas, {{like all}} of the hydrogen halides except hydrogen fluoride, since hydrogen cannot form strong hydrogen bonds to the large and only mildly electronegative iodine atom. It melts at −51.0°C and boils at −35.1°C. It is an endothermic compound that can exothermically dissociate at room temperature, although the process is very slow unless a catalyst is present: the reaction between hydrogen and iodine at room temperature to give hydrogen iodide does <b>not</b> <b>proceed</b> to completion. The H–I bond dissociation energy is likewise {{the smallest of the}} hydrogen halides, at 295kJ/mol.|$|E
5|$|Boyars {{could no}} longer be {{executed}} without the knowledge and approval of the Transylvanian Prince and, if convicted for treason, their fortunes {{could no longer}} be confiscated. Apparently Michael was displeased with the final form of the treaty negotiated by his envoys, but was forced to comply. Prince Michael said in a conversation with the Polish envoy Lubieniecki: …they did <b>not</b> <b>proceed</b> as stated in their instructions but as their own good required and obtained privileges for themselves. He would try to avoid the obligations imposed on him {{for the rest of his}} reign.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} of Sophia's birth, Briggs had {{achieved}} a high standing within his profession. Nevertheless, he considered retiring from the sea to go into business with his seafaring brother Oliver, who had also grown tired of the wandering life. They did <b>not</b> <b>proceed</b> with this project, but instead each invested his savings in a share of a ship: Oliver in Julia A. Hallock, and Benjamin in Mary Celeste. In October 1872, Benjamin took command of Mary Celeste for her first voyage following her extensive New York refit, which was {{to take her to}} Genoa in Italy. He arranged for his wife and infant daughter to accompany him, while his school-aged son was left at home with his grandmother.|$|E
5|$|Demag was {{contracted}} {{to design a}} new version of the Sd.Kfz. 10 in 1944 with ten road wheels, a strengthened front axle, a strengthened idler crank arm, an improved track tensioner and increased ground clearance. Three prototypes were completed; two were delivered in September 1944, but the third was retained at the factory. Development, however, did <b>not</b> <b>proceed</b> any further. Yet another new version of the Sd.Kfz. 10 was proposed in the Emergency Development Program (Entwicklungs-Notprogramm) of 20 February 1945 with armored engine and driver's compartments that was to have had its development completed in June 1945.|$|E
5|$|Fertig {{was part}} of plans for a faction to feud with The Undertaker in mid-2008, however, he {{underwent}} hip surgery in September, and the plans did <b>not</b> <b>proceed.</b> He competed in his final match in FCW on December 4, when he, Sheamus, and Gavin Spears were defeated by Joe Hennig, Johnny Prime, and Eric Escobar in a six-man elimination match. In January 2009, he was offered a new contract with WWE, but turned it down. As a result, WWE {{announced that he had}} been released from contract by request on January 9, although his contract did not technically end until April 5, preventing him from wrestling for other promotions.|$|E

5|$|In May 2011, Gillard {{announced}} that Australia and Malaysia were finalising an arrangement to exchange asylum seekers. Gillard and Immigration Minister Chris Bowen {{said they were}} close to signing a bilateral agreement which would result in 800 asylum seekers who arrive in Australia by boat being taken to Malaysia instead. Australia would take 4,000 people from Malaysia who have previously been assessed as being refugees. However, on 31 August, the High Court ruled that the agreement to transfer refugees from Australia to Malaysia was invalid, and ordered that it <b>not</b> <b>proceed.</b> Australia would still accept 4,000 {{people who have been}} assessed as refugees in Malaysia.|$|E

She claimed {{she did not know}} why she was ordered to travel and her colleague Stephens claims he was also ordered with threats to travel to Bali by Chan, who showed him some photographs of his family, as they were going about their daily lives, saying that they would be killed if he did not co-operate.|$|E
5|$|Lewis Hamilton was fastest in Q2, two-tenths of {{a second}} ahead of his {{teammate}} Rosberg. In his last qualifying session with Lotus, Romain Grosjean experienced technical difficulties that forced {{him to come back}} into the pits. Even though he was sent out again, he was unable to set a time, stopping his car at turn seven. His teammate Pastor Maldonado also did <b>not</b> <b>proceed</b> into Q3, as did Jenson Button who missed out by two-tenths {{of a second}}. The two other drivers eliminated were Felipe Nasr for Sauber and Max Verstappen, who was unable to match the time of his teammate Carlos Sainz Jr.|$|E

Under the approved structure for the Expeditionary Force, No. 1 Fighter Wing was to command No.7 and No. 15 Squadrons. This plan proved short-lived as on 20 October the Government announced that the formation of the Expeditionary Force would <b>not</b> <b>proceed,</b> with the Empire Air Training Scheme instead being the RAAF's main contribution to overseas campaigns.|$|E

Lewis {{was placed in the}} second heat of two during the 17 August qualification round. During the round, Lewis completed his event with a final distance of 17.06meters, ranking fifth in a heat of 18 competitors. Lewis was 0.24 meters short of Chinese triple jumper Li Yanxi, who ranked first in the heat and later ranked tenth in finals. Overall, Lewis ranked 15th out of 37 competitors in the qualification round, and did <b>not</b> <b>proceed</b> to finals.|$|E
5|$|The nuclear {{reactors}} were decommissioned {{at the end}} of the Cold War, and the Hanford site is the focus of one of the world's largest environmental cleanup, managed by the Department of Energy under the oversight of the Washington Department of Ecology and the Environmental Protection Agency. Nearby aquifers contain an estimated 270billionUSgallons (1billionm3) of groundwater contaminated by high-level nuclear waste that has leaked out of Hanford's underground storage tanks. , 1millionUSgallons (3,785m3) of highly radioactive waste is traveling through groundwater toward the Columbia River. This waste is expected to reach the river in 12 to 50years if cleanup does <b>not</b> <b>proceed</b> on schedule.|$|E
