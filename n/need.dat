50|$|Changes {{regarding}} {{the importance and}} satisfaction of <b>needs</b> from the retrospective peacetime to the wartime due to stress varied significantly across cultures (the US vs. the Middle East). For the US citizens, {{there was only one}} level of <b>needs</b> since all <b>needs</b> were considered equally important. With regards to satisfaction of <b>needs</b> during the war, in the US there were three levels: physiological <b>needs,</b> safety <b>needs,</b> and psychological <b>needs</b> (social, self-esteem, and self-actualization). During the war, the satisfaction of physiological <b>needs</b> and safety <b>needs</b> were separated into two independent <b>needs</b> while during peacetime, they were combined as one. For the people of the Middle East, the satisfaction of <b>needs</b> changed from three levels to two during wartime.|$|R

It found that a considerable portion of articles focused solely on health care <b>needs.</b> Many tools focused specifically on psychological or psychosocial <b>needs</b> and only one tool identified included a broad range of <b>needs</b> for health.
