40|$|PURPOSE: To {{establish}} a preoperative decision model for accurate indication of systemic therapy in early-stage breast cancer using multiparametric MRI at 7 -tesla field strength. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients eligible for breast-conserving therapy were consecutively included. Patients underwent conventional diagnostic workup and one preoperative multiparametric 7 -tesla breast MRI. The postoperative (gold standard) indication for systemic therapy was established from resected tumor and lymph-node tissue, based on 10 -year risk-estimates {{of breast cancer}} mortality and relapse using Adjuvant! Online. Preoperative indication was estimated using similar guidelines, but from conventional diagnostic workup. Agreement was established between preoperative and postoperative indication, and MRI-characteristics used to improve agreement. MRI-characteristics included phospomonoester/phosphodiester (PME/PDE) ratio on 31 -phosphorus spectroscopy (31 P-MRS), apparent diffusion coefficients on diffusion-weighted imaging, and tumor size on dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) -MRI. A decision model was built to estimate the postoperative indication from preoperatively available data. RESULTS: We included 46 women (age: 43 - 74 yrs) with 48 invasive carcinomas. Postoperatively, 20 patients (43 %) had positive, and 26 patients (57 %) <b>negative</b> <b>indication</b> for systemic therapy. Using conventional workup, positive preoperative indication agreed excellently with positive postoperative indication (N = 8 / 8; 100 %). Negative preoperative indication was correct in only 26 / 38 (68 %) patients. However, 31 P-MRS score (p = 0. 030) and tumor size (p = 0. 002) {{were associated with the}} postoperative indication. The decision model shows that <b>negative</b> <b>indication</b> is correct in 21 / 22 (96 %) patients when exempting tumors larger than 2. 0 cm on DCE-MRI or with PME>PDE ratios at 31 P-MRS.

40|$|In {{breast cancer}} therapy, the {{indication}} for systemic therapy is typically based on prognostic markers from the surgical excision specimen. If such is unavailable, for instance prior to tumor ablation therapy, the indication for adjuvant systemic therapy may be assessed from pretreatment biopsies. The effect {{of differences in}} tumor characteristics between biopsy and excision specimen on agreement in indication for systemic therapy is, however, largely unknown. The {{aim of this study}} is to determine the agreement in eligibility for systemic therapy between preoperative and postoperative assessment. Secondly, to identify which patient-, tumor- or lymph node characteristics may influence this agreement. In this retrospective study, 300 consecutive female patients with primary invasive breast carcinoma on biopsy were included. Indication for systemic therapy was determined separately from biopsied tissue and from excision specimens using national guidelines based on adjuvant! online. Agreement was assessed, and patient-, tumor- and lymph node characteristics affecting agreement analyzed. Agreement in tumor characteristics between biopsy and excision specimen varied from high (ER-status: 99 %), to lower (tumor grade: 62 %, tumor size: 59 %, and lymph node status: 67 %). Without preoperative sentinel node biopsy (SNB), agreement on systemic therapy exists in 77 % of patients (kappa =  0, 547). Positive pretreatment indication for systemic therapy was highly indicative of the postoperative indication (PPV =  94 %). <b>Negative</b> <b>indication</b> was, however, only indicative in 67 % of patients. Conversely, with preoperative SNB, agreement on <b>negative</b> <b>indication</b> was raised to 89 %. Agreement was especially high for ER-negative status, tumor grade 3, tumor size > 2 cm, lymph node positivity at biopsy and a negative preoperative SNB. A positive indication for systemic therapy from biopsy is highly indicative for a positive indication from the excision specimen. When the indication is negative, additional stratification using preoperative SNB raises the agreement. Still, discordance occurs in 1 out of 10 patients...|$|E

The sequence of the abundance of major ions {{is found in the}} order of Ca 2 + > Na+ > Mg 2 + > K+ and Cl− > SO 42 − > HCO 3 − > NO 3 −. The dominated hydrochemical facies of groundwater are CaCl, and mixed CaMgCl. A Gibb’s diagram indicates that rock weathering and evaporation are the dominant process controlling groundwater quality in the area.

40|$|An {{evaluation}} {{of a large number}} of air sample filters was undertaken using a commercial alpha and beta spectroscopy system employing a passive implanted planar silicon (PIPS) detector. Samples were only measured after air flow through the filters had ceased. Use of a commercial radon stripping algorithm was implemented to discriminate anthropogenic alpha activity on the filters from the radon progeny. When uncontaminated air filters were evaluated, the results showed that there was a time-dependent bias in both average estimates and measurement dispersion of anthropogenic activity estimates with the relative bias being small compared to the dispersion, indicating that the system would not give false positive indications for an appropriately set decision level. By also measuring environmental air sample filters simultaneously with electroplated alpha filters, use of the radon stripping algorithm demonstrated a number of substantial unexpected deviations from calibrated values indicating that the system would give false <b>negative</b> <b>indications.</b> Use of the current algorithm is, therefore, not recommended for general assay applications. Use of the PIPS detector should only be utilized for gross counting without appropriate modifications to the curve-fitting algorithm.

40|$|Disordered {{regions are}} {{sequences}} within proteins {{that fail to}} fold into a fixed tertiary structure and {{have been shown to}} be involved in a variety of biological functions. We recently applied neural network predictors of disorder developed from X-ray data to several protein sequences characterized as disordered by NMR (Garner, Cannon, Romero, Obradovic and Dunker, Genome Informatics, 9 : 201 – 213, 1998). A few predictions on the NMR-characterized disordered regions were noted to contain “false ” <b>negative</b> <b>indications</b> of order that correlated with regions of function. These and additional examples are examined in more detail here. Overall, 8 of 9 functional segments in 5 disordered proteins were identified or partially identified by this approach. The functions of these regions appear to involve binding to DNA, RNA, and proteins. These regions are known to undergo disorder-to-order transitions upon binding. This apparent ability of the predictors to identify functional regions in disordered proteins could be due to the existence of different flavors, or sub-classes of disorder, originating from the sequence of the disordered regions and perhaps owing to local inclinations toward order. These different flavors may be a characteristic that could be used to identify binding regions within proteins that are difficult to characterize structurally. ...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: This article {{summarizes}} {{the third step}} of a research program to identify variables that supplement the predictive power of the the Eastern Cooperative On-cology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) for sur-vival. The objective was to produce a simple, practical, stratification factor for phase III oncology clinical trials involving patients with advanced malignant disease. Patients and Methods: A questionnaire was adminis-tered to 729 patients with metastatic colorectal or lung cancers. Patients provided a Karnofsky index and appe-tite rating while physicians provided a survival estimate and the ECOG-PS. Scores for each item were categorized as having a positive, neutral, or <b>negative</b> <b>indication</b> for survival. A patient was classified as having a relatively good prognosis if three {{or more of the}} four items showed a positive indication, a bad prognosis if three or more items were negative, and an uncertain prognosis other-wise (Good/Bad/Uncertain [GBU] index). Results: The GBU index improved on the prognos-tic power of a Cox model quartile index and PS alone and increased the accuracy of survival classification estimates by 5 % to 10 % more than ECOG-PS alone. For patients with PS of 0 or 1, significant survival patterns exist between GBU groups (P 5. 002 and. 0001, respectively). Conclusion: The GBU index may be recommended as a supplementary stratification factor for certain fu-ture phase III trials in metastatic lung or colorectal cancer where patient heterogeneity is a particular con-cern. The GBU represents a relatively modest increase to the cost and patient burden of a clinical trial given the additional control that is achieved over the potentially confounding concomitant to the treatment variable...|$|E
40|$|The {{realization}} that complex {{systems such as}} ecological communities can collapse or shift regimes suddenly and without rapid external forcing poses a serious challenge to our understanding {{and management of the}} natural world. The potential to identify early warning signals that would allow researchers and managers to predict such events before they happen has therefore been an invaluable discovery that offers a way forward in spite of such seemingly unpredictable behavior. Research into early warning signals has demonstrated {{that it is possible to}} define and detect such early warning signals in advance of a transition in certain contexts. Here we describe the pattern emerging as research continues to explore just how far we can generalize these results. A core of examples emerges that shares three properties: the phenomenon of rapid regime shifts, a pattern of ’critical slowing down’ that can be used to detect the approaching shift, and a mechanism of bifurcation driving the sudden change. As research has expanded beyond these core examples, it is becoming clear that not all systems that show regime shifts exhibit critical slowing down, or vice versa. Even when systems exhibit critical slowing down, statistical detection is a challenge. We review the literature that explores these edge cases and highlight the need for (a) new early warning behaviors that can be used in cases where rapid shifts do not exhibit critical slowing down, (b) the development of methods to identify which behavior might be an appropriate signal when encountering a novel system; bearing in mind that a positive indication for some systems is a <b>negative</b> <b>indication</b> in others, and (c) statistical methods that can distinguish between signatures of early warning behaviors and noise...|$|E
40|$|Many {{bacterial}} pathogens promote {{infection and}} cause disease by directly injecting into host cells proteins that manipulate eukaryotic cellular processes. Identification of these translocated proteins {{is essential to}} understanding pathogenesis. Yet, their identification remains limited. This, in part, is due to their general sequence uniqueness, which confounds homology-based identification by comparative genomic methods. In addition, their absence often does not result in phenotypes in virulence assays limiting functional genetic screens. Translocated proteins have been observed to confer toxic phenotypes when expressed in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This observation suggests that yeast growth inhibition {{can be used as}} an indicator of protein translocation in functional genomic screens. However, limited information is available regarding the behavior of non-translocated proteins in yeast. We developed a semi-automated quantitative assay to monitor the growth of hundreds of yeast strains in parallel. We observed that expression of half of the 19 Shigella translocated proteins tested but almost none of the 20 non-translocated Shigella proteins nor ∼ 1, 000 Francisella tularensis proteins significantly inhibited yeast growth. Not only does this study establish that yeast growth inhibition is a sensitive and specific indicator of translocated proteins, but we also identified a new substrate of the Shigella type III secretion system (TTSS), IpaJ, previously missed by other experimental approaches. In those cases where the mechanisms of action of the translocated proteins are known, significant yeast growth inhibition correlated with the targeting of conserved cellular processes. By providing positive rather than <b>negative</b> <b>indication</b> of activity our assay complements existing approaches for identification of translocated proteins. In addition, because this assay only requires genomic DNA it is particularly valuable for studying pathogens that are difficult to genetically manipulate or dangerous to culture...|$|E

In this paper, a method is proposed for monitoring the larvae of Osmoderma eremita in their natural habitat (i. e. hollow trees), using a conservation detection dog (CDD). Wood mould sampling (WMS), the standard method to detect hermit beetles and other saproxylic insects inside tree hollows, is time-consuming and exposes the target species and the whole saproxylic communities to some risks. In contrast, CDDs pose no risk to the species living inside trees while, at the same time, offer {{a powerful tool for}} surveying the insects.

Results are presented for nitrocellulose filters with the odour of the target species, for larvae living inside hollow trees, for frass and for the remains of adults.

40|$|A problem {{popularly known}} as “cold fusion ” was brought, {{although}} in an unusual way, {{to the attention of}} the scientific community. Although much discussion was (and is still) devoted to whether this effect is connected with any known nuclear reactions, the latter being widely questioned, there is no doubt that the general interest in the problem was provoked by the claim of the possibility of producing excess energy, i. e., energy surmounting the energy breakeven value. Unlike the clearly <b>negative</b> <b>indications</b> so far in terms of known nuclear processes taking place, however, careful analysis reveals that the claims in the principal negative papers published so far with respect to the existence of excess energy are in disagreement with the raw experimental data whenever such is presented in those papers.

40|$|Contamination in low {{permeability}} soils poses a significant technical challenge to in situ remediation efforts. Poor accessibility to the contaminants and difficulty in delivery of treatment reagents have rendered existing in situ treatments such as bioremediation, vapor extraction, and pump and treat rather ineffective {{when applied to}} {{low permeability}} soils present at many contaminated sites. The technology is an integrated in situ treatment in which established geotechnical methods are used to install degradation zones directly in the contaminated soil, and electro-osmosis is utilized to move the contaminants {{back and forth through}} those zones until the treatment is completed. The present Topical Report for Task No. 6 summarizes the results of a study of the potential for stimulating microbial reductive dehalogenation as part of the integrated in situ treatment process at the field experiment test site at DOE`s Gaseous Diffusion Plant in Paducah, Kentucky. A series of {open_quotes}microcosm bottle tests{close_quotes} were performed on samples of contaminated soil and groundwater taken from the Paducah site and spiked with trichloroethene (TCE). A number of bottles were set up, each spiked with a different carbon source in order to enhance the growth of different microbial subpopulations already present within the indigenous population in the soil. In addition, a series of bottle tests were completed with samples of the granular activated carbon (GAC) treatment zone material retrieved from the test site during the Paducah field experiment. In these tests, the GAC samples were used in place of the soil. Results of the soil-groundwater microcosms yielded a <b>negative</b> <b>indication</b> of the presence of dechlorinating bacteria at the site.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{false indication}} probabilities {{in the context}} of the Mitigating System Performance Index (MSPI), in order to investigate the pros and cons of different approaches to resolving two coupled issues: (1) sensitivity to the prior distribution used in calculating the Bayesian-corrected unreliability contribution to the MSPI, and (2) whether (in a particular plant configuration) to model the fuel oil transfer pump (FOTP) as a separate component, or integrally to its emergency diesel generator (EDG). False indication probabilities were calculated for the following situations: (1) all component reliability parameters at their baseline values, so that the true indication is green, meaning that an indication of white or above would be false positive; (2) one or more components degraded to the extent that the true indication would be (mid) white, and “false” would be green (negative) or yellow (negative) or red (negative). In key respects, this was the approach taken in NUREG- 1753. The prior distributions examined were the constrained noninformative (CNI) prior used currently by the MSPI, a mixture of conjugate priors, the Jeffreys noninformative prior, a nonconjugate log(istic) -normal prior, and the minimally informative prior investigated in (Kelly et al., 2010). The mid-white performance state was set at ?CDF = ? 10 ? 10 - 6 /yr. For each simulated time history, a check is made of whether the calculated ?CDF is above or below 10 - 6 /yr. If the parameters were at their baseline values, and ?CDF > 10 - 6 /yr, this is counted as a false positive. Conversely, if one or all of the parameters are set to values corresponding to ?CDF > 10 - 6 /yr but that time history’s ?CDF < 10 - 6 /yr, this is counted as a false <b>negative</b> <b>indication.</b> The false indication (positive or negative) probability is then estimated as the number of false positive or negative counts divided by the number of time histories (100, 000).

40|$|Antibiotic Feed Additives (AFA) {{have been}} used to prevent many {{bacterial}} infections during weaning of livestock. The use of these AFA’s resulted in the development of multiresistant bacterial strains and was therefore banned by the European Union. The United States also restricted the use of these feed additives considerably. Many scientists have started to search for alternatives in the prophylactic and therapeutic treatment of bacterial infections. Plants {{have been used}} traditionally by resource poor {{people all over the world}} to treat many infections. Diarrhoea not only causes many problems in the high intensity production of livestock but also leads to many human deaths. A large number of plants {{have been used to}} treat diarrhoea in humans and animals. Several authors have selected one or two species based on traditional use to evaluate in depth. In this project several different relevant parameters of 53 plant species used traditionally to treat diarrhoea were investigated in order to develop a model that would identify the species with the highest chance of delivering a useful antibacterial product. Antibacterial activities against two pathogens important in diarrhoea (Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli) were positive parameters in selecting species. Because tannins frequently have antibacterial activity, but are not useful as prophylactic agents due to their effect on production, high tannin content was considered to be a <b>negative</b> <b>indication.</b> Cellular toxicity was also used as a negative parameter at a later stage. In addition to the in vitro assays there are also other parameters to be investigated to evaluate the potential use of plants. The influence of season of collection was determined on the antibacterial activity and tannin content of acetone leaf extracts of five plant species traditionally used to treat diarrhoea. They were Acacia karroo, Acacia sieberiana var. woodii, Peltophorum africanum, Trichilia emetica and Ziziphus mucronata. The antibacterial activity varied depending on the season of collection with the best activity generally in the months of late summer to autumn (January to April). The activity of Acacia karoo against E. coli was best in the month of April (MIC = 0. 11 mg/ml (TA = 332 ml/g)) and against S. aureus in the month of March (MIC = 0. 06 mg/ml (TA = 334 ml/g)). Acacia sieberiana subsp. woodii extracts had the best activity against E. coli (MIC = 0. 10 mg/ml (TA = 303 ml/g)) in March against S. aureus in April (MIC = 0. 08 mg/ml (TA = 303 ml/g)). <i. Peltophorum africanum extracts were most active against E. coli in February (MIC = 0. 05 mg/ml (TA = 1188 ml/g)) and against S. aureus in February and March (MIC = 0. 04 mg/ml (TA = 1188 ml/g and 1075 ml/g)). Trichilia emetica extracts were generally not very active against the bacterial strains (best activity: MIC = 0. 22 mg/ml (TA = 74 ml/g) against E. coli in May and MIC = 0. 28 mg/ml (TA = 26 ml/g) against S. aureus in December). Ziziphus mucronata was most active against both bacterial strains and in May (E. coli: MIC = 0. 10 mg/ml (TA = 589 ml/g); S. aureus: MIC = 0. 04 mg/ml (TA = 1099 ml/g)). The tannin content varied in the extracts as well. The antibacterial activity however did not seem to be directly correlated to the tannin content. Another important parameter in the use of plant species is to determine the interspecies variation of plants based on genetic or environmental influences. Leaves from 42 plants of Combretum molle were collected at different locations during the same season. The average MIC against E. coli was 0. 227 mg/ml. The low standard deviation of 0. 07 indicates that there was very little variation in activity. The average value against S. aureus was 0. 399 mg/ml with a slightly higher standard deviation of 0. 16. However due to the fact that the samples from different areas extracted different amounts, the total activity varied. The tannin assays revealed that there was with one exception no correlation between the antibacterial activity and the tannin content. So it can be safe to assume that genetic variation does not influence the activity too much at least in C. molle leaves Fifty three plant species traditionally used to treat diarrhoea in published literature were then ranked using a novel system in order to determine which species had the most potential value. Ranking was based on the lowest MIC value against E. coli, lower activity against S. aureus (to limit selecting for general metabolic toxins), low tannin concentration and high extract yield. From this ranking, five plants were chosen to investigate their potential value further: Acacia sieberiana var. woodii (E. coli: MIC = 0. 13 mg/ml, TA = 108 ml/g; S. aureus: MIC = 0. 13 mg/ml, TA = 108 ml/g; Yield = 14 mg), Albizia adianthifolia (E. coli: MIC = 0. 14 mg/ml, TA = 239 ml/g; S. aureus: MIC = 0. 04 mg/ml, TA = 765 ml/g; Yield = 34 mg), Deinbollia oblongifolia (E. coli: MIC = 0. 17 mg/ml, TA = 158 ml/g; S. aureus: MIC = 0. 08 mg/ml, TA = 338 ml/g; Yield = 27 mg), Spirostachys africana (E. coli : MIC = 0. 13 mg/ml, TA = 300 ml/g; S. aureus: MIC = 0. 09 mg/ml, TA = 438 ml/g; Yield = 38 mg) and Tetradenia riparia (E. coli : MIC = 0. 09 mg/ml, TA = 214 ml/g; S. aureus: MIC = 0. 13 mg/ml, TA = 149 ml/g; Yield = 20 mg). None of the plants contained any tannin. The next step towards the recommendation of a plant for the development of a commercial product was to evaluate the cytotoxicity of the selected five species. The following values were obtained: Acacia sieberiana var. woodii LC 50 = 0. 026 mg/ml, Albizia adianthifolia LC 50 = 0. 068 mg/ml, Deinbollia oblongifolia LC 50 = 0. 078 mg/ml, Spirostachys africana LC 50 = 0. 025 mg/ml and Tetradenia riparia LC 50 = 0. 028 mg/ml. Deinbollia oblongifolia (for its low LC 50 value) and Spirostachys africana (for its good antibacterial activity and total activity) were potentized by removing inactive compounds through solvent-solvent fractionation. The antibacterial activity against E. coli was increased this way (MIC = 0. 08 mg/ml for Deinbollia oblongifolia (chloroform fraction) and MIC = 0. 08 mg/ml for Spirostachys africana (chloroform fraction)) The LC 50 values for both chloroform fractions were determined (LC 50 = 0. 188 mg/ml for Deinbollia oblongifolia and LC 50 = 0. 062 mg/ml for Spirostachys africana). The selectivity index (SI) was also determined and proved that the potentization was indeed successful (Deinbollia oblongifolia SI = 2. 35 compared to a value of 0. 45 for the crude extract; Spirostachys africana SI = 0. 78 compared to a value of 0. 19 for the crude extract). Based on these values, the chloroform fraction of Deinbollia oblongifolia was chosen as the less toxic one with similar activity and a higher selectivity index to be worked on further. One of the active compounds was isolated and evaluated for its activity against E. coli (MIC = 0. 74 mg/ml) The LC 50 value of 0. 042 mg/ml indicated that the activity of the extract was a result of synergism rather than being due to a single active compound (the selectivity index (SI) was 0. 06 compared to the values of 0. 45 for the crude and 2. 35 for the potentized extract). The plant extracts should of course be as effective against pathogenic strains as they were against the ATCC strains and so the extracts and pure compound of Deinbollia oblongifolia were tested for their activity against four different pathological E. coli strains. The results showed that the crude extract and the fraction were as active as in the preliminary screening results against only one of the four pathological strains. The pure compound on the other hand was more active against all four pathological strains than against the ATCC strain. The next step was to test the safety of the extracts of Deinbollia oblongifolia in mammals. Unfortunately neither the crude extract nor the chloroform fraction of Deinbollia oblongifolia could be used safely in a living organism or in an isolated organ study. A part of the problem may have been caused by the vehicle used in the study despite reports in the literature that an acetone water mixture is safe to use. In general all the species investigated had good antibacterial activity against E. coli this supports the traditional use of these species although we used acetone as extractant rather than the water used traditionally. There were major differences in antibacterial activity over a season indicating that mature leaves were more active than young leaves before senescence started. At least in the case of Combretum molle there was little difference in the antibacterial activity of many plants collected at different locations during the same season. The results obtained in this study could be useful in further studies to develop extracts that can be used to control diarrhoea in animals. Possibly more emphasis should be put on the difference in activity towards E. coli and S. aureus to eliminate the presence of general metabolic toxins. Such an approach would lead to a different priority order for species to examine. A major first step would probably be to test the in vitro and in vivo toxicity of selected species.

40|$|Structural health {{monitoring}} {{is a process}} of evaluating and ensuring the safety and integrity of structural systems by converting sensor data into structural {{health monitoring}} information. The first and most important objective of structural health monitoring is to ascertain with confidence if damage is present or not. The idea is to characterize only the normal condition of a structure and the baseline data are used as a reference. When data are measured during continuous monitoring, the new data are compared with the reference. A significant deviation from the reference will signal damage. This decision-making procedure necessitates the establishment of a decision boundary. Choosing the decision boundary is often {{based on the assumption that}} the distribution of the data is Gaussian in nature. While the problem of damage detection focuses attention on the outliers or extreme values of the data, i. e. those points in the tails of the distribution, the establishment of the decision boundary based on the normality assumption weighs the central population of the data. This unwarranted assumption about the nature of the data distribution can significantly impair the performance of a structural health monitoring system by increasing false positive and <b>negative</b> <b>indications</b> of damage. In this study, a robust and automated damage classifier is developed by properly modeling the tails of the distribution using extreme value statistics. ...|$|R

40|$|Methods to {{determine}} peridiodicity in protein sequences {{are useful for}} inferring function. Fourier transformation is one approach but care is required to ensure the periodicity is genuine. Here we have shown that empirically-derived statistical tables {{can be used as}} a measure of significance. Genuine protein sequences data rather than randomly generated sequences were used as the statistical backdrop. The method has been applied to G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) sequences, by Fourier transformation of hydrophobicity values, codon frequencies and the extent of over-representation of codon pairs; the latter being related to translational step times. Genuine periodicity was observed in the hydrophobicity whereas the apparent periodicity (as inferred from previously reported measures) in the translation step times was not validated statistically. GCR 2 has recently been proposed as the plant GPCR receptor for the hormone abscisic acid. It has homology to the Lanthionine synthetase C-like family of proteins, an observation confirmed by fold recognition. Application of the Fourier transform algorithm to the GCR 2 family revealed strongly predicted seven fold periodicity in hydrophobicity, suggesting why GCR 2 has been reported to be a GPCR, despite <b>negative</b> <b>indications</b> in most transmembrane prediction algorithms. The underlying multiple sequence alignment, also required for the Fourier transform analysis of periodicity, indicated that the hydrophobic regions around the 7 GXXG motifs commence near the C-terminal end of each of the 7 inner helices of the α-toroid and continue to the N-terminal region of the helix. The results clearly explain why GCR 2 has been understandably but erroneously predicted to be a GPCR. © 2008 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Summary: Using commercially {{available}} radioimmune test kits, serial determinations of serum j 32 -microglobulin and CEA were performed in 337 patients, {{who had been}} treated for breast cancer by modified radical mastectomy and radiotherapy. The pre-therapeutic data indicated {{a higher incidence of}} pathological j 32 -microglobulin and CEA levels in patients with distant metastases than in patients with localized disease. However, this finding did not allow the con-clusion of a direct complementarity of j 32 -microglobulin and CEA as tumour markers, since the group of patients with distant metastasis contained a high percentage of elderly patients who generally can be expected to have elevated 02 -microglobulin serum concentrations. Therefore, the correlation of the clinical course of malignant disease and the incidence of relapses with the changes of serum | 32 -microglobulin and CEA concentrations was examined during the posMreatment surveillance: 7 / 9 cases (78 %) with local recurrence and 46 / 73 cases (63 %) with distant spread of disease were not indicated in the | 32 -microglobulin follow-up by pathologic serum concentrations, whereas in the CEA follow-up only 1 / 9 and 2 / 73 false <b>negative</b> <b>indications</b> were registered. The poor correlation suggests that serum 02 -microglobulin is not directly tumour associated in breast cancer and does not fulfill the criteria of a tumour marker.

40|$|More {{accurate}} {{characterization of}} breast cancer is desirable prior to therapy. MR imaging may ultimately help to resolve the discordant preoperative information from conventional diagnostic workup {{of breast cancer}}. Breast MRI has shown potential to provide information on tumor biology, which is related to patient prognosis. The presence of rim enhancement on DCE-MRI has shown strong association with inferior long-term outcome in patients with triple-negative breast cancer, and {{may serve as a}} predictive biomarker for more individualized therapy. For imaging of tumor response to NAC, combining DCE-MRI with PET/CT may result in optimal response monitoring of ER-positive tumors. However, for HER 2 -positive and triple-negative tumors, DCE-MRI was found optimal. In a multiparametric imaging setting, combining DCE-MRI with DWI and 31 P-MRS at 7 T was shown clinically feasible to visualize tumor biomarkers. Also, associations were found between ADC and tumor grade, and between 31 P-MRS and mitotic count of invasive breast cancers. Concerning therapy selection in early-breast cancer, in the preoperative setting, a positive indication for systemic therapy is in high concordance with a positive postoperative indication. Hence, based on conventional diagnostic workup consisting of conventional imaging, tumor biopsy, and assessment of lymph nodes with ultrasound and fine needle aspiration of suspected nodes, an indication for NAC could be extended to patients with early breast cancers showing a positive preoperative indication for systemic therapy. For a <b>negative</b> preoperative <b>indication,</b> MRI may play a role, as DCE-MRI and 31 P-MRS were seen to raise confidence towards a <b>negative</b> postoperative <b>indication.</b> Potentially, in future perspective, after validation of our results, these patients may be selected for a less invasive treatment...|$|R
40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: Substantial {{variations}} {{have been}} reported in the advice given by competing guidelines addressing the same clinical problem. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the usefulness of classification tree analysis in comparing competing guidelines. METHOD: The authors implemented a classification tree-growing algorithm on cross-sectional data from 818 patients to determine indications for prophylactic heparin treatment common to 4 competing guidelines disseminated between 1998 and 2000 and addressing the prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism in medical inpatients. RESULTS: The resulting classification tree involved 10 terminal nodes. Its mean accuracy estimated by performing 10 -fold cross-validation was 82 % (s= 3). The guidelines consistently supported prophylactic heparin treatment for 5 indications: a previous episode of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, recent paralysis of lower limb(s), congestive heart failure with one or more risk factors, recent myocardial infarction, and malignancy with one or more risk factors. These indications involved 257 patients (31. 4 %) and were supported by robust scientific evidence. Deep vein thrombosis was detected in 27 of these patients (10. 5 %). Two consistent <b>negative</b> <b>indications</b> involved 347 patients (42. 4 %). Deep vein thrombosis was detected in 9 of these patients (2. 6 %). Three indications involving 214 patients (26. 2 %) were discordant over the 4 guidelines. CONCLUSION: Classification tree analysis of real patient data is a useful strategy to identify indications common to competing guidelines. These indications should be considered for inclusion when updating guidelines. The findings of recently completed randomized trials have partly resolved the disagreement among the 4 guidelines. This approach may be helpful when developing new guidelines or for identifying topics warranting further complementary clinical trials...|$|R

Although still young, he had earned a {{reputation}} as a competent planetary geologist through years of hard work at the U. S. Geological Survey. He attributed his success in part to an excellent education which stressed the validity of the scientific method. He fully understood the need to proceed cautiously whenever the announcement of a new discovery was contemplated. That was why he was both astonished and dismayed when NASA Senior Scientist David Collins called with the news that the “Life on Mars” investigation would be revealed at an upcoming press conference. As part of the investigative team, Michael felt that such an announcement was premature. He did not want to risk his reputation and career by rushing to make a public disclosure before the work was validated. He tried to imagine the public and professional reactions if the first report of life on another planet was ultimately proven false. The repercussions would be far worse than the simple disappointment many felt when the Viking Lander soil experiments produced <b>negative</b> <b>indications</b> of life 20 years ago. Michael stopped musing and {{turned his attention to the}} meeting. David was trying to explain the situation. “We are here because word has leaked that we have discovered evidence of life on Mars.
