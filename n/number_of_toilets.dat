25|$|The {{construction}} of the Pentagon was done {{during a time when}} parts of the U.S. were under legally-mandated racial segregation. This had structural consequences to the design of the building. Under the supervision of colonel Leslie Groves, the decision to have separate eating and lavatory accommodations for white persons and black persons was made and carried out. The dining areas for black persons were put in the basement and on each floor there were double toilet facilities separated by gender and race. These measures of segregation were said to have been done in compliance with the U.S. Commonwealth of Virginia's racial laws. The Pentagon as a result has twice the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>toilet</b> facilities needed for a building of its size.|$|R

40|$|Purpose: Trospium {{chloride}} is an anticholinergic {{agent with}} predominantly peripheral nonse-lective antimuscarinic activity lacking {{central nervous system}} effects. It has no known drug-drug interactions, an advantage for patients taking many medications. Because these qualities may provide added benefit when treating patients with symptoms associated with overactive bladder (OAB) and urge incontinence, we studied the effectiveness of trospium in treating these condi-tions. Materials and Methods: Patients with OAB with urge incontinence were randomized 1 : 1 to 20 mg trospium twice daily or placebo in this 12 -week, multicenter, parallel, double-blind, placebo controlled trial. Dual primary end points were change in average <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>toilet</b> voids and change in urge incontinent episodes per 24 hours. Secondary efficacy variables were change in average of volume per void, voiding urge severity, urinations during day and night, time to onset of action and change in Incontinence Impact Questionnaire. Results: A total of 523 patients were entered at 51 sites. Trospium significantly decreased average frequency <b>of</b> <b>toilet</b> voids and urge incontinent episodes compared to placebo.

50|$|Until about 1880, four-wheeled {{compartment}} {{coaches were}} typical. After {{the end of}} the wave of nationalisations the Prussian state railways, around 1895, acquired the quieter-running six-wheelers. For this, so-called norms were established for four-, six- and, later, eight-wheeled classes of coach. For the six-wheelers, both fixed axle and sliding axle designs were envisaged. Those coaches designed specifically for suburban traffic (Berlin, Hamburg) had no toilets. On the other coaches, a gangway was specified {{in order to keep the}} <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>toilets</b> to a minimum for economic reasons. Numerous coaches had therefore to be converted. After {{the end of the}} 19th century, fourth class compartment coaches were also procured.|$|E
40|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} a decline in the state <b>of</b> public <b>toilets</b> and, with over 50 % <b>of</b> the public <b>toilets</b> being closed, this has become a cause for public concern. Local {{authorities}} have no legal requirement to provide public <b>toilets</b> and because <b>of</b> this some towns have no public toilet provision. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the adequacy and provision <b>of</b> the public <b>toilets</b> on the Island of Guernsey. This investigation was undertaken through observation of the 30 public toilet blocks and a questionnaire exploring the provision <b>of</b> the public <b>toilets,</b> emailed to a representative sample of the Island population. All 18 <b>of</b> the <b>toilets</b> for those with disabilities, 26 (out of 30) of the male and 27 (out of 30) of the female public toilets were observed and the response rate to the questionnaire was 48 % (n= 264). Results confirmed that there are an adequate <b>number</b> <b>of</b> public <b>toilet</b> facilities for the Island’s population in accordance with the British Standards. Fifty-five per cent of respondents were satisfied or very satisfied with the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> facilities. However concerns were expressed about the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> the public <b>toilet</b> that were closed during the winter months and the proposed closure <b>of</b> <b>toilets</b> in an effort to save money.

50|$|These {{provisions}} {{failed to}} adequately address overcrowding, unsafe structures and fencing and security. There was no clarity {{as to what}} “basic”, “adequate” or “reasonably practicable” meant. The proposed <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>toilets</b> was not specified, nor was it clear whether a battery would suffice as “some form of energy”. There was, moreover, no guarantee of additional, essential provisions such as a computer centre, a functioning laboratory, a library, and clean and accessible water, let alone a clear timeframe for implementation and an established framework of accountability. The fact that Minister Motshekga had published her January draft meant that the struggle was no longer over whether norms and standards were necessary, but over {{the quality of the}} norms themselves. Members of the public were given until 31 March 2013 to comment on the draft, and EE embraced {{this as an opportunity to}} provide the department with the comprehensive response it deserved.|$|E
40|$|Sexual {{violence}} is a major public health issue, affecting 35 % of women worldwide. Major risk factors for sexual assault include inadequate indoor sanitation {{and the need to}} travel to outdoor toilet facilities. We estimated how increasing the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>toilets</b> in an urban township (Khayelitsha, South Africa) might reduce both economic costs and the incidence and social burden of sexual assault. We developed a mathematical model that links risk of sexual assault to the number of sanitation facilities and the time a woman must spend walking to a toilet. We defined a composite societal cost function, comprising both the burden of sexual assault and the costs of installing and maintaining public chemical toilets. By expressing total social costs {{as a function of the}} number of available toilets, we were able to identify an optimal (i. e., cost-minimizing) social investment in toilet facilities. There are currently an estimated 5600 toilets in Khayelitsha. This results in 635 sexual assaults and US$ 40 million in combined social costs each year. Increasing the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>toilets</b> to 11300 would minimize total costs ($ 35 million) and reduce sexual assaults to 446. Higher toilet installation and maintenance costs would be more than offset by lower sexual assault costs. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis shows that the optimal <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>toilets</b> exceeds the original allocation of toilets in the township in over 80 % of the 5000 iterations of the model. Improving access to sanitation facilities in urban settlements will simultaneously reduce the incidence of sexual assaults and overall cost to society. Since our analysis ignores the many additional health benefits of improving sanitation in resource-constrained urban areas (e. g., potential reductions in waterborne infectious diseases), the optimal <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>toilets</b> identified here should be interpreted as conservative...|$|E

40|$|Evaluating {{the health}} impact of urban WASH programmes: an {{affordable}} approach for enhancing effectiveness This paper argues for more widespread {{evaluation of the}} health impacts of WASH interventions: not {{with the aim of}} demonstrating that WASH can improve health (we know it can), but rather with the aim of assessing the impact of particular interventions. We suggest that more frequent evaluation could contribute to improved effectiveness, by encouraging investors and implementers to focus on impacts rather than outputs (such as <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>toilets</b> constructed). More widespread health impact evaluation would also enable more objective comparative assessment of the value-for-money of different types of urban WASH intervention. Further, we argue that health impact evaluation need not be as costly as is widely thought. W...|$|E
40|$|The {{analysis}} {{of the factors that}} determine the price of the second-hand house, by means of the use of the hedonic methodology, constitutes the central objective of this work. This study has been applied to the market of the house corresponding to the municipality of Malaga (Spain), of where a sample of 1996 transactions, made during 2003, has been selected. This information has been facilitated by a real estate agency. The obtained results have allowed to identify those characteristics of the houses that more affect their price and quantify this influence, valuing it in monetary terms. It has been stated that the contribution of some structural attributes (the floor area, the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>toilets,</b> the presence of private garage or the luminosity of the house) and others of location (proximity to the sea or downtown, and location in a certain zone) affects the price of the house decisively. ...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To survey {{sanitation}} {{facilities in}} schools in Bloomsbury health district. DESIGN [...] Postal questionnaire. SETTING [...] Inner London health district.

25|$|The {{total market}} {{worldwide}} for high-tech toilets was about US$800 million in 1997. The largest producer is Toto, with 65% {{of the market}} share, while the second largest is Inax at 25%. The main market for washlets is still in Japan, and TOTO reports that overseas sales account for just 5% of its revenue. The primary foreign market is China, where Toto sells over one million washlets each year. In the US for example, sales are well below Japanese levels, even though sales improved from 600 units per month in 2001 to 1,000 units per month in 2003. In Europe, Toto sells only 5,000 washlets annually. While most Europeans would probably regard Japanese washlets as quite a curiosity, the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> such <b>toilets</b> being installed in Europe is on the rise. This is mainly for the special purpose <b>of</b> <b>toilets</b> for the handicapped. Depending {{on the type of}} disability, handicapped persons may have difficulties reaching the anus region in order to clean themselves after toilet use. Hence, the introduction <b>of</b> <b>toilets</b> with a water jet cleaner and blow dryer allows such persons to clean themselves without assistance.|$|R
