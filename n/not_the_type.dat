5|$|The {{official}} website had over 11,000 {{responses to a}} poll asking listeners whether Ruth should go with Sam, compared to the usual 3,000. Fifty-two per cent of the listeners thought Ruth should go to Sam. The Archers website had received 1.2 million page impressions due to the storyline in 2006. In February 2007, {{a writer for the}} Daily Record reported almost 200,000 listeners had deserted The Archers due to controversial storylines, such as Ruth and Sam's affair. The writer said figures for the last three months of 2006, when the Ruth and Sam storyline peaked, revealed 4.44 million listeners tuned in, which was down 169,000 on the previous quarter. Whitburn told Midgley that the backlash from listeners helped keep Ruth faithful to David, and agreed that she was <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>type</b> to have an affair.|$|E
5|$|Several {{species of}} Diplodocus were {{described}} between 1878 and 1924. The first skeleton {{was found at}} Cañon City, Colorado, by Benjamin Mudge and Samuel Wendell Williston in 1877, and was named Diplodocus longus ('long double-beam'), by paleontologist Othniel Charles Marsh in 1878. Although <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>type</b> species, D. carnegii is the most completely known and most famous species due to {{the large number of}} casts of its skeleton in museums around the world. Diplodocus remains have since been found in the Morrison Formation of the western U.S. States of Colorado, Utah, Montana, and Wyoming. Fossils of this animal are common, except for the skull, which has never been found with otherwise complete skeletons. D. hayi, known from a partial skeleton and skull discovered by William H. Utterback in 1902 near Sheridan, Wyoming, was described in 1924. In 2015, it was renamed as the separate genus Galeamopus, and several other Diplodocus specimens were referred to that genus, leaving no definite Diplodocus skulls known.|$|E
5|$|Beta: Arc Light of the Point of Infinity follows Mayuri, and {{is set in}} {{the beta}} attractor field, after Daru's future daughter, Suzuha Amane, brought Okabe back in time to save Kurisu; this is {{necessary}} to avoid a world line where Kurisu's time travel theories are stolen, resulting in an arms race leading up to World War III. Okabe fails at first, as world line convergence appears to make Kurisu's death inevitable; Suzuha is about to make him try one more time, but Mayuri stops her, as she thinks Okabe has suffered enough. Suzuha does not go back to the time she came from, still intending to get Okabe to try once more, but notes that {{due to a lack of}} fuel, the time machine will no longer be able to go back far enough after less than a year has passed. After that time is nearly up, Suzuha gets ready to travel back in time and try saving Kurisu herself, but Mayuri follows along. They arrive just after the past Suzuha and Okabe left to save Kurisu for the first time, and Mayuri tells her past self that she needs to get Okabe to try again. The scene from the beginning plays out again, but Mayuri slaps Okabe and tells him that he is <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>type</b> to give up. The future Mayuri and Suzuha leave before the past Okabe and Suzuha return, with too little fuel to be able to tell where they will end up.|$|E

25|$|Fungi {{that attack}} aphids include Neozygites fresenii, Entomophthora, Beauveria bassiana, Metarhizium anisopliae, and entomopathogenic fungi such as Lecanicillium lecanii. Aphids brush against the {{microscopic}} spores. These spores {{stick to the}} aphid, germinate, and penetrate the aphid's skin. The fungus grows in the aphid hemolymph (i.e., the counterpart of blood for aphids). After about 3nbsp&days, the aphid dies and the fungus releases more spores into the air. Infected aphids are covered with a woolly mass that progressively grows thicker until the aphid is obscured. Often, the visible fungus is <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>type</b> of fungus that killed the aphid, but a secondary fungus.|$|E

Gigi later calls Gaston up, admitting she would rather be miserable with him than without him and agrees to accompany him in public.

500|$|Prior to its {{theatrical}} release, the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) certified {{the film}} with a UA certificate after demanding a few cuts, {{due to a}} high proportion of violence present in the film.

500|$|Sutcliffe {{displayed}} artistic talent at {{an early}} age. Helen Anderson, a fellow student, remembered his early works as being very aggressive, with dark, moody colours, which was <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>type</b> of painting she expected from such a [...] "quiet student". One of Sutcliffe's paintings was shown at the Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool {{as part of the}} John Moores exhibition, from November 1959 until January 1960. After the exhibition, Moores bought Sutcliffe's canvas for £65 ( [...] , which was then equal to 6–7 weeks' wages for an average working man. The picture Moore bought was called Summer Painting, and Sutcliffe attended a formal dinner to celebrate the exhibition with another art student, Susan Williams. Murray remembered that the painting was painted on a board, not a canvas, and had to be cut into two pieces (because of its size) and hinged. Murray added that only one of the pieces actually got to the exhibition (because they stopped off in a pub to celebrate), but sold nonetheless because Moores bought it for his son.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the first}} {{witnesses}} with no involvement in Operation Flavius to give evidence to the inquest was Allen Feraday, Principal Scientific Officer at the Royal Armaments Research and Development Establishment. He posited that a remote detonator could reach from the scenes of the shootings to the car park in which Savage had left the white Renault and beyond. On cross-examination, he stated that the aerial on the Renault was <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>type</b> he would expect {{to be used for}} receiving a detonation signal, adding that the IRA had not been known to use a remote-detonated bomb without a direct line of sight to their target. The following day, [...] "Soldier G" [...] (who had made the determination that the white Renault [...] contained a bomb) told the coroner that he was not an explosives expert, and that his assessment was based on his belief that the vehicle's aerial looked [...] "too new". Dissatisfied, McGrory called his own expert witness—Dr Michael Scott, an expert in radio-controlled detonation—who disagreed with government witnesses that a bomb at the assembly area could have been detonated from the petrol station where McCann and Farrell were shot, having conducted tests prior to testifying. The government responded by commissioning its own tests, conducted by British Army signallers, which showed that radio communication between the petrol station and the car park was possible, but not guaranteed.|$|E
