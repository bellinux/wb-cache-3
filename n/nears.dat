5|$|SR 88 {{begins at}} a diamond {{interchange}} with US 60, the Superstition Freeway, in southern Apache Junction. The route follows Idaho Road northward through a residential area with four lanes. Following a junction with Old West Highway, SR 88 turns northeast onto Apache Trail and narrows to two lanes. The route exits {{the city limits}} of Apache Junction, entering desert terrain. Passing a ghost town known as Goldfield, Apache Trail enters Tonto National Forest just northwest of Lost Dutchman State Park. SR 88 <b>nears</b> Canyon Lake south of the Mormon Flat Dam and follows {{a part of the}} southern coast of Canyon Lake. Apache Trail heads away from the Salt River. It passes through the town of Tortilla Flat, becoming an unpaved dirt trail winding eastward through the Superstition Mountains. SR 88 again turns northeast and <b>nears</b> Apache Lake. The route follows the Salt River northeast to the Theodore Roosevelt Dam, near which the route is again paved. SR 88 intersects with SR 188 along the coast of Theodore Roosevelt Lake.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} the new concept of {{relative}} <b>near</b> PS-compactness in L-fuzzy topological spaces is introduced. The relative <b>near</b> PS-compactness is described with a-net, r-ps-cover, r-finite intersection property.

It is found that <b>near</b> PS-compactness implies relative <b>near</b> PS-compactness and every LF-set of <b>near</b> PS-compact space is relative <b>near</b> PS-compact. The relative <b>near</b> PS-compactness possess the following properties:the union of two arbirtrary relative <b>near</b> PS-compact sets is relative <b>near</b> PS-compact;the intersection {{of a family}} relative <b>near</b> PS-compact sets is also relative <b>near</b> PS-compact. Finally, it is proved that the relative <b>near</b> PS-compactness is invariant under the PS-continuous maps.

His crazed side is in a paranoid state on the cabin floor, and when Alan touches him, the two are made whole again.
