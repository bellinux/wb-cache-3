The experimental investigation showed that their efficiency was depending on both materials parameters and flow conditions, the latter affecting the pressure drop and the heat transfer behaviour. The microstructural characterisation of oxide surface morphologies formed on the open-cell Ni foams exposed to concentrated solar radiation is investigated by the use of SEM and EDXS.

40|$|Aims: The aim of {{this study}} is to {{determine}} the impact of relative humidity (RH) and contaminant concentration on photocatalytic conversion of gaseous toluene by using TiO 2 coated on <b>nickel</b> <b>foam.</b> Materials and Methods: TiO 2 nanoparticles were prepared by the sol-gel process and coated on <b>nickel</b> <b>foam.</b> Structural and morphological characteristics of nanoparticles were determined using Scanning electron microscope, X-ray diffraction analysis. Photocatalytic conversion of gaseous toluene at the different levels of RH and toluene concentration was measured under ultraviolet-A radiation by gas chromatograph with Flame Ionization Detector. Results: After being fixed the contaminant concentration, 30 % level of RH had the most impact on the photocatalytic efficiency, 10, 0, 5 0 and 80 % levels of humidity had, in turn, the most impact.
