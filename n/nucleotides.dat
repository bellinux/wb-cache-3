5|$|The {{most ancient}} polyadenylating enzyme is polynucleotide phosphorylase. This enzyme {{is part of}} both the {{bacterial}} degradosome and the archaeal exosome, two closely related complexes that recycle RNA into <b>nucleotides.</b> This enzyme degrades RNA by attacking the bond between the 3'-most <b>nucleotides</b> with a phosphate, breaking off a diphosphate nucleotide. This reaction is reversible, and so the enzyme can also extend RNA with more <b>nucleotides.</b> The heteropolymeric tail added by polynucleotide phosphorylase is very rich in adenine. The choice of adenine is most likely the result of higher ADP concentrations than other <b>nucleotides</b> {{as a result of}} using ATP as an energy currency, making it more likely to be incorporated in this tail in early lifeforms. It has been suggested that the involvement of adenine-rich tails in RNA degradation prompted the later evolution of polyadenylate polymerases (the enzymes that produce poly(A) tails with no other <b>nucleotides</b> in them).|$|E

Computer simulations, however, show that this method gives a reasonably accurate estimate even when GC-content deviates from 0. 5, as long as the number of <b>nucleotide</b> changes per site (<b>nucleotide</b> diversity) is small.

They are substrates for glycosyltransferases. The <b>nucleotide</b> sugars are also intermediates in <b>nucleotide</b> sugar interconversions that produce some of the activated sugars needed for glycosylation reactions.

5|$|<b>Nucleotides</b> {{are made}} from amino acids, carbon dioxide and formic acid in {{pathways}} that require large amounts of metabolic energy. Consequently, most organisms have efficient systems to salvage preformed <b>nucleotides.</b> Purines are synthesized as nucleosides (bases attached to ribose). Both adenine and guanine {{are made from}} the precursor nucleoside inosine monophosphate, which is synthesized using atoms from the amino acids glycine, glutamine, and aspartic acid, as well as formate transferred from the coenzyme tetrahydrofolate. Pyrimidines, on the other hand, are synthesized from the base orotate, which is formed from glutamine and aspartate.|$|E

Generally these RNA elements range in length from 60-110 <b>nucleotides</b> and they typically contain a hairpin with a small number of mismatched base pairs which reduce the stability of the structure, thereby allowing easier unfolding in response to a temperature increase.|$|E
5|$|There is {{polyadenylation}} in the cytosol of some {{animal cell}} types, namely in the germ line, during early embryogenesis and in post-synaptic sites of nerve cells. This lengthens the poly(A) tail of an mRNA with a shortened poly(A) tail, {{so that the}} mRNA will be translated. These shortened poly(A) tails are often less than 20 <b>nucleotides,</b> and are lengthened to around 80–150 <b>nucleotides.</b>|$|E

5|$|Another {{example of}} the {{structural}} similarity of some inhibitors to the substrates of the enzymes they target {{is seen in the}} figure comparing the drug methotrexate to folic acid. Folic acid is a substrate of dihydrofolate reductase, an enzyme involved in making <b>nucleotides</b> that is potently inhibited by methotrexate. Methotrexate blocks the action of dihydrofolate reductase and thereby halts the production of <b>nucleotides.</b> This block of nucleotide biosynthesis is more toxic to rapidly growing cells than non-dividing cells, since a rapidly growing cell has to carry out DNA replication, therefore methotrexate is often used in cancer chemotherapy.|$|E
5|$|Messenger RNA (mRNA) carries {{information}} about a protein sequence to the ribosomes, the protein synthesis factories in the cell. It is coded so that every three <b>nucleotides</b> (a codon) corresponds to one amino acid. In eukaryotic cells, once precursor mRNA (pre-mRNA) has been transcribed from DNA, it is processed to mature mRNA. This removes its introns—non-coding sections of the pre-mRNA. The mRNA is then exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, where it is bound to ribosomes and translated into its corresponding protein form {{with the help of}} tRNA. In prokaryotic cells, which do not have nucleus and cytoplasm compartments, mRNA can bind to ribosomes while it is being transcribed from DNA. After {{a certain amount of time}} the message degrades into its component <b>nucleotides</b> with the assistance of ribonucleases.|$|E

5|$|RNAs are a type {{of large}} {{biological}} molecules, whose individual building blocks are called <b>nucleotides.</b> The name poly(A) tail (for polyadenylic acid tail) reflects the way RNA <b>nucleotides</b> are abbreviated, with a letter for the base the nucleotide contains (A for adenine, C for cytosine, G for guanine and U for uracil). RNAs are produced (transcribed) from a DNA template. By convention, RNA sequences are written in a 5' to 3' direction. The 5' end {{is the part of}} the RNA molecule that is transcribed first, and the 3' end is transcribed last. The 3' end is also where the poly(A) tail is found on polyadenylated RNAs.|$|E

40|$|DNA {{sequencing}} by synthesis (SBS) {{offers an}} approach for potential high-throughput sequencing applications. In this method, {{the ability of}} an incoming <b>nucleotide</b> {{to act as a}} reversible terminator for a DNA polymerase reaction is an important requirement to unambiguously determine the identity of the incorporated <b>nucleotide</b> before the next <b>nucleotide</b> is added. A free 3 ′-OH group on the terminal <b>nucleotide</b> of the primer is necessary for the DNA polymerase to incorporate an incoming <b>nucleotide.</b> Therefore, if the 3 ′-OH group of an incoming <b>nucleotide</b> is capped by a chemical moiety, it will cause the polymerase reaction to terminate after the <b>nucleotide</b> is incorporated into the DNA strand. If the capping group is subsequently removed to generate a free 3 ′-OH, the polymerase reaction will reinitialize. We report here the design and synthesis of a 3 ′-modified photocleavable fluorescent <b>nucleotide,</b> 3 ′-O-allyl-dUTP-PC-Bodipy-FL- 510 (PC-Bodipy, photocleavable 4, 4 -difluoro- 4 -bora- 3 α, 4 α-diaza-s-indacene), as a reversible terminator for SBS. This <b>nucleotide</b> analogue contains an allyl moiety capping the 3 ′-OH group and a fluorophore Bodipy-FL- 510 linked to the 5 position of the uracil through a photocleavable 2 -nitrobenzyl linker. Here, we have shown that this <b>nucleotide</b> is a good substrate for a DNA polymerase. After the <b>nucleotide</b> was successfully incorporated into a growing DNA strand and the fluorophore was photocleaved, the allyl group was removed by using a Pd-catalyzed reaction to reinitiate the polymerase reaction, thereby establishing the feasibility of using such <b>nucleotide</b> analogues as reversible terminators for SBS...|$|R

5|$|The two nucleic acids, DNA and RNA, are {{polymers}} of <b>nucleotides.</b> Each nucleotide {{is composed}} of a phosphate attached to a ribose or deoxyribose sugar group which {{is attached to a}} nitrogenous base. Nucleic acids are critical for the storage and use of genetic information, and its interpretation through the processes of transcription and protein biosynthesis. This information is protected by DNA repair mechanisms and propagated through DNA replication. Many viruses have an RNA genome, such as HIV, which uses reverse transcription to create a DNA template from its viral RNA genome. RNA in ribozymes such as spliceosomes and ribosomes is similar to enzymes as it can catalyze chemical reactions. Individual nucleosides are made by attaching a nucleobase to a ribose sugar. These bases are heterocyclic rings containing nitrogen, classified as purines or pyrimidines. <b>Nucleotides</b> also act as coenzymes in metabolic-group-transfer reactions.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{double-stranded}} DNA, RNA is a single-stranded molecule {{in many of}} its biological {{roles and}} has a much shorter chain of <b>nucleotides.</b> However, RNA can, by complementary base pairing, form intrastrand (i.e., single-strand) double helixes, as in tRNA.|$|E
5|$|A gene is a {{sequence}} of DNA that contains genetic information and can influence the phenotype of an organism. Within a gene, the sequence of bases along a DNA strand defines a messenger RNA sequence, which then defines one or more protein sequences.

The genetic code consists of three-letter 'words' called codons formed from {{a sequence}} of three <b>nucleotides</b> (e.g. ACT, CAG, TTT).|$|E
50|$|In genetics, a {{transition}} {{is a point}} mutation that changes a purine <b>nucleotide</b> to another purine (A ↔ G) or a pyrimidine <b>nucleotide</b> to another pyrimidine (C ↔ T). Approximately {{two out of three}} single <b>nucleotide</b> polymorphisms (SNPs) are transitions.|$|R

5|$|Anabolism is {{the set of}} {{constructive}} metabolic processes {{where the}} energy released by catabolism is used to synthesize complex molecules. In general, the complex molecules that make up cellular structures are constructed step-by-step from small and simple precursors. Anabolism involves three basic stages. First, the production of precursors such as amino acids, monosaccharides, isoprenoids and <b>nucleotides,</b> secondly, their activation into reactive forms using energy from ATP, and thirdly, the assembly of these precursors into complex molecules such as proteins, polysaccharides, lipids and nucleic acids.|$|E
5|$|As {{well as the}} {{evolution}} of new metabolic pathways, evolution can also cause the loss of metabolic functions.

Similar reduced metabolic capabilities are seen in endosymbiotic organisms.|$|E
5|$|DNA {{is a long}} polymer {{made from}} repeating units called <b>nucleotides.</b> The {{structure}} of DNA is dynamic along its length, being capable of coiling into tight loops, and other shapes. In all species it is composed of two helical chains, bound to each other by hydrogen bonds. Both chains are coiled round the same axis, and have the same pitch of 34ångströms (3.4nanometres). The pair of chains has a radius of 10ångströms (1.0nanometre). According to another study, when measured in a different solution, the DNA chain measured 22 to 26ångströms wide (2.2 to 2.6nanometres), and one nucleotide unit measured 3.3Å (0.33nm) long. Although each individual nucleotide repeating unit is very small, DNA polymers can be very large molecules containing millions to {{hundreds of millions of}} <b>nucleotides.</b> For instance, the DNA in the largest human chromosome, chromosome number 1, consists of approximately 220 million base pairs and would be 85mm long if straightened.|$|E

40|$|<b>Nucleotide</b> {{excision}} repair {{is a major}} mechanism of defense against the carcinogenic effects of ultraviolet light. Ultraviolet B causes sunburn and DNA damage in human skin. <b>Nucleotide</b> {{excision repair}} has been studied extensively and described in detail at the molecular level, including identification of many <b>nucleotide</b> excision repair-specific proteins and the genes encoding <b>nucleotide</b> excision repair proteins. In this study, normal human keratinocytes were exposed to increasing doses of ultraviolet B from fluorescent sunlamps, {{and the effect of}} this exposure on expression of <b>nucleotide</b> excision repair genes was examined. An RNase protection assay was performed to quantify transcripts from <b>nucleotide</b> excision repair genes, and a slot blot DNA repair activity assay was used to assess induction of the <b>nucleotide</b> excision repair pathway.

All <b>nucleotide</b> excision repair genes examined demonstrated a similar trend: ultraviolet B induces expression of <b>nucleotide</b> excision repair genes at low doses, but downregulates expression at higher doses. In addition, we show that pre-exposure of cells to low-dose ultraviolet protected keratinocytes from apoptosis following high-dose exposure. These data support the notion that <b>nucleotide</b> excision repair is induced in cells exposed to low doses of ultraviolet B, which may protect damaged keratinocytes from cell death; however, exposure to high doses of ultraviolet B downregulates <b>nucleotide</b> excision repair genes and is associated with cell death...|$|R
