40|$|Abstract Grain {{boundary}} {{weaknesses of}} nickel-based superalloys not only materialize during {{service in the}} hot turbine engine sections but also during the weld manufacturing. The performance, in this respect, {{of the most commonly}} used alloys at Volvo Aero Corporation (VAC), 718 and the higher temperature capacity Waspaloy, are therefore the main subjects for this thesis. The emerging Allvac 718 ® PLUSTM (718 Plus) is also included due to the prospect of replacing the expensive Waspaloy. The overall emphasis is on weldability through Varestraint testing but limited work was initially carried out on <b>notch</b> <b>rupture</b> sensitivity of 718 Plus. The <b>notch</b> <b>rupture</b> testing of 718 Plus emphasized the importance of the secondary phases like delta-phase in the grain boundaries. Hot cracks were observed in all alloys with re-solidified products on the liquated and re-solidified grain boundaries. Grain boundary liquation and segregation of alloying elements was considered to be the primary reason for liquation of HAZ grain boundaries which caused cracking. Evidence of constitutional liquation of Nb rich MC type carbides in alloy 718 and 718 Plus were found in the region adjacent to the fusion zone and also on the cracked grain boundaries. The resolidified products along the hot cracks consisted of γ + MC type carbide and γ + Laves eutectics...|$|E
40|$|Fiber Laser Deposition of Aerospace Superalloys Precipitation-hardenable {{nickel-iron}} base superalloys, such as Inconel 718, {{are widely}} used for aerospace and nuclear components due to their excellent combination of corrosion resistance, oxidation resistance, tensile and creep properties, as well as good weldability due to microstructure stability and resistance to strain-age cracking at elevated temperatures up to 650 C. In this work, a continuous wave 5 kW fibre laser welding system was used to weld deposit a Ni-base superalloy using filler wire and powder feed sources with compositions that matched the parent metal. The single-bead, multi-bead, and multi-layer weld deposits were characterized {{in terms of the}} macrostructure, defects, microstructure and mechanical properties. Particularly, for the mechanical properties, three material conditions, namely as-serviced Parent Metal (PM), Direct Laser Deposits (DLD) and PM-DLD were evaluated by hardness, tensile (room and elevated temperature), creep, smooth and <b>notch</b> <b>rupture</b> tension, and fatigue testing. The mechanical properties obtained were then compared to existing aerospace materials specifications. By using optimized laser processing parameters, high quality deposits (minor porosity and limited weld metal liquation cracks) with good mechanical properties are realizable. The successful development of the direct laser deposition process using wire and powder feeding indicates the marked potential of employing the fiber laser technology to repair and manufacture aerospace superalloy components.

40|$|A {{study was}} {{performed}} to determine and model the effect of high temperature dwells on notched low cycle fatigue (NLCF) and <b>notch</b> stress <b>rupture</b> behavior of a fine grain LSHR powder metallurgy (PM) nickel-based superalloy. It was shown that a 90 second dwell applied at the minimum stress (min dwell) was considerably more detrimental to the NLCF lives than similar dwell applied at the maximum stress (max dwell). The short min dwell NLCF lives were shown {{to be caused by}} growth of small oxide blisters which caused preferential cracking when coupled with high concentrated notch root stresses. The cyclic max dwell notch tests failed mostly by a creep accumulation, not by fatigue, with the crack origin shifting internally to a substantial distance away from the notch root. The classical von Mises plastic flow model was unable to match the experimental results while the hydrostatic stress profile generated using the Drucker-Prager plasticity flow model was consistent with the experimental findings. The max dwell NLCF and <b>notch</b> stress <b>rupture</b> tests exhibited substantial creep notch strengthening. The triaxial Bridgman effective stress parameter was able to account for the notch strengthening by collapsing the notched and uniform gage geometry test data into a singular grouping...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis {{study is}} {{concerned}} with the creep damage evaluation for fine grained heat affected zone (HAZ) of Mod. 9 Cr-lMo steel. Circumferentially <b>notched</b> bar creep <b>rupture</b> tests have been conducted in order to examine the effect of multiaxial stress state on creep rupture and creep damage of the fined grained HAZ. The simulated fine grained HAZ has been used. Finite element predictions based on a continuum damage mechanics model with ductility exhaustion approach has been used to predict the creep rupture and the creep damage in the notched specimens. It is found that a ductility exhaustion approach provides very large creep damage which leads to too conservative prediction of creep life for notched specimens. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The creep {{deformation}} and rupture {{behavior of the}} AH heat treated and HT heat treated IN-X 750 was investigated at 700 *C. Creep rupture tests were performed on smooth bars, circular and British standard notched specimens which were monitored with the dc potential drop technique. The potential drop technique {{was used to measure}} creep strain in the three geometries, detect crack initiation and measure crack propagation rates in British standard <b>notched</b> specimens. Creep <b>rupture</b> in the AH IN-X 750 was found to be controlled by {{creep deformation}}. The idealized form of the Monkman-Grant relationship was satisfied in all three specimen geometries. The equivalent stress was shown to correlate the rupture life of the smooth and the circular notched specimens and the crack intiation time of the British standard notched specimens. The strain/time relationships for the three specimen geometries were analysed with the Continuum Damage Mechanics Theor...|$|R
40|$|Two {{fracture}} {{criteria are}} proposed {{and applied to}} blunt-notched components made of brittle materials loaded under mixed mode; the former {{is based on the}} averaged strain energy density over a given control volume, the latter on the cohesive crack zone model. In both instances use of the equivalent local mode I hypothesis is made. Only two material properties are needed: the ultimate tensile strength and the fracture toughness. Numerical predictions of rupture loads from the two criteria are compared with experimental measurements from more than 160 static tests with notched beams. The samples are made of PMMA and tested at - 60 degrees C to assure a bulk behaviour almost linear elastic up to <b>rupture.</b> <b>Notch</b> root radii range from 0. 2 to 4. 0 mm and load mixicity varies from pure mode I to a prevailing mode II. The good agreement between theory and experimental results adds further confidence to the proposed fracture criteria...|$|R

Purpose: Purpose {{of this study is}} description and comparasion gender and oldage differences of morphometric factors of intercondylar <b>notch</b> important for <b>rupture</b> LCA. Method: The measurements were taken on 50 cadaverous knees (32 male and 18 female) with intact anterior cruciate ligament, aged from 15 to 53 years. We measured intercondilar height and epicondylar width, intercondylar width, width of lateral and medial condyle in level of popliteal sulcus and on the widest place of the distal part of femur. We calculated notch width (NWI) and notch shape (NSI) indices from absolute measurements. Results: Notch width and epicondylar width have larger values (p< 0. 01) on the male (22. 3 i 79. 6 mm) than the female (18. 2 i 68. 7 mm). There is no statistical significant differences (p< 0. 05) about notch width and notch shape indices between male (NWI: 0. 28; NSI: 0. 77) and female (NWI: 0. 27; NSI: 0. 68).

40|$|AbstractAn {{analysis}} is conducted to predict stress relief cracking at 550 °C in notched compact tension specimens of Type 316 H austenitic stainless steel. The specimens had {{been subjected to}} pre-compression to generate a tensile residual stress distribution at the notch tip. This stress distribution is represented by a uniform reference stress over the zone of tension ahead of the <b>notch</b> tip. Creep <b>rupture</b> and creep crack growth data alone are required and {{used to make the}} predictions. It is found that the shape of the crack growth curve is correctly predicted when mean data are employed. However, upper bound crack growth properties are required to accurately predict the actual extent of cracking. Sensitivity studies show that the amount of stress relief cracking predicted is relatively insensitive to the reference stress initially assumed to describe the residual stress distribution, since the reference stress relaxes to a magnitude that is almost independent of its initial value. Adoption of an initial reference stress equal to the ultimate tensile strength of the steel, when combined with mean creep rupture and upper bound crack growth properties, results in safe predictions that are not overly conservative. The analysis should only be regarded as reliable for small amounts of crack extension of less than the size of the tensile zone ahead of the crack tip...|$|R
40|$|This {{report is}} {{a section of}} the final report on the GRCop- 84 task of the Constellation Program and {{incorporates}} the results obtained between October 2000 and September 2005 when the program ended. GRCop- 84 contains approximately 5. 5 wt% Nb. Nb can react with H and embrittle easily. Previous work had indicated the thermodynamic possibility that Cr 2 Nb could react with H and form niobium hydrides in the presence of high pressure H such as seen in the Space Shuttle Main Engine. In this study, samples were charged with H and then tested in both high pressure H and He environments to determine if measurable differences existed which indicate that hydrogen embrittlement occurs in GRCop- 84. Tensile, <b>notched</b> tensile, stress <b>rupture</b> and low cycle fatigue properties were surveyed. High pressure H environment stress rupture testing resulted in a lower reduction in area than a high pressure He environment, and the LCF lives at high strain ranges fall below the lower 95 percent confidence interval for the baseline data, but in general no significant differences were noted either between H and He environment tests or between hydrogen charged materials and the baseline, uncharged extruded GRCop- 84 data sets. There was also no discernable evidence of the formation of hydrides or changes in fracture morphology indicating hydrogen embrittlement occurred...|$|R
40|$|Techniques for the {{preparation}} of dual alloy disks were developed and evaluated. Four material combinations were evaluated {{in the form of}} HIP consolidated and heat treated cylindrical and plate shapes in terms of elevated temperature tensile, stress rupture and low cycle fatigue properties. The process evaluation indicated that the pe-HIP AF- 115 rim/loose powder Rene 95 hub combination offered the best overall range of mechanical properties for dual disk applications. The feasibility of this dual alloy concept for the production of more complex components was demonstrated by the scale up fabrication of a prototype CFM- 56 disk made from this AF- 115 /Rene 95 combination. The hub alloy ultimate tensile strength was approximately 92 percent of the program goal of 1520 MPa (220 ksi) at 480 C (900 F) and the rim alloy stress rupture goal of 300 hours at 675 C (1250 F) / 925 MPa (134 ksi) was exceeded by 200 hours. The low cycle fatigue properties were equivalent to those exhibited by HIP and heat treated alloys. There was an absence of <b>rupture</b> <b>notch</b> sensitivity in both alloys. The joint tensile properties were approximately 85 percent of the weaker of the two materials (Rene 95) and the stress rupture properties were equivalent to those of the weaker of the two materials (Rene 95) ...|$|R
