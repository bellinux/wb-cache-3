5|$|A {{persistent}} thyroglossal duct is {{the most}} common clinically significant congenital disorder of the thyroid gland. A persistent sinus tract may remain as a vestigial remnant of the tubular development of the thyroid gland. Parts of this tube may be obliterated, leaving small segments to form thyroglossal cysts. Preterm neonates are at risk of hypothyroidism as their thyroid glands are insufficiently developed to meet their postnatal <b>needs.</b> <b>In</b> order to detect hypothyroidism in newborn babies, to prevent growth and development abnormalities in later life, many countries have newborn screening programs at birth.|$|E

5|$|Other divinities also employ {{surrogate}}s to {{meet their}} own <b>needs.</b> <b>In</b> the Puranas, Sati commits suicide by immolating herself when Shiva is insulted and is reborn as Parvati and becomes Shiva's consort again.

In the Mahabharata, the goddess Svaha assumes the form of six of the wives of the Saptarishi (seven great sages), with whom Agni is in love with, and has coitus with him. Later, Svaha marries Agni.|$|E

5|$|This scheme {{can be seen}} as a {{mechanism}} for representation. First, MPs are chosen by the electorate to represent their concerns and <b>needs</b> <b>in</b> Parliament.

The structure of the executive is therefore based on the concept of political representation.|$|E
5|$|By October 1963, {{according}} to Woods, {{the situation had}} become critical and some officials were beginning to examine alternative options, such as conventional fighter aircraft {{in the form of}} the McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II.

In late 1963, dissatisfied with the progress of the 'bi-service' model, the government examined three alternative options for the programme; to proceed with an RAF-orientated P.1154 while the Naval version would be delayed, pursue the development of a full dual-service P.1154 model with only limited differences between the services, or the complete termination of the program with the service's requirements to be re-appraised.|$|E

5|$|Hospice {{care in the}} United States is a {{type and}} {{philosophy}} of end-of-life care which focuses on the palliation of a terminally ill patient's symptoms. These symptoms can be physical, emotional, spiritual or social in nature. The concept of hospice {{as a place to}} treat the incurably ill has been evolving since the 11th century. Hospice care was introduced to the United States in the 1970s in response to the work of Cicely Saunders in the United Kingdom. This part of health care has expanded as people face a variety of issues with terminal illness. In the United States, it is distinguished by extensive use of volunteers and a greater emphasis on the patient's psychological <b>needs</b> <b>in</b> coming to terms with dying.|$|E

5|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath, officials enacted a curfew for Belize City, Caye Caulker and San Pedro to curtail looting, {{and the latter}} two areas were declared disaster areas. The entirety of the northern three districts (out of six total) were also declared disaster areas. There were initial difficulties in determining the <b>needs</b> <b>in</b> the affected residents, due to cut communications. The government sent planes with emergency supplies to the most affected offshore islands. Several emergency teams were sent to Caye Caulker and San Pedro as soon as weather conditions permitted it. Widespread road repairs also began almost immediately after Keith's occurrence. The Belize International Airport was back online by the morning of October 4, only a single day after the tropical cyclone passed through the area. By that time, boat service was re-instated with the most affected areas to pick up stranded tourists. Workers quickly restored power and water in Belize City. In {{the days after the}} storm struck, residual flooding sparked fears for the spread of disease. In Orange Walk and Cayo District, residents were advised to stay indoors to avoid bites from poisonous snakes.|$|E
