Nitrogenase, a bacterial enzyme, catalyzes the reduction of atmospheric dinitrogen to ammonium. In rhizobia-leguminous plant symbioses, the current model of nitrogen transfer from the symbiotic form of the bacteria, called a bacteroid, to the plant is that nitrogenase-generated ammonia diffuses across the bacteroid membrane and is assimilated into amino acids outside of the bacteroid. We purified soybean nodule bacteroids by a procedure that removed contaminating plant proteins and found that alanine was the major <b>nitrogen-containing</b> <b>compound</b> excreted. Bacteroids incubated in the presence of 15 N 2 excreted alanine highly enriched in 15 N. The ammonium in these assays neither accumulated significantly nor was enriched in 15 N.

However, the degradation products of aflatoxins under UV irradiation and their safety or toxicity have not been clear in practical production such as edible oil industry. In this study, the degradation products of aflatoxin B 1 (AFB 1) in peanut oil were analyzed by Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatograph-Thermo Quadrupole Exactive Focus mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry (UPLC-TQEF-MS/MS). The high-resolution mass spectra reflected that two main products were formed after the modification of a double bond in the terminal furan ring and the fracture of the lactone ring, while the small molecules especially <b>nitrogen-containing</b> <b>compound</b> may have participated in the photochemical reaction.

Purpose: To evaluate the safety of 12 -months creatine supplementation and resistance exercise in older adults by monitoring measures of kidney and liver function, complete blood count, and reports of adverse events. Methods: Older adults (n= 70, males 50 {{years of age or}} older (39), and post-menopausal females (31) who were not performing resistance exercise were recruited for the study and randomized by computer to creatine (32; 18 males, 14 females) or placebo (38; 21 males, 17 females) groups. Other exclusionary criteria were: presence/history or kidney impairments, consumption of creatine supplement/bone altering drugs, and the presence of fragility fractures. Participants were given creatine or placebo (0. 1 g/kg/day) consumed before and after resistance training on exercise days and with a meal on non-exercise days. The study used a double-blind, placebo-controlled design.

The dipeptide is not only found in skeletal muscle, but also in other excitable tissues. Most animals, except humans, also possess a methylated variant of carnosine, either anserine or ophidine/balenine, collectively called the histidine-containing dipeptides. This review aims to decipher the physiological roles of carnosine, based on its biochemical properties. The latter include pH-buffering, metal-ion chelation, and antioxidant capacity {{as well as the}} capacity to protect against formation of advanced glycation and lipoxidation end-products. For these reasons, the therapeutic potential of carnosine supplementation has been tested in numerous diseases in which ischemic or oxidative stress are involved. For several pathologies, such as diabetes and its complications, ocular disease, aging, and neurological disorders, promising preclinical and clinical results have been obtained. Also the pathophysiological relevance of serum carnosinase, the enzyme actively degrading carnosine into l-histidine and β-alanine, is discussed. The carnosine system has evolved as a pluripotent solution to a number of homeostatic challenges. l-Histidine, and more specifically its imidazole moiety, appears to be the prime bioactive component, whereas β-alanine is mainly regulating the synthesis of the dipeptide. This paper summarizes a century of scientific exploration on the (patho) physiological role of carnosine and related compounds.

40|$|AbstractIn this work, {{electrospray}} ionization Fourier transform ion {{cyclotron resonance}} mass spectrometry (ESI(±) -FT-ICR MS) was applied in the chemical characterization of polar compounds. These compounds were identified as the oxygen-containing compound classes (naphthenic acids, O 2 class, and phenols, O 1 class), the sulfur-containing compound classes (mainly sulfides, S 1 class), and the basic and non-basic <b>nitrogen-containing</b> <b>compound</b> classes (carbazoles and pyridines, N class). For access the sulfur-containing compounds were employed the methylation reactions. As the increasing of distillation cut temperature, the amount of O 2 compounds increased (from 9 for cut 2 to 66 for cut 12), and the average molecular weight distribution, Mw, shifted to higher m/z values (Mw= 169 → 321 Da). These results {{were consistent with the}} increase of TAN with the boiling point. Plots of the DBE versus the carbon number for the O 2 class of heavy distillation cuts (cuts 4 – 12) suggested a maximum abundance of the carbon numbers located at C 12 –C 18 with a constant DBE of 3. For the nitrogen-containing compounds, 100 compounds were detected with m/z ranging from 160 to 414. Similar to O 2 class, the amount of nitrogen species increased, and the Mw shifted for high values in function of distillation cut temperature: 6 species and Mw= 206 Da for cut 3; and 64 species and Mw= 340 Da for cut 12. The structures and the connectivity of naphthenic acids, phenols and pyridines were confirmed using ESI(±) -MS/MS. The most abundant sulfur compounds in heavy distillation cuts presented a carbon number of C 23 (for cut 11) and C 25 (for cut 12) with constant DBE of 3.

More than 50 000 children have been hospitalized and six have died because of kidney damage. 5 Melamine is a <b>nitrogen-containing</b> <b>compound</b> commonly used in chemical industry. Because its addition to milk ele-vates apparent protein content, raw milk was intentionally adulterated with melamine in the production-chain, leading to contamination of dairy products and high-level exposure of thousands of children. 6 Melamine is known to cause formation of calculi in weanling rats and has led to acute renal failure in cats and dogs consuming melamine-contaminated pet foods. 7, 8 In humans, melamine-related disease has been recognized only recently, and the full adverse effects of exposure remain unknown. 4, 9 A clinicopatho-logic study suggests that the size of urinary stones is related to melamine concentration. 9 A recent hospital-based study in Bei-jing reported the prevalence of nephrolithiasis was 8. 5 % among children who were exposed and referred by other hospitals. 10 However, no studies have reported on the population-based prevalence of kidney disease among exposed children, nor have follow-up reports been released about affected chil-dren.

A proposed proton scavenging mechanism, where a weak base molecule extracts a proton from the coordination sphere of the hydrated iron (III) complex in the gelation process to form iron (III) oxide/hydroxide, FeIIIxOyHz, has been confirmed for the weak base propylene oxide (PO), a 1, 2 epoxide, {{as well as for the}} weak bases tetrahydrofuran (THF), a 1, 4 epoxide, and pyridine, a heterocyclic <b>nitrogen-containing</b> <b>compound.</b> THF follows a similar mechanism as PO; the epoxide extracts a proton from the coordination sphere of the hydrated iron complex forming a protonated epoxide which then undergoes irreversible ring-opening after reaction with a nucleophile in solution. Pyridine also extracts a proton from the hydrated metal complex, however, the stable six-membered molecule has low associated ring strain and does not endure ring-opening. Fe 2 O 3 /Al energetic systems were synthesized from the epoxides PO, trimethylene oxide (TMO) and 3, 3 dimethyl oxetane (DMO). Surface area analysis of the synthesized matrices shows a direct correlation between the surface area of the iron (III) oxide matrix and the quantified exothermic heat of reaction of the nano-scaled aluminum-containing energetic material due to the magnitude of the interfacial surface area contact between the iron (III) oxide matrix and the aluminum particles. The Fe 2 O 3 (PO) /Al systems possess the highest heat of reaction values due to the oxide interfacial surface area available for contact with the aluminum particles. Also, reactions containing nano-scale aluminum react differently than those containing micron-scale aluminum. RuO 2 /Al energetic systems behave differently dependent on the atmosphere the sample is heated. Heating the RuO 2 /Al samples in an inert atmosphere results in the complete reduction of the ruthenium oxide matrix to Ru(0) before reaction with the aluminum particles, resulting in the exothermic formation of RuxAly intermetallics, with the stoichiometry dependent on the initial Ru:Al concentration. However, heating the samples in an oxygen-rich atmosphere results in an exothermic reaction between RuO 2 and Al. Ph. D.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the application of}} enaminones towards the construction of azabicyclic systems. After a brief survey of indolizidine alkaloids bearing aromatic substituents {{an overview of the}} general strategies developed in laboratories at this University for the synthesis of alkaloids is given in Chapter 1. More specifically, the use of the Eschenmoser sulfide contraction for the construction of vinylogous amides is central to the work presented in this thesis. Syntheses of nitrile containing indolizidine systems are described in chapter 2. Preliminary reactions towards this goal included the preparation of the vinylogous amide 3 - 2 -[(E) - 2 -oxo- 2 -phenylethylidene]- 1 -pyrrolidinylpropanenitrile [157] by application of Eschenmoser’s sulfide contraction reaction to the appropriate thiolactam 3 -(2 -thioxo- 1 -pyrrolidinyl) propanenitrile [168 A]. In addition, the vinylogous amide was reduced to afford the key amino-ketone 3 -[2 -(2 -oxo- 2 -phenylethyl) - 1 -pyrrolidinyl]propanenitrile [160]. Cyclization of this intermediate afforded the vinylogous amides rel-(7 R, 8 aS) - 7 -phenyl- 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 8 a-hexahydro- 6 -indolizinecarbonitrile [179 A] and rel-(7 R, 8 aR) - 7 - phenyl- 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 8 a-hexahydro- 6 -indolizinecarbonitrile [179 B] under specific reaction conditions. By altering the reaction conditions, an additional three products were isolated and characterized; a result that allowed for a step-bystep elucidation of the reaction mechanism for conversion of the aminoketone 3 - 2 -[(E) - 2 -oxo- 2 -phenylethylidene]- 1 -pyrrolidinylpropanenitrile [157] into the vinylogous amides rel-(7 R, 8 aS) - 7 -phenyl- 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 8 a-hexahydro- 6 - indolizinecarbonitrile [179 A] and rel-(7 R, 8 aR) - 7 -phenyl- 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 8 a-hexahydro- 6 -indolizinecarbonitrile [179 B]. In addition, approaches to sulfonecontaining indolizidine systems were explored. Approaches to the syntheses of the pyrrolidine 2 -[1 -(2 -oxo- 2 -phenylethyl) - 2 - pyrrolidinyl]- 1 -phenyl- 1 -ethanone [172 A], a key precursor for the construction Chapter 3. In trying to achieve this strategy, we found that synthesis of the intermediate pyrrolidine 2 -[1 -(2 -oxo- 2 -phenylethyl) - 2 -pyrrolidinyl]- 1 -phenyl- 1 - ethanone [172 A] proved to be non-trivial. Therefore the timing of reaction sequences and assembly of the N-alkyl chain was a necessary part of the strategy. A serendipitous discovery during this part of the research was the facile acid-induced cyclization of the vinylogous amides with an N-phenacyl group which lead to the formation of the pyrrolizine system. Therefore, Chapter 4 describes some of the approaches that were attempted in constructing this class of <b>nitrogen-containing</b> <b>compound.</b> More specifically, we explored the ambident nucleophilicity and electrophilicity of vinylogous amides towards the construction of the pyrrolizine system.

The effect of ammonia in syngas on the Fischer-Tropsch {{synthesis}} (FTS) reaction over 100 Fe/ 5. 1 Si/ 2. 0 Cu/ 3. 0 K catalyst was studied at 220 - 270 degrees C and 1. 3 MPa using a 1 -L slurry phase reactor. The ammonia added in syngas originated from adding ammonia gas, ammonium hydroxide solution, or ammonium nitrate (AN) solution. A wide range of ammonia concentrations (i. e., 0. 1 - 400 ppm) was examined for several hundred hours. The Fe catalysts withdrawn at different times (i. e., after activation by carburization in CO, before and after co-feeding contaminants, {{and at the end}} of run) were characterized by ICP-OES, XRD, Mossbauer spectroscopy, and synchrotron methods (e. g., XANES, EXAFS) in order to explore possible changes in the chemical structure and phases of the Fe catalyst with time; in this way, the deactivation mechanism of the Fe catalyst by poisoning could be assessed. Adding up to 200 ppmw (wt. NH 3 /av. Wt. feed) ammonia in syngas did not significantly deactivate the Fe catalyst or alter selectivities toward CH 4, C 5 +, CO 2, C- 4 -olefin, and 1 -C- 4 olefin, but increasing the ammonia level (in the AN form) to 400 ppm rapidly deactivated the Fe catalyst and simultaneously changed the product selectivities. The results of ICP-OES, XRD, and Mossbauer spectroscopy did not display any evidence for the retention of a <b>nitrogen-containing</b> <b>compound</b> on the used catalyst that could explain the deactivation (e. g., adsorption, site blocking). Instead, Mossbauer spectroscopy results revealed that a significant fraction of iron carbides transformed into iron magnetite during co-feeding high concentrations of AN, suggesting that oxidation of iron carbides occurred and served as a major deactivation path in that case. Oxidation of chi-Fe 5 C 2 to magnetite during co-feeding high concentrations of AN was further confirmed by XRD analysis and by the application of synchrotron methods (e. g., XANES, EXAFS). It is postulated that AN oxidized chi-Fe 5 C 2 during FTS via its thermal dissociation product, HNO 3. This conclusion is further supported by reaction tests with co-feeding of similar concentrations of HNO 3. Additional oxidation routes of iron carbide to magnetite by HNO 3 and/or by its thermal decomposition products are also considered: Fe 5 C 2 + NOx (and/or HNO 3) -> Fe 3 O 4. In this study, ion chromatography detected that 50 - 80 % HNO 3 directly added or dissociated from AN eventually converted to ammonia during or after its oxidation of iron carbide, resulting from the reduction of NOx (NOx + H- 2 + CO -> NH 3 + CO 2 + N- 2 + H 2 O) by H- 2 and/or CO.

40|$|This {{work has}} focused on {{exploring}} the synthesis and characterization of new alkali oxides and oxynitrides of molybdenum and tungsten. In particular, the synthetic approach via the azide/nitrate route, which was developed recently, should be evaluated and extended to the oxides of the heavy group VI elements. For characterization, the crystal structures have been determined by using X-ray diffraction data by means of single crystal or powder methods, and TGA/DTA, DSC and specific heat measurements, IR/Raman spectroscopy, and measurements of the magnetic and conducting behavior were performed. In general, the following results can be depicted from this work: - The azide/nitrate route has been {{turned out to be}} a very seminal and promising technique for the preparation of oxomolybdates and oxotungstates. - This synthetic method provides an access to oxynitrides of molybdenum and tungsten, besides nitrogen free oxides. Nitrogen does not only serve as a volatile reaction product, but it can also be installed as a part of the solid state product at the applied reaction conditions. - Several modifications of azide-nitrate route have been performed to obtain the desired product in the pure form. - The usual oxidation state adopted by the transition metals involved here is + 6. The oxidation potential of the reaction mixture is strong enough to oxidize molybdenum and tungsten to the highest possible state even when starting with the dioxide or the elemental metal. The following compounds have been discovered and characterized in the course of this work. 1. Na 3 MoO 3 N The new molybdenum oxynitride, Na 3 MoO 3 N, was prepared via the azide route from stoichiometric mixtures of MoO 3 and NaN 3 at 650 °C. Its crystal structure was solved and refined from X-ray powder data (orthorhombic, Pmn 21, a = 7. 2463 (1) Å, b = 6. 2498 (1) Å, c = 5. 6386 (1) Å, Z = 2, Rp: 0. 0904; Rwp: 0. 0983). The structure consists of isolated [MoO 3 N]^ 3 - tetrahedra which are separated by Na^+ cations, also in a tetrahedral co-ordination. It is isostructural to Na 3 WO 3 N which is a lower symmetry derivative of the Cu 3 AsS 4 structure type. Due to the small difference in the scattering lengths of nitrogen and oxygen, it was impossible to decide between the borderline cases of completely ordered or disordered anions or a partial ordering. However, from the positive SHG responses, we can deduce the acentric space group being the correct one and based on the lattice energy calculations, we have been able to identify the position most probably being occupied by nitrogen. 2. Na 5 MoO 4 N The new oxynitride, Na 5 MoO 4 N, was prepared from stoichiometric mixtures of the starting materials MoO 2, Na 2 O 2 and NaN 3 which were heated in a special regime up to 500 °C, and cooled down slowly. Its crystal structure was solved and refined from single crystal data (orthorhombic, Cmcm, a = 9. 911 (2) Å, b = 5. 743 (1) Å, c = 10. 677 (2) Å, Z = 4, R 1 = 0. 0153, wR 2 = 0. 0427). The structure consists of isolated &# 61531;MoO 4 N&# 61533;^ 5 - rectangular pyramids which are separated by Na^+ cations. This compound is structurally related to Na 5 WO 4 N which crystallizes acentrically in space group Cmc 21. 3. K 3 Na(WO 4) 2 The new quaternary tungstate, K 3 Na(WO 4) 2, was synthesized by heating the stoichiometric mixture of the corresponding alkali tungstates, anhydrous sodium tungstate and anhydrous potassium tungstate. The colorless oxide obtained was found to be stable till 1000 °C. K 3 Na(WO 4) 2 is isostructural to the naturally occurring mineral glaserite, K 3 Na(SO 4) 2. Similar to some glaserite type compounds, K 3 Na(WO 4) 2 shows a phase transition which was observed from the HT-X-ray measurements. The room temperature phase was found to be monoclinic (space group: C 2 /c) with the lattice constants: a = 10. 4928 (1) Å, b = 6. 0693 (1) Å, c = 15. 2921 (1) Å, Z = 8 and Beta = 90. 087 (2) ° and, at the temperature above 250 °C, a hexagonal cell of space group P m 1 with a = 6. 1305 (1) Å and c = 7. 6944 (1) Å was observed. The main building units of the crystal structure are WO 4 tetrahedra, which are linked by sodium and potassium cations. The main structural difference between the monoclinic and the trigonal structure is the tilting of the WO 4 tetrahedra and also the coordination of the potassium ions. The coordination number of potassium was found to be 10 and 12 for the HT-phase and, 9 and 10 for the RT-phase. 4. K 6 Mo 10 O 33 The new potassium molybdenum oxide, K 6 Mo 10 O 33, was synthesized by the solid state reaction from the appropriate quantities of the pre-dried metal oxide and potassium molybdate fired at around 650 °C for 2 days. The crystal structure of K 6 Mo 10 O 33 has been solved by using single crystal X-ray diffraction data, the structural refinement was performed by the full-matrix least squares calculation method. The compound adopts the space group P 1 with the lattice constants a = 7. 7100 (5) Å, b = 11. 9659 (8) Å, c = 17. 1321 (1) Å, Z = 2 with Alpha = 86. 42 °,Beta= 77. 18 ° and Gamma= 74. 14 °. The compound is diamagnetic and decomposes at around 950 °C. The structure consists of infinite chains of edge-sharing MoO 6 octahedra which are linked in the second dimension by Mo 4 O 17 groups via common vertices. The structure of this compound is related to Na 6 Mo 10 O 33 and Ag 6 Mo 10 O 33. 5. Cubic Alkali Oxynitrides of Molybdenum, Tungsten and Niobium, A 3 MO 4 -nNn A group of cubic molybdates and tungstates of the formula A 6 M 2 O 9 with A = Na, K, Rb or Cs, M = Mo or W, is known for about 25 years, but the crystal structures have not been solved. After our attempts of syntheses and elemental analyses, it turned out that these compounds contain nitrogen and have to be regarded as oxynitrides. A number of these phases of molybdenum and tungsten and, for comparison, of niobium of the general formula A 3 MO 4 -nNn (A = Na, K, Rb; for n = 1 : M = Mo, W; for n = 0 : M = Nb) were synthesized by using the azide-nitrate/nitrite route, in detail there are - Na 3 MoO 3 N - K 3 MoO 3 N - Rb 3 MoO 3 N - K 3 WO 3 N - K 3 NbO 4. All the compounds are isostructural and crystallize in an F-centered cubic lattice. Single crystals for K 3 MoO 3 N and Na 3 MoO 3 N, were successfully grown. According to crystal structure determinations in space group Fm- 3 m (K 3 MoO 3 N: a = 8. 612 (1) Å, Z = 4, R 1 = 0. 058, wR 2 = 0. 2066), the cations are ordered, but the tetrahedral MoO 3 N anions are rotationally disordered in a way that an octahedral surrounding of the transition metal is pretended. Also different positions of oxygen and nitrogen have not been observed. This phenomenon of rotational disorder remembers to the behavior of other compounds with the general formula A 3 MO 4, e. g. the good ionic conductor Na 3 PO 4 and other phosphates. All the phases obtained here are insulators. The cubic Na 3 MoO 3 N has obviously the same composition as the orthorhombic phase presented in chapter 1. However, no way to transform one phase into the other has been found. The incurring of the cubic Na 3 MoO 3 N is restricted to the presence of another <b>nitrogen-containing</b> <b>compound</b> such as NaNO 3 or (NH 4) 2 Mo 2 O 7 in the reaction mixture besides the presence of azide. In dieser Arbeit wurde besonderes Gewicht auf Synthese und Charakterisierung neuer Alkalioxide und -oxynitride von Molybdän und Wolfram gelegt. Insbesondere der kürzlich entwickelte Ansatz zur Synthese über die Azid-Nitrat-Route sollte untersucht und gegebenenfalls auf die Oxide der schweren Elemente der Gruppe VI angewendet werden. Zur Charakterisierung der erhaltenen, neuen Verbindungen wurden die Kristallstrukturen anhand von Röntgendaten mittels Einkristall- oder Pulvermethoden bestimmt, weiterhin wurden DTA/TG- und DSC-Messungen, Messungen der spezifischen Wärme, IR- und Ramanspektroskopie sowie Messungen der magnetischen Eigenschaften und der Leitfähigkeit durchgeführt. Als allgemeine Ergebnisse dieser Arbeit können folgende Punkte festgehalten werden: - Die Azid-Nitrat-Route hat sich als sehr fruchtbare und vielversprechende Methode zur Präparation von Oxomolybdaten und -wolframaten erwiesen. - Die Synthesemethode bietet, außer zu reinen Oxiden, zusätzlich einen Zugang zu Oxynitriden von Molybdän und Wolfram. Stickstoff übernimmt hier nicht ausschließlich die Rolle eines flüchtigen Reaktionsproduktes, sondern kann unter den herrschenden Reaktionsbedingungen außerdem in den als Feststoff vorliegenden Teil der Produkte eingebaut sein. - Um die gewünschten produkte in Reinform zu erhalten, wurden Modifizierungen der Azid-Nitrat-Route vorgenommen. - Die beteiligten Übergangsmetalle liegen in den Reaktionsprodukten durchweg in der Oxidationsstufe + 6 vor. Das Oxidationspotential der Reaktionsmischung reicht aus, um Molybdän und Wolfram, auch bei Verwendung der Dioxide oder der Metalle als Ausgangsverbindung, in den höchstmöglichen Zustand zu oxidieren. Die nachfolgenden Verbindungen wurden im Rahmen dieser Arbeit erstmals dargestellt und charakterisiert. 1. Na 3 MoO 3 N Natriummolybdänoxynitrid, Na 3 MoO 3 N, wurde über die Azid-Nitrat-Route aus einer Mischung aus MoO 3 und NaN 3 bei 650 °C dargestellt. Die Kristallstruktur wurde aus Röntgenpulverdaten gelöst und verfeinert (orthorhombisch, Pmn 21, a = 7. 2463 (1), b = 6. 2498 (1), c = 5. 6386 (1) Å, Z = 2, Rp = 0. 0904, Rwp = 0. 0983). Die Kristallstruktur besteht aus isolierten [MoO 3 N]^ 3 - -Tetraedern, welche von in ebenfalls tetraedrischer Umgebung befindlichen Na^+ -Kationen separiert werden. Na 3 MoO 3 N ist isostrukturell zu Na 3 WO 3 N, einem niedersymmetrischen Verwandten des Cu 3 AsS 4 -Strukurtyps. Aufgrund der geringen Unterschiede des Streuvermögens von Sauerstoff und Stickstoff läßt sich nicht entscheiden, ob einer der Grenzfälle vollständig ausgeordneter oder vollständig ungeordneter Anionen vorliegt, oder aber eine teilweise Ordnung. Durch Messungen des SHG-Effektes läßt sich jedoch eindeutig auf eine azentrische Raumgruppe schließen, und anhand von Berechnungen der Gitterenergie kann die am wahrscheinlichsten von Stickstoff besetzte Position bestimmt werden. 2. Na 5 MoO 4 N Ein weiteres neues Molybdänoxynitrid, Na 5 MoO 4 N, wurde aus stöchiometrischen Mischungen von MoO 2, Na 2 O 2 und NaN 3 synthetisiert, die nach einem speziellen Temperaturprogramm auf 500 °C erhitzt und anschließend langsam abgekühlt wurden. Die Kristallstruktur wurde anhand von Einkristalldaten gelöst und verfeinert (orthorhombisch, Cmcm, a = 9. 911 (2) Å, b = 5. 743 (1) Å, c = 10. 677 (2) Å, Z = 4, R 1 = 0. 0153, wR 2 = 0. 0427). Die Kristallstruktur setzt sich aus quadratischen [MoO 4 N]^ 5 - -Pyramiden und Na^+ -Kationen zusammen. Die Anionen sind in diesem Fall ausgeordnet, das Stickstoffatom bildet die Spitze der [MoO 4 N]^ 5 - -Pyramide. Die Verbindung ist nahe verwandt mit Na 5 WO 4 N, das azentrisch in der Raumgruppe Cmc 21 kristallisiert. 3. K 3 Na(WO 4) 2 Ein neues quaternäres Wolframat, K 3 Na(WO 4) 2, wurde durch Erhitzen stöchiometrischer Mischungen der entsprechenden entwässerten ternären Alkaliwolframate, Na 2 WO 4 und K 2 WO 4, dargestellt. Das erhaltene farblose Oxid ist bis 1000 °C stabil. K 3 Na(WO 4) 2 ist isostrukturell zum natürlich vorkommenden Mineral Glaserit, K 3 NaSO 4. Wie einige weitere, im Glaserittyp kristallisierende Verbindungen durchläuft K 3 Na(WO 4) 2 einen Phasenübergang, der bei HT-Röntgenbeugungsmessungen beobachtet werden konnte. Die Raumtemperaturmodifikation kristallisiert monoklin mit a = 10. 4928 (1) Å, b = 6. 0693 (1) Å, c = 15. 2921 (1) Å, Z = 8 und Beta = 90. 087 (2) °, bei 250 °C wird ein hexagonales Gitter mit a = 6. 1305 (1) und c = 7. 6944 (1) Å beobachtet. Die wichtigsten Baugruppen der Kristallstruktur sind WO 4 -Tetraeder, die durch Kalium- und Natriumkationen verbunden werden. Der Hauptunterschied zwischen der monoklinen und der hexagonalen Phase besteht in der Neigung der WO 4 -Tetraeder sowie in der Umgebung der Kaliumionen. Die Koordinationszahl von Kalium ist 10 und 12 in der HT- bzw. 9 und 10 in der RT-Phase. 4. K 6 Mo 10 O 33 K 6 Mo 10 O 33 wurde aus geeigneten Mengen des vorgetrockneten Molybdänoxids und Kaliummolybdats durch zweitägiges Erhitzen bei 650 °C präpariert. Die Kristallstruktur von K 6 Mo 10 O 33 wurde anhand von Einkristalldaten unter Verwendung des Verfahrens der kleinsten Fehlerquadrate bestimmt (P 1, a = 7. 7100 (5), b = 11. 9659 (8), c = 17. 1321 (1) Å, Z = 2, Alpha = 86. 42 °, Beta = 77. 18 °, Gamma = 74. 14 °). Die Verbindung ist diamagnetisch und zersetzt sich bei ungefähr 950 °C. Die Kristallstruktur wird aus unendlichen Ketten von kantenverknüpften MoO 6 -Oktaedern gebildet, die von Mo 4 O 17 -Einheiten über gemeinsame Ecken zu Schichten verbunden werden. Die Struktur weist Ähnlichkeiten zu denen von Na 6 Mo 10 O 33 und Ag 6 Mo 10 O 33 auf. 5. Kubische Alkalioxynitride von Molybdän, Wolfram und Niob, A 3 MO 4 -nNn Eine Reihe kubischer Molybdate und Wolframnate der Zusammensetzung A 6 M 2 O 9 mit A = Na, K, Rb or Cs, M = Mo, W, ist seit etwa 25 Jahren bekannt, allerdings gelang es bisher nicht, deren Kristallstrukturen zu bestimmen. Nach unseren Syntheseversuchen und nach Elementaranalysen stellte sich heraus, daß diese Verbindungen Stickstoff enthalten und daher als Oxynitride angesehen werden müssen. Einige dieser molybdän-, wolfram- und, zum Vergleich, niobhaltigen Phasen der allgemeinen Zusammensetzung A 3 MO 4 -nNn (A = Na, K, Rb; für n = 1 : M = Mo, W; für n = 0 : M = Nb) wurden über die Azid-Nitrat/Nitrit-Route dargestellt, im einzelnen sind dies - Na 3 MoO 3 N - K 3 MoO 3 N - Rb 3 MoO 3 N - K 3 WO 3 N - K 3 NbO 4. Sämtliche Verbindungen sind isostrukturell und kristallisieren kubisch flächenzentriert. Von K 3 MoO 3 N and Na 3 MoO 3 N gelang die Zucht von Einkristallen, anhand derer die Kristallstruktur bestimmt werden konnte (K 3 MoO 3 N: Fm- 3 m, a = 8. 612 (1) Å, Z = 4, R 1 = 0. 058, wR 2 = 0. 2066) Während die Kationen ausgeordnet sind, können die Anionen nicht unterschiedlichen Positionen zugeordnet werden und sind fehlgeordnet. Zudem sind die [MoO 3 N] 3 -Anionen auf solche Weise rotationsfehlgeordnet, daß eine oktaedrische Umgebung des Übergangsmetallatoms vorgetäuscht wird. Das Auftreten von Rotationsfehlordnung tetraedrischer Baugruppen erinnert stark an das ähnlicher Verbindungen der allgemeinen Formel A 3 MO 4, darunter der gute Ionenleiter Na 3 PO 4 sowie weitere Phosphate. Alle hier erhaltenen Phasen sind Isolatoren. Das hier erwähnte kubische Na 3 MoO 3 N hat die gleiche Zusammensetzung wie die orthorhombische Phase, die in Kapitel 1 dieser Arbeit vorgestellt wurde. Allerdings wurde keine Möglichkeit gefunden, die beiden Modifikationen ineinander zu überführen. Der Erhalt des kubischen Na 3 MoO 3 N ist an die Anwesenheit einer weiteren stickstoffhaltigen Komponente in der Reaktionsmischung neben dem Azid, d. h. NaNO 3 oder (NH 4) 2 Mo 2 O 7, gebunden...|$|E
