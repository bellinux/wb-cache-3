5|$|In October 2014 the Russian {{authorities}} {{declined to}} issue Bukovsky {{with a new}} foreign-travel passport. The Foreign Ministry stated that it could <b>not</b> <b>confirm</b> Bukovsky's citizenship.

5|$|Alexander Aldea died {{in autumn}} 1436, {{enabling}} Vlad Dracul to seize Wallachia with Hungarian support.

5|$|Brunner's term as Ohio Secretary of State ends in 2011 and {{was up for}} {{re-election}} in 2010 along with other Ohio statewide offices. In January, rumors that were eventually confirmed began circulating that second term Republican United States Senator George Voinovich would not run {{for re-election}} in 2010. Brunner's name was mentioned as a potential Democratic candidate for the seat. On January 23, 2009, Brunner and Ohio Lieutenant Governor Lee Fisher met to discuss the possibility that either of them would run, but did <b>not</b> <b>confirm</b> any decision or leanings to the media.|$|E

5|$|On July 5, 2010 Six Flags Great Adventure {{announced}} that its Great American Scream Machine would close on July 18 {{to make way}} for a new attraction the following year, sparking rumors that Chang would move there in 2011. Although Six Flags did <b>not</b> <b>confirm</b> the speculation, a first look at the park's new-ride layout from the Jackson Township zoning board meeting was posted on the JTown Magazine website and the layout was identical to that of Chang.|$|E
5|$|Several {{days after}} Hurricane Six lost its {{identity}} over Mexico, a new tropical storm formed near {{the southern edge}} of the Gulf of California on September20. Some forecasters stated that the system may have been the remnants of the preceding storm which regenerated. However, the Hurricane Database did <b>not</b> <b>confirm</b> this. The system tracked nearly due north, attaining maximum winds of 50mph (85km/h), nearing the coastline of Mexico several times. However, the storm did not make landfall during its existence. On September22, it turned westward before dissipating just off the coast of Baja California Sur.|$|E
5|$|Six weeks later, Binky was {{involved}} in another mauling. Drunken local teenagers approached the bear's enclosure, apparently hoping to swim in its pool, and one 19-year-old was hospitalized with leg lacerations after he was mauled. The zoo did <b>not</b> <b>confirm</b> that Binky was the attacker, but the bear had blood on his face following the incident.|$|E

5|$|Taraborrelli {{stated that}} Jackson was {{diagnosed}} with lupus, that the vitiligo partially lightened his skin, and the lupus was in remission, and both illnesses made him sensitive to sunlight, which could have caused his lupus condition to recur. Jackson's autopsy did <b>not</b> <b>confirm</b> or refute the claim that he had lupus, but it did confirm that he had vitiligo. His skin {{was found to have}} reduced (though not absent) melanocytes, the cells active in skin pigmentation.|$|E
5|$|The Atlantic {{hurricane}} reanalysis project {{also indicated}} but could <b>not</b> <b>confirm</b> {{the presence of}} an additional tropical storm in October1901, instead listing the cyclone as a tropical depression. However, the reanalysis added a previously undetected hurricane in late August to the Atlantic hurricane database(HURDAT). The seventh tropical cyclone that year was the strongest by maximum sustained winds, peaking at 105mph (165km/h), equivalent to a Category2 hurricane. However, the fourth hurricane had a lower barometric pressure and was thus the most intense storm of the season.|$|E
5|$|The Atlantic {{hurricane}} reanalysis project {{also indicated}} but could <b>not</b> <b>confirm</b> {{the presence of}} four additional tropical depressions throughout the season. However, the reanalysis added a previously undetected tropical storm in late October to the Atlantic hurricane database(HURDAT). Reanalysis also resulted in the eighth cyclone being downgraded from a hurricane to a tropical storm.|$|E

5|$|The {{name was}} soon embraced by wider culture. In 1930, Walt Disney was {{apparently}} inspired by {{it when he}} introduced for Mickey Mouse a canine companion named Pluto, although Disney animator Ben Sharpsteen could <b>not</b> <b>confirm</b> why the name was given. In 1941, Glenn T. Seaborg named the newly created element plutonium after Pluto, {{in keeping with the}} tradition of naming elements after newly discovered planets, following uranium, which was named after Uranus, and neptunium, which was named after Neptune.|$|E
5|$|Major Francis L. Dade, {{military}} commandant at Key West, received {{intelligence that}} Cuba and Spain were arming the Indians; investigations did <b>not</b> <b>confirm</b> the rumor. Reports coming from Fort Brooke, near present-day Tampa, noted that Indians {{in the area}} were resisting orders {{from the federal government}} to emigrate to Mississippi, contradicting the assertions made by the federal authorities that the Indians had agreed to emigrate peacefully. Dade, two companies of soldiers, and all of the available arms were sent to Fort Brooke at Tampa Bay, the port designated for the commencement of the Indians' emigration. The Indians answered by concentrating all of their forces in the New River region. On December 28, 1835, Dade and 107soldiers were ambushed en route from Tampa Bay to Fort King, near present-day Ocala. Only three soldiers survived; the attackers lost only three men.|$|E
5|$|The Maudsley–Bethlem {{study also}} {{hypothesized}} that schizophrenia {{was caused by}} a mixture of many small traits working together. These endophenotypes could be used for diagnosis. Endophenotypes have been interpreted as a link between genes and the final behavior, acted on by the environment and chance elements, with biochemical and epigenetic influences changing the genome but not being passed on to children. Molecular-biological studies in genetics have referred to endophenotypes to explain genetic causes of psychopathology. The researchers also examined how schizoids, those with mild, schizophrenia-like personality disorders, were linked to schizophrenics. Gottesman and Shields extended the term to classes of mild psychological disorders in twins and relatives of schizophrenics. The researchers had hypothesized that schizoida in a twin was how a schizophrenia carrier gene, one in a non-schizophrenic still passing on a genetic risk, expressed itself. The twin study did <b>not</b> <b>confirm</b> this.|$|E

5|$|The U.S. had {{acquired}} {{over a thousand}} vessels during World War I, and still owned most of them when Harding took office. Congress had authorized their disposal in 1920, but the Senate would <b>not</b> <b>confirm</b> Wilson's nominees to the Shipping Board. Harding appointed Albert Lasker as its chairman; the advertising executive undertook to run the fleet as profitably as possible until it could be sold. Most ships proved impossible to sell at anything approaching the government's cost. Lasker recommended a large subsidy to the merchant marine to enable the sales, and Harding repeatedly urged Congress to enact it. Unpopular in the Midwest, the bill passed the House but was defeated by a filibuster in the Senate, and most government ships were eventually scrapped.|$|E
5|$|The Viceroy, {{trying to}} calm the criollos, gave {{his own version of}} events in a proclamation. He asked for {{allegiance}} to King FerdinandVII, but popular unrest continued to intensify. He was aware of the news, but only said that the situation on the Iberian Peninsula was delicate; he did <b>not</b> <b>confirm</b> the fall of the Junta. His proposal was to make a government body that would rule on behalf of FerdinandVII, together with Viceroy of Peru José Fernando de Abascal y Sousa, Governor of Potosí Francisco de Paula Sanz and President of the Royal Audiencia of Charcas Vicente Nieto.|$|E
5|$|The fur, {{which is}} soft, dense, and thick, is dark brown to gray on the upperparts, grading to black on the midback and {{yellowish}} brown on the sides. The underparts are sharply different in color. There, the hairs are dark gray at their bases and white at the tips, {{so that the}} fur appears grayish white. The fur is shorter and darker than in T.talamancae and softer and thicker than in H.alfaroi. Young animals have darker, finer, and softer fur. Pine separated the subspecies alleni and orinus {{on the basis of}} their darker fur, but Musser and colleagues could <b>not</b> <b>confirm</b> this pattern and found paler and darker specimens within the same geographical regions.|$|E
