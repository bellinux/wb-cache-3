25|$|The {{name that}} appears in the {{machine-readable}} zone {{at the bottom of}} the visa represents the holder’s Cyrillic name mapped into the Roman alphabet. This allows Russian computer systems to read the Cyrillic name, despite the machine readers only being able to read Roman alphabet letters. As a result, the spelling of a name in the machine-readable zone does not <b>necessarily</b> <b>reflect</b> its spelling in the visa’s name field.

These paintings are the progenitors of the fashion of the later 17th century for having one's portrait painted in undress, and do not <b>necessarily</b> <b>reflect</b> clothing as it was actually worn.|$|E

25|$|These standings do not <b>necessarily</b> <b>reflect</b> a skater/couple's capabilities. Due to {{limits on}} entries to events (no {{more than three}} from each country), and varying numbers of {{high-level}} skaters in each country, skaters from some countries may find {{it more difficult to}} qualify to compete at major events. Thus, a skater with a lower SB but from a country with few high-level skaters may qualify to a major event while a skater with a much higher SB but from a country with more than three high-level skaters may not be sent. As a result, it is possible for a skater who regularly scores higher to end up with a much lower world standing.|$|E
25|$|Because the pseudonymous authors write from {{perspectives}} {{which are}} not Kierkegaard's own, some of the philosophy {{mentioned in this article}} may or may not <b>necessarily</b> <b>reflect</b> Kierkegaard's own beliefs. Just as other philosophers bring up viewpoints in their essays to discuss and criticize them, Kierkegaard assigns pseudonyms to explore a particular viewpoint in-depth, which may take up a whole book or two in some instances, and Kierkegaard, or another pseudonym, critiques that position. For example, the author, Johannes Climacus is not a Christian and he argues from a non-Christian viewpoint. Anti-Climacus, as mentioned earlier, is a Christian to a high degree and he argues from a devout Christian viewpoint. Kierkegaard places his beliefs in-between these two authors.|$|E
