5|$|Alprazolam is {{primarily}} metabolized via CYP3A4. Combining CYP3A4 inhibitors such as cimetidine, erythromycin, norfluoxetine, fluvoxamine, itraconazole, ketoconazole, <b>nefazodone,</b> propoxyphene, and ritonavir delay the hepatic clearance of alprazolam, which {{may result in}} its accumulation and increased severity of its side effects.|$|E
5|$|Epidemiological {{studies of}} {{serotonin}} syndrome are difficult as many physicians {{are unaware of}} the diagnosis or they may miss the syndrome due to its variable manifestations. In 1998 a survey conducted in England found that 85% of the general practitioners that had prescribed the antidepressant <b>nefazodone</b> were unaware of serotonin syndrome. The incidence may be increasing as {{a larger number of}} pro-serotonergic drugs (drugs which increase serotonin levels) are now being used in clinical practice. One postmarketing surveillance study identified an incidence of 0.4 cases per 1000 patient-months for patients who were taking <b>nefazodone.</b> Additionally, around 14 to 16 percent of persons who overdose on SSRIs are thought to develop serotonin syndrome.|$|E
5|$|Drugs {{may cause}} or affect {{clitoral}} priapism. The drug trazodone {{is known to}} cause male priapism as a side effect, but {{there is only one}} documented report that it may have caused clitoral priapism, in which case discontinuing the medication may be a remedy. Additionally, <b>nefazodone</b> is documented to have caused clitoral engorgement, as distinct from clitoral priapism, in one case, and clitoral priapism can sometimes start as a result of, or only after, the discontinuation of antipsychotics or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).|$|E
5|$|Protease inhibitors, <b>nefazodone,</b> sertraline, grapefruit, fluoxetine, erythromycin, diltiazem, {{clarithromycin}} {{inhibit the}} metabolism of midazolam, {{leading to a}} prolonged action. St John's wort, rifapentine, rifampin, rifabutin, phenytoin enhance the metabolism of midazolam leading to a reduced action. Sedating antidepressants, antiepileptic drugs such as phenobarbital, phenytoin and carbamazepine, sedative antihistamines, opioids, antipsychotics and alcohol enhance the sedative effects of midazolam. Midazolam is metabolized almost completely by cytochrome P450-3A4. Atorvastatin administration along with midazolam results in a reduced elimination rate of midazolam. St John's wort decreases the blood levels of midazolam. Grapefruit juice reduces intestinal 3A4 and results in less metabolism and higher plasma concentrations.|$|E

25|$|Inhibition {{of complex}} I has {{been implicated in}} {{hepatotoxicity}} associated {{with a variety of}} drugs, for instance flutamide and <b>nefazodone.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Nefazodone</b> {{operates}} {{by blocking}} post-synaptic serotonin type-2A receptors {{and to a}} lesser extent by inhibiting pre-synaptic serotonin and norepinephrine (noradrenaline) reuptake.|$|E
25|$|Trazodone is a triazolopyridine {{derivative}} and a phenylpiperazine that is chemically {{related to}} <b>nefazodone</b> and etoperidone, {{each of which}} are derivatives of it.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} therapeutic {{drugs were}} {{withdrawn from the}} market primarily because of hepatotoxicity: Troglitazone, bromfenac, trovafloxacin, ebrotidine, nimesulide, <b>nefazodone,</b> ximelagatran and pemoline.|$|E
25|$|Comparative {{clinical}} trials demonstrated that sertraline {{is similar in}} efficacy against depression to moclobemide, <b>nefazodone,</b> escitalopram, bupropion, citalopram, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, and mirtazapine. There is low quality evidence that sertraline is more efficacious {{for the treatment of}} depression than fluoxetine.|$|E
25|$|In a {{study of}} 1022 outpatients, overall sexual {{dysfunction}} with all antidepressants averaged 59.1% with SSRIs values between 57 and 73%, mirtazapine 24%, <b>nefazodone</b> 8%, amineptine 7% and moclobemide 4%. Moclobemide, a selective reversible MAO-A inhibitor, does not cause sexual dysfunction, and can actually lead to an improvement {{in all aspects of}} sexual function.|$|E
25|$|Cannabis use {{disorder}} {{is defined in}} the fifth revision of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) as a condition requiring treatment. Several drugs have been investigated {{in an attempt to}} ameliorate the symptoms of stopping cannabis use. Such drugs include bupropion, divalproex, <b>nefazodone,</b> lofexidine, and dronabinol. Of these, dronabinol has proven the most effective.|$|E
25|$|Rifampicin {{causes a}} very notable {{reduction}} in half-life of zopiclone and peak plasma levels, {{which results in}} a large reduction in the hypnotic effect of zopiclone. Phenytoin and carbamazepine may also provoke similar interactions. Ketoconazole and sulfaphenazole interfere with the metabolism of zopiclone. <b>Nefazodone</b> impairs the metabolism of zopiclone leading to increased zopiclone levels and marked next-day sedation.|$|E
25|$|Serotonin {{antagonist}} and reuptake inhibitors (SARIs) while mainly used as antidepressants, {{are also}} anxiolytics and hypnotics. They act by antagonizing serotonin receptors such as 5-HT2A and inhibiting the reuptake of serotonin, norepinephrine, and/or dopamine. Additionally, most also act as α1-adrenergic receptor antagonists. The {{majority of the}} currently marketed SARIs belong to the phenylpiperazine class of compounds. They include trazodone and <b>nefazodone.</b>|$|E
25|$|Cabergoline, an agonist of {{dopamine}} D₂ receptors which inhibits prolactin production, {{was found}} in a small study to fully restore orgasm in one third of anorgasmic subjects, and partially restore orgasm in another third. Limited data has shown that the drug amantadine may help to relieve SSRI-induced sexual dysfunction. Cyproheptadine, buspirone, stimulants such as amphetamines (including the antidepressant bupropion), <b>nefazodone</b> and yohimbine have been used to treat SSRI-induced anorgasmia. Reducing the SSRI dosage may also resolve anorgasmia problems.|$|E
25|$|Clonazepam is lipid-soluble, rapidly {{crosses the}} blood–brain barrier, and penetrates the placenta. It is {{extensively}} metabolised into pharmacologically inactive metabolites. Clonazepam is metabolized extensively via nitroreduction by cytochrome P450 enzymes, particularly CYP2C19 {{and to a}} lesser extent CYP3A4. Erythromycin, clarithromycin, ritonavir, itraconazole, ketoconazole, <b>nefazodone,</b> cimetidine, and grapefruit juice are inhibitors of CYP3A4 and can affect the metabolism of benzodiazepines. It has an elimination half-life of 19–60 hours. Peak blood concentrations of 6.5–13.5ng/mL were usually reached within 1–2 hours following a single 2mg oral dose of micronized clonazepam in healthy adults. In some individuals, however, peak blood concentrations were reached at 4–8 hours.|$|E
25|$|Its use is advised {{against in}} people on strong CYP3A4 inhibitors such as clarithromycin, chloramphenicol, ketoconazole, {{ritonavir}} and <b>nefazodone</b> {{due to its}} reliance on CYP3A4 for metabolism. Likewise it is a CYP3A4, CYP2D6 and CYP2C9 inhibitor and hence concurrent treatment with substrates {{of any of these}} enzymes may increase plasma concentrations of said drugs. Since imatinib is mainly metabolised via the liver enzyme CYP3A4, substances influencing the activity of this enzyme change the plasma concentration of the drug. An example of a drug that increases imatinib activity and therefore side effects by blocking CYP3A4 is ketoconazole. The same could be true of itraconazole, clarithromycin, grapefruit juice, among others. Conversely, CYP3A4 inductors like rifampicin and St. John's Wort reduce the drug's activity, risking therapy failure. Imatinib also acts as an inhibitor of CYP3A4, 2C9 and 2D6, increasing the plasma concentrations of a number of other drugs like simvastatin, ciclosporin, pimozide, warfarin, metoprolol, and possibly paracetamol. The drug also reduces plasma levels of levothyroxin via an unknown mechanism.|$|E
2500|$|Ketoconazole and Itraconazole have a {{profound}} effect on the pharmacokinetics of triazolam, leading to greatly enhanced effects. Anxiety, tremor and depression have been documented in a case report following administration of nitrazepam and triazolam. Following administration of erythromycin, repetitive hallucinations and abnormal bodily sensations developed. The patient had, however, acute pneumonia and renal failure. Co-administration of benzodiazepine drugs at therapeutic doses with erythromycin may cause serious psychotic symptoms, especially in those with other physical complications. Caffeine reduces the effectiveness of triazolam. Other important interactions include cimetidine, diltiazem, erythromycin, [...] fluconazole, grapefruit juice, isoniazid, itraconazole, ketoconazole, <b>nefazodone,</b> [...] rifampicin, ritonavir, and troleandomycin. Triazolam should not be administered to patients on Atripla.|$|E
2500|$|Like other SSRIs, {{sertraline}} {{is associated}} with sexual side effects, including sexual arousal disorder and difficulty achieving orgasm. The observed frequency of sexual side effects depends greatly on whether they are reported by patients spontaneously, as in the manufacturer's trials, or actively solicited by the physicians. There have been several double-blind studies of sexual side effects comparing sertraline with placebo or other antidepressants. While <b>nefazodone</b> (Serzone), bupropion (Wellbutrin) and reboxetine (Edronax) did not have negative effects on sexual functioning, 67% of men on sertraline experienced ejaculation difficulties vs. 18% before the treatment (or 61% vs. 0% according to another paper). Similarly, {{in a group of}} women who initially did not have difficulties achieving orgasm, 41% acquired this problem during treatment with sertraline. A 40% rate of orgasm dysfunction (vs. 9% for placebo) on sertraline was observed in a mixed group in another study. Sexual arousal disorder, defined as [...] "inadequate lubrication and swelling for women and erectile difficulties for men", occurred in 12% of patients on sertraline as compared with 1% of patients on placebo. The mood improvement resulting from the treatment with sertraline sometimes counteracted these side effects, so that sexual desire and overall satisfaction with sex stayed the same as before the sertraline treatment. However, under the action of placebo the desire and satisfaction slightly improved.|$|E
