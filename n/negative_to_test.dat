40|$|Amphibian {{mortality}} {{caused by}} rail traffic has not {{attracted much attention}} in comparison to road mortality. Density of railways in landscape, as well as traffic intensity, is usually much lower than in case of roads. As a consequence, their overall effect on amphibian populations is tacitly assumed to be less <b>negative.</b> <b>To</b> <b>test</b> whether very intensive rail traffic can cause substantial mortality in population of a small amphibian, we investigated a Smooth newt Lissotriton vulgaris population located {{in the city of}} Poznań, W Poland, where tram tracks border isolated breeding ponds. We performed controls during the peak of autumn migratory activity along the tracks. Less than 1 % of all individuals found during the survey were killed by rail traffic. Observed mortality was very low despite large number of individuals present on the track and intensive tram traffic. As negative effects of traffic are low, rail or tram embankments can provide an important terrestrial habitat for small European newts. </p...|$|E

40|$|World Trade Organization (WTO) is {{the largest}} trade {{organization}} {{which is supposed to}} open the international trade for the benefit of all countries through liberalization or removing impediments over trade. It may directly impact import and export and indirectly other macroeconomic variables. In this context, Azerbaijan’s accession process to WTO has been subject to many discussions in terms of what impacts are expected for the economy in case of the accession. This thesis attempts to do an empirical analysis of the expected macroeconomic impacts of the membership on Azerbaijan economy through application of VAR model. In this thesis, central question is what overall macroeconomic impact is expected for Azerbaijan’s economy if Azerbaijan join to WTO. In this context, I hypothesize that macroeconomic impact of the membership over Azerbaijan economy is expected to be <b>negative.</b> <b>To</b> <b>test</b> my hypothesis, I benefit from the membership experience of Georgia and Armenia and use VAR model to estimate time series data for Georgia and Armenia individually, and panel data consisted of Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan’s time series data. After all, I conclude that WTO membership increases import much more than export. However, the research fails to find enough evidence to say that overall impact of WTO membership is statistically significant. After taking Azerbaijan’s economic characteristics into consideration, the research concludes that overall macroeconomic impact of WTO membership is expected to be negative for Azerbaijan. ...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe have {{previously}} tested biopsies from 1469 breast tumours with a p 53 functional assay {{in the context}} of a prospective clinical trial (EORTC 10994 /BIG 1 - 00). The goal of the trial was to determine whether p 53 status could be used to select patients who would benefit from inclusion of taxanes in anthracycline-based chemotherapy. The results of the trial were <b>negative.</b> <b>To</b> <b>test</b> whether this was because the functional assay misclassified the tumours, we have reanalysed two groups of biopsies by Sanger sequencing and Roche 454 next generation sequencing (NGS). Comparison of yeast data with pooled cDNA sequencing data in an initial cohort of 69 biopsies showed that conventional sequencing is insensitive when the mutant p 53 content is low. A second cohort of 48 biopsies was used to compare directly the yeast assay with Sanger and NGS technology. The mutant sequence was difficult to detect in sequence chromatograms of pooled cDNA, whereas NGS unequivocally identified mutations in every case classified as mutant by the functional assay. The NGS data showed that small deletions, probably caused by PCR splicing, account for most of the unexplained background in the yeast assay. We conclude that mutation detection techniques that test multiple clones, such as the p 53 functional assay and NGS, are more reliable than Sanger sequencing of pooled DNA; that the high p 53 mutation rate (44 %) seen with the yeast assay in the EORTC 10994 /BIG 1 - 00 trial reflects this high sensitivity; and that NGS with Roche 454 technology could be used to identify the p 53 mutations in the remaining tumours previously tested in yeast in the EORTC 10994 /BIG 1 - 00 trial...|$|E

40|$|In {{this thesis}} I try to clarify some {{molecular}} mechanisms of local anaesthetic action on ion channels. The traditional {{view is that}} local anaesthetics eliminate action potentials by a direct block of Na channels. Other mechanisms, however, have been suggested. For instance bupivacaine has been proposed to affect Na channels in myelinated axons indirectly, by making the resting potential less <b>negative.</b> <b>To</b> <b>test</b> this hypothesis we analysed the effects of bupivacaine on voltage-clamped myelinated axons from Xenopus laevis. Contrary to the suggested hypothesis, the leak current and the resting potential were unaffected. Furthermore, the blocking effect on the K current was explained by two population-specific mechanisms. In order to gain further insights in the molecular mechanisms of local anaesthetic action, we analyzed the effects of bupivacaine {{on a series of}} voltage-gated K (Kv) channels and various mutant channels, expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Two phenomenologically different blocking effects were seen; a timedependent block of Kv 1 and Kv 3 channels, and a time independent block on Kv 2. 1. Swapping the S 6 helix between Kv 1. 2 and Kv 2. 1 introduced Kv 1. 2 features into Kv 2. 1. The results suggest that bupivacaine blocks Kv channels by an open-state dependent mechanism, and that Kv 2. 1 deviates from the other channels in allowing a partial closure of the bupivacaine-bound channel. The results also suggest that the binding site in Kv 2. 1 is located in the internal vestibule and that residues in the descending P-loop and the upper part of S 6 are critical for the binding. The location of the binding sites was further investigated by automated docking and molecular dynamics methods, using homology models of Kv 1. 5. Two different models were constructed to describe an open channel. They were based on the crystallized bacterial channels KcsA and MthK. The first model corresponds to a PVP-type of bending hinge in the internal helices, while the second corresponds to a Gly-type of bending hinge. The automated docking and molecular dynamics calculations combined with free energy estimations predicted strongest binding to the PVP region. Surprisingly, no binding was predicted for the Gly-bend model. The results support our electrophysiological data showing that Kv 1. 5 is unable to close when bupivacaine is bound to the channel. The standard view of local anaesthetic action assumes a preferential binding to channels in inactivated state. Recently, this view has been challenged. We investigated this issue by comparing the effects of bupivacaine on inactivating and non-inactivating Kv channels of similar subtypes, hypothesizing that the bupivacaine affinity is similar for the two types due to the structural similarities. The results can be explained by a simple kinetic scheme, deviating from the standard scheme in assuming local anaesthetic binding to channels exclusively in open state. By using data from Na channel experiments we could in simulations show that the basic scheme could be used to clarify controversial issues about local anaesthetic effects on Na channel inactivation...|$|E

40|$|Molecular chaperones are {{essential}} elements of the protein quality control machinery that governs translocation and folding of nascent polypeptides, refolding and degradation of misfolded proteins, and activation {{of a wide range}} of client proteins. The prokaryotic heat-shock protein DnaK is the E. coli representative of the ubiquitous Hsp 70 family, which specializes in the binding of exposed hydrophobic regions in unfolded polypeptides. Accurate prediction of DnaK binding sites in E. coli proteins is an essential prerequisite to understand the precise function of this chaperone and the properties of its substrate proteins. In order to map DnaK binding sites in protein sequences, we have developed an algorithm that combines sequence information from peptide binding experiments and structural parameters from homology modelling.

40|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that in the UK people of sub-Saharan African origin are disproportionately affected by HIV and tend to be diagnosed at a more advanced stage of infection compared to other ethnic groups.

The study had a quantitative, cross-sectional design. Participants completed a structured interview assessing demographic and HIV-testing related variables, including a measure designed specifically for the study to assess TPB variables. CD 4 cell count at diagnosis was taken from participants' medical notes. Twenty- five participants took part in the study. The power of the study was therefore too low <b>to</b> adequately <b>test</b> the hypotheses. Exploratory regression analyses were run.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Since {{treatment}} with biologics may reactivate latent TB, testing and prophylaxes before initiating therapy are mandatory. However, {{there is not}} a unique solution for the number and type of <b>tests</b> <b>to</b> be used for detecting the presence of TB, and for the definition of when prophylaxis should be prescribed. Which alternative should be preferred depends on the effectiveness of treatment and also on the cost associated. This methodological study aims to define a general economic model to assess different protocols for latent TB detection in patients undergoing anti-TNF treatment. METHODS: A decision tree approach has been designed for comparing alternative protocols in terms of (a) expected costs of different strategies for latent TB assessment in patients undergoing anti-TNF treatment; b) the economic convenience of the prophylaxis therapy in presence of a negative chest X-ray. Uncertainty is expressed by the probability of being positive and <b>negative</b> <b>to</b> the <b>tests.</b> In the NHS perspective the model considers: costs of tests; costs of TB onsets for rheumatologic patients who undergo biologics; costs of extending anti TB prophylaxis also <b>to</b> false <b>negative</b> patients; costs related to 1 -month biologic therapy delay because of prophylaxis; costs for adverse events therapy and/or test related. Indirect costs are also considered in the broader societal perspective. RESULTS: Costs assessed are useful to choose the less costly alternatives. The comparison also considers the reduction of false <b>negatives</b> <b>to</b> the <b>tests</b> which do not follow prophylaxis while being affected by latent TB. CONCLUSIONS: The model, that can represent a useful tool both for clinical and health policy decision making, is a general one; it can be applied to any country by inserting the country specific epidemiological, clinical, and economical data, and to any anti-TNF drug, by using the specific biologic drug-related risk factor...|$|R
