40|$|PURPOSE: To {{investigate}} whether {{the use of}} a disposable <b>needle</b> <b>guide</b> results in a decreased incidence of infectious complication after transrectal prostate needle biopsy (TPNB). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty five patients who underwent 10 -core TPNB were randomized into two groups. A pre-biopsy blood and urine examination was performed in both groups. Group 1 (25 patients) underwent biopsy with disposable biopsy <b>needle</b> <b>guide</b> and Group 2 (30 patients) underwent biopsy with reusable biopsy <b>needle</b> <b>guide.</b> All patients had a blood and negative urine culture before the procedure. The patients received ciprofloxacin 500 mg twice a day beginning the day before the biopsy and continued for 3 days after. Serum C-reactive protein levels and urine and blood specimens were obtained 48 h after the biopsy. Primary endpoint {{of the study was to}} determine the effect of <b>needle</b> <b>guide</b> on the bacteriologic urinary tract infection (UTI) rate and secondary end point was to determine symptomatic UTI. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 63. 46 (range 55 to 68) years. There were no significant differences regarding the prostate-specific antigen level, prostate size, existence of comorbidity in two groups before the procedure. Bacteriologic and symptomatic UTI was detected in 4 % vs. 6. 6 % and 4 % vs. 3. 9 % in Group 1 and 2 relatively (P > 0. 05). CONCLUSION: The use of a disposable <b>needle</b> <b>guide</b> does not appear to minimize infection risk after TPNB. Large scale and randomized studies are necessary to determine the effect of disposable <b>needle</b> <b>guide</b> on infection rate after TPNB...|$|E

40|$|Background: Ultrasound-guided {{paravertebral}} blocks during breast surgeries with in-plane needle approaches can {{be challenging}} due to difficult needle visualization. The {{purpose of this study}} was to assess the usefulness of using a <b>needle</b> <b>guide</b> while performing in-plane parasagittal approach paravertebral block for breast surgery. Patients and Methods: Eighty patients, American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I-III, aged 20 - 40 years with breast mass scheduled for simple mastectomy surgery, were involved in prospective, controlled, randomized study, and were randomly divided by closed envelope method into two groups: Group I (n = 40) : Scheduled for ultrasound-guided paravertebral block or group II (n = 40) : Scheduled for ultrasound-guided paravertebral block using the <b>needle</b> <b>guide.</b> Both techniques compared as regards: (i) Needle visibility and block performance time; (ii) number of needle passes; (iii) duration of the block; (iv) doctor and patient satisfaction; and (v) incidence of complications. Results: Needle visibility score was better in group II (2. 92 ± 0. 26 vs. 1. 9 ± 0. 44, P < 0. 0001). Block performance time was shorter in group II (90. 92 ± 15 vs. 128. 25 ± 16 s, P < 0. 0001). A number of needle passes were less in group II (1. 27 ± 0. 45 vs. 2. 2 ± 0. 68, P < 0. 0001). Doctor and patient satisfaction were better in group II (P = 0. 015). No differences were found regarding the duration of the block and incidence of complications between groups. Conclusion: A <b>needle</b> <b>guide</b> can help reduce the time needed to perform a parasagittal in-plane thoracic paravertebral block, with a significant reduction in the block performance time, the number of needle passes, better needle visibility and better doctor and patient′s satisfaction.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{assess the}} {{feasibility}} of using a remote-controlled, pneumatically actuated magnetic resonance (MR) -compatible robotic device to aid transrectal biopsy of the prostate performed with real-time 3 -T MR imaging guidance. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective study {{was approved by the}} ethics review board, and written informed consent was obtained from all patients. Twelve consecutive men who were clinically suspected of having prostate cancer and had a history of at least one transrectal ultrasonography (US) -guided prostate biopsy with negative results underwent diagnostic multiparametric MR imaging of the prostate. Two radiologists in consensus identified cancer-suspicious regions (CSRs) in 10 patients. These regions were subsequently targeted with the robot for MR imaging-guided prostate biopsy. To direct the <b>needle</b> <b>guide</b> toward the CSRs, the MR-compatible robotic device was remote controlled at the MR console by means of a controller and a graphical user interface for real-time MR imaging guidance of the <b>needle</b> <b>guide.</b> The ability to reach the CSRs with the robot for biopsy was analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 17 CSRs were detected in 10 patients at the diagnostic MR examinations. These regions were targeted for MR imaging-guided robot-assisted prostate biopsy. Thirteen (76 %) of the 17 CSRs could be reached with the robot for biopsy. Biopsy of the remaining four CSRs was performed without use of the robot. CONCLUSION: It is feasible to perform transrectal prostate biopsy with real-time 3 -T MR imaging guidance {{with the aid of a}} remote-controlled, pneumatically actuated MR-compatible robotic device...|$|E
40|$|Background Surgical {{simulation}} {{systems can}} be used to estimate soft tissue deformation during pre- and intra-operative planning. Such systems require a model that can accurately predict the deformation in real time. In this study, we present a back-propagation neural network for predicting three-dimensional (3 D) deformation of a phantom that incorporates the anatomy of the male pelvic region, i. e. the prostate and surrounding structures that support it. Method In the experiments and simulations, a <b>needle</b> <b>guide</b> is used to deform the rectal wall. The neural network predicts the deformation based on the relation between the undeformed and deformed shapes of the phantom. Training data are generated using a validated finite element (FE) model of the prostate and its surrounding structures. The FE model is developed from anatomically accurate magnetic resonance (MR) images. An ultrasound-based acoustic radiation force impulse imaging technique is used to measure in situ the shear wave velocity in soft tissue. The velocity is utilized to calculate the elasticities of the phantom. In the simulation study, the displacement and angle of the <b>needle</b> <b>guide</b> are varied. The neural network then predicts 3 D phantom deformation for a given input displacement. Results The results of the simulation study show that the maximum absolute linear and angular errors of the nodal displacement and orientation between neural network and FE predicted deformation are 0. 03 mm and 0. 01, respectively. Conclusions This study shows that a back-propagation neural network {{can be used to}} predict prostate deformation. Further, it is also demonstrated that a combination of ultrasound data, MR images and a neural network {{can be used as a}} framework for accurately predicting 3 D prostate deformation in real tim...|$|E

40|$|AbstractFailure {{of central}} vein {{cannulation}} may occur in {{as high as}} 10 % of cases using anatomical landmark (ALM) as guidance for the direction of needle puncture. In addition, significant time and patient discomfort may be required besides possibility of adverse complications such as hematoma, pneumothorax and arteriovenous fistula formation. Use of ultrasound-guided cannulation of central veins has been studied previously with good results by using dedicated ultrasound probes and needle holder/guides. We tested the results by using dedicated ultrasound probes without the needle holder/guide. Data were analyzed retrospectively over an 8 -month period, in attempt to compare, the ultrasound guidance without the <b>needle</b> <b>guide</b> method and the ALM guidance for the placement of central venous catheters in internal jugular and femoral veins. Central vein was located with a 7. 5 MHz transducer which is connected to a portable, battery powered, 2 -dimentional (2 D) echo device. There were total of 48 episodes of central venous cannulation (37 internal jugular and 11 femoral veins). Of these, 25 were done under ultrasound guidance. The number of skin punctures and passes under the skin were lower in the ultrasound-guided group. The vein was entered (passed) during the first attempt in 72 % of the ultrasound-guided group, as compared with only 26 % of the ALM group. The time needed was under 5 minutes in most ultrasound-guided cases. There were no immediate or late major complications in both groups. We conclude that ultrasound guidance without the need of the dedicated <b>needle</b> <b>guide</b> produces comparable results of fewer venous puncture attempts, increases success rate, and low complications rate.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{introduce}} a new in-house developed pneumatically controlled magnetic field compatible manipulator {{as an aid to}} perform magnetic resonance (MR) -guided biopsies of the prostate. METHODS: A pneumatic controlled manipulator with five degrees of freedom constructed of plastic to achieve magnetic field compatibility was developed to guide biopsies. A risk analysis, mechanical tests, and RF safety tests with respect to needle tip heating were performed to assure future patient safety and to meet standard safety requirements for the use in a medical environment. The accuracy of needle positioning with the <b>needle</b> <b>guide</b> manipulator to sample a predefined target was measured in agar phantoms on a 3 T whole body MR system. The in-plane error was used to evaluate the accuracy, which is defined as the orthogonal distance between target and biopsy needle. The time for each step in the biopsy procedure was recorded to evaluate the procedure time. The influence of the insertion angle with respect to the static field of the MR scanner on the needle artifact was investigated. RESULTS: The risk analyses met patient safety requirements. No RF induced local heating around the needle tip was observed. The average in-plane error in 19 measurements was 3. 0 mm (range 0 - 5. 6 mm). The average time needed for manipulation to place the <b>needle</b> <b>guide</b> in the desired position was 5 min (range 3 - 8 min). Total procedure time was 30 min. The needle artifact size increases with the insertion angle with respect to the static field of the MR scanner. CONCLUSIONS: The new MR compatible manipulator can be used safely for patient care. It showed a high accuracy and short total procedure time, demonstrating great potential to improve the transrectal prostate biopsy procedure...|$|E

40|$|Background—Image-guided robots are {{manipulators}} {{that operate}} based on medical images. Perhaps the most common class of image-guided robots are robots for needle interventions. Typically, these robots actively position and/or orient a <b>needle</b> <b>guide,</b> but needle insertion is still done by the physician.

40|$|BackgroundArteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) are {{recommended}} for hemodialysis access when possible. A noncannulatable but otherwise well functioning AVF leads to prolonged catheter dependency and frustration {{for the patient}} and the renal health care provider team. Difficult cannulation patients include obese individuals in whom cannulation sites are too deep, and others with vein segments that are short, tortuous, or otherwise difficult to palpate. The Venous Window <b>Needle</b> <b>Guide</b> for Salvage of AV Fistulae (SAVE) trial was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the Venous Window <b>Needle</b> <b>Guide</b> (VWING; Vital Access Corp, Salt Lake City, Utah) device for salvage of such noncannulatable AVFs that are otherwise functional. MethodsThe SAVE study included patients with an established and otherwise mature AVF, in whom an additional procedure would otherwise be necessary to establish reliable cannulation. The VWING is a single-piece titanium device that allows repeated access of an AVF through a single puncture site (buttonhole technique). Inclusion criteria included mature AVFs 6. 0 to 15. 0  mm in depth with multiple failed attempts at cannulation or where the access could not be palpated. The devices were implanted subcutaneously and sutured to the anterior wall of the mature fistula. Study end points were reliable and successful cannulation and avoidance of adverse events during the 6 -month follow-up, implant technical success, and clinical cannulation success. ResultsEnrollment included 54 patients at 11 trial sites with implantation of 82 VWING devices. Body mass index was 26 to 50 (median, 36), 40 (74 %) patients were female, and age was 17 to 84 (median, 59) years. Forty (74 %) individuals were diabetic. Thirty-three (61 %) patients were white, 16 (30 %) black, and 10 (18 %) patients were Hispanic, Pacific Islander, or Native American. Three patients were excluded from data analysis for reasons unrelated to the device. Successful AVF access was achieved using the VWING in 49 (96 %) of the 51 patients evaluated. The rate of device-related serious adverse events was 0. 31 per patient-year; each event was resolved leaving the AVF functional. The rates of sepsis and study-related interventions were 0. 04 and 0. 65 per patient-year, respectively. There were no study-related deaths. One device was removed because of infection. The AVF survival rate at 6  months was 100 %. The total number of study days was 9497 and the estimated number of device cannulations was  4238. ConclusionsThe VWING was safe and effective in facilitating AVF cannulation for patients with an otherwise mature but noncannulatable fistula.

40|$|OBJECTIVE—To {{develop a}} system that {{documents}} the location of transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS) -guided prostate biopsies by fusing them to MRI scans obtained prior to biopsy, as the actual location of prostate biopsies is rarely known. PATIENTS AND METHODS—Fifty patients (median age 61) with a median prostate-specific antigen (PSA) of 5. 8 ng/ml underwent 3 T endorectal coil MRI prior to biopsy. 3 D TRUS images were obtained just prior to standard TRUS-guided 12 -core sextant biopsies wherein an electromagnetic positioning device {{was attached to the}} <b>needle</b> <b>guide</b> and TRUS probe in order to track the position of each needle pass.

40|$|Purpose: To {{design a}} simple, {{cost-effective}} system for gaining rapid and accurate calyceal access during percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL). Materials and Methods: The design {{consists of a}} low-cost, light-weight, portable mechanical gantry with a <b>needle</b> <b>guiding</b> device. Using C-arm fluoroscopy, two images of the contrast-filled renal collecting system are obtained: at 0 -degrees (perpendicular to the kidney) and 20 -degrees. These images are relayed to a laptop computer containing the software and graphic user interface for selecting the targeted calyx. The software provides numerical settings for the 3 axes of the gantry, which are used to position the <b>needle</b> <b>guiding</b> device. The <b>needle</b> is advanced through the guide to the depth calculated by the software, thus puncturing the targeted calyx. Testing of the system was performed on 2 target types: 1) radiolucent plastic tubes the approximate size of a renal calyx (5 or 10 mm in diameter, 30 mm in length); and 2) foam-occluded, contrast-filled porcine kidneys. Results: Tests using target type 1 with 10 mm diameter (n = 14) and 5 mm diameter (n = 7) tubes resulted in a 100 % targeting success rate, with a mean procedure duration of 10 minutes. Tests using target type 2 (n = 2) were both successful, with accurate puncturing of the selected renal calyx, and a mean procedure duration of 15 minutes.

40|$|A pose {{estimation}} method is proposed {{for measuring the}} position and orientation of a biopsy needle. The technique {{is to be used}} as a touchless <b>needle</b> <b>guide</b> system for guidance of percutaneous procedures with 4 D ultrasound. A pair of uncalibrated, light-weight USB cameras are used as inputs. A database is prepared offline, using both the needle line estimated from camera-captured images and the true needle line recorded from an independent tracking device. A nonparametric learning algorithm determines the best fit model from the database. This model can then be used in real-time to estimate the true position of the needle with inputs from only the camera images. Simulation results confirm the feasibility of the method and show how a small, accurately made database can provide satisfactory results. In a series of tests with cameras, we achieved an average error of 2. 4 mm in position and 2. 61 ° in orientation. The system is also extended to real ultrasound imaging, as the two miniature cameras capture images of the needle in air and the ultrasound system captures a volume as the needle moves through the workspace. A new database is created with the estimated 3 D position of the needle from the ultrasound volume and the 2 D position and orientation of the needle calculated from the camera images.

We report the predicted and true success rates, compare the yield of blind to ultrasound <b>guided</b> <b>needle</b> biopsies and evaluate the failure rate over time. Results: Two operators performed 96 blind needle autopsies and 95 ultrasound <b>guided</b> <b>needle</b> autopsies. For blind needle biopsies true success rates varied from 56 - 99 % and predicted success rates from 89 - 99 %. For ultrasound <b>guided</b> <b>needle</b> biopsies true success rates varied from 72 - 100 % and predicted success rates from 84 - 98 %...|$|R
40|$|A {{preoperative}} tumor guiding {{system for}} nonpalpable breast cancer using a VATS <b>guiding</b> <b>needle</b> (Hakko Co., Ltd., Tokyo Japan) was reported. It {{was easy to}} introduce the <b>guiding</b> <b>needle</b> into breast cancers smaller than 1 cm under ultrasonographic observation. Neither bleeding nor infection was experienced. Wound management was easy and painless. This guiding system is very useful for locating and managing nonpalpable breast cancers even in outpatient settings...|$|R
40|$|This {{retrospective}} {{quality control}} study aimed at comparing resolution in patients treated with intravitreal ocriplasmin (IVO) using two injection techniques, classical injection procedure (unguided) and targeted injection using a surgical microscope with a 30 -gauge 1 -inch <b>needle</b> (<b>guided)</b> {{for the treatment}} of focal VMT without macular hole. The two groups presented a statistically significant difference in terms of resolution of VMT within the first month following treatment: 1 / 7 for the unguided group versus 6 / 7 for the guided group (p= 0. 0291). The majority of the guided group presented an earlier resolution than the single resolved case in the unguided group. The results of this preliminary study indicate that the injection of ocriplasmin closer to the site of VMT results in the resolution in a higher number of cases and that this resolution occurs in a short time interval...|$|R
