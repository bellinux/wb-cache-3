It {{caused him to}} avoid {{appearing}} at court for some months and to estrange himself from his father, who favoured John's younger brother, Manuel, Count of Ourém. During this time, much gossip was spread and worries arose about whether John would ever recover from his depression.

25|$|The {{practice}} of docking {{has been around}} for centuries, and is older than the Doberman as a breed. The putative reason for docking is to ensure that the tail does <b>not</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> the way of the dog's work. Docking has always been controversial. The American Kennel Club standard for Doberman Pinschers includes a tail docked near the 2nd vertebra. Docking is a common practice in the United States, Russia and Japan (as {{well as a number of}} other countries with Doberman populations), where it is legal. In many European countries and Australia, docking has been made illegal, and in others it is limited.|$|E

His cycling career was interrupted by military service: he did <b>not</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> the Sports Club of the army and was sent to the border troops.

Forty cows had a locomotion score (LCS) of 2 or 3 for more than 2 times during the prebreeding period. Nineteen of these cows did <b>not</b> <b>get</b> pregnant <b>in</b> the breeding season.

25|$|Bas started {{training}} boxing in {{the backyard}} of an elementary school with a friend. Rutten became interested in martial arts at age 12 after his family went on vacation to France, where the movie Enter the Dragon starring Bruce Lee was playing at a local movie theatre. Bas could <b>not</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> because the movie was rated 17+, so {{he and his brother}} Sjoerd snuck into the theatre. After he saw the movie, he took an interest in martial arts. At first, his conservative parents didn't allow him to pursue, but after two years of begging his parents, at age 14, they allowed him to practice taekwondo. He picked it up very quickly and after a few months he got in a street fight with the biggest bully in town. Rutten, now more confident, took the challenge and broke the bully's nose and KO'd him with the first punch he threw. The police showed up at his parent's place, and Rutten was immediately prohibited by his parents from further practicing martial arts.|$|E
25|$|Montag awakens ill {{the next}} morning, with Mildred nagging {{him to get}} up and go to work. As Mildred tries to care for her husband (but finds herself more {{involved}} in the parlor wall entertainment in the next room), Montag suggests that maybe he should take a break from being a fireman after what happened last night. Mildred panics over the thought of losing the house and her parlor wall family and angrily blames the old woman who killed herself over her books for Montag's change of heart over his job. Captain Beatty, Montag's fire chief, personally visits Montag to see how he is doing. Sensing Montag's concerns, Beatty recounts how books lost their value and where the firemen fit in: over the course of several decades, people embraced new media (in this case, film and television), sports, and a quickening pace of life. Books were ruthlessly abridged or degraded to accommodate a short attention span while minority groups protested over the controversial, outdated content perceived to be found in literature (yet comic books, trade papers, and sex magazines were allowed to stay, as those fed into the population's want for mindless entertainment). The government took advantage of this by turning the firemen into officers of people's peace of mind. Beatty adds casually that all firemen eventually steal a book out of curiosity; if the book is burned within 24 hours, the fireman and his family will <b>not</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> trouble.|$|E
25|$|The {{second half}} {{started with the}} Badgers marching 83 yards on the Gophers and scoring on a 2-yard {{touchdown}} pass to WR Jared Abbrederis from Joel Stave. On the Gophers first play of the second half, RB David Cobb would stripped by Chris Borland and Borland would also recover the fumble. The Badgers had the ball at the Golden Gophers 26-yard line but could <b>not</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> the end zone. They tried a 38-yard field goal but missed. Minnesota would punt after unable {{to pick up a}} first down. The Badgers took over with very good field possession but would also punt the ball back to Minnesota. The Gophers picked up one first down but the Badgers defense again held firm and forced a punt that was returned by Jared Abbrederis down to the Gophers 33-yard line as the third quarter came to a close. Three straight incompletions by the Badgers would set up a fourth down where the Badgers tried a trick punt play that failed. A big 31-yard completion by the Gophers on their drive put them inside the Badgers 40-yard line. They could not pickup another first down and the Badgers defense held on a fourth down try by the Gophers. The Badgers would punt after three running plays. Minnesota would drive into the Badgers red zone but only to again be forced to turn the ball over on downs. The Badgers were then able to run out the final four minutes and 52 seconds and win their 10th in a row versus the Golden Gophers, 20–7.|$|E

25|$|In {{the film}} X-Men, Magneto is a {{powerful}} mutant whose abilities have become near limitless. He is the main antagonist of the film. But the existence of mutants have become public {{and the subject of}} a fierce debate over whether or not to be granted the same rights as others humans or whether they should be separated all together. The US Senate is debating a Mutant Registration Act to force all mutants to reveal themselves and be registered, a move sponsored by Senator Robert Kelly. Magneto is present the day when attempts to convince the Senate to vote against mutant registration but is shouted down by Senator Kelly. When confronted by his old friend, Charles Xavier, he tells him that he had seen and heard the same speeches before, when the Nazis had cried out against Jews. He then asks that Xavier does <b>not</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> his way as he tries to ensure mutant supremacy. Magneto attempts to mutate the world leaders with a high-tech machine powered by his own magnetic energy installed on the Statue of Liberty's torch. As the machine is potentially lethal, he kidnaps Rogue to use as the power source instead. Unknown to Magneto, the machine would cause humans to be killed by losing their molecular structure (as seen in Senator Kelly). Even when warned of the dangers of the machine by Jean Grey and Storm, Magneto does not believe them nor does he care. In the end, while Wolverine attacks Magneto atop the torch Cyclops uses an optic blast to knock down Magneto and destroy the machine. Magneto ends locked up in a plastic prison.|$|E

Burton thought the paternal character would help explain Willy Wonka himself and that otherwise {{he would be}} [...] "just a weird guy". The element of an estranged father-son relationship had previously appeared in Big Fish, similarly directed by Burton and written by August. Warner Bros. and the director held differences over the characterizations of Charlie Bucket and Willy Wonka. The studio wanted to entirely delete Mr. Bucket and make Willy Wonka the idyllic father figure Charlie had longed for his entire life. Burton believed that Wonka {{would not be a}} good father, finding the character similar to a recluse. Burton said, [...] "In some ways, he's more screwed up than the kids." [...] Warner Bros. also wanted Charlie to be a , but Burton resisted the characterization. He wanted Charlie to be an average child who would be in the background and <b>not</b> <b>get</b> <b>in</b> trouble.|$|E
