30|$|Despite {{particular}} concern, {{the availability}} of information regarding developmental neurotoxicity of chemicals is very limited, even for humans. In a systematic literature review considering the neurotoxic potential of industrial chemicals to human populations, Grandjean and Landrigan identified 201 proven human <b>neurotoxicants</b> [34] and, moreover, they estimate that there are over 1000 compounds which were neurotoxic in laboratory animals, respectively [21]. Five of the 201 chemicals identified as human <b>neurotoxicants</b> were also classified as developmental <b>neurotoxicants,</b> while the other compounds could not be classified {{due to lack of}} experimental data [34]. Such low numbers demonstrate a clear lack of developmental neurotoxicity assessment studies. Additionally, a 2009 report indicated that only around 110 chemicals had been tested for potential human developmental neurotoxicity following respective OECD or US-EPA guidelines [35, 36]. As a consequence, there is a demand for time and cost-efficient testing methods capable of evaluating large numbers of chemicals for developmental neurotoxicity. Such methods may include in vitro and in silico tools as well as in vivo studies with alternative model species such as zebrafish (Danio rerio) [36]. Based on the 2009 reports [35, 36], an international collaboration was started led by Prof. E. Fritsche (IUF) with the goal to assemble a developmental neurotoxicity (DNT) testing battery for regulatory purposes. The in vitro testing battery will cover a variety of neurodevelopmental key events, distinct brain cell types and will investigate over 100 potential developmental <b>neurotoxicants</b> [37].|$|R
40|$|Many {{structurally}} diverse chemicals (e. g., acrylamide, 2, 4 -dithiobiuret, methylmercury) are electrophiles {{and cause}} synaptic dysfunction by unknown mechanisms. The {{purpose of this}} Forum review is to discuss the possibility that highly nucleophilic cysteine thiolate groups within catalytic triads of synaptic proteins represent specific and necessary targets for electrophilic <b>neurotoxicants.</b> Most of these toxicants are electrophiles and share the ability to adduct or otherwise modify nucleophilic sulfhydryl groups. It is also now recognized that synaptic activity is regulated by the redox-state of certain cysteine sulfhydryl groups on proteins. Electrophilic <b>neurotoxicants</b> might, therefore, produce synaptic toxicity by modifying these thiols. However, because most proteins contain cysteine residues, target specificity {{is an issue that}} significantly detracts from the mechanistic validity of this hypothesis. Recent research indicates that these thiolates are receptors for the endogenous nitric oxide (NO) pathway and that subsequent reversible S-nitrosylation finely regulates a broad spectrum of synaptic activities. We hypothesize that electrophilic <b>neurotoxicants</b> selectively adduct/derivatize NO receptor thiolates in catalytic triads and that the resulting loss of fine gain control impairs neurotransmission and produces neurotoxicity.

Recommended in vitro tests require validation. As the White Paper (EC, 2001) requires neurotoxic data, this study evaluated an in vitro testing strategy for predicting in vivo neurotoxicity. The sensitivities of diVerentiated PC 12 cells and primary cerebellum granule cells (CGC) were compared to undiVerentiated PC 12 cells which can indicate basal cytotoxicity. Cytotoxicants and <b>neurotoxicants</b> selected for testing covered a range of mechanisms and potencies. <b>Neurotoxicants</b> were not distinguished from cytotoxicants despite signiWcantly diVerent cell system responses using all endpoints; cell viability/activity, ATP depletion, MMP depolarisation, ROS production and cytoskeleton modiWcations.

Acute oral rodent LD 50 values correlated with cytotoxicity IC 50 values for the respective chemicals tested in each cell system.

Here, the gene expression at the mRNA level was evaluated to determine whether this could be a suitable endpoint to detect potential developmental <b>neurotoxicants.</b> Primary cultures of rat cerebellar granule cells (CGCs) were exposed to well known (developmental) <b>neurotoxicants</b> (methyl mercury chloride, lead chloride, valproic acid and tri-methyl tin chloride) for different time periods.

Moreover, a significant increase of the neural precursor marker nestin mRNA was also observed. The mRNA expression of the astrocytic markers (GFAP and S 100 ß) was unchanged.
