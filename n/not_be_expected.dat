5|$|Additionally, John Maynard Smith, a noted {{biologist}} with {{a strong}} background in aeronautics, {{has pointed out that}} bumblebees would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>expected</b> to sustain flight, as they would need to generate too much power given their tiny wing area. However, in aerodynamics experiments with other insects, he found that viscosity at the scale of small insects meant even their small wings can move a very large volume of air relative to their size, and this reduces the power required to sustain flight by an order of magnitude.|$|E
5|$|The {{fact that}} a person prepares a weapon in order to defend {{themselves}} against expected attack does not preclude the defense from being legitimate and, according to courts, it may <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>expected</b> from a defender to wait and rely on chance that a damage which is, both objectively and in the defender's subjective understanding, threatened to happen, will not take place. The defender may use proportionate accessible means {{in order to prevent}} an imminent attack and disarm the attacker.|$|E
5|$|First, Plantinga {{pointed out}} that God, though omnipotent, could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>expected</b> to do {{literally}} anything. God could not, for example, create square circles, act contrary to his nature, or, more relevantly, create beings with free will that would never choose evil. Taking this latter point further, Plantinga argued that the moral value of human free will is a credible offsetting justification that God could have as a morally justified reason for permitting the existence of evil. Plantinga did not claim to {{have shown that the}} conclusion of the logical problem is wrong, nor did he assert that God's reason for allowing evil is, in fact, to preserve free will. Instead, his argument sought only to show that the logical problem of evil was unsound.|$|E

5|$|In {{some cases}} the signal {{receiver}} is lured toward the mimic. This involves mimicry of a resource that is often vital to the prey's survival (or more precisely, the survival of its genes) such as nutrition or a mate. If the bait offered is of little value to prey they would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>expected</b> to take such a risk. For example, in all known cases of sexual signal mimicry it is always the male sex that is deceived (in fact, {{it has been suggested}} that females of some species have evolved mimicry as a strategy to avoid unwanted matings). In these cases the predator need not move about foraging for prey, but may simply stay still and allow prey to come to it.|$|E
5|$|Securing an {{airstrip}} {{would be}} an important objective for the invader. Airfields, considered extremely vulnerable, were protected by trench works and pillboxes which faced inwards towards the runway, rather than outwards. Many of these fortifications were specified by the Air Ministry and defensive designs were unique to airfields—these would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>expected</b> to face heavy weapons so the degree of protection was less {{and there was more}} emphasis on all-round visibility and sweeping fields of fire. It was difficult to defend large open areas without creating impediments to the movement of friendly aircraft. Solutions to this problem included the pop-up Picket Hamilton fort—a light pillbox that could be lowered to ground level when the airfield was in use.|$|E
5|$|The Champs-Élysées in 1855 {{were not}} yet the grand avenue laid out by Baron Haussmann in the 1860s, but an unpaved allée. The public who were {{flocking}} to Offenbach's theatre {{in the summer and}} autumn of 1855 could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>expected</b> to venture there in the depths of a Parisian winter. He cast about for a suitable venue and found the Théâtre des Jeunes Élèves, known also as the Salle Choiseul or Théâtre Comte, in central Paris. He entered into partnership with its proprietor and moved the Bouffes-Parisiens there for the winter season. The company returned to the Salle Lacaze for the 1856, 1857, and 1859 summer seasons, performing at the Salle Choiseul in the winter. Legislation enacted in March 1861 prevented the company from using both theatres, and appearances at the Salle Lacaze were discontinued.|$|E

5|$|The early Earth {{during the}} Hadean eon is {{believed}} by most scientists {{to have had}} a Venus-like atmosphere, with roughly 100 bar of CO2 and a surface temperature of 230°C, and possibly even sulfuric acid clouds, until about 4.0billion years ago, by which time plate tectonics were in full force and together with the early water oceans, removed the CO2 and sulfur from the atmosphere. Early Venus would thus most likely have had water oceans like the Earth, but any plate tectonics would have ended when Venus lost its oceans. Its surface is estimated to be about 500million years old, so it would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>expected</b> to show evidence of plate tectonics.|$|E
5|$|During William's absence {{a crisis}} had {{developed}} in Jerusalem. King Baldwin {{had reached the}} age of majority in 1176 and Raymond III had been removed from the regency, but as a leper Baldwin could have no children and could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>expected</b> to rule much longer. After the death of William of Montferrat in 1177, King Baldwin's widowed sister Sibylla required a new husband. At Easter in 1180, the two factions were divided even further when Raymond and his cousin Bohemond III of Antioch attempted to force Sibylla to marry Baldwin of Ibelin. Raymond and Bohemond were King Baldwin's nearest male relatives in the paternal line, and could have claimed the throne if the king died without an heir or a suitable replacement. Before Raymond and Bohemond arrived, however, Agnes and King Baldwin arranged for Sibylla to be married to a Poitevin newcomer, Guy of Lusignan, whose older brother Aimery of Lusignan was already an established figure at court.|$|E
5|$|Subsequent to its {{discovery}} at the Mikea Forest, Petter's big-footed mouse {{was also}} found as a subfossil in cave deposits at Andrahomana in far southeastern Madagascar, a find reported in 2006. There, it was found together with more abundant remains of the introduced black rat and house mouse (Mus musculus), as well as indigenous rodents such as the bastard big-footed mouse. Two Petter's big-footed mouse bones were radiocarbon dated to 790–410BCE and 150–390CE, respectively, a period when the local climate became drier and humans first appeared. Macrotarsomys species are thought to burrow in sandy ground and would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>expected</b> to enter caves; therefore, the subfossils are probably remains of animals eaten by birds of prey. Although Petter's big-footed mouse could conceivably persist in remnant pockets of wet habitat in southeastern Madagascar, searches at two sites near Andrahomana failed to confirm its presence. It may have become locally extinct in the area because of the drying climate and competition with the black rat.|$|E

25|$|The Battlefield Boundary ends {{where the}} {{opposing}} forces disengaged and withdrew. Reasons for disengagement might include darkness or adverse weather conditions, {{pursuit of a}} retreating force being halted by a rear guard action, orders to disengage being received, or one force accomplishing its objective and choosing not to pursue its retreating foe. Withdrawal routes end where, logically, the combatants would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>expected</b> to turn back and continue engaging in battle.|$|E

25|$|There {{were also}} designs for pillbox-like {{structures}} for various purposes including light anti-aircraft positions, observation posts and searchlight positions {{to illuminate the}} shoreline. In addition, the Air Ministry provided designs of fortifications intended to protect airfields from troops landing or parachuting. These would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>expected</b> to face heavy weapons so {{that the degree of}} protection was less and there was more emphasis on all-round visibility and sweeping fields of fire. Many of these were later reinforced.|$|E
25|$|Pyrazinamide {{was first}} {{discovered}} and patented in 1936 but not used against tuberculosis until 1952. Its discovery as an anti-tubercular agent was remarkable {{since it has}} no activity against tuberculosis in-vitro, due to not being active at a neutral pH, so would ordinarily <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>expected</b> to work in-vivo. However, it was known that nicotinamide had activity against tuberculosis and pyrazinamide was thought to have a similar effect. Experiments in mice at Lederle and Merck confirmed its ability to kill tuberculosis and it was rapidly used in humans.|$|E
25|$|During {{one of the}} Congressional {{hearings}} {{addressing the}} proposed changes in 1995, William A. Niskanen, chair of the Cato Institute, criticized both the 1993 and 1994 sets of proposals for political favoritism in allocating credit, for micromanagement by regulators and {{for the lack of}} assurances that banks would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>expected</b> to operate at a loss to achieve CRA compliance. He predicted the proposed changes would be very costly to the economy and the banking system in general. Niskanen believed that the primary long-term effect would be an artificial contraction of the banking system. Niskanen recommended Congress repeal the Act.|$|E
