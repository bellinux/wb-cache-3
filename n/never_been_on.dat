5|$|Early in this film, Denham {{shoots a}} scene for his film in which Ann, in-character, proclaims she's <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>on</b> a ship before, and Bruce Baxter improvises lines proclaiming annoyance. The {{dialogue}} they exchange is taken verbatim from early scenes between Ann and Jack Driscoll in the 1933 film. Ironically, in this film, Jack Driscoll expresses disapproval of such words toward Ann.|$|E

5|$|It {{keeps its}} {{distance}} from mass media and avoids publishing details about its activities and membership. The group also exercises complete abstinence from expressing opinions on political and controversial issues mainly {{to avoid the}} disputes which would accompany these endorsements. As an organisation, Tabligh Jamaat does not seek donations and is not funded by anyone, in fact members have to bear their own expenditures. Since there is no formal registration process and no official membership count has ever been taken, the exact membership statistics remain unknown. The movement discourages interviews with its elders and has never officially released texts, although there are publications associated with the movement (usually referred as TablighiNisaab (Tablighi Curriculum). The emphasis has <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>on</b> book learning, but rather on first-hand personal communication.|$|E
5|$|Olympic {{sports are}} governed by {{international}} sports federations (IFs) recognised by the IOC as the global supervisors of those sports. There are 35 federations represented at the IOC. There are sports recognised by the IOC that are not included on the Olympic program. These sports are not considered Olympic sports, {{but they can be}} promoted to this status during a programme revision that occurs in the first IOC session following a celebration of the Olympic Games. During such revisions, sports can be excluded or included in the programme {{on the basis of a}} two-thirds majority vote of the members of the IOC. There are recognised sports that have <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>on</b> an Olympic programme in any capacity, including chess and surfing.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, Sacred Spain: Art and Belief in the Spanish World brought {{together}} 71 {{works of art}} {{from a wide variety}} of lenders, including Peru, Mexico, and the Prado in Spain. The exhibit was composed of a rare collection of pieces, many of which had <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>on</b> view in the United States. It featured paintings, sculpture, metalwork, and books by artists such as El Greco, Diego Velázquez, and Bartolomé Esteban Murillo. Andy Warhol Enterprises was displayed at the IMA from October, 2010 to January, 2011 and featured more than 150 works of art by Andy Warhol, as well as archival materials. The exhibition was the largest to illustrate Warhol's fascination with money and feature consumerism as a central theme. Visitors were able to view the progression of Warhol's career, from his beginnings as a commercial artist to his multimillion-dollar empire.|$|E

Along with the animals, 90% of which had <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>on</b> display at the zoo, there are over 250 species of plants represented in the exhibit.|$|E
25|$|Haig thought Robertson (who {{had begun}} his {{military}} {{career as a}} private) egotistical and not “a gentleman” and was unhappy at the way Robertson had allowed divisions to be diverted to other fronts, {{even though he had}} in fact fought to keep such diversions to a minimum. Although Haig had been suspicious of Henry Wilson, they gradually established a warily respectful relationship, and interactions were socially more smooth than they had been with Robertson, with whom Haig had <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>on</b> first-name terms. Haig noted (diary 25 February) that as CIGS Wilson was no longer keen on diverting efforts to other fronts, nor on Rawlinson building up a strong staff at Versailles. Haig's callousness towards Robertson and Derby, his equals, has been compared unfavourably to the care with which he tried to protect the interests of his subordinates Charteris and Kiggell.|$|E

25|$|After the war, Knežević {{remained}} in exile and was tried in absentia alongside others. He {{was found guilty}} of treason and war crimes and sentenced to 10 years imprisonment with hard labour, loss of political and civic rights for 5 years, confiscation of all property, and loss of citizenship. The sentence of imprisonment with hard labour was to commence from the date of his future arrest. He emigrated to Canada where he was the editor of Glas kanadskih Srba (Voice of the Canadian Serbs). In the early 1950s, an acrimonious dispute arose between Cvetković and Knežević. Knežević wrote an article in the international relations journal International Affairs claiming that Prince Paul and Cvetković had formulated a secret plan to ally Yugoslavia with Germany and to gain control of the port of Salonika while Greece was defending against the Italian invasion. While Cvetković issued two strong denials in the historical journal Dokumenti o Jugoslaviji, and stated that seizing Salonika had <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>on</b> the agenda of the Yugoslav government, his latter statement was not true. The main purpose of Knežević's allegation was to discredit Prince Paul and portray the coup plotters in a favourable light. Knežević died in Toronto on 22 June 1983.|$|E

[...] Even though there are publications associated with the movement, particularly by Zakariya Kandahalwi, the emphasis has <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>on</b> book learning, but rather on first-hand personal communication. A collection of books, usually referred as TablighiNisaab (Tablighi Curriculum), is recommended by Tabligh Jamaat elders for general reading. This set includes four books namely (Hayatus Sahabah, Fazail-e-Amaal, Fazail-e-Sadqaat and Muntakhab Ahadith).|$|E

500|$|Elle's first chronological {{appearance}} is in [...] "Four Months Ago...". During this time, the Company made Peter Petrelli their willing prisoner {{and in those}} months he was held, Elle seems to have developed a cute crush on him. Peter confesses that he likes the little jolts which Elle gives him as a tease and kisses her. She confides in Peter that she {{has lived in the}} Company's holding facility for 16 years. She also admits to being diagnosed as a sociopath; she explains at age six, she accidentally set her grandmother's house on fire and, at age eight, caused a major blackout in Ohio. She also says that she spent her ninth birthday in a glass room with an IV of lithium in her arm. She also explains that she has <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>on</b> a date and has never been swimming. When he escapes from the facility, Elle is upset and angry to the point that she blasts Peter, setting him ablaze during his escape. She then chases after Adam Monroe while the Haitian goes after Peter.|$|E
500|$|The {{tradition}} of the captain first hoisting the Cup has been [...] "breached" [...] a few times. In 1993 after the Montreal Canadiens defeated the Los Angeles Kings, Guy Carbonneau handed the Cup to Denis Savard, as Savard had been the player that many fans had urged the Canadiens to draft back in 1980. Another notable exception was in 1998, after the Detroit Red Wings had defeated the Washington Capitals, when Steve Yzerman immediately passed the Cup to Vladimir Konstantinov, whose career with the Red Wings ended due to serious injuries in a traffic accident the previous year {{and had to be}} wheeled on the ice. The third was involving Joe Sakic and Ray Bourque when the Colorado Avalanche won the Cup in 2001, as the seventh and deciding game of the Finals would be the last of Bourque's 22-year NHL career, having <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>on</b> a Cup-winning team until that time (Bourque had, until being traded to the Avalanche on March 6, 2000, only ever played for the Boston Bruins). When Sakic received the trophy, he did not hoist it, but instead immediately handed it to Bourque; Sakic then became the second player on the team to hoist the trophy.|$|E
500|$|Three {{months prior}} to the start of production, the actors {{gathered}} at Atlanta’s Skatetown to begin training for the skating sequences in the film. Some had <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>on</b> roller skates before. Vaughn Newton, the actors' skate captain, worked with them rigorously, usually practicing five hours a day. “Lauren and the twins, Malika and Khadijah, adapted very quickly," [...] said Newton. [...] "The guys came along a little slower. Al Be, Jason and Jackie Long developed very fast. T.I. was determined to learn. They were all great students and very supportive of each other.” In addition to the main cast, Robinson decided to include numerous cameos in the film, generally involving people popular in the Atlanta music scene, a core element of the movie. Music producer Jazze Pha played the skating rink's DJ; Rico Wade, a part of the Atlanta-based production team Organized Noize, who also frequented Jellybeans in the early '90s, made an appearance as well. R singer Monica, a protégé of producer Austin's, also plays a Waffle House waitress in the film. A few of the south's most sought after music video models made appearances as well including 'Whyte Chocolate' also known as Monique Harris-Ford. There are also cameos from rappers Bone Crusher, Konkrete, and Killer Mike.|$|E

500|$|On September 13, 2013, Anderson {{agreed to}} terms {{to return to}} the Mill Rats for the 2013–14 season. He hoped to carry his team to the {{championship}} with new head coach Rob Spon. Spon commented, [...] "I've finally got my wish to coach [...] come true. Instead of watching him torch me, I get to help him unleash his potential on other teams." [...] In his season debut on November 1, 2013, Anderson scored 23 points in a road win over the Halifax Rainmen. In a loss to the Moncton Miracles two games later on November 9, he added 28 points and seven assists. On November 24, Anderson recorded his first double-double of the season vs. the Miracles, with 22 points and 13 rebounds. Anderson had a 34-point performance in another rematch with Moncton on December 12, 2013. In late December, he scored over 30 points in back-to-back games against the Rainmen. Entering January 1, 2014, Anderson led the Mill Rats in scoring and stood 0.15 points per game behind Stefan Bonneau for being the top scorer in the NBL Canada. On January 16 and 17, he scored 37 and 39 points respectively against the Island Storm. On January 24, Anderson scored a season-high 40 points and recorded nine assists in another contest vs. the Storm. Despite holding an early lead, the Mill Rats were eventually defeated by the Island. In early February 2014, Anderson scored over 30 points in consecutive games against the Mississauga Power and the Brampton A's of the Central Division. He tied his season-best of 40 points in a victory over the Rainmen on February 23, with a season-high of seven three-pointers. Anderson scored 19 points in the third quarter and scored 15 straight at one point as well. In early April, he was named to the 2014 NBL Canada All-Star Game. Anderson helped the Atlantic Division capture the win, contributing 21 points, 12 assists, and nine rebounds. On April 19, 2014, Anderson won the Most Valuable Player award. He finished the season as the league's all-time leading scorer, with 2,121 points. Anderson later reflected on the year, saying, [...] "I have <b>never</b> <b>been</b> <b>on</b> a team that was so together from the coach {{all the way down to}} the last guy... it was a family for real." ...|$|E
