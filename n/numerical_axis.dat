40|$|Some {{aspects of}} the {{development}} of physics and the mathematics set one think about relation between complex numbers and reality around us. If number to spot as the relation of two quantities, from the fact of existence of complex numbers and accepted definition of number it is necessary necessity complex value to assign to all physical quantities. The basic property of quantity to be it is more or less, therefore field of complex quantities, if it exists, it is necessary is ranked. The hypothesis was proposed that lexicographic ordering may be applied to the complex physical quantities. A set of the ranked complex numbers is quite natural to arrange on a straight line that represents in this case a non-Archimedean complex <b>numerical</b> <b>axis.</b> All physical quantities are located on the relevant non-Archimedean complex numerical axes, forming a new reality - "complex-valued" world. Thus, we get the conclusion that the resulting non-Archimedean complex <b>numerical</b> <b>axis</b> may serve {{as an example of the}} ideal mathematical object - hyperreal <b>numerical</b> <b>axis.</b> So, differentiation and integration on the non-Archimedean complex <b>numerical</b> <b>axis</b> can be realized using methods of nonstandard analysis. Certain properties of a new "complex-valued" reality, its connection with our "real" world and possibility of experimental detection of complex physical quantities are discussed.

40|$|The article {{considers}} a mixed problem with homogeneous boundary conditions for onedimensional homogeneous wave equation. Such a problem can arise, for example, when studying oscillations {{of current and}} voltage in the conductor through which electric current flows, while the line is free from distortion. The solution can be found {{with the use of}} the Fourier method in the form of trigonometric series. This representation is of purely theoretical interest, because the real calculation should be, first, to find a large number of coefficients of the integrals, which in itself is not a trivial task and, second, it is almost impossible to assess the error of the calculations. An alternative way of solving this problem based on the use of transcendental functions i. e. polylogarithms that represent complex power series of a special kind. The exact solution of the problem is expressed through the imaginary part of a polylogarithm of the first order on the single circle and the approximate one – via the real part of the dilogarithm. In addition, if the initial conditions in the problem are elementary functions, then the solution is also computed using elementary functions. A simple and effective error estimate of the approximate solution has been found. It does not depend on time and it has the first-order of accuracy regarding the step of a partitioning segment of the <b>numerical</b> <b>axis</b> on which the problem is considered. This valuation is uniform with respect to the variables of the problem – both spatial and temporal.  </p...|$|E

40|$|Summary. The {{temperature}} distribution beneath an ocean ridge with a magma chamber solidifying {{to form the}} crustal layer 3 has been investigated by numerical methods. Assuming that water circulation rapidly cools layer 2 but does not penetrate deeper, {{it is found that}} a magma chamber forms pro-vided that the half spreading rate exceeds about 0. 45 cm y- '; for slower rates instantaneous dyke-like solidification occurs down to the Moho beneath the ridge <b>axis.</b> <b>Numerical</b> models show that the width of the magma chamber and the thickness of the dyke complex depend on half-spreading rate. The width is about 20 km for 3 cm y-'. If there is significant crystal settling to form cumulates, the chamber width is much reduced. The resulting heat flow pattern is as follows: an outer zone where latent heat effects are negli-gible; a middle zone about twice as wide as the magma chamber where latent heat significantly contributes to the heat loss; a narrow axial zone where quenching of magma to form layer 2 provides the main heat loss.

40|$|It {{is known}} that, in a linear shear flow, fluid inertia causes a {{particle}} to spin {{more slowly than}} the surrounding fluid. The present experiments performed with a sphere with fixed centre, but free to rotate in a fluid undergoing solid-body rotation around a horizontal axis indicate that the spin rate of the sphere can be larger {{than that of the}} flow when the sphere is sufficiently far from the <b>axis.</b> <b>Numerical</b> simulations at Reynolds number 5 ≤Re≤ 200 confirm this observation. To {{gain a better understanding of}} the phenomenon, the rotating flow is decomposed into two shear flows along orthogonal directions. It is found numerically that the cross-stream shear has a much stronger effect on the particle spin rate than the streamwise shear. The region of low stress at the back of the sphere is affected by the shear component of the incident flow. While for the streamwise case the shift is minor, it is significant for cross-stream shear. The results are interpreted on the basis of the effect of the shear flow components on the quasi-toroidal vortex attached in the sphere's near wake.

40|$|Abstract. Tetration F as the {{analytic}} solution of equations F (z − 1) = ln(F (z)), F (0) = 1 is considered. The representation is suggested through the integral equation for values of F at the imaginary <b>axis.</b> <b>Numerical</b> {{analysis of this}} equation is described. The straightforward iteration converges within tens of cycles; with double precision arithmetics, the residual of order of 1. e- 14 is achieved. The numerical solution for F remains finite at the imaginary axis, approaching fixed points L, L ∗ of logarithm (L =lnL). Robustness of the convergence and smallness of the residual indicate the existence of unique tetration F (z), that grows along the real axis and approaches L along the imaginary axis, being analytic in the whole complex z-plane except for singularities at integer the z<− 1 and the cut at z<− 2. Application of the same method for other cases of the Abel equation is discussed. 1. introduction The practical {{ability to deal with}} big numbers depends on their representation. The positional numeral system has allowed us to write most of the required numbers throughout the centuries. Invention of the floating point enabled huge numbers, although the “floating overflow ” still occurs, if the logarithm of a number happens to be too large. The range of huge numbers, distinguishable from infinity in computational mathematics, can be drastically extended, using a function with fast growth [1], for example, the Ackermann functions [2].
