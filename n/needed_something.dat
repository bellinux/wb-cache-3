5|$|Aspinall's job as {{personal}} assistant consisted of driving to concerts and meetings, but mostly meant just being there whenever someone <b>needed</b> <b>something.</b> Aspinall {{went on the}} first trip to America, and when George Harrison became ill with a fever and had a temperature of , {{he was ordered to}} stay in bed, so Aspinall stood in for him for The Ed Sullivan Show camera rehearsals.; however, Harrison was back in time for the final shooting. Before the cover of Sgt. Pepper's could be completed by Peter Blake, Aspinall was sent out to find photographs of all of the people that were to be shown on the front cover. Aspinall suggested the idea of Sergeant Pepper being the compere, who would introduce the group, and the reprise of the title song {{near the end of the}} album.|$|E
5|$|David's first book, A Book of Mediterranean Food, {{frequently}} {{referred to}} by the abbreviated title of Mediterranean Food, was published by John Lehmann in 1950, only a year after David's first articles had started appearing in British periodicals. The original typescript of the book consisted almost entirely of reused versions of her recent articles. It was submitted to and turned down {{by a series of}} publishers, one of whom told her that it <b>needed</b> <b>something</b> more than just the bare recipes. David took note, and wrote some linking text, interspersing her own brief prose with relevant excerpts {{from a wide range of}} authors known for their writings about the Mediterranean. They included Norman Douglas, Lawrence Durrell, Gertrude Stein, D. H. Lawrence, Osbert Sitwell, Compton Mackenzie, Arnold Bennett, Henry James and Théophile Gautier.|$|E

25|$|The {{decision}} {{to develop the}} Primus was made after a market survey in 1995 and 1996 {{of some of the}} world's best self-propelled guns from the United States (M109 Paladin), Britain (AS90 Braveheart), Japan (Type 75) and Russia (2S3M1) found them either too heavy or too wide for local terrain. They were known {{to have a lot of}} firepower, were highly mobile and very survivable but they were also very heavy, mostly in the range of 50 tons, and the SAF <b>needed</b> <b>something</b> lighter. The SAF needed the Primus to weigh less than 30 tons and be no wider than 3 metres, for it to move across bridges and through the local vegetation. Hence the decision was made to develop a completely new self-propelled howitzer.|$|E
25|$|Assessment of {{the damage}} {{incurred}} in the Battle of the Yellow Sea led the NTC to another incorrect conclusion. The NTC tacticians noted that a single artillery hit in the mast of Tsesarevich nearly knocked it down; a fallen mast would, most likely, disable the secondary artillery turrets of its central citadel. Lattice masts, introduced with the American s, {{seemed to be a}} robust solution. However, they required substantial deck area to fit their wide bases. Instead of clearing deck space, the NTC designed the masts too narrow to be stable. Instead of Shukhov's hyperboloid profile, their structural beams were arranged in a weaker conical shape. Their deficiency was evident from the start, but the Navy <b>needed</b> <b>something</b> new to dispel the curse of Tsushima, and eagerly accepted the flawed novelty.|$|E
25|$|Unlike these earlier shows, Moonlighting {{sometimes}} {{broke the}} fourth wall {{in much more}} involved and complex ways. Cold opens sometimes featured Shepherd and Willis (in character as Maddie Hayes and David Addison), other actors, viewers, or TV critics directly addressing the audience about the show's production itself. These cold opens were originally born out of desperation {{as a way to}} fill air time, since the dialogue on the show was spoken so quickly and the producers <b>needed</b> <b>something</b> to fill the entire hour. In some other episodes, the plot suddenly changed into extended sequences that involved crew dismantling or changing the sets, characters wandering off the set into other parts of the studio, production crew stepping into the scene as a deus ex machina (e.g. a propmaster suddenly walking into the scene and taking the villain's gun away), or guest actors dropping character and referring to each other by their real names. However, other than in stand-alone openings, the main actors never stepped out of character during the episodes.|$|E

25|$|In October 1925, Crosby and {{his partner}} Al Rinker, brother of singer Mildred Bailey, decided to seek fame in California. They {{traveled}} to Los Angeles where they met up with Mildred Bailey. She introduced them to her show business contacts, and the Fanchon and Marco Time Agency hired them for thirteen weeks for a revue called The Syncopation Idea, starting at the Boulevard Theater in Los Angeles {{and then on the}} Loew's circuit. They each earned $75 a week. Bing and Al Rinker began as a minor part of The Syncopation Idea and it was there that they started to develop as entertainers. They had a lively and individual style and were particularly popular with college students. After The Syncopation Idea closed, Bing and Al worked in the Will Morrissey Music Hall Revue. They further honed their skills with Morrissey, and blossomed when they subsequently had the chance to present their own independent act, and were quickly spotted by the Paul Whiteman organization. At that time, it was felt that Whiteman <b>needed</b> <b>something</b> different and entertaining to break up his musical selections, and Crosby and Rinker filled this requirement. After less than a year in full-time show business, they had become part of one {{of the biggest names in}} the entertainment world. Hired for $150 a week in 1926, they debuted with Whiteman on December 6 at the Tivoli Theatre in Chicago. Their first recording, in October 1926, was I've Got the Girl, with Don Clark's Orchestra, but the Columbia-issued record did them no vocal favors, as it was inadvertently recorded at a speed slower than it should have been, which increased the singers' pitch when played at 78rpm. Throughout his career, Crosby often credited Mildred Bailey for getting him his first important job in the entertainment business.|$|E

He confounds everybody because of that, and people ascribe him meaning. This to me means that we're being successful, because this means they're not worried about everything else, which means they sort of did understand most other things." ...|$|E

500|$|Howard R. Cohen {{learned from}} Charles B. Griffith {{that when the}} film was being edited, [...] "there was a point where two scenes would not cut together.

500|$|... "Dope" [...] {{is a song}} {{recorded}} by American singer Lady Gaga for her third studio album, Artpop (2013).

It was written by Gaga, Paul [...] "DJ White Shadow" [...] Blair, Dino Zisis, and Nick Monson and produced by Gaga and Rick Rubin. Following her hip surgery and cancellation of the Born This Way Ball tour, Gaga became addicted to drugs, which helped her get relief from the pain of surgery and also to cope with her sabbatical. [...] "Dope" [...] was written about this addiction and evolved from a song she had previously composed for her fans, about her confessions. It was added to Artpop because Gaga felt the album <b>needed</b> <b>something</b> more autobiographical.|$|E

[...] As the storyline progressed, {{it was revealed that}} Nick and Dotty had intentions to kill Dot for her inheritance; they concocted a plan to make her think she had developed dementia then overdose her with sleeping pills, which fails when Dotty has a change of heart and Nick flees once again after causing an explosion and being disowned by Dot.|$|E

[...] According to Cohen it was based on a real statement made by Swartzwelder, who was going on and on about how amazing the pig is for the variety of cuts of meat that come from it.|$|E
