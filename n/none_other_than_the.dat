5|$|Brains pilots {{the plane}} {{onto the top}} deck but is confronted by Foster and his two {{surviving}} associates. Holding Penelope hostage in the cockpit, Foster intends to abandon the others, but Alan shoots and kills Foster. The Tiger Moth lifts off again with all hanging on to either the wings or undercarriage, just before Skyship One crashes {{to the ground and}} obliterates the evacuated missile base in a chain reaction. A shootout on board the Tiger Moth disposes of the last of the White Ghost agents, but a bullet has penetrated the fuel tank and the controls will not respond to Penelope. After narrow misses with a bridge on the unfinished M104 motorway and an exhaust tower, Alan and Penelope finally manage to ditch the plane into a field with Tin-Tin and Brains unhurt, however they then realise that no-one has seen Parker since Alan shot Foster, leading them to believe he never made it off Skyship One, but a distant voice reveals that he was caught up in a tree the plane crashed through. Back on Tracy Island, Brains unveils Thunderbird 6 as <b>none</b> <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> repaired, repainted and revamped Tiger Moth, which all agree has proven its value as a rescue aircraft.|$|E
5|$|The {{commissioner}} then tasks Sam and Max with infiltrating the Toy Mafia, {{a criminal}} organisation operating from a casino. The commissioner's mole in the organisation has gone quiet; {{he wants the}} Freelance Police {{to find out what}} happened to the mole. Sam and Max quickly discover that the Toy Mafia are responsible for the toy bear that hypnotised Myra. As they gain the Mafia's trust, they ascertain that the mole has switched sides and is now leading the outfit. After discovering that the casino is a front for a factory producing the hypnotizing bears for mass distribution, the Freelance Police sabotage the factory and destroy the operation. Soon after, the US President starts bringing in bizarre policies; Max is particularly concerned about the introduction of gun restrictions, while Sam believes the President has been hypnotized. At the White House, Max decapitates the President, revealing him to be a mechanical puppet designed to hypnotize the nation through TV broadcasts. The President's bodyguard, <b>none</b> <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> now-fallen Toy Mafia's pit boss, activates a giant robot disguised as the statue at the Lincoln Memorial to run in an emergency election against Max.

25|$|Looking at {{that picture}} today makes me cringe. It {{was done in}} the worst {{possible}} taste. Back then I was too immature to see that. Shame on me—I should have done everything in my power to stop it. The record company came up with the idea, I think. The lyrics incidentally were a take-off on Kiss, whom we had just supported on a tour. I was fooling around and played the riff of the song in the rehearsal room and spontaneously improvised 'cause he's a virgin killer!' trying to do a more or less way-off-the-mark Paul Stanley impersonation. Klaus immediately said 'that's great! You should do something with it.' Then I had the unenviable task of constructing a meaningful set of lyrics around the title, which I actually managed to do to some degree. But the song has a totally different meaning from what people would assume at first.

500|$|At least {{into the}} eighteenth century, shamanism served to {{strengthen}} Manchu ethnic identity by forming [...] "the spiritual core of Manchu life." [...] The Qing emperors also used shamanism to shape Manchu identity. [...] In an edict dated [...] 17 April 1727 {{in which he}} opposed Jesuit attempts to convert Chinese and Manchus to Catholicism, the Yongzheng Emperor (r. 1722–1735) singled out Manchu converts for criticism. To the emperor, the [...] "Lord of Heaven"—the Jesuit name for God in Chinese—was <b>none</b> <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> Heaven the Chinese and Manchus already worshipped. To convince Manchu nobles that they should use existing Manchu rituals for worshipping Heaven, he explained that, [...] "In the empire we have a temple for honoring Heaven and sacrificing to Him.

500|$|The Zhengde Emperor (r. 1505–1521), {{who enjoyed}} {{the company of}} lamas at court despite protests from the censorate, had heard tales of a [...] "living Buddha" [...] which he desired to host at the Ming capital; this was <b>none</b> <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> Rinpung-supported Mikyö Dorje, 8th Karmapa Lama then occupying Lhasa. Zhengde's top advisors made every attempt to dissuade him from {{inviting}} this lama to court, arguing that Tibetan Buddhism was wildly heterodox and unorthodox. Despite protests by the Grand Secretary Liang Chu, in 1515 the Zhengde Emperor sent his eunuch official Liu Yun of the Palace Chancellery {{on a mission to}} invite this Karmapa to Beijing. Liu commanded a fleet of hundreds of ships requisitioned along the Yangtze, consuming 2,835g (100oz) of silver a day in food expenses while stationed for a year in Chengdu of Sichuan. After procurring necessary gifts for the mission, he departed with a cavalry force of about 1,000troops. When the request was delivered, the Karmapa lama refused to leave Tibet despite the Ming force brought to coerce him. The Karmapa launched a surprise ambush on Liu Yun's camp, seizing all the goods and valuables while killing or wounding half of Liu Yun's entire escort. After this fiasco, Liu fled for his life, but only returned to Chengdu several years later to find that the Zhengde Emperor had died.|$|E
500|$|Inspired by Kumara Vyasa, {{the first}} {{complete}} brahminical {{adaptation of the}} epic Ramayana was written by Kumara Valmiki (a pseudonym of Narahari, 1500) and is called Torave Ramayana after the village Torave, where it was composed. As with the Mahabharata, this adaptation veers away from the Jain version by Nagachandra (1105). Nagachandra had used the champu metre popular in Sanskrit works and sought to portray Ravana as a tragic hero. In {{a departure from the}} original version (by Valmiki), the Jain epic ends with Rama's asceticism and nirvana. Kumara Valmiki's account, written in the Valmiki tradition, is in the shatpadi metre and is steeped in the author's devotion for the god Rama, an incarnation of the god Vishnu. According to the author, the epic he wrote was actually a recounting of Shiva's conversation with his consort Parvati. In this version of the epic, King Ravana, the villain, is one of the suitors at Sita's Swayamvara (lit a ceremony of [...] "choice of a husband"). His failure in winning the bride's hand results in jealousy towards Rama, the eventual bridegroom. As the story progresses, Hanuman, for all his services, is heaped with encomium and is exalted to the status of [...] "the next creator". At the end of the story, during the war with Rama, Ravana realises that Rama is <b>none</b> <b>other</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> god Vishnu and hastens to die at his hands to achieve salvation. The chapter narrating the war (Yuddhakanda) is given prominence over all other chapters. The writing has remained popular for centuries and inspired folk theatre such as the Yakshagana, which draws from episodes of Torave Ramayana for enactment. The influence of the Puranic tradition and that of Madhvacharya are visible in this lively yet religious narration that uses every opportunity to glorify its hero, Rama. However, the author has been criticised for dwelling in abstractions and for not reaching the graceful poetic level of his predecessor Kumara Vyasa.|$|E
