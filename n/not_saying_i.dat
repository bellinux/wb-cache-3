500|$|Actress Lana Parrilla {{believed}} that Graham helped fill a void for her character, commenting that his loss [...] "was {{not easy for}} [...] That’s why, when she crushes his heart, there’s a tear {{coming out of her}} eye. She didn’t want to do it, but she had no choice — almost like how she had no choice to kill her father. I’m <b>not</b> <b>saying</b> <b>I</b> agree with it, but for the character, it’s what she had to do." [...] Parrilla also cited [...] "The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter" [...] as the first episode where viewers see [...] "how the two worlds collided," [...] a reference to Regina's ability to kill Graham by squeezing the heart of his fairytale counterpart. The revelation of the vault, Kitsis and Horowitz explained, [...] "is a very important thing for us in terms of moving forward in the season in that we wanted to send a very clear message that Regina knows what’s going on and has some very clear intentions in Storybrooke." [...] The episode was included in Reawakened: A Once Upon a Time Tale – a novelization of the first season – which was published by Hyperion Books in 2013.|$|E
2500|$|When {{asked if}} he thought his {{recording}} would be nominated for a Grammy Award, Rucker responded: [...] "If 'Wagon Wheel' doesn't get nominated for a GRAMMY, country music is screwed. It's as simple as that. I'm <b>not</b> <b>saying</b> <b>I</b> should win it, {{but it should be}} nominated." ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{asked in}} 2014 which leaders he admired, Farage said, [...] "As an operator, {{but not as}} a human being, I would say Putin. The way he played the whole Syria thing. Brilliant. Not that I approve of him politically. How many journalists in jail now?" [...] Farage has criticised {{what he sees as}} EU militarism {{agitating}} western Ukrainians against Russia. Later, in 2015, he said about Putin that [...] "The European Union, and the West, view Putin as the devil. They want to view Putin as the devil. I’m <b>not</b> <b>saying</b> <b>I</b> want take him around for tea and meet mum on Sunday afternoon … But the point is, on this bigger overall battle [...] we need to start recognizing we’re on the same side".|$|E

6000|$|... "I'm <b>not</b> <b>saying</b> <b>I</b> don't {{love the}} little blighter," [...] he said, {{obviously}} moved. [...] "I love her passionately. But that doesn't alter {{the fact that}} I consider that what she needs most in this world is a swift kick in the pants." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He may be Protestant, Thady, {{and yet not}} 'black.' Mind, I'm <b>not</b> <b>saying</b> <b>I</b> wouldn't {{rather see}} Feemy marry a good Catholic; but if she's set her heart on a Protestant, I wouldn't have you be against him for that: that's {{not the way to}} show your religion; it's only nursing your pride; and sure, mightn't she make a Catholic of him too?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I'm <b>not</b> <b>saying</b> <b>I</b> wouldn't spear a fried egg {{with some}} vim if it {{happened}} to float past. But there's {{plenty of time for}} that. Lots of doctors say you oughtn't to eat breakfast, and Indian fakirs go without food {{for days at a time}} in order to develop their souls. Shall I take you back to wherever you're staying? You ought to get a proper sleep in bed." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Has {{that story}} got abroad?" [...] he said simply. [...] "The matter is one which, <b>I</b> need <b>not</b> <b>say,</b> <b>I</b> have never {{mentioned}} to a soul." ...|$|R

No matter for what slight misdemeanor he may have been arrested, once he has made his escape the hue-and-cry will be raised. What I have in mind is simply to let the lad know we are watching over him, and stand ready to do all within our power when the proper time comes." ...|$|E

Still," [...] said Sally, meditatively, [...] "I'm <b>not</b> <b>saying</b> <b>I</b> could have held out much longer: I was {{beginning}} to give. I suppose I've been trampled underfoot by more fat men than any other girl of my age in America. I don't know why it was, but every man who came in who was a bit overweight seemed to make for me by instinct. That's why I like {{to sit on the}} sands here and watch these Frenchmen bathing. It's just heavenly to lie back and watch a two hundred and fifty pound man, coming along and feel that he isn't going to dance with me." ...|$|E
6000|$|In {{a letter}} to his sister, dated June 18, 1814, Byron gives a {{slightly}} different version of the incident, recorded in his note (vide supra): [...] "The Duchess of Somerset also, to mend matters, insisted on presenting me to a Princess Biron, Duchess of Hohen-God-knows-what, and another person to her two sisters, Birons too. But I flew off, and would <b>not,</b> <b>saying</b> <b>I</b> had had enough of introductions for that night at least."--Letters, 1899, iii. 98.

60|$|Everywhere {{the rock}} of the Prudential beetles and towers over the town; but the fortifications are so far {{up in the sky}} that you can really {{distinguish}} nothing but the Marconi telegraphic apparatus at the top. Along the sea-level, which the town mostly keeps, the war-like harness of the stronghold shows through the civil dress of the town in barracks and specific forts and gray battle-ships lying at anchor in the docks. But all is simple and reserved, in the right English fashion. The strength of the place is not to be put forth till it is needed, which will be never, since {{it is hard to imagine}} how it can ever be even attempted by a hostile force. This is <b>not</b> <b>saying,</b> <b>I</b> hope, that an American fleet could not batter it down, nor leave one letter of the insurance advertisement after another on the face of the precipice.|$|E
6000|$|... "I really cannot speak if I am to be {{constantly}} interrupted," [...] said Arnold of Sewa severely. [...] "What I say is, {{that you ought to}} employ tact. Tact; that's what you want. If I had been chosen to represent the Swiss people in this affair--I am <b>not</b> <b>saying</b> <b>I</b> ought to have been, mind you; I merely say if I had been--I should have acted rather after the following fashion: Walking firmly, but not defiantly, into the tyrant's presence, I should have broken the ice with some pleasant remark about the weather. The conversation once started, the rest would have been easy. I should have said that I hoped His Excellency had enjoyed a good dinner. Once on the subject of food, {{and it would have been}} the simplest of tasks to show him how unnecessary taxes on food were, and the whole affair would have been pleasantly settled while you waited. I do not imply that the Swiss people would have done better to have chosen me as their representative. I merely say that that is how I should have acted had they done so." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Then {{something}} took over. I'm <b>not</b> <b>saying</b> <b>I</b> got possessed, I guess I {{just lost}} control. Everything was, like, speeded up. It wasn't drugs, {{it was just}} me." ...|$|E

5000|$|Reviews of {{the album}} were decidedly mixed ranging from lukewarm to positive. Allmusic calls it [...] "a jaw-dropping experience" [...] just short of Crosby, Stills & Nash and Déjà Vu while others such as Rolling Stone were less effusive, {{qualifying}} the somewhat negative tone by writing [...] "I'm <b>not</b> <b>saying</b> <b>I</b> don't like this album." ...|$|E
5000|$|In January 2011, Sullivan {{announced}} via Twitter {{that she}} was indefinitely leaving the music industry saying, [...] "I promised myself when it wasn't fun anymore I wouldn't do it.

5000|$|Tautou {{says she}} {{considers}} France her base, where {{she plans to}} focus her career, {{rather than in the}} United States. She told Stevie Wong of The Straits Times [...] "I am, {{at the end of the}} day, a French actress. I am <b>not</b> <b>saying</b> <b>I</b> will never shoot an English-language movie again, but my home, my community, my career is rooted in France. I would never move to Los Angeles." ...|$|E
5000|$|After {{giving up}} five hits and two runs in two innings of a spring {{training}} game, he retired permanently.

[...] "I heard something pop in my leg yesterday. It wasn't a nice sound. I don't know what that means, but I think it's going to play havoc with my tennis game."

5000|$|At BYU's first-ever Media Day, Mendenhall {{announced}} that he had signed a three-year contract extension that would take him through the 2013 season but hinted that coaching BYU may not be his football calling forever. According to Mendenhall, [...] "BYU wanted to make it longer term than that. I want to be worthy of the position I have and I'm going to give it everything I have for those three (years). I'm <b>not</b> <b>saying</b> <b>I</b> won't go farther than that. I hope that's reported. It's not three and done. But I'm willing to lead the charge through independence, then re-evaluate." ...|$|E
