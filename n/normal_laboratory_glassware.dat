2500|$|When using <b>laboratory</b> <b>glassware</b> {{for high}} {{precision}} measurements, {{such as in}} a testing laboratory, the metrological grade glassware becomes important. [...] The metrological grade the can {{be determined by the}} confidence interval around the nominal value of measurement marks and the traceability of the calibration to an NIST standard. Periodically {{it may be necessary to}} check the calibration of the <b>laboratory</b> <b>glassware.</b>|$|R

50|$|SciLabware Ltd. (formerly trading as Barloworld Scientific Ltd.) is a {{manufacturer}} of <b>laboratory</b> <b>glassware</b> and reusable plastic consumables based in Stone, Staffordshire.|$|R
50|$|Ground glass {{surfaces}} {{have many}} applications, ranging from mere ornamentation on windows and table glassware to scientific uses in optics and <b>laboratory</b> <b>glassware.</b>|$|R
50|$|Laboratory {{drying rack}} can contain and dry up {{various types of}} <b>laboratory</b> <b>glassware</b> such as beaker, Erlenmeyer flask, {{volumetric}} flask, and graduated cylinder.|$|R
50|$|When in use, <b>laboratory</b> <b>glassware</b> {{is often}} {{held in place}} with clamps made for that purpose, which are {{likewise}} attached and {{held in place by}} stands or racks. This article covers aspects of <b>laboratory</b> <b>glassware</b> which may be common to several kinds of glassware and may briefly describe a few glassware items not covered in other articles. Describing glassware can be complicated since manufacturers provide conflicting names for glassware. For example, what ChemGlass calls a glass stopcock, Kontes calls a glass plug.|$|R
50|$|Stone {{is the key}} UK {{manufacturing}} site for the Quickfit <b>laboratory</b> <b>glassware</b> system which finds widespread use in many school, college and university science departments.|$|R
50|$|Some {{containers}} have a loose lid for a closure. <b>Laboratory</b> <b>glassware</b> {{often has}} ground glass joints {{that allow the}} pieces to be fitted together easily.|$|R
50|$|A {{wash bottle}} is a squeeze bottle with a nozzle, used to rinse various pieces of <b>laboratory</b> <b>glassware,</b> such as test tubes and round bottom flasks.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Innovative <b>laboratory</b> <b>glassware</b> and {{experimental}} methods developed by Louis Pasteur and other biologists {{contributed to the}} young field of bacteriology in the late 19th century.|$|R
2500|$|In 1915 Corning Glassworks {{developed}} borosilicate glass, {{which was}} a boom {{to the war effort}} in the United States. [...] Though after the war, many laboratories turned back to imports, research into better glassware flourished. [...] Glassware became more immune to thermal shock while maintaining chemical inertness. [...] Further important technologies impacting the development of <b>laboratory</b> <b>glassware</b> included the development of polytetrafluoroethylene, and a drop in price to the point <b>laboratory</b> <b>glassware</b> is, in some cases, more economical to throw away than to re-use.|$|R
50|$|HMDS {{can be used}} {{to convert}} {{alcohols}} into trimethylsilyl ethers. HMDS {{can be used to}} silylate <b>laboratory</b> <b>glassware</b> and make it hydrophobic, or automobile glass, just as Rain-X does.|$|R
50|$|In the United States, {{some regions}} have {{stringent}} regulations concerning {{the ownership of}} chemicals and equipment. For example, Texas requires the registration {{of even the most}} basic <b>laboratory</b> <b>glassware.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A major {{advantage}} of <b>laboratory</b> <b>glassware</b> is assuredly the transparency of the material. It allows the chemist {{to supervise the}} progress of the chemical reaction, e.g. occurring color changes.|$|R
5000|$|The Fischerhütte at Langewiesener Straße is {{a former}} glass factory and shows {{historic}} <b>laboratory</b> <b>glassware,</b> produced in Ilmenau as well as temporary exhibitions, for example about optics and light.|$|R
50|$|Fractional {{distillation}} in {{a laboratory}} makes use of common <b>laboratory</b> <b>glassware</b> and apparatuses, typically including a Bunsen burner, a round-bottomed flask and a condenser, {{as well as the}} single-purpose fractionating column.|$|R
50|$|The company's {{products}} include <b>laboratory</b> <b>glassware,</b> instruments, disposable plastics, liquid {{handling systems}} and explosion-proof lighting glassware {{for the education}} sector and for industries including microbiology, biotechnology, photoprinting, process systems and lighting.|$|R
25|$|The {{chemistry}} laboratory stereotypically uses {{various forms}} of <b>laboratory</b> <b>glassware.</b> However glassware is not central to chemistry, {{and a great deal}} of experimental (as well as applied/industrial) chemistry is done without it.|$|R
50|$|Sublimation {{apparatus}} is equipment, commonly <b>laboratory</b> <b>glassware,</b> for purification {{of compounds}} by selective sublimation. In principle, the operation resembles purification by distillation, {{except that the}} products do not pass through a liquid phase.|$|R
2500|$|The {{history of}} {{glassware}} {{dates back to}} the Phoenicians who fused obsidian together in campfires making the first glassware. [...] Glassware evolved as other ancient civilizations including the Syrians, Egyptians, and Romans refined the art glassmaking. [...] The art of glassmaking in 16th century Venice was refined to the point intricate shapes could be made. [...] Some time {{before the turn of the}} 19th century laboratory glass manufacture from soda lime started in Germany. [...] Most <b>laboratory</b> <b>glassware</b> was manufactured in Germany up until the start of World War I. [...] During World War I, the supply of <b>laboratory</b> <b>glassware</b> to the United States was cut off.|$|R
50|$|Borosil is {{the market}} leader for <b>laboratory</b> <b>glassware</b> and microwavable {{kitchenware}} in India. It {{was established in}} 1962 in collaboration with Corning Glass Works USA. In 1988, Corning divested its share holding to the current Indian promoters.|$|R
50|$|Moreover, {{laboratory}} {{drying rack}} {{can be used}} to drain other types of <b>laboratory</b> <b>glassware</b> as well. For instance, in terms of funnel, it is used to dry up separating funnel, dropping funnel, filter funnel, and Thistle funnel.|$|R
5000|$|... 'Warm' {{glass is}} in {{contrast}} to the many cold-working glass processes, such as leaded glass. 'Hot' glass, glass blowing or lampworking is the working of glass in a direct flame, such as for <b>laboratory</b> <b>glassware</b> and beadmaking.|$|R
50|$|As of 1997, {{the major}} {{industrial}} enterprises {{in the settlement}} were a <b>laboratory</b> <b>glassware</b> and tools plant, a bakery, as well as various construction and timber factories. The settlement serves as a railway station on the Kazan-Kanash line.|$|R
50|$|<b>Laboratory</b> <b>glassware</b> {{may be part}} of a {{sophisticated}} apparatus, {{as is the case with}} certain types of condensers, and it may be used in conjunction with other laboratory equipment such as ring stands, burette clamps, and bunsen burners.|$|R
