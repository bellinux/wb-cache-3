25|$|Customer {{attrition}} merits {{special attention}} by mobile telecom service providers worldwide. This {{is due to}} the low barriers to switching to a competing service provider especially with the advent of Mobile <b>Number</b> <b>Portability</b> (MNP) in several countries. This allows customers to switch to another provider while preserving their phone numbers. While mature markets with high teledensity (phone market penetration) have churn rates ranging from 1% to 2% per month, high growth developing markets such as India and China are experiencing churn rates between 3% to 4% per month. By deploying new technologies such churn prediction models coupled with effective retention programs, customer attrition could be better managed to stem the significant revenue loss from defecting customers.|$|E
25|$|The {{country is}} divided into {{multiple}} zones, called circles (roughly along state boundaries). Government and several private players run local and long distance telephone services. Competition has caused prices to drop and calls across India {{are one of the}} cheapest in the world. The rates are supposed to go down further with new measures to be taken by the Information Ministry. Call drop fine: Telcos warn of raising tariff. In September 2004, the number of mobile phone connections crossed the number of fixed-line connections and presently dwarfs the wireline segment by a ratio of around 20:1. The mobile subscriber base has grown by a factor of over a hundred and thirty, from 5 million subscribers in 2001 to over 929 million subscribers as of May 2012. India primarily follows the GSM mobile system, in the 900MHz band. Recent operators also operate in the 1800MHz band. The dominant players are Airtel, Reliance Infocomm, Vodafone, Idea cellular and BSNL/MTNL. There are many smaller players, with operations in only a few states. International roaming agreements exist between most operators and many foreign carriers.

Lint accepts multiple input files and library specifications, and checks them for consistency. The separation of function between lint and the C compilers has both historical and practical rationale. The compilers turn C programs into executable files rapidly and efficiently. This is possible in part because the compilers do not do sophisticated type checking, especially between separately compiled programs. Lint takes a more global, leisurely view of the program, looking much more carefully at the compatibilities. This document discusses the use of lint [...] ...|$|R

CAM also serves as the atmospheric component of the Community Climate System Model (CCSM).

The current version of CAM contains a <b>number</b> of performance <b>portability</b> features- compile-time or runtime parameters {{that can be used to}} optimize performance for a given platform, problem or processor count. The large number of tuning options can make benchmarking an arduous task. The paper describes these options and how optimization is managed to make it feasible for evaluation of early systems.

The objective of traffic accident reconstruction is to recreate the event, which is necessary for analyzing the colli-sion dynamics that is used as evidence in court cases. Traffic accident reconstruction and a demonstration of the event require precise data pertaining to scene measurement. However, there are differences between the indi-vidual measuring tools and methods related to traffic accident investigation, just as there are differences between the extent of their use and measurement accuracy. The most commonly applied method is the measuring tape, followed by measurements with total stations and laser rangefinders, while photogrammetry is also becoming increasingly important.

40|$|The Purdue Workshop on Grand Challenges in Computer Architecture fbr the Support of High Performance Computing {{was held}} at Purdue University on December 12 and 13, 1991. The {{workshop}} {{was sponsored by the}} National Science Foundation to identify critical research topics in computer architecture as they relate to high performance computing. After a wide-ranging discussion of the computational characteristics and requirements of the grand challenge applications, four major architectural challenges were identified as crucial to advancing {{the state of the art}} of high performance computation in the coming decade. These computer architecture grand challenges are summarized below. Challenge I : Idealized Parallel Computer Models PL parallel computer model provides the interface between parallel hardware and parallel software. It is the idealization of computation that computer architects strive to support with the greatest possible performance. Although a singlc: model may not fulfill the requirements of all effective architectures and applicatiion domains, the nlultitude of alternatives must be reduced to a small <b>number</b> to support <b>portability</b> of programs and reusability of program parts. Challenge 2 : Usable Peta-Ops Performance This challenge addresses the need for usable computer performance orders of magnitude greater than both the giga-ops performance available today and the tera-ops performance which may be achieved soon. This computer perfonmance cannot be obtained by simply interconnecting massive quantities of existing prlocessor, memory, and I/ 0 resources. Such a system would be unmanageable to program and would ineffectively utilize its processors. The challenge is to (1) dramatically improve and (2) effectively harness the base technologies impacting processors, memory, and UO into a computer system such that the grand challenge applications programmer has available peta-ops (1015 ops) of usable processing performance. Challenge 3 : Computers in an Era of HDTV, Gigabyte Networks, and Visualizlztion Itmerging technologies are providing an opportunity to support startling new communication-intensive applications, such as digital video workstations that treat images as easily as characters are treated today. How can computelr architecture and new communications technology evolve to enable such applications? Challenge 4 : Infrastructure for Prototyping Architectures Testing a new idea in computer architecture has been a difficult process requiring large investments in building design tools and providing a suitable software environment for an experimental machine. Prototype development involves not only hardware, but also software in the form of compilers and operating systems. An frastructure is needed to facilitate the study of the effects of new hardware technologies and machine organizations against different application requirements. These grand challenges in computer architecture are inherently multidisciplinary and will require team efforts crossing boundaries from software to hardware to applications. While it is crucial that the above challenges be addressed, it is important to stress that the viability and usability of parallel computers is also a function of the supporting software systems. Thus, a substantial effort must be devoted to advancing the software aspects of high performance computing. This involves improving the software interface supported by paralllel computers and developing languages, compilers, and software tools that simplify the task of parallelizing, mapping, and optimizing algorithms for efficient execution on parallel computers. In the arena of high performance parallel computers, it is more important than ever for computer architects to consider the issues of system software, application needs, and usability when designing and implementing machines. To address the interaction of this full range of subjects is a challenge in itself...|$|R
