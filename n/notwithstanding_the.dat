25|$|<b>The</b> <b>notwithstanding</b> clause was invoked {{routinely}} by {{the province}} of Quebec (which {{did not support the}} enactment of the Charter but is subject to it nonetheless). The provinces of Saskatchewan and Alberta have also invoked <b>the</b> <b>notwithstanding</b> clause, to end a strike and to protect an exclusively heterosexual definition of marriage, respectively. (Note that Alberta's use of <b>the</b> <b>notwithstanding</b> clause is of no force or effect, since the definition of marriage is federal not provincial jurisdiction.) The territory of Yukon also passed legislation once that invoked <b>the</b> <b>notwithstanding</b> clause, but <b>the</b> legislation was never proclaimed in force.|$|R
5|$|In Caplin & Drysdale v. United States (1989), the Court {{held that}} there is no Sixth Amendment {{exception}} to criminal forfeiture; i.e., after conviction, the government can seek forfeiture of already paid legal fees under a forfeiture statute, <b>notwithstanding</b> <b>the</b> effect on the defendant's ability to retain counsel of choice.|$|E
5|$|The {{basic variant}} of the {{national}} flag is a plain white-and-red horizontal bicolor. A variant defaced with the coat of arms is restricted to official use abroad and at sea.

5|$|With {{the arrival}} of the year 2012, Nostradamus's prophecies started to be co-opted (especially by the History Channel) as {{evidence}} suggesting {{that the end of the}} world was imminent, <b>notwithstanding</b> <b>the</b> fact that his book never mentions the end of the world, let alone the year 2012.|$|E
2500|$|In addition, [...] some {{of these}} rights are also {{subjected}} to <b>the</b> <b>notwithstanding</b> clause (section 33). <b>The</b> <b>notwithstanding</b> clause authorizes governments to temporarily override the rights and freedoms in sections 2 and 7–15 {{for up to five}} years, subject to renewal. The Canadian federal government has never invoked it, and some have speculated that its use would be politically costly. In <b>the</b> past, <b>the</b> <b>notwithstanding</b> clause was invoked routinely by the province of Quebec (which did not support the enactment of the Charter but is subject to it nonetheless).

5|$|Although this {{campaign}} ultimately secured Ælfgar's reinstatement, Ælfgar (then Earl of Mercia) was again exiled from England in 1058, {{and proceeded to}} ally himself with Gruffudd ap Llywelyn and a Norse fleet. <b>Notwithstanding</b> <b>the</b> fact that Scandinavian sources fail to report this operation, the Annals of Tigernach reveals that {{the leader of the}} fleet was Magnús (died 1069), son of Haraldr Sigurðarson, King of Norway (died 1066), and further reports that Magnús' forces were composed of Orcadians, Islesmen, and Dubliners.|$|E
5|$|At Hanford, top {{priority}} was initially {{given to the}} installations in the 300 area. This contained buildings for testing materials, preparing uranium, and assembling and calibrating instrumentation. One of the buildings housed the canning equipment for the uranium slugs, while another contained a small test reactor. <b>Notwithstanding</b> <b>the</b> high priority allocated to it, work on the 300 area fell behind schedule due to the unique and complex nature of the 300 area facilities, and wartime shortages of labor and materials.|$|E
5|$|By late April, Air America {{helicopters}} {{were flying}} several daily shuttles from TF76 to the DAO Compound {{to enable the}} 9th MAB to conduct evacuation preparations at the DAO without exceeding the Paris Peace Accords' limit of a maximum of 50 U.S. military personnel in South Vietnam. The US Government was continuing to observe its obligations under the Accords, <b>notwithstanding</b> <b>the</b> North Vietnamese invasion. In late April the MSG Marines were ordered to abandon Marshall Hall/Marine House, their billet at 204 Hong Thap Tu Street (now 204 Nguyen Thi Minh Khai Street), and move into the recreation area in the Embassy compound.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>Notwithstanding</b> Clause is <b>the</b> {{cornerstone}} of our Canadian constitutional architecture. It merges parliamentary supremacy and constitutional democracy. But <b>the</b> <b>Notwithstanding</b> Clause finds itself conceptually situated between illegitimacy and desuetude in a constitutional purgatory. This {{is not a}} promising portrait. Nonetheless, it is a blessing in disguise. The tragic failure of <b>the</b> <b>Notwithstanding</b> Clause is a fortuitous opportunity {{to create a new}} process to achieve its objectives while also remaining loyal to the intentions of its creators. That is the task I have given myself in this Article. This new process—which I call advisory review—is a new form of judicial review that is uniquely Canadian, born of Canadian roots, and consistent with Canadian constitutional traditions...|$|R
25|$|Section 1 of the Charter permits Parliament or {{the provincial}} legislatures to enact laws that place {{certain kinds of}} limited {{restrictions}} on the freedoms listed under section 2.

5|$|Children {{stayed at}} the orphanage for up to 10 years, graduating {{at the age of}} 18. They came from all parts of Palestine as well as Syria, Egypt, Ethiopia, Armenia, Turkey, Russia, Iran, and Germany. They were also of differing {{religious}} denominations, including Protestant, Greek Orthodox, Catholic, Coptic, and Maronite. <b>Notwithstanding</b> <b>the</b> ethnic diversity of the student body, the language of instruction was German and Arabic. Most of the teachers employed during the orphanage’s first 50 years were German, with some Armenians and Arabs.|$|E
5|$|In 1758 the State of New Jersey {{purchased}} the Indian title to lands in that State, {{and as a}} consideration for the purchase, bought a tract of land as a residence for the Indians, having previously passed an act declaring that such lands should not be subject thereafter to any tax by the State, any law or usage, or law then existing, to the contrary <b>notwithstanding.</b> <b>The</b> Indians, {{from the time of}} purchase, lived upon the land until the year 1801, when they were authorized, by an act of the Legislature, to sell the land.|$|E
5|$|<b>Notwithstanding</b> <b>the</b> General Assembly's {{attempt to}} promote peace and unity, two {{distinct}} factions, the Old School and the New School, developed through the 1820s over {{the issues of}} confessional subscription, revivalism, {{and the spread of}} New England theology. The New School faction advocated revivalism and New England theology, while the Old School was opposed to the extremes of revivalism and desired strict conformity to the Westminster Confession. The ideological center of Old School Presbyterianism was Princeton Theological Seminary, which under the leadership of Archibald Alexander and Charles Hodge became associated with a brand of Reformed scholasticism known as Princeton Theology.|$|E
50|$|Lincoln and {{two other}} anglophone ministers {{resigned}} from cabinet in 1989, to protest the Bourassa government's language policy and its adoption of Bill 178, which invoked <b>the</b> <b>notwithstanding</b> clause of <b>the</b> Canadian Constitution to require French to be the dominant language on commercial signs.|$|R

5|$|Over {{his four}} years as Secretary of Defense, Cheney {{downsized}} the military and his budgets showed negative real growth, despite pressures to acquire weapon systems advocated by Congress. The Department of Defense's total obligational authority in current dollars declined from $291 billion to $270 billion. Total military personnel strength decreased by 19 percent, from about 2.2 million in 1989 to about 1.8 million in 1993. <b>Notwithstanding</b> <b>the</b> overall reduction in military spending, Cheney directed {{the development of a}} Pentagon plan to ensure U.S. military dominance in the post-Cold War era.|$|E
5|$|Owing {{to a lack}} of {{confidence}} in the local currency, the US dollar is widely accepted as a medium of exchange alongside the Somali shilling. Dollarization <b>notwithstanding,</b> <b>the</b> large issuance of the Somali shilling has increasingly fueled price hikes, especially for low value transactions. This inflationary environment, however, is expected {{to come to an end}} as soon as the Central Bank assumes full control of monetary policy and replaces the presently circulating currency introduced by the private sector.|$|E
5|$|The {{case was}} remanded to the Ninth Circuit, which {{declared}} the arbitration agreement unconscionable under California law.

5|$|The {{team was}} {{generally}} very well received outside London, {{and especially in}} north, where rugby was dominated by the working-class. Reaction to the team in the south, where the public school establishment controlled the game, was less positive, and the sportsmanship of the team was criticised. Despite this, Ellison clearly enjoyed the experience of touring with the team, and in 1902 he wrote—"I shall never forget the trip, <b>notwithstanding</b> <b>the</b> extremely heavy programme of fixtures {{we had to go}} through. Perhaps the most delightful part of our experiences was tasted not so much on the field of play as off it".|$|E
5|$|After {{leaving his}} first wife, Elizabeth, he married {{for the second}} time, on 20 September 1858, to Adeline de Horsey, {{achieving}} still greater notoriety {{as he had been}} conducting an affair with her as his wife was dying. This, however, was a happy union, <b>notwithstanding</b> <b>the</b> disparity in their ages and Cardigan's disappointment that there were, again, no children. Adeline, excluded from fashionable society {{for the rest of her}} days, accustomed herself to life in the country, happily forsaking her previous interests of books, painting and music, while Brudenell spent large sums of money making their home together comfortable. Adeline even remained on good terms with Brudenell's principal mistress, Maria Marchioness of Ailesbury, and tolerated his other affairs.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1943 the Axis forces had complete control of the airspace over Yugoslavian territory. No aerial opposition of any kind was expected {{and that was the}} primary reason that the bomber force could operate without any fighter cover, <b>notwithstanding</b> <b>the</b> fact that there was a total lack of any serious fighter force in the ZNDH's squadrons. However, the situation started to change by {{the beginning}} of 1943. The Headquarters (HQ) of the ZNDH had plans to re-arm at least one Group with more modern aircraft of German or Italian origin. The Italians refused to supply the requested Macchi C.200 and Macchi C.202 fighters, as the Regia Aeronautica needed every aircraft to fill its own squadrons in {{the beginning of}} 1943.|$|E
