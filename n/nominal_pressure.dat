Materials and Methods: This interventional study was conducted on 39 patients with coronary artery lesions, in whom Zotarolimus-eluting stents (N= 20), Paclitaxel-eluting stents (N= 11) and other stents (N= 8) were deployed four times at nominal inflation pressure and increased inflation times (5, 15, 30 and 45 seconds). After the deployments, enhanced stent visualization imaging technique (IC stent) {{was used to assess}} stent placement and artery expansion. Results: In this study, early success rate was estimated at 79. 5 % using the enhanced stent visualization imaging technique. In addition, major adverse cardiac event (MACE) was determined at 2. 6 %.
