5|$|Although The Landlord's Game was patented, {{and some}} hand-made boards were made, {{it was not}} {{actually}} manufactured and published until 1906. Magie and two other Georgists established the Economic Game Company of New York, which began publishing her game. Magie submitted an edition published by the Economic Game Company to Parker Brothers around 1910, which George Parker declined to publish. In the UK, {{it was published in}} 1913 by the <b>Newbie</b> Game Company under the title Brer Fox an' Brer Rabbit. Shortly after the game's formal publication, Scott Nearing, a professor in what was then known as the Wharton School of Finance and Commerce at the University of Pennsylvania, began using the game as a teaching tool in his classes. His students made their own boards, and taught the game to others. After Nearing was dismissed from the Wharton School, he began teaching at the University of Toledo. A former student of Nearing, Rexford Guy Tugwell, also taught The Landlord's Game at Wharton, and took it with him to Columbia University. Apart from commercial distribution, it spread by word of mouth and was played in slightly variant homemade versions over the years by Quakers, Georgists, university students (including students at Smith College, Princeton, and MIT), and others who became aware of it.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{field of}} query {{processing}} {{has recently been}} coupled with natural language processing (NLP) that has shown dramatic shift in both research direction and methodology {{in the past few}} years. In past, most of the work was done on computational linguistics which drew focus on purely symbolic methods. Recently, more prominence is given to hybrid methods that combine new empirical corpus-based methods, including the use of probabilistic and information theoretic techniques, with traditional symbolic methods. The main purpose of Natural Language Query Processing is to interpret an English sentence and hence a complementary action is taken. Querying to databases in natural language is a convenient method for data access, especially for <b>newbie’s</b> who have less knowledge about complicated database query languages such as SQL. This paper emphasise on the structural designing methods for translating English Query into SQL using automata...|$|R

However, it uses its [...] "cast to breakevery rule of reality, but it plays everything so straight [...] it takes you a moment to realize what just happened doesn't make any sense." [...] A fan of the subgenre, she praises the anime it for its surreal humour, and for being [...] "anime <b>newbie</b> friendly" [...] in that its jokes work on multiple levels.

How is Steffy going {{to fall in love with}} Rick after he had sex with her sister and their mom?'" [...] She also noted that [...] "I had to play that my fraternal twin is gone, and maybe I am doing this to live her life as well as have fun. She had to fill that void, and she could not talk to anyone. She lost a part of herself. I have to stress that to the viewers."
