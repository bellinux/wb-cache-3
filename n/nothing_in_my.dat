[...] When asked about the Poverty Subcommittee's findings, Clark said that more {{resources}} needed to be allocated to the War on Poverty.

500|$|The opening movement, [...] "" [...] (Behold, I {{will send}} out many fishers), {{is given to}} the bass solo, {{possibly}} because Jeremiah has God speak in the first person. The music follows the text in two sections, as in a motet. Probably therefore Bach avoided the title aria and wrote [...] instead. Some cantatas on texts by Christiana Mariana von Ziegler from the second annual cycle begin in a similar way with a bible quotation, of Jesus saying [...] "" [...] (I am a Good Shepherd, BWV 85), [...] "" [...] (It is good for you that I leave, BWV 108), and Jesus saying [...] "" [...] (Until now you have asked for <b>nothing</b> <b>in</b> <b>My</b> name, BWV 87).|$|E
500|$|Progressive jazz {{is a form}} of {{big band}} that is more complex or experimental. It {{originated}} in the 1940s with arrangers who drew from modernist composers such as Igor Stravinsky and Paul Hindemith. Its [...] "progressive" [...] features were replete with dissonance, atonality, and brash effects. Progressive jazz was most popularized by the bandleader Stan Kenton during the 1940s. Critics were initially wary of the idiom. Dizzy Gillespie wrote in his autobiography; [...] "They tried to make Stan Kenton a 'white hope,' called modern jazz and my music 'progressive,' then tried to tell me I played 'progressive' music. I said, 'You're full of shit!' 'Stan Kenton? There ain't <b>nothing</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> music that's cold, cold like his." ...|$|E

2500|$|Fitzwilliam {{arrived in}} Balbriggan, Ireland on 4 January 1795. On 10 January {{he wrote to}} the Duke of Portland that [...] "not one day has passed since my arrival without {{intelligence}} being received of violences committed in Westmeath, Meath, Longford and Cavan: Defenderism is there in its greatest force...I find the texture of government very weak" [...] and chaotic. On 15 January he again wrote, claiming that the violence committed by peasants was not political but [...] "merely the outrages of banditti" [...] which could be solved by helping Catholics of rank to preserve law and order. This could only be done by Emancipation: [...] "No time is to be lost, the business will presently be at hand, and the first step I take is of infinite importance". However he [...] "endeavoured to keep clear of any engagement whatever" [...] on Emancipation but that [...] "there is <b>nothing</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> answer that they can construe into a rejection {{of what they are}} all looking forward to, the repeal of the remaining restrictive and penal laws": ...|$|E
2500|$|Tony Blair {{called the}} [...] "Who's Calling Christian?" [...] hotline, after charity campaigner Graham Marsh {{contacted}} Blair. If {{he were to}} win, Marsh, who received a heart transplant in 1999, {{said he planned to}} donate his £10,000 to the two charities he supports - the Freemans Heart and Lung Transplant Association and the Tyne Youth and Community Centre, both in Newcastle upon Tyne. Blair began by telling the programme: [...] "Probably <b>nothing</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> career has prepared me for this." [...] When O'Connell asked if he should be referred to as The Right Honourable Tony Blair, the Prime Minister replied: [...] "Refer to me any way you like as long as it's reasonably polite! Tony will do fine... Someone from my constituency phoned me and said 'Why don't we do this?' and I said yes because they are really, really good causes." [...] The exchange ended with O'Connell asking Blair to choose his favourite song from the 1980s. He chose [...] "Street With No Name" [...] by U2 - actually called [...] "Where the Streets Have No Name". Marsh and Blair resoundingly won the contest on 7 November 2006.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the first}} part, {{the opinion of}} a [...] "temporary Dean of the Faculty of Holy Theology at Cologne" [...] namely Lambertus de Monte of 's-Heerenberg is {{expressed}} and then professors Jacobus Straelen of Noetlinck, Andreas Schermer of Ochsenfurt and Thomas Lyel of Scotland testify that they agree with his opinion. The following is {{an excerpt from the}} opinion: [...] that this three part treatise, which has been examined by me and carefully compared against Scripture with regard to its first two parts, contains <b>nothing,</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> humble judgment at least, that is contrary to the pronouncements of the non-erroneous philosophers, or against the Truth of the Holy, Catholic and Apostolic Faith, or against the determinations of the Doctors approved or admitted by the Holy Church, and that the third part should certainly be upheld and approved in regard to the punishments of those heretics whom it treats, in that it does not contradict Holy Canons, and also because of the personal experiences described in this treatise, which are believed to be true because of the reputation of such great men, particularly since they are inquisitors. It should be ensured that this treatise will become known to learned and zealous men, who will then, on the basis of it, provide various healthy and appropriate advice for the extermination of sorceresses ...|$|E
2500|$|Felix, being bisexual, was {{not certain}} {{if he was}} [...] "fit for marriage." [...] Still, {{he was drawn to}} Irina and her icon-like beauty when he first {{encountered}} her. [...] "One day when I was out riding I met a very beautiful girl accompanied by an elderly lady. Our eyes met and she made such an impression on me that I reined in my horse to gaze at her as she walked on," [...] he wrote in his memoirs. One day in 1910, he was paid a visit by Grand Duke Alexander Mikhailovich and Grand Duchess Xenia Alexandrovna and was happy to discover the girl he had seen on the riding trail was their only daughter, Irina. [...] "This time I {{had plenty of time to}} admire the wondrous beauty of the girl who was eventually to become my wife and lifelong companion. She had beautiful features, clear-cut as a cameo, and looked very like her father." [...] He renewed his acquaintance with Irina in 1913 and was even more drawn to her. [...] "She was very shy and reserved, which added a certain mystery to her charm.... Little by little, Irina became less timid. At first her eyes were more eloquent than her conversation but, as she became more expansive, I learned to admire the keenness of her intelligence and her sound judgment. I concealed <b>nothing</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> past life from her, and, far from being perturbed by what I told her, she showed great tolerance and comprehension." [...] Yusupov wrote that Irina, perhaps because she had grown up with so many brothers, showed none of the artifice or lack of honesty that had put him off relations with other women.|$|E
