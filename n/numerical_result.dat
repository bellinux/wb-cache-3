5000|$|If {{everyone}} has the same income, then TT equals 0. If one person has all the income, then TT gives the result , which is maximum inequality.

The Theil index measures an entropic [...] "distance" [...] the population is away from the egalitarian state of everyone having the same income.

50|$|One {{example of}} a {{scientific}} problem that is naturally expressed in continuous terms is path integration. The general technique of path integration has numerous applications including quantum mechanics, quantum chemistry, statistical mechanics, and computational finance. Because randomness is present throughout quantum theory, one typically requires that a quantum computational procedure yield the correct answer, not with certainty, but with high probability. For example, one might aim for a procedure that computes the correct answer with probability at least 3/4. One also specifies a degree of uncertainty, typically by setting the maximum acceptable error. Thus, {{the goal of a}} quantum computation could be to compute the <b>numerical</b> <b>result</b> of a path-integration problem to within an error of at most ε with probability 3/4 or more. In this context, it is known that quantum algorithms can outperform their classical counterparts, and the computational complexity of path integration, as measured by the number of times one would expect to have to query a quantum computer to get a good answer, grows as the inverse of ε.|$|E
50|$|The {{types of}} {{physical}} measurements required under the Rockwood definition {{are similar to}} those required under the Trasatti definition, but they are used in a different way, e.g. in Rockwood's approach they are used to calculate the equilibrium vapour pressure of the electron gas. The numerical value for the absolute potential of the standard hydrogen electrode one would calculate under the Rockwood definition is sometimes fortuitously close to the value one would obtain under the Trasatti definition. This near-agreement in the numerical value depends on the choice of ambient temperature and standard states, and {{is the result of the}} near-cancellation of certain terms in the expressions. For example, if a standard state of one atmosphere ideal gas is chosen for the electron gas then the cancellation of terms occurs at a temperature of 296 K, and the two definitions give an equal <b>numerical</b> <b>result.</b> At 298.15 K a near-cancellation of terms would apply and the two approaches would produce nearly the same numerical values. However, there is no fundamental significance to this near agreement because it depends on arbitrary choices, such as temperature and definitions of standard states.|$|E

5000|$|However, in {{a recent}} work, [...] "Solving the hard problem of Bertrand's paradox",Diederik Aerts and Massimiliano Sassoli de Bianchi {{consider}} that a mixed strategy is necessary to tackle Bertrand's paradox. According to these authors, the problem needs first to be disambiguated by specifying in a very clear way {{the nature of the}} entity which is subjected to the randomization, and only once this is done the problem can be considered to be a well-posed one, in the Jaynes sense, so that the principle of maximum ignorance can be used to solve it. To this end, and since the problem doesn't specify how the chord has to be selected, the principle needs to be applied not {{at the level of the}} different possible choices of a chord, but at the much deeper level of the different possible ways of choosing a chord. This requires the calculation of a meta average over all the possible ways of selecting a chord, which the authors call a universal average. To handle it, they use a discretization method inspired by what is done in the definition of the probability law in the Wiener processes. The result they obtain is in agreement with the <b>numerical</b> <b>result</b> of Jaynes, although their well-posed problem is different from that of Jaynes.|$|E
