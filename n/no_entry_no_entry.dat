40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a model in}} which firms compete in a Cournot-Nash game. Firms can choose an exclusive agency (EA) or an independent agency (IA) distribution system. Firms can enter and exit the market and switch distribution systems with no cost. The only difference between an EA system and an IA system is the operating leverage or cost structure. An EA firm incurs low (per unit) variable cost but high fixed cost. An IA firm incurs high variable cost but low fixed cost. Under the different operating leverages, we investigate the equilibrium outcome in which <b>no</b> <b>entry,</b> <b>no</b> exit, and no switching occur. We find that coexistence is possible when IA firms are less efficient than EA firms. IA firms can dominate in the market even if IA firms are inefficient. An EA firm produces more than an IA firm. IA firms tend to dominate more in high risk lines than in low risk lines. We provide numerical examples showing how an inefficient system can survive and even dominate in the market. ...|$|R

40|$|Market {{entry is}} the essence of {{strategy}} and is largely viewed as a dichotomous event: <b>entry</b> or <b>no</b> <b>entry.</b> What has not been acknowledged is the uniqueness of each market entry. Our study highlights the scale of market entry in the context of multipoint competition. We assert that entry scale varies based on the risk of market incumbent retaliation. Theory suggests that when risk associated with retaliation are low, firms enter with large scale and when associated risks are high, firms enter with low scale. Further, survival is viewed as dependent on following theory. We argue and find supporting evidence that firms behave in the opposite manner and do so to their own benefit, thereby revealing a unique discrepancy between theory and practice among 75 product market entries by 27 firms...|$|R

Therefore, this shape of market area will always emerge and in {{the case of}} free entry will exhaust the region. Of particular merit is the fact that these market areas are closer to reality. Further, weaknesses in the analyses of Mills - Lav and Greenhut - Ohta were exposed and some corrections made. ...|$|R
