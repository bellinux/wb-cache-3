50|$|The {{product of}} the {{marketing}} mix refers to the goods and/or services that the organisation will offer to the consumer. An organisation can achieve this by either creating a <b>new</b> <b>food</b> <b>product,</b> or by modifying or improving an existing <b>food</b> <b>product.</b> For example, an organic almond yoghurt drink {{would be considered a}} new product, whereas a chocolate flavoured milk drink would be an extension of an existing product (Helm & Gritsch, 2014). The three steps to develop and extend a <b>food</b> <b>product</b> include generating ideas, analysing the ideas for feasibility and testing ideas for demand.

50|$|The Functional Food Centre has {{the goal}} of {{providing}} scientific information about food and health to consumers, government and the food industry. It tests popular claims about food, for example that genetically modified crops will feed the world, that substances such as omega-3 in fish oil will make children more intelligent, or that antioxidants can reduce cancer by removing free radicals. It develops <b>new</b> <b>food</b> <b>products</b> such as low glycemic index bread, which reduces cholesterol and blood sugar levels and help weight loss.

50|$|In {{deciding}} {{what type of}} <b>new</b> <b>food</b> <b>products</b> a consumer would most prefer, a manufacturer can either try {{to develop a new}} food product or try to modify or extend an existing food. For example, a sweet, flavored yogurt drink would be a new product, but milk in a new flavor (such as chocolate strawberry) would be an extension of an existing product. There are three steps to both developing and extending: generate ideas, screen ideas for feasibility, and test ideas for appeal. Only after these steps will a food product make it to national market. Of one hundred new food product ideas that are considered, only six make it to a supermarket shelf.|$|E

50|$|After the War many <b>new</b> <b>food</b> <b>products</b> became {{available}} to the typical household, with branded foods advertised for their convenience. The shortage of servants was felt in the kitchen, but now instead of an experienced cook spending hours on difficult custards and puddings the housewife could purchase instant foods in jars, or powders that could be quickly mixed. Breakfast porridge from branded, more finely milled, oats could now be cooked in two minutes, not 20. American-style dry cereals began to challenge the porridge and bacon and eggs of the middle classes, and the bread and margarine of the poor. Shops carried more bottled and canned goods and fresher meat, fish and vegetables. While wartime shipping shortages had sharply narrowed choices, the 1920s saw many new kinds of foods--especially fruits--imported from around the world, along with better quality, packaging, and hygiene. Middle class households now had ice boxes or electric refrigerators, which made for better storage and the convenience of buying in larger quantities.|$|E

The shortage of servants was felt in the kitchen, but now instead of an experience cook spending hours on difficult custards and puddings the ordinary housewife working alone could purchase instant foods in jars, or powders that could be quickly mixed. Breakfast porridge from branded, more finely milled, oats could now be cooked in two minutes, not 20. American-style dry cereals began to challenge the porridge and bacon and eggs of the middle classes, and the bread and margarine of the poor. Street vendors were fewer. Shops were upgraded; the flies were gone as were the open barrels of biscuits and pickles. Groceries and butcher shops carried more bottled and canned goods as well as fresher meat, fish and vegetables.

50|$|Differences {{within a}} {{particular}} industry can also occur in terms of appropriate aspirational ages.

30|$|Furthermore, {{the study}} {{revealed}} that with every increase in household size by one member, consumers’ WTP amount reduces. This is because consumers with large household size {{are less likely to}} spend more on yoghurt and other soft drinks because they have huge household commitments that put pressure on their monthly budgets and therefore little is always left for purchasing yoghurt and other soft drinks. As household monthly income increases, consumers’ WTP amount for tiger nut yoghurt will increase. The implication is that income plays a role in deciding whether or not to accept a <b>new</b> <b>food</b> <b>product.</b> That is, consumers may wish to demand a <b>food</b> <b>product</b> especially when it is proven to be healthy and nutritionally beneficial but low incomes could prevent them from patronizing it.|$|R
