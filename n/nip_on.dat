60|$|So Collie took {{advantage}} of her sex to pick upon White Fang and maltreat him. His instinct would not permit him to attack her, while her persistence would not permit him to ignore her. When she rushed at him he turned his fur-protected shoulder to her sharp teeth and walked away stiff-legged and stately. When she forced him too hard, he was compelled to go about in a circle, his shoulder presented to her, his head turned from her, and {{on his face and}} in his eyes a patient and bored expression. Sometimes, however, a <b>nip</b> <b>on</b> his hind-quarters hastened his retreat and made it anything but stately. But as a rule he managed to maintain a dignity that was almost solemnity. He ignored her existence whenever it was possible, and {{made it a point to}} keep out of her way. When he saw or heard her coming, he got up and walked off.|$|E

When the press felt exits the nip and continues around, a vacuum box known as an Uhle Box applies vacuum (normally -60 kPa) to the press felt to remove the moisture so that when the felt returns to the <b>nip</b> <b>on</b> the next cycle, it does not add moisture to the sheet.|$|E

NiP went out to a 7-0 lead before mousesports got on the board. mousesports closed it to 3-8 but would only find two more rounds in the entire map. NiP closed it with a 16-5 win. Xizt lead the server with 21 kills, with NiKo close by with 19. On Cache, arguably NiP's best map, mousesports upset the Swedish team with a 16-12 win under NiKo's 27 kills. GeT_RiGhT had 23 for <b>NiP.</b> <b>On</b> Overpass, mousesports made it a respectable 6-9 deficit since it started on the less favored side. However, it could not get its counter-terrorist side rolling as NiP dominated and went on a 7-3 run {{in the second half}} to close out the game 16-9. GeT_RiGhT lead the way with 24 kills and THREAT had 20. Spiidi and 21 kills and denis had 20 for mousesports while mousesports star NiKo only had 15 kills.

In the coexisting system of multiple metals, the adsorption capacity of Pd(II) IIPs and its corresponding <b>NIPs</b> <b>on</b> Pd(II) is the largest, followed by Pt, Zn, Ni, and Cu. The adsorption capacity of Pd(II) IIPs on Pd(II) was 26.7, 21.5, 31.8, and 10.4 times {{higher than that of}} Cu(II), Zn(II), Ni(II), and Pt(II), respectively. The results indicated that Pd(II) IIPs was highly efficient and selective for Pd (II). The adsorption capacity of Pd(II) IIPs on Pt(II) was larger than that on Cu(II), Zn(II), and Ni(II), which may because of Pt(II)’s chemical similarity to Pd(II) and competitive adsorption sites compared with other metals. The adsorption capacity of <b>NIPs</b> <b>on</b> Cu(II), Zn(II), Ni(II), and Pt(II) was larger than that of Pd(II) IIPs, whereas Pd (II) is exactly the opposite, indicating that better adsorption effect of Pd(II) IIPs on Pd(II) than that of NIPs is not caused by large specific area but the formation of the recognition adsorption sites for Pd(II) in the preparation process.|$|R

40|$|The {{adhesion}} of electrolessly deposited <b>Ni(P)</b> <b>on</b> 96 and 99. 5 % pure alumina was {{studied as}} a function of annealing temp., up to 580 DegC. The adhesion was measured with the direct pull-off test and the peel test. The interface structure was analyzed with cross-section transmission electron micrographs. Fracture surfaces were analyzed with SEM/energy dispersive x-ray anal., static-secondary ion mass spectroscopy, and XPS. The optimum annealing temp. was 400 DegC, at which an increase in peel energy and adhesion strength by a factor of 2 - 3 was measured, with respect to the as-deposited value. The weak boundary layer, which was previously reported to be present in this system, is still present after annealing and the fracture path remains through this interfacial layer of a few nanometers in thickness. Therefore, the adhesion improvement is ascribed to stronger cohesion of the material in the weak boundary layer. [on SciFinder (R) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{interface}} microstructure and interface chem. of electrolessly deposited <b>Ni(P)</b> <b>on</b> alumina ceramics is {{studied to}} obtain {{insight into the}} influence of mol. interactions upon the adhesion. Detailed static secondary-ion-mass spectrometry, XPS, Auger electron spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analyses {{have been carried out}} with samples with various roughness, of which the mech. analyses are described in a companion article. TEM cross-section micrographs showed a close contact between the two phases on a nanometer scale for all sample types. In addn., a 1 - 2 -nm-thick interfacial layer was obsd. This layer consists of nucleation material and compds. from the metalization soln. Fracture surface analyses showed that fracture takes place through this layer, which is therefore considered to be the weak boundary layer in this system. The presence of this weak boundary layer explains the importance of substrate surface roughness and mech. interlocking for the fracture energy. [on SciFinder (R) ...|$|E

40|$|The room {{temperature}} growth and ordering of (porphyrinato) nickel(II) (or nickel(II) porphine, NiP) molecules on the Ag(111) surface {{have been investigated}} using scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) and low-energy electron diffraction (LEED).

LEED data obtained from one monolayer of the <b>NiP</b> <b>on</b> the Ag(111) surface show the formation of two mirror domains each rotated either clockwise or counterclockwise by 6 ? {{with respect to the}} substrate.

Strong adhesion of Ni(P) was found for the substrates with ZrO 2 and Al 2 O 3 coatings and weak adhesion for the substrates with SiO 2, TiO 2, SnO 2, Y 2 O 3 and ITO coatings. The fracture path and the type of interfacial bonding were analyzed using SEM, energy-dispersive anal. of X-rays and XPS. In the case of the strongly adhering samples, fracture took place through the metal layer and along the interface. In the case of the weakly adhering samples only interfacial failure was obsd. between the Ni(P) layer and the metal oxide coating. Cross-section TEM studies of the interfaces suggested that the differences in peel energy values are caused by differences in micromech. interlocking at the metal oxide-Ni(P) interface.

40|$|Policy issue In 2002, {{it became}} {{mandatory}} for food producers in Australia {{to provide a}} Nutrition Information Panel (<b>NIP)</b> <b>on</b> the back of food packages. However, {{research has shown that}} consumers often misinterpret NIPs or do not use them at all. Health advocates have begun to consider one form of NIPs - Front-of-Pack labelling (FoPL) - as a means of supporting healthy food choices. There are more than 20 FoPL formats in use worldwide. The information they provide varies considerably (for example summaries of key ingredients or detailed information about them), as do the strategies underpinning their use. Three FoPL format s are commonly used in the Australian market – National Heart Foundation (NHF) Tick, The Daily Intake Guide (%DI), and Glycaemic Index (GI) Symbol. Each of them have a different logo, which may cause confusion among consumers. To prevent this, the Australian Government accepts that an easily understood, uniform FoPL system is needed. The recent Government-funded review of food labelling (led by federal former health minister, Dr Neal Blewett AC) recommended that the Traffic Light System (TLS) be adopted. The Government did not support this as the preferred option. The food industry has also been reluctant to adopt it. With the prevalence of obesity still rising, and the Government still debating the possible benefits of uniform FoPL, food labelling to support healthy food decisions has become a contentious issue...|$|E
