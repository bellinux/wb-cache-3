50|$|There are {{thirteen}} {{instrument approach}} procedures: six {{instrument landing system}} (ILS) approaches, six Global Positioning System approaches (GPS) and one <b>Non-Directional</b> <b>Radio</b> <b>Beacon</b> (NDB) approach. Runways with an ILS are 6L, 24R, 24L and 18; 6L has capabilities for a CAT II and III ILS procedure. GPS approaches are set up on each runway. Runway 6R is the only runway with an NDB approach.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>non-directional</b> (<b>radio)</b> <b>beacon</b> (NDB) is a radio {{transmitter}} at a known location, {{used as an}} aviation or marine navigational aid. As the name implies, the signal transmitted does not include [...] directional information, in contrast to other navigational aids such as low frequency radio range, VHF omnidirectional range (VOR) and TACAN. NDB signals follow the curvature of the Earth, {{so they can be}} received at much greater distances at lower altitudes, a major advantage over VOR. However, NDB signals are also affected more by atmospheric conditions, mountainous terrain, coastal refraction and electrical storms, particularly at long range.|$|E
50|$|There are {{a number}} of coast guard and other {{ship-to-shore}} frequencies in use between 1600 and 2850 kHz. These include, as examples, the French MRCC on 1696 kHz and 2677 kHz, Stornoway Coastguard on 1743 kHz, the US Coastguard on 2670 kHz and Madeira on 2843 kHz. RN Northwood in England broadcasts Weather Fax data on 2618.5 kHz. <b>Non-directional</b> navigational <b>radio</b> <b>beacons</b> (NDBs) for maritime and aircraft navigation occupy a band from 190 to 435 kHz, which overlaps from the LF into the bottom part of the MF band.|$|R
40|$|Objectives: Standard devices used by {{military}} personnel that may pose electromagnetic hazard include: radars, missile systems, radio navigation systems and radio transceivers. The {{aim of this}} study has been to evaluate the exposure of military personnel to electromagnetic fields. Material and Methods: Occupational exposure to electromagnetic fields was analyzed in the work environment of personnel of 204 devices divided into 5 groups (surface-to-air missile system radars, aircraft and helicopters, communication devices, surveillance and height finder radars, airport radars and radio navigation systems). Measurements were carried out at indicators, device terminals, radio panels, above vehicle seats, in vehicle hatches, by cabinets containing high power vacuum tubes and other transmitter components, by transmission lines, connectors, etc. Results: Portable radios emit the electric field strength between 20 – 80 V/m close to a human head. The manpack radio operator’s exposure is 60 – 120 V/m. Inside vehicles with high frequency/very high frequency (HF/VHF) band radios, the electric field strength is between 7 – 30 V/m and inside the radar cabin it ranges between 9 – 20 V/m. Most of the personnel on ships are not exposed to the electromagnetic field from their own radar systems but rather by accidental exposure from the radar systems of other ships. Operators of surface-to-air missile systems are exposed to the electric field strength between 7 – 15 V/m and the personnel of <b>non-directional</b> <b>radio</b> <b>beacons</b> – 100 – 150 V/m. Conclusions: In 57 % of military devices Polish soldiers work in the occupational protection zones. In 35 % of cases, soldiers work in intermediate and hazardous zones and in 22 % – only in the intermediate zone. In 43 % of devices, military personnel are not exposed to electromagnetic field.

50|$|The airport has {{a single}} sealed runway {{measuring}} 1113 x 18 m. Portable runway lighting is available for emergency operation at night. Due to its remote location, air traffic is infrequent {{and there is no}} control tower. Pilots co-ordinate takeoffs and landings using a Common Traffic Advisory Frequency. There is a <b>Non-Directional</b> <b>Beacon</b> <b>radio</b> navigation aid located close to the airport. Fuel is available by arrangement with the ground handling agent. The terminal facilities consist of a basic waiting shelter and a public toilet.|$|R
5000|$|The {{reason for}} abandoning the {{approach}} is unknown. Since the meteorological conditions were close to the minimum permitted for an IFR approach, the aircraft would need to approach close to the ECHO 1 approach trajectory. On the aircraft's improper approach, the investigation noted {{that there was a}} low probability that the aircraft could have stabilized its approach in order to land safely. With a wet runway and if the aircraft crossed the threshold at the reference speed, the aircraft would have a 385 m safety margin to land on the wet runway. There was a 2 kn tailwind {{at the time of the}} attempted landing. Additionally, a <b>non-directional</b> <b>radio</b> <b>beacon</b> (NDB) just before the runway (RR NBD) was non-functional on the day of the accident. Because the aircraft did not follow the ECHO 1 approach, it did not pass the only NBD available for determining the missed approach point, which was SAT NBD. The report concluded that [...] "the fact that the crew did not follow the profile of the ECHO 1 approach, along with their difficulty stabilizing the aircraft on a final approach, and the tail wind component condition may have contributed to their decision to discontinue the approach." ...|$|E

Calculation of indicators of reli- ability for aerodrome {{air traffic control system}} consisting of: Air Traffic Control System (ATCS); radio stations; Radar Landing System (RLS); Azimuth-ranging Radio Beacon (ARRB); Short-Range Decimeter Navigation System (RSBN); <b>Non-directional</b> <b>Radio</b> <b>Beacon</b> (NDB); Automatic Direction Finder (ADF); Airport Lighting Equipment (ALE); Instrument Landing System (ILS).

The scheme of reliability calculation and determined the average time to failure and availability for aerodrome air traffic control system. The ob- tained indicators of reliability for complex systems, in general, slightly worse than the performance of individual compo- nents.
