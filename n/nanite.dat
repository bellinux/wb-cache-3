5|$|The game {{opens with}} a {{terrorist}} attack on Chicago by the Knights Templar; a <b>nanite</b> bomb turns the entire city into grey goo, with the staff and trainees of the city's Tarsus Academy facility barely escaping in time. After relocating to Tarsus' Seattle facility, the city's own Tarsus facility is attacked by soldiers of the Order. Alex, discovering with Billie's help that Tarsus has been observing their trainees in secret {{under the guidance of}} Nassif, escapes the facility and is subsequently offered missions by Tarsus, the Order, the WTO, and the Omar. During these missions, Alex learns that their biomods were created by ApostleCorp, and follows Nassif from Seattle to Cairo, which is being disrupted by fighting between the factions. Alex's fellow students follow different paths during the narrative; Billie initially allies with the Order before joining the Knights Templar, Klara joins the WTO, while Leo becomes involved with the Omar and can become an unwilling convert.|$|E
25|$|One {{year before}} the ongoing modern continuity, Luthor {{arranged}} an illegal smuggling of war machines in Qurac. Knowing that Superman would intervene, Luthor laces the weapons with kryptonite and <b>nanite</b> technology in order to acquire a sample of Superman's DNA {{in order to create}} a monster based on the genetic structure of Superman known as the Hybrid. As Superman seemingly defeats the monster with his ice breath, it is later found out that the Hybrid is attacking Metropolis – whilst also having infected civilians with a virus (that was carried by Superman when he in turn was infected by poison from his earlier tussle with the war machines), as Luthor had intended. The plan by Luthor was to show the people of Metropolis that Superman is indeed an alien menace, and only Luthor can save them from the Man of Steel. The final confrontation between Kal-El and Luthor, of course resulting in the defeat of Lex, was, chronologically, the first fight between two of DC's most famous characters. Luthor was arrested for the Hybrid crisis he orchestrated and now later appears in a one-man prison (designed specifically for him) created by the U.S. government.|$|E
500|$|In a post-credits scene, Megan {{meets with}} Bob Page, the main {{antagonist}} of Deus Ex, to discuss her employment in [...] "the <b>nanite</b> virus chimera" [...] and [...] "D project": prior to this, Page instructs his cohort Morgan Everett {{to search the}} Hyron Project for salvageable technology for the 'Morpheus Initiative': these are the precursors {{to the creation of}} the Denton clones, the manufactured nanotechnological [...] "Gray Death" [...] virus and the [...] "Helios" [...] artificial intelligence, key parts of the plot of Deus Ex.|$|E
50|$|As the {{expected}} {{time of the}} stellar explosion nears, the ship malfunctions in odd ways, and the issue is traced to the computer core. Acting Ensign Wesley Crusher (Wil Wheaton), {{who had been working}} on a project involving microscopic <b>nanites,</b> realizes that he may have inadvertently let two <b>nanites</b> from his experiments loose. The <b>nanites</b> were programmed to find ways to work together and evolve. A scan of the computer core reveals that the <b>nanites</b> have determined a way of replicating themselves and have taken up residence in the computer core. With the computer controls unreliable, the crew and Dr. Stubbs attempt {{to see if they can}} remove the <b>nanites</b> from the core. However, Dr. Stubbs shoots the core with a burst of gamma radiation, destroying a large number of the <b>nanites.</b> They retaliate by flooding the bridge with nitrogen dioxide, which the crew overrides. Dr. Stubbs is confined to quarters, but the <b>nanites</b> attempt further revenge by shocking him with electricity. Captain Picard prepares to flood the computer core with gamma radiation to remove the <b>nanites</b> completely, but the android Second Officer Commander Data (Brent Spiner) establishes communication with the <b>nanites</b> and allows them to use his body to speak with Picard. Picard realizes that the <b>nanites</b> are self-aware and conscious and took Dr. Stubbs' actions as hostile, but they want peace. Picard negotiates a deal to send the <b>nanites</b> to Kavis Alpha IV, designating it as their homeworld. The <b>nanites</b> agree and repair the damage to the computer core before they leave it. Dr. Stubbs launches his probe on time and collects numerous volumes of data. Ensign Crusher, who feels responsible for the incident, is counseled by his mother; both of them realizing he is growing up.|$|R
50|$|In Marvel: Ultimate Alliance 2 (2009), Reed Richards creates <b>nanites</b> {{that are}} meant to control the minds of supervillains. However, the <b>nanites</b> evolve into a group mind called the Fold which serves as the primary {{antagonist}} for the game.|$|R
50|$|The comic {{tells the}} story of how Earth was forever changed after alien <b>nanites</b> arrived in a meteor shower. The <b>nanites,</b> able to shift the {{molecular}} structure of any material, bond with the mind of Bobby Hennigan who initially uses the <b>nanites</b> power to improve life on Earth by building complex machines and curing disease. Unfortunately, Bobby goes crazy, becoming a God-like monster called ‘The Singularity’, destroying everything and forcing humanity to live deep {{beneath the surface of the}} Earth.|$|R
500|$|For {{the plan}} to be successful, the Expedition must also prevent the Asuran ships from {{escaping}} into hyperspace. The Wraith prisoner convinces seven Wraith hive ships to join the Earth ships' attack. Concerned about the Asuran threat, the Travelers under Larrin contribute some of their ships as well. Back on Atlantis, Teyla (Rachel Luttrell) is forced {{to admit that she}} is pregnant, and is pulled off duty. The combined fleet arrives over the Asuran homeworld and engages the enemy fleet, while Fran beams down to the surface and begins to pull the other nanites towards her. However, the <b>nanite</b> mass collapses the power grid, meaning that the ZPMs cannot be overloaded. McKay and Colonel Carter (Amanda Tapping) determine that, if they increase the mass's attraction to the ultra-dense neutronium in the planet's crust, the additional mass will cause it to sink into the core of the planet. The pressure and heat in the core initiates a fusion reaction so that the planet explodes, shortly after the allied fleet escapes. One Asuran ship survives {{at the end of the}} episode, revealing its commander as Elizabeth Weir (Torri Higginson), who notes that their [...] "work" [...] can now begin without interference.|$|E
2500|$|The {{group is}} {{then sent to}} Prison 42 in the Negative Zone where the rebel superheroes and supervillains that have been {{captured}} are held, to get {{a sample of the}} <b>nanite</b> formula. They collect the samples and Fury activates the self-destruct system {{to prevent the spread of}} nanites. Most of the superheroes involved escape, but Fury's fate is unknown. The team learns the nanites survived and have now spread worldwide. As a result, the Superhuman Registration Act is suspended, uniting the two teams. They split into different groups, with the main group traveling to Wakanda, home of Black Panther. They help him defend the country from <b>nanite</b> agents, now under the moniker of [...] "The Fold", and in the process cure Venom and Green Goblin of the nanites. They also discover that Nick Fury has been taken by The Fold. The heroes establish a base in Wakanda, learning that The Fold cannot comprehend Fury's intel on it, making it temporarily safe from <b>nanite</b> attacks. In order to stop The Fold, the heroes infiltrate a base in Iceland to broadcast a <b>nanite</b> stasis signal that will paralyze those in its control, allowing them to be cured. At the culmination of their mission, the team face off against Tinkerer, who was behind The Fold all along, and then a nanite-controlled Nick Fury enhanced with extra nanites. After defeating Fury, every one who was affected is freed from the nanites.|$|E
2500|$|Three {{days later}} during a {{telecast}} of The New Warriors, Nitro creates a large explosion, killing more than 600 {{civilians in the}} process, prompting the immediate implementation of the Superhuman Registration Act. Captain America, opposed to the act, goes underground, along with several other superheroes and S.H.I.E.L.D agents (who have formed a group called [...] "The White Star"). At this point, the story branches into two segments; Anti-Registration and Pro-Registration, depending on player choice. In order to aid them, the Pro-Registration group develops <b>nanite</b> technology {{and use it to}} mind control super villains, increasing their ranks.|$|E

50|$|Dr. Catherine Crabtree : A {{scientist}} {{of highly}} questionable ethics, sanity, and bodily composition. She {{was involved in}} a project to create <b>nanites,</b> tiny robots designed to exist in a person's bloodstream and report all personal information about them to a centralized database, using Kiki as her test-subject. When this failed (when the <b>nanites</b> would spread, they would kill their host), she seemingly put the project on hold. She then seemed to have increasingly experimented on herself with <b>nanites,</b> turning her into some form of cyborg. She was eventually destroyed by an EMP blast of Aylee's, shutting down all of her <b>nanites</b> and liquefying her. During the course of her appearance of the comics, she never was a major threat, but rather attempted sneaking up on Kiki and the others, only to have her plans thwarted before anyone noticed she was there.|$|R
5000|$|This {{new world}} is post-apocalyptic, filled with monsters, {{poisonous}} gases, and the <b>nanites,</b> {{which are now}} used to devour human flesh. The only things {{able to go to}} the surface are the [...] "Gosiodo" [...] - part man / part machine creatures connected to the hive mind of the Singularity and sent out to hunt down the remaining humans, and [...] "Specials" [...] - rare humans who, when exposed to the <b>nanites</b> are mysteriously not killed and instead bond with the <b>nanites,</b> giving them access to strange powers and the ability to survive on the surface.|$|R
2500|$|On the {{television}} show Mystery Science Theater 3000, the Nanites (voiced variously by Kevin Murphy, Paul Chaplin, Mary Jo Pehl, and Bridget Jones) - are self-replicating, bio-engineered organisms that work on the ship, they are microscopic creatures that reside in the Satellite of Love's computer systems. (They {{are similar to the}} creatures in [...] episode [...] "Evolution", which featured [...] "nanites" [...] taking over the Enterprise.) The Nanites made their first appearance in season 8. Based on the concept of nanotechnology, their comical deus ex machina activities included such diverse tasks as instant repair and construction, hairstyling, performing a <b>Nanite</b> variation of a flea circus, conducting a microscopic war, and even destroying the Observers' planet after a dangerously vague request from Mike to [...] "take care of [...] little problem". They also ran a microbrewery.|$|E
50|$|Back at base Ben and Rex explain each other's origins, as White Knight {{reveals that}} Alpha {{has gone to}} the Bug Jar, which is full of EVOs for it to absorb. Rex, White Knight, and Ben arrive, only to find {{themselves}} against the nearly invincible Alpha, which begins to attack to take control of Rex's Omega <b>Nanite.</b> Ben fights as XLR8 and Fourarms. During the battle, Ben gains the form of Shocksquatch, but then temporarily loses his powers when Alpha copies the Ultimatrix and takes on <b>Nanite</b> powered versions of Heatblast, Fourarms, and Humungousaur. After a tough battle, Rex is able to disable Alpha's imitation Omnitrix powers, but is ensnared and robbed of his Omega <b>Nanite,</b> leading to <b>Nanite</b> Alpha to transform into a colossal being calling itself Alpha-Omega; the beginning and the end. As the now nearly unstoppable Alpha-Omega rampages, Rex has doubts about himself now that most of his builds are gone. Ben however comes up with a plan, and transforms into Upgrade and merges with Rex. The duo then take on the Alpha-Omega, weakening it enough for Rex to finally condense Alpha into a sphere of matter that weighs several tons. As Alpha was being condensed, Caesar appears and extracts the Omega <b>Nanite.</b> Attempting to dispose of Alpha, Caesar then opens a rift for Ben, who changes into Upchuck and devours the compacted Alpha as he heads back to his world. Rex returns to base, one last time, to find himself with a revived Agent Six. Caesar injects the Omega <b>Nanite</b> into Rex, as Alpha, now in the Null Void, begins to stir within its prison of matter, meaning it is not over yet.|$|E

5000|$|Wakanda {{appears as}} a {{location}} in Marvel: Ultimate Alliance 2. When the control <b>nanites</b> start to infect the world, Wakanda {{is one of its}} victims when The Fold absorbs some mercenaries into its ranks. After taking out Havok, A-Bomb, and Justice, the heroes make their way to Black Panther's palace where they end up discovering that Nick Fury has fallen victim to the control <b>nanites</b> and then end up defeating The Fold-absorbed Wakandans led by Green Goblin and Venom III. When Green Goblin and Venom III are defeated, Black Panther's palace serves as a hub since Stark Tower has fallen under the control of The Fold, as the <b>nanites</b> cannot comprehend Fury's files on Wakanda. When the heroes are fighting Tinkerer at the Repeater Tower in Iceland, Wakanda is attacked by The Fold until the jamming signal is unleashed, thus neutralizing the <b>nanites</b> and saving the world.|$|R
50|$|Since Madripoor she {{has added}} a tail (similar to Mac Gargan's) to her costume with a stinger that injects S.P.I.N. tech <b>nanites</b> after ingesting the {{contents}} of the dart that she stole from Hardball. The effects only last half-an-hour. Since she said the source of the <b>nanites</b> is her body it is hinted that unlike the previous Scorpion, her tail might be semi-organic.|$|R

After hearing him out, Destro and Lilian stage a coup, and take the Commander prisoner. Using the <b>nanites</b> on the Commander and all the former Cobra agents (save Zartan), Destro is able to secure his hold over the organization, and effect the reunification the Commander had hoped for. Manipulating {{all the members of}} Cobra, Destro unleashes the <b>nanites</b> on the United States, very nearly taking over. It is only because of the intervention of the G.I. Joe team (who were reinstated when the Commander returned to U.S. soil), and Cobra Commander (who was freed from the prison by Storm Shadow, and cured of the <b>nanites)</b> that Destro fails in his bid for domination. When the <b>nanites</b> are defeated, the real Destro is freed from his paralyzed state just in time to greet Alex and Lilian, who are imprisoned after the Baroness rescues them from their losing battle.|$|R
