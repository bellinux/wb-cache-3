5|$|An Admiralty {{memorandum}} set out {{the detailed}} instructions. The first requirement was to resolve disagreements in the earlier surveys about the longitude of Rio de Janeiro, which was essential as the base point for meridian distances. The accurate marine chronometers <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> longitude had only become affordable since 1800; the Beagle carried 22 chronometers to allow corrections. The ship was to stop at specified points for four-day rating of the chronometers and to check them by astronomical observations: it was essential to take observations at Porto Praya and Fernando de Noronha to calibrate against the previous surveys of Owen and Foster. It was important to survey {{the extent of the}} Abrolhos Archipelago reefs, shown incorrectly in Roussin's survey, then proceed to Rio de Janeiro to decide the exact longitude of Villegagnon Island.|$|E
5|$|Heart {{disease is}} listed by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services {{as the number}} one {{cause of death for}} all women. Factors that add to risk of heart disease include obesity and smoking, both of which are more {{prevalent}} in lesbians. Studies show that lesbians have a higher body mass and are generally less concerned about weight issues than heterosexual women, and lesbians consider women with higher body masses to be more attractive than heterosexual women do. Lesbians are more likely to exercise regularly than heterosexual women, and lesbians do not generally exercise for aesthetic reasons, although heterosexual women do.

5|$|Meanwhile, former Ohio Works {{players in}} Zanesville quickly regained their momentum.

5|$|In late 2006, the Jamul Indian tribe {{prepared}} {{to construct a}} casino, but many expressed concerns {{about the amount of}} traffic that would now travel on SR 94. In 2007, Caltrans declared that the construction required a permit to connect to SR94 and to construct on the state right-of-way. At the end of the year, the tribe had started construction on the driveway to the casino, while Caltrans stated that it lacked the information <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> if the proposed traffic signal should be approved. In late 2009, the tribe filed a lawsuit against Caltrans over the inability to get approval to connect the driveway with the highway. The tribe made the claim that they were a sovereign nation and did not need the approval, but this was rejected by the court. Caltrans and the tribe came to an agreement in 2009, where the tribe would provide its own studies and pay for environmental mitigation.|$|E

5|$|The rufous-crowned sparrow {{is treated}} as a species of least concern, or not {{threatened}} with extinction, by BirdLife International due to its large geographical range of about , estimated population of 2.4million individuals, and lack of a 30% population decline over the last ten years. In years without sufficient rains, many birds fail to breed {{and those that do}} produce fewer offspring. Some of the local populations of this bird are threatened and declining in number. The island subspecies and populations have declined in some cases: A. r. sanctorum of the Todos Santos Islands is believed to be extinct, and the populations on Santa Catalina Island and Baja California's Islas de San Martin have not been observed since the early 1900s. Populations of the species in southern California are also becoming more restricted in range because of urbanization and agricultural development in the region. Additionally, the sparrow is known to have been poisoned by the rodenticide warfarin, though more research is <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> the effects of pesticides on the rufous-crowned sparrow.|$|E
5|$|Phase Shifting Interferometry {{addresses}} {{several issues}} associated with the classical analysis of static interferograms. Classically, one measures {{the positions of the}} fringe centers. As seen in Fig.13, fringe deviations from straightness and equal spacing provide a measure of the aberration. Errors in determining the location of the fringe centers provide the inherent limit to precision of the classical analysis, and any intensity variations across the interferogram will also introduce error. There is a trade-off between precision and number of data points: closely spaced fringes provide many data points of low precision, while widely spaced fringes provide a low number of high precision data points. Since fringe center data is all that one uses in the classical analysis, all of the other information that might theoretically be obtained by detailed analysis of the intensity variations in an interferogram is thrown away. Finally, with static interferograms, additional information is <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> the polarity of the wavefront: In Fig.13, one can see that the tested surface on the right deviates from flatness, but one cannot tell from this single image whether this deviation from flatness is concave or convex. Traditionally, this information would be obtained using non-automated means, such as by observing the direction that the fringes move when the reference surface is pushed.|$|E
