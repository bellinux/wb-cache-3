50|$|For the {{critically}} endangered Chile/Peru population, the Cetacean Conservation Center (CCC) {{has been working}} on a separate program for right whales. This population, containing no more than 50 or less individuals, is under threats of increasing ship lanes and fishing industries. 124 sightings in total had been recorded during 1964-2008 period. Aside from vagrants' records, Peru's coastlines possibly host one of the northernmost confirmed range of the species along with Gabon, Senegal, Tanzania, Brazilian coasts, Madagascar, Indian Ocean, western Australia, Kermadec Islands, and tropical waters including South Pacific Islands. The Alfaguara project targeting cetaceans in Chiloe may possibly target this species as well in the future since calving activities have been confirmed in Chiloé Archipelago. Foraging grounds of this population is currently undetected, but possibly Chiloé and down south of Caleta Zorra to southern fiords such as from Penas Gulf to Beagle Channel although <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>confirmations</b> are small in the Beagle Channel..

40|$|Long and Sato (1983), in an {{examination}} of ESL teachers' questions in the classroom, found that teachers ask significatly more display questions, which request information already known by the questioner, than referential questions, which reuqest information not known by the questioner. The main {{purpose of the present}} study was to test for some possible effects on adult ESL classroom discourse of higher frequencies of referential questions. Foir experienced ESL teachers and 24 non-native speakers (NNSs) enrolled in the University of Hawaii's English Language Institute participated in this experimental study. Two of the teachers were provided with training in referential questions; the other two teachers formed a control group not provided with training. All four teachers taught the same reading and vocabulary lesson to one group each of six NNSs. It was hypothesized, on the basis of first language classroom research on attempts to increase the cognitive level of teachers' questions, that teachers could, with training, increase their use of referential questions. It was further hypothesized, on the basis of first language classroom research on the effect on student reponses of higher cognitive questions, that NNSs' responses to referential questions would be longer and more syntactically complex than their responses to display questions. The above hypotheses were supported by the results obtained. Not supported by the data were hypotheses predicting greater <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>confirmation</b> checks and clarification requests accompanying greater <b>number</b> <b>of</b> questions...|$|R

The results showed that (1) SCR did not differ among concepts; (2) SCR varied with type of feedback, it being smallest at blanks and largest at infirming feedback; (3) SC'R was related to the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>confirmations</b> preceding infirmation; (4) subjects mainly used the strategy 'reject hypothesis only after information'; (5) subjects usually selected not-yet-tested hypotheses; (6) practice influenced performance; (7) verbalization did not result in more efficient use of information; however, the appropriateness of the experimental set-up to study this factor was questioned; (8) conjunction was easier to learn than the other concepts.

Sera were tested for IgM by both indirect and capture enzyme immunoassays (EIAs), and oral fluids were tested for IgM by a capture EIA. Tests for IgM in serum were more sensitive for the confirmation of rubella than the test for IgM in oral fluid during the 4 days after rash onset. RT-PCR confirmed more suspected cases than serum IgM tests on days 1 and 2 after rash onset. The methods confirmed approximately the same number of cases on days 3 and 4 after rash onset.

40|$|A {{retrospective}} {{research study}} was conducted to determine the effectiveness of the Drug Evaluation and Classification Program (DECP) procedures in order to identify subjects under the influence of specific drug categories. The investigator wanted to determine if the procedures are reliable and whether a drug recognition expert (DRE) can properly apply the DECP procedures to consistently identify the drug category and have that opinion supported by toxicology. A total of 324 enforcement drug influence evaluations (DIEs) were obtained from the DRE data tracking system (DRE-DTS) that is maintained through the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). Toxicology results related to each DIE were compared to the DRE??s drug category prediction. The objectives of the study were to determine if the 12 -step DECP process enables DREs to identify drug categories and those most frequently identified and confirmed in Texas. Using the DECP, the DRE??s ability to identify specific drugs according to categories and to have the identification supported by toxicology was moderately accurate at best. Of the 324 evaluations that had toxicology results, the DRE correctly identified drug categories as follows: depressants, 60. 5 %; stimulants, 32 %; hallucinogens, 12 %; PCP, 46. 6 %; narcotic analgesics, 51. 6 %; inhalants, 14. 2 %; and cannabis, 64. 9 %. To determine which drug categories were called most frequently, the enforcement DIEs were analyzed according to each specific category. The investigator found the following drug categories were most frequently called by DREs who evaluated subjects: depressants, 182; cannabis, 142; narcotic analgesics, 83; stimulants, 62; PCP, 18; inhalants, 4; and hallucinogens, 1.

The investigator was able to determine, based on the DRE-DTS data, that Texas DREs are only moderately accurate in identifying drug categories when utilizing the DECP procedures in enforcement settings.

In the past decades controlled virtual environments have increasingly gained more importance in education, especially since-as Presky defines them- the appearance of “digital natives”: individuals who have implemented technology in their communication processes from a very early age, mainly born in the late 80 s and 90 s.

40|$|Deaths due to {{influenza}} and pneumonia for the 108 reporting {{cities of}} the United States showed a decrease 839 from the figure of 847 for last week. With the single exception of the Florida report of a community-wide epidemic of influenza-like disease (see Influenza Surveillance Report No. 36), {{which has not been}} confirmed as due to the Asian strain, we have no reports of epidemic influenza occurring on a large scale during the past two months. There is, however, increasing evidence that the Asian strain is still prevalent {{in many parts of the}} country. A <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>confirmations</b> from small outbreaks have been reported to this Unit recently. These are summarized in the current report. In addition, several dozen deaths following complications of confirmed Asian strain influenza have been reported to us since early February. It is apparent that school-age and young adult populations are not being significantly affected by influenza at this time. A review of industrial absenteeism in this report suggests that the susceptible industrial populations were exhausted in the fall. The same is true for the children of school-age. On the other hand, the susceptibles of the older population, relatively isolated from contact with the highly affected population groups of the fall, were apparently not exhausted by January. Deaths from influenza and pneumonia since January 1 have occurred predominantly among the oldest segments of the population. " - p. 2 I. Summary of information [...] II.

40|$|Formestane (4 -hydroxy-androstenedione) is an {{aromatase}} inhibitor prohibited {{in sports}} and included, since 2004, {{in the list of}} prohibited substances updated yearly by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA). Since the endogenous production of formestane has been described, it is mandatory for the anti-doping laboratories to use isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) to establish the exogenous origin before issuing an adverse analytical finding. The described IRMS methods for formestane detection are time-consuming, requiring usually two consecutive liquid chromatographic sample purifications in order to have final extracts of adequate purity before the mass spectrometric analysis. After establishing a procedure for the determination of the origin of formestane by IRMS without the need of derivatization, and integrated in the overall analytical strategy of the laboratory for pseudo-endogenous steroids, a mass spectrometric analysis by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS) of formestane metabolites was carried out in order to investigate whether other biomarkers of formestane abuse could be integrated in order to avoid time-consuming and expensive IRMS confirmations for formestane.
