5|$|Athenian {{girls were}} not {{formally}} educated; instead, their mothers taught them the domestic skills <b>necessary</b> <b>for</b> running a household. Formal education for boys consisted of rhetoric, <b>necessary</b> <b>for</b> effective political participation, {{and physical education}} in preparation for military service. These skills were not considered <b>necessary</b> <b>for</b> women, who were barred from learning them. Classical art indicates that girls and boys played with toys such as spinning tops, hoops, and seesaws, and played games such as piggyback. The gravestone of Plangon, an Athenian girl aged about five {{which is in the}} Glyptothek museum in Munich, shows her holding a doll; a set of knucklebones hangs on a wall in the background.|$|E

5|$|Contrary to all expectations, a {{significant}} amount of support for the young Queen came from Hungary.

5|$|In {{assisted}} reproductive technology, sperm washing is not <b>necessary</b> <b>for</b> {{males with}} hepatitis B to prevent transmission, unless the female partner {{has not been}} effectively vaccinated.

5|$|In {{fish and}} other wildlife, {{selenium}} is <b>necessary</b> <b>for</b> life, but toxic in high doses. For salmon, the optimal concentration of selenium is about 1 microgram selenium per gram of whole body weight.

5|$|Migration {{in birds}} is highly labile and is {{believed}} to have developed independently in many avian lineages. While it is agreed that the behavioral and physiological adaptations <b>necessary</b> <b>for</b> migration are under genetic control, some authors have argued that no genetic change is <b>necessary</b> <b>for</b> migratory behavior to develop in a sedentary species because the genetic framework for migratory behavior exists in nearly all avian lineages. This explains the rapid appearance of migratory behavior after the most recent glacial maximum.|$|E
