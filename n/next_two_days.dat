Over the <b>next</b> <b>two</b> <b>days</b> the allies {{completed}} the gun placements and dragged the artillery into line. The British fire began to weaken {{when they saw the}} large number of guns the allies had.|$|E

5|$|A {{break in}} the weather allowed the RAF to finally fly combat {{missions}} against the German forces surrounding Urquhart's men. Hawker Typhoons and Republic P-47 Thunderbolts strafed German positions throughout the day and occasionally dueled with the Luftwaffe over the battlefield. The RAF attempted their final resupply flight from Britain on the Saturday afternoon, but lost eight planes for little gain to the Airborne troops. Some small resupply efforts would be made from Allied airfields in Europe over the <b>next</b> <b>two</b> <b>days</b> but to little effect.|$|E

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved into}} the Pacific Ocean from Central America on September 10. Convection along the wave became better organized as it moved westward, and a tropical depression developed on September 18. The depression moved generally west-northwestward before strengthening into Tropical Storm Marty on September 19. The storm entrained dry air into its circulation as it curved toward the northwest, disrupting the storm's convective structure and inhibiting further intensification for the <b>next</b> <b>two</b> <b>days.</b> Eventually, Marty fought off the dry air and intensified, reaching hurricane strength on September 21.|$|E
5|$|After {{reaching}} peak intensity, Frances began tracking over cooler SST's, which gradually {{weakened the}} storm.

One sailor was reported missing, however, {{it is unknown}} if it was {{as a result of}} Frances. In addition, one person on a sailboat suffered injuries during an encounter with Frances. On land, Frances caused minimal impact, limited to light rainfall across Newfoundland.|$|E

The following week, in several Australian APN News & Media outlets, an op-ed piece repeated the $75 trillion figure, erroneously calculated from $150,000 × 11,000 infringed works (which actually comes to $1.65 billion).|$|R

50|$|Struggling Fulham were Stoke's <b>next</b> opponents <b>two</b> <b>days</b> later. Fulham defender Chris Baird {{opened the}} scoring after just four minutes when his shot took a wicked {{deflection}} off the post.

Ewiniar turned northward and brushed eastern China, forcing evacuations in many cities.|$|E

The Romans chased them, plundered the Galatian camp as the surviving Galatians fled across the river to join the women, children and the Trocmi.|$|E
5|$|The attack {{force was}} placed on alert to launch what had been {{designated}} Operation Paravane on 8 September.

He was last seen working a machine-gun single-handed, was wounded a third time and eventually taken prisoner.|$|R

USS Bunker Hill and Hancock were also detached from TG 38.2 at this time, leaving Intrepid the sole Essex-class aircraft carrier in its group.
