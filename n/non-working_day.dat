40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to develop and evaluate a statistical model to predict the number of <b>non-working</b> <b>days</b> for highway construction projects in Brazos County, Texas, based on the historical weather data and Daily Work Reports. A 2 nd order, linear regression model was developed that can be used by contractors to estimate the number of <b>non-working</b> <b>days</b> for any highway construction project in Brazos, County. The variables considered in the model were monthly average precipitation, temperature, wind speed, and number of weekend days and holidays per month. Interactions between the weather variables were also considered in an attempt to improve model effectiveness. With an accuracy of about 95 % and an adjusted R-square near 80 %, this model provides a relatively easy, valid and powerful method to predict project duration.

Methods: The study was carried out between May and June 2013 and included a total of 277 healthy women aged 18 – 48 years from five governorates in Oman. Total, moderate and vigorous PA levels and walking were self-reported by participants using the short form of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire.
