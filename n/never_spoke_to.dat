5|$|For unknown reasons, Tréhot stopped {{modeling}} for Renoir after 1872; it {{was said}} that she <b>never</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> or saw him again. Although Tréhot was an important part of Renoir's early career, he never mentioned her in any published interviews, memoirs, or biographies.|$|E
5|$|It was {{reported}} that the plan to rid Richter of the title was concocted by WWF Chairman Vince McMahon, who brought in Moolah after Richter refused to sign a new contract with the WWF. Richter, however, claims she was still under her original five-year contract, but that she regularly had disagreements with McMahon about her compensation. She also claims that when {{she arrived at the}} arena that day, she was surprised to find Moolah backstage, as she never showed up to events at which she was not scheduled to wrestle. After the match, an infuriated Richter left the arena in her wrestling gear, took a cab to the airport, and booked herself on a flight out of New York. Afterward, she <b>never</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> Moolah again.|$|E

Brand announced on December 30, 2011, that they were divorcing after 14 months of marriage. Perry later stated that conflicting career schedules and his desire to have children before she was ready led {{to the end of}} their marriage, and that he <b>never</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> her again after sending a text message that he was divorcing her while Brand asserted that he divorced her due to her commercial success and reluctance to engage in activism. She was initially distraught over their divorce, and said that she contemplated suicide. After the marriage ended in 2012, Perry began a relationship with singer John Mayer that August.|$|E

5|$|Some {{historians are}} {{convinced}} that by 1964 Mikoyan believed that Khrushchev {{had turned into a}} liability to the Party, and that he was involved in the October 1964 coup that brought Brezhnev and Alexei Kosygin to power. However, William Taubman disputes this, as Mikoyan was {{the only member of the}} Presidium (the name for the Politburo at this time) to defend Khrushchev. Mikoyan, however, did vote to force Khrushchev's retirement (so as, in traditional Soviet style, to make the vote unanimous). Alone among Khrushchev's colleagues, Mikoyan wished the former leader well in his retirement, though he <b>never</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> him again. Mikoyan laid a wreath and sent a letter of condolence at Khrushchev's funeral in 1971.|$|E
5|$|Washington was not {{a member}} of any {{political}} party and hoped {{that they would not be}} formed, fearing conflict that would undermine republicanism. His closest advisors formed two factions, setting the framework for the future First Party System. Secretary of Treasury Alexander Hamilton had bold plans to establish the national credit and to build a financially powerful nation, and he formed the basis of the Federalist Party. Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson was the founder of the Jeffersonian Republicans, and he strenuously opposed Hamilton's agenda. Washington typically favored Hamilton over Jefferson, and it was Hamilton's agenda that went into effect. Jefferson's political actions, his support of Philip Freneau's National Gazette, and his attempt to undermine Hamilton nearly led George Washington to dismiss him from his cabinet, though he ultimately left the cabinet voluntarily. Washington never forgave him and <b>never</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> him again.|$|E

25|$|Around 1942 or 1943, her {{relationship}} with Metcalf had deteriorated to a breaking point due to Wood's unfaithful sexual activities and lack of any gainful employment. Metcalf offered Wood money {{to move out of}} their shared house and effectively ended their sixteen-year relationship. Once the separation was complete, Metcalf reportedly <b>never</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> Wood again, even when Wood, dying, is said to have requested to see her.|$|E
25|$|Carson {{reportedly}} loathed what {{he perceived}} as disloyalty, {{and he was}} furious when former Tonight Show guest hosts John Davidson and Joan Rivers got their own talk shows. Rivers' show on Fox Network directly competed with Carson during the 1986–1987 season before being cancelled. On June 24, 2009, following Ed McMahon's death, Rivers lauded McMahon on Larry King Live, but said that after she got her own show, Carson <b>never</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> her again.|$|E

25|$|Crosby's mother invited Mrs. Richard Rogers Peabody (née Mary Phelps Jacob) to {{chaperone}} Crosby {{and some}} of his friends at a picnic on July 4, 1920, including dinner and a trip to the amusement park at Nantasket Beach. During dinner, Crosby <b>never</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> the girl on his left, breaking decorum. By some accounts, Crosby {{fell in love with the}} buxom Mrs. Peabody in about two hours, confessing his love for her in the Tunnel of Love at the amusement park. Two weeks later they went to church together in Manchester-by-the-Sea and spent the night together. Their public relationship was a scandal among blue-blood Boston.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Gaston Méliès {{had taken}} his family and a film crew of over twenty people to Tahiti {{in the summer of}} 1912. For the rest of that year and well into 1913, he {{traveled}} throughout the South Pacific and Asia, and sent film footage back to his son in New York. The footage was often damaged or otherwise unusable, and Gaston was no longer able to fulfill Star Films' obligation to Thomas Edison's company. By the end of his travels, Gaston Méliès had lost $50,000 and had to sell the American branch of Star Films to Vitagraph Studios. Gaston eventually returned to Europe and died in 1915. He and Georges Méliès <b>never</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> one another again.|$|E
25|$|Soon after {{returning}} from France, Jefferson accepted Washington's invitation to serve as Secretary of State. Jefferson had initially expected to return to France, but Washington insisted that he be on his new Cabinet. Pressing issues at this time were the national debt and the permanent location of the capital. Jefferson opposed a national debt, preferring that each state retire its own, in contrast to Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton, who desired consolidation of various states' debts by the federal government. Hamilton also had bold plans to establish the national credit and a national bank, but Jefferson strenuously opposed this and attempted to undermine his agenda, which nearly led Washington to dismiss him from his cabinet. Jefferson later left the cabinet voluntarily; Washington never forgave him, and <b>never</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> him again.|$|E

25|$|The {{following}} year (in July 1934), they visited Angola once again. This time Lead Belly begged {{them to make}} a recording of a song he had written to take to the Governor requesting parole, which they did. However, unbeknownst to them, Lead Belly was released in August for good time (and because of cost-cutting due to the Depression) and not because of the Lomaxes' recording, which the Governor may not have listened to. In September 1934, Lead Belly wrote to Lomax requesting employment, since he needed to have a job in order not to be sent back to prison. At the urging of John Jr., Lomax engaged Lead Belly as his driver and assistant, and the pair traveled the South together collecting folk songs for the next three months. Then, in December 1934, Lead Belly famously performed illustrating John Lomax's scheduled lecture of folk songs at a smoker and sing-along held at the national MLA meeting in Philadelphia (see Lead Belly). Their association continued for three more months until the following March (1935). In January, Lomax, who knew nothing whatever about the recording business, became Lead Belly's manager and, through a friend, cowboy singer Tex Ritter, got Lead Belly a recording contract with the famous A man Art Satherly of ARC records. Satherly had publicity photos made of the singer wearing overalls and sitting on sacks of grain, garb and setting that were customary in commercial publicity photos of country singers in those days. But Lead Belly's recordings, marketed as race music, failed to sell. A filmed re-enactment in early 1935 for The March of Time newsreel of Lomax's discovery of Lead Belly in prison, led to the myth that John Lomax made Lead Belly perform in prison stripes (which is inaccurate). He did perform in overalls, however. During Lomax's two-week lecture tour with Lead Belly on the eastern college circuit in March 1935 (pre-scheduled by Lomax before teaming up with Lead Belly), the two men quarreled over money and <b>never</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> one another again.|$|E

500|$|Federico Fellini was Allen's {{first choice}} {{to appear in}} the cinema lobby scene because his films were under discussion, but Allen chose {{cultural}} academic Marshall McLuhan after both Fellini and Luis Buñuel declined the cameo.

The director [...] "acted coldly" [...] towards McLuhan, who had to return from Canada for reshooting, and Mordecai Lawner, who played Alvy's father, claimed that Allen <b>never</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>to</b> him. However, during the production, Allen began a two-year relationship with Stacey Nelkin, who appears in a single scene.|$|E
500|$|The news of {{her death}} {{produced}} sincere mourning in Brazil.

I saw many extremist republicans do the same." [...] He continued: [...] "They called her {{the mother of the}} Brazilians, and we all really attributed to her a kind of a filial veneration. That is the truth." ...|$|E
