500|$|Michael Westmore was {{responsible}} for taking Probert's designs for the Ferengi and creating the make-up for the actors to meet that design. In Probert's original concept, the Ferengi had ears which were pointed like a bat. There were concerns from the producers that these would appear simply to be larger versions of the already known Vulcan ears, and so Westmore was told to round off the ears {{when it came to}} producing the make-up. Other elements which were changed at the make-up stage included modifications to the nose to increase the volume of wrinkles and dropping the idea of an extended chin as Westmore thought it would save time in applying the make-up. A set of false upper teeth were also created, which were added to a single head piece and a <b>nose</b> <b>piece</b> which comprised the prosthetics for the Ferengi. Westmore was not pleased when a shot of an actor in costume was leaked without the teeth, he said [...] "I was annoyed about that photo because the make-up was incomplete. After all the work that went into it, we would have wanted our design in proper form. The photo was like a pirated version of our make-up, because none of us would ever approved it under those circumstances." [...] Michael Okuda designed a rank designation tattoo which Westmore applied to the right part of each Ferengi forehead. The symbol means [...] "Dog eat dog" [...] and was painted green as that is the colour of American dollar bills. Each bar (referred to by the production crew as a [...] "rocker") {{to the side of the}} symbol designated a rank, with more bars meaning a higher rank.|$|E

The <b>nose</b> <b>piece</b> was only part of the innovation. The Charger Daytona also received a [...] tall wing in rear. This wing was bolted through the rear quarter panels and into the rear subframe. Although proven to be less effective than shorter wing designs, the engineer responsible {{for the development of the}} wing, John Pointer, chose the tall design so the wing would be in [...] "clean air" [...] to help increase the car's overall speed. That the tall wing prevents interference with operation of the trunk lid can be considered a fortunate coincidence. The tall wing also helped out in another unintended way, by giving the car directional stability due to its deeply splinted sides.|$|E
2500|$|The Dyott was a single-seat, mid-wing {{monoplane}} {{of clean}} appearance for its day. [...] The fuselage was built up around four longerons. [...] These were of ash in the stressed region from wing spars to engine, spruce {{at the rear}} and internally wire braced. [...] Stringers behind the cockpit formed a smooth rounded decking under the overall fabric covering. The forward fuselage, including the cockpit was aluminium clad, with a neat <b>nose</b> <b>piece</b> over the 7-cylinder, 50hp (37kW) Gnome rotary engine, more to protect the pilot from oil than for streamlining. Steel tubing was used in several places: the empennage was steel framed, as was [...] the pilot's seat, and steel tubes formed the vertical undercarriage members. [...] There were four of the latter, each pair mounting a short wooden skid with steel cross bracing and a single axle on shock absorbers carrying a pair of wheels. [...] The undercarriage was initially completed with a long sprung tail skid, later replaced by a shorter cane skid mounted further aft. At the same time, Dyott made some changes to the transverse bracing of the main undercarriage.|$|E

40|$|The National Synchrotron Light Source-II (NSLS-II) {{storage ring}} at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) will be {{equipped}} with 54 dipole magnets having a gap of 35 mm, and 6 dipoles having a gap of 90 mm. Each dipole has a field of 0. 4 T and provides 6 degrees of bending for a 3 GeV electron beam. The large aperture magnets are necessary to allow the extraction of long-wavelength light from the dipole magnet to serve {{a growing number of}} users of low energy radiation. The dipoles must not only have good field homogeneity (0. 015 % over a 40 mm x 20 mm region), but the integral transfer functions and integral end harmonics of the two types of magnets must also be matched. The 35 mm aperture dipole has a novel design where the yoke ends are extended up to the outside dimension of the coil using magnetic steel <b>nose</b> <b>pieces.</b> This design increases the effective length of the dipole without increasing the physical length. These <b>nose</b> <b>pieces</b> can be tailored to adjust the integral transfer function as well as the homogeneity of the integrated field. One prototype of each dipole type has been fabricated to validate the designs and to study matching of the two dipoles. A Hall probe mapping system has been built with three Group 3 Hall probes mounted on a 2 -D translation stage. The probes are arranged with one probe in the midplane of the magnet and the others vertically offset by {+-} 10 mm. The field is mapped around a nominal 25 m radius beam trajectory. The results of measurements in the as-received magnets, and with modifications made to the <b>nose</b> <b>pieces</b> are presented...|$|R

5000|$|The {{fundamental}} {{design of}} a Brooks saddle is a leather top stretched between a metal [...] "cantle plate" [...] at the rear and a <b>nose</b> <b>piece,</b> {{to which it is}} attached with steel or copper rivets. Using a threaded bolt, the <b>nose</b> <b>piece</b> can be moved forward independently of the rails, tensioning the leather. It is important not to over-tension the leather or it may tear, especially at the rivets. Normally the nose bolt should not be adjusted unless the saddle becomes noticeably sagged, in which case it should only be adjusted in fractions of a turn until the top is comfortable again.|$|E
5000|$|The {{first step}} in {{building}} a set of Swedish goggles is to construct a <b>nose</b> <b>piece.</b> Nose pieces can feature a variety of designs, {{some of the most}} popular are the included string threaded through the included rubber tube, a short length of the included strap (which is much more easily adjusted than the string), or simply using the string as a <b>nose</b> <b>piece.</b> For nose pieces using the string and tube, a pair of tweezers can be used to guide the string through the small holes located on the inside of the frames, as well as into the rubber tube. A small knot is then tied by hand and threaded into the tube.|$|E

Nose piercing is still popular in India and the subcontinent. The piercings are often an integral part of Indian wedding jewelry. In Maharashtra women wear very large intricate <b>nose</b> <b>pieces</b> that often cover the mouth or the side of the face.|$|R
5000|$|Oakley {{was started}} by James Jannard in 1975 out of his garage with an initial {{investment}} of $300. The name [...] "Oakley" [...] came from Jim's English Setter, [...] "Oakley Anne." [...] Jannard began by selling what he called 'The Oakley Grip' {{out of the back}} of his car at motocross events. His motorcycle grips were unlike other grips available at the time, using a trademarked material known as 'Unobtainium'('Unobtanium'), a unique creation by Jannard. The material is still used to make the earsocks on Oakley glasses, and many of the <b>nose</b> <b>pieces</b> and now the bands of their watches. Oakley went on to produce number plates, gloves, grips, elbow guards, chin guards, and goggles for the BMX and motocross communities.After selling Oakely Inc. to Italian Eyeware company Luxottica Group in 2007, founder James Jannard went on to found Red Digital Cinema.|$|R

25|$|The guecha warriors enjoyed special {{privileges}} and were considered a higher {{class of the}} society. They ranked below the priests, but above the general people. Both Pedro Simón and Lucas Fernández de Piedrahita describe the guecha warriors as strong and brave men, recruited from {{the people in the}} various villages of the Muisca Confederation. They went through years of training in combat before being assigned as guecha warrior. Their appearance was different from the other people, of which the men had long hair. To be more efficient and safer in battle, the guecha warriors cut their hair short. While jewellery was not common among the general people, and after installation of the Code of Nemequene even prohibited, the guecha warriors wore jewels such as golden or tumbaga <b>nose</b> <b>pieces,</b> pectorals, earrings and crowns with coloured feathers. The amount of earrings would indicate the number of enemies beaten. Their bodies were painted using inks from the Genipa americana tree.|$|R

50|$|At {{the lower}} end of a typical {{compound}} optical microscope, there are one or more objective lenses that collect light from the sample. The objective is usually in a cylinder housing containing a glass single or multi-element compound lens. Typically there will be around three objective lenses screwed into a circular <b>nose</b> <b>piece</b> which may be rotated to select the required objective lens. These arrangements are designed to be parfocal, which means that when one changes from one lens to another on a microscope, the sample stays in focus. Microscope objectives are characterized by two parameters, namely, magnification and numerical aperture. The former typically ranges from 5× to 100× while the latter ranges from 0.14 to 0.7, corresponding to focal lengths of about 40 to 2 mm, respectively. Objective lenses with higher magnifications normally have a higher numerical aperture and a shorter depth of field in the resulting image. Some high performance objective lenses may require matched eyepieces to deliver the best optical performance.|$|E

50|$|With the {{delivery}} of new Boeing 787 long-haul aircraft in 2011/12, LOT introduced a new livery. This design is intended to retain the tradition and spirit of LOT {{and there will be}} no major or radical changes to the livery applied to the airline's planes. The most obvious will be the elimination of the blue <b>nose</b> <b>piece</b> and broad cheat-line which runs down each plane's fuselage and the removal of the 'POLSKIE LINIE LOTNICZE' title from each aircraft's starboard side; these will instead be replaced with the words 'POLISH AIRLINES', analogous to the port-side titles in the airline's current livery composition. The tailplane's design will change only slightly, with the colours of the traditional encircled crane logo being inverted and the circle becoming a more simple outline ring. Additionally, the positioning will be such as the circle (with crane) will not entirely fit on the tail. Finally, the colours of the Polish flag, present at the top of the circle in the current LOT livery, will be moved to the bottom of the tailplane and will not connect with the logo. The updated design together with the entry into service of the new Boeing 787 Dreamliners are part of a refresh of LOT's corporate image.|$|E

All U.S Navy Phalanx systems are scheduled for upgrade to Block 1B by the end of FY 2015. In addition to the FLIR sensor, the Block 1B incorporates an automatic acquisition video tracker, optimized gun barrels (OGB), and Enhanced Lethality Cartridges (ELC) for additional capabilities against asymmetric threats such as small maneuvering surface craft, slow-flying fixed and rotary-winged aircraft, and unmanned aerial vehicles. The FLIR sensor improves performance against anti-ship cruise missiles, while the OGB and ELC provide tighter dispersion and increased [...] "first-hit" [...] range; the Mk 244 ELC is specifically designed to penetrate anti-ship missiles with a 48% heavier tungsten penetrator round and an aluminum <b>nose</b> <b>piece.</b> Another system upgrade is the Phalanx 1B Baseline 2 radar to improve detection performance, increase reliability, and reduce maintenance. It also has a surface mode to track, detect, and destroy threats closer to the water's surface, increasing the ability to defend against fast-attack boats and low-flying missiles; the Baseline 2 radar upgrade is to be installed on all U.S. Navy Phalanx system-equipped vessels by FY 2019.
