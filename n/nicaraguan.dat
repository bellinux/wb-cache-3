They informed Cortés of Hernández de Córdoba's plan to set himself up in Nicaragua independently of Pedrarias in Panama. Cortés responded courteously and offered supplies while the expedition was passing through Honduras, but sent letters advising Hernández de Córdoba to remain loyal to Pedrarias.|$|E

5|$|In May 1895 the Royal Navy {{occupied}} the <b>Nicaraguan</b> port of Corinto, {{after a number}} of British subjects, including the Vice-consul, had been seized during disturbances, shortly after the former protectorate of the Mosquito Coast had been incorporated into Nicaragua. The British demanded an indemnity of £15,000. US Secretary of State Walter Q. Gresham thought the demands harsh, but also that they should be met. US public opinion, however, was outraged at this British military activity in the United States' sphere of influence.|$|E
5|$|Noriega {{acted as}} a conduit for U.S. support to the Contra militants in Nicaragua for many years, {{including}} funds and weapons.

U.S. spy ships used bases in Panama in their operations against the <b>Nicaraguan</b> government, {{and much of the}} intelligence gathered by these ships was processed in the U.S. bases in Panama. Noriega permitted these activities despite the Panama Canal treaties restricting the use of the U.S. bases to protecting the canal.|$|E

5|$|De Mena {{was born}} into a Creole family in St. Martin Parish, Louisiana, and {{obtained}} her education in the United States before marrying a <b>Nicaraguan</b> and moving to Central America. After a decade in which she raised a daughter and taught school, she divorced, returned to the U.S., and joined the UNIA. Quickly rising in the ranks from a translator, because she was fluent in Spanish, de Mena became {{one of the leaders of}} the pan-African movement. She was responsible for increasing the membership of the organization in the Caribbean and Latin America. When Garvey left the U.S. and relocated to Jamaica, de Mena became Garvey's official representative in New York and was the first woman to carry such a high distinction in the organization.|$|E
5|$|For {{several days}} {{toward the end}} of October 1961, a {{low-pressure}} area persisted in the western Caribbean Sea, north of the Panama Canal Zone. On October25, an upper-level anticyclone moved over the low; the next day, a trough over the western Gulf of Mexico provided favorable outflow for the disturbance. At 0000UTC on October27, a ship nearby reported southerly winds of 46mph (74km/h). Later that day, the airport on San Andres Island reported easterly winds of 60mph (95km/h). The two observations confirmed the presence of a closed wind circulation, centered about 70miles (110km) southeast of San Andres, or 155mi (250km) east of the <b>Nicaraguan</b> coast; as a result, the Miami Weather Bureau began issuing advisories on the newly formed Tropical Storm Hattie.|$|E
