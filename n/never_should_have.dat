500|$|With September nearly dead, Peter {{decides to}} use Walter's {{equipment}} {{to enter the}} Observer's mind to try to learn of Olivia's location. Within September's consciousness, Peter learns the Observers are {{a team of scientists}} from one possible future of humanity, having used technology to travel to the past to witness their own creation. September, however, disrupted events by attempting to observe the point where Peter's cure was discovered, and his disruption has since caused several unintended changes within the timeline, including the war between the two universes. Ultimately, this would lead to the birth of Henry, Peter's child with the parallel universe's Olivia, which September claimed <b>never</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> happened and will be a catalyst for disruption of future events. By Peter entering the Machine and altering the timeline, Henry also ceased to exist. September explains that Peter's reappearance may be a means to set things right, and insists he find a way to reunite his romance with his original Olivia. As the reality of September's mind breaks down and he claims [...] "they are coming", the Observer tells Peter to [...] "go home". [...] Peter is suddenly woken up in the lab, September's body goes into convulsions and vanishes.|$|E
500|$|On {{the final}} cut privilege, Spielberg was {{dissatisfied}} with the film. Columbia Pictures was experiencing financial problems, and they were depending on this film to save their company. [...] "I wanted to have another six months to finish off this film, and release it in summer 1978. They told me they needed this film out immediately," [...] Spielberg explained. [...] "Anyway, Close Encounters was a huge financial success and I told them I wanted {{to make my own}} director's cut. They agreed on the condition that I show the inside of the mothership so they could have something to hang a [...] campaign on. I <b>never</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> shown the inside of the mother ship." [...] In 1979, Columbia gave Spielberg $1.5million to produce what became the [...] "Special Edition" [...] of the film. Spielberg added seven minutes of new footage, but also deleted or shortened various existing scenes by a total of ten minutes, so that the Special Edition was three minutes shorter than the original 1977 release. The Special Edition featured several new character development scenes, the discovery of the SS Cotopaxi in the Gobi Desert, and a view of the inside of the mothership. Close Encounters of the Third Kind: The Special Edition was released in August 1980, making a further $15.7million, accumulating a final $303.7million box office gross.
