5|$|The buyout of RJR Nabisco was {{completed}} in April 1989 and KKR would spend the early 1990s repaying the RJR's enormous debt load {{through a series of}} asset sales and restructuring transactions. After the RJR Nabisco deal, KKR did <b>not</b> <b>complete</b> a single investment in 1990, the first such year since 1982. They would <b>not</b> <b>complete</b> another major leveraged buyout transaction for more than three years, largely because of the shutdown of the high yield bond market and the collapse of Drexel Burnham Lambert which filed for bankruptcy in February 1990. KKR began to focus primarily on its existing portfolio companies acquired during the buyout boom of the late 1980s. Six of KKR's portfolio companies completed IPOs in 1991, including RJR Nabisco and Duracell.|$|E

5|$|Impacts {{are thought}} to be a regular (if {{currently}} infrequent) part of the evolution of the Solar System. That they continue to happen is evidenced by the collision of Comet Shoemaker–Levy 9 with Jupiter in 1994, the 2009 Jupiter impact event, the Tunguska event, the Chelyabinsk meteor and the impact feature Meteor Crater in Arizona. The process of accretion, therefore, is <b>not</b> <b>complete,</b> and may still pose a threat to life on Earth.|$|E
5|$|In 1974, {{he took a}} {{leave of}} absence from The Tennessean to attend Vanderbilt University Law School.

5|$|In as {{different}} groups as animals and trypanosomes, the mitochondria contain both stabilising and destabilising poly(A) tails.

5|$|Not every {{transitional}} form {{appears in}} the fossil record, because the fossil record is <b>not</b> <b>complete.</b> Organisms are only rarely preserved as fossils {{in the best of}} circumstances, and only a fraction of such fossils have been discovered.
