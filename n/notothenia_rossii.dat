40|$|Notothenia coriiceps and <b>Notothenia</b> <b>rossii</b> are two {{widespread}} nototheniid fishes, {{that live}} sympatrically {{along the southern}} Scotia Arc from South Georgia to the South Shetland Islands. In this sector of the Southern Ocean, they experienced different exploitation rates {{in the past and}} exhibit different habitat and food preferences as adult. Aiming to evaluate the influence of these factors in shaping life history traits of these species, we compare the reproductive investment and the age structure between the species and in N. rossii, between populations inhabiting different areas. Based on histological analyses, the two species share the same pattern of gamete development in both sexes. The potential fecundity was similar and was positively related to fish size in both species, being relatively high with respect to other notothenioids and in terms of egg size at deposition. Based on sagittal otolith readings, the growth rate and maximum age recorded differed significantly between the two species. <b>Notothenia</b> <b>rossii</b> exhibited a higher growth rate and a comparatively lower maximum age than N. coriiceps. Similarly, N. rossii attained sexual maturity at the same age but at a larger size than N. coriiceps. At the intraspecific level, no differences in life history traits were observed between the populations of N. rossii collected from different areas. Consistent with the different levels of fishing pressure exerted on these species and their low resilience, a recent significant decrease over time in the maximum fish size and related reproductive potential has been observed only in the overexploited populations of N. rossii...|$|E

40|$|<b>Notothenia</b> <b>rossii</b> was {{the first}} target species in Southern Ocean fisheries. The species was already heavily fished at the {{beginning}} of the 1970 s. The closure of the fishery for this species in 1985 was one of the first conservation measures adopted by CCAMLR. Fish biomass within a CCAMLR subarea or part of a subarea is commonly estimated from surveys that target a number of species, including N. rossii, at the same time. These surveys are conducted under the assumption that the target fish species are more or less evenly distributed over the area at the time of the survey This assumption is violated in the case of N. rossii, which is non-randomly distributed such that a large proportion of the population tends to aggregate in small areas, leaving most of the survey area only thinly populated. In order to provide more accurate estimates of the abundance of the species, it is suggested that an acoustic survey combined with a number of identification hauls might be the most promising approach to estimating the biomass of N. rossii...|$|E

There were no neutrally buoyant species and mean values for %B were 3. 07 – 6. 11 %, with channichthyids {{at the low}} end and benthic nototheniids and bathydraconids at the high end.

40|$|Understanding the key {{drivers of}} {{population}} connectivity {{in the marine}} environment {{is essential for the}} effective management of natural resources. Although several different approaches to evaluating connectivity have been used, they are rarely integrated quantitatively. Here, we use a ‘seascape genetics’ approach, by combining oceanographic modelling and microsatellite analyses, to understand the dominant influences on the population genetic structure of two Antarctic fishes with contrasting life histories, Champsocephalus gunnari and <b>Notothenia</b> <b>rossii.</b> The close accord between the model projections and empirical genetic structure demonstrated that passive dispersal during the planktonic early life stages is the dominant influence on patterns and extent of genetic structuring in both species. The shorter planktonic phase of C. gunnari restricts direct transport of larvae between distant populations, leading to stronger regional differentiation. By contrast, geographic distance did not affect differentiation in N. rossii, whose longer larval period promotes long-distance dispersal. Interannual variability in oceanographic flows strongly influenced the projected genetic structure, suggesting that shifts in circulation patterns due to climate change are likely to impact future genetic connectivity and opportunities for local adaptation, resilience and recovery from perturbations. Further development of realistic climate models is required to fully assess such potential impacts...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of photoperiod {{on the ability}} of <b>Notothenia</b> <b>rossii</b> Richardson, 1844 to detect prey was studied experimentally. In 12 L/ 12 D there was the highest number of individuals stimulated visually and chemically while in 24 D chemical perception was the same as that observed in 12 L/ 12 D, the latter being lower than in 24 L. The ultrastructure of chemo- and photo-sensory structures, involved in the detection of food, was studied. The photoreceptor cells of the retina are single and double cones, and rods. Taste buds were concentrated in the central part of upper and lower lips. Their shape is even, but the size is variable. The olfactory rosette has a sensory and a non-sensory epithelium, being rich in different mucosubstances. The conclusion was that in different photoperiods there is a difference in the response to visual and chemical stimulation for prey detection and that all sensory systems are more stimulated in periods of more luminosity, mainly when there is an alternation between light and dark periods. Sensory organs are complex when compared to some other Antarctic fish such as Gobionotothen gibberifrons Lönnberg, 1905 and Ophthalmolycus amberensis Tomo, Marshoff & Torno, 1977 but similar to those of N. coriiceps Rchardson, 1844. A capacidade de <b>Notothenia</b> <b>rossii</b> Richardson, 1844 detectar presas in diferentes fotoperíodos (24 L, 24 D e 12 L/ 12 D) foi estudada em tanques experimentais. Em 12 L/ 12 D houve um maior número de indivíduos estimulados visual e quimicamente enquanto que em 24 D a percepção química foi a mesma que a observada em 12 L/ 12 D, sendo este ultimo inferior a 24 L. A morfologia das estruturas quimio-foto sensoriais, envolvidas na detecção do alimento, foi estudada. As células fotorreceptoras da retina são os cones simples e duplos e os bastonetes. Os botões concentraram-se na região central dos lábios superior e inferior. Seu formato é constante, mas o tamanho é variável. A rosseta olfatória possui um epitélio sensorial e não sensorial rico mucosubstâncias de natureza diversa. Podemos concluir que em diferentes fotoperíodos existe uma diferença de resposta na estimulação visual e química para a detecção de persas e todo o sistema sensorial são mais estimulados em períodos de maior luminosidade, principalmente quando existe uma alternância entre períodos de luz e escuro.

Information presented here, drawn largely from recent scientific research surveys, includes aspects of species composition, biomass and stock structure, reproduction and early life history, age, growth, and nat-ural mortality, and diet. Although Antarctic fish faunal groups overlap in the southern Scotia Arc, the region is dominated by species of low-Antarctic origin {{both in terms of}} biomass and number of species. Several basic biological parameters of the abundant fish species in the southern Scotia Arc are comparatively well known, though less so in the South Orkney Islands than the South Shetland Islands. These stocks suffered substantial declines as a result of commercial exploitation of mackerel ice fish, Champsocephalus gunnari, and marbled notothenia, <b>Notothenia</b> <b>rossii,</b> in the late 1970 s and mid 1980 s.

The fish species composition in the diet at each site showed a strong relationship with the local marine habitat/topography. The absence of formerly harvested fish species indicates a lack of recovery of stocks of <b>Notothenia</b> <b>rossii</b> Richardson, 1844 at South Georgia and Champsocephalus gunnari Lönnberg, 1905 at the South Orkney Islands.

Variability in the occurrence of C. gunnari was driven mainly by annual scale processes, particularly those that influence the availability of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba (Dana, 1852)). The occurrence of the pelagic P. choriodon was primarily influenced by shorter-term water mass changes within the foraging range of the seals.

40|$|Climate {{change and}} {{anthropogenic}} pollution are of increasing concern {{in remote areas}} such as Antarctica. The evolutionary adaptation of Antarctic notothenioid fish to the cold and stable Southern Ocean led to a low plasticity of their physiological functions, what may limit their capacity to deal with altered temperature regimes and pollution in the Antarctic environment. Using a biochemical approach, we aimed to assess the hepatic biotransformation capacities of Antarctic fish species by determining (i) the activities of ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST), and (ii) the metabolic clearance of benzo(a) pyrene by hepatic S 9 supernatants. In addition, we determined the thermal sensitivity of the xenobiotic biotransformation enzymes. We investigated the xenobiotic metabolism of the red-blooded Gobionotothen gibberifrons and <b>Notothenia</b> <b>rossii,</b> the hemoglobin-less Chaenocephalus aceratus and Champsocephalus gunnari, and the rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss as a reference. Our results revealed similar metabolic enzyme activities and metabolic clearance rates between red- and white-blooded Antarctic fish, but significantly lower rates in comparison to rainbow trout. Therefore, bioaccumulation factors for metabolizable lipophilic contaminants may be higher in Antarctic than in temperate fish. Likewise, the thermal adaptive capacities and flexibilities of the EROD and GST activities in Antarctic fish were significantly lower than in rainbow trout. As a consequence, increasing water temperatures in the Southern Ocean will additionally compromise the already low detoxification capacities of Antarctic fish...|$|E

The activity of the superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and glutathione reductase (GR) enzymes as well as the content of non-enzymatic oxidative stress markers such as reduced glutathione (GSH), lipid peroxidation (LPO) and protein carbonyl (PC) were measured in the liver of two Antarctic fish species, <b>Notothenia</b> <b>rossii</b> and Notothenia coriiceps after 1, 3 and 6 days of exposure to temperatures of 0 °C and 8 °C. The GST activity showed a downregulation in N. rossii after 6 days of exposure to the increased temperature. The activity profiles of GST and GR in N. rossii and of GPx in N. coriiceps also changed as a consequence of heating to 8 °C. The GSH content increased by heating to 8 °C after 3 days in N. coriiceps and after 6 days in N. rossii. The content of malondialdehyde (MDA), a LPO marker, showed a negative modulation by the heating to 8 °C in N. rossii after 3 days of exposure to temperatures.

Prey reoccurrences among fish species were 32. 2 %, with krill Euphausia superba, salps and the gammaridean Prostebeingia longicornis the most reoccurring prey. The diet similarity between species pairs was lower than 55 %, in accordance with similar fish assemblages in the South Orkney Islands, the South Shetland Islands and the Antarctic Peninsula. Whereas at those localities the higher prey overlap was between krill-feeding fish species, at the Danco Coast it was between Trematomus bernacchii and Lepidonotothen nudifrons, Notothenia coriiceps and <b>Notothenia</b> <b>rossii,</b> N. coriiceps and Parachaenichthyis charcoti, and Trematomus newnesi and N. rossii, which shared primarily gammaridean amphipods, algae, fish and krill, respectively. Krill is normally the main prey of fish in summer in inshore waters of the western Antarctic Peninsula, but its density in January/February 2000 was notably lower than in previous years. Therefore, at the Danco Coast, under conditions of krill shortage, most of the notothenioid species foraged more intensively on alternative prey, such as gammarideans, fish and algae. The difference between areas in the pattern of dietary overlap might be related to differences in prey availability between years and to the degree of competition for targeted prey...|$|E
40|$|Ongoing ocean {{warming and}} {{acidification}} {{have been found}} to particularly affect polar marine ecosystems. However, few data exist about the ability of Antarctic fish to respond to environmental change. We therefore studied the acclimatory capacities of the Antarctic fish <b>Notothenia</b> <b>rossii</b> after 4 - 6 weeks of acclimation to 7 °C, hypercapnia (0. 2 kPa CO 2) and the combination of both. We analysed routine metabolic rate (RMR) during acute thermal challenge and after acclimation, extra- and intracellular acid-base status, mitochondrial as well as enzymatic capacities and lipid composition. Our results showed partially compensated RMR after warm acclimation and no effect of increased PCO 2 on the RMR. Hypercapnic acclimation led to a general overcompensation of extracellular pH. Intracellular pH displayed a slight acidosis in liver after warm normocapnic/hypercapnic acclimation, whereas white muscle remained well buffered under hypercapnia. Mitochondrial state III respiration in liver was unaffected by temperature acclimation, but depressed in the hypercapnia acclimated animals, which went along with reduced rates of proton leak. The activities of the mitochondrial enzymes citrate synthase and cytochrome c oxidase increased during hypercapnia acclimation in red and white muscle, but not in liver and heart. Furthermore, there was a trend towards an enrichment of poly-unsaturated fatty acids in liver mitochondria towards the warm hypercapnic conditions. We conclude that N. rossii possesses basic acclimatory capacities towards ocean warming and acidification. However, these capacities are confined within strict limits, becoming obvious in metabolically more active organs like heart and liver that show less plasticity than muscle and ultimately define animal survival. ...|$|E
40|$|Waters around South Georgia are {{amongst the}} most {{productive}} in the Southern Ocean, and support internationally important fisheries. However, there is significant inter-annual variability in fish stocks, and some species have failed to recover from historical overfishing. Dispersal and retention of the planktonic eggs and larvae of marine fish can {{play a key role}} in the maintenance of adult stocks. We use a numerical modelling approach to examine the influence of oceanographic and life-history variability on the dispersal and retention of 2 Antarctic fishes: Champsocephalus gunnari (mackerel icefish) and <b>Notothenia</b> <b>rossii</b> (marbled rockcod). Mean retention of N. rossii larvae was predicted to be 5. 3 %, considerably lower than that of C. gunnari (31. 3 %), a difference related to the longer planktonic period of the former. Such apparent loss of larvae from local recruitment grounds may contribute to the failure of the N. rossii population to recover from its collapse in the 1970 s. However, retention of both species showed high inter-annual variability. Dispersal and retention of C. gunnari were strongly influenced by location of the spawning site, with the greatest contribution to overall retention from spawning sites on the southwest South Georgia shelf. In addition, a consistent feature in C. gunnari was a lack of larval exchange between the proximate South Georgia and Shag Rocks shelves, regions separated by only 240 km. Our findings provide insights into the demographic dynamics and connectivity of C. gunnari and N. rossii populations at South Georgia in relation to prospects for recovery and ongoing responses to environmental variability and change in the region...|$|E
40|$|Mitochondrial {{plasticity}} plays {{a central}} role in setting the capacity for acclimation of aerobic metabolism in ectotherms in response to environmental changes. We still lack a clear picture if and to what extent the energy metabolism and mitochondrial enzymes of Antarctic fish can compensate for changing temperatures or PCO 2 and whether capacities for compensation differ between tissues. We therefore measured activities of key mitochondrial enzymes (citrate synthase (CS), cytochrome c oxidase (COX)) from heart, red muscle, white muscle and liver in the Antarctic fish <b>Notothenia</b> <b>rossii</b> after warm- (7 °C) and hypercapnia- (0. 2 kPa CO 2) acclimation vs. control conditions (1 °C, 0. 04 kPa CO 2). In heart, enzymes showed elevated activities after cold-hypercapnia acclimation, and a warm-acclimation-induced upward shift in thermal optima. The strongest increase in enzyme activities in response to hypercapnia occurred in red muscle. In white muscle, enzyme activities were temperature-compensated. CS activity in liver decreased after warm-normocapnia acclimation (temperature-compensation), while COX activities were lower after cold- and warm-hypercapnia exposure, but increased after warm-normocapnia acclimation. In conclusion, warm-acclimated N. rossii display low thermal compensation in response to rising energy demand in highly aerobic tissues, such as heart and red muscle. Chronic environmental hypercapnia elicits increased enzyme activities in these tissues, possibly to compensate for an elevated energy demand for acid-base regulation or a compromised mitochondrial metabolism, that is predicted to occur in response to hypercapnia exposure. This might be supported by enhanced metabolisation of liver energy stores. These patterns reflect a limited capacity of N. rossii to reorganise energy metabolism in response to rising temperature and PCO 2...|$|E
40|$|Fatty acid (FA) {{composition}} of nine organs from two closely related Antarctic fish species, Notothenia codiceps and <b>Notothenia</b> <b>rossii,</b> was determined through gas chromatography with flame ionization detection. A data set for each species was obtained using major FA profiles from specimens {{caught in the}} sea waters of Admiralty Bay during the summer season. The FA profiles for both species are overall similar, but organ peculiarities have been found, which could reflect metabolic specificities and feeding habits between species. With the exception of liver, the most abundant FA in organs was the n- 3 polyunsaturated FA. The total n- 6 polyunsaturated FAs were minor components in all evaluated organs. Palmitic acid was identified as the major saturated FA, whereas oleic acid was the most represented of the monounsaturated FA in almost all assessed organs of both species. The n- 3 /n- 6 ratios of all organs were higher than 3. 5. Differences in individual FA and FA metabolic profiles of some organs observed between N. coriiceps and N. rossii suggest specific requirements in the mobilization, transport, incorporation, and/or catabolism of lipids that were reinforced by differences on some FA ratios expressing the activity coefficient of enzymes implicated on the FA pathway flux.

40|$|International audience‘POKER 2006 ', {{a bottom}} trawl fish biomass survey, was {{conducted}} from September to October 2006 {{in the northern}} part of the Kerguelen Plateau (CCAMLR Statistical Division 58. 5. 1). The swept-area method was used in the depth range from 100 to 1 000 m with 207 random stratified stations. Estimates of biomass and abundance were produced for eight commercial species. The total biomass was 245 000 tonnes and Patagonian toothfish (Dissostichus eleginoides) accounted for half of the value (124 000 tonnes). The fish biomass was distributed between the shelf and the deep sea. However, this evaluation remains incomplete as four of the species (D. eleginoides, bigeye grenadier (Macrourus carinatus), Eaton's skate (Bathyraja eatonii) and Kerguelen sandpaper skate (B. irrasa)) extend deeper than 1 000 m, the limit of the POKER 2006 survey. Some shelf and slope species (mackerel icefish (Champsocephalus gunnari) and marbled rockcod (<b>Notothenia</b> <b>rossii))</b> exhibit low levels of biomass when compared to the results of previous surveys (SKALP surveys, 1987 and 1988). Other species (unicorn icefish (Channichthys rhinoceratus) and grey rockcod (Lepidonotothen squamifrons)) seem to have increased, even doubled, their biomass during the period between the two surveys. In addition to the commercial species, Zanclorhynchus spinifer was abundant on the shelf and Alepocephalus cf. antipodianus was abundant in the deep sea; the data on the latter are new. Data on the geographic and bathymetric distribution of the species provide evidence of geographically very stable species-specific concentrations. Distinct cohorts of some species (D. eleginoides and C. gunnari) were detected in some sectors. The survey has defined the distribution of species, commercial or not, that are important in the ecosystem and are of major interest for the management and conservation of fish populations in the are...|$|E
40|$|Antarctic {{fish species}} possess very low {{metabolic}} rates and poor metabolic plasticity, thus making them extremely vulnerable to changing environmental conditions. Mitochondria {{are a key}} element in shaping whole organism energy turnover and functional capacities. In our study, we compared two nototheniid fish, the Austral black cod (Notothenia angustata, New Zealand) and the Antarctic marbled rockcod (<b>Notothenia</b> <b>rossii,</b> Antarctic Peninsula) for their abilities of metabolic compensation for rising temperature and PCO 2 at the intracellular level. We acclimated N. angustata to control conditions (PCO 2 of 0. 04 kPa) and to an ambient PCO 2 of 0. 2 kPa for 11 days, and kept N. rossii at a PCO 2 of 0. 04 kPa. We assessed permeabilized heart fibre oxygen consumption at various respiratory states (e. g. state III ￼￼complex I/ II, state IV (leak), uncoupled/ ETS capacity, complex IV) in acutely hypercapnic (PCO 2 of 2 kPa, corresponds to intracellular PCO 2 under 0. 2 kPa ambient hypercapnia) vs. normocapnic (PCO 2 of 0. 04 kPa) respiration media. In all respiratory states, acute exposure to the hypercapnic respiration medium resulted in reduced mitochondrial capacities, in the Austral and the Antarctic notothenioids Yet, overall heart fibre respiration was higher in the hypercapnia acclimated N. angustata than in their control group. This suggests that chronic acclimation of the fish to moderately elevated PCO 2 levels might enhance mitochondrial aerobic capacities, involving e. g. changes in enzyme capacities or mitochondrial proliferation. Our data indicate that while acute high PCO 2 levels of 2 kPa reduce mitochondrial oxidative capacities in Austral and Antarctic notothenioids, at least the Austral fish {{seem to be able to}} compensate for these acutely reduced metabolic capacities by hypercapnia acclimation. ...|$|E
40|$|Antarctic notothenioid {{fish are}} {{characterized}} by their evolutionary adaptation to the cold, thermostable Southern Ocean, which is associated with unique physiological adaptations to withstand the cold and reduce energetic requirements but also entails limited compensation capacities to environmental change. This study compares the capacities of mitochondrial acclimation to ocean warming and acidification between the Antarctic nototheniid <b>Notothenia</b> <b>rossii</b> and the sub-Antarctic Lepidonotothen squamifrons, which share a similar ecology, but different habitat temperatures. After acclimation of L. squamifrons to 9 °C and N. rossii to 7 °C (normocapnic/hypercapnic, 0. 2 kPa CO 2 / 2000 ppm CO 2) for 4 - 6 weeks, we compared the capacities of their mitochondrial respiratory complexes I (CI) and II (CII), their P/O ratios (phosphorylation efficiency), proton leak capacities and mitochondrial membrane fatty acid compositions. Our results reveal reduced CII respiration rates in warm-acclimated L. squamifrons and cold hypercapnia-acclimated N. rossii. Generally, L. squamifrons displayed a greater ability to increase CI contribution during acute warming and after warm-acclimation than N. rossii. Membrane unsaturation was not altered by warm or hypercapnia-acclimation in both species, but membrane fatty acids of warm-acclimated L. squamifrons were less saturated than in warm normocapnia-/hypercapnia-acclimated N. rossii. Proton leak capacities were not affected by warm or hypercapnia-acclimation of N. rossii. We conclude that an acclimatory response of mitochondrial capacities may include higher thermal plasticity of CI supported by enhanced utilization of anaplerotic substrates (via oxidative decarboxylation reactions) feeding into the citrate cycle. L. squamifrons possesses higher relative CI plasticities than N. rossii, which may facilitate the usage of energy efficient NADH-related substrates under conditions of elevated energy demand, possibly induced by ocean warming and acidification. The observed adjustments of electron transport system complexes with a higher flux through CI under warming and acidification suggest a metabolic acclimation potential of the sub-Antarctic L. squamifrons, but only limited acclimation capacities for N. rossii...|$|E
40|$|Fish around Antarctic Peninsula {{are exposed}} to the fastest climate change rate in the planet, up to ten times higher than the global average. The {{evolution}} in extreme stenothermal isolation was a strong selective pressure {{for the development of a}} highly endemic fish fauna, with likely structural and functional constraints. To which extent can coastal notothenioid fish adjust to the conditions forecasted by the models of climate change? Experiments were run in the Arctowski (PL) station at Admiralty Bay, King George Island, in 2012 / 13. Fish, <b>Notothenia</b> <b>rossii</b> and N. coriiceps, were collected by boat at 5 - 25 meter deep using fishing poles and were transferred to experimental tanks in cold rooms acclimated to natural temperatures (0 - 2 °C). Fish were exposed to rapid/ gradual changes in water temperature or/and salinity (to 6 - 8 °C using thermostat-controlled heaters, to 20 - 10 ‰ by addition of freshwater to recirculating tanks, over a period of up to 10 days) to evaluate the response of several physiological processes. The stress endocrine axis was tested by injecting known blockers/ agonists of cortisol release and receptors. Exposure to altered conditions had no effect in immediate mortality. Increased temperature reduced overall activity and behavioral response to stimuli, although it had no clear effect on mobilization of energetic substrate. Both cortisol and gene expression of metabolic-related proteins and glucocorticoid- and mineralocorticoid receptors were modified after heat shock, but that the cortisol response to handling was reduced. The rise in temperature induced a dependent decrease in plasma osmolality while increasing branchial Na+/K+-ATPase activity, thus decreasing osmoregulatory efficiency. In conclusion, Antarctic fish are reactive to environmental change, but that their ability to accommodate rapid or adaptive responses may be compromised...|$|E
40|$|Fish of the {{suborder}} Notothenioidei {{have successfully}} radiated into the Southern Ocean and today comprise the dominant fish sub-order in Antarctic waters {{in terms of}} biomass and species abundance. During evolution {{in the cold and}} stable Antarctic climate, the Antarctic lineage of notothenioids developed several unique physiological adaptations, which make them extremely vulnerable to the rapid warming of Antarctic waters currently observed. Only recently, a further phenomenon exclusive to notothenioid fish was reported: the translocation of the mitochondrial gene encoding the NADH Dehydrogenase subunit 6 (ND 6), an indispensable part of complex I in the mitochondrial electron transport system. This study investigated the potential physiological consequences of ND 6 translocation for the function and thermal sensitivity of the electron transport system in isolated liver mitochondria of the two nototheniid species Notothenia coriiceps and <b>Notothenia</b> <b>rossii,</b> with special attention to the contributions of complex I (NADH DH) and complex II (Succinate DH) to oxidative phosphorylation. Furthermore, enzymatic activities of NADH:Cytochrome c Oxidoreductase and Cytochrome C Oxidase were measured in membrane-enriched tissue extracts. During acute thermal challenge (0 - 15 °C), capacities of mitochondrial respiration and enzymatic function in the liver could only be increased until 9 °C. Mitochondrial complex I (NADH Dehydrogenase) was fully functional but displayed a higher thermal sensitivity than the other complexes of the electron transport system, which may specifically result from its unique amino acid composition, revealing a lower degree of stability in notothenioids in general. We interpret the translocation of ND 6 as functionally neutral but the change in amino acid sequence as adaptive and supportive of cold stenothermy in Antarctic nototheniids. From these findings, an enhanced sensitivity to ocean warming can be deduced for Antarctic notothenioid fish...|$|E
40|$|Introduction Ongoing ocean {{warming and}} {{acidification}} increasingly affect marine ecosystems, in particular around the Antarctic Peninsula. Yet {{little is known}} about the capability of Antarctic notothenioid fish to cope with rising temperature in acidifying seawater. While the whole animal level is expected to be more sensitive towards hypercapnia and temperature, the basis of thermal tolerance is set at the cellular level, with a putative key role for mitochondria. This study therefore investigates the physiological responses of the Antarctic <b>Notothenia</b> <b>rossii</b> after long-term acclimation to increased temperatures (7 °C) and elevated PCO 2 (0. 2 kPa CO 2) at different levels of physiological organisation. Results For an integrated picture, we analysed the acclimation capacities of N. rossii by measuring routine metabolic rate (RMR), mitochondrial capacities (state III respiration) as well as intra- and extracellular acid-base status during acute thermal challenges and after long-term acclimation to changing temperature and hypercapnia. RMR was partially compensated during warm- acclimation (decreased below the rate observed after acute warming), while elevated PCO 2 had no effect on cold or warm acclimated RMR. Mitochondrial state III respiration was unaffected by temperature acclimation but depressed in cold and warm hypercapnia-acclimated fish. In both cold- and warm-exposed N. rossii, hypercapnia acclimation resulted in a shift of extracellular pH (pHe) towards more alkaline values. A similar overcompensation was visible in muscle intracellular pH (pHi). pHi in liver displayed a slight acidosis after warm normo- or hypercapnia acclimation, nevertheless, long-term exposure to higher PCO 2 was compensated for by intracellular bicarbonate accumulation. Conclusion The partial warm compensation in whole animal metabolic rate indicates beginning limitations in tissue oxygen supply after warm-acclimation of N. rossii. Compensatory mechanisms of the reduced mitochondrial capacities under chronic hypercapnia may include a new metabolic equilibrium to meet the elevated energy demand for acid-base regulation. New set points of acid-base regulation under hypercapnia, visible at the systemic and intracellular level, indicate that N. rossii can at least in part acclimate to ocean warming and acidification. It remains open whether the reduced capacities of mitochondrial energy metabolism are adaptive or would impair population fitness over longer timescales under chronically elevated temperature and PCO 2...|$|E
