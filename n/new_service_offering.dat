40|$|<b>Service</b> organisations create <b>new</b> <b>service</b> <b>offerings</b> {{that are}} the result of {{collaborative}} arrangements operating on a value network level. This leads to the notion of “elevated <b>service</b> offering”, implying <b>new</b> or enhanced <b>service</b> <b>offerings</b> which can only be eventuated as a result of partnering, and one that could not be delivered on individual organisational merits.

40|$|The {{academic}} discipline of service engineering aims at structuring and formalizing the innovation process with the target to develop “better ” services by using fewer resources {{and making them}} more market-oriented. The question of how invisible and intangible service products can be explained, especially visualized and emotionalized {{in order to be}} more user-centered and attractive for customers, is not sufficiently covered by service engineering. “Creative industries”, e. g. dramatics, film, design, arts and letters might offer solutions for these problems. They all have in common, that they often use storytelling in a broader sense (dramaturgy, narratives, product semantic, plot etc.) to communicate a message and they are experienced in using the respective tools. In a case study with Siemens Automation and Drives Switzerland a new product-supporting service was designed, based on the framework of service engineering and combined with the tools of storytelling. The study pursued the question: Can those tools be used to optimize the “story ” of service? The result is a service offering that is developed systematically covering the “hard factors ” like strategic positioning, process descriptions with service blueprints, checklists etc., but the dramaturgy and interaction with the customer and other “soft factors ” were also designed and considered. A crucial role was testing the <b>new</b> <b>service</b> <b>offering</b> in a service laboratory. The probability for a successful market launch of the <b>new</b> <b>service</b> <b>offering</b> is higher, due to the application of service engineering and storytelling, even if the application of storytelling to the service development process is difficult...|$|E

40|$|Scholars at the ten campuses of the University of California system, {{like their}} {{academic}} peers elsewhere, increasingly {{are being asked}} to ensure that data resulting from their research and teaching activities are subject to effective long-term management, public discovery, and retrieval. The new academic imperative for research data management (RDM) stems from mandates from public and private funding agencies, pre-publication requirements, institutional policies, and evolving norms of scholarly discourse. In order to meet these new obligations, scholars need access to appropriate disciplinary and institutional tools, services, and guidance. When providing help in these areas, it is important that service providers recognize the disparity in scholarly familiarity with data curation concepts and practices. While the UC Curation Center (UC 3) at the California Digital Library supports a growing roster of innovative curation services for University use, most were intended originally {{to meet the needs of}} institutional information professionals, such as librarians, archivists, and curators. In order to address the new curation concerns of individual scholars, UC 3 realized that it needed to deploy new systems and services optimized for stakeholders with widely divergent experiences, expertise, and expectations. This led to the development of Dash, an online data publication service making campus data sharing easy. While Dash gives the appearance of being a full-fledged repository, in actuality it is only a lightweight overlay layer that sits on top of standards-compliant repositories, such as UC 3 ’s existing Merritt curation repository. The Dash service offers intuitive, easy-to-use interfaces for dataset submission, description, publication, and discovery. By imposing minimal prescriptive eligibility and submission requirements; automating and hiding the mechanical details of DOI assignment, data packaging, and repository deposit; and featuring a streamlined, self-service user experience that can be integrated easily into scholarly workflows, Dash is an important <b>new</b> <b>service</b> <b>offering</b> with which UC scholars can meet their RDM obligations...|$|E

40|$|Service {{organizations}} increasingly create <b>new</b> <b>service</b> <b>offerings</b> {{that are}} the result of collaborative arrangements operating on a value network level. This leads to the notion of "elevated service offerings," our definition of <b>service</b> innovation, implying <b>new</b> or enhanced <b>service</b> <b>offerings</b> that can only be eventuated as a result of partnering, and one that could not be delivered on individual organizational merits. Using empirical data from a large telecommunications company, we demonstrate through structural equation modeling (SEM) that higher-order dynamic capabilities in services are generated as a result of collaboration between stakeholders. Furthermore, it is through collaboration and education of the stakeholders that additional higher-order capabilities emerge (customer engagement [CuE], collaborative agility [CA], entrepreneurial alertness [EA], and collaborative innovative capacity), all of which influence the service innovation outcome. Our study also reveals empirical evidence for an ongoing process of continuous dynamic capability building in accordance with the changing dynamics of business. Managers of service organizations should recognize the potential embedded in these higher-order skill sets, starting from collaboration, learning, and management of creative ideas for both strategic and operational benefits. Moreover, the capabilities of CA, EA, and CuE are even more important in managing the flexibility, timely delivery, and reliability of <b>service</b> <b>offerings.</b> Managers should take measures to inculcate, promote, and manage these dynamic capability skill sets to foster innovation in services. © 2009, Decision Sciences Institute...|$|R

40|$|Based on {{examples}} from Information and Communication Technology- (ICT-) based improvements in service productivity {{in the service}} organisations of three manufacturing firms, this paper argues for a service-centred approach towards productivity. When improving the productivity of industrial services, {{one of the three}} profitability-generating strategies, cost-efficiency, revenue effectiveness and capacity utilisation – or a combination – can be used. Increased standardisation and automation is a consequence of technological development, making capacity less a constraint in services and even if ICT applications often primarily improve cost efficiency, the elements improved vary depending on the solution implemented. Thus, ICT can enhance existing service processes and enable <b>new</b> <b>service</b> <b>offerings</b> to increase overall profitability. A productivity model for ICT-based services is presented and it is suggested that central coordination is often required in order to develop ICT-based services.

However, decisions must be made by telecommunications operating companies or administrations in a turbulent environment, full of uncertainties with respect to reliable demand forecasts (for <b>new</b> <b>services</b> for which no past data is available), production costs and time to reach the market of some equipment based on brand new technologies, development of <b>new</b> <b>services,</b> etc. Moreover, strategic decisions to be made generally involve distinct, incommensurate and conflicting aspects; that is, problems are multicriteria in nature in the sense that economical, technological, market and social aspects are at stake. Therefore, in order to make well founded decisions, models should explicitly address those different objectives, so that decision makers and planning bodies may grasp the conflicting nature of the objectives and the trade-offs to be made in order to select satisfactory evolution plans.

40|$|As {{the market}} for high speed Internet and {{cellular}} communication services reaches maturity, communication services have shown a limit to growth {{based on the number}} of subscribers. Next Generation Networks services based on IP Routing form the beginning of a new age of innovative and affordable services where consumers will witness substantial <b>new</b> <b>service</b> <b>offerings</b> and also savings in their consumption bills for such services. The requirement of these applications challenges the limitations of the network technologies that are in place today. Next Generation Networks are based on internet technologies including Internet Protocol (IP) and Multi-protocol Label Switching (MPLS). The thesis therefore presents an overview of the converged IP Network services, focusing on opportunities for service differentiation and introducing current service oriented technology to meet up the demands of consumers. These technologies allow service providers to build and operate networks that can be able to provide local, long distance, global, mobile, data, voice and internet services to consumers. In meeting the demands of these <b>newer</b> <b>services</b> to its customers adequately with high Quality of Service (QoS), Speed, Traffic Engineering and Scalability, Internet Service Providers have engaged Next Generation Networks using the more reliable Multi-Protocol Label Switching in the core of their networks while also delivering such services through a secure means over the public internet by using Virtual Private Networks. osagiesolo@yahoo. co. uk, sirozed@yahoo. co...|$|R

Strong adoption of the cloud computing {{in the recent years}} has also affected the view on outsourcing of information technology enabled processes and led to creation of <b>new</b> <b>service</b> <b>offerings</b> represented by a combination of cloud and outsourcing. Earlier research closely considers the benefits of cloud computing and business process outsourcing.

The focus of the current research is to fill in this gap and analyze managerial perceptions of the value of cloud based information systems by grouping organizations based on their outsourcing pattern: 1) non-outsourcing, 2) selective outsourcing and 3) total outsourcing. Results of the analysis revealed the higher perceived improvements for cloud users compared to non-cloud users for organizations that perform processes in-house and practice selective outsourcing. For organizations, which are inclined towards total outsourcing, the use of cloud does not lead to significantly higher improvements. The clusters with low number of cloud users and outsourcing perceived most improvements in basic accuracy and data quality, while the clusters with high number of cloud users perceived highest improvements in accessibility.
