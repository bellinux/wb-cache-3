5|$|Before {{passing through}} the Vatican City walls and {{terminating}} in the Vatican City railway station, the line passes under an arch decorated with the Coat of Arms of Pope Pius XI with a two-piece 35.5 ton iron gate which slides into the recesses of the Vatican walls. The gate is closed when there is <b>no</b> <b>traffic</b> scheduled on the line.|$|E
5|$|During {{the second}} half of the 20th century the number of {{companies}} using the railroad for shipping on Chicago's near north side declined severely. In the 1970s customers at the east end of the line included the Curtiss candy factory and the Jardine Water Purification Plant. The construction of the Columbus Drive Bridge in 1982 wiped out part of the right of way and the spur to Navy Pier was abandoned. Service to the Tribune Tower also ended in the 1980s, and by the 1990s traffic along the remaining section of the spur served only one customer, the Chicago Sun-Times, with only one train per day. The newspaper moved their printing plant out of downtown Chicago in early 2001 leaving <b>no</b> <b>traffic</b> across the bridge and it has since been permanently raised in the open position. On December 12, 2007 the bridge was one of 12 historic Chicago railroad bridges to be designated as Chicago Landmarks.|$|E

Highway 16 has <b>no</b> <b>traffic</b> lights but has two exits into Spruce Grove, while Highway 16A has several traffic intersections. Travelling east {{of either of}} these highways will lead to Edmonton. Travelling west on Highway 16A will lead to Stony Plain, and going west on either highway will lead to Edson, Hinton, and eventually Jasper.|$|E

25|$|Pedestrians {{must often}} cross {{from one side}} of a road to the other, and in doing so may come into the way of {{vehicles}} traveling on the road. In many places pedestrians are entirely left to look after themselves, that is, they must observe the road and cross when they can see that <b>no</b> <b>traffic</b> will threaten them. Busier cities usually provide pedestrian crossings, which are strips of the road where pedestrians are expected to cross.|$|E

Taxi service is also available within the compound. There are few if <b>no</b> <b>traffic</b> jams in Dhahran even in rush hours (with the exception of the security gates and around the core area). However, all traffic lights in Dhahran camp are computer-controlled to maximize the traffic flow.|$|E
25|$|The Tiberias Group {{which had}} {{provided}} the rearguards defending the Jordan River south of Lake Huleh, was reinforced at Quneitra by troops from Damascus. At 06:00 an RAF aerial reconnaissance reported {{a force of}} about 1,200 holding the high ground around Quneitra. By 11:40 {{the vanguard of the}} Australian Mounted Division was climbing the slopes of Tel Abu en Neda which overlooks Quneitra on the Golan Heights, while {{the main body of the}} division had reached Tel Abu el Khanzir.

25|$|Past the {{junction}} with NY238, which forks {{off to the}} southeast towards Attica, the highway begins going straight up and down into the creek valleys here at the northern fringe of the Allegheny Plateau. Passing lanes are sometimes available on the downhill sections, particularly in the next community to the east, Alexander, where another route to Attica, NY98 crosses via an overpass. This allows traffic to continue at a high speed through the surrounding dairy and sod farms up {{the other side and}} into Bethany, the next town, whose four four-way intersections offer <b>no</b> <b>traffic</b> control devices to slow down drivers.|$|E

25|$|The {{requirement}} of road signals that a stop light should be visible over a queue of traffic {{and as far}} back as possible (thus demanding an order with red above) does not apply to railways with a block signalling system as there is <b>no</b> <b>traffic</b> queuing within a block, there being only one train in a block at a time. With railway signals, red need not be at the top for maximum visibility over distance as the driver of a train will already be expecting a red signal, having passed a yellow one in the previous block. This advance warning is missing with road signals.|$|E
25|$|Traffic {{gradually}} {{moved away}} from the canal to the railways. In 1904, Endon basin was built, where limestone brought from the quarries by the railway could be transferred to boats. One of the major users of the limestone, based at Sandbach, closed in 1920, and the cable railway to Froghall closed in the same year. Limestone was no longer transhipped at Endon from 1930, and the canal saw virtually <b>no</b> <b>traffic.</b> Responsibility for the canal passed to the London, Midland and Scottish Railway in 1940, who closed the Leek branch under an Act of Parliament obtained in 1944. The last heavy commercial traffic was the transfer of coal from Endon to Cheddleton, which ceased in 1952.|$|E
25|$|The {{range of}} the beam can vary between 65 and 300 meters, {{depending}} on traffic conditions. In traffic, the low beam cutoff position is adjusted vertically to maximise seeing range while keeping glare out of leading and oncoming drivers' eyes. When <b>no</b> <b>traffic</b> is close enough for glare to be a problem, the system provides full high beam. Headlamps are adjusted every 40 milliseconds by a camera {{on the inside of}} the front windscreen which can determine distance to other vehicles. The S-Class, CLS-Class and C-Class also offer this technology. In the CLS, the adaptive high beam is realised with LED headlamps - the first vehicle producing all adaptive light functions with LEDs. Since 2010 some Audi models with Xenon headlamps are offering a similar system: adaptive light with variable headlight range control.|$|E

25|$|At the {{entrance}} of the city are statues of Ignacio Allende, Juan Aldama, Miguel Hidalgo and Josefa Ortiz de Dominguez, with one of the Archangel Michael in the center. While the outlying areas of the town and municipality have changed over time, the historic center remains much as it was 250 years ago. The layout of {{the center of the city}} is mostly a straight grid, which was favored by the Spanish during colonial times. However, due to the terrain, many roads are not straight. There are no parking meters, <b>no</b> <b>traffic</b> signals and no fast food restaurants. These roads are lined with colonial era homes and churches. With a few exceptions, the architecture is domestic rather than monumental, with well-tended courtyards and rich architectural details. The houses have solid walls against the sidewalks, painted in various colors, many with bougainvillea vines falling down the outside and the occasional iron-grated window. Many of the larger structures have large front doors which used to be used by horses and carriages.|$|E
25|$|Inside the lobby, Sweeny, District Engineer Farley and his firemen, Cain, and {{the other}} police {{officers}} eventually cleared the dress circle stairs {{to work their way}} up to the doors, where there was the connecting doorway to the family gallery stairway. They tried going up to the family gallery but were stopped by thick smoke. They heard <b>no</b> <b>traffic</b> on the stairway, heard no human sounds. They called up but received no response. Farley ordered one last inspection of the dress circle, but saw no activity. Nor was there any signs of life in the parquet and orchestra, below, now burning fiercely. To Farley the building seemed evacuated, barring, perhaps, a few stragglers. Not wanting to subject himself or others to any further risk, he ordered his men to quit the building. Within minutes, cracks appeared on the exterior theatre walls facing Johnson street, where, within, the heart of the blaze raged. At 11:45pm, less than a half hour after J. W. Thorpe had spied a flame no larger than his hand, the Johnson Street end of the building collapsed and an intense rush of air was drawn in, feeding the flames. Anyone who could speak of events transpiring within the building had already left.|$|E
500|$|The Neath and Tennant Canals are two {{independent}} but linked canals in South Wales {{that are usually}} regarded as a single canal. The Neath Canal was opened from Glynneath to Melincryddan, {{to the south of}} Neath, in 1795 and extended to Giant's Grave in 1799, in order to provide better shipping facilities. With several small later extensions it reached its final destination at Briton Ferry. <b>No</b> <b>traffic</b> figures are available, but it was successful, as dividends of 16 per cent were paid on the shares. The canal was [...] long and included 19 locks.|$|E
