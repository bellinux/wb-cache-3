5|$|The primary {{design change}} between the earlier F-5E and the F-5G {{was the use}} of a single General Electric F404 engine that was {{originally}} designed for the F/A-18 Hornet. The <b>new</b> <b>engine</b> provided 60% more thrust than the combined output of the F-5E's two General Electric J85s. This improved the aircraft's thrust-to-weight ratio from 1.0 to 1.13. The <b>new</b> <b>engine</b> gave a speed of over Mach2.0, a ceiling over 55,000ft (16,800m), an initial climb rate of 52,800ft per minute (16,100m/min).|$|E
5|$|The LEAP is a <b>new</b> <b>engine</b> design {{based on}} and {{designed}} to replace the CFM56 series, with 16% efficiency savings by using more composite materials and achieving higher bypass ratios of over 10:1. LEAP has entered service in 2016.|$|E
5|$|A {{separate}} partnership {{was formed}} between Rolls-Royce and Turbomeca {{to develop the}} Adour afterburning turbofan engine. The Br.121 was proposed with Turbomeca's Tourmalet engine for ECAT but Breguet preferred the RR RB.172 and their joint venture would use elements of both. The <b>new</b> <b>engine,</b> which {{would be used for}} the AFVG as well, would be built in Derby and Tarnos.|$|E

5|$|A test {{series was}} planned to {{determine}} RS-25 engine performance with: the <b>new</b> <b>engine</b> controller unit; lower liquid oxygen temperatures; greater inlet pressure {{due to the}} taller SLS core stage liquid oxygen tank and higher vehicle acceleration; and, more nozzle heating due to the four-engine configuration and its position in-plane with the SLS booster exhaust nozzles. New ablative insulation and heaters were to be tested during the series.|$|E
5|$|BioWare {{provided}} its Aurora Engine from Neverwinter Nights for the sequel. One of {{the decisions}} to use Aurora rather than build a <b>new</b> <b>engine</b> from scratch was the toolset—Obsidian wanted players {{to continue to be}} able to make content for the game, which may not have been possible with a <b>new</b> <b>engine.</b> BioWare made itself available to Obsidian with technical support on the engine, but Obsidian planned on completely overhauling Aurora, including its code. The designers wanted to improve the visuals of the first game with additions such as better lighting and textures, which required significant changes to the engine. The upgraded engine was referred to as Electron. Electron was designed to incorporate DirectX to make it compatible for a potential Xbox 360 release, but Obsidian eventually abandoned plans for a port to the system for financial reasons. The toolset that was used to create the game was also revamped, and included several additions like a customizable interface, a new dialogue format, and building assistants—similar to the wizards found in Microsoft Word and Excel. Like Neverwinter Nights, the toolset was included in the game's release for players to use.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{configuration}} of the Autodromo Nazionale Monza, with its high average speed, the teams set up their cars to produce the minimum amount of downforce possible. Williams introduced a revised FW23 specification for Montoya after one was used by Ralf Schumacher in Belgium. Williams equipped the earlier aerodynamic package on Ralf Schumacher's car on Sunday morning. Benetton brought a new front wing and Ferrari debuted a <b>new</b> <b>engine</b> specification with improved aerodynamics.|$|E

5|$|Featuring {{only four}} engines, the design also {{required}} <b>new</b> <b>engine</b> designs with greatly increased power and better fuel economy. In May 1964, airframe proposals arrived from Boeing, Douglas, General Dynamics, Lockheed, and Martin Marietta; engine proposals were submitted by General Electric, Curtiss-Wright, and Pratt & Whitney. After a downselect, Boeing, Douglas, and Lockheed were given additional study contracts for the airframe, along with General Electric and Pratt & Whitney for the engines.|$|E
5|$|Funcom {{decided to}} instead use a recent {{version of the}} Dreamworld engine, the same version used for their 2008 MMORPG Age of Conan. This <b>new</b> <b>engine</b> {{features}} improved water rendering, particle effects, and character animation. It also includes incremental improvements to technologies already used in Anarchy Online, such as the dynamic weather system. No new release date has been announced, although periodic status updates are published in the game's official weekly development blog Friday With Means.|$|E
5|$|Initially the <b>new</b> <b>engine</b> {{was plagued}} with problems, such as {{failure of the}} {{accessory}} gear trains and coolant jackets, and several different construction methods were tried before the basic design of the Merlin was set. Early production Merlins were also unreliable: Common problems were cylinder head cracking, coolant leaks, and excessive wear to the camshafts and crankshaft main bearings.|$|E

Airbus also considered using the <b>new</b> <b>Engine</b> Alliance GP7000 engine for the A330-300HGW, {{which would have been}} the engine's first twinjet application. The −300HGW was to enter airline service in 2004. However, the -300HGW programme was not launched and quietly disappeared.|$|E
5|$|The game runs on {{an entirely}} <b>new</b> <b>engine</b> that was adapted to fully take {{advantage}} of the Nintendo 64 strengths. Although Eurocom used original production material to authentically recreate the environments of the film, the company added elements to help the game design, including a mission which takes place in the London Underground. The game supports the Nintendo 64 Expansion Pak, which provides enhanced graphics and visual effects, but a Controller Pak is required to save the player's progress through the game.|$|E
5|$|Honda had {{previously}} competed in Formula One as a constructor when they purchased British American Racing in 2006, before selling {{the team to}} Brawn GP ahead of the 2009 season. With the sport introducing a brand-new engine formula in 2014 and Mercedes, their engine-supplier, establishing their own team, McLaren sought a <b>new</b> <b>engine</b> supplier {{with a view to}} a long-term relationship. The partnership with Honda was first announced in May 2013, and the RA615H engine spent the next eighteen months in development. The team used Mercedes' PU106A Hybrid engine in the McLaren MP4-29 throughout the 2014 season.|$|E

5|$|In 1870, a {{bill was}} {{introduced}} in the Senate called the Arctic Resolution, to fund an expedition to the North Pole. Hall, aided by the Secretary of the Navy George M. Robeson, successfully lobbied for, and received, a grant of $50,000 from the U.S. Congress to command the expedition and began recruiting personnel in late 1870. He secured the U.S. Navy tugboat Periwinkle, a 387-ton screw-propelled steamer. At the Washington Navy Yard the ship was fitted as a fore topsail schooner, and renamed Polaris. She was prepared for Arctic service by the addition of solid oak timber all over her hull, and the bow was sheathed in iron. A <b>new</b> <b>engine</b> was added, and one of the boilers was retrofitted to burn seal or whale oil.|$|E
5|$|In March 1993, {{under the}} September 1990 Tripartite MoU between the U.S., Italy, and Spain, eight EAV-8B Plus Matadors were ordered, {{along with a}} twin-seat TAV-8B. Deliveries of the Plus-standard {{aircraft}} started in 1996. On 11 May 2000, Boeing and the NAVAIR finalized a contract to remanufacture Spanish EAV-8Bs to bring them up to Plus standard. Boeing said the deal required it to remanufacture two EAV-8Bs, with an option for another seven aircraft; other sources say the total was 11 aircraft. The remanufacture allowed the aircraft to carry four AIM-120 AMRAAMs, enhanced the pilot's situational awareness through the installation of new radar and avionics, and provided a <b>new</b> <b>engine.</b> Eventually, five aircraft were modified, the last having been delivered on 5 December 2003.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, {{operating}} cost replaced capacity {{as the primary}} factor in airliner purchases. As a result, the 767's design process emphasized fuel efficiency from the outset. Boeing targeted a 20 to 30percent cost saving over earlier aircraft, mainly through <b>new</b> <b>engine</b> and wing technology. As development progressed, engineers used computer-aided design for {{over a third of}} the 767's design drawings, and performed 26,000 hours of wind tunnel tests. Design work occurred concurrently with the 757 twinjet, leading Boeing to treat both as almost one program to reduce risk and cost. Both aircraft would ultimately receive shared design features, including avionics, flight management systems, instruments, and handling characteristics. Combined development costs were estimated at $3.5 to $4billion.|$|E
50|$|Following the 2014 Crimean crisis, the Ukrainians {{refused to}} supply the Russian Navy with marine gas {{turbines}} from Zorya-Mashproekt, and so Saturn has been commissioned to design <b>new</b> <b>engines</b> for the Admiral Gorshkov and Admiral Grigorovich-class frigates.

5|$|IndiGo {{placed an}} order for 100 Airbus A320-200 {{aircraft}} worth US$6 billion in June 2005 during the Paris Air Show with plans to commence operations in mid-2006. The airline received its first A320 in July 2006 and planned to induct 100 aircraft by 2015–2016. IndiGo signed a memorandum of understanding for an additional 180 Airbus A320 aircraft including 150 with the <b>New</b> <b>Engine</b> Option (NEO) worth US$15 billion on 11 January 2011. In 2012, the airline took delivery of its 50th aircraft and the 100th aircraft was delivered on 4 November 2014, completing its initial order ahead of schedule.|$|E
5|$|Janeway {{begins to}} share Seven's suspicions and warns {{the crew to}} stay alert, but remains optimistic. The <b>new</b> <b>engine</b> system is {{compatible}} with Voyager, but the ship wouldn't {{be able to stand}} the stresses of the slipstream for long. The crew would have to abandon the ship to use the Dauntless to travel home. Seven states to Janeway that she would opt to stay behind, feeling that she {{would not be able to}} integrate back on Earth. Janeway reviews the message decoded by Arturis, and discovers the message to be fake. She transports to the Dauntless to confront Arturis. He tries to pin the blame on Seven, but Janeway rejects his claims. Arturis activates a panel on the ship, igniting the engines. All but Janeway and Seven are able to be transported out before the ship enters the slipstream.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{principal}} technologies that enabled an aircraft {{as large as the}} 747 to be drawn up was the high-bypass turbofan engine. The engine technology was thought to be capable of delivering double the power of the earlier turbojets while consuming a third less fuel. General Electric had pioneered the concept but was committed to developing the engine for the C-5 Galaxy and did not enter the commercial market until later. Pratt & Whitney was also working on the same principle and, by late 1966, Boeing, Pan Am and Pratt & Whitney agreed to develop a <b>new</b> <b>engine,</b> designated the JT9D to power the 747.|$|E
