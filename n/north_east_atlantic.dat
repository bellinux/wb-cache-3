25|$|Although North Sea oil {{production}} {{has been declining}} since 1999, an estimated 920 million tonnes of recoverable crude oil remained in 2009. Over {{two and a half}} billion tonnes were recovered from UK offshore oil fields between the first North Sea crude coming ashore in 1975 and 2002, with most oil fields being expected to remain economically viable until at least 2020. High oil prices have resulted in a resurgence of oil exploration, specifically in the <b>North</b> <b>East</b> <b>Atlantic</b> basin to the west of Shetland and the Outer Hebrides, in areas that were previously considered marginal and unprofitable. The North Sea oil and gas industry contributed £35billion to the UK economy (a little under 1% of GDP) in 2014 and is expected to decline in the coming years.|$|E
25|$|In {{the eastern}} Atlantic the southernmost record is from Angola, {{with the blue}} runner {{distributed}} extensively along the west African coast up to Morocco and into the Mediterranean Sea. The blue runner is found throughout the Mediterranean, having been recorded from nearly all the countries on its shores. The species is rarely found north of Portugal in the <b>north</b> <b>east</b> <b>Atlantic,</b> although records do exist of isolated catches from Madeira Island and Galicia, Spain. The furthest north {{it has been reported}} is southern Great Britain, where two specimens were taken in 1992 and 1993. There has been a trend of having this and other tropical species found further north more often, with publications indicating the blue runner has recently established stable populations in the Canary Islands, where it had been rarely sighted. Some authors have attributed this northward migration to rising sea surface temperatures, possibly the result of climate change.|$|E

Instead, <b>east</b> <b>Atlantic</b> cyclones exhibit an enhancement when diabatically generated midlevel potential vorticity is present (with the enhancement being of approximately equal magnitude to that associated with the potential vorticity in the upper-level trough).

40|$|Bycatch from {{interactions}} with fisherie s remains the biggest global threat to marine mammals. Galicia, north - west Spain, {{is one of}} the world’s main fishing regions and a high level of cetacean - fisheries interactions has been reported from on - board observers, interviews with fisheries stakeholde rs and analysis of stranded and by - caught carcasses. Delphinus delphis is the most abundant cetacean in the area and since 1990 necropsies of over 1800 stranded and by - caught Delphinus have been conducted. Life history data (age, maturity, and pregnancy ra te data) from stranded and by - caught cetaceans can be used to construct life tables and to estimate overall mortality and fisheries mortality rates. Age and maturity were determined from stranded and by - caught Delphinus between 1990 and 2009. Males and fem ales reach sexual maturity at 8. 5 and 7. 5 years of age, respectively, and no temporal difference in age at sexual maturity was observed. Results indicate 13 % annual mortality in the Delphinus delphis <b>north</b> - <b>east</b> <b>Atlantic</b> population and necropsy data suggest s that 60 % of mortality (i. e. 7. 2 % annual mortality) is attributable to fisheries interactions, predominantly from pair trawls and gillnets. By - caught Delphinus were found to die significantly younger than non - by - caught animals (p=< 0. 001) although no sex - r elated difference in bycatch rate was observed (p= 0. 051). The estimated annual mortality due to fisheries interactions greatly exceeds the 2 % limit set by ASCOBANS and the IWC and high bycatch rates are also reported for other countries e. g. the UK, France and Portugal. Although Delphinus delphis in the <b>north</b> - <b>east</b> <b>Atlantic</b> is one continuous population, the high level of bycatch occurring in parts of the range is most likely unsustainable and will be discussed. There is a need to carry out on - board monitorin g, notably in the north - west Iberian Peninsula (Galicia and Portugal), to incorporate cetacean bycatch into fisheries advice and, above all, to start introducing mitigation measures...|$|R

40|$|In {{the recent}} past, {{it has been}} put forward that {{recruitment}} of the <b>North</b> <b>Atlantic</b> albacore, <b>East</b> <b>Atlantic</b> bluefin tuna and North Atlantic swordfish {{could be related to}} the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). In this document, the biological processes behind the NAO/recruitment relationship are further investigated. Then, the possible relationship between the <b>East</b> <b>Atlantic</b> bluefin tuna recruitment was re-investigated. The linear relationship appeared to be only due to the low frequency signal, both BFT recruitment and NAO displaying a pseudo-cyclic upward trend, but year-to-year fluctuations were not synchronous. The superposed epoch analysis, that was conducted to test for possible non-linear and non-monotonous relationship did not reveal any clear connection. In conclusion, it appears that the available data on BFT recruitment cannot support the hypothesis of an impact of the NAO on BFT recruitment. Spatially disaggregated data are needed to further investigate this hypothesis. Finally, we stressed the interest to explore other mechanisms, such as the influence of the NAO on spatial distribution, migration routes and catchability. RÉSUM...|$|R
