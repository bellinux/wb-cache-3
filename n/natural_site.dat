5|$|The first site in Madagascar, the Strict Nature Reserve of the Tsingy of Bemaraha, was {{inscribed on}} the list as a site of natural {{importance}} at the 14th Session of the World Heritage Committee, held in Banff, Canada in 1990. This {{was followed by the}} 2001 inscription of the Royal Hill of Ambohimanga, a historic village and royal palace compound of cultural importance featuring well-preserved 19th-century palaces and numerous other natural and architectural features of historic, political and spiritual significance to the Malagasy people. Most recently, in 2007 the <b>natural</b> <b>site</b> of the Rainforests of the Atsinanana was added to the list, comprising a cluster of six national parks distinguished by their highly endemic biodiversity. A fourth site, the capital of the 19th century Merina sovereigns of Madagascar at the Rova of Antananarivo, had originally been slated to become the nation's first cultural World Heritage Site in 1995 but was destroyed by a fire shortly before the inscription was finalized.|$|E
25|$|Proposals for a {{helicopter}} ambulance in Bergen took form during the 1980s. There were two movements. One {{was based on}} private initiative backed by NLA. The other was the government. The first commission to look at Bergen in such a capacity was appointed in 1982. It recommended Bergen as a <b>natural</b> <b>site</b> of a base. This led {{to the establishment of}} the National Air Ambulance Service from 1 January 1988. Bergen became one of eight cities to receive an air ambulance.|$|E
500|$|In 1869, the Illinois state {{legislature}} established the West Park Commission, which {{was responsible for}} three large parks and interlinking boulevards. Later that year, on November 4, 1869 the commissioners named the southernmost park in honor of Stephen A. Douglas (1813–1861). Best remembered for his pre-Civil War presidential defeat by Abraham Lincoln despite superb oratorical skills, Douglas was a United States Senator who helped bring the Illinois Central Railroad to Chicago. In 1871, designer William Le Baron Jenney completed plans for the entire West Park System which included Douglas, Garfield, and Humboldt parks. Jenney's engineering expertise was especially helpful for transforming Douglas Park's poor <b>natural</b> <b>site</b> into parkland. He had manure from the Union Stock Yards and sand added to the marshy site. [...] This process brought the [...] of land to grade level. In {{the center of the}} landscape, Jenney created a picturesque lake, and a small section of the park was formally opened in 1879. Inflated construction costs and post Great Chicago Fire tax collection difficulties resulted in phased projects. The first improvements were made to the park by Oscar DuBuis in the 1880s. [...] Between 1886 and 1888 Douglas Park, like the other West Park System parks, replaced its greenhouse with a conservatory. In 1895, members of several German turners' clubs petitioned for an outdoor gymnasium, and the following year one of Chicago's first public facilities was constructed with an outdoor gymnasium (pictured right), swimming pool, and natatorium.|$|E
40|$|Sacred <b>natural</b> <b>sites</b> are {{frequently}} better protected than many officially protected areas, but an overall {{understanding of their}} role in conservation strategies is lacking. Over the last few years, scientists have assembled quantitative data from sacred <b>natural</b> <b>sites,</b> comparing their biodiversity values {{with those of the}} surroundings, officially protected areas and other management approaches such as forest reserves. This chapter draws on information from over a hundred studies throughout Africa and Asia, which provides concrete evidence that many sacred <b>natural</b> <b>sites</b> have great importance to biodiversity conservation, in addition to their spiritual value to one or more faith groups. Sacred <b>natural</b> <b>sites</b> appear to be extremely common in some countries, although much remains to be learned about their global extent, as research reported in the scientific literature tends to be focused on a few countries. Sacred <b>natural</b> <b>sites</b> are often the only remaining patches of natural or semi-natural habitat in cultural landscapes (see Figure 2. 1) and can contain rich biodiversity, sometimes exceeding nearby protected areas and forest reserves. However, a number of problems have been identified threatening the role of sacred <b>natural</b> <b>sites</b> in long term conservation strategies. They are often too small to support a full complement of expected species and many sites are suffering from increased anthropogenic pressure, in some cases exceeding the capacity of the ecosystem to maintain its integrity. Sacred <b>natural</b> <b>sites</b> are sometimes heavily modified or even planted; a proportion of these may nonetheless retain a rich complement of biodiversity at local level. Sacred <b>natural</b> <b>sites</b> are often recognized and used by local communities for their secular values, including medicinal plants, non timber forest products and other ecosystem services such as tourism or watershed protection. Unfortunately, many sacred <b>natural</b> <b>sites</b> are now under threat or have already disappeared in recent years. The pattern of loss has not been quantified but it is recognized to be increasing. Integration of sacred <b>natural</b> <b>sites</b> into conservation strategies can be complex but provides an important way of preserving these unique places and the biological and cultural values they represent. Where appropriate from social and conservation perspectives, the conservation of sacred <b>natural</b> <b>sites</b> should be included in national conservation plans...|$|R
50|$|Based on {{historical}} data, {{it is estimated}} that there are around 2500 sacred <b>natural</b> <b>sites</b> in Estonia, the largest of them covering up to 100 hectares. Although rather exceptional among most of the technologically developed countries, in Estonia both the sacred <b>natural</b> <b>sites</b> and indigenous customs connected to them are still in use. Therefore, the heritage that is connected to sacred <b>natural</b> <b>sites</b> has great importance to the national identity and environment of Estonians.|$|R
40|$|This {{work has}} had as its {{principal}} objectives {{the study of}} dominant height growth considering its age in three <b>natural</b> <b>sites,</b> and the determination of <b>natural</b> <b>sites</b> classification efficacy for the Araucaria angustifolia (Bert.) O. Ktze. in a planting stand in Canela, RS. For height and age data adjustment, determined through stem analysis, it was used the RICHARDS (1959) non-linear mathematics model, with two and three coefficients, resulting the three coefficient model as the most efficient to data adjustment of twelve dominant tree sampled on three <b>natural</b> <b>sites</b> in study. Seven groups of dominant trees with different trends growth were obtained, indicating that the <b>natural</b> <b>sites</b> classification did not detect with accuracy the effects of environmental  variables on height growth of Araucaria angustifolia. </p...|$|R
