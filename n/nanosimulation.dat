50|$|In {{addition}} to simulating individual modes, {{it is often}} more important to simulate a multi-modal network, since in reality modes are integrated and represent more complexities that each individual mode can overlook. Inter-modal network simulation can also better understand {{the impact of a}} certain network from a comprehensive perspective to more accurately represent its impact in order to realize important policy implications. An example of an inter-modal simulator is Commuter developed by Azalient which introduces both dynamic route and mode choice by agents during simulation - this type of modeling is referred to as <b>nanosimulation</b> as it considers demand and travel at a finer level of detail than traditional microsimulation.|$|E
40|$|Nanosimulations {{present a}} big HPC {{challenge}} as they present increasing performance demands in heterogeneous execution environments. In this paper, we present our optimization methodology for BigDFT, a <b>nanosimulation</b> software using Density Functional Theory. We explore autotuning possibilities for BigDFT's 3 D convolutions by studying optimization techniques for several architectures. Namely, {{we focus on}} processors with vector units and on GPU acceleration. We report on the portability and the performance gains of our approach (speedup x 2 on CPU, x 5 on GPU) and discuss the relation between algorithmic specifics, architecture and performance...|$|E
