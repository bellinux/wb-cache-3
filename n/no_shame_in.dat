They also argue that it is sensible to submit to one's superiors, stand firm against one's equals, and be moderate to one's inferiors.

Nearly half didn't even tell their mothers. The message of those speaking out: It's {{not always easy to}} get pregnant, and there's <b>no</b> <b>shame</b> <b>in</b> that.|$|E

2500|$|The Australian press {{attacked}} the team, {{and called for}} changes, including the omission of the captain, Johnson. Acerbic cricket pundit and former Test cricketer and team-mate Sid Barnes called Johnson [...] "Australia's non-playing captain".

[...] There would have been <b>no</b> <b>shame</b> <b>in</b> standing down." [...] Johnson, Miller and Gil Langley were the tour selectors. Langley and Miller were willing to omit Johnson, {{but only if the}} captain volunteered to stand aside. Johnson did not volunteer, so the others did not discuss the topic. The only change occurred when Miller proposed the replacement of Peter Burge with Ian Craig. This change came after a long silence between the trio as they waited for the others to bring up Johnson's form. Writing after the tour, Miller stated [...] "Privately I thought that [...] was not a form selection. [...] On the other hand, I did not think it wise to change skippers in midstream." [...] Miller and Johnson had both been appointed as Members of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 1956 New Year Honours, and between the Tests they attended their formal investiture.|$|E
2500|$|In 2007, {{although}} they led {{the table before}} {{the final round of}} matches, Lancashire were again runners-up in the County Championship. After being knocked out of the Twenty20 competition in the group states and performing poorly in the other one-day competitions early in the season, supporters started to become discontented with the captain and coach. Sussex ended up winning the title as Lancashire lost their final match of the competition against Surrey. Chris Adams, the Sussex captain, said [...] "you played well, you had a hard season, there's <b>no</b> <b>shame</b> <b>in</b> your performance and you nearly did it". After the match against Surrey, Chilton was in tears and said [...] "I'm extremely proud of what our guys have achieved though. As captain I'm privileged to have seen the efforts they have put in. To get close to our target was a phenomenal effort but the lads are just broken. Our players have risen to an almighty challenge and to come so close is an enormous effort". After three years as captain, Mark Chilton stepped down in October 2007 and was replaced by Stuart Law who is the most successful captain in Australian domestic cricket. However his captaincy lasted for just one season, and Lancashire again failed to claim any silverware. At {{the end of the season}} Law and veteran player Cork were released, with Chapple replacing Law as captain. In December 2008, Watkinson's job as cricket manager was changed to that of director of cricket– a job which would focus solely on aspects of cricket, rather than the traditional all-encompassing job of general team management. The move was explained by the club chairman as an effort to modernise. In February 2009, it was announced that Peter Moores– who had been sacked as England coach the previous month– would be Lancashire's new coach and had a three-year contract. In 2011 Chapple and Moores took Lancashire to their first outright first-class county championship title since 1934, {{although they}} had shared the title with Surrey in 1950. Despite being reigning champions in 2012, Lancashire had a poor season and were relegated to the Second Division. In 2013 they bounced straight back to Division 1 by winning the second division championship with a game to spare. They were once again relegated to Division 2 on the last day of the 2014 season after failing to win a tightly fought game against Middlesex. Ashley Giles (formerly of Warwickshire and England) was appointed as Director of Cricket and Head Coach after Mike Watkinson stepped down from the role in October 2014.|$|E

25|$|But for me {{that saying}} of Pittacus doesn’t ring true either (even {{if he was a}} smart man): he says “being good is hard.” For me, a man's good enough as long as he's not lawless, and if he has the common {{sense of right and wrong}} that does a city good—a decent guy.

60|$|In {{the way of}} food, they had, at least, {{vegetables}} in their little gardens, pigs and chickens to kill, eggs to fry into omelets with oil, wine to drink, and many other things to make life comfortable.
