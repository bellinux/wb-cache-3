40|$|Deep {{sequencing}} {{was used}} to discover a novel rhabdovirus (Bas-Congo virus, or BASV) associated with a 2009 outbreak of 3 human cases of acute hemorrhagic fever in Mangala village, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Africa. The cases, presenting over a 3 -week period, were characterized by abrupt disease onset, high fever, mucosal hemorrhage, and, in two patients, death within 3 days. BASV was detected in an acute serum sample from the lone survivor at a concentration of 1. 09 × 10 (6) RNA copies/mL, and 98. 2 % of the genome was subsequently de novo assembled from ≈ 140 million sequence reads. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that BASV is highly divergent and shares less than 34 % amino acid identity with any other rhabdovirus. High convalescent neutralizing antibody titers of > 1 : 1000 were detected in the survivor and an asymptomatic nurse directly caring for him, {{both of whom were}} health care workers, suggesting the potential for human-to-human transmission of BASV. The <b>natural</b> <b>animal</b> <b>reservoir</b> host or arthropod vector and precise mode of transmission for the virus remain unclear. BASV is an emerging human pathogen associated with acute hemorrhagic fever in Africa...|$|E
40|$|The {{mammalian}} gastrointestinal (GI) tract is colonized by {{a complex}} consortium of bacterial species. Bacteria engage in chemical signaling to coordinate population-wide behavior. However, {{it is unclear}} if chemical sensing {{plays a role in}} establishing mammalian host–bacterial commensal relationships. Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) is a deadly human pathogen but {{is a member of the}} GI flora in cattle, its main reservoir. EHEC harbors SdiA, a regulator that senses acyl-homoserine lactones (AHLs) produced by other bacteria. Here, we show that SdiA is necessary for EHEC colonization of cattle and that AHLs are prominent within the bovine rumen but absent in other areas of the GI tract. We also assessed the rumen metagenome of heifers, and we show that it is dominated by Clostridia and/or Bacilli but also harbors Bacteroidetes. Of note, some members of the Bacteroidetes phyla have been previously reported to produce AHLs. SdiA-AHL chemical signaling aids EHEC in gauging these GI environments, and promotes adaptation to a commensal lifestyle. We show that chemical sensing in the mammalian GI tract determines the niche specificity for colonization by a commensal bacterium of its <b>natural</b> <b>animal</b> <b>reservoir.</b> Chemical sensing may be a general mechanism used by commensal bacteria to sense and adapt to their mammalian hosts. Additionally, because EHEC is largely prevalent in cattle herds, interference with SdiA-mediated cattle colonization is an exciting alternative to diminish contamination of meat products and cross-contamination of produce crops because of cattle shedding of this human pathogen...|$|E
40|$|The {{occurrence}} of mycotic agents was investigated by hair-brush technique on the coat of 162 naturalized coypus (Myocastor coypus) and 64 indigenous brown rats (Rattus norvegicus) originating {{from the same}} protected area in Central Italy. The isolates from positive coypus (29. 6 %) were identified as Microsporum gypseum (14. 8 %), Trichophyton terrestre (9. 8 %), Alternaria sp. (3. 7 %), Trichophyton mentagrophytes (2. 5 %), Cladosporium sp. (1. 8 %), Scopulariopsis sp. (1. 2 %), and Chrysosporium keratinophilum (0. 6 %), whereas the isolates from positive rats (46. 7 %) were identified as M. gypseum (28. 1 %), T. mentagrophytes (12. 5 %), Chrysosporium tropicum and T. terrestre (3. 1 % each), and Chrysosporium inops (1. 6 %). Statistically, brown rats {{were more likely to}} harbor fungal agents (P < 0. 05) on their coat than coypus, especially T. mentagrophytes (P < 0. 01) and M. gypseum (P < 0. 05). No positive animal showed dermatological lesions. The present results are the first providing basic information on the coat's mycoflora of a wild coypu population. It is concluded that the coypu, an allochthonous rodent in Italy, can play a role as <b>natural</b> <b>animal</b> <b>reservoir</b> of dermatophytes and as carrier of keratinophilic and saprophytic fungi within its new habitat, though to a lesser extent than indigenous rats. Therefore, people who are exposed to the risk of contact with the coat of rats and coypus should take all the cautions needed to protect themselves from mycotic agents potentially transmissible to humans...|$|E
40|$|The gene {{encoding}} V antigen from Yersinia pestis was cloned {{into the}} plasmid expression vector pGEX- 5 X- 2. When electroporated into Escherichia coli JM 109, the recombinant expressed V antigen as a stable fusion protein with glutathione S-transferase. The glutathione S-transferase–V fusion protein was isolated from recombinant E. coli and cleaved with factor Xa to yield purified V antigen as a stable product. Recombinant V antigen was inoculated intraperitoneally into mice and shown to induce a {{protective immune response}} against a subcutaneous challenge with 3. 74 3 106 CFU of virulent Y. pestis. Protection correlated with the induction of a high titer of serum antibodies and a T-cell response specific for recombinant V antigen. These results indicate that V antigen should be {{a major component of}} an improved vaccine for plague. Plague is a zoonotic infection caused by the bacterium Yer-sinia pestis and is transmitted among <b>natural</b> <b>animal</b> <b>reservoirs,</b> usually by a flea vector. Humans are an occasional host in the natural cycle of the disease, and bubonic plague, characterized by the swelling of local lymph nodes, may occur following the bite of an infected flea.

40|$|The filoviruses, Marburg virus (MARV) and Ebola virus (EBOV), are causative {{agents of}} severe hemorrhagic fever with high {{mortality}} rates in humans and non-human primates. Sporadic outbreaks of filovirus infection {{have occurred in}} Central Africa and parts of Asia. Identification of the <b>natural</b> <b>reservoir</b> <b>animals</b> that are unknown yet and epidemiological investigations are current challenges to forestall outbreaks of filovirus diseases. The filovirus species identified currently include one in the MARV group and five in the EBOV group, with large genetic variations found among the species. Therefore, it {{has been difficult to}} develop a single sensitive assay to detect all filovirus species, which would advance laboratory diagnosis greatly in endemic areas. In this study, a highly sensitive universal RT-PCR assay targeting the nucleoprotein (NP) gene of filoviruses was developed. The genomic RNAs of all known MARV and EBOV species were detected by using an NP-specific primer set. In addition, this RT-PCR procedure was verified further for its application to detect viral RNAs in tissue samples of animals infected experimentally and blood specimens of infected patients. This assay will be a useful method for diagnostics and epidemiological studies of filovirus infections...|$|R

40|$|Studies of {{the rabbit}} tick {{reported}} in this paper were carried on {{as part of a}} broad investigation of certain wild ani-mals and game birds as reservoirs of human disease. The importance of wild <b>animals</b> as <b>reservoirs</b> of disease is in-creasingly appreciated as our knowledge of such diseases as tularemia and spotted fever develops. The occurrence of wild-animal diseases in human beings depends primarily upon the distribution of sus-ceptible animals and the incidence of infection within the <b>animal</b> <b>reservoir.</b> The spread of both tularemia and spotted fever among wild animals appears to be due particularly to the rabbit tick, al-though this tick is not a significant factor in the transmission of disease to human beings, since it does not bite man.

40|$|Francisella tularensis, the causative {{agent of}} tularemia, is a {{paradigm}} among human pathogens. This Gram-negative bacterium has an intracellular lifestyle, which probably reflects an adaptation to its <b>natural</b> <b>animal</b> and protozoa <b>reservoirs.</b> This {{is one of}} the most infectious agents in humans and animals; only a few bacteria are needed to induce a severe infection in both types of hosts. The clinical presentation and severity of human tularemia varies according to the portal of entry of bacteria, the bacterial inoculum, the virulence of the infecting strain, and the immune response of the host. Although most infections occur after direct inoculation of bacteria through the skin (through skin wounds or bites of arthropods), pneumonia due to inhalation of infected aerosols is the most feared of the clinical forms of the disease, particularly in the context of biological threat. Two subspecies are responsible for tularemia (subsp. tularensis and subsp. holarctica), and several clades have been described for each, which might be associated with changes in disease severity in humans. Tularemia is also more severe in people with an impaired immune response. No safe vaccine is currently available for prophylaxis of tularemia in humans. On the other hand, control of proliferation of F. tularensis in wildlife is not feasible. Thus, only the anti-infective agents are used for treatment and prophylaxis of human tularemia. The standard options include aminoglycosides (gentamicin), tetracyclines (eg, doxycycline) and fluoroquinolones (eg, ciprofloxacin). The selection of acquired resistance to these antibiotics in F. tularensis, especially in the context of a biological threat, may quickly limit the therapeutic options. New prophylactic and therapeutic alternatives must be developed rapidly. The present Research Topic focuses on potential new strategies for treatment of tularemia, including the development and evaluation of new compounds having proper antibacterial activity, reducing the virulence of F. tularensis or enhancing the immune host response...|$|R
