5|$|With the {{infantry}} heavily engaged, Eugene's cavalry picked {{its way across}} the <b>Nebel.</b> After an initial success, his first line of cavalry, under the Imperial General of Horse, Prince Maximilian of Hanover, were pressed by the second line of Marsin's cavalry, and were forced back across the <b>Nebel</b> in confusion. Nevertheless, the exhausted French were unable to follow up their advantage, and the two cavalry forces tried to regroup and reorder their ranks. However, without cavalry support, and threatened with envelopment, the Prussian and Danish infantry were in turn forced to pull back across the <b>Nebel.</b> Panic gripped some of Eugene's troops as they crossed the stream. Ten infantry colours were lost to the Bavarians, and hundreds of prisoners taken; it was only through the leadership of Eugene and the Prussian Prince that the imperial infantry were prevented from abandoning the field.|$|E
5|$|On the Allied right, Eugene's Prussian and Danish {{forces were}} desperately {{fighting}} the numerically superior {{forces of the}} Elector and Marsin. The Prince of Anhalt-Dessau led forward four brigades across the <b>Nebel</b> to assault the well-fortified position of Lutzingen. Here, the <b>Nebel</b> was less of an obstacle, but the great battery positioned {{on the edge of}} the village enjoyed a good field of fire across the open ground stretching to the hamlet of Schwennenbach. As soon as the infantry crossed the stream, they were struck by Maffei's infantry, and salvoes from the Bavarian guns positioned both in front of the village and in enfilade on the wood-line to the right. Despite heavy casualties the Prussians attempted to storm the great battery, whilst the Danes, under Count Scholten, attempted to drive the French infantry out of the copses beyond the village.|$|E
5|$|Whilst {{these events}} around Blenheim and Lutzingen were taking place, Marlborough was {{preparing}} to cross the <b>Nebel.</b> The centre, commanded by the Duke's brother, General Charles Churchill, consisted of 18 battalions of infantry arranged in two lines: seven battalions in the front line to secure a foothold across the <b>Nebel,</b> and 11 battalions in the rear providing cover from the Allied side of the stream. Between the infantry were placed two lines, 72 squadrons of cavalry. The first line of foot was to pass the stream first and march as far {{to the other side}} as could be conveniently done. This line would then form and cover the passage of the horse, leaving gaps in the line of infantry large enough for the cavalry to pass through and take their position in front.|$|E

50|$|To the {{surprise}} of WOR's management, <b>Nebel's</b> show was a quick success among New York's night-owls and early risers. Unidentified flying objects were discussed almost daily, alongside topics such as voodoo, witchcraft, parapsychology, hypnotism, conspiracy theories, and ghosts. Perhaps fittingly for an overnight show, one of <b>Nebel's</b> sponsors was No-Doz caffeine pills.|$|R

5|$|Prince Eugene was {{expected}} to be in position by 11:00, but due to the difficult terrain and enemy fire, progress was slow. Lord Cutts' column – who by 10:00 had expelled the enemy from two water mills upon the <b>Nebel</b> – had already deployed by the river against Blenheim, enduring over the next three hours severe fire from a heavy six-gun battery posted near the village. The rest of Marlborough's army, waiting in their ranks on the forward slope, were also forced to bear the cannonade from the French artillery, suffering 2,000 casualties before the attack could even start. Meanwhile, engineers repaired a stone bridge across the <b>Nebel,</b> and constructed five additional bridges or causeways across the marsh between Blenheim and Oberglauheim. Marlborough's anxiety was finally allayed when, just past noon, Colonel Cadogan reported that Eugene's Prussian and Danish infantry were in place – the order for the general advance was given. At 13:00, Cutts was ordered to attack the village of Blenheim whilst Prince Eugene was requested to assault Lutzingen on the Allied right flank.|$|E
5|$|The Danish cavalry, {{under the}} Duke of Württemberg-Neuenstadt (not to be {{confused}} with the Duke of Württemberg who fought with Eugene), had made slow work of crossing the <b>Nebel</b> near Oberglau; harassed by Marsin's infantry near the village, the Danes were driven back across the stream. Count Horn's Dutch infantry managed to push the French back from the water's edge, but it was apparent that before Marlborough could launch his main effort against Tallard, Oberglauheim would have to be secured.|$|E
5|$|When Henson {{began work}} on Sam and Friends, he asked fellow University of Maryland sophomore Jane <b>Nebel</b> to assist him. The show was a {{financial}} success, but after graduating from college, Henson began to have doubts about going into a career performing with puppets. He spent several months in Europe, where he was inspired by European puppet performers, who looked on their work as an art form. Upon Henson's return to the United States, he and Jane began dating. They were married in 1959 and had five children, Lisa (b. 1960), Cheryl (b. 1961), Brian (b. 1963), John (b. 1965, d. 2014), and Heather (b. 1970).|$|E

5|$|Count Horn {{directed}} the Prince of Holstein-Beck {{to take the}} village, but his two Dutch brigades were cut down by the French and Irish troops, capturing and badly wounding the Prince during the action. The battle was now in the balance. If Holstein-Beck's Dutch column were destroyed, the Allied army would be split in two: Eugene's wing would be isolated from Marlborough's, passing the initiative to the Franco-Bavarian forces now engaged across the whole plain. Seeing the opportunity, Marsin ordered his cavalry to change from facing Eugene, and turn towards their right and the open flank of Churchill's infantry drawn {{up in front of}} Unterglau. Marlborough (who had crossed the <b>Nebel</b> on a makeshift bridge to take personal control), ordered Hulsen's Hanoverian battalions to support the Dutch infantry. A Dutch cavalry brigade under Averock was also called forward but soon came under pressure from Marsin's more numerous squadrons.|$|E
5|$|Marlborough now {{requested}} Eugene {{to release}} Count Hendrick Fugger and his Imperial Cuirassier brigade to help repel the French cavalry thrust. Despite his own desperate struggle, the Imperial Prince at once complied, demonstrating {{the high degree}} of confidence and mutual co-operation between the two generals. Although the <b>Nebel</b> stream lay between Fugger's and Marsin's squadrons, the French were forced to change front to meet this new threat, thus forestalling the chance for Marsin to strike at Marlborough's infantry. Fugger's cuirassiers charged and, striking at a favourable angle, threw back Marsin's squadrons in disorder. With support from Colonel Blood's batteries, the Hessian, Hanoverian and Dutch infantry – now commanded by Count Berensdorf – succeeded in pushing the French and Irish infantry back into Oberglauheim so that they could not again threaten Churchill's flank as he moved against Tallard. The French commander in the village, the Marquis de Blainville, numbered amongst the heavy casualties.|$|E

25|$|Gleason {{was greatly}} {{interested}} in the paranormal, buying and reading numerous books on the topic, {{as well as on}} parapsychology and UFOs. During the 1950s he was a semi-regular guest on a paranormal-themed overnight radio show hosted by John <b>Nebel,</b> and wrote the introduction to Donald Bain's biography of <b>Nebel.</b> After his death, his large book collection was donated to the library of the University of Miami.

50|$|<b>Nebel's</b> program {{gave the}} {{impression}} of being freewheeling and unpredictable, prone to sidetracks and digressions; very different from the precise, mannered approach of most contemporary radio.
