40|$|Constitutive {{activation}} of the transcription factor STAT 3 contributes to the pathogenesis of many cancers, including multiple myeloma (MM). Since STAT 3 is dispensable in most normal tissue, targeted inhibition of STAT 3 is an attractive therapy for patients with these cancers. To identify STAT 3 inhibitors, we developed a transcriptionally based assay and screened a library of compounds known to be safe in humans. We found the drug <b>nifuroxazide</b> {{to be an effective}} inhibitor of STAT 3 function. <b>Nifuroxazide</b> inhibits the constitutive phosphorylation of STAT 3 in MM cells by reducing Jak kinase autophosphorylation, and leads to down-regulation of the STAT 3 target gene Mcl- 1. <b>Nifuroxazide</b> causes a decrease in viability of primary myeloma cells and myeloma cell lines containing STAT 3 activation, but not normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Although bone marrow stromal cells provide survival signals to myeloma cells, <b>nifuroxazide</b> can overcome this survival advantage. Reflecting the interaction of STAT 3 with other cellular pathways, <b>nifuroxazide</b> shows enhanced cytotoxicity when combined with either the histone deacetylase inhibitor depsipeptide or the MEK inhibitor UO 126. Therefore, using a mechanistic-based screen, we identified the clinically relevant drug <b>nifuroxazide</b> as a potent inhibitor of STAT signaling that shows cytotoxicity against myeloma cells that depend on STAT 3 for survival...|$|E
40|$|A {{new method}} for the {{sequential}} determination of attapulgite and <b>nifuroxazide</b> in pharmaceutical formulations by first- and second-derivative spectrophotometry, respectively, has been developed.

The results show that a previous hydrolysis of 2 h in 1. 0 x 10 (- 1) M NaOH solution is {{necessary in order to}} obtain stable compounds for analytical purposes. Subsequently, the first- and second-derivative spectra were evaluated directly in the same samples. The sequential determination of the drugs can be performed using the zero-crossing method; the attapulgite determination was carried out using the first derivative at 278. 0 nm and the <b>nifuroxazide</b> determination, using the second derivative at 282. 0 nm.

This study {{was trying to}} investigate whether miR- 200 a, a vital regulator in cell proliferation, migration and apoptosis, also has a role in oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R) injured NSCs. In this study, primary NSCs were subjected to OGD/R conditions to mimic an in vitro CI model. Before OGD/R induction, NSCs were transfected with vector or shRNA against miR- 200 a to overexpress or suppress miR- 200 a expression. The changes in cell viability, apoptosis, migration, the expression of c-Myc, and the phosphorylation of STAT 1, STAT 3 and MAPK were respectively assessed. Inhibitors of STAT 1 / 3 and MAPK, i. e., <b>Nifuroxazide</b> and BIRB 796, were used to administrate miR- 200 a-silenced NSCs, and the expressions of above mentioned proteins were detected. After OGD/R exposure, miR- 200 a was up-regulated in NSCs (P < 0. 001). miR- 200 a silencing alleviated OGD/R-induced the decrease of cell viability and migration (P < 0. 01); meanwhile, alleviated OGD/R-induced apoptosis via reducing Bax/Bcl- 2 ratio and down-regulating p 53 and cytochrome c (P < 0. 01 or P < 0. 001). c-Myc, p-STAT 1, p-STAT 3, p-MAPK were all negatively regulated by miR- 200 a (P < 0. 01 or P < 0. 001); more important, the increase of c-Myc induced by miR- 200 a silencing was abolished by <b>Nifuroxazide</b> or BIRB 796 (P < 0. 01 or P < 0. 001).

40|$|Abstract Background Malignant {{melanoma}} is {{an aggressive}} type of skin cancer, and despite {{recent advances in}} treatment, the survival rate of the metastatic form remains low. <b>Nifuroxazide</b> analogues are drugs based on the substitution of the nitrofuran group by benzofuroxan, {{in view of the}} pharmacophore similarity of the nitro group, improving bioavailability, with higher intrinsic activity and less toxicity. Benzofuroxan activity involves the intracellular production of free-radical species. In the present work, we evaluated the antitumor effects of different benzofuroxan derivatives in a murine melanoma model. Methods B 16 F 10 -Nex 2 melanoma cells were used to investigate the antitumor effects of Benzofuroxan derivatives in vitro and in a syngeneic melanoma model in C 57 Bl/ 6 mice. Cytotoxicity, morphological changes and reactive oxygen species (ROS) were assessed by a diphenyltetrasolium reagent, optical and fluorescence microscopy, respectively. Annexin-V binding and mitochondrial integrity were analyzed by flow cytometry. Western blotting and colorimetry identified cell signaling proteins. Results Benzofuroxan N-Br and N-I derivatives were active against murine and human tumor cell lines, exerting significant protection against metastatic melanoma in a syngeneic model. N-Br and N-I induce apoptosis in melanoma cells, evidenced by specific morphological changes, DNA condensation and degradation, and phosphatidylserine translocation in the plasma membrane. The intrinsic mitochondrial pathway in B 16 F 10 -Nex 2 cells is suggested owing to reduced outer membrane potential in mitochondria, followed by caspase − 9, − 3 activation and cleavage of PARP. The cytotoxicity of N-Br and N-I in B 16 F 10 -Nex 2 cells is mediated by the generation of ROS, inhibited by pre-incubation of the cells with N-acetylcysteine (NAC). The induction of ROS by N-Br and N-I resulted in the inhibition of AKT activation, an important molecule related to tumor cell survival, followed by upregulation of BIM. Conclusion We conclude that N-Br and N-I are promising agents aiming at cancer treatment. They may be useful in melanoma therapy as inducers of intrinsic apoptosis and by exerting significant antitumor activity against metastatic melanoma, as presently shown in syngeneic mice.
