METHOD: The survival of worms under oxidative stress conditions induced by paraquat was evaluated with and without in vivo <b>N-acetyl-L-cysteine</b> treatment. The effect of <b>N-acetyl-L-cysteine</b> on the response to other environmental stressors, including heat stress and ultraviolet irradiation (UV), was also monitored. To investigate the effect on aging, we examined changes in lifespan, fertility, and expression of age-related biomarkers in C. elegans after <b>N-acetyl-L-cysteine</b> treatment. RESULTS: Dietary <b>N-acetyl-L-cysteine</b> supplementation significantly increased resistance to oxidative stress, heat stress, and UV irradiation in C. elegans. In addition, <b>N-acetyl-L-cysteine</b> supplementation significantly extended both the mean and maximum lifespan of C. elegans. The mean lifespan was extended by up to 30. 5 % with 5 mM <b>N-acetyl-L-cysteine</b> treatment, and the maximum lifespan was increased by 8 days. <b>N-acetyl-L-cysteine</b> supplementation also increased the total number of progeny produced and extended the gravid period of C. elegans.

DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. SETTING: Multidisciplinary intensive care unit at a university teaching hospital. PATIENTS: Twenty patients (<b>N-acetyl-L-cysteine</b> group [n = 10], placebo group [n = 10]), 15 male and five female, of mean age 64 +/- 15 (SD) yrs and Acute Physiology and Chronic health Evaluation (APACHE) II score 33 +/- 6, with septic shock within 24 hrs of diagnosis. INTERVENTIONS: After a 2 -hr stabilization period (time-zero minus 2 hrs to time-zero), patients received either <b>N-acetyl-L-cysteine</b> in 5 % dextrose (150 mg/kg in 100 mL over 15 mins, followed by 50 mg/kg in 250 mL over 4 hrs, and then 100 mg/kg/ 24 hrs in 500 mL for 44 hrs; <b>N-acetyl-L-cysteine</b> group) or the equivalent volume of 5 % dextrose (placebo group). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Hemodynamic and oxygen transport indices were measured at time-zero minus 2 hrs and time-zero, and at multiple time points thereafter until completion of the trial infusion (time-zero plus 48 hrs). A daily Organ Failure Score was recorded for 14 days. Treatment group demographics and hemodynamic variables {{did not differ significantly}} between the two groups at time-zero.

40|$|Introduction: Methionine is an {{essential}} sulfuric amino acid, which, according to numerous studies, has {{a role in the}} reduction of inflammation, caused by changes in colon, and inhibits important pathways in the development of numerous gastrointestinal disorders. However, subchronic methionine loading leads to oxidative stress, which is a potential cause of disease of numerous organs, digestive tract being one of them. <b>N-acetyl-L-cysteine</b> is a natural antioxidant, which affects some of the important signaling pathways and has a potential therapeutic role in treatment of colon disorders. Aim: To examine the influence of <b>N-acetyl-L-cysteine</b> on histological parameters of rat colon, after subchronic methionine load. Material and methods: Experiments were conducted on 15 - 20 days old male (Wistar albino) rats, weighing 160 g. There were used 24 animals in the experiment, divided into 3 groups, with eight animals per group. First, control group (K), received NaCl, second group received methionine (M group), while third group received methionine + <b>N-acetyl-L-cysteine</b> (N group). The rats were sacrificed after 21 day and tissue samples of colon were obtained. In all of the three groups, changes of histological parameters of rat colon were analyzed. Results: Methionine load leads to statistically significant increase (p < 0. 01) in crypt depth of rat colon, lamina muscularis mucosae thickness, the mucosal thickness and increase in lamina propria cell density compared to control, while N-acetyl- L-cysteine application showed statistically significant decrease (p < 0. 01) of these histological parameters compared to M group.

Bovine hoof surface is more porous than nail surface although there were no differences between the mean surface pore sizes. Hydration and <b>N-acetyl-l-cysteine</b> increased the roughness and apparent surface porosity, and the porosity determined by mercury intrusion porosimetry of both membranes. Pore-CorTM was used to generate tridimensional structures having percolation characteristics comparable to nail and hooves.

For this purpose, a total of 430 sputum specimens were processed by the <b>N-acetyl-l-cysteine</b> concentration, sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) liquefaction, chitin sedimentation, and direct microscopy methods. Then, the smear sensitivity for acid-fast bacillus detection by chitin-treated sputum was compared with the sensitivity of smears prepared by other methods. Our results showed that the chitin solution took less time to completely homogenize the mucoid sputum than did the <b>N-acetyl-l-cysteine</b> and NaOCl methods. The <b>N-acetyl-l-cysteine</b> concentration method demonstrated sensitivity and specificity levels of 83 and 97 %, respectively. In comparison, the sensitivity of chitin sedimentation was 80 %, with a specificity of 96. 7 %. The NaOCl liquefaction method showed a sensitivity of 78 %, with a specificity of 96 %. Finally, the sensitivity of direct microscopy was lower than those of the other tested methods and was only 46 %, with a specificity of 90 %. The chitin and NaOCl liquefaction methods are both easy to perform, and they do not require additional equipment (centrifuges). Also, our results demonstrated that the chitin method is less time-consuming than the NaOCl method, since only 30 min of incubation is required to bring complete sedimentation of bacilli in chitin-treated sputum whereas the NaOCl method needs 10 to 12 h to give the same results in the same sputum specimens.

40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} whether permeation enhancement techniques affect the nail plate. Methods: Infrared and impedance spectroscopies {{examined the effects}} of hydration, iontophoresis and <b>N-acetyl-L-cysteine</b> on the human nail. Results: While significant shifts to higher wavenumbers were observed for the symmetric and asymmetric -CH 2 stretching vibrations these changes were essentially the same for the three treatments suggesting they were principally due to hydration alone. Spectral changes associated with amide bonds from nail protein were particularly evident post-treatment with <b>N-acetyl-L-cysteine.</b> The alternating current conductivity and permittivity of the nail, particularly at low frequencies, increased with hydration. Iontophoresis increased the low frequency ac conductivity of the nail but had less effect on the nail capacitance/permittivity. Further, the effects seemed to return gradually to baseline after termination of current passage. Treatment with N-acetyl-Lcysteine produced a greater perturbation, leading to increased low-frequency conductivity and a shift of the frequency-dependent conductivity region to a higher frequency. Conclusions: Overall, the effects of iontophoresis on infrared and impedance spectroscopic profiles of the nail were attributable simply to increased hydration and similar to those observed after skin iontophoresis.

Here, we investigated the action of three antioxidants in orbital fibroblasts, namely, vitamin C, <b>N-acetyl-l-cysteine,</b> and melatonin. Methods: Primary cultures of orbital fibroblasts from six GO patients and six control subjects were established. Cells were treated with H 2 O 2 to induce oxidative stress. Cell vitality assays were performed to determine the non-cytotoxic dose of each antioxidant. The following assays were performed: glutathione disulfide (GSSG), as a measure of oxidative stress, cell proliferation, hyaluronic acid (HA), TNFÎ±, IFNÎ³, and IL 1 Î². Results: H 2 O 2 induced oxidative stress (augmented GSSG), increased cell proliferation as well as cytokine release, but did not affect HA release. All of the three antioxidant substances reduced H 2 O 2 -dependent oxidative stress. Vitamin C reduced proliferation in GO, but not in control fibroblasts. <b>N-acetyl-l-cysteine</b> reduced proliferation and IFNÎ³ in GO, and HA and IL 1 Î² in both GO and control fibroblasts.

40|$|Tyrosine and cyst(e) ine are {{amino acids}} that {{are thought to}} be {{essential}} for preterm neonates. These amino acids have low stability (cyst(e) ine) or low solubility (tyrosine) and are therefore usually present only in small amounts in amino acid solutions. Acetylation improves the stability and solubility of amino acids, facilitating a higher concentration in the solution. We compared three commercially available amino acid solutions, Aminovenös-N-päd 10 %, Vaminolact 6. 5 %, and Primène 10 %, administered to 20 low-birth-weight neonates on total parenteral nutrition from postnatal day 2 onward. Aminovenös-N-päd 10 % contains acetylated tyrosine and acetylated cysteine; the other solutions do not contain acetylated amino acids and differ in the amount of tyrosine and cysteine added. On postnatal day 7, plasma amino acids were measured together with urinary excretion of amino acids and the total nitrogen excretion; 38 % of the intake of N-acetyl-L-tyrosine and 53 % of the intake of <b>N-acetyl-L-cysteine</b> were excreted in urine. Plasma levels of N-acetyl-L-tyrosine (331 +/- 74 mumol/L) and <b>N-acetyl-L-cysteine</b> (18 +/- 29 mumol/L) were higher than those of tyrosine (105 +/- 108 mumol/L) and cystine (11 +/- 9 mumol/L), respectively.

We show a linear correlation of plasma cystine with the intake of cysteine (r =. 75, p = 0. 01), but not with <b>N-acetyl-L-cysteine.</b> The estimated intake of cysteine should be 500 mumol. kg- 1. d- 1 in order to obtain levels comparable with those shown in normal term, breast-fed neonates. Nitrogen retention did not differ among the three groups (247 to 273 mg. kg- 1. d- 1). (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to compare the antioxidant, antiproliferative and apoptosis effects of ethanolic extract of ginger (Zingiber officinale) with its phenolic component (6) -Gingerol on human hepatoma cell line (HepG 2). We found that cytotoxic and antiproliferative effect of ginger extract and (6) -Gingerol could be associated with induction of apoptosis. Both ginger extract and (6) -Gingerol also showed remarkable antioxidant activities in comparison with ascorbic acid and <b>N-acetyl-L-cysteine...</b>|$|E
40|$|High {{doses of}} light can cause {{damage to the}} retina, e. g. during intraocular surgery. Previously, thiols have been {{demonstrated}} to protect against retinal damage in various damage models. Such protection is very promising for clinical practice. Retinal light damage {{can be caused by}} a relatively short exposure to high irradiance levels. These conditions occur during intraocular surgery. In the current study we therefore investigated whether the thiol N-acetylcysteine protects against retinal light damage under high irradiance conditions in the rat retina. Two stereoisomers of this thiol were tested for protection against two spectrally defined types of retinal light damage. Shortly after administration <b>N-acetyl-L-cysteine</b> in doses of 270 - 1000 mg/kg intraperitoneally protected against 380 nm (UVA) light but not against 470 nm (blue) light. Two hours after injection the protection had diminished. We observed no protection by the stereoisomer N-acetyl-D-cysteine. From this study we conclude that <b>N-acetyl-L-cysteine</b> protects stereospecifically against retinal damage in the UV but not in the visible part of the spectrum. This limits the possible application...|$|E
