5|$|During {{the rule}} of Grand Master Perellos, the Order was {{amassing}} great wealth. The Inquisitor Delci desired to garner greater power in Malta and attempted to take hold of the Order's hospital. This hospital was a privileged place and <b>nobody</b> <b>could</b> be admitted prior to presenting their honorary crests, however the inquisition's officers infiltrated the hospital and commenced a formal inspection. These were soon ordered to leave the premises by the commanding knight of Avernes de Bocage, who was the hospital's supervisor. This news reached Grand Master Perellos, who sent his emissary, the Great Prior Marc'Antonio Zondadari, to the Court of Rome to forward complaints about the incident.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, the Inns of Chancery {{was used as}} {{accommodation}} and offices by solicitors, the other branch of the English legal profession. During {{the sixteenth and seventeenth}} centuries the purpose of the Inns changed. After the outbreak of the First English Civil War in 1642, the practice of teaching barristers in the Inns ceased, and as a result the Inns of Chancery became a dedicated association for solicitors instead, offering offices and accommodation. The foundation of the Society of Gentlemen Practisers and Law Society of England and Wales in 1739 and 1825 respectively as professional bodies for the solicitors profession relegated the Inns of Chancery to little more than eccentric dining clubs, and they were gradually dissolved and sold. In 1897 a popular book reported that <b>nobody</b> <b>could</b> remember the purpose of the buildings and that an 1850 investigation had failed to uncover their origins. The last Inn to be sold was Clement's Inn, which was sold in 1903, and demolished in 1934.|$|E

5|$|<b>Nobody</b> <b>could</b> {{call the}} whole nation a criminal, nor the {{individuals}} that have aired their political views. If the right of conquest belongs by right to the conquering country, {{it would be fair}} for Spain to quit resisting the French and submit to them, by the same principles for which it is expected that the Americans submit themselves to the peoples of Pontevedra. The reason and the rule must be equal for everybody. Here there are no conquerors or conquered; here there are only Spaniards. The Spaniards of Spain have lost their land. The Spaniards of America are trying to save theirs. Let the ones from Spain deal with themselves as they can; do not worry, we American Spaniards know what we want and where we go. So I suggest we vote: that we replace the Viceroy with a new authority that will be subject to the parent state if it is saved from the French, and independent if Spain is finally subjugated.|$|E
5|$|The {{death of}} the Senior Queen Samrajya Laxmi allowed the {{emergence}} of the Junior Queen Rajya Laxmi and Crown Prince Surendra onto the political stage. To consolidate her political influence and see her own son, rather than the heir apparent, Surendra, succeed on the throne, Rajya Laxmi had obtained pardon for Sherjung Thapa and other jailed members of Thapa family. It was only after this that Bhimsen Thapa managed to get a symbolic funeral rite in August 1841. Thus, the Nepalese court was split into three factions centered around the King, the Queen, and the Crown Prince. Fateh Jung and his administration supported the King, the Thapas supported the Junior Queen, while the Pandes supported the Crown Prince. The resurgent Thapa coalition succeeded in sowing animosity between Fateh Jung's ministry and the Pande coalition, who were swiftly imprisoned. During his two years in power, Fateh Jung was able to maintain a rule of law in the country; however, after the incarceration of the Pandes, <b>nobody</b> <b>could</b> rein in the worsening sadistic tendencies, sometimes with fatal consequences, of Surendra, who was then still a minor. Under immense pressure from the Queen and the nobility, along with the backing from army and the general populace, the King in January 1843 handed the highest authority of the state to his Junior Queen, Rajya Laxmi, curtailing both his own and his son's power.|$|E

They won, although <b>nobody</b> <b>could</b> deny they had been very lucky: many arbitral errors had helped them achieve their goal.|$|E
25|$|During {{the years}} of Transvaal self-government, <b>nobody</b> <b>could</b> avoid the {{predominant}} political debate of the day: South African unification. Ever since the British victory in the war, it was an inevitability, but it remained up to the South Africans to decide what sort of country would be formed, and {{how it would be}} formed. Smuts favoured a unitary state, with power centralised in Pretoria, with English as the only official language, and with a more inclusive electorate. To impress upon his compatriots his vision, he called a constitutional convention in Durban, in October 1908.|$|E
25|$|It is {{probably}} {{fair to say}} that <b>nobody</b> <b>could</b> have completely filled Wingate's shoes. Wingate had sustained his force outside normal army command through political connections that no successor would have available. The other dilemma of any successor was that they would constantly be second-guessed by those who thought they knew exactly what Wingate would have done in a particular situation. The same officers who would go to extraordinary lengths to justify even the most flawed decisions by Wingate, would attack any successor, whenever the opportunity presented itself.|$|E

López Obrador's followers took both Houses of the Congress and had them chained so <b>nobody</b> <b>could</b> enter, thus avoiding the approval of secondary laws which modified the legal framework of the Mexican national oil company, Pemex. Chairs and tables were used as barricades. López Obrador requested a 4-month long debate on energy policies and not a 50-day debate presented by the PAN, PRI, Green Party and New Alliance.|$|E
25|$|When Hera {{discovered}} that Leto {{was pregnant and}} that Zeus was the father, she convinced the nature spirits to prevent Leto from giving birth on terra-firma, the mainland, or any island at sea. Poseidon gave pity to Leto and guided her to the floating island of Delos, which was neither mainland nor a real island where Leto {{was able to give}} birth to her children. As a gesture of gratitude, Delos was secured with four pillars. The island later became sacred to Apollo. Alternatively, Hera kidnapped Eileithyia, the goddess of childbirth, to prevent Leto from going into labor. The other gods bribed Hera with a beautiful necklace <b>nobody</b> <b>could</b> resist and she finally gave in.|$|E
25|$|Red Alert {{was one of}} the Autobots who {{originally}} came to Earth with Optimus Prime. His character was serious and extremely quiet. Almost nothing and <b>nobody</b> <b>could</b> make him to lose patience excepting Hot Shot who Red Alert often vainly asked to help him in his never-ending 'housekeeping' job on the Autobots' base. He was a brave and experienced warrior during the Cybertronian war, so that Optimus Prime himself gave him his due. But when on Earth, Red Alert hadn't many chances to show his fighting skill because his principal duty turned out to stay on the A-Base and {{to keep an eye on}} the kids (Rad, Carlos and Alexis) while the other 'Bots sought the Mini-Cons or fought the Decepticons. He acted mainly as the Autobots' chief supply manager, engineer and doctor, and was primarily responsible for rebuilding Smokescreen into Hoist, when the latter's body was nearly melted away after Megatron had fired the Requiem Blaster at him.|$|E

25|$|Despite the flair of Stange's reign, {{it would}} take the more {{tactical}} approach of Mich d'Avray to finally win the NSL Championship. While less flamboyant than his predecessor, d'Avray successfully transformed the team with a different strategy to the previous coaches. The attacking 5–3–2, which saw almost as many goals conceded as scored, was replaced with a 4–4–2. Some may argue that the team began to play a less attractive form of the game, but <b>nobody</b> <b>could</b> argue with the results. In 2001/2, the team nearly went the entire season undefeated with a side that only had former Adelaide City midfielder Brad Hassell as a major addition. After scraping through in the second leg of the major semi final against Newcastle, Glory faced Sydney Olympic in the grand final at a sold-out Subiaco Oval. While the 2000 Final {{was one of the great}} games of domestic Australian association football, the 2002 final was a tight and tense affair with Glory hardly getting a shot on target due to the fact that they lacked any bite in the midfield and had their two strikers marked out of the game. Ante Miličić was on target for Olympic though and his goal early in the second half was enough for Olympic to win 1–0 and break the hearts of Glory fans once again. It was also to be former Socceroo Alistair Edwards final match before retirement.|$|E
25|$|Marianne Vos {{signaled}} {{her presence}} {{right after the}} start, as she attacked during the first kilometer but was caught soon after. The pace was high from the beginning, and the first climb saw some riders struggling already. In front of the peloton, the Polish and Lithuanian riders were setting the pace, as well as Rebecca Much from the United States who was present in front during the whole race. The first lap was completed after {{a bit more than}} 26 minutes, with the peloton still together. Climbing the Torricelle for the second time, the race got a little more nervous with some attacks, but the leading riders from Italy, Germany and East-European countries controlled the pace. Another rider in front was Amanda Spratt from Australia, who closed the gap to a Polish rider's attack. The field slowly diminished in number, as some struggled to keep up and the first riders abandoned. After passing the finish line for the second time, {{at the foot of the}} Torricelle climb, Spratt crashed inside the bunch, but got up quickly again, made it back to the front and even attacked soon after that. The Italian riders were paying attention and pulled her back. Instead, Francesca Andina and Savrina Bernardi escaped, but were caught by the leading bunch under control of the Ukrainian riders. Spratt was relentless in her efforts, but could not create a gap on her own. With two laps to go the Italian Savrina Bernardi set the pace in the climb and the only riders able to follow were Spratt and Ekaterina Tretiakova from Russia, until a chase group of about 15 joined them on the descent. For the final lap, another group of 15 joined them making a field of about 30 riders, half of the peloton, that rode the decisive phase of the race. The Italian and Dutch teams attacked each other on the last climb, but no break attempt was as powerful as the one by Vos. She took off and <b>nobody</b> <b>could</b> follow. Increasing her lead rapidly, it was about 20 seconds on top of the Torricelle climb, and the chase group down the descent had three other Dutch riders in it, not helping it much. Rebecca Much from the United States was leading the group on her own, and during the last kilometres it became apparent that Vos would take her solo to the finish. The other Dutch riders therefore did not hold back any more and managed to place a second rider on the podium, Ellen van Dijk, who crossed the line right after Marta Bastianelli from Italy.|$|E
