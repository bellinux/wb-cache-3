During this process, a fine crushed material is heated at extremely high temperatures. The crushed material is then melted which drips through a furnace onto a boule. This boule where the corundum cools down and crystallizes, spins and thus causes the curved striations. <b>Natural</b> <b>corundum</b> does not form this way and lacks the curved striations.|$|E

Artificially heated corundums have the same oxygen isotopic composition as unheated material. The 18 O/ 16 O ratio of <b>natural</b> <b>corundum</b> is a good indicator of its geological environment of formation. The consistently restricted ? 18 O range found {{for each type of}} deposit is explained by host-rock buffering during fluid-rock interaction. The ? 18 O constrains the geological source of the major type of gem-quality rubies sold on the market and brings new insight to gems found in placers. High-quality blue sapphires from Kashmir, Andranondambo, and Sri Lanka have specific oxygen isotopic ranges, but they overlap those of Mogok in Myanmar. Combined with traditional gemology techniques, oxygen isotope analysis will contribute toward defining the origin of some commercial high-value blue sapphires, especially from Kashmir...|$|E

A red-colored artificial ruby {{may also be}} achieved by doping chromium(III) into artificial corundum crystals, thus making chromium a requirement for making synthetic rubies. Such a synthetic ruby crystal {{was the basis for}} the first laser, produced in 1960, which relied on stimulated emission of light from the chromium atoms in such a crystal.|$|R
2500|$|Aluminium oxide can {{be grown}} as a coating on {{aluminium}} by anodizing or by plasma electrolytic oxidation (see the [...] "Properties" [...] above). Both the hardness and abrasion-resistant characteristics of the coating originate from the high strength of aluminium oxide, yet the porous coating layer produced with conventional direct current anodizing procedures is within a 60-70 Rockwell hardness C range [...] which is comparable only to hardened carbon steel alloys, but considerably inferior to the hardness of <b>natural</b> and synthetic <b>corundum.</b> Instead, with plasma electrolytic oxidation, the coating is porous only on the surface oxide layer while the lower oxide layers are much more compact than with standard DC anodizing procedures and present a higher crystallinity due to the oxide layers being remelted and densified to obtain α-Al2O3 clusters with much higher coating hardness values circa 2000 Vickers hardness.|$|R
40|$|<b>Natural</b> <b>corundum</b> is {{colored by}} a variety of trace-element {{impurities}} and by the chemical reactions among them. Important to nearly all of the colors is the role played by the reactions among silicon, titanium, and magnesium. Characterization of the interactions between these aliovalent ions has been hindered {{by the fact that the}} laser ablation–inductively coupled quadrupole–mass spectrometry equipment used in most gem labs does not resolve the interferences for silicon. Thus Si has not been measured at relevant concentrations. Recent development of ion implant standards and the application of secondary ion mass spectrometry has allowed the accurate measurement of silicon in corundum for the first time. As an example of its importance, detailed analyses of sapphire from Montana’s Yogo Gulch deposit are presented. These analyses show that without silicon, Yogo sapphire would not be blue...|$|E
40|$|Although {{changes of}} {{cohesive}} behaviour of powders is observed at high temperature in several industrial process units, conventional testers and procedures {{are still not}} suited for testing powder flow properties at high temperature. In this work a High Temperature Annular Shear Cell was designed, built and set-up in order to directly measure the flow properties of powders up to 500 °C. A temperature control system was also developed to establish a uniform temperature inside the powder sample. Yield loci at room temperature and 500 °C were measured for samples of fluid catalytic cracking catalyst (FCC powder), fly ashes, <b>natural</b> <b>corundum,</b> synthetic porous alumina and glass beads. Experimental evidences did not reveal a univocal effect of temperature in the tested range. Finally, shear tests on glass beads mixed to with some high-density polyethylene (HDPE) (1 % of the total weight) confirmed that a significant increase of the cohesive behaviour occurs at high temperature when liquid bridges form due to the melting {{of one of the}} solid phases...|$|E

A survey of the literature of grinding and surface texture shows the influence of dressing and wear on surfaces {{involved in the process}} and the advantages of stylus profilometry for data collection from both grinding wheels and ground surfaces. Statistical analysis is favoured for surface profile characterization and, of the various parameters used, power spectral density alone offers some prospect of effective comparison between these surfaces. Work on grinding with single crystals of <b>natural</b> <b>corundum</b> was eventually discontinued in favour of experiments with conventional bonded grinding wheels subjected to a dressing operation and some wear in grinding steel surfaces. Statistical parameters representing the surfaces are computed using data obtained from profilograms. Results in terms of power spectral density are presented showing progressive improvement following upon developments in apparatus and methods which facilitated the use of larger surface profile samples. Transfer functions are used to relate power spectra representing corresponding pairs of surfaces. The significance of power spectral density applied to surface profile characterization is discussed and, in this context, it is suggested that these should be described as variance spectra. Attention is drawn to certain disadvantages of variance spectra applied to grinding wheel and ground surface profiles. Methods designed to improve presentation of variance spectra lead to development of a proposed new and more suitable spectrum in which density of standard deviation of surface profile ordinates with respect to frequency is plotted against frequency. Transfer functions calculated from related pairs of these standard deviation spectra show a strong linear correlation with frequency and offer prospects of convenient comparison between the profiles of the various surfaces involved in grinding...|$|E
40|$|In gem testing routine, one of {{the main}} {{requirements}} is to obtain the maximum amount of information without sample preparation. Even the classical gemological methods allow usually identifying the mineralogical identity of a gem, the possibility to inspect aspects as provenance of natural gemstone, and invasive and blind treatments often require the application of more sophisticated methods able to give back quantitative information [1]. Moreover, due to the development of more and more refined synthesis method, the discrimination between natural and synthetic gems is not trivial. Among gemstone analysis techniques, Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS) is increasingly worth considering; the method, already tested for example in origin determination of emeralds [2] or detection of Be-diffusion treatment in corundum [3], provides rapid results on trace-element contents, the latter considered a fingerprint of a gem. Moreover, determining a minimal damaging (an ablation area of just few micrometers), it can be extensively used on both cut and raw gemstones. In this prospective, the present paper intends to contribute the researches in gems analytics providing the results of LIBS measurements on a meaningful sampling of natural (both cut and raw specimens) and synthetic rubies and sapphires, highlighting the potential of the method in helping gemological laboratories for the fast, easy, micro-destructive and reliable discrimination between <b>natural</b> and synthetic <b>corundum,</b> as well as provenance determination...|$|R
40|$|Heavyweight {{concretes}} are {{an attractive}} alternative when heavyweight elements need to fill reduced spaces, because they present high densities {{and are able}} to take different forms according to the container where they are casted. The intended application for the heavyweight concrete referred to in this work is a power converter, which is a floating system that generates power through the waves of the sea. The design of this converter considers the use of elements of high mass at both ends of a metallic oval structure. Therefore, a heavyweight concrete with density of 4, 000 and 4, 500 kg/m 3 was developed. For heavyweight concrete production with densities as high as the ones needed, it is necessary to use artificial aggregates of steel grit or <b>corundum.</b> <b>Natural</b> heavyweight aggregates such as hematite, magnetite or barite allow achieving maximum densities around 3, 800 kg/m 3, being unsuitable for the required application. For this reason, grit coarse aggregate 6 - 8 mm was used and a portion of the sand was replaced by a corundum fine aggregate 0. 5 - 1. 5 mm, being these materials out of the standard applications. In addition to the density requirements, consistency of the fresh concrete is also important as the use of heavyweight aggregates, whose density differs from the density of the mortar or paste, may lead to segregation of the mix. Due to the particularities of the concrete, the mix-design process was oriented to the specific application and quantitative and qualitative requirements were evaluated such as concepts related to the availability of the component materials, accessibility to the production area and casting. Therefore, the aim of this work is to present the considerations made during the mix-design process as well as the characterization of the heavyweight concretes produced, which showed results in agreement with the pre-established requirements.

40|$|Trace-element {{chemistry}} and microscopic observations of included gem corundum (α-AlO) suggests {{a new model}} of syngenetic growth of oriented rutile inclusions rather than the usual interpretation of their growth through exsolution. Laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) is now a robust method for measuring trace elements in gem-quality corundum (ruby and sapphire). Nonetheless, the corundum structure is relatively unforgiving for substitutional components and typically only a small handful of minor to trace elements are measured by LA-ICP-MS (Mg, Ti, V, Cr, Fe, Ga). Less commonly, trace elements such as Be, Zr, Nb, Sn, La, Ce, Ta, and W are found in <b>natural</b> <b>corundum.</b> Their concentrations are typically correlated with high contents of Ti and silky or cloudy zones in the corundum that contain a high concentration of needle-like rutile or other oxide inclusions. Three metamorphic-type sapphires from Sri Lanka, Madagascar, and Tanzania were studied here using LA-ICP-MS, electronprobe microanalysis (EPMA), and nanoSIMS to document correlations between the various trace elements and their distribution between the corundum and included, oriented rutile TiO needles. NanoSIMS and EPMA measurements show concentration of Be, Mg, Fe, V, Zr, Nb, Ce, Ta, and W in the rutile needles. The relative atomic concentrations of Mg and Ti from LA-ICP-MS measurements suggest the corundum-rutile intergrowth grew as a mechanical mixture of the two phases as opposed to rutile formation through exsolution from the corundum host. This scenario is also suggested for the three magmatic-type sapphires studied here based on the presence of glassy melt inclusions in close association with included, oriented oxide needles. The preservation of a glassy melt inclusion requires fast cooling, whereas exsolution of the oxide inclusions would require slow cooling and annealing at a temperature lower than sapphire formation. The studied sapphires suggest the likely origin of the oriented, needle-like rutile inclusions to be syngenetic epitaxial coprecipitation of both rutile and corundum. The interpretation of such oriented oxide inclusions has important implications for understanding the geological formation conditions based on trace element data or using such data to separate sapphires and rubies based on their geographic origin...|$|E
40|$|Abstract  Differentiation of {{treated and}} {{non-treated}} gemstones is a chief concern for major jewellery import companies. Low-quality corundum specimens coming from Asia {{appear to be}} often treated with heat, BeO or flux {{in order to enhance}} their properties as precious minerals. A set of corundum samples, rubies and sapphires from different origins, both treated and non-treated has been analysed at the Centre Européen d’Archéométrie, with ion-beam-induced luminescence (IBIL) and other complementary techniques such as Raman, proton-induced X-ray emission (PIXE), and proton-induced gamma-ray emission (PIGE). IBIL, also known as ionoluminescence, has been used before to detect impurities or defects inside synthetic materials and natural minerals; its use for the discrimination of gemstone simulants or synthetic analogues has been elsewhere discussed (Cavenago-Bignami Moneta, Gemología, Tomo I Piedras preciosas, perlas, corales, marfil. Ediciones Omega, Barcelona, 1991). PIXE has been frequently applied in the archaeometric field for material characterisation and provenance studies of minerals (Hughes, Ruby & sapphire. RWH Publishing, Fallbrook, 1997; Calvo del Castillo et al., Anal Bioanal Chem 387 : 869 – 878, 2007; Calligaro et al., NIM-B 189 : 320 – 327, 2002) and PIGE complements the elemental analysis by detecting light elements in these materials such as—and lighter than—sodium that cannot be identified with the PIXE technique (Sanchez et al., NIM-B 130 : 682 – 686, 1997; Emmett et al., Gems Gemology 39 : 84 – 135, 2003). The micro-Raman technique has also been used complementarily to ion beam analysis techniques for mineral characterisation (Novak et al., Appl Surf Sci 231 – 232 : 917 – 920, 2004). The aim {{of this study is to}} provide new means for systematic analysis of corundum gemstone-quality mineral, alternative to the traditional gemmologic methods; for this purpose, a Spanish jewellery import company supplied us with a number of <b>natural</b> <b>corundum</b> samples coming from different places (part of them treated as explained above). The PIXE elemental concentrations of the samples showed large quantities of calcium and lead in some cases that can be linked to treatment with fluxes or lead oxide. The plot of the chromium and iron concentration grouped the samples in various aggregates that corresponded to the different types of corundum analysed. Micro-Raman complemented the PIXE analysis corroborating the presence of lead oxides but the use of the PIGE technique was not successful for the detection of beryllium due to the low cross section of the nuclear reaction chosen for its identification. IBIL was capable of distinguishing between treated and non-treated samples of the same type based on the luminescent features of the materials. Peer reviewe...|$|E
