5|$|The social {{contract}} theory of political philosopher John Rawls, developed {{in his work}} A Theory of Justice, was influenced by Kant's ethics. Rawls argued that a just society would be fair. To achieve this fairness, he proposed a hypothetical moment prior {{to the existence of}} a society, at which the society is ordered: this is the original position. This should take place from behind a veil of ignorance, where <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> their own position in society will be, preventing people from being biased by their own interests and ensuring a fair result. Rawls' theory of justice rests on the belief that individuals are free, equal, and moral; he regarded all human beings as possessing some degree of reasonableness and rationality, which he saw as the constituents of morality and entitling their possessors to equal justice. Rawls dismissed much of Kant's dualism, arguing that the structure of Kantian ethics, once reformulated, is clearer without it—he described this as {{one of the goals of}} A Theory of Justice.|$|E

She had Peter arrested and forced him to sign an act of abdication. When he sought permission to leave the country, she refused it, intending to hold him prisoner for life. He had only a few days to live, however, as shortly after his arrest, he was strangled to death by Catherine's supporters, though <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> part Catherine had in Peter's death.|$|E

25|$|The {{largest and}} most {{important}} site is El Tajín, located {{near the city of}} Papantla.

It is also unknown if the Totonac built it, but since they have dominated the region for centuries, they lay claim to it.The city developed {{from the end of the}} Classic period and the beginning of the Post Classic period, between 800 and 1150 C.E. It is divided into five zones, the Plaza del Arroyo Group, the Central Zone, the Gran Xicalcoliuhqui, Tajín Chico and the Column Complex. Its signature building is the Pyramid of the Niches, named after the 365 niches built into the levels of the structure. The site has a large number of Mesoamerican ball game courts, one with details reliefs showing the beheading of a ballplayer and his role in the afterlife.|$|E

500|$|Although {{most modern}} comics are told {{in three to}} six issue [...] "arcs" [...] that form a nearly {{complete}} story, Seeley feels that when several plot points climax at once, it provides readers an easy opportunity to quit reading without feeling dissatisfied about missing the true conclusion. For Revival, he and Norton decided to have new mysteries develop constantly. They had several discussions on the right point to begin the story. Early drafts of the first issue included scenes showing the worldwide response to Revival Day, but they were cut {{to focus on the}} people of Wausau. The creators decided to start the story after [...] "Revival Day" [...] partly because they wanted readers to relate to the cast's confusion, and partly as an homage to old superhero comics that told origin stories as quickly as possible to get to the action. They were inspired by Don DeLillo's novel White Noise, which follows people trying to escape an approaching cloud but <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> it actually is.|$|E

500|$|The title track, {{which was}} not {{featured}} on the original LP, was recorded after the album's release {{at the suggestion of}} Peggy Harris, the artist who designed the Winter collage for the inner sleeve of the LP. Initially, Scott-Heron and Jackson meant for Winter in America to lack a title track, which contrasted their previous label's trend of having their work include title tracks. The album title's purpose meant only to describe the general theme of Winter in Americas songs. According to Scott-Heron, a title track [...] "separates {{from the rest of the}} lyrics, better, or worse or different." [...] The studio version of [...] "Winter in America" [...] was released on his following album, The First Minute of a New Day (1975), while a live version, recorded in 1982 at Washington, D.C.'s Black Wax Club, was included on the 1998 CD reissue of Winter in America. The song features Scott-Heron's poetic references and lyrics that portray America in a dystopian state where [...] "democracy is rag-time on the corner", [...] "the forest is buried beneath the highway", [...] "robins are perched in barren treetops", and, in conclusion, [...] "no one is fighting because <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> to say." ...|$|E

[...] Alter argued that the yellow or orange coloring would be {{in keeping with the}} brilliantly dyed stuff in [...] Professor Richard Elliott Friedman of the University of Georgia wrote that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> the term means, noting that it has been translated to be dolphin skins, badger skins, goatskins, and skins of a particular color. Friedman wrote that it is a cognate of an Arabic word for dolphin, but, since it does not occur in the list of animals that are forbidden or permitted for food in [...] it may not refer to a particular species of animal at all. Friedman concluded that it may just mean tanned skins or leather.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{following}} weeks, Murphy became enveloped with the incident {{and wrote a}} radio documentary called Object in the Woods, featuring his experiences and interviews he had conducted that night. Shortly before the documentary would have aired, he received an unexpected visit at the station from two men in black suits identifying themselves as government officials. They requested {{to speak with him}} in a back room behind closed doors. The meeting lasted about 30 minutes. A WHJB employee, Linda Foschia, recalled the men confiscated some of Murphy's audio tapes from that night, and that <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> happened to the remaining photographs. A week after the visit, an agitated Murphy aired a censored version of the documentary, which he claimed in its introduction had to be edited due to some interviewees requesting their statements be removed from the broadcast in fear of getting in trouble with the police and Army. The new version contained nothing revealing, and did not mention an object at all. Mazza, and also Murphy's wife, remember the aired documentary was entirely different from what Murphy had originally written.

2500|$|Cable {{communications}} to Alaska {{had been}} lost on 21 October 1918, and {{partly as a result}} this, the wireless operators were having to contend with a rush of messages, which made it difficult to transmit essential messages relating to the grounding of Sophia. [...] Efforts to clear non-essential traffic were frustrated by the international character of the disaster. [...] Word of the grounding only reached Cedar eleven hours after the grounding. [...] Whether this was because Cedar was out of range or because wireless channels were jammed with non-essential traffic is not clear. [...] The delay was unfortunate, as Cedar was the largest all-weather ship in the area, which could readily have taken on all of Sophias passengers and crew. [...] <b>No</b> <b>one</b> <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> Cedar {{might have been able to}} do had she been alerted earlier. [...] The delay could have been significant, as the late notice to him was still well recalled 45 years later by Captain Ledbetter. [...] Of all the rescue ships, only Cedar had wireless, and her not being on the scene earlier deprived the rescue effort of this resource, if no other.|$|E

He also said that he probably is not a veteran because if the man had served in the armed forces for even a year, the maniacal tendencies would be apparent. He {{said that the}} murderer was not necessarily a resident of the area, despite his knowledge of the area. He said that all of the attacks show evidence of cool and cunning planning and that the killer could be from another community and had acquainted himself with the area. He said that the strengthening of the police force would not scare him away but that he would willingly leave due to the difficulty of committing a crime. [...] "This man is extremely dangerous. He works alone and <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> he is doing because he tells no one," [...] Lapalla said, adding that the killer may have reasoned in past crimes {{that the only way to}} remain unidentified is to kill all persons at the scene.

2500|$|The {{impossibility of}} {{answering}} truly {{the question whether}} the 100th (or 10,000th) decimal {{in the evaluation of}} Pi is or is not a 9, splendidly illustrates how impossible it is to predicate truth in abstraction from actual knowing and actual purpose. For the question cannot be answered until the decimal is calculated. Until then <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>knows</b> <b>what</b> it is, or rather will turn out to be. And no one will calculate it, until it serves some purpose to do so, and some one therefore interests himself in the calculation. And so until then the truth remains uncertain: there is no 'true' answer, because there is no actual context in which the question has really been raised. We have merely a number of conflicting possibilities, not even claims to truth, and there is no decision. Yet a decision is possible if an experiment is performed. But his experiment presupposes a desire to know. It will only be made if the point becomes one which it is practically important to decide. Normally no doubt it does not become such, because for the actual purposes of the sciences it makes no difference whether we suppose the figure to be 9 or something else. I.e. the truth to, say, the 99th decimal, is ' true enough ' for our purposes, and the 100th is a matter of indifference. But let that indifference cease, and the question become important, and the ' truth ' will at once become ' useful '. Prof. Taylor's illustration therefore conclusively proves that in an actual context and as an actual question there is no true answer to be got until the truth has become useful. This point is illustrated also by the context Prof. Taylor has himself suggested. For he has made the question about the 100th decimal important by making the refutation of the whole pragmatist theory of knowledge depend on it. And what nobler use could the 100th decimal have in his eyes? If in consequence of this interest he will set himself to work it out, he will discover this once useless, but now most useful, truth, and—triumphantly refute his own contention! ...|$|E
