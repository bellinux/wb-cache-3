40|$|Abstract: A radiocarbon-dated {{sediment}} sequence from Lake Berkut in {{the southern}} part of the Kola Peninsula, northwest Russia, was investigated by means of midge analysis in order to reconstruct the Holocene climatic and environmental history of the region. Past mean July air temperatures at the study site and hypolimnetic oxygen contents of the lake water were inferred from chironomid-based transfer functions. The early Holocene (c. 10 100 / 8400 cal. yr BP) is characterized by summer temperatures and hypolimnetic oxygen concentrations broadly similar to present-day conditions. The midge records give evidence of a lake-level fall at c. 7000 cal. yr BP, resulting in weakened thermal stratification of the lake water, and improvement of the hypolimnetic oxygen conditions. After c. 4000 cal. yr BP midge assemblages suggest a lake-level rise related to increased effective moisture. A secondary mid-Holocene climatic optimum with inferred mean July air temperatures of c. 12. 18 C was recorded between 6000 and 4400 cal. yr BP, followed by minimum values (c. 11. 38 C) between 3500 and 1500 cal. yr BP, accompanied by the onset of <b>natural</b> <b>acidification</b> of the lake. The late-Holocene midge assemblages suggest weakly acidic conditions, low hypolimnetic oxygen contents and a general warming trend during the last c. 1500 years, although paludification and <b>natural</b> <b>acidification</b> may have influenced the temperature reconstruction at this stage.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose is}} to examine more closely why the {{achievement}} of the environmental goals is so low. To within the thesis work to make this as interesting and with as good quality as possible, especially the environmental quality goal Reduced climate impact, but also <b>Natural</b> <b>acidification</b> and Protective ozone layer, has been chosen to be studied further.   Method: A qualitative method and text analysis has been applied. Intervention theory, as Vedung 2009 describes, is used as an intellectual backbone and as a help to structure the essay. The three environmental quality goals correspond cases, or units of analysis.   Analysis: The fulfillment of the respective environmental quality goals is analyzed according to its goal, policy instruments, implementation and its effects. To this some of the problems are analyzed that exist on the path to achieve the goals. This is done by using the theory of policy instruments, goals, ethics and Rothstein's theory of policy formulation and execution of public policy.   Conclusions: Compliance with environmental quality objectives is dependent on international regulations and agreements that are currently not available. Therefore it is important to push for stronger international cooperation so that new agreements are realized. However, it is possible to influence the goals like <b>Natural</b> <b>acidification</b> nationally through stronger incentives. One problem is the goal conflicts that occur. Many difficult ethical choices and considerations are needed.

40|$|Anthropogenic {{carbon dioxide}} {{emissions}} are acidifying the oceans, reducing the concentration of carbonate ions ([CO 32 -) that calcifying organisms need to build and cement coral reefs.

40|$|The cation {{exchange}} capacity (CEC) of a soil {{is a measure of}} the quantity of negatively charged sites on soil surfaces that can retain positively charged ions (cations) such as calcium (Ca 2 +), magnesium (Mg 2 +), and potassium (K +), by electrostatic forces. Cations retained electrostatically are easily exchangeable with cations in the soil solution so a soil with a higher CEC has a greater capacity to maintain adequate quantities of Ca 2 +, Mg 2 + and K + than a soil with a low CEC. A soil with a higher CEC may not necessarily be more fertile because a soil’s CEC can also be occupied by acid cations such as hydrogen (H +) and aluminum (Al 3 +). However, when combined with other measures of soil fertility, CEC is a good indicator of soil quality and productivity. Cation exchange sites are found primarily on clay minerals and organic matter (OM) surfaces. Soil OM will develop a greater CEC at near-neutral pH than under acidic conditions (pH-dependent CEC). Thus, addition of an organic material will likely increase a soil's CEC over time. On the other hand, a soil’s CEC can decrease with time as well, through e. g. <b>natural</b> or fertilizer-induced <b>acidification</b> and/or OM decomposition. Soil CEC is normally expressed in one of two numerically equivalent sets of units...|$|R

40|$|Goals and {{performance}} targets {{are commonly used}} as tools in the policy-implementation process. In Sweden, environmental policy is operationalized through a system of environmental quality objectives that were adopted by the Swedish Riksdag in the late 1990 s. The objectives describe what level of environmental quality Sweden should aim for within a generation, and are designed to guide decision making in all sectors of society. However, to guide decision making toward improved environmental quality, these objectives should satisfy a set of rationality (functionality) criteria; they should be precise, evaluable, approachable, motivating and coherent. In this paper, five Swedish environmental quality objectives are investigated through an application of the suggested criteria: (1) a balanced marine environment, flourishing coastal areas and archipelagos; (2) a magnificent mountain landscape; (3) a non-toxic environment; (4) <b>natural</b> <b>acidification</b> only; and (5) a good built environment. The aim of the paper is to bring the rationality of the objectives up for discussion, and to illustrate the range of issues and difficulties {{that are involved in}} choosing and assessing environmental policy goals. ...|$|E

40|$|With the {{aggravation}} of {{acid rain}} pollution and the enlarging of the acid rain regions in China, the sensitivity evaluation of <b>natural</b> waters to <b>acidification</b> on a regional scale become increasingly important. Acidification models based on a single indicator cannot give much information on aquatic acidification because of their simplicity; yet acidification models based on physical, chemical, hydrological and/or biological processes are not suitable for large scale regional research because of their exceptional complexity. In this paper, a multi-indicator comprehensive model for aquatic acidification sensitivity is proposed and applied. This model comprises {{some of the most}} important factors that are considered to influence water acidification, in particular: acid neutralization capacity, acidification capacity, acidification sensitive index, cation exchange capacity of soil, pH of soil, and weathering shuck types of soil-forming. It highlights the key stages of aquatic acidification by acid neutralization capacity, acidification capacity, and acidification sensitivity index. The model thereby estimates the <b>acidification</b> sensitivity of <b>natural</b> waters by using these indicators according to a weighting system. Equal-weight and non-equal-weight approaches are separately used to combine the six indicators into an overall sensitivity index of aquatic acidification.

40|$|Stands of {{pedunculate oak}} (Quercus robur) planted 50 - 80 {{years ago on}} two types of land (previously forested land and former arable fields) were {{compared}} regarding vegetation and soil. Former arable soils were characterized by a higher pH, higher nitrate concentration and higher soil density, but had lower organic matter content and lower ammonium concentration in the topsoil (0 - 5 cm). These differences, however, decreased with soil depth. Phosphorus concentration was consistently higher in former fields throughout the soil profile (0 - 45 cm). Nitrogen mineralization, determined by in situ incubation, showed a strong seasonal pattern with peak values in spring. Non-metric multidimensional scaling ordination revealed marked compositional differences in the vegetation between the two land-use categories, and also compositional turnover along gradients in soil pH and nitrogen availability. Differences in soil pH between land-use categories occurred in a range critical {{for the establishment of}} many typical forest herb layer species. Plant indicator species were identified for the two land-use categories. The results showed that acid-sensitive forest herbs may benefit from the higher pH soils in new woodlands, in contrast to ancient forest soils with little buffer capacity towards <b>natural</b> and anthropogenic <b>acidification.</b> In conclusion, former arable use has long-lasting effects on soil properties and vegetation composition in broadleaved forests.

40|$|Ocean {{acidification}} {{threatens the}} survival of coral reef ecosystems worldwide. The negative effects of ocean acidification observed in many laboratory experiments have been seen in studies of naturally low-pH reefs, with little evidence to date for adaptation. Recently, we reported initial data suggesting that low-pH coral communities of the Palau Rock Islands appear healthy despite the extreme conditions in which they live. Here, we build on that observation with a comprehensive statistical analysis of benthic communities across Palau's <b>natural</b> <b>acidification</b> gradient. Our analysis revealed a shift in coral community composition but no impact of acidification on coral richness, coralline algae abundance, macroalgae cover, coral calcification, or skeletal density. However, coral bioerosion increased 11 -fold as pH decreased from the barrier reefs to the Rock Island bays. Indeed, {{a comparison of the}} naturally low-pH coral reef systems studied so far revealed increased bioerosion to be the only consistent feature among them, as responses varied across other indices of ecosystem health. Our results imply that whereas community responses may vary, escalation of coral reef bioerosion and acceleration of a shift from net accreting to net eroding reef structures will likely be a global signature of ocean acidification...|$|E

We have shown previously that citP {{is included in}} the citQRP operon, which is mainly transcribed from the P 1 promoter in L. lactis subsp. lactis biovar diacetylactis. Furthermore, transcription of citQRP and citrate transport are not induced by the presence of citrate in the growth medium. In this work, we analyzed the influence of the extracellular pH on the expression of citP. The citrate transport system is induced by <b>natural</b> <b>acidification</b> of the medium during cell growth and by a shift to media buffered at acidic pHs. This inducible response to acid stress takes place at the transcriptional level and seems to be due to increased utilization of the P 1 promoter. Increased transcription correlates with increased synthesis of CitP and results in higher citrate transport activity catalyzed by the cells. Finally, this acid stress response seems to provide L. lactis subsp. lactis biovar diacetylactis with a selective advantage resulting from cometabolism of glucose and citrate at low pHs...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of the thesis was to explore the potential of diatoms (Bacillariophyceae) as indicators of Holocene climate and environmental change in northern Sweden (Abisko region, 68 ° 21 'N, 18 ° 49 'E). A modern surface-sediment calibration set including 100 lakes was developed and lake-water pH, sedimentary organic content (assessed by loss-on-ignition) and temperature were identified as most powerful environmental variables explaining the variance within the diatom assemblages. Transfer functions based on unimodal species response models (WA-PLS) were developed for lake-water pH and mean July air temperature (July T), yielding coefficients of determination of 0. 77 and 0. 70, and prediction errors based on leave-one-out cross-validation of 0. 19 pH units and 0. 96 °C for lake-water pH and July T, respectively. The transfer functions were validated with monitoring data covering two open-water seasons (lake-water pH) and meteorological records covering the 20 th century (July T). The good agreement between diatom-based inferences and measured monitoring data confirmed the prediction ability of the developed transfer functions. Analysing a Holocene sediment core from a lake nearby Abisko (Vuoskkujávri), diatoms infer a linearly decreasing July T trend (1. 5 °C) since 6, 000 cal. BP, which compares well with inferences based on chironomids and pollen from the same sediment core. The lake-water pH inference shows a pattern of moderate <b>natural</b> <b>acidification</b> (c. 0. 5 pH units) since the early Holocene, reaching present-day pH values at c. 5, 000 cal. BP. By fitting fossil diatom samples to the modern calibration set by means of residual distance assessment within canonical correspondence analysis (CCA), the early Holocene (between 10, 600 and 6, 000 cal. BP) {{was identified as a}} problematic time-period for diatom-based inferences and, consequently, reconstructions during this period are tentative. Pollen-based inferences also show 'poor' fit between 10, 600 and 7, 500 cal. BP and chironomids probably provide the most reliable July T reconstruction at Vuoskkujávri, with 'poor' fit only during the initial part of the Holocene (between 10, 600 and 10, 250 cal. BP). Possible factors confounding diatom-based July T inferences were investigated. Using detrended CCA (DCCA), Holocene sediment sequences from five lakes indicate that during the early Holocene, mainly physical factors such as high minerogenic erosion rates, high temperature and low light availability may have regulated diatom assemblages, favouring Fragilaria species. In all five lakes, diatom assemblages developed in a directional manner, but timing and scale of development differed substantially between lakes. The differences are attributed primarily to the geological properties of the lake catchments (with strong effects on lake-water pH), but other factors such as climatic change, vegetation, hydrologic setting and in-lake processes appear to regulate diatom communities in each lake differently. The influence of long-term <b>natural</b> <b>acidification</b> on diatom assemblages progressively declined during the Holocene with corresponding increase of the influence of climatic factors...|$|E
40|$|Shelf seas {{are among}} the most active {{biogeochemical}} marine environments and the East Siberian Sea is a prime example. This sea is supplied by seawater from both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and has a substantial input of river runoff. All of these waters contribute chemical constituents, dissolved and particulate, but of different signatures. Sea ice formation during the winter season and melting in the summer has a major impact on physical as well as biochemical conditions. The internal circulation and water mass distribution is significantly influenced by the atmospheric pressure field. The western region is dominated by input of river runoff from the Laptev Sea and an extensive input of terrestrial organic matter. The microbial decay of this organic matter produces carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) over-saturating all waters from the surface to the bottom relative to atmospheric values, even if the nutrient concentrations of the surface waters showed recent primary production. The eastern surface waters were under-saturated with respect to CO 2 illustrating the dominance of marine primary production. The drawdown of dissolved inorganic carbon equals a primary production of &sim; 1 mol C m− 2 , which when multiplied by half the area of the East Siberian Sea, 500 000 km 2 , results in an annual primary production of 0. 5 &times; 10 12 mol C or 6 &times; 10 12 gC. Even though microbial decay occurs through much of the water column it dominates at the sediment surface where the majority of organic matter ends up, and most of the decay products are added to the bottom water. High nutrient concentrations and fugacity of CO 2 and low oxygen and pH were observed in the bottom waters. Another signature of organic matter decomposition, methane (CH 4 ), was observed in very high but variable concentrations. This is due to its seabed sources of glacial origin or modern production from ancient organic matter, becoming available due to sub-sea permafrost thaw and formation of so-called taliks (layers of thawed sediments within the permafrost body). Riverine transport as well as leakage of groundwater rich in methane from decay in fresh water systems could add to the CH 4 shelf water inventory as minor sources. The decay of organic matter to CO 2 as well as oxidation of CH 4 to CO 2 contribute to a <b>natural</b> ocean <b>acidification</b> making the saturation state of calcium carbonate low, resulting in under-saturation of all the bottom waters with respect to aragonite and large areas of under-saturation down to 50 % with respect to calcite. Hence, conditions for calcifying organisms are very unfavorable...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Environmental {{stress can}} result in strong {{ecological}} and evolutionary effects on natural populations, but to what extent it drives adaptive divergence of natural populations is little explored. We used common garden experiments to study adaptive divergence in embryonic and larval fitness traits (embryonic survival, larval growth, and age and size at metamorphosis) in eight moor frog, Rana arvalis, populations inhabiting an acidification gradient (breeding pond pH 4. 0 to 7. 5) in southwestern Sweden. Embryos were raised until hatching at three (pH 4. 0, 4. 3 and 7. 5) and larvae until metamorphosis at two (pH 4. 3 and 7. 5) pH treatments. To get insight into the putative selective agents along this environmental gradient, we measured relevant abiotic and biotic environmental variables from each breeding pond, and used linear models to test for phenotype-environment correlations. Results We found that acid origin populations had higher embryonic and larval acid tolerance (survival and larval period were less negatively affected by low pH), higher larval growth but slower larval development rates, and metamorphosed at a larger size. The phenotype-environment correlations revealed that divergence in embryonic acid tolerance and metamorphic size correlated most strongly with breeding pond pH, whereas divergence in larval period and larval growth correlated most strongly with latitude and predator density, respectively. Conclusion Our results suggest that R. arvalis has diverged in response to pH mediated selection along this acidification gradient. However, as latitude and pH were closely spatially correlated in this study, further {{studies are needed to}} disentangle the specific agents of <b>natural</b> selection along <b>acidification</b> gradients. Our study highlights the need to consider the multiple interacting selective forces that drive adaptive divergence of natural populations along environmental stress gradients. </p...|$|R

The impacts are greatest when large amounts of nutrient-rich slurry from livestock production cannot be adequately utilised on adjacent land. To facilitate nutrient redistribution, a range of different technologies are available. This study comprised a life cycle assessment of the environmental impacts from handling 1000 kg of pig slurry ex-animal. Application of untreated pig slurry onto adjacent land was compared with using four different treatment technologies to enable nutrient redistribution before land application: (a) separation by mechanical screw press, (b) screw press separation with composting of the solid fraction, (c) separation by decanter centrifuge, and (d) decanter centrifuge separation with ammonia stripping of the liquid fraction. Emissions were determined based on a combination of values derived from the literature and simulations with the Farm-N model for Danish agricultural and climatic conditions. The environmental impact categories assessed were climate change, freshwater eutrophication, marine eutrophication, terrestrial <b>acidification,</b> <b>natural</b> resource use, and soil carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus storage. In all separation scenarios, the liquid fraction was applied to land on the pig-producing (donor) farm and the solid fraction transported to a recipient farm and utilised for crop production. Separation, especially by centrifuge, was found to result in a lower environmental impact potential than application of untreated slurry to adjacent land. Composting and ammonia stripping either slightly increased or slightly decreased the environmental impact potential, depending on the impact category considered. The relative ranking of scenarios did not change after a sensitivity analysis in which coefficients for field emissions of nitrous oxide, ammonia and phosphorus were varied within the range cited in the literature. Therefore, the best technology to implement in a given situation depends on the environmental problem in question, local policy, cost and practicality...|$|R

This study applied such an analysis to two mountain lakes in the Sudetes Mts. in Poland: Mały Staw (MS) and Wielki Staw (WS). Cores 882 cm long (MS) and 1100 cm long (WS) taken from the centre of each lake in 1982 were used to study the long-term acidification history of these lakes. Changes in vegetation indicate that the initial phase of MS started {{at the end of the}} Pleistocene. WS sediments began to accumulate shortly after that, at the beginning of the Holocene. The majority of the diatom assemblages are typical of oligotrophic acidic lakes located in alpine and arctic regions. A pH reconstruction based on diatoms (DI-pH) showed long-term acidification dating to almost the beginning of the lakes’ existence. <b>Natural</b> <b>acidification</b> began after the deglaciation, and the most intensive acidification continued to the end of the mid-Holocene. Through the whole period studied, pH decreased by 1. 4 in MS and 0. 9 in WS. After a period of relatively stable lake water pH, it decreased rapidly during the last few decades of the 20 th century, due to anthropogenic pollution: pH declined by 0. 7 in MS and 0. 3 in WS. Mały Staw, being shallower, smaller, and with a larger drainage basin than Wielki Staw, is more sensitive to acid deposition; this accounts for the difference in pH...|$|E
40|$|At Angleur (eastern Belgium), a 53, 000 m(3) dump site, {{related to}} former Zn extraction, {{contains}} {{high concentrations of}} heavy metals and arsenic associated with minerals such as arsenopyrite (FeAsS), franklinite (ZnFe 2 O 4) and willemite (Zn 2 SiO 4). Eight representative samples were investigated {{by means of a}} modified availability test, which pointed towards a considerable availability of Cd, Ph and Zn. In addition a detailed analysis of leaching behaviour as a function of pH was performed by means of a pH(stat) leaching test. The results of this test were supported by modelling predictions with MINTEQA 2. pH(stat) titration results also allowed determination of the acid neutralising capacity, making it possible to predict heavy metal release upon acidification, assuming a worst-case scenario. On a short- to medium-long term (+/- 100 years) a release of 900 mg/kg Zn has to be expected upon assumed <b>natural</b> <b>acidification.</b> However, a leaching test performed at the natural pH (i. e. pH 8 for the sample studied) indicates that heavy metal release is very limited and far below the European limit values for slag material on dumps category 1. Therefore, despite the elevated total heavy metal and As concentrations on the site, leaching is relatively low under present environmental conditions. Moreover, the slag material has a rather elevated pH (6. 5 - 8) and no acid mine drainage is produced. Glass phases seem very important in controlling heavy metal mobility since potential reactive minerals that are locked up in a silicate matrix are protected against leaching. (c) 2005 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Anthropogenic {{activities}} are fundamentally altering {{the chemistry of}} the world’s oceans. Many of these modifications could {{have a significant impact}} on the health of marine organisms. Yet, despite being proposed as one of the most significant threats that marine ecosystems face, to date very little is known about the impact of anthropogenic climate change, and ocean acidification in particular, on host defence. The aims of this thesis are to investigate the impact of environmental stressors on the invertebrate immune response, providing empirical data on how anthropogenically induced stressors will impact the invertebrate immune system and how this will impact organism condition and subsequent physiological trade-offs. Exposure to reduced seawater pH and increased temperature significantly reduced the immune response in the blue mussel, Mytilus edulis. This reduction in immune response could indicate stress-induced immune dysfunction. However, the immune system protects an organism from infectious disease, ensuring survival, and should therefore be evaluated functionally rather than immunologically. By subsequently exposing mussels to a bacterial challenge this study demonstrated that an earlier study which measured a reduction in host defence represented a trade-off of immune system maintenance costs, with mussels maintaining a capacity to up-regulate immune defence when required. However, whilst this immune plasticity ensures mussels are able to survive a pathogen exposure, such a strategy appears to be physiologically costly. This cost is seen as a reduction in reproductive investment, an altered energy metabolism and an altered fatty acid composition in organisms exposed to low pH. Therefore the overarching picture that emerges is, without measuring physiological processes functionally, and in neglecting any physiological trade-offs, it is possible that many studies may misinterpret the complex physiological responses of marine organisms to ocean <b>acidification.</b> <b>Natural</b> Environment Research Counci...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} temporal {{perspectives of}} lake acidification in Sweden. Sediment records {{have been used}} to study timing, trends and causes of acidification, and two different techniques for assessing past lake-water acidity are presented. A new technique for pH prediction, based on near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy of surface sediments, is developed. This study shows that there is a pH related fraction of lake sediments that can be recorded by NIR analysis. Relationships between NIR spectra of surface sediment samples and measured lake-water pH values, and between NIR spectra of sediment cores and historical pH values inferred by diatom analysis, are modelled by partial least squares regression. The prediction errors of the models are comparable to those obtained by modelling of diatom and lake-water pH data. By further development NIR spectroscopy can become useful for inferring past pH, as well as several other lake-water parameters, from sediment cores. Diatom-based predictive models, using multivariate calibration methods, are developed for inferences of lake-water pH, alkalinity and colour. These models are used to provide a regional assessment of recent lake acidification in the provinces of Västerbotten and Norrbotten, northern Sweden. The study shows that a pH decline has occurred in some southeastern lakes, but that most of the lakes have not faced significant changes in lake-water pH, alkalinity and colour. The inferred water chemistiy changes are discussed in relation to atmospheric deposition and land-use. In a study of eight acid-sensitive Swedish boreal-forest lakes a past-analogue approach is used to test whether contemporary expansion of conifers could cause lake acidification. Water chemistry changes associated with the natural pre-historic colonization and expansion of spruce in Sweden (≈ 3000 years B. P.), at times of background atmospheric acidity, are inferred to evaluate the acidification ability of spruce per se on surface waters. This study shows that under natural, unpolluted conditions spruce colonization and expansion did not cause lake acidification. In a synthesis of palaeolimnological acidification research in Sweden a general model for pH- development for acid clear-water lakes in southern Sweden is presented. The pH-development from the last deglaciation to present time can be divided into four different periods; (i) a <b>natural</b> long-term <b>acidification</b> period (12000 B. P. - 2300 B. P., or later), with a gradual decrease in pH resulting from declining fluxes of base cations from catchment soils; (ii) a human induced alkalization period (2300 B. P. - 1900 A. D.), with a pH increase due to human activities in the catchments; (iii) the recent acidification period (about 1900 A. D. - present), when pH decreased towards 4. 5 due to acid deposition and possibly ceased land-use; and (iv) the liming period (1970 s - present), when pH often increases to values above 7 following lime treatment to counteract acidification. The implications of these past pH changes for the concept of contemporary lake acidification and for liming policy are outlined. digitalisering@um...|$|R
40|$|Nitrogen oxides {{in ambient}} air in {{industrial}} countries {{result mainly from}} emissions of nitric oxide (NO) from fossil fuel combustion. In the presence of ozone (O 3), NO is rapidly converted into nitrogen dioxide (NO 2). Further oxidation of NO 2 leads {{to the formation of}} a range of compounds, the most important of which are: nitric acid (HNO 3), peroxy acetyl nitrate (PAN) and nitrous acid (HNO 2). The environmental effects of these compounds include eutrophication of <b>natural</b> ecosystems, <b>acidification</b> and photochemical air pollution. It is therefore necessary to understand the dry deposition processes for these compounds and use this understanding to provide estimates of dry deposition inputs to ecosystems across Europe. This review outlines current understanding of the exchange processes and methods used to estimate regional NOy deposition. Several methods have been used to measure dry deposition. Among these micrometeorological methods provide the best approach for estimating fluxes in the field. However, few field measurements of the deposition velocity of NO 2 to important ecosystems have been reported and the results have not always been conclusive. Measurement artefacts such as non-stationarity caused by local sources, monitors responding to other gases than NO 2 and the influence of photochemical reactions have made field measurement very difficult. More recent field work however has provided strong indications that NO 2 deposition to vegetation is controlled by stomatal opening. This implies that the deposition velocity shows a marked diurnal as well as an annual cycle with maximum values up to 1 cm s− 1 during the day in the summer. Few measurements of HNO 2 exchange have been reported, but based on knowledge of its physical-chemical properties it is expected that HNO 2 is taken up via stomata. Measurements of PAN also indicate uptake controlled by stomatal opening. Several measurements have shown that deposition of HNO 3 is limited only by the rate of its aerodynamic transport to the surface leading to deposition velocities as large as 10 cm s− 1 to forest. For NO the situation is more complex. Early laboratory studies using high concentrations showed stomatal uptake. However detailed field studies carried out more recently at ambient concentrations show that most ecosystems emit NO. To provide spatial patterns of nitrogen oxide deposition, information on the concentration in air as well as an estimate of the deposition velocity is needed. For the purpose of regional dry deposition estimates, the widely separated rural monitoring stations are adequate to provide broad-scale concentration fields for NO 2. For the other gases, information is scarce and concentrations need to be derived from calculations with long-range transport models. These coarse concentration fields may be combined with statistical information on land use within each grid cell. Deposition to each land-use category within each grid cell can then be calculated using a resistance layer model. An example of this approach is provided for the UK. This exercise showed that the input of NO 2 varies between 1 kg N ha− 1 year− 1 for remote areas to 10 kg N ha− 1 year− 1 in more polluted areas, with NO 2 concentrations in excess of 10 ppb. ...|$|R
40|$|Although Lactococcus {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{extensively}} studied lactic acid bacteria and is the paradigm for biochemical studies of citrate metabolism, little information is available on the regulation of the citrate lyase complex. In order to fill this gap, we characterized the genes encoding the subunits of the citrate lyase of Lactococcus lactis CRL 264, which are located on an 11. 4 -kb chromosomal DNA region. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed a cluster of eight genes in a new type of genetic organization. The citM-citCDEFXG operon (cit operon) is transcribed as a single polycistronic mRNA of 8. 6 kb. This operon carries a gene encoding a malic enzyme (CitM, a putative oxaloacetate decarboxylase), the structural genes coding for the citrate lyase subunits (citD, citE, and citF), and the accessory genes required for the synthesis of an active citrate lyase complex (citC, citX, and citG). We have found that the cit operon is induced by <b>natural</b> <b>acidification</b> of the medium during cell growth or by a shift to media buffered at acidic pHs. Between the citM and citC genes is a divergent open reading frame whose expression was also increased at acidic pH, which was designated citI. This inducible response to acid stress takes place at the transcriptional level and correlates with increased activity of citrate lyase. It is suggested that coordinated induction of the citrate transporter, CitP, and citrate lyase by acid stress provides a mechanism to make the cells (more) resistant to the inhibitory effects of the fermentation product (lactate) that accumulates under these conditions...|$|E
40|$|In Palau, {{calcification}} {{rates of}} two reef-building coral genera (Porites and Favia) are maintained across a strong natural gradient in aragonite saturation state (Omega ar) ranging from 3. 7 to 2. 3. This observation contrasts the strong sensitivity to decreasing ?ar that these genera demonstrate in both laboratory CO 2 manipulation experiments and in field studies. Moreover, {{in contrast to}} other naturally more acidic coral reefs, benthic communities in Palau's low-Omega ar (Omega ar = 2. 3) Rock Island reefs display ecological indices consistent with healthy communities. A laboratory CO 2 manipulation experiment and a field-based reciprocal transplant were used to investigate whether the apparent lack of sensitivity to ocean acidification of Palau's Porites corals {{can be attributed to}} local adaptation to chronic acidification or to environmental factors that allow corals to thrive despite extreme pH conditions. In a two-month laboratory incubation, calcification rates of Palau Porites from both environments were insensitive to changes in Omega ar over the range 1. 5 to 3. 0, suggestive of an adaptive, rather than environmental, mechanism for acidification tolerance. However, in the reciprocal transplant, corals transplanted between reefs at different ambient ?ar levels showed significant declines in calcification rates and high mortality, while corals returned back to their reef of origin were alive after 17 months in the field. Interpreted {{within the framework of the}} experimental result, the failure of pH/Omega ar-tolerant corals to successfully transplant between different reef sites hints at local adaptation to other (non-pH) environmental factors such as light, temperature, and/or flow that co-vary with Omega ar across Palau's <b>natural</b> <b>acidification</b> gradient...|$|E
40|$|Strategic {{framework}} document for liming of acidified {{waters in}} Stockholm County This report assesses trends in acidification {{and the status}} of acidified lakes and rivers in Stockholm County (SE Sweden). It also presents a framework for liming of lakes, which includes a liming strategy, an action plan, an environmental quality monitoring plan and a policy for government subsidies for liming. The action plan follows the liming strategy presented in the Swedish national liming guidelines (Swedish Environmental Protection Agency, Handbook 2002 : 1). In order to combat acidification, approximately 30 lakes in Stockholm County have been treated with lime since the late 1970 s. Conditions in the lakes have clearly improved, and acidic lakes are rare in Stockholm County today. In eight of the nine reference lakes used for baseline monitoring, pH values had increased since 1990. On average, pH values in the reference lakes have increased by 0. 013 units per year. Treatment with lime has been so successful that Stockholm County has now achieved one of the national interim targets for the Swedish environmental quality objective “ <b>Natural</b> <b>acidification</b> only”. According to the interim target, “By 2010 not more than 5 % of all lakes and 15 % of the total length of running water in the country will be affected by anthropogenic acidification”. The lakes of Stockholm County are less affected by acidification than the average Swedish lake, and are more resistant to deposition of sulphur and nitrogen. In a study of 164 lakes, acid deposition exceeded the critical load (the load below which inputs of acidic substances can be neutralized by soilweathering processes) in eight lakes only. We estimate that at current levels of acidic deposition, only 8 % of the lakes (66 of all 790 lakes in the county) risk becoming acidic. This is equivalent to 66 km 2 of lake area, or 2 % of the total lake area in the county (excluding Lake Mälaren) ...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the impact of}} whole-tree harvest (WTH) on soils and surface waters acid-base status in coniferous forests compared with conventional harvesting (CH). A combination of field observations (up to four decades) and dynamic modelling was {{used to describe the}} impact on soil calcium (Ca²⁺) pools and surface water acid neutralizing capacity (ANC). The studies were undertaken in northern and southern Sweden at sites belonging to the long-term wood fuel experiment (HELTRAD) and the ICP Integrated Monitoring (IM) programme. One of the most important findings was that WTH and CH caused large depletions (up to 60 %) in soil exchangeable Ca²⁺ pools, circa 40 years after harvest. Despite these losses, tree growth and vitality has not yet been impaired. The results also implied that the fastest depletion rates occurred in CH-plots why soil Ca²⁺ pools between CH and WTH have become more similar with time. However, soil Ca²⁺ pools still remained significantly lower after WTH. Measured differences in soil solution showed that the impact of WTH on ANC was small (16 μEq l⁻¹) and temporary but site-specific. This difference was not large enough to counteract the <b>natural</b> recovery from <b>acidification</b> or lead to adverse ecological effects. The results indicate that WTH can have a large impact on soil exchangeable pools without causing surface water acidification in the absence of strong acid mobile anions. The rapidly declining soil Ca²⁺ pools may be of concern for sustainable forest management. However, trees will likely respond to lower Ca²⁺ availability by e. g. adjusting their uptake or develop biological feed-back mechanisms. The model predictions unanimously suggested that tree growth and net accumulation of nutrients in biomass caused large depletions in soil exchangeable Ca²⁺ pools and a decrease in stream ANC during the 19 th and 20 th centuries, exacerbated by acid deposition. Future predictions also suggested that these Ca²⁺ losses would continue accelerated by more intense harvesting practices. The impact on modelled stream ANC was smaller and depended on the concentrations of mobile anions. The empirical data pointed {{in the same direction as}} the MAGIC predictions, but the model exaggerated the impact. Until the discrepancy between measured and modelled impact have been resolved, interpretations changes related WTH using dynamic modelling or mass balance budget calculations should be done with caution...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2017 Access {{restricted}} to the OSU Community, at author's request, from January 24, 2017 - January 24, 2018 Oceanic uptake of rising anthropogenic CO₂ emissions has caused the emergence of ocean acidification as {{a major threat to}} marine ecosystems worldwide. Along eastern boundary current systems, seawater is naturally acidified due to coastal upwelling of low pH seawater from depth. Compounded by ocean acidification, upwelling regions are expected to become increasingly corrosive to calcifying organisms, potentially forcing them beyond their physiological tolerance windows. In my dissertation, I focused on the impacts of ocean acidification on calcareous coralline algae in the California Current System. Using coralline algae in rocky intertidal habitats as model organisms, I extend the implications of ocean acidification from the organismal level to the broader community level. Global environmental change implies not only gradual changes in the mean values of environmental variables but also an increase in variability and the likelihood of rare, extreme events. In Chapter 2, I conducted a laboratory experiment to explore potential interactions between two different types of environmental stressors. Specifically, I tested the effects of elevated pCO₂, including variable pCO₂ treatments, and a severe desiccation event on the coralline species, Corallina vancouveriensis. I found that C. vancouveriensis growth was negatively impacted by both elevated pCO₂ and desiccation stress, although their combined effects were approximately additive rather than synergistic. Furthermore, while high pCO₂ at constant levels only caused small reductions in algal growth over a two-week period, these effects were exacerbated by pCO₂ variability. One criticism of laboratory experiments testing species responses to environmental change is that they isolate organisms under simplified conditions. The potential of overlooking important biotic or abiotic factors present in the natural environment limits the inferences that can be made from laboratory studies. In Chapter 3, I conducted a reciprocal removal experiment at two field sites and two wave exposures to investigate potential changes in the interactions between coralline and fleshy turf-forming algae since the 1980 s. I used as a baseline the results from a similar study conducted nearly 30 years ago that failed to detect spatial competition between coralline and fleshy algae. Despite the progression of ocean acidification over the last three decades, my results indicated that the lack of competition between coralline and fleshy algae persists to this day, with results consistent across both sites and wave exposures. The findings in Chapter 3 refer to present-day interactions, but in the future, ocean acidification is expected to be detrimental to coralline algae while potentially benefitting fleshy algae. Both coralline and fleshy algae form turf habitats that shelter diverse epifaunal communities. Thus, changes in the algal composition of turf habitats may lead to broader changes encompassing epifaunal communities, depending on the degree of specialization displayed in epifaunal habitat associations. In Chapter 4, I compared the abundance, richness, and community composition of epifauna between coralline and fleshy turf habitats at four sites along the Oregon-California coast. I found that epifauna were more abundant in coralline turfs due to higher turf density. However, epifaunal richness and community composition were similar between turf types, indicating high levels of redundancy in habitat provision between coralline and fleshy algae. Since most species of epifauna tended to be turf generalists, they may be resistant to the potential indirect effects of ocean acidification involving declines in coralline turf habitat. My dissertation combined a variety of standard ecological methodologies to help translate ocean acidification impacts from the organismal level to the community level. Overall, while I found that elevated pCO₂ decreased coralline growth in the laboratory, evidence from the field suggested a capacity for communities to resist the effects of ocean acidification and remain resilient. In the <b>natural</b> environment, ocean <b>acidification</b> impacts may be moderated by multiple environmental variables working in different directions, the temporal dynamics of stressors allowing for periods of recovery, and species interactions having dampening effects. One way forward to unite theories of change with those of resistance is to identify ecosystem indicators and critical thresholds that may help provide a more comprehensive view of ecosystem functioning and stability in the face of global change...|$|R
40|$|Global {{climate change}} is {{threatening}} the structure, function, and health of ecosystems. While factors of climate change have been studied extensively {{over the past few}} decades, most research has focused on the response of single organisms or populations; as our ecosystems are comprised of complex interactions and relationships, it is of critical importance to understand how entire communities are going to be impacted by climate change. Ocean acidification (a by-product of increased atmospheric carbon dioxide, CO 2), and nutrient loading are two major forces of global change that are projected to have detrimental impacts on coastal marine species and ecosystems. Most work on ocean acidification has focused on the response of calcifying organisms, where the changes in ocean chemistry associated with acidification enhance shell dissolution and impair growth. However, while calcifying species are expected to exhibit negative responses to acidification, primary producers, like macroalgae, are expected to flourish. ^ Both ocean acidification and nutrient loading can stimulate the growth and productivity of opportunistic, fast-growing, ephemeral macroalgae at the expense of foundational species such as corals, seagrasses, and long-lived, perennial macroalgae (i. e. kelps). As a result, these ecosystems will likely undergo major shifts in structure, function, and diversity. Few studies have investigated the interactive effects of ocean acidification and nutrient loading, particularly in terms of community response and trophic interactions. Despite increasing the growth rates of macroalgae, the presence and diversity of herbivores within an ecosystem has the potential to control this expected algal growth. The research described in this dissertation aims to: 1) quantify the combined effects of ocean acidification and nutrient loading on the growth, tissue quality, and competition of two abundant macroalgal species with different life histories; 2) test whether or not an abundant grazer can enhance consumption of macroalgae under future conditions of acidification and nutrients, promoting community resilience; 3) describe the impact of ocean acidification on the growth and diversity of reef-associated turf algal communities. ^ Using a laboratory mesocosm design, the response of Ulva (an ephemeral, opportunistic green alga) and Fucus (a long-lived, perennial brown alga) to the interaction of two levels of ocean acidification and two levels of nutrients was tested. Individual, field-collected algal thalli were placed in flow-through seawater systems with one of four experimental conditions: high pCO 2 (~ 1100 µatm) or background pCO 2 (~ 390 µatm) and high nutrients (200 µM TN) or low nutrients (10 µM TN), in a fully factorial design. Three experiments were run: the first two investigated the response of Ulva and Fucus in monocultures; the third tested the response of both species cultured together (biculture). Growth rates and tissue quality (via carbon to nitrogen ratios, C:N) were measured after 21 days of exposure to treatments. Ocean acidification and nutrient loading significantly increased the growth in Ulva, where growth rates under high pCO 2 and high nutrients were about 3 X greater than those grown under ambient conditions, with the environmental factors appearing to have an additive impact on Ulva growth. Growth rates of Fucus were unaffected by environmental conditions. Both species exhibited an increase in tissue quality as a result of decreased C:N when exposed to high nutrients. Response variables were compared between monoculture and biculture experiments for both species. Growth rates of Ulva and Fucus were unaffected by the treatment culture, but tissue C:N of Fucus was significantly higher when grown with Ulva, indicating potential resource competition, where Ulva outcompetes Fucus. ^ The enhanced growth exhibited by Ulva supports previous work indicating the enhanced growth of opportunistic algal species under future climate conditions. While this could be troubling for species inhabiting coastal ecosystems (such as seagrasses, non-bloom forming macroalgae, and fish), grazers may hold the key to mitigating algal growth and keeping ecosystems in balance. Consumption rates and feeding preferences of a common marine snail (Littorina littorea) were tested using the same experimental design and environmental parameters detailed above. Snails were placed in treatment mesocosms for seven days and were given a choice of Ulva and Fucus. High pCO 2 levels significantly reduced macroalgal consumption by about 50 % and snails switched from a mixed algal diet to feeding exclusively on Ulva. Respiration rates for L. littorea were measured, and under high pCO 2 respiration was significantly reduced. Artificial food trials were run to help explain the diet preference change. No difference was found comparing consumption of the artificial food, pointing to the preference shift being driven by algal tissue toughness. ^ Reef ecosystems have been well studied with respect to ocean acidification. This research shows that corals are overtaken by fleshy macroalgae and fast-growing turf algae. Here, we tested the response of turf algal communities to three levels of ocean <b>acidification.</b> <b>Natural</b> turf communities growing on coral rubble from the Great Barrier Reef, Australia were collected and exposed to ambient, medium, and high pCO 2 treatments in mesocosms for 41 days. Communities were assessed for biomass and genus diversity. Biomass of turf communities was significantly higher under high pCO 2. Turf community evenness and diversity significantly increased under high pCO 2. This change in community structure is likely due to the decline in abundance of Polysiphonia (a filamentous, branched red algae). The results indicate that enhanced turf growth under conditions of acidification will aid in the growth and expansion of macroalgae at the expense of corals in reef ecosystems. Changes in turf diversity should inform how larger macroalgal communities may be structured in the future. ^ This research highlights the success that opportunistic macroalgae and turf algae will have under future climate conditions. The success of macroalgae, however, comes {{at the expense of other}} critical and foundational species within a community. In addition, macroalgal communities are likely to undergo assemblage shifts as well, due to species-specific responses to environmental change, where species gain a competitive advantage. Top-down forces, such as grazing, may protect against changes in community structure and macroalgal assemblages, but only if grazers are not negatively impacted directly by environmental change. If grazers exhibit decreased consumption and are unable to keep up with anticipated algal growth, this will ultimately enhance macroalgal abundance in coastal ecosystems. ...|$|R
