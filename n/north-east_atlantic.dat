25|$|In {{the effort}} to build an {{independent}} British nuclear weapon in the 1940s and 1950s, the Sellafield plant was constructed; diluted radioactive waste was discharged by pipeline into the Irish Sea. Greenpeace claims that the Irish Sea {{remains one of the}} most heavily contaminated seas in the world because of these discharges. Ocean scientist David Assinger has challenged this general suggestion, and cites the Dead Sea as the most radioactive sea in the world. The Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the <b>North-East</b> <b>Atlantic</b> (OSPAR Convention) reports an estimated 200 kilograms (441 lb) of plutonium has been deposited in the marine sediments of the Irish Sea. Cattle and fish in the area have been contaminated with plutonium-239 and caesium-137 from these sediments and from other sources such as the radioactive rain that fell on the area after the Chernobyl disaster. Most of the area's long-lived radioactive technetium comes from the reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel at the Sellafield facility.|$|E

40|$|A {{sediment}} core {{from the}} <b>north-east</b> North <b>Atlantic</b> contains high-resolution co-registered foraminiferal δ 18 O and ice-rafted detritus (IRD) {{records for the}} last deglaciation. These reveal a distinct ice-rafting event that occurred {{at the time of}} Greenland Interstade 1 d (GI- 1 d), a feature also seen in other high-resolution cores from the North Atlantic. The occurrence of a geographically widespread peak in IRD at ice distal sites at a time when increased freshwater flux to the surface ocean is inferred to have caused rapid cooling suggests a mechanistic link between the processes, analogous to the Younger Dryas (GS- 1) cooling episode. The general absence of IRD at southern locations at other times during GI- 1 when the flux of icebergs from surviving ice sheets to northern locations continued suggests that the GI- 1 d IRD peak represents a time of hyrdrographic reorganization which changed IRD dispersal. While numerous studies have suggested freshwater flux as a major driver of rapid climate oscillations observed around the North Atlantic during the last deglaciation, the evidence presented here both supports that mechanism and highlights the potential for rapid and major reorganization of the North Atlantic's surface hydrography to explain changes in IRD flux independently of ice sheet calving dynamics...|$|R

40|$|A {{series of}} {{long-chain}} (C 37, C 38, C 39), primarily di and tri-unsaturated methyl and ethyl ketones, first identified in sediments from Walvis Ridge off West Africa and from Black Sea (de Leeuw et al., 1979), {{has been found}} in marine sediments throughout the world (Brassell et al., 1986 doi: 10. 1038 / 320129 a 0). The marine coccolithophorid Emiliania huxleyi and members of the class Prymnesiophyceae are now the recognized sources of these compounds (Volkman et al., 1979; Marlowe, et al., 1984). Experiments with laboratory cultures of algae showed the degree of unsaturation in the ketone seris biosynthesized depends on growth temperature (Brassell et al., 1986; Marlowe, 1984), a physiological respons observed for classical membrane lipids (vanDeenen et al., 1972). Brassell and co-workers (Brassell et al., 198; Brassell et al., 1986 b) thus proposed that systematic fluctuations in the unsaturation of these alkenones noted down-core in sediments from the Kane Gap region of the <b>north-east</b> tropical <b>Atlantic</b> Ocean and correlated with glacial-interglacial cycles provide an organic geochemical measure of past sea-surface water temperatures. Using laboratory cultures of E. huxleyi, we have calibrated changes in the unsaturation pattern of the long-chain ketone series versus growth temperature. The calibration curve is linear and accurtely predicts unsuturation patterns observed in natural particulate materials collected from oceanic waters of known temperature. We present evidence supporting the proposed paleotemperature hypothesis (Brassell et al., 1986, Brassel et al., 1986 b) and suggesting absolute 'sea-surface temperatures' for a given oceanic location can be estimated from an analysis of long-chain ketone compositions preserved in glacial and interglacial horizons of deep-sea sediment cores...|$|R

40|$|Sagitta elegans and S. setosa {{are the two}} {{dominant}} chaetognaths in the <b>North-East</b> (NE) <b>Atlantic.</b> They {{are closely}} related and have a similar ecology and life history, but differ in distributional ranges. Sagitta setosa is a typical neritic species occurring exclusively above shelf regions, whereas S. elegans is a more oceanic species with a widespread distribution. We hypothesised that neritic species, because of smaller and more fragmented populations, {{would have been more}} vulnerable to population bottlenecks resulting from range contractions during Pleistocene glaciations than oceanic species. To test this hypothesis we compared mitochondrial Cytochrome Oxidase II DNA sequences of S. elegans and S. setosa from sampling locations across the NE Atlantic. Both species displayed very high levels of genetic diversity with unique haplotypes for every sequenced individual and an approximately three times higher level of nucleotide diversity in S. elegans (0. 061) compared to S. setosa (0. 021). Sagitta setosa mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplotypes produced a star-like phylogeny and a uni-modal mismatch distribution indicative of a bottleneck followed by population expansion. In contrast, S. elegans had a deeper mtDNA phylogeny and a multi-modal mismatch distribution as would be expected from a more stable population. Neutrality tests indicated that assumptions of the standard neutral model were violated for both species and results from the McDonald-Kreitman test suggested that selection {{played a role in the}} evolution of their mitochondrial DNA. Congruent with these results, both species had much smaller effective population sizes estimated from genetic data when compared to census population sizes estimated from abundance data, with a factor of similar to 10 (8) - 10 (9) difference. Assuming that selective effects are comparable for the two species, we conclude that the difference in genetic signature can only be explained by contrasting demographic histories. Our data are consistent with the hypothesis that in the NE Atlantic, the neritic S. setosa has been more severely affected by population bottlenecks resulting from Pleistocene range shifts than the more oceanic S. elegans...|$|R
40|$|Effects of {{large-scale}} atmospheric circulation and surface temperatures on extreme dryness and wetness on the Tibetan plateau in summer are analysed using ERA- 40 reanalysis and observed precipitation. The extreme cases of drought and wetness can {{be associated with}} circulation anomalies in the North Atlantic/European sector and wave trains bridging the Eurasian continent. Drought in Tibet reveals an intense high pressure anomaly over Scandinavia supported by a more south-west to <b>north-east</b> orientated North <b>Atlantic</b> stormtrack. This creates wave trains crossing Eurasia which, on their southward 'great circle route', reach south-eastern Asia where they modulate the flow north and east of the Tibetan plateau by an anticyclone cyclone dipole suppressing moisture supply from the Bay of Bengal. Wetness in Tibet is characterised by a more zonally oriented cross Atlantic stormtrack creating a low pressure anomaly over central Europe and, associated with it, a northward shift of the sub-tropical westerly and tropical easterly jet; wave trains emerging from the North Atlantic on their equatorward route have now a higher chance to reach the sub-tropical jet entrance (instead of propagating further south). Then the wave trains are re-intensified and, passing the Mediterranean Arabian Sea route to India, interact with the monsoon's western branch to lead to ample moisture supply for Tibet. Surface temperatures give indications for positive (negative) El Nino/Southern Oscillation and Indian Ocean Dipole episodes occurring in years of extreme and severe dryness (wetness) on the Tibetan plateau. A pronounced cold surface temperature anomaly in the tropical North Atlantic precedes and accompanies drought on the plateau...|$|R
