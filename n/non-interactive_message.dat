40|$|Abstract. Vaudenay {{recently}} {{proposed a}} message authentication protocol which is interactive {{and based on}} short authenticated strings (SAS). We study here SASbased <b>non-interactive</b> <b>message</b> authentication protocols (NIMAP). We start by the analysis of two popular <b>non-interactive</b> <b>message</b> authentication protocols. The first one {{is based on a}} collision-resistant hash function and was presented by Balfanz et al. The second protocol is based on a universal hash function family and was proposed by Gehrmann, Mitchell, and Nyberg. It uses much less authenticated bits but requires a stronger authenticated channel. We propose a protocol which can achieve the same security as the first protocol but using less authenticated bits, without any stronger communication model, and without requiring a hash function to be collision-resistant. Finally, we demonstrate the optimality of our protocol. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} <b>non-interactive</b> <b>message</b> authentica-tion using two channels: an insecure broadband channel and an authenticated narrow-band channel. This problem has been considered {{in the context of}} ad hoc networks, where it is assumed that there is neither a secret key shared among the two parties, nor a public-key infrastructure in place. We present a formal framework for protocols of this type, along with a new protocol which is as efficient as the best previous protocols. The security of our protocol is based on a new property of hash functions that we introduce, which we name “hybrid-collision resistance”. 1...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} new <b>non-interactive</b> <b>message</b> {{authentication}} protocol in manual channel model (NIMAP, for short) using the weakest assumption on the manual channel (i. e. assuming the strongest adversary). Our protocol uses enhanced target collision resistant (eTCR) hash family and is provably {{secure in the}} standard model. We compare our protocol with protocols with similar properties and show that the new NIMAP has the same security level as the best previously known NIMAP whilst it is more practical. In particular, to authenticate a message such as a 1024 -bit public key, we require an eTCR hash family that can be constructed from any off-the-shelf Merkle-Damgård hash function using randomized hashing mode. The underlying compression function must be evaluated second preimage resistant (eSPR), which is a strictly weaker security property than collision resistance...|$|E
40|$|In this note, we prove lower bounds on {{the amount}} of entropy of random sources {{necessary}} for secure message authentication. We consider the problem of <b>non-interactive</b> c-time <b>message</b> au-thentication using a weak secret key having min-entropy k. We show that existing constructions using (c+ 1) -wise independent hash functions are optimal. This result resolves one of the main questions left open by the work of Dodis and Spencer [2] who considered this problem for one-time message authentication of one-bit messages. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{give the}} first {{exponential}} separation between quantum and classical multi-party communication complexity in the (non-interactive) one-way and simultaneous message passing settings. For every k, we demonstrate a relational communication problem between k parties {{that can be}} solved exactly by a quantum simultaneous message passing protocol of cost c / k 2 O (log n) and requires protocols of cost n, where c> 0 is a constant, in the classical <b>non-interactive</b> one-way <b>message</b> passing model with shared randomness and bounded error. Thus our� � separation�of corresponding communication classes is superpolynomial log n as long as k = 3 D o and exponential for k = 3 D O (1). ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Social {{mobilisation}} during new vaccine introductions encourages acceptance, uptake and {{adherence to}} multi-dose schedules. Effective communication is considered {{especially important for}} human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine, which targets girls of an often-novel age group. This study synthesised experiences and lessons learnt around social mobilisation, consent, and acceptability during 55 HPV vaccine demonstration projects and 8 national programmes in 37 low and middle-income countries (LMICs) between January 2007 and January 2015. Methods A qualitative study design included: (i) a systematic review, in which 1, 301 abstracts from five databases were screened and 41 publications included; (ii) soliciting 124 unpublished documents from governments and partner institutions; and (iii) conducting 27 key informant interviews. Data were extracted and analysed thematically. Additionally, first-dose coverage rates were categorised as above 90  %, 90 – 70  %, and below 70  %, and cross-tabulated with mobilisation timing, message content, materials and methods of delivery, and consent procedures. Results All but one delivery experience achieved over 70  % first-dose coverage; 60  % achieved over 90  %. Key informants emphasized the benefits of starting social mobilisation early and actively addressing rumours as they emerged. Interactive communication with parents appeared to achieve higher first-dose coverage than <b>non-interactive</b> <b>messaging.</b> Written parental consent (i. e., opt-in), though frequently used, resulted in lower reported coverage than implied consent (i. e., opt-out). Protection against cervical cancer was {{the primary reason for}} vaccine acceptability, whereas fear of adverse effects, exposure to rumours, lack of project/programme awareness, and schoolgirl absenteeism were major reasons for non-vaccination. Conclusions Despite some challenges in obtaining parental consent and addressing rumours, experiences indicated effective social mobilisation and high HPV vaccine acceptability in LMICs. Social mobilisation, consent, and acceptability lessons were consistent across world regions and HPV vaccination projects/programmes. These can be used to guide HPV vaccination communication strategies without additional formative research...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{examine the}} problem of message and entity {{recognition}} {{in the context of}} ad hoc networks. We review the definitions and the security model described in the literature and examine previous recognition protocols described in [1], [2], [3], [7], and [8]. We prove that there is a one to one correspondence between <b>non-interactive</b> <b>message</b> recognition protocols and digital signature schemes. Hence, we concentrate on designing interactive recognition protocols. We look at [3] in more detail and suggest a variant to overcome a certain shortcoming. In particular, in case of communication failure or adversarial disruption, this protocol is not equipped with a practical resynchronization process and can fail to resume. We propose a variant of this protocol which is equipped with a resynchronization technique that allows users to resynchronize whenever they wish or when they suspect an intrusion. 1...|$|E
40|$|College males’ uptake {{of human}} {{papilloma}} virus (HPV) vaccination is low. Prior research indicates perceived susceptibility to HPV among college males is also low. Construal level theory may offer a framework to alter perceived susceptibility and intention to vaccinate, but {{little research has}} examined this potential. Construal level theory provides foundational elements including that low construal level of perceptions is associated with more proximal psychological distance (hypothetical, social, temporal and spatial). Research indicates a disparity in college males’ susceptibility estimates which suggests high hypothetical distance. A reduction in hypothetical distance should be indicated by a measured increase in perceived susceptibility. Additionally, if construal level primed by messages is consistently associated with stage of change, then movement through stages of change might be promoted by influencing construal level such that perceived hypothetical distance is reduced. Additionally, the impact of interactivity on construal level and associated outcomes was explored. This study included two online experiments. In the first, a message was presented in components based on construal level dimensions. The second experiment was a 2 x 2, including high construal interactive message, low construal interactive message, high construal <b>non-interactive</b> <b>message,</b> and low construal <b>non-interactive</b> <b>message</b> conditions. The outcome variables of interest in both cases are hypothetical distance, barrier construal, stage of change and intention to vaccinate for HPV. Construal level dimensions did not offer explanatory value {{to the relationship between}} barriers and stage of change, a temporal measure of vaccination intention. However, the results indicate that perceptions of messages as lower construal are associated with increases in perceived susceptibility and intention to vaccinate for HPV. Perceived interactivity was associated with reduced social distance and increase in intention to vaccinate. This study suggests that construal level theory may be useful in the formative evaluations for HPV-related campaigns targeting males. This study also supports the addition of interactive elements to health campaigns, however the exact type of interactivity warrants further research. Limitations and directions for future research are discussed. ...|$|E

Our IMAP is based on the computational assumption that ICR hash functions exist. It performs better than message authentication protocols that are based on computational assumptions. That is, while achieving the same level of security, the amount of information sent over the authenticated channel in our IMAP is smaller than the most secure IMAP and <b>Non-interactive</b> <b>Message</b> Authentication Protocol (NIMAP) in the literature. In other words, if we send the same amount of information over the authenticated channel, we can allow much stronger adversaries compared to the existing protocols in the literature. Moreover, our IMAP benefits from a simple structure and works under fewer security assumptions compared to other IMAPs in the literature. The efficient and easy-to-use structure of our IMAP makes it very practical in real world ad hoc network scenarios...|$|E

We improve this protocol by suggesting a variant which is equipped with a resynchronization process. Moreover, another variant of the protocol is proposed which self-recovers in case of an intrusion.

40|$|Cryptographic hash {{functions}} {{have been}} used to a great extent in many applications; most importantly, as building blocks for digital signature schemes and message authentication codes (MACs), as well as in commitment schemes, password protection, key derivation, and almost every practical cryptographic protocol. Unlike many other cryptographic primitives which are usually intended to fulfill specific security notions, hash functions, as workhorses of cryptography, are often expected to satisfy a wide and application dependent spectrum of security notions, ranging from merely being a one-way function to acting as a truly random function or random oracle (ideal hash). In this Thesis, we revisit the theory and application of cryptographic hash functions. We provide new contributions to this field, which has been explored for over three decades, yet remains a highly active and interesting area of research. We pursue, in particular, a line of research considering essential theoretical questions in regard to the security features of hash functions, including formal definitions of security notions, the relationships among different security notions, and the possibility of designing property-preserving domain extension transforms for hash functions. First, we study notions of security for cryptographic hash functions. Our main goal in this part is to consider the two essential theoretical questions in regard to security notions for hash functions; namely, formal definitions of security notions and the relationships among different security notions. Our contribution in this part includes: a clear categorization of security notions, the introduction of a new set of enhanced security notions and, most importantly, a full picture of the relationships among the security notions. We then investigate the property preservation capabilities of domain extension transforms for hash functions. Almost all cryptographic hash functions are designed based on the following two-step approach: first, a compression function is designed which is only capable of hashing fixed-length messages, then, a domain extension transform is applied to obtain a full-fledged hash function. The possibility of designing a property-preserving domain extension transform, which is also known as a property-preserving mode of operation, is an important problem to be considered with regard to the construction of secure hash functions. We make the following two contributions. Firstly, we analyse the most powerful multi-property-preserving (MPP) domain extension transforms for hash functions in the literature, and provide a full picture of their MPP capabilities with regard to a large collection of known security notions. Secondly, we investigate the capabilities of several different domain extension transforms in regard to preserving an interesting recently proposed security notion, called enhanced target collision resistance (eTCR). Finally, as an interesting application of hash functions, we consider manual channel message authentication protocols using hash functions. In the manual channel model for message authentication, also known as the two-channel or SAS-based model, the sender and the receiver are assumed to have access to a low-bandwidth auxiliary channel, ensuring authentication, in addition to a typical insecure channel; however, neither they share any secret information nor there is any trusted public key infrastructure (PKI). We investigate the problem of random oracle instantiation for a three-round interactive message authentication protocol (IMAP). We also provide an efficient <b>non-interactive</b> <b>message</b> authentication protocol (NIMAP) in the manual channel model that is based on an eTCR hash function...|$|E
