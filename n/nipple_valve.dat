5000|$|Pouchitis, a term {{coined by}} Kock to {{describe}} the reservoir ileitis seen in recipients of any pouch procedure, is a common one. [...] Also, the first Kock pouches were not created with any type of valve mechanism. The procedure required additional development, work which Kock continued to advance through further experimentation into the 1970s and 1980s. [...] Early experience showed that 50% of those receiving the procedure would not stay continent afterward. Kock developed what he termed a [...] "nipple valve" [...] in 1972 to help eliminate a portion of these problems. The <b>nipple</b> <b>valve</b> was created from intestinal tissue itself.|$|E
5000|$|The late Dr. William O. Barnett began {{modifying the}} Kock pouch in 1979. He {{believed}} {{in the concept of}} the continent reservoir, but was disappointed with the valve's relatively high failure rate. Barnett was intent on solving the problem. His first change was {{in the construction of the}} <b>nipple</b> <b>valve.</b> He changed the direction of flow within this segment of intestine to keep the valve in place. This greatly improved the success rate. In addition, he used a plastic material called Marlex to form a collar around the valve. This further stabilized and supported the valve, decreasing valve slippage. This technique worked well, but after several years, the intestine reacted to the Marlex by forming fistulae (abnormal connections) into the valve. Dr. Barnett continued his investigation in an effort to improve these results. After much effort, the idea came to him—a [...] "living collar" [...] constructed from the small intestine itself. This technique made the valve more stable and eliminated the problems the Marlex collars had presented.|$|E
40|$|A {{variety of}} devices {{have been used}} to {{establish}} long-term intestinal access in laboratory animals. Their use is complicated by infection, tissue reaction, and a frequent need for single housing to prevent implant damage. Intussuscepted nipple valves have long been used in the human field of surgery for various applications where {{there is a need to}} create a reservoir without leakage. With the use of the <b>nipple</b> <b>valve</b> it was possible to establish long-term intestinal access in dogs with minimal post-operative complications, no leakage and, because no foreign material was used, no complications due to tissue rejection. The advantages of a <b>nipple</b> <b>valve</b> over the similar technique of a straight stoma is less post-operative complications in the form of leakage as well as enhanced access due to the design of the <b>nipple</b> <b>valve.</b> Encouraging results prompted us to widen the use of nipple valves to 14 dogs in which it has been possible to establish long-term colonic or duodenal/ileal access at one or two sites. Nine of the dogs are still in use with duration of instrumentation for some animals exceeding 60 weeks. This method requires minimal maintenance, does not prevent group housing of instrumented dogs or outdoor activities nor does it compromise the quality of life for the animals...|$|E
40|$|A {{continent}} ileal bladder {{was constructed}} in six dogs. The most important requirements for a continent ileal bladder as a reliable mechanism of continency and for prevention of back flow in the ureters could be achieved by two intussusception <b>valves</b> (<b>nipples)</b> of small bowel in opposite directions. The dynamics of these "nipple valves" were studied electromanometrically and radiologically. These experiments showed that these intussusception valves did not binder a free flow in the isoperistaltic direction and did prevent reflux in the antiperistaltic direction...|$|R
40|$|From July 1985 through January 1986, 43 {{patients}} underwent urinary diversion {{that included}} {{creation of a}} continent reservoir from an ileal segment, according to the method described originally by Kock. An important modification included removal of a narrow strip of mesentery for 8 cm along the afferent and efferent limbs of the pouch to allow adequate ileal intussusception and fixation of the <b>nipple</b> <b>valves</b> to prevent reflux and to ensure continence. A strip of PGA mesh serves as a collar to fix the afferent-efferent limb to the pouch once the intussusception technique has been accomplished. The use of a narrow Marlex strip allows fixation to the abdominal wall both lateral and medial to the stoma site (insert). This strip is important in preventing a parastomal hernia and helps fix the continence valve mechanism to the posterior abdominal wall. Previous urinary diversion was by ureterosigmoidostomy in 2 patients, standard ileal conduit in 8 and chronic dialysis after nephrectomy of solitary kidney and cystectomy in 1. A total of 32 patients underwent simultaneous anterior exenteration or radical cystectomy for pelvic malignancy. There were 4 postoperative deaths and early complications occurred in one patient. Late complications occurred in only 3 patients: they required reoperation and revision of the continence valve mechanism. The end result in 39 of 43 patients has been an overwhelming success. Patients perform self-catheterization every 4 to 6 hours {{during the day and}} once at night for volumes ranging up to 1, 400 cc. Serum electolytes have remained normal in all patients. X-ray of the Kock pouch have shown no evidence of reflux, and all excretory urograms have demonstrated either normal upper tracts without obstruction or improvement in patients with preoperative hydronephrosis. Although preliminary, this clinical trial suggests that {{the quality of life for}} patients considered previously to be candidates for cutaneous diversion can be improved markedly by a modified Kock continent ileal reservoir. During the same time, 21 patients out of 278 patients who underwent creation of a Kock continent ileal urinary reservoir since August 1982, underwent revision of Kock pouch. Two of those required subsequent reoperation and revision of the continence valve mechanism. The end result in all patients has been an overwhelming success...|$|R

40|$|Objective: This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to ascertain the}} feasibility of fashioning a <b>nipple</b> <b>valve</b> from partial-thickness ileum and to assess the competence and durability of that valve. The approach employed was designed to circumvent the necessity for considerable lengths of bowel {{to be committed to}} valve formation and to avoid the tendency for desusception, present with other forms of nipple valves. Methods: A technique in which a subterminal segment of partial-thickness ileum was 2 ̆ 7 skinned 2 ̆ 7 circumferentially of serosa and muscularis propria and then intussuscepted to form a continent nipple-valve mechanism was studied for up to 4 months in 10 dogs. The intussuscepted partial-thickness ileal valve was in continuity with a terminal ileal segment sutured flush with skin and, internally, with another segment laid open and anastomosed to the bladder. Results: All valves were competent, withstanding intravesical pressures up to 90 cm H 2 O. Six dogs were catheterized, without difficulty, twice daily up to 104 days. The valve mucosal surfaces were smooth due to a loss of plicae circulares, and, between 2 ̆ 7 back-to-back 2 ̆ 7 submucosal layers, a fine stroma developed. Couclusions: This simple technique, which is frugal in its use of bowel, provided a robust and effective ileal continence mechanism. Furthermore, because of denervation and interposing fibrous tissue, this <b>nipple</b> <b>valve</b> is considered most unlikely to desuscept subsequently. The intussuscepted partial-thickness ileal valve approach is recommended now for clinical evaluation...|$|E

There were 19 {{males and}} 3 females, between 38 and 82 years old (mean age 63. 1 years). A one-stage radical cystectomy and Kock pouch construction were performed in 21 patients. One patients was converted from standard ileal conduit {{to this new}} reservoir. The keys to success of the Kock pouch are creation and maintenance of the <b>nipple</b> <b>valve</b> to prevent reflux and to ensure continence. Mesenteric fat is removed with CUSA for 8 cm along the afferent-efferent limbs of the pouch and exclusion of mesentery is limited for only 3 - 4 cm. This important modification will ensure adequate ileal intussusception and vascular supply to the valves. To prevent eversion and prolapse, the <b>nipple</b> <b>valve</b> is anchored {{to the wall of}} reservoir. A strip of sauvage filamentous Dacron serves as a collar to fix the afferent-efferent limbs to the pouch. There were 2 postoperative deaths and two major early complication: 1 acute renal failure and 1 intestinal fistula, both of which were treated conservatively. Late complications occurred in 6 patients. Of these 6 patients, 1 required reoperation and revision of the continence valve mechanism and 1 required hospitalization for entero-pouch fistula.

50|$|There are {{two types}} of {{low-pressure}} hose commonly used for suit inflation: The standard Seatec style quick release couple, fitted with an internal Schrader valve, as also used on most buoyancy compensators, and the CEJN connector which allows a higher flow rate due to a larger bore through the non-return valve in the connector. This valve can allow a dangerously fast inflation rate if it jams open, and is also more likely to free-flow when disconnected. These hoses use incompatible <b>valve</b> <b>nipples,</b> but it is usually possible to swap the fitting on the inflator valve to accept the alternative hose. Both types of BCD and dry suit inflator hoses are supplied with an O-ring sealed 3/8” male UNF thread for connection to a low-pressure first stage port.|$|R

40|$|From August 1982 through March 1988, 531 {{patients}} have undergone continent urinary diversion using an ileal reservoir constructed {{according to the}} method of Kock. For the past year, the Division of Urology at the USC School of Medicine in Los Angeles has used the principle of Kock reservoir construction for primary lower urinary tract reconstruction after cystectomy in 39 highly selected male patients {{by means of a}} ureteroileal urethrostomy. Early complications occurred in 86 of 531 patients (16. 2 %), resulting in an operative mortality rate of 1. 9 % (ten of 531). The early complication rate was 16. 5 % in patients undergoing single stage cystectomy and Kock pouch construction and 15. 2 % among patients undergoing Kock pouch conversion. Late complications have been analyzed in a group of 489 patients who have undergone Kock cutaneous diversion. The complications unique to continent urinary diversion, their incidence, and the effect of technical modifications in reducing the number of late complications are discussed. Since the time of the last modification, in July 1985, the overall incidence of late complication has dropped to 22 %. Based on this ongoing experience, the authors conclude that: 1) the continent ileal reservoir as conceived by Kock remains the best internal reservoir for bladder replacement in terms of volume, accommodation with the lowest internal pressures compared with other alternative reservoir construction, 2) the intussuscepted ileal <b>nipple</b> <b>valve</b> mechanism is a reproducible, highly effective mechanism that prevents reflux in 95 % of patients and produces excellent continence, 3) our enthusiasm remains tempered by the need for reoperation in approximately 10 - 15 % of patients, usually due to a pinhole fistula or false passage {{at the base of the}} efferent <b>nipple</b> <b>valve</b> mechanism, 4) electrolyte abnormalities rarely occur and gastrointestinal dysfunction is unusual in the absence of radiation, and 5) continent urinary diversion is a viable long-term concept that provides a real alternative in terms of quality of life and self-image for the patient undergoing urinary diversion...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To present our {{experience}} in open poucholithotomy {{as a primary}} management of large orthotopic reservoir stone burden and discuss different management options. Materials and Methods: Records of men underwent radical cystectomy and orthotopic urinary diversion were retrospectively reviewed as regards pouch stone formation. Patients with large reservoir stone burden managed by open poucholithotomy were further selected. Results: Large reservoir stone burden was encountered in 12 post radical cystectomy men. All underwent open poucholithotomy as a primary management of their reservoir stones. Median age at cystectomy was 46 (range: 32 - 55) years with a median total follow up period of 214. 15 (range: 147 - 257) months and a median interval to stone detection of 99 (range: 63 - 132) months. The median stone burden was 5260 (range: 3179 - 20410) mm 2. All patients were continent during the day while 5 showed nocturnal enuresis; 2 of them became continent after removal of the stones. Post poucholithotomy, all patients had sterile urine cultures except one who showed occasional colonization. None of the 12 patients showed stone recurrence after poucholithotomy. Two patients underwent revision of a dessuscepted <b>nipple</b> <b>valve</b> in association with stone removal. Conclusions: Open poucholithotomy for large reservoir stone burden is a feasible and safe option. It saves the reservoir mesentery and adjacent bowel. It allows complete removal of the stone(s) leaving no residual fragments. Furthermore, it permits correction of concomitant reservoir abnormalities...|$|E

She had a well-functioning KCI that she had catheterized daily for 34 years before she presented with intermittent abdominal pain and occasional bleeding from the stoma, and she reported having difficulty catheterizing her ileostomy. Computed tomography and ileoscopy demonstrated three oval enteroliths in the pouch and a lipoma in the efferent loop of the KCI ([Fig.   2]). The patient’s symptoms decreased after resection of the lipoma with a snare cautery. However, similar symptoms recurred 2 years later.

40|$|Background The {{conventional}} ileostomy can be avoided. Many {{attempts have}} been performed. The first successful solution was the continent ileostomy- Kock pouch. The high rate of complications and revisions some experienced forced surgeon to try to restore the continence by the mechanism of the anus involving an ileal pouch. Both procedures afterwards documented excellent functional outcome, but the complication rates were not negligible and the long-term failure rate were increasing. Different surgical refinements were done and the risk factors for complications and failures were investigated as experience and materials increased. Restoring of the integrity of anal function and the succsess of the ileal pouch-anal anastomosis shadowed the practise of the forerunner: the continent ileostomy reservoir. This latter procedure was more demanding and seemed {{in the first year}} of ileal pouchanal anastomosis era to have significant more complications and revisional surgery. The worldwide adoption of the pelvic pouch decreased the need for the continent ileostomy and a vicious circle evolved. Today only few centres perform the procedure. Patients who are not suitable for ileal anal-pouch anastomosis are seldom offered the possibility of having a continent ileostomy. Aims The aims of the study was to investigate surgical load, complications and long-term functional outcome and to define factors which affect these subjects in patients operated with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis, continent ileostomy or both in one single surgical department during the same period and without any institutional learning curve, and furthermore, to compare and contrast the two options. Material and methods From 1984 to 2005 (7) 304 (315) patients were operated with IPAA at St. Olavs Hospital (earlier: Regional Hospital of Trondheim). From 1983 to 2002 (7) 50 (65) patients had a continent ileostomy constructed. This was an observational study in the scope of surveillance and quality assurance. All patients were offered a planed regularly annual outpatient clinic follow up programme including a prospective standardised interview on clinical outcome. This was a supplement to clinical investigation with endoscopy and consecutive documentation of complications and other factors affecting the patients’ health. Data were recorded in the medical chart. In this system, all patients had recorded dataset. However, the intervals between data recordings differ and the intervals increased by time. All inpatients data were included. Standard descriptive statistical analysis and simple associations were undertaken. Handling longitudinal data with limited cases, varying time intervals was done in a Times Series Cross Sectional data model, analysed, and adjusted for several factors affecting functional outcome. Multivariable analysis was done. Results The estimated failure rate at 20 years was 11. 4 % for ileal pouch-anal anastomosis and 11. 6 % for continent ileostomy. Salvage procedures rates were 31 % vs. 38 %, respectively (p= 0. 06). The salvage procedures in IPAA included local procedures and redoes with laparotomy. Salvage procedures in CI were related to the function of the <b>nipple</b> <b>valve,</b> mainly <b>nipple</b> <b>valve</b> sliding and less frequent stenosis or fistulas. Complications rates were high. In pelvic pouch surgery, half of the patients would need re-operations in 20 years. Ten percentages had early anastomotic separation without septic complications. Four percentages had early pelvic septic complications. Fistulas and sepsis at the anastomotic site were the main severe complications, often leading to pouch failure. Closing of the loop ileostomy was accompanied with complications in six percentages. In the patients (48) who did not have a covering stoma the overall complications rate did not differ from those with a loop ileostomy, although nine needed a secondary stoma. Covering stoma seems to postpone anastomotic complications. Handsewn anastomosis had more strictures, but otherwise the complications rates were similar to stapled anastomosis. Patients having the diagnosis changed to Crohn`s diseases had more complications and higher failure rate. Early anastomotic complications were associated with long-term complications. In patients with continent ileostomy the <b>nipple</b> <b>valve</b> sliding is the main cause of revision. One third needed revision once or several times. At 20 years follow-up, half of the patients would need surgery due to complications. Although many patients with CI need several revisions, all patients were continent at the last follow up with a stable intubation frequency of 3 – 5 per 24 hour. The failure of the pelvic pouch is the end of severe complications. Two third of the failures had the pouch excision or permanent ileostomy with the pouch in situ. One third underwent a conversion to CI, with equal surgical and functional outcome as other patients with CI. In IPAA, bowel movements at day were between 5 - 6 at day and 0 - 1 at night. The rates of more or less frequent incontinence were about 10 %, and 41 % and 55 % had reported soling at day and night respectively. The long-term functional outcome did not deteriorate with time: ie. observational time, as an independent factor did not influence outcome. Factors influencing the outcome were found but the impact of gender, age, protective stoma, hand-sewn anastomosis and early complications were negligible. Pouchitis did significantly influence functional outcome negatively, but did not create deterioration over time. Estimated pouchitis rate in IPAA was 43 % for more than 20 years. The onset of the first pouchitis appears mostly in the 5 - 6 first years after surgery. The crude rate was 35 % and 6 % of the patients had chronic pouchitis. Severe/chronic pouchitis was associated with primary sclerosing cholangitis, but not with pyoderma gangrenousum or diagnosed joint affections. Idiopathic pouchitis were absent among patients with familial adenomatous polyposis. In continent ileostomy the rate of pouchitis was 26 %. Conclusion The complications in both the pelvic pouch surgery and the surgery of continent ileostomy are considerable. Although not similar the surgical load are in the same order of magnitude. For the continent ileostomy revisional surgery are to be expected. The failure rate of both procedures are high and in long-term similar. The long-term functional outcome are however stabile and excellent. The failed pelvic pouch can be converted to a continent ileostomy in selected and motivated patients. The entity of pouchitis is conflicting and has to be divided into several different entities both on clinical, constitutional and other differentiating features. Patients with PSC should be informed of a possible higher risk of severe and chronic pouchitis after IPAA. Dr. philosDr. philo...|$|E
40|$|A {{consensus}} conference convened by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Societe Internationale d'Urologie (SIU) met to critically review reports of urinary diversion. The world literature on urinary diversion was identified through a Medline search. Evidence-based recommendations for urinary diversion were prepared {{with reference to}} a 4 -point scale. Many level 3 and 4 citations, but very few level 2 and no level 1, were noted. This outcome supported the clinical practice pattern. Findings of > 300 reviewed citations are Summarized. Published reports on urinary diversion rely heavily on expert opinion and single-institution retrospective case series: (1) The frequency distribution of urinary diversions performed by {{the authors of this}} report in > 7000 patients with cystectomy reflects the current status of urinary diversion after cystectomy for bladder cancer: ncobladder, 47 %; conduit, 33 %; anal diversion, 10 %; continent cutaneous diversion, 8 %; incontinent cutaneous diversion, 2 %; and others, 0. 1 %. (2) No randomized controlled studies have investigated quality of life (QOL) after radical cystectomy. Such studies are desirable but are probably difficult to conduct. Published evidence does not Support an advantage of one type of reconstruction over the others with regard to QOL.

(3) Simple end-to-side, freely refluxing ureterointestinal anastomosis to an afferent limb of a low-pressure orthotopic reconstruction, in combination with regular voiding and close follow-up, is the procedure that results in the lowest overall complication rate. The potential benefit of "conventional" antireflux procedures in combination with orthotopic reconstruction seems outweighed by the higher complication and reoperation rates. The need to prevent reflux in a continent cutaneous reservoir is not significantly debated, and this should be done.
