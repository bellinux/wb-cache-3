50|$|<b>NFC</b> <b>Tags</b> that do {{comply with}} NFC Forum Type 1 or Type 2 {{compatibility}} protocols {{are much more}} widely compatible than the MIFARE dependant Samsung TecTile, and are also widely available. Popular standards compliant <b>NFC</b> <b>Tags</b> are the NTAG213 (137 bytes of usable memory), and the Topaz 512 (480 bytes of usable memory).|$|R

5000|$|<b>NFC</b> <b>tags</b> are passive data stores {{which can}} be read, and under some {{circumstances}} written to, by an NFC device. They typically contain data ( [...] between 96 and 8,192 bytes) and are read-only in normal use, but may be rewritable. Applications include secure personal data storage (e.g. debit or credit card information, loyalty program data, personal identification numbers (PINs), contacts). <b>NFC</b> <b>tags</b> can be custom-encoded by their manufacturers or use the industry specifications.|$|R

50|$|Referring to the diagrams. An author obtains a signing {{certificate}} from a valid certificate authority. The author's {{private key}} {{is used to}} sign the Data Record (text, URI, or whatever you like). The signature and author's certificate comprise the signature record. The Data Record and Signature Record are concatenated to produce the Signed NDEF Message that can be written to a standard <b>NFC</b> <b>tag</b> with sufficient memory (typically {{on the order of}} 300 to 500 bytes). The NDEF record remains in the clear (not encrypted) so any <b>NFC</b> <b>tag</b> reader will be able to read the signed data even if they cannot verify it.|$|E
50|$|The Signature RTD 2.0 {{supports}} two certificate formats. One being X.509 certificate {{format and}} the other the Machine to Machine (M2M) Certificate format. The M2M Certificate format is a subset of X.509 designed for limited memory typically found on <b>NFC</b> <b>tags.</b> The author's certificate can optionally be replaced with a URI reference to that certificate or Certificate Chain so that messages can be cryptographically verified. The URI certificate reference designed to save memory for <b>NFC</b> <b>tags.</b>|$|R
50|$|Signing NDEF records {{prevents}} malicious use of <b>NFC</b> <b>tags</b> (containing {{a protected}} NDEF record). For example, smartphone users tapping <b>NFC</b> <b>tags</b> containing URLs. Without {{some level of}} integrity protection an adversary could launch a phishing attack. Signing the NDEF record protects {{the integrity of the}} contents and allows the user to identify the signer if they wish. Signing certificates are obtained from third party Certificate Authorities and are governed by the NFC Forum Signature RTD Certificate Policy.|$|R
50|$|Although <b>NFC</b> <b>Tags</b> can be {{used with}} many smartphones, TecTiles gained much {{prominence}} in late 2012 with the launch of the Galaxy SIII.|$|R
50|$|The Samsung TecTile <b>NFC</b> <b>tag</b> {{stickers}} use MIFARE Classic chips. This means only devices with an NXP NFC controller chip {{can read}} or write these tags. At the moment BlackBerry phones, the Nokia Lumia 610 (August 2012), the Google Nexus 4, Google Nexus 7 LTE and Nexus 10 (October 2013) can't read/write TecTile stickers.|$|E

The places can also be marked by a <b>NFC</b> <b>tag.</b> These stickers are called Munzees. Both the finding and the hiding players receive points for deploying and finding Munzees. The QR codes on the Munzees are read {{by means of a}} smartphone app for IOS, Android or Windows.|$|E

40|$|This thesis follows up a {{wireless}} technology called NFC, its {{support on the}} Android and its use in practice. It describes the design {{and implementation of the}} application, which is able to handle own <b>NFC</b> <b>tags,</b> including their creating, editing, erasing and interpretation. The real use of <b>NFC</b> <b>tags</b> consists in speed-up and automation of common tasks and actions, which we often do on Android-powered mobile device. It could be for example: changing of settings, changing of ring profile, controlling hardware, launching applications, initializing a call, sending messages and so on. ...|$|R
5000|$|This {{convoluted}} behaviour {{was chosen}} to make the App effectively self-installing for naive users. Why the App was not supplied as default is unknown. The downsides of this design choice though are that the URLs required to activate TecTile functions are relatively long, meaning that non-TecTile <b>NFC</b> <b>Tags</b> with limited memory size (137 bytes) cannot generally be used for functions other than web addresses. Additionally, {{the lack of a}} non-proprietary approach to these more capable functions limits the development of <b>NFC</b> <b>Tags</b> as a general technique across all such handsets, rather than just Samsung TecTiles.|$|R
50|$|Multiple {{models of}} Lockitron have been manufactured, {{including}} one that fits over the lock control mechanism {{on the inside of}} a door, and the door can then be unlocked via an app on the phone, or via web page control. Phones with Bluetooth Low Energy (4.0) can also automatically unlock a door when an authenticated device is nearby. A supplied <b>NFC</b> <b>tag</b> can be read to trigger a command to toggle the state of the lock.|$|E
5000|$|An AnandTech review {{praised the}} display, <b>NFC</b> <b>tag</b> reader, and Android Gingerbread {{operating}} system, but noted {{the lack of}} 720p video recording, HSPA+ baseband, and external storage support.A TechRadar review praised the Nexus S for fixing the GPS problems experienced with the Samsung Galaxy S: [...] "The good news for those looking to upgrade from the Samsung Galaxy S - the GPS issues have been resolved, in {{that you can actually}} now get a signal with no problem." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{parts that}} make up a Cardboard viewer are a piece of {{cardboard}} cut into a precise shape, 45 mm focal length lenses, magnets or capacitive tape, a hook and loop fastener (such as Velcro), a rubber band, and an optional near field communication (<b>NFC)</b> <b>tag.</b> Google provides extra recommendations for large scale manufacturing, and pre-assembled kits based on these plans are available for less than [...] from multiple vendors, who have also created a number of Cardboard variations.|$|E

50|$|NFC-equipped {{smartphones}} can be {{paired with}} <b>NFC</b> <b>Tags</b> or stickers {{that can be}} programmed by NFC apps. These programs can allow a change of phone settings, texting, app launching, or command execution.|$|R
5000|$|The {{need for}} the {{installed}} app {{is one of the}} drawbacks to TecTile and to NFC Tags in general. The basic <b>NFC</b> <b>Tag</b> standards support Tags carrying URLs, where the scheme or protocol (e.g. the [...] prefix) may be either [...] (for web addresses), [...] for telephony, or an anonymous [...] scheme. Although support for the [...] and [...] schemes may be assumed in a basic handset, support for the others will not be available unless an App has been installed and registered to handle them.|$|E
50|$|The Galaxy Gear uses an Android-based {{operating}} {{system with a}} minimalistic interface and gesture-based navigation. To pair the watch with a smartphone or tablet as its host device, the user must first install the Gear Manager app. An <b>NFC</b> <b>tag</b> located inside the charging case is used to download the app. Gear Manager uses Bluetooth to coordinate the pairing process and further communication with the device. It {{can also be used}} to configure the device's settings (such as the clock display's color and appearance), and to manage and install apps via Samsung Apps.|$|E
50|$|The Signature RTD 2.0's {{primary purpose}} is the protect the {{integrity}} and authenticity of NDEF records. Thus <b>NFC</b> <b>tag</b> contents using the Signature RTD 2.0 is protected. The security {{of the system is}} tied to a certificate authority and the associated Certificate Chain. The NFC Forum Signature RTD Certificate Policy defines the policies under which certificate authorities can operate in the context of NFC. Root certificates are carried in verification devices and are not contained in the signature record. This separation is important for the security of the system just as web browser certificates are separated from web server certificates in TLS.|$|E
50|$|On September 9, 2014, Apple {{announced}} {{support for}} NFC-powered transactions {{as part of}} Apple Pay. With the introduction of iOS 11, Apple devices allow third-party developers to read data from <b>NFC</b> <b>tags.</b>|$|R

50|$|The NFC Forum {{published}} the Signature Record Type Definition (RTD) 2.0 in 2015 to add integrity and authenticity for <b>NFC</b> <b>Tags.</b> This specification allows an NFC device to verify tag data {{and identify the}} tag author.|$|R
