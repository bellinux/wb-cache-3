40|$|Abstract. On-line {{nondestructive}} {{estimation of}} fruit internal quality greatly benefits the consumer and the fruit {{industry as a}} whole because it can ensure the safety and processed product consistency. This research was aimed to build prediction model of soluble solids content (SSC) in <b>navel</b> <b>oranges</b> using ultraviolet lamp induced fluorescence technique. Total 254 <b>navel</b> <b>oranges</b> were separated into the calibration set (170 samples) and prediction set (84 samples). The actual SSC of <b>navel</b> <b>oranges</b> were measured using a digital refratometer. A characteristic wavelength range (385 - 414 nm) was found to build a partial least squares (PLS) model for predicting the SSC in <b>navel</b> <b>oranges.</b> The correlation coefficient (r) between the predicted and actual SSC was 0. 9161 and 0. 8295 for calibration and prediction set, respectively. The root mean square error of calibration (RMSEC) and prediction (RMSEP) set was 1. 0797 and 1. 4283, respectively. The results showed that fluorescence spectrum can nondestructively determine SSC in fruit...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The flavor {{quality of}} citrus fruits is largely {{determined}} by the sugar-acid ratio, but it remains uncertain how sugar- and/or acid-metabolizing enzymes regulate the sugar-acid ratio of <b>navel</b> <b>oranges</b> and further affect the fruit quality. In the present study, Robertson <b>navel</b> <b>oranges</b> (Citrus sinesis Osb.) were collected from six representative habitats in three eco-regions of Sichuan, China. The changes in the sugar-acid ratio and the activities of sucrose phosphate synthase (SPS), sucrose synthase (SS), cytosolic cio-aconitase (ACO), and isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) were examined in <b>navel</b> <b>oranges</b> during fruit development. The {{results indicated that the}} sugar-acid ratio of fruits in different eco-regions changed significantly from 150 days after full bloom. The SPS and cytosolic ACO fruit activities had minor changes among different ecoregions throughout the experimental periods, whereas the activities of SS and IDH changed significantly in fruits among three eco-regions. Furthermore, the sugar-acid ratio and the activities of SS in the synthetic direction and IDH were the highest in south subtropics and the lowest in north mid-subtropics, probably due to the effects of climate conditions and/or other relevant eco-factors. It demonstrated that SS in the synthetic direction and IDH were of greater importance in regulating the sugar-acid ratio of <b>navel</b> <b>oranges</b> in different eco-regions, which provided new insights into the factors that determine the flavor quality of <b>navel</b> <b>oranges</b> and valuable data for guiding relevant agricultural practices...|$|R

2500|$|Cara cara oranges (also called [...] "red navel") are {{a type of}} <b>navel</b> <b>orange</b> grown {{mainly in}} Venezuela, South Africa and in California's San Joaquin Valley.

2500|$|According to a 1917 {{study by}} Palemon Dorsett, Archibald Dixon Shamel and Wilson Popenoe of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), a single {{mutation}} in a Selecta orange tree {{planted on the}} grounds of a monastery near Bahia, Brazil, probably yielded the first <b>navel</b> <b>orange</b> between 1810 and 1820. Nevertheless, a researcher at the University of California, Riverside, has suggested that the parent variety was more likely the Portuguese <b>navel</b> <b>orange</b> (Umbigo), described by Antoine Risso and Pierre Antoine Poiteau in their book Histoire naturelle des orangers ("Natural History of Orange Trees", 1818–1822). The mutation caused the orange to develop a second fruit at its base, opposite the stem, embedded within the peel of the primary orange. Navel oranges were introduced in Australia in 1824 and in Florida in 1835. In 1870, twelve cuttings of the original tree were transplanted to Riverside, California, where the fruit became known as [...] "Washington". This cultivar was very successful, and rapidly spread to other countries. Because the mutation left the fruit seedless and, therefore, sterile, the only method to cultivate navel oranges was to graft cuttings onto other varieties of citrus trees. The California Citrus State Historic Park and the Orcutt Ranch Horticulture Center preserve the history of navel oranges in Riverside.|$|E

25|$|Today, <b>navel</b> <b>oranges</b> {{continue}} to be propagated through cutting and grafting. This {{does not allow for}} the usual selective breeding methodologies, and so all <b>navel</b> <b>oranges</b> can be considered fruits from that single, nearly two-hundred-year-old tree: they have exactly the same genetic make-up as the original tree and are, therefore, clones.

[...] The two other main orange varieties cultivated in the region are the <b>navel</b> <b>orange</b> and the bitter orange; the latter is grown in Iran for its peel. The 'Jaffa' orange is distinguished by its oval shape and thick peel, which is deep orange in color and normally very easy to remove from the fruit.

As it produces very little juice and has a tendency towards delayed bitterness, it is unsuitable for juice production, although it does store well.|$|E
2500|$|The Southern California [...] "citrus belt" [...] first {{emerged in}} the 1870s, and within two decades {{stretched}} eastward from Pasadena to Redlands beneath {{the foothills of the}} San Gabriel and San Bernardino mountains. It originated from experimental <b>navel</b> <b>orange</b> plantings first conducted in Riverside, from cuttings introduced from Brazil. John Henry Reed, a retired school superintendent and dry goods merchant from Ohio turned citrus grower, is credited with first proposing the establishment of a scientific experiment station specifically for citrus research in Southern California, and organized a vigorous lobbying effort of the local citrus industry towards that end. As founding member and chair of the Riverside Horticultural Club's experimental committee, he also pioneered a collaborative approach to conducting experimental plantings, and published more than 150 semitechnical and popular papers on citrus and other subjects between 1895 and 1915.|$|E

During the 1930s and 1940s, labor activists campaigned in the canneries and packing houses for union representation and higher wages. [...] The United Cannery, Agricultural, Packing, and Allied Workers of America (UCAPAWA) won 13 National Labor Relations Board representation elections in the Riverside-Redlands area in 1943.

2500|$|<b>Navel</b> <b>oranges</b> are {{characterized}} by {{the growth of a}} second fruit at the apex, which protrudes slightly and resembles a human navel.
