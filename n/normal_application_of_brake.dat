40|$|Vacuum brakes {{are first}} used in place <b>of</b> the air <b>brake</b> in railway locomotives. This braking system uses a vacuum pump for {{creating}} vacuum in the brake pipe.

The vacuum braking system was modified from above said reasons and the same was tested for implementation in both light and heavy vehicles. In this work, vacuum is created and used for the <b>application</b> <b>of</b> <b>brakes.</b> The system operation is somehow similar to air braking system. The main difference with air brake system is that vacuum is used instead of compressed air.

2500|$|Electro-pneumatic or EP brakes are a type <b>of</b> air <b>brake</b> {{that allows}} for {{immediate}} <b>application</b> <b>of</b> <b>brakes</b> throughout the train instead <b>of</b> the sequential <b>application.</b> EP brakes have been in British practice since 1949 and also used in German high-speed trains (most notably the ICE) since the late 1980s, they are fully described in Electro-pneumatic brake system on British railway trains.

50|$|A {{freewheel}} {{also produces}} slightly better fuel economy on carbureted engines (without fuel turn-off on engine brake) and less wear on the manual clutch, but {{leads to more}} wear on the brakes {{as there is no}} longer any ability to perform engine braking.

50|$|The broken rod was {{replaced}} with a new rod and loading conditions were applied. Four strain gauges were attached {{at a distance of}} 533 mm from the lower end, located 90 degrees apart around the circumference of the rod. Readings were taken during manual release and <b>application</b> <b>of</b> the <b>brake</b> and during emergency <b>application</b> <b>of</b> <b>brake.</b> The results showed that in addition to the expected direct tensile stresses at gauge positions there were substantial stresses due to bending when the brake was operated. The magnitude of stresses varied {{to such an extent that}} for the one farthest from the drum there was a change from tension to compression as the brake was released. The rod was not designed for such alternating bending loads. The rod was designed with a factor of safety 6.1 for tensile stress. But when alternative bending stress are induced, failure was inevitable.|$|R
50|$|The Cineston {{controller}} is {{a control}} lever used in mass transit vehicles that combines the accelerator, brake and emergency controls {{into a single}} hand-operated device. The Cineston controller allows smooth operation of the vehicle, avoids the <b>application</b> <b>of</b> <b>brake</b> and throttle at the same time, and provides a clear visual indication of the current power setting.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new model-based {{hierarchical}} control {{strategy for the}} <b>application</b> <b>of</b> <b>brake</b> torque distribution to vehicle stability control.

To achieve this a non-linear vehicle model is linearised at successive time instants about non-equilibrium operating points. Simulations show that the new controller is more efficient (uses reduced brake authority) compared to a conventional rule-based control algorithm. It also has the advantage of being highly flexible for future application in fully integrated chassis systems. Copyright Â© 2007 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd...|$|R

25|$|The main disadvantage, {{like the}} clutch braking system, is that {{steering}} dissipates heat through the brakes.

A 14 -degree-of-freedom vehicle model, a sliding-mode antilock brake system (ABS) controller, and a driver model were also employed to test the controllers. The {{results show that the}} three AFS controllers allowed the yaw rate to follow the reference yaw rate very well, and consequently the lateral stability improved.

50|$|In {{off-road}} vehicles: Traction {{control is}} used instead of, or in addition to, the mechanical limited slip or locking differential. It is often implemented with an electronic limited slip differential, {{as well as other}} computerized controls of the engine and transmission. The spinning wheel is slowed down with short <b>applications</b> <b>of</b> <b>brakes,</b> diverting more torque to the non-spinning wheel; this is the system adopted by Range Rover in 1993, for example. ABS brake traction control has several advantages over limited-slip and locking differentials, such as steering control of a vehicle is easier, so the system can be continuously enabled. It also creates less stress on powertrain and driveline components, and increases durability as there are fewer moving parts to fail.|$|R
