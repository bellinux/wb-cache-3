5|$|The {{equivalence}} between gravitational and {{inertial effects}} {{does not constitute}} a complete theory of gravity. When it comes to explaining gravity <b>near</b> <b>our</b> own location on the Earth's surface, noting that our reference frame is not in free fall, so that fictitious forces are to be expected, provides a suitable explanation. But a freely falling reference frame {{on one side of}} the Earth cannot explain why the people on the opposite side of the Earth experience a gravitational pull in the opposite direction.|$|E

2500|$|The {{casualties}} {{among the}} colonists were few. John Winthrop was quoted saying, [...] " [...] {{coming up behind}} the bushes very <b>near</b> <b>our</b> men... shot many arrows into their hats, sleeves and stocks, yet (which was a very miracle) not one of ours was wounded." [...] Mason's account supported this, saying that [...] "several were found slain," [...] a reference to them being injured.|$|E

Grose states mote hills, or places for administration of public justice, for considerable districts; and courts hills, whereon the ancient lairds held their baronial courts, before the demolition of the feudal system. These mote and court hills serve to explain the use of these high mounts still remaining <b>near</b> <b>our</b> ancient castles. He goes on to say – ...|$|E
2500|$|In July 2008, Russia {{announced}} {{that if a}} U.S. anti-missile shield was deployed near the Russian border, {{it would have to}} react militarily. The statement from the Russian foreign ministry said, [...] "If an American strategic anti-missile shield starts to be deployed <b>near</b> <b>our</b> borders, we will be forced to react not in a diplomatic fashion but with military-technical means." [...] Later, Russia's ambassador to the United Nations Vitaly Churkin said that [...] "military-technical means" [...] did not mean military action, but more likely a change in Russia's strategic posture, perhaps by redeploying its own missiles.|$|E

Austere freethinkers with an intense {{hatred of the}} ruling National Fascist Party, Eva and Mario also refused to give their sons any education in the Catholic Faith or any other religion. Italo attended the English nursery school St George's College, followed by a Protestant elementary private school run by Waldensians. His secondary schooling, with a classical lyceum curriculum, was completed at the state-run Liceo Gian Domenico Cassini where, at his parents' request, he was exempted from religion classes but frequently asked to justify his anti-conformism to teachers, janitors, and fellow pupils. In his mature years, Calvino described the experience as having made him [...] "tolerant of others' opinions, particularly {{in the field of}} religion, remembering how irksome it was to hear myself mocked because I did not follow the majority's beliefs". In 1938, Eugenio Scalfari, who went on to found the weekly magazine L'Espresso and La Repubblica, a major Italian newspaper, came from Civitavecchia to join the same class though a year younger, and they shared the same desk. The two teenagers formed a lasting friendship, Calvino attributing his political awakening to their university discussions. Seated together [...] "on a huge flat stone {{in the middle of a}} stream <b>near</b> <b>our</b> land", he and Scalfari founded the MUL (University Liberal Movement).|$|E
2500|$|... "Toward evening a {{party of}} hangmen arrived. The {{officers}} went in and informed the condemned men {{they were to be}} executed between four and five in the morning. Their reply was to sing [...] "Hatikvah" [...] and other songs in powerful voices. They then shouted to us that the hangings would begin at four o'clock, in this order: Avshalom Haviv, Meir Nakar, Yaakov Weiss. They added: 'Avenge our blood! Avenge our blood!' We shouted back, 'Be strong! We are with you, and thousands of Jewish youth are with you in spirit.' They replied, 'Thanks,' and went on singing. At two a Sephardi rabbi whom we could not recognize from afar [...] was brought and stayed in the cell 15 minutes. At four in the morning Avshalom began singing [...] "Hatikva," [...] and we joined in loudly, pressing against the bars. At once armed police came up to the visitors' fence <b>near</b> <b>our</b> cell. At 4:03 Avshalom was hanged. At 4:25 we were shaken by the powerful singing of Meir. Hardly able to breathe, we nevertheless joined in. He was hanged at 4:28. At five o'clock the voice of Yaakov, this time alone, penetrated our cell, singing [...] "Hatikva." [...] Again we joined in. Two minutes later he was hanged.... At dawn we informed the prison officers through an Arab warder that we would not be responsible for the life of any Englishman who dared enter the jail yard. We declared a fast and prayed. Later in the morning we found the following inscription {{on the wall of the}} cell of the condemned: 'They will not frighten the Hebrew youth in the Homeland with their hangings. Thousands will follow in our footsteps.' Next to it was the Irgun insignia and their three names in the order they were executed." ...|$|E
