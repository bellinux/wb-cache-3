Though she was now reunited with Marie and Pauline, {{from the first day}} she began her {{struggle}} to win and keep her distance from her sisters. Right at the start Marie de Gonzague, the prioress, had turned the postulant Thérèse over to her eldest sister Marie, who was to teach her to follow the Divine Office. Later she appointed Thérèse assistant to Pauline in the refectory. And when her cousin Marie Guerin also entered, she employed the two together in the sacristy.|$|E

500|$|Celia Larkin, {{writing on}} 12 February 2012 in the Irish Sunday Independent, said [...] "There was {{something}} very satisfying about Heather Mills finally having her voice heard above {{the roar of the}} Red Tops. If you actually take the time to listen to Mills, I mean listen, not just read what's written about her, you'll see she is a strong, sincere, independent woman. She didn't lie down under the weight of McCartney's fame and wealth, she continued to plough her own furrow, campaigning for her charities, maintaining a strong individuality. And that, it seems, is the greatest sin of all. Is it any wonder she was reduced to tears in the October 2007 GMTV interview? Did we feel sympathy for her then? No. 'Heather Mills has Melt Down' screamed the headlines, so <b>now</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> lost her marbles to boot. And if that wasn't enough, Carole Malone of the Sunday Mirror, one of the papers that was relentless in its attacks on Mills, accused her of staging an act on live TV in order to further her cause in the upcoming divorce hearing. How cruel can you get?" ...|$|E
500|$|Capper had not died {{immediately}} as her murderers believed, {{and after}} they left she managed to scramble back up the embankment and stagger along the lane for approximately {{a quarter of a}} mile (400 m) to Compstall Road before being found at 06:10 by Barry Sutcliffe and two of his colleagues on their way to work. She told them: [...] "Over there, in the field. They burnt me, they put petrol on me." [...] They immediately took her to a nearby house and roused the residents, Michael and Margaret Coop, to call for an ambulance. Michael Coop said: [...] "Both her hands appeared like ash. Her legs were just like raw meat and her feet appeared to be badly charred. I was struck by how polite the victim was. She was constantly thanking my wife for her assistance." [...] Margaret Coop said: [...] "I instinctively went to put my arms around her but she pulled away because she could not bear to be touched. Her head was shaved and there were recent, not new, cuts to her head. Her face was almost featureless. Her hands were red raw and black at the fingertips. Her legs were red from top to bottom. She couldn't bear anything near her legs." [...] Capper drank six glasses of water, but was unable to hold the glass herself because of the injuries to her hands. Margaret Coop said: [...] "She looked like the victim of an attack in the Vietnam war. But I felt she would survive. I had this theory that, <b>now</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> got to somewhere she could be helped, she would live." [...] Capper was rushed to the hospital and was able to give the names of her six assailants and Powell's address before falling into a coma. The extent of her burns was such that her mother and stepfather were unable to recognise her, and she was positively identified by a partial fingerprint from her thumb, the only part of her hands not severely burned. She died on 18 December 1992, without regaining consciousness.|$|E

2500|$|Among ancient writers Julia {{is almost}} universally remembered for her {{flagrant}} and promiscuous conduct. Thus Marcus Velleius Paterculus (2.100) describes her as [...] "tainted by luxury or lust", listing among her lovers Iullus Antonius, Quintius Crispinus, Appius Claudius, Sempronius Gracchus, and Cornelius Scipio. Seneca the Younger refers to [...] "adulterers admitted in droves"; Pliny the Elder calls her an “exemplum licentiae” (NH 21.9). Dio Cassius mentions [...] "revels and drinking parties by {{night in the}} Forum and even upon the Rostra" [...] (Roman History 55.10). Seneca (De Beneficiis 6.32) {{tells us that the}} Rostra was the place where [...] "her father had proposed a law against adultery", and yet <b>now</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> chosen the place for her [...] "debaucheries". Seneca specifically mentions prostitution: [...] "laying aside the role of adulteress, she there [...] sold her favours, and sought the right to every indulgence with even an unknown paramour." [...] Modern historians discredit these representations as exaggerating Julia's behaviour.|$|E
2500|$|While Clinton {{recognized}} some of {{the contradictions}} of U.S. policy towards turmoil in the Mideast countries, which involving backing some regimes while supporting protesters against others, she was nevertheless passionate on the subject, enough so that Obama joked at the annual Gridiron Dinner that [...] "I've dispatched Hillary to the Middle East {{to talk about how}} these countries can transition to new leaders—though, I've got to be honest, she's gotten a little passionate about the subject. These past few weeks it's been tough falling asleep with Hillary out there on Pennsylvania Avenue shouting, throwing rocks at the window." [...] In any case, Obama's reference to Clinton travelling a lot was true enough; by <b>now</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> logged [...] in her Boeing 757, more than any other Secretary of State for a comparable period of time, and had visited 79 countries while in the office. Time magazine wrote that [...] "Clinton's endurance is legendary" [...] and that she would still be going at the end of long work days even as her staff members were glazing out. The key was her ability to fall asleep on demand, at any time and place, for power naps.|$|E
2500|$|She had {{understood}} {{that she had}} to pray and give her life for sinners like Pranzini. But Carmel prayed especially for priests and this had surprised her since their souls seemed to her to be [...] "as pure as crystal". A month spent with many priests taught her that they are [...] "weak and feeble men". [...] She wrote later: [...] "I met many saintly priests that month, but I also found that in spite of being above angels by their supreme dignity, they were none the less men and still subject to human weakness. If the holy priests, 'the salt of the earth', as Jesus calls them in the Gospel, have to be prayed for, what about the lukewarm? Again, as Jesus says, 'If the salt shall lose its savour, wherewith shall it be salted?' I understood my vocation in Italy." [...] For the first time too she had associated with young men. [...] "In her brotherless existence, masculinity had been represented only by her father, her Uncle Guérin and various priests. <b>Now</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> her first and only experiences. Céline declared at the beatification proceedings that one of the young men in the pilgrimage group [...] "developed a tender affection for her". Thérèse confessed to her sister, [...] "It is high time for Jesus to remove me from the poisonous breath of the world...I feel that my heart is easily caught by tenderness, and where others fall, I would fall too. We are no stronger than the others." [...] Soon after that, the Bishop of Bayeux authorized the prioress to receive Thérèse. On 9 April 1888 she became a Carmelite postulant.|$|E

2500|$|The year 1840 {{marked a}} turning point in her career, however. In 1838, Droste had begun to {{frequent}} a literary salon in Münster, presided over by Elise Rüdiger, the [...] "Hecken-Schriftstellergesellschaft." [...] One of its members was the young poet Levin Schücking. Schücking had published an admiring review of Droste's collection and sought her help in writing his own book, Das malerische und romantische Westfalen ("Picturesque and Romantic Westphalia", 1840). The two soon formed a close friendship and Droste wrote a number of ballads for inclusion in the book, among them [...] "Das Fräulein von Rodenschild" [...] and [...] "Der Tod des Erzbischofs Engelbert von Köln". Schücking encouraged her renewed literary creativity. In the winter of 1840—1841 she wrote her famous novella Die Judenbuche (The Jew's Beech, published 1842), based on an incident which had occurred near Bökerhof in the late 18th century. The following autumn and winter, Droste and Schücking stayed at her brother-in-law's castle at Meersburg on Lake Constance, where Schücking had been given the task of cataloguing Laßberg's book collection. Here Schücking told her that her talent lay in lyric poetry, which relied on rare moments of inspiration. Droste disagreed: she had no problem composing poetry in her head but had difficulty writing it down and the failure of her first book had not encouraged her to make the effort. <b>Now</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> a sympathetic reader in Schücking, she began to write in earnest, producing about fifty poems between October 1841 and April 1842. They include poems dedicated to Schücking, often on the theme of ageing (e.g. [...] "Kein Wort", [...] "O frage nicht"), and poems of self-analysis such as [...] "Das Spiegelbild" [...] ("The Image in the Mirror") and [...] "Die Taxuswand" [...] ("The Yew Hedge"), which looks back to her unhappy love affair with Straube. Other lyrics are the nature poems collected in the cycle [...] "Heidebilder" [...] ("Heath Pictures"), including such famous pieces as [...] "Die Krähen" [...] ("The Crows"), [...] "Der Hünenstein", [...] "Die Mergelgrube" [...] ("The Marl Pit") and [...] "Der Knabe im Moor" [...] ("The Boy on the Moor"). These often have an element of supernatural terror.|$|E
