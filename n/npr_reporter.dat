The Panthers improved to [...] in the 2003 regular season, winning the NFC South and making it to Super Bowl XXXVIII before losing to the New England Patriots 32–29 in what was immediately hailed by sportswriter Peter King as the [...] "Greatest Super Bowl of all time". King felt the game [...] "was a wonderful championship battle, full of everything that makes football dramatic, draining, enervating, maddening, fantastic, exciting" [...] and praised, among other things, the unpredictability, coaching, and conclusion.

5000|$|McAvoy, who {{accepted}} the role in 2011, {{said that he}} almost turned down the part, while reading the script, because Simon {{seemed to be a}} victim, which didn't interest him.

5000|$|Some {{observers}} have questioned whether NPR actually fired Williams {{for making the}} comments on Fox News, as opposed to making them in another forum. William Saletan of Slate.com compared the Williams situation to that of Shirley Sherrod, saying that both Sherrod and Williams had their words {{taken out of context}} {{in a way that made}} them appear racist and led to the loss of their jobs, except that Williams was victimized by liberals, rather than conservatives as in Sherrod's case. [...] Saletan said that while Williams' confessed fears of Muslims were [...] "unsettling", the context was Williams' argument that such fears should not be used to curtail the rights of Muslims or anyone else, and that Williams consistently argued that Muslims in general should not be blamed for the terrorist activities of Muslim extremists. [...] NPR has been criticized by Williams and others for practicing a double standard in the firing, compared to their not firing Cokie Roberts, Nina Totenberg and other <b>NPR</b> <b>reporters</b> and analysts for their opinionated statements.|$|R

50|$|On the {{afternoon}} of May 22, 2013, law enforcement officers, including FBI special agent Aaron McFarlane from the Boston field office and two Massachusetts State Police (MSP) troopers, Curtis Cinelli and Joel Gagne, arrived at Ibragim Todashev's apartment in Orlando, Florida, and interviewed Todashev for approximately eight hours in his living room. <b>NPR</b> <b>reporter</b> Susan Zalkind stated that Todashev's friend Khusen Taramov waited outside Todashev's apartment during the interrogation, and was told to leave an hour before Todashev was shot. According to Todashev's father, Abdulbaki, the questioning took place two days before his scheduled flight to Russia; Abdulbaki's American attorney Eric Ludin said Ibragim Todashev had undergone multiple prior interrogations in Florida and was promised {{this would be the}} last one, and had canceled a planned trip to Chechnya earlier in May on the advice of the FBI. Todashev was questioned by the FBI agent regarding the 2011 Waltham murders and his connections to the Boston bombings suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev; both Todashev and Tsarnaev had trained at the Wai Kru MMA Gym and lived close to each other in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The investigators later said that Todashev implicated both himself and Tamerlan Tsarnaev in the murders during the questioning soon after midnight. They reported that Todashev was beginning to write a formal statement when he asked to take a break, and then suddenly attacked the agent. Todashev was shot multiple times and killed.|$|E
40|$|This year’s Nobel Prize in Chemistry celebrates a {{multitude}} of research areas, making the difficult selection of those most responsible for providing atomic details of the nanomachine that makes proteins according to genetic instructions. The Ribosome and RNA polymerase (recognized in 2006) structures highlight a puzzling asymmetry at the origins of biology. I initially wrote this piece {{in response to a}} college classmate who, knowing something about my profession, asked if I knew any of the winners, and what he should make of the 2009 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.

Much of science is being {{in the right place at}} the right time, and it is only natural that I spend a reasonable amount of time reflecting on work that I truly admire and wish I could have participated in.

50|$|In May 2009, the U.S. National Public Radio (NPR) aired {{multiple}} reports {{alleging that}} the Mexican federal police and military were working in collusion with the Sinaloa Cartel. In particular, the report claimed the government was helping the Sinaloa Cartel {{to take control of}} the Juarez Valley area and destroy other cartels, especially the Juarez Cartel. <b>NPR's</b> <b>reporters</b> interviewed dozens of officials and ordinary people for the journalistic investigation. One report quotes a former Juarez police commander who claimed the entire department was working for the Sinaloa Cartel and helping it to fight other groups. He also claimed that the Sinaloa Cartel had bribed the military. Also quoted was a Mexican reporter who claimed hearing numerous times from the public that the military had been involved in murders. Another source in the story was the U.S. trial of Manuel Fierro-Mendez, an ex-Juarez police captain who admitted to working for the Sinaloa Cartel. He claimed that the Sinaloa Cartel influenced the Mexican government and military in order to gain control of the region. A U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agent in the same trial alleged that Fierro-Mendez had contacts with a Mexican military officer. The report also alleged, with support from an anthropologist who studies drug trafficking, that data on the low arrest rate of Sinaloa Cartel members (compared to other groups) was evidence of favoritism on the part of the authorities. A Mexican official denied the allegation of favoritism, and a DEA agent and a political scientist also had alternate explanations for the arrest data. Another report detailed numerous indications of corruption and influence that the cartel has within the Mexican government.|$|R
50|$|Adler joined NPR in 1979 as {{a general}} {{assignment}} reporter, after spending a year as an <b>NPR</b> freelance <b>reporter</b> covering New York City, and subsequently worked on a great many pieces dealing with subjects {{as diverse as the}} death penalty, the right to die movement, the response to the war in Kosovo, computer gaming, the drug ecstasy, geek culture, children and technology and Pokémon. Since 9/11, she focused much of her work on stories exploring the human factors in New York City, from the loss of loved ones, homes and jobs, to work in the relief effort. She was the host of Justice Talking up until the show ceased production on July 3, 2008. She was a regular voice on Morning Edition and All Things Considered.

40|$|A year ago, we were {{glued to}} our {{televisions}} and computers, {{like so many}} others in China and around the world, watching a tragedy unfold in Sichuan. The news we saw from the earthquake zone was bleak and heartbreaking. Several news sites have run memorials, one-year on, and we’ve selected a few of those in the reader below. We also point you to some of the coverage we ran atChina Beat in the days that followed. 1. One of the things Kathryn Edgerton-Tarpley stressed in a piece for China Beat last May was that Chinese volunteerism was not a brand-new phenomenon, instead linking to a strain in the late Qing. The volunteer spirit that has emerged in response to the earthquake, however, has continued to draw attention, as inthis piece at the Christian Science Monitor. 2. China has officially expressed its “gratitude” for international aid, a situation many were tracking a year ago. 3. Richard Kraus noted the historical resonances of the efforts to preserve “Grandpa” Wen’s calligraphy in Sichuan. Wen Jiabao’s written words have continued {{to be a source of}} interest, as shown by this piece about Wen sending handwritten notes to earthquake survivors. 4. The Chinese Red Cross has continued to be an important source of aid to survivors, as discussed in this piece from the Telegraph. In a two-part piece last year, Caroline Reeves wrote about the history of the Chinese Red Cross (part 1,part 2). 5. Some of you may remember that <b>NPR</b> <b>reporters</b> Melissa Block and Robert Siegel were coincidentally in Sichuan when the earthquake struck. NPR has been providing in-depth one-year coverage of the earthquake, including this piece on the sensitive topic of children who died in their classrooms. In a piece last spring, Peter Hessler relayed correspondence with his former students—about whom he wrote in River Town—immediately after the earthquake, many discussing the events at their local schools. We ran a few other pieces at CB one year ago that readers may continue to find interesting (if you didn’t read them the first time around) : Susan Brownell’s consideration of the Tangshan earthquake and the Montreal Olympics, Steve Smith’s investigation of the role rumor played in the Sichuan earthquake, and Don Sutton’s piece on the mourning rituals after the earthquake...|$|R

When NPR's Flatow asked both Lorden and Dr. Keith Devlin, <b>NPR's</b> mathematics <b>reporter,</b> about the title, both men denied creating the title; Devlin believed that executive producer Tony Scott originated the title. Lorden stated that he initially thought that the title was [...] "kind of hokey" [...] but later saw it as [...] "brilliant" [...] and a [...] "catchy logo". [...] Jonathan Storm of The Philadelphia Inquirer, in his review of the series stated, [...] "You'd think CBS's new Numbers, which premieres at 10 tonight after the Patriots-Steelers football game, is just {{another one of those}} shows with numskull titles trying to draw attention to themselves. But the [...] "3" [...] substituting for the [...] "e" [...] is actually based on a real thing"…. He later said that the show was [...] "written by people familiar with the Dead Cow Cult". [...] David Brooks of The Telegraph (Nashua, NH) devoted the majority of his entire review to the use of leet in the series title. [...] In addition, three psychologists, Manuel Perea, Jon Andoni Duñabeitia, and Manuel Carreiras mentioned the television series in their 2008 article for the American Psychological Association's Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance.|$|R
