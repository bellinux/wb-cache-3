5|$|Around 2 {{million tonnes}} of <b>nickel</b> are {{produced}} annually worldwide. The Philippines, Indonesia, Russia, Canada and Australia are the world's largest producers of <b>nickel,</b> {{as reported by}} the US Geological Survey. The largest deposits of <b>nickel</b> in non-Russian Europe are located in Finland and Greece. Identified land-based resources averaging 1% <b>nickel</b> or greater contain at least 130 million tons of <b>nickel.</b> About 60% is in laterites and 40% is in sulfide deposits. In addition, extensive deep-sea resources of <b>nickel</b> are in manganese crusts and nodules covering large areas of the ocean floor, particularly in the Pacific Ocean.|$|E
5|$|Originally, {{the only}} source for <b>nickel</b> was the rare Kupfernickel. Beginning in 1824, <b>nickel</b> was {{obtained}} as a byproduct of cobalt blue production. The first large-scale smelting of <b>nickel</b> began in Norway in 1848 from nickel-rich pyrrhotite. The introduction of <b>nickel</b> in steel production in 1889 increased the demand for <b>nickel,</b> and the <b>nickel</b> deposits of New Caledonia, discovered in 1865, provided most of the world's supply between 1875 and 1915. The discovery of the large deposits in the Sudbury Basin, Canada in 1883, in Norilsk-Talnakh, Russia in 1920, and in the Merensky Reef, South Africa in 1924, made large-scale production of <b>nickel</b> possible.|$|E

50|$|About 100,000 (and {{possibly}} {{as many as}} 200,000) classic hobo <b>nickels</b> were created from 1913 to 1980. Modern artists have created (and continue to create) altered <b>nickels</b> in such large quantities that, {{within the next few}} years, the number of modern carvings is expected to surpass that of classic old hobo <b>nickels.</b> Most of the 100,000-plus classic old hobo <b>nickels</b> are not yet in the hands of collectors, whereas almost all modern carvings are. Among numismatists, the modern carvings already greatly outnumber the classic old hobo <b>nickels.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{major source}} of <b>nickel</b> {{exposure}} is oral consumption, as <b>nickel</b> is essential to plants. <b>Nickel</b> is found naturally in both food and water, and may be increased by human pollution. For example, nickel-plated faucets may contaminate water and soil; mining and smelting may dump <b>nickel</b> into waste-water; nickel–steel alloy cookware and nickel-pigmented dishes may release <b>nickel</b> into food. The atmosphere may be polluted by <b>nickel</b> ore refining and fossil fuel combustion. Humans may absorb <b>nickel</b> directly from tobacco smoke and skin contact with jewelry, shampoos, detergents, and coins. A less-common form of chronic exposure is through hemodialysis as traces of <b>nickel</b> ions may be absorbed into the plasma from the chelating action of albumin.|$|E
5|$|As of September 19, 2013, {{the melt}} {{value of a}} U.S. <b>nickel</b> (copper and <b>nickel</b> included) is $0.045, which is 90% of the face value.|$|E
5|$|Dietary <b>nickel</b> {{may affect}} human health through infections by nickel-dependent bacteria, {{but it is}} also {{possible}} that <b>nickel</b> is an essential nutrient for bacteria residing in the large intestine, in effect functioning as a prebiotic. The U.S. Institute of Medicine has not confirmed that <b>nickel</b> is an essential nutrient for humans, so neither a Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) nor an Adequate Intake have been established. The Tolerable Upper Intake Level of dietary <b>nickel</b> is 1000µg/day as soluble <b>nickel</b> salts. Dietary intake is estimated at 70 to 100 µg/day, with less than 10% absorbed. What is absorbed is excreted in urine. Relatively large amounts of <b>nickel</b> – comparable to the estimated average ingestion above – leach into food cooked in stainless steel. For example, the amount of <b>nickel</b> leached after 10 cooking cycles into one serving of tomato sauce averages 88µg.|$|E
5|$|Few <b>nickels</b> had {{circulated}} {{in the western}} states before the 1880s (people there preferred silver and gold coins); interest in the new Liberty Head design had led to increasing use of <b>nickels</b> there. Good economic conditions and high demand for <b>nickels</b> for use in coin-operated devices caused the piece to circulate throughout the nation by 1900. That year, Mint Director George E. Roberts called on Congress to quintuple the Mint's appropriation to purchase base metals for striking into <b>nickels</b> and cents. At the time, statutory restrictions permitted production of cents and <b>nickels</b> only at Philadelphia; Roberts' request that Congress allow striking at the other mints was granted in 1906. The Denver and San Francisco Mints began striking <b>nickels</b> in 1912.|$|R
50|$|Many artists made hobo <b>nickels</b> in the 1910s and 1920s, {{with new}} artists joining {{in as the}} years went by. The 1930s saw many talented artists {{adopting}} the medium. Bertram Wiegand, known almost exclusively as Bert, began carving <b>nickels</b> in the teens, and his student George Washington Hughes, known as Bo, began carving in the late teens (and up to 1980). During this period, Buffalo <b>nickels</b> were the most common <b>nickels</b> in circulation.|$|R

5|$|Identified {{land-based}} resources {{throughout the}} world averaging 1% <b>nickel</b> or greater comprise at least 130 million tons of <b>nickel</b> (about the double of known reserves). About 60% is in laterites and 40% in sulfide deposits.|$|E
5|$|In nature, cobalt is {{frequently}} associated with <b>nickel,</b> {{and both are}} characteristic components of meteoric iron, though cobalt is much less abundant in iron meteorites than <b>nickel.</b> As with <b>nickel,</b> cobalt in meteoric iron alloys may have been well enough protected from oxygen and moisture to remain as the free (but alloyed) metal, though neither element is seen in that form in the ancient terrestrial crust.|$|E
5|$|<b>Nickel</b> and its alloys are {{frequently}} used as catalysts for hydrogenation reactions. Raney <b>nickel,</b> a finely divided nickel-aluminium alloy, is one common form, though related catalysts are also used, including Raney-type catalysts.|$|E

5|$|<b>Nickel</b> is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Ni and atomic number 28. It is a silvery-white lustrous metal {{with a slight}} golden tinge. <b>Nickel</b> belongs to the transition metals and is hard and ductile. Pure <b>nickel,</b> powdered to maximize the reactive surface area, shows a significant chemical activity, but larger pieces are slow to react with air under standard conditions because an oxide layer forms {{on the surface and}} prevents further corrosion (passivation). Even so, pure native <b>nickel</b> is found in Earth's crust only in tiny amounts, usually in ultramafic rocks, and in the interiors of larger nickel–iron meteorites that were not exposed to oxygen when outside Earth's atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|<b>Nickel</b> is a {{naturally}} magnetostrictive material, meaning that, {{in the presence}} of a magnetic field, the material undergoes a small change in length. The magnetostriction of <b>nickel</b> is on the order of 50ppm and is negative, indicating that it contracts.|$|E

5|$|<b>Nickel</b> is a silvery-white metal with {{a slight}} golden tinge that takes a high polish. It {{is one of only}} four {{elements}} that are magnetic at or near room temperature, the others being iron, cobalt and gadolinium. Its Curie temperature is , meaning that bulk <b>nickel</b> is non-magnetic above this temperature. The unit cell of <b>nickel</b> is a face-centered cube with the lattice parameter of 0.352nm, giving an atomic radius of 0.124nm. This crystal structure is stable to pressures of at least 70GPa. <b>Nickel</b> belongs to the transition metals and is hard and ductile.|$|E
5|$|<b>Nickel</b> is an {{excellent}} alloying agent for certain precious metals and {{is used in the}} fire assay as a collector of platinum group elements (PGE). As such, <b>nickel</b> is capable of fully collecting all 6 PGE elements from ores, and of partially collecting gold. High-throughput <b>nickel</b> mines may also engage in PGE recovery (primarily platinum and palladium); examples are Norilsk in Russia and the Sudbury Basin in Canada.|$|E
5|$|<b>Nickel</b> {{is one of}} four {{elements}} (iron, cobalt, <b>nickel,</b> and gadolinium) {{that are}} ferromagnetic at approximately room temperature. Alnico permanent magnets based partly on <b>nickel</b> are of intermediate strength between iron-based permanent magnets and rare-earth magnets. The metal is valuable in modern times chiefly in alloys; about 68% of world production is used in stainless steel. A further 10% is used for nickel-based and copper-based alloys, 7% for alloy steels, 3% in foundries, 9% in plating and 4% in other applications, including the fast-growing battery sector. As a compound, <b>nickel</b> has a number of niche chemical manufacturing uses, such as a catalyst for hydrogenation, cathodes for batteries, pigments and metal surface treatments. <b>Nickel</b> is an essential nutrient for some microorganisms and plants that have enzymes with <b>nickel</b> as an active site.|$|E

5|$|<b>Nickel</b> {{is slowly}} {{oxidized}} by air {{at room temperature}} and is considered corrosion-resistant. Historically, {{it has been used}} for plating iron and brass, coating chemistry equipment, and manufacturing certain alloys that retain a high silvery polish, such as German silver. About 9% of world <b>nickel</b> production is still used for corrosion-resistant <b>nickel</b> plating. Nickel-plated objects sometimes provoke <b>nickel</b> allergy. <b>Nickel</b> has been widely used in coins, though its rising price has led to some replacement with cheaper metals in recent years.|$|E
5|$|<b>Nickel</b> {{is used in}} many {{specific}} and recognizable industrial and consumer products, including stainless steel, alnico magnets, coinage, rechargeable batteries, electric guitar strings, microphone capsules, plating on plumbing fixtures, and special alloys such as permalloy, elinvar, and invar. It is used for plating and as a green tint in glass. <b>Nickel</b> is preeminently an alloy metal, and its chief use is in <b>nickel</b> steels and <b>nickel</b> cast irons, in which it typically increases the tensile strength, toughness, and elastic limit. It is widely used in many other alloys, including <b>nickel</b> brasses and bronzes and alloys with copper, chromium, aluminium, lead, cobalt, silver, and gold (Inconel, Incoloy, Monel, Nimonic).|$|E
5|$|<b>Nickel,</b> {{formerly}} {{used in the}} cent, now had {{no place}} in American coinage. This was unsatisfactory to Wharton, who sought its return. Although Pollock {{made no mention of}} further <b>nickel</b> coinage in his 1864 annual report, Wharton in April of that year published a pamphlet proposing that all non-precious metal coinage be composed of 75% copper and 25% <b>nickel.</b> The copper-nickel cents had contained only 12% <b>nickel,</b> and even so had been difficult for the Mint to strike due to the hardness of the metal, the use of which damaged equipment and quickly broke dies. An alloy of 25% <b>nickel</b> would be even more difficult to coin. Wharton argued that the tough alloy would be difficult to counterfeit.|$|E
