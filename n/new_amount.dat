50|$|Double-spending is {{an error}} in a digital cash scheme in which the same single digital token is spent twice or more. This is {{possible}} because a digital token consists of a digital file that can be duplicated or falsified. As with counterfeit money, such double-spending leads to inflation by creating a <b>new</b> <b>amount</b> of fraudulent currency that did not previously exist.

Fundamental cryptographic techniques to prevent double-spending while preserving anonymity in a transaction are blind signatures and particularly in offline systems, secret splitting.|$|E

40|$|Based on {{previous}} work {{of our group}} 69,,, graft copolymers, comb homopolymers and polymacromonomers that bear star-like single or double branches at each junction point or monomeric unit respectively, G- 2 dendritic homopolymers and diblock copolymers with a linear block and a polymacromonomer block were synthesized via anionic polymerization high vacuum techniques. The synthesis took place {{with the use of}} dual functional linking agents 4 -(chlorodimethylsilyl) styrene (CDMSS), 4 -(dichloromethylsilyl) styrene (DCMSS) and 4 -(dichloromethylsilyl) diphenylethylene (DCMSDPE). The synthetic approach of polybutadiene combs with one or two star-tailed branches emanating from each junction point of the backbone and the synthesis of polymacromonomers with one or two star-tailed branches emanating from each monomeric was achieved by performing the following steps: a). Selective reaction of living, linear polybutadienes with the two chlorines of DCMSDPE to make a double-tailed macromonomer, b). Synthesis of a three-arm living star via addition of sec-BuLi to the double bond of the group of DPE of the macromonomer and polymerization of a <b>new</b> <b>amount</b> of monomer butadiene, c). Selective reaction of the living star either with CDMSS, or DCMSS to make single- or double-star-tailed styrenic macromonomers respectively and d) Copolymerization of each styrenic macromonomer with <b>new</b> <b>amount</b> of monomer, or homopolymerization of them, in situ without isolation, to produce respectively the single-, double-star-tailed-combs, single- and double-star-tailed brushes. The synthesis of double-star-tailed PBd-PSt grafts and diblock copolymers bearing a linear PSt block and a double-star-tailed PBd-PS molecular brush as the second block was also achieved following a similar procedure. The synthetic aproach of dendritic PI homopolymers involves: a). the synthesis of macromonomer with selective replacement of the two chlorines of DCMSDPE with PI by titration, b). the synthesis of a three-arm living star via “opening” of the double bond of the terminal group of DPE of the macromonomer with initiator and polymerization of a <b>new</b> <b>amount</b> of isoprene, and finally c). the linking reaction of the three-arm star with SiCl 3. Intermediate and final products were characterized by Size Exclusion Chromatography (SEC), Size Exclusion Chromatography equipped with a Two Angle Laser Light Scattering detector (SEC-TALLS) and Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), techniques. The combined characterization resuls showed that the synthetic procedures led to to materials with high molecular and compositional homogeneity. The dielectric relaxation behavior, in a region of frequencies from 3 x 106 to 10 - 3 Hz, of two dendritic PI homopolymers was studied. Their glass transition temperatures (Tg) were determined via Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC). We examined the relaxation process of the outer branches of the dendrimers and also, if and how this is affected by the existence of the junction points and the molecular weight of the inner parts. ...|$|E

40|$|Nasal {{polyposis}} is {{a chronic}} inflammatory {{disease of the}} nasal and paranasal sinuses mucosa, characterized by prolaps of edematous mucosa, most commonly from the area of anterior ethmoid. The mean histological characteristics are proliferation of pseudostratified respiratory epithelium, thickening of the basement membrane, focal fibrosis and eosinophilic and lymphocytic infiltration of the lamina propria. Although etiology is unknown, two hypotheses are dominant among the scientists: ”hypothesis of staphylococcal superantigens“ and ”hypothesis of immune barrier dysfunction“. Although {{we have not yet}} achieved a full understanding of the precise mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of this disease, it is known that nasal polyposis is associated with intensive chronic inflammation, followed by dysregulation of chemotaxis, migration, activation and function of eosinophils. A great number of cytokines, chemokines, and adhesion molecules are involved in the regulation of these complex mechanisms. After activation, eosinophils produce and release enzymes, which can lead to the damage of mucosa and tissue remodeling.

40|$|One of {{the main}} goals of the STAR Spin Collaboration is to {{understand}} the intrinsic angular momentum of the proton.

In order to use properly the data collected, the energy and position measurements in the EEMC need to be well-known.

The important property of MIPs utilized was that they will deposit a <b>new</b> <b>amount</b> of energy into a material. Knowing the composition of the EEMC, the expected amount of energy is also known. The MIPs then deposit this energy, which is measured and compared to the expected energy. A calibration constant is then calculated from this comparison. A description of this method and the current status of the energy calibration will be presented with results...|$|E
