A study done by Werblow found that {{increases}} in school size can be [...] "associated with a 12% increase in average student dropout rate". However, once a school becomes very large, its size seems to hardly affect dropout rates except for its effect on other factors. Large schools, enrolling between 1,500 and 2,500 students, were found to have the largest proportion of students who dropped out, 12%. Small schools have the lowest dropout rate.|$|E
50|$|In {{probability}} theory, two {{random variables}} being linearly uncorrelated {{does not imply}} their independence (however, for some measures of <b>non-linear</b> <b>correlation</b> such as the distance correlation, uncorrelated implies independent). In some contexts, linear uncorrelatedness implies at least pairwise independence (as when the random variables involved have Bernoulli distributions). It is sometimes mistakenly thought that one context in which linear uncorrelatedness implies independence is when the random variables involved are normally distributed. However, this is incorrect if the variables are merely marginally normally distributed but not jointly normally distributed.|$|E
40|$|<b>Non-linear</b> <b>correlations</b> {{based on}} mutual {{information}} are evaluated to measure statistical dependencies among data points measured from metabolism in two dimensional space. While the Pearson correlation coefficient is only rigorously applicable to characterize strictly linear correlations with Gaussian noise, the mutual information coefficient is more generally valid. Here, we use recent distribution-free (non-parametric) mutual information estimators based on k-nearest neighbor distances. The mutual information algorithm of Kraskov et al. {{is found to}} yield estimates with low systematic and statistical error. The significance of the different methods is probed for artificial sets of tens to hundreds of data points, a size currently typical for metabolomic data. We analyze experimental data on metabolite concentrations from Arabidopsis thaliana by using these procedures.

40|$|Canonical {{correlation}} analysis (CCA) is a classical dimensionality reduction technique for {{two sets of}} variables that iteratively finds projection directions with maximum correlation. Although CCA is still in vital use in many practical application areas, recent real-world data often contain more complicated <b>non-linear</b> <b>correlations</b> {{that can not be}} properly captured by classical CCA. In this paper, we thus propose an extension of CCA that can effectively capture such complicated <b>non-linear</b> <b>correlations</b> through statistical dependency maximization. The proposed method, which we call least-squares canonical dependency analysis (LSCDA), is based on a squared-loss variant of mutual information, and it has various useful properties besides its ability to capture higher-order correlations, for example, it can simultaneously find multiple projection directions (i. e., subspaces), it does not involve density estimation, and it is equipped with a model selection strategy. We demonstrate the usefulness of LSCDA through various experiments on artificial and real-world datasets...|$|R
40|$|We {{introduce}} TailCoR, a {{new measure}} for tail correlation {{that is a}} function of linear and non–linear contributions, the latter characterized by the tails. TailCoR can be exploited in a number of financial applications, such as portfolio selection where the investor faces risks of linear and tail nature –a case that we cover in detail. Moreover, TailCoR has the following advantages: i) it is exact for any probability level as it is not based on tail asymptotic arguments (contrary to tail dependence coefficients), ii) it is distribution free, and iii) it is simple and no optimizations are needed. Monte Carlo simulations and calibrations reveal its goodness in finite samples. An empirical illustration to a panel of European sovereign bonds shows that prior to 2009 linear correlations were in the vicinity of one and <b>non–linear</b> <b>correlations</b> were inexistent. Since the beginning of the crisis the linear correlations have decreased sharply and <b>non–linear</b> <b>correlations</b> appeared and increased significantly in 2010 – 2011...|$|R

As one can see from Figure 11, a greater eeproduct than expected was observed. According to the ML2 model, Kagan and coworkers were able to conclude that a less reactive heterochiral DET complex was present. This would therefore explain the asymmetric amplification observed. The NLE data is also consistent with the Sharpless mechanism of asymmetric epoxidation.|$|E

This paper proposes an innovative approach that is especially tailored to detect linear and <b>non-linear</b> <b>correlation</b> between time series characterized by high variability. We compare the proposed solution and existing algorithms in terms of accuracy and robustness for several synthetic and real settings characterized by low and high variability, linear and <b>non-linear</b> <b>correlation.</b> The results show that our proposal guarantees analogous performance for low variable time series, and improves state of the art in finding correlations in highly variable domains that are of interest for the application context...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} handle {{diameter}} (25 ~ 50 mm) and handle orientation (horizontal and vertical) on the subjective comfort, maximum torque performance, total finger force, {{and efficiency of}} flexor and extensor muscle activity were evaluated in this study.

Overall 35 ~ 45 mm diameter handles were rated as most comfortable. The average torque outputs were highest with the 45 and 50 mm diameter handles in both orientations. Torque output exhibited a positive <b>non-linear</b> <b>correlation</b> with handle diameter, whereas total finger force showed an inverse relationship with handle diameter. The positive <b>non-linear</b> <b>correlation</b> between torque and handle diameter was explained by the relationship between handle diameter, total finger force, and coefficient of friction.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: The {{correlation}} dimension (CD) {{method is}} related to chaos theory and is used to quantify heart rate variability (HRV). The CD is a measure {{for the amount of}} correlations present in the signal. METHODS: The algorithm used to calculate the CD is based on the method of Grassberger and Proccacia. The method was first validated on signals with known CD and then applied to HRV-signals of heart transplants and an age-matched control group of healthy subjects. The CD of the corresponding surrogate time series was calculated to investigate <b>non-linear</b> <b>correlations</b> in the HRV-signal. Circadian variations of the CD were studied in 20 healthy subjects, including men and women. RESULTS: The value of the CD for healthy subjects ranged from 2. 12 to 5. 53 with a mean value of 4. 32. For heart transplants, only a few time series showed a finite value of the CD that varied between 2. 10 and 5. 60. Also, a significant difference was found between the CD of the original and the surrogate time series in healthy subjects. The CD of women is higher than the CD of men, and this difference was more pronounced during the night than during the day. CONCLUSIONS: This limited study shows that the CD alone cannot be used to make a distinction between HRV-signals of healthy subjects and of heart transplants. However, there is evidence that there are <b>non-linear</b> <b>correlations</b> present in the HRV-signal and that there are significant gender and circadian differences in the CD. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The {{distribution}} of the return intervals τ between volatilities above a threshold q for financial records has been approximated by a scaling behavior. To explore how accurate is the scaling and therefore understand the underlined non-linear mechanism, we investigate intraday datasets of 500 stocks which consist of the Standard & Poor's 500 index. We show that the cumulative {{distribution of}} return intervals has systematic deviations from scaling. We support this finding by studying the m-th moment μ_m ≡) ^m>^ 1 /m, which show a certain trend with the mean interval. We generate surrogate records using the Schreiber method, and find that their cumulative distributions almost collapse to a single curve and moments are almost constant for most range of. Those substantial differences suggest that <b>non-linear</b> <b>correlations</b> in the original volatility sequence account for the deviations from a single scaling law. We also find that the original and surrogate records exhibit slight tendencies for short and long, due to the discreteness and finite size effects of the records respectively. To avoid as possible those effects for testing the multiscaling behavior, we investigate the moments in the range 10 ≤ 100, and find the exponent α from the power law fitting μ_m∼ ^α has a narrow distribution around α≠ 0 which depend on m for the 500 stocks. The distribution of α for the surrogate records are very narrow and centered around α= 0. This suggests that the return interval distribution exhibit multiscaling behavior due to the <b>non-linear</b> <b>correlations</b> in the original volatility. ...|$|R

This paper deals with electricity consumption and electrical load demand in Swedish grocery stores. Several interesting results were observed, such as: <b>non-linear</b> <b>correlation</b> between floor area and electricity consumption, and <b>non-linear</b> <b>correlation</b> between outdoor temperature and electricity consumption. Electricity Consumption Indicators (ECIs) were developed based on 11 months of load research data from 21 grocery stores. Load shapes, and daily, monthly and annual consumption indicators were developed. The usage of two different area figures was studied: the gross floor area and the sales floor area. The analysis showed that the sales area provides the most information about the actual store conditions and is of greater importance when analysing the electricity consumption in grocery stores. There was {{a high level of}} agreement in comparisons to measured data. Grocery stores are among the highest electricity consumers if the specific electricity consumption (kWh/m·yr) is compared.

40|$|We {{introduce}} a new Markov-Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach designed for efficient sampling of highly correlated and multimodal posteriors. Parallel tempering, though effective, is a costly technique for sampling such posteriors.

The estimation of parameters of gravitational-wave signals measured by ground-based detectors is currently done through Bayesian inference with MCMC one of the leading sampling methods. Posteriors for these signals are typically multimodal with strong <b>non-linear</b> <b>correlations,</b> making sampling difficult.
