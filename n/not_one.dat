5|$|All {{seven of}} Angelou's {{installments}} {{of her life}} story are {{in the tradition of}} African-American autobiography. Starting with I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, Angelou challenges the usual structure of the autobiography by critiquing, changing, and expanding the genre. Angelou said in 1989 that she is the only serious writer to choose autobiography to express herself, but she reports <b>not</b> <b>one</b> person's story, but the collective's. Scholar Selwyn R. Cudjoe writes that Angelou is representative of the convention in African-American autobiography as a public gesture that speaks for an entire group of people. Her use of devices common in fictional writing, such as dialog, characterization and thematic development, has led some reviewers to categorize her books as autobiographical fiction.|$|E

5|$|Aware of the {{importance}} of causal structure, Roger Penrose and others developed what is known as global geometry. In global geometry, the object of study is <b>not</b> <b>one</b> particular solution (or family of solutions) to Einstein's equations. Rather, relations that hold true for all geodesics, such as the Raychaudhuri equation, and additional non-specific assumptions about the nature of matter (usually in the form of energy conditions) are used to derive general results.|$|E

5|$|Discovered in 1834 by Johann Friedrich Engelhardt and {{described}} {{three years later}} by Hermann von Meyer, Plateosaurus was the fifth named dinosaur genus that is still considered valid. Although it had been described before Richard Owen formally named Dinosauria in 1842, it was <b>not</b> <b>one</b> of the three genera used by Owen to define the group, because at the time, it was poorly known and difficult to identify as a dinosaur. It is now among the dinosaurs best known to science: over 100 skeletons have been found, some of them nearly complete. The abundance of its fossils in Swabia, Germany, {{has led to the}} nickname Schwäbischer Lindwurm (Swabian lindworm).|$|E

5|$|Discs : Circular fossils, such as Ediacaria, Cyclomedusa and Rugoconites led to {{the initial}} {{identification}} of Ediacaran fossils as cnidaria, which include jellyfish and corals. Further examination has provided alternative interpretations of all disc-shaped fossils: <b>not</b> <b>one</b> is now confidently recognised as a jellyfish. Alternate explanations include holdfasts and protists; the patterns displayed where two meet have led to many 'individuals' being identified as microbial colonies, and yet others may represent scratch marks formed as stalked organisms spun around their holdfasts. Useful diagnostic characters are often lacking because only {{the underside of the}} organism is preserved by fossilisation.|$|E

5|$|From the Octagon, Princes Street {{initially}} rises as {{it passes}} through a commercial district formerly {{commonly known as the}} Top 100, crossing the outer Octagon of Moray Place before descending through the original cutting of Bell Hill towards the Exchange. The Top 100 theoretically takes its name from the 100 retail businesses which line Princes Street from the Octagon to the Exchange, although the actual number of businesses is <b>not</b> <b>one</b> hundred. This part of the city is sometimes seen as the creative heart of Dunedin, with numerous art galleries, video production companies, and the city's professional theatre (the Fortune Theatre) all being based in the area from Moray Place to Rattray Street.|$|E

5|$|From {{the sixteenth}} century onwards Alfred's {{reputation}} became dominant and Æthelstan largely disappeared from popular consciousness.

Charles Dickens had only one paragraph on Æthelstan in his Child's History of England, and although Anglo-Saxon history was a popular subject for nineteenth-century artists, and Alfred was frequently depicted in paintings at the Royal Academy between 1769 and 1904, there was <b>not</b> <b>one</b> picture of Æthelstan.|$|E

Their marriage was a devoted, loving and faithful one, though beset by personal tragedy.|$|E

40|$|Different {{renderings of}} Paul’s use of harpax in 1 Cor 5 : 10 by biblical interpreters have {{suggested}} different meanings. Through lexico-semantic analysis, this paper contends that this word {{should be understood}} {{as an act of}} taking forcibly what is <b>not</b> <b>one’s</b> own. Harpax and pleonektēs are syntactically and semantically related. By syntax, they are modified by a definite article and conjoined by a conjunction kai; hence, they describe a class of people, sharing the same values. By semantics, both pleonektēs and harpax essentially denote the attitude of greed. It is argued that once greed (pleonektēs) is cultivated, the act of taking forcibly what is <b>not</b> <b>one’s</b> own (harpax) becomes a natural development. In these syntactical and semantic relationships, pleonektēs may describe a feeling of wanting what is <b>not</b> <b>one’s</b> own while harpax expresses how this feeling forcibly is realized. Since harpax is listed among certain vices practiced by unbelievers and Corinthian believers are to dissociate themselves from such people, Ghanaian believers are urged to actively and passively dissociate themselves from those who forcibly take what is not theirs...|$|R
