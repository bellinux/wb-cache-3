5|$|Chlorine is {{responsible}} for the degradation of fish and shrimp in the creek. The sources for chlorine in urban runoff include irrigation and car washing. The only remaining fish species in the creek is carp, which can withstand high amounts of chlorine. Carp up to 18inches (1.5feet / 45cm) long have been found in Aliso Creek <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouth.</b> Temperatures of the creek <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouth</b> have been known to exceed , although the temperature at the outflow is often much colder because it has been mixed with seawater.|$|E

5|$|The spermatophores usually remain {{embedded}} <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouth</b> of the female. Mating usually occurs {{well before}} spawning, {{but may also}} happen on the spawning grounds themselves. In those cases, the male will stay near the female's side as she lays eggs.|$|E
5|$|From Puerto de Caballos, Gil González sailed west {{along the}} coast to the Amatique Bay, and founded a Spanish {{settlement}} <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouth</b> of the Río Dulce, within modern-day Guatemala, which he named San Gil de Buena Vista. He launched a campaign of conquest in the mountainous region dividing Honduras from Guatemala. González left some of his men {{under the command of}} Francisco Riquelme at San Gil de Buena Vista, and sailed back east {{along the coast}} to a point east of the Cape of Honduras (near modern Trujillo). From there he marched inland in search of a route to the Pacific. The colonists at San Gil did not prosper, and soon searched of a more hospitable location. They resettled in the important indigenous town of Nito, <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouth</b> of the Dulce River.|$|E

5|$|Much of Harveys Creek is in a forested gorge, {{which is}} {{situated}} in its lower reaches. The upper reaches of its watershed contain swamps and glacial lakes. The cliffs of Tilbury Knob are also situated <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouth</b> of the creek. The creek's source is in Harveys Lake, {{which is the largest}} natural lake in Pennsylvania. It flows in a generally southward direction.|$|E

5|$|The {{watershed}} of Toby Creek {{is predominantly}} rural. Most of it (61.3 percent) is forested land. Considerably less common are grassland (19.6 percent) and urban land (16.4 percent). A total of 2.1 {{percent of the}} creek's watershed consists of wetlands and 0.6 percent consists of mining lands. The mining land is confined to one area <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouth</b> of the creek.|$|E
5000|$|A few sawmills {{were located}} along the Mississippi Gulf Coast, <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouths</b> of rivers and streams, which {{were used for}} rafting logs to the mills.

Numerous bridges have also been constructed across the creek. Part of the creek is in the Montour Ridge Landscape Corridor.|$|E
5|$|Thwarted in the east, Attalus {{now turned}} his {{attention}} westward.

5|$|A nearby village, Niguili, {{was located}} <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouth</b> of Aliso Creek likely near the {{confluence}} of Aliso and Sulphur Creeks.

The Acjachemen were renamed the Juaneño by Spanish priests in the 18th century, who established a mission at the present-day location of San Juan Capistrano. Following the Spanish arrival, most Juaneño clustered around the mission in the south. Like many other once widespread Juaneño villages, Niguili was likely abandoned soon after, and there is no trace of it remaining.|$|E

5|$|Approximately 24percent of the creek's {{watershed}} {{contains the}} Wellsboro-Oquaga-Morris series. The series {{is made of}} Wellsboro soils, Oquaga soils, and some Morris soils. This type of soil series is most common near the creek's source. Another twenty-four percent of the Nescopeck Creek watershed {{is made up of}} the Leck Kill-Meckesville-Calvin series. This soil series tends to occur on hillsides near streams. The Leck Kill-Meckesville-Calvin series occurs quite <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouth</b> of Nescopeck Creek, with a large patch further upstream, and a small patch in the southwestern part of the Nescopeck Creek watershed.|$|E
5|$|At its {{southern}} end <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouth</b> of the Don River, the parkway begins in a multiple-level interchange with the ground-level Lake Shore Boulevard and the elevated Gardiner Expressway directly above the boulevard.

To travel east from the southbound lanes of the parkway, motorists must exit via the off-ramp to Lake Shore Boulevard, which meets the Lake Shore at a signalized intersection.|$|E
5|$|At {{the turn}} of the 20th century the area around the mouth of the River Somme was {{considered}} a paradise for hunters interested in wildfowl. Because of quarantine restrictions in the United Kingdom, British shooters would board their dogs in the Picardy area, <b>near</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouth</b> of the Somme. This caused the infusion of English Setter blood into the local Spaniel population and developed the Blue Picardy Spaniel.|$|E
