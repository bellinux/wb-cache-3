40|$|The Nuclear Materials Identification System (NMIS) is in use {{domestically}} for {{the performance}} of <b>non-destructive</b> <b>assays</b> of fissile material. These procedures involve the fast correlation measurement of neutrons and gamma rays from fission using organic scintillation detectors. In active measurements, an external source of neutrons is used to induce fission in the sample to be analyzed.

Typically, active NMIS measurements make use of a Cf- 252 external neutron source. Recent efforts have studied the use of DT generators as an alternative to Cf- 252 sources. DT generators use alpha detectors to time tag monoenergetic 14 MeV neutrons in a directed cone. However, since it is desirable that the detector performance be characterized over a continuous spectrum of neutron energies, the time-of-flight determination of the detector efficiency as a function of energy requires that the 14 MeV neutrons be slightly moderated to reduce the neutron energy to the region of interest.

Human chondrocytes were seeded and cultured in a perfusion bioreactor, and oxygen levels in the culture medium were continuously monitored at the inlet and outlet of the bioreactor chamber throughout the culture period.

40|$|At the Plutonium Facility at Los Alamos National Laboratory, {{a series}} of <b>non-destructive</b> <b>assays</b> were {{performed}} on five transuranic waste (TRU) drums containing non-plutonium scrap metal that was potentially contaminated with weapons grade plutonium and trace quantities of curium. Typically, waste drums containing metal matrices are assayed for plutonium content using passive neutron coincidence counting techniques. The presence of trace quantities of Cm- 244 prevents this type of analysis because of the strong coincidence signal created by spontaneous fission of Cm- 244. To discriminate between the plutonium and curium materials present, an active neutron measurement technique was used. A Cf shuffler designed for measurement of uranium bearing materials was calibrated for plutonium in the active mode. The waste drums were then assayed for plutonium content in the shuffler using the active-mode calibration.

However, the main mission of SRS has changed from the production of SNM to the processing of waste and material stabilization. Currently, the purpose of processing is to recover the SNM from the waste and stabilization materials, much of which is from other DOE facilities. These missions are usually of a short duration, but require <b>non-destructive</b> <b>assay</b> (NDA) accountability measurements on materials of varying composition and geometric configuration. These missions usually have cost and time constraints, which sometimes require re-application of existing NDA methods to waste measurements.

However due to the low neutron emission of neutron generators the challenging task resides in the development of an imaging detector with a high efficiency, a low sensitivity to gamma radiation and a resolution sufficient for the purpose. Setup: The setup of the experiment is shown in Figure 1. The 14 MeV neutrons are produced by a D-T neutron generator. Neutron detection is achieved using a 40 x 40 cm² amorphous silicon (aSi) flat panel detector linked to a plastic scintillator. The detector thermal noise was reduced by employing an entrance windows made of aluminium. The optimal gain and integration time were obtained by measuring the response of the detector to the radiation of a 241 Am source. Performance Tests: First test measurements were carried out with different materials made of Al, C, Fe, Pb, W, concrete and polyethylene (50 x 80 x 100 mm³). Each sample was irradiated with PE as a reference. Data analysis was performed with a homemade algorithm which allows determining a value related to the neutron absorption. Results: First neutron radiographies were successfully recorded despite the low detector efficiency and low neutron intensity. In addition the correlation between the absorption and measured signal attenuation was determined and is shown in figure 2. The measurements and results will be presented and discussed...|$|R

40|$|Over 80 {{per cent}} of the {{material}} placed under safeguards today {{is in the form}} of spent fuel and one of the main ways to verify it is by <b>Non-Destructive</b> <b>Assays.</b> The main goal for the safeguards inspections is to verify that some or all the material has not been diverted to other purposes by detecting the eventual gross or partial defect. The European Commission with the JRC-ITU located in Ispra in collaboration with Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory is studying the application of a detector to BWR fuel assemblies immersed in a spent fuel pool. The Partial Defect Tester (PDET) employs a set of neutron and photon detectors to be inserted in the fuel assembly to quantify the spatial distribution of the two fluxes within a PWR fuel assembly. The insertion of multiple detectors inside a PWR assembly does not have a major technical problem and has been investigated by the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. The situation changes when the same concept is applied to a BWR assembly. A generic BWR assembly contains less fuel pins compared to a PWR assembly, but inside a traditional BWR assembly there are fewer water holes since the control rods have a cruciform shape and are inserted between neighbouring fuel assemblies. The purpose of this study was to assess the feasibility of gross defect verification by evaluating the spatial distribution of both neutron and photon flux inside the BWR spent fuel assemblies. This study also gave an indication whether the irradiation history of the fuel assembly (burnup and cooling time) plays a role in the detection of the gross diversion. The results showed that the gross defect is detectable by looking at the normalized ratio between the neutron and gamma signal (N/P ratio) as well as the normalized neutron and gamma signals. In particular, the change in shape of the normalized gamma signal appears to be a good indicator of a gross defect independent of operator declarations, regardless of whether the storage rack has assemblies with varying or non-varying burnups and cooling times.
