25|$|DDR SDRAM modules for desktop computers, dual in-line memory modules (DIMMs), have 184 pins (as {{opposed to}} 168 pins on SDRAM, or 240 pins on DDR2 SDRAM), {{and can be}} {{differentiated}} from SDRAM DIMMs {{by the number of}} notches (DDR SDRAM has one, SDRAM has two).

25|$|In the USSR, {{the power}} supply system of an {{electric}} railroad is {{closely tied to the}} overall power system. Electricity arrives from substations in high-voltage power transmission lines, is converted, and then transmitted over feed and negative booster lines to the contact system and then to the rolling stock. Depending on the equipment in the rolling stock, the power may be supplied over DC systems using single-phase systems at the commercial frequency (50 hertz) or lower (16 2/3 or 25Hz).

25|$|Low-voltage {{miniature}} {{circuit breakers}} (MCB) use air alone to extinguish the arc. These circuit breakers contain so-called arc chutes, a stack of mutually insulated parallel metal plates which divide and cool the arc. By splitting the arc into smaller arcs the arc is cooled down while the arc voltage is increased and serves as an additional impedance which limits the current through the circuit breaker. The current-carrying parts near the contacts provide easy deflection of the arc into the arc chutes by a magnetic force of a current path, although magnetic blowout coils or permanent magnets could also deflect the arc into the arc chute (used on circuit breakers for higher ratings).So The number of plates in the arc chute {{is dependent on the}} short-circuit rating and <b>nominal</b> <b>voltage</b> of the circuit breaker.|$|E
