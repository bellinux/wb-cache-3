25|$|Acid rock {{drainage}} {{has recently}} been a hindrance to {{the completion of the}} construction of Interstate 99 near State College, Pennsylvania. However, this acid rock drainage didn't come from a mine; rather, it was produced by oxidation of pyrite-rich rock which was unearthed during a road cut and then used as filler material in the I-99 construction. A similar situation developed at the Halifax airport in Canada. It is from these and similar experiences that the term acid rock drainage has emerged as being preferable to acid mine drainage, thereby emphasizing the general <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Court’s {{decision}} to qualify speech protection in Pickering v. Board of Ed. of Township High School Dist. (1968), aimed {{to create a}} balance that would resolve the tension between individual and public interest in the speech on one hand, and the public employer’s interest in efficient operation, on the other. Souter wrote that the need to balance these competing needs hardly disappears when the employee happens to speak on issues that his job requires him to address.

25|$|OBD II is {{no longer}} only used by {{professionals}} and hobbyists to repair vehicles. OBD II information is commonly used by vehicle telematics devices that perform fleet tracking, monitor fuel efficiency, prevent unsafe driving, {{as well as for}} remote diagnostics and by pay-as-you-drive insurance. Although originally not intended for the above purposes, commonly supported OBD II data such as vehicle speed, RPM, and fuel level allow GPS-based fleet tracking devices to monitor vehicle idling times, speeding, and over-revving. By monitoring OBD II DTCs a company can know immediately if one of its vehicles has an engine problem and by interpreting the code the <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem.</b> OBD II is also monitored to block mobile phones when driving and to record trip data for insurance purposes.|$|E

25|$|The game {{is divided}} into 19 cases, {{starting}} in Ancient Egypt and each advancing the player closer to the modern day. The player must complete all cases to win the game. Before starting a case, the Chief will tell the player the <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> {{in the period of}} history. At the start of each case, the player will be assisted by one of five accompanying Good Guides (Ann Tickwittee, Ivan Idea, Rock Solid, Renee Santz, and Polly Tix), characters who are knowledgeable of the culture of each case's historical period and who have a particular area of historical expertise, such as antiquities, exploration or inventions. They will provide some historical context, and mention any notable figures who will appear throughout the case. They also help the player by liaising with the historical figures on the player's behalf. After clicking on a person, the player can proceed to question them about their situation. If necessary, they may then re-ask any questions via rollover text to extract further information. Historical characters' responses guide the player toward that period's task.|$|E
500|$|By April 1943, No.1 OTU's {{complement}} {{had grown}} to 2,411 personnel. Over a four-day period beginning 20April, the unit relocated to East Sale, utilising 110 tenders in 535 trips along the Princes Highway. Its fleet of aircraft included 55 Beauforts, 35 Oxfords, 25 Hudsons, 14 Fairey Battles and one de Havilland Tiger Moth. Training courses commenced at the new base {{the day after the}} move was completed. One of the students on the first course at East Sale was future Prime Minister Gough Whitlam. Group Captain Bill Garing served as commanding officer from August 1943 to February 1944. He set an Australian record on 19January 1944, when he landed a Tiger Moth atop the [...] Mount Wellington, to retrieve an injured stockman. Garing also took measures to allay concerns among crews regarding the Australian-built Beaufort, which appeared to have a mysterious fault that caused many fatalities. [...] By the time No.1 OCU moved to East Sale, it had suffered 47 accidents involving Beauforts. Garing organised an aerobatic display by a Beaufort for the benefit of students, and an open day at the base on 16October 1943; he also ordered extensive ground testing on the aircraft. Accidents continued to occur, however, and it was ultimately through the efforts of Wing Commander Charles Learmonth immediately prior to his death in a Beaufort off the Western Australian coast that the <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> was recognised and overcome.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the most}} {{striking}} disorders of consciousness goes by the name anosognosia, a Greek-derived term meaning unawareness of disease. [...] This is a condition in which patients are disabled in some way, most commonly {{as a result of a}} stroke, but either misunderstand the <b>nature</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> or deny that there is anything wrong with them. [...] The most frequently occurring form is seen in people who have experienced a stroke damaging the parietal lobe in the right hemisphere of the brain, giving rise to a syndrome known as hemispatial neglect, characterized by an inability to direct action or attention toward objects located to the left with respect to their bodies. [...] Patients with hemispatial neglect are often paralyzed on the right side of the body, but sometimes deny being unable to move. [...] When questioned about the obvious problem, the patient may avoid giving a direct answer, or may give an explanation that doesn't make sense. [...] Patients with hemispatial neglect may also fail to recognize paralyzed parts of their bodies: [...] one frequently mentioned case is of a man who repeatedly tried to throw his own paralyzed right leg out of the bed he was lying in, and when asked what he was doing, complained that somebody had put a dead leg into the bed with him. [...] An even more striking type of anosognosia is Anton–Babinski syndrome, a rarely occurring condition in which patients become blind but claim to be able to see normally, and persist in this claim in spite of all evidence to the contrary.|$|E
