25|$|During World War I {{the army}} and navy mothers, or should I say the war mothers, had {{canteens}} at our own depot. Why can't we, the people of North Platte and other towns surrounding our community, start a fund and open a Canteen <b>now?</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> be {{more than willing to}} give my time without charge and run this canteen.|$|E
25|$|There are {{a number}} of {{imperfections}} in the new South Africa where I would have hoped that things would be better, but on balance I think we have basically achieved what we set out to achieve. And if I were to draw balance sheets on where South Africa stands <b>now,</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> say that the positive outweighs the negative by far. There is a tendency by commentators across the world to focus on the few negatives which are quite negative, like how are we handling AIDS, like our role vis-à-vis Zimbabwe. But the positives – the stability in South Africa, the adherence to well-balanced economic policies, fighting inflation, doing all the right things in order to lay the basis and the foundation for sustained economic growth – are in place.|$|E
500|$|Some early {{proponents of}} the LWF program, such as John Boyd and Pierre Sprey, have criticized the {{evolution}} of the F-16 design into a more complex and expensive multi-role fighter as counter to the intention of the LWF program, which was to produce a simple air-to-air fighter. Harry Hillaker, a General Dynamics engineer described as [...] "The Father of the F-16" [...] is quoted in a 1991 interview as stating [...] "If I had realized {{at the time that the}} airplane would have been used as a multimission, primarily an air-to-surface airplane as it is used <b>now,</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have designed it differently." ...|$|E

500|$|Five {{months after}} the Olympic session, with the Beatles having now broken up, [...] "My Sweet Lord" [...] was one of 30 or more tracks that Harrison {{recorded}} for his All Things Must Pass triple album. It was a song he had been reluctant to record, for fear of committing himself publicly to such an overt religious message. [...] "I was sticking my neck out on the chopping block because <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have {{to live up to}} something," [...] Harrison explained in I Me Mine, [...] "but at the same time I thought 'Nobody's saying it; I wish somebody else was doing it.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Prior to her onscreen debut, Francis {{appeared}} on the CBS talk show The Talk and stated that she [...] "would not have this job without Oprah Winfrey", saying: [...] "I must thank Oprah Winfrey here and <b>now.</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not have this job without her. She made my dream come true as well." [...] In August 2011, Francis began experiencing lack of screen-time, leading viewers to speculate she had been let go from the soap opera and possibly returning to her General Hospital role. However, a spokesperson for The Young and the Restless confirmed that Francis was simply taking a brief hiatus to film a sequel to her Hallmark Channel film The Note.|$|E
2500|$|On August 31, in {{a speech}} before a {{gathering}} of a religious group in Davao City, Duterte said that he once considered being a priest: [...] "It's good I didn't join the priesthood," [...] said Duterte, [...] "or else <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> be a homosexual." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Of {{course you}} may! This proves {{to me that}} we have a hold on the boy's heart, and <b>I</b> <b>would</b> no more send him away <b>now</b> than <b>I</b> <b>would</b> my own Rob." ...|$|R
60|$|I went away. But <b>I</b> was exasperated <b>now.</b> <b>I</b> said <b>I</b> <b>would</b> haunt them; <b>I</b> <b>would</b> infest every {{department}} of this iniquitous government till that contract business was settled. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> collect that bill, or fall, as fell my predecessors, trying. I assailed the Postmaster-General; I besieged the Agricultural Department; I waylaid the Speaker of the House of Representatives. They {{had nothing to}} do with army contracts for beef. I moved upon the Commissioner of the Patent Office.|$|R
2500|$|On September 20, CBS {{retracted}} the story. Rather stated, [...] "If I {{knew then}} what I know <b>now,</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> {{not have gone}} ahead with the story as it was aired, and I certainly would not have used the documents in question." [...] The controversy {{has been referred to}} by some as [...] "Memogate" [...] and [...] "Rathergate." ...|$|E
2500|$|Next, Henslow {{called upon}} Admiral Robert FitzRoy, {{who had been}} Darwin's captain and {{companion}} on the voyage of the Beagle twenty-five years earlier. FitzRoy denounced Darwin's book and, [...] "lifting an immense Bible first {{with both hands and}} afterwards with one hand over his head, solemnly implored the audience to believe God rather than man". He was believed to have said: [...] "I believe that this is the Truth, and had I known then what I know <b>now,</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not have taken him [...] aboard the Beagle." ...|$|E
2500|$|In May 2015, Bush {{stated that}} he would have ordered the 2003 {{invasion}} of Iraq had he been president at the time: “I would have , and so would have Hillary Clinton, just to remind everybody. And so would almost everybody that was confronted with the intelligence they got." [...] He also indicated that the lack of focus on post-invasion security was a mistake. He later stated that [...] "knowing what we know <b>now,</b> ...<b>I</b> <b>would</b> not have engaged". [...] "I would not have gone into Iraq", he said. [...] He also argued that the invasion—though perhaps inspired by faulty intelligence—had been beneficial, saying the world was [...] "significantly safer" [...] without Saddam Hussein in power.|$|E
2500|$|Dan Rather stated, [...] "if I {{knew then}} what <b>I</b> know <b>now</b> — <b>I</b> <b>would</b> {{not have gone}} ahead with the story as it was aired, and <b>I</b> {{certainly}} <b>would</b> not have used the documents in question." ...|$|R

2500|$|As {{a sophomore}} at Alabama in 1999–2000, the 21-year-old Cotton was the team's most veteran player. [...] With four {{freshman}} starters, the Crimson Tide were among the youngest teams in Division I. Although the team struggled, Cotton averaged a team-leading 15.5 points and 4.6 rebounds per game, and he earned second-team all-conference honors in the Southeastern Conference (SEC). Playing out of position as an undersized power forward, he did not help to address critics of his perimeter skills. Forgoing his remaining {{two years of college}} eligibility, he hired an agent and declared early for the NBA. In 2010, he expressed disappointment in his college experience. [...] "If I had known what I know <b>now,</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> probably have skipped college,” said Cotton.|$|E

6000|$|... "Then I {{want you}} to do it. You lend people money. I wonder if you could let me have as much <b>now</b> as <b>I</b> <b>would</b> get in the next four or five years. Of course, you would charge me for doing it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Enough said," [...] replied Hildebrod; [...] "and <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> {{have you}} go to my house, and get {{something}} hot--you will be but dreary here by yourself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “You don’t {{know who}} you’re {{speaking}} to,” said Chief Inspector Heat firmly. “If I were to lay {{my hands on}} you <b>now</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> be no better than yourself.” ...|$|E

60|$|I {{spoke to}} Secretary McCulloch about giving Mrs. Porter a clerkship in the Treasury and he promised {{me he would}} do it, but has not yet. <b>Now,</b> <b>I</b> fancy, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not have much influence, and if <b>I</b> had, <b>would</b> {{be very careful about}} using it.|$|R
