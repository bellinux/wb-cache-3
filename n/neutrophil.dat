40|$|The {{morphological}} {{features of}} blood and milk <b>neutrophils</b> from peak lactating goats were compared using light microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and flow cytometry in order to investigate the cytological changes of <b>neutrophils</b> after migration into the mammary gland. The kinetics of reactive oxygen intermediates (ROI) generation and gelatinase release {{of blood and}} milk <b>neutrophils,</b> with or without stimulation of phorbol 12 -myristate, 13 -acetate ester (PMA), were used to characterize their responses to inflammatory stimuli. <b>Neutrophils</b> isolated from goat milk were highly segmented and contained multi-lobed nuclei. Ultrastructurally, milk <b>neutrophils</b> were more ruffled on the surface compared to blood <b>neutrophils.</b> Approximately 30 % of milk <b>neutrophils</b> were undergoing cell death, either necrosis or apoptosis, in contrast to 8 % of blood <b>neutrophils.</b> The ROI production of activated milk <b>neutrophils</b> peaked earlier than blood <b>neutrophils,</b> but the duration and the intensity were much less. <b>Neutrophils</b> from both sources augmented the release of gelatinase in response to PMA (1 ng/mL). However, the amount of gelatinase released from milk <b>neutrophils</b> was lower (P < 0. 05) than that of blood <b>neutrophils.</b> In summary, more <b>neutrophils</b> become apoptotic and necrotic in the mammary gland, presumably due to spontaneous aging, the process of diapedesis, and the interaction with milk components.

Mutations in mismatch repair genes, like those found in Lynch syndrome, can lead to resistance against platins, meaning that chemotherapy with platins is ineffective in people with these mutations.

5|$|The {{fact that}} {{inflammation}} in DPB persists {{with or without}} the presence of P.aeruginosa and H.influenzae provides a means to determine several mechanisms of DPB pathogenesis. Leukotrienes are eicosanoids, signaling molecules made from essential fatty acids, which play a role in many lung diseases by causing the proliferation of inflammatory cells and excess mucus production in the airways. In DPB and other lung diseases, the predominant mediator of neutrophil-related inflammation is leukotriene B4, which specializes in <b>neutrophil</b> proliferation via chemotaxis (the movement of some types of cells toward or away from certain molecules).|$|E

40|$|Leukotriene B(4) (LTB(4)) is an {{important}} proinflammatory lipid mediator generated by <b>neutrophils</b> upon activation.

40|$|In the airways {{of severe}} asthmatics, an {{increase}} of <b>neutrophils</b> and eosinophils is often observed despite high-dose corticosteroid therapy. We previously reported that interleukin- 8 -stimulated <b>neutrophils</b> induced trans-basement membrane migration (TBM) of eosinophils, suggesting the link between <b>neutrophils</b> and eosinophils. Concentrations of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the airway increase in severe asthma. As <b>neutrophils</b> express Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 and can release chemoattractants for eosinophils, we investigated whether LPS-stimulated <b>neutrophils</b> modify eosinophil TBM. <b>Neutrophils</b> and eosinophils were isolated from peripheral blood of healthy volunteers and severe asthmatics. Eosinophil TBM was examined using a modified Boyden's chamber technique. Eosinophils {{were added to the}} upper compartment, and <b>neutrophils</b> and LPS were added to the lower compartment. Migrated eosinophils were measured by eosinophil peroxidase assays. LPS-stimulated <b>neutrophils</b> induced eosinophil TBM (about 10 -fold increase), although LPS or <b>neutrophils</b> alone did not. A leukotriene B 4 receptor antagonist, a platelet-activating factor receptor antagonist or an anti-TLR 4 antibody decreased eosinophil TBM enhanced by LPS-stimulated <b>neutrophils</b> by almost half. <b>Neutrophils</b> from severe asthmatics induced eosinophil TBM and lower concentrations of LPS augmented neutrophil-induced eosinophil TBM.

5|$|With {{erythromycin}} {{therapy in}} DPB, great reduction in bronchiolar inflammation and damage is achieved through suppression {{of not only}} <b>neutrophil</b> proliferation, but also lymphocyte activity and obstructive mucus and water secretions in airways. The antibiotic effects of macrolides {{are not involved in}} their beneficial effects toward reducing inflammation in DPB. This is evident because the treatment dosage is much too low to fight infection, and in DPB cases with the occurrence of macrolide-resistant P.aeruginosa, erythromycin therapy still reduces inflammation.|$|E
5|$|Bacterial {{contamination}} {{alone in}} absence of obstruction does not usually result in cholangitis. However increased pressure within the biliary system (above 20 cmH2O) resulting from obstruction in the bile duct widens {{spaces between the}} cells lining the duct, bringing bacterially contaminated bile {{in contact with the}} blood stream. It also adversely affects the function of Kupffer cells, which are specialized macrophage cells that assist in preventing bacteria from entering the biliary system. Finally, increased biliary pressure decreases production of IgA immunoglobulins in the bile. This results in bacteremia (bacteria in the blood stream) and gives rise to the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) comprising fever (often with rigors), tachycardia, increased respiratory rate and increased white blood cell count; SIRS in the presence of suspected or confirmed infection is called sepsis. Biliary obstruction itself disadvantages the immune system and impairs its capability to fight infection, by impairing the function of certain immune system cells (<b>neutrophil</b> granulocytes) and modifying the levels of immune hormones (cytokines).|$|E
5|$|COPD {{develops}} as {{a significant}} and chronic inflammatory response to inhaled irritants. Chronic bacterial infections may also add to this inflammatory state. The inflammatory cells involved include <b>neutrophil</b> granulocytes and macrophages, two types of white blood cell. Those who smoke additionally have Tc1 lymphocyte involvement and some people with COPD have eosinophil involvement {{similar to that in}} asthma. Part of this cell response is brought on by inflammatory mediators such as chemotactic factors. Other processes involved with lung damage include oxidative stress produced by high concentrations of free radicals in tobacco smoke and released by inflammatory cells, and breakdown of the connective tissue of the lungs by proteases that are insufficiently inhibited by protease inhibitors. The destruction of the connective tissue of the lungs is what leads to emphysema, which then contributes to the poor airflow and, finally, poor absorption and release of respiratory gases. General muscle wasting that often occurs in COPD may be partly due to inflammatory mediators released by the lungs into the blood.|$|E
40|$|The {{urokinase}} receptor (uPAR) {{plays an}} important role in regulation of fibronolysis, cell migration, and adhesion. In this study, we examined whether uPAR plays a role in modulating efferocytosis of <b>neutrophils.</b> Macrophages from uPAR−/− mice demonstrated enhanced ability to engulf viable wild-type (WT) <b>neutrophils</b> in vitro and in vivo in the lungs. The increased phagocytic activity of uPAR−/− macrophages was abrogated by incubation with soluble uPAR (suPAR), arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) –containing peptides, or anti-integrin antibodies. There was increased uptake of viable uPAR−/− <b>neutrophils</b> by WT macrophages. Incubation of uPAR−/− <b>neutrophils</b> with suPAR or anti-integrin antibodies diminished uptake by WT macrophages to baseline. Uptake of uPAR−/− <b>neutrophils</b> by uPAR−/− macrophages was not enhanced. However, incubation of uPAR−/− <b>neutrophils</b> or uPAR−/− macrophages, but not both, with suPAR enhanced the uptake of viable uPAR−/− <b>neutrophils</b> by uPAR−/− macrophages. The adhesion of WT <b>neutrophils</b> to uPAR−/− macrophages was higher than to WT macrophages. uPAR−/− <b>neutrophils</b> demonstrated increased adhesion to suPAR, which was abrogated by blocking of low-density lipoprotein related protein and integrins. Expression of uPAR on the surface of apoptotic <b>neutrophils</b> was reduced compared with levels on viable <b>neutrophils.</b> These results demonstrate a novel role for uPAR in modulating recognition and clearance of <b>neutrophils...</b>|$|R
40|$|Background/Aims: Cystic {{fibrosis}} (CF) {{is dominated}} by chronic inflammation and infection of the lung resulting in lung destruction and early death of patients. The lungs of CF patients are characterized by a massive accumulation of <b>neutrophils.</b> It requires definition why these massive numbers of <b>neutrophils</b> fail to eliminate typical CF pathogens like Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) in CF lungs. Methods: We determined ceramide, sphingosine and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in <b>neutrophils</b> from wildtype and CF mice and determined the effect of sphingosine and ROS alone or in combination on killing of different P. aeruginosa strains. Results: We demonstrate that wildtype <b>neutrophils</b> are able to kill non-mucoid and mucoid clinical P. aeruginosa strains, while <b>neutrophils</b> from CF mice are insufficient to kill these P. aeruginosa strains, although both types of <b>neutrophils</b> infected with P. aeruginosa produce comparable levels of superoxide. All three analyzed P. aeruginosa strains are resistant to reactive oxygen species. The inability of CF <b>neutrophils</b> to kill P. aeruginosa {{is caused by a}} marked decrease of surface sphingosine levels in CF <b>neutrophils.</b> Wildtype <b>neutrophils</b> contain much higher concentrations of surface sphingosine than CF <b>neutrophils.</b> Further, wildtype <b>neutrophils,</b> but not CF <b>neutrophils,</b> release sphingosine, most likely as microparticles, upon infection. Sphingosine kills P. aeruginosa in vitro at low micromolar concentrations. Reconstitution of sphingosine in CF <b>neutrophils</b> restores their ability to kill these pathogens, demonstrating the significance of sphingosine for bacterial killing. Conclusion: The data provide evidence for a new paradigm explaining how <b>neutrophils</b> kill ROS-resistant P. aeruginosa, i. e. by sphingosine that kills P. aeruginosa at low concentrations. This mechanism is defective in CF <b>neutrophils...</b>|$|R

40|$|Infection with {{different}} Leishmania spp. protozoa {{can lead to}} a variety of clinical syndromes associated in many cases with inflammatory responses in the skin. Although macrophages harbor the majority of parasites throughout chronic infection, <b>neutrophils</b> are the first inflammatory cells to migrate to the site of infection.

Based on the hypothesis that <b>neutrophils</b> contribute to a systemic inflammatory state in humans with symptomatic L. braziliensis infection, we evaluated the phenotype of <b>neutrophils</b> from patients with cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) during the course of L. braziliensis infection. After in vitro infection with L. braziliensis, CL patient <b>neutrophils</b> produced more reactive oxygen species (ROS) and higher levels of CXCL 8 and CXCL 9, chemokines associated with recruitment of <b>neutrophils</b> and Th 1 -type cells, than <b>neutrophils</b> from control healthy subjects (HS). Despite this, CL patient and HS <b>neutrophils</b> were equally capable of phagocytosis of L. braziliensis. There was no difference between the degree of activation of <b>neutrophils</b> from CL versus healthy subjects, assessed by CD 66 b and CD 62 L expression using flow cytometry. Of interest, these studies revealed that both parasite-infected and bystander <b>neutrophils</b> became activated during incubation with L. braziliensis. The enhanced ROS and chemokine production in <b>neutrophils</b> from CL patients reverted to baseline after treatment of disease.
