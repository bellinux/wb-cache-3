5|$|Murphy {{was born}} in Douglas and raised in Ballintemple, two suburbs of Cork. His father, Brendan, works for the Irish Department of Education, and his mother is a French teacher. <b>Not</b> <b>only</b> <b>are</b> his parents educators, but his aunts and uncles are also teachers, as was his grandfather. Musicianship also runs in the family, and Murphy started playing music and writing songs {{at the age of}} 10.|$|E
5|$|<b>Not</b> <b>only</b> <b>are</b> groups {{useful to}} assess the {{implications}} of symmetries in molecules, but surprisingly they also predict that molecules sometimes can change symmetry. The Jahn-Teller effect is a distortion of a molecule of high symmetry when it adopts a particular ground state of lower symmetry from a set of possible ground states {{that are related to}} each other by the symmetry operations of the molecule.|$|E
5|$|In over 60 {{years of}} history, the {{university}} has held among its students, faculty, and staff, many notable people, including politicians, scientists, and artists. This includes the current governor of Nariño Antonio Navarro Wolff, and {{the former governor of}} Valle del Cauca Gustavo Álvarez Gardeazábal, who <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>are</b> alumni of the university, but at one point in time were also faculty members. The former Ministry of the Interior and Justice and ambassador of Colombia in Italy, Sabas Pretelt de la Vega, attended the university as well.|$|E

5|$|Needle {{receiving}} tubes: A hollow tube made of metal, shatter-resistant {{glass or}} plastic, needle receiving tubes, like forceps, {{are used to}} support the tissue at the piercing site and are common in septum and some cartilage piercings. <b>Not</b> <b>only</b> <b>are</b> these tubes intended to support the tissue, but they also receive the needle once it has passed through the tissue, offering protection from the sharp point. Needle receiving tubes are not used in the freehand piercing method.|$|E
5|$|The Theban plays {{consist of}} three plays: Oedipus Rex (also called Oedipus Tyrannus or Oedipus the King), Oedipus at Colonus and Antigone. All three plays concern {{the fate of}} Thebes {{during and after the}} reign of King Oedipus. They have often been {{published}} under a single cover. Sophocles, however, wrote the three plays for separate festival competitions, many years apart. <b>Not</b> <b>only</b> <b>are</b> the Theban plays not a true trilogy (three plays presented as a continuous narrative) but they are not even an intentional series and contain some inconsistencies among them. He also wrote other plays having to do with Thebes, such as the Epigoni, of which only fragments have survived.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} of these large KBOs in orbits similar to Pluto's led many to conclude that, aside from its relative size, Pluto {{was not particularly}} different from {{other members of the}} Kuiper belt. <b>Not</b> <b>only</b> <b>are</b> these objects similar to Pluto in size, but many also have satellites, and are of similar composition (methane and carbon monoxide have been found both on Pluto and on the largest KBOs). Thus, just as Ceres was considered a planet before the {{discovery of}} its fellow asteroids, some began to suggest that Pluto might also be reclassified.|$|E

5|$|The {{songs of}} {{mainland}} goldcrests vary only slightly across their range and {{consist of a}} single song type, but much more divergence {{has occurred in the}} isolated Macaronesian populations. <b>Not</b> <b>only</b> <b>are</b> there variations between islands and within an island, but individual males on the Azores can have up to three song types. The dialects on the Azores fall into two main groups, neither of which elicited a response from male European goldcrests in playback experiments. There are also two main dialect groups on the Canary islands, a widespread group similar to the European version, and another that is restricted to the mountains of Tenerife. The song variations have been used to investigate the colonisation pattern of the Macaronesian islands by goldcrests, and identified a previously unknown subspecies.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the fact}} that the {{selection}} of a volatile hassium compound (hassium tetroxide) for gas-phase chemical studies was clear from the beginning, the chemical characterization of hassium was considered a difficult task for a long time. Although hassium isotopes were first synthesized in 1984, it was not until 1996 that a hassium isotope long-lived enough to allow chemical studies to be performed was synthesized. Unfortunately, this hassium isotope, 269Hs, was then synthesized indirectly from the decay of 277Cn; <b>not</b> <b>only</b> <b>are</b> indirect synthesis methods not favourable for chemical studies, but also the reaction that produced the isotope 277Cn had a low yield (its cross-section was only 1 pb), and thus did not provide enough hassium atoms for a chemical investigation. The direct synthesis of 269Hs and 270Hs in the reaction 248Cm(26Mg,xn)274−xHs (x = 4 or 5) appeared more promising, as the cross-section for this reaction was somewhat larger, at 7 pb. This yield was still around ten times lower than that for the reaction used for the chemical characterization of bohrium. New techniques for irradiation, separation, and detection had to be introduced before hassium could be successfully characterized chemically as a typical member of group 8 in early 2001.|$|E
5|$|The {{principal}} {{threats to}} cockatoos are habitat loss and the wildlife trade. All cockatoos {{are dependent on}} trees for nesting and are vulnerable to their loss; in addition many species have specialised habitat requirements or live on small islands and have naturally small ranges, making them vulnerable {{to the loss of}} these habitats. Cockatoos are popular as pets and the capture and trade has threatened some species; between 1983 and 1990, 66,654 recorded salmon-crested cockatoos were exported from Indonesia, a figure that does not include the number of birds caught for the domestic trade or that were exported illegally. The capture of many species has subsequently been banned but the trade continues illegally. Birds are put in crates or bamboo tubing and conveyed on boats out of Indonesia and the Philippines. <b>Not</b> <b>only</b> <b>are</b> the rare species smuggled out of Indonesia but also common and rare cockatoos alike are smuggled out of Australia; birds are sedated, covered in nylon stockings and packed into PVC tubing which is then placed in unaccompanied luggage on international flights. Mortality is significant (30%) and eggs, more easily hidden on the bodies of smugglers on flights, are increasingly smuggled instead. Trafficking is thought to be run by organised gangs, who also trade Australian species for overseas species such as macaws coming the other way.|$|E
