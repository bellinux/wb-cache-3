5|$|As Minister of Education, ML Pin {{established}} the Regional Education Development Project including higher education, which aimed {{to study the}} needs and limitations of education systems in the provinces. Spanning over two years, results of the project included the improvement of cooperation between government officials and Muslim locals in the four southernmost provinces, recognition {{of the need for}} children living near the Malay and Cambodian borders to be able to learn the Thai language before starting school, and the experimental development of a curriculum based on learners' <b>needs</b> <b>and</b> <b>interests</b> at Suranaree School.|$|E
5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1861, Maeser left the Lyceum and was offered a {{position}} at the Union Academy, established by Brigham Young. This academy was intended for students above elementary grades. Young appointed Maeser head of the school in February 1861. Maeser {{was concerned about the}} school systems meeting the <b>needs</b> <b>and</b> <b>interests</b> of its students, and he left the Union Academy to teach in other schools and seminaries, including the Twentieth Ward Seminary, which he founded in 1862. The school became a well-known training school for teachers.|$|E
5|$|In February 2006, {{during the}} interim between the show's GLAAD Media Award {{nomination}} and the awards ceremony, T.J. Jourian {{was interviewed by}} Larry King on the CNN talk show Larry King Live, along with trans man Aiden Key; trans women Brenda Chevis and Jennifer Finney Boylan; sexologist Michelle Angello; and Felicity Huffman, star of the 2005 film Transamerica. Jourian talked about his past, cultural barriers to acceptance, {{and what it means}} to be a trans man. The interviews were parodied in a comedy sketch on the March 4 episode of Saturday Night Live, in which Natalie Portman played Jourian. T.J. Jourian has since become a speaker and consultant concerned with the <b>needs</b> <b>and</b> <b>interests</b> of students, queer and transgender people, and people of color.|$|E

5|$|The Danubian {{emperors}} {{ruled the}} empire {{for over a}} century, until 379. Indeed, until 363, power was held by descendants {{of one of the}} original Junta members. Constantine I' s father, Constantius Chlorus, was a Caesar (deputy emperor) in Diocletian's Tetrarchy. Constantine's grandson Julian ruled until 363. These emperors restored the army to its former strength and effectiveness, but were solely concerned with the <b>needs</b> <b>and</b> <b>interests</b> of the military. They were also divorced from the wealthy Roman senatorial families that dominated the Senate and owned much of the empire's land. This in turn bred a feeling of alienation from the army among the Roman aristocracy which in the later 4th century began to resist the military's exorbitant demands for recruits and supplies.|$|E
5|$|The {{series was}} pitched to the Nine Network through Harris and Graeme-Evans' joint {{independent}} production company, Kids Like Us. A pilot was filmed in mid-1998, which {{was shown to}} a test audience. No changes to the format were made after this test. After being commissioned, the first full series began production in October. The Nine Network initially signed a co-venture with Kids Like Us to produce two 45-episode series of the show and the first went to air on Nine in April 1999. Hi-5 was granted a P classification, deeming it specifically {{designed to meet the}} <b>needs</b> <b>and</b> <b>interests</b> of pre-schoolers, allowing it to be broadcast on the Nine Network with a 30-minute runtime commercial-free. The first series was produced for US$20,000 to US$30,000 for each episode.|$|E
5|$|In 354BC, Demosthenes {{delivered}} his first political oration, On the Navy, {{in which he}} espoused moderation and proposed the reform of the symmoriai (boards) {{as a source of}} funding for the Athenian fleet. In 352BC, he delivered For the Megalopolitans and, in 351BC, On the Liberty of the Rhodians. In both speeches he opposed Eubulus, the most powerful Athenian statesman of the period 355 to 342BC. The latter was no pacifist but came to eschew a policy of aggressive interventionism {{in the internal affairs of}} the other Greek cities. Contrary to Eubulus's policy, Demosthenes called for an alliance with Megalopolis against Sparta or Thebes, and for supporting the democratic faction of the Rhodians in their internal strife. His arguments revealed his desire to articulate Athens's <b>needs</b> <b>and</b> <b>interests</b> through a more activist foreign policy, wherever opportunity might provide.|$|E

25|$|In 1962, {{the town}} of Derry {{negotiated}} a long-term contractual agreement with Pinkerton Academy. The contract specified the terms and conditions under which Pinkerton's services were purchased. Over the next thirty years, additional communities (Chester, Hampstead, Auburn, Londonderry and Windham) signed service contracts with the academy. In response to the increased number of public school students attending Pinkerton, new facilities were built. Due to the changing <b>needs</b> <b>and</b> <b>interests</b> of this larger student population, Pinkerton once again developed new courses and fields of study while maintaining its existing college preparatory programs. In 1978, the citizens of Londonderry voted to end their tuition agreements with the academy and established Londonderry High School. Students from Windham also no longer attend Pinkerton Academy and now attend Windham High School which opened in 2009.|$|E

25|$|Among {{the notable}} {{features}} of Baghdad {{during this period}} were its exceptional libraries. Many of the Abbasid caliphs were patrons of learning and enjoyed collecting both ancient and contemporary literature. Although some of the princes of the previous Umayyad dynasty had begun to gather and translate Greek scientific literature, the Abbasids {{were the first to}} foster Greek learning on a large scale. Many of these libraries were private collections intended only {{for the use of the}} owners and their immediate friends, but the libraries of the caliphs and other officials soon took on a public or a semi-public character. Four great libraries were established in Baghdad during this period. The earliest was that of the famous Al Mamun, who was caliph from 813 to 833. Another was established by Sabur Ibn Ardashir in 991 or 993 for the literary men and scholars who frequented his academy. Unfortunately, this second library was plundered and burned by the Seljuks only seventy years after it was established. This was a good example of the sort of library built up out of the <b>needs</b> <b>and</b> <b>interests</b> of a literary society. The last two were examples of madrasa or theological college libraries. The Nizamiyah was founded by the Persian Nizam al Mulk, who was vizier of two early Seljuk sultans. It continued to operate even after the coming of the Mongols in 1258. The Mustansiriyah madrasa, which owned an exceedingly rich library, was founded by Al Mustansir, the second last Abbasid caliph, who died in 1242. This would prove to be the last great library built by the caliphs of Baghdad.|$|E

30|$|There is an {{increasing}} <b>need</b> <b>and</b> <b>interest</b> of construction of high-rise buildings in urban areas. This trend will be accelerated in the future.
