5|$|According to the Indonesian film scholar Misbach Yusa Biran, {{the films}} {{released}} {{during this period}} could not be classified as truly Indonesian films as there was <b>no</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> nationalism within them. The American visual anthropologist Karl G. Heider writes that all films from before 1950 are lost. However, JB Kristanto's Katalog Film Indonesia (Indonesian Film Catalogue) records several as having survived at Sinematek Indonesia's archives, and Biran writes that several Japanese propaganda films have survived at the Netherlands Government Information Service.|$|E

She also reveals that she has <b>no</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> smell or taste and has cut back on cigarettes, now smoking only after meals and after episodes of MacGyver. Selma sends the Simpsons a tape of their honeymoon, {{including}} Sideshow Bob's tirade over {{the absence of a}} gas fireplace in their hotel room. Bart realizes that Selma has one hour to live and the Simpsons rush to the hotel room.|$|E
5|$|Anwar Sadat was {{convinced}} that a regiment reinforced with aircraft could firmly secure Al-Sallal and his free officer movement, but within three months of sending troops to Yemen, Nasser realized that this would require a larger commitment than anticipated. A little less than 5,000 troops were sent in October 1962. Two months later, Egypt had 15,000 regular troops deployed. By late 1963, the number was increased to 36,000; and in late 1964, the number rose to 50,000 Egyptian troops in Yemen. In late 1965, the Egyptian troop commitment in Yemen was at 55,000 troops, which were broken into 13 infantry regiments of one artillery division, one tank division and several Special Forces as well as paratroop regiments. Ahmed Abu-Zeid, who served as Egypt's ambassador to royalist Yemen from 1957 to 1961, sent numerous reports on Yemen that did not reach Ministry of Defense officials. He warned Egyptian officials in Cairo, including Defense Minister Amer, that the tribes were difficult and had <b>no</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> loyalty or nationhood. He opposed sending Egyptian combat forces and, arguing that only money and equipment {{be sent to the}} Yemeni Free Officers, and warned that the Saudis would finance the royalists.|$|E

5|$|For {{the most}} part Cage avoids using lower {{registers}} of the piano, {{and much of the}} music's melodic foreground lies in the soprano range. Of the forty-five prepared notes, only three belong to the three lowest octaves below F#3: D3, D2 and D1. Furthermore, D2 is prepared {{in such a way that}} the resulting sound has the frequency of a D4 (resulting in two variants of D4 available, one more prepared than the other). The portion of the keyboard above F#3 is divided into roughly three registers: low, middle, and high. The low register has the heaviest preparation, and the high register the lightest. Different methods are used: certain notes produce sounds that retain the original frequency and a pianistic character; others become drum-like sounds, detuned versions of the original notes, or metallic, rattling sounds that have <b>no</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> the fundamental frequency at all. The use of the soft pedal, which makes the hammers strike only two of the three strings of each note (or one, for notes with only two strings), complicates the matter further. For example, the note C5 is a metallic sound with no fundamental discernible when the soft pedal is depressed, but it sounds fairly normal if the pedal is released. It appears that Cage was fully aware of the implications of this: certain sonatas feature interplay between two versions of one note, others place special emphasis on particular notes, and still others are very dependent on particular note combinations.|$|E

Instead of running away, as she should have, {{she decides to}} ask lots of questions with extreme curiosity. This makes Edward {{believe that it is}} not bad luck that follows her around, but that she has <b>no</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> self-preservation. Bella isn't very rational nor sensible as she lacks common sense and street intelligence.|$|E

25|$|Netball is a {{very popular}} women's sport in South Africa. While {{participation}} rates are high, there is <b>no</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> collective identity by players as netballers and {{being part of a}} national netball community. In 2002, 40% of African girls rated netball as their favourite sport and 19% of coloured girls like netball best. Many African girls claim netball as their favourite sport even if they have never played it.|$|E

25|$|In 2012, {{the website}} {{contained}} over 6000 articles.

Their image of God is very close to Barry White.|$|E
25|$|Symonds's {{mother died}} when he was only four years old, and his father had a {{powerful}} influence upon the formation of his character. The fashionable Freudian theory that a man's homosexuality is caused by a close-binding-intimate mother and a weak-or-absent father is put to rout by Symonds's childhood, in which the opposite was the case. Admittedly there were mostly women in the household, governesses, aunts, and eventually four sisters, but he records <b>no</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> being overwhelmed by the feminine atmosphere, and was fairly indifferent to their presence.|$|E
25|$|Henry S. Commager, {{a scholar}} of the Revolutionary War, {{maintains}} that the best American accounts of the battle were recorded by ordinary soldiers and from civilian onlookers. British accounts however were primarily recorded by British generals such as Generals Howe, Gage and Burgoyne. He further maintains that the British accounts, although well written and chronicled, seemed {{as if they were}} prepared to be read in Parliament. The American accounts of the battle, though generally lacking in formal presentation, were direct and definitive, and possessed <b>no</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> defeat or despair, though somewhat lacking in overall organization, reflecting the unconventional fighting style of the Americans. The witness accounts of both the Americans and the British naturally lent themselves to a fair measure of national pride respectively.|$|E

25|$|In early Western medieval art {{interest}} in landscape disappears almost entirely, kept alive only in copies of Late Antique {{works such as}} the Utrecht Psalter; the last reworking of this source, in an early Gothic version, reduces the previously extensive landscapes to a few trees filling gaps in the composition, with <b>no</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> overall space. A revival in {{interest in}} nature initially mainly manifested itself in depictions of small gardens such as the Hortus Conclusus or those in millefleur tapestries. The frescos of figures at work or play {{in front of a}} background of dense trees in the Palace of the Popes, Avignon are probably a unique survival of what was a common subject. Several frescos of gardens have survived from Roman houses like the Villa of Livia.|$|E
25|$|Back in the present, an {{encounter}} with Kulan Gath results in Pym being split into his two personas of Pym and Yellowjacket, after a spell cast by Gath temporarily transforms Pym into a swashbuckler-style Yellowjacket, followed by the Yellowjacket persona manifesting a physical presence from the extradimensional bio-mass Pym uses to grow. After the Giant-Man Pym spends some time appearing almost emotionally stunted, reciting facts with <b>no</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> emotional depth even when facing the new threat of a supercharged Count Nefaria, the Yellowjacket Pym replaces him, only for his impulsive nature to making a situation worse when Diablo turns an entire village into variations of the Hulk, Yellowjacket's plan to stop the Hulks resulting in them merging into one massive Hulk before he can shrink {{it down to a}} more manageable level. The two versions begin to deteriorate from being apart, but are restored when the Wasp helps the two halves realize they need each other. Pym is eventually able to resolve his problems and adopts his Yellowjacket persona once again.|$|E
25|$|From {{the start}} Genie showed {{interest}} in many hospital staff members, often approaching and walking with complete strangers, but Kent {{said she did}} not seem to distinguish between people and showed no signs of attachment to anybody, including her mother and brother. At first she would not allow anyone to touch her, quickly shying away from any physical contact, and while she sat on her mother's lap when requested she remained very tense and got up as quickly as possible; hospital staff wrote that her mother seemed entirely oblivious to Genie's emotions and actions. Genie's behavior was typically highly antisocial, and proved extremely difficult for others to control. Regardless of where she was she constantly salivated and spat, and continually sniffed and blew her nose on anything that happened to be nearby. She had <b>no</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> personal property, frequently pointing to or taking something she wanted from someone else, or situational awareness. Doctors wrote that she acted on impulse irrespective of the setting, especially noting that she frequently engaged in open masturbation and would sometimes attempt to involve older men in it.|$|E
