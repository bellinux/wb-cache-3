50|$|The Epiphone Goth Thunderbird {{is similar}} to the Epiphone Thunderbird IV. However, it has a {{mahogany}} body, a Celtic Cross symbol on the pickguard, and is finished in a 'Pitch Black' <b>non-gloss</b> flat finish.|$|E

5000|$|The Commando was {{a wartime}} {{variant of the}} Official Police, {{manufactured}} with either a two or four inch barrel, and incorporating several production economies including a <b>non-gloss</b> Parkerized finish. The Commando also lacked the usual metal checkering on the hammer, trigger, and cylinder latch, {{as well as the}} reflection-deadening treatment of the commercial version’s top strap. In addition, plastic material replaced the wood grips of the civilian model. [...] Approximately 48,611 Commando revolvers were purchased by the government during World War II. [...] Of this total, approximately 12,800 Commando revolvers were issued to various intelligence services such as US Military intelligence and the Office of Strategic Services (OSS). Many of the latter were procured with the two-inch barrel, referred to as the “Junior Commando”. A few Commandos saw service overseas in the war zone. Regular production deliveries of two-inch [...] "Junior Commando" [...] revolvers began in March 1943, at approximately serial number 9,000. More than 12,000 of the two-inch Commandos encountered today are actually postwar conversions from four-inch models produced during the war.|$|E
50|$|The French quires 1, 2, and 4 {{have been}} {{produced}} on very thin white material unique to this volume. Opposed to the Latin calendar written on much heavier, <b>non-glossed,</b> parchment that’s quite yellowed. These discrepancies found within the Psalter portion of the manuscript, help identify the French, Latin, and Greek texts within.|$|R
40|$|Vocabulary {{development}} is significant for mastering a second/foreign language. There are several approaches for vocabulary instruction, including glossing. Glossing is a context-based technique that represents information on target words via definitions, explanations, synonyms, pictures, sounds, and videos. Glossing {{can also be}} used electronically through texts, pictures, audios, and video/animations. Studies on different gloss combinations in multimedia learning environments have led investigators to inconclusive findings. The present study examined which mode(s) of gloss presentation (L 2 definition, aural, and video/animation) is effective for learners’ short and long-term vocabulary learning and retention. Utilizing a mixed methods approach, 132 intermediate language learners formed one control and three experimental groups. The experimental groups received target words in different glossing modes; the control group received no glossing instruction. ANCOVA and paired samples t-test were used to analyze the pre/post-test data. Learners’ attitudes and perceptions towards glossing modes were also examined through a questionnaire and interviews. The results showed that glossing was significantly more effective than <b>non-glossing</b> strategy for participants’ short-term retention in both productive recall and multiple-choice productive recognition tests; and partially effective for their long-term retention. Additionally, in both vocabulary measurements, L 2 definition and video/animation glossing as well as L 2 definition and audio glossing were more effective than L 2 definition alone for most test sessions; but since L 2 definition alone was also effective for few test sessions, the findings cannot be generalized largely. The results of the questionnaire and interviews showed that the participants preferred L 2 definition and video/animation glossing over the two other modes...|$|R
