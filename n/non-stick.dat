5|$|Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), {{sometimes}} called by its DuPont name Teflon, represents 60–80% by {{mass of the}} world's fluoropolymer production. The largest application is in electrical insulation since PTFE is an excellent dielectric. It is also used in the chemical industry where corrosion resistance is needed, in coating pipes, tubing, and gaskets. Another major use is in PFTE-coated fiberglass cloth for stadium roofs. The major consumer application is for <b>non-stick</b> cookware. Jerked PTFE film becomes expanded PTFE (ePTFE), a fine-pored membrane sometimes referred to by the brand name Gore-Tex and used for rainwear, protective apparel, and filters; ePTFE fibers may be made into seals and dust filters. Other fluoropolymers, including fluorinated ethylene propylene, mimic PTFE's properties and can substitute for it; they are more moldable, but also more costly and have lower thermal stability. Films from two different fluoropolymers replace glass in solar cells.|$|E

The high hardness of coating, which typically is in range of 7. 5 to 9. 0 GPa, resists abrasion by glass fibers. <b>Non-sticking</b> behavior of this new class of materials which theoretically has been related to their low surface tension, should also offer lower coefficient of adhesion friction to the plastic materials during the ejection phase of the process.

The main objective of this research was to reduce the coefficient of adhesive friction through the development of a process to deposit plasma-sprayed quasicrystalline coating on surfaces of injection molding die cavities. The effects of cavity depths and draft angle on ejection forces required in the coated and uncoated molds for part release were also examined.;Two molds were designed and manufactured for this purpose and five polymers (PP, ABS, PET, PS, and PU) were used to conduct the experiments.

The ejection force values obtained in experimental procedures using pressure transducer can quantitatively represent the real amount of force exerted on the ejector pin.;Quasicrystallie coating reduced the forces from 20 to 24 percent.
