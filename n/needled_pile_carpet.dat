50|$|The {{quality of}} cut <b>pile</b> <b>carpets</b> is {{improved}} significantly by {{a reduction of}} inner tensions in the yarn. This essential benefit results {{from the effects of}} steaming and heatsetting.|$|R

2500|$|The knotted <b>pile</b> <b>carpet</b> {{probably}} {{originated in}} the 3rd or 2nd millennium BC in West Asia, perhaps the Caspian Sea area (Northern Iran) [...] or the Armenian Highland, although {{there is evidence of}} goats and sheep being sheared for wool and hair which was spun and woven as far back at the 7th millennium. The earliest surviving <b>pile</b> <b>carpet</b> is the [...] "Pazyryk carpet", which dates from the 5th-4th century BC. It was excavated by Sergei Ivanovich Rudenko in 1949 from a Pazyryk burial mound in the Altai Mountains in Siberia. This richly coloured carpet is 200 x 183cm (6'6" [...] x 6'0") and framed by a border of griffins.|$|R

40|$|Research was {{conducted}} in an experimental room to measure the effect of human activity on airborne dispersal of settled fungal spores from carpet and vinyl tile flooring. A series of experiments were conducted in which commercial loop <b>pile</b> <b>carpet,</b> residential cut <b>pile</b> <b>carpet,</b> or vinyl tile installed in the experimental room were contaminated with Penicillium chrysogenum spores. The flooring materials were contaminated to two different levels (106 and 107 colony forming units per square meter [c. f. u. /m 2] of flooring surface). Airborne culturable and total P. chrysogenum concentrations were measured using Andersen single-stage impactor samplers and Burkard personal slide impactor samplers, respectively. Bioaerosol concentrations were measured at floor level, 1 meter, and the adult breathing zone (1. 5 meter) heights before and after human activity consisting of walking in a prescribed pattern for 1 minute in the room. Airborne P. chrysogenum concentrations were greater with the higher surface loading for all three flooring materials. For all flooring materials {{there was no significant}} difference between sampler locations, although the data from the 1 -meter location were the highest, followed by the floor level and the breathing zone locations, respectively. The data from these experiments indicate that while a very small fraction of culturable P. chrysogenum spores present on flooring materials were aerosolized by walking, relatively high airborne concentrations of spores maybe re-entrained from contaminated materials. The airborne P. chrysogenum concentrations were significantly higher after walking on cut <b>pile</b> <b>carpet</b> than with the other two flooring materials at both contamination levels, with the differences in concentration often ≥ 2 orders of magnitude. No differences were measured in airborne culturable P. chrysogenum between vinyl flooring and loop <b>pile</b> <b>carpet</b> at both contamination levels. Total spore data from the experiments with the 107 c. f. u. /m 2 contamination level indicated that walking on loop <b>pile</b> <b>carpet</b> produced higher airborne spore concentrations than similarly contaminated vinyl tile although no significant difference was observed at the 106 c. f. u. /m 2 level...|$|R

5000|$|The Armenian {{words for}} carpet are [...] "karpet" [...] (կարպետ) or [...] "gorg" [...] (գորգ). Though both words in Armenian are synonymous, word [...] "karpet" [...] is mostly used for non-pile rugs and [...] "gorg" [...] {{is for a}} <b>pile</b> <b>carpet.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Machine-woven carpets like Axminster and Wilton {{are made}} by massive looms that weave {{together}} ‘bobbins’ of carpet yarn and backing. The finished result, which can be intricately patterned, creates a floor that provides supreme underfoot luxury with high performance. Tufted carpets are also popular in the home. They are relatively speedy to make - a pre-woven backing has yarns tufted into it. Needles push the yarn through the backing and which is then held in place with underlying [...] "loopers". Tufted carpets can be twist pile, velvet, or loop <b>pile.</b> Twist <b>pile</b> <b>carpets</b> are produced when one or more fibres are twisted in the tufting process, {{so that in the}} finished carpet they appear to be bound together. Velvet <b>pile</b> <b>carpets</b> tend to have a shorter pile and a tighter construction, giving the finished article a smooth, velvety appearance. Loop <b>pile</b> <b>carpets</b> are renowned for being hard wearing and lend carpets great texture. The traditional domain of rugs from far away continents, hand knotted squares and rugs use the expertise of weavers to produce work of the finest quality. Traditional rugs often feature a deliberate ‘mistake’ on behalf of the weaver to guarantee their authenticity.|$|R

25|$|Silk is an {{expensive}} material, and {{has been used for}} representative carpets. Its tensile strength has been used in silk warps, but silk also appears in the <b>carpet</b> <b>pile.</b> Silk pile can be used to highlight special elements of the design. High-quality carpets from Kashan, Qum, Nain, and Isfahan have all-silk <b>piles.</b> Silk <b>pile</b> <b>carpets</b> are often exceptionally fine, with a short pile and an elaborate design. Silk pile is less resistant to mechanical stress, thus, all-silk piles are often used as wall hangings, or pillows.|$|R
5000|$|Within {{the group}} of oriental carpets, the Turkish carpet is {{distinguished}} by particular characteristics of dyes and colours, designs, textures and techniques. Usually made of wool and cotton, Turkish carpets are tied with the [...] "Turkish", or symmetrical knot. Examples {{range in size from}} pillow (yastik) to large, room-sized carpets. The earliest known examples for Turkish carpets date from the thirteenth century. Distinct types of carpets have been woven ever since in workshops, in more provincial weaving facilities, as well as in villages, tribal settlements, or by nomads. Carpets were simultaneously produced for these different levels of society, with varying materials like sheep wool and cotton. No silk <b>piled</b> <b>carpets</b> made in Turkey have been found that were before 1870. Not till the early 20th century were silk <b>pile</b> <b>carpets</b> knotted in Turkey using silver and gold threads with patterns based upon 16th century Imperial Safavid Iranian carpets.|$|R
