Key Concepts The main concepts reviewed in the paper are theoretical “Stage – Gate model” of <b>New</b> <b>Product</b> Design and Development, <b>New</b> <b>Product</b> Development Process followed in automobile industry, role of various departments in the <b>New</b> <b>Product</b> Development Process. Methodology The methodology used to review the concepts exposed in this paper was theoretical research. Conclusion Generic product development process as described by Ulriche & Eppinger sets up overall framework of the product development process but it does not describe the micro-level activities of the <b>new</b> <b>product</b> development process. Whereas the practical process of <b>new</b> <b>product</b> development works out on very micro-level details of the task and activities in <b>new</b> <b>product</b> development process.

While serving a common purpose of providing information about the <b>new</b> <b>product,</b> firms make preannouncements in different ways. For example, the timing of preannouncement and the specific information provided can vary significantly across firms and products. This dissertation examines how different preannouncement strategies influence sales of the <b>new</b> <b>product</b> when it is eventually introduced. I focus on the digital camera market from January 2004 to May 2007. The analysis of preannouncement strategies is made possible by employing a dataset that includes the specific details of the preannouncements made by digital camera producers. Using the control function approach, I find that different preannouncement strategies do matter for <b>new</b> <b>product</b> sales. However, their effects depend on targeted market segments. Specifically, making early <b>new</b> <b>product</b> preannouncements increases sales of premium market products, but making late preannouncements helps mass market products. Furthermore, providing pricing information in preannouncements enhances the sales of premium market products. However, providing specific <b>new</b> <b>product</b> release date has {{a negative impact on}} the sales of premium market products.

5|$|The ice trade {{enabled the}} {{consumption}} {{of a wide range}} of <b>new</b> <b>products</b> during the 19th century. One simple use for natural ice was to chill drinks, either being directly added to the glass or barrel, or indirectly chilling it in a wine cooler or similar container. Iced drinks were a novelty and were initially viewed with concern by customers, worried about the health risks, although this rapidly vanished in the US. By mid-19th century, water was always chilled in America if possible. Iced milk also popular, and German lager, traditionally drunk chilled, also used ice. Drinks such as sherry-cobblers and mint juleps were created that could only be made using crushed ice. There were distinct differences in 19th-century American and European attitudes to adding ice directly to drinks, with the Europeans regarding this as an unpleasant habit; British visitors to India were surprised to see the Anglo-Indian elite prepared to drink iced water. Some Hindus in India regarded ice as unclean for religious reasons, and as such an inappropriate food.|$|E

In comparison, McDonald's kitchen at the time was a more rigidly designed assembly line concept intended to quickly produce a more uniform product and was not easily adapted to <b>new</b> <b>products.</b> This more rigid system prevented McDonald's from broadening its menu to effectively competing with Burger King and other similar chains that were more flexible and were better positioned to expand their menu.|$|E
