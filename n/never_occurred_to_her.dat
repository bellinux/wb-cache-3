500|$|On 31 October 1994 Princess Andrew's two {{surviving}} children, the Duke of Edinburgh and Princess George of Hanover, went to Yad Vashem (the Holocaust Memorial) in Jerusalem {{to witness}} a ceremony honouring her as [...] "Righteous Among the Nations" [...] for having hidden the Cohens in her house in Athens during the Second World War. Prince Philip said of his mother's sheltering of persecuted Jews, [...] "I suspect that it <b>never</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> that her action was in any way special. She was {{a person with a}} deep religious faith, and she would have considered it to be a perfectly natural human reaction to fellow beings in distress." [...] In 2010, the Princess was posthumously named a Hero of the Holocaust by the British Government.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} 1940s, Allen married [...] "the first grown man who asked me", Robert M. Davis, a {{promising}} young singer, and {{they lived in}} Claremont, California, during World War II. It <b>never</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> {{to get into the}} movie business as she had always considered it to be exotic. Allen became a writer by default, and having always read constantly and being able to write pretty well, she decided to [...] "write her way out" [...] of the marriage and set out to become financially independent of her husband. She always claimed her first husband's big fault was marrying someone too young.|$|E
60|$|It had <b>never</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> that Sidney might {{possibly}} marry a plain woman.|$|E
6000|$|... "Exactly," [...] said Madeline. [...] "She is {{just one}} of those English nonentities who would tie her head up in a bag for three months every summer, if her mother and her {{grandmother}} had tied up their heads before <b>her.</b> It would <b>never</b> <b>occur</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> think whether there was any use in submitting to such a nuisance." ...|$|R
6000|$|UNDERSHAFT. Oh, that's everybody's birthright. Look at {{poor little}} Jenny Hill, the Salvation lassie! she would {{think you were}} {{laughing}} at her if you asked <b>her</b> <b>to</b> stand up {{in the street and}} teach grammar or geography or mathematics or even drawingroom dancing; but it <b>never</b> <b>occurs</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> doubt that she can teach morals and religion. You are all alike, you respectable people. You can't tell me the bursting strain of a ten-inch gun, which is a very simple matter; but you all think you can tell me the bursting strain of a man under temptation. You daren't handle high explosives; but you're all ready to handle honesty and truth and justice and the whole duty of man, and kill one another at that game. What a country! what a world! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Indeed," [...] Hilda answered, {{turning once}} more <b>to</b> <b>her</b> book. Lady Meadowcroft looked annoyed. It would <b>never</b> have <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> {{that within a}} few weeks she was <b>to</b> owe <b>her</b> life <b>to</b> that very abstruse work, and what Hilda had read in it.|$|R
60|$|He {{could have}} bitten his tongue {{out for that}} question, but its {{significance}} <b>never</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b>|$|E
60|$|He spoke quickly, {{his tone}} was full of nervous passion. It <b>never</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> to doubt him.|$|E
60|$|The lady {{almost fell}} back {{on the floor in}} her astonishment. The idea had <b>never</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b>|$|E
60|$|Barbara {{discovered}} that <b>her</b> task was <b>to</b> {{be a difficult}} one {{if she were to}} accomplish it without wounding the man's feelings; but she determined to strike while the iron was hot and risk offending him--why she should be interested in the regeneration of Mr. Billy Byrne it <b>never</b> once <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> ask herself. She hesitated a moment before speaking.|$|R
60|$|He {{was troubled}} {{by the thought of}} what she must have borne for it was {{difficult}} to imagine Sylvia engaged in laborious domestic toil. It had <b>never</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> him that <b>her</b> delicate appearance was deceptive.|$|R
6000|$|... 'They are married. They {{have been}} here to see you, and are very sorry. She sat by you, but you did not know her. She was broken down when she {{discovered}} her mother's death, which had <b>never</b> once <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> as being imminent. They have gone away again. I thought it best she should leave, now that you are out of danger. Now you must be quiet till I come and talk again.' ...|$|R
60|$|It <b>never</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> {{as it did}} to him, {{that the}} {{kindness}} might have come sooner. 'I only hope you like it,' she added, after a pause.|$|E
6000|$|... 'It {{is quite}} {{out of the}} question. She is very young, and such a thing has <b>never</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b> And {{we are not the}} same sort of people.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{might catch}} {{some of the}} water that is finding {{its way through the}} roof," [...] Mistress Pemberton said as if such a {{possibility}} had <b>never</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> before.|$|E
6000|$|... [Pippa Passes] Among Browning's longer poems {{there are}} two, at least, that well deserve our study. Pippa Passes, aside from its rare poetical qualities, {{is a study}} of {{unconscious}} influence. The idea of the poem was suggested to Browning while listening to a gypsy girl singing in the woods near his home; but he transfers {{the scene of the}} action to the little mountain town of Asolo, in Italy. Pippa is a little silk weaver, who goes out in the morning <b>to</b> enjoy <b>her</b> one holiday of the whole year. As she thinks of her own happiness she is vaguely wishing that she might share it, and do some good. Then, with her childish imagination, she begins to weave a little romance in which she shares in the happiness of the four greatest and happiest people in Asolo. It <b>never</b> <b>occurs</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> that perhaps there is more of misery than of happiness in the four great ones of whom she dreams; and so she goes on her way singing, ...|$|R
6000|$|The child handily {{converted}} the chair into a couch, arranging the dress and coverings with {{the familiarity of}} long use, and by no means shocked by the contraction and helplessness of the lower limbs, to which {{she had been so}} much accustomed all her life that it <b>never</b> even <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> pity Aunt Ermine, who never treated herself as an object of compassion. She was thanked by a tender pressure on her hair, and then saying-- ...|$|R
60|$|The countess blushed; {{the name}} was a clue which she could follow, but Egremont {{nevertheless}} suspected that the idea had <b>never</b> previously <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b> Lady Joan she described as not beautiful; certainly not beautiful; nobody would consider her beautiful, many would indeed think her quite the reverse; and yet she had a look, one particular look when according to Lady Marney, {{she was more than}} beautiful. But she was very clever, very indeed, something quite extraordinary.|$|R
6000|$|Isabel {{listened to}} this {{assertion}} with some interest; it had <b>never</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> that Mr. Touchett {{was likely to}} discuss her matrimonial prospects with Lord Warburton. [...] "Has he told you that?" ...|$|E
60|$|The {{thought of}} {{what he might have}} been to her, had he taken the chance she had given him, <b>never</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b> This {{possibility}} had already reached the historical stage in her mind.|$|E
60|$|She {{started at}} his tone. In the splendid arrogance of her assured position, her {{brilliant}} gifts, her almost inspired individuality, failure had <b>never</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b> Even now {{she refused to}} read the message in his set face.|$|E
60|$|Arnold {{looked at}} her in sheer amazement. It was surely a strange woman who spoke! There was no sympathy in her face or tone. The idea of giving alms to the man seemed <b>never</b> <b>to</b> have <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b> She spoke with clouded face, as one in anger.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I wrung {{out some}} account. I believe this would <b>never</b> have <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> if {{her brother had}} given her a {{sandwich}} at Paddington; but she came home exhausted into a distaste for food, which other feelings exaggerated into a fancy to die rather than face the family. She burnt the provisions in a rage at their being forced on her, and she slept most of the time--torpor without acute suffering. Last night in sleep she lost her hold of her resolution, and woke to the sense of self-preservation.' ...|$|R
60|$|So Hilda {{set forth}} in the decline of the afternoon, and pursued her way towards the quarter of the city in which stands the Palazzo Cenci. Her habit of {{self-reliance}} was so simply strong, so natural, and now so well established by long use, that the idea of peril seldom or <b>never</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> Hilda, in <b>her</b> lonely life.|$|R
60|$|And {{then she}} fell into a musing about Capes. She {{wondered}} {{why he was so}} distinctive, so unlike other men, and it <b>never</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> for some time that this might be because she was falling in love with him.|$|E
60|$|Jerome was gone--and he let Harriet Warren {{laugh at}} her {{and he would never}} come back to her. Well, it did not matter, but she had been a fool. Only it had <b>never</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> that Jerome could act so.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Such an enormity <b>never</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> as {{a remote}} possibility. If {{she had known}} you, dear, {{she would have had}} to write an {{appendix}} to her book to meet all the new problems which you would suggest. Shall I go on?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Moreover, American matrons are overworked {{because some}} unaccountable glamour {{leads them to}} {{continue}} to bring up their girls in the same inefficient physical habits which resulted in so much misery to themselves. Housework as they are obliged to do it, untrained, untaught, exhausted, and in company with rude, dirty, unkempt foreigners, seems to them a degradation which they will spare to their daughters. The daughter goes on with her schools and accomplishments, and leads in the family {{the life of an}} elegant little visitor during all those years when a young girl might be gradually developing and strengthening her muscles in healthy household work. It <b>never</b> <b>occurs</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> that she can or ought to fill any of the domestic gaps into which her mother always steps; and she comforts herself with the thought, 'I don't know how; I can't; I haven't the strength. I can't sweep; it blisters my hands. If I should stand at the ironing-table an hour, I should be ill for a week. As to cooking, I don't know anything about it.' And so, when the cook, or the chambermaid, or nurse, or all together, vacate the premises, it is the mamma who is successively cook, and chambermaid, and nurse; and this is the reason why matrons fade and are overworked.|$|R
60|$|She {{was very}} quiet and pale, as she lay that day that he had gone down to the funeral, and she waited and thought all those long hours that he was abroad. She thought {{a good deal of}} the future, and planned that they should go upon the Continent first for a while, and upon their return spend the great {{proportion}} of their income in doing good, living quietly themselves upon very little; she thought that in any other way she should feel as if this fortune were a curse <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> for it had <b>never</b> even <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> that Mr. Harmer might have altered his will.|$|R
6000|$|Herminia {{rose and}} faced her. Her white lips grew livid. She had counted on every element of her martyrdom,--save one; and this, the blackest and fiercest of all, had <b>never</b> even <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b> [...] "Dolly," [...] she cried, [...] "oh, my daughter, you don't {{know what you}} do! You don't know how I've loved you! I've given up my life for you. I thought {{when you came to}} woman's estate, and learned what was right and what wrong, you would indeed rise up and call me blessed. And now,--oh, Dolly, this last blow is too terrible. It will kill me, my darling. I can't go on out-living it." ...|$|R
60|$|Helène was disgusted, {{but she was}} not hard-hearted. The {{girl was}} evidently distressed--it <b>never</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> that she might not be in earnest. She herself could not {{understand}} such a lack of self-respect. A single gleam of pity mingled with her contempt.|$|E
60|$|So Christie made up {{her mind}} to accept, if this {{promotion}} was offered her; and while she waited, went through so many alternations of feeling, and was so harassed by doubts and fears that she sometimes found herself wishing it had <b>never</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b>|$|E
60|$|She was {{not really}} ill-natured, but, in {{maintaining}} her position after the trying circumstances of her married life, she had found it so necessary to be 'full of information,' {{that the idea of}} holding her tongue about 'those two' in the Park <b>never</b> <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b>|$|E
60|$|With {{the turn}} the matter took as {{an effect of}} this meeting, Berridge was more than once to find himself almost ashamed for her--since it seemed <b>never</b> <b>to</b> <b>occur</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> be so for herself: he was jealous of the type where {{she might have been}} taken as insolently {{careless}} of it; his advantage (unless indeed it had been his ruin) being that he could inordinately reflect upon it, could wander off thereby into kinds of licence of which she was incapable. He hadn't, for himself, waited till now to be sure of what he would do were he an Olympian: he would leave his own stuff snugly unread, to begin with; that would be a beautiful start for an Olympian career. He should have been as unable to write those works in short as to make anything else of them; and he should have had no more arithmetic for computing fingers than any perfect-headed marble Apollo mutilated at the wrists. He should have consented to know but the grand personal adventure on the grand personal basis: nothing short of this, no poor cognisance of confusable, pettifogging things, the sphere of earth-grubbing questions and two-penny issues, would begin to be, on any side, Olympian enough.|$|R
6000|$|The way {{the snow}} [...] "goes" [...] for that poor woman is most unfair. It always snows much heavier in the {{particular}} spot where she is sitting than it does {{anywhere else in the}} whole street. Why, we have sometimes seen a heroine sitting {{in the midst of a}} blinding snow-storm while the other side of the road was as dry as a bone. And it <b>never</b> seemed <b>to</b> <b>occur</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> cross over.|$|R
60|$|Her first feeling, {{when she}} found herself alone again, was wonder--wonder that it should <b>never</b> have <b>occurred</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> until he had himself {{suggested}} it, that her betrothed husband had the foremost right <b>to</b> <b>her</b> confession. Her horror at owning to either of them that she had cheated {{them out of their}} love had hitherto placed Horace and Lady Janet on the same level. She now saw {{for the first time that}} there was no comparison between the claims which they respectively had on her. She owned an allegiance to Horace to which Lady Janet could assert no right. Cost her what it might to avow the truth <b>to</b> him with <b>her</b> own lips, the cruel sacrifice must be made.|$|R
