5|$|In February 1869 Smetana had {{the text}} {{translated}} into French, {{and sent the}} libretto and score to the Paris Opera with a business proposal for dividing the profits. The management of the Paris Opera did not respond. The opera was first performed outside its native land on 11 January 1871, when Eduard Nápravník, conductor of the Russian Imperial Opera, gave a performance at the Mariinsky Theatre in St Petersburg. The work attracted mediocre <b>notices</b> <b>from</b> the critics, one of whom compared the work unfavourably to the Offenbach genre. Smetana was hurt by this remark, which he felt downgraded his opera to operetta status, and was convinced that press hostility had been generated by a former adversary, the Russian composer Mily Balakirev. The pair had clashed some years earlier, over the Provisional Theatre's stagings of Glinka's A Life for the Tsar and Ruslan and Lyudmila. Smetana believed that Balakirev had used the Russian premiere of The Bartered Bride {{as a means of}} exacting revenge.|$|E
5|$|In September 2014, {{a wave of}} {{ransomware}} Trojans surfaced {{that first}} targeted users in Australia, under the names CryptoWall and CryptoLocker (which is, as with CryptoLocker 2.0, unrelated to the original CryptoLocker). The Trojans spread via fraudulent e-mails claiming to be failed parcel delivery <b>notices</b> <b>from</b> Australia Post; to evade detection by automatic e-mail scanners that follow all links on a page to scan for malware, this variant was designed to require users to visit a web page and enter a CAPTCHA code before the payload is actually downloaded, preventing such automated processes {{from being able to}} scan the payload. Symantec determined that these new variants, which it identified as CryptoLocker.F, were again, unrelated to the original CryptoLocker due to differences in their operation. A notable victim of the Trojans was the Australian Broadcasting Corporation; live programming on its television news channel ABC News 24 was disrupted for half an hour and shifted to Melbourne studios due to a CryptoWall infection on computers at its Sydney studio.|$|E

25|$|In 1946, Dunham {{returned}} to Broadway for a revue entitled Bal Nègre, which received glowing <b>notices</b> <b>from</b> theater and dance critics. Early in 1947 Dunham choreographed the musical play Windy City, which premiered at the Great Northern Theater in Chicago, {{and later in}} the year she opened a cabaret show in Las Vegas, during the first year that the city became a popular entertainment destination. Later that year she went with her troupe to Mexico, where their performances were so popular that they remained for more than two months. After Mexico, Dunham began touring in Europe, where she was an immediate sensation. In 1948, she opened A Caribbean Rhapsody first at the Prince of Wales Theatre in London, then swept on to the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées in Paris.|$|E
25|$|Casino (1995), like The Age of Innocence before it, {{focused on}} a tightly wound male whose well-ordered life is {{disrupted}} {{by the arrival of}} unpredictable forces. The fact that it was a violent gangster film made it more palatable to fans of the director who perhaps were baffled by the apparent departure of the earlier film. Casino was a box office success, but the film received mixed <b>notices</b> <b>from</b> critics. In large part this was due to its huge stylistic similarities to his earlier Goodfellas, and its excessive violence that garnered it a reputation as possibly the most violent American gangster film ever made. Indeed, many of the tropes and tricks of the earlier film resurfaced more or less intact, most obviously the casting of both Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci, Pesci once again playing an unbridled psychopath. Sharon Stone was nominated for the Best Actress Academy Award for her performance. During the filming Scorsese played a background part as a gambler at one of the tables.|$|E
500|$|In mid-November 2007, the cease-and-desist emails {{initiated}} by Odex and BayTSP reached several users in Japan, France, and the United States, {{some in the}} form of Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) <b>notices</b> <b>from</b> their ISPs. Although Odex and BayTSP announced shortly afterwards that the emails were sent out in error, Japanese commentators suggested that the enforcement action was [...] "a step in a right direction". On 21 November 2007, Odex's website was hacked and defaced and the VOD service put out of action. Its main page was replaced by an angry message against the company's legal actions, and experts interviewed by representatives of the local media said that the perpetrator likely was from Singapore.|$|E

500|$|When {{staying in}} Philadelphia, Strickland had {{opportunities}} {{to take part}} in other films in production in and around the city. Those included Rel Dowdell's Train Ride, a date rape thriller filmed in 1998, but not commercially released until 2005 because of financing problems. She was also cast in the crime drama Diamond Men with Robert Forster and Donnie Wahlberg; it opened to sparkling reviews, with Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times declaring it [...] "a fantastic film, with a good cast". After she moved to New York City, Strickland appeared in Adam Bhala Lough's filmmaking debut, Bomb the System, which received unenthusiastic <b>notices</b> <b>from</b> critics and was not shown outside film festivals until 2005.|$|E
500|$|A key {{passage in}} the novel details {{what happens when a}} vampire enters a room uninvited, an action that {{traditional}} vampire lore usually prohibits. Alfredson originally wanted to omit this from the film, but Ajvide Lindqvist was adamant {{that it had to be}} included. Alfredson was initially nervous about the scene. He realized in post-production that the sound effects and music made it [...] "American, in a bad way", and had to be removed for the scene to work. The end result, which shows Eli slowly beginning to bleed from her eyes, ears, and pores, received positive <b>notices</b> <b>from</b> many critics. Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian described it as a [...] "haemophilia of rejection".|$|E
500|$|In 1891 Robey {{visited the}} Royal Aquarium in Westminster where he watched [...] "Professor Kennedy", a burlesque mesmerist from America. After the performance, Robey visited Kennedy in his {{dressing}} room and offered {{himself as the}} stooge for his next appearance. They agreed that Robey, as his young apprentice, would be [...] "mesmerised" [...] into singing a comic song. At a later rehearsal, Robey negotiated a deal to sing one of the comic songs that had been written for him by Rogers. Robey's turn was a great success, {{and as a result}} he secured a permanent theatrical residency at the venue. Later that year, he appeared as a solo act at the Oxford Music Hall, where he performed [...] "The Simple Pimple" [...] and [...] "He'll Get It Where He's Gone to Now". The theatrical press soon became aware of his act, and The Stage called him a [...] "comedian with a pretty sense of humour [...] delivers his songs with considerable point and meets with all success". In early 1892, together with his performances at the Royal Aquarium and the Oxford Music Hall, Robey starred alongside Jenny Hill, Bessie Bonehill and Harriet Vernon at the Paragon Theatre of Varieties in Mile End, where, according to his biographer Peter Cotes, he [...] "stole the <b>notices</b> <b>from</b> experienced troupers".|$|E

500|$|The film's {{screening}} at Cannes {{met with}} critical acclaim, prompting speculation {{it could be}} awarded the Palme d'Or. The award eventually went to Entre les murs (The Class). Straczynski claimed that Changelings loss by two votes {{was due to the}} judges' not believing the story was based on fact. He said they did not believe the police would treat someone as they had Collins. The loss led to Universal's request that Straczynski annotate the script with sources. Although the positive critical <b>notices</b> <b>from</b> Cannes generated speculation that the film would be a serious contender at the 2009 Academy Awards, the North American theatrical release met with a more mixed response. Critics generally judged Changeling well-acted and beautifully shot, but considered the compelling story to have been told too conventionally. Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, reported that reviews were [...] "generally favorable," [...] with an average score of 63 based on 38 reviews. As of June 10, 2014, 63% of 197 critics listed by review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes had given the film a positive review, with an average rating of 6.3/10. The film's reception in several European countries was more favorable, and in the United Kingdom 83% of critics listed by Rotten Tomatoes gave Changeling a positive review.|$|E
500|$|In September 1954 a stage [...] {{version of}} the Diary, by Basil Dean and Richard Blake, was {{presented}} at London's Arts Theatre [...] with a cast that included George Benson and Dulcie Gray as the Pooters and Leslie Phillips as Lupin. Anthony Hartley, writing in The Spectator, classed this production as [...] "fair-to-middling", with sympathetic performances from the principals: [...] "t is a precondition {{of this kind of}} play that everybody concerned should have a heart of gold: only in the case of Mr. Pooter's employer, Mr. Perkupp, do we actually hear the metal chinking." [...] In 1986 Waterhouse presented an adaptation of his [...] "Mrs Pooter" [...] text at the Garrick Theatre, with Judi Dench and Michael Williams. This version [...] was revived in 1993 at the Greenwich Theatre in a production by Matthew Francis. [...] Clive Swift and Patricia Routledge played Charles and Carrie, in what Paul Taylor in The Independent described as [...] "essentially a two-hander... in which all the other folk (including Lupin Pooter, the uppish, worrying son) are either imagined characters or, at times, impersonated by the Pooters". In March 2011 the Diary was the subject of an even less orthodox production at the Royal & Derngate Theatre, Northampton. Adapted by Hugh Osborne, with an all-male cast led by Robert Daws, this supposes that [...] Pooter has arranged for his diaries to be performed by amateur actors. Quentin Letts of the Daily Mail found this [...] "an evening of some of the cleverest, fastest entertainment I have seen for months". [...] Lyn Garner in The Guardian found it [...] "a show of some charm – though one that, like Pooter himself, does not quite have the credentials to be quite so pleased with itself". In 2014 a production of the Diary was staged in London by Rough Haired Pointer at the White Bear Theatre and later transfered to the King's Head Theatre. Originally intended as a play for 6 actors the loss of the sole actress due to an emergency after the opening night left the original production with an all male cast performing thirty one characters. Time Out said of the production, [...] "it captures the original’s sharp subtext, frivolous wit and heavy irony, while also being very, very silly". Largely favourable reviews saw the play transfer to the King's Head. For the transfer the play was reworked with a now deliberate all male cast of four playing forty five characters. This new version received positive <b>notices</b> <b>from</b> fringe reviewers but by its second run at the King's Head the Guardian's Lyn Gardener was less enamoured noting there were, [...] "some nice touches, in particular the black and white cardboard cut-out-style design that offers a nod to the original illustrations. But the relentless comic business featuring doors and human lampshades slow the action and lead to perfunctory performances: it’s caricature, not character. (What is) totally missing is the original’s tenderness and affection for Charles." ...|$|E
