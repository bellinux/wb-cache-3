25|$|X's design {{requires}} the clients and server to operate separately, and device {{independence and the}} separation of client and server incur overhead. Most of the overhead comes from network round-trip delay time between client and server (latency) {{rather than from the}} protocol itself: the best solutions to performance issues depend on efficient application design. A common criticism of X is that its <b>network</b> <b>features</b> result in excessive complexity and decreased performance if only used locally.|$|E
25|$|Mac OS 8.1 {{sees the}} {{introduction}} of {{an updated version of}} the Hierarchical File System named HFS+, which fixed many of the limitations of the earlier system (HFS+ continued to be used in macOS up until macOS High Sierra, when it was replaced with the Apple File System). There are some other interface changes such as separating <b>network</b> <b>features</b> from printing, and some improvements to application switching. However, in underlying technical respects, Mac OS 8 is not very different from System 7.|$|E

40|$|Research {{collaboration}} {{can bring}} in different perspectives and generate more productive results. However, finding an appropriate collaborator can be difficult due to the lacking of sufficient information. Link prediction is a related technique for collaborator discovery; but its focus has been mostly on the core authors who have relatively more publications. We argue that junior researchers actually need more help in finding collaborators. Thus, in this paper, we focus on coauthor prediction for junior researchers. Most of the previous works on coauthor prediction considered global <b>network</b> <b>feature</b> and local <b>network</b> <b>feature</b> separately, or tried to combine local <b>network</b> <b>feature</b> and content feature. But we found a significant improvement by simply combing local <b>network</b> <b>feature</b> and global <b>network</b> <b>feature.</b> We further developed a regularization based approach to incorporate multiple features simultaneously. Experimental results demonstrated that this approach outperformed the simple linear combination of multiple features. We further showed that content features, which were proved to be useful in link prediction, can be easily integrated into our regularization approach. © 2013 Springer-Verlag...|$|R

25|$|In the United States, Adult Swim has {{frequently}} aired adult animation features, anime, mockumentaries, sketch comedy, live-action, and pilots. Shows may have sexual themes, frank sexual discussion, nudity, strong language, and graphic violence; in other words, programs {{that would be}} deemed inappropriate if aired during the day on Cartoon Network, when children would be watching. While the <b>network</b> <b>features</b> comedic and dramatic programs of all types, many of its programs are aesthetically experimental, transgressive, improvised, and surrealist in nature. Thus, Adult Swim has {{become a source of}} conflict, with some saying that it is too controversial, while others noting that its ability to question the norm brings a level of surrealism and experimentalism that is welcome. Adult Swim has contracted with various studios known for their productions in absurd and shock comedy.|$|E
25|$|The Opencaching Network {{provides}} independent, non-commercial listing sites {{based in}} the cacher's country or region. The Opencaching Network lists the most types of caches, including traditional, virtual, moving, multi, quiz, webcam, BIT, guest book, USB, event and MP3. The Opencaching Network is less restrictive than many sites, and does not charge {{for the use of}} the sites, the service being community driven. Some (or all) listings may or may not be required to be reviewed by community volunteers before being published and although cross-listing is permitted, it is discouraged. Some listings are listed on other sites, but there are many that are unique to the Opencaching <b>Network.</b> <b>Features</b> include the ability to organize one's favourite caches, build custom searches, be instantly notified of new caches in one's area, seek and create caches of all types, export GPX queries, statpics, etc.|$|E
25|$|The site {{features}} {{cold case}} disappearances and unidentified decedents, in hopes to create awareness for such cases and to generate potential leads. Those documented have occurred during or {{before the year}} 2013. Case files are created for both unidentified and missing persons, detailing physical estimations of the subjects as well as circumstances of the disappearance, sightings and recovery of the unidentified subjects. Images of the missing and unidentified, including forensic facial reconstructions, tattoos, and age progressions are also available for cases. Cases of murder conviction without a body are also listed, although their cases have been solved, as the victim could possibly remain unidentified. The site provides an online form for visitors to submit potential matches between missing and unidentified persons, which are subsequently reviewed by volunteers prior to submission to authorities. After the form is completed by a reader, 16 members of the Doe Network's administrative panel evaluate {{the importance of the}} possible match and whether or not to submit it to investigators handling the case. The Web site also works alongside other databases, such as the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System and the NCIC. The Doe <b>Network</b> <b>features</b> worldwide cases and is also presented in various languages.|$|E
