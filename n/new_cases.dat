40|$|These {{studies are}} being {{conducted}} to determine the most suitable Artificial Intelligent Technique to be implement in software Breast Cancer Detector (CBR). Breast Cancer Detector problem is to compare similarity of the <b>new</b> <b>case</b> to the old case which is have more than hundred record case. This is to ensure the less take time to compare one by one over the hundred <b>case</b> to a <b>new</b> <b>case.</b> The objective of this project is to develope the prototype to do the comparism of a <b>new</b> <b>case</b> with existing case of the breast cancer. Case Base Reasoning (CBR) is capable of solving the measurement of similarity and less take time to find the highest similarity. CBR consist four phase {{to be done to}} solve the similarity measurement. The first phase is retrieve that is problem (<b>new</b> <b>case)</b> is retreived. The second phase is reuse that is reuse the solved case and calculate to find the suggested solution orit called the highest similarity in percentage. The third phase is revise which is process to confirm solution (teste or repaired case). The last phase is retain. The machine learn in other mean the machine save the <b>new</b> <b>case</b> if the <b>new</b> <b>case</b> does not have the highest similarity and the doctor should do the phisycal check. The calculation that used to calculate the similarity measure is called Feature-Based Similarity Measure algorithm...|$|R

5|$|Roughly {{one-third of}} the world's {{population}} has been infected with M. tuberculosis, with new infections occurring in about 1% of the population each year. However, most infections with M. tuberculosis do not cause TB disease, and 90–95% of infections remain asymptomatic. In 2012, an estimated 8.6 million chronic cases were active. In 2010, 8.8 million <b>new</b> <b>cases</b> of TB were diagnosed, and 1.20–1.45 million deaths occurred, most of these occurring in developing countries. Of these 1.45 million deaths, about 0.35million occur in those also infected with HIV.|$|E
5|$|Tuberculosis is the second-most {{common cause}} of death from {{infectious}} disease (after those due to HIV/AIDS). The total number of tuberculosis cases has been decreasing since 2005, while <b>new</b> <b>cases</b> have decreased since 2002. China has achieved particularly dramatic progress, with about an 80% reduction in its TB mortality rate between 1990 and 2010. The number of <b>new</b> <b>cases</b> has declined by 17% between 2004 and 2014. Tuberculosis {{is more common in}} developing countries; about 80% of the population in many Asian and African countries test positive in tuberculin tests, while only 5–10% of the US population test positive. Hopes of totally controlling the disease have been dramatically dampened because of a number of factors, including the difficulty of developing an effective vaccine, the expensive and time-consuming diagnostic process, the necessity of many months of treatment, the increase in HIV-associated tuberculosis, and the emergence of drug-resistant cases in the 1980s.|$|E

He removes the larvae from their original cases and adds precious and semi-precious items such as grains of gold into the tank. The larvae then build <b>new</b> <b>cases</b> out of precious items, creating a unique form of artwork. The resulting works are sold across the world.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the representation of}} background knowledge and its use in case-based reasoning. Case-based reasoning {{can be viewed as}} a particular form of problem-solving, based on the assessment of similarity of a <b>new</b> <b>case</b> to previously encountered cases, and the subsequent inference that an old solution also applies to the <b>new</b> <b>case.</b> To justify such inferences, we present a representation of background knowledge as arguments for and against a conclusion given known facts, rather than as statements in logic or probabilistic relations. Cases are characterized by the set of arguments for and against a hypothesis of interest, and the resolution of conflicting arguments for a <b>new</b> <b>case</b> is obtained by firstly locating an old case where the same or a similar conflict occurred, then secondly transferring the resolution from the old <b>case</b> to the <b>new</b> <b>case.</b> In this way, we are able both to represent weak, possibly conflicting fragments of background knowledge and also learn about the relative [...] ...|$|R
5|$|After {{the lethal}} second wave struck in late 1918, <b>new</b> <b>cases</b> dropped abruptly– almost to nothing after {{the peak in}} the second wave. In Philadelphia, for example, 4,597 {{people died in the}} week ending 16 October, but by 11 November, {{influenza}} had almost disappeared from the city. One explanation for the rapid decline of the lethality of the disease is that doctors simply got better at preventing and treating the pneumonia that developed after the victims had contracted the virus, although John Barry stated in his book that researchers have found no evidence to support this.|$|E
5|$|Cervical {{cancer is}} {{associated}} with human papillomavirus (HPV), which has also been implicated in cancers of the vulva, vagina, anus, and oropharynx. Almost 300 million women worldwide have been infected with HPV, one of the commoner sexually transmitted infections, and 5% of the 13 million <b>new</b> <b>cases</b> of {{cancer in the world}} have been attributed to HPV. In developed countries, screening for cervical cancer using the Pap test has identified pre-cancerous changes in the cervix, at least in those women with access to health care. Also an HPV vaccine programme is available in 45 countries. Screening and prevention programmes have limited availability in developing countries although inexpensive low technology programmes are being developed, but access to treatment is also limited. If applied globally, HPV vaccination at 70% coverage could save the lives of 4 million women from cervical cancer, since most cases occur in developing countries.|$|E
5|$|Circumcision has a {{protective}} effect against {{the risks of}} penile cancer in men, and cervical cancer in the female sexual partners of heterosexual men. Penile cancer is rare, with about 1 new case per 100,000 people per year in developed countries and higher incidence rates per 100,000 in sub-Saharan Africa (for example: 1.6 in Zimbabwe, 2.7 in Uganda and 3.2 in Swaziland). The number of <b>new</b> <b>cases</b> is also high in certain South American countries such as Paraguay and Uruguay at about 4.3 per 100,000. It is least common in Israeli Jews—0.1 per 100,000—related {{in part to the}} very high rate of circumcision of babies.|$|E

5|$|In 2007, {{the country}} with the highest {{estimated}} incidence rate of TB was Swaziland, with 1,200 cases per 100,000 people. India had the largest total incidence, with an estimated 2.0 million <b>new</b> <b>cases.</b> In developed countries, tuberculosis is less common and is found mainly in urban areas. Rates per 100,000 people in different areas of the world were: globally 178, Africa 332, the Americas 36, Eastern Mediterranean 173, Europe 63, Southeast Asia 278, and Western Pacific 139 in 2010. In Canada and Australia, tuberculosis is many times more common among the aboriginal peoples, especially in remote areas. In the United States Native Americans have a fivefold greater mortality from TB, and racial and ethnic minorities accounted for 84% of all reported TB cases.|$|E
5|$|In 2015, {{pancreatic}} cancers of {{all types}} resulted in 411,600 deaths globally. Pancreatic cancer is the fifth {{most common cause of}} death from cancer in the United Kingdom, and the fourth most common in the United States. The disease occurs most often in the developed world, where about 70% of the <b>new</b> <b>cases</b> in 2012 originated. Pancreatic adenocarcinoma typically has a very poor prognosis: after diagnosis, 25% of people survive one year and 5% live for five years. For cancers diagnosed early, the five-year survival rate rises to about 20%. Neuroendocrine cancers have better outcomes; at five years from diagnosis, 65% of those diagnosed are living, though survival varies considerably {{depending on the type of}} tumor.|$|E
5|$|MS is {{the most}} common {{autoimmune}} disorder of the central nervous system.
