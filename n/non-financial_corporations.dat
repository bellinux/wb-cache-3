An integral part of this exercise is to understand how derivatives are valued, since the economic rationale for risk management critically hinges on the price at which risk management can be executed. At the end of the course, students should: (i) have a clear understanding of the economic rationale for risk management; (ii) master the basic techniques for the valuation of forwards, futures, and vanilla options (calls and puts); (iii) master the basic techniques for engineering hedges using forwards, futures, and options; (iv) understand the specifics of risk management in terms of energy risk...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{financial}} reforms, {{such as the}} Dodd-Frank Act in the U. S. and the European Market Infrastructure Regulation, encourage {{greater use}} of clearing and therefore increased margining of derivative trades. They also impose margining requirements on OTC derivative dealers. One question arising out of the debates over these reforms is, does a margin mandate increases the cost of hedging by non-financial corporations—the so-called end-users of derivatives? Our answer is, No. We show that a non-margined derivative is equivalent to a package of (i) a margined derivative, and (ii) a contingent line of credit. A margin mandate merely requires that this package be marketed as two distinct products, {{but it does not}} change the total financing or capital that the <b>non-financial</b> <b>corporation</b> requires to back its hedging. Nor does it raise the cost to banks or other dealer of offering the package, at least not directly. There may be an indirect effect if the clearing mandate succeeds in lowering systemic risk, but indirect macro effects such as this are {{beyond the scope of this}} paper. We also explore how accounting rules and bank regulations may treat the implicit credit embedded in the non-margined derivative differently from an explicit line of credit. This is important to understanding business and banker reaction to details of the proposal. Finally, we place the current debate in the context of the historical evolution of margin practices and regulations from the earliest trading of derivatives in the U. S. in the 1860 ’s to the present. [URL]...|$|R

But persistent cohort effects in the choice of tax regime and substantial unobserved corporation-specific effects indicate that non-tax factors matter as well.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to examine the value implications of cross-border expansion patterns of Emerging Market Multinationals (EMMs) and to observe market reaction to these patterns. It primarily focuses on mergers and acquisition (M&A), joint venture (JV) strategic alliance (SA) and announcements that took place during the period of 1991 - 2003. EMMs considered in this study are listed in UNCTAD's world investment report (2002), as the top 50 <b>non-financial</b> Transnational <b>Corporations</b> (TNCs) from developing economies and the largest 25 non-financial TNCs based in Central and Eastern Europe. This study employs event study and examines a total of 982 international expansion activities entailing 436 (M&As), 387 (JVs) and 159 (SAs) performed by 66 EMMs. The results indicate that market reaction to M&As is generally negative. Hence, EMMs that expand through M&As create little or no value. Similar results are evident for the JVs. SAs seem to generate more positive abnormal returns, but not statistically significant. While Asian and Latin American EMMs' expansions create value for shareholders, Eastern European EMMs' expansions are value destructive. A negative association between size of the acquisition and abnormal returns is illustrated suggesting value destructive impact of larger acquisitions. Acquisitions of SOEs are also value destructive. International experience and familiarity with the target market proved to be insignificant. Good governance is positively associated with cumulative abnormal returns. Diversified EMMs' cross-border acquisitions tend to create value for shareholders; however, hi-tech EMMs' cross-border acquisitions are value destructive. Some target country characteristics have a significant impact on acquiring firms' value creation. While more developed institutional infrastructure and overall level of economic development have positive impact on abnormal returns, geographic and cultural proximity proved to be insignificant. Cross-sectional and logistic regression analyses also support these results. Yet, the impact of all three expansion patterns on the performance of EMMs is positive. The improvement in performance is evident in all three years after the announcement. The performance in the third year surpasses the first two years. It is also indicative from the result that as EMM performance improves with time, multinationality measure decreases - stating a negative relationship between performance and multinationality.

40|$|Executive summary: While Commonwealth {{government}} debt {{has been the}} focus of attention recently, this report takes a broader view by bringing state debt into the picture. Much has been made of the fact that Commonwealth {{government debt}} is projected (under current expenditure and tax policies) to grow from $ 300 billion at June 2013 to more than $ 400 billion in 2016 – 17 — and keep growing. Over the same four years, net debt (after deducting certain financial assets) is expected to grow from $ 153 billion to $ 280 billion and then to $ 325 billion in 2018 – 19, at which point it will peak as a percentage of GDP. State debt has also risen dramatically since 2007, when net debt was negative. In the six years to 2013, states added $ 70 billion to their general government net debt to reach a positive level of $ 43 billion. Aggregate state debt is manageable at that level, but the upward trend is of concern—and more so in some states than others. By 2016 – 17, combined Commonwealth and state general government (GG) net debt will exceed $ 350 billion—almost 20 % of GDP, or more meaningfully, more than 50 % of general government revenue. The general government debt figures do not tell the full story. For the broader non-financial public sector (which includes <b>non-financial</b> public <b>corporations),</b> state net debt was much higher at $ 127 billion in 2013. Combined with the Commonwealth, total non-financial public sector net debt was $ 283 billion, already 50 % of the sector’s revenue. Public corporations’ debt is guaranteed by their government owners, but these corporations are better able to carry debt as their investments are supposed to be commercially viable. The above figures exclude non-debt financial liabilities such as unfunded superannuation and long-service leave liabilities. These loom large in state finances. When added to net debt, non-debt financial liabilities bring the 2013 total of net financial liabilities to $ 190 billion for state general government and $ 319 billion for the state non-financial public sector. In most states, general government net financial liabilities in 2013 exceeded 100 % of revenue, having increased steeply since 2007. The states’ financial position has deteriorated because their net operating surpluses have shrunk while capital (‘infrastructure’) spending soared, resulting in large cash deficits. All states have experienced this deterioration: Queensland, Western Australia, South Australia and Tasmania have lost the coveted triple-A credit rating, and NSW and Victoria are at risk of being downgraded should current trends continue. All states have curbed the growth of operating expenditure, but they will need to persevere in the face of sluggish revenue if they are to rebuild operating surpluses and avoid sharp cuts in capital expenditure...|$|R
40|$|A Social Accounting Matrix (SAM) is {{presented}} as a tool to study the socio economic activity of a country. This activity involves the monetary or nominal flows that are measured by the National Accounts, as well as production (organized in factors, industries and goods and services) and institutions (organized in households, general government, <b>non-financial</b> and financial <b>corporations,</b> non-profit institutions serving households, and rest of the world). In order to contribute to the definition of a methodology that can contribute to improving the knowledge of the different aspects of this activity, the potentialities of a SAM for its reading and interpreting are explored, as well as for carrying out experiments regarding its functioning. Through a SAM-based approach, how to construct more or less complex networks of linkages of the above-mentioned flows is shown, from which structural features can be evidenced and the associated multiplier effects studied. Following an application to Portugal, it is shown that a numerical version of a SAM, enables an empirical description of the origin, use, and distribution of income, whereas, an algebraic version of a SAM allows one to carry out, for example, a deeper study of the multiplier effects associated with the institutional distribution of income. The crucial role of the factors of production accounts is identified in this study, namely when they establish the link between the generation and the distribution and use of income. In this process, the important role the complementary details that the Input-Output Matrix (IOM) can add is also identified. Thus, being the generation of income the result of the output of goods and services and the associated costs, on the one hand, an industry by industry IOM can add details regarding domestic and imported intermediate consumption by and between industries and, on the other hand, a product by product IOM can add details regarding the domestic and imported intermediate consumption of goods and services. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
