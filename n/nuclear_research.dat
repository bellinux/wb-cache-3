5|$|Dubnium {{does not}} occur {{naturally}} on Earth and is produced artificially. The first discovery of the element was claimed by the Soviet Joint Institute for <b>Nuclear</b> <b>Research</b> (JINR) in 1968, followed in 1970 by the American University of California. Both teams proposed their names for the new element and used them without formal approval. The long-standing dispute was resolved in 1993 by an official investigation of the discovery claims by the IUPAC/IUPAP Joint Working Party, resulting in credit for discovery being officially shared between both teams. The element was officially named dubnium in 1997 after the town of Dubna, {{the site of the}} JINR.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, the Joint Institute for <b>Nuclear</b> <b>Research</b> {{conducted}} {{a search for}} natural hassium. This was done underground to avoid interference and false positives from cosmic rays, but no results have been released, strongly implying that no natural hassium was found. The possible extent of primordial hassium on Earth is uncertain; it might now only exist in traces, or could even have completely decayed by now after having caused the radiation damage long ago.|$|E
5|$|In January 1950, Fuchs {{confessed that}} he was a spy. He was sentenced to {{fourteen}} years' imprisonment and stripped of his British citizenship.

5|$|In the 1960s, {{small amounts}} of {{rutherfordium}} were produced in the Joint Institute for <b>Nuclear</b> <b>Research</b> in the former Soviet Union and at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California. The priority of the discovery and therefore the naming of the element was disputed between Soviet and American scientists, {{and it was not}} until 1997 that International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) established rutherfordium as the official name for the element.|$|E
5|$|Irradiation of 241Am by 12C or 22Ne ions {{yields the}} {{isotopes}} 247Es (einsteinium) or 260Db (dubnium), respectively. Furthermore, the element berkelium (243Bk isotope) had been first intentionally produced and identified by bombarding 241Am with alpha particles, in 1949, {{by the same}} Berkeley group, using the same 60-inch cyclotron. Similarly, nobelium was produced at the Joint Institute for <b>Nuclear</b> <b>Research,</b> Dubna, Russia, in 1965 in several reactions, one of which included irradiation of 243Am with 15N ions. Besides, one of the synthesis reactions for lawrencium, discovered by scientists at Berkeley and Dubna, included bombardment of 243Am with 18O.|$|E
5|$|Just 23 {{days after}} his death, the Regents of the University of California voted to rename two of the university's <b>nuclear</b> <b>research</b> sites after Lawrence: the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. The Ernest Orlando Lawrence Award was {{established}} in his memory in 1959. Chemical element number 103, discovered at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in 1961, was named lawrencium after him. In 1968 the Lawrence Hall of Science public science education center was established in his honor. His papers are in the Bancroft Library at the University of California in Berkeley.|$|E
