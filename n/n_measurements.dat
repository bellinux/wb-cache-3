40|$|In sparse {{approximation}} theory, {{the fundamental}} problem is to reconstruct a signal A ∈ R <b>n</b> from linear <b>measurements</b> 〈A, ψi 〉 {{with respect to a}} dictionary of ψi’s. Recently, there is focus on the novel direction of Compressed Sensing [9] where the reconstruction can be done with very few—O(k log <b>n)</b> —linear <b>measurements</b> over a modified dictionary if the signal is compressible, that is, its information is concentrated in k coefficients with the original dictionary. In particular, these results [9, 4, 22] prove that there exists a single O(k log <b>n)</b> × <b>n</b> <b>measurement</b> matrix such that any such signal can be reconstructed from these measurements, with error at most O(1) times the worst case error for the class of such signals. Compressed sensing has generated tremendous excitement both because of the sophisticated underlying Mathematics and because of its potential applications. In this paper, we address outstanding open problems in Compressed Sensing. Our main result is an explicit construction of a non-adaptive measurement matrix and the corresponding reconstruction algorithm so that with a number of measurements polynomial in k, log n, 1 /ε, we can reconstruct any compressible signal.
