The last of these studies—presently housed at the Art Institute of Chicago—was painted in 1883 and is very close to the final work, except most obviously in respect of its size; it is just 25cm long and 16cm high. Seurat was fond of these small studies, calling them his croquetons (a <b>nonce</b> <b>word</b> best translated as ‘sketchettes’), and hanging them on the walls of his studio.|$|E

The first experiment showed that unmarked stems are productively extended to <b>nonce</b> <b>words,</b> whereas marked stems generalize more restrictively to <b>nonce</b> <b>words,</b> based on lexical similarity to existing stem forms. The second experiment yielded a lexical ERP signature for stem violations and an ERP pattern signaling morpho-syntactic (rule-based) processing for suffix violations. We argue that stem allomorphy is lexically represented in the Spanish mental lexicon, with marked stems forming subnodes of structured lexical entries. ...|$|R

40|$|The present {{investigation}} {{is dedicated to}} the study of the Brazilian Portuguese children’s morphological knowledge and its relation with levels of mental representations as postulated by the Representational Redescription model (KARMILOFF-SMITH, 1992). The data consist of regularized verbal forms, changes of inflectional suffixes as well as lexical novelty (morphological variant forms) taken from spontaneous speech and of three morphological tests, which involve derivation and inflection of <b>nonce</b> <b>words,</b> extraction of <b>nonce</b> base from derived <b>nonce</b> <b>words,</b> and judgment of words as well as a metalinguistic explanation. The survey of the responses reveals morphological knowledge that goes from sensitivity – morphological variant forms – to linguistic awareness – morphology tests. Thus, the data pointed to the plausibility of all the different levels of representation across development. In our view, this work embodies a first step towards an explanation of the mental representations that underlie both the comprehension and production of children’s growing morphological knowledge and goes beyond the simple implicit/explicit dichotomy used in most previous work...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Nonce</b> <b>words</b> are {{sometimes}} {{used to study}} the development of language in children because they allow researchers to test how children treat words of which they have no prior knowledge. This permits inferences about the default assumptions children make about new word meanings, syntactic structure, etc. [...] "Wug" [...] is among the earliest known <b>nonce</b> <b>words</b> used in language learning studies, and {{is best known for}} its use in Jean Berko's [...] "Wug test", in which children were presented with a novel object, called a wug, and then shown multiple instances of the object and asked to complete a sentence that elicits a plural form—e.g., [...] "This is a wug. Now there are two of them. There are two...?" [...] The use of the plural form [...] "wugs" [...] by the child suggests that they have applied a plural rule to the form, and that this knowledge is not specific to prior experience with the word but applies to all nouns, whether familiar or novel.|$|R

50|$|In cryptography, a nonce is an {{arbitrary}} number that {{may only be}} used once. It is similar in spirit to a <b>nonce</b> <b>word,</b> hence the name.

40|$|Generative {{linguistics}} has primarily used introspection-based {{data for}} its theory construction. However, we now witness {{the rise of}} experimental approaches to linguistic judgments, in which linguistic judgment patterns are investigated through experimentation. Using patterns of obstruent devoicing in Japanese loanwords as a test case, the current project attempts to contribute to this growing body of work by investigating how different experimental variables affect phonological judgments. The three variables tested in the current experiments are (i) scalar rating judgments vs. binary yes/no judgments, (ii) real <b>words</b> vs. <b>nonce</b> <b>words,</b> and (iii) orthography stimuli vs. audio stimuli. The results show that (i) scalar rating tests and binary yes/no tests show very similar patterns, (ii) <b>nonce</b> <b>words</b> show less variability in acceptability across different grammatical conditions than real words, and (iii) orthography stimuli and audio stimuli yield comparable results, but (iv) audio-based experiments exaggerate the effect of particular phonetic implementation patterns as compared to orthography-based tests. Building on these results, this paper provides some suggestions for future experimentation on phonological judgments...|$|R
