50|$|A later {{refinement}} {{of the basic}} Mountbatten pink camouflage {{was the use of}} a slightly lighter tone of the same colour for the upper structures of the ship. By the end of 1942, however, all vessels of destroyer size and larger had dispensed with Mountbatten pink, although it is believed that smaller vessels retained this colour until well into 1944. The primary problem with Mountbatten pink was that it stood out around midday, when the sky was <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> <b>pink,</b> and the traditional battleship grey was much less visible.|$|E

The ornate lobby remained unused until 2010, when a business selling vintage furniture and hardware moved into the space.|$|R
