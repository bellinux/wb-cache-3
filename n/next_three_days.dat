5|$|Hurricane Darby was {{a strong}} {{tropical}} cyclone which affected Hawaii as a tropical storm. The fifth named storm of the busy 2016 Pacific hurricane season, Darby originated from a low pressure area that developed in the Eastern Pacific well southwest of Mexico during July2016. It gained sufficient organization to be declared a tropical depression on July11, and was upgraded to Tropical Storm Darby the next day. Further intensification ensued, and Darby became a hurricane on July13. Over the <b>next</b> <b>three</b> <b>days,</b> Darby slowly strengthened to Category 3 status on the Saffir–Simpson scale, becoming a major hurricane. Cool waters and dry air caused Darby to weaken over the <b>next</b> <b>three</b> <b>days,</b> although Darby managed to restrengthen slightly on July21 before weakening once again as the storm neared Hawaii. Just after midnight on July24 (UTC; 2:00p.m. on July23 HST), Darby made landfall on the Big Island, and weakened into a remnant low two days later.|$|E
