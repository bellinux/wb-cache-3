40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the implications of}} EU non-tariff barriers in the form sanitary and phyto-sanitary (SPS) measures and technical barriers to trade (TBT) on gender relations in the agricultural labour market between 1995 and 2012.

40|$|Recently {{a number}} of {{large-scale}} uncertainties have emerged as threats {{to the development of}} regional integration. Most notably, the UK has decided to leave the EU, and the new US president has stated that he would withdraw the US from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). This paper presents a quantitative comparison of the economic impacts of {{a number of}} alternative regional trade agreement (RTA) scenarios. The impacts were estimated using a Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model of global trade. It is estimated that the US would no longer gain and might even lose, if it withdraws from TPP. The benefits of the bilateral Free Trade Agreement (FTA) and Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) with Japan would be smaller than those of TPP. Higher tariffs on US imports from China and Mexico would lead to significant deterioration of the economic welfare of not only China and Mexico but also the US. Furthermore, China’s benefits from the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) might be relatively limited depending on the levels of the agreement and weighed against the adverse impacts of the possible US tariffs. The UK economy would suffer as a result of BREXIT, but the cost of BREXIT could be smaller than the possible benefits of joining TPP.

40|$|Although {{there has}} been {{considerable}} analysis {{on the effects of}} trade measures on forest product markets, these have tended to focus on tariffs.

Nontariff barriers are found to be less common than tariffs but have similar or bigger aggregate impacts on trade, production, producer revenues, consumer expenditures and value added as tariffs. There is uncertainty in the estimation of ad-valorem equivalence of non-tariff barriers that serves as a caveat on the results.

40|$|Global {{trade has}} been {{exceptionally}} weak {{over the past}} four years. While global trade grew at approximately twice the rate of GDP prior to the Great Recession, the ratio of global trade to GDP growth has declined to about unity since 2012. This paper assesses to what extent the change in the relationship between global trade and global economic activity is a temporary phenomenon or constitutes a lasting change. It finds that global trade growth has been primarily dampened by two factors. First, compositional factors, including geographical shifts in economic activity and changes in the composition of aggregate demand, have weighed on the sensitivity of trade to economic activity. Second, structural developments, such as waning growth in global value chains, a rise in <b>non-tariff</b> protectionist <b>measures</b> and a declining marginal impact of financial deepening, are dampening the support from factors that boosted global trade in the past. Notwithstanding the particularly pronounced weakness in 2015 that is assessed to be mostly a temporary phenomenon owing to a number of country-specific adverse shocks, the upside potential for trade over the medium term appears to be limited. The 2 ̆ 01 cnew normal 2 ̆ 01 d for global trade can therefore be expected to look broadly similar to the weakness observed over recent years on average.

First, matching estimators highlight the rather far-fetched country comparisons underlying common cross-country results. When appropriately restricting the sample, we confirm a positive and significant effect of openness on growth.

40|$|ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] The first essay {{introduces}} a new method to <b>measure</b> <b>non-tariff</b> barriers (NTBs). NTBs to agricultural trade {{are believed to}} have increased while tariffs fell. Hence, measuring NTBs is important and several alternative methods have been used. I develop a method that combines cointegration tests and an equilibrium model. These seemingly disparate methods are used to estimate the size of NTBs and to assess their economic impact. I apply our method to the Russian chicken import ban and find larger impacts compared to a common method based on price gaps. This new method can help trade policy analysts convert implicit economic assumptions of cointegration test results into explicit NTB measures that can explain the observed pattern in time series price data and estimate their impacts. The second essay examines the impact of the impacts of the Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) outbreak in the U. S. on the Japanese beef market. The time-varying Armington model allows us to examine how the BSE outbreak affected the elasticity of substitution and the country of origin bias. Moreover, I estimate beef demands in the case that the BSE outbreak did not occur. The BSE outbreak caused higher demand for Australian beef and lower demand for U. S. beef, while domestic beef demand was only modestly affected. Specifically, the outbreak affected imported frozen beef demands more than imported chilled beef demands. The third essay explores the impact of tariff rate quota (TRQ) on the Korean rice market. Korea replaced its rice import quota with a TRQ in 2015. A structural model representing the Korean rice market is developed to evaluate this new trade policy and examine the possibility of Korean rice imports under uncertainty. Results indicate that rice imports in excess of the current TRQ quantity are unlikely for a range of market conditions. Two scenarios, which are the over-quota tariff rate reduction and the Minimum Market Access (MMA) quantity expansion, show how the market responds to policy changes. In addition, Korean rice imports are sensitive to consumer preferences for different rice types...|$|R
40|$|Since the mid- 1990 s the European Union (EU) {{has been}} at the {{forefront}} of attempts to strengthen and promote the social dimension of globalisation through trade, focusing chiefly on the promotion of labour standards internationally through increased cooperation with the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and through its external trade policies. In a recent Communication on trade, growth and development the European Commission (2012) mentioned the need for change in order to foster growth, to develop synergies between trade and development policies and the importance of projecting the EU?s values and interests in the world, highlighting how the respect for human rights represents one of its core values in its external action. This is seen as part of the EU 2020 Strategy. In addition, the reform of the EU?s Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) to be implemented in 2014 is said to help the poorest developing countries. However, this stated different and more humane approach to trade begs an apparently very simple question: who are the beneficiaries of such change? In the current multi-polar system in which the EU no longer constitutes the centre stage of global policy making and in the context of the EU?s ?deep trade agenda?, namely the push for further trade liberalisation focusing on the removal of domestic <b>non-tariff</b> regulatory <b>measures,</b> as well as the escalation of the euro-zone crisis which is also unravelling, among other problems, the lack of solidarity among EU Member States and the inability to fight protectionism in situ, the legitimacy and credibility of EU action is called into question. The chapter explores the role the EU has committed itself to in relation to the promotion of social rights and international labour standards in its Common Commercial Policy (CCP). In particular, it seeks to critically examine who the real beneficiaries of the social conditionality imposed by the Commission in the EU?s external trade policy are. Indeed, the injection of a human rights agenda in the EU?s external trade policy raises many complex questions in relation to competence, coherence, effectiveness and legitimacy of the EU as a global actor. Furthermore, the conception of labour rights as human rights remains a moot and controversial question. This explains why at present there is little understanding of how to ensure the protection and promotion of social rights effectively through the EU?s external trade policy. In turn, this makes it all the more difficult to fully grasp what the role of the EU can be in developing a linkage between trade and the social, thus ensuring a system of trade promoting more equitable global trade and sustainability, which is founded on discourses of social responsibility and justice in addition to free trade and open market economies. This analysis is particularly prominent and made necessary by fundamental changes introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon (TL) specifically in relation to the CCP as well as the EU?s envisaged accession to the ECHR and the conferral of the same legal value of the Treaties to the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, which combined with other key institutional changes, will impact on the EU internal policies as well as the EU?s external action. In the light of these constitutional, institutional and substantive changes, the chapter explores whether it is possible to develop a legitimate and effective CCP in a globalised economy and draw some tentative conclusions as to what the above role of the EU in its external trade relations may tell us more generally about the EU?s humaneness...|$|R
40|$|Since the Single European Market (SEM) {{has been}} established, the free {{movement}} of goods has been facilitated not only by removing border formalities, {{but also by the}} technical harmonisation of national legislation in each member state. For the agri-food sector a particular concern is to guarantee the safety and integrity of products. In this respect, the European Commission has developed a stringent policy regarding food safety (sanitary and phytosanitary measures) and consumer information (quality measures). Strict regulation is therefore imposed for all agri-food products commercialised in the SEM, whether of European or third countries. In the case of EU enlargement, accession to the SEM is conditional upon the candidate countries accepting the obligations of the internal market, and therefore accepting these principles of free trade. Fulfilling the requirements for EU accession means for acceding countries not only costs related to adjustments of their production technologies in order to be consistent with the acquis communautaire, but also benefits. Particularly, there will be measurable gains for the new member states (NMS), that should benefit from the abolishment of the tariff barriers and the decreasing impact of the <b>non-tariffs</b> <b>measures,</b> once they have adopted the EU standards and from the reduction of the transaction costs. The aim {{of this paper is to}} assess the impact of trade barriers on agri-food exports from Central and Eastern European Countries (CEECs) to the EU on the eve of their integration. Do the gradual tariff reduction and the convergence of production standards implied by the implementation of the acquis communautaire over the pre-accession period reduce the border effect of CECCs agri-food products when entering the European markets? At accession time do these countries enjoy equal access to the EU market as the old EU members do, or are they still in the same situation in terms of market access as any other third country? For answering these questions, a gravity modelling on disaggregated data of agri-food imports of the EU- 15 in 1999 and 2004 is used. The model proposes an adaptation of the border effect methodology initiated by McCallum (1995) and widely used after (see among others Chen, 2004; Mayer and Zignago, 2005). More precisely, the principle of the analysis from the national borders to the external frontiers of the European Union was extended, assuming that the SEM is an integrated area with low trade barriers. In other words, the objective of the paper is to measure the impact of EU borders (called hereafter border effect) and assess the role of tariffs and non tariffs measures (NTMs) in the explanation of this effect. Hence, just before joining the SEM, do NMS still face a significant border effect at entry to the EU market? Has this effect been reduced over the period of preparation for EU accession ? Since most impediments to trade are difficult to measure, the model includes a global measure of trade resistances faced by CEECs at entry to the EU market (as defined by Mayer and Zignago (2005)). First, Results estimated for 1999 and 2004 show the magnitude of the border effect faced by trading partners at entry to the SEM. This effect is captured separately for three geographical zones: new member states (NMS: Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia), acceding countries (AC: Romania, Bulgaria) and rest of the world. For the three groups, the coefficient is significantly negative showing that all third countries exchange less with EU countries than EU members among themselves. Contrary to what might be expected, the border effect is highest for NMS. Second, the border effect is split between tariffs, the impact of NTMs and remaining trade resistance for third countries at entry to the EU market. Concerning the impact of tariffs, the results highlight the reduction in tariff elasticity for NMS whilst this coefficient remains stable for the rest of the world. It is noteworthy that tariffs no longer act as a trade barrier anymore in 2004 for NMS. This is an expected result, since tariffs for NMS were abolished in May 2004, the date of the EU enlargement. However, in 1999 the impact of tariffs was still high because the liberalisation process was far from complete. Regarding NTMs, three dummies indicating respectively whether sanitary, phytosanitary or quality measures exist are included in the model. Sanitary measures include veterinary measures for animals (breeding and production) designed to protect both animal and public health. Phytosanitary measures refer to standards defining the maximum residue level of pesticides. Quality measures cover the set of standards relating to product quality control, other than sanitary and phytosanitary requirements, for instance commercial characteristics such as freshness, calibration, labelling and conditioning. For NMS, the impact of NTMs on exports towards EU- 15 should expectedly tend to be similar to those for the intra EU- 15 trade at the moment of accession to the EU. Such a result in 2004 would clearly suggest the positive role of the acquis communautaire. The impact of NTMs on traded volume is not clear and according to the literature can both stimulate or reduce traded volume. In order to distinguish the decision to trade from the volume traded and to analyse impact of NTMs on those two steps, the gravity model proposed was estimated using the Heckman procedure. Obtained results show that for NMS, sanitary measures do not act as a barrier to trade at entry to the EU market and even significantly stimulate traded volume for NMS firms fulfilling sanitary requirements. For ACs these measures still act as barrier to trade, and once the barrier has been overcome, traded volume is lightly increasing. Phytosanitary measures do not act as barrier to trade at entry to the EU market for CEECs product (both from NMS and ACs) but still limit traded volume. These results call for two comments. The first comment deals with the CEECs fulfilments of the EU requirement (in other word, the adoption and implementation of the acquis communautaire). Sanitary measures have been fulfilled in NMS leading to a non significant impact of such measures on decision to trade, whereas for ACs it was not the case, justifying therefore the transition period imposed by European authorities. Concerning phytosanitary measures, they do not act as trade barriers for CEECs product rather because the use level of pesticide is structurally low in those countries than because of the technological changes related to the implementation of the acquis communautaire. The second comment deals with the opposite impacts of sanitary and phytosanitary measures on traded volume. Results concerning sanitary measures is easily explained because the high degree of food safety policies integration in the EU. Since the BSE crisis the European authorities have harmonised their sanitary measures to a very high degree. The harmonisation is much more complete in the sanitary field than in the other. Fulfilment of the EU sanitary requirements by NMS firms therefore enhances their traded volume. Phytosanitary and quality measures, far from integration on the SEM, still limit traded volume. Even the intra EU- 15 trade is concerned by the negative role of those measures both on the decision to trade and on the traded volume. Results also show border effect is not totally explained by tariffs and NTMs; remaining trade resistances are still significant. In other words, determinants other than tariffs and NTMs explain trade resistance at entry to the EU market. This is particularly true for NMS for which the border effect remains high. How can this remaining high level of trade resistance be explained? Among transition-related factors that impede trade and are difficult to measure, the low quality of transport infrastructures, the lack of expertise of foreign firms in doing business with these countries, as well as institutional uncertainties surrounding the transition process can be mentioned. The role of history also offers some explanations for the geographical orientation of CEECs traders away from the EU (trade flows between the Czech and Slovak Republics, between the Baltic states, and between Slovenia and former Yugoslavia still remain quite strong). This is what Anderson and van Wincoop call the multilateral trade resistances.
