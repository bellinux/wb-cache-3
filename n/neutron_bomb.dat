5|$|Tippett {{maintained}} his pacifist beliefs, while becoming generally less public in expressing them, and from 1959 {{served as president}} of the Peace Pledge Union. In 1977 he made a rare political statement when, opening a PPU exhibition at St Martin-in-the-Fields, he attacked President Carter's plans to develop a <b>neutron</b> <b>bomb.</b>|$|E
5|$|After Mayor Quimby {{makes an}} {{offensive}} joke about France, {{and refuses to}} apologize, the French president launches a <b>neutron</b> <b>bomb</b> directly into Springfield, killing everyone except Homer, who had been inspecting a bomb shelter he was considering buying from Herman's military surplus store. After the blast, Homer emerges from the shelter {{and seems to be}} the only person in town to survive the blast, but he is soon confronted by a band of hostile Springfield citizens who have become mutants. Homer flees back home where he discovers that his family survived the blast because their house was protected by its layers of lead paint. Marge and the children kill the mutants with shotguns that they were hiding behind their backs and the family head off to steal some Ferraris.|$|E

25|$|For weapon use, fission is {{necessary}} to start fusion, helps to sustain fusion, and captures and multiplies the energy carried by the fusion neutrons. In {{the case of a}} <b>neutron</b> <b>bomb</b> (see below), the last-mentioned factor does not apply, since the objective is to facilitate the escape of neutrons, rather than to use them to increase the weapon's raw power.|$|E

25|$|Toward {{the end of}} the Cold War, {{capitalism}} {{created a}} military horror: the <b>neutron</b> <b>bomb,</b> a weapon that destroys life while leaving buildings intact. During the Fourth World War, however, a new wonder has been discovered: the financial bomb. Unlike those dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, this new bomb not only destroys the polis (here, the nation), imposing death, terror, and misery on those who live there, but also transforms its target into just another piece in the puzzle of economic globalization.|$|E
25|$|A <b>neutron</b> <b>bomb</b> is only {{feasible}} if {{the yield}} is sufficiently high that efficient fusion stage ignition is possible, {{and if the}} yield is low enough that the case thickness will not absorb too many neutrons. This means that neutron bombs have a yield range of 1–10 kilotons, with fission proportion varying from 50% at 1-kiloton to 25% at 10-kilotons (all of which comes from the primary stage). The neutron output per kiloton is then 10–15 times greater than for a pure fission implosion weapon or for a strategic warhead like a W87 or W88.|$|E
25|$|A <b>neutron</b> <b>bomb,</b> {{technically}} {{referred to}} as an enhanced radiation weapon (ERW), {{is a type of}} tactical nuclear weapon designed specifically to release a large portion of its energy as energetic neutron radiation. This contrasts with standard thermonuclear weapons, which are designed to capture this intense neutron radiation to increase its overall explosive yield. In terms of yield, ERWs typically produce about one-tenth that of a fission-type atomic weapon. Even with their significantly lower explosive power, ERWs are still capable of much greater destruction than any conventional bomb. Meanwhile, relative to other nuclear weapons, damage is more focused on biological material than on material infrastructure (though extreme blast and heat effects are not eliminated).|$|E

25|$|The TV Century 21 Dalek {{comic strip}} {{presents}} a different description of Skaro’s sentient life. One race, the Daleks, are depicted as short, blue-skinned, aggressive humanoids. They {{are engaged in}} a vicious war against the Thals who, although not shown in the strip, are described as tall, handsome, peaceful and living in constant fear of Dalek attack. The Daleks build a <b>neutron</b> <b>bomb</b> to finally bring the conflict to an end but a meteorite storm detonates the device prematurely, apparently destroying most of the life on Skaro. A mutated Dalek commandeers a prototype war machine, created shortly before the holocaust, to act as a mobile protective casing. It then convinces the last two humanoid Daleks, Yarvelling and Zolfian, to build more casings for the many other mutants which have survived. No further mention of the Thals is made in the strip, the implication being that they all perished in the nuclear conflagration.|$|E
25|$|The BBC-licensed The Dalek Book (1964) {{includes}} a map entitled 'The Dalography of Skaro' on which three continents are shown; Dalazar, Darren and Davius. Dalazar {{is described as}} the most habitable part of Skaro, having a sub-tropical climate and being {{the location of the}} Dalek city. To the south-east is the Lake of Mutations and to the south the Drammankins mountain range, which stretches across the entire continent from the east to west coast. To the north-east Dalazar is joined to the continent of Darren by a land bridge. Darren is indicated to be the site of the <b>neutron</b> <b>bomb</b> explosion which transformed the Daleks from their humanoid form into mutants. The north and south regions are separated by the ‘Radiation Range’ mountains. The third continent, Davius, is shown divided into east and west regions by the ‘River of Whirling Waters’, with the eastern region being identified as the home of the Thals. Five seas are shown; the Ocean of Ooze, Sea of Acid, Sea of Rust, Serpent Sea and the land-locked Bottomless Sea. Other major features are the Island of Moving Mountains and an island chain named the Forbidden Islands, both situated in the Ocean of Ooze, and the Island of Gushing Gold located in the Sea of Rust.|$|E
500|$|Suicide by fire {{is another}} common theme in Vonnegut's works; the author often {{returns to the}} theory that [...] "many people are not fond of life." [...] He uses this as an {{explanation}} for why humans have so severely damaged their environments, and made devices such as nuclear weapons that can make their creators extinct. In Deadeye Dick, Vonnegut features the <b>neutron</b> <b>bomb,</b> designed to kill people, but leave buildings and structures untouched. He also uses this theme to demonstrate the recklessness of those who put powerful, apocalypse-inducing devices {{at the disposal of}} politicians.|$|E
50|$|Furthermore, {{the neutron}} {{absorption}} spectrum of air is disputed by some authorities, and depends {{in part on}} absorption by hydrogen from water vapor.

50|$|In {{much the}} same fashion as the area denial effect {{resulting}} from fission product (the substances that make up most fallout) contamination in an area following a conventional surface burst nuclear explosion, as considered in the Korean War by Douglas MacArthur, it would thus {{be a form of}} radiological warfare—with the difference that <b>neutron</b> <b>bombs</b> produce half, or less, of the quantity of fission products relative to the same-yield pure fission bomb. Radiological warfare with <b>neutron</b> <b>bombs</b> that rely on fission primaries would thus still produce fission fallout, albeit a comparatively cleaner and shorter lasting version of it in the area if air bursts were used, as little to no fission products would be deposited on the direct immediate area, instead becoming diluted global fallout.|$|R
500|$|Two warheads were {{designed}} for Sprint starting in 1963, the W65 at Livermore and the W66 at Los Alamos. The W65 was entering Phase 3 testing in October 1965 with a design yield of around 5kT, but this was cancelled in January 1968 {{in favor of the}} W66. The W66's explosive yield was reported to have been in the [...] "low kiloton" [...] range, with various references claiming it was anywhere from 1 to 20kT. The W66 was the first enhanced radiation bomb, or <b>neutron</b> <b>bomb,</b> to be fully developed; it was tested in the late 1960s and entered production in June 1974.|$|E

500|$|Zeus A was {{designed}} to attack warheads through shock effects, like the Hercules, and was to be armed with a relatively small nuclear warhead. As the range and altitude requirements grew, along with {{a better understanding of}} weapons effects at high altitude, the Zeus B was intended to attack its targets through the action of neutron heating. This relied on the interceptor's warhead releasing a huge number of high energy neutrons (similar to the <b>neutron</b> <b>bomb),</b> some of which would hit the enemy warhead. These would cause fission to occur in some of the warhead's own nuclear fuel, rapidly heating the [...] "primary", hopefully enough to cause it to melt.

500|$|A {{proponent of}} {{tactical}} nuclear weapons, Agnew {{pointed out in}} 1970 that the Thanh Hoa Bridge in Vietnam required hundreds of sorties to destroy with conventional weapons when a nuclear weapon could have done the job with just one. In a 1977 article for the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, Agnew argued that the fusion reactions of neutron bombs could provide [...] "tactical" [...] advantages over conventional fission weapons, especially in countering the [...] "massive armor component possessed by the Eastern bloc." [...] Citing conclusions reached by the Rand Corporation, Agnew argued that without affecting the armor of a tank, the neutrons produced by a fusion blast would penetrate the vehicle and [...] "in {{a matter of a}} few tens of minutes to hours kill or make the crew completely ineffective." [...] Because the <b>neutron</b> <b>bomb</b> reduced collateral damage, it could be used in a much more selective fashion than a fission weapon, thereby providing a clear [...] "advantage for the military defender as well as for the nearby non-combatant." ...|$|E

25|$|So-called <b>neutron</b> <b>bombs</b> (enhanced {{radiation}} weapons) {{have been}} constructed which release a larger fraction of their energy as ionizing radiation (specifically, neutrons), but these are all thermonuclear devices which rely on the nuclear fusion stage to produce the extra radiation.

50|$|Using <b>neutron</b> <b>bombs</b> to stop {{an enemy}} armored attack by rapidly incapacitating crews with {{a dose of}} 8000+ rads of {{radiation}} would require exploding large numbers of them to blanket the enemy forces, destroying all normal civilian buildings within c. 600 meters of the immediate area. Neutron activation from the explosions could make many building materials in the city radioactive, such as zinc coated steel/galvanized steel (see area denial use below).|$|R
50|$|In addition, the use {{of heavy}} water as a {{moderator}} results {{in the production of}} small amounts of tritium when the deuterium nuclei in the heavy water absorb neutrons, a very inefficient reaction.
