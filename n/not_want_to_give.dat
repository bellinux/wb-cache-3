5|$|On 27 April Model {{met with}} Hitler {{to review and}} express his concern for {{reconnaissance}} information which showed the Red Army constructing very strong positions at {{the shoulders of the}} salient and having withdrawn their mobile forces from the area west of Kursk. He argued that the longer the preparation phase continued, the less the operation could be justified. He recommended completely abandoning Citadel, allowing the army to await and defeat the coming Soviet offensive, or radically revising the plan for Citadel. Though in mid-April Manstein had considered the Citadel offensive profitable, by May he shared Model's misgivings. He asserted that the best course of action would be for the German forces to take the strategic defensive, ceding ground to allow the anticipated Soviet forces to extend themselves and allow the German panzer forces to counterattack in the type of fluid mobile battle at which they excelled. Convinced that the Red Army would deliver its main effort against Army Group South, he proposed to keep the left wing of the army group strong while moving the right wing back in stages to the Dnieper River, followed by a counterattack against the flank of the Red Army advance. The counteroffensive would continue until the Sea of Azov was reached and the Soviet forces were cut off. Hitler rejected this idea; he did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> up so much terrain, even temporarily.|$|E
25|$|Sir Samuel Instone and {{his brother}} Theodore offered Matthews a huge salary if he would keep the ray in Britain and {{demonstrate}} that it actually worked. Matthews refused again – he did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> any proof that the ray worked as he claimed it would.|$|E
25|$|According to the Soviet law of 29 November 1939, all {{residents}} of the annexed area, referred to as citizens of former Poland, automatically acquired the Soviet citizenship. Residents were still required and pressured to consent and those who opted out (most Poles did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> up the Polish citizenship) were threatened with repatriation to Nazi controlled territories of Poland.|$|E
50|$|Pankow {{earned a}} full music {{scholarship}} to Quincy College, {{where he studied}} the bass trombone. After completing his first year, he returned home for the summer and formed a band that began to play some live local shows. <b>Not</b> <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> up this work, Pankow transferred to DePaul University.|$|R
50|$|Behind him in {{the tunnel}} were seven British and four Polish officers. On his order the {{remaining}} men backed up the tunnel to evade detection, but the Germans were waiting for them outside the canteen. <b>Not</b> <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> their captors any satisfaction, the British burst into laughter as they came out.|$|R
50|$|Azevedo {{spent the}} next four years {{fighting}} in Argentina and fought a total of 38 times. During this time he had a shocking 15 draws. His manager attributed the draws to Azevedo being a Brazilian in Argentina and the officials <b>not</b> <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> him the wins, while giving Argentine fighters losses.|$|R
25|$|Although the Danish Army {{had been}} forewarned of the attack, it was denied {{permission}} to deploy or prepare defensive positions as the Danish government did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> the Germans any provocation for their actions. All that {{was available to}} meet the land invasion were small and scattered units of the frontier guard and elements of the Jutland division. Believing attack was imminent, the troops were placed on full alert at 13:30 on 8 April.|$|E
25|$|The Iranian {{authorities}} {{assert that}} they cannot simply trust the United States or Europe to provide Iran with nuclear energy fuel, {{and point to}} {{a long series of}} agreements, contracts and treaty obligations which were not fulfilled. Developing nations say they do <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> up their rights to uranium enrichment and do not trust the United States or other nuclear countries to be consistent suppliers of the nuclear material they would need to run their power plants.|$|E
25|$|In 1976 {{the groups}} {{struggled}} on {{allocation of funds}} among the Oklahoma and Florida tribes. Based on early 20th-century population records, at which time {{most of the people}} were full-blood, the Seminole Tribe of Oklahoma was to receive three-quarters of the judgment and the Florida peoples one-quarter. The Miccosukee and allied Traditionals filed suit against the settlement in 1976 to refuse the money; they did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> up their claim for return of lands in Florida.|$|E
50|$|Rusinow {{leads from}} honor {{sequences}} are used against suit contracts. If leading a spot card and <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> count, the lowest card was led from an odd number of cards {{and the third}} best was led from an even number of cards; if leading from a worthless holding and <b>not</b> <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> count, the highest card you could afford was led.|$|R

Hercules, <b>not</b> <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> Alceste's disguise away, tells Admetus that he was unable to find her in Hades. It seems to Admetus that his duty is now to marry Antigona.|$|R
25|$|<b>Not</b> <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> {{the enemy}} room to manoeuvre, John I and his supreme general took the {{offensive}} and raided several Castilian towns, defeating {{once again a}} much larger Castilian army at the Battle of Valverde. He continued {{to watch out for}} Juan I of Castile, until his death in 1390. When hostilities ended, he gave the bulk of his wealth to the veterans.|$|R
25|$|Green {{quotes a}} {{complaint}} by historian Manuel Barrios about one Inquisitor, Diego Rodriguez Lucero, who in Cordoba in 1506 {{burned to death}} the husbands of two different women he then kept as mistresses. According to Barrios, the daughter of Diego Celemin was exceptionally beautiful, her parents and her husband did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> her to , and so Lucero had {{the three of them}} burnt and now has a child by her, and he has kept {{for a long time in}} the alcazar as a mistress.|$|E
25|$|Burnside {{dispatched}} some cavalry reinforcements to Rosecrans {{and made}} preparations for {{an expedition to}} clear the roads and gaps from East Tennessee to Virginia and if possible secure the saltworks beyond Abingdon. During this time, the Battle of Chickamauga loomed, and frantic requests from Washington, D.C., to move south and reinforce Rosecrans were effectively ignored by Burnside, who did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> up his newly occupied territory and its loyal citizens. Furthermore, Burnside was encountering difficulties in moving supplies through the rugged territory and was concerned that if he moved even farther from his supply base, he might get into serious difficulty.|$|E
25|$|Eddie Gard {{had been}} {{contacted}} by Salvatore Sollazzo, {{the man responsible}} for operating the point shaving scandals at several New York City schools between the late 1940s and 1951 (City College of New York, Manhattan College, New York University and Long Island University). Sollazzo was a 45-year-old jeweler and gambler who had spent five years in prison during the 1930s. Gard's family was poor and he did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> up a steady income of cash, which amounted to $1,000 per player per thrown game. The original LIU players involved were Gard, Bigos and Feurtado. Eventually White and LeRoy Smith joined.|$|E
5000|$|Miserliness (ser-sna) {{is a part}} {{of longing}} desire (Sanskrit: raga) and is an {{attachment}} to material gain or respect and, <b>not</b> <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> up any possessions, clings to them and does <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> share them with others or use them ourselves. Thus, miserliness is more than the English word stinginess. Stinginess is merely unwillingness to share or to use something we possess. It lacks the aspect of hoarding that miserliness possesses.|$|R

50|$|Luo {{was arrested}} in 2006 when several former victims {{informed}} the police about his crimes. Investigators found that at least 26 girls had been raped. The official number of assault victims was deemed to be 39, but the actual number was probably higher due <b>to</b> some victims <b>not</b> <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> evidence. Luo raped one girl repeatedly through six years of her primary schooling. He raped another victim more than 10 times when she was 12 years old.|$|R
25|$|The producer's {{first choice}} {{for the role of}} Prem Kumar was Shahrukh Khan, an {{established}} Bollywood star and host of the 2007 series of Kaun Banega Crorepati (the Indian version of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?). However Khan turned down the role, concerned that he did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> his audience the impression that the real show was a fraud by playing a fraud host in the movie. Despite the subsequent success of the film, Khan has stated that he does not regret turning the role down and has been a vociferous supporter of the film to its critics.|$|E
25|$|Modi and Tikolo put on 35 {{more before}} Modi {{was out to}} van Bunge, who thus ended with the best bowling figures for the Netherlands, with his three for 51, while Tikolo was not out on 212, his second double century in the Intercontinental Cup. It left the Netherlands with a lead of 107, and as they did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> Kenya the 14 points {{available}} for the win, they batted out the day for a draw. Van Bunge ended unbeaten on 70, while five Kenyan bowlers got a wicket each, and when stumps were drawn {{on the final day}} Netherlands were 202 for 5.|$|E
25|$|Churchill's {{other main}} concern while Colonial Secretary was the Middle East. He wanted Egypt (then {{administered}} by the Foreign Office) to be brought under his department's control. He was faced with continuing riots and communal violence in {{those parts of the}} former Ottoman Empire that British forces occupied after World War I. Most of these riots were against the British occupation. Churchill did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> the complete independence that some of the Arabs had been promised. Rather, his aims were to reduce the British forces in the region and to ensure that British interests, particularly in the air route to India and the oil fields, were protected. The local population was a less important issue.|$|E
50|$|<b>Not</b> <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> up music, {{they quickly}} formed two new bands - Park Brigade (Jubby) and The Flying Squad (Ben, Birchy, and Mark). Park Brigade split in early 2009. Jubby is {{currently}} doing solo {{work with his}} band The Absinthe Tears, and Mark rejoins him on stage - this time behind a piano. In March 2010, The Flying Squad changed their name to Black Flowers and Mark played his final show in December of the same year.|$|R
50|$|<b>Not</b> <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> up, CC Puan {{stepped in}} and took the CEO role and {{determined}} to sustain the employment of his hopeful and talented team. CC Puan maintained a small R&D team in the US and moved its headquarter and its entire operations back to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, forming Green Packet Berhad (GPB). This reduced operating cost substantially and allowed the company to refocus its business on the emerging markets of the Southeast Asian countries.|$|R

25|$|In March 1960, first-term U.S. Senator Richard L. Neuberger died in office. Despite {{calls to}} appoint his widow, Maurine Brown Neuberger, to the position, Governor Mark Hatfield instead {{appointed}} Oregon Supreme Court justice Hall S. Lusk {{to fill the}} position until a November special election. Hatfield stated {{that he intended to}} have appointed Neuberger, but that he wanted to appoint someone who would be focused on completing the remaining eight months of the term and not running in the regular-term Senate election as Neuberger had announced she would. Some observers noted that Hatfield, a Republican, though required by state law to appoint someone of the same political party as the late Senator Neuberger, did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> the other party the political advantage of incumbency.|$|E
25|$|In {{the winter}} of 1954–1955, William Shockley, an {{inventor}} of the transistor and a visiting professor at Stanford University, decided to establish his own mass production of advanced transistors and Shockley diodes. He found a sponsor in Raytheon, but Raytheon discontinued the project after a month. In August 1955 Shockley turned for advice to the financier Arnold Beckman, the owner of Beckman Instruments. Shockley needed one million dollars. Beckman knew that Shockley had no chance in the business, but believed that Shockley's new inventions would be beneficial for his own company and did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> them to his competitors. Accordingly, Beckman agreed to create and fund a laboratory {{under the condition that}} its discoveries should be brought to mass production within two years.|$|E
25|$|During {{early summer}} 2002, Rosa {{suddenly}} laid down work. As an artist {{he could not}} live under the conditions Egmont was offering him, but he did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> up making Scrooge McDuck comics either. So, his only choice was to go on hiatus and try {{to come to an}} agreement with Egmont. His main issues were that he had no control over his works. Rosa had discovered too often that his stories were printed with incorrect pages of art, improper colors, poor lettering, or pixelated computer conversions of the illustrations. Another matter was that his name was used in promotion of books and collections of stories without his agreement and without sending royalties to him. Rosa has never, as with any other Disney artist, received royalties for a single use of any of his stories worldwide.|$|E
50|$|This custom {{is said to}} be {{analogous}} to the ritual of bowing to someone in appreciation. The origin of this gesture is described anecdotally: The Qianlong Emperor went to yum cha with his friends, outside the palace; <b>not</b> <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> attract attention to himself, the Emperor was disguised. While at yum cha, the Emperor poured his companion some tea, which was a great honor. The companion, <b>not</b> <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> away the Emperor's identity in public by bowing, instead tapped his index and middle finger on the table as a sign of appreciation.|$|R
2500|$|At {{the same}} time they {{announced}} the name change, the Angels aggressively marketed themselves to Los Angeles, buying space on nearly 500 billboards in the area that read simply [...] "City of ANGELS" [...] in the team's wordmark.

50|$|In 2006 {{the rivalry}} was officially renewed, {{returning}} to yearly {{play for the}} first time since 1994. The teams began play that year and continued until 2009, when it was announced that LSU would pay Tulane $700,000 to void the final six years of the home-and-home series. LSU held that it would benefit if the remaining games were all played in Baton Rouge. <b>Not</b> <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> up its home games, Tulane agreed to end the series early, though the teams did agree to play one future game in New Orleans.|$|R
25|$|Catherine did {{initiate}} {{some changes}} to serfdom, though. If a noble {{did not live}} up to his side of the deal, then the serfs could file complaints against him by following the proper channels of law. Catherine gave them this new right, but in exchange they could no longer appeal directly to her. She did this because {{she did not want to}} be bothered by the peasantry, but did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> them reason to revolt, either. In this act, though, she unintentionally gave the serfs a legitimate bureaucratic status they had lacked before. Some serfs were able to use their new status to their advantage. For example, serfs could apply to be freed if they were under illegal ownership, and non-nobles were not allowed to own serfs. Some serfs did apply for freedom and were, surprisingly, successful. In addition, some governors listened to the complaints of serfs and punished nobles, but this was by no means all-inclusive.|$|E

[...] "He did <b>not</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> the state the satisfaction of watching him die", Hagmaier said. Ted Bundy died in the Raiford electric chair at 7:16a.m. EST on January 24, 1989; he was 42 years old. Hundreds of revelers—including 20 off-duty police officers, by one account—sang, danced and set off fireworks in a pasture {{across the street from the}} prison as the execution was carried out, then cheered loudly as the white hearse containing Bundy's corpse departed the prison. His remains were cremated in Gainesville, and the ashes scattered at an undisclosed location in the Cascade Range of Washington State, in accordance with his will.|$|E
50|$|<b>Not</b> <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> up on a {{potential}} financial windfall for his team, Streigel {{went ahead with}} the game. He would later claim he had received verbal permission from the NFL by telephone, though he gave inconsistent responses as to which official he had spoken to. The Maroons won the game 9-7, which was considered a major win for professional football, but the match only attracted about 8,000 fans, a major financial disappointment. As threatened, Carr suspended Pottsville and removed them from the NFL, preventing them from finishing their schedule.|$|R
