This article presents the use of Data Envelopment Analysis models, to determine overall technical efficiency, pure technical efficiency and scale efficiency of metallurgical branches in Poland. The average technical efficiency of metallurgical industry in Poland was quite high. The analysis gives a possibility to create a ranking of sectors. Three branches were found to be fully efficient: manufacture of basic iron and steel and of ferroalloys, manufacture of basic precious and other <b>non</b> - <b>ferrous</b> metals and manufacture of tubes, pipes, hollow profiles and related fittings, of steel.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} laser {{surface modification}} work performed {{to improve the}} lifetime of die materials. Die material AISI H 13, with typical hardness {{in the range of}} 42 to 48 HRC, offers high wear and corrosion resistance. However the cyclic high temperature conditions along with exposure to high viscosity molten metal in semi 6 solid forming cause the die to wear and crack with resultant shortened die lifetime. In this study, the thermal stability of die material at elevated temperature was investigated through micro 6 hardness testing and a metallographic study. AISI H 13 samples were laser glazed using CO 2 continuous wave mode laser with 10. 6 9 m wavelength. Samples were attached to a specially designed rotating chuck to enable it to be rotated at speeds up to 1500 rpm and allow flat surface glazing to take place. The microhardness was measured for as 6 glazed samples and annealed samples which were held at temperatures ranging from 550 oC to 800 oC with 50 oC intervals. The metallographic study conducted examined the formation of three zones at different depths which were the glazed zone, the heat affected zone and the substrate. As a result of rapid heating and cooling from the laser glazing process, a metallic glass layer was developed which exhibited an average micro 6 hardness of 900 HV when exposed to 3. 34 E+ 10 W/m 2 laser irradiance within a range of 3. 64 to 5. 66 ms exposure time. Crystallization in glazed zone increased as the annealing temperature increased. As the annealing temperature reached above approximately 600 oC, the microhardness decreased to approximately 600 HV (equivalent to approx. 54 HRC) due to local crystallization. These findings show potential direct application of glazed dies for <b>non</b> 6 <b>ferrous</b> semisolid forming and the requirement for thermal barrier protection for application at higher temperatures...|$|R
