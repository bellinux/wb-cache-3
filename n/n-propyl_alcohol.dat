40|$|AbstractThese {{are many}} {{volatile}} organic compounds (VOCs) that are synthesized, produced from petroleum or derived from natural compounds, mostly plants. Fragrant and {{volatile organic compounds}} from plants {{have been used as}} food additives, medicines and aromatherapy. Several clinical and pathological studies have shown that chronic abuse of VOCs, mainly toluene, causes several neuropsychiatric disorders. Little is known about the mechanisms of neurotoxicity of the solvents. n-Octanal, nonanal, and 2 -ethyl- 1 -hexanol, which are used catalyzers or intermediates of chemical reactions, are released into the environment. Essential oils have the functions of self-defense, sterilization, and antibiosis in plants. When volatile organic compounds enter the body, there is the possibility that they will pass through the blood–brain barrier (BBB) and affect the central nervous system (CNS). However, the direct effects of volatile organic compounds on neural function and their toxicities are still unclear. We compared the toxicities of n-octanal, nonanal and 2 -ethyl- 1 -hexanol with those of five naturally derived fragrant organic compounds (FOCs), linalool, cis- 3 -hexen- 1 -ol, isoamyl alcohol, <b>n-propyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> and n-phenethyl alcohol.
