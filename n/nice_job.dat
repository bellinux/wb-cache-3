Robin Pierson of The TV Critic rated the episode 36 out of 100, stating that [...] "the craft has gone from the stories and jokes in favour {{of the most basic}} stories and punch lines."

He called it [...] "the best so far of season three, as it did a <b>nice</b> <b>job</b> of {{going back and forth}} between the mystery of the week, the ongoing rape storyline, and Veronica's personal issues, with each aspect well-represented. While displeased with Hearst's acting, he called the storyline [...] "good, fun stuff". He also enjoyed the emotional advancement of Veronica and Logan's relationship, writing that he showed genuine emotion in the episode, in contrast to his usual sarcastic demeanor. Reviewer Alan Sepinwall, on his blog What's Alan Watching, called it [...] "one of the season's strongest episodes."

On another note, The Guardians Alexis Petridis suggested that the [...] "striking and beautiful" [...] ballads in the album [...] "evince a certain new-found maturity". Petridis felt that [...] "One" [...] is a [...] "haunting, falsetto-powered" [...] ballad. Annie Zaleski of The A.V. Club noted Sheeran's [...] "weak-kneed" [...] falsetto in the [...] "fragile acoustic pop". Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe noted similarities between [...] "One" [...] and Sheeran's 2011 single [...] "The A Team" [...] for their tunefulness; she described the former as [...] "burbling". Dave Hanratty of Drowned in Sound had the same opinion: [...] "'One' [...] cut from the exact same cloth as 'The A Team'", although he favored [...] "One" [...] as better.

In a retrospective {{of the first}} season in Entertainment Weekly, [...] "Eve" [...] was rated a B+, with the episode being called [...] "tidy, satisfying, and suspenseful". The episode's premise and the casting of Harris were both cited as highlights. Keith Phipps, writing for The A.V. Club, also rated the episode a B+, calling it [...] "a nicely realized episode" [...] that [...] "does a <b>nice</b> <b>job</b> building slowly and offering some shocks along the way".

500|$|Mitchell was {{selected}} by the Philadelphia Eagles {{in the first round}} (25th overall) of the 2001 NFL Draft. He was the fifth wide receiver taken in the draft. He worked out with his new quarterback Donovan McNabb in Arizona and Los Angeles before mini-camp started. Because of NCAA rules regarding graduation, Mitchell was unable to attend the Eagles' mini-camp until after UCLA's senior class graduated. He studied the Eagles' playbook in the meantime. He asked the NFL for an exemption, but the league refused, and he arrived for his first practice on June 18, 2001. Mitchell signed a five-year, $5.5million contract with the Eagles on July 26, in time for the start of training camp. During training camp, Mitchell practiced as a backup behind James Thrash and Todd Pinkston. Special teams coordinator John Harbaugh asked Mitchell if he was willing to practice as a kickoff returner in practice, but Mitchell declined, citing the fracture of his femur on a kickoff return in college. Nonetheless, he still practiced on the kickoff coverage team, and on the punt coverage team as a gunner. Mitchell suffered a hip pointer during the morning session on July 31, but returned for the afternoon session without limitation. A hamstring injury limited him at the end of training camp. Before the start of the 2001 season, head coach Andy Reid said, [...] "Mentally, [...] right there. He's picked everything up, he's a smart kid. He's wide-eyed, ready to learn. He's done a <b>nice</b> <b>job</b> when he's been in there." ...|$|E
500|$|Entertainment Weeklys Carina Chocano praised The O.C. {{for being}} different, {{claiming}} {{that it was}} [...] "refreshingly free of both [...] Spelling-style camp and the twee earnestness that has characterized more recent teen dramas". Robert Bianco of USA Today drew comparisons with the successful Fox show Beverly Hills, 90210, saying that [...] "The O.C. is better-written and better-acted by a cast that just might be, incredibly enough, even better-looking". He praised the cast's skill and attractiveness {{as well as the}} show's ability to [...] "come up with a few smart deviations from the genre norm". Nancy Franklin of The New Yorker criticized the plot for being too predictable, but praised Adam Brody as Seth, stating that [...] "he talks too much and too fast, he mumbles, and he projects zero physical confidence. In short, his character is adorable." [...] Rob Owen of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette felt that [...] " [...] McKenzie, at times, is prone to overdramatizing scenes", and considered the young characters [...] "so detestable and yet bland" [...] that it made the show [...] "almost painful" [...] to watch. He nevertheless affirmed that the show had [...] "positive attributes" [...] that made it enjoyable. Andrew Grossman of The Boston Globe commented that [...] "Brody is instantly likable as Seth" [...] and that Barton [...] "does a <b>nice</b> <b>job</b> with Marissa's torn-between-two-worlds angst", but stated that Ryan [...] "doesn't seem to have many clear personality traits". Tim Goodman of the San Francisco Chronicle called the episode [...] "superb" [...] and described McKenzie as [...] "essentially playing James Dean". He compared the actor to Russell Crowe and noted that McKenzie [...] "pull the whole thing off with aplomb".|$|E

He made his first-ever appearance as Penn State's starting point guard on November 19 vs. Fairfield, and contributed 3 points, 4 rebounds, 7 assists, and 1 steal. The team's coach commented on Frazier's powerful defensive performance, [...] "thought Tim Frazier did a very <b>nice</b> <b>job</b> defensively on the point guard for Fairfield who {{is a really good}} player. He bothered him all night." [...] Frazier made his first impression above the 10-points barrier on January 15, 2011 vs. Ohio State, with 11 points, 6 rebounds, and 5 assists.

He played in his first NCAA Tournament game against Temple, contributing 15 points, 7 assists, 5 rebounds, and 2 steals. He made a late miscue guarding Juan Fernández, allowing the opposing guard to close out the game with under one second remaining in regulation. Frazier recalled the moment, [...] "I closed out high end so he wouldn't be able to shoot over me. (He) made a great move, pivoted {{a couple of times and}} then stepped through." [...] Fernández said, [...] "I was thinking about shooting a jump shot but I killed my dribble and (Tim) Frazier was right there. For some reason he jumped over to my right and that gave me the space to go left." [...] By the end of the season, Frazier averaged 6.3 points, 5.1 assists, 3.9 rebounds, 1.0 steals, and 0.1 blocks per game. He was named to the Academic All-Big Ten following 2010–11.|$|E

[...] She praised Fox, Evangeline Lilly, Jorge Garcia, Elizabeth Mitchell and Jeremy Davies's work in [...] "Something Nice Back Home", while Tom Iacuzio of The Daytona Beach News-Journal deemed Jeremy Davies's performance deserving of an Emmy Award. [...] The Palm Beach Posts Kevin Thompson [...] "thought [...] Matthew [...] did a <b>nice</b> <b>job</b> conveying a wide range of emotions—scared, haunted, frustration, horny, jealousy, just to name a few." [...] Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly said that [...] "Something Nice Back Home" [...] "was partly a transitional passage in the Lost saga, a busywork episode designed to put all the characters in position for the year's big finale" [...] and [...] " [...] appendicitis [...] the kind of hardcore castaway survival plotline we haven't really seen since season 1. [...] Combined with a strong character-driven flash story, it was very old school Lost." [...] Jensen also [...] "liked how the episode neatly neutralized one of [...] least favorite season 4 moments, the Jack-Juliet smooch". [...] TV Guides Michael Ausiello wrote that [...] "Fox quietly solidified his status as one of the tube's most reliable and unshowy stalwarts" [...] and deemed him deserving of a Primetime Emmy Award nomination.

Interestingly, as was detected by a devoted kindergarten teacher whose story is told below, this type of precedence constraints {{is very different from}} the traditional one, in a sense that problems that are known to be solvable efficiently become NP-hard and vice-versa. The work of our hero teacher, Ms. Schedule, was initiated due to an arrival of bully jobs to her kindergarten. Bully jobs bypass all other <b>nice</b> <b>jobs,</b> but respect each other. This natural environment corresponds to the case where the selfish precedence-constraints graph is a complete bipartite graph.
