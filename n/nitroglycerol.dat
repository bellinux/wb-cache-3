40|$|On 6 May 2001, a 67 -year-old Australian born, Caucasian male {{presented}} to the Emergency Department of the Austin and Repatriation Medical Centre (A&RMC) with a 3 day history of fever, lethargy and confusion. This occurred one week after returning {{from a trip to}} the Northern Territory. His previous medical problems included ischaemic heart disease, a repaired abdominal aortic aneurysm, hypertension, hyperlipidaemia and congestive cardiac failure. He smoked 20 cigarettes per day and had a history of heavy alcohol consumption. He had no history of diabetes. His medications were aspirin, frusemide, lisinopril, simvastatin, and a <b>nitroglycerol</b> patch. Fifty years ago, he had an adverse reaction to penicillin with angioedema and an urticarial rash. Four weeks before admission he went on a fishing trip in the Northern Territory. He travelled by road, through outback regions of Victoria, New South Wales, Queensland, the Northern Territory and South Australia, spending time in Daly River, Coolum, Darwin, Dunmarra, Avon Downs, Innaminka and Mataranka. He was away for 3 weeks and camped in tents or outside in a swag throughout the trip. He recalls numerous times where he was exposed to mosquitoes with large numbers of bites at Dunmarra. During the time away, he remained well as did his 5 travelling companions. There was [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Objective: to {{evaluate}} the efficiency of high thoracic epidural anesthesia (EA) and analgesia during aortocoronary bypass surgery (ACBS) without extracorporeal circulation (EC). Subjects and methods. The study enrolled 93 patients who had undergone ACBS without EC. The patients were randomized to three groups: 1) 30 controls who had balanced endotracheal anesthesia with propofol and fentanyl and postoperative intravenous analgesia with fentanyl; 2) 30 patients who received epidural infusion with combined endotracheal and epidural (0. 75 % ropivacaine, 10 — 12 ml, and fentanyl, 2 — 3 ^g/kg) anesthesia and postoperative infusion of 0. 2 % ropivacaine and fentanyl, 2 ^g/ml, into the epidural space {{at a rate of}} 3 — 10 ml/hr; 3) 30 patients who had epidural infusion with autoanalgesia in which autoanalgesia with ropivacaine and fentanyl were additionally used during their epidural infusion after ACBS. Results. The less severe degrees of arterial hypertension and myocardial depression were observed in the EA groups during ACBS (p< 0. 05). In these groups, the mean decreases in the intraoperative consumption of propofol, fentanyl, and <b>nitroglycerol</b> were 15 %, 50 %, and 7 -fold, respectively. As compared with the controls, the frequency of the use of colloids and sympathomimetics showed at the same time 2 - and 3 -fold increases, respectively (p< 0. 05). In the postoperative period, arterial oxygenation was higher during epidural infusion with autoanalgesia and the value of lactate was higher in the control group (p< 0. 05). Epidural infusion ensured the maximum reduction in the magnitude of pain syndrome; there was a 46 % drop in the time of postoperative mechanical ventilation in the epidural autoanalgesia group (p< 0. 05). Conclusion. During ACBS without ES, _ epidural anesthesia and analgesia provided hemodynamic stability and optimal postoperative analgesia. After ACBS, epidural infusion with autoanalgesia improves lung function and tissue perfusion and reduces the duration of respiratory support.
