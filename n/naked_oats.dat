Advances in genetic breeding in the UK had led {{to the establishment of}} <b>naked</b> <b>oats</b> as a viable break crop option for growers and advanced varieties of high oil <b>naked</b> <b>oats</b> offer the potential for significantly enhanced performance in monogastrics diets. The AFENO project was established to conduct a three year coordinated programme of research to test the advantages of <b>naked</b> <b>oats</b> to the grower as an economic breakcrop, to the poultry industry as an effective ingredient in broiler and turkey rations, and to the consumer in improved meat quality. The <b>naked</b> <b>oats</b> showed high levels of metabolisable energy when compared to wheat together with a good quality digestible amino acid profile. All other nutritional parameters were established to be satisfactory for poultry. Meat produced on high oat diets was found to have similar taste and texture to conventional diets. A satisfactory predictive energy equation specifically for <b>naked</b> <b>oats</b> was established {{with the use of a}} constant. The research demonstrated the outdated nature of the nutritional information currently available for oats to the animal industry and the positive benefit of the addition of moderate amounts of oat hulls to monogastrics rations. Two commercial collaborators placed a number of experimental short-chain production contracts with growers in order to assess the supply logistics and use of <b>naked</b> <b>oats</b> in commercial operations with the view to a significant increase in the production area if the trials prove to be successful.

Mink In the digestibility trial mean final weights in mink (Figure 1) were equal in all diet groups (1846. 7 - 1908. 3 g), except the group dehulled oats 15 % {{where it was}} lower. In the production trial {{no statistically significant differences}} between treatments were found in weight gain (Figure 3). In the latter part of this experiment (November) mink fed 50 % dehulled oats gained even more than did the mink whose diet contained only barley as a cereal source. The differences in skin length, weight and characteristics were small and not significant (Table 3). Blue fox In the digestibility trial mean final weights of blue foxes were equal in all diets (Figure 1, 7355 - 7687 g). Average daily gain of blue foxes varied between 77. 4 - 81. 5 g. Final average weights varied from 13. 49 to 13. 75 kg (Figure 4). The differences in skin length, weight and characteristics were small (Table 4). Only quard hair quality, in the group 8 % dehulled oats became better than in other groups. Discussion Somewhat poorer weight gain in mink in the groups of 8 and 16 % dehulled oats did ot confirm the results of digestibility trial, where the difference in digestibility was not seen. The preliminary results of the digestibility trial show that both dehulled and <b>naked</b> <b>oats</b> diets were highly digestible. The difference may originate from looser and softer consistencys of dehulled oats diets. Dehulled oats finer particle size (2 mm) resulted in looser and softer consistency and probably led to feed waste from the wire mesh. The problem arose only with mink because the mink cages did not have feeding trays. In contrast, blue fox fed with the same experimental feed gained similarly to other diets. Van Barneveld et. al (1997) also studied digestibility of naked and dehulled oats in growing pigs and found that both dehulled and <b>naked</b> <b>oats</b> have very high amino acid digestibility. These results indicate that both naked and dehulled oats can promote good weight gain both in mink and blue foxes. <b>Naked</b> <b>oats</b> have been included in commercial young pigs diets with positive growth responses. Dehulled and <b>naked</b> <b>oats</b> have even been found very good feed ingredients for dogs. Amino acid content and profile oats is better than in corn Kempe et al. (2004). Our results, both digestibility data, growth and fur properties show that dehulled and <b>naked</b> <b>oats</b> are suitable ingredients in mink and blue fox diets. <b>Naked</b> <b>oats</b> is a new crop and not yet widely cultivated in Finland. Recent studies have shown that some varieties produce yields as high as common oats (Kangas et al., 2001).

40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{research}} work was to assess differences in yield formation of naked and husked oats and to determine the affecting factors. The exact field small-plot experiments with three <b>naked</b> <b>oats</b> varieties (Abel, Izak, and Salomon) and with three husked oats varieties (Auron, Edmund, and Expander) were carried out in two Austrian sites (Lambach and Freistadt) and in two Czech sites (Èeské Budìjovice and Humpolec) during 1999 - 2001. There were determined mainly panicle length (LP), number of whorls (NW), number of branches (NB), number of spikelets (NS), number of grains (NG) and weight of grains per panicle (WG). Mean values of harvest index for husked and <b>naked</b> <b>oats</b> were 45. 8 and 39. 7 %, respectively, with negative relationship with plant height and in a positive relationship with WG. The husked varieties reached higher mean levels of the all yield components. The stands of the husked varieties had higher harvest densities, panicles per m 2, gains per m 2 and minimum variability of the coefficient of productive tillering. The weight of panicles was affected by number of grains, rather than their weight. Yield variability has been influenced in greater extent by number of formed spikelets than by their productivity as reported by Peltonen-Sainio (1994). The yield was affected not only by the higher panicle productivity, but also by the stand density. The inter-year variability of the panicle productivity was influenced mainly by precipitation rate during the period of spikelets differentiation and grain filling. The effect of genotype on the panicle productivity was 15. 5 %. Crude grain yields in our experiments were 5. 83 and 4. 30 t/ha for husked and <b>naked</b> <b>oats,</b> respectively. The tested naked varieties would produce at the observed output the yield of oats rice 4. 20 and 4. 26 t/ha. However, such high output of husked oats has not been reached in farming practice. Stelzner (1990) reported outputs 46 - 55 and 86 - 92. 4 % for husked and <b>naked</b> <b>oats,</b> respectively, under German conditions. In our experiments, the production of dehulled grains was 3. 21 and 3. 83 t/ha at the outputs 55 and 89 % for husked and <b>naked</b> <b>oats,</b> respectively. The oats rice production was observed to be for 31. 3 % higher in the naked varieties as compared to the husked ones.

40|$|This paper reports {{findings}} of field trials {{carried out on}} <b>naked</b> <b>oats</b> {{as part of the}} Avian Feed Efficiency from <b>Naked</b> <b>Oats</b> (AFENO) project. The project was established to conduct a coordinated research programme into the advantages of <b>naked</b> <b>oats</b> to the grower, poultry producer and consumer alike. The field trials aimed to evaluate how growers could use agronomic techniques to co-optimise grain quality and income. In each of three seasons (harvest years 2001 2003), three fully randomised and replicated field experiments were run at ADAS Rosemaund, Preston Wynne, Hereford. These investigated the effects of variety, seed rate, strobilurin fungicides, applied nitrogen; type, timing and rate on grain yield and quality. Additional sites in Scotland and the East of England were used to further test the interactions and validate results at different sites. Seed rate experiments carried out on a number of varieties in two years, established that economic optimum were between 82 and 132 plants m- 2 indicating the possibility to reduce seed rates from current UK commercial practice. However growers {{have to take into account}} expected establishment and a degree of insurance before deciding on a seed rate. Plant densities also had a significant effect on grain quality. Reduced plant densities resulted in an increase in thousand grain weight and protein content but a reduction in oil content. Experiments on the effects of nitrogen timing indicated that in the absence of significant lodging the yield was largely unaffected by nitrogen timing. Earlier nitrogen timings tended to have a small positive effect on oil content whilst later nitrogen timings increased protein. Variety, soil fertility, and plant population affected the potential for improved yield from increasing nitrogen applications. On average every 1 kg/ha of applied nitrogen increased grain yield by 13 kg/ha. The project findings were that the quality of <b>naked</b> <b>oats</b> was relatively stable which is appealing to end users but that agronomic techniques can be used to fine tune grain quality for poultry production.

Main goal of this work was to evaluate influence of genotype and main agroecological conditions on aminoacids contents in <b>naked</b> <b>oats</b> grain. We observed two varieties (Abel, SGK- 7555) on four control sites (Nechanice, Kujavy, Hradec nad Svitavou, Krukanice) from 1995 to 1997. The contents of aminoacids was determined by column chromatography. The contents of aminoacids was analogous to the figures reported by Moudrý & Èermák (1995) and Cuddeford (1990), except from the aminoacids glycine and alanine. Moudrý & Èermák (1995) detected approximately double contents of aminoacids glycine and alanine. On the contrary, lower contents of fenylalanine and histidine were found out. No other substantial differences were found. The rate of aminoacids contents in <b>naked</b> <b>oats</b> is mainly influenced by actual season conditions, locality and finally genotype. Statisticaly insignificant differences in aminoacids contents were detected between varieties in most amonoacids.

Additionally, direct 2 -way choices were also performed between oats and barley diets and between diets presented in mash and pelleted forms. Pigs preferred barley to oats, and preferred diets presented in pelleted form to those presented in mash form.

In particular variants of the experiment we estimated the values of the levels of bacteria and fungi representation in the surface parts of stored grains and analysed the contents of some mycotoxins produced by the fungi of the genus Fusarium. The highest numbers of bacteria and fungi {{on the surface of the}} investigated grains were found in the variant treated by the bioagent (Supresivit S 2) namely 82. 000. 000 spores of bacteria and 110. 000 spores of fungi (Cladosporium, Verticillium, Coelomycetum) per 1 g of grain. Also the fungi of the genus Fusarium were most numerous in the variant oats - bioagent namely 250 spores per 1 g of grain. In all particular variants the amounts of mycotoxins were considerably below the known effective doses for animals and plants. The largest amount of vomitoxin was found in the variant chemical standard (Rovral TS, effective substance Carbendazim 17. 5 % and Iprodion 35 %) - 18 ug.

It was found that oat grain contains, on the basis of Osborne fractionation, another significant protein fraction – glutelins. The question of the protein fraction analysis that was used for the admixture identification stays still open. In sufficient-ly different cultivars, the certainty of the admixture detection in meal samples may be high.

40|$|In Poland {{the first}} naked oat {{cultivar}} Akt was registered in 1997 {{and the second}} variety Polar in 2002. Due to the high interest of farmers, the area of cultivation of naked oat quickly increased. To present ca 90000 ha. The factor restricting the cultivation of naked oat is a low grain yield. In the field trial conducted in 2003 on good rye complex soil, 23 strains of the dwarf naked oat, 2 traditional polish <b>naked</b> <b>oats</b> varieties (Akt, Polar) and the hulled variety Chwat were tested. The yield, yield components and biomass accumulation were {{compared with those of}} hulled oat. Photosynthetic activity was measured and LAI estimated. The traditional naked oat varieties Akt and Polar yielded 80 % of that in hulled Chwat, due to extremely dry conditions during spring and early summer in 2003. The yield of the dwarf strains of naked oat on an average was lower than traditional naked oat varieties. The plant density of the <b>naked</b> <b>oats</b> was lower than standard hulled oats. The higher productive tillering compensated lower plant density, hence the differences in the panicle density were not significant. The lower grain yield of the dwarf strains was caused by the panicle structure, mainly low number of grains per panicle, which was the result of low number of spikelets and the greater amount of fertile spikelets per panicle. Generally, the short stem strains had lower LAI, hence the canopy photosynthesis was lower. We found out the positive correlation between the LAI and the grain yield of dwarf strains. The main factor restricting the grain yield of the dwarf strains was low amount of assimilate partitioning to the grain. The harvest index this forms oscillated on the level ca 25 % and was significantly correlated with the grain yield. At the same term of measurement the dwarf cultivars had lower root biomass than standard cultivars. From that reason in the dry year they could not show their genetic ability for the high yielding.

40|$|A {{dry milling}} {{strategy}} has been developed for separating oats into bran-rich and starch-rich fractions. For the first time, this process combined the benefits of oat pearling with the efficiency of break and reduction milling and sifting to allow production of flour and bran fractions from an oat cultivar of high lipid content. The bran-rich fraction complies with the separation ratio and chemical composition of the AACC’s definition for oat bran. Oat cultivars with a lipid content below 10 % (db) can be dry milled by the process developed in this study. The roll disposition, roll gap and the speed differential of the corrugated and smooth rolls together with the aperture size of the sieves for flour separation were the important parameters that determined the milling and separation efficiency of this oat dry milling process. Critical settings of these parameters included a roll disposition of dull to dull, a roll gap of not larger than 0. 1 mm, and a sieve aperture size of 212 μm for flour separation. A pearling step as short as 5 s prior to roller milling effectively removed all the trichomes {{from the surface of}} two cultivars of <b>naked</b> <b>oats.</b> This would significantly reduce the health hazards arising from trichomes during oat dry processing...|$|E
40|$|The {{dominant}} gene N- 1 in cultivated oats {{gives rise to}} a phenotype characterized by a thin papery lemma from which the grain readily threshes free, a multiflorous habit, and rachillas that are elongated in comparison to those of husked oats. This study was undertaken in order to identify the stages at which morphological and biochemical development of naked and husked oats begin to diverge, and to look for correlated differences in gene products (mRNAs and proteins). Spikelet morphology in naked and husked oats was shown to diverge early in panicle development: the first visible difference was premature cessation of growth of the third and subsequent florets in husked oats. Lignin deposition in the lemma occurred later and followed a similar time-course in both genotypes, though in <b>naked</b> <b>oats</b> it was restricted to the vascular bundles. Mature lemmas of the naked genotype closely resembled glumes in appearance and in lignification pattern. Genotypic differences in extractable polypeptide complements were apparent only late in development, coinciding with the onset of lignification, and were not associated with comparable differences in translatable mRNA profiles. The normal (n- 1) allele at the naked locus is likely to encode a transcription factor with properties similar to those of previously-characterized homeotic gene products in plants.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{influence}} of enzyme supplementation on the bioavailable energy (AMEn) and apparent digestibilities of lipid (ALD) and protein (APD) in young broiler chicks was examined for diets containing either wheat, hulled or hulless barley, <b>naked</b> <b>oats,</b> or spring rye. Dietary AMEn, APD, and ALD values were depressed (P <. 01) for all test grains (except hulled Bedford barley) as the inclusion {{rate of the}} grain replacing wheat increased. The antinutritives, (3 -glucans (barley and oats) and pentosans (rye), had the most pronounced effect on ALD. The decreases in ALD were 43, 77, and 67 % for chicks fed diets containing 70 % Scout barley (hulless), Terra oats, and Gazelle rye, respectively, compared with those fed the control wheat diet. Enzyme supplementation increased (P <. 01) AMEn, APD, and ALD for all test cereals. The corresponding increases in the AMEn, of the enzyme-supplemented diets containing 70 % HY 320 wheat, Bedford barley, Scout barley, Terra oats, and Gazelle rye diets were 4, 7, 42, 33, and 14 %, respectively, compared with their unsupplemented counterparts. Enzyme treatment also improved (P <. 01) weight gains and feed conversion efficiencies of chicks fed diets containing each of the cereals. Overall, the results demonstrate that the nutritive value of cereal grains such as wheat, barley, oats, and rye can be improved {{by the addition of}} crude fungal extracts to the diet of young chicks. {Key words: enzyme supplementation, protein digestibility, lipid digestibility, bioavailable energy, cereal grains...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of a 3 -year field experiment designed to evaluate the content of organic carbon in brown soil (Haplic Cambisol Dystric) developed from a light loamy sand under legumes cultivation. Experimental factors were: species of legume crop (colorful-blooming pea (Pisum sativum), chickling vetch (Lathyrus sativus), narrow-leafed lupin (Lupinus angustifolius), methods of legumes tillage (legumes in pure culture and in mixture with <b>naked</b> <b>oats)</b> and mineral N fertilization (0, 30, 60, 90 kg N·ha− 1). Cultivation of legumes on sandy soil did not result in an increase of organic carbon content in the soil after harvest as compared to the initial situation, i. e. 7. 39 vs. 7. 76 g·kg− 1 dry matter (DM), on average, respectively. However, there was the beneficial effect of this group of plants on soil abundance in organic matter, the manifestation of which was higher content of organic carbon in soils after legume harvest as compared to soils with oats grown (7. 21 g·kg− 1 DM, on average). Among experimental crops, cultivation of pea exerted the most positive action to organic carbon content (7. 58 g·kg− 1, after harvest, on average), whereas narrow-leaved lupin had the least effect on organic carbon content (7. 23 g·kg− 1, on average).

40|$|Oats {{nutritional}} characteristics {{for human}} consumption have been well described in many papers. Besides a high content of proteins and lipids, the presence of soluble fiber (β-glucans) and unique antioxidant molecules (avenanthramides) confer to oat kernel a high nutritional value, which could be exploited {{for the production of}} healthy foods. Thirty oat cultivars (both naked or husked) have been multiplied in 2014 and characterized for the content of β-glucan, soluble phenols (SPs), total avenanthramides (AVNs; 2 c+ 2 p+ 2 f) and total antioxidant capacity (TAC). SPs and TAC showed no significant differences between naked and husked samples. Average values of the 30 samples were the following: 1. 12 ± 0. 16 gGAE/Kg for SPs; 16. 39 ± 1. 77 mmolTE/Kg for ABTS and 6. 74 ± 1. 47 mmolTE/Kg for DPPH assay. A significant linear correlation was observed between SPs vs ABTS assay (R 2 = 0. 53) and SPs vs DPPH assay (R 2 = 0. 34) (p< 0. 05). Total AVNs of <b>naked</b> <b>oats</b> were significantly higher than husked samples, with average values of 248. 56 ± 194. 01 and 84. 87 ± 88. 66 mg/Kg, respectively (p< 0. 05).

40|$|Interest in the {{cultivation}} and using of <b>naked</b> <b>oats</b> has increased significantly {{in recent years}} in the most of countries. This is due to dietary and curative properties of the grain and its derived products such as syrups.

The article reviews an issue concerning the impact of wort concentration temperature on the physico-chemical indicators of syrup, as well as, considers an experimental data on the content of dietary fiber and vitamins in syrups, and illustrates carbohydrate content of end-products. It is found that with increasing of wort concentration temperature from 40 ° C to 70 ° C the time of the process reduces 3. 7 times, and further it leads to lessening of the reducing substances from 53. 9 % to 45. 7 % and increases the colour of syrup from 61. 7 EBC units to 68. 5 EBC units. For obtaining of optimal physicochemical parameters of syrup and ensuring a minimum time of concentration recommended temperature of the process is 60 ° C. It is shown that the syrup produced from commercial malt contains 2. 2 times more pentosans compared to the syrup produced from Vyatsky oat. In turn, syrup from Vyatsky oat contains 2. 5 times more β-glucan - the most important physico-chemical component in a viewpoint of nutrition. The carbohydrate composition of syrups permits to recommend them for using in functional products as well as high content of dietary fiber and vitamins gives a perspective of their application in the food industry...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} variety, agronomic and {{environmental}} factors on the chemical composition and energy value for ruminants and non-ruminants of husked and <b>naked</b> <b>oats</b> grain was studied. Winter oats were grown as experimental plots in each of 2 years on three sites in England. At each site two conventional husked oat cultivars (Gerald and Image) and two naked cultivars (Kynon and Pendragon) were grown. At each site, crops were sown on two dates and all crops were grown with the application of either zero or optimum fertiliser nitrogen. Variety and factors contained within the site + year effect had the greatest influence on the chemical composition and nutritive value of oats, followed by nitrogen ferfiliser treatment. For example, compared with zero nitrogen, the optimum nitrogen fertiliser treatment resulted in a consistent and significant (P < 0. 001) increase in crude protein for all varieties at all sites {{from an average of}} 95 to 118 g kg(- 1) DM, increased the potassium concentration in all varieties from an average of 4. 9 to 5. 1 g kg(- 1) DM (P < 0. 01) and reduced total lipid by a small but significant (P < 0. 001) amount. Optimum nitrogen increased (P < 0. 001) the NDF concentration in the two husked varieties and in the naked variety Pendragon. Naked cultivars were lower in fibre, had considerably higher energy, total lipid, linoleic acid, protein, starch and essential amino acids than the husked cultivars. Thus nutritionists need to be selective in their choice of naked or husked oat depending on the intended dietary use. (C) 2004 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{sustainability}} of ecosystem productivity and rules governing ecosystem development are important topics of scientific research. The emergy approach {{is an effective}} method for investigating these topics, especially when used to evaluate systems that have developed under the same environmental conditions, such as climate and soil. In this paper, emergy differences between terrestrial ecosystems were studied in Guyuan County, a region representative of the agro-pastoral ecotone in Hebei Province, China. A combination of field tests and a questionnaire survey were carried out between June and August 2015. The ecosystems studied included natural grassland, artificial grassland, field crops and commercial crops. These four ecosystems were further subdivided into a total of ten ecosystems. Natural grassland was divided into free-grazing and mowed ecosystems; artificial grassland consisted of oat, Chinese leymus and corn silage; field crops included <b>naked</b> <b>oats,</b> flax and wheat; and commercial crops consisted of cabbage and potatoes. The {{results showed that the}} rain input of 4. 78 × 1014 seJ/ha/yr constituted the highest renewable natural resource emergy and that the purchased emergy inputs of the ten ecosystems ranged from 3. 53 to 147. 67 × 1014 seJ/ha/yr. Natural resource emergy input was the basic power to maintain the ecosystem, and purchased emergy input was the direct cause of the development of the ecosystems. Groundwater was the most important non-renewable purchased energy for the production of economic crops. The emergy investment ratios (EIR) for potatoes (27. 81) and cabbage (19. 03) were higher than those of the other ecosystems, but mowed and artificial Chinese leymus grassland had the higher emergy self-sufficiency rates (ESR). Natural grassland, artificial Chinese leymus grassland and traditional grain crops had a low environmental load and high sustainability, whereas potatoes and cabbage had a high environmental load and low sustainability. Overall, rain-fed artificial grassland has a high development potential from the perspective of environment and productivity...|$|E
