5|$|The {{number two}} of Wilson Fisk, {{but he does}} <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> be {{involved}} in the activities of the Kingpin. Orser previously co-starred with Jon Favreau in 1998 in Very Bad Things.|$|E
5|$|Tristano {{declined}} {{offers to}} perform in the 1970s; {{he explained that he}} did <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> travel, and that the requirement for a career-minded musician to play concerts was not something that he wanted to follow. He continued teaching, and helped to organize concerts for some of his students. Another album, Descent into the Maelstrom, was released in the 1970s; it consisted of recordings made between 1951 and 1966.|$|E

5|$|When word reached New Hampshire of the result, Pierce {{found it}} {{difficult}} to believe, and his wife fainted. Their son Benjamin wrote to his mother hoping that Franklin's candidacy would not be successful, as he knew she would <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> live in Washington.|$|E
5|$|However, Australian bowlers such as O'Reilly and Grimmett troubled him by bowling at his leg stump, restricting his scoring as he {{had fewer}} {{effective}} leg-side shots. Occasionally, he displayed discomfort against the fastest bowlers. His team-mate Charlie Barnett {{said that he did}} not relish fast bowling, although he was capable of playing it well in the initial stages of his career. Other colleagues, such as Les Ames, Bob Wyatt and Reg Sinfield, believed that he did <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> face the new ball, and he was occasionally happy for the other batsmen to face the difficult bowling.|$|E
5|$|Shiraasan, {{also known}} as Shi-chan, is a female homunculus, or {{artificial}} human, created by a joint effort of Hibiki and Shirotsuki. Despite looking like a very young girl, Shiraasan has the maturity of an adult who finds nothing wrong with reading newspapers or smoking cigarettes. Since homunculi were originally created as weapons in Hibiki's Magic, Shiraasan can procure guns and other weapons to use as she pleases, such as taking care of stray flies. Shiraasan has a very independent personality and does <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> be told what she can and cannot do. After {{it is confirmed that}} she is a stable lifeform, Shiraasan warms up to Hibiki and loves her very much.|$|E

5|$|The {{far left}} wing, under Anton Sztáray, Michael von Fröhlich and Louis Joseph, Prince of Condé, guarded the Rhine border from Mannheim to Switzerland. This {{part of the}} army {{included}} the conscripts drafted from the imperial circles. Charles did <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> use the militias in any vital location and once it seemed clear {{to him that the}} French intended to cross at the middle Rhine, the Archduke felt no qualms placing his militia men at Kehl. In Spring 1796, when resumption of war appeared eminent, the 88-members of the Swabian Circle, which included most of the states (ecclesiastical, secular, and dynastic) in Upper Swabia, had raised a small force of about 7,000 men. These were field hands, the occasional journeyman, and day laborers drafted for service, but untrained in military matters. The remainder of the force included experienced troops from the Habsburg frontier troops stationed just north of Rastatt and a cadre of French royalists and a couple hundred mercenaries at Freiburg im Breisgau.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though the}} effects of raising {{children}} and having a career simultaneously are mostly seen in women throughout many societies, the men in such situations are affected greatly as well. This is not seen in all situations in males because the effects on men differ greatly from how females are affected by this extra responsibility. In The Canadian Family in Crisis, the author suggests a reason for these effects to go unnoticed in most studies and surveys. This is because women's stress can be seen through direct labor consisting of housework and career whereas men's stress, in most cases, mostly come from decision making and work-family conflicts. These situations arise where the male must make {{the best choice for}} the future of his family. Specifically, these include things such as workload, overtime hours, shift decisions, and even accepting a promotion or a transfer. In these situations, the man is forced to make major choices that will affect the entire family, which brings on more stress. The effects also go unnoticed since, in traditional gender roles, the male {{is supposed to be the}} backbone of the family and, in the past, it would have been seen as weakness for the male to display his emotions to the rest of the family. In surveys and studies done, most males would <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> be seen as too weak to handle his responsibilities as the role of the adult male in the household, which in the past has consisted of being the major economical supporter and physical figure for the family. With this in mind, it is very possible that some may have lied when surveyed about these topics.|$|E

25|$|Nine Inch Nails toured {{extensively}} {{over the}} next few years, including a performance at Woodstock '94, although he admitted to the audience that he did <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> play large venues. Around this time, Reznor's studio perfectionism, struggles with addiction, and bouts of writer's block prolonged the production of a follow-up to The Downward Spiral.|$|E
6000|$|... "You'd <b>like</b> <b>to</b> go to Jane's, of course," [...] {{the driver}} said {{to me with a}} {{friendly}} nod as he reached the High Street: and <b>not</b> <b>liking</b> <b>to</b> confess my forgetfulness of Jane, I responded with warmth that Jane's would, no doubt, exactly suit me.|$|R

25|$|Lopez does <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> {{repeat the}} models so she never {{uses the same}} design without {{changing}} it {{at least a little}} bit in two collection in a row.

25|$|Eventually, {{after about}} two months, Li Si and the {{imperial}} court reached Xianyang, where {{the news of}} the death of the emperor was announced. Qin Shi Huang did <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> talk about his own death and he had never written a will. After his death, the eldest son Fusu would normally become the next emperor.|$|E
25|$|Tiny and Lou are two Asian elephants. Of all {{the animals}} Tiny and Lou are the most immature. Tiny is blue and has a high-pitched voice as Lou is yellow and has a {{low-pitched}} voice.

60|$|She assented, <b>not</b> <b>liking</b> <b>to</b> {{confess that}} she did not know what Chardonnet might be, and hoping {{it was some kind of}} sherbet. She had never yet drunk wine, and after a glass felt {{suddenly}} extremely strong.|$|R

25|$|We {{were alone}} {{together}} among the strange poisons, {{each one of}} whom, with a quicker or a slower death-devil in his eye, sat in his glass or porcelain sentry-box, a living force of bale. Should it be Hemp? No, that was too slow, uncertain, painful. Morphine? Too many antidotes — too much commonness, ostentation in that. Daturin? I did <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> ask {{how much of that}} was certain...|$|E
25|$|There {{were four}} known {{assassination}} attempts on Nehru. The first attempt {{on his life}} was during partition in 1947 while he was visiting North-West Frontier Province (now in Pakistan) in a car. The second one was by a knife-wielding rickshaw-puller in Maharashtra in 1955. The third one happened in Bombay (now Maharashtra) in 1956. The fourth one was a failed bombing attempt on train tracks in Maharashtra in 1961. Despite threats to his life, Nehru despised having too much security around him and did <b>not</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> disrupt traffic due to his movement.|$|E
