In isolated rabbit jejunum, Nc.

In isolated guinea-pig trachea, Nc. Oil and papaverine inhibited carbachol (1 mu M) and K(+) precontractions with similar potency, while verapamil was more potent against K(+). Nc.

In the present research, alginate gel beads formulations were optimised as semiochemical slow-release devices. The formulations were evaluated in terms of volatiles release capacity, protection efficiency of sesquiterpenes against oxidation, and biological activity towards Epysirphus balteatus and Aphidius ervi. Moreover, the sesquiterpenes used in the formulations were obtained from natural matrices. Indeed, they were purified by flash chromatography fractionation of essential oils of Matricaria chamomilla L. and <b>Nepeta</b> <b>cataria</b> <b>L.,</b> for obtaining E-β-farnesene and β-caryophyllene, respectively.

The effect of DO 63 (1, 2, 4, 5 -tetraoxane) and DOVF 15 (2, 5 -diphenyl-tiophene) on the production of cis,trans-nepetalactone (NL) and rosmarinic acid (RA) in two Nepeta species, was investigated in shoots grown on culture medium with addition of synthetic compounds in concentrations ranging from 0. 1 to 2 mg L- 1. The content of targeted metabolites in tested in vitro shoots depended on the type and the concentration of applied synthetic compounds. Application of DO 63, primarily in concentration of 0. 1 mg L- 1 to 1 mg L- 1, affected only NL production in both Nepeta species resulting in increased NL content in treated shoots, while production of RA was not influenced.

Mosquito responses to catnip (<b>Nepeta</b> <b>cataria</b> <b>L.)</b> essential oil are characterized with high spatial activity, but lack significant contact repellency. Sampling within the staticair bioassay chamber with solid-phase microextraction provided measurements of the relative concentration and distribution of volatiles.

Essential oil mixtures containing both spatial (catnip) and contact (Amyris) repellents were made and showed high levels of residual control via both modes of action. Siam-wood essential oil scored high in both spatial and contact efficacy against mosquitoes. Observations during this study included signs of toxicity.

These comparative studies found both the catnip steam distillate and elemol to be as good, {{and in some cases}} better, at repelling house flies, Musca domestica L., and American cockroaches, Periplaneta americana L., than N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide (DEET) or citronellal. Both short-term and long-term repellency bioassays were used to assess repellency. Catnip essential oil showed greater repellency than DEET and citronellal in the short term. Extended repellency bioassays showed elemol to be more repellent than catnip steam distillate, citronellal, and DEET. Nepetalactone, the major constituent of catnip essential oil, is present as two isomers, and previous studies have shown the E,Z-nepetalactone [2 -(2 -hydroxy- 1 -methylethenyl) - 5 -methyl-cyclopentanecarboxylic acid delta lactone] isomer to be even more repellent to cockroaches than the dominant isomer, Z,E-nepetalactone. This study examined the seasonal variation of the two isomers, Z,E- and E,Z-nepetalactone, in catnip. Samples of fresh catnip mature leaves, immature leaves, and stems were steam-distilled separately, and isomer composition was analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography and gas chromatography (GC). An analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed significant differences by week. The mature leaf essential oil samples were tested in a repellency bioassay and exhibited significant repellency to German cockroaches, Blattella germanica L.

Traditional stable fly management employing sanitation and insecticides is costly and often fails to provide acceptable levels of control. A novel method for managing stable flies {{involves the use}} of attractants and repellents. This approach could be used to enhance the current level of stable fly control and ultimately be incorporated into a sustainable stable fly management program. Gravid females’ stable flies use chemical cues from host animals and the environment to locate suitable hosts, mates, and oviposition sites. Understanding stable fly olfaction and the electrophysiological responses to host seeking and ovipositional stimuli is essential for exploring stable flies’ behaviors stimulated by odor cues. This study characterized the number, location and types of stable fly sensilla on antennae. Accompanying electroantennogram studies assessed antennal responses to host-associated volatile compounds. The attractiveness / repellency of selected naturally occurring compounds to stable fly feeding and oviposition were investigated under laboratory and field conditions. Four majors’ types of sensilla were documented: basiconic, clavate, coeloconic, and trichoid with three subtypes. Results of electroantennogram studies revealed significant antennal responses to host-associated compound; for example, 1 -octen 3 -ol, phenol, p-cresol, indole, and dimethytrisulfide. Catnip (<b>Nepeta</b> <b>cataria</b> <b>L.)</b> oil and its constituent nepetalactones compounds provided significant repellency of stable flies.
