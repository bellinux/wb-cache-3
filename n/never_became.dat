5|$|Aylesbury ducks were {{imported}} into the United States in 1840, although they <b>never</b> <b>became</b> a popular breed. They were, however, {{added to the}} American Poultry Association's Standard of Perfection breeding guidelines in 1876. As of 2013, the breed was listed as critically endangered in the United States by The Livestock Conservancy.|$|E
5|$|Baltische Öl {{consisted}} of five units (Kiviõli, Küttejõu, Kohtla-Järve, Sillamäe, and Kohtla), {{all of which}} were partially restored, previously existing industries. In addition, Baltische Öl started construction of a new mining and shale oil extraction complex in Ahtme, but it <b>never</b> <b>became</b> operational. Prisoners of war and forced labour made up about two-thirds of the work force in these units.|$|E

5|$|From {{at least}} the 16th century, boats from {{mainland}} Scotland and the Netherlands dominated the local herring fishery. There is little evidence of an Orcadian fleet until the 19th century but it grew rapidly and 700 boats were involved by the 1840s with Stronsay and later Stromness becoming leading centres of development. White fish <b>never</b> <b>became</b> as dominant as in other Scottish ports.|$|E
5|$|In 1874 the Ampezzo forest {{became the}} {{property}} of the Carnic Woods Consortium. Although remaining Austrian possession until 1920 (as a part of kronland Tyrol), aside from being home for an ethnic German-speaking minority, Ampezzo <b>never</b> <b>became</b> a German-speaking territory and conserved its original language, Ladin, a Rhaeto-Romance language.|$|E

5|$|Though the act won easy {{passage through}} the Social Credit-dominated legislature, Lieutenant-Governor of Alberta John C. Bowen {{reserved}} royal assent until the Supreme Court of Canada evaluated the act's legality.

5|$|Despite {{these and}} {{numerous}} other influences, however, Shelly Manne's style of drumming was always his ownpersonal, precise, clear, {{and at the same}} time multilayered, using a very broad range of colors. Manne was often experimental, and had participated in such musically exploratory groups of the early 1950s as those of Jimmy Giuffre and Teddy Charles. Yet his playing <b>never</b> <b>became</b> overly cerebral, and he never neglected that element usually considered fundamental to all jazz: time.|$|E

5|$|In 1962, two-time former {{governor}} and Democratic factional leader Happy Chandler {{had already begun}} his campaign for a third term as governor. The anti-Chandler faction became concerned that, {{if they did not}} name a candidate, Chandler's early announcement would give him an advantage in the 1963 election. Leaders of the faction were solidly behind state Highway Commissioner Henry Ward, but Governor Combs was leaning toward Breathitt. Breathitt announced his candidacy on May 2, 1962, but many in his party remained skeptical due to his youth and relative inexperience. Combs eventually convinced the anti-Chandler faction to back Breathitt, and Ward <b>never</b> <b>became</b> a candidate.|$|E

While in college, he became a brother of co-ed service fraternity Alpha Phi Omega and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa. Clinton was {{also a member of the}} Order of DeMolay, a youth group affiliated with Freemasonry, but he <b>never</b> <b>became</b> a Freemason.

5|$|Many envisioned {{starting}} a silk {{industry in the}} British colonies in America, starting in 1619, under the reign of King James I of England. The silk industry in the colonies <b>never</b> <b>became</b> very large. Likewise, silk was introduced to numerous other countries, including Mexico, where it was brought by Cortez in 1522. Only rarely did these new silk industries grow to any significant size.|$|E

5|$|NeXT later {{released}} {{much of the}} NeXTSTEP {{system as}} a programming environment standard called OpenStep. NeXT withdrew from the hardware business in 1993 to concentrate on marketing OPENSTEP for Mach, its own OpenStep implementation, for several OEMs. NeXT also developed WebObjects, {{one of the first}} enterprise Web application frameworks. WebObjects <b>never</b> <b>became</b> very popular because of its initial high price of $50,000, but it remains a prominent early example of a Web server based on dynamic page generation rather than on static content.|$|E
5|$|One {{possible}} {{interpretation of}} these provisions is that unlawful non-citizens {{should be kept}} in detention for as long as necessary to remove them, and that if removing them <b>never</b> <b>became</b> practicable, that they would be detained until death. In contrast, Al-Kateb argued that the provisions only allowed unlawful non-citizens to be detained while removal was a practical possibility, and that if removal was not a practical possibility, then they should be released from detention, at least while it remained impractical.|$|E

5|$|The Bulls {{qualified}} for the playoffs just twice between 1976 and 1984, {{a period in which}} the team used eight different head coaches, including former player Jerry Sloan. They had a chance to win the first pick of the 1979 NBA Draft, which would have allowed them to select future Hall of Famer Magic Johnson. However, they lost a coin flip to the Los Angeles Lakers, and went on to choose David Greenwood with the second pick. Although Greenwood averaged 12.6 points over six seasons with the Bulls, he <b>never</b> <b>became</b> an NBA All-Star.|$|E
5|$|The Chinese used chariots for horse-based warfare {{until light}} cavalry forces became common during the Warring States era (402221 BC). A major {{proponent of the}} change to riding horses from chariots was Wu Ling, c.320 BC. However, {{conservative}} forces in China often opposed change, and cavalry <b>never</b> <b>became</b> as dominant as in Europe. Cavalry in China also did not benefit from the additional cachet attached to being the military branch dominated by the nobility.|$|E
5|$|The next year, Dow met {{his future}} wife, Maria Cornelia Maynard, the {{daughter}} of a Massachusetts merchant. They married on January 20, 1830. Over the next twenty years, they had nine children, five of whom (two sons and three daughters) survived infancy. Maria Cornelia was a Congregationalist, and Dow attended services with her at Second Parish Church regularly, although he <b>never</b> <b>became</b> a member. Their home, built at 714 Congress Street in Portland in 1829, still stands and is now a museum memorializing Dow's life and administered by the local chapter of the Women's Christian Temperance Union.|$|E
