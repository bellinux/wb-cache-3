50|$|TSEs, or prion diseases, are {{infectious}} neurodegenerative {{diseases of}} mammals that include bovine spongiform encephalopathy, {{chronic wasting disease}} of deer and elk, scrapie in sheep, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) in humans.

They have incubation periods of months to years, but after the appearance of clinical signs, they progress rapidly, are untreatable and invariably are fatal.

40|$|Multiple {{sclerosis}} {{is thought}} to be an autoimmune-mediated disease of the central nervous system. For many years, T-cells were regarded as the key players in the pathogenesis, and myelin of white matter was considered as the main victim.

Fifty six (20. 4 %) subjects had evidence of prenatal ischaemic brain damage.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Epidemiological {{studies show}} that up to 10 % of {{individuals}} aged 65 years and older suffer from dementia, most commonly from dementia of the Alzheimer Type (DAT) (1). Clinicopathological studies are critical {{to our understanding of}} this disease and improving the accuracy of clinical diagnoses. OBJECTIVES: Our objectives were to examine the validity of clinical diagnoses of DAT, to determine the prevalence of different forms of dementia in this sample, and to investigate the relationship between age at death and polymorbidity. SUBJECTS AND METHOD: Clinical data were available from 221 patients who had been examined at the Basel Memory Clinic between 1986 and 1996. From this population, 34 % (75 patients) were autopsied in the Department of Pathology, University Hospital Basel, and <b>neuropathological</b> <b>examinations</b> were additionally performed on 62 (83 %) of these patients. Clinical and neuropathological data were retrospectively compared. RESULTS: 67. 8 % of the neuropathologically examined patients received a definitive diagnosis of AD (Alzheimer's disease), vascular dementia (VaD) or mixed dementia (AD and VaD). AD alone or with other histopathological hallmarks of dementia was the most prevalent neuropathological diagnosis (63 %). VaD was deemed the only cause of dementia in only 4. 8 % of patients. The sensitivity for DAT was 75. 9 %, the specificity 60. 6 %. Increasing age was associated with an increasing number of clinical and neuropathological diagnoses. CONCLUSION: The sensitivity and specificity of the clinical diagnoses of DAT found in our study are similar to previous reports (2 - 5). Older patients had more etiologies of their dementia than younger patients.

40|$|BACKGROUND Leukoencephalomyelopathy is an {{inherited}} neurodegenerative disorder {{that affects the}} white matter of the spinal cord and brain and is known {{to occur in the}} Rottweiler breed. Due to the lack of a genetic test for this disorder, post mortem <b>neuropathological</b> <b>examinations</b> are required to confirm the diagnosis. Leukoencephalopathy with brain stem and spinal cord involvement and elevated lactate levels is a rare, autosomal recessive disorder in humans that was recently described to have clinical features and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings that are similar to the histopathologic lesions that define leukoencephalomyelopathy in Rottweilers. Leukoencephalopathy with brain stem and spinal cord involvement is caused by mutations in the DARS 2 gene, which encodes a mitochondrial aspartyl-tRNA synthetase. The objective of this case report is to present the results of MRI and candidate gene analysis of a case of Rottweiler leukoencephalomyelopathy to investigate the hypothesis that leukoencephalomyelopathy in Rottweilers could serve as an animal model of human leukoencephalopathy with brain stem and spinal cord involvement. CASE PRESENTATION A two-and-a-half-year-old male purebred Rottweiler was evaluated for generalised progressive ataxia with hypermetria that was most evident in the thoracic limbs. MRI (T 2 -weighted) demonstrated well-circumscribed hyperintense signals within both lateral funiculi that extended from the level of the first to the sixth cervical vertebral body. A neurodegenerative disorder was suspected based on the progressive clinical course and MRI findings, and Rottweiler leukoencephalomyelopathy was subsequently confirmed via histopathology. The DARS 2 gene was investigated as a causative candidate, but a sequence analysis failed to identify any disease-associated variants in the DNA sequence. CONCLUSION It was concluded that MRI may aid in the pre-mortem diagnosis of suspected cases of leukoencephalomyelopathy. Genes other than DARS 2 may be involved in Rottweiler leukoencephalomyelopathy and may also be relevant in human leukoencephalopathy with brain stem and spinal cord involvement...|$|R
40|$|Human T {{lymphocyte}} virus type I (HTLV-I) can {{be transmitted}} into several inbred strains of newborn and adult rats by inoculating newly established HTLV-I-immortalized rat T cell lines or the human T cell line MT- 2. The transmission efficiency exceeds 80 %, regardless of strain differences or the age at transmission. The production of anti- HTLV-I antibodies significantly differs among the strains and depends on the age {{at the time of}} transmission. Rats neonatally inoculated with HTLV-I-positive rat or human cells generally become seronegative HTLV-I carriers throughout their lives, whereas adult rats inoculated with HTLV-I-positive cells at 16 wk of age become seropositive HTLV-I carriers. The HTLV-I provirus genome is present in almost all organs, regardless of whether the carriers are seronegative or seropositive. According to antibody titers to HTLV-I, there are three groups of inbred rat strains: ACI, F 344, and SDJ (high responders); WKA, BUF, and LEJ (intermediate responders); and LEW (low responder). Three of three 16 -mo-old seronegative HTLV-I carrier rats of the WKA strain developed spastic paraparesis of the hind legs. <b>Neuropathological</b> <b>examinations</b> revealed that the lesions were confined primarily to the lateral and anterior funiculi of the spinal cord. Both myelin and axons were extensively damaged in a symmetrical fashion, and infiltration with massive foamy macrophages was evident. The most severe lesions were at levels of the thoracic cord and continued from the cervical to the lumbar area. These histopathological features as well as clinical symptoms largely parallel findings in humans with HTLV-I-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP).
