Thus, <b>Nef</b> <b>protein</b> has been proposed as a suitable candidate for vaccine design. In current study, our goal was the cloning and expression of <b>Nef</b> <b>protein</b> in prokaryotic expression system and its purification using the reverse staining method. Materials and Methods: The coding sequence of <b>Nef</b> <b>protein</b> was amplified from pUC 19 -nef vector by PCR. Then, nef gene was inserted into the pGEX 6 p 2 expression vector. This construct was transformed into the E. coli BL 21 E. coli strain and subsequently protein expression was induced by IPTG anti-repressor. The protein expression was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot using anti-Nef antibody. Protein purification was performed by reverse staining method. Results: The PCR and digestion analysis showed a clear band of 648 bp in agarose gel indicating the correct cloning of HIV-nef in pGEX 6 p 2 expression vector.

40|$|International audienceThe human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) <b>Nef</b> <b>protein</b> is myristoylated and plays {{a critical role in}} AIDS pathogenesis by enhancing viral replication, survival of the virus within infected cells and by facilitating its spread in vivo. We observed that, in the promonocytic cell line U 937, myristoylated exogenous <b>Nef</b> <b>protein</b> activates NF-kappaB and AP- 1, whereas unmyristoylated exogenous <b>Nef</b> <b>protein</b> does not. Using methyl-beta-cyclodextrin (MbetaC) treatment, we observed that the activation of NF-kappaB and AP- 1 by exogenous <b>Nef</b> <b>protein</b> is mediated primarily via lipid rafts both in U 937 cells and in primary human macrophages. In agreement with this observation, exogenous <b>Nef</b> <b>protein</b> colocalized with GM 1 ganglioside, a major component of lipid rafts, in U 937 cells as detected by confocal microscopy. Since tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) activates NF-kappaB and AP- 1, we investigated the role of exogenous <b>Nef</b> <b>protein</b> in TNFalpha-stimulated U 937 cells and primary macrophages. We observed that exogenous Nef and TNFalpha synergistically activate NF-kappaB and AP- 1 in U 937 cells and primary macrophages resulting in enhanced stimulation of the HIV- 1 long terminal repeat (LTR), and subsequently in enhanced viral replication in both chronically infected promonocytic U 1 cells and acutely HIV- 1 -infected primary macrophages. Both enhanced LTR stimulation and viral replication following treatment with exogenous Nef and TNFalpha were mediated via lipid rafts. Therefore, our results indicate that exogenous <b>Nef</b> <b>protein</b> and enhanced TNFalpha production detected in HIV-infected subjects could synergize to fuel the progression of the disease via lipid raft-dependent stimulation of the HIV- 1 provirus present in such cellular reservoirs as mononuclear phagocytes...|$|E
40|$|Nef, an {{important}} pathogenicity factor of {{human immunodeficiency virus}} (HIV) and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), elevates virus replication in vivo. Among other activities, Nef affects T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling via several mechanisms. For HIV- 1 Nef these include alteration of the organization and function of the immunological synapse (IS) such as relocalization of the Lck kinase, as well as early inhibition of TCR/CD 3 complex (TCR-CD 3) -mediated actin rearrangements and tyrosine phosphorylation. Although most SIV and HIV- 2 Nef alleles (group 2) potently downregulate cell surface TCR-CD 3, this activity {{was lost in the}} viral lineage that gave rise to HIV- 1 and its SIV counterparts (group 1). To address the contribution of TCR-CD 3 downregulation to Nef effects on TCR signal initiation, we compared the activities of 18 group 1 and group 2 <b>Nef</b> <b>proteins,</b> as well as SIV Nef mutants with defects in TCR-CD 3 downmodulation. We found that alteration of Lck's subcellular localization is largely conserved and occurs independently of actin remodeling inhibition or TCR-CD 3 downregulation. Surprisingly, <b>Nef</b> <b>proteins</b> of both groups also strongly reduced TCR-induced actin remodeling and tyrosine phosphorylation on TCR-stimulatory surfaces and TCR-CD 3 downmodulation competence by group 2 <b>Nef</b> <b>proteins</b> only slightly elevated these effects.

40|$|Nef is an {{accessory}} protein and pathogenicity factor of {{human immunodeficiency virus}} (HIV) and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) which elevates virus replication in vivo. We recently described for HIV type 1 SF 2 (HIV- 1 SF 2) the potent interference of Nef with T-lymphocyte chemotaxis via its association with the cellular kinase PAK 2. Mechanistic analysis revealed that this interaction results in deregulation of the actin-severing factor cofilin and thus blocks the chemokine-mediated actin remodeling required for cell motility. However, the efficiency of PAK 2 association is highly variable among <b>Nef</b> <b>proteins</b> from different lentiviruses, prompting us to evaluate the conservation of this actin-remodeling/cofilin-deregulating mechanism. Based on the analysis {{of a total of}} 17 HIV- 1, HIV- 2, and SIV <b>Nef</b> <b>proteins,</b> we report here that inhibition of chemokine-induced actin remodeling as well as inactivation of cofilin are strongly conserved activities of lentiviral <b>Nef</b> <b>proteins.</b> Of note, even for Nef variants that display only marginal PAK 2 association in vitro, these activities require the integrity of a PAK 2 recruitment motif and the presence of endogenous PAK 2.

Hallmarks of apoptosis, such as the formation of DNA ladders and caspase activation, that were observed with the full-length protein were equally evident upon exposure of cells to these motif peptides.

HIV- 1 and other primate lentiviruses use their <b>Nef</b> <b>proteins</b> to manipulate the T cell/APC contact zone, the immunological synapse (IS). It is known that primate lentiviral <b>Nef</b> <b>proteins</b> differ substantially in their ability to modulate cell surface expression of the TCR-CD 3 and CD 28 receptors critical for the formation and function of the IS.

Downmodulation of CXCR 4 was abolished by mutations that disrupt the constitutively strong AP- 2 clathrin adaptor binding element located in the N-terminal region of the Nef molecule, suggesting that Nef accelerates CXCR 4 endocytosis via an AP- 2 -dependent pathway. Together, these results point to CXCR 4 as playing an important role in simian immunodeficiency virus and possibly also HIV- 2 persistence in vivo that is unrelated to viral entry into target cells.

In these hosts, infection of the thymus results in a decreased output of naive T cells that {{may contribute to the}} development of immunodeficiency. We have previously shown that HIV- 1 subtype B <b>Nef</b> <b>proteins</b> can block human T-cell development. However, the underlying mechanism(s) and the conservation of this Nef function between different groups of HIV and SIV remained to be determined. ResultsWe investigated whether reduction of thymic output is a conserved function of highly divergent lentiviral <b>Nef</b> <b>proteins</b> including those from both types of human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV- 1 and HIV- 2), their direct simian counterparts (SIVcpz, SIVgor and SIVsmm, respectively), and some additional SIV strains. We found that expression of most of these nef alleles in thymocyte progenitors impaired T-cell development and reduced thymic output. For HIV- 1 Nef, binding to active p 21 protein (Cdc 42 /Rac) -activated kinase (PAK 2) was a major determinant of this function. In contrast, selective disruption of PAK 2 binding did not eliminate the effect on T-cell development of SIVmac 239 Nef, as was shown by expressing mutants in a newly discovered PAK 2 activating structural motif (PASM) constituted by residues I 117, H 121, T 218 and Y 221, as well as previously described mutants. Rather, down-modulation of cell surface CD 3 was sufficient for reduced thymic output by SIVmac Nef, while other functions of SIV Nefs contributed. ConclusionsOur results indicate that primate lentiviral <b>Nef</b> <b>proteins</b> impair development of thymocyte precursors into T cells in multiple ways. The interaction of HIV- 1 Nef with active PAK 2 by HIV- 1 seem to be most detrimental, and downregulation of CD 3 by HIV- 2 and most SIV <b>Nef</b> <b>proteins</b> sufficient for reduced thymic output. Since the reduction of thymic output by Nef is a conserved property of divergent lentiviruses, it is likely to be relevant for peripheral T-cell depletion in poorly adapted primate lentiviral infections.

40|$|The {{efficacy}} of cellular immune responses elicited by HIV vaccines {{is dependent on}} their strength, durability and antigenic breadth. The regulatory proteins are abundantly expressed early in the viral life cycle and CTL recognition may bring about early killing of infected cells. We synthesised DNA vaccine constructs that encode consensus HIV- 1 subtype C Tat, Rev and <b>Nef</b> <b>proteins.</b> Proteins carrying inactivating mutations were tested for functional activity and highly expressing, inactive Tat, Rev and Nef mutants were identified and their reading frames fused into a TatRevNef cassette. Single- and polygene Tat, Rev and/or Nef constructs were immunogenic in BALB/c mice. These constructs may serve to increase the antigenic breadth for an HIV- 1 vaccine that is relevant for sub-Saharan Africa...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV- 1) <b>Nef</b> <b>protein</b> is now regarded as a regulatory protein responsible not only for establishment of infection and increased pathogenesis but also for enhancement of viral replication. However, the mechanism of Nef-induced activation of viral replication remains to be clearly understood. Using transient transfection assay, co-immunoprecipitation and pull-down analysis, we demonstrate in this report that the HIV- 1 <b>Nef</b> <b>protein</b> physically interacts with Tat, the principal transactivating protein of HIV- 1. Our observations with single cycle replication experiments further indicate that this interaction results not only in enhancement of Tat-induced HIV- 1 long terminal repeat-mediated gene expression but also in virus production...|$|E
40|$|The {{vertical}} transmission of HIV- 1 {{from the mother}} to fetus is known, but the molecular mechanism regulating this transmission is not fully characterized. The fetus is highly protected by the placenta, which does not permit microbial pathogens to cross the placental barrier. In the present study, a rat model was established to observe the effect of HIV- 1 protein Nef on placental barrier. Evans blue dye was used to assay permeability of placental barrier and fourteen day pregnant Sprague Dawley rats were injected intravenously with 2 % Evans blue dye along with various concentrations of recombinant Nef. After an hour, animals were sacrificed and dye migration was observed through the assimilation of peripheral blood into fetus. Interestingly, traces of recombinant <b>Nef</b> <b>protein</b> were detected in the embryo as well as amniotic fluid and amniotic membrane along with placenta and uterus. Our study indicates that recombinant HIV- 1 -Nef protein breaches the placental barrier and allows the migration of Evans blue dye to the growing fetus. Further the concentration of <b>Nef</b> <b>protein</b> in blood is directly proportional to the intensity of dye migration and {{to the amount of}} <b>Nef</b> <b>protein</b> detected in uterus, placenta, amniotic membrane, amniotic fluid and embryo. Based on this study, it can be concluded that the HIV- 1 <b>Nef</b> <b>protein</b> has a direct effect on breaching of the placental barrier in the model we have established in this study. Our observations will be helpful to understand the molecular mechanisms related to this breach o...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Complex {{mechanisms}} of {{human immunodeficiency virus}} type- 1 (HIV- 1) brain pathogenesis suggest the contribution of individual HIV- 1 gene products. Among them, the <b>Nef</b> <b>protein</b> {{has been reported to}} harbor a major determinant of pathogenicity in AIDS-like disease. The goal {{of the present study was}} to determine whether <b>Nef</b> <b>protein</b> expressed in vivo by primary macrophages could induce a brain toxicity also affecting the behavior of the rat. To achieve this goal we grafted Nef-transduced macrophages into the rat hippocampus. Two months post-transplantation, we observed that Nef induces monocyte/macrophage recruitment, expression of TNF-�, and astrogliosis. No apoptotic event was detected. We further demonstrated that Nef neurotoxicity is associated with cognitive deficits. —Mordelet...|$|E
40|$|The nef {{genes of}} human {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 (HIV- 1) and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) encode a 27 - to 34 -kDa myristoylated protein which induces downregulation of CD 4 surface levels and enhances virus infectivity. In adult macaques, Nef has been implicated in pathogenesis and disease progression. Both HIV- 1 SF 2 Nef and SIVmac 239 Nef {{have been shown to}} associate with a cellular serine/threonine kinase. We tested five functional Nef isolates to examine whether this kinase association is a property conserved among different isolates. HIV- 1 SF 2 and 248 and SIVmac 239 <b>Nef</b> <b>proteins</b> were found associated with the kinase. HIV- 1 NL 4 - 3 and 233 <b>Nef</b> <b>proteins</b> were found weakly associated or not associated with the kinase. All five Nef isolates efficiently downregulated CD 4 cell surface expression, suggesting that the association with this cellular kinase is not required for Nef to downregulate CD 4. Comparison of the SF 2 and NL 4 - 3 isolates shows a differential ability of Nef to enhance infectivity that suggests a possible correlation between kinase association and enhancement of infectivity...|$|R
