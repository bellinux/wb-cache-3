50|$|A {{constitutional}} referendum {{was held in}} Ivory Coast on 30 October 2016. Voters were asked whether they approve of a proposed new constitution. The new constitution would create a Senate, remove the <b>nationality</b> <b>clause</b> from the presidential requirements and establish the post of Vice-President. The constitution was approved by 93.42% of votes with a 42.42% turnout, as announced {{by the president of}} the Independent Electoral Commission (CEI).|$|E

[...] The 1952 Act sets forth the legal requirements for the acquisition of, and divestiture from, American nationality. The requirements have become more explicit since the ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution, with the most recent changes to the law having been made by Congress in 2001.|$|E
40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Transatlantic airline operations between the United States and European Union (EU) nations are currently governed by bilateral agreements that are specific to the United States and each EU country. Since 1992, the United States has signed so-called "Open Skies" agreements with 15 of the 25 EU countries. A "nationality clause" in each agreement allows only those airlines designated by the signatory countries to participate in their transatlantic markets. In November 2002, the European Court of Justice ruled that existing Open Skies agreements were illegal under EU law, in part because their nationality clauses discriminated against airlines of other EU nations. The United States and the EU have been negotiating revisions to these agreements. Experts agree that removing the <b>nationality</b> <b>clause</b> is central to any new agreement. GAO was asked to report on (1) how prevalent Open Skies agreements are and what their effects on airlines and consumers are, (2) what the key ways that commercial aviation between the United States and the EU could be changed by the Court of Justice decision are, and (3) how the elimination of <b>nationality</b> <b>clause</b> restrictions might affect airlines and consumers. GAO's work included both analyzing data on transatlantic air service and evaluating information from and positions of industry officials, subject-matter experts, and stakeholder groups. GAO is making no recommendations. ...|$|E
50|$|In {{spite of}} the fact that the 1981 act {{repealed}} most of the provisions of 1948 act and the <b>nationality</b> <b>clauses</b> in subsequent independence acts, the acquisition of new categories of British nationality created by the 1981 act was often dependent on nationality status prior to 1 January 1983, the date the 1981 act came into effect, so many of the provisions of the 1948 act and subsequent independence acts are still relevant. Not taking this into account might lead one to the erroneous conclusion, for example, that the 1981 act's repeal of the <b>nationality</b> <b>clauses</b> in the Kenya Independence Act of 1963 restored British nationality to those who lost their CUKC status as a result of Kenya's independence in 1963. This is one of the reasons for the complexity of British nationality law; in complicated cases, determining British nationality status requires an examination of several nationality acts in their original form.|$|R
40|$|This article {{critically}} {{reviews the}} developments of integration of direct {{taxes in the}} light of three communications by the European Commission and three judgments by the European Court of Justice, suggesting the not always predictable direction in which European law proceeds in this domain. The analysis of the three instrument of soft coordination of direct taxes suggests that this type of instrument should be used to steer a still non-existing European coordinated tax policy, rather than duplicate case law of the European Court of Justice. The analysis of the three judgments highlights the inconsistency of case law on <b>nationality</b> <b>clauses</b> in tax treaties with general case law and the shortcomings of not relieving juridical double taxation, but also the positive aspects of the removal of cash-flow disadvantages on outbound flows of dividends. The article was drafted in the framework of research activities monitoring the development of European tax law for the European Science Foundation as Awardee of the European Young Investigator Award...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{focuses on}} the issue of {{liberalisation}} of international civil aviation, examining how the law could accommodate a reform of the Chicago regime. It looks into {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} the most prominent legal options available to States to implement liberalisation, namely, amending the Chicago Convention, including market access in air transport in the GATS Annex on Air Transport Services, waiving the <b>nationality</b> <b>clauses</b> and concluding inter-regional air transport agreements. Via this process, the paper aspires to identify the optimal legal path to liberalisation. The analysis suggests that there is no single way to achieve liberalisation nor is there a shortcut. Instead, it appears that what catalyses liberalisation is the combined effect of the interplay between the various legal options. The paper concludes that, however accommodating the law might be, liberalisation occurs when economics and politics merge, an outcome which in international civil aviation appears to be a long way down the road, but certainly not out of sight...|$|R

The historical approach of this article explains the impact that the early oil conces- sions had on the migration patterns in the AGSs.

40|$|The 'Open Skies' policy {{launched}} by the United States in 1992 gave birth to new bilateral agreements between them and most Member States of the European Union, as the latter were adopting a single aviation market. Nevertheless, the <b>nationality</b> <b>clause</b> the agreements included conflicted with the Community principle of freedom of establishment. On November 5, 2002, the European Court of Justice therefore ruled there was indeed violation. However, the true question raised by the agreements focused less on such violation, which was anterior to those agreements, than on their fragmentation and the inequality they created in the Europe/United States aviation relations. Indeed, the issue to be stressed in the judgments {{is linked to the}} building of the external competence of the Union with regards to aviation. While the Court refused to grant total competence to the Community, it made that of the Member States impracticable, leading to a global mandate for the Commission. Although the orientations of the agreements to be concluded are foreseeable, the role the European Union will play in a potential multilateral negotiation remains to be defined...|$|E
40|$|America clearly {{stands to}} gain (from open skies) as its free market {{efficiency}} would {{be extended to}} a new sector of global activity” – Speech by Martin Broughton, Chairman British Airways, at HBS Jan 19 th 2006 The U. S. and E. U. have been in discussions {{to open up the}}ir aviation markets for over a decade. The latest attempt to open up the markets is currently on hold and looks likely to be rejected by the U. S. administration over concerns on foreign ownership. The proposed "open skies " agreement would bring together the world's two largest aviation markets, allowing E. U. and U. S. airlines to fly to wherever they want and charge whatever they want on trans-Atlantic flights. Under the present bilateral pacts, European airlines can fly to any U. S. airport only from airports located in their home country. Because of this <b>nationality</b> <b>clause,</b> European airlines risk losing U. S. landing rights if they merge- which has led to fragmentation in the European industry. The E. U. also wants the U. S. to lift foreign ownership restrictions to allow cross-border mergers and investment to take place. This paper will analyse the pros and cons for the U. S. in the open skies proposal and make a recommendation as to whether it should go ahead...|$|E
40|$|Having taken a {{backseat}} in {{the concerns of}} those in charge of European sport since the famous Bosman ruling the issue known as the «nationality clauses» in team sports recently resurged acutely within the debates. It was the International Football Federation (FIFA) which restarted the debate by approving {{at the end of}} May 2008, a project with the explicit objective of limiting the number of players that « cannot be selected for a national team »(i. e. mainly foreign players) in the teams of the national championships. This initiative known as « 6 + 5 » was given a very cold reception by the European Commission and the European Parliament for which «all had been said» in terms of the sporting jurisprudence of the Court of Justice of Luxembourg. But for FIFA, such a clause would be beneficial because it is able to maintain the sporting identity of the clubs, to protect national teams, to guarantee the fairness of competitions and to encourage the training of young people, all at the same time. All objectives which would make legitimate, in its view, a Community free hand, especially as it «does not go against the European law on the freedom of workers movement». Thus it seems the Bosman ruling has not said everything. Could it have in addition left room for manoeuvre for the reintroduction of <b>nationality</b> <b>clauses</b> regarded as the panacea to cure the «pain» which professional sport is suffering today ?SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|Airlines are {{not able}} to conduct their {{businesses}} {{in the same way as}} other global transnational industries. They are inhibited by the foreign ownership restrictions in Air Services Agreements and national laws. Since the United Kingdom and the United States signed the first Bermuda agreement in 1946, the <b>nationality</b> <b>clauses</b> contained in virtually all bilaterals have limited the companies designated to provide services to those airlines owned and managed by nationals of the respective countries. A key reason why foreign ownership rules remain in place is that they protect national airlines. In doing so, they also limit the strategies available to governments whose carriers are in difficulties. The 57 years old bilateral system restricts the development of international air services, adversely affecting airlines and their users- travellers and the tourism and air freight industries. As time goes on, the rapidly changing air transport environment of privatisation, liberalisation and globalisation is forcing airlines to seek structural adjustments in order to survive in the new millennium. Airlines are asking to have more freedom for their strategies, in order to enhance their profitability. Pressures have been growing to ease the ownership rules contained in bilateral agreements to allow airlines greater commercial freedom. As there is no comprehensive research on the topic, this study aims to provide a detailed analysis of the impact of airline ownership rules. It will provide a point of reference for organisations like ICAO and nations to review the ownership issue in the future. This research starts with a review of the historical background, the current limitations in different countries and the pros and cons of ownership rules. It analyses how aviation markets have been influenced to date around the world and how governments and carriers have responded to these influences. It goes on to identify the main benefits and risks of foreign investment, and the motives for foreign investment in the EU and Asia- Pacific. It assesses the prospects for change in ownership rules under multilateral and plurilateral proposals, and develops a strategy for changing the current ownership rules. It concludes by predicting how airlines will react to such changes and makes suggestions for European Airlines in the Asia-Pacific region...|$|R

50|$|The {{enactment}} of IIRAIRA in 1996 added onto the Immigration and <b>Nationality</b> Act a <b>clause,</b> titled Section 287(g), which allows {{state and local}} law enforcement officials to enforce federal immigration law on the condition that they are trained and monitored by ICE. This agreement in practice permits local and state enforcement officials to arrest and even detain individuals they encounter during their day-to-day duties if they suspect them to be or “identify” them as undocumented immigrants. However, many of the individuals picked up by local law enforcement have committed minor offenses, such as driving infractions, and lacked proper identification when stopped. Many civil rights groups have accused Section 287(g) of permitting or causing racial profiling.|$|R
40|$|After a {{reconstruction}} of the traditional legal setting of extradition, the paper explores the European Arrest Warrant Framework Decision’s <b>nationality</b> and residence <b>clauses</b> in their normative context: mutual recognition and mutual trust. It then discusses how these clauses have been implemented at Member States’ level and the problems encountered therein with the surrender of a state national and with (some degree of) financial solidarity that {{the construction of the}} area of freedom, security, and justice (AFSJ) presupposes. Another section tackles the position taken by the European Court of Justice (CJEU) in its case law (Kozłowski and Wolzenburg) in order to analyse how it contributes to the emergence of an AFSJ in line with current developments of the European constitutional evolution, namely the (former first pillar) acquis on the European citizenship and the Member States’ common constitutional traditions on sanctioning theories, placing a paramount attention on the principle of social rehabilitation of convicted persons. Finally, the paper draws attention to European citizenship, which is at present nothing but a ‘spectre’ of the AFSJ but has great potential for a sound AFSJ construct, where state powers cannot discriminate against individuals according to their status persona...|$|R
