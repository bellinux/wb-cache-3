40|$|This paper {{studies the}} effect of {{longitudinal}} magnetic field on ultrasonic vibration in single walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) based on nonlocal continuum medium theory. Governing partial differential equations of CNTs are derived by considering the Lorentz magnetic forces applied on CNTs induced by a longitudinal magnetic field through Maxwell equations. The vibration characteristics of CNTs under a longitudinal magnetic field are obtained by solving the governing equations via wave propagation approach. The effects of longitudinal magnetic field on vibration of CNTs are discussed through numerical experiments. The present analysis show that vibration frequencies of CNTs drops dramatically {{in the presence of}} the magnetic field for various circumferential wavenumbers. Such effect is also observed for various boundary conditions of the CNT. New features for {{the effect of}} longitudinal magnetic field on ultrasonic vibration of CNTs, presented in this paper are useful in the design of <b>nano-drive</b> device, nano-oscillator and actuators and nano-electron technology, where carbon nanotubes act as basic elements...|$|E
