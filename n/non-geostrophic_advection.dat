40|$|The {{baroclinic}} stability properties of non-geostrophic atmospheric flow in a channel are investigated. The model is formulated {{so as to}} include the effects of latitudinal variations of the perturbations and the basic state parameters, which constitute an essential aspect of the non-geostrophic {{baroclinic stability}} problem. Spectral and finite-difference techniques are applied to obtain numerical solutions {{and the results are}} found in agreement. In order to allow for high horizontal resolution the present calculations are restricted to a particular two-layer model which appears to incorporate the major non-geostrophic aspects of the baroclinic instability problem. A purely non-geostrophic type of baroclinic instability is found which bears some resemblance to barotropic instability in spite of the absence of latitudinal shear in the zonal flow. This instability is introduced by the twisting term in the vorticity equation and the <b>non-geostrophic</b> <b>advection</b> of temperature in the thermodynamic equation. For low Richardson numbers and short cyclonic waves this instability at-tains the same order of magnitude as the quasi-geostrophic baroclinic instability. Th...|$|E
