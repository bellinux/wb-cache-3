The mechanisms of interferences were explained based on the matrix energy demand (MED) supposing the local thermal equilibrium (LTE) in plasma, emphasizing also processes contrasting with this model. Matrix effects {{were found to be}} dependent on the coupling geometry of the rf power to the torch, observation height, emitting Ca species and EIEs ma-trix nature but independent from Al as regards its salt origin. The magnitude of the matrix effects was correlated with the electron number density and the discharge temperature. The optimization of the observation height and use of the DRT geometry allowed the reduction of EIEs and Al matrix effects on the emission of Ca species compared to SRT. The best Ca detection limits in SRTrfCCP were at CaOH 622 nm (106 – 450 ng ml– 1), while in DRTrfCCP at Ca I 422. 673 nm (92 – 145 ng ml– 1) ...|$|E
40|$|A total {{consumption}} low sample introduction {{system has been}} applied {{for the first time}} to the multielement analysis of non-diluted cerebrospinal fluids (CSFs) by means of inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). A 2. 5 μL sample volume has been injected into an air carrier stream in agreement with the air-segmented injection principle. The sample plug has been turned into an aerosol by means of a high efficiency nebulizer (HEN) and further introduced into the so-called high temperature torch integrated sample introduction system (hTISIS). A transient signal has been thus obtained. For spiked CSF real samples it has been verified that the higher the temperature, the greater the sensitivity. Under optimized conditions, the hTISIS provides peak areas around four times higher than those provided by the spectrometer default device (i. e., a double pass spray chamber). Additional advantages provided by the former system include limits of detection up to 6 times lower and narrower peaks as compared to those reported for the double pass spray chamber. Furthermore, the use of the hTISIS is not detrimental from the point of view oxide production and doubly charged ion generation. Regarding the extent of <b>non-spectral</b> <b>interference</b> caused by the CSF matrix, it has been verified that, with the hTISIS, recoveries for spiked real samples were close to 100 % for a set of 14 different elements (V, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, As, Se, Mo, Cd, Sb, Ba, Tl and Pb). Meanwhile, in segmented flow injection mode, the reference system provided recoveries from 200 to 500 %, depending on the element and the sample, thus demonstrating the occurrence of matrix effects.

40|$|Inductively coupled plasma mass {{spectrometry}} {{of environmental and}} biological samples is often hampered by spectral and <b>non-spectral</b> <b>interferences.</b> Spectral interferences, caused by the limited resolution of the quadrupole mass spectrometer, can be eliminated {{in a variety of}} ways. For their identification inspection of a signal versus carrier gas flowrate is useful. Anion exchange allows the removal of most S and Cl containing compounds, which are at the origin of the majority of spectral interferences. Matrix modification, for example the addition of ethanol and subsequent optimization of the gas flow rates in a number of cases enables the reduction of the interferences to insignificant values. Often a mathematical correction based on isotopic signal ratios can be applied. <b>Non-spectral</b> <b>interferences</b> can be divided in reversible, that is occurring while the sample is being measured, and irreversible matrix effects, that is clogging of the nebulizer and sampling orifices or deposition on the torch or in the ion lens stack.

40|$|Rare earth {{elements}} (REEs) {{are greatly}} demanded in modern technology industries and {{are widely used}} in several technological applications. The ability of the REEs {{to carry out their}} unique properties in their specific applications is dependent on the purity of the respective element, as the presence of impurities can affect both their physical and chemical properties. The main metal-impurities in high-purity REOs are basically trace amounts of REEs. This study focuses on the development of methods {{in order to determine the}} purity of standard solutions of Yb and Eu, and high-purity Yb 2 O 3 by the impurity approach, utilizing inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) hyphenated with high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) for online separation of the REEs. Due to the highly concentrated matrix element, certain spectral and <b>non-spectral</b> <b>interferences</b> are commonly associated with the determination of REEs as trace impurities, such as formation of polyatomic ions causing mass overlaps with REEs of interest, and signal suppression effects which reduce the signal intensity of the REEs. In this study, <b>non-spectral</b> <b>interferences</b> were handled by dilution and were found to be not observable when the matrix element concentration was ≤ 10 µg mL- 1. Several attempts were made in order to eliminate the contribution of polyatomic ions to the signal intensities observed at masses of interest. Formation of 174 YbH and 153 EuO hindered the determination of Lu and Tm in their respective sample solutions of Yb and Eu. By altering the plasma conditions from its standard operational conditions, the signal intensity of 174 YbH was reduced, but the reduction was due to an overall decrease in instrumental sensitivity. Separation of the matrix elements from their respective interfered analytes were performed with various separation systems, such as ion pair chromatography (IPC) and extraction chromatography (EXC). IPC utilizing the OS-HIBA and HFBA-HIBA systems were found to be either unsuitable or unsuccessful for online separation of Lu from Yb and Eu from Tm. EXC with the HNO 3 -HDEHP system did successfully separate Lu from Yb and Eu from Tm. Methods developed with the HNO 3 -HDEHP system can be used for the determination of spectrally interfered REEs and as a diagnostic tool to investigate the contribution of polyatomic ions to the signal intensities of the interfered analytes.

Three elements have been determined because of their importance in the petroleum industry: V, Ni and Mn. Sample injection has been accomplished by means of the introduction of a low sample volume (2. 5 μl) into an air carrier stream. A peak has been thus obtained. Two sets of samples have been selected: five solvents (xylene, kerosene, nonane, undecane and hexadecane) and five real samples (biodiesel, diesel, kerosene, superethanol and gasoline). The chamber temperature has been varied when introducing either solvents or real samples. In both cases it has been found that sensitivity peaked at 110 °C heating temperature.

In the chromatographic protocol used, most of the first row transition metals are retained on AG 50 Wx 8 resin, whereby ca. 97. 5 % of the initial matrix can be separated from the rapidly eluting target elements. The main matrix constituents accompanying the rapidly eluting target elements are Si, Mo and ca. 5 % of the total Cr, the latter of which unavoidably elutes prematurely.

A transversely heated graphite furnace was used as the atomizer in both spectrometers. The two most sensitive aluminum lines at 309. 3 nm and 396. 2 nm were investigated and it was found that an iron absorption line at 309. 278 nm, {{in the vicinity of the}} aluminum line at 309. 271 nm, could be responsible for some spectral interference. The simultaneous presence of iron and the organic components of the matrix were responsible for radiation scattering, causing high continuous and also structured background absorption at both wavelengths. The aluminum and iron absorption could not be separated in time, i. e., the iron interference could not be eliminated by optimizing the graphite furnace temperature program. However, an interference-free determination of aluminum was possible carrying out the measurements with HR-CS AAS at 396. 152 nm after applying least squares background correction for the elimination of the structured background.

40|$|Elemental wine {{analysis}} is often required from a nutritional, toxicological, origin and authenticity point of view. Inductively coupled plasma based techniques are usually employed {{for this analysis}} because of their multi-elemental capabilities and good limits of detection. However, the accurate analysis of wine samples strongly depends on their matrix composition (i. e. salts, ethanol, organic acids) since they lead to both spectral and <b>non-spectral</b> <b>interferences.</b> To mitigate ethanol (up to 10 % w/w) related matrix effects in inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES), a microwave-based desolvation system (MWDS) can be successfully employed. This finding suggests that the MWDS could be employed for elemental wine analysis. The goal of this work is to evaluate {{the applicability of the}} MWDS for elemental wine analysis in ICP-AES and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). For the sake of comparison a conventional sample introduction system (i. e. pneumatic nebulizer attached to a spray chamber) was employed. Matrix effects, precision, accuracy and analysis throughput have been selected as comparison criteria. For ICP-AES measurements, wine samples can be directly analyzed without any sample treatment (i. e. sample dilution or digestion) using pure aqueous standards although internal standardization (IS) (i. e. Sc) is required. The behaviour of the MWDS operating with organic solutions in ICP-MS has been characterized for the first time. In this technique the MWDS has shown its efficiency to mitigate ethanol related matrix effects up to concentrations of 1 % (w/w). Therefore, wine samples must be diluted to reduce the ethanol concentration up to this value. The results obtained have shown that the MWDS is a powerful device for the elemental analysis of wine samples in both ICP-AES and ICP-MS. In general, the MWDS has some attractive advantages for elemental wine analysis when compared to a conventional sample introduction system such as: (i) higher detection capabilities; (ii) lower ethanol matrix effects; and (iii) lower spectral interferences (i. e.

Calibration of reference materials (such as the IRMM 3702 Zn) against the JMC Zn and NIST Cu reference materials were performed in wet and/or dry plasma modes (Aridus I and DSN- 100) on a Nu Plasma MC-ICP-MS. Different mass bias correction methods were compared. More than 100 analyses of certified reference materials suggested that the sample-calibrator bracketing correction and the empirical external normalisation methods provide the most reliable corrections, with long term external precisions of 0. 06 and 0. 07 ‰ (2 SD), respectively. Investigation {{of the effect of}} variable analyte to spike concentration ratios on Zn and Cu isotopic determinations indicated that the accuracy of Cu measurements in dry plasma is very sensitive to the relative Cu and Zn concentrations, with deviations of δ 65 Cu from - 0. 4 ‰ (Cu/Zn = 4) to + 0. 4 ‰ (Cu/Zn = 0. 2). A quantitative assessment (with instrumental mass bias corrections) of spectral and <b>non-spectral</b> <b>interferences</b> (Ti, Cr, Co, Fe, Ca, Mg, Na) was performed. Titanium and Cr were the most severe interfering constituents, contributing to inaccuracies of - 5. 1 ‰ and + 0. 60 ‰ on δ 68 / 64 Zn, respectively (for 500 μg l- 1 Cu and Zn standard solutions spiked with 1000 μg l- 1 of Ti or Cr). Preliminary isotopic results were obtained on contrasting sediment matrices from the Scheldt estuary. Significant isotopic fractionation of zinc (from 0. 21 ‰ to 1. 13 ‰ for δ 66 Zn) and copper (from - 0. 38 ‰ to 0. 23 ‰ for δ 65 Cu), suggest a control by physical mixing of continental and marine water masses, characterized by distinct Cu and Zn isotopic signatures.

40|$|Results of a {{systematic}} study concerning <b>non-spectral</b> <b>interferences</b> from sulfuric acid containing matrices {{on a large}} number of elements in inductively coupled plasma–mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) are presented in this work. The signals obtained with sulfuric acid solutions of different concentrations (up to 5 % w w− 1) have been compared with the corresponding signals for a 1 % w w− 1 − nitric acid solution at different experimental conditions (i. e., sample uptake rates, nebulizer gas flows and r. f. powers). The signals observed for 128 Te+, 78 Se+ and 75 As+ were significantly higher when using sulfuric acid matrices (up to 2. 2 -fold for 128 Te+ and 78 Se+ and 1. 8 -fold for 75 As+ in the presence of 5 w w- 1 sulfuric acid) for the whole range of experimental conditions tested. This is in agreement with previously reported observations. The signal for 31 P+ is also higher (1. 1 -fold) in the presence of sulfuric acid. The signal enhancements for 128 Te+, 78 Se+, 75 As+ and 31 P+ are explained in relation to an increase in the analyte ion population as a result of charge transfer reactions involving S+ species in the plasma. Theoretical data suggest that Os, Sb, Pt, Ir, Zn and Hg could also be involved in sulfur-based charge transfer reactions, but no experimental evidence has been found. The presence of sulfuric acid gives rise to lower ion signals (about 10 – 20 % lower) for the other nuclides tested, thus indicating the negative matrix effect caused by changes in the amount of analyte loading of the plasma. The elemental composition of a certified low-density polyethylene sample (ERM-EC 681 K) was determined by ICP-MS after two different sample digestion procedures, one of them including sulfuric acid. Element concentrations were in agreement with the certified values, irrespective of the acids used for the digestion. These results demonstrate that the use of matrix-matched standards allows the accurate determination of the tested elements in a sulfuric acid matrix...|$|R
40|$|Part I: Ultra-trace {{determination}} of vanadium in lake sediments: {{a performance comparison}} using O 2, N 20, and NH 3 as reaction gases in ICP-DRC-MS Thermal ion-molecule reactions, targeting removal of specific spectroscopic interference problems, have become {{a powerful tool for}} method development in quadrupole based inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) applications. A study was conducted to develop an accurate method for the {{determination of}} vanadium in lake sediment samples by ICP-MS, coupled with a dynamic reaction cell (DRC), using two differenvchemical resolution strategies: a) direct removal of interfering C 10 + and b) vanadium oxidation to VO+. The performance of three reaction gases that are suitable for handling vanadium interference in the dynamic reaction cell was systematically studied and evaluated: ammonia for C 10 + removal and oxygen and nitrous oxide for oxidation. Although it was able to produce comparable results for vanadium to those using oxygen and nitrous oxide, NH 3 did not completely eliminate a matrix effect, caused by the presence of chloride, and required large scale dilutions (and a concomitant increase in variance) when the sample and/or the digestion medium contained large amounts of chloride. Among the three candidate reaction gases at their optimized Eonditions, creation of VO+ with oxygen gas delivered the best analyte sensitivity and the lowest detection limit (2. 7 ng L- 1). Vanadium results obtained from fourteen lake sediment samples and a certified reference material (CRM 031 - 040 - 1), using two different analytelinterference separation strategies, suggested that the vanadium mono-oxidation offers advantageous performance over the conventional method using NH 3 for ultra-trace vanadium determination by ICP-DRC-MS and can be readily employed in relevant environmental chemistry applications that deal with ultra-trace contaminants. Part II: Validation of a modified oxidation approach for the quantification of total arsenic and selenium in complex environmental matrices Spectroscopic interference problems of arsenic and selenium in ICP-MS practices were investigated in detail. Preliminary literature review suggested that oxygen could serve as an effective candidate reaction gas for analysis of the two elements in dynamic reaction cell coupled ICP-MS. An accurate method was developed for the determination of As and Se in complex environmental samples, based on a series of modifications on an oxidation approach for As and Se previously reported. Rhodium was used as internal standard in this study to help minimize <b>non-spectral</b> <b>interferences</b> such as instrumental drift. Using an oxygen gas flow slightly higher than 0. 5 mL min-I, arsenic is converted to 75 AS 160 + ion in an efficient manner whereas a potentially interfering ion, 91 Zr+, is completely removed. Instead of using the most abundant Se isotope, 80 Se, selenium was determined by a second most abundant isotope, 78 Se, in the form of 78 Se 160. Upon careful selection of oxygen gas flow rate and optimization ofRPq value, previous isobaric threats caused by Zr and Mo were reduced to background levels whereas another potential atomic isobar, 96 Ru+, became completely harmless to the new selenium analyte. The new method underwent a strict validation procedure where the recovery of a suitable certified reference material was examined and the obtained sample data were compared with those produced by a credible external laboratory who analyzed the same set of samples using a standardized HG-ICP-AES method. The validation results were satisfactory. The resultant limits of detection for arsenic and selenium were 5 ng L- 1 and 60 ng L- 1, respectively...|$|R
40|$|Cu and Zn isotope {{biogeochemistry}} {{has already}} been applied to study oceanic environments via deep ocean carbonates (Pichat et al., 2003), sediment trap samples, sediments and Fe-Mn nodules (Maréchal et al., 2000). So far, no study has been published on Cu and Zn isotopic fractionation in estuarine environments, while estuaries represent fundamental stages in the hydrological and geochemical cycles of these metals. Estuarine environments are characterized by strong physico-chemical gradients (pH, eH, dissolved oxygen, [...] .) related to marine- and fresh waters mixing and important biological activity (Paucot et al., 1997). Those physico-chemical gradients induce important redistribution of trace elements between dissolved and particulate phases. We therefore anticipate fractionation of Cu and Zn isotopes to occur in estuaries with {{a greater extent than}} in open ocean. This study focuses on results of Cu and Zn elemental and isotopic compositions of centrifuged suspended particulate matter (SPM) of the Scheldt estuary (Belgium and Netherlands, campain Eurothroph April 2003). Samples were collected at 6 stations along a 100 km transect (Belgica vessel). Present results are compared with previous data obtained on surface sediments and SPM of November 2002 (Petit et al., 2004). Prior to standard HF+HNO 3 dissolution procedure, organic matter was digested by repeated additions of concentrated H 2 O 2. Separation of Cu, Fe and Zn was carried out by one step ion-exchange chromatography on AG-MP 1 resin. To avoid fractionation artifacts, the full recovery of Cu, Fe and Zn from different matrix samples (basalt, sediment and limestone) was quantitatively verified. Total blanks were negligible: 1. 5; 11 and 4. 5 ng for Cu, Fe and Zn, respectively. Cu and Zn isotopic ratios were measured with a “Nu-Plasma” MC-ICP-MS (ULB). Instrumental mass bias was corrected by simultaneous standard-sample bracketing and external normalisation, assuming an exponential mass fractionation law. Reference materials were Zn JMC and Cu NIST SRM 976 standards. The Nu plasma allowed 60 Ni to be simultaneously monitored and used for systematic correction on 64 Zn. Reference materials were repeatedly measured, giving a long-term reproducibility of ± 0. 07 per mil for delta 65 Cu and delta 66 Zn (2 s, n= 158 over 13 analysis sessions). Average total beam intensities are 6 V/ppm. The whole methodology has been checked for spectral and <b>non-spectral</b> <b>interferences,</b> as well as artifacts related to analyte-to-dopant concentration ratios. Each sample was analyzed for at least three concordant replicates. Profiles of concentration vs. salinity show expected Cu and Zn enrichments in SPM in the upper estuary and a non conservative decrease seaward. As a whole, Cu and Zn concentration range from 100 ppm (at 5 psu) to 0. 6 ppm (at 30 psu) and from 600 ppm (at 5 psu) to 100 ppm (at 30 psu), respectively. Delta 66 Zn values of SPM describe a positive linear correlation with salinity, i. e. a "conservative" trend from 0. 24 ± 0. 07 per mil at 1 psu to 0. 61 ± 0. 01 per mil at 30 psu. In contrast, delta 65 Cu shows rapid variations from 0. 00 ± 0. 03 per mil at 1 psu to + 0. 99 ± 0. 03 per mil at 3 psu down to - 0. 78 ± 0. 02 per mil at 13 psu. Those contrasted behavior and amplitude of variation may reflect differences in reactivity of species related to Cu and Zn speciation, as can be revealed by acidimetric titration. When both seasons are considered, delta 65 Cu variations in the SPM are more important in April 2003 relative to November 2002 (1. 44 against 0. 37 per mil, respectively), while delta 66 Zn results show no significant seasonal change. Compared to sediments, SPM samples are systematically enriched in light Cu and Zn isotopes in the lower estuary (downstream the Maximum Turbidity Zone) where sediments show a regular increase in delta 66 Zn and delta 65 Cu seaward. This study provides a stepping-stone for further investigation of exchange processes of metals between particulate and dissolved phases in estuarine environment. These preliminary results pinpoint significant spatial and temporal variations in isotopic compositions of particulate Cu and Zn as well as contrasted isotopic signatures between sediments and suspended particulate matter. Cu and Zn isotopic variations within estuarine particulate phases suggest to revisit the use of particulate Cu and Zn for constraining their biogeochemical, behavior, so far essentially studied via the dissolved phase...|$|R
