5|$|Horses, plains zebras and {{mountain}} zebras live in stable, closed family groups or harems consisting of one adult male, several females and their offspring. These groups {{have their own}} home ranges which overlap {{and they tend to}} be nomadic. The stability of the group remains even when the family stallion dies or is displaced. Plains zebra groups gather into large herds and may create temporarily stable subgroups within a herd, allowing individuals to interact with those outside their group. Among harem-holding species, this behavior has only otherwise been observed in primates like the gelada and the hamadryas baboon. Females of harem species benefit as males give them more time for feeding, protection for their young, as well as protection from predators and harassment by outside males. Among females in a harem, a linear dominance hierarchy exists based on the time at which they join the group. Harems travel in a consistent filing order with the high-ranking mares and their offspring leading the groups followed by the next highest ranking mare and her offspring and so on. The family stallion takes up the rear. Social grooming (which involves individuals rubbing their heads against each other and <b>nipping</b> with the incisors and lips) is important for easing aggression and maintaining social bonds and status. Young of both sexes leave their natal groups as they mature; females are usually abducted by outside males to be included as permanent members of their harems.|$|E
5|$|In Katherine Buetow's {{guide to}} the Australian Cattle Dog, Ian Dunbar {{makes the point that}} while people think of dog {{training}} as teaching a dog to sit, speak and roll over, the dog already knows how to do these things. Training, he says, involves teaching the dog that {{it is a good idea}} to do these things when a particular word is said or signal is given. He goes on to explain his belief that training is about opening communication channels, so that the dog knows what the handler wants it to do, and knows that it will be worth its while to do it. Consequences for the dog can be rewards for doing what is required, as recommended by Dunbar, or corrections where an unwanted behaviour is performed. Like other working breeds, the Australian Cattle Dog is intelligent and responsive; both of these traits can be an advantage in training where a structured, varied program is used, but can lead to unwanted outcomes if training is not consistent, or is repetitive and boring for the dog. Stock dog trainer Scott Lithgow recommends making training a game so the Cattle Dog learns that obedience leads to enjoyment. Many of a Cattle Dog's natural behaviours are undesirable in a pet: barking, chewing, chasing, digging, defending territory, and <b>nipping</b> heels. Training, therefore, involves helping the dog adopt a lifestyle that is probably very different from that of its droving ancestors. The Australian Cattle Dog is biddable, and responds well to training.|$|E

25|$|Several exotic {{freshwater}} fish species, including brown, brook and rainbow trout, Atlantic and Chinook salmon, redfin perch, common carp, and mosquitofish, {{have been introduced}} to Australian waterways. The mosquitofish is a particularly aggressive species known for harassing and <b>nipping</b> the fins of other fish.

The introduced trout species have had serious negative impacts on a number of upland native fish species including trout cod, Macquarie perch and mountain galaxias species as well as other upland fauna such as the spotted tree frog. The common carp is strongly implicated in the dramatic loss in waterweed, decline of small native fish species and permanently elevated levels of turbidity in the Murray-Darling Basin of south west Australia.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Nod 26 -like {{intrinsic}} proteins (<b>NIPs)</b> {{that belong}} to the aquaporin superfamily are unique to plants. According to homology modeling and phylogenetic analysis, the <b>NIP</b> subfamily can be further divided into three subgroups with distinct biological functions (<b>NIP</b> I, <b>NIP</b> II, and <b>NIP</b> III). In some grasses, the <b>NIP</b> III subgroup proteins (<b>NIP</b> 2 s) were demonstrated to be permeable to solutes with larger diameter, such as silicic acid and arsenous acids. However, to date there is no data-mining or direct experimental evidences for the permeability of such larger solutes for dicot <b>NIP</b> 2 s, although they exhibit similar three-dimensional structures as those in grasses. It is therefore intriguing to investigate the molecular mechanisms that drive the evolution of plant <b>NIP</b> 2 s. Results The <b>NIP</b> III subgroup is more ancient with a divergence time that predates the monocot-dicot split. The proliferation of <b>NIP</b> 2 genes in modern grass species is primarily attributed to whole genome and segmental chromosomal duplication events. The structure of <b>NIP</b> 2 genes is relatively conserved, possessing five exons and four introns. All <b>NIP</b> 2 s possess an ar/R filter consisting of G, S, G, and R, except for the cucumber CsNIP 2; 2, where a small G in the H 2 is substituted with the bulkier C residue. Our maximum likelihood analysis revealed that <b>NIP</b> 2 s, especially the loop A (LA) region, have undergone strong selective pressure for adaptive evolution. The analysis at the amino acid level provided strong statistical evidences for the functional divergence between monocot and dicot <b>NIP</b> III subgroup proteins. In addition, several SDPs (Specificity Determining Positions) responsible for functional specificity were predicted. Conclusions The present study provides the first evidences of functional divergence between dicot and monocot <b>NIP</b> 2 s, and suggests that positive selection, {{as well as a}} radical shift of evolutionary rate at some critical amino acid sites is the primary driver. These findings will expand our understanding to evolutionary mechanisms driving the functional diversification of monocot and dicot <b>NIP</b> III subgroup proteins. </p...|$|R

Transient transfection of epitope-tagged <b>Nip</b> 3 in Rat- 1 fibroblasts and MCF- 7 breast carcinoma induces apoptosis within 12 h while cells transfected with the <b>Nip</b> 3 163 mutant have a normal phenotype, suggesting that mitochondrial localization is necessary for induction of cell death. <b>Nip</b> 3 overexpression increases the sensitivity to apoptosis induced by granzyme B and topoisomerase I and II inhibitors. After transfection, both <b>Nip</b> 3 and <b>Nip</b> 3 163 protein levels decrease steadily over 48 h indicating that the protein is rapidly degraded and this occurs {{in the absence of}} cell death.

500|$|When on home ground, the Australian Cattle Dog is {{an affectionate}} and playful pet. However, it is {{reserved}} with people {{it does not}} know and naturally cautious in new situations. Its attitude to strangers makes it an excellent guard dog when trained for this task, {{and it can be}} socialised to become accustomed to a variety of people from an early age as a family pet.

The Australian Cattle Dog can be the friendliest of companions although it is quick to respond to the emotions of its owners, and may defend them without waiting for a command. The ACD was originally bred to move reluctant cattle by biting, and it will bite if treated harshly.

The mutant failed to form pink nitrogen-fixing nodules that occur in the wild-type symbiosis, but instead developed small bump-like nodules on its roots that were blocked at an early stage of development. Examination of the <b>nip</b> nodules by light microscopy after staining with X-Gal for S. meliloti expressing a constitutive GUS gene, by confocal microscopy following staining with SYTO- 13, and by electron microscopy revealed that <b>nip</b> initiated symbiotic interactions and formed nodule primordia and infection threads. The infection threads in <b>nip</b> proliferated abnormally and very rarely deposited rhizobia into plant host cells; rhizobia failed to differentiate further in these cases. <b>nip</b> nodules contained autofluorescent cells and accumulated a brown pigment. Histochemical staining of <b>nip</b> nodules revealed this pigment to be polyphenolic accumulation.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the grammaticality of ‘by’-phrases in the Icelandic New Impersonal Passive (<b>NIP),</b> a {{construction}} that exhibits both passive morphology and properties that are characteristic of the active. The analysis of the <b>NIP</b> is debated, including whether or not ‘by’-phrases are grammatical, {{which is one of}} the most important questions for the syntactic analysis of the <b>NIP.</b> In the paper, we focus on this particular question and compare the <b>NIP</b> to the Low Canonical Passive (LCP). We review two judgment tasks in which the <b>NIP</b> was extensively studied, one conducted by Joan Maling and Sigríður Sigurjónsdóttir and another conducted in the Variation in Syntax project at the University of Iceland. As Jónsson (2009) argues, the results indicate that ‘by’-phrases are indeed grammatical in the <b>NIP</b> but the results are not clear-cut. To gain a better understanding of the problem, we conducted a different kind of a study among 12 - 16 -year-olds (n= 309) and adults (n= 38). We used fragment answers to the question ‘What language is spoken in Norway?’ to categorize <b>NIP</b> speakers (the construction is ungrammatical for many speakers) and Other speakers. The wh-phrase is syncretic for nominative and accusative and here a Canonical Passive participle is identical to a <b>NIP</b> participle. The answer (Norwegian) is not syncretic for both cases and therefore reveals the speaker’s analysis of the question. We compared these results to how speakers answered a similar question that contained a ‘by’-phrase, ‘What language is spoken by Finns?’ If the <b>NIP</b> were an active construction, we would not expect any speakers to produce accusative when answering the latter question. Still, a few speakers did, indicating that ‘by’-phrases are grammatical in the <b>NIP.</b> Accusative was, however, produced significantly more often when speakers answered the first question. We also tested a) how <b>NIP</b> speakers understood a <b>NIP</b> sentence with a PP that should be ambiguous between meaning ‘by’ and ‘from’, and b) how LCP speakers understand an identical LCP sentence. Our results suggest that ‘by’-phrases are grammatical in the <b>NIP</b> but the possibility remains that they are only grammatical for some <b>NIP</b> speakers but ungrammatical for other <b>NIP</b> speakers...|$|R
