The haptics rendering transparency is all the more difficult in distributed collaboration between distant users because it is necessary also to make feel faithfully the mutual interactions. The idea suggested in this article gives an original solution to overcome this lack of transparency in haptic shared collaborations on the network using a principle called the "Latency Envelope" (LE). One advantage of this implementation is the anticipation of the contact between users and virtual objects. The delay can them be partially or completely compensated from the operator <b>perception</b> <b>point</b> of view. Also it does not affect at all the stability of haptics simulation (carried out using well known control laws) ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Increased {{application}} of computer graphics in areas which demand {{high levels of}} realism has made it necessary to examine {{the manner in which}} images are evaluated and validated. In this paper, we explore the need for including the human observer in any process which attempts to quantify the level of realism achieved by the rendering process, from measurement to display. We introduce a framework for measuring the perceptual equivalence (from a lightness <b>perception</b> <b>point</b> of view) between a real scene and a computer simulation of the same scene. Because this framework is based on psychophysical experiments, results are produced through study of vision from a human rather than a machine vision point of view. This framework can then be used to evaluate, validate and compare rendering techniques. ...|$|R

40|$|A novel {{approach}} for suppression of grain noise in ultrasonic signals, based on noncoherent detector statistics and signal entropy, is presented. The {{performance of the}} technique is demonstrated using ultrasonic B-scans from samples with coarse material structure. 1 Introduction The main goal of ultrasonic grain noise suppression in material flaw detection {{is to improve the}} perceptual possibilities of the operator to observe defect echoes. The suppression is defined as perceptually ideal when a received signal (or image) which contains echoes buried in noise is filtered to yield nonzero values only at the positions of the defect echoes. In statistical terms, a perceptual improvement is therefore obtained if the amplitude distribution in the filtered signal (image) is more concentrated around zero than in the raw data (contrast enhancement). A more concentrated amplitude distribution generally means smaller entropy. Thus, from an operator <b>perception</b> <b>point</b> of view, interesting results [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Both {{researchers}} and managers {{depend on the}} accuracy of managers' perceptions. Yet, few studies compare subjective with "objective" data, perhaps because {{it is very difficult}} to do well. These difficulties also muddy interpretations of results. On one hand, studies suggest that managers' perceptions may be very inaccurate. On the other hand, the observed errors in managerial perceptions may arise from research methods instead of managers. Because perceptual data are so significant for both {{researchers and}} managers, researchers need to understand both the potential contaminants of perceptual research and the determinants of perceptual errors and biases. This article reviews studies of the accuracies of managers' <b>perceptions,</b> <b>points</b> out hazards in such research, and suggests various ways to improve studies of perceptions. The suggestions encompass improvements in gathering more valid subjective data, locating more appropriate "objective" data, finding appropriate respondents, and using statistical methods that provide accurate and reliable estimates with small samples. ...|$|R

However, both Nabhani and Ghazali argued that after belief (Aqeeda) is established, divine laws in the Quran are beyond question due to the 'mind' of God being beyond human comprehension. Nabhani loosely affirmed rationalism (not that of the Mu'tazili) but argued that it can establish belief in a God just like Ghazali and Ghazali's teacher al-Juwayni in his book 4, contrary to the common western notion of rationalism.
