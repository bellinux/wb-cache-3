50|$|At {{the end of}} the Second World War, {{enriched by}} US {{investments}} and an oil boom, Mexico had its first demographic boom, in which the primary destination for rural immigrants was Mexico City. Mario Pani Darqui, a famous architect at time, was charged to build its first big scale projects. Built for the Dirección de Pensiones Civiles y Retiro (the <b>National</b> <b>Pensions</b> <b>office,</b> today ISSSTE), the Centro Urbano (or Multifamiliar) Miguel Alemán (1947-50) and the Centro Urbano (or Multifamiliar) Benito Juárez (1951-52), both in the Colonia Roma, introduced formal ideas from Le Corbusier's Ville Radieuse into the urban fabric.|$|R

Although the library is stocked with classical authors, the collection is not thorough and well-arranged. However, the library has a poor collection of modern fiction, which is often a cause of complaint. The library is frequented by students of the nearby schools.|$|R

This office opened for business in July 1989 after the operation {{of many of the}} Department's long-term social welfare schemes was decentralised from Dublin to Sligo. Over the years, the schemes administered by the Office have expanded considerably and a number of new schemes have been added to its existing workload. As a result, there are currently 420 staff working here in Sligo...|$|R

40|$|We {{distinguish}} {{two ways}} in which <b>national</b> public <b>pension</b> systems can distort intra-EU movements of workers. First, each <b>national</b> <b>pension</b> system may display an inherent mobility bias. We propose the 'Lodge Test' to identify any such bias and show that many <b>national</b> <b>pension</b> systems in the EU are not mobility neutral. Second, mobility distortions may arise from differences between <b>national</b> <b>pension</b> systems. Using the CESifo pension model, we estimate both average and year-by-year implicit tax rates for select <b>national</b> <b>pension</b> systems in the EU. We then discuss how the observed differences in implicit tax rates on income may distort mobility and might even give rise to age-specific tax competition...|$|R

50|$|Payments of the <b>national</b> <b>pension</b> are uniform for everyone. To {{this amount}} were added the {{assistance}} payment, which varied {{according to a}} pensioner's marital status, {{the cost of living}} in his or her locality, and other pensions that he or she received. Other supplementary payments could be made for dependent children, for degree of disability, and for housing costs, as well as for veterans of the Civil War and of World War II. <b>National</b> <b>pensions</b> are indexed, and they increase in value each year. Since reforms of the early 1980s, <b>national</b> <b>pensions</b> became not taxable if they were the sole source of income. Pensions were no longer affected by a spouse's earnings or pension income, and the <b>national</b> <b>pension</b> could only be reduced by income from other <b>pensions.</b> The <b>National</b> <b>Pension</b> Plan was funded by the beneficiary's own contributions, about 2 percent of his or her locally taxable income, and by employer contributions of 4 to 5 percent of the insured person's wages.|$|R
50|$|The <b>National</b> <b>Pension</b> Scheme is {{the public}} pension scheme created in 1988 in South Korea. It {{is a part of}} Korea's Social Security Programs, and was {{established}} through the <b>National</b> <b>Pension</b> Act in 1986. In order for a person to qualify for pension, they must be at least 61 years old with at least ten years of contributions. Reduced early pension can be obtained at the age of 56. The normal pension age will be increased to 65 years by 2033, and reduced early pension will be increased to 60 years. The <b>National</b> <b>Pension</b> Scheme was created with a strong redistributive element and participation is mandated by law. Currently, only 29% of elderly received old-age <b>pensions</b> from the <b>National</b> <b>Pension</b> Scheme in 2013. One of the current issues with the <b>National</b> <b>Pension</b> Scheme is that not all retirees will be able to draw benefits from the pension because they have no completed the ten year contribution requirement.|$|R

50|$|Finland's first <b>national</b> old-age <b>pension</b> plan {{dates from}} 1937, {{but it was}} so poorly funded that a new <b>National</b> <b>Pensions</b> Act was put into effect in 1957. In the late 1980s, this law, {{somewhat}} reformed, was still the basis of Finland's <b>National</b> <b>Pension</b> Plan, which was open to all residents over the age of sixteen, even to those who had never paid into it. Even those foreigners not from the Nordic countries were entitled to this pension if they had resided in Finland for at least five years. Those who left for residence in a country outside Nordic Europe, even those who were Finnish citizens, could receive the pension for only one year. The flat-rate <b>national</b> <b>pension</b> could be paid as an old-age pension, once a person reached the age of sixtyfive; as an invalidity pension (either full or partial) to those between the ages of sixteen and sixty-four who were no longer able to work; or, in some cases, to the long-term unemployed who were in their late fifties or early sixties. In addition to these classes of beneficiaries, survivors of those eligible for <b>national</b> <b>pensions</b> who were not themselves eligible for the pensions could receive pensions {{under the terms of the}} Survivor's Pension Plan. Also tied to the <b>National</b> <b>Pension</b> Plan were payments for handicapped children living at home and for some combat veterans of World War II.|$|R
