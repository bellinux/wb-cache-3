40|$|Work {{providing}} a firm basis for building an engineering model thrust subsystem (TSS) is described. A 1500 -hr functional demonstration test revealed {{the impact of}} each element on TSS integration, operation, and future development. The primary conclusions are: accurate and specific definition of interfaces is essential to a timely system integration program. In addition to <b>normal</b> <b>operating</b> <b>requirements,</b> this definition must include requirements for preflight checkout, self-protection of all interfaces, capability expansion, failure modes, maximum input power, interelement power losses, noise and transient sensitivity and production, packaging for vacuum, thermal control, electrical grounding, cabling, mounting, and handling. In any future design, each phase of the TSS operation (startup, throttling, switching, etc.) {{should be considered in}} detail to anticipate and account for possible in-flight variations in element characteristics and performance...|$|E

DOD retains inventory above its <b>normal</b> <b>operating</b> <b>requirements</b> for various reasons including for contingency purposes or {{because it is more}} economical to keep items than dispose and repurchase them later. DOD's inventory levels have grown in recent years to almost $ 80 billion in fiscal year 2005. GAO was asked to assess the management of contingency retention inventory to determine whether (1) the Army, Air Force, Navy, and Defense Logistics Agency have followed inventory guidance and (2) DOD is providing oversight of inventory across these components. Also, GAO provided an update on the progress DOD has made in implementing GAO's past recommendations on the components' management of economic retention inventory. ...|$|E
