5|$|SR 149 was {{relocated}} onto a new two-lane alignment in the mid-1970s, {{leaving behind}} Openshaw Road. Caltrans began studies for interchanges {{at each end}} in September 1992. The California Transportation Commission approved funding for four-laning SR 149 in April 1994 and the two interchanges in May 1996, with construction to begin in 1998 and cost $47 million. Due to state budget problems and the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>study</b> environmental impacts, the project was repeatedly pushed back; these impacts and inflation had more than doubled the cost to $120 million in 2004. In particular, an endangered species of meadowfoam was discovered on the south embankent, forcing a redesign. Construction began in September 2005 on a new freshwater marsh near the State Route 70 intersection to replace beaver ponds {{in the path of}} the highway, and it was completed in March 2006.|$|E

25|$|Charles Fox Parham, an {{independent}} holiness evangelist who believed strongly in divine healing, {{was an important}} figure {{to the emergence of}} Pentecostalism as a distinct Christian movement. In 1900, he started a school near Topeka, Kansas, which he named Bethel Bible School. There he taught that speaking in tongues was the scriptural evidence for the reception of the baptism with the Holy Spirit. On January 1, 1901, after a watch night service, the students prayed for and received the baptism with the Holy Spirit with the evidence of speaking in tongues. Parham received this same experience sometime later and began preaching it in all his services. Parham believed this was xenoglossia and that missionaries would no longer <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>study</b> foreign languages. After 1901, Parham closed his Topeka school and began a four-year revival tour throughout Kansas and Missouri. He taught that the baptism with the Holy Spirit was a third experience, subsequent to conversion and sanctification. Sanctification cleansed the believer, but Spirit baptism empowered for service.|$|E

25|$|Prang et al. (2006) {{assessed}} {{the capacity of}} ACH gels to promote directed axonal regrowth in the injured mammalian CNS. The multivalent ions used to create the alginate-based ACH gels were copper ions, whose diffusion into the sodium alginate layers created hexagonally structured anisotropic capillary gels. After precipitation, the entire gel was traversed by longitudinally oriented capillaries. The ACH scaffolds promoted adult NPC survival and highly oriented axon regeneration. This is the first instance of using alginates to produce anisotropic structured capillary gels. Future studies are <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>study</b> the long-term physical stability of the ACH scaffolds, because CNS axon regeneration can take many months; however, {{in addition to being}} able to provide long-term support the scaffolds must also be degradable. Of all the biological and synthetic biopolymers investigated by Prang et al. (2006), only agarose-based gels were able to compare with the linear regeneration caused by ACH scaffolds. Future studies will also need to investigate whether the ACH scaffolds allow for reinnervation of the target in vivo after a spinal cord injury.|$|E
25|$|Philosophers, {{like all}} {{men at the}} time had to make ways of {{bringing}} food to the table. The most common occupation in the Byzantine Empire would have either been agriculturally based or earlier on in the Empire, trade based so this came about naturally through their own work. However Philosophers needed Patronage in order to live. The most important came from the Imperial court, especially before the destructive civil wars that were characterized by Andronikos III and his son John V. Other sources were from minor courts, from the rich and from the Church, if not from individual Church clergy. Of course, only Bishops had such resources. As the Empire descended into chaos, it could not spare any finances {{in its efforts to}} defend her borders and so the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>study</b> in the fields of science and mathematics would have naturally disappeared from the minds of those whose lands were raided and seized. It would be this lack of Patronage that led to many of these scholars fleeing to the West. Remarkable travels were recorded by John Argyropoulos, Constance, Manuel Chrysoloras who between them all had travelled to Florence, Pavia, Rome, Padua and Milan. It could be said {{that the end of the}} Byzantine Empire coincided with the beginning of the Renaissance â€” what little influence the Byzantine Church had over Rome was more than made up for by their philological preaching and mass conversion to humanism.|$|E

Morita said that Tidus was his favorite, calling him [...] "the most outstanding, most special character to me".

Morita said that there was no difficulty in working as Tidus, since the character's personality was similar to his own, and he did not <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>study</b> the character. However, he was concerned that if fans did not enjoy Tidus it would impact his career. When it announced the Japanese actor, Square said that Morita was chosen because he also did the motion capture for Zell (which would make fans remember previous games).|$|E

The four honours grades together constituted fully half of Hayward's master's program. All four papers underwent examination both internally and externally before their grades (an A-, two As, and an A+) were confirmed.|$|E
