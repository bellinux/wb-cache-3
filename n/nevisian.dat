Held annually in late July/early August, it celebrates <b>Nevisians</b> who have moved away and returned to party with their friends and family. It is a commemoration and festival enjoying the cultural traditions. There's music every night, parties, food festivals, and concerts, culminating in the early march through downtown Charlestown.|$|R

50|$|The ensuing {{depression}} hit Afro-Kittitians and <b>Nevisians</b> especially hard. As {{in previous}} years many migrated to other islands, especially Trinidad, for work. Those that remained were {{in a state of}} starvation and in 1896 frustrated workers set fire to several sugar cane fields.|$|R
50|$|August the 1st is now {{celebrated as}} a public holiday and is called Emancipation Day. In 1883, St. Kitts, Nevis, and Anguilla were all linked under one presidency, located on St. Kitts, {{to the dismay of}} the <b>Nevisians</b> and Anguillans.

2500|$|The {{issues of}} {{political}} dissension between Saint Kitts and Nevis are often centred around perceptions of imbalance {{in the economic}} structure. As noted by many scholars, <b>Nevisians</b> have often referred to a structural imbalance in Saint Kitts' favour in how funds are distributed between the two islands and this issue has made the movement for Nevis secession a constant presence in the island's political arena, with many articles appearing in the local press expressing concerns such as those compiled by Everton Powell in [...] "What Motivates Our Call for Independence": ...|$|R
25|$|Because of {{the early}} {{distribution}} of plots and {{because many of the}} planters departed from the island when sugar cultivation became unprofitable, a relatively large percentage of <b>Nevisians</b> already owned or controlled land at emancipation. Others settled on crown land. This early development of a society with a majority of small, landowning farmers and entrepreneurs created a stronger middleclass in Nevis than in Saint Kitts where the sugar industry continued until 2006. Even though the 15 families in the wealthy planter elite no longer control the arable land, Saint Kitts still has a large, landless working class population.|$|R
50|$|Saint George Basseterre is the {{economic}} heart of Saint Kitts and Nevis, and is of significant {{importance to the}} greater Eastern Caribbean area. Most Kittitians and also many <b>Nevisians</b> work in the city. Basseterre is a regional financial centre, home to the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank Headquarters, {{as well as the}} Eastern Caribbean Stock Exchange. It is also home to the Eastern Caribbean's largest light manufacturing industry. The many hotels and resorts in Frigate Bay also are responsible {{for a lot of the}} islands' employment and foreign exchange earnings. The parish's former main employer, the sugar factory, officially closed in 2005 following dropping world prices.|$|R

25|$|Elquemedo Willett, born 1 May 1953, famous <b>Nevisian</b> cricket {{player and}} former Leeward Islands and West Indies left-arm spinner, {{was the first}} Leeward Islander to play Test cricket for the West Indies in 1973, when he was 19 years old. He was {{inducted}} into the Nevis Sports Museum Hall of Fame in 2005.|$|E
25|$|One {{consequence}} of the French attack was a collapsed sugar industry and during the ensuing hardship on Nevis, small plots of land on the plantations were {{made available to the}} enslaved families in order to control the loss of life due to starvation. With less profitability for the absentee plantation owners, the import of food supplies for the plantation workers dwindled. Between 1776 and 1783, when the food supplies failed to arrive altogether due to the rebellion in North America, 300–400 enslaved <b>Nevisians</b> starved to death. On 1 August 1834, slavery was abolished in the British Empire. In Nevis, 8,815 slaves were freed. The first Monday in August is celebrated as Emancipation Day and is part of the annual Nevis Culturama festival.|$|R
5000|$|Saint Kitts Creole {{today is}} spoken {{on the islands}} of St. Kitts and Nevis (although <b>Nevisians</b> refer to the {{language}} as [...] "Nevisian" [...] or [...] "Nevis creole"), mainly in rural areas, and is spoken especially heavily in Capesterre, Christ Church Nichola Town, Cayon, and Nevis. Today's use of the creole involves {{a higher proportion of}} Standard English, possibly due to access to foreign media. Usually, only residents in rural areas and Nevis are strong creole users, although mesolectal forms of the language are employed by the majority of the population. Popular Jamaican culture and music have also played a role, as Jamaican idioms are being used more and more in the Saint Kitts creole, as well as throughout the region.|$|R
25|$|Born on Tortola in the British Virgin Islands, Bolan {{emigrated to}} Nevis (itself {{part of the}} larger Federation of Saint Kitts and Nevis) at an early age, and went on to {{represent}} both Nevis and the Leeward Islands in regional underage tournaments. Considered an all-rounder, he made his Twenty20 debut for Nevis against Montserrat in the 2008 edition of the Stanford 20/20 competition. Aged 17 {{at the time of the}} match, he did not bat or bowl during the game, and was not selected for Nevis' fixture in the second round of the tournament. Having represented the Leewards under-19s team in the 2009 West Indies Under-19 Challenge, Bolan was one of two <b>Nevisians</b> selected in the West Indies under-19s squad for the 2010 ICC Under-19 World Cup, held in New Zealand. Taking five wickets from his three matches at the tournament, he was sponsored by the Nevis branch of the Caribbean Development Bank, and also received equipment from the Government of Saint Kitts and Nevis.|$|R
25|$|Nevis is of {{particular}} historical significance to Americans {{because it was the}} birthplace and early childhood home of Alexander Hamilton. For the British, Nevis is the place where Horatio Nelson was stationed as a young sea captain, and is where he met and married a <b>Nevisian,</b> Frances Nisbet, the young widow of a plantation-owner.|$|E
25|$|In July 2010, Grove Park {{was renamed}} {{in honour of}} Elquemedo Willett, the first <b>Nevisian</b> {{to play for the}} West Indies. The {{renaming}} ceremony was a major event for the island, with several members of the Nevis Island Administration participating, including the Premier of Nevis, Joseph Parry. Outside of cricket, the venue has hosted football and athletics tournaments at both national and regional levels.|$|E
25|$|Modernised {{classrooms}} and better equipped schools, {{as well as}} improvements in the educational system, have contributed to a leap in academic performance on the island. The pass rate among the <b>Nevisian</b> students sitting for the Caribbean Examination Council (CXC) exams, the Cambridge General Certificate of Education Examination (GCE) and the Caribbean Advance Proficiency Examinations is now consistently {{among the highest in}} the English-speaking Caribbean.|$|E
25|$|Cricket was {{introduced}} to Nevis (and {{the other members of}} the British Leeward Islands colony) in the late 19th century. <b>Nevisians</b> had represented Saint Kitts in the Hesketh Bell Shield (later known as the Leeward Islands Tournament) from its establishment in 1913, and Grove Park was frequently used for matches in that competition after Nevis was admitted separately in 1949. The inaugural first-class match played on the ground came in January 1977, when the Leeward Islands team played its annual fixture against the Windward Islands. Another Leewards–Windwards game was hosted in March 1979, during the 1979–80 season, and the following season the ground hosted its first Shell Shield game, with the Combined Islands playing Guyana. First-class fixtures became more common after the Leewards and Windwards teams were admitted separately to the Shell Shield for the 1980–81 season. In the seasons where no four-day match was played at Grove Park, a fixture in the West Indian domestic one-day competition was generally played instead.|$|R

50|$|Under the constitution, Nevis has {{considerable}} {{autonomy and}} has an island assembly, a premier, and a deputy governor-general. Under certain specified conditions, it may secede from the federation. In accordance with its rights under the Constitution, in 1996 the Nevis Island Administration under the Concerned Citizens' Movement (CCM) of Premier Vance Amory initiated steps towards secession from the Federation, the most recent being a referendum in 1998 that failed to secure the required two-thirds majority for secession. The March 2000 election results placed Vance Armory, {{as head of the}} CCM, the leader of the country's opposition party. In the September 7, 2001 elections in Nevis for the Nevis Island Administration, the CCM won four of the five seats available, while the NRP won one. In 2003, the Nevis Island Administration again proposed secession and initiated formal constitutional procedures to hold a referendum on the issue, which was held in early 2004. While opposing secession, the Government acknowledged the constitutional rights of <b>Nevisians</b> to determine their future independence. Constitutional safeguards include freedom of speech, press, worship, movement, and association. The most recent elections in Nevis took place on July 10, 2006. Amory's CCM was defeated by the NRP of Joseph Parry, winning only two out of the five elective seats. Parry was sworn in as the third Premier of Nevis a day later.|$|R
25|$|Raphael Hugh Oswald Wallace (born 29 May 1957) is {{a former}} <b>Nevisian</b> cricketer who played several matches with the Leeward Islands in West Indian {{domestic}} cricket. From Charlestown, the island's capital and largest town, Wallace regularly represented Nevis in inter-island matches, playing from the late 1970s through to the late 1980s. A right-arm fast bowler, he made his first-class debut for the Leewards during the 1979–80 season, in the semi-annual matches against the Windward Islands. In the match, played at the Antigua Recreation Ground, Wallace took 2/33 in the Windwards' first innings, but in the second innings went wicketless, also scoring six runs without losing his wicket. He did not play any further matches at first-class level, but several seasons later played twice for the team in the limited-overs Geddes Grant/Harrison Line Trophy. Wallace took a single wicket in a match against Barbados in February 1984, and two wickets against the same team {{just over a year}} later, opening the bowling with Conrad Bartlette. His brother, Leon Claxton, also played representative cricket for Nevis, and his son, Philo Wallace, currently plays for <b>Nevisian</b> under-age teams.|$|E
25|$|A {{four-year}} apprenticeship programme {{followed the}} abolishment of slavery on the plantations. In {{spite of the}} continued use of the labour force, the <b>Nevisian</b> slave owners were paid over £150,000 in compensation from the British Government {{for the loss of}} property, whereas the enslaved families received nothing for 200 years of labour. One of the wealthiest planter families in Nevis, the Pinneys of Montravers Plantation, claimed £36,396 (worth close to £1,800,000 today) in compensation for the slaves on the family-owned plantations around the Caribbean.|$|E
25|$|Two famous <b>Nevisian</b> {{buildings}} {{from the}} 18th century are Hermitage Plantation, built of lignum vitae wood in 1740, the oldest surviving wooden house {{still in use}} in the Caribbean today, and the Bath Hotel, the first hotel in the Caribbean, a luxury hotel and spa built by John Huggins in 1778. The soothing waters of the hotel's hot spring and the lively social life on Nevis attracted many famous Europeans including Antigua-based Admiral Nelson, and Prince William Henry, Duke of Clarence, (future William IV of the United Kingdom), who attended balls and private parties at the Bath Hotel. Today, the building serves as government offices, {{and there are two}} outdoor hot-spring bathing spots which were specially constructed in recent years for public use.|$|E
2500|$|When the {{hospital}} in Charlestown was destroyed in a hurricane in 1899, planting of trees in the squares of Saint Kitts and refurbishing of government buildings, also in Saint Kitts, took precedence over the rebuilding of the only hospital in Nevis. After five years without any proper medical facilities, the leaders in Nevis initiated a campaign, threatening to seek independence from Saint Kitts. The British Administrator in Saint Kitts, Charles Cox, was unmoved. He stated that Nevis did not need a hospital since {{there had been no}} significant {{rise in the number of}} deaths during the time <b>Nevisians</b> had been without a hospital. Therefore, no action was needed on behalf of the government, and besides, Cox continued, the Legislative Council regarded [...] "Nevis and Anguilla as a drag on St. Kitts and would willingly see a separation". Finally, a letter of complaint to the metropolitan British Foreign Office gave result and the federal government in Saint Kitts was ordered by their superiors in London to take speedy action. The Legislative Council took another five years to consider their options. The final decision by the federal government was to not rebuild the old hospital after all, but to instead convert the old Government House in Nevis into a hospital, named Alexandra Hospital after Queen Alexandra, wife of King Edward VII. A majority of the funds assigned for {{the hospital}} could thus spent on the construction of a new official residence in Nevis.|$|R
40|$|In 2010, the {{discovery}} of a wreck identified as HMS Solebay off Nevis? southwest seacoast prompted an investigation by a graduate student from Texas A&M University and the Institute of Nautical Archaeology, in collaboration with local and international partners. Team members documented the site with standard, low-tech, nonintrusive, archaeological recording methods. Nautical archaeology in Nevis is still a nascent discipline, one that should be pursued for the importance of seaborne commerce and warfare to the island?s historical evolution within the British Empire. The island is amongst the oldest English Caribbean colonies and in the 17 th century was the richest of the Leeward Islands through slave-labored sugar plantations. Solebay?s story reveals the British naval experience during the American Revolution {{from the perspective of a}} crew manning a lower echelon warship. Built in 1763, deployed to America in 1776, and lost in the 1782 Battle of Frigate Bay, it transcended a vigorous period in British naval architecture, and technological innovations including coppered hulls and the introduction of carronades. Solebay exposes the challenges and rewards of studying this maritime heritage in Nevis. Solebay?s violent destruction and subsequent site formation, onto a volcanic seafloor in dynamic tropical waters, has largely precluded the survival of ship timbers or other organic materials. However, metal artifacts and six iron guns have been documented and the microenvironment has afforded unforeseen positive benefits. Shallow deposition and natural exposure permitted the recovery of 72 artifacts for full conservation and diagnostic analysis, complementing the archival evidence. Interpretations support the wreck?s identity and suggest resourceful adaptive wartime behaviors on the part of her crew. While Solebay remains British crown property under international sovereign immunity laws, the Nevis Historical and Conservation Society has been entrusted as the cultural steward. Conserved artifacts exhibited in the Alexander Hamilton Museum, Charlestown, Nevis, educate the public about Solebay, its story, and more importantly, the value of protecting and studying shipwrecks. This project serves <b>Nevisians</b> and the Federal government in St. Kitts as a case study for advancing underwater cultural heritage policy on this site and future discoveries...|$|R
2500|$|<b>Nevisian</b> {{culture has}} since the 17th century {{incorporated}} African, European and East Indian cultural elements, creating a distinct Afro-Caribbean culture. Several historical anthropologists have done field research Nevis and in <b>Nevisian</b> migrant communities {{in order to}} trace the creation and constitution of a <b>Nevisian</b> cultural community. Karen Fog Olwig published her research about Nevis in 1993, writing that the areas where the Afro-Caribbean traditions were especially strong and flourishing relate to kinship and subsistence farming. However, she adds, Afro-Caribbean cultural impulses were not recognised or valued in the colonial society and were therefore often expressed through Euro-Caribbean cultural forms. Examples of European forms appropriated to express Afro-Caribbean culture are the <b>Nevisian</b> and Kittitian Tea Meetings and Christmas Sports. According to anthropologist Roger D. Abrahams, these traditional performance art forms are [...] "Nevisian approximation of British performance codes, techniques, and patterns". He writes that the Tea Meetings were staged as theatrical [...] "battles between decorum and chaos", decorum represented by the ceremony chairmen and chaos the hecklers in the audience, with a diplomatic King or a Queen presiding over the battle to ensure fairness.|$|E
