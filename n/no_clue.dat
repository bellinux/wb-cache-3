5|$|For {{security}} reasons, filming {{and photography}} {{were not allowed}} near or inside the United States Bullion Depository. All sets for the interiors of the building were designed and built from scratch at Pinewood Studios. The filmmakers had <b>no</b> <b>clue</b> {{as to what the}} interior of the depository looked like, so Ken Adam's imagination provided the idea of gold stacked upon gold behind iron bars.|$|E
5|$|In September 2007, the {{historian}} Wolfram Pobanz {{declared that the}} copy of the giant globe with a bullet hole in the Berlin museum is not Hitler's, but another one that {{is thought to have}} belonged to Joachim von Ribbentrop, the Nazi foreign minister, and with <b>no</b> <b>clue</b> as to where the Globe that belonged to Hitler is today.|$|E

50|$|A {{variation}} is the Blankout puzzle in the Daily Mail Weekend magazine. The clues are not individually numbered, but given {{in terms of}} the rows and columns of the grid, which has rectangular symmetry. The list of clues gives hints of the locations of some of the shaded squares even before one starts solving them, e.g. there must be a shaded square where a row having <b>no</b> <b>clues</b> intersects a column having <b>no</b> <b>clues.</b>|$|R
50|$|On 14 August 2013, foreign {{ministry}} of Yemen claimed {{that it had}} <b>no</b> <b>clues</b> as to the whereabouts of the abducted Iranian diplomat.|$|R
5|$|The Foreign Minister's {{interpreter}} is ghost-hacked, {{presumably to}} assassinate VIPs {{in an upcoming}} meeting. Believing the perpetrator is the mysterious Puppet Master, Kusanagi's team follows the traced telephone calls that sent the virus. After a chase, they capture a garbage man and a thug. However, both are only ghost-hacked individuals with <b>no</b> <b>clue</b> about the Puppet Master. The investigation again comes to a dead end.|$|E
5|$|The {{available}} sources give <b>no</b> <b>clue</b> as to Albin's {{pattern of}} allegiance in these factional politics, {{and neither do}} his recorded activities. Professor Donald Watt has suggested that Albin was probably aligned with the Durward faction, in contrast, for instance, to the allegedly Comyn aligned Clement of Dunblane. Watt even argued that Albin's postulation was {{probably due to the}} influence of Alan Durward, who at the time was a close advisor of King Alexander II.|$|E

25|$|There are <b>no</b> <b>clues</b> {{about which}} answers might be better: {{generating}} possibilities randomly {{is just as}} good as checking them in some special order.|$|R

25|$|The above {{mathematics}} gives <b>no</b> <b>clue</b> {{whether the}} cyclostrophic rotation ends {{up to be}} clockwise or anticlockwise, meaning that the eventual arrangement {{is a consequence of}} effects not allowed for in the relationship, namely the rotation of the parent cell.|$|E
25|$|When I see fit, I shall {{come and}} claim other victims. I alone know whom they shall be. I shall leave <b>no</b> <b>clue</b> except my bloody axe, besmeared {{with blood and}} brains of he whom I have sent below to keep me company.|$|E

25|$|Unlike {{the number}} of {{complete}} Sudoku grids, {{the number of}} minimal 9×9 Sudoku puzzles is not precisely known. (A minimal puzzle {{is one in which}} <b>no</b> <b>clue</b> can be deleted without losing uniqueness of the solution.) However, statistical techniques combined with a puzzle generator show that about (with 0.065% relative error) 3.10×1037 minimal puzzles and 2.55×1025 nonessentially equivalent minimal puzzles exist.|$|E
25|$|P. R. Deltoid: A {{criminal}} rehabilitation {{social worker}} assigned {{the task of}} keeping Alex on the straight and narrow. He seemingly has <b>no</b> <b>clue</b> about dealing with young people, and is devoid of empathy or understanding for his troublesome charge. Indeed, when Alex is arrested for murdering an old woman, and then ferociously beaten by several police officers, Deltoid simply spits on him.|$|E
25|$|On 29 November 2012, {{media news}} {{reported}} that Koirala {{had been diagnosed}} with ovarian cancer.

25|$|One day driver Shephard drove a train up to Westward Ho! and on {{arriving}} back at Bideford Quay {{it was found}} that the front of his locomotive, Kingsley, was splattered with blood. This caused a great deal of concern and <b>no</b> <b>clue</b> existed as to the origin of the blood, other than some blood stained fur. On the next journey to Westward Ho! the mangled remains of a donkey was found near Abbotsham Road station. The donkey belonged to Mrs. Videls of Abbotsham, who was paid the full price of replacing the donkey.|$|E

25|$|The {{simplest}} direct routes {{begin at}} either end of the Walna Scar Road, making for the summit from the top of the pass. Ascents can be made from Seathwaite Tarn (pathless) or to the north of Goat's Hawse, but these give <b>no</b> <b>clue</b> to the grandeur of the crag on the eastern side of the ridge. For this the walker will leave the Walna Scar Road at The Cove, or climb to this point from Torver. From here Goat's Water is the next objective for a stunning view of Dow Crag. Two choices now present themselves- easy via Goat's Hause, or steep via the South Rake (see below). Many walkers will also reach the fell using the good paths from The Old Man of Coniston and Brim Fell.|$|E

5000|$|... …this a tame, nonmysterious mystery… When Harley Fitch murdered, Qwilleran doesn't {{discover}} anything, {{except for}} the spotted pasts of the deceased. Eventually, the killer attacks Qwilleran and his identity is made known; there are <b>no</b> <b>clues,</b> <b>no</b> logical way for the reader to figure out whodunit. The author's device of introducing every scene with stage directions, and her reliance on stereotypical characters, may bore ….|$|R
25|$|AGU co-published (along {{with the}} AMS and the AAG) its first {{electronic}} journal, Earth Interactions, in 1997. It started its own electronic journal, Geochemistry, Geophysics, Geosystems, in December 1999. It made a full transition to electronic publishing in 2001. For all its journals, the electronic version became {{the publication of}} record. This {{was accompanied by a}} new identification scheme for articles that entirely did away with sequential page numbers. Instead, each article had a digital object identifier (DOI). As an example, 10.1029/2001GL014304 consists of the publisher identifier (AGU), the year (2001), the journal code (GL), and an article number (014304). This new system was met with complaints from libraries and scientists. The article numbers provided <b>no</b> <b>clue</b> for libraries to find an article in printed versions, and even scientific databases were not set up to handle DOIs. AGU officials claimed that the problems were a temporary cost of being a frontrunner, but did retroactively assign each article a four-digit article number.|$|E
25|$|The {{arrangement}} of Matt Dennis's Everything Happens To Me (June Christy, vocal) {{was not done}} under Kenton's aegis but with Christy's later to be husband Bob Cooper as the leader just after the second AFM recording ban. This {{is added to the}} CD and shows the continuity of Graettinger's writing and recorded works for Capitol; the chart had originally been done for the full Kenton instrumentation but was never recorded. The small 11 piece group (to include violin and cello) provides some real insight to the inner workings of Graettinger's writing. The aesture nature of his arrangement and use of pantonality (one might call it atonality in spots) makes one wonder how June Christy is able to pick off the 9th of the F minor chord {{at the top of the}} tune; there is basically <b>no</b> <b>clue</b> given by Graettinger as to what pitch is coming for the singer (the glue that holds this together is the Bb pedal point at the bottom). Interestingly, after first stating the entire tune there is a tutti ensemble section that gives way to the 'last 'A' of the form'. Also, his harmonic transitions between sections are key in their departure from the tune compared to the established harmony while June Christy sings.|$|E
25|$|Tyndaris again bore a {{considerable}} {{part in the}} war between Sextus Pompeius and Octavian (36 BC). It {{was one of the}} points occupied and fortified by the former, when preparing for the defence of the Sicilian straits, but was taken by Agrippa after his naval victory at Mylae, and became one of his chief posts, from which he carried on offensive warfare against Pompey. Subsequently to this we hear nothing more of Tyndaris in history; but there is no doubt of its having continued to subsist throughout the period of the Roman Empire. Strabo speaks of it as one of the places on the north coast of Sicily which, in his time, still deserved the name of cities; and Pliny gives it the title of a Colonia. It is probable that it received a colony under Augustus, as we find it bearing in an inscription the titles of Colonia Augusta Tyndaritanorum. Pliny indeed mentions a great calamity which the city had sustained, when (he tells us) half of it was swallowed up by the sea, probably from an earthquake having caused the fall of part of the hill on which it stands, but we have <b>no</b> <b>clue</b> to the date of this event; The Itineraries attest the existence of Tyndaris, apparently still as {{a considerable}} place, in the fourth century.|$|E
6000|$|And {{yet there}} is not the {{slightest}} evidence of foul play. Nobody knows what happened to the carpenter. There are <b>no</b> <b>clues,</b> <b>no</b> traces. The night was calm and snowy. No seas broke on board. Without doubt the clumsy, big-footed, over-grown giant of a boy is overside and dead. The question is: did he go over of his own accord, or was he put over? ...|$|R
