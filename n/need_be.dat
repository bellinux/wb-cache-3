5|$|Allen's {{force of}} 100 was outnumbered by the pirates and also outgunned, with Alligator {{mounting}} only 12 six-pounders, {{compared to the}} pirates' 14 cannon. Despite being outnumbered, Alligator and her crew were experienced veterans, having taken the Portuguese brig Marianna Flora the year before in a bloody action. Allen was also an experienced commander who had taken command of USS Argus during her engagement with HMS Pelican in the War of 1812. Though Alligator draft was too deep to chase pirate craft inshore, if <b>need</b> <b>be,</b> she could send her cutter, gig, and launch out with boarding parties to engage the pirates.|$|E

5|$|In 1776, {{following}} {{the signing of}} the Declaration of Independence and the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War, Maryland threw off proprietary control and established a new constitution. Under this new constitution, the upper house of the General Assembly first became known as the Maryland Senate. The new body consisted of fifteen Senators appointed to five-year terms by an electoral college. The college, made up of two electors from each county and one each from the cities of Baltimore and Annapolis, was limited in its selections only by the stipulation that nine Senators <b>need</b> <b>be</b> from the western shore and six from the eastern shore.|$|E

30|$|Thus, {{characters}} {{described as}} having special <b>needs</b> <b>were</b> most frequently chosen last, indicating that special <b>needs</b> <b>is</b> an ineffective euphemism. Characters {{described as having}} special <b>needs</b> <b>were</b> chosen last even more frequently than characters described as having a disability or a certain disability, suggesting that the euphemism special needs conveys more negativity than the non-euphemized term disability or the names of specific disabilities (e.g., blind). If special <b>needs</b> <b>was</b> an effective euphemism, then we would have observed that characters described as having special <b>needs</b> <b>were</b> chosen last less often than characters described as having a disability or a certain disability.

5|$|Thigmonastic movements, {{those that}} occur in {{response}} to touch, are used as a defense in some plants.

40|$|Human <b>needs</b> <b>is</b> {{not part}} of the {{traditional}} themes of systematic theology or even of theological anthropology. � This article argues that human <b>needs</b> <b>is</b> a core concept in systematic theology even though it has not been an explicit theme of systematic theology. The concept of human <b>needs</b> <b>is</b> essentially related to the content of systematic theology. Any articulation of the doctrine of creation, covenant or salvation is underpinned by a view of what human <b>needs</b> <b>are.</b> This article shows that the question of human <b>needs</b> <b>is</b> normally related to systematic theology by referring to the task of systematic theology and the different modes of discourse found in which systematic theology gives expression to this task. This article also suggest a method by which an implicit concept of human <b>needs</b> may <b>be</b> discovered and engaged critically. This is demonstrated by analysis of two designs of theological anthropology: Karl Barth� s second part of the third volume of his Church Dogmatics and the fundamental-theological anthropology of Wolfhart Pannenberg. ...|$|R
5|$|A primary {{function}} of the FMPU was the training of combat cameramen. The units were based at nearby Page Military Academy. There were approximately 16 combat units, each made up of seven officers and between 20 and 30 enlisted men. They were trained to {{use a variety of}} photographic equipment and cameras and also received combat and weapons training. The cameramen were sent to every army air force base to document all aspects of the base's operations as well as aerial battle tactics and enemy airplane performance. Every cameraman was trained to load film into their camera under adverse conditions, and if <b>need</b> <b>be,</b> to develop it on location. Most of the aerial motion picture photography shot during World War II was filmed by Fort Roach alumni.|$|E
5|$|Life {{under the}} Japanese changed rapidly {{as many of}} the {{traditional}} structures were replaced by a military power. Aborigines who wished to improve their status looked to education rather than headhunting as the new form of power. Those who learned to work with the Japanese and follow their customs would be better suited to lead villages. The Japanese encouraged aborigines to maintain traditional costumes and selected customs that were not considered detrimental to society, but invested much time and money in efforts to eliminate traditions deemed unsavory by Japanese culture, including tattooing. By the mid-1930s as Japan's empire was reaching its zenith, the colonial government began a political socialization program designed to enforce Japanese customs, rituals and a loyal Japanese identity upon the aborigines. By the end of World War II, aborigines whose fathers had been killed in pacification campaigns were volunteering to serve in Special Units and if <b>need</b> <b>be</b> die for the Emperor of Japan. The Japanese colonial experience left an indelible mark on many older aborigines who maintained an admiration for the Japanese long after their departure in 1945.|$|E
5|$|Stephen {{attacked}} the castle in 1139, initially intending to besiege it, as {{the walls were}} considered impregnable to assault. Brien had brought in considerable supplies – contemporaries believed the castle could survive a siege for several years if <b>need</b> <b>be</b> – and Stephen changed his mind, putting up two counter-castles to contain Wallingford {{along the road to}} Bristol, before continuing west. The next year, Miles of Gloucester, possibly acting under orders from Robert of Gloucester, struck east, destroying one of the counter-castles outside Wallingford. The civil war between Stephen and Matilda rapidly descended into an attritional campaign, in which castles like Wallingford {{played a critical role in}} efforts by both sides to secure the Thames Valley. After the fall of Oxford to Stephen in 1141, Matilda fled to Wallingford, and the importance of the castle continued to grow.|$|E

40|$|Nowadays, {{teachers}} {{are regarded as}} {{key players in the}} process of identifying and catering to students’ additional support needs within mainstream primary classrooms. However, teachers’ professional judgements regarding students with special <b>needs</b> have <b>been</b> found to be contextually influenced (e. g. by school context, student population, level of achievement).

5|$|Despite its {{ceremonial}} role, the Golden Gate {{was one of}} {{the stronger}} positions along the walls of the city, withstanding several attacks during the various sieges. With the addition of transverse walls on the peribolos between the inner and outer walls, it formed a virtually separate fortress. Its military value was recognized by John VI Kantakouzenos (r. 1347–1354), who records that it was virtually impregnable, capable of holding provisions for three years and defying the whole city if <b>need</b> <b>be.</b> He repaired the marble towers and garrisoned the fort with loyal Catalan soldiers, but had to surrender it to John V Palaiologos (r. 1341–1391) when he abdicated in 1354. John V undid Kantakouzenos' repairs and left it unguarded, but in 1389–90 he too rebuilt and expanded the fortress, erecting two towers behind the gate and extending a wall some 350 m to the sea walls, thus forming a separate fortified enceinte inside the city to serve as a final refuge. In the event, John V was soon after forced to flee there from a coup led by his grandson, John VII. The fort held out successfully in the subsequent siege that lasted several months, and in which cannons were possibly employed. In 1391 however, John V was compelled to raze the fort by Sultan Bayezid I (r. 1382–1402), who otherwise threatened to blind his son Manuel, whom he held captive. Emperor John VIII Palaiologos (r. 1425–1448) attempted to rebuild it in 1434, but was thwarted by Sultan Murad II.|$|E
