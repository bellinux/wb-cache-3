25|$|On 23 February 2009, Northern Rock {{announced}} {{that they would be}} offering £14billion worth of new mortgages, over the next two years, as a part of their new business plan. This <b>new</b> <b>lending</b> was partly funded by an increase in the government loan and a reversal of previous strategy to pay the loan off as quickly as possible by actively encouraging mortgage customers to leave when their mortgage deal matured. The reason for this change was government policy to increase the availability of credit. This £14billion was to be split into £5billion in 2009 and £9billion in 2010.|$|E
500|$|While petrodollar {{recycling}} {{reduced the}} short-term recessionary {{impact of the}} 1973 oil crisis, it caused problems especially for oil-importing countries that were paying much higher prices for oil, and incurring long-term debts. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimated that the foreign debts of 100 oil-importing developing countries increased by 150% between 1973 and 1977, complicated further by a worldwide shift to floating exchange rates. Johan Witteveen, the Managing Director of the IMF, said in 1974: [...] "The international monetary system is facing its most difficult period since the 1930s." [...] The IMF administered a <b>new</b> <b>lending</b> program during 1974–1976 called the Oil Facility. Funded by oil-exporting nations and other lenders, it was available to nations suffering from acute problems with their balance of trade due to the rise in oil prices, notably including Italy and the UK as well as dozens of developing countries.|$|E

In addition, the invasion produced a <b>new</b> <b>Lend</b> lease partner in Russia, creating even greater demands on an already struggling American aircraft production.|$|R

50|$|In 1934 {{the federal}} banking system was restructured. The National Housing Act of 1934 created the Federal Housing Administration.
