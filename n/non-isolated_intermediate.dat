40|$|Benzonitrile p-nitrobenzylide (5) {{undergoes}} 1, 3 -dipolar cycloadditions in {{the presence}} of 3 -phenyl- 2 H-azirines (1), yielding in benzene at 0 ° 2 -(p-nitrophenyl) - 4, 5 -diphenyl- 1, 3 -diazabicyclo[3. 1. 0]hex- 3 -enes (7, scheme 2). Under the basic conditions of the reaction mixture, 7 a and 7 b are partially converted to 2 -(p-nitrophenyl) - 4, 5 -diphenyl- 1, 6 -dihydropyrimidines 8 a,b) which are dehydrogenated by oxygen to the corresponding pyrimidines 9 a and 9 b, respectively. 3 -Phenyl- 2 H-azirines (1) form, on heating at 145 ° in xylene {{in the presence}} of the azlactone 32 (2, 4 -diphenyl-delta 2 -oxazolin- 5 -one), 4 -(aziridin- 2 '-yl) - 2, 4 -diphenyl-delta 2 -oxazolin- 5 -ones (33, scheme 11). 33 arises from an ene reaction of the enol form of 32 with 1. Similar ene reactions are observed with the azirines 1 and dimedone (37, scheme 12). Under the ene reaction conditions (xylene, 145 °), the <b>non-isolated</b> <b>intermediate</b> primary adducts (38 a and 38 b) undergo rearrangements of the vinylcyclopropane-cyclopentene type to give 6, 6 -dimethyl- 4 -oxo- 1, 3 -diphenyl- 4, 5, 6, 7 -tetrahydroisoindole (40) and 6, 6 -dimethyl- 4 -oxo- 3 -phenyl- 4, 5, 6, 7 -tetrahydroindole (42), respectively...|$|E
50|$|A {{requirement}} is to collect, collate and submit {{data to the}} European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) on the hazardous properties of all substances (except Polymers and <b>non-isolated</b> <b>intermediates)</b> manufactured or imported into the EU in quantities above 1 tonne per year. Certain substances of high concern, such as carcinogenic, mutagenic and reproductive toxic substances (CMRs) {{will have to be}} authorised.|$|R
30|$|However, the {{registration}} processes under REACH {{do not require}} that each chemical substance in the workplace is covered and fully examined. The regulation generally exempts certain substances (e.g. <b>non-isolated</b> <b>intermediates</b> or waste) and sectors extensively regulated by other legislation (e.g. use as a biocide). Annexes IV and V of REACH list other substances excluded from registration either because this is deemed inappropriate or because sufficient information is available already.|$|R
40|$|Reaction of PhCH₂Mn(CO) ₅ with l, 4 -di-aryl- 1 -aza- 1, 3 -butadienes gave {{substituted}} pyrrolinonyl rings {{which were}} η⁴-coordinated to a Mn(CO) ₃ group. These are formed by intramolecular CO insertion into a (<b>non-isolated)</b> cyclomanganated <b>intermediate,</b> followed by cyclisation. Other unsaturated reagents (PhC≡CH, CH 2 =CHCOOMe, PhNCO) gave products arising from insertion of these, including a structurally characterised tri-aryl-η⁵-azacyclohexadienyl-Mn(CO) ₃ complex from the reaction with the alkyne. PhCH₂Mn(CO) ₅ reacts with l, 4 -di-aryl- 1 -aza- 1, 3 -butadienes {{in the presence}} of unsaturated substrates to give products based on a cyclomanganated intermediate...|$|R
