30|$|A {{widespread}} belief among {{scholars and}} connoisseurs of the Japanese color woodblock print (nishiki-e) holds that synthetic dyes were {{imported from the}} West in the 1860 s, and soon came {{to be used for}} all nishiki-e colorants during the Meiji period. These “cheap imported aniline dyes” are widely described as “gaudy”, “garish”, and “strident”, and thought to stand in sharp contrast to more muted “natural” colorants that preceded them. This study calls this narrative into question through an analysis of the colorants of nishiki-e from 1860 until 1900, using surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy coupled with micro-Raman, XRF and fiber optic reflectance spectroscopies. The results show that the introduction of synthetic dyes was gradual and selective, and that most of the customary colorants of the late Edo period continued in use. The results revealed a series of key turning points after 1860 : (1) In 1864, the purple dye rosaniline became the first synthetic dye to be used in nishiki-e, at first in combination with Prussian blue for a more bluish color. From 1875, it was usually mixed or replaced with methyl violet for a stronger purple. (2) In early 1869, a dramatic and until recently unrecognized transition took place, from the longstanding use of safflower as the dominant red, to its total replacement by imported cochineal carmine. Carmine remained the primary red for the next two decades, often combined with vermillion. (3) In 1877, eosine appeared as the first synthetic red dye in nishiki-e, used alone for pink, and in mixture with carmine for red. (4) Finally, from 1889, a succession of red <b>naphthol</b> <b>dyes</b> of more striking color appeared. Just about this time, however, a tendency to more restrained use of color and more painterly effects began to emerge in nishiki-e, and {{with the exception of a}} burst of dynamic color in prints depicting the Sino–Japanese War (1894 – 95), the uses of strong colors in Meiji prints receded. A final key finding is that colorants were often combined, either through mixture in a bowl or on the printing block, or by two-step overprinting.|$|R

30|$|It {{would not}} be until 1889, two decades into the Meiji period, that {{synthetic}} organic dyes truly worthy of such common epithets as “harsh” and “garish” appeared {{in the form of}} <b>naphthol</b> “acid red” <b>dyes</b> from 1889. As it happened, however, it was just at this time that a new tendency was emerging in nishiki-e, {{in the direction of a}}  more painterly feel, eliminating solid backgrounds and bands of gradation for a lighter, more modern touch. The new acid reds were used but in more restrained ways, as accents rather than broad swaths.|$|R

40|$|Recent {{work in this}} {{laboratory}} {{has shown}} that acetaniide is metabolized in man through two routes (1). The major one involves oxidation to N-acetyl p-aminophenol. It was suggested that the analgesic effect of the parent drug is directed mainly through this compound. A minor route of metabolism involves deacetylation to yield aniline. This compound was shown to be the precursor of the substance, probably phenylhydroxylamine, {{which is responsible for}} the formation of methemoglobin. The similarity in structure of acetophenetidin (p-ethoxy acetanilide) and acetanilide suggested that acetophenetidin might be metabolized through similar routes. Work previously reported on the fate of acetophenetidin in the body is meager and suggests that the compound is first deacetylated to p-phenetidin (p-ethoxy aniline) which is then deethylated to p-aminophenol, the latter compound being then excreted combined with sulphuric or glucuronic acid (2). The investigation described here concerns the physiological disposition and chemical fate of acetophenetidin in man and the pharmacological activity of its transformation products. CHEMICAL METHODS. Sensitive methods for the estimation of acetophenetidin and its metabolic products were required {{in the study of the}} physiological disposition of acetophene-tidin. These methods are described below. Deter-mination of acetophenetidin: In the method reported below, acetophenetidin is isolated from biological material by extraction into benzene. The benzene is evaporated and the residue taken up in acid.

Presence of sulphur, <b>naphthol,</b> vat <b>dyes,</b> nitrates, acetic acid, soaps, enzymes chromium compounds and heavy metals like copper, arsenic, lead, cad- mium, mercury, nickel, and cobalt and certain auxiliary chemicals all collectively make the textile effluent highly toxic. Other harmful chemicals present in the water may be formaldehyde based dye fixing agents, chlorinated stain removers, hydro carbon based softeners, non bio degradable dyeing chemicals. These organic materials react with many disinfectants especially chlorine and form by products (DBP’S) that are often carcinogenic and therefore undesirable. Many of these show allergic reactions. The colloidal matter present along with colors and oily scum increases the turbidity, gives the water a bad appearance and foul smell and prevents the penetration of sunlight necessary for the process of photosynthesis. This in turn interferes with the Oxygen transfer mechanism at air water interface which in turn interferes with marine life and self purification process of water. This effluent if allowed to flow in the fields’ clogs the pores of the soil resulting in loss of soil productivity. If allowed to flow in drains and rivers it effects the quality of drinking water in hand pumps making it unfit for human consumption. It is important to remove these pollutants from the waste waters before their final disposal...|$|R
30|$|The {{experiment}} conducted {{analyzed the}} color removal of both azo and nitroso dyes. Azo dyes {{are one of}} the most popular dyes present in the textile industry as these dyes represent 50  % of the total dyes present. Azo dyes contain one azo group (–N=N–). Acid Yellow 11 and Acid Orange 7 are examples of low-molecular azo dyes (Hunger 2003). Azo dyes are also anionic and very water soluble (Verma et al. 2012). Körbahti (2007) explains the degradation of both azo and nitroso dyes by means of electrochemical treatment. According to the authors, the products of azo dye degradation include carbon dioxide, nitrates, and sulfates with intermediates of aromatic esters, phenols, aromatic carboxyl acids, cyclic and aromatic hydrocarbons. On the other hand, nitroso dyes consist of o-nitrosophenols or <b>naphthols</b> used on <b>dyeing</b> animal skins and silk (Hunger 2003). Dyes from nitro and nitroso groups are usually degraded into amino groups (Körbahti 2007). It is possible that similar degradation patterns occur within electrocoagulation. Acid Yellow 11, Acid Orange 7, and Naphthol Green B were chosen because they represent a small sample of dyes within these categories. In addition, these dyes have also been decolorized using other treatment methods which allows for a comparison between the chemical coagulation addition of ECF and other treatment methods.|$|R
40|$|Dynamic {{changes in}} {{internal}} light fluence were measured during interstitial laser heating of tissue phantoms and ex vivo bovine liver. In albumen phantoms, the results demonstrate an unexpected rise in optical power transmitted approximate to 1 cm. {{away from the}} source during laser exposure at low power (0. 5 - 1 W), and a decrease at higher powers (1. 5 - 2. 5 W) due to coagulation and possibly charring. Similar trends were observed in liver tissue, with a rise in interstitial fluence observed during 0. 5 W exposure and a drop in interstitial fluence seen at higher powers (1 - 1. 5 W) due to tissue coagulation. At 1. 5 W irradiation an additional, later decrease was also seen which was most likely due to tissue charring Independent spectrophotometric studies in <b>Naphthol</b> Green <b>dye</b> indicate the rise in fluence observed in the heated albumen phantoms may have been primarily due to light exposure causing photobleaching of the absorbing chromophore, and not due to heat effects. Experiments in liver tissue demonstrated that the observed rise in fluence {{is dependent on the}} starting temperature of the tissue. Correlating changes in light fluence with key clinical endpoints/events such as the onset of tissue coagulation or charring may be useful for on-line monitoring and control of laser thermal therapy via interstitial fluence sensors.

40|$|A {{study was}} carried out on {{phosphatase}} activity, phosphate uptake {{and its relationship to}} hair formation in the Rivulariaceae. The Rivulariaceae was chosen as it is a widespread taxon, where hair formation is a common occurrence, and previous studies indicated that they originate from environments where {{a large proportion of the}} phosphorus (P) is present as organic P. It seems possible that hair-forming Rivulariaceae are especially well adapted to utilize organic P. Initially 51 axenic cyanobacterial strains, from 10 genera, were screened for yields using organic P sources and for cell-bound and extracellular phosphomonoesterase (PMEase) and phosphodiesterase (PDEase) activities. All strains exhibited detectable inducible PMEase activities, and highest cell-bound PMEase activities were in hair-forming Rivulariaceae. Synechococcus had significantly low cell-bound phosphatase activities and five strains were unable to hydrolyze phytic acid. PDEase activities were lower compared to PMEase activities in all strains. Strains isolated from deepwater rice habitats had significantly higher levels of PDEase activity. In the three Calothrix strains tested, Calothrix 202, 550 and 603, inducible phosphatase activities were similar whether the P source was inorganic or organic. PMEase synthesis in these strains began when cellular P (% dry wt) values were in the range 0. 60 - 1. 0 %. Differences in the influence of environmental variables on cell-bound and extracellular PMEase activities in hair-forming Calothrix 550 were slight, suggesting that PMEases in the two fractions had a common origin. Of the eleven ions tested Ca had the most pronounced stimulatory effect on PMEase activity. Localization of enzyme activity in Calothrix 550 suggested that the enzyme was bound to a surface. Partial purification of an extracellular PMEase fraction detected four bands of PMEase activity on a non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel. Three of the four bands were associated with carbohydrate and the bands were not extractable by mechanical means. Localization of PMEase activity in hair-forming strains by azo <b>dye</b> (<b>naphthol</b> AS-MX) and 5 -bromo- 4 -chloro- 3 -indolyl phosphate (BCIP) showed that PMEase activity was associated with hair cells. Phosphate uptake experiments with Calothrix 253 and 550 suggested that uptake at high external phosphate concentrations was located in hair cells. NaCl, above 67. 5 mM, inhibited hair formation and subsequently phosphatase activity in Calothrix 253 and 690. Addition of mannitol or sorbitol had no effect on hair formation, suggesting inhibition of hair formation was not an osmotic effect. Removal of P-deficient cultures from saline to freshwater media led to a marked synchronization of hair formation (in 90 % of trichomes) and increase in cell-bound PMEase activity. Localization of cell-bound PMEase activity by light microscopy, using naphthol AS-MX, detected activity in the hair cells...|$|R
