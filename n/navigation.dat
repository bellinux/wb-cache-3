5|$|Although the <b>navigation</b> {{ceased to}} operate from January 1869, Woodmill Lock {{remained}} in use, to enable barges to reach Gaters Mill at West End, {{which was on}} the main river channel just above {{the start of the}} first cut. Most of the bridges over the <b>navigation</b> were owned by the <b>navigation,</b> and their condition deteriorated. The manager, Mr Bulpett, was notified that he had 21 days to repair Shawford Bridge in 1879. He replied to the Winchester Highway Board that the <b>navigation</b> was insolvent, and he would help them to transfer responsibility for it to the county council. The Board carried out temporary repairs, when Bulpett agreed that the <b>navigation</b> would meet the full cost of repairing it properly if it ever reopened. The following year, Bulpett was threatened with legal action over the state of Bishopstoke Bridge, but at this point it was agreed that the <b>navigation</b> had no income, and could not be sold, and so the county would have to maintain the bridges.|$|E
5|$|Humans {{have used}} {{compasses}} for direction finding since the 11th century A.D. and for <b>navigation</b> since the 12th century. Although the magnetic declination does shift with time, this wandering is slow enough that a simple compass remains useful for <b>navigation.</b> Using magnetoception various other organisms, ranging from {{some types of}} bacteria to pigeons, use the Earth's magnetic field for orientation and <b>navigation.</b>|$|E
5|$|Kõpu Lighthouse only {{lost its}} {{important}} {{role as a}} primary <b>navigation</b> aid in 1997, when a radar lighthouse took over its duties. Recreational craft and small fishing vessels continue to rely on Kõpu for navigating, as a backup to electronic <b>navigation</b> systems. The Estonian Maritime Administration still classifies it as an active aid to <b>navigation.</b> Its future is ensured by {{its status as a}} protected cultural memorial.|$|E

5|$|On 26 May, while {{rounding}} {{the southern tip}} of Africa, Arniston separated from the convoy in bad weather after her sails were damaged. Without accurate daily longitudinal information from the other ships, Arniston had to rely instead on older, less accurate <b>navigation</b> methods. <b>Navigation</b> via dead reckoning proved particularly difficult as there were strong ocean currents combined with inclement weather that prevented a fix being obtained for several days via celestial <b>navigation.</b>|$|E

5|$|The Bridgwater and Taunton Canal {{opened in}} 1827, which {{provided}} an easier route than the river, and protracted legal battles followed over {{ownership of the}} river and water rights for the canal. These were not finally resolved until 1832, when the Canal Company formally took over the river <b>navigation.</b> The ability to navigate the river gradually deteriorated, not helped by the abandonment of the River Parrett as a <b>navigation</b> in 1878. Following flooding in Taunton in 1960, much of the river between there and its mouth was straightened, and the <b>navigation</b> locks were removed. That at Ham was blown up by the Territorial Army. <b>Navigation</b> rights were repealed in 1967.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports a}} study {{concerning}} linear and non-linear <b>navigations</b> in WBI. The {{effects of the}} two <b>navigations</b> on students’ engagement aspects namely; control, focus, curiosity, and intrinsic interests were investigated. The study aimed to identify whether the linear and the non-linear <b>navigations</b> could be {{the factors that influence}} students’ engagement while learning in WBI environment. An exploratory experimental study was conducted on seventy-two students from a university in Malaysia using a web-based system for learning Basic Computer Networks. The study suggested that the types of <b>navigations</b> had affected the control aspect, but not the focus, curiosity, and intrinsic interests. Students’ engagement from the context of focus, intrinsic interests and curiosity was similar in both linear and non-linear. These findings are further discussed from cultural perspectives of Malaysian students...|$|R

5|$|The {{autonomous}} <b>navigation</b> of the Air-Cobot robot is in two phases. The first, <b>navigation</b> in {{the airport}} or the factory, allows the robot to move close to the aircraft. The second <b>navigation,</b> around the aircraft, allows the robot to position itself at control points referenced in the aircraft virtual model. In addition, the robot must insert itself in a dynamic environment where humans and vehicles are moving. To address this problem, it has an obstacle avoidance module. Many <b>navigation</b> algorithms are constantly running on the robot with real time constraints. Searches are conducted on optimizing the computing time.|$|E

5|$|As {{early as}} 1881, {{industrialists}} proposed altering the natural channel of the Columbia to improve <b>navigation.</b> Changes {{to the river}} {{over the years have}} included the construction of jetties at the river's mouth, dredging, and the construction of canals and <b>navigation</b> locks. Today, ocean freighters can travel upriver as far as Portland and Vancouver, and barges can reach as far inland as Lewiston, Idaho.|$|E
5|$|Blackburn {{was also}} a zealous {{advocate}} for improved river <b>navigation.</b> He persuaded the legislature to apply a $100,000 allocation from the U.S. Congress to the improvement of <b>navigation</b> along the Kentucky River and gave concurrent jurisdiction over the Big Sandy and Licking Rivers {{to the federal government}} so they could be improved as well. Legislators also approved construction of a canal around the Cumberland Falls and improvements along the Tradewater River.|$|E

5|$|By 1852, {{the barge}} service to London only ran once a week, {{and it had}} ceased {{altogether}} three years later. Most vessels reaching Arundel were coasters rather than barges by 1886, and just 20 ships used the facilities that year. The Wey and Arun Canal closed in 1871. The proprietors of the upper river ceased to maintain the <b>navigation</b> from 1 January 1888, and the last barge passed through Hardham Tunnel on 29 January 1889. The river was abandoned as a <b>navigation</b> by a warrant issued {{as part of the}} Railway and Canal Traffic Act of 1888. The River Lark in Suffolk was the only other river <b>navigation</b> abandoned at that time. The Board of Trade issued a closing order in 1896, and after that, there was no <b>navigation</b> authority responsible for the upper river. However, traffic did not cease entirely.|$|E
5|$|During the 1920s and 1930s {{the only}} fully trained crews were pilots, other crew members being volunteers from skilled ground trades who {{underwent}} short courses in gunnery and bomb aiming. Pilots {{were responsible for}} <b>navigation,</b> and when accurate <b>navigation</b> was essential, a second pilot was carried. Early in 1936 the Air <b>Navigation</b> School had been formed at RAF Manston to take over this training for all pilots destined for Coastal and Bomber Commands. Conversion training for Flying Boats was also given there.|$|E
5|$|Electronic {{tactical}} air <b>navigation</b> (TACAN) {{became an}} absolute necessity in Laos, where mountain peaks and unexpected inclement weather made flying extremely hazardous, especially for older aircraft. This problem was solved by establishing unmanned Air Force stations that broadcast continuous radio transmissions, allowing aerial <b>navigation</b> from fixed geographic reference points. The Air Force also emplaced TSQ-81 radar {{sites in the}} north and northeast to direct Rolling Thunder missions over North Vietnam.|$|E
