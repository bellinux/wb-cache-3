40|$|No <b>numerical</b> <b>aberration</b> of {{chromosomes}} {{that might}} be specific for prostate cancer {{has so far been}} established. We used fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) with centromere-specific probes for chromosomes 7, 8, 17, X and Y to establish the distribution of centromere copy numbers in frozen-stored or freshly prepared samples of benign prostate hypertrophy (BPH) and to detect numerical aberrations of these chromosomes in 28 prostate cancers from Japanese men. There {{was no significant difference in}} the data of centromere copy numbers between fresh and frozen-stored tissue. The most common aberration in prostate cancers was a gain of chromosome 8 (57 %), with <b>numerical</b> <b>aberration</b> of chromosome 7 being the second most frequent anomaly (50 %). <b>Numerical</b> <b>aberration</b> of chromosome 7 is most significantly associated with a higher Gleason score (GS) (P < 0. 005) or with lymph node metastasis (P < 0. 001). <b>Numerical</b> <b>aberration</b> of several chromosomes, including chromosomes 7 and/or 8, was common in aggressive prostate cancers. Loss of chromosome Y was detected in only 4 % of cases. FISH analysis thus proved to be a useful method for detecting numerical aberrations of individual chromosomes, with application to touch preparations of frozen-stored tissue having the advantage of exact sampling of cancer foci. The results suggest that <b>numerical</b> <b>aberration</b> of chromosome 7 is associated with aggressive tumour behaviour and poor prognosis of patients with prostate cancer.

40|$|In most tumours {{including}} Oral {{squamous cell}} carcinoma (SCC), acquisition of genetic instability is an essential step during carcinogenesis that involves generalized increased rate of errors during DNA replication, and defective repair of DNA. The genomic change results in numerical and structural chromosomal alterations, particularly in chromosomes 3, 9, 11 and 17. Chromosome 17 abnormality was chosen in my study because it shown strong correlation with neoplastic development and progression. In my study, twenty Oral SCC archival blocks were selected retrospectively from two referred Malaysian oral cancer centres. Histopathological findings were prior diagnosed by experienced Oral Pathologist, then Fluorescent in-situ Hybridization (FISH) technique was conducted subsequently by using specific probe of chromosome 17 in these oral SCC cases.

Emphasis was placed on clarification of the DNA aneuploidy formation process by comparing and characterizing three types of gastric tumor: homogeneously DNA diploid tumors (DD), the diploid portion of tumors showing DNA heterogeneity (DD-H) and the aneuploid portion of tumors showing DNA heterogeneity (DA-H). DNA heterogeneity and chromosomal heterogeneity increased markedly as gastric tumor advanced from `m' (mucosal) cancer to 'sm' (submucosal) cancer in early cancer. Thus, 'sm' cancer exhibited some features of advanced cancer. When DD and DD-H, both of which are DNA diploid, were compared in terms of chromosomal <b>numerical</b> <b>aberrations,</b> the number of chromosomes 11 and 17 was significantly higher in DD-H. When DD-H and DA-H were compared, the number of chromosomes 7 and 11 was significantly higer in DD-H, while the number of chromosome 17 was approximately the same in both. Based on these results of DNA ploidy analysis of gastric cancer, the <b>numerical</b> <b>aberrations</b> of chromosomes 11 and 17 strongly suggest the presence of DNA heterogeneity even in DNA diploid cases, and DNA diploid tumors with abnormal numbers of chromosomes 11 and 17 have features similar to those of DNA aneuploid tumors.

On the basis of con-ventional cytoge; 3 etic analysis, patients with acute leukemia whose leukemic ells carried numerical chromosomal aberrations were selected and followed with repetitive DNA probes that specifically hybridize to one chromosome type. Repeated cytogenetic metaphase analyses would have been labori-ous and not sensitive or quantitative nough to follow declining numbers of aberrant cells. FISH, as an interphase cytogenetic technique, provides a rapid and simple alternative with high sensitivity. Although FISH data before and after chemotherapy were & agreement with bone marrow cytology in 30 of 38 patients, discrepancies were noticed in specific cases. These could be explained by the presence of cytogenetically distinct subclones that behave differently during treatment, he presence of differenti-ated leukemic ells, changes in the chromosomal constitution caused by clonal relapse, or the fact that a <b>numerical</b> <b>aberration</b> is found by conventional chromosome banding analysis while the target region to which the probe is directed is still present in the nucleus as a diploid set...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Chromosomal {{instability}} is a {{key feature}} in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) revealed recurring structural aberrations, whereas {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} (FISH) indicated an increasing number of <b>numerical</b> <b>aberrations</b> in dedifferentiating HCC. Therefore, we examined whether there was a correlation between structural and <b>numerical</b> <b>aberrations</b> of chromosomal instability in HCC. METHODS AND RESULTS: 27 HCC (5 well, 10 moderately, 12 lower differentiated) already cytogenetically characterized by aCGH were analyzed. FISH analysis using probes for chromosomes 1, 3, 7, 8 and 17 revealed 1. 46 - 4. 24 signals/nucleus, which correlated with the histological grade (well vs. moderately,p < 0. 0003; moderately vs. lower, p < 0. 004). The number of chromosomes to each other was stable with exceptions only seen for chromosome 8. Loss of 4 q and 13 q, respectively, were correlated with the number of aberrations detected by aCGH (p < 0. 001, p < 0. 005; Mann-Whitney test). Loss of 4 q and gain of 8 q were correlated with an increasing number of <b>numerical</b> <b>aberrations</b> detected by FISH (p < 0. 020, p < 0. 031). Loss of 8 p was correlated with the number of structural imbalances seen in aCGH (p < 0. 048), but not with the number of numerical changes seen in FISH. CONCLUSION: We found that losses of 4 q, 8 p and 13 q were closely correlated with an increasing number of aberrations detected by aCGH, whereas a loss of 4 q and a gain of 8 q were also observed in the context of polyploidization, the cytogenetic correlate of morphological dedifferentiation...|$|R

Earlier studies using small series of A 2 cases suggest that in situ hybridization (ISH) with chromosome-specific DNA probes allows for frequent detection of aneusomy 1, trisomy 7, and monosomy 10. The role of trisomy 7 in astrocytoma carcinogenesis is disputed, however, because of its presence in non-neoplastic brain tissue, as detected by karyotyping. Our objective was to investigate {{whether there was a}} correlation between chromosomal aberrations and survival in a series of 47 cases of A 2. All cases were evaluated for numerical aberrations of chromosomes 1, 7, and 10 by ISH. Chromosomal aberrations were detected in 68 % of cases of A 2.

A new human cancer cell line, HKESC- 1, was established from a primary moderately-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus from a 47 -year-old Hong Kong Chinese man. The pathological characteristics (morphology, immunohistochemical, and electron microscopic studies), the tumorigenecity in nude mice, the cytogenetic features, the DNA ploidy, and telomerase activity of the cell line were investigated. The HKESC- 1 cells have been maintained continuously in vitro for more than 16 months and passaged over 96 times. HKESC- 1 cells grow as a monolayer, with a doubling time of 46 hours. The HKESC- 1 cells are of a squamous epithelial origin, as shown by their immunopositivity with the anti-cytokeratin antibodies and ultrastructural demonstration of tonofilaments and desmosomes. The HKESC- 1 cells possess characteristics of malignancy because they are highly tumorigenic in nude mice and have strong telomerase activity. The HKESC- 1 cells had an aneuploid DNA content, as demonstrated by flow cytometric analysis. Cytogenetic analysis revealed hyperdiploidy of greater than 50 in 80 % of analyzable metaphases. Chromosome gains and losses were common, and loss of the Y chromosome was a consistent <b>numerical</b> <b>aberration.</b> Additionally, many structural chromosomal abnormalities were encountered, with frequent breakpoints at 1 p 32, 7 p 22, 7 q 34, and 20 q 13.

Structural aberrations involving chromosomes 1, 2, 3, 6, 9 - 12, 13, 14, 15, 21, and 22 were detected in all of seven cultures in a blind study. Flow karyotypes proved to be insensitive to small, normally occurring chromosome polymorphisms detected by banding analysis. In addition, a few samples were erroneously scored as having <b>numerical</b> <b>aberrations...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{importance}} of chromosomal aberrations as a proximate cause of bone marrow toxicity is discussed. Since chemicals {{that can cause}} nondisjunction are rare, <b>numerical</b> <b>aberrations</b> (aneuploidy, polyploidy) are not ordinarily important. Many structural aberrations, however, can lead directly to cell death and so are proximate causes of toxicity when they occur. The micronucleus test which utilizes the polychromatic erythrocyte is capable of detecting agents (clastogens) that can cause such structural aberrations. Many carcinogens can be detected by this test, and recent changes in the protocol may increase the success rate. Nevertheless only {{a small proportion of}} chemicals are clastogens. The {{importance of}} cell division in the expression of chromosomal damage and the stage of the cell cycle at the time of exposure on the amount of damage is emphasized. A speculative mechanism for the relationship between chromosomal aberrations and carcinogenicity is proposed. There are two broad classes of chromosomal aberrations: <b>numerical</b> <b>aberrations</b> in which whole chromosomes are either lost or added, (e. g. trisomy- 21 or Down's syndrome) and structural aberrations in which pieces of chromosome are lost, added, or translocated, for example the Philadelphia chromosome which leads to chronic myeloid leukemia. Obviously either class of aberration, if inherited, can have a significant influence on human health. These aberrations arise in fundamentally different ways. Aneuploidy, i. e., <b>numerical</b> <b>aberrations</b> involving other than a full complement of chromosomes, arise as a result of nondisjunction which is a failure of the proper distribution of chromosomes to daughter cells. Agents that interact directly with the cell's spindle mechanism are able to cause nondisjunction; there are also scattered reports which suggest that other agents may also be able to cause nondisjunction, perhaps by some indirect mechanism. Similarly, inhibition of the cell's spindle formation can lead to polyploidy, i. e., the gain or loss of whole haploid sets of chromosomes. In most tissues polyploid and aneuploid cells are rar...|$|R
40|$|A {{new type}} of {{adaptive}} optics (AO) based {{on the principles of}} digital holography (DH) is proposed and developed for the use in wide-field and confocal retinal imaging. Digital holographic adaptive optics (DHAO) dispenses with the wavefront sensor and wavefront corrector of the conventional AO system. DH is an emergent imaging technology that gives direct numerical access to the phase of the optical field, thus allowing precise control and manipulation of the optical field. Incorporation of DH in an ophthalmic imaging system can lead to versatile imaging capabilities at substantially reduced complexity and cost of the instrument. A typical conventional AO system includes several critical hardware pieces: spatial light modulator, lenslet array, and a second CCD camera in addition to the camera for imaging. The proposed DHAO system replaces these hardware components with numerical processing for wavefront measurement and compensation of aberration through the principles of DH. We first design an image plane DHAO system which is basically simulating the process the conventional AO system and replacing the hardware pieces and complicated control procedures by DH and related numerical processing. In this original DHAO system, CCD is put at the image plane of the pupil plane of the eye lens. The image of the aberration is obtained by a digital hologram or guide star hologram. The full optical field is captured by a second digital hologram. Because CCD is not at the conjugate plane of the sample, a numerical propagation is necessary to find the image of the sample after the <b>numerical</b> <b>aberration</b> compensation at the CCD plane. The theory, simulations and experiments using an eye model have clearly demonstrated the effectiveness of the DHAO. This original DHAO system is described in Chapter 2. Different from the conventional AO system, DHAO is a coherent imaging modality which gives more access to the optical field and allows more freedom in the optical system design. In fact, CCD {{does not have to be}} put at the image plane of the CCD. This idea was first explored by testing a Fourier transform DHAO system (FTDHAO). In the FTDHAO, the CCD can directly record the amplitude point spread function (PSF) of the system, making it easier to determine the correct guide star hologram. CCD is also at the image plane of the target. The signal becomes stronger than the image plane DHAO system, especially for the phase aberration sensing. Also, the numerical propagation is not necessary. In the FTDHAO imaging system, the phase aberration at the eye pupil can be retrieved by an inverse Fourier transform (FT) of the guide star hologram and the complex amplitude of the full field optical field at the eye pupil can be obtained by an inverse FT of the full field hologram. The correction takes place at the eye pupil, instead of the CCD plane. Taking FT of the corrected field at the eye pupil, the corrected image can be obtained. The theory, simulations, and experiments on FTDHAO are detailed in chapter 3. The successful demonstration of FTDHAO encourages us to test the feasibility of putting CCD at an arbitrary diffraction plane in the DHAO system. Through theoretical formulation by use of paraxial optical theory, we developed a correction method by correlation for the general optical system to perform the DHAO. In this method, a global quadratic phase term has to be removed before the correction operation. In the formulation, it is quite surprising to find that the defocus term can be eliminated in the correlation operation. The detailed formulations, related simulations, and experimental demonstrations are presented in Chapter 4. To apply the DHAO to the confocal retinal imaging system, we first transformed the conventional line-scanning confocal imaging system into a digital form. That means each line scan is turned into a digital hologram. The complex amplitude of the optical field from each slice of the sample and aberration of the optical system can be retrieved by digital holographic process. In Chapter 5, we report our experiments on this digital line-scanning confocal imaging system. This digital line-scanning confocal image absorbs the merits of the conventional line-scanning confocal imaging system and DH. High-contrast intensity images with low coherent noise, and the optical sectioning capability are made available due to the confocality. Phase profiles of the samples become accessible thanks to DH. The quantitative phase map is even better than that from the wide field DH. We then explore the possibility of applying DHAO to this newly developed digital line-scanning confocal imaging system. Since optical field of each line scan can be achieved by the DH, the aberration contained in this field can be eliminated if we are able to obtain the phase aberration. We have demonstrated that the phase aberration can be obtained by a guide star hologram in the wide field DHAO systems. We then apply this technique to acquire the aberration at the eye pupil, remove this aberration from the optical fields of the line scans and recover the confocal image. To circumvent the effect of phase aberration on the line illumination, a small collimated laser beam is shone on the cylindrical lens. Thus the image is solely blurred by the second passage through the aberrator. This way, we can clearly demonstrate the effect of DHAO on the digital line-scanning confocal image system. Simulations and experiments are presented in chapter 6, which clearly demonstrates the validity of this idea. Since line-scanning confocal imaging system using spatially coherent light sources has proven an effective imaging tool for retinal imaging, the presented digital adaptive optics line-scanning confocal imaging system is quite promising to become a compact digital adaptive optics laser scanning confocal ophthalmoscope...|$|E

The aim of our {{study was to investigate}} whether <b>numerical</b> chromo-somal <b>aberrations</b> were reflected in estrogen/progesterone receptor (PgR) status and staining pattern. Fine-needle aspirates from 51 breast carcinomas were investigated immunocytochemically for ER/PgR and by in situ hybridization technique using digoxigenin-labeled a-satellite probe for chromosome 6. Cases with $ 70 % two-signal nuclei were regarded as disome; the remaining tumors showed aneusomy with a variable number of signals. Aneusomy was found in 32 tumors (63 %), whereas 19 (37 %) had a normal number of chromosome 6. Chromosomal gain occurred in all aneusome cases except one. ER- and/or PgR-positive tumors had an equal distribution of disomy and aneusmy.

40|$|Many human {{malignant}} tumours exhibit abnormal chromosomal segregation at cell division. It {{is believed}} that these anomalies {{play a role in}} tumorigenesis by increasing the rate of chromosome mutations, including deletion and amplification of genes involved in cellular proliferation and/or survival. In vitro experiments have also shown that mitotic instability may be a mechanism for developing resistance to cytotoxic drugs. Abnormal mitotic mechanisms may result in <b>numerical</b> or structural <b>aberrations</b> in the daughter cells. <b>Numerical</b> <b>aberrations</b> can be caused either by the loss of chromosomes at metaphase/anaphase or by multipolar divisions associated with abnormal number or structure of centrosomes. Structural rearrangements have been associated with chromosomal breakage-fusion-bridge (BFB) cycles that can be initiated by telomeric dysfunction, giving rise to unstable dicentric or ring chromosomes. In most tumours exhibiting chromosomal instability, including high-grade malignant pancreatic, ovarian, and head- and neck carcinomas, as well as osteo- and soft tissue sarcomas, the two types of instability occur together. However, in some low-grade mesenchymal and neuroglial tumours, rarely showing numerical changes, BFB events involving telomeric associations and ring chromosomes dominate the mitotic process. At progression towards higher malignancy in these tumours, complex structural and <b>numerical</b> <b>aberrations</b> become more frequent. This may be explained by a process initiated by telomeric dysfunction and anaphase bridging, which, in turn, may give rise to an increased frequency of multinucleated cells through failure of cytokinesis. These cells will contain an abnormal number of centrosomes leading to multipolar mitotic figures at the next cell division. Further understanding of these events may lead to novel strategies for detection and treatment of malignancy...|$|R

Seven cases of complex unbalanced aberrations that could not be identified reliably by conventional cytogenetics were successfully resolved by CGH analysis. CGH results were validated by using FISH with chromosome-specific probes. Four cases representing common prenatal <b>numerical</b> <b>aberrations</b> (trisomy 21, 18, and 13 and monosomy X) were also successfully diagnosed by CGH. We conclude that CGH is a powerful adjunct to traditional cytogenetic techniques that makes it possible to solve clinical cases of intricate unbalanced aberrations in a single hybridization. CGH may also be a useful adjunct to screen for euchromatic involvement in marker chromosomes. Further technical development may render CGH applicable for routine aberration screening...|$|R
