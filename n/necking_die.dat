40|$|Abstract: By using {{finite element}} method, {{the causes of}} forming defects such as {{shortage}} of material and punching recess thickened during drill pipe joints forging were studied and some solutions were put forward. According to the numerical simulation results, one forming defect named shortage of material caused by the metal irregular flow {{at the bottom of}} <b>necking</b> <b>die,</b> which can be resolved by reducing the die forming-angle and increasing the width of the punch. On the condition with D 0 /d 0 ≤ 2. 6 （D 0 refers to outer diameter, d 0 refers to inner diameter）, necking process can be completed with one-step backward extrusion. The thicker punching recess is formed by the accumulated metal which was scraped by the punch during necking extrusion. This kind of defect can not be eliminated, but can be minimized by improving friction conditions...|$|E

2500|$|There {{are also}} some {{specialty}} dies worth mentioning. [...] Bump dies are designed to move the shoulder of a bottleneck case back just a bit to facilitate chambering. [...] These are frequently {{used in conjunction with}} <b>neck</b> <b>dies,</b> as the bump die itself does not manipulate the neck of the case whatsoever. A bump die can be a very useful tool to anyone who owns a fine shooting rifle with a chamber that is cut to minimum headspace dimensions, as the die allows the case to be fitted to this unique chamber. Another die is the [...] "hand die". [...] A hand die has no threads and is operated—as the name suggests—by hand or by use of a hand-operated arbor press. [...] Hand dies are available for most popular cartridges, and although available as full-length resizing dies, they are most commonly seen as <b>neck</b> sizing <b>dies.</b> [...] These use an interchangeable insert to size the neck, and these inserts come in 1/1000-inch steps so that the user can custom fit the neck of the case to his own chamber or have greater control over neck tension on the bullet.|$|R
2500|$|Full {{length and}} <b>neck</b> sizing <b>dies</b> are {{available}} from RCBS and Redding. A full length die set is available from Hornady Manufacturing. Most two-die set includes a bullet seating die and either a full length resizing <b>die</b> or a <b>neck</b> sizing <b>die.</b> A full length sizing die reforms the complete body of the case to specification. The <b>neck</b> sizing <b>die</b> reforms only the neck {{so that it can}} hold the bullet in place. Neck-sizing cases rather than full length sizing cases can extend the case life of cartridges. On the downside, cases that are only neck sized may not feed through some actions reliably especially when used in semi-automatic rifles. Cartridges which are intended for semi-automatics should be full length resized. Most Weatherby manufactured rifle chambers are machined to very tight tolerances making [...] full length resizing has little effect on extending the case life as the cartridge brass {{does not have to be}} worked as much to reform it. If once fired cases are to be used in a rifle in other than one it which it had been previously fired full length resizing the cases is the norm.|$|R
