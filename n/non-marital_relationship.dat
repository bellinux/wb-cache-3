Therefore, significance of legalization of illegitimate children regarding improvement of their legal status is accentuated. As <b>non-marital</b> <b>relationships</b> were condemned in patriarchal Montenegrin 19 th century society, illegitimate children were considered a product of sin and family disgrace. Hence, legislative attempts to protect their interests and improve their legal position are emphasized in this paper...|$|R

40|$|Traditional marriages {{have been}} {{replaced}} in the last decades with {{a new form of}} a relationship ? cohabitation. Most of young people postpone marriages until they have a child and some of them even {{want to live in a}} <b>non-marital</b> <b>relationship</b> for a longer time. The aim of my bachelor thesis is to compare marriage and cohabitation from the point of view of two different generations. Next, I aimed to find out whether young people consider marriage to be only an institution or a traditionally respected union of two people who choose their partners for their whole lives. The theoretical part focuses on the topic family and its functions and describes marriage and cohabitation in the historical context. The thesis presents changes which have occurred in relationships and motives for choosing marriage or cohabitation. In addition, it describes features, relations and differences between both forms of these partnerships. The practical part compares views of two generations on marriage and cohabitation. The research was conducted in the form of piloting, specifically by using the quantitative research; in this case the survey questionnaire. The research sample was formed by two different generations ? 18 - 25 years old (young generation) and 60 - 67 years old (old generation). The thesis determines two hypotheses which both of them were confirmed. The results prove that young people plan to get married after they have a child. They first want to try living in a <b>non-marital</b> <b>relationship</b> and get married later. Furthermore, the young generation prefers cohabitation to marriage since marriage symbolizes for them confirmation of a partner for their whole lives. In addition, they understand marriage as a legally recognized union of two people. On the contrary, the older generation prefers marriage and is convinced that a child should be born inside marriage. They do not condemn cohabitation; they tolerate this form as a kind of a trial...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} the causal link between parental <b>non-marital</b> <b>relationship</b> dissolution {{and the health}} status of young children. Using {{a representative sample of}} children all born out of wedlock drawn from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study, we investigate whether separation between unmarried biological parents has a causal effect on a child’s likelihood of developing asthma. Adopting a potential outcome framework to account for selection of relationship dissolution, we find that children whose parents separate within three years after childbirth are seven percent more likely to develop asthma by age three, compared to if their parents had remained romantically involved. We provide evidence that socioeconomically disadvantaged fathers are more likely to see the relationship with their child’s mother end, and selection into relationship dissolution along these dimensions helps explain the poorer health outcomes found among out-of-wedlock children whose parents separate.

40|$|This {{study focused}} on the {{position}} of Libyan law, Islamic law and the United Nations on illegitimate children {{in terms of their}} rights as stated in the Libyan Law of personal status {{as well as in the}} international conventions. The researcher has tried to state the civil and social rights related to illegitimate children. This research also tried to identify the comprehensiveness of the United Nations in covering these rights. The issue of illegitimate children has social, economic and educational dimensions, besides the negligence of Libyan law in implying special articles for this category of children. The purpose of this research is to identify the illegitimate children from the perspective of Libyan law and determine the rights of illegitimate children in the scope of the personal status law as well as the civil and social legislation. The research approach adopted in this dissertation is the documentary research where the data is obtained from books. The findings from this research provide evidence that: 1. the personal status of Libyan law prohibits <b>non-marital</b> <b>relationship</b> between men and women, and wasting the lineage certainty of the illegitimate children. 2. Proven paternity of a father is not subjected to any time restrictions on the contrary, the denial of lineage is encompassed by restrictions and timelines to ensure proven lineage. 3. The researcher noticed through this study the existence of legislative vacuum and the lack of clarity in the legislations that governing the status of illegitimate children. 4. there is a difference in the Libyan judiciary provisions on the subject of recognition of lineage of an illegitimate child, and failure to follow the rules laid down by the Supreme Court in Libya during the interpretation of the law provisions No. 10 / 84 with respect to recognition of lineage. 5. Libyan legislature has made the abortion of the illegitimate fetus for the purpose of saving the descent as a reduced sentence, and gave this right to the mother and kin, with no specification of the kinship degree. 6. The Libyan legislature has organized the provisions of designation of illegitimate children, and acknowledged their right to get full name, and get all the necessary documents. 7. Regarding the acquisition of nationality by birth, it is subjected to the proven lineage of the child’s parents or mother only. 8. No inheritance between an illegitimate child and his father, and the disposition of commandment is religiously permissible. 9. Many families who wish to adopt a child start to abstain if they discover the illegitimacy of the child. 10.

40|$|Abstract Guided by {{evolutionary}} psychology and a situa-tional perspective on violence, we generated three hypoth-eses {{to investigate whether}} the percentage of intimate partner homicides by beating, a hands-on homicide method, varies with the victim-offender relationship. We tested these hypotheses with a national database that includes incident-level information on over 50, 000 intimate partner homi-cides. Results indicate that: (1) {{men are more likely}} than women to kill a partner by beating, and (2) men are more likely to kill their partners by beating when the relationship is dating or non-marital cohabiting (versus legal marriage). We argue that the lack of commitment in these <b>non-marital</b> <b>relationships</b> may produce greater jealousy in men, driving the perpetrator to kill his victim in a more violent manner (i. e., beating), relative to men who kill their wives...|$|R
40|$|This study {{assesses the}} {{correlation}} between the provision of child maintenance and father child relationship which ultimately affects child wellbeing. Using a mixed method approach, court records were examined over a five year period and interviews with thirty fathers were conducted. The data reveal that the majority of fathers were in <b>non-marital</b> <b>relationships,</b> pointing to the vulnerability of children born within such unions especially when family finances are scarce. Perceptions on the father child relationship were sought from fathers on their relationship with their children. The study found that fathers understood their financial responsibilities to their children and yearned for improved relationships with their offspring but their economic situation, relationships with the mother of the child, geographic proximity, family of origin and the court system hindered these relationships. Options to consider when fathers cannot meet their financial commitment have been proposed...|$|R

40|$|Educated {{women in}} {{southern}} Cameroon both condemn abortion and practice {{it with some}} regularity. This apparent paradox arises because educated Cameroonian women use abortion {{as one of a}} set of strategies to manage the timing and social context of entry into motherhood. This paper is based on a body of research which included a demographic life history survey (N= 184), open-ended narrative interviews (N= 37), and participant observation over 10 months. The survey data included 61 reported abortions, giving a lower-bound estimate of the crude abortion rate of 19 per thousand woman-years of life. In southern Cameroon, sexual activity is socially tolerated {{in a wide variety of}} <b>non-marital</b> <b>relationships,</b> while childbearing is not. Thus, most of my informants, including those who reported having aborted, say that abortion is shameful; however, they view its moral and social consequences as less grave than those of a severely mistimed entry into socially recognized motherhood. That is, abortion persists in southern Cameroon because it is the lesser shame. Abortion Reproductive health Cameroon Attitudes Honor...|$|R
5000|$|Adoption and child-visitation protections {{were also}} in question. While North Carolina only allows {{adoption}} by one unmarried adult, there are cases where children are adopted by two unmarried adults (including same-sex couples) in other states and are now living in North Carolina. Since those relationships {{would not have been}} recognized under Amendment One, there were potentially serious consequences. In Potential Legal Impacts of the Proposed Same Sex Marriage Amendment, the authors concluded that in child-custody disputes [...] "judges may interpret one as an expression of public policy against all <b>non-marital</b> <b>relationships.</b> This interpretation may have caused judges to view such relationships as having a per se negative impact on a child, and fashion custody orders accordingly. They also said that in custody disputes between a parent and non-parent, the courts could decide that one parent's relationship is impermissible since it would validate a domestic legal union other than heterosexual marriage. As with the other protections in question it seemed that the courts would have to decide what the actual interpretation and implementation will be in this area.|$|R
