40|$|<b>Nosocomial</b> (hospital-acquired) <b>infections</b> {{are a major}} {{complication}} of serious illnesses. Severely ill patients have {{a greater risk of}} acquiring <b>nosocomial</b> <b>infections,</b> so this problem is greatest in intensive care units. Studies have demonstrated that <b>nosocomial</b> <b>infections</b> are largely preventable. Adherence to recommended techniques for patient care will have the greatest benefit in the intensive care unit. In this paper the background epidemiology of <b>nosocomial</b> <b>infections</b> is reviewed and related to pediatrics and intensive care units. Types of diseases, assistance equipment, and monitoring devices which are associated with a high risk of <b>nosocomial</b> <b>infections</b> are emphasized and specific steps for lowering this risk are listed...|$|R

The Study on the Efficacy of <b>Nosocomial</b> <b>Infection</b> Control (SENIC) project by the U.S. CDC found in the 1970s that hospitals reduced their <b>nosocomial</b> <b>infection</b> rates by approximately 32 per cent by focusing on surveillance activities and prevention efforts.|$|E

40|$|<b>Nosocomial</b> <b>infections</b> {{are a major}} {{challenge}} for modern medicine and contribute to increased resource use in health care systems. The first hospital-wide prevalence survey of <b>nosocomial</b> <b>infections</b> was conducted at the University of Geneva Hospitals in 1994. At {{the time of the}} study, 16. 9 % of admitted patients had <b>nosocomial</b> <b>infections</b> (168 / 994). Leading infection sites were: urinary tract (30 %), respiratory tract (17 %), surgical wounds (12 %) and bloodstream (9. 6 %). Rates of infection varied between hospital wards: intensive care (21 %), surgery (19 %), rehabilitation (18 %), internal medicine (13 %). However, the distribution of <b>nosocomial</b> <b>infections</b> varied according to surveillance and attribution rules. Optimal detection of <b>nosocomial</b> <b>infections</b> requires ward surveillance, including revision of microbiology, nursing (Kardex) and medical records; the combination of fever above 38 degrees C, prescription of antimicrobial agent(s), and positive microbiological records suggested the diagnosis of <b>nosocomial</b> <b>infections</b> in 95 % of situations. Priorities for infection control were derived from these results...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. <b>Nosocomial</b> <b>infections</b> {{occur in}} 5 – 20 % of hospitalized patients. Officially, from 50 to 60 {{thousand}} cases of <b>nosocomial</b> <b>infections</b> are annually {{reported in the}} Russian Federation. The rapid development of invasive medical techniques, inappropriate use of antibiotics, instability of the sanitary-epidemiological, socio-economic, sociopolitical and socio-demographic situations could be considered as prerequisites for the increasing of many infectious diseases, including <b>nosocomial</b> <b>infections.</b> The detailed epidemiological analysis of <b>nosocomial</b> <b>infections</b> incidence at regional level provides the most complete picture of epidemiological situation and determines the tactics of surveillance and infection control. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate long-term dynamics of <b>nosocomial</b> <b>infections</b> incidence in the Republic of North Ossetia-Alania.

40|$|<b>Nosocomial</b> <b>infections</b> {{which are}} {{considered}} {{as the primary}} indicator {{of the quality of}} care in hospitals, cause to prolong hospitalization at intensive care unit and hospital, increase morbidity, mortality, and the cost of treatment. Although only 5 - 10 % of the patients are treated in the intensive care units, 20 - 25 % of all <b>nosocomial</b> <b>infections</b> are seen in these units. Preventing <b>nosocomial</b> <b>infections</b> in intensive care units is a process started at the patient acceptance to unit that requires an interdisciplinary team approach of intensive care staffs’ and Infection Control Committee members. Intensive care nurses who are in constant contact with patients have important responsibilities in preventing <b>nosocomial</b> <b>infections.</b> Intensive care nurses should be aware that the <b>nosocomial</b> <b>infections</b> can be prevented. They should have current knowledge about universal precautions related to prevention and control of infections, which are accepted by the entire world and they reinforce this knowledge by practice and should provide the most effective care to patients. In this article, nursing practices for prevention of <b>nosocomial</b> <b>infections</b> in intensive care units are discussed based on universal precautions...|$|R

50|$|Controlling <b>nosocomial</b> <b>infection</b> is to {{implement}} QA/QC measures {{to the health}} care sectors, and evidence-based management can be a feasible approach.

40|$|Aims: <b>Nosocomial</b> <b>infections</b> {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} problems in health care centers and intensive care unit patients. Developing evidence based guidelines for the prevention of <b>nosocomial</b> <b>infections</b> can have a great impact in reducing these infections. The aim of this study was to develop and validate the evidence based guidelines for prevention of <b>nosocomial</b> <b>infections</b> in the intensive care units. Methods: This developmental study method was performed in the intensive care unit. The quality of 32 guidelines was assessed with the valid and reliable check list. Then Evidence based new guidelines based on Stetler model were designed for prevention of <b>nosocomial</b> <b>infections.</b> The quality of designing guidelines was assessed with the same check List. Data analysis was performed using descriptive statistic and SPSS 17. Results: The quality of 32 available guidelines was poor (84. 37 %) and the quality of 15. 63 % was moderate. Eighteen <b>nosocomial</b> <b>infections</b> preventive guidelines were designed that 100 % of them had good quality. Conclusions: Given the importance prevention of <b>nosocomial</b> <b>infections</b> and since the quality of available guidelines are not good; evidence-based guidelines can reduce the risk of infection in patients.
