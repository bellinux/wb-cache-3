40|$|As {{entities}} {{where the}} production process takes place, <b>non</b> <b>financial</b> <b>corporations</b> deserve full attention {{in the analysis of}} the real and financial accounts. However, the examination of the financial behaviour of <b>non</b> <b>financial</b> <b>corporations</b> is traditionally confined to their financing : thus, the Bank’s annual report generally only considers their liabilities. Yet the formation of financial assets by <b>non</b> <b>financial</b> <b>corporations</b> is a significant item of information, in both statistical and economic terms. The total financial assets held by <b>non</b> <b>financial</b> <b>corporations</b> in Belgium are considerable, as they far exceed the total financial assets of households. A study recently revealed the historically high level of financial asset formation by <b>non</b> <b>financial</b> <b>corporations</b> in the main industrialised countries, a factor which could help to explain the relatively low level of long-term interest rates. In recent years, Belgian <b>non</b> <b>financial</b> <b>corporations</b> have formed substantially more financial assets than their counterparts in the euro area. In 2005, the financial assets held by Belgian companies were – partly for that reason – almost double the financial assets, expressed in percentages of GDP, of <b>non</b> <b>financial</b> <b>corporations</b> in the euro area. However, this situation certainly does not indicate any risk aversion on the part of Belgian <b>non</b> <b>financial</b> <b>corporations.</b> In fact the liabilities side of their balance sheets also records growth of new financial liabilities in excess of the figure for <b>non</b> <b>financial</b> <b>corporations</b> in the euro area, so that – in terms of liabilities, too – the outstanding total in Belgium is comparatively much higher than the outstanding total in the euro area. This paradoxical situation of Belgian <b>non</b> <b>financial</b> <b>corporations</b> – the fact that they hold much more substantial assets {{while at the same time}} contracting significantly greater liabilities – is due to the fact that the Belgian <b>non</b> <b>financial</b> <b>corporations</b> sector includes coordination centres and non financial holding companies, i. e. undertakings acting, as it were, as financial intermediaries. If the coordination centres and non financial holding companies are excluded, the overall outstanding total gross assets and liabilities of Belgian <b>non</b> <b>financial</b> <b>corporations</b> reverts to a level very close to the figure for the euro area. Finally, in 2005 Belgian non financial institutions recorded an outstanding total of net liabilities amounting to around 100 p. c. of GDP, i. e. slightly more than the outstanding total for <b>non</b> <b>financial</b> <b>corporations</b> in the euro area. It is also apparent that the exclusion of the coordination centres and non financial holding companies has hardly any effect on Belgium’s net debtor position, confirming that these two types of institutions perform an intermediary function. Although it is not possible to isolate the coordination centres and non financial holding companies in the case of new transactions (flows), there is no reason to think that the effect would be any different : there would be a significant decline in the gross flows of new assets and liabilities, but that would have a negligible influence on the financial balance. That balance is very similar to the one for the euro area. flow of funds, corporate finance...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{analyses}} {{the main}} {{differences in the}} financial structure of Italian and European <b>non</b> <b>financial</b> <b>corporations</b> in the 2004 - 2007 period, that is during the years before the financial crisis. The research is based on individual balance sheets of Amadeus (Analyse Major Databases from European Sources) database, which allow to isolate {{the effects of the}} different sectional and dimensional composition on the differences of the balance sheets ratios and to identify the more fragile firms. Italian <b>non</b> <b>financial</b> <b>corporations</b> present many factors of weakness compared to European ones. Firstly they are characterised by a lower operating income, even if in the period under analysis they obtained a slightly higher increase in turnover. Secondly a high indebtedness, with respect both to turnover and to risk capital, gives rise to a bigger impact of interest payments. Moreover the weight of short-term debt for Italian firms is higher and the availability of liquid assets is lower. Finally the percentage of commercial debt on assets is quite high. Taking all into account, the financial fragility is confirmed by the higher share of Italian firms which are vulnerable compared to European average. profitability, indebtedness, financial structure...|$|E

Specifically it focused on identifying available <b>non</b> <b>financial</b> motivation, assessment of the socioeconomic cost of <b>non</b> <b>financial</b> motivation and suggesting alternative strategies in applying the <b>non</b> <b>financial</b> motivation. The study employed qualitative approach and case study design in which data were generated by using in–depth interviews, focus group discussions, documentary analysis and field observation [...] The study used an analytical framework to explain the relationship between <b>non</b> <b>financial</b> motivation and the challenges of applying it. The findings from the study revealed that {{despite the fact that}} Tanzania Police Force (TPF) has indicated different types of <b>non</b> <b>financial</b> motivation, but has challenges to apply them effectively to employees. Besides, there is no transparency, especially with regard to promotion and recognition. Based on these findings, the study concludes that TPF has not shown any effort of doing away challenges and establishing best principles of applying <b>non</b> <b>financial</b> motivation to its employees. The study recommends that proper application of <b>non</b> <b>financial</b> motivation can be achieved by participating the entire workforce on recognition through meeting and seminars to avoid complaints. Also the challenges of the application of <b>non</b> <b>financial</b> motivation can only be reduced by avoiding favouratism during the time of choosing an employee to be motivated...|$|R

40|$|Each year, the National Bank {{examines}} the situation regarding the annual accounts of Belgian non-financial corporations. By that time, the Central Balance Sheet Office has already collected a representative number of annual {{accounts for the}} preceding year. The article is in three parts. The first part describes the methodology used and the sample. The second part studies the main developments in the profit and loss account. Finally, the third part contains a financial analysis of Belgian companies; this analysis is supplemented by {{the interpretation of the}} results of the failure prediction model developed by the Bank. In 2005, the total value added created by Belgian <b>non</b> <b>financial</b> <b>corporations</b> increased by 4 p. c., constituting a slowdown in comparison with 2004. At the same time, the operating costs (mainly personnel costs and depreciation) grew by 2. 8 p. c. So, for the third year in a row, value added growth greatly exceeded the rise in operating costs. As a result, the net operating profit increased by 8. 4 p. c., after having already produced an exceptional increase in 2003 and 2004. In three years, the operating profit gained 12 billion euro or 70 p. c. After taking into account the other elements of the results, and particularly the financial and exceptional results, <b>non</b> <b>financial</b> <b>corporations</b> made a net profit after tax of 41 billion euro, representing a strong increase in comparison with 2004. Return on equity increased significantly in 2005 in the largest companies. The slight decline in the leverage effect had a positive influence on financial independence and, due to historically low interest rates, the associated charges continued to fall. The net working capital of large companies and SMEs went up, while the working capital needs of the former tend to exceed their net working capital. Investments caught up in 2005 in the major companies, mainly in the non manufacturing sector, but in terms of the median value there was a slight decline, linked to lower use of production capacity. Rising amounts invested in R&D were concentrated on a smaller number of companies. As far as financial risks are concerned, they levelled off in 2005, after several years of decline. firms results, financial structure, bankruptcy prediction, sectoral analysis...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the relationship between capital structure and firm performance of listed <b>non</b> <b>financial</b> <b>corporations</b> in Tanzania. The study used panel data for the period of 5 years from 8 non financial firms listed on the Dar es salaam Stock Exchange. Study use mixed model repeated measure to estimate the relationship between capital structure and firm performance where, capital structure was proxied by debt ratio and debt-to equity ratio while performance was proxied by return on assets and return on equity. The study reveals Tanzania listed non financial firms are financed more by equity capital than debt financing. Results also show that listed non financial firms perform below average. The study results indicate significant negative relationship between return on assets and debt to equity ratio, return on assets and debt ratio, and return on equity and debt ratio. However, the relationship between return on equity and debt to equity ratio was positive but insignificant. The results are consistent with previous studies conducted by Kipesha and Moshi (2014); Pastory et al. (2011); Kandongo et al. (2014); Anarfo (2015); Kajananthan et al. (2013); Hassan et al. (2012).

40|$|While the {{prospect}} for equity values naturally concerns traders and investors, {{it also is}} a concern for public policy. Because investors’ wealth depends on the value of corporate equity, the demand for consumption goods can vary with the price of stocks. The valuation of corporations’ productive assets on stock exchanges also influences businesses’ willingness and ability to undertake new investments. If the falling price of stocks should retard the pace of capital formation in the future, it also would retard the potential growth of output and living standards.; This article examines the relationship between the earnings of <b>non</b> <b>financial</b> <b>corporations</b> and the value of their equity. It concludes that the price of stocks corresponds more closely to the earnings that companies disclose in their financial reports than it does to the earnings for nonfinancial corporations reported in the national income accounts. This analysis also suggests that the value of equity does not necessarily reflect corporations’ incentives for undertaking investments. If the opportunities for profitable growth, both here and abroad, remain sufficiently attractive, lower prices of stocks would not foretell a commensurate drop in corporations’ capital budgets.

The value relevance of financial {{information provided by}} financial reports have been attracted many researchers {{and many of them}} found the positive relationships. This paper examines whether the level of <b>non</b> <b>financial</b> information disclosure affects the financial performance of companies.
