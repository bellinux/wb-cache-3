25|$|The album Comme si de rien n'était {{followed}} the <b>No</b> <b>Promises</b> album that had sold about 500,000 copies worldwide. This third album included 14 tracks, {{all of them}} composed by Carla Bruni, {{with the exception of}} two songs written in collaboration with French novelist Michel Houellebecq and the singer Julien Clerc, a cover of You Belong To Me, and a cover of a song of the Italian singer Francesco Guccini (Il vecchio e il bambino).|$|E
25|$|The media {{attention}} that the Waffle, and its candidate, James Laxer, received, {{before and during}} the vote, partially explains the closest federal NDP leadership election up to that time. Lewis' perceived heavy-handed tactics in dealing with the Waffle at this and previous conventions had made him enough enemies to make the leadership campaign interesting. As well, Lewis was involved in most of the internal conflicts within the CCF/NDP during the previous 36 years, so the many members that felt his wrath as the party disciplinarian during this period, plotted their revenge against him. At his first press conference after winning the leadership, Lewis stated that he was not beholden to the Waffle, as they were soundly defeated on the floor, and he made <b>no</b> <b>promises</b> to them. He also took on the party's Quebec wing, stating that they could continue to theorize about possible self-determination resolutions, but come election time, they must pledge themselves to the party's newly confirmed federalist policy. He did not purge the Waffle from the NDP, instead leaving it to his son Stephen to do in June 1972, when the party's Ontario wing resolved to disband the Waffle, or kick its members out of the party if they did not comply with the disbanding order.|$|E

500|$|Fox made <b>no</b> <b>promises</b> {{that his}} efforts {{would lead to}} a cure for cancer, but he closed his letter with the statement: [...] "We need your help. The people in cancer clinics all over the world need people who believe in miracles. I am not a dreamer, and I am not saying that this will {{initiate}} any kind of definitive answer or cure to cancer. I believe in miracles. I have to." [...] The Cancer Society was skeptical of his dedication, but agreed to support Fox once he had acquired sponsors and requested he get a medical certificate from a heart specialist stating that he was fit to attempt the run. Fox was diagnosed with left ventricular hypertrophy– an enlarged heart– a condition commonly associated with athletes. Doctors warned Fox of the potential risks he faced, though they did not consider his condition a significant concern. They endorsed his participation when he promised that he would stop immediately if he began to experience any heart problems.|$|E
500|$|Attorneys {{made their}} closing {{arguments}} in the city's case on June 26 and Judge Marsha J. Pechman announced that she would issue her ruling on the following Wednesday. On July 2, hours before Judge Pechman was to release her ruling, {{it was announced that}} the team and the city had reached a settlement where PBC would pay the city $45 million immediately in exchange for breaking the lease, and an additional $30 million if Seattle was not given a replacement team in five years. According to the conditions of the settlement, the Sonics' name and colors could not be used by the team in Oklahoma City, but could be taken by a future team in Seattle, although <b>no</b> <b>promises</b> for a replacement team were given. The Oklahoma City team would retain the franchise history of the SuperSonics, which could be [...] "shared" [...] with any future NBA team in Seattle. The team moved to Oklahoma City immediately and announced it would begin play in the 2008–09 season.|$|E
500|$|A {{music video}} for [...] "Te Lo Agradezco, Pero No" [...] {{directed}} by Jaume de Laiguana was filmed in Brooklyn in 2006. It {{was released on}} 11 January 2007, acting as a continuation for the clip of Sanz's previous single [...] "A la Primera Persona" [...] (2006). However, in [...] "Te Lo Agradezco, Pero No", the roles of Sanz and his love interest change and he clarifies that [...] "there are <b>no</b> <b>promises</b> that are worthy after everything is finished". By Shakira's request, {{this was the first}} video where Sanz is performing choreography. A making-of clip about the music video was included on the DVD of El Tren de los Momentos: Edición Especial (2007). The music video for [...] "Te Lo Agradezco, Pero No" [...] was also featured on Sanz's compilation album Colección Definitiva (2011).

500|$|On March 1, defense {{attorneys}} questioned evidence {{brought by the}} prosecution. They {{pointed out that the}} police had no written reports of the investigation, and had failed to record the serial numbers and mark the US$100 bills used as evidence when Martínez received the cash from Cisneros immediately before her arrest. In addition, a private forensic investigator hired by the defense stated that he could not prove that the recordings were authentic. The private investigator later mentioned in an interview that the defense had paid US$18,000 to analyze the tapes, though she said that this payment did not influence her study of the recordings. The defense said [...] the searches police conducted did not produce any evidence to implicate Cisneros in the murder, and that Garza was not arrested for over a month after he confessed his involvement in it. The police defended their actions and said that Garza was initially a witness when investigators met with him and Moya in March 1993 at a motel in San Antonio to discuss the murder. Investigators said he then traveled with them to Brownsville to give an official statement which he signed. He then stayed at a hotel in Brownsville that was arranged and paid for by Brownsville investigators, while the police prepared to record his encounter with Martínez. After incriminating Martínez, Garza was allowed to go to Mexico. Martínez and Cisneros were arrested several weeks after Garza's statement, but he was not arrested until two months later. The police stated that they made <b>no</b> <b>promises</b> Garza to obtain his cooperation.|$|E
500|$|David Lewis ran {{to succeed}} Douglas as {{national}} leader. [...] The 1971 leadership convention was a tumultuous affair. A {{new generation of}} NDP activists known as The Waffle proposed many controversial resolutions, including nationalization of all natural resource industries and support for Quebec Sovereignty. [...] It took the combined efforts of the NDP establishment — and the sizable trade union delegation — to vote down these resolutions, which caused many bitter debates and sharply divided the convention. [...] Lewis, as the leading establishment figure, won the party's leadership on April 24 in a surprisingly close race that required four ballots before he could claim victory over the Waffle's James Laxer. [...] Laxer had been prominently featured in media coverage leading up to and during the convention. [...] Lewis' perceived heavy-handedness in dealing with The Waffle at this and previous conventions made him many enemies, as had his involvement {{in most of the}} CCF and NDP's internal conflicts during the previous 36 years. [...] Many members who had felt his wrath as party disciplinarian plotted their revenge against him. At his first press conference after winning the leadership, Lewis stated that he was not beholden to the Waffle, as they were soundly defeated at the convention, and that he made <b>no</b> <b>promises</b> to them.

500|$|McCarthy began January {{by making}} <b>no</b> <b>promises</b> about a {{potential}} {{challenge of the}} president on the Florida primary ballot, but reaffirmed his goal to defeat the president in New Hampshire. The next day, he appeared as the first guest of the half-hour ABC news series Issues and Answers, and discussed his views on pertinent campaign issues. He claimed the North Vietnamese government was willing to negotiate, and that any further bombing should be halted to forge an end to the hostilities. As President Johnson prepared for his annual State of the Union Address, McCarthy requested equal time from television networks after the president discussed the McCarthy-Kennedy conspiracy theory the previous month. The request was rejected. Later in the month, McCarthy delivered a speech in front of 6,500 students at University Park, Pennsylvania, that criticized the Johnson administration for being [...] "afraid to negotiate" [...] with the North Vietnamese. This came as Robert Kennedy commented that he would support Johnson as the nominee, even though his views more closely resembled McCarthy's, predicting that the campaign would have a [...] "healthy influence" [...] on Johnson, whom he picked to ultimately win the nomination. Near the end of January, McCarthy campaigned in St. Louis, where he continued his anti-war rhetoric, describing the Vietnam War as against [...] "American tradition" [...] and declared that [...] "no nation has a right" [...] to [...] "destroy a nation" [...] with the rationale of [...] "nation building." [...] He then discussed his support for normalized relations with Cuba. After seven weeks of campaigning, McCarthy concluded that his speeches were coming across more as poetry than substantive campaign messages. As he traveled through California, a stop in Stanford was greeted by newspaper headlines that asked the candidate whether he [...] "want to make righteous speeches...or end the Viet Nam War." [...] As his candidacy continued, McCarthy and his staffers worked to improve the campaign's [...] "passion gap".|$|E
