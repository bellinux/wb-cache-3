40|$|Proof <b>nets</b> <b>for</b> MLL (unit-free multiplicative linear logic) and (unit-free {{additive}} linear logic) are graphical abstractions of proofs {{which are}} efficient (proofs translate in linear time) and canoni- cal (invariant under rule commutation). This paper solves a three- decade open problem: are there efficient canonical proof <b>nets</b> <b>for</b> MALL (unit-free multiplicative-additive linear logic) ? Honouring MLL and ALL canonicity, {{in which all}} commutations are strictly local proof-tree rewrites, we define local canonicity for MALL: invariance under local rule commutation. We present new proof <b>nets</b> <b>for</b> MALL, called conflict nets, which are both efficient and locally canonical...|$|R

5|$|Arsenal {{were drawn}} {{away in the}} third round, against Sheffield United at Bramall Lane. Both teams scored rapidly, with three goals scored {{in the space of}} six minutes. The first {{as the result of a}} {{scramble}} which ended with Jimmy Brain heading the ball into the <b>net</b> <b>for</b> Arsenal. United quickly responded, equalising from a header by Harry Johnson. But Arsenal went ahead once more following a goal by Charlie Buchan. David Mercer equalised once more for Sheffield after 40 minutes, to keep the scores level going into half-time. Joe Hulme scored the final goal of the match, and the winner for Arsenal, in the 60th minute.|$|E
5|$|Brimsek {{started the}} 1938–39 {{season with the}} Reds, {{but he would not}} stay long with them. During an NHL {{exhibition}} game, Thompson got injured and it was unlikely that Thompson would recuperate in time for the beginning of the regular season. Needing a replacement, Brimsek was called up by the Bruins. In his NHL debut, Brimsek helped his team defeat the Toronto Maple Leafs by a score of 3–2. He started in <b>net</b> <b>for</b> one more game, a 4–1 victory against the Red Wings, before being sent back down to the Reds as Thompson recovered. Art Ross, the Bruins' coach and general manager, had seen enough of Brimsek during his two stints in Boston to contemplate promoting Brimsek full-time with the Bruins. Thompson was traded to the Detroit Red Wings for goaltender Normie Smith and $15,000.00 U.S. cash on November 16, 1938, after playing only five games with the Bruins. Ross then proceeded to promote Brimsek as the team's new starting goalie. This did not sit well with Bruins fans as Thompson was a favorite and he was the reigning Vezina Trophy winner.|$|E
5|$|Burge {{moved to}} Championship club Doncaster Rovers on a {{short-term}} deal on transfer deadline day, 31 January 2011. He made his Doncaster debut as a second-half substitute in a 6–0 home defeat to Ipswich Town on 15 February 2011. That {{was to be}} his only appearance for the club. On 17 March 2011, Burge joined League Two team Oxford United on loan {{for the rest of}} the season, after impressing in a reserve game against Colchester United which Oxford won 2–0. He went straight into the starting line-up for the match against Crewe Alexandra two days later, and provided the assist for James Constable's winning goal. His first performance at Oxford received praise in the local media. A week later, Steve MacLean opened the scoring against Burton Albion, but Burge reportedly claimed the goal after the ball took a deflection off his heel on its way into the <b>net</b> <b>for</b> what would have been his first Football League goal. In mid-April 2011 he was recalled by Doncaster, and a few weeks later they offered him a new deal.|$|E

5|$|Moving {{up to the}} {{national}} junior team, Getzlaf made his first of two appearances at the World Junior Hockey Championship in 2004. He recorded six points in six games for a Canadian squad that scored 25 goals in its four round-robin games and surrendered only four {{en route to a}} gold medal showdown with the United States. With Canada leading 3–1 early in the third period of the final, both Getzlaf and Sidney Crosby failed to capitalize on opportunities to add an extra goal that may have sealed a victory. Instead, Canada surrendered the lead, and Getzlaf and his teammates were forced to settle for the silver medal after goaltender Marc-André Fleury accidentally sent a clearing pass off a teammate and into his own <b>net</b> <b>for</b> the game-winning goal.|$|E
5|$|In {{the months}} leading up to the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup, McLeod joined the Canadian {{national}} team as they took part in an extended residency in order to prepare and train. McLeod and the Canadian national team started off the year at the Four Nations Tournament. While McLeod was on the roster for the tournament, she did not play in any of the three games, allowing fellow Canadian Stephanie Labbé to gain experience. McLeod made her first appearance of the year at the Cyprus Cup in March, where she appeared in three of the four matches that Canada played, recording three shutouts. She also appeared in two other friendlies against France and England in April and May. In April 2015, McLeod was named to the 23-player Canadian roster for the FIFA Women's World Cup hosted by Canada. As Canada's veteran goalkeeper, she started in <b>net</b> <b>for</b> all five of the team's matches, recording three shutouts, and helping Canada earn a sixth-place finish. The team's one loss came in the quarter-finals against England, which halted their advancement in the tournament. Although McLeod had an impressive tournament, she was left off both the Golden Glove shortlist and the FIFA Technical Study Group All-Star Squad.|$|E

Despite the superior performance of backup goaltender Cam Talbot during Lundqvist's absence, Lundqvist would remain the Rangers' starter upon his return on March 28, in a 4-2 loss to the Boston Bruins. Despite missing nearly 2 months, Lundqvist was able to clinch 30 wins for the 9th time in his career, going 5-2-0 after returning from the injury.|$|E
