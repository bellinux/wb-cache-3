5|$|Lorraine {{was ordered}} on 15 July 1912, as a {{replacement}} for the battleship Liberté, which had been destroyed by a magazine explosion the previous year. She was laid down at the Chantiers de Penhoët shipyard in Saint-Nazaire on 1 August 1912 and launched on 30 September 1913. She was commissioned into the French Navy on 10 March 1916. After entering service in 1916, Lorraine and her sisters were assigned to the 1st Division of the 1st Battle Squadron. The three ships remained in the unit {{for the remainder of the}} war. They spent the majority of their time at Corfu to prevent the Austro-Hungarian fleet from attempting to break out of the Adriatic. The fleet's presence was also intended to intimidate Greece, which had become increasingly hostile to the Triple Entente. Later in the war, men were drawn from their crews for anti-submarine warfare vessels. As the Austro-Hungarians largely remained in port for the duration of the war, Lorraine saw no action during the conflict. In 1917, she returned to Toulon for a periodic refit, but apart from that voyage, she saw <b>no</b> <b>time</b> <b>at</b> sea for the rest of the year.|$|E

Mulder says her life changed in 1993 when she was shuttling from airport to airport with almost <b>no</b> <b>time</b> <b>at</b> home.

25|$|At first, Shui Ta only appears when Shen Teh is in a {{particularly}} desperate situation, but as {{the action of the}} play develops, Shen Teh becomes unable {{to keep up with the}} demands made on her and is overwhelmed by the promises she makes to others. Therefore, she is compelled to call on her cousin's services for longer periods until at last her true personality seems to be consumed by her cousin's severity. Where Shen Teh is soft, compassionate, and vulnerable, Shui Ta is unemotional and pragmatic, even vicious; it seems that only Shui Ta is made to survive in the world in which they live. In what seems <b>no</b> <b>time</b> <b>at</b> all, he has built her humble shop into a full-scale tobacco factory with many employees.|$|E
25|$|Lamoureux and Walker {{turned the}} company around quickly and in 1982, Lamoureux left the company. A year later, Walker died unexpectedly. That year brought in $28.3 million. However, {{some of the}} {{cost-cutting}} measures implemented by Lamoureux and Walker— including cutbacks in research and in advertising— hurt the company more than helping it. In 1986, after being away from the company for nine years, former lingerie division president Linda J. Wachner engineered a $550 million hostile takeover Wachner had previously risen through the ranks at Max Factor, making the declining cosmetics company profitable again within just two years. She wasted <b>no</b> <b>time</b> <b>at</b> Warnaco and right away went to work streamlining the company’s fifteen divisions into just two categories: menswear and underwear.|$|E
25|$|Six {{weeks earlier}} in the Camelot dungeon, David, Hook, Merlin and Belle waste <b>no</b> <b>time</b> <b>at</b> all in {{defeating}} Arthur's guards, with Hook impressed by Merlin's ability to see the future. They then reach the cell where Lancelot and Merida are being held, with Merlin telling the others that it is enchanted. Belle then gives Merlin a book of spells and makes the bars disappear. Merida tells the rescuers that Arthur took the wisps which she needed to find her brothers, so Merlin suggests {{that they need to}} come up with another way to find them. When Belle asks Merida why she was in the dungeon, Merida tells her that the wisps led her to the sea, but the boat she hid out in belonged to Arthur, and that when he found her he then threw her in the cell. Merida then knocks Belle out with a rock and hours later Bell awakes to find herself in a rowboat with Merida. Belle learns that Merida needs Belle's magic to find her brothers. She further explained that the clans kidnapped her brothers so they can force her to relinquish the throne as she is not married.|$|E

The crew called out several times, but after receiving no response, they entered and found Hendrix alone in bed. Dannemann was nowhere to be found. According to Jones: [...] "Well, we had to get the police, we only had [...] and an empty flat, so John ran up and radioed, and got the aspirator... It was horrific. He was covered in vomit. There was tons of it all over the pillow—black and brown it was. His airway was completely blocked all the way down... We felt his pulse... showed a light in his eyes. But there was no response at all." [...] At 11:30a.m., police officers Ian Smith and Tom Keene responded to a call for police assistance from the ambulance control centre. Jones commented: [...] "Once the police arrived, which seemed like <b>no</b> <b>time</b> <b>at</b> all, we got [...] off to hospital as quick as we could." ...|$|E

Bernier thought the three {{were part of a}} larger formation. He indicated they were traveling at high speed: [...] "I have seen a P-38 appear seemingly on one horizon and then gone to the opposite horizon in <b>no</b> <b>time</b> <b>at</b> all, but these disks certainly were traveling faster than any P-38. [...] No doubt Mr. Arnold saw them just a few minutes or seconds later, according to their speed."

[...] Crick later praised Sonya for helping Lucas and Vanessa realise their feelings for each other, saying [...] "thank goodness for her meddling ways!"

40|$|Quantitative noise {{sensitivity}} and exceptional times for percolation By ODED SCHRAMM and JEFFREY E. STEIF One {{goal of this}} paper is to prove that dynamical critical site percolation on the planar triangular lattice has exceptional <b>times</b> <b>at</b> which percolation occurs. In doing so, new quantitative noise sensitivity results for percolation are obtained. The latter is based on a novel method for controlling the “level k ” Fourier coefficients via the construction of a randomized algorithm which looks at random bits, outputs the value of a particular function but looks at any fixed input bit with low probability.
