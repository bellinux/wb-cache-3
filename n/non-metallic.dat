5|$|Most ALF vapor cells use {{alkali metals}} {{because of their}} high vapor pressures; many alkali metals also have {{absorption}} lines and resonance in the desired spectra. Common vapor cell materials are sodium, potassium and caesium. Note that <b>non-metallic</b> vapors such as neon may be used. As the early quantum counters used solid state metal ions in crystals, {{it is conceivable that}} such a medium could be used in the ALFs of today. This is presumably not done because of the superiority of atomic vapors in this capacity.|$|E
5|$|Thulium {{reacts with}} various {{metallic}} and <b>non-metallic</b> elements forming {{a range of}} binary compounds, including TmN, TmS, TmC2, Tm2C3, TmH2, TmH3, TmSi2, TmGe3, TmB4, TmB6 and TmB12. In those compounds, thulium exhibits valence states +2 and +3, however, the +3 state is most common and only this state has been observed in thulium solutions. Thulium exists as a Tm3+ ion in solution. In this state, the thulium ion is surrounded by nine molecules of water. Tm3+ ions exhibit a bright blue luminescence.|$|E
5|$|Hydrogen's {{chemical}} properties {{are not very}} close {{to those of the}} alkali metals, which occupy group 1, and on that basis hydrogen is sometimes placed elsewhere: {{one of the most common}} alternatives is in group 17; one of the factors behind it is the strictly univalent predominantly <b>non-metallic</b> chemistry of hydrogen, and that of fluorine (the element placed on the top of group 17) is strictly univalent and <b>non-metallic.</b> Sometimes, to show how hydrogen has properties both corresponding to those of the alkali metals and the halogens, it may be shown in two columns simultaneously. Another suggestion is above carbon in group 14: placed that way, it fits well into the trends of increasing ionization potential values and electron affinity values, and is not too far from the electronegativity trend, even though hydrogen cannot show the tetravalence characteristic of the heavier group 14 elements. Finally, hydrogen is sometimes placed separately from any group; this is based on how general properties of hydrogen differ from that of any group. The other period 1 element, helium, is sometimes placed separately from any group as well. The property that distinguishes helium from the rest of the noble gases (even though the extraordinary inertness of helium is extremely close to that of neon and argon) is that in its closed electron shell, helium has only two electrons in the outermost electron orbital, while the rest of the noble gases have eight.|$|E
5|$|Many {{distinct}} factors {{influence the}} strength of welds and the material around them, including the welding method, the amount and concentration of energy input, the weldability of the base material, filler material, and flux material, {{the design of the}} joint, and the interactions between all these factors. To test the quality of a weld, either destructive or nondestructive testing methods are commonly used to verify that welds are free of defects, have acceptable levels of residual stresses and distortion, and have acceptable heat-affected zone (HAZ) properties. Types of welding defects include cracks, distortion, gas inclusions (porosity), <b>non-metallic</b> inclusions, lack of fusion, incomplete penetration, lamellar tearing, and undercutting.|$|E
5|$|Dutch {{counter-terrorism}} agency NCTb {{said that}} it had started a probe into where the suspect originated. Dutch officials also said that they will now use 3D full-body scanning X-ray technology on flights departing to the U.S., despite protests from privacy advocates. Dutch officials said that security must take priority over {{the privacy of the}} individuals being scanned, but the scanners are not designed to compromise an individual's privacy, as the imagery resolution is only high enough to detect <b>non-metallic</b> objects under clothing, such as powdered explosives. Members of the Second Chamber (Lower House) of the Dutch parliament demanded an explanation from Minister of Justice Hirsch Ballin, asking how the suspect managed to smuggle explosives on board, despite Schiphol's reportedly strict security measures.|$|E
5|$|Metal and {{nonmetals}} can {{be further}} classified into subcategories that show a gradation from metallic to <b>non-metallic</b> properties, when going left to right in the rows. The metals are subdivided into the highly reactive alkali metals, through the less reactive alkaline earth metals, lanthanides and actinides, via the archetypal transition metals, and ending in the physically and chemically weak post-transition metals. The nonmetals are simply subdivided into the polyatomic nonmetals, which, being nearest to the metalloids, show some incipient metallic character; the diatomic nonmetals, which are essentially nonmetallic; and the monatomic noble gases, which are nonmetallic and almost completely inert. Specialized groupings such as the refractory metals and the noble metals, which are subsets (in this example) of the transition metals, are also known and occasionally denoted.|$|E
5|$|The heavier {{metalloids}} {{continue the}} theme. Arsenic can form alloys with metals, including platinum and copper; {{it is also}} added to copper and its alloys to improve corrosion resistance and appears to confer the same benefit when added to magnesium. Antimony is well known as an alloy-former, including with the coinage metals. Its alloys include pewter (a tin alloy with up to 20% antimony) and type metal (a lead alloy with up to 25% antimony). Tellurium readily alloys with iron, as ferrotellurium (50–58% tellurium), and with copper, {{in the form of}} copper tellurium (40–50% tellurium). Ferrotellurium is used as a stabilizer for carbon in steel casting. Of the <b>non-metallic</b> elements less often recognised as metalloids, selenium—in the form of ferroselenium (50–58% selenium)—is used to improve the machinability of stainless steels.|$|E
25|$|<b>Non-metallic</b> {{cookware}} {{can be used}} in both {{conventional and}} microwave ovens. <b>Non-metallic</b> cookware typically can not be used on the stovetop, although Corningware and Pyroflam are some exceptions.|$|E

25|$|Lustre {{indicates}} how light reflects {{from the}} mineral's surface, {{with regards to}} its quality and intensity. There are numerous qualitative terms used to describe this property, which are split into metallic and <b>non-metallic</b> categories. Metallic and sub-metallic minerals have high reflectivity like metal; examples of minerals with this lustre are galena and pyrite. <b>Non-metallic</b> lustres include: adamantine, such as in diamond; vitreous, which is a glassy lustre very common in silicate minerals; pearly, such as in talc and apophyllite, resinous, such {{as members of the}} garnet group, silky which common in fibrous minerals such as asbestiform chrysotile.|$|E
25|$|An {{example of}} <b>non-metallic</b> {{composite}} coins (sometimes incorrectly called plastic coins) was introduced into circulation in Transnistria on 22 August 2014. Most of these coins are also non-circular, with different shapes corresponding to different coin values.|$|E
25|$|The Fairchild MX-2223 design {{called for}} a <b>non-metallic</b> {{fuselage}} with swept wings and a v-tail. Radar reflectors were located in the fuselage and on pods positioned on the wing tips to simulate the radar return of a bomber.|$|E
25|$|Today, {{the state}} of Veracruz, rich in natural resources, is an {{important}} component of Mexico's economy. Approximately 35% of Mexico's water supply is found in Veracruz. There are a number of metallic and <b>non-metallic</b> mineral mining but the most important resource is oil.|$|E
25|$|The US is the province's largest export market, {{accounting}} for 92% {{of a foreign}} trade valued in 2014 at C$12.964 billion. Refined petroleum accounted in 2014 for 63% of the total, followed by seafood products, pulp, paper and sawmill products and <b>non-metallic</b> minerals (chiefly potash).|$|E
25|$|According to the Mines and Geosciences Bureau, {{deposits}} of metallic minerals {{discovered in the}} province are copper, gold, molybdenum and pyrite. <b>Non-metallic</b> deposits include red clay, white clay and limestone, with sand and gravel being the most abundant deposits in the province.|$|E
25|$|Like the MX-2223 design, the SM-73 {{utilized}} a <b>non-metallic</b> fiberglass fuselage. The {{swept wing}} of the MX-2223 design evolved to a fiberglass 52°delta wing. A Thiokol solid-propellant rocket booster was used to launch the SM-73 to a speed of 300 knots (345mph).|$|E
25|$|Reaction with <b>non-metallic</b> elements, {{with the}} {{exceptions}} of nitrogen, oxygen, noble gases, silicon, and halogens other than iodine, usually oxidizes {{them to their}} highest oxidation states as acids {{with the formation of}} nitrogen dioxide for concentrated acid and nitric oxide for dilute acid.|$|E
25|$|Forest {{resources}} include {{timber and}} minerals, among them gold, copper, silver, chrome, and <b>non-metallic</b> minerals such as lime for making cement, and greenstones for ornaments. Timber groups include {{many species of}} hardwoods, such as mahogany, {{and other types of}} trees in high demand for durability.|$|E
25|$|For some {{of these}} colors their {{popularity}} was limited. Now, many years since production ceased in early 2000, certain colored models are now hard to find - {{such as those in}} green, for example.

25|$|The {{are also}} a number of <b>non-metallic</b> {{pollutants}} in the Little Nescopeck Creek watershed. Ammonia is one such pollutant, although the Jeddo Tunnel contributes little to the creek. There is also phosphorus and nitrite in the creek, but the tunnel does not contribute a measurable amount of such compounds.|$|E
25|$|They {{are used}} as {{polarizing}} filters in photography to reduce oblique reflections from <b>non-metallic</b> surfaces, and are the lenses of the 3D glasses worn for viewing some stereoscopic movies (notably, the RealD 3D variety), where the polarization of light is used to differentiate which image should {{be seen by the}} left and right eye.|$|E
25|$|There is {{considerable}} overlap between {{the subjects of}} non-steel reinforcement and fiber-reinforcement of concrete. The introduction of non-steel reinforcement of concrete is relatively recent; it takes two major forms: <b>non-metallic</b> rebar rods, and non-steel (usually also <b>non-metallic)</b> fibres incorporated into the cement matrix. For example, there is increasing interest in glass fiber reinforced concrete (GFRC) and in various applications of polymer fibres incorporated into concrete. Although currently {{there is not much}} suggestion that such materials will in general replace metal rebar, some of them have major advantages in specific applications, and there also are new applications in which metal rebar simply is not an option. However, the design and application of non-steel reinforcing is fraught with challenges. For one thing, concrete is a highly alkaline environment, in which many materials, including most kinds of glass, have a poor service life. Also, the behaviour of such reinforcing materials differs from the behaviour of metals, for instance in terms of shear strength, creep and elasticity.|$|E
25|$|Pakistan is {{endowed with}} {{significant}} mineral resources and {{is emerging as}} a very promising area for prospecting/exploration for mineral deposits. Based on available information, the country's more than 6,00,000km² of outcrops area demonstrates varied geological potential for metallic and <b>non-metallic</b> mineral deposits.In the wake of 18th {{amendment to the constitution}} all the provinces are free to exploit and explore the mineral resources which are in their jurisdiction.|$|E
25|$|The {{mountains}} contain relatively unexploited {{deposits of}} gold, silver, iron, and coal. Although Veracruz {{is an important}} source of metals such as iron and copper, a great deal of its mining involves <b>non-metallic</b> minerals as sulfur, silica, feldspar, calcium, kaolin and marble. The state is ranked fourth in the nation for this kind of mining production. However, mining only accounts for 1.5% of economic activity for the entire state.|$|E
25|$|Antique has {{deposits}} of metallic and <b>non-metallic</b> mineral resources. The metallic mineral resources include copper, gold, chromite, pyrite, iron, manganese and ferro alloy and limestone. Copper deposits in Barbaza and San Remigio {{are estimated to}} have a volume of 36,255 metric tons and 59,445 metric tons respectively. Pyrite deposits in Valderrama and Sibalom are estimated at 120,000 metric tons while limestone deposits in Culasi are estimated at 30 billion metric tons.|$|E
25|$|Other {{minerals}} {{that have}} been actively mined include copper in the Whitehorse area, lead and zinc in Faro, silver, zinc and lead in the Mayo/Keno City area, asbestos in Clinton Creek, and copper, gold, and coal in the Carmacks area. The world's largest known deposit of tungsten is in the Macmillan Pass area in the Mackenzie Mountains near the Northwest Territories border. <b>Non-metallic</b> minerals mined have included jade and barite.|$|E
25|$|The largest {{industries}} after furniture manufacturing (5290.8 billion VND in 2009) {{in terms}} of gross output are food products and beverages (2770.5 billion), <b>non-metallic</b> mineral products (938.4 billion), wood processing (843.6 billion), and chemical products (755.1 billion). The latter includes not only companies supporting the furniture industry, but also a pharmaceutical industry, the most significant company of which is Bidiphar, a local state-owned enterprise. Smaller manufacturing sectors include garments, paper, leather, plastics and rubber products.|$|E
25|$|Toxic {{materials}} {{including many}} organic materials, metals (such as zinc, silver, cadmium, thallium, etc.) acids, alkalis, <b>non-metallic</b> elements (such as arsenic or selenium) are generally resistant to biological processes unless very dilute. Metals {{can often be}} precipitated out by changing the pH or by treatment with other chemicals. Many, however, are resistant to treatment or mitigation and may require concentration followed by landfilling or recycling. Dissolved organics can be incinerated within the wastewater by the advanced oxidation process.|$|E
25|$|The {{department}} contributes {{significantly to}} the national economy. According to statistics for the year 2005 as agricultural Valley contributes 5.37% of the national production, which is relatively low compared with Antioquia (15.48%) or Cundinamarca (12.81%). In fisheries products, the region ranks first with vallecaucana contributing 36% of the country's total production. As for mining, the Valley is not a metal region; however, in terms of <b>non-metallic</b> minerals the department contributes 8.15% of the value added across Colombia.|$|E
25|$|The Mines and Geo-Sciences Bureau (MGB) {{confirms}} {{the presence of}} gold in Mt. Dumara, Laua-an extending as far as Lumboyan, Barbaza. An analysis conducted in ore deposits indicated that 39.75 grams of gold {{can be found in}} a metric ton of ore. <b>Non-metallic</b> deposits include sulfides, clay, sulfur, oil and gemstones. Marble deposits are estimated at 1.8 billion metric tons in Libertad, and 2.3 billion metric tons in Pandan. Coal reserves in Caluya are estimated to be 1.6 million metric tons.|$|E
25|$|These designs {{had reached}} the A-11 stage when the program was reviewed. The A-11 was {{competing}} against a Convair proposal called Kingfish, of roughly similar performance. However, the Kingfish included a number of features that greatly reduced its radar cross-section, which was seen as favorable to the board. Lockheed responded with a simple update of the A-11, adding twin canted fins instead of a single right-angle one, and adding {{a number of areas}} of <b>non-metallic</b> materials. This became the A-12 design. On 26 January 1960, the CIA ordered 12 A-12 aircraft.|$|E
25|$|The {{composition}} of Lutetia has puzzled astronomers for some time. While classified among the M-type asteroids, {{most of which}} are metallic, Lutetia is one of the anomalous members that do not display much evidence of metal on their surface. Indeed, there were various indications of a <b>non-metallic</b> surface: a flat, low frequency spectrum similar to that of carbonaceous chondrites and C-type asteroids and not at all like that of metallic meteorites, a low radar albedo unlike the high albedos of strongly metallic asteroids like 16 Psyche, evidence of hydrated materials on its surface, abundant silicates, and a thicker regolith than most asteroids.|$|E
25|$|Diamond mounted points: A {{grinding}} tool for <b>non-metallic</b> {{materials such as}} stone, porcelain and the like, and more particularly to a {{grinding tool}} using a diamond alloy as a grinding body comprising a substrate and a plurality of grinding bodies, And the substrate is preferably made of an adhesive material having a certain toughness, and the grinding body is preferably made of a diamond alloy material, and the substrate is preferably made of a diamond alloy material, The utility model has the characteristics of high grinding performance, simple manufacture and low cost, high grinding quality and {{can be applied to}} large-scale grinding.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the aforementioned treatments, there are also many management approaches that can alleviate the symptoms of dysgeusia. These include using <b>non-metallic</b> silverware, avoiding metallic or bitter tasting foods, increasing the consumption of foods high in protein, flavoring foods with spices and seasonings, serving foods cold {{in order to reduce}} any unpleasant taste or odor, frequently brushing one's teeth and utilizing mouthwash, or using sialogogues such as chewing sugar-free gum or sour-tasting drops that stimulate the productivity of saliva. When taste is impeded, the food experience can be improved through means other than taste, such as texture, aroma, temperature, and color.|$|E
25|$|Microbial corrosion, or {{commonly}} known as microbiologically influenced corrosion (MIC), is a corrosion caused or promoted by microorganisms, usually chemoautotrophs. It can apply to both metallic and <b>non-metallic</b> materials, in {{the presence or absence}} of oxygen. Sulfate-reducing bacteria are active in the absence of oxygen (anaerobic); they produce hydrogen sulfide, causing sulfide stress cracking. In the presence of oxygen (aerobic), some bacteria may directly oxidize iron to iron oxides and hydroxides, other bacteria oxidize sulfur and produce sulfuric acid causing biogenic sulfide corrosion. Concentration cells can form in the deposits of corrosion products, leading to localized corrosion.|$|E
25|$|Conventional metal {{detectors}} rely on electromagnetic signals with frequencies {{of the order}} of 10–100kHz, which are not sensitive to plastic or wooden mine bodies and the high explosive block itself. The only part of a low-metal mine that {{they may be able to}} detect is the detonator. Much higher frequency signals ({{of the order of}} 1GHz) are employed in Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) and these signals are also sensitive to the <b>non-metallic</b> parts of the mine. Unfortunately, as they are also affected by innocuous objects such as tree roots and stones and by local changes in soil moisture, it is difficult to distinguish a mine on a GPR image.|$|E
