5|$|Rolling {{stock on}} the New York City Subway {{produces}} {{high levels of}} noise that exceed guidelines set by the World Health Organization and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. In 2006, Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health found <b>noise</b> <b>levels</b> averaged 95 decibel (dB) inside subway cars and 94dB on platforms. Daily exposure to noise at such levels {{for as little as}} 30 minutes can lead to hearing loss. Noise on one in 10 platforms exceeded 100dB. Under WHO and EPA guidelines, noise exposure at that level is limited to 1.5 minutes. A subsequent study by Columbia and the University of Washington found higher average <b>noise</b> <b>levels</b> in the subway (80.4dB) than on commuter trains including Port Authority Trans-Hudson (PATH) (79.4dB), Metro-North (75.1dB) and Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) (74.9dB). Since the decibel scale is a logarithmic scale, sound at 95dB is 10 times more intense than at 85dB, 100 times more intense than at 75dB, and so forth. In the second study, peak subway noise registered at 102.1dB.|$|E

5|$|Cannon sounds have {{sometimes}} {{been used in}} classical pieces with a military theme. One {{of the best known}} examples of such a piece is Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture. The overture is to be performed using an artillery section together with the orchestra, resulting in <b>noise</b> <b>levels</b> high enough that musicians are required to wear ear protection. The cannon fire simulates Russian artillery bombardments of the Battle of Borodino, a critical battle in Napoleon's invasion of Russia, whose defeat the piece celebrates. When the overture was first performed, the cannon were fired by an electric current triggered by the conductor. However, the overture was not recorded with real cannon fire until Mercury Records and conductor Antal Doráti's 1958 recording of the Minnesota Orchestra. Cannon fire is also frequently used annually in presentations of the 1812 on the American Independence Day, a tradition started by Arthur Fiedler of the Boston Pops in 1974.|$|E
40|$|This study {{focus on}} noise {{evaluation}} done at LRT Kelana Jaya Line during train operation. The {{aim of this}} study was to estimate the <b>level</b> of <b>noise</b> during train operation and evaluate the actual <b>level</b> of <b>noise</b> measurement at selected LRT stations. After that, a concept to reduce <b>noise</b> <b>level</b> during train operation was proposed. In addition, the actual <b>level</b> of <b>noise</b> measurement was compared with the theoretical permissible noise based on existing predetermined guidelines and standards. For train interior <b>noise</b> <b>level,</b> sound level meter was installed at front end and gangway by following noise measurement procedure provided by standards and guidelines. For noise at train stations, <b>noise</b> <b>level</b> recorded at different distance from trackside which is 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 meters. The results show that for train interior <b>noise</b> <b>level,</b> most of the time of train operation was exceeded the limitation provided by Prasarana based on standard ISO 3381, 75 dB. The <b>noise</b> <b>level</b> also exceeded <b>noise</b> limit in tunnel which is 80 dB during train operation. For station <b>noise</b> <b>level</b> data, only at distance 2 meter and 4 meter from track can achieve <b>noise</b> <b>level</b> more than 5 dB than limits provided by DOE, about 80 dB. In conclusion, interior train <b>noise</b> <b>level</b> may need to be decrease and at Setiawangsa station has the highest <b>noise</b> <b>level</b> than other stations...|$|R

With the increase of the <b>noise</b> <b>level,</b> the isolated strong noise will also be stronger, so we use the bigger value for higher <b>noise</b> <b>level.</b>|$|R
5|$|For the {{construction}} of the Second Avenue Subway, the MTA, with the engineering firm Arup, worked to reduce the <b>noise</b> <b>levels</b> in stations. In order to reduce noise for all future stations starting with the Second Avenue Subway, the MTA is investing in low-vibration track using ties encased in concrete-covered rubber and neoprene pads. Continuously welded rail, which is also being installed, reduces the noise being made by the wheels of trains. The biggest change {{that is going to be}} made is in the design of stations. Current stations were built with tile and stone, which bounce sound everywhere, while newer stations will have the ceilings lined with absorbent fiberglass or mineral wool that will direct sound toward the train and not the platform. With less noise from the trains, platform announcements could be heard more clearly. They will be clearer with speakers spaced periodically on the platform, angled so that announcements can be heard by the riders. The Second Avenue Subway has the first stations to test this technology.|$|E
5|$|On 17 December 1997, NSB's board {{decided to}} {{purchase}} eleven of the locomotives, excluding number 664. This {{was based on}} an agreement whereby NSB would receive compensation for the incurred losses owing to late delivery and under-performance. Siemens guaranteed that ten of eleven locomotives would be operational at any time. All units were again grounded in January 1998, following two fires. Siemens had between 15 and 20 employees stationed in Trondheim to fix the issues. Regularity on the Nordland Line plummeted from 67 to 46 percent with the introduction of Di6. NSB was forced to keep 15 Di3s, which were up to 42 years old, in operational condition to keep services running. The extra costs of keeping the Di3s running were about NOK50 million per year. These costs would continue until NSB could take delivery of new locomotives, which could take up to three years from the time of order. One contributing factor was a 25percent extra wage for engineers for having above-regulation <b>noise</b> <b>levels</b> in the Di3 cabs. Two Di3s were often run along with a Di6 in a train as backup; should the Di6 fail, the Di3 would continue hauling the train.|$|E
5|$|The {{proposed}} Perth Bunbury Highway Peel deviation, part {{of which}} later became an extension to Kwinana Freeway, underwent a public environmental review in 1997, and an environmental assessment by the Environmental Protection Authority (EPA) in 2000. The relevant environment factors considered by the EPA were vegetation communities, declared rare and priority flora, wetlands, and traffic noise. Main Roads proposed management plans for each factor. Only clearing of vegetation critical for road construction would be undertaken, and more vegetation would be replaced than the amount impacted, using local native species. A survey for declared rare and priority flora found no rare species, and only one priority species, Lasiopetalum membranaceum, near {{the southern end of}} the project. Road construction would impact one conservation class wetland, but no protected wetlands. To minimise impact, road drainage would be designed to contain spills and prevent direct discharges into the surrounding environment. <b>Noise</b> <b>levels</b> would be contained to an acceptable limit in the road design, in accordance with the Main Roads traffic noise policy. The EPA concluded that the road could be designed and managed to an acceptable standard. Main Roads' 2006 plan for environmental management of the project included numerous aspects, which for the northern segment of the project exceeded the environmental approval requirements. Specific plans were developed regarding fauna, topsoil management, construction, foreshores, and both Aboriginal and European heritage.|$|E

It chooses an equilibrium with a sparse regression method by iteratively estimating the <b>noise</b> <b>level</b> via the mean residual square and scaling the penalty {{in proportion to}} the estimated <b>noise</b> <b>level.</b> The iterative algorithm costs little beyond the computation of a path or grid of the sparse regression estimator for penalty levels above a proper threshold. For the scaled lasso, the algorithm is a gradient descent in a convex minimization of a penalized joint loss function for the regression coefficients and <b>noise</b> <b>level.</b> Under mild regularity conditions, we prove that the scaled lasso simultaneously yields an estimator for the <b>noise</b> <b>level</b> and an estimated coefficient vector satisfying certain oracle inequalities for prediction, the estimation of the <b>noise</b> <b>level</b> and the regression coefficients.

The survey samples covered different types of building and prevalent mechanical air supply system. In particular, the measured equivalent continuous <b>noise</b> <b>level</b> Leq in the offices was chosen as an indicator and correlated with the subjective responses from occupants on a visual analogue assessment scale and a dichotomous assessment scale. The results showed that this acceptability was significantly influenced by the office <b>noise</b> <b>level</b> {{and it would be}} correlated with a logistic regression model. A satisfaction criterion of the <b>noise</b> <b>level</b> could be evaluated from the frequency distribution of the occupants' response at certain Leq. In addition, the proposed satisfaction criterion of aural comfort in current design practice was confirmed by the survey samples: an indoor environment with an equivalent continuous <b>noise</b> <b>level</b> Leq of 57. 5 dBA would be adopted as a design criterion for some offices. Practical application: The neutral criterion for aural comfort indicated by the equivalent continuous <b>noise</b> <b>level</b> Leq in air-conditioned offices was determined within the range of 45 - 70 dBA and the 'optimum' <b>noise</b> <b>level</b> La = 57. 5 dBA to be maintained in an office was determined from the survey.
