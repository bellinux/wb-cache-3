5|$|Similar to the 1997 film, Air Force One, 24 {{featured}} the president's personal jumbo-jet (Air Force One). Air Force One {{was featured in}} 24 seasons 2 and 4. Air Force Two (carrying the Vice President but <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>President)</b> was featured in season 6. Several actors featured in 24, such as Xander Berkeley, Glenn Morshower, Wendy Crewson, Timothy Carhart, Jürgen Prochnow, Tom Everett and Spencer Garrett also appeared in the film Air Force One. The 25th amendment, which deals with succession to the Presidency and establishes procedures for filling a vacancy {{in the office of}} the Vice President and responding to Presidential disabilities, was also a shared theme between the film and the television series. 24 used the same Air Force One set from another television series, The West Wing.|$|E
5|$|Congress also {{proposed}} the Fourteenth Amendment to the states. Written by Trumbull and others, it was sent for ratification by state legislatures {{in a process}} in which the president plays no part, though Johnson opposed it. The amendment was designed to put the key provisions of the Civil Rights Act into the Constitution, but also went further. The amendment extended citizenship to every person born in the United States (except Indians on reservations), penalized states that did not give the vote to freedmen, and most importantly, created new federal civil rights that could be protected by federal courts. It also guaranteed that the federal debt would be paid and forbade repayment of Confederate war debts. Further, it disqualified many former Confederates from office, although the disability could be removed—by Congress, <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>president.</b> Both houses passed the Freedmen's Bureau Act a second time, and again the President vetoed it; this time, the veto was overridden. By the summer of 1866, when Congress finally adjourned, Johnson's method of restoring states to the Union by executive fiat, without safeguards for the freedmen, was in deep trouble. His home state of Tennessee ratified the Fourteenth Amendment despite the President's opposition. When Tennessee did so, Congress immediately seated its proposed delegation, embarrassing Johnson.|$|E
25|$|Burton {{likewise}} {{held that}} Congress, <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>President,</b> possessed {{the power to}} act in emergencies because it had exclusive power to pass legislation. He relied on the language and legislative history of the Taft–Hartley Act to find that Congress had not authorized seizure of plants involved in a labor dispute without express legislative authorization. He hedged, however, on whether the President might, in more extreme circumstances, have authority to act.|$|E

25|$|Maryland's {{territory}} {{surrounded the}} United States' capital of Washington, DC and could {{cut it off}} from the North. It had numerous anti-Lincoln officials who tolerated anti-army rioting in Baltimore and the burning of bridges, both aimed at hindering the passage of troops to the South. Maryland's legislature voted overwhelmingly (53–13) {{to stay in the}} Union, but also rejected hostilities with its southern neighbors, voting to close Maryland's rail lines to prevent them from being used for war. Lincoln responded by establishing martial law, and unilaterally suspending habeas corpus, in Maryland, along with sending in militia units from the North. Lincoln rapidly took control of Maryland and the District of Columbia, by seizing many prominent figures, including arresting 1/3 {{of the members of the}} Maryland General Assembly on the day it reconvened. All were held without trial, ignoring a ruling by the Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court Roger Taney, a Maryland native, that only Congress (and <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>president)</b> could suspend habeas corpus (Ex parte Merryman). Indeed, federal troops imprisoned a prominent Baltimore newspaper editor, Frank Key Howard, Francis Scott Key's grandson, after he criticized Lincoln in an editorial for ignoring the Supreme Court Chief Justice's ruling.|$|E
500|$|These developments, {{following}} Hillary Clinton's prior disputed {{statements about}} her cattle futures dealings and Whitewater, {{led to a}} famous exchange in which high-profile New York Times columnist William Safire, who had endorsed Bill Clinton in the previous election, wrote that many Americans were coming to the [...] "sad realization that our First Lady—a woman of undoubted talents who was {{a role model for}} many in her generation—is a congenital liar," [...] followed by White House Press Secretary Mike McCurry saying that [...] "the President, if he were <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>President,</b> would have delivered a more forceful response to that—on the bridge of Mr. Safire's nose." ...|$|E

Clinton showed good humor and sent Hartman a signed photo with the text: [...] "You're <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>president,</b> but you play one on TV. And you're OK, mostly." [...] For his Clinton impression, Hartman copied the president's [...] "post-nasal drip" [...] and the [...] "slight scratchiness" [...] in his voice, {{as well as his}} open, [...] "less intimidating" [...] hand gestures. Hartman opted against wearing a larger prosthetic nose when portraying Clinton, as he felt it would be distracting. He instead wore a wig, dyed his eyebrows brighter and used makeup to highlight his nose. One of Hartman's more famous sketches as Clinton saw the president visit a McDonald's restaurant and explain his policies by eating other customers' food. The writers told him that he was not eating enough during rehearsals for the sketch – {{by the end of the}} live performance, Hartman had eaten so much he could barely speak.|$|E

[...] The bishop said that in 1909, [...] "the army was put together under the name Frontier Force and one year after, it was established {{that it should be}} called the Liberian Frontier Force but with a foreign commander.

500|$|Reactions against Davis {{also came}} from the White House, from Kentucky Governor Steve Beshear, and from {{candidates}} {{in the race for}} the 2016 presidential election. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said, [...] "No public official is above the rule of law. Certainly <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>president</b> of the United States, but neither is the Rowan County clerk." [...] Governor Beshear said the judge's decision [...] "speaks for itself", while his attorneys called the legal arguments in her suit against him [...] "absurd". Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton said, [...] "Officials should be held to their duty to uphold the law– end of story." [...] Several Republican presidential candidates also called on Davis to comply with court orders. Donald Trump said, [...] "the decision's been made, and that is the law of the land." [...] Jeb Bush, former governor of Florida, said Davis [...] "is sworn to uphold the law", but also suggested that some sort of accommodation be made for her. Republican presidential candidates Carly Fiorina and Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina both suggested that Davis should comply with the court order or resign. Members of the Westboro Baptist Church protested against Davis for her multiple divorces and marriages, saying she is living in adultery. Westboro also stated [...] "God hates oath breakers", therefore Davis is obligated to follow the nation's law.|$|E
500|$|When Andrew Johnson {{assumed the}} {{presidency}} after President Lincoln's assassination in April 1865, Senators Sumner and Wilson both hoped Johnson {{would support the}} policies of the Republican Party, since Johnson, a Democrat, had been elected with Lincoln on a pro-Union ticket. After the Civil War ended with a Union Victory in May 1865, the defeated former Confederacy was ruined. [...] It had been devastated economically, politically, and much of its infrastructure had been destroyed during the war. The opportunity was ripe for Congress and Johnson to work together on terms for Southern restoration and reconstruction. Instead, Johnson launched his own reconstruction policy, which was seen as more lenient to former Confederates, and excluded African American citizenship. [...] When Congress opened the session which began in December 1865, Johnson's policy included a demand for admission of Southern Senators and Representatives, nearly all Democrats, including many former Confederates. [...] Congress, still in Republican hands, responded by refusing to allow the Southern Senators and Representatives to take their seats, beginning a rift between Republicans in Congress and the President. Wilson favored allowing only persons who had been loyal to the United States to serve in positions of political power in the former Confederacy, and believed that Congress, <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>President,</b> had the power to reconstruct the southern states. As a result, Wilson joined forces with the Congressmen and Senators known as Radical Republicans, those most strongly opposed to Johnson.|$|E

2500|$|Despite {{the legal}} {{precedent}} set by ex parte Quirin, [...] "the president lacked inherent constitutional authority {{as commander in}} chief to detain American citizens on American soil outside a zone of combat." [...] The Second Circuit relied on the case of Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579 (1952), where the U.S. Supreme Court had ruled that President Truman, during the Korean War years, could not use his position and power {{as commander in chief}}, created under Article 2, Section 2, of the U.S. Constitution, to seize the nation's steel mills {{on the eve of a}} nationwide steelworkers strike. The extraordinary government power to curb civil rights and liberties during crisis periods, such as times of war, lies with Congress and <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>president.</b> Article 1, Section 9, Clause 2, of the U.S. Constitution grants Congress, and <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>president,</b> the power to suspend the right of habeas corpus during a period of rebellion or invasion.|$|E
2500|$|In a {{judgment}} delivered on 13 August 2010, Justice Steven Chong dismissed the application, {{ruling that the}} power to grant a pardon lies with the Cabinet and <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>President.</b> This is because Article 21(1) of the Singapore Constitution provides that the President, by default, is to act {{in accordance with the}} advice of the Cabinet or a Minister acting under the general authority of the Cabinet, while Article 21(2) lays down an exhaustive range of exceptions from this rule. In situations where the President is empowered to act in his own discretion, the relevant constitutional provisions expressly use the phrase acting in his discretion in reference to the President. However, Article 22P states that the President may grant pardons [...] "on the advice of the Cabinet", which indicates a contrary intention.|$|E

5000|$|As {{unprecedented}} events {{occur in}} history {{it is necessary}} to examine current policies for adequacy.

2500|$|Clause 2 fixes {{an annual}} date upon which Congress must meet.

Some delegates to the 1787 constitutional convention believed yearly meetings were not necessary, for there would not be enough legislative business for Congress to deal with annually. Nathaniel Gorham of Massachusetts argued that the time should be fixed to prevent disputes from arising within the legislature, and to allow the states to adjust their elections to correspond with the fixed date. A fixed date also corresponded to the tradition in the states of having annual meetings. Finally, Gorham concluded that the legislative branch should be required to meet {{at least once a year}} to act as a check upon the executive department.|$|E

[...] Commenting to the media, Ravi {{said that if the}} clemency decision was indeed taken by the Cabinet and <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>President,</b> then since Shanmugam {{was a member of the}} Cabinet and these statements were made while Yong's case was sub judice, his remarks implied a prejudgment of Yong's appeal for clemency. The Ministry of Law rejected as [...] "incorrect" [...] Ravi's remarks that the clemency process was flawed. It stated that as the Government's policy on the death penalty for drug offences was a [...] "matter of public importance", the Government was entitled to comment on it. The Law Ministry also clarified that Shanmugam's comments were merely concerned with the Government's legislative policy and whether it would change, and that the Minister had not commented on any specific issue which was before the Court of Appeal at the time, or on what the outcome of the judgment should be.|$|E
2500|$|The Constitution vests the President with Executive Power. That power {{reaches its}} zenith when wielded to protect {{national}} security.

According to historian Thomas Woods, [...] "Ever since the Korean War, Article II, Section 2 [...] has been interpreted 'The president has the power to initiate hostilities without consulting Congress' [...] But what the framers actually meant by that clause was that once war has been declared, it was the President’s responsibility as commander-in-chief to direct the war. Alexander Hamilton spoke in such terms when he said that the president, although lacking the power to declare war, would have “the direction of war when authorized or begun.” The president acting alone was authorized only to repel sudden attacks (hence the decision to withhold from him only the power to “declare” war, not to “make” war, which was thought to be a necessary emergency power in case of foreign attack).
