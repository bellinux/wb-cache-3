5|$|Most organisms {{synthesize}} NAD {{from simple}} components. The {{specific set of}} reactions differs among organisms, but a common feature is the generation of quinolinic acid (QA) from an amino acid—either tryptophan (Trp) in animals and some bacteria, or aspartic acid (Asp) in some bacteria and plants. The quinolinic acid is converted to <b>nicotinic</b> <b>acid</b> mononucleotide (NaMN) by transfer of a phosphoribose moiety. An adenylate moiety is then transferred to form <b>nicotinic</b> <b>acid</b> adenine dinucleotide (NaAD). Finally, the <b>nicotinic</b> <b>acid</b> moiety in NaAD is amidated to a nicotinamide (Nam) moiety, forming nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{differences}} in the metabolic pathways of NAD biosynthesis between organisms, such as between bacteria and humans, this area of metabolism is a promising area for the development of new antibiotics. For example, the enzyme nicotinamidase, which converts nicotinamide to <b>nicotinic</b> <b>acid,</b> is a target for drug design, as this enzyme is absent in humans but present in yeast and bacteria.|$|E

5|$|FH {{is usually}} treated with statins. Statins act by {{inhibiting}} the enzyme hydroxymethylglutaryl CoA reductase (HMG-CoA-reductase) in the liver. In response, the liver produces more LDL receptors, which remove circulating LDL from the blood. Statins effectively lower cholesterol and LDL levels, although sometimes add-on therapy with other drugs is required, such as bile acid sequestrants (cholestyramine or colestipol), <b>nicotinic</b> <b>acid</b> preparations or fibrates.

25|$|The term matrix-assisted laser {{desorption}} ionization (MALDI) {{was coined}} in 1985 by Franz Hillenkamp, Michael Karas and their colleagues. These {{researchers found that}} the amino acid alanine could be ionized more easily if it was mixed with the amino acid tryptophan and irradiated with a pulsed 266nm laser. The tryptophan was absorbing the laser energy and helping to ionize the non-absorbing alanine. Peptides up to the 2843 Da peptide melittin could be ionized when mixed {{with this kind of}} “matrix”. The breakthrough for large molecule laser desorption ionization came in 1987 when Koichi Tanaka of Shimadzu Corporation and his co-workers used what they called the “ultra fine metal plus liquid matrix method” that combined 30nm cobalt particles in glycerol with a 337nm nitrogen laser for ionization. Using this laser and matrix combination, Tanaka was able to ionize biomolecules as large as the 34,472 Da protein carboxypeptidase-A. Tanaka received one-quarter of the 2002 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for demonstrating that, with the proper combination of laser wavelength and matrix, a protein can be ionized. Karas and Hillenkamp were subsequently able to ionize the 67 kDa protein albumin using a <b>nicotinic</b> <b>acid</b> matrix and a 266nm laser. Further improvements were realized {{through the use of a}} 355nm laser and the cinnamic acid derivatives ferulic acid, caffeic acid and sinapinic acid as the matrix. The availability of small and relatively inexpensive nitrogen lasers operating at 337nm wavelength and the first commercial instruments introduced in the early 1990s brought MALDI to an increasing number of researchers. Today, mostly organic matrices are used for MALDI mass spectrometry.|$|E

Subsequently, in 1949, the American biochemists Morris Friedkin and Albert L.

The discovery and introduction of effective treatments in the 1940 s resulted in a decline of the incidence of the disease until the 1980 s, which marked a sharp turn in this trend with an increase in the number of reported cases in the world. The prevalence of mycobacterial infections in poorer nations and centers of urban decay, and especially in immunologically compromised patients indicates the need for new and better treatments. In this study, to contribute to the worldwide effort to discover more effective medications against tuberculosis, 26 previously unreported compounds were synthesized and tested against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The synthesized compounds were designed to act as bioisosteres or prodrugs of pyridine and pyrazinecarboxylic acid derivatives and contained acidic or neutral hetero- or carbocyclic ring systems attached to pyridine or pyrazine rings at different positions. The synthesized ring systems included 1, 2, 4 -oxadiazole- 5 -ones, 1, 2, 4 -thiadiazole- 5 -ones, 1, 2, 4 -oxadiazole- 5 -thiones, 1, 3, 4 -oxathiazoline- 2 -ones and cyclobutene- 1, 2 -diones, which were documented in the literature to act as carboxylic acid isosteres or could act as prodrugs thereof.

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the effects of}} K+ and Na+ ions on the formation of a-cyclodextrin complexes with ionized aromatic carboxylic acids. Using solution calorimetry and H- 1 NMR, we performed the thermodynamic and structural investigation of a-cyclodextrin complex formation with benzoic and <b>nicotinic</b> <b>acids</b> in different aqueous solutions containing K and Na+ ions {{as well as in}} pure water. The experiments show that the addition of sodium ions to solution leads to a decrease in the binding constants of the carboxylic acids with a-cyclodextrin as compared to pure water and solutions containing potassium ions. From another side, the effect of potassium ions on the binding constants is insignificant as compared to pure water solution. We suggest that the selectivity of cation pairing with carboxylates is the origin of the difference between the effects of sodium and potassium ions on complex formation. The strong counterion pairing between the sodium cation and the carboxylate group shifts the equilibrium toward dissociation of the binding complexes. In turn, the weak counterion pairing between the potassium cation and the carboxylate group has no effect on the complex formation. We complemented the experiments with molecular modeling, which shows the molecular scale details of the formation of cation pairs with the carboxylate groups of the carboxylic acids. The fully atomistic molecular simulations show that sodium ions mainly form direct contact pairs with the carboxylate group. At the same time, potassium ions practically do not form direct contact pairs with the carboxylate groups and usually stay in the second solvation shell of carboxylate groups. That confirms our hypotheses that the selective formation of ion pairs is the main cause of the difference in the observed effects of sodium and potassium salts on the guest-host complex formation of a-cyclodextrin with aromatic carboxylic acids. We propose a molecular mechanism explaining the effects of salts, based on competition between the cations and a-cyclodextrin for binding with the ionized carboxylic acids...|$|R

Statin is usually the first line therapy. Combination therapy with statin and other lipid-lowering agents may be considered in some clinical settings. For patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and stable CAD, LDL-C 40 in men and > 50 mg/dL in women in DM. LDL-C increased CV risk in patients with CKD. In adults with glomerular filtration rate (GFR) < 60 mL/min/ 1. 73 m 2 without chronic dialysis (CKD stage 3 – 5), statin therapy should be initiated if LDL-C ≥ 100 mg/dL. Ezetimibe can be added to statin to consolidate the CV protection in CKD patients. Mutations in LDL receptor, apolipoprotein B and PCSK 9 genes are the common causes of FH. Diagnosis of FH usually depends on family history, clinical history of premature CAD, physical findings of xanthoma or corneal arcus and high levels of LDL-C. In addition to conventional lipid lowering therapies, adjunctive treatment with mipomersen, lomitapide, or PCSK 9 inhibitors become necessary to further reduce LDL-C in patients with FH. Overall, these recommendations are to help the health care professionals in Taiwan to treat hyperlipidemia with current scientific evidences. We hope the prescription rate of lipid lowering drugs and control rate of hyperlipidemia in high risk patients could be increased by implementation of the clinical guidelines. The major purpose is to improve clinical outcomes of these high risk patients through the control of hyperlipidemia...|$|R
