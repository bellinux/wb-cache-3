5|$|Espejo {{attacked}} Barreto's {{report in}} three ways. First, {{he claimed that}} Barreto, supposed author of the report, was not capable of writing it. Then {{he argued that the}} allegations were exaggerated semi-truths or outright lies. And finally he claimed that the economic problems of Quito could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>solved</b> by exploiting its human resources (the Indians) but by planning and taking advantage of the natural resources of the region.|$|E
5|$|After his acclamation, Maximian was {{dispatched}} {{to fight the}} rebel Bagaudae, insurgent peasants of Gaul. Diocletian returned to the East, progressing slowly. By 2 November, he had only reached Civitas Iovia (Botivo, near Ptuj, Slovenia). In the Balkans during the autumn of 285, he encountered a tribe of Sarmatians who demanded assistance. The Sarmatians requested that Diocletian either help them recover their lost lands or grant them pasturage rights within the empire. Diocletian refused and fought a battle with them, {{but was unable to}} secure a complete victory. The nomadic pressures of the European Plain remained and could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>solved</b> by a single war; soon the Sarmatians would have to be fought again.|$|E
5|$|By age 11, he had {{exhausted}} {{the mathematical}} knowledge of two {{college students who}} were lodgers at his home. He was later lent a book by S. L. Loney on advanced trigonometry. He mastered this {{by the age of}} 13 while discovering sophisticated theorems on his own. By 14, he was receiving merit certificates and academic awards that continued throughout his school career, and he assisted the school in the logistics of assigning its 1200 students (each with differing needs) to its 35-odd teachers. He completed mathematical exams in half the allotted time, and showed a familiarity with geometry and infinite series. Ramanujan was shown how to solve cubic equations in 1902; he developed his own method to solve the quartic. The following year, Ramanujan tried to solve the quintic, not knowing that it could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>solved</b> by radicals.|$|E

25|$|The {{search for}} roots of quintic and higher degree {{equations}} {{was an important}} development, the Abel–Ruffini theorem (Ruffini 1799, Abel 1824) showed that they could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>solved</b> by radicals (formulas involving only arithmetical operations and roots). Hence {{it was necessary to}} consider the wider set of algebraic numbers (all solutions to polynomial equations). Galois (1832) linked polynomial equations to group theory giving rise to the field of Galois theory.|$|E

25|$|Fisher's main {{intellectual}} rival was the Swedish economist Knut Wicksell. Fisher espoused a more succinct {{explanation of}} the quantity theory of money, resting it almost exclusively on long run prices. Wicksell's theory was considerably more complicated, beginning with interest rates {{in a system of}} changes in the real economy. Although both economists concluded from their theories that {{at the heart of the}} business cycle (and economic crisis) was government monetary policy, their disagreement would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>solved</b> in their lifetimes, and indeed, it was inherited by the policy debates between the Keynesians and monetarists beginning a half-century later.|$|E
25|$|By the 1970s, new {{problems}} such as overpopulation, limited natural resources and pollution that could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>solved</b> by normal hierarchical systems had arrived. Jay Forrester stated that {{he knew how to}} solve this problem. He applied systems theory to the problem and drew a cybernetic system diagram for the world. This was turned into a computer model, which predicted population collapse. This became the basis of the model that was used by the Club of Rome, and the findings from this were published in The Limits to Growth. Forrester then argued for zero growth in order to maintain a steady equilibrium within the capacity of the Earth.|$|E
25|$|Khan {{argued that}} for Comilla to develop rapidly, the farmers in its villages {{must be able}} to rapidly expand their {{production}} and sales. The main constraint they faced was inadequate local infrastructure, especially roads, drains, embankments and irrigation. However, even if the government had the resources to build this infrastructure, Khan argued, the problem would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>solved.</b> Once constructed, infrastructure must be regularly maintained. The benefits of it must be managed effectively based on rules that users could accept and predict. Khan thought that view it was essential to develop 'vigorous local institutions' capable of performing this type of local maintenance and management.|$|E

25|$|While Ruffini and Abel {{established}} that the general quintic could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>solved,</b> some particular quintics can be solved, such as (x1)5=0, and the precise criterion by which a given quintic or higher polynomial could be determined to be solvable or not was given by Évariste Galois, who showed that whether a polynomial was solvable or not was equivalent {{to whether or not}} the permutation group of its roots – in modern terms, its Galois group – had a certain structure – in modern terms, whether or not it was a solvable group. This group was always solvable for polynomials of degree four or less, but not always so for polynomials of degree five and greater, which explains why there is no general solution in higher degree.|$|E
25|$|In January 2005, Aurora began a 103-day world cruise {{with more}} than 1,700 {{passengers}} on board. While bound for Madeira, the ship repeatedly had problems {{with one of the}} propulsion motors. Since the problems could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>solved</b> quickly, the world cruise was abandoned. During the ship's time waiting in Southampton, passengers were offered free drinks in the onboard bars and were able to exit the ship at any time. Passengers were also permitted to cancel their booking for a full refund. After P Cruises cancelled the cruise, the company donated all of the food purchased for the trip to local charities around Southampton. Aurora set sail for a dry dock in Bremerhaven, Germany, where her damaged motor would be removed and replaced.|$|E
25|$|Setsuna being a Kurd was an {{international}} decision by Sunrise. This was done as critique to Japan's apathy towards religion. Director Seiji Mizushima {{wanted to give}} viewers a close approach to the wars in the Middle East, believing the problem would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>solved</b> in a long time. Mizushima aimed to make the viewers understand Setsuna's feelings {{as a result of}} living under war conditions. In regards to his personality, Mizushima wanted the series' protagonist that could not be related with the audience. This was done to contrast previous Gundam protagonists and appeal to young viewers. While he saw his past as difficult to understand he might look appealing as a result. The staff also wanted to create a character the audience could relate to. Late in the series, Setsuna's Quanta system was introduced in order to convey his message that he wants war to end through communication rather than violence. This idea was explored once again in the movie where the plot was written so that nobody except Setsuna could end the conflict.|$|E

500|$|The {{corporate}} {{existence of}} Harvard College {{had been thrown}} into turmoil by the recission of the colonial charter in 1684, upon which the Harvard charter depended. In 1692 the provincial assembly passed a law enacting a new charter for the college, but the Board of Trade vetoed this law in 1696, again throwing the college's existence into jeopardy. [...] Stoughton, then acting governor, made temporary arrangements for the college's governance while the assembly worked to craft a new charter. Ultimately, Harvard's charter problems would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>solved</b> until 1707, when its 1650 charter was revived.|$|E

Gauss deduced that a regular -gon {{can be constructed}} if [...] Building on Lagrange's work, Paolo Ruffini claimed (1799) that quintic equations (polynomial equations of degree 5) can <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>solved</b> algebraically, however his arguments were flawed. These gaps were filled by Abel in 1824. Évariste Galois, in 1832, devised necessary and sufficient criteria for a polynomial equation to be algebraically solvable, thus establishing in effect {{what is known as}} Galois theory today. Both Abel and Galois worked with what is today called an algebraic number field, but conceived neither an explicit notion of a field, nor of a group.|$|E
500|$|According to Oakley, the Fox censor {{objected to}} [...] "Homer's Phobia" [...] being aired. The normal {{procedure}} is for an episode's script {{to be sent}} to the censor and then faxed back with a list of lines and words that should be substituted. However, this episode came back with two pages of notes about almost every single line in the show. The censors stated that they did not like {{the use of the word}} [...] "gay", or the discussion of homosexuality at all, and closed with a paragraph which stated that [...] "the topic and substance of this episode are unacceptable for broadcast". Usually the censor notes are ignored as the offending lines and problems are dealt with after the episode has been animated. In this case, the entire episode was deemed a problem, so it could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>solved</b> in this way. The staff asked Waters if he thought the gay community would find the episode offensive. Homer's use of the word [...] "fag" [...] to insult John was his only problem, so the writers changed it to [...] "queer". The censor problems ultimately came to nothing as when the episode came back from animation in South Korea, the then-Fox president had just been fired and replaced, with the censors being replaced as well. The new censors sent back merely one line: [...] "acceptable for broadcast".|$|E

500|$|The Tetrarchs {{remained}} in Britain, {{and would probably}} have been used as training vehicles before being retired from service, but on 22 June 1941 the German invasion of the USSR, Operation Barbarossa began, and the USSR became an ally of Britain. The Lend-Lease program, begun in March 1941 by the United States of America to supply defensive materials to Britain and China, was therefore extended to the USSR. As part of the program, the British government began supplying war materials to the USSR, which in early 1942, included a shipment of 20 Tetrarchs, {{as well as a number}} of Valentine and Matilda Mk I Infantry tanks. [...] The Soviet military utilised a greater number of light tanks than the British, and so could use the Tetrarchs. When the tanks arrived in the USSR, however, it was apparent that the design problems with the cooling system were also present in cold conditions; additionally, [...] the cold weather had a deleterious effect on the tank's suspension and tracks. Additional testing of [...] the Tetrarchs was conducted by the Soviet military [...] and the design was admired for its controllability, manoeuvrability, and speed, as well its ability to run on low-quality fuel, unlike contemporary Soviet designs. The thinness of the Tetrarch's armour was found to be a problem and one which could <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>solved,</b> as the weight of extra armour plating caused an unacceptable reduction in the tank's speed. Despite these drawbacks [...] in the Tetrarch's design, Soviet authorities believed it to be comparable to the T-70 light tank in use at the time, and decided that it was suitable to be used in combat. A number of Tetrarchs were sent to Tank Training Schools which were subsequently sent into battle, and in September 1943 two were assigned to the 132nd Separated Tank Battalion, which was attached to the 5th Guards Tank Brigade; both tanks were destroyed in combat, one on 30 September and the other on 2 October, the latter a casualty of artillery fire. Several were also used for propaganda purposes, appearing in photographs of Soviet troops who were fighting in the Caucasus region.|$|E
