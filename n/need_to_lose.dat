25|$|The US Preventive Service Task Force {{reported}} {{that not all}} children with a high BMI <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> weight though. High BMI can identify a possible weight problem, but does not differentiate between fat or lean tissue. Additionally, BMI may mistakenly rule out some children who do have excess adipose tissue. It is therefore beneficial to supplement the reliability of a BMI diagnosis with additional screening tools such as adipose tissue or skin fold measurements.|$|E

He loses fifteen pounds and wins immunity as well. Joe weighs in next. He <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> at least fourteen pounds to win immunity, but has a personal goal <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> at least fifteen pounds. He exceeds both goals, losing a total of seventeen pounds. Jeff is the fourth to weigh in, and to win immunity he must also lose at least fourteen pounds. He loses a whopping nineteen pounds, demolishing his goal and securing immunity for himself. Gina is the final contestant to weigh in. Because her weight is relatively low, she is very nervous {{about being able to}} achieve the eight-pound loss <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> win immunity. Her fears turn out to be unfounded, as she successfully loses ten pounds. Because all of the contestants hit their weight-loss goals, everyone was able to stay on the ranch for another week.|$|R

50|$|The rebreather diver {{must keep}} {{breathing}} {{in and out}} all the time, to keep the exhaled gas flowing over the carbon dioxide absorbent, so the absorbent can work all the time. Divers <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> any air conservation habits {{that may have been}} developed while diving with open-circuit scuba.

50|$|Modern blimps are {{launched}} somewhat {{heavier than}} air (overweight), {{in contrast to}} historic blimps. The missing lift is provided by lifting the nose and using engine power, or by angling the engine thrust. Some types also use steerable propellers or ducted fans. Operating in a state heavier than air avoids the need to dump ballast at lift-off and also avoids the <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> costly helium lifting gas on landing (most of the Zeppelins achieved lift with very inexpensive hydrogen, which could be vented without concern to decrease altitude).|$|E
50|$|The 6 {{remaining}} girls {{arrive in}} L.A and go sight seeing; they {{then go to}} the L.A Division of NEXT Model Management to meet with manager, Alexis Borges.

At breakfast the next morning, Teryl-Leigh makes a healthy choice and eats wedges instead of chips.|$|E

In 2012, despite his republican views, Pound criticised protests arranged during Elizabeth II's Diamond Jubillee stating [...] "You can hold republican views but you respect the current monarch - particularly in this year of all years. There is no <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> your manners, and this is deliberately provocative." ...|$|E
5000|$|Damon {{has to do}} two things. First, he has to {{establish}} himself as the No. 1 at Williams for next year so the team can give him their full support. Second, he has to re-establish himself as a racer. Maybe he <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> a front wheel once or twice to re-establish himself.|$|R

50|$|At the weigh-in, Tara <b>needs</b> <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> {{four pounds}} <b>to</b> {{become the first}} woman <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> 100 pounds on the ranch. She falls just shy, at three pounds.

She loses eight pounds, making her the first woman <b>to</b> <b>lose</b> a hundred pounds on the ranch. All the players give her a wild round of applause. Ron loses ten pounds, and worries because Mike is second to last in weight loss for the week, meaning that Ron pushes his son closer to the yellow line. Ultimately, Aubrey and Filipe find {{themselves}} below the yellow line. At the vote, the players vote along original team lines, {{with all of the}} original Bob Team members voting for Aubrey, and only Tara and Laura voting for Filipe. Aubrey goes home. At home, Aubrey does not go regularly to the gym because of family demands, and gains back nine pounds in her first three weeks back home. She later loses the nine pounds that she gained plus another additional ten.|$|R
