Many of the football poems were written while the author was poet-in-residence in 2004 - 2005 for Tottenham Hotspur F.

30|$|To {{characterize}} {{the response to}} P deficiency of Nipponbare {{and one of its}} P deficiency-tolerant <b>NILs</b> (<b>NIL</b> 6 - 4) at the molecular level, we conducted a microarray (Agilent 22  k) study using root and shoot samples from plants grown in soil at two P levels. Annotations of candidate genes at the fine-mapped Pup 1 locus have not revealed any gene related to mechanisms known to directly affect P uptake or P metabolism (Heuer et al. 2009), and only two of the genes present at the Pup 1 locus are present on the Agilent 22  k array. It was therefore not the objective of this study to identify Pup 1 candidate genes but rather to identify tolerance mechanisms and regulatory patterns affected by the Pup 1 locus. In particular, we tested the hypotheses that <b>NIL</b> 6 - 4 is more tolerant to P deficiency due to the differential regulation of genes associated with (1) internal P use efficiency due to more efficient Pi remobilization; (2) enhanced P acquisition through efficient Pi uptake or soil P solubilization; and (3) modifications in root growth that maximize Pi interception. An additional objective was to differentiate stress response from stress tolerance genes.|$|R
