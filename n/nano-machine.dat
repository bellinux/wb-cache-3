40|$|In this paper, {{we develop}} a {{mathematical}} framework for modeling time-variant stochastic channels in diffusive mobile molecular communication (MC) systems. In particular, we consider a diffusive mobile MC system {{consisting of a}} pair of transmitter and receiver <b>nano-machines</b> suspended in a fluid medium with a uniform bulk flow, where we model the mobility of the <b>nano-machines</b> by Brownian motion. The transmitter and receiver <b>nano-machines</b> exchange information via diffusive signaling molecules. Due to the random movements of the transmitter and receiver <b>nano-machines,</b> the statistics of the channel impulse response (CIR) change over time. In this paper, we introduce a statistical framework for characterization of the impulse response of time-variant MC channels. To this end, we derive closed-form expressions for the mean, the autocorrelation function, the cumulative distribution function (CDF), and the probability density function (PDF) of the time-variant CIR. Given the autocorrelation function, we define the coherence time of the time-variant MC channel as a metric for characterization of the variations of the impulse response. The derived CDF is employed for calculation of the outage probability of the system. We also show that under certain conditions, the PDF of the CIR can be accurately approximated by a Log-normal distribution. Given this approximation, we derive a simple model for outdated channel state information (CSI). Moreover, we derive an analytical expression for evaluation of the expected error probability of a simple detector for the considered MC system. In order to investigate the impact of CIR decorrelation over time, we compare the performances of a detector with perfect CSI knowledge and a detector with outdated CSI knowledge. The accuracy of the proposed analytical expressions is verified via particle-based simulation of the Brownian motion. Comment: 30 pages (single column), 2 tables, 13 figures.

30|$|Herein, {{we propose}} {{a concept that}} {{is the use of}} a biomolecular motor protein of F 1 -ATPase as a nano-flow-sensor to measure the flow {{velocity}} in the proximity of a solid surface. In fact, F 1 -ATPase functions as a rotary molecular motor in a living body; the central γ-subunit rotates anticlockwise against α 3 β 3 -subunits by hydrolysis of ATP [15]. Because the size of F 1 -ATPase is about 10 nm, much less than the detection limit of an optical microscope, its rotation has been observed by coupling the γ-subunit to a nanometer-sized tag-bead that enhances the rotational motion. Our idea is that, if a flow near a surface exerts a hydrodynamic force on the F 1 -ATPase and the tag-bead complex (F 1 -bead) that is immobilized on a considered surface, the rotational motion will be affected and correlated with the near-surface flow. Therefore, the near-surface velocity can be evaluated directly if the rotation of F 1 -bead is measured. Using a biomolecule as kind a <b>nano-machine</b> might sound impractical idea, because biomolecule is usually unstable, irreproducible, etc. Realizing practical artificial <b>nano-machine</b> (nano-flow-sensor in this case) is a different issue and is technological improvements on the immediate horizon. Using forthcoming F 1 -ATPase is only the way to utilize <b>nano-machine</b> for near-surface flow measurements at present, and we believe that the obtained knowledge will be profitable for the future development of such a <b>nano-machine</b> and the related applications in nanotechnology.|$|E

A novel channel model is presented for communication of <b>nano-machines</b> inside the human skin and its validation is performed by varying the aforementioned parameters with a reasonable accuracy. The statistics of error prediction between simulated and modeled data are: mean (μ) = 0. 6 dB and standard deviation (σ) = 0. 4 dB, which indicates the high accuracy of the prediction model as compared with measurement data from simulation. In addition, the results of proposed channel model are compared with terhaertz time-domain spectroscopy based measurement of skin sample and the statistics of error prediction in this case are: μ = 2. 10 dB and σ = 6. 23 dB, which also validates the accuracy of proposed model.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} problem of {{receiver}} modeling in molecular communication systems. We consider the diffusive molecular communication channel between a transmitter <b>nano-machine</b> and a receiver <b>nano-machine</b> in a fluid environment. The information molecules released by the transmitter <b>nano-machine</b> into the environment can degrade in the channel via a first-order degradation reaction and those that reach the receiver <b>nano-machine</b> can participate in a reversible bimolecular reaction with receiver receptor proteins. Thereby, we distinguish between two scenarios. In the first scenario, {{we assume that the}} entire surface of the receiver is covered by receptor molecules. We derive a closed-form analytical expression for the expected received signal at the receiver, i. e., the expected number of activated receptors {{on the surface of the}} receiver. Then, in the second scenario, we consider the case where the number of receptor molecules is finite and the uniformly distributed receptor molecules cover the receiver surface only partially. We show that the expected received signal for this scenario can be accurately approximated by the expected received signal for the first scenario after appropriately modifying the forward reaction rate constant. The accuracy of the derived analytical results is verified by Brownian motion particle-based simulations of the considered environment, where we also show the impact of the effect of receptor occupancy on the derived analytical results.

At the nanoscale, single <b>nano-machine</b> has very limited functionalities so {{it is able to}} perform only a simple task. However, the group of <b>nano-machine</b> can perform complex tasks when they communicate among themselves. The tasks performed by those machines have applications in the field of biomedical, environmental, and military. There are various models of communication among nano machines, like electromagnetic wireless communication, molecular communication, acoustic communication, nano-mechanical communication model. In this studies, electromagnetic wireless communication model is used with the latest advancement in graphene based electronic. Graphene and its derivatives points that the frequency range of operation of future electronic nano-machines is terahertz band (0. 1 – 10. 0 THz). This band of frequency is still unlicensed and it can theoretically support a very large transmission speed. Nano-machines, due to its small size have resource constrain. Nano-machines with nano-batteries are typically characterized by a limited energy supply. Hence, to overcome the power limitation, there is a need of an energy-efficient communication paradigm. Such an energy-efficient communication paradigm is communication through silence (CtS) strategy. This strategy enables energy-efficient information transfer within the nano-machines. In CtS, information is transmitted using silence period which makes this strategy energy-efficient. This thesis is focused in this new communication paradigm, CtS. The performance from this strategy is evaluated in terms of channel capacity for both single and multiple user cases in terahertz band. A propagation model for terahertz band based on radiative transfer theory is used to calculate the total path loss and the molecular absorption noise that a travelling wave suffers.
