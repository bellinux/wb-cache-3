40|$|The {{antelope}} jackrabbit (Lepus alleni) inhabits {{the seasonal}} {{landscape of the}} subtropical Sonoran savanna grassland in southern Arizona. Basic ecological information on this understudied lagomorph is lacking beyond historical responses to rangeland conditions. This is the first study to utilize radio collars to assess space use of antelope jackrabbits. In the semidesert grassland of Buenos Aires National Wildlife Refuge, Arizona, we estimated antelope jackrabbit home range size, seasonal ranges, and movement patterns. Home range estimates were comparable to other Lepus species, however, seasonal range sizes did not differ. We analyzed antelope jackrabbit habitat structure, measured vegetation characteristics, and determined {{whether there was a}} spatial association between antelope jackrabbits and the endangered Pima <b>pineapple</b> <b>cactus</b> (Coryphantha scheeri var. robustispina). Antelope jackrabbits selected vegetation structure and characteristics similarly to available areas on the refuge. We did not detect a spatial association between antelope jackrabbits and Pima <b>pineapple</b> <b>cacti,</b> however given the importance of understanding endangered species relationships, further investigation is warranted. Our results add to the limited ecological information known about antelope jackrabbits and provide baseline data for future studies. Knowledge about spatial ecology and habitat selection helps managers and biologists make informed recommendations for land and wildlife management...|$|R
50|$|Many {{different}} {{alcoholic beverages}} {{were made from}} fermented maize, honey, <b>pineapple,</b> <b>cactus</b> fruit and other plants. The most common was octli which was made from maguey sap. It is today known as pulque, an Antillean term. It was drunk by all social classes, though some nobles {{made a point of}} not downing such a humble beverage. Drinking was tolerated, even for children at some occasions, but becoming intoxicated was not. The penalties could be very stiff, and were stricter for the elite.|$|R
40|$|Poster {{exhibited}} at GPSC Student Showcase, February 24 th, 2016, University of Arizona. There {{has been little}} research carried out which assesses the ability or inability of the Pima <b>pineapple</b> <b>cactus</b> (Coryphantha scheeri var. robustispina) to be transplanted successfully, and what a successful transplant entails. From what {{little research has been}} done, experiments have demonstrated low-levels of survival, and determinate variables remain largely unknown. As a result, the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) does not consider transplanting as a viable conservation measure. This study monitors [a population] of individual Pima <b>pineapple</b> <b>cactus</b> (PPC) transplanted in 2014 and distributed along the natural gas pipeline put in place by Kinder Morgan Inc. southwest of Tucson, Arizona, as well as other data sets from past transplant experiments. This post-transplant monitoring, in addition to a thorough analysis of varying transplant methodology and abiotic variables associated with each site, will be used to develop a framework for analyzing transplant successes for the PPC. Variables assessed during this study will include the influence of supplemental watering, using soil vs. bare root methods, and the number of times an individual is transplanted. With the information gathered from the PPC along the pipeline right-of-way, along with information gathered from historical PPC transplant locations, I will present a predictive model for transplanting success of PPC using a chi-square test with the statistical software package, STATA. Success will show a clear correlation between plant vigor after transplanting and the methodology with which each cactus was moved...|$|R
40|$|Pima <b>pineapple</b> <b>cactus</b> (Coryphantha scheeri var. robustispina) (PPC) {{is listed}} as {{endangered}} by the US Fish and Wildlife Service. This taxon occurs south of Tucson, Arizona and Sonora, Mexico. Knowledge of this plant's distribution, growth, and reproduction is important for management. Research has documented reduced plant vigor and lack of reproduction within Lehmann lovegrass stands. PPC density and seedling presence were described at five sites in two different vegetation types. Field observations of 72 plants at five sites were monitored from fall 1993 through summer of 95 and shadehouse studies were conducted. This research resulted in five conclusions: (1) fire-induced mortality of PPC {{may be related to}} Lehmann lovegrass, (2) PPC grows vegetatively in the spring, (3) flower buds are initiated in May and open after a few summer rains, (4) seed germination follows several summer rains, and (5) cross-pollination produces significantly more PPC seeds than self-pollination...|$|R
40|$|This {{review was}} {{conducted}} through public review notification and a comprehensive process including several peer reviews. An announcement in the Federal Register was published on February 2, 2005 (70 FR 5460), soliciting new information on Pima <b>pineapple</b> <b>cactus</b> (PPC) from the public. Of specific interest to us (FWS) were two {{recent studies of}} geographic variation in characters that included PPC. These two studies reached different conclusions regarding the taxonomic status of PPC. As {{part of the public}} review process, we initiated a formal peer review of the two taxonomic studies and solicited comments regarding the methods and conclusions of each study. A separate formal peer review was initiated on a preliminary population estimate that was submitted to us. Peer reviewers were chosen based on their knowledge and experience with Arizona flora, expertise in taxonomic analyses, affiliation with local herbaria, expertise in Cactaceae taxonomy, and expertise in plant population sampling. Formal requests for peer review were sent to the following individuals (those who responded are marked with an asterisk (*) ...|$|R
50|$|Succulent plants store {{water in}} their stems or leaves. They include the Cactaceae family, which has round stems and can store {{a lot of}} water. The leaves are often vestigial, {{as in the case}} of cacti, wherein the leaves are reduced to spines, or they do not have leaves at all.Xerophytes are {{commonly}} found in arid environments, where plants such as <b>pineapples</b> and <b>cacti</b> may grow. Water is stored in the bulbs of some plants, at or below ground level. They may be dormant during drought conditions and are, therefore, known as drought evaders.|$|R
40|$|Climate {{changes in}} {{temperature}} and precipitation are already occurring and {{are projected to}} further exhibit increasing temperature and precipitation extremes and increasing variation. Such increased temperature variation and decreased precipitation {{are likely to have}} a profound impact on vegetation communities, particularly in regions that are dominated by extreme temperatures and strongly seasonal precipitation events. Both temperature and precipitation are tightly linked to vegetation growth and distribution, and in regions such as the U. S. desert southwest, {{there are a number of}} rare and endangered species that have a particularly tight knit relationship with their environment. Here, I examine the relationship between these ecohydrological drivers and a specific, little- researched cactus: the Pima <b>Pineapple</b> <b>Cactus</b> (Coryphantha scheeri var. robustispina). C. scheeri is a small, hemispherical cactus that resides in the Santa Cruz and Altar Valleys of Southern Arizona, and very little is known about the conditions that promote C. scheeri distribution and growth. To provide information that may aide in managing this species, I investigate aspects of the distribution and the phenology of this species. With respect to distribution, I hypothesize that (H 1) C. scheeri locations are associated with spatial physical and climatic data within its geographic limits. A framework describing the climatic associations of C. scheeri would enable species managers to take advantage of suitable habitat when opportunities arise. With respect to phenology, within established C. scheeri habitat we lack a clear understanding of the impact ecohydrological factors can have on reproduction and size. Therefore, I also hypothesize (H 2) that C. scheeri flowering phenology is triggered by available moisture, which may be in the form of precipitation, humidity, or soil moisture. My results indicate that through the use of the classification tree, C. scheeri habitat is strongly associated with climatic and physical variables at a state-wide scale; these associations indicate large losses of suitable habitat under future projected climate scenarios. Additionally, I find that C. scheeri flowering phenology appears to be associated with precipitation and the resulting increase of soil moisture; the data are also suggestive that bud formation might be associated with water-year growing degree day. Because the results indicate a tight coupling with climatic variables, with most suitable habitat within the current range in Arizona projected to be lost under future climate, I suggest managers may be inclined to increase monitoring C. scheeri in an ecohydrological context relative to the variables identified here and to consider conditions and locations where supplemental watering or microclimate amelioration could be beneficial for the species...|$|R
25|$|The Feria Nacional del Dulce Cristalizado (National Crystallized Candy Fair) {{takes place}} {{each year in}} the Santa Cruz Acalpixca {{community}} at the Plaza Civica. This fair is dedicated to a traditional sweet of various fruits and sometimes plants, which are conserved in a sugar solution until they crystallize. These include squash, <b>pineapple,</b> nopal <b>cactus,</b> tomatoes, chili peppers, figs and more. These traditional sweets are often sold alongside others such as coconut confections, palanquetas de cacahuate (similar to peanut brittle), and nuez con leche (a nut-milk confection). These candies are the result of a blending of pre-Hispanic and European sweet traditions. The main European contributions are sugar and milk products, which are often mixed with native or other introduced ingredients. Originally, fruits and other foods were crystallized this way for conservation. Many in the community of Santa Cruz Acalpixca specialize in the making of {{one or more of these}} sweets, which began in 1927 with two shops belonging to Santiago Ramírez Olvera and Aurelio Mendoza in the Tepetitla neighborhood. In the 1980s, the town decided to hold an annual fair to promote their products, which originally was held in conjunction with the festival to the local patron saint. The event includes prizes for the best confections in several categories and the introduction of new types of candies.|$|R
