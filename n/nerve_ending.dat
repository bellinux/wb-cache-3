5|$|In normal neuromuscular function, a {{nerve impulse}} is carried down the axon (the long {{projection}} of a nerve cell) from the spinal cord. At the <b>nerve</b> <b>ending</b> in the neuromuscular junction, where the impulse {{is transferred to}} the muscle cell, the nerve impulse leads {{to the opening of}} voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCC), the influx of calcium ions into the nerve terminal, and the calcium-dependent triggering of synaptic vesicle fusion with plasma membrane. These synaptic vesicles contain acetylcholine, which is released into the synaptic cleft and stimulates the acetylcholine receptors on the muscle. The muscle then contracts.|$|E
25|$|The ciliary nerves run {{under the}} {{endothelium}} and exit the eye through {{holes in the}} sclera apart from the optic nerve (which transmits only optic signals). The nerves enter the cornea via three levels; scleral, episcleral and conjunctival. Most of the bundles give rise by subdivision to a network in the stroma, from which fibres supply the different regions. The three networks are, midstromal, subepithelial/sub-basal, and epithelial. The receptive fields of each <b>nerve</b> <b>ending</b> are very large, and may overlap.|$|E
25|$|The {{distribution}} of the sensory neurons within the skin accounts for the large and overlapping receptive fields of the skin. The size of the receptive fields in turn explains why almost any given stimulus to the human skin can potentially activate {{a very large number}} of nerve terminals. Therefore, it is more likely that a stimulus caused by the prick of a needle be detected by more than a hundred nerve endings all sharing the same receptive field, than for that same needle prick to be detected by only one <b>nerve</b> <b>ending.</b>|$|E

30|$|Labelling with 124 I {{requires}} {{the addition of}} 200 pmol iodine carrier to get efficient yields [16]. Our established specific activity results with 125 I-BoNT-A imply that this carrier aspect will {{not lead to a}} labelling problem. 124 I-BoNT-A might therefore contribute to setting up a protocol for optimal dose injection and quantification in the bladder wall in a selected panel of patients. It is very uncertain, however, whether 124 I-BoNT-A is representative for the distribution of BoNT-A through the bladder wall after intravesical injection. The heavy chain is important for docking and endocytosis of BoNT-A in the <b>nerve</b> <b>end</b> terminal, while the light chain cleaves SNAP- 25 protein in the <b>nerve</b> <b>end</b> terminal, SNAP- 25 being essential in the fusion of acetylcholine vesicles with the <b>nerve</b> <b>end</b> terminal membrane [17]. When an iodine atom on essential tyrosine moieties blocks these subtle processes, it means that the PET signal of the 124 I-BoNT-A molecule does not reflect the behaviour of an unlabelled BoNT-A molecule at cellular level.|$|R

25|$|Thermal nociceptors are {{activated}} by noxious heat or cold at various temperatures. There are specific nociceptor transducers {{that are responsible}} for how and if the specific <b>nerve</b> <b>ending</b> responds to the thermal stimulus. The first to be discovered was TRPV1, and it has a threshold that coincides with the heat pain temperature of 42°C. Other temperature in the warm–hot range is mediated by more than one TRP channel. Each of these channels express a particular C-terminal domain that corresponds to the warm–hot sensitivity. The interactions between all these channels and how the temperature level is determined to be above the pain threshold are unknown at this time. The cool stimuli are sensed by TRPM8 channels. Its C-terminal domain differs from the heat sensitive TRPs. Although this channel corresponds to cool stimuli, it is still unknown whether it also contributes in the detection of intense cold. An interesting finding related to cold stimuli is that tactile sensibility and motor function deteriorate while pain perception persists.|$|E
500|$|In LEMS, {{antibodies}} against VGCC, {{particularly the}} P/Q-type VGCC, decrease {{the amount of}} calcium that can enter the <b>nerve</b> <b>ending,</b> hence less acetylcholine can be released from the neuromuscular junction. Apart from skeletal muscle, the autonomic nervous system also requires acetylcholine neurotransmission; this explains the occurrence of autonomic symptoms in LEMS. P/Q voltage-gated calcium channels are {{also found in the}} cerebellum, explaining why some experience problems with coordination. The antibodies bind particularly to the part of the receptor known as the [...] "domain III S5–S6 linker peptide". Antibodies may also bind other VGCCs. Some have antibodies that bind synaptotagmin, the protein sensor for calcium-regulated vesicle fusion. Many people with LEMS, both with and without VGCC antibodies, have detectable antibodies against the M1 subtype of the acetylcholine receptor; [...] their presence may participate in a lack of compensation for the weak calcium influx.|$|E
50|$|A free <b>nerve</b> <b>ending</b> (FNE) or bare <b>nerve</b> <b>ending,</b> is an unspecialized, {{afferent nerve}} fiber ending of a sensory neuron.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{model is}} presented for studying nerve regeneration over gaps of various lengths between the {{both ends of}} a severed nerve. After transferring left and right sciatic nerves of rat to the back, {{the gap between the}} two <b>nerve</b> <b>ends</b> could be bridged by a preformed, tube-shaped mesothelial chamber of a desired length. When the gap length was 10 mm or less, a well developed nerve structure was generated in the chamber between the <b>nerve</b> <b>ends,</b> and axons from the left sciatic nerve reinnervated muscles in the right limb via the right sciatic nerve. When the gap length was extended to 15 mm or more no such regeneration occurred. When no distal <b>nerve</b> <b>end</b> was introduced into the chamber, there was a limited growth into this chamber over only 5 - 6 mm. This "limited growth phenomenon" is discussed with respect to a lack of "trophic" or cellular support from a distal nerve segment. It is also proposed that the termination of growth, seen under these circumstances, may suggest a new principle for avoiding the development of neuromas after nerve transections...|$|R

A {{little more}} {{attention}} {{must now be}} given to the detailed anatomy of the peripheral and central <b>nerve</b> <b>ends.</b> A <b>nerve,</b> as we have pointed out, terminates centrally in some ganglion cell, either in a ganglion or in the spinal cord or brain; peripherally there is a much greater variety of ending. We may have tactile (touch) ends of various kinds, and the similar olfactory and gustatory end organs; or the nerve may conduct efferent impressions, and terminate in a gland which it excites to secretion, in a muscle end-plate, or in fact, anywhere, where kataboly can be set going and energy disengaged.

40|$|Background: Ligamentum flavum {{normally}} has neural ends {{so it has}} sensory {{role and}} helps to protect vertebral column against different injuries. The {{aim of this study}} was to detect the neural ends in ligamentum flavum in patients with discopathy.

40|$|Morphological {{studies have}} {{indicated}} that proximal <b>nerve</b> <b>ends</b> of transected rat sciatic nerves regenerating into preformed mesothelial chambers show a different organization as compared to neuromas developed in contact with a muscle fascia. We have studied the physiological properties of nerve fibres arising from these types of preparations with reference to ongoing activity, response to mechanical stimulation and noradrenaline sensitivity. The study included also fibres arising from ligated and encapsulated neuromas. Fibres with ongoing activity arising from the neuroma could be found from neuromas in contact with a muscle fascia and also from ligated and encapsulated neuromas. This ongoing activity was enhanced by mechanical stimulation and i. v. infusion of noradrenaline. In contrast, fibres arising from proximal <b>nerve</b> <b>ends</b> in mesothelial chambers did not show ongoing activity. These silent fibres responded dynamically to light mechanical stimulation.

30|$|Functional {{recovery}} {{following a}} severe {{peripheral nerve injury}} is a daunting challenge {{in the field of}} neuroscience. After nerve transection, collapse and sealing of the axonal membranes at each nerve stump lead to the formation of either a growth cone or a retraction bulb. As part of the initial response after injury, myelin breaks down and axonal degeneration occurs at both the proximal and distal nerve stumps further increasing the gap between the <b>nerve</b> <b>ends.</b> Peripheral <b>nerves</b> are able to effectively regenerate over short distances; however, when the space between <b>nerve</b> <b>ends</b> is too wide (greater than 2 cm), surgical intervention is required to reconnect the damaged nerve using nerve grafts [1 – 3]. Currently, the gold standard for this type of peripheral nerve injury repair is surgical implantation of autologous nerve grafts. However, autographs have many clinical limitations including donor site morbidity, mismatch of donor size, neuropathic pain, and limited donor nerve length [4, 5].|$|R
25|$|Because of {{the limited}} {{functionality}} received from autografts, the current gold standard for nerve regeneration and repair, recent neural tissue engineering {{research has focused on}} the development of bioartificial nerve guidance conduits in order to guide axonal regrowth.

40|$|Since {{vertical}} tissue sections {{used for}} the study of the human cutaneous nervous system inherently allow visualization of only a small part of the mainly horizontally oriented cutaneous nerves, we searched for possibilities to extend this view. We now propose a method based on the immuno-staining of dermal sheet preparations for subsequent analysis by electron-, light- or laser scanning microscopy. Dermal sheet preparations for the first time allowed the imaging of the complex structure of the <b>nerve</b> <b>end</b> organ over several cm 2, and facilitated viewing of its topological relationship to other tissue components. We could visualize that the bulk of free <b>ending</b> <b>nerve</b> fibers ramified within 25 μm of the dermo-epidermal junction, whereas below that only larger nerve bundles were present. This method further allowed the detection and quantification of NCAM/CD 56 + non-myelinating Schwann cells which envelope terminal axons within the dermis. Depending on the body region, we detected between 140 to over 300 individual terminal Schwann cells per mm 2 skin surface. Our method should allow the acquisition of new insights into the highly organized architecture of the skin <b>nerve</b> <b>end</b> organ. Its further application will give new impetus in the investigation of alterations of this skin compartment under pathological conditions...|$|R
