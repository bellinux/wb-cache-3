25|$|Beginning in {{the mid-19th}} century, Vermont {{attracted}} numerous Irish, Scots-Irish and Italian immigrants, adding to its residents of mostly English and French-Canadian ancestry. Many migrated to Barre, {{where the men}} worked as stonecutters of granite, for which there was a <b>national</b> <b>market.</b> Vermont granite was used in major public buildings in many states. Many Italian and Scottish women operated boarding houses in the late 19th century to support their families. Such facilities helped absorb new residents, who peaked between 1890 and 1900.

From this fact we can appreciate the capacity that Angola has to increase production for not only for the <b>national</b> <b>market</b> but also the international one. Investing in this sector can help reduce unemployment and more specifically in the rural areas. This will undoubtedly have consequences on the living standard of rural civilians.|$|E

While some regarded sound as irreconcilable with film art, others saw it as opening a new field of creative opportunity.

Such a method for constructing the sound-film will not confine it to a <b>national</b> <b>market,</b> as must happen with the photographing of plays, but will give a greater possibility than ever before for the circulation throughout the world of a filmically expressed idea." [...] So far as one segment of the audience was concerned, however, the introduction of sound brought a virtual end to such circulation: Elizabeth C. Hamilton writes, [...] "Silent films offered people who were deaf a rare opportunity to participate in a public discourse, cinema, on equal terms with hearing people. The emergence of sound film effectively separated deaf from hearing audience members once again." ...|$|E

40|$|This article conceptually {{explores the}} {{determinants}} of strategic options in multinational market competition. It draws on and integrates three research streams in strategy and international management: action and response in competitive rivalry; multipoint competition, and global competition and strategy. Specifically, it examines the various factors that determine whether and when a multinational corporation (MNC), while under attack from a rival MNC, will adopt the following responses: doing nothing, defending, counterattack, and total war. Those factors are organized into four categories: (1) types of attack, including price cut, introduction of new product, entry into new market, and advertising campaign; (2) awareness of interdependence of multinational markets, determined by market overlap, MNC strategy, and MNC organization; (3) motivation for globally coordinated moves, determined by the centrality of <b>national</b> <b>markets,</b> strategic importance of <b>national</b> <b>markets,</b> perceived importance of <b>national</b> <b>markets,</b> and perceived importance of rivals; and (4) feasibility of response, determined by entry barriers and diversity of <b>national</b> <b>markets</b> as well as resource heterogeneity and differential between rival MNCs. The effects of these four categories of factors on the choice of response are explored respectively. Research implications are offered in concluding remarks.
