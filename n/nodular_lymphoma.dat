Nuclei with such a large area and shallow invaginations are not present within the nonneoplastic germinal centers.

Higher incidence of aggressive lymphomas such as Burkitt’s and Lymphoblastic lymphoma in the Bedouin as in other Arab populations may have a common mechanism. This may indicate genetic and environmental factors that are responsible for the greater presentation of aggressive histological subtypes in Bedouin compared to the Jewish population. Because of the small number of patients in this study, we cannot evaluate accurately how this study represents the distribution of histological subtypes of Lymphoma among all the population, and especially among the Jewish population in Israel.|$|E
40|$|Summary. -To {{substantiate}} {{the origin}} of follicular (<b>nodular)</b> <b>lymphoma</b> cells from germinal-centre cells, the lymphoma cells from 7 patients with follicular lymphoma and from 9 tonsils and 2 lymph nodes were studied for the presence and distribution of complement-receptor subtypes (i. e., the receptors for C 3 b and C 3 d).

In adults the histological pattern at initial biopsy was interpreted as <b>nodular</b> <b>lymphoma</b> in 33 % and as diffuse lymphoma in 67 %. Diffuse histiocytic was the most frequently observed histological subtype in the present series (54 %). Diffuse undifferentiated lymphoma was noted in 2 / 6 children. Waldeyer's ring involvement was noted in 27 % of adult patients. Systemic symptoms were present in 7 %. Surgery detected occult lesions in 27 % of patients (para-aortic nodes 3 %, spleen 12 %, liver 12 %, coeliac nodes 15 %, splenic hilar nodes 26 %, mesenteric nodes 15 %, gastrointestinal tract 1 %, bone marrow 12 %).

40|$|A {{retrospective}} analysis of 133 patients with localized nodal and extranodal non-Hodgkin's lymphomata whose staging investigations included marrow aspirate and lymphography shows {{that more than}} 60 % remain alive and disease-free 4 years after initial therapy. Further relapses may occur in this group, particularly in the nodular lymphomata, {{but so far the}} majority of relapses and three quarters of the deaths from disease have occurred within 2 years of diagnosis. Of the entire group of patients, only 15 % showed an unequivocally nodular pattern and a further 25 % a partially nodular, partially diffuse pattern. Thus, 60 % of patients had diffuse lymphoma but differences were observed depending upon the site of presentation. In the nodal Stages I and II cases, whereas only 4 of 55 patients with supradiaphragmatic disease showed a nodular pattern, 12 of 24 infradiaphragmatic presentations had <b>nodular</b> <b>lymphoma.</b> This difference was reflected in a lower relapse rate in the latter group.

40|$|The {{cells of}} the lymphoreticular system are {{heterogeneous}} both morphologically and functionally. The bone marrow derived (B) lymphocyte can be identified {{by the presence of}} easily detectable surface immunoglobulin and a receptor for antigen-antibody-complement (EAC) complexes. Monocytes and histiocytes also bear a receptor for EAC and in addition possess a receptor for cytophilic antibody detected with red cell [...] IgG complexes (IgGEA). In man, thymus derived (T) lymphocytes form non-immune rosettes with sheep red blood cells (E). We have examined a number of malignant lymphoreticular populations for the presence of the EAC, EA, and E receptors on suspensions of cells and have adapted the technique to demonstrate the EAC and EA receptors on frozen tissue sections. Rosetted malignant cells can also be cytologically examined on Millipore filters. The malignant cells both in section and suspension from the spleens and lymph nodes of 6 patients with <b>nodular</b> <b>lymphoma</b> bound EAC but not IgGEA or E; by these criteria these malignant cells are of B lymphocytic origin. The malignant cells from the spleens of 2 patients with leukaemic reticuloendotheliosis and 1 patient with malignant histiocytosis could be classified as being of histiocytic origin by the selective binding of IgGEA. In 3 cases of diffuse lymphocytic lymphoma the malignant cells bound only E and are therefore of T lymphocytic origin.

In standard texts, Hodgkin’s lymphoma is classified as 2 distinct entities, namely nodular lymphocyte predominant Hodgkin’s lymphoma and classical Hodgkin’s lymphoma.

Although the mixed cellularity and lymphocyte-depleted subtypes may be part of a biologic continuum, the nodular sclerosis subtype has a distinct epidemiology, clinical presentation, and histology. <b>Nodular</b> sclerosis Hodgkin’s <b>lymphoma,</b> particularly those cases presenting with mediastinal disease, also seems related to primary mediastinal B-cell lym-phoma.

40|$|Cytochemical {{identification}} of T lymphocytes {{on the basis}} of alpha-naphthyl acetate esterase (NAE) activity was compared with immunologic markers for cell suspensions and/or cryostat sections of 113 specimens. Nonneoplastic tissues (peripheral blood, lymph nodes, spleens, tonsils, thymus, and pleural fluid) and specimens from various lymphoproliferative disorders, including acute and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, lymphosarcoma cell leukemia, hairy cell leukemia, non-Hodgkin's lymphomas of B-and T-cell types, and Hodgkin's disease, were evaluated. T (E-rosetting) cells demonstrated several patterns of NAE reactivity: 1) a strong globular reaction product, the most specific pattern for T-cell identification, 2) granular cytoplasmic staining, or 3) no reactivity. B lymphocytes revealed a granular pattern of NAE staining, were devoid of enzyme, or, in rare instances, exhibited strong NAE activity. Percentages of lymphoid cells with strong (globular) NAE activity closely paralleled T-cell (E-rosette) values in the majority of cases, with the best correlations observed for peripheral blood studies. However, discordant results were noted for some neoplastic and nonneoplastic tissues, including cases of T-cell lymphoma or leukemia. Markedly discrepant results were noted for thymic lymphocytes, most of which revealed E-rosette formation and weak or absent NAE activity. Lymph nodes involved by Hodgkin's disease demonstrated a heterogeneous pattern of staining in E-rosetting cells and in Reed-Sternberg variants. Cryostat section studies of reactive lymph nodes and <b>nodular</b> <b>lymphomas</b> demonstrated strong NAE staining in lymphoid cells of T-cell (interfollicular, internodular) areas, with little or no positivity in follicles or nodules (B-cell areas). NAE staining patterns further suggested that T cells comprise part of the follicular cuff and possibly represent a minor population of some neoplastic nodules. Although NAE determinations do not represent a consistently reliable alternative to immunologic methods for T-cell identification, this easily applicable cytochemical marker is complementary to other techniques in assessing neoplastic or nonneoplastic tissues, particularly cryostat sections.
