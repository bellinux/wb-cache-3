40|$|Abstract — Modern {{heterogeneous}} networks {{present a}} great challenge for network operators and engineers from a management and configuration perspective. The Network Discovery System is a network management framework that addresses these challenges. NDS offers centralized <b>network</b> <b>configuration</b> <b>management</b> functionality, along with providing options for extending the framework with additional features. The devices managed by NDS are stored in its Configuration Database (CDB). However, currently there is no mechanism for automatically adding network devices to the configuration of NDS, thus each device’s management parameters have to be entered manually. The goal {{of this paper is}} to develop a software module for NDS that simplifies the process of initial NDS configuration by allowing NDS to automatically add network devices to the ND CDB Apart from developing the software module for discovery, this paper aims to summarize existing methods and to develop new methods for automated discovery of network devices with the main focus on differentiating between different types of devices. A credential-based device discovery method was developed and utilized to make advantage of known credentials to access devices, which allows for more precise discovery compared to some other existing methods. The selected methods were implemented as a component of NDS to provide device discovery functionality. Python language is used as tool to develop code...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Network {{functionality}} {{is growing}} increasingly complex, making <b>network</b> <b>configuration</b> <b>management</b> a steadily growing challenge. Router configurations capture and reflect {{all levels of}} network operation, and it is highly challenging to manage the detailed configurations of the potentially huge number of routers that run a network. One source of difficulty is the constant evolution of router configuration languages. For some languages, particularly Cisco’s IOS command language, and its relatives, these changes demand frequent maintenance of configuration parsers in any configuration management tool. The essential problem is that config parsers understand a statically determined set of inputs, requiring human intervention to modify that set. We propose an alternative design for router configuration parsers: adaptive parsers. Such parsers can infer the configuration language based on real configs and automatically adapt {{to changes in the}} config language, all with minimal human involvement. We present the design of such a parser and discuss its prototype implementation for the Cisco IOS configuration language. We have validated our prototype’s accuracy and efficiency by running it on the configuration files of Tier- 1 ISP networks. Our results show that from only 81 configuration files, we can learn enough IOS to successfully parse all of the 819 IOS configurations in under 10 minutes. I...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Electrical and Computer EngineeringWith the {{increasing}} complexity of Aircraft Data Network {{the need for}} configuration management has become a necessity as the tolerance level is absolutely minimal. It is also known {{that most of the}} network faults are due to invalid configurations on the network devices. As fault detection plays a vital role in detecting invalid configurations, configuration management forms its basis. The aim of <b>network</b> <b>configuration</b> <b>management</b> is to supervise the network information so that the changes on networks can be tracked and managed. Also the topology of network can be better understood with each device’s configured parameters (interface settings, routing protocols etc). With the existing web based framework for Aircraft Data Network, we could use it for configuration management by adding a few more modules. The reason for using web based is that it can be controlled remotely and its ease of use. And also our web based architecture uses secure protocols and a centralized database. Mobile agents are used to carry the necessary data to configure the nodes in the network. The suggested framework would reduce the complexity of network configuration as well as improve the performance with reduced network time-delays and information bottlenecks...|$|E
