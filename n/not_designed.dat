5|$|A {{complementary}} telescope, {{looking at}} even longer wavelengths than Hubble or JWST, was the European Space Agency's Herschel Space Observatory, launched on May 14, 2009. Like JWST, Herschel was <b>not</b> <b>designed</b> to be serviced after launch, {{and had a}} mirror substantially larger than Hubble's, but observed only in the far infrared and submillimeter. It needed helium coolant, of which it ran out on April 29, 2013.|$|E
5|$|A second {{full-size}} {{replica of}} Endeavour is berthed on the River Tees in Stockton-on-Tees.

5|$|Although most {{computer}} {{languages are}} <b>not</b> <b>designed</b> with commands or libraries for matrices, {{as early as}} the 1970s, some engineering desktop computers such as the HP 9830 had ROM cartridges to add BASIC commands for matrices. Some computer languages such as APL were designed to manipulate matrices, and various mathematical programs can be used to aid computing with matrices.|$|E
50|$|Ibarra did <b>not</b> <b>design,</b> engrave, or cast types, {{contrary}} to what is often assumed. The error is probably based on the documents in his edition of Don Quixote of the Royal Academy, for which they made a new cast (but <b>not</b> a new <b>design).</b>|$|R

5|$|Banglapedia was <b>not</b> <b>designed</b> as {{a general}} {{encyclopedia}} but as a specialized encyclopedia on Bangladesh-related topics.

5|$|On 20 {{missions}} (1983â€“98) the Space Shuttle carried Spacelab, {{designed in}} cooperation with the European Space Agency (ESA). Spacelab was <b>not</b> <b>designed</b> for independent orbital flight, but remained in the Shuttle's cargo bay as the astronauts entered and left it through an airlock. Another famous series of missions were the launch and later successful repair of the Hubble Space Telescope in 1990 and 1993, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Past the Garden State Parkway, Route 3 {{eventually}} {{turns into}} a six-lane freeway that is <b>not</b> <b>designed</b> to Interstate Highway standards. It interchanges with County Route 622 (Bloomfield Avenue), then intersects County Route 603 (Passaic Avenue), which heads south into Nutley to become Route 7. The next interchange is for County Route 601 (Main Avenue). Past that interchange, Route 3 comes to an interchange with Route 21, then passes over the route.|$|E

50|$|A modern {{instrument}} {{similar in}} concept, if <b>not</b> <b>design,</b> is the wheel harp, created by Jon Jones and Mitchell Manger in 2013, and debuted at the NAMM Show that year, in Anaheim, California.|$|R
5|$|Seoul {{was also}} {{the focal point of}} Korea's highway network. It also had several crucial {{connection}} points to the Soviet Union and China, but it was <b>not</b> <b>designed</b> for military traffic and the weather conditions made travel on the roads difficult. Overall the roads into Korea provided only 48 percent of the capacity of the railroads.|$|E
5|$|The President of the Italian Republic has an {{official}} standard. The current version {{is based on}} the square flag of the Napoleonic Italian Republic, on a field of blue, charged with the coat of arms in gold. Prior to this the field was solid blue. The current coat of arms, more accurately called an emblem as it was <b>not</b> <b>designed</b> to conform to traditional heraldic rules, was adopted in place of the royal arms on 5 May 1948.|$|E
5|$|The iPad syncs with iTunes on a Mac or Windows PC.

5|$|The main {{features}} of late Roman fortification clearly presage those of medieval castles. But the defensibility of late Roman forts {{must not be}} exaggerated. Late Roman forts were not always located on defensible sites, such as hilltops and they were <b>not</b> <b>designed</b> as independent logistic facilities where the garrison could survive for years on internal supplies (water in cisterns or from wells and stored food). They remained bases for troops that would sally out and engage the enemy in the field.|$|E
5|$|These animals exploit more {{man-made}} environments like docks for haul-out sites. Many docks are <b>not</b> <b>designed</b> {{to withstand}} the weight of several resting sea lions which cause major tilting and other problems. Wildlife managers have used various methods to control the animals and some city officials have redesigned docks so they can better withstand them.|$|E
5|$|Alternative {{theories}} {{have been proposed}} for the diet of aetosaurs. In 1947, H J Sawin proposed that the aetosaur Longosuchus was a scavenger based on the close proximity of some specimens to {{a large number of}} skeletons that were likely carcasses. A 2009 study of the jaw biomechanics of the South American genus Neoaetosauroides suggested that the animal may have fed on larvae and insects without hard exoskeletons. This is because Neoaetosauroides lacks serrations or wear facets on the teeth and has a jaw leverage that is <b>not</b> <b>designed</b> for strong forces such as crushing and chopping. The study recognized that northern aetosaurs such as Desmatosuchus and Stagonolepis did have jaws that would have supported a strong musculature, and were likely better suited to eating plant material.|$|E
25|$|Architects and Landscape Architects may <b>not</b> <b>design</b> all the {{pathways}} {{of a complex}} of buildings. Instead they might let usage patterns emerge and then place pavement where pathways have become worn, such as a desire path.|$|R
