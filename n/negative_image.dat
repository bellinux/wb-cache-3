5|$|The {{development}} of Nazi propaganda in occupied Poland {{can be divided}} into two main phases. Initial efforts were directed towards creating a <b>negative</b> <b>image</b> of pre-war Poland, and later efforts were aimed at fostering anti-Soviet, antisemitic, and pro-German attitudes.|$|E
5|$|Birds {{have been}} seen as symbols, and used as such, though {{perceptions}} of bird species vary widely across cultures: some birds have a positive image in some regions, a <b>negative</b> <b>image</b> in others. Owls are associated with bad luck, witchcraft, and death in parts of Africa, but are regarded as wise across much of Europe. Hoopoes were considered sacred in Ancient Egypt and symbols of virtue in Persia, but were thought of as thieves across much of Europe, and harbingers of war in Scandinavia.|$|E
5|$|Keeler {{found it}} {{difficult}} to escape the <b>negative</b> <b>image</b> attached to her by press, law and parliament throughout the Profumo affair. In various, sometimes contradictory accounts, she has challenged Denning's conclusions relating to security issues. Ward's conviction has been described by analysts as an act of Establishment revenge, rather than serving justice. In January 2014 his case was under review by the Criminal Cases Review Commission, with the possibility of a later reference to the Court of Appeal. Dramatisations of the Profumo affair have been shown on stage and screen.|$|E
40|$|Aims: The aim of {{the study}} was to examine attentional bias towards {{positive}} and <b>negative</b> <b>images</b> amongst men with intellectual disabilities, some of whom had a history of criminal offending. A secondary aim was to explore the relationship between attentional bias, empathy and distorted cognitions. Method: Forty-six men with intellectual disabilities with a history of criminal offending and 51 men with intellectual disabilities without any known history of criminal offending were recruited and invited to complete a dot-probe paradigm using images, as well as measures of distorted cognitions and empathy. Comparisons were made between the two groups. Results: Non-offenders had a significant attentional bias away from <b>negative</b> <b>images,</b> while offenders had a small attentional bias towards <b>negative</b> <b>images.</b> There was a significant positive relationship between distorted cognitions and an attentional bias towards <b>negative</b> <b>images.</b> There was a significant negative relationship between empathy and an attentional bias towards <b>negative</b> <b>images...</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper examined, with a {{behavioral}} paradigm, {{to what extent}} people choose to view stimuli that portray death, violence or harm. Based on briefly presented visual cues, participants made choices between highly arousing, <b>negative</b> <b>images</b> and positive or negative alternatives. The <b>negative</b> <b>images</b> displayed social scenes that involved death, violence or harm (e. g., war scene), or decontextualized, close-ups of physical harm (e. g., mutilated face) or natural threat (e. g., attacking shark). The results demonstrated that social <b>negative</b> <b>images</b> were chosen significantly more often than other negative categories. Furthermore, participants preferred social <b>negative</b> <b>images</b> over neutral images. Physical harm images and natural threat images were not preferred over neutral images, but were chosen in about thirty-five percent of the trials. These results were replicated across three different studies, including a study that presented verbal descriptions of images as pre-choice cues. Together, these results show that people deliberately subject themselves to <b>negative</b> <b>images.</b> With this, the present paper demonstrates a dynamic relationship between negative information and behavior and advances {{new insights into the}} phenomenon of morbid curiosity...|$|R

5|$|During filming in Sierra Gorda, Chile, {{the local}} mayor, Carlos Lopez, staged a protest {{because he was}} angry at the filmmakers' {{portrayal}} of the Antofagasta Region as part of Bolivia. He was arrested, detained briefly, and put on trial two days later. Eon dismissed his claim that they needed his permission to film in the area. Michael G. Wilson explained that Bolivia was appropriate to the plot, because of the country's history of water problems, and was surprised the two countries disliked each other a century after the War of the Pacific. In a poll by Chilean daily newspaper La Segunda, 75% of its readers disagreed with Lopez's actions, due to the <b>negative</b> <b>image</b> of Chile they felt it presented, and the controversy's potential to put off productions looking to film {{in the country in}} the future.|$|E
5|$|Its {{mixture of}} genres makes The General in His Labyrinth {{difficult}} to classify, and commentators disagree over where it {{lies on the}} scale between novel and historical account. García Márquez's insertion of interpretive and fictionalized elements—some dealing with Bolívar's most intimate moments—caused outrage in parts of Latin America when the book was released. Many prominent Latin American figures believed that the novel damaged the reputation {{of one of the}} region's most important historic figures and portrayed a <b>negative</b> <b>image</b> to the outside world. Others saw The General in His Labyrinth as a tonic for Latin American culture and a challenge to the region to deal with its problems.|$|E
5|$|Polls {{consistently}} {{indicated a}} tight {{race for the}} November general election. Negative ads from both sides dominated the campaign, with Obama's proclaiming that Romney shipped jobs overseas while at Bain Capital and kept money in offshore tax havens and Swiss bank accounts. A related issue dealt with Romney's purported responsibility for actions at Bain Capital after taking the Olympics post. Romney faced demands from Democrats to release additional years of his tax returns, an action a number of Republicans also felt would be wise; after being adamant {{that he would not}} do that, he released summaries of them in late September. During May and June, the Obama campaign spent heavily and was able to paint a <b>negative</b> <b>image</b> of Romney in voters' minds before the Romney campaign could construct a positive one.|$|E
25|$|In the study, {{researchers}} created {{two versions}} of the same news story – one with compelling <b>negative</b> <b>images</b> and one without. Participants were asked to watch a 20 minute news video (half of the participants saw the <b>negative</b> <b>images</b> and the other half did not) and an additional ten-minute video. They were instructed to pay attention because they would be tested afterwards. A follow up survey was sent 6 to 7 weeks later to measure memory and recall from the news video. The results support the idea that people better remember information that comes after a negative event. Respondents who viewed the <b>negative</b> <b>images</b> better remembered {{the second half of the}} newscast than the part preceding the <b>negative</b> <b>images.</b> The findings of this study further support the media equation assumption that mediated experiences are the same as natural experiences.|$|R
40|$|This article exposes and interrogates Chirikureâ€™s {{depiction}} of autochthony. It {{is an effort}} towards discussing Chirikureâ€™s social vision which is torn between positive and <b>negative</b> <b>images</b> of Africa. It establishes that a sharp sense of belonging manifests in Chirikureâ€™s poetry but such a sense is clouded by a pessimistic attitude to life which breaks the ability to transform Africansâ€™ lives positively. This effort is energized {{by the idea that}} as Eurocentric critics have invested and continue to invest their time and energy in projecting <b>negative</b> <b>images</b> of Africa, Chirikure is committed to challenging the Eurocentric dehumanization of Africa with a view to empower African multitudes. While Chirikure challenges Eurocentric perceptions of Africa which by and large benefit the creators of the stultifying <b>negative</b> <b>images</b> of Africa by crippling Africansâ€™ sense of belonging, such a literary position is obliterated by the stultifying <b>negative</b> <b>images</b> of Africa in some of his selected poems. While Chirikure celebrates indigeneity or autochthony, this sense is clouded by Afropessimism and such a literary position kills the creative force. The rallying point of the article is that <b>negative</b> <b>images</b> of Africa break the spirit to struggle while positive images are developmental and liberating...|$|R

5|$|Mackintosh {{arrived in}} Australia in October 1914 {{to take up}} his duties, and was {{immediately}} faced with major difficulties. Without warning or notification, Shackleton had cut the Ross Sea party's allocated funds in half, from £2,000 to £1,000. Mackintosh was instructed {{to make up the}} difference by soliciting free gifts, and to mortgage the expedition's ship to raise further money. It then emerged that the purchase of Aurora had not been legally completed, which delayed Mackintosh's attempts to mortgage it. Also, Aurora was unfit for Antarctic work without an extensive overhaul, which required co-operation from an exasperated Australian Government. The task of dealing with these difficulties within a very restricted timescale caused Mackintosh great anxiety, and the various muddles created a <b>negative</b> <b>image</b> of the expedition in the eyes of the Australian public. Some members of the party resigned, others were dismissed; recruiting a full complement of crew and scientific staff involved some last-minute appointments which left the party noticeably short of Antarctic experience.|$|E
5|$|The outdoor {{scene in}} which Xander sees Buffy in the sandbox was {{intentionally}} overexposed, intensifying the foreground and blowing out the background, making the sky look white; flash frames were also used in the shot of Buffy in the desert. Whedon allowed some shots to last far longer than is common in a television episode; this cinematic technique allowed the images to take on meaning. Highly stylized lighting is used throughout Xander's dream. In the university hallway the scene is lit with green and orange gels, while the almost shot-for-shot re-creation of the Apocalypse Now section is lit with carefully controlled spotlights which allow the background to fall out to black. Whedon cites The Limey as an inspiration for the unnaturally colored university sequence, and had the scene from Apocalypse Now playing on tape during filming to ensure as close a match as possible for that sequence. When Xander is driving the ice cream truck with Anya, the backgrounds outside the car intentionally look fake, to {{give a sense of}} stillness where there should be motion. Whedon originally wanted to use rear-screen projection for the driving scene, but had to utilize greenscreen instead, as rear-screen projection would be difficult to set up on their stages. Some special effects shots came about by accident; in his commentary Whedon explains that when Buffy smeared the mud all over her face, it looked as though she was giving herself a facial. He therefore dissolved the shot into a <b>negative</b> <b>image,</b> creating intense colors that made the shot more interesting.|$|E

40|$|Emotional imagery elicits {{enhanced}} {{physiological and}} cognitive responses. The present study investigates how combat experience influences emotional and cognitive processes. Physiological responses (SCR & EEG) were recorded while paJ 1 ici pants (combat veterans and non-combat civilians) viewed neutral and emotional images. The emotional images were organized into categories consisting of negative non-aggressive, negative aggressive and negative combat. PaJ 1 icipants also rated each picture on arousal, dominance and valence {{according to the}} SAM scale. Combat veteran participants rated the <b>negative</b> <b>images</b> less <b>negative</b> than non-combat civilian participants. Combat veteran participants also gave higher dominance ratings to the <b>negative</b> <b>images</b> which suggest they felt more {{in control of their}} emotions during the viewing of the images than the non-combat civilian paJ 1 icipants. Finally, combat veterans 3 rated the <b>negative</b> <b>images</b> as less arousing than the non-combat civilian participants. Combat veteran's physiological responses for negative combat and <b>negative</b> aggressive <b>images</b> were significantly higher than for the neutral and <b>negative</b> non-aggressive <b>images.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the impact of}} {{increasing the number of}} images in a print advertisement on affective and cognitive responses.

Background: Prior research shows that trust in automation can be affected by various manipulations of the automation, but little has been done in priming participants prior to interactions with automation. Methods: Participants were first shown positive or <b>negative</b> <b>images</b> of real-world automation, and then were asked to complete a combat identification task. Results: The data revealed that priming positive images resulted in lower trust in the automation, while priming <b>negative</b> <b>images</b> resulted in higher trust.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study is to (a) predict {{adversarial}} attitudes toward male-female relationships and (b) explore the relationships between traditional agents of socialization and personal acceptance of <b>negative</b> <b>images</b> in rap videos by African American adolescents. Participants completed psychosocial measures, viewed videos, and completed surveys about the videos. Higher lev-els of adversarial attitudes toward male-female relationships and exposure to rap videos were associated with acceptance of <b>negative</b> <b>images</b> of women in the videos. Participants who reported watching rap videos because their friends watched them held less adversarial attitudes toward male-female relationships than did those who reported watching because they were fun to watch or to find out the latest trends. Furthermore, higher levels of spiritual or religious coping and higher socioeconomic status were associated with rejection of <b>negative</b> <b>images</b> of women in rap videos. Last, higher levels of spiritual or religious cop-ing were associated with the rejection of <b>negative</b> <b>images</b> of men and male-female interactions in rap videos.

25|$|The {{portrayal}} of Rottweilers as vicious or malevolently aggressive dogs in several fictional films and TV series, {{most notably in}} The Omen, along with sensationalist press coverage, has created a <b>negative</b> <b>image</b> of the breed. However, some films and television shows, such as Lethal Weapon 3, the 1998 film Half Baked, and the hit HBO show Entourage, have portrayed Rottweilers in a positive light. They are also featured in the children's book series Good Dog, Carl by Alexandra Day.|$|E
25|$|Earth {{figures are}} large designs and motifs that are created {{on the stone}} ground surface. They can be {{classified}} through their method of manufacture.

40|$|In {{the present}} study, we {{examined}} {{whether and how}} brief viewing of positive and <b>negative</b> <b>images</b> influences subsequent understanding of solutions to insight problems. For each trial, participants were first presented with an insight problem and then briefly viewed a task-irrelevant positive, <b>negative,</b> or neutral <b>image</b> (660 ms), which {{was followed by the}} solution to the problem. In our behavioral study (Study 1), participants were faster to report that they understood the solutions following positive images, and were slower to report it following <b>negative</b> <b>images.</b> A subsequent fMRI study (Study 2) revealed enhanced activity in the angular gyrus and medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) while viewing solutions following positive, as compared with <b>negative,</b> <b>images.</b> In addition, greater activation of the angular gyrus was associated with more rapid understanding of the solutions. These results suggest that brief viewing of positive images enhances activity in the angular gyrus and MPFC, which results in facilitation of understanding solutions to insight problems...|$|R

40|$|Most {{theories}} of emotion hold that negative stimuli are threatening and aversive. Yet in everyday experiences some negative sights (e. g. car wrecks) attract curiosity, whereas others repel (e. g. a weapon pointed in our face). To examine the diversity in negative stimuli, we employed four classes of visual images (Direct Threat, Indirect Threat, Merely Negative and Neutral) {{in a set}} of behavioral and functional magnetic resonance imaging studies. Participants reliably discriminated between the images, evaluating Direct Threat stimuli most quickly, and Merely <b>Negative</b> <b>images</b> most slowly. Threat images evoked greater and earlier blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) activations in the amygdala and periaqueductal gray, structures implicated in representing and responding to the motivational salience of stimuli. Conversely, the Merely <b>Negative</b> <b>images</b> evoked larger BOLD signal in the para-hippocampal, retrosplenial, and medial prefrontal cortices, regions which have been implicated in contextual association processing.
