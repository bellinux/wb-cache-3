These developments also led to the rise of the private bus operators, which were able to provide services in areas not covered by the Board, and later to directly challenge the Board itself. After introducing a number of measures to directly combat the private operators, legislative means were employed to deal with them.|$|E

25|$|The {{existence}} of the Preston curve {{has been used by}} Lant Pritchett and Larry Summers to argue that poor countries should focus on economic growth, and that health improvements will come about spontaneously as a result of increases in income. According to these authors, in 1990 better economic performance could have prevented {{more than half a million}} child deaths worldwide. However, the upward shifts of the Preston curve still imply that the main portion of gains in life expectancy has come about as a result of improved health technology rather than just increases in per capita income. Preston did, however, acknowledge that in the poorest countries economic growth may be necessary for improvements in health, as even the most inexpensive technologies have a cost of adoption that poor countries may <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>afford.</b>|$|E
25|$|Annual {{fees are}} up to about £27,000 per year for {{boarders}} or about £34,000 for international boarders (2014–15). Like most public schools, King's is a non-profit educational body and a registered charity, and as such benefits from substantial tax breaks. It was calculated by David Jewell, master of Haileybury, that in 1992 such tax breaks save the school about £1,945 per pupil per year. The school offers bursaries and allowances, £1,575,525 was provided in 2013, and scholarships which totalled £304,197. These include music scholarships—amounting to around two-thirds for choristers whilst serving in the Cathedral Choir, and a third scholarship upon their continuation as a pupil in the Senior School. There are further major and minor scholarships for music, sports and academic performance. The Senior School occasionally offers a large major scholarship for a promising organist or musician who is of a particularly high quality. Like many public schools, King's offers fee reductions when more than one child attends, and {{to the children of}} staff members. There also bursaries for children of the Clergy, Armed Forces and to those who would otherwise <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>afford</b> it, on a means tested basis.

500|$|Murphy was {{responsible}} for selecting all of the songs covered on the album, and strove to maintain a balance between show tunes and chart hits. He {{was surprised at the}} ease with which use of songs was approved by the record labels approached, and explained, [...] "I think the key to it is they loved the tone of it. They loved that this show was about optimism and young kids, for the most part, reinterpreting their classics for a new audience." [...] Music supervisor P.J. Bloom cleared the song rights with their respective publishers, and music producer Adam Anders rearranged the tracks for the Glee cast. [...] "Take a Bow" [...] was offered for use at a reduced licensing rate, which surprised Murphy, who had believed he would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>afford</b> the rights given that it had been a number one hit for Rihanna. Neil Diamond had some reluctance over licensing [...] "Sweet Caroline" [...] to the show, and retracted clearance after it had already been recorded. Bloom was able to convince him to reverse his decision, and Diamond went on to also license his song [...] "Hello Again" [...] for use on the show at a later date.|$|E
500|$|He was {{not offered}} a {{professional}} contract at Chesterfield by manager Arthur Cox and so left the club {{without making a}} senior appearance at Saltergate. However, he was soon spotted playing amateur football in Nunthorpe by Hartlepool United manager Billy Horner. Houchen joined the [...] "Monkey Hangers" [...] on non-contract terms, before turning professional in February 1978, signing a one-year contract on £30 a week. When {{he arrived at the}} Victoria Park, Hartlepool were a struggling Fourth Division club. He made his debut in a 1–1 home draw with Crewe Alexandra. Though grateful for the opportunity and training, Houchen lamented that [...] "we used to have a mad rush to the bank to cash our cheques. Only about six of them would go through and the rest would bounce." [...] He scored his first senior goal against Barnsley on 24 March 1978. He scored further goals against Darlington, Rochdale and Newport County to end the 1977–78 campaign with four goals in 13 games. He played regular first team football in 1978–79, and scored 13 goals in 42 games to become the club's top scorer. He then went on to score 14 goals in 44 games in 1979–80, as the club finished 19th, just two points above the re-election zone. His goalscoring record attracted the attention of bigger clubs, however club chairman Vince Barker told Reading that even if Houchen was available then they would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>afford</b> him. His exploits continued into the following season, and the club rejected bids of up to £80,000 from Plymouth Argyle and Cardiff City. He scored 17 goals in 48 appearances in 1980–81, yet again becoming the club's top scorer, as Hartlepool were in the promotion hunt until a late spell of bad form sent them down the table to ninth. He hit 19 goals in 38 games in 1981–82 to become the club's top-scorer for a fourth consecutive season. However, having scored 65 goals in 170 league appearances, Houchen wanted a move to a bigger club at a higher division; he regularly handed in transfer requests, but all were ignored by the club.|$|E

2500|$|Reading [...] Rabbi Levi {{taught that}} blessed actions bless {{those who are}} {{responsible}} for them, and cursed actions curse those {{who are responsible for}} them. The Midrash interpreted the words of [...] "A perfect and just weight you shall have," [...] to mean that if one acts justly, one will have something to take and something to give, something to buy and something to sell. Conversely, the Midrash read [...] to teach, [...] "You shall not have (possessions if there are) in your bag diverse weights, a great and a small. You shall not have (possessions if there are) in your house diverse measures, a great and a small." [...] Thus, if one does employ deceitful measures, one will not have anything to take or give, to buy or sell. The Midrash taught that God tells businesspeople that they [...] "may not make" [...] one measure great and another small, but if they do, they [...] "will not make" [...] a profit. The Midrash likened this commandment to that of [...] (20:20 in the NJPS) [...] "You shall not make with Me gods of silver, or gods of gold, you shall not make," [...] for if a person did make gods of silver and gold, then that person would <b>not</b> <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>afford</b> to have even gods of wood or stone.|$|E
