A biographical film directed by Martin Scorsese {{has long been}} in production. A 1998 episode of the BBC documentary series Arena, The Voice of the Century, focused on Sinatra. Alex Gibney directed a four-part biographical series on Sinatra, All or Nothing At All, for HBO in 2015. A musical tribute was aired on CBS television in December 2015 to mark Sinatra's centenary.|$|E

500|$|... "Ice" [...] {{features}} {{two elements}} common to other works by Morgan and Wong: dual identities and the questioning of one's personality. In her essay [...] "Last <b>Night</b> <b>We</b> Had an Omen", Leslie Jones noted this thematic leitmotif {{in several of}} their other X-Files scripts: [...] "the meek animal-control inspector who is a mutant shape-shifter {{with a taste for}} human liver , the hapless residents of rural Pennsylvania driven mad by a combination of insecticides and electronic equipment , [...] the uptight PTA run by practicing Satanists [...] ".|$|E

Hammerstein stated, [...] "we were religious in keeping away from the trite things—the kindly old stage door man named Pop, the pretty little understudy who replaces the star on opening <b>night.</b> <b>We</b> steered clear, too, of the backstage story of a company putting on a new show, with all the anxieties of the actors and producers... It seemed right to focus on a show which is already running because we wanted to tell a story about a community, the backstage community, and this community becomes settled and established after a show opens." ...|$|E

500|$|The music video, {{directed}} by Gavin Bowden, was first released December 7, 2000 on Vh1.com. It {{served as an}} official video for the song, after an unofficial version was released by DreamWorks as a [...] "temporary video" [...] that was played on MTV2. In an interview with MTV Radio, Wade explained {{the process of making}} the music video, and said, [...] "We shot the video at this really cool place in Crenshaw, in L.A., that was a bowling alley upstairs and a roller rink downstairs. It had this really weird, retro vibe to it. When they were setting up the different sets, we'd have to stop every 10 seconds because a bowling league would walk in. It was the coolest thing. At <b>night,</b> <b>we</b> got all of our friends to come down." ...|$|E
500|$|... "The She", {{named after}} a nightclub that the Deals' brother used to visit, has been {{described}} as having a funky feel, with a start-and-stop rhythm of bass and drums. Bryant found the track's keyboard part reminiscent of Stereolab's music, while AllMusic's Heather Phares likened the entire song to Jefferson Airplane's [...] "White Rabbit". Cibula mentioned that the [...] "creepy/cool ... sound [...] the characteristic Kim Deal familiar/strange lyrics: 'Sorrow blowin' through the vents / I'm over Houston / You're over the <b>night</b> <b>we</b> met.'" [...] Kim Deal plays every instrument on [...] "Too Alive" [...] and both sisters sing. Moores noted the track's buoyant feel and the steady strumming style of Deal's guitar. To Phares, the song possesses an immediacy as though the listener were there watching the performance in person.|$|E
500|$|In October 1990, {{a decade}} after his divorce from Angie, Bowie and Somali-born supermodel Iman were {{introduced}} by a mutual friend. Bowie recalled, [...] "I was naming the children the <b>night</b> <b>we</b> met... it was absolutely immediate." [...] They married in 1992. Tin Machine resumed work the same month, but their audience and critics, ultimately left disappointed by the first album, showed little interest in a second. Tin Machine IIs arrival was marked by a widely publicised and ill-timed conflict over the cover art: after production had begun, the new record label, Victory, deemed the depiction of four ancient nude Kouroi statues, judged by Bowie to be [...] "in exquisite taste", [...] "a show of wrong, obscene images", requiring air-brushing and patching to render the figures sexless. Tin Machine toured again, but after the live album [...] failed commercially, the band drifted apart, and Bowie, though he continued to collaborate with Gabrels, resumed his solo career.|$|E

500|$|On Thursday, May 26, 2005, Holloway and 124 fellow {{graduates}} of Mountain Brook High School arrived in Aruba for a five-day, unofficial graduation trip. The teenagers {{were accompanied by}} seven chaperones. According to teacher and chaperone Bob Plummer, the chaperones met with the students each day {{to make sure everything}} was fine. Jodi Bearman, who organized the trip, stated, [...] "the chaperones were not supposed to keep up with their every move." [...] Police Commissioner Gerold Dompig, who headed the investigation from mid-2005 until 2006, stated that the Mountain Brook students engaged in [...] "wild partying, a lot of drinking, lots of room switching every <b>night.</b> <b>We</b> know the Holiday Inn told them they weren't welcome next year. Natalee, we know, she drank all day every day. We have statements she started every morning with cocktails—so much drinking that Natalee didn't show up for breakfast two mornings."

500|$|Fired {{partly by}} his mother's stories of joy flights in pre-war Britain, {{and a desire}} to become a flying boat captain for Imperial Airways, Cresswell applied to join the Royal Air Force (RAF) in September 1937. Receiving no answer from the RAF, he applied for the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF), and was accepted. He entered No.1 Flying Training School at Point Cook, Victoria, as an air cadet in July 1938. Over the next twelve months he learnt to fly in Avro Cadet, deHavilland Gipsy Moth and Westland Wapiti trainers, and {{graduated}} as a pilot officer. His first posting was to No.3 (Army Cooperation) Squadron at Richmond, New South Wales, where he began flying Hawker Demon fighters in July 1939. Cresswell recalled a mix of excitement and panic within the squadron when World WarII broke out two months later: [...] "The second <b>night</b> <b>we</b> all slept on the hangar floor next to our aircraft. Imagine it: there was war over in Europe and here we were at action stations!" ...|$|E
500|$|In November 2010, Fox {{announced}} that Fringe was being moved to Friday nights {{as a part}} of the network's midseason overhaul, to air after the fourth season of their reality series Kitchen Nightmares. The move meant that Fringe would be airing against Supernatural, a show with a similar science fiction genre, though this competition did not begin until Fringes third Friday episode [...] "Concentrate and Ask Again". Fox's popular reality series American Idol took Fringes timeslot, as it was shifted a day later to Wednesdays and Thursdays. Executive producer J.H. Wyman stated in an interview that they were excited and believed Friday nights are [...] "open territory that can be conquered... we can actually deliver like The X-Files did. ... I think we both agree it's a good opportunity". Wyman elaborated that the show's high DVR numbers proved that though fans were watching the show, they did not want to do so on Thursdays. Co-executive producer Jeff Pinkner felt that if the show [...] "can build a fan base on and carve out some territory on Friday <b>night,</b> <b>we</b> can be there for years".|$|E

500|$|We paid our {{shilling}} at the gate, {{and then}} we saw for the first time, that the entrance, {{if there had been}} any magic about it at all, was now decidedly disenchanted, being, in fact, nothing more nor less than a combination of very roughly-painted boards and sawdust. We glanced at the orchestra and supper-room as we hurried past—we just recognised them, and that was all. We bent our steps to the firework-ground; there, at least, we should not be disappointed. We reached it, and stood rooted to the spot with mortification and astonishment. That the Moorish tower—that wooden shed with a door in the centre, and daubs of crimson and yellow all round, like a gigantic watch-case! That the place where night after <b>night</b> <b>we</b> had beheld the undaunted Mr. Blackmore make his terrific ascent, surrounded by flames of fire, and peals of artillery, and where the white garments of Madame Somebody (we forget even her name now), who nobly devoted her life to the manufacture of fireworks, had so often been seen fluttering in the wind, as she called up a red, blue, or party-coloured light to illumine her temple! ...|$|E
500|$|By June 1943, it {{was clear}} to the USCG that the {{recruiting}} process in place did not favor the SPARS, so it withdrew from the joint agreement effective 1 July 1943. Hence, all women applicants for SPARS would be interviewed and enlisted at USCG district recruiting stations. The change was met with increased enthusiasm by the recruiters and it proved positive overall. Still, the competition remained keen with the other, better known, women services. Some recruiters referred to themselves as peddlers of patriotism, but their lot was not an easy one. In their book, Three Years Behind the Mast, the authors Mary Lyne and Kay Arthur, both officers in SPARS, described the realities of recruiting in this way: During the day, we made speeches distributed posters, decorated windows, led parades, manned information booths, interviewed applicants, appeared on radio programs, and gave aptitude tests. By <b>night,</b> <b>we</b> made more speeches; prayed women would be drafted, and went to bed dreaming about our quotas. [...] The main recruiting effort had ended. During the 25-month recruitment period, about 11,000 women signed enlistment contracts to serve in the SPARS. Yeoman Third Class Dorothy Tuttle was the first woman to enlist in the SPARS at a recruiting station on 7 December 1942.|$|E
500|$|Under Kristine Kathryn Rusch F {{began to}} publish more dark fantasy and horror stories, such as [...] "The <b>Night</b> <b>We</b> Buried Road Dog" [...] by Jack Cady, which won a Nebula Award. [...] When Rusch {{took over as}} editor, Isaac Asimov had been writing the science column for over three decades, and Algis Budrys had been {{contributing}} a book review column since 1975; in 1992 Asimov died and Budrys departed. [...] The science column ran for 399 consecutive issues, ending in February 1992. [...] Asimov's widow, Janet Asimov, wrote another essay for the December 1994 issue, based on her conversations with her husband before his death, and a final essay appeared in January 1996, containing material from the book Yours, Isaac Asimov: A Lifetime of Letters. [...] The science column continued to appear, written by Bruce Sterling and Gregory Benford among others, and John Kessel took over the book reviews; Robert Killheffer succeeded Kessel, with some overlap in 1994 and 1995. [...] Asimov's maintained its dominance of the field through the 1990s, though Rusch published well-received material such as [...] "The Martian Child" [...] by David Gerrold and [...] "Last Summer at Mars Hill" [...] by Elizabeth Hand. [...] Rusch won one Hugo Award as editor during her five years at F, in 1994.|$|E

500|$|... "Empire State of Mind" [...] {{was created}} by singer-songwriter-producer Angela Hunte, a native of Brooklyn, along with writing partner Jane't [...] "Jnay" [...] Sewell-Ulepic. Hunte {{grew up in the}} same {{building}} where rapper and hip hop artist Jay-Z lived—560 State Street, an address which is mentioned in the song. The track's creation was inspired during an overseas trip Hunte and Sewell-Ulepic made to London in February 2009 when they were both feeling homesick. Hunte was ill during that summer, while Sewell-Ulepic's mother was ill. Hunte recalls, [...] "We said to ourselves, 'we complain so much about New York—about the busy streets, about the crowds and the pushing, about the subway system—but I would trade that for anything right now.' Before we left the hotel that <b>night,</b> <b>we</b> knew we would write a song about our city." [...] Although they wrote the song as a simple way to voice their feelings for their hometown, they sent it to the Roc Nation music label the following month in hope that Jay-Z would like it and record it. When they received negative reviews about the track they were convinced it would never be recorded. However, in the summer of the same year, EMI Music Publishing's (EMI) Jon [...] "Big Jon" [...] Platt heard the track at a barbecue {{and fell in love with}} it, believing that [...] "it would be perfect for Jay-Z".|$|E

In his review of the episode, Dan Iverson of IGN wrote: [...] "After a couple more episodes like the one that Family Guy had on Sunday <b>night,</b> <b>we</b> could officially and unequivocally call the show the best animated program to air on the weekend", adding [...] "we are completely willing to raise the once hit-or-miss comedy of Family Guy to the level of most consistently funny comedy on FOX Sunday nights— and that is thanks to great stories and hilarious comedy like that of this week's episode [...] "Barely Legal." [...] In a review of Family Guy, Volume five, Nancy Basile regarded [...] "Airport '07", [...] "Prick Up Your Ears", and [...] "Barely Legal" [...] as [...] "gem episodes". Brett Love of TV Squad commented: [...] "It seemed like more of a cohesive story than we have seen in a while as the whole family was tied in to the same storyline", later adding [...] "I liked the story of Meg's infatuation with Brian", concluding with [...] "overall, I'd call this one a really good episode." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{his first}} year with Dorsey, Sinatra {{recorded}} over forty songs. Sinatra's first vocal hit was the song [...] "Polka Dots and Moonbeams" [...] in late April 1940. Two more chart appearances followed with [...] "Say It" [...] and [...] "Imagination", which was Sinatra's first top-10 hit. His fourth chart appearance was [...] "I'll Never Smile Again", topping the charts for twelve weeks beginning in mid-July. Other records with Tommy Dorsey issued by RCA Victor include [...] "Our Love Affair" [...] and [...] "Stardust" [...] in 1940; [...] "Oh!

As his success and popularity grew, Sinatra pushed Dorsey {{to allow him to}} record some solo songs. Dorsey eventually relented, and on January 19, 1942, Sinatra recorded [...] "Night and Day", [...] "The <b>Night</b> <b>We</b> Called It a Day", [...] "The Song is You" [...] and [...] "Lamplighter's Serenade" [...] at a Bluebird recording session, with Axel Stordahl as arranger and conductor. Sinatra first heard the recordings at the Hollywood Palladium and Hollywood Plaza and was astounded at how good he sounded. Stordahl recalled: [...] "He just couldn't believe his ears. He was so excited, you almost believed he had never recorded before. I think this was a turning point in his career. I think he began to see what he might do on his own".|$|E
