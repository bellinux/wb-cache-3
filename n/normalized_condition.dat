40|$|The strong {{boundary}} <b>normalized</b> <b>condition</b> of wavefunction for fully occupied semicore 3 d orbitals {{leads the}} linear response DFT+U on such metal oxide {{to have an}} insurmountable obstacle in Hubbard U determination. We treated the orbital self-energy and orbital relaxation as components of eigenvalues with respective orbital occupation number that follows the Fermi-Dirac distribution. By self-consistently solving the second partial deviation of total energy based on the most simple local density formalism with Hubbard U correction, we found the local density exchange-correlation potential functional can only give a minimized residue of the self-energy and orbital relaxation on the focus orbital if the Janak theorem maintained. Such residue turns to well counteracted in the fully occupied orbitals and non-zero the partially occupied orbitals. With keeping the validation of Janak theorem on localized orbitals, the self-consistent cycle by local density functional with Hubbard U correction cannot find out a set of orbital occupation that simultaneously offsets the orbital self-energy and relaxations in the empty and partially filled shell, but returns {{a unique set of}} the occupation for fully occupied shell. The band gap calculations on fully occupied orbital based compounds are thus improved and the relaxed lattices are also shown based on minimization of the self-energy error, which shows a possible route for accurate excited state studies.

40|$|The {{microstructure}} {{of carbon}} and alloy steels with various carbon contents {{before and after}} the gradient hardening by means of highly concentrated plasma jet have been investigated. It is shown that the resulting structure after the surface hardening has a substantially smaller grain size as compared to the bulk hardening. The steels with different carbon content, that is hypoeutectic steels 45 and 50 HN, eutectic steels – M 76, U 8, hypereutectoid steels – 90 HF, U 10 have been researched. Processing was carried out under the optimal conditions to ensure the highest hardness of the surface without melting. Metalgraphical studies were carried out using optical and scanning electron microscopes. High-dispersed martensite is the main structural component for hypoeutectic steels. Despite the fact that the heating temperature and the cooling rate {{in different parts of the}} plasma exposure zone differ greatly, the structure of the tempered zone is uniform by both the degree of dispersion and by the values of hardness. Plasma treatment of eutectic steels results in fine-grained structure of martensite of mainly lamellar morphology. High-dispersed martensite with microparticles of secondary carbides is characteristic of the hardened zones for hypereutectic steels. But austenite grains do not grow at heating as it usually happens in bulk hardening. The structure of the transition zone corresponds to part-hardened steels. So excess ferrite as well as martensite retains in hypoeutectic steels while excess cementite retains in hypereutectic steels. Eutectic steels are free from the intercritical interval, and the transition zone does not practically develop, there being a very sharp boundary between the zone of full hardening and the parent metal. Due to this structure of the plasma hardening zone of the surface layer there arises 3, 5 [...] . 4, 5 -fold increase in the hardness of the steel as compared with the <b>normalized</b> <b>condition.</b> This is due to the increase in the degree of saturation of the solid solution with alloying elements and carbon, and size-reduction of the hardened structur...|$|E

40|$|This work {{presents}} {{two methods}} for numerical conformal mappings of unbounded multiply connected regions onto several classes of canonical slit regions. The first method is only limited to conformal mapping of unbounded multiply connected regions onto {{the first category}} of Koebe's canonical regions. It is based on three boundary integral equations formed with the classical adjoint Neumann kernel, adjoint generalized Neumann kernel and modified Neumann kernel. These integral equations are constructed from a boundary relationship satisfied by an analytic function on the unbounded multiply connected regions. By adding some <b>normalizing</b> <b>conditions,</b> the integral equations are uniquely solvable. The second method is for numerical conformal mapping and its inverse of unbounded multiply connected regions onto the first, second, third and fourth category of Koebe’s canonical regions. It is based on reformulating the conformal mapping problem as a Riemann-Hilbert problem and an adjoint Riemann-Hilbert problem. Two integral equations formed with the adjoint generalized Neumann kernel are constructed. With some <b>normalizing</b> <b>conditions,</b> the integral equations are uniquely solvable. For both methods, discretizing the integral equations with their <b>normalizing</b> <b>conditions</b> lead to systems of linear algebraic equations which are solved by Gaussion elimination method to obtain the boundary values of the mapping functions. The interior values of the mapping functions are then determined by using Cauchy’s integral formula.
