40|$|Mycoplasma genitalium is {{a leading}} cause of chlamydia-negative, <b>nongonoccocal</b> <b>urethritis</b> and has been {{directly}} implicated in numerous other genitourinary as well as extragenitourinary tract pathologies. Detection of M. genitalium has relied almost entirely on PCR amplification of clinical specimens and evidence of seroconversion since these mycoplasmas are highly fastidious and culture isolation by microbiological techniques is very rare. We have established a combinatorial strategy using confocal immunoanalysis (CIA) and real-time PCR to qualitatively and quantitatively assess patterns of M. genitalium infection in women attending a sexually transmitted disease-related health clinic in San Antonio, Tex. CIA allows spatial examination of mycoplasmas on surfaces and inside human target cells, plus the ability to evaluate cell-to-cell patterns and variances within samples. Real-time PCR permits determination of genome copy numbers of mycoplasmas and human cells by multiplex amplification using mycoplasma gyrA and human RNase P gene sequences, which indicates overall levels of mycoplasma infection and degree of parasitism. These assays are strongly correlated and, in combination, permit detection and elucidation of heretofore-unrecognized patterns of M. genitalium infections in clinical and experimental samples...|$|E
40|$|Many {{cases of}} {{mucopurulent}} cervicitis (MPC) are idiopathic and cannot {{be attributed to}} the known cervical pathogens Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis, or herpes simplex virus. Because Mycoplasma gen-italium is associated with <b>nongonoccocal</b> <b>urethritis</b> in men, its role in MPC, the corresponding syndrome in women, was investigated. Archived cervical specimens from women recruited in the Harborview Sexually Transmitted Disease Clinic in Seattle from 1984 to 1986 were tested, using polymerase chain reaction, in a study that identified other causes of and risk factors for MPC. M. genitalium was detected in 50 (7. 0 %) of 719 women. Young age, multiple recent partners, prior miscarriage, smoking, menstrual cycle, and douching were positively associated with M. genitalium, whereas bacterial vaginosis and cunnilingus were negatively associated. After adjustment for age, phase of menstrual cycle, and presence of known cervical pathogens, women with M. genitalium had a 3. 3 -fold greater risk (95 % confidence interval, 1. 7 – 6. 4) of MPC, which suggests that this organism may be a cause of MPC. Physician office visits by women with symptoms of re-productive tract infection (RTI) number 13. 5 million annually in the United States [1]. Many more infections are asymptomatic, making RTI a major source of mor...|$|E
40|$|Mycoplasma genitalium is {{a leading}} {{pathogen}} of <b>nongonoccocal</b> chlamydia-negative <b>urethritis,</b> which has been implicated directly in numerous other genitourinary and extragenitourinary tract pathologies. The pathogenesis of infection is attributed in part to excessive immune responses. M. genitalium-derived lipid-associated membrane proteins (LAMPs) are a mixture of bacterial lipoproteins, exposed at the surface of mycoplasma, that are potent inducers of the host innate immune system. However, the interaction of M. genitalium-derived LAMPs as pathogenic agents with Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and the signaling pathways responsible for active inflammation and NF-κB activation have not been fully elucidated. In this study, LAMPs induced the production of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) in a dose-dependent manner. Blocking assays showed that TLR 2 - and CD 14 -neutralizing antibodies reduced the expression of TNF-α and IL- 6 in THP- 1 cells. Furthermore, LAMP-induced NF-κB activation was increased in 293 T cells transfected with TLR 2 plasmid. The activity of NF-κB was synergically augmented by cotransfected TLR 1, TLR 6, and CD 14. Additionally, LAMPs were shown to inhibit NF-κB expression by cotransfection with dominant-negative MyD 88 and TLR 2 plasmids. These results suggest that M. genitalium-derived LAMPs activate NF-κB via TLR 1, TLR 2, TLR 6, and CD 14 in a MyD 88 -dependent pathway...|$|R
