5000|$|There {{had been}} a <b>noise-reduction</b> <b>programme</b> in process which had managed to reduce the noise level from 113 dB to the desired level of 96 dB from 600 ft (180 m) away, less than the noise made by a London Underground train, {{and at the time}} of cancellation, {{silencers}} were under development, which would have reduced the noise even further â€” with 95 dB at 200 ft [...] "foreseen", the limitation being the noise created by the rotor itself. This effort, however, was insufficient for BEA who, as expressed by Chairman Sholto Douglas, [...] "would not purchase an aircraft that could not be operated due to noise", and the airline refused to order the Rotodyne, which in turn led to the collapse of the project.|$|E
