5|$|During the battle, the Japanese Army {{conducted}} an air {{attack on the}} U.S. <b>naval</b> <b>fleet</b> at Okinawa as promised, but they failed to sink any ships. Around 115 aircraft—many of them kamikaze—attacked the U.S. ships throughout the day of 7 April. Kamikaze aircraft hit the aircraft carrier Hancock, battleship , and destroyer , causing moderate damage to Hancock and Maryland and heavy damage to Bennett. About 100 of the Japanese aircraft {{were lost in the}} attack.|$|E

5|$|In 1971, the Port of Karachi {{housed the}} {{headquarters}} of the Pakistani Navy and almost the entire Pakistan <b>Naval</b> <b>fleet</b> was based at Karachi Harbour. It is also the hub of Pakistan's maritime trade, meaning that a blockade would be disastrous for Pakistan’s economy. The defence of Karachi harbour was therefore paramount to the Pakistani High Command and it was heavily defended against any air or naval strikes, including cover from strike aircraft based at two airfields in the area.|$|E

Meanwhile, the old galleys, together with the might of a vessel armed with 80 cannons, waged war at sea against the pirates.|$|E

50|$|Gas {{and steam}} {{turbines}} are most efficient at thousands of revolutions per minute. This {{is a major}} drawback {{because of the need}} for heavy gears, which drive the engine into one single duty, propulsion. Electric motors provide numerous applications including use of accessories besides that of propulsion. Permanent magnets and even motor generator sets will soon be included into <b>Naval</b> <b>fleets</b> that will have a larger variety of applications. Along with increased application usage, <b>Naval</b> <b>fleets</b> will produce less exhaust than leading diesel turbines, which will lead to a cleaner and more efficient vehicle.|$|R

By the end of 1187 the Ayyubids were in control of virtually the entire Crusader kingdom in the Levant {{with the exception of}} Tyre, which held out under Conrad of Montferrat. In December 1187, an Ayyubid army consisting of the garrisons of Saladin and his brothers from Aleppo, Hama, and Egypt besieged Tyre. Half of the Muslim <b>naval</b> <b>fleet</b> was seized by Conrad's forces on 29 December, {{followed by}} an Ayyubid defeat on the shoreline of the city.

5|$|Moveable sails: By {{the time}} of the Zhou Dynasty ship {{technologies}} such as stern mounted rudders were developed, and by the Han Dynasty, a well kept <b>naval</b> <b>fleet</b> {{was an integral part of}} the military. The Chinese used the complex moving technology behind the kite allowed then to develop the worlds first moving sails (in comparison with the mounted sails used in the West) around 200 AD. These moving sails allowed ships to sail into the wind for the first time in human history. Civilizations around the world soon emulated the Chinese technology and eventually moving sails became the standard on ships.|$|E

Sextus fled to the east with his remaining forces, where he was captured and executed in Miletus by one of Antony's generals the following year. As Lepidus and Octavian accepted the surrender of Pompeius' troops, Lepidus attempted to claim Sicily for himself, ordering Octavian to leave. Lepidus' troops deserted him, however, and defected to Octavian since they were weary of fighting and were enticed by Octavian's promises of money.|$|E

5|$|The Battle of Bita Paka (11 September 1914) {{was fought}} south of Kabakaul, {{on the island}} of New Britain, and {{was a part of the}} {{invasion}} and subsequent occupation of German New Guinea by the Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force (AN) shortly after the outbreak of the First World War. Similar to New Zealand's operation against German Samoa in August, the main target of the operation was a strategically important wireless station—one of several used by the German East Asiatic Squadron—which the Australians believed to be located in the area. The powerful German <b>naval</b> <b>fleet</b> threatened British interests and its elimination was an early priority of the British and Australian governments during the war.|$|E
5|$|The Poles, {{completely}} {{surprised by}} the Swedish invasion, in September attempted a counter-offensive, but were defeated by Gustavus Adolphus at the Battle of Gniew. The forces required serious modernization. The Sejm passed high taxation for the defense, but collections lagged behind. The situation was partially saved by the City of Danzig, which hurriedly embarked {{on the construction of}} modern fortifications, and by Hetman Stanisław Koniecpolski. The accomplished commander of the eastern borderlands fighting quickly learned the maritime affairs and contemporary methods of European warfare. Koniecpolski promoted the necessary enlargement of the <b>naval</b> <b>fleet,</b> modernization of the army, and became a fitting counterbalance for the military abilities of Gustavus Adolphus.|$|E

The United States provided crucial logistic and diplomatic support throughout the crisis, while the cruiser USS Mobile Bay protected the INTERFET <b>naval</b> <b>fleet</b> and a US Marine infantry battalion of 1,000 men—plus organic armour and artillery—was also stationed off the coast aboard the USS Belleau Wood to provide a strategic reserve {{in the event of}} significant armed opposition.|$|E

By {{the turn of the twentieth}} century, an antiquated Brazilian <b>naval</b> <b>fleet</b> with just forty-five percent of its authorized personnel (in 1896) and only two modern armored warships could be faced by Argentine and Chilean navies filled with ships ordered in the last decade.|$|E
5|$|After 1906, the Canadian Government {{took over}} the Halifax Dockyard (now CFB Halifax) from the Royal Navy. This {{dockyard}} later became the command centre of the Royal Canadian Navy upon its founding in 1910. Just before the First World War, the Canadian government began to make a determined, costly effort to develop the harbour and waterfront facilities. The outbreak of the war brought Halifax back to prominence. As the Royal Canadian Navy had virtually no seaworthy ships of its own, the Royal Navy assumed responsibility for maintaining Atlantic trade routes by re-adopting Halifax as its North American base of operations. In 1915, management of the harbour fell {{under the control of}} the Royal Canadian Navy under the supervision of Captain Superintendent Edward Harrington Martin; by 1917 there was a growing <b>naval</b> <b>fleet</b> in Halifax, including patrol ships, tugboats, and minesweepers.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} February 1933, Hitler {{announced}} that rearmament must be undertaken, albeit clandestinely at first, as {{to do so}} was {{in violation of the}} Versailles Treaty. A year later he told his military leaders that 1942 was the target date for going to war in the east. He pulled Germany out of the League of Nations in 1933, claiming its disarmament clauses were unfair as they applied only to Germany. The Saarland, which had been placed under League of Nations supervision for 15 years at the end of World War I, voted in January 1935 to become part of Germany. In March 1935, Hitler announced that the Reichswehr would be increased to 550,000 men and that he was creating an air force. Britain agreed that the Germans would be allowed to build a <b>naval</b> <b>fleet</b> with the signing of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement on 18 June 1935.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in 280 BC, Pyrrhus {{embarked}} on a campaign in Magna Graecia (i.e. southern Italy) against the Roman Republic known as the Pyrrhic War, followed by his invasion of Sicily.

Pyrrhus returned to Epirus in 275 BC after the stalemate and ultimate failure of both campaigns, which contributed to the rise of Rome now that Greek cities in southern Italy such as Tarentum became Roman allies. Despite having a depleted treasury, Pyrrhus decided to invade Macedonia in 274 BC, due to the perceived political instability of Antigonus II's regime. After defeating the largely mercenary army of Antigonus II at the 274 BC Battle of Aous, Pyrrhus was able to drive him out of Macedonia and force him to take refuge with his <b>naval</b> <b>fleet.</b>|$|E

The following year, Nhon expelled further Tây Sơn troops from the surrounding province of Gia Định, and inflicted heavy losses on the Tây Sơn <b>naval</b> <b>fleet.</b> Taking advantage of the more favorable situation, Nguyễn Ánh sent a diplomatic mission to Siam to propose a treaty of friendship.
