The time-averaged velocity profile of a turbulent boundary layer can be predicted by combining its different trends in {{the inner and outer}} regions in a single law of the wake. A new <b>non-dimensional</b> <b>coordinate</b> system that projects the time-averaged velocity profiles of the inner and the outer regions on the same non-dimensional plane is introduced, leading to a unified treatment for the mixing region. In this coordinate system, various laws of the wake are shown to be the same but a constant. The non-dimensionalization is tested on a specific law of the wake, in which the closure coefficients are regressed from wind tunnel measurements and direct numerical simulations of turbulent boundary layers under zero-pressure gradient, over a good range of boundary layer thickness based Reynolds numbers. This data fit produced profiles within 2 % of the reference values. This is of practical use to numerical modellers for generating boundary layer inflow profiles...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{transport}} properties (viscosity and thermal conductivity) and surface roughness were compared experimentally to investigate non-self-similar Mach reflection phenomena in weak shock waves. The {{effect of the}} transport properties was changed by varying the initial pressure ahead of the incident shock in experiments conducted at Karlsruhe (KIT) and Saitama (SIT). By introducing a non-dimensional distance based on physical properties behind the Mach stem, {{the difference between the}} results under various experimental conditions was diminished, and in some cases the results almost coincide with each other within the error in angle measurement. In order to investigate the effect of surface roughness, further experiments were conducted at SIT using models with rough surfaces. The results were compared with those for smooth surfaces. The effect of surface roughness turned out to be small compared with the viscosity effect, proving the effect of transport properties to be dominant. The fact that the discrepancies between the SIT and KIT experiments vanished after introducing the <b>non-dimensional</b> <b>coordinate</b> may possibly be ascribed to inaccuracy in angle measurement at KIT. © 2011 by National Committee for IUTAM...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—The steady-stale and {{transient}} {{processes of}} the external heating of a flat plate under a convective flow is studied in this paper, with inclusion of the axial heat conduction through the plate. The balance equations reduce to a single integro-differential equation with only one parameter, a, denoting {{the ratio of the}} ability of the plate to carry heat in the streamwise direction to the ability of the gas to carry heat out of the plate. The two limits ofagood conducting plate(«-+ oo) andabad conducting plate( • 0) are analysed through the appUcationof a regular perturbation procedure for the first case and a singular perturbation technique for the latter. The existence oftwo boundary layers at both edges of the plate is shown and theirstructure are analysed. The evolution of the temperature of the plate is then obtained for a constant external energy flux input.

40|$|A {{theory of}} cold rolling of thin gauge strip is {{presented}} which, within the idealizations of homogeneous deformation and a constant coeficient of Coulomb friction, rigorously models the elastic deformation of the rolls and the frictional traction at the interface. In contrast with classical theories (3) it is shown that, for gauges {{less than a}} critical value, plastic reduction takes place in two zones, at entry and exit, which are separated by a neutral zone in which the rolls are compressedflat {{and there is no}} slip between the rolls and the strip. Roll load and torque are governed by five independent non-dimensional parameters which express the influence of gauge, reduction, friction and front and back tensions. Values of load and torque have been computed (for zerofront and back tensions) {{for a wide range of}} thickness, reduction and friction and have been found to collapse approximately on to a single master curve.

30|$|Using the <b>non-dimensional</b> <b>coordinates</b> all magneto-spheres of {{the same}} {{multipole}} configuration but with different strength can be normalized: The topology of the field lines are {{the same for all}} values of the magnetic moments, but the normalized size of the Earth differs. For small moments it is larger than for large ones. Figure 3 shows an example of two magnetospheric situations. The left upper figure demonstrates the magnetic field lines of a magnetic dipole moment mz, 0 in a cylindrical magnetosphere, the right one shows the magnetic field of a moment mz, 1 = 0.1 mz, 0. The size of the magnetosphere, determined by Eq. (32), is about half that of the first case. Zooming the first magnetosphere by a factor of one and the second by a factor of two, as seen in the lower figure of Fig. 3, the field lines are the same, but the radius r 1 of the sphere, which describes the Earth with the lower dipole moment is twice as large as the radius r 0 for the case with the larger dipole moment.|$|R
40|$|An {{efficient}} algorithm to implement elastic scattering using the Lennard-Jones (LJ) intermolecular {{potential in the}} direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method is presented. The exact elastic scattering angle for the LJ intermolecular potential obtained by numerical integration is used to construct a piecewise polynomial representation in terms of two collision parameters - the reduced impact parameter and the reduced relative energy. The 5 thdegree polynomials representation is obtained using the Chebyshev basis. The implementation valid for reduced relative energies ranging from 0. 001 to 10. 0 is verified by DSMC simulations of subsonic and supersonic Couette flow of Argon at temperatures of 273 K and 40 K and is shown to accurately reproduce the viscosity variation with temperature that corresponds to the LJ intermolecular potential. The LJ collision model is formulated in <b>non-dimensional</b> <b>coordinates</b> and is applicable to arbitrary gas species. For the Couette flow problem, the algorithm is shown to have a computational cost comparable to the variable hard sphere (VHS) model that is widely used in DSMC simulations...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn many {{industrial}} processes, {{the use of}} a liquid-gas {{jet pump}} refers to the ejection of the vapor-gas medium, i. e. a medium containing non-condensable and condensable gases in the liquid jet. Conventional calculation methods are used for jet devices that eject non-condensable gases. However, the presence of steam in the medium ejected makes a significant contribution to the operational process and, consequently, its mathematical description and device specifications. The article deals with the development of physical and mathematical models and determination of properties of liquid-gas jet pumps (LGJP) with an ejected vapor-gas medium. While calculating the performance there were used: Bernoulli equation – for spin-up of the active flow in the nozzle device; water balance equation, heat balance, conservation of momentum – for vapor condensation in the suction chamber; momentum equation and isothermal state equation of liquid-gas mixture – for mixture of media in the mixing chamber; liquid-gas mixture flow equation– for transformation of excess kinetic energy into the potential energy in the diffuser. Extremal characteristics that reflected the potential of the LGJP work were calculated {{on the basis of the}} equations. Analysis of specifications was carried out in a <b>non-dimensional</b> <b>coordinates</b> – in terms of the ejection coefficient by dry gas and compression ratio. The calculation of set of extremal characteristics with different ratios of the steam flow to the liquid showed that the presence of steam in the pumped medium degrades performance, i. e. the ejection coefficient is reduced at a constant compression ratio...|$|R

40|$|Liquid helium obtains {{superfluid}} properties when cooled {{below the}} Lambda transition temperature of 2. 17 K. A superfluid, {{which is a}} partial Bose Einstein condensate, has many exotic properties including free flow without friction, and ballistic instead of diffusive heat transport. A superfluid is also uniquely characterized {{by the presence of}} quantized vortices, dynamical line-like topological phase defects around which all circulation in the flow is constrained. Two vortices can undergo a violent process called reconnection when they approach, cross, and retract having exchanged tails. With a numerical examination of a local, linearized solution near reconnection we discovered a dynamically unstable stationary solution to the Gross-Pitaevskii equation, which was relaxed to a fully non-linear solution using imaginary time propagation. This investigation explored vortex reconnection {{in the context of the}} changing topology of the order parameter, a complex field governing the superfluid dynamics at zero temperature. The dynamics of the vortices can be studied experimentally by dispersing tracer particles into a superfluid flow and recording their motions with movie cameras. The pioneering work of Bewley et al. provided the first visualization technique using frozen gases to create tracer particles. Using this technique, we experimentally observed for the first time the excitation of helical traveling waves on a vortex core called Kelvin waves. Kelvin waves are thought to be a central mechanism for dissipation in this inviscid fluid, as they provide an efficient cascade mechanism for transferring energy from large to microscopic length scales. We examined the Kelvin waves in detail, and compared their dynamics in fully self-similar <b>non-dimensional</b> <b>coordinates</b> to theoretical predictions. Additionally, two experimental advances are presented. A newly invented technique for reliably dispersing robust, nanometer-scale fluorescent tracer particles directly into the superfluid is described. A detailed numerical investigation of the particle-vortex interactions provides novel calculations of the force trapping particles on vortices, and a scaling was found suggesting that smaller particles may remain bound to the vortices at much higher speeds than larger particles. Lastly, a new stereographic imaging system has been developed, allowing for the world-first three-dimensional reconstruction of individual particles and vortex filament trajectories. Preliminary data, including the first three-dimensional observation of a vortex reconnection are presented...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1987 An {{experimental}} study of the properties of plane jets issuing at various angles into a cross-flow of air was conducted to obtain information relating to the momentum diffusion properties of the jet flow {{in order to provide}} a background for predicting the feasibility of the preswirl concept of the Volumetric Air Heating Receiver, an advanced solar central receiver concept. The properties investigated included the deflection of the jet axis, the decay of velocity along the jet axis, and the determination of similarity characteristics of the jet velocity profiles. Experiments were carried out for three different jetto- cross-flow velocity ratios (R = 4. 0, 5. 1, 6. 2) and angles (θ = 90 °, 75 °, 60 °). Hot film anemometry was used to determine velocity magnitudes. Correlation of the data obtained revealed that the jet axes for the 90 degree angle correlated very well when the <b>non-dimensional</b> spatial <b>coordinates</b> were reduced by R² whereas the axes for the 75 and 60 degree angles correlated well when their coordinates were reduced by R. This suggested that there was a prominence of momentum effects for the smaller angles, as opposed to a prominence of energy (inertia) effects for the normal jet. The decay of excess non-dimentional velocity for all experimental conditions was very well correlated when the non-dimentional natural coordinate (jet axis) was reduced by R, {{the relationship between the two}} being very nearly linear with a - 0. 77 power of s/hR. The velocity profile data obtained proved to be impossible to correlate and no conclusions on velocity profile similarity could be drawn. The jet axis and velocity decay correlations proved useful in concluding that the preswirl concept for the V. A. H. R. could be feasible given large enough velues of jet velocity ratio and jet orifice apperture, in order, however, to be possible to draw any definite conclusions for the receiver design, a scaled model of the V.

40|$|Analytical {{expressions}} for the axial and transverse acoustic radiation {{forces as}} well as the radiation torque per length are derived for a rigid elliptical cylinder placed arbitrarily in the field of in plane progressive, quasi-standing or standing waves. The rigid elliptical cylinder case is important to be considered as a first-order approximation of the behavior of a fluid particle suspended in air, because of the significant acoustic impedance mismatch at the particle's boundary. Based on the partial-wave series expansion method in cylindrical <b>coordinates,</b> <b>non-dimensional</b> acoustic radiation force and torque functions are derived and defined in terms of the scattering coefficients of the elliptic cylinder. A coupled system of linear equations is obtained after applying the Neumann boundary condition for an immovable surface in a non-viscous fluid, and solved numerically by matrix inversion after performing a single numerical integration procedure. Computational results for the non-dimensional force components and torque, showing the transition from the progressive to the (equi-amplitude) standing wave behavior, are performed with particular emphasis on the aspect ratio a/b, where a and b are the semi-axes of the ellipse, the dimensionless size parameter, {{as well as}} the angle of incidence ranging from end-on to broadside incidence. The results show that the elliptical geometry has a direct influence on the radiation force and torque, so that the standard theory for circular cylinders (at normal incidence) leads to significant miscalculations when the cylinder cross-section becomes non-circular. Moreover, the elliptical cylinder experiences, in addition to the acoustic radiation force, a radiation torque that vanishes for the circular cylinder case. The application of the formalism presented here may be extended to other 2 D surfaces of arbitrary shape...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{is focused on}} the experimental analysis and numerical simulation of adiabatic developing two-phase refrigerant flow in manifolds including the inlet tube after the expansion device. The two-phase flow development in the tube after the expansion valve significantly affects distribution in the manifold. Visualized flow structure is divided into three regions. The transitions among these regions are based on the phase separation status. Relationships between the lengths of those regions and flow characteristics are developed. The liquid phase is assumed to be continuous phase at high quality conditions so that the Eulerian model of Eulerian-Eulerian approach is chosen for the numerical simulation using FLUENT 6. Better prediction is achieved for high inlet qualities. Two-phase flow regimes in the manifold are mapped for the first time. Indicators of distribution uniformity are plotted in the maps. The maps are presented in two forms: <b>non-dimensional</b> Froude number <b>coordinates</b> and mass flux-quality coordinates. Effect of the two-phase flow in the inlet tube (after the expansion valve) on distribution in the manifold is explored. Eulerian model in FLUENT 6 is the most appropriate for the conditions studied in the manifold. Simulation results for the same geometry of the manifold and the same operating conditions as used in experiments demonstrate very good prediction of flow field and reasonable prediction of liquid distribution among branches. Experiments were performed using R 134 a in a facility designed for visualization (PDPA, photo) and twophase flow distribution measurements for various inlet tube and flow characteristics. For most experiments, a transparent manifold in simplified geometry was used. Further experimental analysis is done for a manifold of a real plate evaporator. Atomization nozzles are first time applied as the expansion devices at the inlet of the manifold in order to generate mist homogenous flow, which in this study is proven to contribute to uniform distribution.
