5|$|Following relegation in 1980, Bolton signed former Manchester United European Cup winning striker Brian Kidd from Everton for £150,000 as they {{prepared}} to challenge {{for a quick}} return to the First Division. Kidd scored a hat-trick in his third game for Bolton, a 4–0 win over Newcastle United in the league, {{but the rest of}} the season was a struggle as Bolton finished close to the relegation places. By the end of the 1981–82 season, Bolton were <b>no</b> <b>closer</b> to promotion and had lost several key players including Peter Reid and Neil Whatmore. The following season Bolton were relegated to the Third Division after losing 4–1 at Charlton Athletic on the final day.|$|E

The seal impressions from Elephantine only prove that this island {{seems to have}} been an important place to visit in Khaba's time. The inscriptions reveal that the seals and their belonging vessels originated from Thinis and that they were registered by the governor of Elephantine. Other seals show the depiction of the goddess Bastet. The Hierakonpolis seal was found in early dynastic ruins of a local Horus temple. It shows traces of the image of a god, possibly Ash.|$|E

25|$|The club {{continued}} {{to be one of}} the country's best-supported teams. The visit of Arsenal on 12 October 1935 attracted a crowd 82,905 to Stamford Bridge, which remains a club record and the second highest ever attendance at an English league match. Crowds of almost 50,000 attended Gallacher and Jackson's home debuts. In 1939, with the club having come <b>no</b> <b>closer</b> to on-field success, Knighton stepped down. He was succeeded by Scotsman and former Queens Park Rangers manager, Billy Birrell.|$|E
25|$|Vice Admiral Ashby {{of the red}} {{squadron}} {{failed to}} help the Dutch, as the Marquis de Villette succeeded in tacking ahead, placing Ashby between two fires. When Torrington brought {{the remainder of the}} red squadron into action, he found difficulty in getting close enough because of the sag in the French line and came <b>no</b> <b>closer</b> than twice gunshot range. Admiral Tourville, finding himself with few adversaries in the centre, pushed forward his own leading ships, which Torrington's dispositions had left without opponents, further strengthening the French attack in the van. The Dutch were now opposed by the whole of Château-Renault's squadron and the van and centre divisions of Tourville's squadron.|$|E

25|$|Scramble: {{also known}} as ambrose or best-shot; each player in a team tees off on each hole, and the players decide which shot was best. Every player then plays their second shot from within a clublength of where the best shot has come to rest (and <b>no</b> <b>closer</b> to the hole), and the {{procedure}} is repeated until the hole is finished. This system is very common at informal tournaments such as for charity, as it speeds play (due to the reduced number of shots taken from bad lies), allows teams of varying sizes, and allows players of widely varying skill levels to participate without a profoundly negative impact on team score.|$|E
25|$|While it had {{organized}} {{roughly half of}} the porters within the company, the union was seemingly <b>no</b> <b>closer</b> to obtaining recognition {{than it had been}} in 1925. By 1928 BSCP leaders decided that the only way to force the issue was to strike the company. The leadership was, however, divided on what a strike could accomplish: some rank-and-file leaders wanted to use the strike as a show of strength and an organizing tool, while Randolph was more cautious, hoping to use the threat of a strike as the lever to get the federal National Mediation Board established pursuant to the Railway Labor Act to bring the Pullman Company to the table while mobilizing support from supporters outside the industry.|$|E
25|$|Houston and Perth reached Tanjong Priok on 28 February, {{where they}} {{attempted}} to resupply, but were met with fuel shortages and no available ammunition. The two cruisers were ordered to sail to Tjilatjap with Dutch destroyer , but departed at 17:00 without Evertsen, which was delayed. The Allies believed that Sunda Strait was free of enemy vessels, with the last intelligence reports indicating that Japanese warships were <b>no</b> <b>closer</b> than , but a large Japanese force had assembled at Bantam Bay. At 23:06, the two cruisers were off St. Nicholas Point when lookouts on Perth sighted an unidentified ship; when it was {{realized that she was}} a Japanese destroyer, Perth engaged. However, as this happened, multiple Japanese warships appeared and surrounded the two Allied ships.|$|E

25|$|In Niger, {{fighting}} flared after a Ramadan truce in 2007, with land-mine {{attacks and}} incursions reaching {{areas in the}} south and center of the nation previously unaffected. The Nigerien government, rejecting any negotiations, pursued a crackdown on rebel forces and {{declared a state of emergency}} in the north which by December 2007 threatened to spark a humanitarian crisis. High-profile arrests of domestic and foreign media, the expulsion of European NGOs from the area, and the reported human rights practices of the Nigerien Armed Forces in the Agadez Region have led to criticism of the Nigerien government abroad, and continued fighting in the north. Despite government military victories in early 2008, and condemnation for a hostage seizure and land-mine attacks (for which the rebels deny responsibility), the MNJ appeared <b>no</b> <b>closer</b> to either defeat or overthrow of the Nigerien government as the rainy season approached in August 2008.|$|E
25|$|The Union {{military}} command in the West, however, {{suffered from a}} lack of unified command, organized by November into three separate departments: the Department of Kansas, under Maj. Gen. David Hunter, the Department of the Missouri, under Maj. Gen. Henry Halleck, and the Department of the Ohio, under Brig. Gen. Don Carlos Buell (who had replaced Brig. Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman). By January 1862, this disunity of command was apparent because no strategy for operations in the Western theater could be agreed upon. Buell, under political pressure to invade and hold pro-Union East Tennessee, moved slowly in the direction of Nashville, but achieved nothing more substantial toward his goal than minor victories at Middle Creek (January 10, 1862) under Col. James A. Garfield and Mill Springs (January 19) under Brig. Gen. George Henry Thomas. (Mill Springs was a significant victory in a strategic sense because it broke the end of the Confederate Western defensive line and opened the Cumberland Gap to East Tennessee, but it got Buell <b>no</b> <b>closer</b> to Nashville.) In Halleck's department, Grant demonstrated up the Tennessee River by attacking the Confederate camp at Belmont to divert attention from Buell's intended advance, which did not occur. On February 1, 1862, after repeated requests by Grant, Halleck authorized Grant to move against Fort Henry on the Tennessee.|$|E
25|$|Baffle Design: baffles {{are used}} in shell and tube heat {{exchangers}} to direct fluid across the tube bundle. They run perpendicularly to the shell and hold the bundle, preventing the tubes from sagging over a long length. They can also prevent the tubes from vibrating. The {{most common type of}} baffle is the segmental baffle. The semicircular segmental baffles are oriented at 180 degrees to the adjacent baffles forcing the fluid to flow upward and downwards between the tube bundle. Baffle spacing is of large thermodynamic concern when designing shell and tube heat exchangers. Baffles must be spaced with consideration for the conversion of pressure drop and heat transfer. For thermo economic optimization it is suggested that the baffles be spaced <b>no</b> <b>closer</b> than 20% of the shell’s inner diameter. Having baffles spaced too closely causes a greater pressure drop because of flow redirection. Consequently, having the baffles spaced too far apart means that there may be cooler spots in the corners between baffles. It is also important to ensure the baffles are spaced close enough that the tubes do not sag. The other main type of baffle is the disc and doughnut baffle, which consists of two concentric baffles. An outer, wider baffle looks like a doughnut, whilst the inner baffle is shaped like a disk. This type of baffle forces the fluid to pass around each side of the disk then through the doughnut baffle generating a different type of fluid flow.|$|E

500|$|In 2014, {{based on}} {{similarities}} of {{the orbits of}} a group of recently discovered extreme trans-Neptunian objects, astronomers hypothesized the existence of a super-Earth planet, 2 to 15 times the mass of the Earth and beyond 200 AU with possibly a high inclined orbit at some 1500 AU. In 2016, further work showed this unknown distant planet is likely on an inclined, eccentric orbit that goes <b>no</b> <b>closer</b> than about 200 AU and no farther than about 1200 AU from the Sun. [...] The orbit is predicted to be anti-aligned to the clustered extreme trans-Neptunian objects.

500|$|Following the 1994 Shoemaker-Levy 9 comet impacts with Jupiter, Teller {{proposed}} to a collective of U.S. and Russian ex-Cold War weapons designers in a 1995 planetary defense workshop at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), that they collaborate {{to design a}} 1 gigaton nuclear explosive device, which would be equivalent to the kinetic energy of a 1km diameter asteroid. In order to safeguard the earth, the theoretical 1 Gt device would weigh about 25–30 tons, hence light enough to be lifted on the [...] Russian Energia rocket {{and it could be}} used to instantaneously vaporize a 1km asteroid, divert the paths of extinction event class asteroids (greater than 10km in diameter) within a few months of short notice, while with 1-year notice, at an interception location <b>no</b> <b>closer</b> than Jupiter, it would also be capable of dealing with the even rarer short period comets which can come out of the Kuiper belt and transit past Earth orbit within 2 years. For comets of this class, with a maximum estimated 100km diameter, Charon served as the hypothetical threat.|$|E
500|$|The Owls {{defeated}} Rhode Island 80–67 on February 5. Scootie Randall scored 27 {{points as}} Temple Owls shot 53.2 {{percent from the}} field.

Brandon Frazier of the Rams drained a three-pointer with 13:17 left to trail 53–50, but they would get <b>no</b> <b>closer.</b> Ramone Moore scored 22 points to lead the Owls. Lavoy Allen left {{the game in the}} second half with an injury to his right ankle. Allen missed the following game against Dayton, but Temple Owls managed a 75–63 victory nonetheless, sparked by Ramone Moore's 26 points. Temple Owls missed their first seven shots, allowing Dayton to stay in the game. However, Moore hit a three-pointer to start an 11–2 run to put the Owls ahead 18–12.
