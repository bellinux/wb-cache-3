5|$|A general {{lawlessness}} {{prevailed in}} the vast Texas frontier, and Mexico's civic laws went largely unenforced among the Anglo-American settlers. In particular, the prohibitions against slavery and forced labor were ignored. The requirement that all settlers be Catholic or convert to Catholicism was also subverted. Mexican authorities, perceiving that they were losing control over Texas and alarmed by the unsuccessful Fredonian Rebellion of 1826, abandoned the policy of benign rule. <b>New</b> <b>restrictions</b> were imposed in 1829–1830, outlawing slavery throughout the nation and terminating further American immigration to Texas. Military occupation followed, sparking local uprisings and a civil war. Texas conventions in 1832 and 1833 submitted petitions for redress of grievances to overturn the restrictions, with limited success. In 1835, an army under Mexican President Santa Anna entered its territory of Texas and abolished self-government. Texans responded by declaring their independence from Mexico on March 2, 1836. On April 20–21, rebel forces under Texas General Sam Houston defeated the Mexican army at the Battle of San Jacinto. In June 1836, Santa Anna agreed to Texas independence, but the Mexican government refused to honor Santa Anna's pledge. Texans, now de facto independent, recognized that their security and prosperity could never be achieved while Mexico denied the legitimacy of their revolution.|$|E

40|$|We {{identify}} a <b>new</b> <b>restriction</b> on Boolean circuits called bijectivity and prove that bijective Boolean circuits require exponential size {{to compute the}} Boolean permanent function. As consequences of this lower bound, we show exponential size lower bounds for: (a) computing the Boolean permanent using monotone multilinear circuits; (b) computing the 0 - 1 permanent function using monotone arithmetic circuits; and (c) computing the lexicographically first bipartite perfect matching function using circuits over (min; concat). The lower bound arguments for the Boolean permanent function are adapted to prove an exponential lower bound for computing the Hamiltonian cycle function using bijective circuits. We {{identify a}} class of monotone functions such that if their counting version is]P-hard, then there are no polynomial size bijective circuits for such functions unless PH collapses.

40|$|Nuclear {{recessive}} mutations at the chloroplast mutator (CHM) {{locus of}} Arabidopsis produce a variegated phenotype that is inherited in a non-Mendelian fashion. Molecular {{analysis of the}} cytoplasmic genomes of variegated plants from two independent chm mutant lines, using specific chloroplast and mitochondrial probes, showed that the chm mutations reproducibly induce the appearance of specific <b>new</b> <b>restriction</b> fragments in the mitochondrial genome. The presence of these restriction fragments cosegregated with the variegated phenotype in the progeny of crosses between mutant and wild-type plants. Sequence analysis {{of one of the}} <b>new</b> <b>restriction</b> fragments found in the variegated plants suggested that it was the product of a rearrangement event involving regions of the mitochondrial genome.
