5|$|A Scottish crest badge is a heraldic badge worn to show {{allegiance}} {{to an individual}} or membership in a specific Scottish clan. Crest badges are commonly called clan crests, {{but this is a}} misnomer; there is <b>no</b> <b>such</b> <b>thing</b> as a collective clan crest, just as there is <b>no</b> <b>such</b> <b>thing</b> as a clan coat of arms.|$|E
5|$|In one scene, C.J. {{says that}} special {{prosecutor}} Rollins was {{the editor of}} the Yale Law Review. There is <b>no</b> <b>such</b> <b>thing</b> as the Yale Law Review, though the journal of legal scholarship affiliated with the Yale Law School is called the Yale Law Journal.|$|E
5|$|Anonymous {{is tired}} of {{corporate}} interests controlling the internet and silencing the peopleâ€™s rights to spread information, but more importantly, the right to SHARE with one another. The RIAA and the MPAA feign to aid the artists and their cause; yet they do <b>no</b> <b>such</b> <b>thing.</b> In their eyes is not hope, only dollar signs. Anonymous will not stand this any longer.|$|E

5|$|Newton's Third Law is {{a result}} of {{applying}} symmetry to situations where forces {{can be attributed to the}} presence of different objects. The third law means that all forces are interactions between different bodies, and thus that there is <b>no</b> <b>such</b> <b>thing</b> as a unidirectional force or a force that acts on only one body.|$|E
5|$|Catherine {{states that}} Northanger Abbey looks exactly as she {{imagined}} {{it and she}} becomes intrigued by Mrs. Tilney's death. Due to her overactive imagination, Catherine starts to believe that General Tilney murdered his wife. Henry catches her in his mother's chamber and becomes offended when he realises what she has been thinking. Catherine apologises and Henry tells her that perhaps {{it is possible to}} read too many novels. Catherine receives a letter from James, in which he reveals that his engagement to Isabella has been called off, because she allowed Frederick to seduce her. Eleanor explains to Catherine that her brother has no intention of marrying Isabella. Catherine gets a letter from Isabella, asking her to apologise to James for her, but Catherine states that she will do <b>no</b> <b>such</b> <b>thing.</b>|$|E
5|$|While {{many critics}} refer to film noir as a genre itself, {{others argue that}} it can be <b>no</b> <b>such</b> <b>thing.</b> While noir is often {{associated}} with an urban setting, many classic noirs take place in small towns, suburbia, rural areas, or on the open road; setting, therefore, cannot be its genre determinant, as with the Western. Similarly, while the private eye and the femme fatale are character types conventionally identified with noir, the majority of film noirs feature neither; so there is no character basis for genre designation as with the gangster film. Nor does film noir rely on anything as evident as the monstrous or supernatural elements of the horror film, the speculative leaps of the science fiction film, or the song-and-dance routines of the musical.|$|E

5|$|On Halloween, Millennium Group member Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) is carving a jack-o'-lantern while {{preparing}} {{to take his}} daughter Jordan (Brittany Tiplady) trick-or-treating. As he leaves to collect her, he notices a demonic figure watching him from across the street. That night, Jordan deliberately passes by one house, telling Black that it is haunted. Black tells her there are <b>no</b> <b>such</b> <b>thing</b> as ghosts, but is reminded of a moment from his past. In a flashback, we see a five-year-old Black being dared by his friends to knock {{the door of the}} same house; a man named Crocell (Dean Winters) answers and invites Black inside. Crocell is a Second World War veteran, and he explains the meaning of Halloween to Black, telling the boy that it is the one night of the year that ghosts walk among the living. Crocell hopes that it is his chance to commune with the friends he lost in the war, and is dismayed when the young Black dismisses the possibility of ghosts.|$|E
