In education, change {{is reflected in the}} international borrowing of ideas, which result in an ever-shifting landscape of reforms adopted at government level, and mandated for implementation in schools. The black and white productivity model of meeting performance targets is applied, and it is expected that teachers will negotiate curriculum changes efficiently and effectively to raise the standards of student performance. While success for all is the goal, and quality teaching is emphasised as the key to education, {{the reality is that the}} performance of Australian students in international and national testing does not meet the expectations of the government.

40|$|This article {{looks at}} regime {{complexes}} {{from a state}} policymaking perspective. It develops a theoretical model in which regime complexes become denser over time while governmental policymaking becomes more coherent. Under this model, interactions between global regime complexes and national policymaking are twofold. On the one hand, greater policy coherence generates <b>negotiated</b> <b>mandates</b> asking for regime connections and complex density. On the other hand, regime-complex density creates more cohesive audiences, which increase incentives for national policy coherence. This co-adjustments model brings states into the discussion of institutional interactions and critically questions the desirability and feasibility of recent calls for joined-up government and whole-of-government approaches.

2500|$|Secret {{treaties}} (in {{which the}} agreement itself is secret) are distinct from secret negotiations (in which the ongoing negotiations are confidential, {{but the final}} agreement is public). Colin Warbrick writes that in Britain, [...] "the prerogative power to negotiate and conclude treaties puts the government in a powerful position. [...] It {{does not need to}} seek a <b>negotiating</b> <b>mandate</b> from Parliament and can keep its positions confidential until the conclusion of negotiations." [...] The traditional rule in favor of secrecy of negotiations is in tension with values of transparency: Anne Peters writes that [...] "the growing significance of multilateral treaties as global ... instruments invites a readjustment of the relative weight accorded to the values of discreteness and confidentiality of diplomatic treaty negotiations ... on one hand, and the interests of third parties and the global public on the other hand." [...] The secrecy of negotiations for free trade agreements such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement have been politically controversial, with some commentators favoring greater transparency and others emphasizing the need for confidentiality.|$|E

40|$|The ERM paper {{unfortunately}} has strayed radically {{from its}} carefully <b>negotiated</b> <b>mandate</b> and terms of reference. The Parties were {{clear that they}} did not want further debate over the merits of the Basel Ban Amendment, nor did they desire an evaluation of it prior to its entry into force. Further, the entire exercise was to be conducted with a view toward assisting parties to implement the ban. However the paper strays often into the aforementioned dangerous territories. Much of the material covered with respect to the various terms of reference is far off of the mark of the issues delineated for exploration. The text often appears to have been cut and pasted from related information with the authors often forgetting the original element to be explored. The ERM paper’s content, superfluous, dangerously off-target or not, unfortunately contains various statements which betray a serious lack of full understanding of the Basel Ban, its history and rationale. Most significant and potentially dangerous of these errors is the assumption that the basis for the ban – to avoid a lack of environmentally sound management (ESM) of hazardous wastes, only refers to downstream management in non-Annex VII waste importing countries, and not upstream management in Annex VII countries.

40|$|The Uruguay Round {{produced}} {{the first ever}} set of rules regulating the trade in services, the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS). For {{the first time since}} the GATT had came into effect in 1948, internationally agreed rules and commitments, broadly comparable with those of the GATT, became applicable to the trade in services That the GATS was created should not be interpreted as meaning that themany different views expressedduring its negotiationwere successfully resolved. An agreement on GATS rules could only be reached at the end of the Uruguay Round, and, in order to arrive at an agreement, Members decided to include only basic and commonly accepted rules. Contentious issues or rules, such as safeguards, government procurement and subsidies, which needed to be further defined, were not therefore included in the GATS. Members generally agreed that the negotiations which were carried out during the Uruguay Round on an emergency safeguard mechanism, government procurement and subsidies and countervailing measures (hereinafter ‘GATS rules’) had to be continued. Members recognised that the relationship between these issues and the trade in services had to be addressed. The mandate to engage or conclude negotiations on emergency safeguard measures, government procurement and subsidies is, thus, provided for in the GATS. In March 1995, the Council for Trade in Services established the Working Party on GATS Rules to carry out the <b>negotiating</b> <b>mandates</b> contained in the GATS on emergency safeguard measures, government procurement and subsidies. Since July 1995, negotiations on these three issues have been held within the Working Party. SCOPUS: ch. binfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

40|$|This study explores provincial {{participation}} and examines (a) how and (b) {{to what extent}} <b>negotiating</b> <b>mandates</b> of the respective provinces {{are taken into account}} in the legislative processes of Parliament in selected bills in terms of ss 74 and 76 of the Constitution, 1996. It evaluates to what extent current systems, processes, rules and legislation give effect to the will of provinces, as an expression of the views emanating from provincial public participation. The study provides a brief overview of the historic background and evolution of the Parliament of South Africa, followed by a discussion of the constitutional and legislative framework from which the NCOP derives its mandate and a brief comparison of the NCOP to the second chamber of the German Federal Republic, the Bundesrat. The discussion of the Mandating Procedures of Provinces Act, 2008 examines in which ways the Act helps or hinders the mandating processes, drawing on case studies of selected s 76 bills processed before and after the MPPA came into effect. It considers whether the NCOP's public consultation can remedy flawed or inadequate public participation by a department. In the case of constitutional amendment bills that proposes provincial boundary changes, s 74 of the Constitution requires an affected province's approval for such a bill to be passed. It considers whether a constitutional amendment bill can be amended and propose various options for consideration. The conclusion finds that the NCOP gives effect to its constitutional mandate to represent provinces in the legislative and other processes of Parliament with lesser degrees of success in respect of ss 74 and 76 bills affecting provinces. It recommends a review and amendment of the MPPA and the NCOP Rules (and where relevant the Joint Rules of Parliament) to enable provinces to have a more meaningful impact on the legislative and other Parliamentary processes involving provinces...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines how}} the country’s largest real estate trade group <b>negotiated</b> the <b>mandate</b> for fair {{housing in the}} latter half of the twentieth century. I ask, how has the Realtor trade group informed the nation’s fair housing laws and policies since 1961 ? To answer this question, I chronicle the National Association of Real Estate Boards’ initial opposition to local and federal fair housing laws in the 1960 s and then trace how the organization—rebranded as the National Association of REALTORS®—seemingly transformed its position on fair housing in the post-civil rights decades. Inspired by sociological, historical, and urban studies scholarship that has considered real estate boards as powerful social organizations, this dissertation illustrates how Realtors brokered fairness in the post-civil rights housing market. Based upon my archival research on the trade group’s historical records, government documents, and newspaper accounts, I demonstrate how the Realtors steered the size, scope, and efficacy of the nation’s fair housing environment for three decades. This historical case study revises explanations for the weakness of federal fair housing law by emphasizing how Title VIII’s anemia was purposefully maintained by the National Association of REALTORS® and their political lobby. The Realtors, however, did not completely reject fair housing. I show that while the trade group exhibited a sustained ideological discord with government regulation and oversight of discrimination in the private residential housing market, its contemporary iteration nonetheless popularized the social directive for fair housing in order to rebrand itself as a fair and equitable housing servicer...|$|R
40|$|Throughout {{the first}} week of June, CTA's Advisory Committee held its annual meeting at the organisation's {{headquarters}} in Wageningen, the Netherlands. With Members from thirty ACP and EU countries, the Advisory Committee represents all six regions of the ACP Group and all the European Union Member States. According to Prof John Perfect, Director of the Natural Resources Institute and the nominee of the United Kingdom government, it is a 'unique body', whose collective knowledge and experience represents a major investment in the work of CTA. The task of the Advisory Committee, as underlined by Mr Colin Bully of Dominica, is to advise the Centre on how to fulfil its mandate and to ensure that the ACP farmer is getting a proper service. The Committee has to do this against a fast-changing background of ACP agriculture, and research and development activities within the European Union. This year, its works are also marked by the highly complex issue of the renegotiation of the ACP-EU Lomé Convention. This agreement between the European Union Member States and the 71 countries of the ACP Group is the lifeblood of CTA, which was established under its provisions. The present Convention, together with CTA's current mandate, expires in February 2000. It is widely assumed that the agreement will be carried forward in a modified form; both the ACP and EU <b>negotiating</b> <b>mandates</b> view CTA's contribution positively. Outgoing chairperson of the Committee, Mr Wim van Vuure of Wageningen University and Research Centre and the nominee of the Netherlands Government, told Spore that continuation was 'highly likely'. Adjusting to change is not new to the Advisory Committee, which has seen the Centre move away from its original 1983 role of making available information to help ACP States in their agricultural and rural development. It is commonly recognised nowadays that, whilst provision and management of information remains a core activity, CTA has become more of a facilitator and mediator of information, and increasingly an actor in capacity building. The new role is stressed by South and North alike in the Committee: Mr Colin Bully talks of CTA's position as a 'gateway and a conduit', Prof John Perfect of an 'interface' providing back-up to national and regional information providers and, incidentally, of a support to regional fora, including those in Europe, for coalescing and pooling their activities. There is also unanimity about the intended end beneficiary-the ACP farmer-and broad agreement that rather than simply provide information to the end-user, the Centre should increasingly also serve intermediaries and policy makers particularly by building capacity. However, there is also general consensus that it is not CTA's role {{to be involved in the}} policy-making area but rather to ensure that policy makers have the tools for optimal management and assessment of information. The growing emphasis on poverty reduction that is shaping so much of the general development debate-including the renegotiation of the Lomé Convention-was also strongly evident in the deliberations of the Advisory Committee. It is here that the substantive role of the Committee becomes most visible. As the incoming Chairperson, Ms Tsakani Ngomane of South Africa, pointed out, CTA's focus on poverty reduction means that women's issues will be the centre of attention. This will, in turn, stimulate the debate about a new wave of thinking on who is the actual end-user, who is the principal client and beneficiary. The debate is reiterated in letters from two readers on this page that discuss the 'him' and 'her' of the ACP farmer. Not that Ms Tsakani Ngoname's opinion leadership can be open to doubt: women are the primary clients, and it is time for affirmative action to help men move over. The new thrust of genderisation does not augur a polarisation around gender, but simply a surge of respect for clients' needs and an attempt to provide proper responses. This is clearly not the time to consider a scenario beyond March 2000 of ACP agriculture without the kind of the services that have been evolving in CTA with back-up from inputs from the Centre's Advisory Committee. Many would argue that their real work has only just begun. Throughout {{the first week}} of June, CTA's Advisory Committee held its annual meeting at the organisation's headquarters in Wageningen, the Netherlands. With Members from thirty ACP and EU countries, the Advisory Committee represents all six regions [...] ...|$|R
40|$|This study {{uses the}} case of the Banff School for the Arts Related to the Theatre (1933) to observe ways in which the {{institution}} as a location of performance practice and as a repository of (selected) knowledge can work to foster and assemble a national cultural identity.

This time period seemed to bring in a shift in the perception {{of the role of the}} cultural producer as pedagogue and expressive agent of a widespread identity. The Banff School began as a summer school for theatre, where leaders of Alberta's rural communities could be taught in standards of appreciation and taste, and where Canadian plays were prepared in a school of theatre that was distinctly Canadian. The School, as a site of education, cultural practice, and community builder, is constantly <b>negotiating</b> between its <b>mandates</b> of regional attention and builder of a national sense of citizenship, and its own identity as a model of international influences.

40|$| {{actively}} contribute {{by providing}} lead negotiators and issue leaders, {{and in the}} health case they felt committed to supporting the EU Presidency and Commission. Establishing a division of labour among the EU Member States was found useful. Fourthly, the Commissions role is unlikely to become much larger, since Member States suspect it either of competence snatching or of promoting its own policy objectives (e. g., defending economic instead of health interests {{in the case of}} negotiations taking place in the World Health Organisation). For this reason, they may prefer the involvement of the HR/VP and EEAS, since they are more closely linked to the EU Member States. The HR/VP chairs the Foreign Affairs Council, is directly appointed by the European Council, and one third of the EEAS is supposed to become staffed by diplomats from the EU Member States. Finally, it is important to bear in mind that since most <b>negotiating</b> <b>mandates</b> will still be decided by unanimity or QMV, EU coordination is likely to remain a time-consuming affair. Since the EU is a rather unique entity in the system of international relations, we can expect it to keep drawing attention from politicians and academics. An issue that could be considered to a larger extent is how its development towards becoming a more unified actor in international negotiations influences its position towards its negotiating environment. Clarity is needed as to whether the EU should be considered as one actor or a coalition of states, and what this means for voting rights, who its main negotiator is in international negotiations, and whether we can expect possible claims of EU membership of a larger number of international organisations. Internally, the confusion and debates over the division of competences are not constructive either. If the EU unites, it can be {{more than the sum of}} its parts, but only if these parts accept and support this.

40|$|This paper {{looks at}} EU trade policy and more specically at the <b>negotiating</b> <b>mandate</b> the Council must grant the Commission to start trade negotiations. The <b>negotiating</b> <b>mandate</b> {{is a set}} of {{directives}} that impose limits to the proposals the Commission can make. As such the mandate is legally binding and defendable in a court of justice. However, authors such as Kerremans (2004 b) and Damro (2007) also point out a di¤erent {{way of looking at the}} mandate by arguing that it sets out the maximum concessions the Council is willing to make during trade talks and that the mandate can thus be considered a signaling device. In this paper I analyze this proposed second role of the <b>negotiating</b> <b>mandate</b> in EU trade policy making by decoupling the two perspectives on the <b>negotiating</b> <b>mandate.</b> The results of the model show that when individual Council members can communicate with the Commission, there exists a signaling equilibrium in which the Commission complies with the mandate. nrpages: 14 status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a game-theoretical analysis of European Union (EU) trade {{policy and the}} Lisbon Treaty’s impact on it. Specifically, it develops spatial models of the EU’s international trade negotiations process, and analyzes the European Parliament’s increased involvement in it {{as a result of}} the introduction of the Parliamentary consent requirement for international trade agreements. We find that the Council’s right to set a <b>negotiating</b> <b>mandate</b> in trade negotiations is equivalent to an amendment right, and that the Commission’s right to propose a <b>negotiating</b> <b>mandate</b> to the Council is comparable to a monopoly proposal right in the negotiation process with the trade partner. We further conclude that the Parliament’s enhanced role limits the Commission’s ability to set policy and conclude negotiations. Even though it re{{presents a}} domestic constraint for the Commission, the Parliament’s involvement does not reinforce the Commission’s bargaining position in international negotiations. The Commission can use the <b>negotiating</b> <b>mandate</b> to improve its bargaining position instead. ...|$|E

Various perspectives of agricultural trade liberalization have come to the fore in the debate. The proponents of the trade liberalizatio...|$|E
40|$|The European Union {{has agreed}} on Commisioner Pascal Lamy's <b>negotiating</b> <b>mandate</b> for the ministerial {{conference of the}} World Trade Organisation(WTO). The mandate may be summed up as {{agreement}} to an all-round liberation of trade, but with some restrictive clauses concerning respect for cultural diversity, the precautionary principle and dialogue with the International Labour Organisation (ILO) on minimum social standards...|$|E
40|$|The latest EU-Russia-Summit on 27 th June 2008 marks a {{breakthrough}} in their relations. The planned negotiations on a new strategic partnership between the two actors were stalled for nearly two years. Now all member states have agreed on a broad <b>negotiating</b> <b>mandate</b> for the Commission. After the Irish 'No' to the Lisbon Treaty the talks with Russia become a test case for the EU´s capacity {{to act as a}} global player...|$|E
40|$|Theresa May has {{recently}} announced that negotiations for exiting the EU will begin by March 2017. What {{this means is that}} the composition of the Council of Ministers at that time is known – and it does not look likely that it will draw up a <b>negotiating</b> <b>mandate</b> that meets the UK’s main demands: lowering immigration and preserving market access. A late- 2017 notification, however, following key elections across the EU, might have been a better alternative, writes Kim Kaivanto...|$|E
40|$|New {{rules and}} {{mechanisms}} {{for the protection}} of geographical indications(GIs) have been a subject of lively discussion in the current multilateraltrading round—the Doha Development Agenda (DDA). Some WTO members advocate stronger multilateral protection for GIs and view progress on the issue as an important quid pro quo for advancing negotiations in other areas. Other members favor a less ambitious outcome as part of an eventual Doha Round package, and, in particular, argue that the <b>negotiating</b> <b>mandate</b> on GIs is limited in scope and ambition. Differences do not break along the typical North–South divide associated with intellectual property discussions in the WTO, nor along the lines of some of the main negotiating alliances in the DDA. Proponents of a stronger GI syste...|$|E
40|$|Investment is {{the bedrock}} of the {{economic}} relationship between the European Union and the United States. Together, EU and US firms have invested more than US$ 4 trillion in each others’ markets, and bilateral investment dwarfs transatlantic trade in goods and services. As the EU and US begin negotiating a Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) [...] an agreement that could be unprecedented in both its scale and scope [...] investment is {{shaping up to be}} one of the more difficult areas of discussion, both substantively and politically. The EU’s process for developing an overall TTIP <b>negotiating</b> <b>mandate</b> revealed deep fissures among EU institutions and stakeholders on investment, with Germany and other member states, certain non-governmental and public interest organizations and the European Parliament concerned about the commercial and legal implications of investment agreements with large economies...|$|E
